<h2><a name="Prologue" id="Prologue">PROLOGUE</a>
</h2>

<p class="intro">TIME is the warp of the tapestry which is life. It
is eternal, constant, unchanging. But the woof is gathered together
from the four corners of the earth and the twenty-eight seas and
out of the air and the minds of men by that master artist, Fate, as
she weaves the design that is never finished.</p>

<p class="intro">A thread from here, a thread from there, another
from out of the past that has waited years for the companion thread
without which the picture must be incomplete.</p>

<p class="intro">But Fate is patient. She waits a hundred or a
thousand years to bring together two strands of thread whose union
is essential to the fabrication of her tapestry, to the composition
of the design that was without beginning and is without end.</p>

<p class="intro">A matter of some one thousand eight hundred
sixty-five years ago (scholars do not agree as to the exact year)
Paul of Tarsus suffered martyrdom at Rome.</p>

<p class="intro">That a tragedy so remote should seriously affect
the lives and destinies of an English aviatrix and an American
professor of geology, neither of whom was conscious of the
existence of the other at the time this narrative begins&mdash;when
it does begin, which is not yet, since Paul of Tarsus is merely by
way of prologue&mdash;may seem remarkable to us, but not to Fate,
who has been patiently waiting these nearly two thousand years for
these very events I am about to chronicle.</p>

<p class="intro">But there is a link between Paul and these two
young people. It is Angustus the Ephesian. Angustus was a young man
of moods and epilepsy, a nephew of the house of Onesiphorus.
Numbered was he among the early converts to the new faith when Paul
of Tarsus first visited the ancient Ionian city of Ephesus.</p>

<p class="intro">Inclined to fanaticism, from early childhood an
epileptic, and worshipping the apostle as the representative of the
Master of earth, it is not strange that news of the martyrdom of
Paul should have so affected Angustus as to seriously imperil his
mental balance.</p>

<p class="intro">Conjuring delusions of persecution, he fled
Ephesus, taking ship for Alexandria; and here we might leave him,
wrapped in his robe, huddled, sick and frightened, on the deck of
the little vessel, were it not for the fact that at the Island of
Rhodus, where the ship touched, Angustus, going ashore, acquired in
some manner (whether by conversion or purchase we know not) a fair
haired slave girl from some far northern barbarian tribe.</p>

<p class="intro">And here we bid Angustus and the days of the
Caesars adieu, and not without some regrets upon my part for I can
well imagine adventure, if not romance, in the flight of Angustus
and the fair haired slave girl down into Africa from the storied
port of Alexandria, through Memphis and Thebae into the great
unknown.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1">I.&mdash;GATHERING THE THREADS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS far as I know the first Earl of Whimsey has
nothing to do with this story, and so we are not particularly
interested in the fact that it was not so much the fine grade of
whiskey that he manufactured that won him his earldom as the
generous contribution he made to the Liberal party at the time that
it was in power a number of years ago.</p>

<p>Being merely a simple historian and no prophet, I cannot say
whether we shall see the Earl of Whimsey again or not. But if we do
not find the Earl particularly interesting, I can assure you that
the same may not be said of his fair daughter, Lady Barbara
Collis.</p>

<p>The African sun, still an hour high, was hidden from the face of
the earth by solid cloud banks that enveloped the loftier peaks of
the mysterious, impenetrable fastnesses of the forbidding Ghenzi
Mountain range that frowned perpetually upon a thousand valleys
little known to man.</p>

<p>From far above this seeming solitude, out of the heart of the
densely banked clouds, there came to whatever ears there might be
to hear a strange and terrifying droning, suggesting the presence
of a preposterous Gargantuan bumblebee circling far above the
jagged peaks of Ghenzi. At times it grew in volume until it
attained terrifying proportions; and then gradually it diminished
until it was only a suggestion of a sound, only to grow once again
in volume and to again retreat.</p>

<p>For a long time, invisible and mysterious, it had been
describing its great circles deep in the concealing vapors that hid
it from the earth and hid the earth from it.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara Collis was worried. Her petrol was running low. At
the crucial moment her compass had failed her, and she had been
flying blind through the clouds looking for an opening for what now
seemed an eternity of hours to her.</p>

<p>She had known that she must cross a lofty range of mountains,
and she had kept at a considerable altitude above the clouds for
this purpose; but presently they had risen to such heights that she
could not surmount them; and, foolishly, rather than turn back and
give up her projected non-stop flight from Cairo to the Cape, she
had risked all in one effort to penetrate them.</p>

<p>For an hour Lady Barbara had been indulging in considerable high
powered thinking, intermingled with the regret that she had not
started thinking a little more heavily before she had taken off, as
she had, against the explicit command of her sire. To say that she
was terrified in the sense that fear had impaired any of her
faculties would not be true. However, she was a girl of keen
intelligence, fully competent to understand the grave danger of her
situation; and when there loomed suddenly close to the tip of her
left wing a granite escarpment that was lost immediately above and
below her in the all enveloping vapor, it is no reflection upon her
courage that she involuntarily caught her breath in a quick gasp
and simultaneously turned the nose of her ship upwards until her
altimeter registered an altitude that she knew must be far higher
than the loftiest peak that reared its head above any part of
Africa.</p>

<p>Rising in a wide spiral, she was soon miles away from that
terrifying menace that had seemingly leaped out of the clouds to
seize her. Yet even so, her plight was still as utterly hopeless as
it well could be. Her fuel was practically exhausted. To attempt to
drop below the cloud banks, now that she knew positively that she
was among lofty mountains, would be utter madness; and so she did
the only thing that remained to her.</p>

<p>Alone in the cold wet clouds, far above an unknown country, Lady
Barbara Collis breathed a little prayer as she bailed out. With the
utmost meticulosity she counted ten before she jerked the rip cord
of her chute.</p>

<p>At that same instant Fate was reaching out to gather other
threads&mdash;far flung threads&mdash;for this tiny fragment of her
tapestry.</p>

<p>Kabariga, chief of the Bangalo people of Bungalo, knelt before
Tarzan of the Apes many weary marches to the south of the Ghenzi
Mountain.</p>

<p>In Moscow, Leon Stabutch entered the office of Stalin, the
dictator of Red Russia.</p>

<p>Ignorant of the very existence of Kabariga, the black chief, or
of Leon Stabutch or Lady Barbara Collis, Lafayette Smith, A.M.,
Ph.D., Sc.D., professor of geology at the Phil Sheridan Military
Academy, boarded a steamship in the harbor of New York.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was a quiet, modest, scholarly looking young man with
horn rimmed spectacles, which he wore not because of any defect of
eyesight but in the belief that they added a certain dignity and
semblance of age to his appearance. That his spectacles were fitted
with plain glass was known only to himself and his optician.</p>

<p>Graduated from college at seventeen the young man had devoted
four additional years to acquiring further degrees, during which
time he optimistically expected the stamp of dignified maturity to
make itself evident in his face and bearing; but, to his intense
dismay, his appearance seemed quite as youthful at twenty-one as it
had at seventeen.</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith's great handicap to the immediate fulfillment of
his ambition (to occupy the chair of geology in some university of
standing) lay in his possession of the unusual combination of
brilliant intellect and retentive memory with robust health and a
splendid physique. Do what he might he could not look sufficiently
mature and scholarly to impress any college board. He tried
whiskers, but the result was humiliating; and then he conceived the
idea of horn rimmed spectacles and pared his ambition down,
temporarily, from a university to a prep school.</p>

<p>For a school year, now, he had been an instructor in an
inconspicuous western military academy, and now he was about to
achieve another of his cherished ambitions&mdash;he was going to
Africa to study the great rift valleys of the Dark Continent,
concerning the formation of which there are so many theories
propounded and acclaimed by acknowledged authorities on the subject
as to leave the layman with the impression that a fundamental
requisite to success in the science of geology is identical to that
required by weather forecasters.</p>

<p>But be that as it may, Lafayette Smith was on his way to Africa
with the financial backing of a wealthy father and the wide
experience that might be gained from a number of week-end field
excursions into the back pastures of accommodating farmers, plus
considerable ability as a tennis player and a swimmer.</p>

<p>We may leave him now, with his note books and seasickness, in
the hands of Fate, who is leading him inexorably toward sinister
situations from which no amount of geological knowledge nor
swimming nor tennis ability may extricate him.</p>

<p>When it is two hours before noon in New York it is an hour
before sunset in Moscow and so it was that as Lafayette Smith
boarded the liner in the morning, Leon Stabutch, at the same
moment, was closeted with Stalin late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"That is all," said Stalin; "you understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," replied Stabutch. "Peter Zveri shall be avenged,
and the obstacle that thwarted our plans in Africa shall be
removed."</p>

<p>"The latter is most essential," emphasized Stalin, "but do not
belittle the abilities of your obstacle. He may be, as you have
said, naught but an ape-man; but he utterly routed a well organized
Red expedition that might have accomplished much in Abyssinia and
Egypt but for his interference. And," he added, "I may tell you,
comrade, that we contemplate another attempt; but it will not be
made until we have a report from you that&mdash;the obstacle has
been removed."</p>

<p>Stabutch swelled his great chest. "Have I ever failed?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Stalin rose and laid a hand upon the other's shoulder. "Red
Russia does not look to the OGPU for failures," he said. Only his
lips smiled as he spoke.</p>

<p>That same night Leon Stabutch left Moscow. He thought that he
left secretly and alone, but Fate was at his side in the
compartment of the railway carriage.</p>

<p>As Lady Barbara Collis bailed out in the clouds above the Ghenzi
range, and Lafayette Smith trod the gangplank leading aboard the
liner, and Stabutch stood before Stalin, Tarzan, with knitted
brows, looked down upon the black kneeling at his feet.</p>

<p>"Rise!" he commanded, and then; "Who are you and why have you
sought Tarzan of the Apes?"</p>

<p>"I am Kabariga, O Great Bwana," replied the black. "I am chief
of the Bangalo people of Bungalo. I come to the Great Bwana because
my people suffer much sorrow and great fear and our neighbors, who
are related to the Gallas, have told us that you are the friend of
those who suffer wrongs at the hands of bad men."</p>

<p>"And what wrongs have your people suffered?" demanded Tarzan,
"and at whose hands?"</p>

<p>"For long we lived at peace with all men," explained Kabariga;
"we did not make war upon our neighbors. We wished only to plant
and harvest in security. But one day there came into our country
from Abyssinia a band of <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> who had been driven from
their own country. They raided some of our villages, stealing our
grain, our goats and our people, and these they sold into slavery
in far countries.</p>

<p>"They do not take everything, they destroy nothing; but they do
not go away out of our country. They remain in a village they have
built in inaccessible mountains, and when they need more provisions
or slaves they come again to other villages of my people.</p>

<p>"And so they permit us to live and plant and harvest that they
may continue to take toll of us."</p>

<p>"But why do you come to me?" demanded the ape-man. "I do not
interfere among tribes beyond the boundaries of my own country,
unless they commit some depredation against my own people."</p>

<p>"I come to you, Great Bwana," replied the black chief, "because
you are a white man and these <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> are led by a white man. It
is known among all men that you are the enemy of bad white
men."</p>

<p>"That," said Tarzan, "is different. I will return with you to
your country."</p>

<p>And thus Fate, enlisting the services of the black chief,
Kabariga, led Tarzan of the Apes out of his own country, toward the
north. Nor did many of his own people know whither he had gone nor
why&mdash;not even little Nkima, the close friend and confidant of
the ape-man.</p>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">II.&mdash;THE LAND OF MIDIAN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ABRAHAM, the son of Abraham, stood at the foot of
the towering cliff that is the wall of the mighty crater of a long
extinct volcano. Behind and above him were the dwellings of his
people, carved from the soft volcanic ash that rose from the bottom
of the crater part way up the encircling cliffs; and clustered
about him were the men and women and children of his tribe.</p>

<p>One and all, they stood with faces raised toward the heavens,
upon each countenance reflected the particular emotion that the
occasion evoked&mdash;wonder, questioning, fear, and always rapt,
tense listening, for from the low clouds hanging but a few hundred
feet above the rim of the great crater, the floor of which
stretched away for fully five miles to its opposite side, came a
strange, ominous droning sound, the like of which not one of them
had ever heard before.</p>

<p>The sound grew in volume until it seemed to hover just above
them, filling all the heavens with its terrifying threat; and then
it diminished gradually until it was only a suggestion of a sound
that might have been no more than a persistent memory rumbling in
their heads; and when they thought that it had gone it grew again
in volume until once more it thundered down upon them where they
stood in terror or in ecstasy, as each interpreted the significance
of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>And upon the opposite side of the crater a similar group,
actuated by identical fears and questionings, clustered about
Elija, the son of Noah.</p>

<p>In the first group a woman turned to Abraham, the son of
Abraham. "What is it, Father?" she asked. "I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Those who trust in the Lord," replied the man, "know no fear.
You have revealed the wickedness of your heresy, woman."</p>

<p>The face of the questioner blenched and now, indeed, did she
tremble. "Oh, Father, you know that I am no heretic!" she cried
piteously.</p>

<p>"Silence, Martha!" commanded Abraham. "Perhaps this is the Lord
Himself, come again to earth as was prophesied in the days of Paul,
to judge us all." His voice was high and shrill, and he trembled as
he spoke.</p>

<p>A half grown child, upon the outskirts of the assemblage, fell
to the ground, where he writhed, foaming at the mouth. A woman
screamed and fainted.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, if it is indeed Thou, Thy chosen people await to
receive Thy blessing and Thy commands," prayed Abraham; "but," he
added, "if it is not Thou, we beseech that Thou savest us whole
from harm."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is Gabriel!" suggested another of the long bearded
men.</p>

<p>"And the sound of his trump," wailed a woman&mdash;"the trump of
doom!"</p>

<p>"Silence!" shrilled Abraham, and the woman shrank back in
fear.</p>

<p>Unnoticed, the youth floundered and gasped for breath as, with
eyes set as in death, he struggled in the throes of agony; and then
another lurched and fell and he, too, writhed and foamed.</p>

<p>And now they were dropping on all sides&mdash;some in
convulsions and others in deathlike faints&mdash;until a dozen or
more sprawled upon the ground, where their pitiable condition
elicited no attention from their fellows unless a stricken one
chanced to fall against a neighbor or upon his feet, in which case
the latter merely stepped aside without vouchsafing so much as a
glance at the poor unfortunate.</p>

<p>With few exceptions those who suffered the violent strokes were
men and boys, while it was the women who merely fainted; but
whether man, woman or child, whether writhing in convulsions or
lying quietly in coma, no one paid the slightest attention to any
of them. As to whether this seeming indifference was customary, or
merely induced by the excitement and apprehension of the moment, as
they stood with eyes, ears, and minds focussed on the clouds above
them, only a closer acquaintance with these strange people may
enlighten us.</p>

<p>Once more the terrifying sound, swollen to hideous proportions,
swept toward them; it seemed to stop above them for a moment and
then&mdash;</p>

<p>Out of the clouds floated a strange apparition&mdash;a
terrifying thing&mdash;a great, white thing above, below which
there swung to and fro a tiny figure. At sight of it, dropping
gently toward them, a dozen of the watchers collapsed, frothing, in
convulsions.</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, dropped to his knees, raising his
hands in supplication toward the heavens. His people, those of them
who were still upon their feet, followed his example. From his lips
issued a torrent of strange sounds&mdash;a prayer perhaps, but if
so not in the same language as that in which he had previously
spoken to his people nor in any language known to man, and as he
prayed, his followers knelt in terrified silence.</p>

<p>Closer and closer floated the mysterious apparition until, at
length, expectant eyes recognized in the figure floating beneath
the small, white cloud the outlines of a human form.</p>

<p>A great cry arose as recognition spread&mdash;a cry that was a
mingling of terror born wail and ecstatic hosanna. Abraham was
among the last to recognize the form of the dangling figure for
what it was, or, perhaps, among the last to admit the testimony of
his eyes. When he did he toppled to the ground, his muscles
twitching and jerking his whole body into horrid contortions, his
eyes rolled upward and set as in death, his breath expelled in
painful gasps between lips flecked with foam.</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, never an Adonis, was at this moment
anything but a pretty sight; but no one seemed to notice him any
more than they had the score or more of lesser creatures who had
succumbed to the nervous excitation of the experiences of the past
half hour.</p>

<p>Some five hundred people, men, women and children, of which
thirty, perhaps, lay quietly or writhed in convulsions upon the
ground, formed the group of watchers toward which Lady Barbara
Collis gently floated. As she landed in, if the truth must be told
(and we historians are proverbially truthful, except when we are
chronicling the lives of our national heroes, or living rulers
within whose grasp we may be, or of enemy peoples with whom our
country has been at war, and upon other occasions)&mdash;but, as I
was recording, as Lady Barbara landed in an awkward sprawl within a
hundred yards of the assemblage all those who had remained standing
up to this time went down upon their knees.</p>

<p>Hastily scrambling to her feet, the girl disengaged the harness
of her parachute and stood gazing in perplexity upon the scene
about her. A quick glance had revealed the towering cliffs that
formed the encircling walls of the gigantic crater, though at the
time she did not suspect the true nature of the valley spreading
before her. It was the people who claimed her surprised
attention.</p>

<p>They were white! In the heart of Africa she had landed in the
midst of a settlement of whites. But this thought did not wholly
reassure her. There was something strange and unreal about these
prone and kneeling figures; but at least they did not appear
ferocious or unfriendly&mdash;their attitudes, in fact, were quite
the opposite, and she saw no evidence of weapons among them.</p>

<p>She approached them, and, as she did so, many of them began to
wail and press their faces against the ground, while others raised
their hands in supplication&mdash;some toward the heavens, and
others toward her.</p>

<p>She was close enough now to see their features and her heart
sank within her, for she had never conceived the existence of an
entire village of people of such unprepossessing appearance, and
Lady Barbara was one of those who are strongly impressed by
externals.</p>

<p>The men were particularly repulsive. Their long hair and beards
seemed as little acquainted with soap, water and combs as with
shears and razors.</p>

<p>There were two features that impressed her most strongly and
unfavorably&mdash;the huge noses and receding chins of practically
the entire company. The noses were so large as to constitute a
deformity, while in many of those before her, chins were almost
nonexistent.</p>

<p>And then she saw two things that had diametrically opposite
effects upon her&mdash;the score of epileptics writhing upon the
ground and a singularly beautiful, golden haired girl who had risen
from the prostrate herd and was slowly approaching her, a
questioning look in her large grey eyes.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara Collis looked the girl full in the eyes and smiled,
and when Lady Barbara smiled stone crumbled before the radiant
vision of her face&mdash;or so a poetic and enthralled admirer had
once stated in her hearing. The fact that he lisped, however, had
prejudiced her against his testimony.</p>

<p>The girl returned the smile with one almost as gorgeous, but
quickly she erased it from her features, at the same time glancing
furtively about her as though fearful that some one had detected
her in the commission of a crime; but when Lady Barbara extended
both her hands toward her, she came forward and placed her own
within the grasp of the English girl's.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" asked Lady Barbara. "What country is this? Who are
these people?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "Who are you?" she asked. "Are you an
angel that the Lord God of Hosts has sent to His chosen
people?"</p>

<p>It was now the turn of Lady Barbara to shake her head to
evidence her inability to understand the language of the other.</p>

<p>An old man with a long white beard arose and came toward them,
having seen that the apparition from Heaven had not struck the girl
dead for her temerity.</p>

<p>"Get thee gone, Jezebel!" cried the old man to the girl. "How
durst thou address this Heavenly visitor?"</p>

<p>The girl stepped back, dropping her head; and though Lady
Barbara had understood no word that the man spoke, his tone and
gesture, together with the action of the girl, told her what had
transpired between them.</p>

<p>She thought quickly. She had realized the impression that her
miraculous appearance had made upon these seemingly ignorant
people, and she guessed that their subsequent attitude toward her
would be governed largely by the impression of her first acts; and
being English, she held to the English tradition of impressing upon
lesser people the authority of her breed. It would never do,
therefore, to let this unkempt patriarch order the girl from her if
Lady Barbara chose to retain her; and, after glancing at the faces
about her, she was quite sure that if she must choose a companion
from among them the fair haired beauty would be her nominee.</p>

<p>With an imperious gesture, and a sinking heart, she stepped
forward and took the girl by the arm, and, as the latter turned a
surprised glance upon her, drew her to her side.</p>

<p>"Remain with me," she said, although she knew her words were
unintelligible to the girl.</p>

<p>"What did she say, Jezebel?" demanded the old man.</p>

<p>The girl was about to reply that she did not know, but something
stopped her. Perhaps the very strangeness of the question gave her
pause, for it must have been obvious to the old man that the
stranger spoke in a tongue unknown to him and, therefore, unknown
to any of them.</p>

<p>She thought quickly, now. Why should he ask such a question
unless he might entertain a belief that she might have understood?
She recalled the smile that the stranger had brought to her lips
without her volition, and she recalled, too, that the old man had
noted it.</p>

<p>The girl called Jezebel knew the price of a smile in the land of
Midian, where any expression of happiness is an acknowledgment of
sin; and so, being a bright girl among a people who were almost
uniformly stupid, she evolved a ready answer in the hope that it
might save her from punishment.</p>

<p>She looked the ancient one straight in the eye. "She said,
Jobab," she replied, "that she cometh from Heaven with a message
for the chosen people and that she will deliver the message through
me and through no other."</p>

<p>Now much of this statement had been suggested to Jezebel by the
remarks of the elders and the apostles as they had watched the
strange apparition descending from the clouds and had sought to
find some explanation for the phenomenon. In fact, Jobab himself
had volunteered the very essence of this theory and was, therefore,
the more ready to acknowledge belief in the girl's statement.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara stood with an arm about the slim shoulders of the
golden haired Jezebel, her shocked gaze encompassing the scene
before her&mdash;the degraded, unkempt people huddled stupidly
before her, the inert forms of those who had fainted, the writhing
contortions of the epileptics. With aversion she appraised the
countenance of Jobab, noting the watery eyes, the huge monstrosity
of his nose, the long, filthy beard that but half concealed his
weak chin. With difficulty she stemmed the involuntary shudder that
was her natural nervous reaction to the sight before her.</p>

<p>Jobab stood staring at her, an expression of awe on his stupid,
almost imbecile face. From the crowd behind him several other old
men approached, almost fearfully, halting just behind him. Jobab
looked back over his shoulder. "Where is Abraham, the son of
Abraham?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"He still communeth with Jehovah," replied one of the
ancients.</p>

<p>"Perhaps even now Jehovah revealeth to him the purpose of this
visitation," suggested another hopefully.</p>

<p>"She hath brought a message," said Jobab, "and she will deliver
it only through the girl called Jezebel. I wish Abraham, the son of
Abraham, was through communing with Jehovah," he added; but
Abraham, the son of Abraham, still writhed upon the ground, foaming
at the mouth.</p>

<p>"Verily," said another old man, "if this be indeed a messenger
from Jehovah let us not stand thus idly staring, lest we arouse the
anger of Jehovah, that he bring a plague upon us, even of flies or
of lice."</p>

<p>"Thou speakest true words, Timothy," agreed Jobab, and, turning
to the crowd behind them; "Get thee hence quickly and fetch
offerings that may be good in the sight of Jehovah, each in
accordance with his ability."</p>

<p>Stupidly the assemblage turned away toward the caves and hovels
that constituted the village, leaving the small knot of ancients
facing Lady Barbara and the golden Jezebel and, upon the ground,
the stricken ones, some of whom were evidencing symptoms of
recovery from their seizures.</p>

<p>Once again a feeling of revulsion gripped the English girl as
she noted the features and carriages of the villagers. Almost
without exception they were disfigured by enormous noses and chins
so small and receding that in many instances the chin seemed to be
lacking entirely. When they walked they ordinarily leaned forward,
giving the impression that they were upon the verge of pitching
headlong upon their faces.</p>

<p>Occasionally among them appeared an individual whose countenance
suggested a much higher mentality than that possessed by the
general run of the villagers, and without exception these had blond
hair, while the hair of all the others was black.</p>

<p>So striking was this phenomenon that Lady Barbara could not but
note it almost in her first brief survey of these strange
creatures, yet she was never to discover an indisputable
explanation, for there was none to tell her of Angustus and the
fair haired slave girl from some barbarian horde of the north, none
who knew that Angustus had had a large nose, a weak chin and
epilepsy, none to guess the splendid mind and the radiant health of
that little slave girl, dead now for almost nineteen centuries,
whose blood, even now, arose occasionally above the horrid
decadence of all those long years of enforced inbreeding to produce
such a creature as Jezebel in an effort, however futile, to stem
the tide of degeneracy.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara wondered now why the people had gone to their
dwellings&mdash;what did it portend? She looked at the old men who
had remained behind; but their stupid, almost imbecile faces
revealed nothing. Then she turned to the girl. How she wished that
they might understand one another. She was positive that the girl
was actively friendly, but she could not be so sure of these
others. Everything about them repelled her, and she found it
impossible to have confidence in their intentions toward her.</p>

<p>But how different was the girl! She, too, doubtless, was an
alien among them; and that fact gave the English girl hope, for she
had seen nothing to indicate that the golden haired one was being
threatened or mistreated; and at least she was alive and uninjured.
Yet, she must be of another breed. Her simple, and scant, apparel,
fabricated apparently from vegetable fiber, was clean, as were
those parts of her body exposed to view, while the garments of all
the others, especially the old men, were filthy beyond words, as
were their hair and beards and every portion of their bodies not
concealed by the mean garments that scarce half covered their
nakedness.</p>

<p>As the old men whispered among themselves, Lady Barbara turned
slowly to look about her in all directions. She saw precipitous
cliffs completely hemming a small circular valley, near the center
of which was a lake. Nowhere could she see any indication of a
break in the encircling walls that rose hundreds of feet above the
floor of the valley; and yet she felt that there must be an
entrance from the outer world, else how had these people gained
entrance?</p>

<p>Her survey suggested that the valley lay at the bottom of the
crater of a great volcano, long extinct, and if that were true the
path to the outer world must cross the summit of those lofty walls;
yet these appeared, insofar as she could see, utterly unscalable.
But how account for the presence of these people? The problem vexed
her, but she knew that it must remain unsolved until she had
determined the attitude of the villagers and discovered whether she
were to be a guest or a prisoner.</p>

<p>Now the villagers were returning, and she saw that many of them
carried articles in their hands. They came slowly, timidly nearer
her, exhorted by the ancients, until at her feet they deposited the
burdens they had carried&mdash;bowls of cooked food, raw vegetables
and fruits, fish, and pieces of the fiber cloth such as that from
which their crude garments were fabricated, the homely offerings of
a simple people.</p>

<p>As they approached her many of them displayed symptoms of great
nervousness and several sank to the ground, victims of the
convulsive paroxysms that marked the seizures to which so many of
them appeared to be subject.</p>

<p>To Lady Barbara it appeared that these simple folk were either
bringing gifts attesting their hospitality or were offering their
wares, in barter, to the stranger within their gates; nor did the
truth once occur to her at the moment&mdash;that the villagers
were, in fact, making votive offerings to one they believed the
messenger of God, or even, perhaps, a goddess in her own right.
When, after depositing their offerings at her feet, they turned and
hastened away, the simple faces of some evidencing fear caused her
to abandon the idea that the goods were offered for sale; and she
determined that, if not gifts of hospitality, they might easily be
considered as tribute to appease the wrath of a potential
enemy.</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, had regained consciousness. Slowly
he raised himself to a sitting position and looked about him. He
was very weak. He always was after these seizures. It required a
minute or two before he could collect his wits and recall the
events immediately preceding the attack. He saw the last of those
bringing offerings to Lady Barbara deposit them at her feet. He saw
the stranger. And then he recalled the strange droning that had
come out of the heavens and the apparition that he had seen
floating down toward them.</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, arose. It was Jobab, among the
ancients, who saw him first. "Hallelujah!" he exclaimed. "Abraham,
the son of Abraham, walketh no longer with Jehovah. He hath
returned to our midst. Let us pray!" Whereupon the entire
assemblage, with the exception of Lady Barbara and the girl called
Jezebel, dropped to its knees. Among them, Abraham, the son of
Abraham, moved slowly, as though in a trance, toward the stranger,
his mind still lethargic from the effects of his seizure. About him
arose a strange, weird babel as the ancients prayed aloud without
concord or harmony, interrupted by occasional cries of "Hallelujah"
and "Amen."</p>

<p>Tall and thin, with a long grey beard still flecked with foam
and saliva, his scant robe ragged and filthy, Abraham, the son of
Abraham, presented a most repulsive appearance to the eyes of the
English girl as, at last, he stopped before her.</p>

<p>Now his mind was clearing rapidly, and as he halted he seemed
then to note the presence of the girl, Jezebel, for the first time.
"What doest thou here, wanton?" he demanded. "Why are thou not upon
thy knees praying with the others?"</p>

<p>Lady Barbara was watching the two closely. She noted the stern
and accusing attitude and tones of the man, and she saw the
appealing glance that the girl cast toward her. Instantly she threw
an arm about the latter's shoulders. "Remain here!" she said, for
she feared that the man was ordering the girl to leave her.</p>

<p>If Jezebel did not understand the words of the strange, heavenly
visitor, she could not mistake the detaining gesture; and, anyway,
she did not wish to join the others in prayer. Perhaps it was only
that she might cling a few brief minutes longer to the position of
importance to which the incident had elevated her out of a lifetime
of degradation and contempt to which her strange inheritance of
beauty had condemned her.</p>

<p>And so, nerved by the pressure of the arm about her, she faced
Abraham, the son of Abraham, resolutely, although, withal, a trifle
fearfully, since who knew better than she what a terrible man
Abraham, the son of Abraham, might become when crossed by
anyone.</p>

<p>"Answer me, thou&mdash;thou&mdash;" Abraham, the son of Abraham,
could not find an epithet sufficiently excoriating to meet the
emergency.</p>

<p>"Let not thy anger blind thee to the will of Jehovah," warned
the girl.</p>

<p>"What meanest thou?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Canst thou not see that His messenger hath chosen me to be her
mouthpiece?"</p>

<p>"What sacrilege is this, woman?"</p>

<p>"It is no sacrilege," she replied sturdily. "It is the will of
Jehovah, and if thou believest me not, ask Jobab, the apostle."</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, turned to where the ancients
prayed. "Jobab!" he cried in a voice that arose above the din of
prayer.</p>

<p>Instantly the devotions ceased with a loud "Amen!" from Jobab.
The old men arose, their example being followed by those others of
the villagers who were not held earth-bound by epilepsy; and Jobab,
the apostle, approached the three who were now the goal of every
eye.</p>

<p>"What transpired while I walked with Jehovah?" demanded Abraham,
the son of Abraham.</p>

<p>"There came this messenger from heaven," replied Jobab, "and we
did her honor, and the people brought offerings, each according to
his ability, and laid them at her feet, and she did not seem
displeased&mdash;nor either did she seem pleased," he added. "And
more than this we knew not what to do."</p>

<p>"But this daughter of Satan!" cried Abraham, the son of Abraham.
"What of her?"</p>

<p>"Verily I say unto you that she speaks with the tongue of
Jehovah," replied Jobab, "for He hath chosen her to be the
mouthpiece of His messenger."</p>

<p>"Jehovah be praised," said Abraham, the son of Abraham; "the
ways of the Almighty pass understanding." He turned now to Jezebel,
but when he spoke there was a new note in his tones&mdash;a
conciliatory note&mdash;and, perhaps, not a little of fear in his
eyes. "Beseech the messenger to look upon us poor servants of
Jehovah with mercy and forgiveness; beg of her that she open her
mouth to us poor sinners and divulge her wishes. We await her
message, trembling and fearful in the knowledge of our
unworthiness."</p>

<p>Jezebel turned to Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"But wait!" cried Abraham, the son of Abraham, as a sudden
questioning doubt assailed his weak mind. "How can you converse
with her? You speak only the language of the land of Midian.
Verily, if thou canst speak with her, why may not I, the Prophet of
Paul, the son of Jehovah?"</p>

<p>Jezebel had a brain worth fifty such brains as that possessed by
the Prophet of Paul; and now she used it to advantage, though, if
the truth were known, not without some misgivings as to the outcome
of her rash proposal, for, although she had a bright and
resourceful mind, she was none the less the ignorant child of an
ignorant and superstitious people.</p>

<p>"Thou hast a tongue, Prophet," she said. "Speak thou then to the
messenger of Jehovah, and if she answers thee in the language of
the land of Midian thou canst understand her as well as I."</p>

<p>"That," said Abraham, the son of Abraham, "is scarce less than
an inspiration."</p>

<p>"A miracle!" exclaimed Jobab. "Jehovah must have put the words
in her mouth."</p>

<p>"I shall address the messenger," said the Prophet. "O angel of
light!" he cried, turning toward Lady Barbara, "look with
compassion upon an old man, upon Abraham, the son of Abraham, the
Prophet of Paul, the son of Jehovah, and deign to make known to him
the wishes of Him who sent you to us."</p>

<p>Lady Barbara shook her head. "There is something that one does
when one is embarrassed," she said. "I have read it repeatedly in
the advertising sections of American periodicals, but I haven't
that brand. However, any port in a storm," and she extracted a gold
cigarette case from a pocket of her jacket and lighted one of the
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"What did she say, Jezebel?" demanded the Prophet&mdash;"and, in
the name of Paul, what miracle is this? 'Out of his nostrils goeth
smoke' is said of the behemoth of holy writ. What can be the
meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"It is a warning," said Jezebel, "because thou didst doubt my
words."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," exclaimed Abraham, the son of Abraham, "I doubted
thee not. Tell her that I did not doubt thee, and then tell me what
she said."</p>

<p>"She said," replied Jezebel, "that Jehovah is not pleased with
thee or thy people. He is angry because thou so mistreatest
Jezebel. His anger is terrible because thou dost make her work
beyond her strength, nor give her the best food, and that thou dost
punish her when she would laugh and be happy."</p>

<p>"Tell her," said the Prophet, "that we knew not that thou wert
overworked and that we shall make amends. Tell her that we love
thee and thou shalt have the best of food. Speak to her, O Jezebel,
and ask if she has further commands for her poor servants."</p>

<p>Jezebel looked into the eyes of the English girl, and upon her
countenance rested an expression of angelic guilelessness, while
from her lips issued a stream of meaningless jargon which was as
unintelligible to Jezebel as to Lady Barbara or the listening
villagers of the land of Midian.</p>

<p>"My dear child," said Lady Barbara when Jezebel eventually
achieved a period, "what you say is as Greek to me, but you are
very beautiful and your voice is musical. I am sorry that you can
understand me no better than I understand you."</p>

<p>"What saith she?" demanded Abraham, the son of Abraham.</p>

<p>"She saith that she is tired and hungry and that she wisheth the
offerings brought by the people to be taken to a cave&mdash;a clean
cave&mdash;and that I accompany her and that she be left in peace,
as she is tired and would rest; and she wisheth no one but Jezebel
to be with her."</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, turned to Jobab. "Send women to
make clean the cave next to mine," he commanded, "and have others
carry the offerings to the cave, as well as clean grasses for a
bed."</p>

<p>"For two beds," Jezebel corrected him.</p>

<p>"Yea, even for two beds," agreed the Prophet, hastily.</p>

<p>And so Lady Barbara and Jezebel were installed in a
well-renovated cave near the bottom of the cliff, with food enough
to feed a numerous company. The English girl stood at the entrance
to her strange, new abode looking out across the valley as she
sought to evolve some plan whereby she might get word of her
predicament and her whereabouts to the outside world. In another
twenty-four hours she knew the apprehension of her friends and her
family would be aroused and soon many an English plane would be
roaring over the Cape to Cairo route in search of her, and, as she
pondered her unfortunate situation, the girl called Jezebel lay in
luxurious idleness upon her bed of fresh grasses and ate from a
pile of fruit near her head, the while a happy smile of contentment
illumed her lovely countenance.</p>

<p>The shadows of night were already falling, and Lady Barbara
turned back into the cave with but a single practical idea evolved
from all her thinking&mdash;that she must find the means to
communicate with these people, nor could she escape the conviction
that only by learning their language might this be
accomplished.</p>

<p>As darkness came and chill night air replaced the heat of the
day, Jezebel kindled a fire at the mouth of the cave. Near it the
two girls sat upon a soft cushion of grass, the firelight playing
upon their faces, and there the Lady Barbara commenced the long and
tedious task of mastering a new language. The first step consisted
in making Jezebel understand what she desired to accomplish, but
she was agreeably astonished at the celerity with which the girl
grasped the idea. Soon she was pointing to various objects, calling
them by their English names and Jezebel was naming them in the
language of the land of Midian.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara would repeat the word in the Midian language
several times until she had mastered the pronunciation, and she
noticed that, similarly, Jezebel was repeating its English
equivalent. Thus was Jezebel acquiring an English vocabulary while
she taught the Midian to her guest.</p>

<p>An hour passed while they occupied their time with their task.
The village lay quiet about them. Faintly, from the distant lake,
came the subdued chorus of the frogs. Occasionally a goat bleated
somewhere out in the darkness. Far away, upon the opposite side of
the valley, shone tiny, flickering lights&mdash;the cooking fires
of another village, thought Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>A man, bearing a lighted torch, appeared suddenly, coming from a
nearby cave. In low, monotonous tones he voiced a chant. Another
man, another torch, another voice joined him. And then came others
until a procession wound down toward the level ground below the
caves.</p>

<p>Gradually the voices rose. A child screamed. Lady Barbara saw it
now&mdash;a small child being dragged along by an old man.</p>

<p>Now the procession encircled a large boulder and halted, but the
chanting did not cease; nor did the screaming of the child. Tall
among the others Lady Barbara recognized the figure of the man who
had last interrogated her. Abraham, the son of Abraham, the
Prophet, stood behind the boulder that rose waist high in front of
him. He raised his open palm and the chanting ceased. The child had
ceased to scream, but its broken sobs came clearly to the ears of
the two girls.</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, commenced to speak, his eyes raised
toward the heavens. His voice came monotonously across the little
span of darkness. His grotesque features were lighted by the
flickering torches that played as well upon the equally repulsive
faces of his congregation.</p>

<p>Unaccountably, the entire scene assumed an aspect of menace in
the eyes of the English girl. Apparently it was only the simple
religious service of a simple people and yet, to Barbara Collis,
there was something terrible about it, something that seemed
fraught with horror.</p>

<p>She glanced at Jezebel. The girl was sitting cross legged, her
elbows on her knees, her chin supported in the palms of her hands,
staring straight ahead. There was no smile now upon her lips.</p>

<p>Suddenly the air was rent by a childish scream of fear and
horror that brought the Lady Barbara's gaze back to the scene
below. She saw the child, struggling and fighting, dragged to the
top of the boulder; she saw Abraham, the son of Abraham, raise a
hand above his head; she saw the torchlight play upon a knife; and
then she turned away and hid her face in her hands.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">III.&mdash;THE "GUNNER"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DANNY "GUNNER" PATRICK stretched luxuriously in
his deck chair. He was at peace with the world&mdash;temporarily,
at least. In his clothes were 20 G. securely hidden. Beneath his
left arm pit, also securely hidden, snuggled a .45 in a specially
designed holster. "Gunner" Patrick did not expect to have to use it
for a long, long time perhaps; but it was just as well to be
prepared. "Gunner" hailed from Chicago where people in his circle
of society believe in preparedness.</p>

<p>He had never been a Big Shot, and if he had been content to
remain more or less obscure he might have gone along about his
business for some time until there arrived the allotted moment
when, like many of his late friends and acquaintances, he should be
elected to stop his quota of machine gun bullets; but Danny Patrick
was ambitious. For years he had been the right hand, and that means
the pistol hand, of a Big Shot. He had seen his patron grow
rich&mdash;"lousy rich," according to Danny's notion&mdash;and he
had become envious.</p>

<p>So Danny double-crossed the Big Shot, went over to the other
side, which, incidentally, boasted a bigger and better Big Shot,
and was a party to the hijacking of several truck loads of booze
belonging to his former employer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, on the occasion of the hijacking of the last
truck, one of his former pals in the service of the double-crossed
recognized him; and Danny, knowing that he had been recognized,
sought, quite pardonably, to eliminate this damaging evidence; but
his unwilling target eluded him and before he could rectify his
ballistic errors the police came.</p>

<p>It is true that they obligingly formed an escort to convoy the
truck safely to the warehouse of the bigger and better Big Shot,
but the witness to Danny's perfidy escaped.</p>

<p>Now Danny "Gunner" Patrick knew the temper of his erstwhile
patron&mdash;and who better? Many of the Big Shot's enemies, and
several of his friends, had Danny taken for a ride. He knew the
power of the Big Shot, and he feared him. Danny did not want to go
for a ride himself, but he knew that if he remained in dear old Chi
he would go the way of all good gunmen much too soon to suit his
plans.</p>

<p>And so, with the 20 G. that had been the price of his perfidy,
he had slipped quietly out of town; and, being wise in his day and
generation, he had also slipped quietly out of the country, another
thread to be woven into Fate's tapestry.</p>

<p>He knew that the Big Shot was slipping (that was one reason he
had deserted him); and he also knew that, sooner or later, the Big
Shot would have a grand funeral with truck loads of flowers and, at
least, a ten thousand dollar casket. So Danny would dally in
foreign climes until after the funeral.</p>

<p>Just where he would dally he did not know, for Danny was shy of
geographic lore; but he knew he was going at least as far as
England, which he also knew to be somewhere in London.</p>

<p>So now he lolled in the sun, at peace with the world that
immediately surrounded him; or almost at peace, for there rankled
in his youthful breast various snubs that had been aimed in his
direction by the few fellow passengers he had accosted. Danny was
at a loss to understand why he was <i>persona non grata</i>. He was
good looking. His clothes had been designed by one of Chicago's
most exclusive tailors&mdash;they were quiet and in good taste.
These things Danny knew, and he also knew that no one aboard ship
had any inkling of his profession. Why then, after a few minutes
conversation, did they invariably lose interest in him and
thereafter look through him as though he did not exist? The
"Gunner" was both puzzled and peeved.</p>

<p>It was the third day out, and Danny was already fed up on ocean
travel. He almost wished that he were back in Chicago where he knew
he could find congenial spirits with whom to foregather, but not
quite. Better a temporary isolalion above ground than a permanent
one below.</p>

<p>A young man whom he had not before noticed among the passengers
came and sat down in the chair next to his. He looked over at Danny
and smiled. "Good morning," he said. "Lovely weather we're
having."</p>

<p>Danny's cold, blue eyes surveyed the stranger. "Are we?" he
replied in a tone as cold as his gaze; then he resumed his previous
occupation of staring out across the rail at the illimitable
expanse of rolling sea.</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith smiled, opened a book, settled himself more
comfortably in his chair and proceeded to forget all about his
discourteous neighbor.</p>

<p>Later that day Danny saw the young man at the swimming pool and
was impressed by one of the few things that Danny could really
understand&mdash;proficiency in a physical sport. The young man far
outshone the other passengers both in swimming and diving, and his
sun bronzed body evidenced long hours in a bathing suit.</p>

<p>The following morning when Danny came on deck he found that the
young man had preceded him. "Good morning," said Danny pleasantly
as he dropped into his chair. "Nice morning."</p>

<p>The young man looked up from his book. "Is it?" he asked and let
his eyes fall again to the printed page.</p>

<p>Danny laughed. "Right back at me, eh?" he exclaimed. "You see I
thought youse was one of them high hat guys. Then I seen you in the
tank. You sure can dive, buddy."</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith, A.M., Ph.D., Sc.D., let his book drop slowly to
his lap as he turned to survey his neighbor. Presently a smile
stole across his face&mdash;a good natured, friendly smile.
"Thanks," he said. "You see it is because I like it so well. A
fellow who's spent as much time at it as I have ever since I was a
little shaver would have to be an awful dub not to be fairly
proficient."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Danny. "It's your racket, I suppose."</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith looked about the deck around his chair. He
thought, at first, that Danny was referring to a tennis racket, as
that would be the thing that the word would connote to the mind of
so ardent a tennis enthusiast as he. Then he caught the intended
meaning and smiled. "I am not a professional swimmer, if that is
what you mean," he said.</p>

<p>"Pleasure trip?" inquired Danny.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope it will be," replied the other, "but it is largely
what might be called a business trip, too. Scientific
investigation. I am a geologist."</p>

<p>"Yeah? I never heard of that racket before."</p>

<p>"It is not exactly a racket," said Smith. "There is not enough
money in it to raise it to the importance and dignity of a
racket."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I know a lot of little rackets that pay
good&mdash;especially if a fellow goes it alone and doesn't have to
split with a mob. Going to England?"</p>

<p>"I shall be in London a couple of days only," replied Smith.</p>

<p>"I thought maybe you was goin' to England."</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith looked puzzled. "I am," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're goin' there from London?"</p>

<p>Was the young man trying to kid him? Very good! "Yes," he said,
"if I can get permission from King George to do so I shall visit
England while I am in London."</p>

<p>"Say, does that guy live in England? He's the fellow Big Bill
was goin' to punch in the snout. Geeze, but there is one big bag of
hot wind."</p>

<p>"Who, King George?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know him&mdash;I mean Thompson."</p>

<p>"I don't know either of them," admitted Smith; "but I've heard
of King George."</p>

<p>"You ain't never heard of Big Bill Thompson, mayor of
Chicago?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but there are so many Thompson's&mdash;I didn't know
to which one you referred."</p>

<p>"Do you have to get next to King George to get to England?"
demanded Danny, and something in the earnestness of his tone
assured Smith that the young man had not been kidding him.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "You see London is the capital of England.
When you are in London you are, of course, in England."</p>

<p>"Geeze!" exclaimed Danny. "I sure was all wet, wasn't I; but you
see," he added confidentially, "I ain't never been out of America
before."</p>

<p>"Are you making a protracted stay in England?"</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"Are you going to remain in England for some time?"</p>

<p>"I'll see how I like it," replied Danny.</p>

<p>"I think you'll like London," Smith told him.</p>

<p>"I don't have to stay there," Danny confided; "I can go where I
please. Where are you goin'?"</p>

<p>"To Africa."</p>

<p>"What sort of a burgh is it? I don't think I'd like bein' bossed
by a lot of savages, though a lot of 'em is regular, at that. I
knew some negro cops in Chi that never looked to frame a guy."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be bothered by any policeman where I'm going,"
Smith assured him; "there are none."</p>

<p>"Geeze! You don't say? But get me right, mister, I ain't worried
about no cops&mdash;they ain't got nothin' on me. Though I sure
would like to go somewhere where I wouldn't never see none of their
ugly mugs. You know, mister," he added confidentially, "I just
can't like a cop."</p>

<p>This young man puzzled Lafayette Smith the while he amused him.
Being a scholar, and having pursued scholarly ways in a quiet
university town, Smith was only aware of the strange underworld of
America's great cities to such a sketchy extent as might result
from a cursory and disinterested perusal of the daily press. He
could not catalog his new acquaintance by any first hand knowledge.
He had never talked with exactly such a type before. Outwardly, the
young man might be the undergraduate son of a cultured family, but
when he spoke one had to revise this first impression.</p>

<p>"Say," exclaimed Danny, after a short silence; "I know about
this here Africa, now. I seen a moving pitcher once&mdash;lions and
elephants and a lot of foolish lookin' deer with funny monickers.
So that's where you're goin'? Huntin', I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not for animals, but for rocks," explained Smith.</p>

<p>"Geeze! Who ain't huntin' for rocks?" demanded Danny, "I know
guys would croak their best friends for a rock."</p>

<p>"Not the sort I'm going to look for," Smith assured him.</p>

<p>"You don't mean diamonds then?"</p>

<p>"No, just rock formations that will teach me more about the
structure of the earth."</p>

<p>"And you can't cash in on them after you find them?"</p>

<p>"Geeze, that's a funny racket. You know a lot about this here
Africa, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Only what I've read in books," replied Smith.</p>

<p>"I had a book once," said Danny, with almost a verbal
swagger.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Smith politely. "Was it about Africa?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I never read it. Say, I been thinkin'," he added.
"Why don't I go to this here Africa? That pitcher I seen looked
like they wasn't many people there, and I sure would like to get
away from people for a while&mdash;I'm fed up on 'em. How big a
place is Africa?"</p>

<p>"Almost four times as large as the United States."</p>

<p>"Geeze! An' no cops?"</p>

<p>"Not where I'm going, nor very many people. Perhaps I shall see
no one but the members of my safari for weeks at a time."</p>

<p>"Safari?"</p>

<p>"My people&mdash;porters, soldiers, servants."</p>

<p>"Oh, your mob."</p>

<p>"It may be."</p>

<p>"What say I go with you, mister? I don't understand your racket
and I don't want to, but I won't demand no cut-in whatever it is.
Like the old dame that attended the funeral, I just want to go
along for the ride&mdash;only I'll pay my way."</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith wondered. There was something about this young
man he liked, and he certainly found him interesting as a type.
Then, too, there was an indefinable something in his manner and in
those cold, blue eyes that suggested he might be a good companion
in an emergency. Furthermore, Lafayette Smith had recently been
thinking that long weeks in the interior without the companionship
of another white man might prove intolerable. Yet he hesitated. He
knew nothing about the man. He might be a fugitive from justice. He
might be anything. Well, what of it? He had about made up his
mind.</p>

<p>"If it's expenses that's worrying you," said Danny, noting the
other's hesitation, "forget 'em. I'll pay my share and then some,
if you say so."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of that, though the trip will be
expensive&mdash;not much more for two, though, than for one."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, I don't know, but I have been assuming that five
thousand dollars should cover everything, though I may be
wrong."</p>

<p>Danny Patrick reached into his trousers' pocket and brought
forth a great roll of bills&mdash;50's and 100's. He counted out
three thousand dollars. "Here's three G. to bind the bargain," he
said, "and there's more where that came from. I ain't no piker.
I'll pay my share and part of yours, too."</p>

<p>"No," said Smith, motioning the proffered bills aside. "It is
not that. You see we don't know anything about each other. We might
not get along together."</p>

<p>"You know as much about me as I do about you," replied Danny,
"and I'm game to take a chance. Maybe the less we know the better.
Anyhow, I'm goin' to this here Africa, and if you're goin' too, we
might as well go together. It'll cut down expenses, and two white
fellows is got a better chanct than one alone. Do we stick or do we
split?"</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith laughed. Here, perhaps, was the making of an
adventure, and in his scholarly heart he had long held the secret
hope that some day he might go adventuring. "We stick," he
said.</p>

<p>"Gimme five!" exclaimed "Gunner" Patrick, extending his
hand.</p>

<p>"Five what?" asked Lafayette Smith, A.M., Ph.D., Sc.D.</p>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">IV.&mdash;GATHERING THE STRANDS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WEEKS rolled by. Trains rattled and chugged.
Steamships plowed. Black feet padded well worn trails. Three
safaris, headed by white men from far separated parts of the earth,
moved slowly along different trails that led toward the wild
fastnesses of the Ghenzis. None knew of the presence of the others,
nor were their missions in any way related.</p>

<p>From the West came Lafayette Smith and "Gunner" Patrick; from
the South, an English big game hunter, Lord Passmore; from the
East, Leon Stabutch.</p>

<p>The Russian had been having trouble with his men. They had
enlisted with enthusiasm, but their eagerness to proceed had waned
as they penetrated more deeply into strange and unknown country.
Recently they had talked with men of a village beside which they
had camped, and these men had told them terrifying tales of the
great band of <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a>, led
by a white man, that was terrorizing the country toward which they
were marching, killing and raping as they collected slaves to be
sold in the north.</p>

<p>Stabutch had halted for the noonday rest upon the southern
slopes of the foothills of the Ghenzis. To the north rose the lofty
peaks of the main range; to the south, below them, they could see
forest and jungle stretching away into the distance; about them
were rolling hills, sparsely timbered, and between the hills and
the forest an open, grassy plain where herds of antelope and zebra
could be seen grazing.</p>

<p>The Russian called his headman to him. "What's the matter with
those fellows?" he asked, nodding toward the porters, who were
gathered, squatting, in a circle, jabbering in low voices.</p>

<p>"They are afraid, Bwana," replied the black.</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?" demanded Stabutch, though he well knew.</p>

<p>"Afraid of the <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a>,
Bwana. Three more deserted last night."</p>

<p>"We didn't need them anyway," snapped Stabutch; "the loads are
getting lighter."</p>

<p>"More will run away," said the headman. "They are all
afraid."</p>

<p>"They had better be afraid of me," blustered Stabutch. "If any
more men desert I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are not afraid of you, Bwana," the headman told him,
candidly. "They are afraid of the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> and the white man who is
their chief. They do not want to be sold into slavery, far from
their own country."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you believe in that cock-and-bull story, you
black rascal," snapped Stabutch. "It's just an excuse to turn back.
They want to get home so they can loaf, the lazy dogs. And I guess
you're as bad as the rest of them. Who said you were a headman,
anyway? If you were worth a kopeck you'd straighten those fellows
out in no time; and we wouldn't have any more talk about turning
back, nor any more desertions, either."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bwana," replied the black; but what he thought was his own
business.</p>

<p>"Now, listen to me," growled Stabutch, but that to which he
would have had the headman listen was never voiced.</p>

<p>The interruption came from one of the porters, who leaped
suddenly to his feet, voicing a low cry of warning pregnant with
terror. "Look!" he cried, pointing toward the west. "The <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a>!"</p>

<p>Silhouetted against the sky, a group of mounted men had reined
in their horses upon the summit of a low hill a mile away. The
distance was too great to permit the excited watchers in the
Russian's camp to distinguish details, but the very presence of a
body of horsemen was all the assurance that the blacks needed to
convince them that it was composed of members of the <a title=
"bandit, brigand"><i>shifta</i></a> band of which they had heard
terrifying rumors that had filled their simple breasts with
steadily increasing dread during the past several days. The white
robes fluttering in the breeze at the summit of the distant hill,
the barrels of rifles and the shafts of spears that, even at a
distance, were sufficiently suggestive of their true nature to
permit of no doubt, but served to definitely crystallize the
conjectures of the members of Stabutch's safari and augment their
panic.</p>

<p>They were standing now, every eye turned toward the menace of
that bristling hill top. Suddenly one of the men ran toward the
loads that had been discarded during the noonday halt, calling
something back over his shoulder to his fellows. Instantly there
was a break for the loads.</p>

<p>"What are they doing?" cried Stabutch. "Stop them!"</p>

<p>The headman and the <a title=
"native soldiers"><i>askaris</i></a> ran quickly toward the
porters, many of whom already had shouldered their loads and were
starting on the back trail. The headman sought to stop them, but
one, a great, burly fellow, felled him with a single blow. Then
another, glancing back toward the west, voiced a shrill cry of
terror. "Look!" he cried. "They come!"</p>

<p>Those who heard him turned to see the horsemen, their robes
fluttering backward in the breeze, reining down the hillside toward
them at a gallop.</p>

<p>It was enough. As one man, porters, <a title=
"native soldiers"><i>askaris</i></a>, and the headman, they turned
and fled. Those who had shouldered loads threw them to the ground
lest their weight retard the runner's speed.</p>

<p>Stabutch was alone. For an instant he hesitated on the verge of
flight, but almost immediately he realized the futility of
attempted escape.</p>

<p>With loud yells the horsemen were bearing down upon his camp;
and presently, seeing him standing there alone, they drew rein
before him. Hard faced, villainous appearing, they presented such
an appearance of evil as might have caused the stoutest heart to
quail.</p>

<p>Their leader was addressing Stabutch in a strange tongue, but
his attitude was so definitely menacing that the Russian had little
need of knowledge of the other's language to interpret the threat
reflected in the speaker's tones and scowling face; but he
dissembled his fears and met the men with a cool equanimity that
impressed them with the thought that the stranger must be sure of
his power. Perhaps he was but the advance guard of a larger body of
white men!</p>

<p>The <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> looked about
them uneasily as this thought was voiced by one of their number,
for they well knew the temper and the arms of white men and feared
both. Yet, notwithstanding their doubts, they could still
appreciate the booty of the camp, as they cast covetous and
appraising eyes upon the abandoned loads of the departed porters,
most of whom were still in view as they scurried toward the
jungle.</p>

<p>Failing to make himself understood by the white man, the leader
of the <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> fell into a
heated argument with several of his henchmen and when one, sitting,
stirrup to stirrup, beside him, raised his rifle and aimed it at
Stabutch the leader struck the weapon up and berated his fellow
angrily. Then he issued several orders, with the result that, while
two of the band remained to guard Stabutch, the others dismounted
and loaded the packs on several of the horses.</p>

<p>A half hour later the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> rode back in the direction
from which they had come, taking with them all of the Russian's
belongings and him, also, disarmed and a prisoner.</p>

<p>And, as they rode away, keen grey eyes watched them from the
concealing verdure of the jungle&mdash;eyes that had been watching
every turn of events in the camp of the Russian since Stabutch had
called the halt for the disastrous noonday rest.</p>

<p>Though the distance from the jungle to the camp was
considerable, nothing had escaped the keen eyes of the watcher
reclining at ease in the fork of a great tree just at the edge of
the plain. What his mental reactions to the happenings he had
witnessed none might have guessed by any changing expression upon
his stern, emotionless countenance.</p>

<p>He watched the retreating figures of the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> until they had disappeared
from view, and then he sprang lightly to his feet and swung off
through the jungle in the opposite direction&mdash;in the direction
taken by the fleeing members of Stabutch's safari.</p>

<p>Goloba, the headman, trod fearfully the gloomy trails of the
jungle; and with him were a considerable number of the other
members of Stabutch's safari, all equally fearful lest the
<a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> pursue them.</p>

<p>The first panic of their terror had abated; and as the minutes
sped, with no sign of pursuit, they took greater heart, though
there grew in the breast of Goloba another fear to replace that
which was fading&mdash;it was the fear of the trusted lieutenant
who has deserted his bwana. It was something that Goloba would have
to explain one day, and even now he was formulating his excuse.</p>

<p>"They rode upon us, firing their rifles," he said. "There were
many of them&mdash;at least a hundred." No one disputed him. "We
fought bravely in defense of the Bwana, but we were few and could
not repulse them." He paused and looked at those walking near him.
He saw that they nodded their heads in assent. "And then I saw the
Bwana fall and so, to escape being taken and sold into slavery, we
ran away."</p>

<p>"Yes," said one walking at his side, "it is all as Goloba has
said. I myself&mdash;" but he got no further. The figure of a
bronzed white man, naked but for a loin cloth, dropped from the
foliage of the trees into the trail a dozen paces ahead of them. As
one man they halted, surprise and fear writ large upon their
faces.</p>

<p>"Which is the headman?" demanded the stranger in their own
dialect, and every eye turned upon Goloba.</p>

<p>"I am," replied the black leader.</p>

<p>"Why did you desert your bwana?"</p>

<p>Goloba was about to reply when the thought occurred to him that
here was only a single, primitively armed white without companions,
without a safari&mdash;a poor creature, indeed, in the
jungle&mdash;lower than the meanest black.</p>

<p>"Who are you, to question Goloba, the headman?" he demanded,
sneeringly. "Get out of my way," and he started forward along the
trail toward the stranger.</p>

<p>But the white man did not move. He merely spoke, in low, even
tones. "Goloba should know better," he said, "than to speak thus to
any white man."</p>

<p>The black hesitated. He was not quite sure of himself, but yet
he ventured to hold his ground. "Great bwanas do not go naked and
alone through the forests, like the low Bagesu. Where is your
safari?"</p>

<p>"Tarzan of the Apes needs no safari," replied the white man.</p>

<p>Goloba was stunned. He had never seen Tarzan of the Apes, for he
came from a country far from Tarzan's stamping ground, but he had
heard tales of the great bwana&mdash;tales that had lost nothing in
the telling.</p>

<p>"You are Tarzan?" he asked.</p>

<p>The white man nodded, and Goloba sank, fearfully, to his knees.
"Have mercy, great bwana!" he begged. "Goloba did not know."</p>

<p>"Now, answer my question," said Tarzan. "Why did you desert your
bwana?"</p>

<p>"We were attacked by a band of <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a>," replied Goloba. "They rode
upon us, firing their rifles. There were at least a hundred of
them. We fought bravely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" commanded Tarzan. "I saw all that transpired. No shots
were fired. You ran away before you knew whether the horsemen were
enemies or friends. Speak now, but speak true words."</p>

<p>"We knew that they were enemies," said Goloba, "for we had been
warned by villagers, near whom we had camped, that these <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> would attack us and sell
into slavery all whom they captured."</p>

<p>"What more did the villagers tell you?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"That the <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> are
led by a white man."</p>

<p>"That is what I wished to know," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"And now may Goloba and his people go?" asked the black. "We
fear that the <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> may
be pursuing us."</p>

<p>"They are not," Tarzan assured him. "I saw them ride away toward
the west, taking your bwana with them. It is of him I would know
more. Who is he? What does he here?"</p>

<p>"He is from a country far in the north," replied Goloba. "He
called it 'Russa.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tarzan. "I know the country. Why did he come
here?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Goloba. "It was not to hunt. He did not
hunt, except for food."</p>

<p>"Did he speak ever of Tarzan?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Goloba. "Often he asked about Tarzan. At every
village he asked when they had seen Tarzan and where he was; but
none knew."</p>

<p>"That is all," said the ape-man. "You may go."</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">V.&mdash;WHEN THE LION CHARGED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LORD PASSMORE was camped in a natural clearing on
the bank of a small river a few miles south of the jungle's
northern fringe. His stalwart porters and <a title=
"native soldiers"><i>askaris</i></a> squatted over their cooking
fires laughing and joking among themselves. It was two hours past
sunset; and Lord Passmore, faultlessly attired in dinner clothes,
was dining, his native boy, standing behind his chair, ready to
anticipate his every need.</p>

<p>A tall, well built Negro approached the fly beneath which Lord
Passmore's camp table had been placed. "You sent for me, bwana?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Lord Passmore glanced up into the intelligent eyes of the
handsome black. There was just the faintest shadow of a smile
lurking about the corners of the patrician mouth of the white man.
"Have you anything to report?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, bwana," replied the black. "Neither to the east nor to the
west were there signs of game. Perhaps the bwana had better
luck."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Passmore, "I was more fortunate. To the north I
saw signs of game. Tomorrow, perhaps, we shall have better hunting.
Tomorrow I shall&mdash;" He broke off abruptly. Both men were
suddenly alert, straining their ears to a faint sound that rose
above the nocturnal voices of the jungle for a few brief
seconds.</p>

<p>The black looked questioningly at his master. "You heard it,
bwana?" he asked. The white nodded. "What was it, bwana?"</p>

<p>"It sounded deucedly like a machine gun," replied Passmore. "It
came from south of us; but who the devil would be firing a machine
gun here? and why at night?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, bwana," replied the headman. "Shall I go and
find out?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Englishman. "Perhaps tomorrow. We shall see. Go
now, and get your sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes, bwana; good night."</p>

<p>"Good night&mdash;and warn the <a title=
"native soldier"><i>askari</i></a> on sentry duty to be
watchful."</p>

<p>"Yes, bwana." The black bowed very low and backed from beneath
the fly. Then he moved silently away, the flickering flames of the
cook fires reflecting golden high lights from his smooth brown
skin, beneath which played the mighty muscles of a giant.</p>

<hr>

<p>"This," remarked "Gunner" Patrick, "is the life. I ain't seen a
cop for weeks."</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith smiled. "If cops are the only things you fear,
Danny, your mind and your nerves can be at rest for several weeks
more."</p>

<p>"What give you the idea I was afraid of cops?" demanded Danny.
"I ain't never seen the cop I was afraid of. They're a bunch of
punks. Anyhow, they ain't got nothin' on me. What a guy's got to
look out for though is they might frame a guy. But, geeze, out here
a guy don't have to worry about nothin'." He settled back easily in
his camp chair and exhaled a slowly spiraling column of cigarette
smoke that rose lazily in the soft night air of the jungle.
"Geeze," he remarked after a brief silence, "I didn't know a guy
could feel so peaceful. Say, do you know this is the first time in
years I ain't packed a rod?"</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"A rod, iron, a gat&mdash;you know&mdash;a gun."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so in the first place?" laughed Smith. "Why
don't you try talking English once in a while?"</p>

<p>"Geeze!" exclaimed Danny. "You're a great guy to talk about a
guy talkin' English. What's that you pulled on me the other day
when we was crossin' that open rollin' country? I learned that by
heart&mdash;'a country of low relief in an advanced stage of mature
dissection'&mdash;an' you talk about me talkin' English! You and
your thrust faults and escarpments, your calderas and
solfataras&mdash;geeze!"</p>

<p>"Well, you're learning, Danny."</p>

<p>"Learnin' what? Every racket has its own lingo. What good is
your line to me? But every guy wants to know what a rod is&mdash;if
he knows what's good for his health."</p>

<p>"From what Ogonyo tells me it may be just as well to continue
'packing your rod,'" said Smith.</p>

<p>"How come?"</p>

<p>"He says we're getting into lion country. We may even find them
near here. They don't often frequent jungles, but we're only about
a day's march to more open terrain."</p>

<p>"Whatever that is. Talk English. Geeze! What was that?" A series
of coughing grunts rose from somewhere in the solid black wall of
jungle that surrounded the camp, to be followed by a thunderous
roar that shook the earth.</p>

<p>"Simba!" cried one of the blacks, and immediately a half dozen
men hastened to add fuel to the fires.</p>

<p>"Gunner" Patrick leaped to his feet and ran into the tent,
emerging a moment later with a Thompson submachine gun. "T'ell with
a rod," he said. "When I get that baby on the spot I want a
typewriter."</p>

<p>"Are you going to take him for a ride?" inquired Lafayette
Smith, whose education had progressed noticeably in the weeks he
had spent in the society of Danny "Gunner" Patrick.</p>

<p>"No," admitted Danny, "unless he tries to muscle in on my
racket."</p>

<p>Once again the rumbling roar of the lion shattered the quiet of
the outer darkness. This time it sounded so close that both men
started nervously.</p>

<p>"He appears to be harboring the thought," commented Smith.</p>

<p>"What thought?" demanded the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"About muscling in."</p>

<p>"The smokes got the same hunch," said Danny. "Look at 'em."</p>

<p>The porters were palpably terrified and were huddled close to
the fires, the <a title="native soldiers"><i>askaris</i></a>
fingering the triggers of their rifles. The "Gunner" walked over to
where they stood straining their eyes out into the impenetrable
darkness.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" he asked Ogonyo, the headman. "Have you seen
him?"</p>

<p>"Over there," said Ogonyo. "It looks like something moving over
there, bwana."</p>

<p>Danny peered into the darkness. He could see nothing, but now he
thought he heard a rustling of foliage beyond the fires. He dropped
to one knee and aimed the machine gun in the direction of the
sound. There was a burst of flame and the sudden rat-a-tat-tat of
the weapon as he squeezed the trigger. For a moment the ringing
ears of the watchers heard nothing, and then, as their auditory
nerves returned to normal, to the keenest ears among them came the
sound of crashing among the bushes, diminishing in the
distance.</p>

<p>"I guess I nicked him," said Danny to Smith, who had walked over
and was standing behind him.</p>

<p>"You didn't kill him," said Smith. "You must have wounded
him."</p>

<p>"Simba is not wounded, bwana," said Ogonyo.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" demanded Danny. "You can't see nothin' out
there."</p>

<p>"If you had wounded him he would have charged," explained the
headman. "He ran away. It was the noise that frightened him."</p>

<p>"Do you think he will come back?" asked Smith.</p>

<p>"I do not know, bwana," replied the negro. "No one knows what
Simba will do."</p>

<p>"Of course he won't come back," said Danny. "The old typewriter
scared him stiff. I'm goin' to turn in."</p>

<p>Numa, the lion, was old and hungry. He had been hunting in the
open country; but his muscles, while still mighty, were not what
they had been in his prime. When he reared to seize Pacco, the
zebra, or Wappi, the antelope, he was always just a trifle slower
than he had been in the past; and his prey eluded him. So Numa, the
lion, had wandered into the jungle where the scent of man had
attracted him to the camp. The beast fires of the blacks blinded
him; but, beyond them, his still keen scent told him there was
flesh and blood, and Numa, the lion, was ravenous.</p>

<p>Slowly his hunger was overcoming his inherent urge to avoid the
man-things; little by little it drew him closer to the hated fires.
Crouched almost upon his belly he moved forward a few inches at a
time. In another moment he would charge&mdash;and then came the
sudden burst of flame, the shattering crash of the machine gun, the
shriek of bullets above his head.</p>

<p>The startling suddenness with which this unexpected tumult broke
the fear laden silence of the camp and the jungle snapped the taut
nerves of the great cat, and his reaction was quite as natural as
it was involuntary. Wheeling in his tracks, he bounded away into
the forest.</p>

<p>The ears of Numa, the lion, were not the only jungle ears upon
which the discord of "Gunner" Patrick's typewriter impinged, for
that seeming solitude of impenetrable darkness harbored a myriad
life. For an instant it was motionless, startled into immobility;
and then it moved on again upon the multitudinous concerns of its
varied existence. Some, concerned by the strangeness of the noise,
moved farther from the vicinity of the camp of the man-things; but
there was at least one that curiosity attracted to closer
investigation.</p>

<p>Gradually the camp was settling down for the night. The two
bwanas had retired to the seclusion of their tent. The porters had
partially overcome their nervousness, and most of them had lain
down to sleep. A few watched the beast fires near which two
<a title="native soldiers"><i>askaris</i></a> stood on guard, one
on either side of the camp.</p>

<p>Numa stood with low hung head out there, somewhere, in the
night. The tattoo of the machine gun had not appeased his appetite,
but it had added to his nervous irritability&mdash;and to his
caution. No longer did he rumble forth his coughing protests
against the emptiness of his belly as he watched the flames of the
beast fires that now fed the flood of his anger until it submerged
his fears.</p>

<p>And as the camp drifted gradually into sleep the tawny body of
the carnivore slunk slowly closer to the dancing circle of the
beast fires' light. The yellow-green eyes stared in savage fixity
at an unsuspecting <a title="native soldier"><i>askari</i></a>
leaning sleepily upon his rifle.</p>

<p>The man yawned and shifted his position. He noted the condition
of the fire. It needed new fuel, and the man turned to the pile of
branches and dead wood behind him. As he stooped to gather what he
required, his back toward the jungle, Numa charged.</p>

<p>The great lion wished to strike swiftly and silently; but
something within him, the mark of the ages of charging forebears
that had preceded him, raised a low, ominous growl in his
throat.</p>

<p>The victim heard and so did "Gunner" Patrick, lying sleepless on
his cot. As the <a title="native soldier"><i>askari</i></a> wheeled
to the menace of that awesome warning, the "Gunner" leaped to his
feet, seizing the Thompson as he sprang into the open just as Numa
rose, towering, above the black. A scream of terror burst from the
lips of the doomed man in the instant that the lion's talons buried
themselves in his shoulders. Then the giant jaws closed upon his
face.</p>
<a id="pic2" name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0601121h-images/TarzanTriumphant-02.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
<p class="caption">A scream of terror burst from the doomed
man.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The scream, fraught with the terror of utter hopelessness,
awakened the camp. Men, startled into terrified consciousness,
sprang to their feet, most of them in time to see Numa, half
carrying, half dragging his victim, bounding off into the
darkness.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" was the first to see all this and the only one to
act. Without waiting to kneel he raised the machine gun to his
shoulder. That his bullets must indubitably find the man if they
found the lion was of no moment to Danny Patrick, intimate of
sudden and violent death. He might have argued that the man was
already dead, but he did not waste a thought upon a possibility
which was, in any event, of no consequence, so do environment and
habitude warp or dull the sensibilities of man.</p>

<p>The lion was still discernible in the darkness when Danny
squeezed the trigger of his beloved typewriter, and this time he
did not miss&mdash;perhaps unfortunately, for a wounded lion is as
dangerous an engine of destruction as an all wise Providence can
create.</p>

<p>Aroused by the deafening noise of the weapon, enraged by the
wound inflicted by the single slug that entered his body,
apprehending that he was to be robbed of his prey, and bent upon
swift and savage reprisal, Numa dropped the <a title=
"native soldier"><i>askari</i></a>, wheeled about, and charged
straight for Danny Patrick.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" was kneeling, now, to take better aim. Lafayette
Smith stood just behind him, armed only with a nickel plated .32
caliber revolver that some friend had given him years before. A
great tree spread above the two men&mdash;a sanctuary that
Lafayette Smith, at least, should have sought, but his mind was not
upon flight, for, in truth, Lafayette was assailed by no fear for
his own welfare or that of his companion. He was excited, but not
afraid, since he could conceive of no disaster, in the form of man
or beast, overwhelming one under the protection of Danny Patrick
and his submachine gun. And even in the remote contingency that
they should fail, was not he, himself, adequately armed? He grasped
the grip of his shiny toy more tightly and with a renewed sensation
of security.</p>

<p>The porters, huddled in small groups, stood wide-eyed awaiting
the outcome of the event, which was accomplished in a few brief
seconds from the instant that one of Danny's slugs struck the
fleeing carnivore.</p>

<p>And now as the lion came toward him, not in bounds, but rather
in a low gliding rush of incredible speed, several things,
surprising things, occurred almost simultaneously. And if there was
the element of surprise, there was also, for Danny, at least one
cause for embarrassment.</p>

<p>As the lion had wheeled Danny had again squeezed the trigger.
The mechanism of the piece was set for a continuous discharge of
bullets as long as Danny continued to squeeze and the remainder of
the one hundred rounds in the drum lasted; but there was only a
brief spurt of fire, and then the gun jammed.</p>

<p>How may one record in slow moving words the thoughts and
happenings of a second and impart to the narration any suggestion
of the speed and action of the instant?</p>

<p>Did the "Gunner" seek, frantically, to remove the empty
cartridge that had caused the jam? Did terror enter his heart,
causing his fingers to tremble and bungle? What did Lafayette Smith
do? Or rather, what did he contemplate doing? since he had no
opportunity to do aught but stand there, a silent observer of
events. I do not know.</p>

<p>Before either could formulate a plan wherewith to meet the
emergency, a bronzed white man, naked but for a G string, dropped
from the branches of the tree above them directly into the path of
the charging lion. In the man's hand was a heavy spear, and as he
alighted silently upon the soft mold he was already braced to
receive the shock of the lion's charge upon the point of his
weapon.</p>

<p>The impact of Numa's heavy body would have hurled a lesser man
to earth; but this one kept his feet, and the well placed thrust
drove into the carnivore's chest a full two feet, while in the same
instant the man stepped aside. Numa, intercepted before the
completion of his charge, had not yet reared to seize his intended
victim. Now, surprised and thwarted by this new enemy, while the
other was almost within his grasp, he was momentarily confused; and
in that brief moment the strange man-thing leaped upon his back. A
giant arm encircled his throat, legs of steel locked around his
shrunken waist, and a stout blade was driven into his side.</p>

<p>Spellbound, Smith and Patrick and their men stood staring
incredulously at the sight before them. They saw Numa turn quickly
to seize his tormentor. They saw him leap and bound and throw
himself to the ground in an effort to dislodge his opponent. They
saw the free hand of the man repeatedly drive home the point of his
knife in the tawny side of the raging lion.</p>

<p>From the tangled mass of man and lion there issued frightful
snarls and growls, the most terrifying element of which came to the
two travelers with the discovery that these bestial sounds issued
not alone from the savage throat of the lion but from that of the
man as well.</p>

<p>The battle was brief, for the already sorely wounded animal had
received the spear thrust directly through its heart, only its
remarkable tenacity of life having permitted it to live for the few
seconds that intervened between the death blow and the
collapse.</p>

<p>As Numa slumped suddenly to his side, the man leaped clear. For
a moment he stood looking down upon the death throes of his
vanquished foe, while Smith and Patrick remained in awestruck
contemplation of the savage, primordial scene; and then he stepped
closer; and, placing one foot upon the carcass of his kill, he
raised his face to the heavens and gave tongue to a cry so hideous
that the negroes dropped to the ground in terror while the two
whites felt the hair rise upon their scalps.</p>

<p>Once again upon the jungle fell the silence and the paralysis of
momentary terror. Then faintly, from the far distance, came an
answering challenge. Somewhere out there in the black void of night
a bull ape, awakened, had answered the victory cry of his fellow.
More faintly, and from a greater distance, came the rumbling roar
of a lion.</p>

<p>The stranger stooped and seized the haft of his spear. He placed
a foot against Numa's shoulder and withdrew the weapon from the
carcass. Then he turned toward the two white men. It was the first
intimation he had given that he had been aware of their
presence.</p>

<p>"Geeze!" exclaimed "Gunner" Patrick, beyond which his vocabulary
failed to meet the situation.</p>

<p>The stranger surveyed them coolly. "Who are you?" he asked.
"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>That he spoke English was both a surprise and a relief to
Lafayette Smith. Suddenly he seemed less terrifying. "I am a
geologist," he explained. "My name is Smith&mdash;Lafayette
Smith&mdash;and my companion is Mr. Patrick. I am here to conduct
some field research work&mdash;purely a scientific expedition."</p>

<p>The stranger pointed to the machine gun. "Is that part of the
regular field equipment of a geologist?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Smith, "and I'm sure I don't know why Mr. Patrick
insisted on bringing it along."</p>

<p>"I wasn't takin' no chances in a country full of strange
characters," said the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"Say, a broad I meets on the boat tells me some of these guys
eats people."</p>

<p>"It would come in handy, perhaps, for hunting," suggested the
stranger. "A herd of antelope would make an excellent target for a
weapon of that sort."</p>

<p>"Geeze!" exclaimed the "Gunner," "wot do you think I am, Mister,
a butcher? I packs this for insurance only. It sure wasn't worth
the premium this time though," he added disgustedly; "jammed on me
right when I needed it the most. But say, you were there all right.
I gotta hand it to you. You're regular, Mister, and if I can ever
return the favor&mdash;" He made an expansive gesture that
completed the sentence and promised all that the most exacting
might demand of a reciprocatory nature.</p>

<p>The giant nodded. "Don't use it for hunting," he said, and then,
turning to Smith, "Where are you going to conduct your
research?"</p>

<p>Suddenly a comprehending light shone in the eyes of the
"Gunner," and a pained expression settled definitely upon his face.
"Geeze!" he exclaimed disgustedly to Smith. "I might have known it
was too good to be true."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Lafayette.</p>

<p>"What I said about there not bein' no cops here."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked the stranger, again.</p>

<p>"We are going to the Ghenzi Mountains now," replied Smith.</p>

<p>"Say, who the hell are you, anyhow?" demanded the "Gunner," "and
what business is it of yours where we go?"</p>

<p>The stranger ignored him and turned again toward Smith. "Be very
careful in the Ghenzi country," he said. "There is a band of slave
raiders working there at present, I understand. If your men learn
of it they may desert you."</p>

<p>"Thanks," replied Smith. "It is very kind of you to warn us. I
should like to know to whom we are indebted," but the stranger was
gone.</p>

<p>As mysteriously and silently as he had appeared, he swung again
into the tree above and disappeared. The two whites looked at one
another in amazement.</p>

<p>"Geeze," said Danny.</p>

<p>"I fully indorse your statement," said Smith.</p>

<p>"Say, Ogonyo," demanded the "Gunner," "who was that bozo? You or
any of your men know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, bwana," replied the headman, "that was Tarzan of the
Apes."</p>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6">VI.&mdash;THE WATERS OF
CHINNERETH</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LADY BARBARA COLLIS walked slowly along the dusty
path leading from the Midian village down to the lake that lay in
the bottom of the ancient crater which formed the valley of the
Land of Midian. At her right walked Abraham, the son of Abraham,
and at her left the golden haired Jezebel. Behind them came the
apostles, surrounding a young girl whose sullen countenance was
enlivened occasionally by the fearful glances she cast upon the old
men who formed her escort or her guard. Following the apostles
marched the remainder of the villagers, headed by the elders. Other
than these general divisions of the cortege, loosely observed,
there was no attempt to maintain a semblance of orderly formation.
They moved like sheep, now huddled together, now spewing beyond the
limits of the narrow path to spread out on either side, some
forging ahead for a few yards only to drop back again.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara was apprehensive. She had learned many things in
the long weeks of her virtual captivity among this strange
religious sect. Among other things she had learned their language,
and the mastery of it had opened to her inquiring mind many avenues
of information previously closed. And now she was learning, or she
believed she was, that Abraham, the son of Abraham, was nursing in
his bosom a growing skepticism of her divinity.</p>

<p>Her first night in Midian had witnessed her introduction to the
cruel customs and rites of this degenerate descendant of the
earliest Christian Church, and as she acquired a working knowledge
of the language of the land and gained an appreciation of the
exalted origin the leaders of the people attributed to her, and her
position of spokesman for their god, she had used her influence to
discourage, and even to prohibit, the more terrible and degrading
practices of their religion.</p>

<p>While recollection of the supernatural aspects of her descent
from the clouds remained clear in the weak mind of Abraham, the son
of Abraham, Lady Barbara had been successful in her campaign
against brutality; but daily association with this celestial
visitor had tended to dissipate the awe that had at first
overwhelmed the prophet of Paul, the son of Jehovah. The
interdictions of his heavenly guest were all contrary to the
desires of Abraham, the son of Abraham, and to the word of Jehovah
as it had been interpreted by the prophets beyond the memory of
man. Such were the foundations of the prophet's increasing
skepticism, nor was the changing attitude of the old man toward her
unrecognized by the English girl.</p>

<p>Today he had ignored her and was even forcing her to accompany
them and witness the proof of his apostasy. What would come next?
She had had not only ocular proof of the fanatical blood frenzy of
the terrible old man, but she had listened for hours to detailed
descriptions of orgies of frightfulness from the lips of Jezebel.
Yes, Lady Barbara Collis was apprehensive, and not without reason;
but she determined to make a last effort to reassert her waning
authority.</p>

<p>"Think well Abraham, the son of Abraham," she said to the man
walking at her side, "of the wrath of Jehovah when he sees that you
have disobeyed him."</p>

<p>"I walk in the path of the prophets," replied the old man.
"Always we have punished those who defied the laws of Jehovah, and
Jehovah has rewarded us. Why should he be wroth now? The girl must
pay the price of her iniquity."</p>

<p>"But she only smiled," argued Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"A sin in the eyes of Jehovah," replied Abraham, the son of
Abraham. "Laughter is carnal, and smiles lead to laughter, which
gives pleasure; and all pleasures are the lures of the devil. They
are wicked."</p>

<p>"Do not say any more," said Jezebel, in English. "You will only
anger him, and when he is angry he is terrible."</p>

<p>"What sayest thou, woman?" demanded Abraham, the son of
Abraham.</p>

<p>"I was praying to Jehovah in the language of Heaven," replied
the girl.</p>

<p>The Prophet let his scowling gaze rest upon her. "Thou doest
well to pray, woman. Jehovah looketh not with pleasure upon
thee."</p>

<p>"Then I shall continue praying," replied the girl meekly, and to
Lady Barbara, in English; "The old devil is already planning my
punishment. He has always hated me, just as they always hate us
poor creatures who are not created in the same image as they."</p>

<p>The remarkable difference in physical appearance and mentality
that set Jezebel apart from the other Midians was an inexplicable
phenomenon that had constantly puzzled Lady Barbara and would
continue to puzzle her, since she could not know of the little fair
haired slave girl whose virile personality still sought to express
itself beyond a grave nineteen centuries old. How greatly Jezebel's
mentality surpassed that of her imbecilic fellows had been
demonstrated to Lady Barbara by the surprising facility with which
the girl had learned to speak English while she was teaching Lady
Barbara the language of the Midians. How often and how sincerely
had she thanked a kindly Providence for Jezebel!</p>

<p>The procession had now arrived at the shore of the lake, which
legend asserted to be bottomless, and had halted where a few flat
lava rocks of great size overhung the waters. The apostles took
their places with Abraham, the son of Abraham, upon one of the
rocks, the girl in their midst; and then a half dozen younger men
came forward at a signal from Jobab. One of their number carried a
fiber net, and two others brought a heavy piece of lava. Quickly
they threw the net over the now terrified and screaming girl and
secured the lava rock to it.</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, raised his hands above his head,
and at the signal all knelt. He commenced to pray in that now
familiar gibberish that was not Midian, nor, according to Jezebel,
any language whatsoever, for she insisted that the Prophet and the
Apostles, to whose sole use it was restricted, could not understand
it themselves. The girl, kneeling, was weeping softly now,
sometimes choking down a muffled sob, while the young men held the
net securely.</p>

<p>Suddenly Abraham, the son of Abraham, abandoned the
ecclesiastical tongue and spoke in the language of his people. "For
as she has sinned so shall she suffer," he cried. "It is the will
of Jehovah, in his infinite mercy, that she shall not be consumed
by fire, but that she shall be immersed three times in the waters
of Chinnereth that her sins may be washed from her. Let us pray
that they may be not too grievous, since otherwise she shall not
survive." He nodded to the six young men, who seemed well schooled
in their parts.</p>

<p>Four of them seized the net and raised it between them, while
the remaining two held the ends of long fiber ropes that were
attached to it. As the four commenced to swing the body of the girl
pendulum like between them, her screams and pleas for mercy rose
above the silent waters of Chinnereth in a diapason of horror,
mingled with which were the shrieks and groans of those who,
excited beyond the capacity of their nervous systems, were falling
to the ground in the throes of epileptic seizures.</p>

<p>To and fro, with increasing rapidity, the young men swung their
terror crazed burden. Suddenly one of them collapsed to sink,
writhing and foaming, to the surface of the great block of lava
upon which they stood, dropping the soft body of the girl heavily
to the hard rocks. As Jobab signaled to another young man to take
the place of him who had fallen, an apostle screamed and dropped in
his tracks.</p>

<p>But no one gave heed to those who had succumbed, and a moment
later the girl was swinging to and fro out over the waters of
Chinnereth, back over the hard face of the lava.</p>

<p>"In the name of Jehovah! In the name of Jehovah!" chanted
Abraham, the son of Abraham, to the cadence of the swinging sack.
"In the name of Jehovah! In the name of his son&mdash;" there was a
pause, and as the body of the girl swung again out over the
water&mdash;"Paul!"</p>

<p>It was the signal. The four young men released their holds upon
the net, and the body of the girl shot downward toward the dark
waters of the lake. There was a splash. The screaming ceased. The
waters closed in above the victim of cruel fanaticism, leaving only
a widening circle of retreating wavelets and two fiber ropes
extending upward to the altar of castigation.</p>

<p>For a few seconds there was silence and immobility, except for
the groans and contortions of the now greatly increased numbers of
the victims of the Nemesis of the Midians. Then Abraham, the son of
Abraham, spoke again to the six executioners, who immediately laid
hold of the two ropes and hauled the girl upward until she swung,
dripping and choking, just above the surface of the water.</p>

<p>For a brief interval they held her there; and then, at a word
from the Prophet, they dropped her again beneath the waters.</p>

<p>"You murderer!" cried Lady Barbara, no longer able to control
her anger. "Order that poor creature drawn ashore before she is
drowned."</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, turned eyes upon the English girl
that almost froze her with horror&mdash;the wild, staring eyes of a
maniac; piercing pupils rimmed round with white. "Silence,
blasphemer!" screamed the man. "Last night I walked with Jehovah,
and He told me that you would be next."</p>

<p>"Oh, please," whispered Jezebel, tugging at Lady Barbara's
sleeve. "Do not anger him more or you are lost."</p>

<p>The Prophet turned again to the six young men, and again, at his
command, the victim was drawn above the surface of the lake.
Fascinated by the horror of the situation, Lady Barbara had stepped
to the edge of the rock, and, looking down, saw the poor creature
limp but still gasping in an effort to regain her breath. She was
not dead, but an other immersion must surely prove fatal.</p>

<p>"Oh, please," she begged, turning to the Prophet, "in the name
of merciful God, do not let them lower her again!"</p>

<p>Without a word of reply Abraham, the son of Abraham, gave the
signal; and for the third time the now unconscious girl was dropped
into the lake. The English girl sank to her knees in an attitude of
prayer, and raising her eyes to heaven plead fervently to her Maker
to move the heart of Abraham, the son of Abraham, to compassion, or
out of the fullness of His own love to save the victim of these
misguided creatures from what seemed now certain death. For a full
minute she had prayed, and still the girl was left beneath the
waters. Then the Prophet commanded that she be raised.</p>

<p>"If she is now pure in the eyes of Jehovah," he cried, "she will
emerge alive. If she be dead, it is the will of Jehovah. I have but
walked in the paths of the Prophets."</p>

<p>The six young men raised the sagging net to the surface of the
rocks where they rolled the limp form of the girl from it close to
where Lady Barbara kneeled in prayer. And now the Prophet appeared
to notice the attitude and the pleading voice of the English girl
for the first time.</p>

<p>"What doest thou?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I pray to a God whose power and mercy are beyond your
understanding," she replied. "I pray for the life of this poor
child."</p>

<p>"There is the answer to your prayer," sneered the Prophet
contemptuously, indicating the still body of the girl. "She is
dead, and Jehovah has revealed to all who may have doubted that
Abraham, the son of Abraham, is His prophet and that thou art an
impostor."</p>

<p>"We are lost," whispered Jezebel.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara thought as much herself; but she thought quickly,
for the emergency was critical. Rising, she faced the Prophet.
"Yes, she is dead," she replied, "but Jehovah can resurrect
her."</p>

<p>"He can, but He will not," said Abraham, the son of Abraham.</p>

<p>"Not for you, for He is angry with him who dares to call himself
His prophet and yet disobeyeth His commands." She stepped quickly
to the side of the lifeless body. "But for me He will resurrect
her. Come Jezebel and help me!"</p>

<p>Now Lady Barbara, in common with most modern, athletically
inclined young women, was familiar with the ordinary methods for
resuscitating the drowned; and she fell to work upon the victim of
the Prophet's homicidal mania with a will born not only of
compassion, but of vital necessity. She issued curt orders to
Jezebel from time to time, orders which broke but did not terminate
a constant flow of words which she voiced in chant-like measures.
She started with The Charge of the Light Brigade, but after two
stanzas her memory failed and she had recourse to Mother Goose,
snatches from the verse in Alice in Wonderland, Kipling, Omar
Khayyam; and, as the girl after ten minutes of heartbreaking effort
commenced to show signs of life, Lady Barbara closed with excerpts
from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.</p>

<p>Crowded about them were the Prophet, the Apostles, the Elders,
and the six executioners, while beyond these the villagers pressed
as close as they dared to witness the miracle if such it were to
be.</p>

<p>"'And that government of the people, by the people, and for the
people shall not perish from the earth,'" chanted Lady Barbara,
rising to her feet. "Lay the child in the net," she commanded,
turning to the wide-eyed young men who had cast her into the lake,
"and carry her tenderly back to the cave of her parents. Come
Jezebel!" To Abraham, the son of Abraham, she vouchsafed not even a
glance.</p>

<p>That night the two girls sat at the entrance of their cave
looking out across the uncharted valley of Midian. A full moon
silvered the crest of the lofty escarpment of the crater's northern
rim. In the middle distance the silent waters of Chinnereth lay
like a burnished shield.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," sighed Jezebel.</p>

<p>"But, oh, how horrible, because of man," replied Lady Barbara,
with a shudder.</p>

<p>"At night, when I am alone, and can see only the beautiful
things, I try to forget man," said the golden one. "Is there so
much cruelty and wickedness in the land from which you come,
Barbara?"</p>

<p>"There are cruelty and wickedness everywhere where men are, but
in my land it is not so bad as here where the church rules and
cruelty is the sole business of the church."</p>

<p>"They say the men over there are very cruel," said Jezebel,
pointing across the valley; "but they are beautiful&mdash;not like
our people."</p>

<p>"You have seen them?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Sometimes they come searching for their strayed goats, but
not often. Then they chase us into our caves, and we roll rocks
down on them to keep them from coming up and killing us. They steal
our goats at such times; and if they catch any of our men they kill
them, too. If I were alone I would let them catch me for they are
very beautiful, and I do not think they would kill me. I think they
would like me."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it," agreed Lady Barbara, "but if I were you I
would not let them catch me."</p>

<p>"Why not? What have I to hope for here? Perhaps some day I shall
be caught smiling or singing; and then I shall be killed, and you
have not seen all of the ways in which the Prophet can destroy
sinners. If I am not killed I shall certainly be taken to his cave
by some horrible old man; and there, all my life, I shall be a
slave to him and his other women; and the old women are more cruel
to such as I than even the men. No, if I were not afraid of what
lies between I should run away and go to the land of the North
Midians."</p>

<p>"Perhaps your life will be happier and safer here with me since
we showed Abraham, the son of Abraham, that we are more powerful
than he; and when the time comes that my people find me, or I
discover an avenue of escape, you shall come away with me, Jezebel;
though I don't know that you will be much safer in England than you
are here."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded the girl.</p>

<p>"You are too beautiful ever to have perfect safety or perfect
happiness."</p>

<p>"You think I am beautiful? I always thought so, too. I saw
myself when I looked into the lake or into a vessel of water; and I
thought that I was beautiful, although I did not look like the
other girls of the land of Midian. Yet you are beautiful and I do
not look like you. Have you never been safe or happy, Barbara?"</p>

<p>The English girl laughed. "I am not <i>too</i> beautiful,
Jezebel," she explained.</p>

<p>A footfall on the steep pathway leading to the cave caught their
attention. "Someone comes," said Jezebel.</p>

<p>"It is late," said Lady Barbara. "No one should be coming now to
our cave."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is a man from North Midian," suggested Jezebel. "Is
my hair arranged prettily?"</p>

<p>"We had better be rolling a rock into position than thinking
about our hair," said Lady Barbara, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Ah, but they are such beautiful men!" sighed Jezebel.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara drew a small knife from one of her pockets and
opened the blade. "I do not like 'beautiful' men," she said.</p>

<p>The approaching footfalls were coming slowly nearer; but the two
young women, sitting just within the entrance to their cave, could
not see the steep pathway along which the nocturnal visitor was
approaching. Presently a shadow fell across their threshold and an
instant later a tall old man stepped into view. It was Abraham, the
son of Abraham.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara rose to her feet and faced the Prophet. "What
brings you to my cave at this time of night?" she demanded. "What
is it, of such importance, that could not wait until morning? Why
do you disturb me now?"</p>

<p>For a long moment the old man stood glaring at her. "I have
walked with Jehovah in the moonlight," he said, presently; "and
Jehovah hath spoken in the ear of Abraham, the son of Abraham,
Prophet of Paul, the son of Jehovah."</p>

<p>"And thou hast come to make your peace with me as Jehovah
directed?"</p>

<p>"Such are not the commands of Jehovah," replied the Prophet.
"Rather He is wroth with thee who didst seek to deceive the Prophet
of His son."</p>

<p>"You must have been walking with someone else," snapped Lady
Barbara.</p>

<p>"Nay. I walked with Jehovah," insisted Abraham, the son of
Abraham. "Thou hast deceived me. With trickery, perhaps even with
sorcery, thou didst bring to life her who was dead by the will of
Jehovah; and Jehovah is wroth."</p>

<p>"Thou heardest my prayers, and thou witnessedst the miracle of
the resurrection," Lady Barbara reminded him. "Thinkest thou that I
am more powerful than Jehovah? It was Jehovah who raised the dead
child."</p>

<p>"Thou speakest even as Jehovah prophesied," said the Prophet.
"And He spake in my ear and commanded that I should prove thee
false, that all men might see thine iniquity."</p>

<p>"Interesting, if true," commented Lady Barbara; "but not
true."</p>

<p>"Thou darest question the word of the Prophet?" cried the man
angrily. "But tomorrow thou shalt have the opportunity to prove thy
boasts. Tomorrow Jehovah shall judge thee. Tomorrow thou shalt be
cast into the waters of Chinnereth in a weighted net, nor will
there be cords attached whereby it may be drawn above the
surface."</p>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7">VII.&mdash;THE SLAVE RAIDER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LEON STABUTCH mounted behind one of his captors,
riding to an unknown fate, was warrantably perturbed. He had been
close to death at the hands of one of the band already, and from
their appearance and their attitude toward him it was not difficult
for him to imagine that they would require but the slightest
pretext to destroy him.</p>

<p>What their intentions might be was highly problematical, though
he could conceive of but one motive which might inspire such as
they to preserve him. But if ransom were their aim he could not
conjecture any method by which these semi-savages might contact
with his friends or superiors in Russia. He was forced to admit
that his prospects appeared most discouraging.</p>

<p>The <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> were forced
to move slowly because of the packs some of their horses were
carrying since the looting of the Russian's camp. Nor could they
have ridden much more rapidly, under any circumstances, on the
trail that they entered shortly following their capture of
Stabutch.</p>

<p>Entering a narrow, rocky canyon the trail wound steeply upward
to debouch at last upon a small, level mesa, at the upper end of
which Stabutch saw what, at a distance, appeared to be a palisaded
village nestling close beneath a rocky cliff that bounded the mesa
in that direction.</p>

<p>This evidently was the destination of his captors, who were
doubtless members of the very band the mere rumor of which had
filled his men with terror. Stabutch was only sorry that the
balance of the story, postulating the existence of a white leader,
was evidently erroneous, since he would have anticipated less
difficulty in arranging the terms and collection of a ransom with a
European than with these ignorant savages.</p>

<p>As they neared the village Stabutch discovered that their
approach had been made beneath the scrutiny of lookouts posted
behind the palisade, whose heads and shoulders were now plainly
visible above the crude though substantial rampart.</p>

<p>And presently these sentries were shouting greetings and queries
to the members of the returning band as the village gate swung
slowly open and the savage horsemen entered the enclosure with
their captive, who was soon the center of a throng of men, women,
and children, curious and questioning&mdash;a savage throng of
surly blacks.</p>

<p>Although there was nothing actively menacing in the attitude of
the savages there was a definite unfriendliness in their demeanor
that cast a further gloom of apprehension upon the already
depressed spirits of the Russian; and as the cavalcade entered the
central compound, about which the huts were grouped, he experienced
a sensation of utter hopelessness.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that he saw a short, bearded white man
emerge from one of the squalid dwellings; and instantly the
depression that had seized him was, partially at least,
relieved.</p>

<p>The <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> were
dismounting, and now he was roughly dragged from the animal which
had borne him from his camp and pushed unceremoniously toward the
white man, who stood before the doorway from whence he had appeared
surveying the prisoner sullenly, while he listened to the report of
the leader of the returning band.</p>

<p>There was no smile upon the face of the bearded man as he
addressed Stabutch after the black <a title=
"bandit, brigand"><i>shifta</i></a> had completed his report. The
Russian recognized that the language employed by the stranger was
Italian, a tongue which he could neither speak nor understand, and
this he explained in Russian; but the bearded one only shrugged and
shook his head. Then Stabutch tried English.</p>

<p>"That is better," said the other brokenly. "I understand English
a little. Who are you? What was the language you first spoke to me?
From what country do you come?"</p>

<p>"I am a scientist," replied Stabutch. "I spoke to you in
Russian."</p>

<p>"Is Russia your country?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The man eyed him intently for some time, as though attempting to
read the innermost secrets of his mind, before he spoke again.
Stabutch noted the squat, powerful build of the stranger, the cruel
lips, only partially concealed by the heavy, black beard, and the
hard, crafty eyes, and guessed that he might have fared as well at
the hands of the blacks.</p>

<p>"You say you are a Russian," said the man. "Red or white?"</p>

<p>Stabutch wished that he might know how to answer this question.
He was aware that the Red Russians were not well beloved by all
peoples; and that the majority of Italians were trained to hate
them, and yet there was something in the personality of this
stranger that suggested that he might be more favorably inclined to
a Red than to a White Russian. Furthermore, to admit that he was a
Red might assure the other that a ransom could be obtained more
surely than from a White, whose organization was admittedly weak
and poverty stricken. For these reasons Stabutch decided to tell
the truth.</p>

<p>"I am a Red," he said.</p>

<p>The other considered him intently and in silence for a moment;
then he made a gesture that would have passed unnoticed by any but
a Red Communist. Leon Stabutch breathed an inaudible sigh of
relief, but his facial expression gave no indication of recognition
of this secret sign as he answered it in accordance with the ritual
of his organization, while the other watched him closely.</p>

<p>"Your name, comrade?" inquired the bearded one in an altered
tone.</p>

<p>"Leon Stabutch," replied the Russian; "and yours, comrade?"</p>

<p>"Dominic Capietro. Come, we will talk inside. I have a bottle
there wherewith we may toast the cause and become better
acquainted."</p>

<p>"Lead on, comrade," said Stabutch; "I feel the need of something
to quiet my nerves. I have had a bad few hours."</p>

<p>"I apologize for the inconvenience to which my men have put
you," replied Capietro, leading the way into the hut; "but all
shall be made right again. Be seated. As you see, I lead the simple
life; but what imperial throne may compare in grandeur with the
bosom of Mother Earth!"</p>

<p>"None, comrade," agreed Stabutch, noting the entire absence of
chairs, or even stools, that the other's speech had already
suggested and condoned. "Especially," he added, "when enjoyed
beneath a friendly roof."</p>

<p>Capietro rummaged in an old duffle bag and at last withdrew a
bottle which he uncorked and handed to Stabutch. "Golden goblets
are for royal tyrants, Comrade Stabutch," he declaimed, "but not
for such as we, eh?"</p>

<p>Stabutch raised the bottle to his lips and took a draught of the
fiery liquid, and as it burned its way to his stomach and the fumes
rose to his head the last of his fears and doubts vanished. "Tell
me now," he said, as he passed the bottle back to his host, "why I
was seized, who you are, and what is to become of me?"</p>

<p>"My headman told me that he found you alone, deserted by your
safari, and not knowing whether you were friend or enemy he brought
you here to me. You are lucky, comrade, that Dongo chanced to be in
charge of the scouting party today. Another might have killed you
first and inquired later. They are a pack of murderers and thieves,
these good men of mine. They have been oppressed by cruel masters,
they have felt the heel of the tyrant upon their necks, and their
hands are against all men. You cannot blame them.</p>

<p>"But they are good men. They serve me well. They are the man
power, I am the brains; and we divide the profits of our operations
equally&mdash;half to the man power, half to the brains," and
Capietro grinned.</p>

<p>"And your operations?" asked Stabutch.</p>

<p>Capietro scowled; then his face cleared. "You are a comrade, but
let me tell you that it is not always safe to be inquisitive."</p>

<p>Stabutch shrugged. "Tell me nothing," he said. "I do not care.
It is none of my business."</p>

<p>"Good," exclaimed the Italian, "and why you are here in Africa
is none of my business, unless you care to tell me. Let us drink
again."</p>

<p>While the conversation that ensued, punctuated by numerous
drinks, carefully eschewed personalities, the question of the
other's occupation was uppermost in the mind of each; and as the
natural effects of the liquor tended to disarm their suspicions and
urge confidence it also stimulated the curiosity of the two, each
of whom was now mellow and genial in his cups.</p>

<p>It was Capietro who broke first beneath the strain of an
overpowering curiosity. They were sitting side by side upon a
disreputably filthy rug, two empty bottles and a newly opened one
before them. "Comrade," he cried, throwing an arm about the
shoulders of the Russian affectionately, "I like you. Dominic
Capietro does not like many men. This is his motto: Like few men
and love all women," whereat he laughed loudly.</p>

<p>"Let's drink to that," suggested Stabutch, joining in the
laughter. "'Like few men and love all women.' That is the
idea!"</p>

<p>"I knew the minute I saw you that you were a man after my own
heart, comrade," continued Capietro, "and why should there be
secrets between comrades?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, why?" agreed Stabutch.</p>

<p>"So I shall tell you why I am here with this filthy band of
thieving cutthroats. I was a soldier in the Italian army. My
regiment was stationed in Eritrea. I was fomenting discord and
mutiny, as a good Communist should, when some dog of a Fascist
reported me to the commanding officer. I was arrested. Doubtless, I
should have been shot, but I escaped and made my way to Abyssinia,
where Italians are none too well liked; but when it was known that
I was a deserter I was treated well.</p>

<p>"After a while I obtained employment with a powerful <a title=
"prince, chief"><i>ras</i></a> to train his soldiers along European
lines. There I became proficient in Amharic, the official language
of the country, and also learned to speak that of the Gallas, who
constituted the bulk of the population of the principality of the
<a title="prince, chief"><i>ras</i></a> for whom I worked.
Naturally, being averse to any form of monarchistic government, I
commenced at once to instill the glorious ideals of Communism into
the breasts of the retainers of the old <a title=
"prince, chief"><i>ras</i></a>; but once again I was frustrated by
an informer, and only by chance did I escape with my life.</p>

<p>"This time, however, I succeeded in enticing a number of men to
accompany me. We stole horses and weapons from the <a title=
"prince, chief"><i>ras</i></a> and rode south where we joined a
band of <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a>, or rather,
I should say, absorbed them.</p>

<p>"This organized body of raiders and thieves made an excellent
force with which to levy tribute upon chance travelers and
caravans, but the returns were small and so we drifted down into
this remote country of the Ghenzi where we can ply a lucrative
trade in black ivory."</p>

<p>"Black ivory? I never knew there was such a thing."</p>

<p>Capietro laughed. "Two legged ivory," he explained.</p>

<p>Stabutch whistled. "Oh," he said, "I think I understand. You are
a slave raider; but where is there any market for slaves, other
than the wage slaves of capitalistic countries?"</p>

<p>"You would be surprised, comrade. There are still many markets,
including the mandates and protectorates of several highly
civilized signatories to world court conventions aimed at the
abolition of human slavery. Yes, I am a slave raider&mdash;rather a
remarkable vocation for a university graduate and the former editor
of a successful newspaper."</p>

<p>"And you prefer this?"</p>

<p>"I have no alternative, and I must live. At least I think I must
live&mdash;a most common form of rationalization. You see, my
newspaper was anti-Fascist. And now, comrade, about
yourself&mdash;what 'scientific' research is the Soviet government
undertaking in Africa?"</p>

<p>"Let us call it anthropology," replied Stabutch. "I am looking
for a man."</p>

<p>"There are many men in Africa and much nearer the coast than the
Ghenzi country. You have traveled far inland looking for a
man."</p>

<p>"The man I look for I expected to find somewhere south of the
Ghenzis," replied Stabutch.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can aid you. I know many men, at least by name and
reputation, in this part of the world," suggested the Italian.</p>

<p>Stabutch, had he been entirely sober, would have hesitated to
give this information to a total stranger, but alcohol induces
thoughtless confidences. "I search for an Englishman known as
Tarzan of the Apes," he explained.</p>

<p>Capietro's eyes narrowed. "A friend of yours?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I know of no one I would rather see," replied Stabutch.</p>

<p>"You say he is here in the Ghenzi country?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. None of the natives I have questioned knew his
whereabouts."</p>

<p>"His country is far south of the Ghenzis," said Capietro.</p>

<p>"Ah, you know of him, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Who does not? But what business have you with Tarzan of
the Apes?"</p>

<p>"I have come from Moscow to kill him," blurted Stabutch, and in
the same instant regretted his rash admission.</p>

<p>Capietro relaxed. "I am relieved," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded the Russian.</p>

<p>"I feared he was a friend of yours," explained the Italian. "In
which case we could not be friends; but if you have come to kill
him you shall have nothing but my best wishes and heartiest
support."</p>

<p>Stabutch's relief was almost a thing of substance, so
considerable and genuine was it. "You, too, have a grievance
against him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He is a constant threat against my little operations in black
ivory," replied Capietro. "I should feel much safer if he were out
of the way."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you will help me, comrade?" inquired Stabutch
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I have lost no ape-man," replied Capietro, "and if he leaves me
alone I shall never look for him. That adventure, comrade, you will
not have to share with me."</p>

<p>"But you have taken away my means of carrying out my plans. I
cannot seek Tarzan without a safari," complained Stabutch.</p>

<p>"That is right," admitted the raider; "but perhaps the mistake
of my men may be rectified. Your equipment and goods are safe. They
will be returned to you, and, as for men, who better could find
them for you than Dominic Capietro, who deals in men?"</p>

<hr>

<p>The safari of Lord Passmore moved northward, skirting the
western foothills of the Ghenzi Mountains. His stalwart porters
marched almost with the precision of trained soldiers, at least in
that proper distances were maintained and there were no stragglers.
A hundred yards in advance were three <a title=
"native soldiers"><i>askaris</i></a> and behind these came Lord
Passmore, his gun bearer, and his headman. At the head and rear of
the column of porters was a detachment of <a title=
"native soldiers"><i>askaris</i></a>&mdash;well armed, efficient
appearing men. The whole entourage suggested intelligent
organization and experienced supervision. Evidence of willingly
observed discipline was apparent, a discipline that seemed to be
respected by all with the possible exception of Isaza, Lord
Passmore's "boy," who was also his cook.</p>

<p>Isaza marched where his fancy dictated, laughing and joking with
first one and then another of the members of the safari&mdash;the
personification of good nature that pervaded the whole party and
that was constantly manifested by the laughter and singing of the
men. It was evident that Lord Passmore was an experienced African
traveler and that he knew what treatment to accord his
followers.</p>

<p>How different, indeed, this well ordered safari, from another
that struggled up the steep slopes of the Ghenzis a few miles to
the east. Here the column was strung out for fully a mile, the
<a title="native soldiers"><i>askaris</i></a> straggling along
among the porters, while the two white men whom they accompanied
forged far ahead with a single boy and a gun bearer.</p>

<p>"Geeze," remarked the "Gunner," "you sure picked on a lousy
racket! I could of stayed home and climbed up the front of the
Sherman Hotel, if I had of wanted to climb, and always been within
a spit of eats and drinks."</p>

<p>"Oh, no you couldn't," said Lafayette Smith.</p>

<p>"Why not? Who'd a stopped me?"</p>

<p>"Your friends, the cops."</p>

<p>"That's right; but don't call 'em my friends&mdash;the lousy
bums. But wherinell do you think you're going?"</p>

<p>"I think I perceive in this mountain range evidences of upthrust
by horizontal compression," replied Lafayette Smith, "and I wish to
examine the surface indications more closely than it is possible to
do from a distance. Therefore, we must go to the mountains, since
they will not come to us."</p>

<p>"And what does it get you?" demanded "Gunner" Patrick. "Not a
buck. It's a bum racket."</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith laughed good-naturedly. They were crossing a
meadowland through which a mountain stream wound. Surrounding it
was a forest. "This would make a good camp," he said, "from which
to work for a few days. You can hunt, and I'll have a look at the
formations in the vicinity. Then we'll move on."</p>

<p>"It's jake with me," replied the "Gunner." "I'm fed up on
climbing."</p>

<p>"Suppose you remain with the safari and get camp made,"
suggested Smith. "I'll go on up a little farther with my boy and
see what I can see. It's early yet."</p>

<p>"Oke," assented the "Gunner." "I'll park the mob up near them
trees. Don't get lost, and, say, you better take my protection guy
with you," he added, nodding in the direction of his gun
bearer.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to hunt," replied Smith. "I won't need him."</p>

<p>"Then take my rod here." The "Gunner" started to unbuckle his
pistol belt. "You might need it."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I have one," replied Smith, tapping his .32.</p>

<p>"Geeze, you don't call that thing a rod, do you?" demanded the
"Gunner," contemptuously.</p>

<p>"It's all I need. I'm looking for rocks, not trouble. Come on
Obambi," and he motioned his boy to follow him as he started up the
slope toward the higher mountains.</p>

<p>"Geeze," muttered the "Gunner," "I seen pipies what ain't as
much of a nut as that guy; but," he added, "he's a regular guy at
that. You can't help likin' him." Then he turned his attention to
the selection of a campsite.</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith entered the forest beyond the meadowland; and
here the going became more difficult, for the ground rose rapidly;
and the underbrush was thick. He fought his way upward, Obambi at
his heels; and at last he reached a higher elevation, where the
forest growth was much thinner because of the rocky nature of the
ground and the absence of top soil. Here he paused to examine the
formation, but only to move on again, this time at right angles to
his original direction.</p>

<p>Thus, stopping occasionally to investigate, he moved erratically
upward until he achieved the summit of a ridge from which he had a
view of miles of rugged mountains in the distance. The canyon that
lay before him, separating him from the next ridge, aroused his
interest. The formation of the opposite wall, he decided, would
bear closer investigation.</p>

<p>Obambi had flung himself to the ground when Smith halted. Obambi
appeared exhausted. He was not. He was merely disgusted. To him the
bwana was mad, quite mad. Upon no other premises could Obambi
explain the senseless climbing, with an occasional pause to examine
rocks. Obambi was positive that they might have discovered plenty
of rocks at the foot of the mountains had they but searched for
them. And then, too, this bwana did not hunt. He supposed all
bwanas came to Africa to hunt. This one, being so different, must
be mad.</p>

<p>Smith glanced at his boy. It was too bad, he thought, to make
Obambi do all this climbing unnecessarily. Certainly there was no
way in which the boy might assist him, while seeing him in a
constant state of exhaustion reacted unfavorably on Smith. Better
by far to be alone. He turned to the boy. "Go back to camp,
Obambi," he said. "I do not need you here."</p>

<p>Obambi looked at him in surprise. Now he knew the bwana was very
mad. However, it would be much more pleasant in camp than climbing
about in these mountains. He rose to his feet. "The bwana does not
need me?" he asked. "Perhaps he will need me." Obambi's conscience
was already troubling him. He knew that he should not leave his
bwana alone.</p>

<p>"No, I shan't need you, Obambi," Smith assured him. "You run
along back to camp. I'll come in pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Yes, bwana," and Obambi turned back down the mountain side.</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith clambered down into the canyon, which was deeper
than he had supposed, and then worked his way up the opposite side
that proved to be even more precipitous than it had appeared from
the summit of the ridge. However, he found so much to interest him
that he considered it well worth the effort, and so deeply absorbed
was he that he gave no heed to the passage of time.</p>

<p>It was not until he reached the top of the far side of the
canyon that he noted the diminishing light that presaged the
approach of night. Even then he was not greatly concerned; but he
realized that it would be quite dark before he could hope to
recross the canyon, and it occurred to him that by following up the
ridge on which he stood he could reach the head of the canyon where
it joined the ridge from which he had descended into it, thus
saving him a long, arduous climb and shortening the time, if not
the distance, back to camp.</p>

<p>As he trudged upward along the ridge, night fell; but still he
kept on, though now he could only grope his way slowly, nor did it
occur to him for several hours that he was hopelessly lost.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8">VIII.&mdash;THE BABOONS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A NEW day had dawned, and Africa greeted the age
old miracle of Kudu emerging from his lair behind the eastern hills
and smiled. With the exception of a few stragglers the creatures of
the night had vanished, surrendering the world to their diurnal
fellows.</p>

<p>Tongani, the baboon, perched upon his sentinel rock, surveyed
the scene and, perhaps, not without appreciation of the beauties;
for who are we to say that God touched so many countless of his
works with beauty yet gave to but one of these the power of
appreciation?</p>

<p>Below the sentinel fed the tribe of Zugash, the king; fierce
tongani shes with their balus clinging to their backs, if very
young, while others played about, imitating their elders in their
constant search for food; surly, vicious bulls; old Zugash himself,
the surliest and most vicious.</p>

<p>The keen, close-set eyes of the sentinel, constantly upon the
alert down wind, perceived something moving among the little hills
below. It was the top of a man's head. Presently the whole head
came into view; and the sentinel saw that it belonged to a
tarmangani; but as yet he sounded no alarm, for the tarmangani was
still a long way off and might not be coming in the direction of
the tribe. The sentinel would watch yet a little longer and make
sure, for it was senseless to interrupt the feeding of the tribe if
no danger threatened.</p>

<p>Now the tarmangani was in full view. Tongani wished that he
might have the evidence of his keen nose as well as his eyes; then
there would be no doubt, for, like many animals, the tonganis
preferred to submit all evidence to their sensitive nostrils before
accepting the verdict of their eyes; but the wind was in the wrong
direction.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, Tongani was puzzled, for this was such a
tarmangani as he had never before seen&mdash;a tarmangani who
walked almost as naked as Tongani himself. But for the white skin
he might have thought him a gomangani. This being a tarmangani, the
sentinel looked for the feared thunder stick; and because he saw
none he waited before giving the alarm. But presently he saw that
the creature was coming directly toward the tribe.</p>

<p>The tarmangani had long been aware of the presence of the
baboons, being down wind from them where their strong scent was
borne to his keen nostrils. Also, he had seen the sentinel at
almost the same instant that the sentinel had seen him; yet he
continued upward, swinging along in easy strides that suggested the
power and savage independence of Numa, the lion.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tongani, the baboon, sprang to his feet, uttering a
sharp bark, and instantly the tribe awoke to action, swarming up
the low cliffs at the foot of which they had been feeding. Here
they turned and faced the intruder, barking their defiance as they
ran excitedly to and fro.</p>

<p>When they saw that the creature was alone and bore no thunder
stick they were more angry than frightened, and they scolded
noisily at this interruption of their feeding. Zugash and several
of the other larger bulls even clambered part way down the cliff to
frighten him away; but in this they only succeeded in increasing
their own anger, for the tarmangani continued upward toward
them.</p>

<p>Zugash, the king, was now beside himself with rage. He stormed
and threatened. "Go away!" he barked. "I am Zugash. I kill!"</p>

<p>And now the stranger halted at the foot of the cliff and
surveyed him. "I am Tarzan of the Apes," he said. "Tarzan does not
come to the stamping grounds of the tongani to kill. He comes as a
friend."</p>

<p>Silence fell upon the tribe of Zugash; the silence of stunning
surprise. Never before had they heard either tarmangani or
gomangani speak the language of the ape-people. They had never
heard of Tarzan of the Apes, whose country was far to the south;
but nevertheless they were impressed by his ability to understand
them and speak to them. However, he was a stranger, and so Zugash
ordered him away again.</p>

<p>"Tarzan does not wish to remain with the tongani," replied the
ape-man; "he desires only to pass them in peace."</p>

<p>"Go away!" growled Zugash. "I kill. I am Zugash."</p>

<p>Tarzan swung up the cliff quite as easily as had the baboons. It
was his answer to Zugash, the king. None was there who better knew
the strength, the courage, the ferocity of the tongani than he, yet
he knew, too, that he might be in this country for some time and
that, if he were to survive, he must establish himself definitely
in the minds of all lesser creatures as one who walked without fear
and whom it was well to let alone.</p>

<p>Barking furiously, the baboons retreated; and Tarzan gained the
summit of the cliff, where he saw that the shes and balus had
scattered, many of them going farther up into the hills, while the
adult bulls remained to contest the way.</p>

<p>As Tarzan paused, just beyond the summit of the cliff, he found
himself the center of a circle of snarling bulls against the
combined strength and ferocity of which he would be helpless. To
another than himself his position might have appeared precarious
almost to the point of hopelessness; but Tarzan knew the wild
peoples of his savage world too well to expect an unprovoked
attack, or a killing for the love of killing such as only man,
among all the creatures of the world, habitually commits. Neither
was he unaware of the danger of his position should a bull, more
nervous or suspicious than his fellows, mistake Tarzan's intentions
or misinterpret some trivial act or gesture as a threat against the
safety of the tribe.</p>

<p>But he knew that only an accident might precipitate a charge and
that if he gave them no cause to attack him they would gladly let
him proceed upon his way unmolested. However, he had hoped to
achieve friendly relations with the tongani, whose knowledge of the
country and its inhabitants might prove of inestimable value to
him. Better, too, that the tribe of Zugash be allies than enemies.
And so he assayed once more to win their confidence.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Zugash," he said, addressing the bristling king
baboon, "if there be many tarmangani in your country. Tarzan hunts
for a bad tarmangani who has many gomangani with him. They are bad
men. They kill. With thunder sticks they kill. They will kill the
tongani. Tarzan has come to drive them from your country."</p>

<p>But Zugash only growled and placed the back of his head against
the ground in challenge. The other males moved restlessly sideways,
their shoulders high, their tails bent in crooked curves. Now some
of the younger bulls rested the backs of their heads upon the
ground, imitating the challenge of their king.</p>

<p>Zugash, grimacing at Tarzan, raised and lowered his brows
rapidly, exposing the white skin about his eyes. Thus did the
savage old king seek to turn the heart of his antagonist to water
by the frightfulness of his mien; but Tarzan only shrugged
indifferently and moved on again as though convinced that the
baboons would not accept his overtures of friendship.</p>

<p>Straight toward the challenging bulls that stood in his path he
walked, without haste and apparently without concern; but his eyes
were narrowed and watchful, his every sense on the alert. One bull,
stiff legged and arrogant, moved grudgingly aside; but another
stood his ground. Here, the ape-man knew the real test would come
that should decide the issue.</p>

<p>The two were close now, face to face, when suddenly there burst
from the lips of the man-beast a savage growl, and simultaneously
he charged. With an answering growl and a catlike leap the baboon
bounded aside; and Tarzan passed beyond the rim of the circle,
victor in the game of bluff which is played by every order of
living thing sufficiently advanced in the scale of intelligence to
possess an imagination.</p>

<p>Seeing that the man-thing did not follow upward after the shes
and balus, the bulls contented themselves with barking insults
after him and aiming uncomplimentary gestures at his retreating
figure; but such were not the acts that menaced safety, and the
ape-man ignored them.</p>

<p>Purposely he had turned away from the shes and their young, with
the intention of passing around them, rather than precipitate a
genuine attack by seeming to threaten them. And thus his way took
him to the edge of a shallow ravine into which, unknown either to
Tarzan or the tongani, a young mother had fled with her tiny
balu.</p>

<p>Tarzan was still in full view of the tribe of Zugash, though he
alone could see into the ravine, when suddenly three things
occurred that shattered the peace that seemed again descending upon
the scene. A vagrant air current wafted upward from the thick
verdure below him the scent of Sheeta, the panther; a baboon voiced
a scream of terror; and, looking down, the ape-man saw the young
she, her balu clinging to her back, fleeing upward toward him with
savage Sheeta in pursuit.</p>

<p>As Tarzan, reacting instantly to the necessity of the moment,
leaped downward with back thrown spear hand, the bulls of Zugash
raced forward in answer to the note of terror in the voice of the
young mother.</p>

<p>From his position above the actors in this sudden tragedy of the
wilds the ape-man could see the panther over the head of the baboon
and realizing that the beast must reach his victim before succor
could arrive he hurled his spear in the forlorn hope of stopping
the carnivore, if only for a moment.</p>

<p>The cast was one that only a practiced hand might have dared
attempt, for the danger to the baboon was almost as great as that
which threatened the panther should the aim of the ape-man not be
perfect.</p>

<p>Zugash and his bulls, bounding forward at an awkward gallop,
reached the edge of the ravine just in time to see the heavy spear
hurtle past the head of the she by a margin of inches only and bury
itself in the breast of Sheeta. Then they were down the slope, a
snarling, snapping pack, and with them went an English viscount, to
fall upon a surprised, pain-maddened panther.</p>

<p>The baboons leaped in to snap at their hereditary foe and leaped
out again, and the man-beast, as quick and agile as they, leaped
and struck with his hunting knife, while the frenzied cat lunged
this way and that, first at one tormentor and then at another.</p>

<p>Twice those powerful, raking talons reached their mark and two
bulls sprawled, torn and bloody, upon the ground; but the bronzed
hide of the ape-man ever eluded the rage of the wounded cat.</p>

<p>Short was the furious battle, ferocious the growls and snarls of
the combatants, prodigious the leaps and bounds of the excited shes
hovering in the background; and then Sheeta, rearing high upon his
hind feet, struck savagely at Tarzan and, in the same instant,
plunged to earth dead, slain by the spear point puncturing his
heart.</p>

<p>Instantly the great tarmangani, who had once been king of the
great apes, leaped close and placed a foot upon the carcass of his
kill. He raised his face toward Kudu, the sun; and from his lips
broke the horrid challenge of the bull ape that has killed.</p>

<p>For a moment silence fell upon the forest, the mountain, and the
jungle. Awed, the baboons ceased their restless movement and their
din. Tarzan stooped and drew the spear from the quivering body of
Sheeta, while the tongani watched him with a new interest.</p>

<p>Then Zugash approached. This time he did not rest the back of
his head against the ground in challenge. "The bulls of the tribe
of Zugash are the friends of Tarzan of the Apes," he said.</p>

<p>"Tarzan is the friend of the bulls of the tribe of Zugash,"
responded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"We have seen a tarmangani," said Zugash. "He has many
gomangani. There are many thunder sticks among them. They are bad.
Perhaps it is they whom Tarzan seeks."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," admitted the slayer of Sheeta. "Where are they?"</p>

<p>"They were camped where the rocks sit upon the mountain side, as
here." He nodded toward the cliff.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Tarzan again, and this time Zugash motioned along
the foothills toward the south.</p>

<h2><a name="chap9" id="chap9">IX.&mdash;THE GREAT FISSURE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE morning sun shone upon the bosom of
Chinnereth, glancing from the breeze born ripples that moved across
its surface like vast companies of soldiers passing in review with
their countless spears gleaming in the sunlight&mdash;a dazzling
aspect of beauty.</p>

<p>But to Lady Barbara Collis it connoted something quite
different&mdash;a shallow splendor concealing cruel and treacherous
depths, the real Chinnereth. She shuddered as she approached its
shore surrounded by the apostles, preceded by Abraham, the son of
Abraham, and followed by the elders and the villagers. Among them,
somewhere, she knew were the six with their great net and their
fiber ropes.</p>

<p>How alike were they all to Chinnereth, hiding their cruelty and
their treachery beneath a thin veneer of godliness! But there the
parallel terminated, for Chinnereth was beautiful. She glanced at
the faces of the men nearest her, and again she shuddered. "'So God
created man in his own image,'" she mused. "Who, then, created
these?"</p>

<p>During the long weeks that fate had held her in this land of
Midian she had often sought an explanation of the origin of this
strange race, and the deductions of her active mind had not
deviated greatly from the truth. Noting the exaggerated racial
characteristics of face and form that distinguished them from other
peoples she had seen, recalling their common tendency to epilepsy,
she had concluded that they were the inbred descendants of a common
ancestor, himself a defective and an epileptic.</p>

<p>This theory explained much; but it failed to explain Jezebel,
who insisted that she was the child of two of these creatures and
that, insofar as she knew, no new strain of blood had ever been
injected into the veins of the Midian by intermating with other
peoples. Yet, somehow, Lady Barbara knew that such a strain must
have been introduced, though she could not guess the truth nor the
antiquity of the fact that lay buried in the grave of a little
slave girl.</p>

<p>And their religion! Again she shuddered. What a hideous travesty
of the teachings of Christ! It was a confused jumble of ancient
Christianity and still more ancient Judaism, handed down by word of
mouth through a half imbecile people who had no written language; a
people who had confused Paul the Apostle with Christ the Master and
lost entirely the essence of the Master's teachings, while
interpolating hideous barbarisms of their own invention. Sometimes
she thought she saw in this exaggerated deviation a suggestion of
parallel to other so-called Christian sects of the civilized outer
world.</p>

<p>But now her train of thoughts was interrupted by the near
approach of the procession to the shore of the lake. Here was the
flat-topped lava rock of grim suggestiveness and hideous memory.
How long it seemed since she had watched the six hurl their
screaming victim from its well worn surface, and yet it had been
but yesterday. Now it was her turn. The Prophet and the Apostles
were intoning their senseless gibberish, meant to impress the
villagers with their erudition and cloak the real vacuity of their
minds, a practice not unknown to more civilized sects.</p>

<p>She was halted now upon the smooth surface of the lava, polished
by soft sandals and naked feet through the countless years that
these cruel rites had been enacted beside the waters of Chinnereth.
Again she heard the screams of yesterday's victim. But Lady Barbara
Collis had not screamed, nor would she. She would rob them of that
satisfaction at least.</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, motioned the six to the fore; and
they came, bearing their net and their cords. At their feet lay the
lava fragment that would weight the net and its contents. The
Prophet raised his hands above his head and the people kneeled. In
the forefront of their ranks Lady Barbara saw the golden haired
Jezebel; and her heart was touched, for there was anguish in the
beautiful face and tears in the lovely eyes. Here was one, at
least, who could harbor love and compassion.</p>

<p>"I have walked with Jehovah," cried Abraham, the son of Abraham,
and Lady Barbara wondered that he did not have blisters on his
feet, so often he walked with Jehovah. The levity of the conceit
brought an involuntary smile to her lips, a smile that the Prophet
noticed. "You smile," he said, angrily. "You smile when you should
scream and beg for mercy as the others do. Why do you smile?"</p>

<p>"Because I am not afraid," replied Lady Barbara, though she was
very much afraid.</p>

<p>"Why art thou not afraid, woman?" demanded the old man.</p>

<p>"I, too, have walked with Jehovah," she replied, "and He told me
to fear not, because you are a false prophet, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" thundered Abraham, the son of Abraham. "Blaspheme no
more. Jehovah shall judge you in a moment." He turned to the six.
"Into the net with her!"</p>

<p>Quickly they did his bidding; and as they commenced to swing her
body to and fro, to gain momentum against the moment that they
would release their holds and cast her into the deep lake, she
heard The Prophet reciting her iniquities that Jehovah was about to
judge in his own peculiar way. His speech was punctuated by the
screams and groans of those of the company who were seized in the
grip of the now familiar attacks to which Lady Barbara had become
so accustomed as to be almost as callous to as the Midians
themselves.</p>

<p>From her pocket the girl extracted the little pen knife that was
her only weapon and held it firmly in one hand, the blade open and
ready for the work she intended it to do. And what work was that?
Surely, she could not hope to inflict instant death upon herself
with that inadequate weapon! Yet, in the last stages of fear
induced by utter helplessness and hopelessness one may attempt
anything, even the impossible.</p>

<p>Now they were swinging her far out over Chinnereth. The Apostles
and the elders were intoning their weird chant in voices excited to
frenzy by the imminence of death, those who were not writhing upon
the rocky face of the altar in the throes of seizures.</p>

<p>Suddenly came the word from Abraham, the son of Abraham. Lady
Barbara caught her breath in a last frightened gasp. The six
released their holds. A loud scream arose from the huddled
villagers&mdash;the scream of a woman&mdash;and as she plunged
toward the dark waters Lady Barbara knew that it was the voice of
Jezebel crying out in the anguish of sorrow. Then mysterious
Chinnereth closed above her head.</p>

<p>At that very moment Lafayette Smith, A.M., Ph.D., Sc.D., was
stumbling along a rocky mountain side that walled the great crater
where lay the land of Midian and Chinnereth. He was no less aware
of the tragedy being enacted upon the opposite side of that
stupendous wall than of the fact that he was moving directly away
from the camp he was seeking. Had there been anyone there to tell
him, and had they told him, that he was hopelessly lost he would
have been inclined to dispute the statement, so positive was he
that he was taking a short cut to camp, which he imagined was but a
little distance ahead.</p>

<p>Although he had been without supper and breakfast, hunger had
not as yet caused him any annoyance, partially because of the fact
that he had had some chocolate with him, which had materially
assisted in allaying its pangs, and partially through his interest
in the geologic formations that held the attention of his scholarly
mind to the exclusion of such material considerations as hunger,
thirst, and bodily comfort. Even the question of personal safety
was relegated to the oblivion that usually engulfed all practical
issues when Lafayette Smith was immersed in the pleasant waters of
research.</p>

<p>Consequently he was unaware of the proximity of a tawny body,
nor did the fixed and penetrating gaze of a pair of cruel,
yellow-green eyes penetrate the armor of his preoccupation to
disturb that sixth sense that is popularly supposed to warn us of
unseen danger. Yet even had any premonition of threat to his life
or safety disturbed him he doubtless would have ignored it, safe in
the consciousness that he was adequately protected by the
possession of his .32 caliber, nickel plated pistol.</p>

<p>Moving northward along the lower slopes of a conical mountain,
the mind of the geologist became more and more deeply engrossed in
the rocky story that Nature had written upon the landscape, a story
so thrilling that even the thoughts of camp were forgotten; and as
he made his way farther and farther from camp a great lion stalked
in his wake.</p>

<p>What hidden urge prompted Numa thus to follow the man-thing
perhaps the great cat, himself, could not have guessed. He was not
hungry, for he had but recently finished a kill, nor was he a
man-eater, though a properly balanced combination of circumstances
might easily find the scales tipped in that direction by hunger,
inevitable and oft recurring. It may have been only curiosity, or,
again, some motive akin to that playfulness which is inherent in
all cats.</p>

<p>For an hour Numa followed the man&mdash;an hour of intense
interest for both of them&mdash;an hour that would have been
replete with far greater interest for the man, if less pleasurable,
had he shared with Numa the knowledge of their propinquity. Then
the man halted before a narrow vertical cleft in the rocky
escarpment towering above him. Here was an interesting entry in the
book of Nature! What titanic force had thus rent the solid rock of
this mighty mountain? It had its own peculiar significance, but
what was it? Perhaps elsewhere on the face of the mountain, that
here became precipitous, there would be other evidence to point the
way to a solution. Lafayette Smith looked up at the face of the
cliff towering above him, he looked ahead in the direction he had
been going; and then he looked back in the direction from which he
had come&mdash;and saw the lion.</p>

<p>For a long moment the two stared at one another. Surprise and
interest were the most definitely registered of the emotions that
the discovery engendered in the mind of the man. Suspicion and
irritability were aroused in Numa.</p>

<p>"Most interesting," thought Lafayette Smith. "A splendid
specimen;" but his interest in lions was purely academic, and his
thoughts quickly reverted to the more important phenomenon of the
crack in the mountain, which now, again, claimed his undivided
attention. From which it may be inferred that Lafayette Smith was
either an inordinately courageous man or a fool. Neither
assumption, however, would be wholly correct, especially the
latter. The truth of the matter is that Lafayette Smith suffered
from inexperience and impracticality. While he knew that a lion
was, <i>per se</i>, a threat to longevity he saw no reason why this
lion should attack him. He, Lafayette Smith, had done nothing to
offend this, or any other, lion; he was attending to his own
affairs and, like the gentleman he was, expected others, including
lions, to be equally considerate. Furthermore, he had a childlike
faith in the infallibility of his nickel plated .32 should worse
develop into worst. Therefore he ignored Numa and returned to
contemplation of the intriguing crack.</p>

<p>It was several feet wide and was apparent as far up the face of
the cliff as he could see. Also there was every indication that it
continued far below the present surface of the ground, but had been
filled by debris brought down by erosion from above. How far into
the mountain it extended he could not guess; but he hoped that it
ran back, and was open, for a great distance, in which event it
would offer a most unique means for studying the origin of this
mountain massif.</p>

<p>Therefore, with this thought uppermost in his mind, and the lion
already crowded into the dim background of his consciousness, he
entered the narrow opening of the intriguing fissure. Here he
discovered that the cleft curved gradually to the left and that it
extended upward to the surface, where it was considerably wider
than at the bottom, thus affording both light and air for the
interior.</p>

<p>Thrilled with excitement and glowing with pride in his
discovery, Lafayette clambered inward over the fallen rocks that
littered the floor of the fissure, intent now on exploring the
opening to its full extent and then working back slowly to the
entrance in a more leisurely manner, at which time he would make a
minute examination of whatever geological record Nature had
imprinted upon the walls of this majestic corridor. Hunger, thirst,
camp, and the lion were forgotten.</p>

<p>Numa, however, was no geologist. The great cleft aroused no
palpitant enthusiasm within his broad breast. It did not cause him
to forget anything, and it intrigued his interest only to the
extent of causing him to speculate on why the man-thing had entered
it. Having noted the indifferent attitude of the man, his lack of
haste, Numa could not attribute his disappearance within the maw of
the fissure to flight, of which it bore not a single earmark; and
it may be recorded here that Numa was an expert on flight. All of
his life things had been fleeing from him.</p>

<p>It had always seemed to Numa an unfair provision of Nature that
things should so almost inevitably seek to escape him, especially
those things he most coveted. There were, for example, Pacco, the
zebra, and Wappi, the antelope, the tenderest and most delicious of
his particular weaknesses, and, at the same time, the fleetest. It
would have been much simpler all around had Kota the tortoise been
endowed with the speed of Pacco and Pacco with the torpidity of
Kota.</p>

<p>But in this instance there was nothing to indicate that the
man-thing was fleeing him. Perhaps, then, there was treachery
afoot. Numa bristled. Very cautiously he approached the fissure
into which his quarry had disappeared. Numa was beginning to think
of Lafayette Smith in terms of food, now, since his long stalking
had commenced to arouse within his belly the first, faint
suggestions of hunger. He approached the cleft and looked in. The
tarmangani was not in sight. Numa was not pleased, and he evidenced
his displeasure by an angry growl.</p>

<p>A hundred yards within the fissure Lafayette Smith heard the
growl and halted abruptly. "That damn lion!" he ejaculated. "I had
forgotten all about him." It now occurred to him that this might be
the beast's lair&mdash;a most unhappy contretemps, if true. A
realization of his predicament at last supplanted the geologic
reveries that had filled his mind. But what to do? Suddenly his
faith in his trusty .32 faltered. As he recalled the appearance of
the great beast the weapon seemed less infallible, yet it still
gave him a certain sense of assurance as his fingers caressed its
grip.</p>

<p>He determined that it would not be wise to retrace his steps
toward the entrance at this time. Of course the lion might not have
entered the fissure, might not even be harboring any intention of
so doing. On the other hand, he might, in which event a return
toward the opening could prove embarrassing, if not disastrous.
Perhaps, if he waited a while, the lion would go away; and in the
meantime, he decided, it would be discreet to go still farther
along the cleft, as the lion, if it entered at all, might
conceivably not proceed to the uttermost depths of the corridor.
Further, there was the chance that he would find some sort of
sanctuary farther in&mdash;a cave, a ledge to which he could climb,
a miracle. Lafayette Smith was open to anything by this time.</p>

<p>And so he scrambled on, tearing his clothes and his flesh as
well on sharp fragments of tumbled rock, going deeper into this
remarkable corridor that seemed endless. In view of what might be
behind him he hoped that it was endless. He had shuddered regularly
to the oft recurring expectation of running into a blank wall just
beyond that portion of the gently curving fissure that lay within
his view ahead. He pictured the event. With his back to the rocky
end of the cul-de-sac he would face back down the corridor, his
pistol ready in his hand. Presently the lion would appear and
discover him.</p>

<p>At this point he had some difficulty in constructing the scene,
because he did not know just what the lion would do. Perhaps,
seeing a man, cowed by the superior gaze of the human eye, he would
turn in hasty retreat. And then again, perhaps not. Lafayette Smith
was inclined to the conclusion that he would not. But then, of
course, he had not had sufficient experience of wild animals to
permit him to pose as an authority on the subject. To be sure, upon
another occasion, while engaged in field work, he had been chased
by a cow. Yet even this experience had not been conclusive&mdash;it
had not served to definitely demonstrate the cow's ultimate
intent&mdash;for the very excellent reason that Lafayette had
attained a fence two jumps ahead of her.</p>

<p>Confused as the issue now seemed to be by his total ignorance of
leonine psychology, he was convinced that he must attempt to
visualize the expectant scene that he might be prepared for the
eventuality.</p>

<p>Forging grimly ahead over the roughly tumbled fragments, casting
an occasional glance backward, he again pictured his last stand
with his back against the corridor's rocky end. The lion was
creeping slowly toward him, but Lafayette was waiting until there
should be no chance of a miss. He was very cool. His hand was
steady as he took careful aim.</p>

<p>Here regrets interrupted the even tenor of his
musing&mdash;regrets that he had not practiced more assiduously
with his revolver. The fact that he had never discharged it
troubled him, though only vaguely, since he harbored the popular
subconscious conviction that if a firearm is pointed in the general
direction of an animate object it becomes a deadly weapon.</p>

<p>However, in this mental picture he took careful aim&mdash;the
fact that he was utilizing the front sight only giving him no
concern. He pulled the trigger. The lion staggered and almost fell.
It required a second shot to finish him, and as he sank to the
ground Lafayette Smith breathed a genuine sigh of relief. He felt
himself trembling slightly to the reaction of the nervous strain he
had been undergoing. He stopped, and, withdrawing a handkerchief
from his pocket, mopped the perspiration from his forehead, smiling
a little as he realized the pitch of excitement to which he had
aroused himself. Doubtless the lion had already forgotten him and
had gone on about his business, he soliloquized.</p>

<p>He was facing back in the direction from which he had come as
this satisfying conclusion passed through his mind; and then, a
hundred feet away, where the corridor passed from view around a
curve, the lion appeared.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X.&mdash;IN THE CLUTCHES OF THE
ENEMY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE "GUNNER" was perturbed. It was morning, and
Lafayette Smith was still missing. They had searched for him until
late the previous night, and now they were setting forth again.
Ogonyo, the headman, acting under instructions from the "Gunner"
had divided the party into pairs and, with the exception of four
men left to guard the camp, these were to search in different
directions combing the country carefully for trace of the missing
man.</p>

<p>Danny had selected Obambi as his companion, a fact which irked
the black boy considerably as he had been the target for a great
deal of angry vituperation ever since Danny had discovered, the
afternoon before, that he had left Smith alone in the
mountains.</p>

<p>"It don't make no difference what he told you, you punk," the
"Gunner" assured him, "you didn't have no business leavin' him out
there alone. Now I'm goin' to take you for a walk, and if we don't
find Lafayette you ain't never comin' back."</p>

<p>"Yes, bwana," replied Obambi, who had not even a crude idea of
what the white man was talking about. One thing, however, pleased
him immensely and that was that the bwana insisted on carrying his
own gun, leaving nothing for Obambi to carry but a light lunch and
two fifty-round drums of ammunition. Not that the nine pounds and
thirteen ounces of a Thompson submachine gun would have been an
exceptionally heavy burden, but that Obambi was always glad to be
relieved of any burden. He would have been mildly grateful for a
load reduction of even thirteen ounces.</p>

<p>The "Gunner," in attempting to determine the probable route that
Smith would have followed in his search for the camp, reasoned in
accordance with what he assumed he would have done under like
circumstances; and, knowing that Smith had been last seen well
above the camp and a little to the north of it, he decided to
search in a northerly direction along the foothills, it being
obvious that a man would come down hill rather than go farther up
in such an emergency.</p>

<p>The day was hot and by noon the "Gunner" was tired, sweating,
and disgusted. He was particularly disgusted with Africa, which, he
informed Obambi, was "a hell of a burgh."</p>

<p>"Geeze," he grumbled; "I've walked my lousy legs off, and I
ain't been no further than from The Loop to Cicero. I been six
hours, and I could of done it in twenty minutes in a taxi. Of
course they ain't got no cops in Africa, but they ain't got no
taxis either."</p>

<p>"Yes, bwana," agreed Obambi.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" growled the "Gunner."</p>

<p>They were sitting beneath the shade of a tree on a hillside,
resting and eating their lunch. A short distance below them the
hillside dropped sheer in a fifty foot cliff, a fact that was not
apparent from where they sat, any more than was the palisaded
village at the cliff's base. Nor did they see the man squatting by
a bush at the very brink of the cliff. His back was toward them,
as, from the concealment of the bush, he gazed down upon the
village below.</p>

<p>Here, the watcher believed, was the man he sought; but he wished
to make sure, which might require days of watching. Time, however,
meant little or nothing to Tarzan&mdash;no more than it did to any
other jungle beast. He would come back often to this vantage spot
and watch. Sooner or later he would discover the truth or falsity
of his suspicion that one of the white men he saw in the village
below was the slave raider for whom he had come north. And so, like
a great lion, the ape-man crouched, watching his quarry.</p>

<p>Below him Dominic Capietro and Leon Stabutch lolled in the shade
of a tree outside the hut of the raider, while a half dozen slave
girls waited upon them as they leisurely ate their belated
breakfast.</p>

<p>A couple of fiery liquid bracers had stimulated their jaded
spirits, which had been at low ebb after their awakening following
their debauch of the previous day, though, even so, neither could
have been correctly described as being in fine fettle.</p>

<p>Capietro, who was even more surly and quarrelsome than usual,
vented his spleen upon the hapless slaves, while Stabutch ate in
morose silence, which he finally broke to revert to the subject of
his mission.</p>

<p>"I ought to get started toward the south," he said. "From all I
can learn there's nothing to be gained looking for the ape-man in
this part of the country."</p>

<p>"What you in such a hurry to find him for?" demanded Capietro.
"Ain't my company good enough for you?"</p>

<p>"'Business before pleasure,' you know, comrade," Stabutch
reminded the Italian in a conciliatory tone.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," grunted Capietro.</p>

<p>"I should like to visit you again after I have come back from
the south," suggested Stabutch.</p>

<p>"You may not come back."</p>

<p>"I shall. Peter Zveri must be avenged. The obstacle in the path
of Communism must be removed."</p>

<p>"The monkey-man killed Zveri?"</p>

<p>"No, a woman killed him," replied the Russian, "but the
monkey-man, as you call him, was directly responsible for the
failure of all Zveri's plans and thus indirectly responsible for
his death."</p>

<p>"You expect to fare better than Zveri, then? Good luck to you,
but I don't envy you your mission. This Tarzan is like a lion with
the brain of a man. He is savage. He is terrible. In his own
country he is also very powerful."</p>

<p>"I shall get him, nevertheless," said Stabutch, confidently. "If
possible I shall kill him the moment I first see him, before he has
an opportunity to become suspicious; or, if I cannot do that, I
shall win his confidence and his friendship and then destroy him
when he least suspects his danger." Voices carry upward to a great
distance, and so, though Stabutch spoke only in normal tones, the
watcher, squatting at the cliff top, smiled&mdash;just the faintest
suggestion of a grim smile.</p>

<p>So that was why the man from "Russa," of whom Goloba the headman
had told him, was inquiring as to his whereabouts? Perhaps Tarzan
had suspected as much, but he was glad to have definite proof.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad if you do kill him," said Capietro. "He would
drive me out of business if he ever learned about me. He is a
scoundrel who would prevent a man from earning an honest
dollar."</p>

<p>"You may put him from your mind, comrade," Stabutch assured the
raider. "He is already as good as dead. Furnish me with men, and I
shall soon be on my way toward the south."</p>

<p>"My ruffians are already saddling to go forth and find men for
your safari," said Capietro, with a wave of his hand in the
direction of the central compound, where a score of cutthroats were
saddling their horses in preparation for a foray against a distant
Galla village.</p>

<p>"May luck go with them," said Stabutch. "I hope&mdash;What was
that?" he demanded, leaping to his feet as a sudden crash of
falling rock and earth came from behind them.</p>

<p>Capietro was also upon his feet. "A landslide," he exclaimed. "A
portion of the cliff has fallen. Look! What is that?" he pointed at
an object half-way up the cliff&mdash;the figure of a naked white
man clinging to a tree that had found lodgment for its roots in the
rocky face of the cliff. The tree, a small one, was bending beneath
the weight of the man. Slowly it gave way, there was the sound of
rending wood, and then the figure hurtled downward into the village
where it was hidden from the sight of the two white watchers by an
intervening hut.</p>

<p>But Stabutch had seen the giant figure of the almost naked white
long enough to compare it with the description he had had of the
man for whom he had come all the long way from Moscow. There could
not be two such, of that he was certain. "It is the ape-man!" he
cried. "Come, Capietro, he is ours!"</p>

<p>Instantly the Italian ordered several <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> to advance and seize the
ape-man.</p>

<p>Fortune is never necessarily with either the brave or the
virtuous. She is, unfortunately, quite as likely to perch upon the
banner of the poltroon or the blackguard. Today she deserted Tarzan
completely. As he squatted upon the edge of the cliff, looking down
upon the village of Dominic Capietro, he suddenly felt the earth
giving beneath him. Catlike, he leaped to his feet, throwing his
hands above his head, as one does, mechanically, to preserve his
balance or seek support, but too late. With a small avalanche of
earth and rock he slid over the edge of the cliff. The tree,
growing part way down the face of the escarpment, broke his fall
and, for a moment, gave him hope that he might escape the greater
danger of the final plunge into the village, where, if the fall did
not kill him it was quite evident that his enemies would. But only
for a moment were his hopes aroused. With the breaking of the
bending stem hope vanished as he plunged on downward.</p>

<p>Danny "Gunner" Patrick, having finished his lunch, lighted a
cigarette and let his gaze wander out over the landscape that
unfolded in a lovely panorama before him. City bred, he saw only a
part of what there was to be seen and understood but little of
that. What impressed him most was the loneliness of the prospect.
"Geeze," he soliloquized, "what a hideout! No one wouldn't ever
find a guy here." His eyes suddenly focused upon an object in the
foreground. "Hey, feller," he whispered to Obambi, "what's that?"
He pointed in the direction of the thing that had aroused his
curiosity.</p>

<p>Obambi looked and, when they found it, his keen eyes recognized
it for what it was. "It is a man, bwana," he said. "It is the man
who knifed Simba in our camp that night. It is Tarzan of the
Apes."</p>

<p>"How t'ell do you know?" demanded the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"There is only one Tarzan," replied the black. "It could be no
other, as no other white man in all the jungle country or the
mountain country or the plains country goes thus naked."</p>

<p>The "Gunner" rose to his feet. He was going down to have a talk
with the ape-man, who, perhaps, could help him in his search for
Lafayette Smith; but as he arose he saw the man below him leap to
his feet and throw his arms above his head. Then he disappeared as
though swallowed up by the earth. The "Gunner" knitted his
brows.</p>

<p>"Geeze," he remarked to Obambi, "he sure screwed, didn't
he?"</p>

<p>"What, bwana?" asked Obambi.</p>

<p>"Shut up," snapped the "Gunner." "That was funny," he muttered.
"Wonder what became of him. Guess I'll give him a tail. Come on,"
he concluded aloud to Obambi.</p>

<p>Having learned through experience, wholly the experience of
others who had failed to do so, that attention to details is
essential to the continued pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness,
the "Gunner" looked carefully to his Thompson as he walked rapidly
but cautiously toward the spot where Tarzan had disappeared. He saw
that there was a cartridge in the chamber, that the magazine drum
was properly attached and that the fire control lever was set for
full automatic fire.</p>

<p>In the village, which he could not yet see and of the presence
of which he did not dream, the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> were running toward the
place where they knew the body of the fallen man must lie; and in
the van were Stabutch and Capietro, when suddenly there stepped
from the interior of the last hut the man they sought. They did not
know that he had alighted on the thatched roof of the hut from
which he had just emerged, nor that, though he had broken through
it to the floor below, it had so broken his fall that he had
suffered no disabling injury.</p>

<p>To them it seemed a miracle; and to see him thus, apparently
uninjured, took the two white men so by surprise that they halted
in their tracks while their followers, imitating their example,
clustered about them.</p>

<p>Stabutch was the first to regain his presence of mind. Whipping
a revolver from its holster he was about to fire point blank at the
ape-man, when Capietro struck his hand up. "Wait," growled the
Italian. "Do not be too fast. I am in command here."</p>

<p>"But it is the ape-man," cried Stabutch.</p>

<p>"I know that," replied Capietro, "and for that very reason I
wish to take him alive. He is rich. He will bring a great
ransom."</p>

<p>"Damn the ransom," ejaculated Stabutch. "It is his life I
want."</p>

<p>"Wait until I have the ransom," said Capietro, "and then you can
go after him."</p>

<p>In the meantime Tarzan stood watching the two. He saw that his
situation was fraught with exceptional danger. It was to the
interest of either one of these men to kill him; and while the
ransom of which one spoke might deter him temporarily he knew that
but little provocation would be required to induce this one to kill
him rather than to take the chance that he might escape, while it
was evident that the Russian already considered that he had
sufficient provocation, and Tarzan did not doubt but that he would
find the means to accomplish his design even in the face of the
Italian's objections.</p>

<p>If he could but get among them, where they could not use
firearms against him, because of the danger that they might kill
members of their own party, he felt that, by virtue of his superior
strength, speed and agility, he might fight his way to one of the
palisaded walls of the village where he would have a fair chance to
escape. Once there he could scale the palisade with the speed of
Manu, the monkey, and with little danger other than from the
revolvers of the two whites, since he held the marksmanship of the
<a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> in contempt.</p>

<p>He heard Capietro call to his men to take him alive; and then,
waiting not upon them, he charged straight for the two whites,
while from his throat burst the savage growl of a wild beast that
had, upon more than a single occasion in the past, wrought havoc
with the nerves of human antagonists.</p>

<p>Nor did it fail in its purpose now. Shocked and unnerved for the
instant, Stabutch fell back while Capietro, who had no desire to
kill the ape-man unless it became necessary, leaped to one side and
urged his followers to seize him.</p>

<p>For a moment bedlam reigned in the village of the white raider.
Yelling, cursing men milled about a white giant who fought with his
bare hands, seizing an antagonist and hurling him in the faces of
others, or, using the body of another like a flail, sought to mow
down those who opposed him.</p>

<p class="caption">A white giant who fought with his bare

</div>
<br>

<p>Among the close massed fighters, excited curs ran yelping and
barking, while children and women upon the outskirts of the mle
shrieked encouragement to the men.</p>

<p>Slowly Tarzan was gaining ground toward one of the coveted walls
of the village where, as he stepped quickly backward to avoid a
blow, he stumbled over a yapping cur and went down beneath a dozen
men.</p>

<p>From the top of the cliff "Gunner" Patrick looked down upon this
scene. "That mob has sure got him on the spot," he said aloud.
"He's a regular guy, too. I guess here's where I step for him."</p>

<p>"Yes, bwana," agreed the willing Obambi.</p>

<p>"Shut up," said the "Gunner," and then he raised the butt of the
Thompson to his shoulder and squeezed the trigger.</p>

<p>Mingled with the rapid reports of the machine gun were the
screams and curses of wounded and frightened men and the shrieks of
terrified women and children. Like snow before a spring shower, the
pack that had surrounded Tarzan melted away as men ran for the
shelter of their huts or for their saddled ponies.</p>

<p>Capietro and Stabutch were among the latter, and even before
Tarzan could realize what had happened he saw the two racing
through the open gates of the village.</p>

<p>The "Gunner," noting the satisfactory effect of his fire, had
ceased, though he stood ready again to rain a hail of death down
upon the village should necessity require. He had aimed only at the
outskirts of the crowd surrounding the ape-man, for fear that a
bullet might strike the man he was endeavoring to succor; but he
was ready to risk finer shooting should any press the naked giant
too closely.</p>

<p>He saw Tarzan standing alone in the village street like a lion
at bay, and then he saw his eyes ranging about for an explanation
of the burst of fire that had liberated him.</p>

<p>"Up here, feller!" shouted the "Gunner."</p>

<p>The ape-man raised his eyes and located Danny instantly.</p>

<p>"Wait," he called; "I'll be up there in a moment."</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI.&mdash;THE CRUCIFIXION</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS the waters of Chinnereth closed over the head
of Lady Barbara, the golden haired Jezebel sprang to her feet and
ran swiftly forward among the men congregated upon the great flat
lava rock from which the victim of their cruel fanaticism had been
hurled to her doom. She pushed apostles roughly aside as she made
her way toward the brink, tears streaming from her eyes and sobs
choking her throat.</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, standing directly in her path, was
the first to guess her purpose to throw herself into the lake and
share the fate of her loved mistress. Impelled by no humanitarian
urge, but rather by a selfish determination to save the girl for
another fate which he already had chosen for her, the Prophet
seized her as she was about to leap into the water.</p>

<p>Turning upon the old man like a tigress, Jezebel scratched, bit,
and kicked in an effort to free herself, which she would have
succeeded in doing had not the Prophet called the six executioners
to his aid. Two of them seized her; and, seeing that her efforts
were futile, the girl desisted; but now she turned the flood gates
of her wrath upon Abraham, the son of Abraham.</p>

<p>"Murderer!" she cried. "Son of Satan! May Jehovah strike thee
dead for this. Curses be upon thy head and upon those of all thy
kin. Damned be they and thee for the foul crime thou hast committed
here this day."</p>

<p>"Silence, blasphemer!" screamed Abraham, the son of Abraham.
"Make thy peace with Jehovah, for tonight thou shalt be judged by
fire. Take her back to the village," he directed the two who held
her, "and make her secure in a cave. Seest thou, too, that she
escapeth not."</p>

<p>"Fire or water, it is all the same to me," cried the girl as
they dragged her away, "just so it taketh me away forever from this
accursed land of Midian and the mad beast who poseth as the prophet
of Jehovah."</p>

<p>As Jezebel moved off toward the village between her two guards
the villagers fell in behind them, the women calling her foul names
and otherwise reviling her, and in the rear of all came the Prophet
and the Apostles, leaving a score of their fellows still lying upon
the ground, where they writhed, unnoticed, in the throes of
epilepsy.</p>

<p>The impact with the surface of the water had almost stunned Lady
Barbara, but she had managed to retain her senses and control of
her mental and physical powers, so that, although dazed, she was
able to put into effect the plan that she had nursed from the
moment that she was aware of the fate to which the Prophet had
condemned her.</p>

<p>Being an excellent swimmer and diver the thought of being
immersed below the surface of Chinnereth for a few minutes had not,
in itself, caused her any great mental perturbation. Her one fear
had lain in the very considerable possibility that she might be so
badly injured by the impact with the water, or stunned, as to be
helpless to effect her own release from the net. Her relief was
great, therefore, when she discovered that she was far from
helpless, nor did she delay an instant in bringing her small pocket
knife to play upon the fiber strands of the net that enmeshed
her.</p>

<p>Slashing rapidly, but yet, at the same time, in accordance with
a practical plan, she severed strand after strand in a straight
line, as the rock dragged her downward toward the bottom.
Constantly through her mind ran a single admonition&mdash;"Keep
cool! Keep cool!" Should she permit herself to give away to
hysteria, even for an instant, she knew that she must be lost. The
lake seemed bottomless, the strands innumerable, while the knife
grew constantly duller, and her strength appeared to be rapidly
ebbing.</p>

<p>"Keep cool! Keep cool!" Her lungs were bursting. "Just a moment
more! Keep cool!" She felt unconsciousness creeping upon her. She
struggled to drag herself through the opening she had made in the
net&mdash;her senses reeled dizzily&mdash;she was almost
unconscious as she shot rapidly toward the surface.</p>

<p>As her head rose above the surface those standing upon the rock
above her had their attention riveted upon Jezebel who was engaged
at that moment in kicking the prophet of Paul, the son of Jehovah,
on the shins. Lady Barbara was ignorant of all this; but it was
fortunate for her, perhaps, because it prevented any of the Midians
from noticing her resurrection from the deep and permitted her to
swim, unseen, beneath the shelter of the overhanging rock from
which she had been precipitated into the lake.</p>

<p>She was very weak, and it was with a prayer of thanksgiving that
she discovered a narrow ledge of beach at the water's edge beneath
the great lava block that loomed above her. As she dragged herself
wearily out upon it she heard the voices of those upon the rock
overhead&mdash;the voice of Jezebel cursing the Prophet and the old
man's threat against the girl.</p>

<p>A thrill of pride in the courage of Jezebel warmed the heart of
Lady Barbara, as did the knowledge that she had won a friend so
loyal and devoted that she would put her own life in jeopardy
merely for the sake of openly accusing the murderer of her friend.
How magnificent she was in the primitive savagery of her
denunciation! Lady Barbara could almost see her standing there
defying the greatest power that her world knew, her golden hair
framing her oval face, her eyes flashing, her lips curling in
scorn, her lithe young body tense with emotion.</p>

<p>And what she had heard, and the thought of the helplessness of
the young girl against the power of the vile old man, changed Lady
Barbara's plans completely. She had thought to remain in hiding
until night and then seek to escape this hideous valley and its mad
denizens. There would be no pursuit, for they would think her dead
at the bottom of Chinnereth; and thus she might seek to find her
way to the outer world with no danger of interference by the people
of the land of Midian.</p>

<p>She and Jezebel had often speculated upon the likelihood of the
existence of a possible avenue of ascent of the crater wall; and
from the entrance of their cave they had chosen a spot about midway
of the western face of the crater, where the rim had fallen inward,
as offering the best chance of escape. Tumbled masses of rock rose
here from the bottom of the valley almost to the summit of the
crater, and here Lady Barbara had decided to make her first bid for
freedom.</p>

<p>But now all was changed. She could not desert Jezebel, whose
life was now definitely jeopardized because of her friendship and
loyalty. But what was she to do? How could she be of assistance to
the girl? She did not know. Of only one thing was she
certain&mdash;she must try.</p>

<p>She had witnessed enough horrors in the village of the South
Midians to know that whatever Abraham, the son of Abraham, planned
for Jezebel would doubtless be consummated after dark, the time he
chose, by preference, for all the more horrible of his so-called
religious rites. Only those which took them to a distance from the
village, such as immersions in the waters of Chinnereth, were
performed by daylight.</p>

<p>With these facts in mind, Lady Barbara decided that she might,
with safety, wait until after dark before approaching the village.
To do so earlier might only result in her own recapture, an event
that would render her helpless in effecting the succor of Jezebel,
while giving the Prophet two victims instead of one.</p>

<p>The sound of voices above her had ceased. She had heard the
vituperations of the women diminishing in the distance, and by this
she had known that the party had returned to the village. It was
cold beneath the shadow of the rock, with her wet clothing clinging
to her tired body; and so she slipped back into the water and swam
along the shore a few yards until she found a spot where she could
crawl out and lie in the pleasant warmth of the sun.</p>

<p>Here she rested again for a few minutes, and then she cautiously
ascended the bank until her eyes were on a level with the ground.
At a little distance she saw a woman, lying prone, who was trying
to raise herself to a sitting position. She was evidently weak and
dazed, and Lady Barbara realized that she was recovering from one
of those horrid seizures to which nearly all the inhabitants of the
village were subject. Near her were others, some lying quietly,
some struggling; and in the direction of the village she saw
several who had recovered sufficiently to attempt the homeward
journey.</p>

<p>Lying very still, her forehead concealed behind a low shrub,
Lady Barbara watched and waited for half an hour, until the last of
the unfortunate band had regained consciousness and self control
sufficiently to permit them to depart in the direction of their
squalid habitations.</p>

<p>She was alone now with little or no likelihood of discovery. Her
clothes were still wet and exceedingly uncomfortable; so she
quickly removed them and spread them in the hot sun to dry, while
she luxuriated in the soothing comfort of a sun bath, alternated
with an occasional dip in the waters of the lake.</p>

<p>Before the sun dropped to the western rim of the crater her
clothing had dried; and now she sat, fully dressed again waiting
for darkness to fall. Below her lay the waters of the lake and
beyond its farther shore she could dimly see the outlines of the
village of the North Midians, where dwelt the mysterious "beautiful
men" of Jezebel's day dreams.</p>

<p>Doubtless, thought Lady Barbara, the prince charming of the
golden one's imagination would prove to be a whiskered Adonis with
a knotted club; but, even so, it were difficult to imagine more
degraded or repulsive males than those of her own village. Almost
anything&mdash;even a gorilla&mdash;might seem preferable to
them.</p>

<p>As night approached, the girl saw little lights commence to
twinkle in the northern village&mdash;the cooking fires,
doubtless&mdash;and then she rose and turned her face toward the
village of Abraham, the son of Abraham, of Jobab and Timothy and
Jezebel, toward certain danger and possible death.</p>

<p>As she walked along the now familiar path toward the village,
the mind of Lady Barbara Collis was vexed by the seemingly hopeless
problem that confronted her, while hovering upon the verge of her
consciousness was that fear of the loneliness and the darkness of
an unfamiliar and inhospitable country that is inherent in most of
us. Jezebel had told her that dangerous beasts were almost unknown
in the land of Midian, yet her imagination conjured slinking forms
in the darkness and the sound of padded feet upon the trail behind
her and the breathing of savage lungs. Yet ahead of her lay a real
menace more terrible, perhaps, than swiftly striking talons and
powerful jaws.</p>

<p>She recalled that she had heard that men who had been mauled by
lions, and lived to narrate their experiences, had all testified
uniformly to the fact that there had been no pain and little terror
during the swift moments of the experience; and she knew that there
was a theory propounded by certain students of animal life that the
killing of the carnivores was always swift, painless, and merciful.
Why was it, she wondered, that of all created things only man was
wantonly cruel and only man, and the beasts that were trained by
man, killed for pleasure?</p>

<p>But now she was nearing the village and passing from the
possibility of attack by merciful beasts to the assurance of attack
by merciless men, should she be apprehended by them. To reduce this
risk she skirted the village at a little distance and came to the
foot of the cliff where the caves were located and where she hoped
to find Jezebel and, perhaps, discover a means of liberating
her.</p>

<p>She glanced up the face of the cliff, which seemed to be
deserted, most of the villagers being congregated about a group of
small cooking fires near the few huts at the foot of the cliff.
They often cooked thus together gossiping and praying and narrating
experiences and revelations&mdash;they all received revelations
from Jehovah when they "walked" with Him, which was their
explanation of their epileptic seizures.</p>

<p>The more imaginative members of the community were the
recipients of the most remarkable revelations; but, as all of them
were stupid, Jehovah had not, at least during Lady Barbara's
sojourn among them, revealed anything of a particularly remarkable
or inspiring nature. Their gossip, like their "experiences," was
mean and narrow and sordid. Each sought constantly to discover or
invent some scandal or heresy in the lives of his fellows, and if
the finger pointed at one not in the good graces of the Prophet or
the Apostles the victim was quite likely to make a Roman
holiday.</p>

<p>Seeing the villagers congregated about their fires, Lady Barbara
commenced the ascent of the steep path that zigzagged up the face
of the cliff. She moved slowly and cautiously, stopping often to
look about her, both above and below; but, notwithstanding her
fears and doubts she finally reached the mouth of the cave that she
and Jezebel had occupied. If she hoped to find the golden one there
she was disappointed; but at least, if Jezebel were not there, it
was a relief to find that no one else was; and with a sense of
greater security than she had felt since the dawn of this eventful
day she crawled into the interior and threw herself down upon the
straw pallet that the girls had shared.</p>

<p>Home! This rough lair, no better than that which housed the
beasts of the wilds, was home now to Lady Barbara Collis whose life
had been spent within the marble halls of the Earl of Whimsey.
Permeating it were memories of the strange friendship and affection
that had gradually united these two girls whose origins and
backgrounds could scarcely have been more dissimilar. Here each had
learned the language of the other, here they had laughed and sung
together, here they had exchanged confidences, and here they had
planned together a future in which they would not be separated. The
cold walls seemed warmer because of the love and loyalty to which
they had been silent witnesses.</p>

<p>But now Lady Barbara was here alone. Where was Jezebel? It was
the answer to that question that the English girl must find. She
recalled the Prophet's threat&mdash;"for tonight thou shalt be
judged by fire." She must hasten, then, if she were to save
Jezebel. But how was she to accomplish it in the face of all the
seemingly insurmountable obstacles which confronted her?&mdash;her
ignorance of where Jezebel was being held, the numbers of her
enemies, her lack of knowledge of the country through which they
would be forced to flee should she be so fortunate as to effect the
girl's escape from the village.</p>

<p>She roused herself. Lying here upon her pallet would accomplish
nothing. She rose and looked down toward the village; and instantly
she was all alertness again, for there was Jezebel. She was
standing between two guards, surrounded by many villagers who
maintained an open space about her. Presently the spectators
separated and men appeared carrying a burden. What was it? They
laid it in the center of the open space, in front of Jezebel; and
then Lady Barbara saw what it was&mdash;a large wooden cross.</p>

<p>A man was digging a hole at the center of the circular space
that had been left around the prisoner; others were bringing brush
and fagots. Now the men who guarded Jezebel seized her and bore her
to the ground. They laid her upon the cross and stretched her arms
out upon the wooden cross arm.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara was horror stricken. Were they going to perpetrate
the horrible atrocity of nailing her to the cross? Abraham, the son
of Abraham, stood at the head of the cross, his hands in the
attitude of prayer, a personification of pious hypocrisy. The girl
knew that no cruelty, however atrocious, was beyond him. She knew,
too, that she was powerless to prevent the consummation of this
foul deed, yet she cast discretion and self interest to the winds,
as, with a warning cry that shattered the silence of the night, she
sped swiftly down the steep pathway toward the village&mdash;a
self-sacrifice offered willingly upon the altar of friendship.</p>

<p>Startled by her scream, every eye was turned upward toward her.
In the darkness they did not recognize her, but their stupid minds
were filled with questioning and with terror as they saw something
speeding down the cliff face toward them. Even before she reached
the circle of firelight where they stood many had collapsed in
paroxysms of epilepsy induced by the nervous shock of this
unexpected visitation.</p>

<p>When she came closer, and was recognized, others succumbed, for
now indeed it appeared that a miracle had been worked and that the
dead had been raised again, even as they had seen the dead girl
resurrected the previous day.</p>

<p>Pushing aside those who did not quickly enough make way for her,
Lady Barbara hastened to the center of the circle. As his eyes fell
upon her, Abraham, the son of Abraham, paled and stepped back. For
a moment he seemed upon the verge of a stroke.</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" he cried. "What art thou doing here?"</p>

<p>"Thou knowest who I am," replied Lady Barbara. "Why dost thou
tremble if thou dost not know that I am the messenger of Jehovah
whom thou reviledst and sought to destroy? I am here to save the
girl Jezebel from death. Later Jehovah will send His wrath upon
Abraham, the son of Abraham, and upon all the people of the land of
Midian for their cruelties and their sins."</p>

<p>"I did not know," cried the Prophet. "Tell Jehovah that I did
not know. Intercede for me, that Jehovah may forgive me; and
anything within my power to grant shall be yours."</p>

<p>So great was her surprise at the turn events had taken that Lady
Barbara, who had expected only opposition and attack, was stunned
for the moment. Here was an outcome so foreign to any that she had
imagined that she had no response ready. She almost laughed aloud
as she recalled the fears that had constantly harassed her since
she had determined to attempt Jezebel's escape. And now it was all
so easy.</p>

<p>"Liberate the girl, Jezebel," she commanded, "and then make food
ready for her and for me."</p>

<p>"Quick!" cried the Prophet. "Raise the girl and set her
free."</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed a thin, querulous voice behind him. "I have
walked with Jehovah." All turned in the direction of the speaker.
He was Jobab the apostle.</p>

<p>"Quick! Release her!" demanded Lady Barbara, who, in this
interruption and in the manner and voice of the speaker, whom she
knew as one of the most fanatically intolerant of the religious
bigots of Midian, saw the first spark that might grow into a flame
of resistance to the will of the Prophet; for she knew these people
well enough to be sure that they would grasp at any excuse to
thwart the abandonment of their cruel pleasure.</p>

<p>"Wait!" shrieked Jobab. "I have walked with Jehovah, and He hath
spoken unto me, saying: 'Behold, Jobab the Apostle, a seeming
miracle shall be wrought out of Chinnereth; but be not deceived,
for I say unto thee that it shall be the work of Satan; and
whosoever believeth in it shall perish.'"</p>

<p>"Hallelujah!" shrieked a woman, and the cry was taken up by the
others. To right and left the excited villagers were being stricken
by their Nemesis. A score of writhing bodies jerked and struggled
upon the ground in the throes of convulsions, the horrible choking,
the frothing at the mouth, adding to the horror of the scene.</p>

<p>For a moment, Abraham, the son of Abraham, stood silent in
thought. A cunning light flickered suddenly in his crafty eyes, and
then he spoke. "Amen!" he said. "Let the will of Jehovah be done as
revealed to the Apostle Jobab. Let Jobab speak the word of Jehovah,
and upon Jobab's head be the reward."</p>

<p>"Another cross," screamed Jobab; "bring another cross. Let two
beacon fires light the path of Jehovah in the heavens, and if
either of these be His children He will not let them be consumed,"
and so, as Abraham, the son of Abraham, had passed the buck to
Jobab, Jobab passed it along to Jehovah, who has been the recipient
of more than His share through the ages.</p>

<p>Futile were the threats and arguments of Lady Barbara against
the blood-lust of the Midians. A second cross was brought, a second
hole dug, and presently both she and Jezebel were lashed to the
symbols of love and raised to an upright position. The bottoms of
the crosses were sunk in the holes prepared for them and earth
tamped around them to hold them upright. Then willing hands brought
faggots and brushwood and piled them about the bases of the two
pyres.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara watched these preparations in silence. She looked
upon the weak, degenerate faces of this degraded people; and she
could not, even in the extremity of her danger, find it in her
heart to condemn them too severely for doing what supposedly far
more enlightened people had done, within the memory of man, in the
name of religion.</p>

<p>She glanced at Jezebel and found the girl's eyes upon her. "You
should not have come back," said the girl. "You might have
escaped." Lady Barbara shook her head. "You did it for me,"
continued Jezebel. "May Jehovah reward you, for I may only thank
you."</p>

<p>"You would have done the same for me at Chinnereth," replied
Lady Barbara. "I heard you defy the Prophet there."</p>

<p>Jezebel smiled. "You are the only creature I have ever loved,"
she said; "the only one who I ever thought loved me. Of course I
would die for you."</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, was praying. Young men stood ready
with flaming torches, the flickering light from which danced
grotesquely upon the hideous features of the audience, upon the two
great crosses, and upon the beautiful faces of the victims.</p>

<p>"Good bye, Jezebel," whispered Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"Good bye," replied the golden one.</p>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII.&mdash;OUT OF THE GRAVE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NOTWITHSTANDING the fact that Lafayette Smith had
so recently visualized this very emergency and had, as it were,
rehearsed his part in it, now that he stood face to face with the
lion he did none of the things exactly as he had pictured. He was
not at all cool when he saw the carnivore appear at the turn in the
fissure; he did not face him calmly, draw a deadly bead, and fire.
Nothing was in the least as he had imagined it would be. In the
first place the distance between them seemed entirely inadequate
and the lion much larger than he had supposed any lion could be,
while his revolver seemed to shrink to proportions that represented
utter futility.</p>

<p>All this, however, was encompassed in a single, instantaneous
and overwhelming conception. No appreciable time elapsed,
therefore, between the instant that he perceived the lion and that
at which he commenced to jerk the trigger of his pistol, which he
accomplished, without aiming, while in the act of turning to
flee.</p>

<p>Running headlong over the jumbled rocks Lafayette Smith fled
precipitately into the unknown depths of the ancient rift, at his
elbow the ghastly fear that beyond each successive turn would loom
the rocky terminus of his flight, while just behind him he pictured
the ravenous carnivore thirsting for his blood. The fall of swiftly
moving padded feet close behind him urged him to greater speed, the
hot breath of the lion surged from the savage lungs to pound upon
his ears like surf upon an ocean beach.</p>

<p>Such is the power of imagination. It is true that Numa was
bounding along the bottom of the rift, but in the opposite
direction to that in which Lafayette Smith bounded. Fortunately,
for Lafayette, none of his wild shots had struck the lion; but the
booming reverberation of the explosions in the narrow fissure had
so surprised and unnerved him that he had wheeled and fled even as
the man had.</p>

<p>Had the pursuit been as real as Lafayette imagined it, it could
have urged him to no greater speed, nor could the consequent terror
have nerved him to greater endurance; but physical powers have
their limits, and presently the realization that his had about
reached theirs forced itself upon Lafayette's consciousness and
with it realization of the futility of further flight.</p>

<p>It was then that he turned to make his stand. He was trembling,
but with fatigue rather than fear; and inwardly he was cool as he
reloaded his revolver. He was surprised to discover that the lion
was not on top of him, but he expected momentarily to see him
appear where the fissure turned from his sight. Seating himself on
a flat rock he waited the coming of the carnivore while he rested,
and as the minutes passed and no lion came his wonderment
increased.</p>

<p>Presently his scientific eye commenced to note the structure of
the fissure's walls about him, and as his interest grew in the
geologic facts revealed or suggested his interest in the lion
waned, until, once again, the carnivore was relegated to the
background of his consciousness, while in its place returned the
momentarily forgotten plan to explore the rift to its farthest
extent.</p>

<p>Recovered from the excessive fatigue of his strenuous exertion
he undertook once more the exploration so rudely interrupted.
Regained was the keen pleasure of discovery; forgotten, hunger,
fatigue, and personal safety as he advanced along this mysterious
path of adventure.</p>

<p>Presently the floor of the rift dropped rapidly until it was
inclined at an angle that made progress difficult; and at the same
time it narrowed, giving evidence that it might be rapidly pinching
out. There was now barely width for him to squeeze forward between
the walls when the fissure ahead of him became suddenly shrouded in
gloom. Glancing up in search of an explanation of this new
phenomenon Lafayette discovered that the walls far above were
converging, until directly above him there was only a small streak
of sky visible while ahead the rift was evidently closed entirely
at the top.</p>

<p>As he pushed on, the going, while still difficult because of the
steepness of the floor of the fissure, was improved to some extent
by the absence of jumbled rocks underfoot, the closed ceiling of
the corridor having offered no crumbling rim to the raging elements
of the ages; but presently another handicap made itself
evident&mdash;darkness, increasing steadily with each few yards
until the man was groping his way blindly, though none the less
determinedly, toward the unknown that lay ahead.</p>

<p>That an abyss might yawn beyond his next step may have occurred
to him, but so impractical was he in all worldly matters while his
scientific entity was in the ascendancy that he ignored the
simplest considerations of safety. However, no abyss yawned; and
presently, at a turning, daylight showed ahead. It was only a small
patch of daylight; and when he reached the opening through which it
shone it appeared, at first, that he had achieved the end of his
quest&mdash;that he could proceed no farther.</p>

<p>Dropping to his hands and knees he essayed the feat of worming
his way through the aperture, which he then discovered was amply
large to accommodate his body; and a moment later he stood erect in
astonished contemplation of the scene before him.</p>

<p>He found himself standing near the base of a lofty escarpment
overlooking a valley that his practiced eye recognized immediately
as the crater of a long extinct volcano. Below him spread a
panorama of rolling, tree-dotted landscape, broken by occasional
huge outcroppings of weathered lava rock; and in the center a blue
lake danced in the rays of an afternoon sun.</p>

<p>Thrilling to an identical reaction such as doubtless dominated
Balboa as he stood upon the heights of Darien overlooking the broad
Pacific, Lafayette Smith experienced that spiritual elation that
is, perhaps, the greatest reward of the explorer. Forgotten, for
the moment, was the scientific interest of the geologist, submerged
by intriguing speculation upon the history of this lost valley,
upon which, perhaps, the eyes of no other white man had ever
gazed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the permanency of this beatific state of mind
two other thoughts rudely obtruded themselves, as thoughts will.
One appertained to the camp, for which he was supposed to be
searching, while the other involved the lion, which was supposedly
searching for him. The latter reminded him that he was standing
directly in front of the mouth of the fissure, at the very spot
where the lion would emerge were he following; and this suggested
the impracticability of the fissure as an avenue of return to the
opposite side of the crater wall.</p>

<p>A hundred yards away Smith espied a tree, and toward this he
walked as offering the nearest sanctuary in the event the lion
should reappear. Here, too, he might rest while considering plans
for the future; and, that he might enjoy uninterrupted peace of
mind while so engaged, he climbed up into the tree, where,
straddling a limb, he leaned his back against the bole.</p>

<p>It was a tree of meager foliage, thus affording him an almost
unobstructed view of the scene before him, and as his eyes wandered
across the landscape they were arrested by something at the foot of
the southern wall of the crater&mdash;something that did not
perfectly harmonize with its natural surroundings. Here his gaze
remained fixed as he sought to identify the thing that had
attracted his attention. What it looked like he was positive that
it could not be, so definitely had his preconception of the
inaccessibility of the valley to man impressed itself upon his
mind; yet the longer he looked the more convinced he became that
what he saw was a small village of thatched huts.</p>

<p>And what thoughts did this recognition inspire? What noble and
aesthetic emotions were aroused within his breast by the sight of
this lonely village in the depths of the great crater which should,
by all the proofs that he had seen, have been inaccessible to
man?</p>

<p>No, you are wrong again. What it suggested was food. For the
first time since he had become lost Lafayette Smith was acutely
conscious of hunger, and when he recalled that it had been more
than twenty-four hours since he had eaten anything more substantial
than a few chocolates his appetite waxed ravenous. Furthermore, he
suddenly realized that he was actually suffering from thirst.</p>

<p>At a little distance lay the lake. Glancing back toward the
entrance to the fissure he discovered no lion; and so he dropped to
the ground and set off in the direction of the water, laying his
course so that at no time was he at any great distance from a
tree.</p>

<p>The water was cool and refreshing; and when he had drunk his
fill he became acutely conscious, for the first time during the
day, of an overpowering weariness. The water had temporarily
relieved the pangs of hunger, and he determined to rest a few
minutes before continuing on toward the distant village. Once again
he assured himself that there was no pursuing lion in evidence; and
then he stretched himself at full length in the deep grass that
grew near the edge of the lake, and with a low tree as protection
from the hot sun relaxed his tired muscles in much needed rest.</p>

<p>He had not intended to sleep; but his fatigue was greater than
he had supposed, so that, with relaxation, unconsciousness crept
upon him unawares. Insects buzzed lazily about him, a bird alighted
in the tree beneath which he lay and surveyed him critically, the
sun dropped lower toward the western rim, and Lafayette Smith slept
on.</p>

<p>He dreamed that a lion was creeping toward him through high
grass. He tried to rise, but he was powerless. The horror of the
situation was intolerable. He tried to cry out and frighten the
lion away, but no sound issued from his throat. Then he made a
final supreme effort, and the shriek that resulted awakened him. He
sat up, dripping with perspiration, and looked quickly and
fearfully about him. There was no lion. "Whew!" he exclaimed. "What
a relief."</p>

<p>Then he glanced at the sun and realized that he had slept away
the greater part of the afternoon. Now his hunger returned and with
it recollection of the distant village. Rising, he drank again at
the lake, and then started on his journey toward the base of the
southern rim, where he hoped he would find friendly natives and
food.</p>

<p>The way led for the greater part around the edge of the lake;
and as dusk settled and then darkness it became more and more
difficult to move except at a slow and cautious pace, since the
ground was often strewn with fragments of lava that were not
visible in the darkness.</p>

<p>Night brought the cheering sight of fires in the village; and
these, seeming nearer than they really were, buoyed his spirits by
the assurance that his journey was nearing completion. Yet, as he
stumbled onward, the conviction arose that he was pursuing a
will-o'-the-wisp, as the firelight appeared to retreat as rapidly
as he advanced.</p>

<p>At last, however, the outlines of mean huts, illumined by the
fires, became distinguishable and then the figures of people
clustered about them. It was not until he was almost within the
village that he saw with astonishment that the people were white,
and then he saw something else that brought him to a sudden halt.
Upon two crosses, raised above the heads of the villagers, were two
girls. The firelight played upon their faces, and he saw that both
were beautiful.</p>

<p>What weird, unholy rite was this? What strange race inhabited
this lost valley? Who were the girls? That they were not of the
same race as the villagers was apparent at the first casual glance
at the degraded features of the latter.</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith hesitated. It was evident that he was witnessing
some sort of religious rite or pageant; and he assumed that to
interrupt it would prove far from a satisfactory introduction to
these people, whose faces, which had already repelled him,
impressed him so unfavorably that he questioned the friendliness of
his reception even under the most favorable auspices.</p>

<p>And then a movement of the crowd opened for a moment an avenue
to the center of the circle where the crosses stood; and the man
was horrified by what was revealed for an instant to his amazed
eyes, for he saw the dry brush and the faggots piled about the
bottoms of the crosses and the young men with the flaming torches
ready to ignite the inflammable piles.</p>

<p>An old man was intoning a prayer. Here and there villagers
writhed upon the ground in what Smith thought were evidences of
religious ecstasy. And then the old man gave a signal, and the
torch bearers applied the flames to the dry brush.</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith waited to see no more. Leaping forward he thrust
surprised villagers from his path and sprang into the circle before
the crosses. With a booted foot he kicked the already burning brush
aside; and then, with his little .32 shining in his hand, he turned
and faced the astonished and angry crowd.</p>

<p>For a moment Abraham, the son of Abraham, was paralyzed by
surprise. Here was a creature beyond his experience or his ken. It
might be a celestial messenger; but the old man had gone so far
now, and his crazed mind was so thoroughly imbued with the lust for
torture, that he might even have defied Jehovah Himself rather than
forego the pleasures of the spectacle he had arranged.</p>

<p>At last he found his voice. "What blasphemy is this?" he
screamed. "Set upon this infidel, and tear him limb from limb."</p>

<p>"You will have to shoot, now," said an English voice at Smith's
back, "for if you don't they will kill you."</p>

<p>He realized that it was one of the girls upon the
crosses&mdash;another astonishing mystery in this village of
mysteries, that cool English voice. Then one of the torch bearers
rushed him with a maniacal shriek, and Smith fired. With a scream
the fellow clutched his chest and sprawled at the American's feet;
and at the report of the pistol and the sudden collapse of their
fellow the others, who had been moving forward upon the intruder,
fell back, while upon all sides the over-excited creatures
succumbed to the curse that had descended to them from Angustus the
Ephesian, until the ground was strewn with contorted forms.</p>

<p>Realizing that the villagers were, for the moment at least, too
disconcerted and overawed by the death of their fellow to press
their attack, Smith turned his attention at once to the two girls.
Replacing his pistol in its holster, he cut their bonds with his
pocket knife before Abraham, the son of Abraham, could collect his
scattered wits and attempt to urge his followers to a renewed
attack.</p>

<p>It was more than the work of a moment to liberate the two
captives as, after he had cut the bonds that held their feet Smith
had been compelled to partially support each with one arm as he
severed the fibers that secured their wrists to the cross arms,
lest a bone be broken or a muscle wrenched as the full weight of
the victim was thrown suddenly upon one wrist.</p>

<p>He had cut Lady Barbara down first; and she was assisting him
with Jezebel, who, having been crucified for a longer time, was
unable to stand alone, when Abraham, the son of Abraham, regained
sufficient composure to permit him to think and act.</p>

<p>Both Lady Barbara and Smith were supporting Jezebel into whose
numbed feet the blood was again beginning to circulate. Their backs
were toward the Prophet; and, taking advantage of their
preoccupation, the old man was creeping stealthily upon them from
the rear. In his hand was a crude knife, but none the less
formidable for its crudeness. It was the blood stained sacrificial
knife of this terrible old high priest of the Midians, more
terrible now because of the rage and hatred that animated the
cruel, defective mind that directed the claw-like hand that wielded
it.</p>

<p>All of his rage, all of his hatred were directed against the
person of Lady Barbara, in whom he saw the author of his
humiliation and his thwarted desires. Stealthily he crept upon her
from behind while his followers, frozen to silence by his terrible
glances, watched in breathless anticipation.</p>

<p>Occupied with the half-fainting Jezebel none of the three at the
crosses saw the repulsive figure of the avenger as he towered
suddenly behind the English girl, his right hand raised high to
drive the blade deeply into her back; but they heard his sudden,
choking, gasping scream and turned in time to see the knife fall
from his nerveless fingers as they clutched at his throat, and to
witness his collapse.</p>

<p>Angustus the Ephesian had reached out of a grave digged two
thousand years before, to save the life of Lady Barbara
Collis&mdash;though doubtless he would have turned over in that
same grave had he realized the fact.</p>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13">XIII.&mdash;THE "GUNNER" WALKS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LIKE a great cat, Tarzan of the Apes scaled the
palisade of the raiders' village, dropped lightly to the ground
upon the opposite side and ascended the cliffs a little to the
south of the village where they were less precipitous. He might
have taken advantage of the open gate; but the direction he chose
was the shorter way; and a palisade constituted no obstacle to the
foster son of Kala, the she-ape.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" was waiting for him upon the summit of the cliff
directly behind the village, and for the second time these
strangely dissimilar men met&mdash;dissimilar, and yet, in some
respects, alike. Each was ordinarily quiet to taciturnity, each was
self-reliant, each was a law unto himself in his own environment;
but there the similarity ceased for the extremes of environment had
produced psychological extremes as remotely separated as the
poles.</p>

<p>The ape-man had been reared amidst scenes of eternal beauty and
grandeur, his associates the beasts of the jungle, savage perhaps,
but devoid of avarice, petty jealousy, treachery, meanness, and
intentional cruelty; while the "Gunner" had known naught but the
squalid aspects of scenery defiled by man, of horizons grotesque
with screaming atrocities of architecture, of an earth hidden by
concrete and asphalt and littered with tin cans and garbage, his
associates, in all walks of life, activated by grand and petty
meannesses unknown to any but mankind.</p>

<p>"A machine gun has its possibilities," said the ape-man, with
the flicker of a smile.</p>

<p>"They had you in a bad spot, mister," remarked the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"I think I should have gotten out all right," replied Tarzan,
"but I thank you none the less. How did you happen to be here?"</p>

<p>"I been looking for my sidekick, and I happened to see you go
over the edge here. Obambi here, tipped me off that you was the guy
saved me from the lion,&mdash;so I was glad to step for you."</p>

<p>"You are looking for whom?"</p>

<p>"My sidekick, Smith."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be lookin' for him if I knew. He's went and lost
himself. Been gone since yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Tell me the circumstances," said Tarzan, "perhaps I can help
you."</p>

<p>"That's what I was goin' to ask you," said the "Gunner." "I know
my way around south of Madison Street, but out here I'm just a
punk. I ain't got no idea where to look for him. Geeze, take a
slant at them mountains. You might as well try to meet a guy at the
corner of Oak and Polk as hunt for him there. I'll tell you how it
happened," and then he briefly narrated all that was known of the
disappearance of Lafayette Smith.</p>

<p>"Was he armed?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"He thought he was."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He packed a shiny toy pistol, what if anybody ever shot me with
it, and I found it out, I'd turn him over my knee and spank
him."</p>

<p>"It might serve him in getting food," said Tarzan, "and that
will be of more importance to him than anything else. He's not in
much danger, except from men and starvation. Where's your
camp?"</p>

<p>Danny nodded toward the south. "Back there about a thousand
miles," he said.</p>

<p>"You'd better go to it and remain there where he can find you if
he can make his way back to it, and where I can find you if I
locate him."</p>

<p>"I want to help you hunt for him. He's a good guy, even if he is
legitimate."</p>

<p>"I can move faster alone," replied the ape-man. "If you start
out looking for him I'll probably have to find you, too."</p>

<p>The "Gunner" grinned. "I guess you ain't so far off, at that,"
he replied. "All right, I'll beat it for camp and wait there for
you. You know where our camp is at?"</p>

<p>"I'll find out," replied Tarzan and turned to Obambi to whom he
put a few questions in the native Bantu dialect of the black. Then
he turned again to the "Gunner." "I know where your camp is now.
Watch out for these fellows from that village, and don't let your
men wander very far from the protection of your machine gun."</p>

<p>"Why," demanded Danny, "what are them guys?"</p>

<p>"They are robbers, murderers, and slave raiders," replied
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Geeze," exclaimed the "Gunner," "they's rackets even in Africa,
ain't they?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what a racket is," replied the ape-man, "but
there is crime wherever there are men, and nowhere else." He turned
then, without word of parting, and started upward toward the
mountains.</p>

<p>"Geeze!" muttered the "Gunner." "That guy ain't so crazy about
men."</p>

<p>"What, bwana?" asked Obambi.</p>

<p>"Shut up," admonished Danny.</p>

<p>The afternoon was almost spent when the "Gunner" and Obambi
approached camp. Tired and footsore as he was the white man had,
none the less, pushed rapidly along the back-trail lest night
descend upon them before they reached their destination, for Danny,
in common with most city-bred humans, had discovered something
peculiarly depressing and awe-inspiring in the mysterious sounds
and silences of the nocturnal wilds. He wished the fires and
companionship of men after the sun had set. And so the two covered
the distance on the return in much less time than had been consumed
in traversing it originally.</p>

<p>As he came in sight of the camp the brief twilight of the
tropics had already fallen, the cooking fires were burning, and to
a trained eye a change would have been apparent from the appearance
of the camp when he had left it early that morning; but Danny's
eyes were trained in matters of broads, bulls, and beer trucks and
not in the concerns of camps and safaris; so, in the failing light
of dusk, he did not notice that there were more men in camp than
when he had left, nor that toward the rear of it there were horses
tethered where no horses had been before.</p>

<p>The first intimation he had of anything unusual came from
Obambi. "White men are in the camp, bwana," said the
black&mdash;"and many horses. Perhaps they found the mad bwana and
brought him back."</p>

<p>"Where do you see any white men?" demanded the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"By the big fire in the center of camp, bwana," replied
Obambi.</p>

<p>"Geeze, yes, I see 'em now," admitted Danny. "They must have
found old Smithy all right; but I don't see him, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, bwana, but perhaps he is in his tent."</p>

<p>The appearance of Patrick and Obambi caused a commotion in the
camp that was wholly out of proportion to its true significance.
The white men leaped to their feet and drew their revolvers while
strange blacks, in response to the commands of one of these, seized
rifles and stood nervously alert.</p>

<p>"You don't have to throw no fit," called Danny, "it's only me
and Obambi."</p>

<p>The white men were advancing to meet him now, and the two
parties halted face to face near one of the fires. It was then that
the eyes of one of the two strange white men alighted on the
Thompson submachine gun. Raising his revolver he covered Danny.</p>

<p>"Put up your hands!" he commanded sharply.</p>

<p>"Wotinell?" demanded the "Gunner," but he put them up as every
sensible man does when thus invited at the business end of a
pistol.</p>

<p>"Where is the ape-man?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"What ape-man? What you talkin' about? What's your racket?"</p>

<p>"You know who I mean&mdash;Tarzan," snapped the other. The
"Gunner" glanced quickly about the camp. He saw his own men herded
under guard of villainous looking blacks in long robes that had
once been white; he saw the horses tethered just beyond them; he
saw nothing of Lafayette Smith. The training and the ethics of
gangland controlled him on the instant. "Don't know the guy," he
replied sullenly.</p>

<p>"You were with him today," snarled the bearded white. "You fired
on my village."</p>

<p>"Who, me?" inquired the "Gunner" innocently. "You got me wrong,
mister. I been hunting all day. I ain't seen no one. I ain't fired
at nothing. Now it's my turn. What are you guys doin' here with
this bunch of Ku Klux Klanners? If it's a stick up, hop to it; and
get on your way. You got the drop on us, and they ain't no one to
stop you. Get it over with. I'm hungry and want to feed."</p>

<p>"Take the gun away from him," said Capietro, in Galla, to one of
his men, "also his pistol," and there was nothing for Danny
"Gunner" Patrick, with his hands above his head, to do but submit.
Then they sent Obambi, under escort, to be herded with the other
black prisoners and ordered the "Gunner" to accompany them to the
large fire that blazed in front of Smith's tent and his own.</p>

<p>"Where is your companion?" demanded Capietro.</p>

<p>"What companion?" inquired Danny.</p>

<p>"The man you have been traveling with," snapped the Italian.
"Who else would I mean?"</p>

<p>"Search me," replied the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"What you mean by that? You got something concealed upon your
person?"</p>

<p>"If you mean money, I ain't got none."</p>

<p>"You did not answer my question," continued Capietro.</p>

<p>"What question?"</p>

<p>"Where is your companion?"</p>

<p>"I ain't got none."</p>

<p>"Your headman told us there were two of you. What is your
name?"</p>

<p>"Bloom," replied Danny.</p>

<p>Capietro looked puzzled. "The headman said one of you was Smith
and the other Patrick."</p>

<p>"Never heard of 'em," insisted Danny. "The guy must of been
stringin' you. I'm here alone, hunting, and my name's Bloom."</p>

<p>"And you didn't see Tarzan of the Apes today?"</p>

<p>"Never even heard of a guy with that monicker."</p>

<p>"Either he's lying to us," said Stabutch, "or it was the other
one who fired on the village."</p>

<p>"Sure, it must of been two other fellows," Danny assured them.
"Say, when do I eat?"</p>

<p>"When you tell us where Tarzan is," replied Stabutch.</p>

<p>"Then I guess I don't eat," remarked Danny. "Geeze, didn't I
tell you I never heard of the guy? Do you think I know every monkey
in Africa by his first name? Come on now, what's your racket? If we
got anything you want, take it and screw. I'm sick lookin' at your
mugs."</p>

<p>"I do not understand English so well," whispered Capietro to
Stabutch. "I do not always know what he says."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," replied the Russian; "but I think he is lying to
us. Perhaps he is trying to gain time until his companion and
Tarzan arrive."</p>

<p>"That is possible," replied Capietro in his normal voice.</p>

<p>"Let's kill him and get out of here," suggested Stabutch. "We
can take the prisoners and as much of the equipment as you want and
be a long way from here in the morning."</p>

<p>"Geeze," exclaimed Danny, "this reminds me of Chi. It makes me
homesick."</p>

<p>"How much money you pay if we don't kill you?" asked Capietro.
"How much your friends pay?"</p>

<p>The "Gunner" laughed. "Say, mister, you're giving yourself a bum
steer." He was thinking how much more one might collect for killing
him, if one could make connections with certain parties on the
North Side of Chicago, than for sparing his life. But here was an
opportunity, perhaps, to gain time. The "Gunner" did not wish to be
killed, and so he altered his technique. "My friends ain't rich,"
he said, "but they might come across with a few grand. How much do
you want?"</p>

<p>Capietro considered. This must be a rich American, for only rich
men could afford these African big game expeditions. "One hundred
thousand should not be excessive for a rich man like you," he
said.</p>

<p>"Quit your kidding," said the "Gunner." "I ain't rich."</p>

<p>"What could you raise?" asked Capietro, who saw by the
prisoner's expression of astonishment that the original bid was
evidently out of the question.</p>

<p>"I might scrape up twenty grand," suggested Danny.</p>

<p>"What are grand?" demanded the Italian.</p>

<p>"Thousand&mdash;twenty thousand," explained the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"Poof!" cried Capietro. "That would not pay me for the trouble
of keeping you until the money could be forwarded from America.
Make it fifty thousand lire and it's a bargain."</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand lire? What's them?"</p>

<p>"A lire is an Italian coin worth about twenty cents in American
money," explained Stabutch.</p>

<p>Danny achieved some rapid mental calculations before he replied;
and when he had digested the result he had difficulty in repressing
a smile, for he discovered that his offer of twenty thousand grand
was actually twice what the Italian was now demanding. Yet he
hesitated to agree too willingly. "That's ten thousand iron men,"
he said. "That's a lot of jack."</p>

<p>"Iron men? Jack? I do not understand," said Capietro.</p>

<p>"Smackers," explained Danny lucidly.</p>

<p>"Smackers? Is there such a coin in America?" asked Capietro,
turning to Stabutch.</p>

<p>"Doubtless a vernacularism," said the Russian.</p>

<p>"Geeze, you guys is dumb," growled the "Gunner." "A smacker's a
buck. Every one knows that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if you would tell him in dollars it would be easier,"
suggested Stabutch. "We all understand the value of an American
dollar."</p>

<p>"That's a lot more than some Americans understand," Danny
assured him; "but it's just what I been saying right
along&mdash;ten thousand dollars&mdash;and it's too damn much."</p>

<p>"That is for you to decide," said Capietro. "I am tired of
bargaining&mdash;nobody but an American would bargain over a human
life."</p>

<p>"What you been doing?" demanded the "Gunner." "You're the guy
that started it."</p>

<p>Capietro shrugged. "It is not my life," he said. "You will pay
me ten thousand American dollars, or you will die. Take your
choice."</p>

<p>"Oke," said Danny. "I'll pay. Now do I eat? If you don't feed me
I won't be worth nothing."</p>

<p>"Tie his hands," Capietro ordered one of the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a>, then he fell to discussing
plans with Stabutch. The Russian finally agreed with Capietro that
the palisaded village of the raider would be the best place to
defend themselves in the event that Tarzan enlisted aid and
attacked them in force. One of their men had seen Lord Passmore's
safari; and, even if their prisoner was lying to them, there was at
least another white, probably well armed, who might be considered a
definite menace. Ogonyo had told them that this man was alone and
probably lost, but they did not know whether or not to believe the
headman. If Tarzan commandeered these forces, which Capietro knew
he had the influence to do, they might expect an attack upon their
village.</p>

<p>By the light of several fires the blacks of the captured safari
were compelled to break camp and, when the loads were packed, to
carry them on the difficult night march toward Capietro's village.
With mounted <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> in
advance, upon the flanks, and bringing up the rear there was no
lagging and no chance to escape.</p>

<p>The "Gunner," plodding along at the head of his own porters,
viewed the prospect of that night march with unmitigated disgust.
He had traversed the route twice already since sunrise; and the
thought of doing it again, in the dark, with his hands tied behind
him was far from cheering. To add to his discomfort he was weak
from hunger and fatigue, and now the pangs of thirst were assailing
him.</p>

<p>"Geeze," he soliloquized, "this ain't no way to treat a regular
guy. When I took 'em for a ride I never made no guy walk, not even
a rat. I'll get these lousy bums yet&mdash;a thinkin' they can put
Danny Patrick on the spot, an' make him walk all the way!"</p>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14">XIV.&mdash;FLIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS the choking cry broke from the lips of Abraham,
the son of Abraham, Lady Barbara and Smith wheeled to see him fall,
the knife clattering to the ground from his nerveless fingers.
Smith was horrified, and the girl blenched, as they realized how
close death had been. She saw Jobab and the others standing there,
their evil faces contorted with rage.</p>

<p>"We must get away from here," she said. "They will be upon us in
a moment."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll have to help me support your friend," said
Smith. "She cannot walk alone."</p>

<p>"Put your left arm around her," directed Lady Barbara. "That
will leave your right hand free for your pistol. I will support her
on the other side."</p>

<p>"Leave me," begged Jezebel. "I will only keep you from
escaping."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Smith. "Put your arm across my shoulders."</p>

<p>"You will soon be able to walk," Lady Barbara told her, "when
the blood gets back into your feet. Come! Let's get away from here
while we can."</p>

<p>Half carrying Jezebel, the two started to move toward the circle
of menacing figures surrounding them. Jobab was the first to regain
his wits since the Prophet had collapsed at the critical moment.
"Stop them!" he cried, as he prepared to block their way, at the
same time drawing a knife from the folds of his filthy garment.</p>

<p>"One side, fellow!" commanded Smith, menacing Jobab with his
pistol.</p>

<p>"The wrath of Jehovah will be upon thee," cried Lady Barbara in
the Midian tongue, "as it has been upon the others who would have
harmed us, if thou failest to let us pass in peace."</p>

<p>"It is the work of Satan," shrilled Timothy. "Do not let them
weaken thy heart with lies, Jobab. Do not let them pass!" The elder
was evidently under great mental and nervous strain. His voice
shook as he spoke, and his muscles were trembling. Suddenly he,
too, collapsed as had Abraham, the son of Abraham. But still Jobab
stood his ground, his knife raised in a definite menace against
them. All around them the circle was growing smaller and its
circumference more solidly knit by the forward pressing bodies of
the Midians.</p>

<p>"I hate to do it," said Smith, half aloud, as he raised his
pistol and aimed it at Jobab. The Apostle was directly in front of
Lafayette Smith and little more than a yard distant when the
American, aiming point blank at his chest, jerked the trigger and
fired.</p>

<p>An expression of surprise mingled with that of rage which had
convulsed the unbecoming features of Jobab the Apostle. Lafayette
Smith was also surprised and for the same reason&mdash;he had
missed Jobab. It was incredible&mdash;there must be something wrong
with the pistol!</p>

<p>But Jobab's surprise, while based upon the same miracle, was of
a loftier and nobler aspect. It was clothed in the sanctity of
divine revelation. It emanated from a suddenly acquired conviction
that he was immune to the fire and thunder of this strange weapon
that he had seen lay Lamech low but a few minutes earlier. Verily,
Jehovah was his shield and his buckler!</p>

<p>For a moment, as the shot rang out, Jobab paused and then,
clothed in the fancied immunity of this sudden revelation, he
leaped upon Lafayette Smith. The sudden and unexpected impact of
his body knocked the pistol from Smith's hand and simultaneously
the villagers closed in upon him. A real menace now that they had
witnessed the futility of the strange weapon.</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith was no weakling, and though his antagonist was
inspired by a combination of maniacal fury and religious fanaticism
the outcome of their struggle must have been a foregone conclusion
had there been no outside influences to affect it. But there were.
Beside the villagers, there was Lady Barbara Collis.</p>

<p>With consternation she had witnessed the futility of Smith's
marksmanship; and when she saw him disarmed and in the grip of
Jobab, with others of the villagers rushing to his undoing, she
realized that now, indeed, the lives of all three of them were in
direct jeopardy.</p>

<p>The pistol lay at her feet, but only for a second. Stooping, she
seized it; and then, with the blind desperation of
self-preservation, she shoved the muzzle against Jobab's side and
pulled the trigger; and as he fell, a hideous shriek upon his lips,
she turned the weapon upon the advancing villagers and fired again.
It was enough. Screaming in terror, the Midians turned and fled. A
wave of nausea swept over the girl; she swayed and might have
fallen had not Smith supported her.</p>

<p>"I'll be all right in a moment," she said. "It was so
horrible!"</p>

<p>"You were very brave," said Lafayette Smith.</p>

<p>"Not as brave as you," she replied with a weak little smile;
"but a better shot."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Jezebel, "I thought they would have us again. Now
that they are frightened, let us go away. It will require only a
word from one of the apostles to send them upon us again."</p>

<p>"You are right," agreed Smith. "Have you any belongings you wish
to take with you?"</p>

<p>"Only what we wear," replied Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"What is the easiest way out of the valley?" asked the man, on
the chance that there might be another and nearer avenue of escape
than the fissure through which he had come.</p>

<p>"We know of no way out," replied Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Then follow me," directed Smith. "I'll take you out the way I
came in."</p>

<p>They made their way from the village and out onto the dark plain
toward Chinnereth, nor did they speak again until they had gone
some distance from the fires of the Midians and felt that they were
safe from pursuit. It was then that Lafayette Smith asked a
question prompted by natural curiosity.</p>

<p>"How can it be possible that you young ladies know of no way out
of this valley?" he asked. "Why can't you go out the way you came
in?"</p>

<p>"I could scarcely do that," replied Jezebel; "I was born
here."</p>

<p>"Born here?" exclaimed Smith. "Then your parents must live in
the valley. We can go to their home. Where is it?"</p>

<p>"We just came from it," explained Lady Barbara. "Jezebel was
born in the village from which we have just escaped."</p>

<p>"And those beasts killed her parents?" demanded Lafayette.</p>

<p>"You do not understand," said Lady Barbara. "Those people are
her people."</p>

<p>Smith was dumbfounded. He almost ejaculated: "How horrible!" but
stayed the impulse. "And you?" he asked presently. "Are they your
people, too?" There was a note of horror in his voice.</p>

<p>"No," replied Lady Barbara. "I am English."</p>

<p>"And you don't know how you got into this valley?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know&mdash;I came by parachute."</p>

<p>Smith halted and faced her. "You're Lady Barbara Collis!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" she asked. "Have you been searching for
me?"</p>

<p>"No, but when I passed through London the papers were full of
the story of your flight and your disappearance&mdash;pictures and
things, you know."</p>

<p>"And you just stumbled onto me? What a coincidence! And how
fortunate for me."</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, I am lost myself," admitted Smith. "So
possibly you are about as badly off as you were before."</p>

<p>"Scarcely," she said. "You have at least prevented my premature
cremation."</p>

<p>"They were really going to burn you? It doesn't seem possible in
this day and age of enlightenment and civilization."</p>

<p>"The Midians are two thousand years behind the times," she told
him, "and in addition to that they are religious, as well as
congenital, maniacs."</p>

<p>Smith glanced in the direction of Jezebel whom he could see
plainly in the light of a full moon that had but just topped the
eastern rim of the crater. Perhaps Lady Barbara sensed the unspoken
question that disturbed him.</p>

<p>"Jezebel is different," she said. "I cannot explain why, but she
is not at all like her people. She tells me that occasionally one
such as she is born among them."</p>

<p>"But she speaks English," said Smith. "She cannot be of the same
blood as the people I saw in the village, whose language is
certainly not the same as hers, to say nothing of the dissimilarity
of their physical appearance."</p>

<p>"I taught her English," explained Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"She wants to go away and leave her parents and her people?"
asked Smith.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," said Jezebel. "Why should I want to stay here
and be murdered? My father, my mother, my brothers and sisters were
in that crowd you saw about the crosses tonight. They hate me. They
have hated me from the day I was born, because I am not like them.
But then there is no love in the land of Midian&mdash;only
religion, which preaches love and practices hate."</p>

<p>Smith fell silent as the three plodded on over the rough ground
down toward the shore of Chinnereth. He was considering the
responsibility that Fate had loaded upon his shoulders so
unexpectedly and wondering if he were equal to the emergency, who,
as he was becoming to realize, could scarcely be sure of his
ability to insure his own existence in this savage and unfamiliar
world.</p>

<p>Keenly the realization smote him that in almost thirty hours
that he had been thrown exclusively upon his own resources he had
discovered not a single opportunity to provide food for himself,
the result of which was becoming increasingly apparent in a
noticeable loss of strength and endurance. What then might he hope
to accomplish with two additional mouths to feed?</p>

<p>And what if they encountered either savage beasts or unfriendly
natives? Lafayette Smith shuddered. "I hope they can run fast," he
murmured.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Lady Barbara. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh," stammered Lafayette. "I&mdash;I did not know that I spoke
aloud." How could he tell her that he had lost confidence even in
his .32? He could not. Never before in his life had he felt so
utterly incompetent. His futility seemed to him to border on
criminality. At any rate it was dishonorable, since it was
deceiving these young women who had a right to expect guidance and
protection from him.</p>

<p>He was very bitter toward himself; but that, perhaps, was due
partly to the nervous reaction following the rather horrible
experience at the village and physical weakness that was bordering
on exhaustion. He was excoriating himself for having dismissed
Obambi, which act, he realized, was at the bottom of all his
troubles; and then he recalled that had it not been for that there
would have been no one to save these two girls from the horrible
fate from which he had preserved them. This thought somewhat
restored his self-esteem, for he could not escape the fact that he
had, after all, saved them.</p>

<p>Jezebel, the circulation restored to her feet, had been walking
without assistance for some time. The three had lapsed into a long
silence, each occupied with his own thoughts, as Smith led the way
in search of the opening into the fissure.</p>

<p>A full African moon lighted their way, its friendly beams
lessening the difficulties of the night march. Chinnereth lay upon
their right, a vision of loveliness in the moonlight, while all
about them the grim mass of the crater walls seemed to have closed
in upon them and to hang menacingly above their heads, for night
and moonlight play strange tricks with perspective.</p>

<p>It was shortly after midnight that Smith first stumbled and
fell. He arose quickly, berating his awkwardness; but as he
proceeded, Jezebel, who was directly behind him, noticed that he
walked unsteadily, stumbling more and more often. Presently he fell
again, and this time it was apparent to both girls that it was only
with considerable effort that he arose. The third time he fell they
both helped him to his feet.</p>

<p>"I'm terribly clumsy," he said. He was swaying slightly as he
stood between them.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara observed him closely. "You are exhausted," she
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," insisted Smith. "I'm all right."</p>

<p>"When did you eat last?" demanded the girl.</p>
e

<p>"I had some chocolate with me," replied Smith. "I ate the last
of it this afternoon sometime."</p>

<p>"When did you eat a meal, I mean?" persisted Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"Well," he admitted, "I had a light lunch yesterday noon, or
rather day before yesterday. It must be after midnight now."</p>

<p>"And you have been walking all the time since?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I ran part of the time," he replied, with a weak laugh.
"That was when the lion chased me. And I slept in the afternoon
before I came to the village."</p>

<p>"We are going to stop right here until you are rested,"
announced the English girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he demurred, "we mustn't do that. I want to get you
out of this valley before daylight, as they will probably pursue us
as soon as the sun comes up."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Jezebel. "They are too much afraid of
the North Midians to come this far from the village; and, anyway,
we have such a start that we can reach the cliffs, where you say
the fissure is, before they could overtake us."</p>

<p>"You must rest," insisted Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>Reluctantly Lafayette sat down. "I'm afraid I'm not going to be
much help to you," he said. "You see I am not really familiar with
Africa, and I fear that I am not adequately armed for your
protection. I wish Danny were here."</p>

<p>"Who is Danny?" asked Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"He's a friend who accompanied me on this trip."</p>

<p>"He's had African experience?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Lafayette, "but one always feels safe with Danny
about. He seems so familiar with firearms. You see he is a
protection guy."</p>

<p>"What is a protection guy?" asked Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"To be quite candid," replied Lafayette, "I am not at all sure
that I know myself what it is. Danny is not exactly garrulous about
his past; and I have hesitated to pry into his private affairs, but
he did volunteer the information one day that he had been a
protection guy for a big shot. It sounded reassuring."</p>

<p>"What is a big shot?" inquired Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a big game hunter," suggested Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"No," said Lafayette.</p>

<p>"I gather from Danny's remarks that a big shot is a rich brewer
or distiller who also assists in directing the affairs of a large
city. It may be just another name for political boss."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Lady Barbara, "it would be nice if your friend
were here; but he is not, so suppose you tell us something about
yourself. Do you realize that we do not even know your name?"</p>

<p>Smith laughed. "That's about all there is to know about me," he
said. "It's Lafayette Smith, and now will you introduce me to this
other young lady? I already know who you are."</p>

<p>"Oh, this is Jezebel," said Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Smith.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara laughed.</p>

<p>"Just Jezebel," she said. "If we ever get out of here we'll have
to find a surname for her. They don't use 'em in the land of
Midian."</p>

<p>Smith lay on his back looking up at the moon. Already he was
commencing to feel the beneficial effects of relaxation and rest.
His thoughts were toying with the events of the past thirty hours.
What an adventure for a prosaic professor of geology, he thought.
He had never been particularly interested in girls, although he was
far from being a misogynist, and to find himself thus thrown into
the intimate relationship of protector to two beautiful young women
was somewhat disconcerting. And the moon had revealed that they
were beautiful. Perhaps the sun might have a different story to
tell. He had heard of such things and he wondered. But sunlight
could not alter the cool, crisp, well bred voice of Lady Barbara
Collis. He liked to hear her talk. He had always enjoyed the accent
and diction of cultured English folk.</p>

<p>He tried to think of something to ask her that he might listen
to her voice again. That raised the question of just how he should
address her. His contacts with nobility had been few&mdash;in fact
almost restricted to a single Russian prince who had been a door
man at a restaurant he sometimes patronized, and he had never heard
him addressed otherwise than as Mike. He thought Lady Barbara would
be the correct formula, though that smacked a little of
familiarity. Lady Collis seemed, somehow, even less appropriate. He
wished he were sure. Mike would never do. Jezebel. What an archaic
name! And then he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara looked down at him and raised a warning finger to
her lips lest Jezebel awaken him. Then she rose and walked away a
short distance, beckoning the golden one to follow.</p>

<p>"He is about done up," she whispered, as they seated themselves
again. "Poor chap, he has had a rough time of it. Imagine being
chased by a lion with only that little popgun with which to defend
oneself."</p>

<p>"Is he from your country?" asked Jezebel.</p>

<p>"No, he's an American. I can tell by his accent."</p>

<p>"He is very beautiful," said Jezebel, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"After looking at Abraham, the son of Abraham, and Jobab, for
all these weeks I could agree with you if you insisted that St.
Ghandi is an Adonis," replied Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"I do not know what you mean," said Jezebel; "but do you not
think him beautiful?"</p>

<p>"I am less interested in his pulchritude than in his
marksmanship, and that is positively beastly. He's got sand though,
my word! no end. He walked right into that village and took us out
from under the noses of hundreds of people with nothing but his
little peashooter for protection. That, Jezebel, was top hole."</p>

<p>The golden Jezebel sighed. "He is much more beautiful than the
men of the land of North Midian," she said.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara looked at her companion for a long minute; then she
sighed. "If I ever get you to civilization," she said, "I'm afraid
you are going to prove something of a problem." Wherewith she
stretched herself upon the ground and was soon asleep, for she,
too, had had a strenuous day.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15">XV.&mdash;ESHBAAL, THE
SHEPHERD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE sun shining on his upturned face awakened
Lafayette Smith. At first he had difficulty in collecting his
thoughts.</p>

<p>The events of the previous night appeared as a dream, but when
he sat up and discovered the figures of the sleeping girls a short
distance from him his mind was jerked rudely back into the world of
realities. His heart sank. How was he to acquit himself creditably
of such a responsibility? Frankly, he did not know.</p>

<p>He had no doubt but that he could find the fissure and lead his
charges to the outer world, but how much better off would they be
then? He had no idea now, and he realized that he never had, where
his camp lay. Then there was the possibility of meeting the lion
again in the fissure, and if they did not there was still the
question of sustenance. What were they going to use for food, and
how were they going to get it?</p>

<p>The thought of food awoke a gnawing hunger within him. He arose
and walked to the shore of the lake where he lay on his belly and
filled himself with water. When he stood up the girls were sitting
up looking at him.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he greeted them. "I was just having breakfast.
Will you join me?"</p>

<p>They returned his salutation as they arose and came toward him.
Lady Barbara was smiling. "Thank the lord, you have a sense of
humor," she said. "I think we are going to need a lot of it before
we get out of this."</p>

<p>"I would much prefer ham and eggs," he replied ruefully.</p>

<p>"Now I know you're an American," she said.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are thinking of tea and marmalade," he
rejoined.</p>

<p>"I am trying not to think of food at all," she replied.</p>

<p>"Have some lake," he suggested. "You have no idea how satisfying
it is if you take enough of it."</p>

<p>After the girls had drunk the three set off again, led by Smith,
in search of the opening to the fissure. "I know just where it is,"
he had assured them the night before, and even now he thought that
he would have little difficulty in finding it, but when they
approached the base of the cliff at the point where he had expected
to find it it was not there.</p>

<p>Along the foot of the beetling escarpment he searched, almost
frantically now, but there was no sign of the opening through which
he had crawled into the valley of the land of Midian. Finally,
crushed, he faced Lady Barbara. "I cannot find it," he admitted,
and there was a quality of hopelessness in his voice that touched
her.</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said. "It must be somewhere. We shall just
have to keep searching until we find it."</p>

<p>"But it's so hard on you young ladies," he said. "It must be a
bitter disappointment to you. You don't know how it makes me feel
to realize that, with no one to depend on but me, I have failed you
so miserably."</p>

<p>"Don't take it that way, please," she begged. "Anyone might have
lost his bearings in this hole. These cliffs scarcely change their
appearance in miles."</p>

<p>"It's kind of you to say that, but I cannot help but feel
guilty. Yet I know the opening cannot be far from here. I came in
on the west side of the valley, and that is where we are now. Yes,
I am sure I must find it eventually; but there is no need for all
of us to search. You and Jezebel sit down here and wait while I
look for it."</p>

<p>"I think we should remain together," suggested Jezebel.</p>

<p>"By all means," agreed Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"As you wish," said Smith. "We will search toward the north as
far as it is possible that the opening can lie. If we don't find it
we can come back here and search toward the south."</p>

<p>As they moved along the base of the cliff in a northerly
direction Smith became more and more convinced that he was about to
discover the entrance to the fissure. He thought that he discerned
something familiar in the outlook across the valley from this
location, but still no opening revealed itself after they had gone
a considerable distance.</p>

<p>Presently, as they climbed the rise and gained the summit of one
of the numerous low ridges that ran, buttress-like, from the face
of the cliff down into the valley, he halted in discouragement.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Jezebel.</p>

<p>"That forest," he replied. "There was no forest in sight of the
opening."</p>

<p>Before them spread an open forest of small trees that grew
almost to the foot of the cliffs and stretched downward to the
shore of the lake, forming a landscape of exceptional beauty in its
park-like aspect. But Lafayette Smith saw no beauty there&mdash;he
saw only another proof of his inefficiency and ignorance.</p>

<p>"You came through no forest on your way from the cliffs to the
village?" demanded Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "We've got to walk all the way back now," he
said, "and search in the other direction. It is most disheartening.
I wonder if you can forgive me."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," said Lady Barbara. "One might think that you
were a Cook's Tour courier who had got lost during a personally
conducted tour of the art galleries of Paris and expected to lose
his job in consequence."</p>

<p>"I feel worse than that," Smith admitted with a laugh, "and I
imagine that's saying a lot."</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Lady Barbara. "There are animals of some sort
down there in the forest. Don't you see them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," cried Jezebel, "I see them."</p>

<p>"What are they?" asked Smith. "They look like deer."</p>

<p>"They are goats," said Jezebel. "The North Midians have goats.
They roam over this end of the valley."</p>

<p>"They look like something to eat, to me," said Lady Barbara.
"Let's go down and get one of them."</p>

<p>"They will probably not let us catch them," suggested
Lafayette.</p>

<p>"You've a pistol," the English girl reminded him.</p>

<p>"That's a fact," he agreed. "I can shoot one."</p>

<p>"Maybe," qualified Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"I'd better go down alone," said Smith. "Three of us together
might frighten them."</p>

<p>"You'll have to be mighty careful or you'll frighten them
yourself," warned Lady Barbara. "Have you ever stalked game?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted the American, "I never have."</p>

<p>Lady Barbara moistened a finger and held it up. "The wind is
right," she announced. "So all you have to do is keep out of sight
and make no noise."</p>

<p>"How am I going to keep out of sight?" demanded Smith.</p>

<p>"You'll have to crawl down to them, taking advantage of trees,
rocks and bushes&mdash;anything that will conceal you. Crawl
forward a few feet and then stop, if they show any sign of
nervousness, until they appear unconcerned again."</p>

<p>"That will take a long time," said Smith.</p>

<p>"It may be a long time before we find anything else to eat," she
reminded him, "and nothing we do find is going to walk up to us and
lie down and die at our feet."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," assented Smith. "Here goes! Pray for
me." He dropped to his hands and knees and crawled slowly forward
over the rough ground in the direction of the forest and the goats.
After a few yards he turned and whispered: "This is going to be
tough on the knees."</p>

<p>"Not half as hard as it's going to be on our stomachs if you
don't succeed," replied Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>Smith made a wry face and resumed his crawling while the two
girls, lying flat now to conceal themselves from the quarry,
watched his progress.</p>

<p>"He's not doing half badly," commented Lady Barbara after
several minutes of silent watching.</p>

<p>"How beautiful he is," sighed Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Just at present the most beautiful things in the landscape are
those goats," said Lady Barbara. "If he gets close enough for a
shot and misses I shall die&mdash;and I know he will miss."</p>

<p>"He didn't miss Lamech last night," Jezebel reminded her.</p>

<p>"He must have been aiming at someone else," commented Lady
Barbara shortly.</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith crawled on apace. With numerous halts, as
advised by Lady Barbara, he drew slowly nearer his unsuspecting
quarry. The minutes seemed hours. Pounding constantly upon his
brain was the consciousness that he must not fail, though not for
the reason that one might naturally assume. The failure to procure
food seemed a less dreadful consequence than the contempt of Lady
Barbara Collis.</p>

<p>Now, at last, he was quite close to the nearest of the herd.
Just a few more yards and he was positive that he could not miss. A
low bush, growing just ahead of him, concealed his approach from
the eyes of his victim. Lafayette Smith reached the bush and paused
behind it. A little farther ahead he discovered another shrub still
closer to the goat, a thin nanny with a large udder. She did not
look very appetizing, but beneath that unprepossessing exterior
Lafayette Smith knew there must be hidden juicy steaks and cutlets.
He crawled on. His knees were raw and his neck ached from the
unnatural position his unfamiliar method of locomotion had
compelled it to assume.</p>

<p>He passed the bush behind which he had paused, failing to see
the kid lying hidden upon its opposite side&mdash;hidden by a
solicitous mamma while she fed. The kid saw Lafayette but it did
not move. It would not move until its mother called it, unless
actually touched by something, or terrified beyond the limit of its
self-control.</p>

<p>It watched Lafayette crawling toward the next bush upon his
itinerary&mdash;the next and last. What it thought is unrecorded,
but it is doubtful that it was impressed by Lafayette's beauty.</p>

<p>Now the man had reached the concealment of the last bush, unseen
by any other eyes than those of the kid. He drew his pistol
cautiously, lest the slightest noise alarm his potential dinner.
Raising himself slightly until his eyes were above the level of the
bush he took careful aim. The goat was so close that a miss
appeared such a remote contingency as to be of negligible
consideration.</p>

<p>Lafayette already felt the stirring warmth of pride with which
he would toss the carcass of his kill at the feet of Lady Barbara
and Jezebel. Then he jerked the trigger.</p>

<p>Nanny leaped straight up into the air, and when she hit the
ground again she was already streaking north in company with the
balance of the herd. Lafayette Smith had missed again.</p>

<p>He had scarcely time to realize the astounding and humiliating
fact as he rose to his feet when something struck him suddenly and
heavily from behind&mdash;a blow that bent his knees beneath him
and brought him heavily to earth in a sitting posture. No, not to
earth. He was sitting on something soft that wriggled and squirmed.
His startled eyes, glancing down, saw the head of a kid protruding
from between his legs&mdash;little Capra hircus had been terrified
beyond the limit of his self-control.</p>

<p>"Missed!" cried Lady Barbara Collis. "How could he!" Tears of
disappointment welled to her eyes.</p>

<p>Eshbaal, hunting his goats at the northern fringe of the forest
cocked his ears and listened. That unfamiliar sound! And so near.
From far across the valley, toward the village of the South
Midians, Eshbaal had heard a similar sound, though faintly from
afar, the night before. Four times it had broken the silence of the
valley and no more. Eshbaal had heard it and so had his fellows in
the village of Elija, the son of Noah.</p>

<p>Lafayette Smith seized the kid before it could wriggle free, and
despite its struggles he slung it across his shoulder and started
back toward the waiting girls.</p>

<p>"He didn't miss it!" exclaimed Jezebel. "I knew he wouldn't,"
and she went down to meet him, with Lady Barbara, perplexed,
following in her wake.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" cried the English girl as they came closer. "You
really did shoot one, didn't you? I was sure you missed."</p>

<p>"I did miss," admitted Lafayette ruefully.</p>

<p>"But how did you get it?"</p>

<p>"If I must admit it," explained the man, "I sat on it. As a
matter of fact it got me."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, you have it," she said.</p>

<p>"And it will be a whole lot better eating than the one I
missed," he assured them. "That one was terribly thin and very
old."</p>

<p>"How cute it is," said Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Don't," cried Lady Barbara. "We mustn't think of that. Just
remember that we are starving."</p>

<p>"Where shall we eat it?" asked Smith.</p>

<p>"Right here," replied the English girl. "There is plenty of
deadwood around these trees. Have you matches?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Now you two look the other way while I do my duty. I wish
I'd hit the old one now. This is like murdering a baby."</p>

<p>Upon the opposite side of the forest Eshbaal was once again
experiencing surprise, for suddenly the goats for which he had been
searching came stampeding toward him.</p>

<p>"The strange noise frightened them," soliloquized Eshbaal.
"Perhaps it is a miracle. The goats for which I have searched all
day have been made to return unto me."</p>

<p>As they dashed past, the trained eye of the shepherd took note
of them. There were not many goats in the bunch that had strayed,
so he had no difficulty in counting them. A kid was missing. Being
a shepherd there was nothing for Eshbaal to do but set forth in
search of the missing one. He advanced cautiously, alert because of
the noise he had heard.</p>

<p>Eshbaal was a short, stocky man with blue eyes and a wealth of
blond hair and beard. His features were regular and handsome in a
primitive, savage way. His single garment, fashioned from a goat
skin, left his right arm entirely free, nor did it impede his legs,
since it fell not to his knees. He carried a club and a rude
knife.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara took charge of the culinary activities after
Lafayette had butchered the kid and admitted that, beyond hard
boiling eggs, his knowledge of cooking was too sketchy to warrant
serious mention. "And anyway," he said, "we haven't any eggs."</p>

<p>Following the directions of the English girl, Smith cut a number
of chops from the carcass; and these the three grilled on pointed
sticks that Lady Barbara had had him cut from a nearby tree.</p>

<p>"How long will it take to cook them?" demanded Smith. "I could
eat mine raw. I could eat the whole kid raw, for that matter, in
one sitting and have room left for the old nanny I missed."</p>

<p>"We'll eat only enough to keep us going," said Lady Barbara;
"then we'll wrap the rest in the skin and take it with us. If we're
careful, this should keep us alive for three or four days."</p>

<p>"Of course you're right," admitted Lafayette. "You always
are."</p>

<p>"You can have a big meal this time," she told him, "because
you've been longer without food than we."</p>

<p>"You have had nothing for a long time, Barbara," said Jezebel.
"I am the one who needs the least."</p>

<p>"We all need it now," said Lafayette. "Let's have a good meal
this time, get back our strength, and then ration the balance so
that it will last several days. Maybe I will sit on something else
before this is gone."</p>

<p>They all laughed; and presently the chops were done, and the
three fell to upon them. "Like starving Armenians," was the simile
Smith suggested.</p>

<p>Occupied with the delightful business of appeasing wolfish
hunger, none of them saw Eshbaal halt behind a tree and observe
them. Jezebel he recognized for what she was, and a sudden fire
lighted his blue eyes. The others were enigmas to
him&mdash;especially their strange apparel.</p>

<p>Of one thing Eshbaal was convinced. He had found his lost kid
and there was wrath in his heart. For just a moment he watched the
three; then he glided back into the forest until he was out of
their sight, when he broke into a run.</p>

<p>The meal finished, Smith wrapped the remainder of the carcass in
the skin of the kid; and the three again took up their search for
the fissure.</p>

<p>An hour passed and then another. Still their efforts were not
crowned with success. They saw no opening in the stern, forbidding
face of the escarpment, nor did they see the slinking figures
creeping steadily nearer and nearer&mdash;a score of stocky, yellow
haired men led by Eshbaal, the Shepherd.</p>

<p>"We must have passed it," said Smith at last. "It just cannot be
this far south," yet only a hundred yards farther on lay the
illusive opening into the great fissure.</p>

<p>"We shall have to hunt for some other way out of the valley
then," said Lady Barbara. "There is a place farther south that
Jezebel and I used to see from the mouth of our cave where the
cliff looked as though it might be scaled."</p>

<p>"Let's have a try at it then," said Smith. "Say, look there!" he
pointed toward the north.</p>

<p>"What is it? Where?" demanded Jezebel.</p>

<p>"I thought I saw a man's head behind that rock," said Smith.
"Yes, there he is again. Lord, look at 'em. They're all
around."</p>

<p>Eshbaal and his fellows, realizing that they were discovered,
came into the open, advancing slowly toward the three.</p>

<p>"The men of North Midian!" exclaimed Jezebel. "Are they not
beautiful!"</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" demanded Lady Barbara. "We must not let them
take us."</p>

<p>"We'll see what they want," said Smith. "They may not be
unfriendly. Anyway, we couldn't escape them by running. They would
overtake us in no time. Get behind me, and if they show any signs
of attacking I'll shoot a few of them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better go out and sit on them," suggested Lady
Barbara, wearily.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Smith, "that my marksmanship is so poor; but,
unfortunately perhaps, it never occurred to my parents to train me
in the gentle art of murder. I realize now that they erred and that
my education has been sadly neglected. I am only a school teacher,
and in teaching the young intellect to shoot I have failed to learn
to do so myself."</p>

<p>"I didn't intend to be nasty," said Lady Barbara, who detected
in the irony of the man's reply a suggestion of wounded pride.
"Please forgive me."</p>

<p>The North Midians were advancing cautiously, halting
occasionally for brief, whispered conferences. Presently one of
them spoke, addressing the three. "Who are ye?" he demanded. "What
do ye in the land of Midian?"</p>

<p>"Can you understand him?" asked Smith, over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied both girls simultaneously.</p>

<p>"He speaks the same language as Jezebel's people," explained
Lady Barbara. "He wants to know who we are and what we are doing
here."</p>

<p>"You talk to him, Lady Barbara," said Smith.</p>

<p>The English girl stepped forward. "We are strangers in Midian,"
she said. "We are lost. All we wish is to get out of your
country."</p>

<p>"There is no way out of Midian," replied the man. "Ye have
killed a kid belonging to Eshbaal. For that ye must be punished. Ye
must come with us."</p>

<p>"We were starving," explained Lady Barbara. "If we could pay for
the kid we would gladly do so. Let us go in peace."</p>

<p>The Midians held another whispered conference, after which their
spokesman addressed the three again. "Ye must come with us," he
said, "the women at least; if the man will go away we will not harm
you; we do not want him; we want the women."</p>

<p>"What did he say?" demanded Smith, and when Lady Barbara had
interpreted he shook his head. "Tell them no," he directed. "Also
tell them that if they molest us I shall have to kill them."</p>

<p>When the girl delivered this ultimatum to the Midians they
laughed. "What can one man do against twenty?" demanded their
leader, then he advanced followed by his retainers. They were
brandishing their clubs now, and some of them raised their voices
in a savage war cry.</p>

<p>"You will have to shoot," said Lady Barbara. "There are at least
twenty. You cannot miss them all."</p>

<p>"You flatter me," said Smith, as he raised his .32 and levelled
it at the advancing Midians.</p>

<p>"Go back!" shouted Jezebel, "or you will be killed," but the
attackers only came forward the faster.</p>

<p>Then Smith fired. At the sharp crack of the pistol the Midians
halted, surprised; but no one fell. Instead, the leader hurled his
club, quickly and accurately, just as Smith was about to fire
again. He dodged; but the missile struck his pistol hand a glancing
blow, sending the weapon flying&mdash;then the North Midians were
upon them.</p>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16">XVI.&mdash;TRAILING</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TARZAN OF THE APES had made a kill. It was only a
small rodent, but it would satisfy his hunger until the morrow.
Darkness had fallen shortly after he had discovered the spoor of
the missing American, and he was forced to abandon the search until
daylight came again. The first sign of the spoor had been very
faint&mdash;just the slightest imprint of one corner of a boot
heel, but that had been enough for the ape-man. Clinging to a bush
nearby was the scarcely perceptible scent spoor of a white man,
which Tarzan might have followed even after dark; but it would have
been a slow and arduous method of tracking which the ape-man did
not consider the circumstances warranted. Therefore he made his
kill, ate, and curled up in a patch of tall grass to sleep.</p>

<p>Wild beasts may not sleep with one eye open, but often it seems
that they sleep with both ears cocked. The ordinary night sounds go
unnoticed, while a lesser sound, portending danger or suggesting
the unfamiliar, may awaken them on the instant. It was a sound
falling into the latter category that awoke Tarzan shortly after
midnight.</p>

<p>He raised his head and listened, then he lowered it and placed
an ear against the ground. "Horses and men," he soliloquized as he
rose to his feet. Standing erect, his great chest rising and
falling to his breathing, he listened intently. His sensitive
nostrils, seeking to confirm the testimony of his ears, dilated to
receive and classify the messages that Usha, the wind, bore to
them. They caught the scent of Tongani, the baboon, so strong as
almost to negate the others. Tenuous, from a great distance came
the scent spoor of Sabor, the lioness, and the sweet, heavy stench
of Tantor, the elephant. One by one the ape-man read these
invisible messages brought by Usha, the wind; but only those
interested him that spoke of horses and men.</p>

<p>Why did horses and men move through the night? Who and what were
the men? He scarcely needed to ask himself that latter question,
and only the first one interested him.</p>

<p>It is the business of beasts and of men to know what their
enemies do. Tarzan stretched his great muscles lazily and moved
down the slope of the foot hills in the direction from which had
come the evidence that his enemies were afoot.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" stumbled along in the darkness. Never in his
twenty-odd years of life had he even approximated such utter
physical exhaustion. Each step he was sure must be his last. He had
long since become too tired even to curse his captors as he plodded
on, now almost numb to any sensation, his mind a chaos of dull
misery.</p>

<p>But even endless journeys must ultimately end; and at last the
cavalcade turned into the gateway of the village of Dominic
Capietro, the raider; and the "Gunner" was escorted to a hut where
he slumped to the hard earth floor after his bonds had been
removed, positive that he would never rise again.</p>

<p>He was asleep when they brought him food; but aroused himself
long enough to eat, for his hunger was fully as great as his
fatigue. Then he stretched out again and slept, while a tired and
disgusted <a title="bandit, brigand"><i>shifta</i></a> nodded
drowsily on guard outside the entrance to the hut.</p>

<p>Tarzan had come down to the cliff above the village as the
raiders were filing through the gateway. A full moon cast her
revealing beams upon the scene, lighting the figures of horses and
men. The ape-man recognized Capietro and Stabutch, he saw Ogonyo,
the headman of the safari of the young American geologist; and he
saw the "Gunner" stumbling painfully along in bonds.</p>

<p>The ape-man was an interested spectator of all that transpired
in the village below. He noted particularly the location of the hut
into which the white prisoner had been thrust. He watched the
preparation of food, and he noted the great quantities of liquor
that Capietro and Stabutch consumed while waiting for the midnight
supper being prepared by slaves. The more they drank the better
pleased was Tarzan.</p>

<p>As he watched them, he wondered how supposedly rational
creatures could consider the appellation <i>beast</i> a term of
reproach and <i>man</i> one of glorification. The beasts, as he
knew, held an opposite conception of the relative virtues of these
two orders, although they were ignorant of most of man's
asininities and degradations, their minds being far too pure to
understand them.</p>

<p>Waiting with the patience of the unspoiled primitive nervous
system, Tarzan watched from the cliff top until the village below
seemed to have settled down for the night. He saw the sentries in
the banquette inside the palisade, but he did not see the guard
squatting in the shadow of the hut where the "Gunner" lay in heavy
slumber.</p>

<p>Satisfied, the ape-man rose and moved along the cliff until he
was beyond the village; and there, where the escarpment was less
precipitous, he made his way to its base. Noiselessly and
cautiously he crept to the palisade at a point that was hidden from
the view of the sentries. The moon shone full upon him, but the
opposite side of the palisade he knew must be in dense shadow.
There he listened for a moment to assure himself that his approach
had aroused no suspicion. He wished that he might see the sentries
at the gate, for when he topped the palisade he would be in full
view for an instant. When last he had seen them they had been
squatting upon the banquette, their backs to the palisade, and
apparently upon the verge of sleep. Would they remain thus?</p>

<p>Here, however, was a chance he must take, and so he gave the
matter little thought and few regrets. What was, was; and if he
could not change it he must ignore it; and so, leaping lightly
upward, he seized the top of the palisade and drew himself up and
over. Only a glance he threw in the direction of the sentries as he
topped the barrier, a glance that told him they had not moved since
he had last looked.</p>

<p>In the shadow of the palisade he paused to look about. There was
nothing to cause him apprehension; and so he moved quickly, keeping
ever in the shadows where he could, toward the hut where he
expected to find the young white man. It was hidden from his view
by another hut which he approached and had circled when he saw the
figure of the guard sitting by the doorway, his rifle across his
knees.</p>

<p>This was a contingency the ape-man had not anticipated, and it
caused a change in his immediate plans. He drew back out of sight
behind the hut he had been circling, lay down flat upon the ground,
and then crawled forward again until his head protruded beyond the
hut far enough to permit one eye to watch the unconscious guard.
Here he lay waiting&mdash;a human beast watching its quarry.</p>

<p>For a long time he lay thus trusting to his knowledge of men
that the moment for which he waited would arrive. Presently the
chin of the <a title="bandit, brigand"><i>shifta</i></a> dropped to
his chest; but immediately it snapped back again, erect. Then the
fellow changed his position. He sat upon the ground, his legs
stretched before him, and leaned his back against the hut. His
rifle was still across his knees. It was a dangerous position for a
man who would remain awake.</p>

<p>After a while his head rolled to one side. Tarzan watched him
closely, as a cat watches a mouse. The head remained in the
position to which it had rolled, the chin dropped, and the mouth
gaped; the tempo of the breathing changed, denoting sleep.</p>

<p>Tarzan rose silently to his feet and as silently crept across
the intervening space to the side of the unconscious man. There
must be no outcry, no scuffle.</p>

<p>As strikes Histah, the snake, so struck Tarzan of the Apes.
There was only the sound of parting vertebrae as the neck broke in
the grip of those thews of steel.</p>

<p>The rifle Tarzan laid upon the ground; then he raised the corpse
in his arms and bore it into the darkness of the hut's interior.
Here he groped for a moment until he had located the body of the
sleeping white, and knelt beside him. Cautiously he shook him, one
hand ready to muffle any outcry the man might make, but the
"Gunner" did not awaken. Tarzan shook him again more roughly and
yet without results, then he slapped him heavily across the
face.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" stirred. "Geeze," he muttered "can't you let a guy
sleep? Didn't I tell you you'd get your ransom?"</p>

<p>Tarzan permitted a faint smile to touch his lips. "Wake up," he
whispered. "Make no noise. I have come to take you away."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Tarzan of the Apes."</p>

<p>"Geeze!" The "Gunner" sat up.</p>

<p>"Make no noise," cautioned the ape-man once more.</p>

<p>"Sure," whispered Danny as he raised himself stiffly to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Follow me," said Tarzan, "and no matter what happens stay very
close to me. I am going to toss you to the top of the palisade. Try
not to make any noise as you climb over, and be careful when you
drop to the ground on the other side to alight with your knees
flexed&mdash;it is a long drop."</p>

<p>"You say you're going to toss me to the top of the palisade,
guy?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you know what I weigh?"</p>

<p>"No, and I don't care. Keep still and follow me. Don't stumble
over this body." Tarzan paused in the entrance and looked about;
then he passed out, with the "Gunner" at his heels, and crossed
quickly to the palisade. Even if they discovered him now he still
had time to accomplish what he had set out to do, before they could
interfere, unless the sentries, firing on them, chanced to make a
hit; but on that score he felt little apprehension.</p>

<p>As they came to the palisade the "Gunner" glanced up, and his
skepticism increased&mdash;a fat chance any guy would have to toss
his one hundred and eighty pounds to the top of that!</p>

<p>The ape-man seized him by the collar and the seat of his
breeches. "Catch the top!" he whispered. Then he swung the "Gunner"
backward as though he had been a fifty pound sack of meal, surged
forward and upward; and in the same second Danny Patrick's
outstretched fingers clutched the top of the palisade.</p>

<p>"Geeze," he muttered, "if I'd missed I'd of gone clean over."
Catlike, the ape-man ran up the barrier and dropped to the ground
on the outside almost at the instant that the "Gunner" alighted,
and without a word started toward the cliff, where once again he
had to assist the other to reach the summit.</p>

<p>Danny "Gunner" Patrick was speechless, partly from shortness of
breath following his exertions, but more, by far, from
astonishment. Here was a guy! In all his experience of brawny men,
and it had been considerable, he had never met, nor expected to
meet, such a one as this.</p>

<p>"I have located the spoor of your friend," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"The what?" asked the "Gunner." "Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"His tracks," explained the ape-man, who was still leading the
way up the slope toward the higher mountains.</p>

<p>"I gotcha," said the "Gunner." "But you ain't seen him?"</p>

<p>"No, it was too dark to follow him when I found them. We will do
so in the morning."</p>

<p>"If I can walk," said the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" demanded Tarzan. "Injured?"</p>

<p>"I ain't got no legs from the knees down," replied Danny. "I
walked my lousy dogs off yesterday."</p>

<p>"I'll carry you," suggested Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Nix!" exclaimed Danny. "I can crawl, but I'll be damned if I'll
let any guy carry me."</p>

<p>"It will be a hard trip if you're exhausted now," the ape-man
told him. "I could leave you somewhere near here and pick you up
after I find your friend."</p>

<p>"Nothing doing. I'm going to look for old Smithy if I wear 'em
off to the hips."</p>

<p>"I could probably travel faster alone," suggested Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," agreed the "Gunner" cheerfully. "I'll tail along
behind you."</p>

<p>"And get lost."</p>

<p>"Let me come along, mister. I'm worried about that crazy
nut."</p>

<p>"All right. It won't make much difference anyway. He may be a
little hungrier when we find him, but he can't starve to death in a
couple of days."</p>

<p>"Say," exclaimed Danny, "how come you knew them guys had taken
me for a ride?"</p>

<p>"I thought you walked."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the difference? How did you know I was in that
lousy burgh of theirs?"</p>

<p>"I was on the cliff when they brought you in. I waited until
they were asleep. I am not ready to deal with them yet."</p>

<p>"What you goin' to do to them?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged but made no reply; and for a long time they
walked on in silence through the night, the ape-man timing his
speed to the physical condition of his companion, whose nerve he
was constrained to admire, though his endurance and knowledge he
viewed with contempt.</p>

<p>Far up in the hills, where he had bedded down earlier in the
night, Tarzan halted and told the "Gunner" to get what rest he
could before dawn.</p>

<p>"Geeze, them's the pleasantest words I've heard for years,"
sighed Danny, as he lay down in the high grass. "You may think
you've seen a guy pound his ear, but you ain't seen nothin'. Watch
me," and he was asleep almost before the words had left his
mouth.</p>

<p>Tarzan lay down at a little distance; and he, too, was soon
asleep, but at the first suggestion of dawn he was up. He saw that
his companion still slept, and then he slipped silently away toward
a water hole he had discovered the previous day in a rocky ravine
near the cliff where he had met the tribe of Zugash, the
tongani.</p>

<p>He kept well down the slope of the foot hills, for with the
coming of dawn the wind had changed, and he wished to come up wind
toward the water hole. He moved as silently as the disappearing
shadows of the retreating night, his nostrils quivering to catch
each vagrant scent borne upon the bosom of the early morning
breeze.</p>

<p>There was deep mud at one edge of the water hole, where the
earth had been trampled by the feet of drinking beasts; and near
here he found that which he sought, the sticky sweetness of whose
scent had been carried to his nostrils by Usha.</p>

<p>Low trees grew in the bottom of the ravine and much underbrush,
for here the earth held its moisture longer than on the ridges that
were more exposed to Kudu's merciless rays. It was a lovely sylvan
glade, nor did its beauties escape the appreciative eyes of the
ape-man, though the lure of the glade lay not this morning in its
aesthetic charms, but rather in the fact that it harbored Horta,
the boar.</p>

<p>Silently to the edge of the underbrush came the ape-man as Horta
came down to the pool to drink. Upon the opposite side stood
Tarzan, his bow and arrows ready in his hands; but the high brush
precluded a fair shot, and so the hunter stepped out in full view
of the boar. So quickly he moved that his arrow sped as Horta
wheeled to run, catching the boar in the side behind the left
shoulder&mdash;a vital spot.</p>

<p>With a snort of rage Horta turned back and charged. Straight
through the pool he came for Tarzan; and as he came three more
arrows shot with unbelievable accuracy and celerity, buried
themselves deep in the breast of the great beast. Bloody foam
flecked his jowls and his flashing tusks, fires of hate shot from
his wicked little eyes as he sought to reach the author of his
hurts and wreak his vengeance before he died.</p>

<p>Discarding his bow the ape-man met the mad charge of Horta with
his spear, for there was no chance to elude the swift rush of that
great body, hemmed, as he was, by the thick growth of underbrush.
His feet braced, he dropped the point of his weapon the instant
Horta was within its range, that Horta might have no opportunity to
dodge it or strike it aside with his tusks. Straight through the
chest it drove, deep into the savage heart, yet the beast still
strove to reach the man-thing that held it off with a strength
almost equal to its own.</p>

<p>But already as good as dead on his feet was Horta, the boar. His
brief, savage struggles ended; and he dropped in the shallow water
at the edge of the pool. Then the ape-man placed a foot upon his
vanquished foe and screamed forth the hideous challenge of his
tribe.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" sat suddenly erect, awakened out of a sound sleep.
"Geeze!" he exclaimed. "What was that?" Receiving no answer he
looked about. "Wouldn't that eat you?" he murmured. "He's went. I
wonder has he run out on me? He didn't seem like that kind of a
guy. But you can't never tell&mdash;I've had pals to double-cross
me before this."</p>

<p>In the village of Capietro a dozing sentry snapped suddenly
alert, while his companion half rose to his feet. "What was that?"
demanded one.</p>

<p>"A hairy one has made a kill," said the other.</p>

<p>Sheeta, the panther, down wind, stalking both the man and the
boar, stopped in his tracks; then he turned aside and loped away in
easy, graceful bounds; but he had not gone far before he stopped
again and raised his nose upwind. Again the scent of man; but this
time a different man, nor was there any sign of the feared thunder
stick that usually accompanied the scent spoor of the tarmangani.
Belly low, Sheeta moved slowly up the slope toward Danny "Gunner"
Patrick.</p>

<p>"What to do?" mused the "Gunner." "Geeze, I'm hungry! Should I
wait for him or should I go on? On, where? I sure got myself in a
jam all right. Where do I go? How do I eat? Hell!"</p>

<p>He arose and moved about, feeling out his muscles. They were
lame and sore, but he realized that he was much rested. Then he
scanned the distances for a sight of Tarzan and, instead, saw
Sheeta, the panther, a few hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Danny Patrick, hoodlum, racketeer, gangster, gunman, killer,
trembled in terror. Cold sweat burst from every pore, and he could
feel the hair rise on his scalp. He felt a mad impulse to run; but,
fortunately for Danny, his legs refused to move. He was literally,
in the vernacular to which he was accustomed, scared stiff. The
"Gunner," without a gun, was a very different man.</p>

<p>The panther had stopped and was surveying him. Caution and an
hereditary fear of man gave the great cat pause, but he was angry
because he had been frightened from his prey after hunting futilely
all night, and he was very, very hungry. He growled, his face
wrinkled in a hideous snarl; and Danny felt his knees giving
beneath him.</p>

<p>Then, beyond the panther, he saw the high grass moving to the
approach of another animal, which the "Gunner" promptly assumed was
the beast's mate. There was just a single, narrow strip of this
high grass; and when the animal had crossed it he, too, would see
Danny, who was confident that this would spell the end. One of them
might hesitate to attack a man&mdash;he didn't know&mdash;but he
was sure that two would not.</p>

<p>He dropped to his knees and did something that he had not done
for many years&mdash;he prayed. And then the grasses parted; and
Tarzan of the Apes stepped into view, the carcass of a boar upon
one broad shoulder. Instantly the ape-man took in the scene that
his nostrils had already prepared him for.</p>

<p>Dropping the carcass of Horta he voiced a sudden, ferocious
growl that startled Sheeta no more than it did Danny Patrick. The
cat wheeled, instantly on the defensive. Tarzan charged, growls
rumbling from his throat; and Sheeta did exactly what he had
assumed he would do&mdash;turned and fled. Then Tarzan picked up
the carcass of Horta and came up the slope to Danny, who knelt
open-mouthed and petrified.</p>

<p>"What are you kneeling for?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"I was just tying my boot lace," explained the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"Here is breakfast," said Tarzan, dropping the boar to the
ground. "Help yourself."</p>

<p>"That sure looks good to me," said Danny. "I could eat it
raw."</p>

<p>"That is fine," said Tarzan; and, squatting, he cut two strips
from one of the hams. "Here," he said, offering one to the
"Gunner."</p>

<p>"Quit your kidding," remonstrated the latter.</p>

<p>Tarzan eyed him questioningly, at the same time tearing off a
mouthful of the meat with his strong teeth. "Horta is a little bit
tough," he remarked, "but he is the best I could do without losing
a great deal of time. Why don't you eat? I thought you were
hungry."</p>

<p>"I got to cook mine," said the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"But you said you could eat it raw," the ape-man reminded
him.</p>

<p>"That's just a saying," explained the "Gunner." "I might at that
but I ain't never tried it."</p>

<p>"Make a fire, then; and cook yours," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Say," remarked Danny a few minutes later as he squatted before
his fire grilling his meat, "did you hear that noise a little while
ago?"</p>

<p>"What was it like?"</p>

<p>"I never heard nothing like it but once before&mdash;say I just
took a tumble to myself! That was you killin' the pig. I heard you
yell like that the night you killed the lion in our camp."</p>

<p>"We will be going as soon as you finish your meat," said Tarzan.
He was hacking off several pieces, half of which he handed to the
"Gunner" while he dropped the balance into his quiver. "Take
these," he said. "You may get hungry before we can make another
kill." Then he scraped a hole in the loose earth and buried the
remainder of the carcass.</p>

<p>"What you doin' that for?" asked the "Gunner." "Afraid it will
smell?"</p>

<p>"We may come back this way," explained Tarzan. "If we do Horta
will be less tough."</p>

<p>The "Gunner" made no comment; but he assured himself, mentally,
that he "wasn't no dog," to bury his meat and then dig it up again
after it had rotted. The idea almost made him sick.</p>

<p>Tarzan quickly picked up the trail of Lafayette Smith and
followed it easily, though the "Gunner" saw nothing to indicate
that human foot had ever trod these hills.</p>

<p>"I don't see nothing," he said.</p>

<p>"I have noticed that," returned Tarzan.</p>

<p>"That," thought Danny Patrick, "sounds like a dirty crack;" but
he said nothing.</p>

<p>"A lion picked up his trail here," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"You ain't spoofin' me are you?" demanded Danny. "There ain't no
sign of nothin' on this ground."</p>

<p>"Nothing that you can see perhaps," replied Tarzan; "but then,
though you may not know it, you so-called civilized men are almost
blind and quite stone deaf."</p>

<p>Soon they came to the fissure, and here Tarzan saw that the man
and the lion had both gone in, the lion following the man, and that
only the lion had come out.</p>

<p>"That looks tough for old Smithy, doesn't it?" said the "Gunner"
when Tarzan had explained the story of the spoor.</p>

<p>"It may," replied the ape-man. "I'll go on in and look for him.
You can wait here or follow. You can't get lost if you stay inside
this crack."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Danny. "I'll follow."</p>

<p>The fissure was much longer than Tarzan had imagined; but some
distance from the entrance he discovered that the lion had not
attacked Smith, for he could see where Numa had turned about and
that the man had continued on. Some recent scars on the sides of
the fissure told him the rest of the story quite accurately.</p>

<p>"It's fortunate he didn't hit Numa," soliloquized the
ape-man.</p>

<p>At the end of the fissure Tarzan had some difficulty in
wriggling through the aperture that opened into the valley of the
Land of Midian; but once through he picked up the trail of Smith
again and followed it down toward the lake, while Danny, far behind
him, stumbled wearily along the rough floor of the fissure.</p>

<p>Tarzan walked rapidly for the spoor was plain. When he came to
the shore of Chinnereth he discovered Smith's tracks intermingled
with those of a woman wearing well worn European boots and another
shod with sandals.</p>

<p>When he had first entered the valley he had seen the village of
the South Midians in the distance and now he drew the false
conclusion that Smith had discovered a friendly people and other
whites and that he was in no danger.</p>

<p>His curiosity piqued by the mystery of this hidden valley, the
ape-man determined to visit the village before continuing on
Smith's trail. Time had never entered greatly into his
calculations, trained, as he had been, by savage apes to whom time
meant less than nothing; but to investigate and to know every
detail of his wilderness world was as much a part of the man as is
his religion to a priest.</p>

<p>And so he continued rapidly on toward the distant village while
Danny Patrick still crawled and stumbled slowly along the rocky
floor of the fissure.</p>

<p>Danny was tired. Momentarily he expected to meet Tarzan
returning either with Smith or with word of his death; so he
stopped often to rest, with the result that when he had reached the
end of the fissure and crawled through to behold the mystifying
sight of a strange valley spread before him, Tarzan was already out
of sight.</p>

<p>"Geeze!" exclaimed the "Gunner." "Who would have thought that
hole led into a place like this? I wonder which way that Tarzan guy
went?"</p>

<p>This thought occupied the "Gunner" for a few minutes. He
examined the ground as he had seen Tarzan do, mistook a few spots
where some little rodent had scratched up the earth, or taken a
dust bath, for the footprints of a man, and set forth in the wrong
direction.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17">XVII.&mdash;SHE IS MINE!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE stocky, blond warriors of Elija, the son of
Noah, quickly surrounded and seized Lafayette Smith and his two
companions. Elija picked up Smith's pistol and examined it with
interest; then he dropped it into a goat skin pouch that was
suspended from the girdle that held his single garment about
him.</p>

<p>"This one," said Eshbaal, pointing to Jezebel, "is mine."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Elija, the son of Noah.</p>

<p>"I saw her first," replied Eshbaal.</p>

<p>"Did you hear what he said?" demanded Jezebel of Lady
Barbara.</p>

<p>The English girl nodded apathetically. Her brain was numb with
disappointment and the horror of the situation, for in some
respects their fate might be worse with these men than with those
of South Midian. These were lusty, primitive warriors, not
half-witted creatures whose natural passions had been weakened by
generations of hereditary disease of nerve and brain.</p>

<p>"He wants me," said Jezebel. "Is he not beautiful?"</p>

<p>Lady Barbara turned upon the girl almost angrily, and then
suddenly she remembered that Jezebel was little more than a child
in experience and that she had no conception of the fate that might
await her at the hands of the North Midians.</p>

<p>In their narrow religious fanaticism the South Midians denied
even the most obvious phases of procreation. The subject was
absolutely taboo and so hideous had ages of training and custom
made it appear to them that mothers often killed their first born
rather than exhibit these badges of sin.</p>

<p>"Poor little Jezebel," said Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Barbara?" asked the girl. "Are you not happy
that the beautiful man wants me?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Jezebel," said Lady Barbara. "You know I am your
friend, do you not?"</p>

<p>"My only friend," replied the girl. "The only person I ever
loved."</p>

<p>"Then believe me when I say that you must kill yourself, as I
shall kill myself, if we are unable to escape from these
creatures."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Jezebel. "Are they not more beautiful than the
South Midians?"</p>

<p>"Forget their fatal beauty," replied Lady Barbara, "but never
forget what I have told you."</p>

<p>"Now I am afraid," said Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Thank God for that," exclaimed the English girl.</p>

<p>The North Midians marched loosely and without discipline. They
seemed a garrulous race, and their arguments and speeches were
numerous and lengthy. Sometimes so intent did they become on some
point at argument, or in listening to a long-winded oration by one
of their fellows, that they quite forgot their prisoners, who were
sometimes amongst them, sometimes in advance and once behind
them.</p>

<p>It was what Lady Barbara had been awaiting and what she had to
some extent engineered.</p>

<p>"Now!" she whispered. "They are not looking." She halted and
turned back. They were among the trees of the forest where some
concealment might be found.</p>

<p>Smith and Jezebel had stopped at Lady Barbara's direction; and
for an instant the three paused, breathless, watching the
retreating figures of their captors.</p>

<p>"Now run!" whispered Lady Barbara. "We'll scatter and meet again
at the foot of the cliff."</p>

<p>Just what prompted Lady Barbara to suggest that they separate
Lafayette Smith did not understand. To him it seemed a foolish and
unnecessary decision; but as he had a great deal more confidence in
Lady Barbara's judgment in practical matters than in his own he did
not voice his doubts, though he accepted her plan with certain
mental reservations, which guided his subsequent acts.</p>

<p>The English girl ran in a southeasterly direction, while
Jezebel, obeying the commands of her friend, scurried off toward
the southwest. Smith, glancing to the rear, discovered no
indication that their captors had, as yet, missed them. For a
moment he was hesitant as to what course to pursue. The conviction
still gripped him that he was the natural protector of both girls,
notwithstanding the unfortunate circumstances that had nullified
his efforts to function successfully in that role; but he saw that
it was going to be still more difficult to protect them both now
that they had elected to run in different directions.</p>

<p>However, his decision was soon made, difficult though it was.
Jezebel was in her own world; contemplation of her capture by the
North Midians had, so far from alarming her, appeared rather to
have met with enthusiastic anticipation on her part; she could not
be worse off with them than the only other people she knew.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara, on the other hand, was of another world&mdash;his
own world&mdash;and he had heard her say that death would be
preferable to captivity among these semi-savages. His duty,
therefore, was to follow and protect Lady Barbara; and so he let
Jezebel take her way unprotected back toward the cliff, while he
pursued the English girl in the direction of Chinnereth.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara Collis ran until she was out of breath. For several
minutes she had distinctly heard the sounds of pursuit behind
her&mdash;the heavy footfalls of a man. Frantic from hopelessness,
she drew her pocket knife from a pocket of her jacket and opened
the blade as she ran.</p>

<p>She wondered if she could destroy herself with this inadequate
weapon. She was positive that she could not inflict either fatal or
disabling injuries upon her pursuer with it. Yet the thought of
self-destruction revolted her. The realization was upon her that
she had about reached the limit of her endurance, and that the
fatal decision could not be long averted, when her heritage of
English fighting blood decided the question for her. There was but
one thing it would permit&mdash;she must stand and defend herself.
She stopped then, suddenly, and wheeled about, the little knife
clutched in her right hand&mdash;a tigress at bay.</p>

<p>When she saw Lafayette Smith running toward her she collapsed
suddenly and sank to the ground, where she sat with her back
against the bole of a tree. Lafayette Smith, breathing hard, came
and sat down beside her. Neither had any breath for words.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara was the first to regain her power of speech. "I
thought I said we would scatter," she reminded him.</p>

<p>"I couldn't leave you alone," he replied.</p>

<p>"But how about Jezebel? You left her alone."</p>

<p>"I couldn't go with both of you," he reminded her, "and you know
Jezebel is really at home here. It means much more to you to escape
than it means to her."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Capture means the same thing to either of
us," she said, "But of the two I am better able to take care of
myself than Jezebel&mdash;she does not understand the nature of her
danger."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," he insisted, "you are the more important. You
have relatives and friends who care for you. Poor little Jezebel
has only one friend, and that is you, unless I may consider myself
a friend, as I should like to do."</p>

<p>"I imagine we three have the unique distinction of being the
closest corporation of friends in the world," she replied, with a
wan smile, "and there doesn't seem to be anyone who wants to buy
in."</p>

<p>"The Friendless Friends Corporation, Limited," he suggested.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'd best hold a directors' meeting and decide what we
should do next to conserve the interests of the stockholders."</p>

<p>"I move we move," he said.</p>

<p>"Seconded." The girl rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"You're terribly tired, aren't you?" he asked. "But I suppose
the only thing we can do is to get as far away from the territory
of the North Midians as possible. It's almost certain they will try
to capture us again as soon as they discover we are missing."</p>

<p>"If we can only find a place to hide until night," she said.
"Then we can go back to the cliffs under the cover of darkness and
search for Jezebel and the place that she and I thought might be
scaled."</p>

<p>"This forest is so open that it doesn't afford any good hiding
places, but at least we can look."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall find a place near the lake," said Lady
Barbara. "We ought to come to it soon."</p>

<p>They walked on for a considerable distance without talking, each
occupied with his own thoughts; and as no sign of pursuit developed
their spirits rose.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said presently, "that I can't help but feel
that we're going to get out of this all right in the end?"</p>

<p>"But what a terrible experience! It doesn't seem possible that
such things could have happened to me. I can't forget Jobab." It
was the first time mention had been made of the tragedy at the
southern village.</p>

<p>"You must not give that a thought," he said. "You did the only
thing possible under the circumstances. If you had not done what
you did both you and Jezebel would have been recaptured, and you
know what that would have meant."</p>

<p>"But I've killed a human being," she said. There was an awed
tone in her voice.</p>

<p>"I killed one, too," he reminded her, "but I don't regret it in
the least, notwithstanding the fact that I never killed anyone
before. If I were not such a terrible marksman I should have killed
another today, perhaps several. My regret is that I didn't."</p>

<p>"It's a strange world," he continued after a moment's reflective
silence. "Now, I always considered myself rather well educated and
fitted to meet the emergencies of life; and I suppose I should be,
in the quiet environment of a college town; but what an awful
failure I have proved to be when jolted out of my narrow little
rut. I used to feel sorry for the boys who wasted their time in
shooting galleries and in rabbit hunting. Men who boasted of their
marksmanship merited only my contempt, yet within the last
twenty-four hours I would have traded all my education along other
lines for the ability to shoot straight."</p>

<p>"One should know something of many things to be truly educated,"
said the girl, "but I'm afraid you exaggerate the value of
marksmanship in determining one's cultural status."</p>

<p>"Well, there's cooking," he admitted. "A person who cannot cook
is not well educated. I had hoped one day to be an authority on
geology; but with all I know of the subject, which of course isn't
so much at that, I would probably starve to death in a land
overrunning with game, because I can neither shoot nor cook."</p>

<p>Lady Barbara laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't develop an inferiority complex at this stage," she cried.
"We need every ounce of self-assurance that we can muster. I think
you are top hole. You may not be much of a marksman&mdash;that I'll
have to admit, and perhaps you cannot cook; but you've one thing
that covers a multitude of shortcomings in a man&mdash;you are
brave."</p>

<p>It was Lafayette Smith's turn to laugh. "That's mighty nice of
you," he said. "I'd rather you thought that of me than anything
else in the world; and I'd rather you thought it than any one else,
because it would mean so much to you now; but it isn't true. I was
scared stiff in that village last night and when those fellows came
at us today, and that's the truth."</p>

<p>"Which only the more definitely justifies my statement," she
replied.</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Cultured and intelligent people are more ready to realize and
appreciate the dangers of a critical situation than are ignorant,
unimaginative types. So, when such a person stands his ground
determinedly in the face of danger, or voluntarily walks into a
dangerous situation from a sense of duty, as you did last night, it
evidences a much higher quality of courage than that possessed by
the ignorant, physical lout who hasn't brains enough to visualize
the contingencies that may result from his action."</p>

<p>"Be careful," he warned her, "or you'll make me believe all
that&mdash;then I'll be unbearably egotistical. But please don't
try to convince me that my inability to cook is a hallmark of
virtue."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;listen! What was that?" she halted and turned her eyes
toward the rear.</p>

<p>"They have found us," said Lafayette Smith. "Go on&mdash;go as
fast as you can! I'll try to delay them."</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "there is no use. I'll remain with you,
whatever happens."</p>

<p>"Please!" he begged. "Why should I face them if you won't take
advantage of it."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do any good," she said. "They'd only get me later,
and your sacrifice would be useless. We might as well give
ourselves up in the hope that we can persuade them to free us
later, or, perhaps, find the opportunity to escape after dark."</p>

<p>"You had better run," he said, "because I am going to fight. I
am not going to let them take you without raising a hand in your
defense. If you get away now, perhaps I can get away later. We can
meet at the foot of the cliffs&mdash;but don't wait for me if you
can find a way out. Now, do as I tell you!" His tone was
peremptory&mdash;commanding.</p>

<p>Obediently she continued on toward Chinnereth, but presently she
stopped and turned. Three men were approaching Smith. Suddenly one
of the three swung his club and hurled it at the American, at the
same instant dashing forward with his fellows.</p>

<p>The club fell short of its mark, dropping at Smith's feet. She
saw him stoop and seize it, and then she saw another detachment of
the Midians coming through the woods in the wake of the first
three.</p>

<p>Smith's antagonists were upon him as he straightened up with the
club in his hand, and he swung it heavily upon the skull of the man
who had hurled it at him and who had rushed forward in advance of
his fellows with hands outstretched to seize the stranger.</p>

<p>Like a felled ox the man dropped; and then Lady Barbara saw
Smith carry the unequal battle to the enemy as, swinging the club
above his head, he rushed forward to meet them.</p>

<p>So unexpected was his attack that the men halted and turned to
elude him, but one was too slow and the girl heard the fellow's
skull crush beneath the heavy blow of the bludgeon.</p>

<p>Then the reinforcements, advancing at a run, surrounded and
overwhelmed their lone antagonist, and Smith went down beneath
them.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara could not bring herself to desert the man who had
thus bravely, however hopelessly, sought to defend her; and when
the North Midians had disarmed and secured Smith they saw her
standing where she had stood during the brief engagement.</p>

<p>"I couldn't run away and leave you," she explained to Smith, as
the two were being escorted toward the village of the North
Midians. "I thought they were going to kill you, and I couldn't
help you&mdash;Oh, it was awful. I couldn't leave you then, could
I?"</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment. "No," he answered. "<i>You</i>
couldn't."</p>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18">XVIII.&mdash;A GUY AND A SKIRT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DANNY "GUNNER" PATRICK was tired and disgusted. He
had walked for several hours imagining that he was following a
spoor, but he had seen nothing of his erstwhile companion. He was
thirsty, and so cast frequent glances in the direction of the
lake.</p>

<p>"Hell!" he muttered. "I ain't goin' to tail that guy no longer
till I get me a drink. My mouth feels like I'd been eating cotton
for a week."</p>

<p>He turned away from the cliffs and started down in the direction
of the lake, the inviting waters of which sparkled alluringly in
the afternoon sun; but the beauties of the scene were wasted upon
the "Gunner," who saw only a means of quenching his thirst.</p>

<p>The way led through a field of scattered boulders fallen from
the towering rim above. He had to pick his way carefully among the
smaller ones, and his eyes were almost constantly upon the ground.
Occasionally he was compelled to skirt some of the larger masses,
many of which towered above his head obstructing his view
ahead.</p>

<p>He was damning Africa in general and this section of it in
particular as he rounded the corner of an unusually large fragment
of rock, when suddenly he stopped and his eyes went wide.</p>

<p>"Geeze!" he exclaimed aloud. "A broad!"</p>

<p>Before him, and coming in his direction, was a golden haired
girl attired in a single, scant piece of rough material. She saw
him simultaneously and halted.</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Jezebel with a happy smile. "Who art thou?" but
as she spoke in the language of the land of Midian the "Gunner"
failed to understand her.</p>

<p>"Geeze," he said. "I knew I must of come to Africa for
something, and I guess you're it. Say kid, you're about all right.
I'll tell the world you <i>are</i> all right."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Jezebel in English. "I am so glad that you
like me."</p>

<p>"Geeze," said Danny. "You talk United States, don't you? Where
you from?"</p>

<p>"Midian," replied Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Ain't never heard of it. What you doin' here? Where're your
people?"</p>

<p>"I am waiting for Lady Barbara," replied the girl, "and Smith,"
she added.</p>

<p>"Smith! What Smith?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is beautiful," confided Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Then he ain't the Smith I'm lookin' for," said the "Gunner."
"What's he doin' here, and who's this Lady Barbara dame?"</p>

<p>"Abraham, the son of Abraham, would have killed Lady Barbara and
Jezebel if Smith had not come and saved us. He is very brave."</p>

<p>"Now I know it ain't my Smith," said Danny, "though I ain't
sayin' he ain't got guts. What I mean is he wouldn't know how to
save no one&mdash;he's a geologist."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Call me Danny, kid."</p>

<p>"My name is not kid," she explained sweetly. "It is
Jezebel."</p>

<p>"Jezebel! Geeze, what a monicker! You look like it ought to be
Gwendolyn."</p>

<p>"It is Jezebel," she assured him. "Do you know who I hoped you'd
be?"</p>

<p>"No. Now just tell me, kid, who you supposed I was. Probably
President Hoover or Big Bill Thompson, eh?"</p>

<p>"I do not know them," said Jezebel. "I hoped that you were the
'Gunner.'"</p>

<p>"The 'Gunner'? What do you know about the 'Gunner,' kid?"</p>

<p>"My name is not kid, it is Jezebel," she corrected him,
sweetly.</p>

<p>"Oke, Jez," conceded Danny, "but tell me who wised you up to the
'Gunner' bozo."</p>

<p>"My name is not Jez, it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure kid, it's Jezebel&mdash;that's oke by me; but how
about the 'Gunner'?"</p>

<p>"What about him?"</p>

<p>"I just been a-askin' you."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand your language," explained Jezebel. "It
sounds like English, but it is not the English Lady Barbara taught
me."</p>

<p>"It ain't English," Danny assured her, seriously; "it's United
States."</p>

<p>"It is quite like English though, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the "Gunner." "The only difference is we can
understand English but the English don't never seem to understand
all of ours. I guess they're dumb."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; they're not dumb," Jezebel assured him. "Lady Barbara
is English, and she can talk quite as well as you."</p>

<p>Danny scratched his head. "I didn't say they was dummies. I said
they was dumb. Dummies can't talk only with their mitts. If a guy's
dumb, he don't know nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Jezebel.</p>

<p>"But what I asked you is, who wised you up to this 'Gunner'
bozo?"</p>

<p>"Can you say it in English, please," asked Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Geeze, what could be plainer? I asked who told you about the
'Gunner' and what did they tell you?"</p>

<p>Danny was waxing impatient.</p>

<p>"Smith told us. He said the 'Gunner' was a friend of his; and
when I saw you I thought you must be Smith's friend, hunting for
him."</p>

<p>"Now, what do you know about that!" exclaimed Danny.</p>

<p>"I have just told you what I know about it," explained the girl;
"but perhaps you did not understand me. Perhaps you are what you
call dumb."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to kid me, kid?" demanded the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"My name is not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, all right. I know what your name is."</p>

<p>"Then why do you not call me by my name? Do you not like
it?"</p>

<p>"Sure, kid&mdash;I mean Jezebel&mdash;sure I like it. It's a
swell handle when you get used to it. But tell me, where is old
Smithy?"</p>

<p>"I do not know such a person."</p>

<p>"But you just told me you did."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," cried Jezebel. "Smithy is the United States for
Smith. But Smith is not old. He's quite young."</p>

<p>"Well, where is he?" demanded Danny, resignedly.</p>

<p>"We were captured by the beautiful men from North Midian,"
explained Jezebel; "but we escaped and ran away. We ran in
different directions, but we are going to meet tonight farther
south along the cliffs."</p>

<p>"Beautiful men?" demanded the "Gunner." "Did old Smithy let a
bunch of fairies hoist him?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Jezebel.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> wouldn't," he assured her; "but say, kid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, forget it&mdash;you know who I mean. As I was saying, let's
me and you stick together till we find old Smithy. What say?"</p>

<p>"That would be nice, 'Gunner,'" she assured him.</p>

<p>"Say, call me Danny, k&mdash;Jezebel."</p>

<p>"Yes, Danny."</p>

<p>"Geeze, I never knew Danny was such a swell monicker till I
heard you say it. What say we beat it for the big drink down there?
I got me such a thirst my tongue's hanging out. Then we can come
back to this here rock pile and look for old Smithy."</p>

<p>"That will be nice," agreed Jezebel. "I, too, am thirsty." She
sighed. "You can not know how happy I am, Danny."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because you are with me."</p>

<p>"Geeze, k&mdash;Jezebel, but you're sure a fast worker."</p>

<p>"I do not know what you mean," she replied, innocently.</p>

<p>"Well just tell me why you're happy because I'm with you."</p>

<p>"It is because I feel safe with you after what Smith told us. He
said he always felt safe when you were around."</p>

<p>"So that's it? All you want is a protection guy, eh? You don't
like me for myself at all, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course I like you, Danny," cried the girl. "I think you
are beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yeah? Well, listen, sister. You may be a swell kidder&mdash;I
dunno&mdash;or you may be just a dumb egg&mdash;but don't call me
no names. I know what my pan looks like; and it ain't beautiful,
and I ain't never wore a beret."</p>

<p>Jezebel, who only caught the occasional high-spots of Danny's
conversation, made no reply, and they walked on in the direction of
the lake, in silence, for some time. The forest was some little
distance away, on their left, and they had no knowledge of what was
transpiring there, nor did any sound reach their ears to acquaint
them with the misfortune that was befalling Lady Barbara and
Lafayette Smith.</p>

<p>At the lake they quenched their thirst, after which the "Gunner"
announced that he was going to rest for a while before he started
back toward the cliffs. "I wonder," he said, "just how far a guy
can walk, because in the last two days I've walked that far and
back again."</p>

<p>"How far is that?" inquired Jezebel.</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment and then shook his head. "It's twice
as far," he said, as he stretched himself at full length and closed
his eyes. "Geeze, but I'm about all in," he murmured.</p>

<p>"In what?"</p>

<p>He deigned no reply, and presently the girl noted from his
altered breathing that he was asleep. She sat with her eyes glued
upon him, and occasionally a deep sigh broke from her lips. She was
comparing Danny with Abraham, the son of Abraham, with Lafayette
Smith and with the beautiful men of North Midian; and the
comparison was not uncomplimentary to Danny.</p>

<p>The hot sun was beating down upon them, for there was no shade
here; and presently its effects, combined with her fatigue, made
her drowsy. She lay down near the "Gunner" and stretched
luxuriously. Then she, too, fell asleep.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" did not sleep very long; the sun was too hot. When
he awoke he raised himself on an elbow and looked around. His eyes
fell on the girl and there they rested for some time, noting the
graceful contours of the lithe young body, the wealth of golden
hair, and the exquisite face.</p>

<p>"The kid's sure some looker," soliloquized Danny. "I seen a
lotta broads in my day, but I ain't never seen nothin' could touch
her. She'd sure be a swell number dolled up in them Boul Mich rags.
Geeze, wouldn't she knock their lamps out! I wonder where this
Midian burgh is she says she comes from. If they's all as swell
lookin' as her, that's the burgh for me."</p>

<p>Jezebel stirred and he reached over and shook her on the
shoulder. "We'd better be beatin' it," he said. "We don't want to
miss old Smithy and that dame."</p>

<p>Jezebel sat up and looked about her. "Oh," she exclaimed, "you
frightened me. I thought something was coming."</p>

<p>"Why? Been dreaming?"</p>

<p>"No. You said we'd have to beat something."</p>

<p>"Aw, cheese it! I meant we'd have to be hittin' the trail for
the big rocks."</p>

<p>Jezebel looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Hike back to them cliffs where you said old Smithy and that
Lady Barbara dame were going to meet you."</p>

<p>"Now I understand," said Jezebel. "All right, come on." But when
they reached the cliffs there was no sign of Smith or Lady Barbara,
and at Jezebel's suggestion they walked slowly southward in the
direction of the place where she and the English girl had hoped to
make a crossing to the outer world.</p>

<p>"How did you get into the valley, Danny?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"I come through a big crack in the mountain," he replied.</p>

<p>"That must be the same place Smith came through," she said.
"Could you find it again?"</p>

<p>"Sure. That's where I'm headed for now."</p>

<p>It was only mid-afternoon when Danny located the opening into
the fissure. They had seen nothing of Lady Barbara and Smith, and
they were in a quandary as to what was best to do.</p>

<p>"Maybe they come along and made their getaway while we was
hittin' the hay," suggested Danny.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about," said Jezebel, "but
what I think is that they may have located the opening while we
were asleep and gone out of the valley."</p>

<p>"Well ain't that what I said?" demanded Danny.</p>

<p>"It didn't sound like it."</p>

<p>"Say, you trying to high hat me?"</p>

<p>"High hat?"</p>

<p>"Aw, what's the use?" growled the "Gunner," disgustedly. "Let's
you and me beat it out of this here dump and look for old Smithy
and the skirt on the other side. What say?"</p>

<p>"But suppose they haven't gone out?"</p>

<p>"Well, then we'll have to come back again; but I'm sure they
must have. See this foot print?" he indicated one of his own, made
earlier in the day, which pointed toward the valley. "I guess I'm
getting good," he said. "Pretty soon that Tarzan guy won't have no
edge on me at all."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see what's on the other side of the cliffs," said
Jezebel. "I have always wanted to do that."</p>

<p>"Well, you won't see nothin' much," he assured her. "Just some
more scenery. They ain't even a hot dog stand or a single
speakeasy."</p>

<p>"What are those?"</p>

<p>"Well, you might call 'em filling stations."</p>

<p>"What are filling stations?"</p>

<p>"Geeze, kid, what do you think I am, a college perfessor? I
never saw anyone who could ask so many questions in my whole
life."</p>

<p>"My name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what your name is. Now come on and we'll crawl
through this hole-in-the-wall. I'll go first. You follow right
behind me."</p>

<p>The rough going along the rocky floor of the fissure taxed the
"Gunner's" endurance and his patience, but Jezebel was all
excitement and anticipation. All her life she had dreamed of what
might lie in the wonderful world beyond the cliffs.</p>

<p>Her people had told her that it was a flat expanse filled with
sin, heresy, and iniquity, where, if one went too far he would
surely fall over the edge and alight in the roaring flames of an
eternal Hades; but Jezebel had been a doubter. She had preferred to
picture it as a land of flowers and trees and running water, where
beautiful people laughed and sang through long, sunny days. Soon
she was to see for herself, and she was much excited by the
prospect.</p>

<p>And now at last they came to the end of the great fissure and
looked out across the rolling foot hills toward a great forest in
the distance.</p>

<p>Jezebel clasped her hands together in ecstasy. "Oh, Danny," she
cried, "how beautiful it is!"</p>

<p>"What?" asked the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"Oh, everything. Don't you think it is beautiful, Danny?"</p>

<p>"The only beautiful thing around here, k&mdash;Jezebel, is you,"
said Danny.</p>

<p>The girl turned and looked up at him with her great blue eyes.
"Do you think I am beautiful, Danny?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am <i>too</i> beautiful?"</p>

<p>"There ain't no such thing," he replied, "but if they was you're
it. What made you ask?"</p>

<p>"Lady Barbara said I was."</p>

<p>The "Gunner" considered this for some moments, "I guess she's
right at that, kid."</p>

<p>"You like to call me Kid, don't you?" asked Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems more friendly-like," he explained, "and it's
easier to remember."</p>

<p>"All right, you may call me Kid if you want to, but my name is
Jezebel."</p>

<p>"That's a bet," said Danny. "When I don't think to call you
Jezebel, I'll call you kid, Sister."</p>

<p>The girl laughed. "You're a funny man, Danny. You like to say
everything wrong. I'm not your sister, of course."</p>

<p>"And I'm damn glad you ain't, kid."</p>

<p>"Why? Don't you like me?"</p>

<p>Danny laughed. "I never seen a kid like you before," he said.
"You sure got me guessin'. But at that," he added, a little
seriously for him, "they's one thing I ain't guessin' about and
that's that you're a good little kid."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about," said Jezebel.</p>

<p>"And at that I'll bet you don't," he replied; "and now kid,
let's sit down and rest. I'm tired."</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," said Jezebel.</p>

<p>"I ain't never see a skirt that wasn't, but why did you have to
bring that up? I'm so hungry I could eat hay."</p>

<p>"Smith killed a kid and we ate some of that," said Jezebel. "He
wrapped the rest up in the skin and I suppose he lost it when the
North Midians attacked us. I wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say," exclaimed Danny, "what a dumb-bell I am!" He reached down
into one of his pockets and brought out several strips of raw meat.
"Here I been packin' this around all day and forgets all about
it&mdash;and me starvin' to death."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Jezebel, leaning closer to inspect the
unsavory morsels.</p>

<p>"It's pig," said Danny as he started searching for twigs and dry
grass to build a fire, "and I know where they is a lot more that I
thought I couldn't never eat but I know now I could&mdash;even if I
had to fight with the maggots for it."</p>

<p>Jezebel helped him gather wood, which was extremely scarce,
being limited to dead branches of a small variety of artemisia that
grew on the mountain side; but at length they had collected quite a
supply, and presently they were grilling pieces of the boar meat
over the flames. So preoccupied were they that neither saw three
horsemen draw rein at the top of a ridge a mile away and survey
them.</p>

<p>"This is like housekeeping, ain't it?" remarked the
"Gunner."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Jezebel.</p>

<p>"That's where a guy and his girl friend get hitched and go to
doin' their own cooking. Only in a way this is better&mdash;they
ain't goin' to be no dishes to wash."</p>

<p>"What is hitched, Danny?" asked Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er," Danny flushed. He had said many things to many
girls in his life, many of them things that might have brought a
blush to the cheek of a wooden Indian; but this was the first time,
perhaps, that Danny had felt any embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er," he repeated, "hitched means married."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Jezebel. She was silent for a while, watching the
pork sizzling over the little flames. Then she looked up at Danny.
"I think housekeeping is fun," she said.</p>

<p>"So do I," agreed Danny; "with you," he added and his voice was
just a trifle husky. His eyes were on her; and there was a strange
light in them, that no other girl had ever seen there. "You're a
funny little kid," he said presently. "I never seen one like you
before," and then the neglected pork fell off the end of the
sharpened twig, with which be had been holding it, and tumbled into
the fire.</p>

<p>"Geeze!" exclaimed Danny. "Look at that!" He fished the unsavory
looking morsel from the ashes and flames and surveyed it. "It don't
look so good, but I'm goin' to fool it. I'm goin' to eat it anyway.
I wouldn't care if a elephant had sat on it for a week&mdash;I'd
eat it, and the elephant, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" cried Jezebel. "Here come some men and they are all
black. What strange beasts are they sitting on? Oh, Danny, I am
afraid."</p>

<p>At her first exclamation the "Gunner" had turned and leaped to
his feet. A single look told him who the strangers were&mdash;no
strangers to him.</p>

<p>"Beat it, kid!" he cried. "Duck back into the crack, and hit the
trail for the valley. They can't follow you on gee-gees."</p>

<p>The three <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> were
already close; and when they saw that they had been discovered they
spurred forward at a gallop, and yet Jezebel stood beside the
little fire, wide-eyed and frightened. She had not understood the
strange argot that the "Gunner" employed in lieu of English. "Beat
it" and "duck" and "hit the trail" had not been included in the
English idiom she had gleaned from Lady Barbara Collis. But even
had she understood him it would have made no difference, for
Jezebel was not of the clay that is soft in the face of danger, her
little feet not of the kind that run away, leaving a companion in
distress.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" glanced behind him and saw her. "For God's sake
run, kid," he cried. "These are tough guys. I know 'em," then the
<a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> were upon him.</p>

<p>To conserve ammunition, which was always scarce and difficult to
obtain, they tried to ride him down, striking at him with their
rifles. He dodged the leading horseman; and as the fellow reined in
to wheel his mount back to the attack, the "Gunner" leaped to his
side and dragged him from the saddle. The mount of a second
<a title="bandit, brigand"><i>shifta</i></a> stumbled over the two
men and fell, unhorsing its rider.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" seized the long rifle that had fallen from the
hands of the man he had dragged down and scrambled to his feet.
Jezebel watched him in wide-eyed wonder and admiration. She saw him
swing the rifle like a club and strike at the third horseman, and
then she saw the one he had first grappled lunge forward and,
seizing him around the legs, drag him down, while the second to be
unhorsed ran in now and leaped upon him just as the remaining
<a title="bandit, brigand"><i>shifta</i></a> struck him a heavy
blow on the head.</p>

<p>As she saw him fall, the blood gushing from an ugly wound in his
head, Jezebel ran forward to him; but the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> seized her. She was thrown
to the back of a horse in front of one of them, the others mounted,
and the three galloped away with their prisoner, leaving Danny
"Gunner" Patrick lying motionless in a welter of his own blood.</p>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19">XIX.&mdash;IN THE VILLAGE OF
ELIJA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Tarzan approached the village of Abraham, the
son of Abraham, he was seen by a watcher who immediately warned his
fellows, with the result that when the ape-man arrived the huts
were deserted, the villagers having taken refuge in the caves in
the face of the towering cliff.</p>

<p>Abraham, the son of Abraham, from the safety of the highest
cave, exhorted his people to repel the advance of this strange
creature, whose partial nakedness and strange armament filled him
with alarm, with the result that when Tarzan came near the base of
the cliff the villagers, with much shouting, rolled rocks down the
steep declivity in an effort to destroy him.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Jungle looked up at the howling creatures above
him. Whatever his emotions his face did not reveal them. Doubtless
contempt was predominant, for he read in their reception of him
only fear and cowardice.</p>

<p>As naught but curiosity had prompted his visit to this strange
village, since he knew that Smith already had quitted it, he
remained only long enough for a brief survey of the people and
their culture, neither of which was sufficiently attractive to
detain him; and then he turned and retraced his steps toward the
place on the shore of Chinnereth where he had picked up the
northbound spoor of Smith and Lady Barbara and Jezebel.</p>

<p>He made his way in a leisurely manner, stopping beside the lake
to quench his thirst and eat from his small store of boar meat; and
then he lay down to rest, after the manner of beasts who have fed
and are not hurried.</p>

<p>In the village he had quitted Abraham, the son of Abraham, gave
thanks to Jehovah for their deliverance from the barbarian, though
reserving proper credit to himself for his masterly defense of his
flock.</p>

<p>And how fared it with Lady Barbara and Lafayette Smith?
Following their recapture they were permitted no second opportunity
to escape, as, heavily guarded, they were conducted northward
toward the village of Elija, the son of Noah.</p>

<p>The girl was much depressed; and Smith sought to reassure her,
though upon what grounds he himself could scarcely explain.</p>

<p>"I cannot believe that they intend to harm us," he said. "We
have done nothing worse than kill one of their goats and that only
because we were starving. I can pay them whatever price they name
for the animal, and thus they will be recompensed and have no
further cause for complaint against us."</p>

<p>"With what will you pay them?" asked Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"I have money," replied Smith.</p>

<p>"Of what good would it be to them?"</p>

<p>"Of what good would it be to them! Why they could buy another
goat if they wanted to," he replied.</p>

<p>"These people know nothing of money," she said. "It would be
worthless to them."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," he admitted. "I hadn't thought of
that. Well, I could give them my pistol, then."</p>

<p>"They already have it."</p>

<p>"But it's mine," he exclaimed. "They'll have to give it back to
me."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "You are not dealing with civilized people
guided by the codes and customs of civilization or responsible to
the law enforcing agencies with which we are familiar and which,
perhaps, are all that keep us civilized."</p>

<p>"We escaped once," he ventured; "perhaps we can escape
again."</p>

<p>"That, I think, is our only hope."</p>

<p>The village of the North Midians, where they presently arrived,
was more pretentious than that of the people at the southern end of
the valley. While there were many crude huts there were also
several of stone, while the entire appearance of the village was
more cleanly and prosperous.</p>

<p>Several hundred villagers came to meet the party as soon as it
was sighted, and the prisoners noted that there was no evidence of
the degeneracy and disease which were such marked characteristics
of the South Midians. On the contrary, these people appeared
endowed with abundant health, they looked intelligent and,
physically, they were a splendid race, many of them being handsome.
All were golden haired and blue eyed. That they were descended from
the same stock that had produced Abraham, the son of Abraham, and
his degraded flock would have appeared impossible, yet such was the
fact.</p>

<p>The women and children pushed and jostled one another and the
men in their efforts to get close to the prisoners. They jabbered
and laughed incessantly, the clothing of the prisoners seeming to
arouse the greatest wonder and mirth.</p>

<p>Their language being practically the same as that of the South
Midians Lady Barbara had no difficulty in understanding what they
were saying, and from scraps of their conversation which she
overheard she realized that her worst fears might be realized.
However, the crowd offered them no personal injury; and it was
apparent that in themselves they were not inherently a cruel
people, though their religion and their customs evidently
prescribed harsh treatment for enemies who fell into their
hands.</p>

<p>Upon arrival in the village Lady Barbara and Smith were
separated. She was taken to a hut and put in charge of a young
woman, while Smith was confined, under guard of several men, in
another.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara's jailer, far from being ill favored, was quite
beautiful, bearing a strong resemblance to Jezebel; and she proved
to be quite as loquacious as the men who had captured them.</p>

<p>"You are the strangest looking South Midian I ever saw," she
remarked, "and the man does not look at all like one. Your hair is
neither the color of those they keep nor of those they
destroy&mdash;it is just between, and your garments are such as no
one ever saw before."</p>

<p>"We are not Midians," said Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"But that is impossible," cried the woman. "There are none but
Midians in the land of Midian and no way to get in or out. Some say
there are people beyond the great cliffs, and some say there are
only devils. If you are not a Midian perhaps you are a devil; but
then, of course, you are a Midian."</p>

<p>"We come from a country beyond the cliffs," Lady Barbara told
her, "and all we want is to go back to our own country."</p>

<p>"I do not think Elija will let you. He will treat you as we
always treat South Midians."</p>

<p>"And how is that?"</p>

<p>"The men are put to death because of their heresy; and the
women, if they are good looking, are kept as slaves. But being a
slave is not bad. I am a slave. My mother was a slave. She was a
South Midian who was captured by my father who owned her. She was
very beautiful. After a while the South Midians would have killed
her, as you do to all your beautiful women just before their first
child is born.</p>

<p>"But we are different. We kill the bad looking ones, both boys
and girls, and also any who become subject to the strange demons
which afflict the South Midians. Do you have these demons?"</p>

<p>"I am not a Midian, I told you," said Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>The woman shook her head. "It is true that you do not look like
them, but if Elija ever believes you are not you are lost."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"Elija is one of those who believe that the world beyond the
cliffs is inhabited by demons; so, if you are not a South Midian,
you must be a demon; and he would certainly destroy you as he will
destroy the man; but for my part I am one of those who say they do
not know. Some say that perhaps this world around Midian is
inhabited by angels. Are you an angel?"</p>

<p>"I am not a demon," replied Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"Then you must be a South Midian or an angel."</p>

<p>"I am no South Midian," insisted the English girl.</p>

<p>"Then you are an angel," reasoned the woman. "And if you are you
will have no difficulty in proving it."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Just perform a miracle."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"Is the man an angel?" demanded the woman.</p>

<p>"He is an American."</p>

<p>"I never heard of that&mdash;is it a kind of angel?"</p>

<p>"Europeans do not call them that."</p>

<p>"But really I think Elija will say he is a South Midian, and he
will be destroyed."</p>

<p>"Why do your people hate the South Midians so?" asked Lady
Barbara.</p>

<p>"They are heretics."</p>

<p>"They are very religious," said Lady Barbara; "they pray all the
time to Jehovah and they never smile. Why do you think them
heretics?"</p>

<p>"They insist that Paul's hair was black, while we know that it
was yellow. They are very wicked, blasphemous people. Once, long
before the memory of man, we were all one people; but there were
many wicked heretics among us who had black hair and wished to kill
all those with yellow hair; so those with yellow hair ran away and
came to the north end of the valley. Ever since, the North Midians
have killed all those with black hair and the South Midians all
those with yellow hair. Do you think Paul had yellow hair?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do," said Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"That will be a point in your favor," said the woman.</p>

<p>Just then a man came to the door of the hut and summoned Lady
Barbara. "Come with me," he commanded.</p>

<p>The English girl followed the messenger, and the woman who had
been guarding her accompanied them. Before a large stone hut they
found Elija surrounded by a number of the older men of the village,
while the remainder of the population was grouped in a semi-circle
facing them. Lafayette Smith stood before Elija, and Lady Barbara
was conducted to the side of the American.</p>

<p>Elija, the Prophet, was a middle aged man of not unprepossessing
appearance. He was short and stocky, extremely muscular in build,
and his face was adorned with a wealth of blond whiskers. Like the
other North Midians he was garbed in a single garment of goat skin,
his only ornament being the pistol he had taken from Smith, which
he wore on a leather thong that encircled his neck.</p>

<p>"This man," said Elija, addressing Lady Barbara, "will not talk.
He maketh noises, but they mean nothing. Why will he not talk?"</p>

<p>"He does not understand the language of the land of Midian,"
replied the English girl.</p>

<p>"He must understand it," insisted Elija; "everyone understands
it."</p>

<p>"He is not from Midian," said Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"Then he must be a demon," said Elija.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is an angel," suggested Lady Barbara; "he believes
that Paul's hair was yellow."</p>

<p>This statement precipitated a wordy argument and so impressed
Elija and his apostles that they withdrew into the interior of the
hut for a secret conference.</p>

<p>"What's it all about, Lady Barbara?" asked Smith, who, of
course, had understood nothing of what had been said.</p>

<p>"You believe Paul's hair was yellow, don't you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about."</p>

<p>"Well, I told them you were a firm believer in the yellowness of
Paul's hair."</p>

<p>"Why did you tell them that?" demanded Smith.</p>

<p>"Because the North Midians prefer blonds," she replied.</p>

<p>"But who is Paul?"</p>

<p>"Was, you mean. He is dead."</p>

<p>"Of course I'm sorry to hear that, but who <i>was</i> he?"
insisted the American.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have neglected the scriptures," she told
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, the apostle; but what difference does it make what color
his hair was?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't make any difference," she explained. "What does make
a difference is that you have stated, through me, that you believe
he had yellow hair; and that may be the means of saving your
life."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;the other fellow's religion is always nonsense;
but not to him. You are also suspected of being an angel. Can you
imagine!"</p>

<p>"No! Who suspects me?"</p>

<p>"It was I; or at least I suggested it, and I am hoping Elija
will now suspect it. If he does we are both safe, provided that, in
your celestial capacity, you will intercede for me."</p>

<p>"You are as good as saved then," he said, "for inasmuch as I
cannot speak their language you can put any worth you wish into my
mouth without fear of being called to account."</p>

<p>"That's a fact, isn't it?" she said, laughing. "If our emergency
were not so critical I could have a lot of fun, couldn't I?"</p>

<p>"You seem to find fun in everything," he replied, admiringly;
"even in the face of disaster."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am whistling in the dark," she said.</p>

<p>They talked a great deal while they waited for Elija and the
apostles to return, for it helped them to tide over the anxious
minutes of nervous strain that slowly dragged into hours. They
could hear the chatter and buzz of conversation within the hut, as
Elija and his fellows debated, while, outside, the villagers kept
up a constant babel of conversation.</p>

<p>"They like to talk," commented Smith.</p>

<p>"And perhaps you have noticed an idiosyncrasy of the North
Midians in this respect?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Lots of people like to talk."</p>

<p>"I mean that the men gabble more than the women."</p>

<p>"Perhaps in self-defense."</p>

<p>"Here they come!" she exclaimed as Elija appeared in the doorway
of the hut, fingering the pistol he wore as an ornament.</p>

<p>Darkness was already falling as the Prophet and the twelve
apostles filed out to their places in the open. Elija raised his
hands in a signal for silence and when quiet had been restored he
spoke.</p>

<p>"With the aid of Jehovah," he said, "we have wrestled with a
mighty question. There were some among us who contended that this
man is a South Midian, and others that he is an angel. Mighty was
the weight of the statement that he believeth that Paul had yellow
hair, for if such is the truth then indeed he is not a heretic; and
if he is no heretic he is not a South Midian, for they, as all the
world knows, are heretics. Yet again, it was brought forth that if
he is a demon he might still claim that he believed in the
yellowness of Paul, in order that he might deceive us.</p>

<p>"How were we to know? We must know lest we, through our
ignorance, do sin against one of His angels and bring down the
wrath of Jehovah upon our heads.</p>

<p>"But at last I, Elija, the son of Noah, True Prophet of Paul,
the son of Jehovah, discovered the truth. The man is no angel! The
revelation descended upon me in a burst of glory from Jehovah
Himself&mdash;the man cannot be an angel because he has no
wings!"</p>

<p>There was an immediate burst of "Amens" and "Hallelujahs" from
the assembled villagers, while Lady Barbara went cold with
dread.</p>

<p>"Therefore," continued Elija, "he must be either a South Midian
or a demon, and in either case he must be destroyed."</p>

<p>Lady Barbara turned a pale face toward Lafayette
Smith&mdash;pale even through its coating of tan. Her lip trembled,
just a little. It was the first indication of a weaker, feminine
emotion that Smith had seen this remarkable girl display.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked. "Are they going to harm you?"</p>

<p>"It is you, my dear friend," she replied. "You must escape."</p>

<p>"But how?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; I don't know," she cried. "There is only one
way. You will have to make a break for it&mdash;now. It is dark.
They will not expect it. I will do something to engage their
attention, and then you make a dash for the forest."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No," he said. "We shall go together, or I do
not go."</p>

<p>"Please," she begged, "or it will be too late."</p>

<p>Elija had been talking to one of his apostles, and now he raised
his voice again so that all might hear. "Lest we have mistaken the
divine instructions of Jehovah," he said, "we shall place this man
in the mercy of Jehovah and as Jehovah wills so shall it be. Make
ready the grave. If he is indeed an angel he will arise
unharmed."</p>

<p>"Oh, go; please go!" cried Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" demanded Smith.</p>

<p>"They are going to bury you alive," she cried.</p>

<p>"And you," he asked; "what are they going to do to you?"</p>

<p>"I am to be held in slavery."</p>

<p>With sharpened sticks and instruments of bone and stone a number
of men were already engaged in excavating a grave in the center of
the village street before the hut of Elija, who stood waiting its
completion surrounded by his apostles. The Prophet was still toying
with his new found ornament, concerning the purpose and mechanism
of which he was wholly ignorant.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara was urging Smith to attempt escape while there was
yet an opportunity, and the American was considering the best plan
to adopt.</p>

<p>"You will have to come with me," he said. "I think if we make a
sudden break right back through the village toward the cliffs we
shall find our best chance for success. There are fewer people
congregated on that side."</p>

<p>From the darkness beyond the village on the forest side a pair
of eyes watched the proceedings taking place before the hut of
Elija. Slowly, silently the owner of the eyes crept closer until he
stood in the shadow of a hut at the edge of the village.</p>

<p>Suddenly Smith, seizing Lady Barbara's hand, started at a run
toward the north side of the village; and so unexpected was his
break for liberty that, for a moment, no hand was raised to stay
him; but an instant later, at a cry from Elija, the entire band
leaped in pursuit, while from the shadow of the hut where he had
stood concealed the watcher slipped forward into the village where
he stood near the hut of Elija watching the pursuit of the escaped
prisoners. He was alone, for the little central compound of the
village had emptied as by magic, even the women and children having
joined in the chase.</p>

<p>Smith ran swiftly, holding tightly to the girl's hand; and close
on their heels came the leaders of the pursuit. No longer did the
village fires light their way; and only darkness loomed ahead, as
the moon had not yet risen.</p>

<p>Gradually the American bore to the left, intending to swing in a
half circle toward the south. There was yet a chance that they
might make good their escape if they could outdistance the nearer
of their pursuers until they reached the forest, for their strait
gave them both speed and endurance far above normal.</p>

<p>But just as success seemed near they entered a patch of broken
lava rock, invisible in the darkness; and Smith stumbled and fell
dragging Lady Barbara down with him. Before they could scramble to
their feet the leading Midian was upon them.</p>

<p>The American freed himself for a moment and struggled to his
feet; and again the fellow sought to seize him, but Smith swung a
heavy blow to his chin and felled him.</p>

<p>Brief, however, was this respite, for almost immediately both
the American and the English girl were overwhelmed by superior
numbers and once again found themselves captives, though Smith
fought until he was overpowered, knocking his antagonists to right
and left.</p>

<p>Miserably dejected, they were dragged back to the village
compound, their last hope gone; and again the Midians gathered
around the open grave to witness the torture of their victim.</p>

<p>Smith was conducted to the edge of the excavation, where he was
held by two stalwart men, while Elija raised his voice in prayer,
and the remainder of the assemblage knelt, bursting forth
occasionally with hallelujahs and amens.</p>

<p>When he had concluded his long prayer the Prophet paused.
Evidently there was something on his mind, which vexed him. In fact
it was the pistol which dangled from the thong about his neck. He
was not quite sure of its purpose, and he was about to destroy the
only person who might tell him.</p>

<p>To Elija the pistol was quite the most remarkable possession
that had ever fallen into his hands, and he was filled with a great
curiosity concerning it. It might be, he argued, some magic
talisman for averting evil, or, upon the other hand, it might be
the charm of a demon or a sorcerer, that would work evil upon him.
At that thought he quickly removed the thong from about his neck,
but he still held the weapon in his hand.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he demanded, turning to Lady Barbara and
exhibiting the pistol.</p>

<p>"It is a weapon," she said. "Be careful or it will kill some
one."</p>

<p>"How does it kill?" asked Elija.</p>

<p>"What is he saying?" demanded Smith.</p>

<p>"He is asking how the pistol kills," replied the girl.</p>

<p>A brilliant idea occurred to the American. "Tell him to give it
to me, and I will show him," he said.</p>

<p>But when she translated the offer to Elija he demurred. "He
could then kill me with it," he said, shrewdly.</p>

<p>"He won't give it to you," the girl told Smith. "He is afraid
you want to kill him."</p>

<p>"I do," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Tell him," said Elija, "to explain to me how I may kill some
one with it."</p>

<p>"Repeat my instructions to him very carefully," said Smith,
after Lady Barbara had translated the demand of the prophet. "Tell
him how to grasp the pistol," and when Lady Barbara had done so and
Elija held the weapon by the grip in his right hand, "now tell him
to place his index finger through the guard, but warn him not to
pull the trigger."</p>

<p>Elija did as he was bid. "Now," continued Smith, "explain to him
that in order to see how the weapon operates he should place one
eye to the muzzle and look down the barrel."</p>

<p>"But I can see nothing," expostulated Elija when he had done as
Lady Barbara directed. "It is quite dark down the little hole."</p>

<p>"He says it is too dark in the barrel for him to see anything,"
repeated Lady Barbara to the American.</p>

<p>"Explain to him that if he pulls the trigger there will be a
light in the barrel," said Smith.</p>

<p>"But that will be murder," exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"It is war," said Smith, "and in the subsequent confusion we may
escape."</p>

<p>Lady Barbara steeled herself. "You could see nothing because you
did not press the little piece of metal beneath your index finger,"
she explained to Elija.</p>

<p>"What will that do?" demanded the prophet.</p>

<p>"It will make a light in the little hole," said Lady Barbara.
Elija again placed his eye against the muzzle; and this time he
pulled the trigger; and as the report cracked the tense silence of
the watching villagers Elija, the son of Noah, pitched forward upon
his face.</p>

<p>Instantly Lady Barbara sprang toward Smith, who simultaneously
sought to break away from the grip of the men who held him; but
they, although astonished at what had occurred, were not to be
caught off their guard, and though he struggled desperately they
held him.</p>

<p>For an instant there was a hushed silence; and then pandemonium
broke loose as the villagers realized that their prophet was dead,
slain by the wicked charm of a demon; but at the very outset of
their demands for vengeance their attention was distracted by a
strange and remarkable figure that sprang from the hut of Elija,
stooped and picked up the pistol that had fallen from the hands of
the dead man, and leaped to the side of the prisoner struggling
with his guards.</p>

<p>This was such a man as none of them had ever seen&mdash;a giant
white man with a tousled shock of black hair and with grey eyes
that sent a shiver through them, so fierce and implacable were
they. Naked he was but for a loin cloth of skin, and the muscles
that rolled beneath his brown hide were muscles such as they never
had seen before.</p>

<p>As the newcomer sprang toward the American one of the men
guarding Smith, sensing that an attempt was being made to rescue
the prisoner, swung his club in readiness to deal a blow against
the strange creature advancing upon him. At the same time the other
guard sought to drag Smith from the compound.</p>

<p>The American did not at first recognize Tarzan of the Apes, yet,
though he was not aware that the stranger was bent upon his rescue,
he sensed that he was an enemy of the Midians, and so struggled to
prevent his guard from forcing him away.</p>

<p>Another Midian seized Lady Barbara with the intention of
carrying her from the scene, for all the villagers believed that
the strange giant was a friend of the prisoners and had come to
effect their release.</p>

<p>Smith was successful in tearing himself free from the man who
held him, and immediately sprang to the girl's assistance, felling
her captor with a single blow, just as Tarzan levelled the
American's pistol at the guard who was preparing to cudgel him.</p>

<p>The sound of this second shot and the sight of their fellow
dropping to the ground, as had Elija, filled the Midians with
consternation; and for a moment they fell back from the three,
leaving them alone in the center of the compound.</p>

<p>"Quick!" called Tarzan to Smith. "You and the girl get out of
here before they recover from their surprise. I will follow you.
That way," he added, pointing toward the south.</p>

<p>As Lafayette Smith and Lady Barbara hurried from the village
Tarzan backed slowly after them, keeping the little pistol in full
view of the frightened villagers, who, having seen two of their
number die beneath its terrifying magic, were loath to approach it
too closely.</p>

<p>Until out of range of a thrown club Tarzan continued his slow
retreat; then he wheeled and bounded off into the night in pursuit
of Lafayette Smith and Lady Barbara Collis.</p>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20">XX.&mdash;THE BEST THREE OUT OF
FIVE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THOUGH Jezebel was terrified by the black faces of
her captors and by the strange beasts they bestrode, the like of
which she had never even imagined, her fear for herself was
outweighed by her sorrow. Her one thought was to escape and return
to the side of the "Gunner," even though she believed him dead from
the terrific blow that his assailant had struck him.</p>

<p>She struggled violently to free herself from the grasp of the
man in front of whom she rode; but the fellow was far too powerful;
and, though she was difficult to hold, at no time was there the
slightest likelihood that she might escape. Her efforts, however,
angered him and at last he struck her, bringing to the girl a
realization of the futility of pitting her puny strength against
his. She must wait, then, until she could accomplish by stealth
what she could not effect by force.</p>

<p>The village of the raiders lay but a short distance from the
point at which she had been captured, and but a few minutes had
elapsed since that event when they rode up to its gates and into
the central compound.</p>

<p>The shouts that greeted the arrival of a new and beautiful
prisoner brought Capietro and Stabutch to the doorway of their
hut.</p>

<p>"Now what have the black devils brought in?" exclaimed
Capietro.</p>

<p>"It looks like a young woman," said Stabutch.</p>

<p>"It is," cried Capietro, as the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> approached the hut with
their prisoner. "We shall have company, eh, Stabutch? Who have you
there, my children?" he demanded of the three who were accompanying
Jezebel.</p>

<p>"The price of a chief's ransom, perhaps," replied one of the
blacks.</p>

<p>"Where did you find her?"</p>

<p>"Above the village a short distance, when we were returning from
scouting. A man was with her. The man who escaped with the help of
the ape-man."</p>

<p>"Where is he! Why did you not bring him, also?" demanded
Capietro.</p>

<p>"He fought us, and we were forced to kill him."</p>

<p>"You have done well," said Capietro. "She is worth two of
him&mdash;in many ways. Come girl, hold up your head, let us have a
look at that pretty face. Come, you need not fear anything&mdash;if
you are a good girl you will find Dominic Capietro a good
fellow."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she does not understand Italian," suggested
Stabutch.</p>

<p>"You are right, my friend; I shall speak to her in English."</p>

<p>Jezebel had looked up at Stabutch when she heard him speak a
language she understood. Perhaps this man would be a friend, she
thought; but when she saw his face her heart sank.</p>

<p>"What a beauty!" ejaculated the Russian.</p>

<p>"You have fallen in love with her quickly, my friend," commented
Capietro. "Do you want to buy her?"</p>

<p>"How much do you want for her?"</p>

<p>"Friends should not bargain," said the Italian. "Wait, I have
it! Come, girl," and he took Jezebel by the arm and led her into
the hut, where Stabutch followed them.</p>

<p>"Why was I brought here?" asked Jezebel. "I have not harmed you.
Let me go back to Danny; he is hurt."</p>

<p>"He is dead," said Capietro; "but don't you grieve, little one.
You now have two friends in place of the one you have lost. Soon
you will forget him; it is easy for a woman to forget."</p>

<p>"I shall never forget him," cried Jezebel. "I want to go back to
him&mdash;perhaps he is not dead." Then she broke down and
cried.</p>

<p>Stabutch stood eyeing the girl hungrily. Her youth and her
beauty aroused a devil within him, and he made a mental vow that he
would possess her. "Do not cry," he said, kindly. "I am your
friend. Everything will be all right."</p>

<p>The new tone in his voice gave hope to Jezebel, and she looked
up at him gratefully. "If you are my friend," she said, "take me
away from here and back to Danny."</p>

<p>"After a while," replied Stabutch, and then to Capietro, "How
much?"</p>

<p>"I shall not sell her to my good friend," replied the Italian.
"Let us have a drink, and then I shall explain my plan."</p>

<p>The two drank from a bottle standing on the earth floor of the
hut. "Sit down," said Capietro, waving Jezebel to a seat on the
dirty rug. Then he searched for a moment in his duffle bag and
brought out a deck of soiled and grimy cards. "Be seated, my
friend," he said to Stabutch. "Let us have another drink, and then
you shall hear my plan."</p>

<p>Stabutch drank from the bottle and wiped his lips with the back
of his hand. "Well," he said, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"We shall play for her," exclaimed the Italian, shuffling the
deck, "and whoever wins, keeps her."</p>

<p>"Let us drink to that," said Stabutch. "Five games, eh, and the
first to win three takes her?"</p>

<p>"Another drink to seal the bargain!" exclaimed the Italian. "The
best three out of five!"</p>

<p>Stabutch won the first game, while Jezebel sat looking on in
ignorance of the purpose of the bits of pasteboard, and only
knowing that in some way they were to decide her fate. She hoped
the younger man would win, but only because he had said that he was
her friend. Perhaps she could persuade him to take her back to
Danny. She wondered what kind of water was in the bottle from which
they drank, for she noticed that it wrought a change in them. They
talked much louder now and shouted strange words when the little
cards were thrown upon the rug, and then one would appear very
angry while the other always laughed immoderately. Also they swayed
and lurched in a peculiar manner that she had not noticed before
they had drunk so much of the water from the bottle.</p>

<p>Capietro won the second game and the third. Stabutch was
furious, but now he became very quiet. He exerted all his powers of
concentration upon the game, and he seemed almost sober as the
cards were dealt for the fourth game.</p>

<p>"She is as good as mine!" cried Capietro, as he looked at his
hand.</p>

<p>"She will never be yours," growled the Russian.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I shall win the next two games."</p>

<p>The Italian laughed loudly. "That is good!" he cried. "We should
drink to that." He raised the bottle to his lips and then passed it
to Stabutch.</p>

<p>"I do not want a drink," said the Russian, in a surly tone,
pushing the bottle aside.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! My friend is getting nervous. He is afraid he is going
to lose and so he will not drink. Sapristi! It is all the same to
me. I get the brandy and the girl, too."</p>

<p>"Play!" snapped Stabutch.</p>

<p>"You are in a hurry to lose," taunted Capietro.</p>

<p>"To win," corrected Stabutch, and he did.</p>

<p>Now it was the Italian's turn to curse and rage at luck, and
once again the cards were dealt and the players picked up their
hands.</p>

<p>"It is the last game," said Stabutch.</p>

<p>"We have each won two," replied Capietro. "Let us drink to the
winner&mdash;although I dislike proposing a toast to myself," and
he laughed again, but this time there was an ugly note in his
laughter.</p>

<p>In silence, now, they resumed their play. One by one the little
pasteboards fell upon the rug. The girl looked on in wondering
silence. There was a tenseness in the situation that she felt,
without understanding. Poor little Jezebel, she understood so
little!</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a triumphant oath, Capietro sprang to his feet.
"I win!" he cried. "Come, friend, drink with me to my good
fortune."</p>

<p>Sullenly the Russian drank, a very long draught this time. There
was a sinister gleam in his eye as he handed the bottle back to
Capietro. Leon Stabutch was a poor loser.</p>

<p>The Italian emptied the bottle and flung it to the ground. Then
he turned toward Jezebel and stooping lifted her to her feet.
"Come, my dear," he said, his coarse voice thick from drink, "Give
me a kiss."</p>

<p>Jezebel drew back, but the Italian jerked her roughly to him and
tried to draw her lips to his.</p>

<p>"Leave the girl alone," growled Stabutch. "Can't you see she is
afraid of you?"</p>

<p>"What did I win her for?" demanded Capietro. "To leave her
alone? Mind your own business."</p>

<p>"I'll make it my business," said Stabutch. "Take your hands off
her." He stepped forward and laid a hand on Jezebel's arm. "She is
mine by rights anyway."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You cheated. I caught you at it in the last game."</p>

<p>"You lie!" shouted Capietro and simultaneously he struck at
Stabutch. The Russian dodged the blow and closed with the
other.</p>

<p>Both were drunk and none too steady. It required much of their
attention to keep from falling down. But as they wrestled about the
interior of the hut a few blows were struck&mdash;enough to arouse
their rage to fury and partially to sober them. Then the duel
became deadly, as each sought the throat of the other.</p>

<p>Jezebel, wide-eyed and terrified, had difficulty in keeping out
of their way as they fought to and fro across the floor of the hut;
and so centered was the attention of the two men upon one another
that the girl might have escaped had she not been more afraid of
the black men without than of the whites within.</p>

<p>Several times Stabutch released his hold with his right hand and
sought for something beneath his coat and at last he found
it&mdash;a slim dagger. Capietro did not see it.</p>

<p>They were standing in the center of the hut now, their arms
locked about one another, and resting thus as though by mutual
consent. They were panting heavily from their exertions, and
neither seemed to have gained any material advantage.</p>

<p>Slowly the Russian's right hand crept up the back of his
adversary. Jezebel saw, but only her eyes reflected her horror.
Though she had seen many people killed she yet had a horror of
killing. She saw the Russian feel for a spot on the other's back
with the point of his thumb. Then she saw him turn his hand and
place the dagger point where his thumb had been.</p>

<p>There was a smile upon Stabutch's face as he drove the blade
home. Capietro stiffened, screamed, and died. As the body slumped
to the ground and rolled over on its back the murderer stood over
the corpse of his victim, a smile upon his lips, and his eyes upon
the girl.</p>

<p>But suddenly the smile died as a new thought came to the cunning
mind of the slayer and his eyes snapped from the face of Jezebel to
the doorway of the hut, where a filthy blanket answered the purpose
of a door.</p>

<p>He had forgotten the horde of cut-throats who had called this
thing upon the floor their chief! But now he recalled them and his
soul was filled with terror. He did not need to ask himself what
his fate would be when they discovered his crime.</p>

<p>"You have murdered him!" cried the girl suddenly, a note of
horror in her voice.</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" snapped Stabutch. "Do you want to die? They will
kill us when they discover this."</p>

<p>"I did not do it," protested Jezebel.</p>

<p>"They will kill you just the same&mdash;afterwards. They are
beasts."</p>

<p>Suddenly he stooped, seized the corpse by the ankles and,
dragging it to the far end of the hut, he covered it with rugs and
clothing.</p>

<p>"Now keep quiet until I come back," he said to Jezebel. "If you
give an alarm I'll kill you myself before they have a chance
to."</p>

<p>He rummaged in a dark corner of the hut and brought forth a
revolver with its holster and belt, which he buckled about his
hips, and a rifle which he leaned beside the doorway.</p>

<p>"When I return be ready to come with me," he snapped, and
raising the rug that covered the doorway, he stepped out into the
village.</p>

<p>Quickly he made his way to where the ponies of the band were
tethered. Here were several of the blacks loitering near the
animals.</p>

<p>"Where is the headman?" he asked, but none of them understood
English. He tried to tell them by means of signs, to saddle two
horses, but they only shook their heads. If they understood him, as
they doubtless did, they refused to take orders from him.</p>

<p>At this juncture the headman, attracted from a nearby hut,
approached. He understood a little pidgin English, and Stabutch had
no difficulty in making him understand that he wanted two horses
saddled; but the headman wanted to know more. Did the chief want
them?</p>

<p>"Yes, he wants them," replied Stabutch. "He sent me to get them.
The chief is sick. Drink too much." Stabutch laughed and the
headman seemed to understand.</p>

<p>"Who go with you?" asked the headman.</p>

<p>Stabutch hesitated. Well, he might as well tell
him&mdash;everyone would see the girl ride out with him anyway.
"The girl," he said.</p>

<p>The headman's eyes narrowed. "The Chief say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. The girl thinks the white man not dead. The Chief send me
to look for him."</p>

<p>"You take men?"</p>

<p>"No. Man come back with us if girl say so. Be afraid of black
men. No come."</p>

<p>The other nodded understandingly and ordered two horses saddled
and bridled. "Him dead," he offered.</p>

<p>Stabutch shrugged. "We see," he replied, as he led the two
animals toward the hut where Jezebel awaited him.</p>

<p>The headman accompanied him, and Stabutch was in terror. What if
the man insisted on entering the hut to see his chief? Stabutch
loosened the revolver in its holster. Now his greatest fear was
that the shot might attract others to the hut. That would never do.
He must find some other way. He stopped and the headman halted with
him.</p>

<p>"Do not come to the hut yet," said Stabutch.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the headman.</p>

<p>"The girl is afraid. If she sees you she will think we are
deceiving her, and she may refuse to show me where the man is. We
promised her that no black man would come."</p>

<p>The headman hesitated. Then he shrugged and turned back. "All
right," he said.</p>

<p>"And tell them to leave the gates open till we have gone,"
called Stabutch.</p>

<p>At the hut door he called to the girl. "All ready," he said,
"and hand me my rifle when you come out," but she did not know what
a rifle was and he had to step in and get it himself.</p>

<p>Jezebel looked at the horses with dismay.</p>

<p>At the thought of riding one of these strange beasts alone she
was terrified. "I cannot do it," she told Stabutch.</p>

<p>"You will have to&mdash;or die," he whispered. "I'll lead the
one you ride. Here, hurry."</p>

<p>He lifted her into the saddle and showed her how to use the
stirrups and hold the reins. Then he put a rope about the neck of
her horse; and, mounting his own, he led hers out through the
village gateway while half a hundred murderers watched them
depart.</p>

<p>As they turned upward toward the higher hills the setting sun
projected their shadows far ahead, and presently night descended
upon them and hid their sudden change of direction from any
watchers there may have been at the village gates.</p>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21">XXI.&mdash;AN AWAKENING</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DANNY "GUNNER" PATRICK opened his eyes and stared
up at the blue African sky. Slowly consciousness returned and with
it the realization that his head pained severely. He raised a hand
and felt of it. What was that? He looked at his hand and saw that
it was bloody.</p>

<p>"Geeze!" he muttered. "They got me!" He tried to recall how it
had happened. "I knew the finger was on me, but how the hell did
they get me? Where was I?" His thoughts were all back in Chicago,
and he was puzzled. Vaguely he felt that he had made his getaway,
and yet they had "got" him. He could not figure it out.</p>

<p>Then he turned his head slightly and saw lofty mountains looming
near. Slowly and painfully he sat up and looked around. Memory,
partial and fragmentary, returned. "I must have fell off them
mountains," he mused, "while I was lookin' for camp."</p>

<p>Gingerly he rose to his feet and was relieved to find that he
was not seriously injured&mdash;at least his arms and legs were
intact. "My head never was much good. Geeze, it hurts, though."</p>

<p>A single urge dominated him&mdash;he must find camp. Old Smithy
would be worrying about him if he did not return. Where was Obambi?
"I wonder if he fell off too," he muttered, looking about him. But
Obambi, neither dead nor alive, was in sight; and so the "Gunner"
started upon his fruitless search for camp.</p>

<p>At first he wandered toward the northwest, directly away from
Smith's last camp. Tongani, the baboon, sitting upon his sentinel
rock, saw him coming and sounded the alarm. At first Danny saw only
a couple of "monkeys" coming toward him, barking and growling. He
saw them stop occasionally and place the backs of their heads
against the ground and he mentally classified them as "nutty
monks," but when their numbers were swollen to a hundred and he
finally realized the potential danger lying in those powerful jaws
and sharp fangs, he altered his course and turned toward the
southwest.</p>

<p>For a short distance the tongani followed him, but when they saw
that he intended them no harm they let him proceed and returned to
their interrupted feeding, while the man, with a sigh of relief,
continued on his way.</p>

<p>In a ravine Danny found water, and with the discovery came a
realization of his thirst and his hunger. He drank at the same pool
at which Tarzan had slain Horta, the boar; and he also washed the
blood from his head and face as well as he could. Then he continued
on his aimless wandering. This time he climbed higher up the slope
toward the mountains, in a southeasterly direction, and was headed
at last toward the location of the now abandoned camp. Chance and
the tongani had set him upon the right trail.</p>

<p>In a short time he reached a spot that seemed familiar; and here
he stopped and looked around in an effort to recall his wandering
mental faculties, which he fully realized were not functioning
properly.</p>

<p>"That bat on the bean sure knocked me cuckoo," he remarked, half
aloud. "Geeze, what's that?" Something was moving in the tall grass
through which he had just come. He watched intently and a moment
later saw the head of Sheeta, the panther, parting the grasses a
short distance from him. The scene was suddenly familiar.</p>

<p>"I gotcha Steve!" exclaimed the "Gunner." "Me and that Tarzan
guy flopped here last night&mdash;now I remember."</p>

<p>He also remembered how Tarzan had chased the panther away by
"running a bluff on him," and he wondered if he could do the same
thing.</p>

<p>"Geeze, what a ornery lookin' pan! I'll bet you got a rotten
disposition&mdash;and that Tarzan guy just growled and ran at you,
and you beat it. Say, I don't believe it, if I did see it myself.
Whyinell don't you go on about your business, you big stiff? You
give me the heeby-jeebies." He stooped and picked up a fragment of
rock. "Beat it!" he yelled, as he hurled the missile at Sheeta.</p>

<p>The great cat wheeled and bounded away, disappearing in the tall
grass that the "Gunner" could now see waving along the path of the
panther's retreat. "Well, what do you know about that?" ejaculated
Danny. "I done it! Geeze, these lions ain't so much."</p>

<p>His hunger now claimed his attention as his returning memory
suggested a means of appeasing it. "I wonder could I do it?" he
mused, as he hunted around on the ground until he had found a thin
fragment of rock, with which he commenced to scrape away the dirt
from a loose heap that rose a few inches above the contour of the
surrounding ground. "I wonder could I!"</p>

<p>His digging soon revealed the remains of the boar Tarzan had
cached against their possible return. With his pocket knife the
"Gunner" hacked off several pieces, after which he scraped the dirt
back over the body and busied himself in the preparation of a fire,
where he grilled the meat in a sketchy fashion that produced
culinary results which ordinarily would have caused him to turn up
his nose in disgust. But today he was far from particular and
bolted the partially cooked and partially charred morsels like a
ravenous wolf.</p>

<p>His memory had returned now up to the point of the meal he had
eaten at this same spot with Tarzan&mdash;from there on until he
had regained consciousness a short time before, it was a blank. He
knew now that he could find his way back to camp from the point
above the raiders' village where he and Obambi had lunched, and so
he turned his footsteps in that direction.</p>

<p>When he had found the place, he crept on down to the edge of the
cliff where it overlooked the village; and here he lay down to rest
and to spy upon the raiders, for he was very tired.</p>

<p>"The lousy bums!" he ejaculated beneath his breath, as he saw
the <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> moving about
the village. "I wish I had my typewriter, I'd clean up that
dump."</p>

<p>He saw Stabutch emerge from a hut and walk down to the horses.
He watched him while he talked to the blacks there and to the
headman. Then he saw the Russian leading two saddled horses back to
the hut.</p>

<p>"That guy don't know it," he muttered, "but the finger is sure
on him. I'll get him on the spot some day if it takes the rest of
my natural life. Geeze, glom the broad!" Stabutch had summoned
Jezebel from the hut. Suddenly a strange thing happened inside the
head of Danny "Gunner" Patrick. It was as though someone had
suddenly raised a window shade and let in a flood of light. He saw
everything perfectly now in retrospection. With the sight of
Jezebel his memory had returned!</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that he restrained an urge to call out
and tell her that he was there; but caution stilled his tongue, and
he lay watching while the two mounted and rode out of the
gateway.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and ran along the ridge toward the north,
parallel to the course they were taking. It was already dusk. In a
few minutes it would be dark. If he could only keep them in sight
until he knew in what direction they finally went!</p>

<p>Exhaustion was forgotten as he ran through the approaching
night. Dimly now he could see them. They rode for a short distance
upward toward the cliffs; and then, just before the darkness
swallowed them, he saw them turn and gallop away toward the
northwest and the great forest that lay in that direction.</p>

<p>Reckless of life and limb, the "Gunner" half stumbled, half fell
down the cliffs that here had crumbled away and spilled their
fragments out upon the slope below.</p>

<p>"I gotta catch 'em, I gotta catch 'em," he kept repeating to
himself. "The poor kid! The poor little kid! So help me God, if I
catch 'em, what I won't do to that&mdash;&mdash;if he's hurt
her!"</p>

<p>On through the night he stumbled, falling time and again only to
pick himself up and continue his frantic and hopeless search for
the little golden haired Jezebel who had come into his life for a
few brief hours to leave a mark upon his heart that might never be
erased.</p>

<p>Gradually the realization of it crept upon him as he groped
blindly into the unknown, and it gave him strength to go on in the
face of such physical exhaustion as he had never known before.</p>

<p>"Geeze," he muttered, "I sure must of fell hard for that
kid."</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22">XXII.&mdash;BY A LONELY POOL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NIGHT had fallen; and Tarzan of the Apes, leading
Lady Barbara Collis and Lafayette Smith from the valley of the land
of Midian, did not see the spoor of Jezebel and the "Gunner."</p>

<p>His two charges were upon the verge of exhaustion, but the
ape-man led them on through the night in accordance with a plan he
had decided upon. He knew that there were two more whites
missing&mdash;Jezebel and Danny Patrick&mdash;and he wanted to get
Lady Barbara and Smith to a place of safety that he might be free
to pursue his search for these others.</p>

<p>To Lady Barbara and Smith the journey seemed interminable, yet
they made no complaint, for the ape-man had explained the purpose
of this forced march to them; and they were even more anxious than
he concerning the fate of their friends.</p>

<p>Smith supported the girl as best he could; but his own strength
was almost spent, and sometimes his desire to assist her tended
more to impede than to aid her. Finally she stumbled and fell; and
when Tarzan, striding in advance, heard and returned to them he
found Smith vainly endeavoring to lift Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>This was the first intimation the ape-man had received that his
charges were upon the verge of exhaustion, for neither had voiced a
single complaint; and when he realized it he lifted Lady Barbara in
his arms and carried her, while Smith, relieved at least of further
anxiety concerning her, was able to keep going, though he moved
like an automaton, apparently without conscious volition. Nor may
his state be wondered at, when one considers what he had passed
through during the preceding three days.</p>

<p>With Lady Barbara, he marvelled at the strength and endurance of
the ape-man, which, because of his own weakened state, seemed
unbelievable even as he witnessed it.</p>

<p>"It is not much farther," said Tarzan, guessing that the man
needed encouragement.</p>

<p>"You are sure the hunter you told us of has not moved his camp?"
asked Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"He was there day before yesterday," replied the ape-man. "I
think we shall find him there tonight."</p>

<p>"He will take us in?" asked Smith.</p>

<p>"Certainly, just as you would, under similar circumstances, take
in anyone who needed assistance," replied the Lord of the Jungle.
"He is an Englishman," he added, as though that fact in itself were
a sufficient answer to their doubts.</p>

<p>They were in a dense forest now, following an ancient game
trail; and presently they saw lights flickering ahead.</p>

<p>"That must be the camp," exclaimed Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tarzan, and a moment later he called out in a
native dialect.</p>

<p>Instantly came an answering voice; and a moment later Tarzan
halted upon the edge of the camp, just outside the circle of
beast-fires.</p>

<p>Several <a title="native soldiers"><i>askaris</i></a> were on
guard, and with them Tarzan conversed for a few moments; then he
advanced and lowered Lady Barbara to her feet.</p>

<p>"I have told them not to disturb their bwana," the ape-man
explained. "There is another tent that Lady Barbara may occupy, and
the headman will arrange to have a shelter thrown up for Smith. You
will be perfectly safe here. The men tell me their bwana is Lord
Passmore. He will doubtless arrange to get you out to rail head. In
the meantime I shall try to locate your friends."</p>

<p>That was all&mdash;the ape-man turned and melted into the black
night before they could voice any thanks.</p>

<p>"Why, he's gone!" exclaimed the girl. "I didn't even thank
him."</p>

<p>"I thought he would remain here until morning," said Smith. "He
must be tired."</p>

<p>"He seems tireless," replied Lady Barbara. "He is a superman, if
ever there was one."</p>

<p>"Come," said the headman, "your tent is over here. The boys are
arranging a shelter for the bwana."</p>

<p>"Good night, Mr. Smith," said the girl. "I hope you sleep
well."</p>

<p>"Good night, Lady Barbara," replied Smith. "I hope we wake up
sometime."</p>

<p>And as they prepared for this welcome rest Stabutch and Jezebel
were riding through the night, the man completely confused and
lost.</p>

<p>Toward morning they drew rein at the edge of a great forest,
after riding in wide circles during the greater part of the night.
Stabutch was almost exhausted; and Jezebel was but little better
off, but she had youth and health to give her the reserve strength
that the man had undermined and wasted in dissipation.</p>

<p>"I've got to get some sleep," he said, dismounting.</p>

<p>Jezebel needed no invitation to slip from her saddle for she was
stiff and sore from this unusual experience. Stabutch led the
animals inside the forest and tied them to a tree. Then he threw
himself upon the ground and was almost immediately asleep.</p>

<p>Jezebel sat in silence listening to the regular breathing of the
man. "Now would be the time to escape," she thought. She rose
quietly to her feet. How dark it was! Perhaps it would be better to
wait until it became light enough to see. She was sure the man
would sleep a long time, for it was evident that he was very
tired.</p>

<p>She sat down again, listening to the noises of the jungle. They
frightened her. Yes, she would wait until it was light; then she
would untie the horses, ride one and lead the other away so that
the man could not pursue her.</p>

<p>Slowly the minutes crept by. The sky became lighter in the east,
over the distant mountains. The horses became restless. She noticed
that they stood with ears pricked up and that they looked deeper
into the jungle and trembled.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was the sound of crashing in the underbrush. The
horses snorted and surged back upon their ropes, both of which
broke. The noise awakened Stabutch, who sat up just as the two
terrified animals wheeled and bolted. An instant later a lion
leaped past the girl and the man, in pursuit of the two fleeing
horses.</p>

<p>Stabutch sprang to his feet, his rifle in his hands. "God!" he
exclaimed. "This is no place to sleep," and Jezebel's opportunity
had passed.</p>

<p>The sun was topping the eastern mountains. The day had come.
Soon the searchers would be ahorse. Now that he was afoot, Stabutch
knew that he must not loiter. However, they must eat, or they would
have no strength to proceed; and only by his rifle could they
eat.</p>

<p>"Climb into that tree, little one," he said to Jezebel. "You
will be safe there while I go and shoot something for our
breakfast. Watch for the lion, and if you see him returning this
way shout a warning. I am going farther into the forest to look for
game."</p>

<p>Jezebel climbed into the tree, and Stabutch departed upon the
hunt for breakfast. The girl watched for the lion, hoping it would
return, for she had determined that she would give no warning to
the man if it did.</p>

<p>She was afraid of the Russian because of things he had said to
her during that long night ride. Much that he had said she had not
understood at all, but she understood enough to know that he was a
bad man. But the lion did not return, and presently Jezebel dozed
and nearly fell out of the tree.</p>

<p>Stabutch, hunting in the forest, found a water hole not far from
where he had left Jezebel; and here he hid behind bushes waiting
for some animal to come down to drink. Nor had he long to wait
before he saw a creature appear suddenly upon the opposite side of
the pool. So quietly had it come that the Russian had not dreamed
that a creature stirred within a mile of his post. The most
surprising feature of the occurrence, however, was that the animal
thus suddenly to step into view was a man.</p>

<p>Stabutch's evil eyes narrowed. It was <i>the</i> man&mdash;the
man he had traveled all the way from Moscow to kill. What an
opportunity! Fate was indeed kind to him. He would fulfill his
mission without danger to himself, and then he would escape with
the girl&mdash;that wondrous girl! Stabutch had never seen so
beautiful a woman in his life, and now he was to possess
her&mdash;she was to be his.</p>

<p>But first he must attend to the business of the moment. What a
pleasant business it was, too. He raised his rifle very cautiously
and aimed. Tarzan had halted and turned his head to one side. He
could not see the rifle barrel of his enemy because of the bush
behind which Stabutch hid and the fact that his eyes were centered
on something in another direction.</p>

<p>The Russian realized that he was trembling, and he cursed
himself under his breath. The nervous strain was too great. He
tensed his muscles in an effort to hold his hands firm and the
rifle steady and immovable upon the target. The front sight of the
rifle was describing a tiny circle instead of remaining fixed upon
that great chest which offered such a splendid target.</p>

<p>But he must fire! The man would not stand there thus forever.
The thought hurried Stabutch, and as the sight passed again across
the body of the ape-man the Russian squeezed the trigger.</p>

<p>At the sound of the shot Jezebel's eyes snapped open. "Perhaps
the lion returned," she soliloquized, "or maybe the man has found
food. If it were the lion, I hope he missed it."</p>

<p>Also, as the rifle spoke, the target leaped into the air, seized
a low hung branch and disappeared amidst the foliage of the trees
above. Stabutch had missed&mdash;he should have relaxed his muscles
rather than tensed them.</p>

<p>The Russian was terrified. He felt as must one who stands upon
the drop with the noose already about his neck. He turned and fled.
His cunning mind suggested that he had better not return where the
girl was. She was already lost to him, for he could not be burdened
with her now in this flight, upon the success of which hung his
very life. Accordingly he ran toward the south.</p>

<p>As he rushed headlong through the forest he was already out of
breath when he felt a sudden sickening pain in his arm and at the
same instant saw the feathered tip of an arrow waving beside him as
he ran.</p>

<p>The shaft had pierced his forearm, its tip projecting from the
opposite side. Sick with terror Stabutch increased his speed.
Somewhere above him was his Nemesis, whom he could neither see nor
hear. It was as though a ghostly assassin pursued him on silent
wings.</p>

<p>Again an arrow struck him, sinking deep into the triceps of his
other arm. With a scream of pain and horror Stabutch halted and,
dropping upon his knees, raised his hands in supplication. "Spare
me!" he cried. "Spare me! I have never wronged you. If you will
spare&mdash;"</p>

<p>An arrow, speeding straight, drove through the Russian's throat.
He screamed and clutched at the missile and fell forward on his
face.</p>

<p>Jezebel, listening in the tree, heard the agonized shriek of the
stricken man; and she shuddered. "The lion got him," she whispered.
"He was wicked. It is the will of Jehovah!"</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes dropped lightly from a tree and warily
approached the dying man. Stabutch, writhing in agony and terror,
rolled over on his side. He saw the ape-man approaching, his bow
and arrow ready in his hand, and, dying, reached for the revolver
at his hip to complete the work that he had come so far to achieve
and for which he was to give his life.</p>

<p>No more had his hand reached the grip of his weapon than the
Lord of the Jungle loosed another shaft that drove deep through the
chest of the Russian, deep through his heart. Without a sound Leon
Stabutch collapsed; and a moment later there rang through the
jungle the fierce, uncanny victory cry of the bull ape.</p>

<p>As the savage notes reverberated through the forest Jezebel slid
to the ground and fled in terror. She knew not where nor to what
fate her flying feet led her. She was obsessed by but a single
idea&mdash;to escape from the terrors of that lonely spot.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23">XXIII.&mdash;CAPTURED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WITH the coming of day the "Gunner" found himself
near a forest. He had heard no sound of horses all during the
night; and now that day had come, and he could see to a distance,
he scanned the landscape for some sign of Stabutch and Jezebel but
without success.</p>

<p>"Geeze," he muttered, "there ain't no use, I gotta rest. The
poor little kid! If I only knew where the rat took her; but I
don't, and I gotta rest." He surveyed the forest. "That looks like
a swell hideout. I'll lay up there and grab off a little sleep.
Geeze, I'm all in."</p>

<p>As he walked toward the forest his attention was attracted to
something moving a couple of miles to the north of him. He stopped
short, and looked more closely as two horses, racing from the
forest, dashed madly toward the foothills, pursued by a lion.</p>

<p>"Geeze!" exclaimed the "Gunner," "those must be their horses.
What if the lion got her!"</p>

<p>Instantly his fatigue was forgotten; and he started at a run
toward the north; but he could not keep the pace up for long; and
soon he was walking again, his brain a turmoil of conjecture and
apprehension.</p>

<p>He saw the lion give up the chase and turn away almost
immediately, cutting up the slope in a northeasterly direction. The
"Gunner" was glad to see him go, not for his own sake so much as
for Jezebel, whom, he reasoned, the lion might not have killed
after all. There was a possibility, he thought, that she might have
had time to climb a tree. Otherwise, he was positive, the lion must
have killed her.</p>

<p>His knowledge of lions was slight. In common with most people,
he believed that lions wandered about killing everything so
unfortunate as to fall into their pathways&mdash;unless they were
bluffed out as he had bluffed the panther the day before. But of
course, he reasoned, Jezebel wouldn't have been able to bluff a
lion.</p>

<p>He was walking close to the edge of the forest, making the best
time that he could, when he heard a shot in the distance. It was
the report of Stabutch's rifle as he fired at Tarzan. The "Gunner"
tried to increase his speed. There was too much doing there, where
he thought Jezebel might be, to permit of loafing; but he was too
exhausted to move rapidly.</p>

<p>Then, a few minutes later, the Russian's scream of agony was
wafted to his ears and again he was goaded on. This was followed by
the uncanny cry of the ape-man, which, for some reason, Danny did
not recognize, though he had heard it twice before. Perhaps the
distance and the intervening trees muffled and changed it.</p>

<p>On he plodded, trying occasionally to run; but his overtaxed
muscles had reached their limit; and he had to give up the attempt,
for already he was staggering and stumbling even at a walk.</p>

<p>"I ain't no good," he muttered; "nothing but a lousy punk.
Here's a guy beatin' it with my girl, and I ain't even got the guts
to work my dogs. Geeze, I'm a flop."</p>

<p>A little farther on he entered the forest so that he could
approach the spot, where he had seen the horses emerge, without
being seen, if Stabutch were still there.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped. Something was crashing through the brush
toward him. He recalled the lion and drew his pocket knife. Then he
hid behind a bush and waited, nor did he have long to wait before
the author of the disturbance broke into view.</p>

<p>"Jezebel!" he cried, stepping into her path. His voice trembled
with emotion.</p>

<p>With a startled scream the girl halted, and then she recognized
him. "Danny!" It was the last straw&mdash;her overwrought nerves
went to pieces; and she sank to the ground, sobbing
hysterically.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" took a step or two toward her. He staggered, his
knees gave beneath him, and he sat down heavily a few yards from
her; and then a strange thing happened. Tears welled to the eyes of
Danny "Gunner" Patrick; he threw himself face down on the ground;
and he, too, sobbed.</p>

<p>For several minutes they lay there, and then Jezebel gained
control of herself and sat up. "Oh, Danny," she cried. "Are you
hurt? Oh, your head! Don't die, Danny."</p>

<p>He had quelled his emotion and was roughly wiping his eyes on
his shirt sleeve. "I ain't dyin'," he said; "but I oughta. Some one
oughta bump me off&mdash;a great big stiff like me, cryin'!"</p>

<p>"It's because you've been hurt, Danny," said Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Naw, it ain't that. I been hurt before, but I ain't bawled
since I was a little kid&mdash;when my mother died. It was
something else. I just blew up when I seen you, and knew that you
was O. K. My nerves went blooey&mdash;just like that!" he snapped
his fingers. "You see," he added, hesitantly, "I guess I like you
an awful lot, kid."</p>

<p>"I like you, Danny," she told him. "You're top hole."</p>

<p>"I'm what? What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Jezebel admitted. "It's English, and you don't
understand English, do you?"</p>

<p>He crawled over closer to her and took her hand in his. "Geeze,"
he said, "I thought I wasn't never goin' to see you again. Say," he
burst out violently, "did that bum hurt you any, kid?"</p>

<p>"The man who took me away from the black men in the village, you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No, Danny. After he killed his friend we rode all night. He was
afraid the black men would catch him."</p>

<p>"What became of the rat? How did you make your getaway?"</p>

<p>She told him all that she knew, but they were unable to account
for the sounds both had heard or to guess whether or not they had
portended the death of Stabutch.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be much good, if he showed up again," said Danny. "I
gotta get my strength back some way."</p>

<p>"You must rest," she told him.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we'll do," he said. "We'll lay around here
until we are rested up a bit; then we'll beat it back up toward the
hills where I know where they's water and something to eat. It
ain't very good food," he added, "but it's better than none. Say, I
got some of it in my pocket. We'll just have a feed now." He
extracted some dirty scraps of half-burned pork from one of his
pockets and surveyed them ruefully.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Jezebel.</p>

<p>"It's pig, kid," he explained. "It don't look so hot, does it?
Well, it don't taste no better than it looks; but it's food, and
that's what we are needin' bad right now. Here, hop to it." He
extended a handful of the scraps toward her. "Shut your eyes and
hold your nose, and it ain't so bad," he assured her. "Just imagine
you're in the old College Inn."</p>

<p>Jezebel smiled and took a piece of the meat. "United States is a
funny language, isn't it, Danny?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know&mdash;is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. Sometimes it sound just like English and yet I
can't understand it at all."</p>

<p>"That's because you ain't used to it," he told her; "but I'll
learn you if you want me to. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Oke, kid," replied Jezebel.</p>

<p>"You're learnin' all right," said Danny, admiringly.</p>

<p>They lay in the growing heat of the new day and talked together
of many things, as they rested. Jezebel told him the story of the
land of Midian, of her childhood, of the eventful coming of Lady
Barbara and its strange effect upon her life; and Danny told her of
Chicago, but there were many things in his own life that he did not
tell her&mdash;things that, for the first time, he was ashamed of.
And he wondered why he was ashamed.</p>

<p>As they talked, Tarzan of the Apes quitted the forest and set
out upon his search for them, going upward toward the hills,
intending to start his search for their spoor at the mouth of the
fissure. If he did not find it there he would know that they were
still in the valley; it he did find it, he would follow it until he
located them.</p>

<p>At break of day a hundred <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> rode out of their village.
They had discovered the body of Capietro, and now they knew that
the Russian had tricked them and fled, after killing their chief.
They wanted the girl for ransom, and they wanted the life of
Stabutch.</p>

<p>They had not ridden far when they met two riderless horses
galloping back toward the village. The <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> recognized them at once, and
knowing that Stabutch and the girl were now afoot they anticipated
little difficulty in overhauling them.</p>

<p>The rolling foothills were cut by swales and canyons; so that at
times the vision of the riders was limited. They had been following
downward along the bottom of a shallow canyon for some time, where
they could neither see to a great distance nor be seen; and then
their leader turned his mount toward higher ground, and as he
topped the summit of a low ridge he saw a man approaching from the
direction of the forest.</p>

<p>Tarzan saw the <a title="bandit, brigand"><i>shifta</i></a>
simultaneously and changed his direction obliquely to the left,
breaking into a trot. He knew that if that lone rider signified a
force of mounted <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> he
would be no match for them; and, guided by the instinct of the wild
beast, he sought ground where the advantage would be with
him&mdash;the rough, rocky ground leading to the cliffs, where no
horse could follow him.</p>

<p>With a yell to his followers, the <a title=
"bandit, brigand"><i>shifta</i></a> chieftain put spurs to his
horse and rode at top speed to intercept the ape-man; and close
behind him came his yelling, savage horde.</p>

<p>Tarzan quickly saw that he could not reach the cliffs ahead of
them; but he maintained his steady, tireless trot that he might be
that much nearer the goal when the attack came. Perhaps he could
hold them off until he reached the sanctuary of the cliffs, but
certainly he had no intention of giving up without exerting every
effort to escape the unequal battle that must follow if they
overtook him.</p>

<p>With savage yells the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> approached, their loose
cotton garments fluttering in the wind, their rifles waving above
their heads. The chief rode in the lead; and when he was near
enough, the ape-man, who had been casting occasional glances
rearward across a brown shoulder, stopped, wheeled and let an arrow
drive at his foe; then he was away again as the shaft sank into the
breast of the <a title="bandit, brigand"><i>shifta</i></a>
chieftain.</p>

<p>With a scream, the fellow rolled from his saddle; and for a
moment the others drew rein, but only for a moment. Here was but a
single enemy, poorly armed with primitive weapons&mdash;he was no
real menace to mounted riflemen.</p>
<a id="pic4" name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src=

"Illustration">
<p class="caption">With a scream, the fellow rolled from his
saddle.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Shouting their anger and their threats of vengeance, they
spurred forward again in pursuit; but Tarzan had gained and the
rocky ground was not far away.</p>

<p>Spreading in a great half circle, the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> sought to surround and head
off their quarry, whose strategy they had guessed the moment that
they had seen the course of his flight. Now another rider ventured
too near, and for a brief instant Tarzan paused to loose another
arrow. As this second enemy fell, mortally wounded, the ape-man
continued his flight to the accompaniment of a rattle of musketry
fire; but soon he was forced to halt again as several of the
horsemen passed him and cut off his line of retreat.</p>

<p>The hail of slugs screaming past him or kicking up the dirt
around him gave him slight concern, so traditionally poor was the
marksmanship of these roving bands of robbers, ill-equipped with
ancient firearms with which, because of habitual shortage of
ammunition, they had little opportunity to practice.</p>

<p>Now they pressed closer, in a rough circle of which he was the
center; and, firing across him from all sides, it seemed impossible
that they should miss him; but miss him they did, though their
bullets found targets among their own men and horses, until one,
who had supplanted the slain chief, took command and ordered them
to cease firing.</p>

<p>Turning again in the direction of his flight, Tarzan tried to
shoot his way through the cordon of horsemen shutting off his
retreat; but, though each arrow sped true to its mark, the yelling
horde closed in upon him until, his last shaft spent, he was the
center of a closely milling mass of shrieking enemies.</p>

<p>Shrilly above the pandemonium of battle rose the cries of the
new leader. "Do not kill! Do not kill!" he screamed. "It is Tarzan
of the Apes, and he is worth the ransom of a <a title=
"prince, chief"><i>ras</i></a>!"</p>

<p>Suddenly a giant black threw himself from his horse full upon
the Lord of the Jungle, but Tarzan seized the fellow and hurled him
back among the horsemen. Yet closer and closer they pressed; and
now several fell upon him from their saddles, bearing him down
beneath the feet of the now frantic horses.</p>

<p>Battling for life and liberty, the ape-man struggled against the
overpowering odds that were being constantly augmented by new
recruits who hurled themselves from their mounts upon the growing
pile that overwhelmed him. Once he managed to struggle to his feet,
shaking most of his opponents from him; but they seized him about
the legs and dragged him down again; and presently succeeded in
slipping nooses about his wrists and ankles, thus effectually
subduing him.</p>

<p>Now that he was harmless many of them reviled and struck him;
but there were many others who lay upon the ground, some never to
rise again. The <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> had
captured the great Tarzan, but it had cost them dear.</p>

<p>Now some of them rounded up the riderless horses, while others
stripped the dead of their weapons, ammunition, and any other
valuables the living coveted. Tarzan was raised to an empty saddle,
where he was securely bound; and four men were detailed to conduct
him and the horses of the dead to the village, the wounded
accompanying them, while the main body of the blacks continued the
search for Stabutch and Jezebel.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24">XXIV.&mdash;THE LONG NIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE sun was high in the heavens when Lady Barbara,
refreshed by her long, undisturbed sleep, stepped from her tent in
the camp of Lord Passmore. A smiling, handsome black boy came
running toward her. "Breakfast soon be ready," he told her. "Lord
Passmore very sorry. He have to go hunt."</p>

<p>She asked after Lafayette Smith and was told that he had just
awakened, nor was it long before he joined her; and soon they were
breakfasting together.</p>

<p>"If Jezebel and your friend were here," she said, "I should be
very happy. I am praying that Tarzan finds them."</p>

<p>"I am sure he will," Smith assured her, "though I am only
worried about Jezebel. Danny can take care of himself."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it seem heavenly to eat a meal again?" the girl
remarked. "Do you know it has been months since I have eaten
anything that even vaguely approximated a civilized meal. Lord
Passmore was fortunate to get such a cook for his safari. I had no
such luck."</p>

<p>"Have you noticed what splendid looking fellows all his men
are?" asked Smith. "They would make that aggregation of mine
resemble fourth rate roustabouts with hookworm and sleeping
sickness."</p>

<p>"There is another very noticeable thing about them," said Lady
Barbara.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"There is not a single piece of cast off European finery among
them&mdash;their garb is native, pure and simple; and, while I'll
have to admit there isn't much to it, it lends a dignity to them
that European clothing would change to the absurd."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," said Smith. "I wonder why I didn't get
a safari like this."</p>

<p>"Lord Passmore is evidently an African traveler and hunter of
long experience. No amateur could hope to attract such men as
these."</p>

<p>"I shall hate to go back to my own camp, if I stay here very
long," said Smith; "but I suppose I'll have to; and that suggests
another unpleasant feature of the change."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I shan't see you any more," he said with a simple directness
that vouched for the sincerity of his regret.</p>

<p>The girl was silent for a moment, as though the suggestion had
aroused a train of thought she had not before considered. "That is
true, isn't it?" she remarked, presently. "We shan't see each other
any more&mdash;but not for always. I'm sure you'll stop and visit
me in London. Isn't it odd what old friends we seem? And yet we
only met two days ago. Or, maybe, it doesn't seem that way to you.
You see I was so long without seeing a human being of my own world
that you were quite like a long lost brother, when you came along
so unexpectedly."</p>

<p>"I have the same feeling," he said&mdash;"as though I had known
you forever&mdash;and&mdash;" he hesitated, "&mdash;as though I
could never get along without you in the future." He flushed a
little as he spoke those last words.</p>

<p>The girl looked up at him with a quick smile&mdash;a
sympathetic, understanding smile. "It was nice of you to say that,"
she said. "Why it sounded almost like a declaration," she added,
with a gay, friendly laugh.</p>

<p>He reached across the little camp table and laid a hand upon
hers. "Accept it as such," he said. "I'm not very good at saying
things&mdash;like that."</p>

<p>"Let's not be serious," she begged. "Really, we scarcely know
each other, after all."</p>

<p>"I have known you always," he replied. "I think we were amoebas
together before the first Cambrian dawn."</p>

<p>"Now you've compromised me," she cried, laughingly, "for I'm
sure there were no chaperons way back there. I hope that you were a
proper amoeba. You didn't kiss me, did you?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for me amoebas have no mouths," he said, "but
I've been profiting by several millions of years of evolution just
to remedy that defect."</p>

<p>"Let's be amoebas again," she suggested.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "for then I couldn't tell you that
I&mdash;I&mdash;" He choked and flushed.</p>

<p>"Please! Please, don't tell me," she cried. "We're such ripping
friends&mdash;don't spoil it."</p>

<p>"Would it spoil it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. It might. I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Can't I ever tell you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, some day," she said.</p>

<p>A sudden burst of distant rifle fire interrupted them. The
blacks in the camp were instantly alert. Many of them sprang to
their feet, and all were listening intently to the sounds of this
mysterious engagement between armed men.</p>

<p>The man and the girl heard the headman speaking to his fellows
in some African dialect. His manner showed no excitement, his tones
were low but clear. It was evident that he was issuing
instructions. The men went quickly to their shelters, and a moment
later Lady Barbara saw the peaceful camp transformed. Every man was
armed now. As by magic a modern rifle and a bandoleer of cartridges
were in the possession of each black. White feathered headdresses
were being adjusted and war paint applied to glossy hides.</p>

<p>Smith approached the headman. "What is the matter?" he asked.
"Is something wrong?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, bwana," replied the black; "but we prepare."</p>

<p>"Is there any danger?" continued the white.</p>

<p>The headman straightened to his full, impressive height. "Are we
not here?" he asked.</p>

<hr>

<p>Jezebel and the "Gunner" were walking slowly in the direction of
the distant water hole and the cached boar meat, following the
bottom of a dip that was the mouth of a small canyon that led up
into the hills.</p>

<p>They were stiff and lame and very tired; and the wound on the
"Gunner's" head pained; but, notwithstanding, they were happy as,
hand in hand, they dragged their weary feet toward water and
food.</p>

<p>"Geeze, kid," said Danny, "it sure is a funny world. Just think,
if I hadn't met old Smithy on board that ship me and you wouldn't
never have met up. It all started from that," but then Danny knew
nothing of Angustus the Ephesian.</p>

<p>"I got a few grand salted away, kid, and when we get out of this
mess we'll go somewhere where nobody doesn't know me and I'll start
over again. Get myself a garage or a filling station, and we'll
have a little flat. Geeze, it's goin' to be great showin' you
things. You don't know what you ain't seen&mdash;movies and
railroads and boats! Geeze! You ain't seen nothin' and nobody ain't
going to show you nothin', only me."</p>

<p>"Yes, Danny," said Jezebel, "it's going to be ripping," and she
squeezed his hand.</p>

<p>Just then they were startled by the sound of rifle fire
ahead.</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked Jezebel.</p>

<p>"It sounded like the Valentine Massacre," said Danny, "but I
guess it's them toughs from the village. We better hide, kid." He
drew her toward some low bushes; and there they lay down, listening
to the shouts and shots that came down to them from where Tarzan
fought for his life and liberty with the odds a hundred to one
against him.</p>

<p>After a while the din ceased, and a little later the two heard
the thudding of many galloping hoofs. The sound increased in volume
as it drew nearer, and Danny and Jezebel tried to make themselves
as small as possible beneath the little bush in the inadequate
concealment of which they were hiding.</p>

<p>At a thundering gallop the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> crossed the swale just above
them, and all but a few had passed when one of the stragglers
discovered them. His shout, which attracted the attention of
others, was carried forward until it reached the new chief, and
presently the entire band had circled back to learn what their
fellow had discovered.</p>

<p>Poor "Gunner"! Poor Jezebel! Their happiness had been short
lived. Their recapture was effected with humiliating ease. Broken
and dejected, they were soon on their way to the village under
escort of two black ruffians.</p>

<p>Bound, hands and feet, they were thrown into the hut formerly
occupied by Capietro and left without food or water upon the pile
of dirty rugs and clothing that littered the floor.</p>

<p>Beside them lay the corpse of the Italian which his followers,
in their haste to overtake his slayer, had not taken the time to
remove. It lay upon its back, the dead eyes staring upward.</p>

<p>Never before in his life had the spirits of Danny Patrick sunk
so low, for the very reason, perhaps, that never in his life had
they risen so high as during the brief interlude of happiness he
had enjoyed following his reunion with Jezebel. Now he saw no hope
ahead, for, with the two white men eliminated, he feared that he
might not even be able to dicker with these ignorant black men for
the ransom that he would gladly pay to free Jezebel and
himself.</p>

<p>"There goes the garage, the filling station, and the flat," he
said, lugubriously.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Flooie," explained Danny.</p>

<p>"But you are here with me," said the golden one; "so I do not
care what else there is."</p>

<p>"That's nice, kid; but I ain't much help, all tied up like a
Christmas present. They sure picked out a swell bed for
me&mdash;feels like I was lyin' on a piece of the kitchen stove."
He rolled himself to one side and nearer Jezebel. "That's better,"
he said, "but I wonder what was that thing I was parked on."</p>

<p>"Maybe your friend will come and take us away," suggested
Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Who, Smithy? What would he take us with&mdash;that dinky toy
pistol of his?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of the other that you told me about."</p>

<p>"Oh, that Tarzan guy! Say kid, if he knew we was here he'd walk
in and push all these nutty dumps over with one mitt and kick the
whole gang over the back fence. Geeze, you bet I wish he was here.
There is one big shot, and I don't mean maybe."</p>

<p>In a hut on the edge of the village was the answer to the
"Gunner's" wish, bound hand and foot, as was the "Gunner," and,
apparently, equally helpless. Constantly the ape-man was working on
the thongs that confined his wrists&mdash;twisting, tugging,
pulling.</p>

<p>The long day wore on and never did the giant captive cease his
efforts to escape; the thongs were heavy and securely tied, yet
little by little he felt that they were loosening.</p>

<p>Towards evening the new chief returned with the party that had
been searching for Stabutch. They had not found him; but scouts had
located the camp of Lord Passmore, and now the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> were discussing plans for
attacking it on the morrow.</p>

<p>They had not come sufficiently close to it to note the number of
armed natives it contained; but they had glimpsed Smith and Lady
Barbara; and, being sure that there were not more than two white
men, they felt little hesitation in attempting the raid, since they
were planning to start back for Abyssinia on the morrow.</p>

<p>"We will kill the white man we now have," said the chief, "and
carry the two girls and Tarzan with us. Tarzan should bring a good
ransom and the girls a good price."</p>

<p>"Why not keep the girls for ourselves," suggested another.</p>

<p>"We shall sell them," said the chief.</p>

<p>"Who are you, to say what we shall do?" demanded the other. "You
are no chief."</p>

<p>"No," growled a villainous-looking black squatting beside the
first objector.</p>

<p>He who would be chief leaped, catlike, upon the first speaker,
before any was aware of his purpose. A sword gleamed for an instant
in the light of the new made cook fires and fell with terrific
force upon the skull of the victim.</p>

<p>"Who am I?" repeated the killer, as he wiped the bloody blade
upon the garment of the slain man. "I am chief!" He looked around
upon the scowling faces about him. "Is there any who says I am not
chief?" There was no demur. Ntale was chief of the <a title=
"bandit, brigand"><i>shifta</i></a> band.</p>

<p>Inside the dark interior of the hut where he had lain bound all
day without food or water the ape-man tugged and pulled until the
sweat stood in beads upon his body, but not in vain. Gradually a
hand slipped through the stretched thong, and he was free. Or at
least his hands were, and it took them but a moment to loosen the
bonds that secured his ankles.</p>

<p>With a low, inaudible growl he rose to his feet and stepped to
the doorway. Before him lay the village compound. He saw the
<a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> squatting about
while slaves prepared the evening meal. Nearby was the palisade.
They must see him as he crossed to it, but what matter?</p>

<p>He would be gone before they could gather their wits. Perhaps a
few stray shots would be fired; but then, had they not fired many
shots at him this morning, not one of which had touched him?</p>

<p>He stepped out into the open, and at the same instant a burly
black stepped from the next hut and saw him. With a shout of
warning to his fellows the man leaped upon the escaping prisoner.
Those at the fires sprang to their feet and came running toward the
two.</p>

<p>Within their prison hut Jezebel and Danny heard the commotion
and wondered.</p>

<p>The ape-man seized the black who would have stopped him and
wheeling him about to form a shield for himself, backed quickly
toward the palisade.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," he called to the advancing <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a>, in their own dialect. "Stay
where you are, or I will kill this man."</p>

<p>"Let him kill him then," growled Ntale. "He is not worth the
ransom we are losing," and with a shout of encouragement to his
followers he leaped quickly forward to intercept the ape-man.</p>

<p>Tarzan was already near the palisade as Ntale charged. He raised
the struggling black above his head and hurled him upon the
advancing chief, and as the two went down he wheeled and ran for
the palisade.</p>

<p>Like Manu the monkey he scaled the high barrier. A few scattered
shots followed him, but he dropped to the ground outside unscathed
and disappeared in the growing gloom of the advancing night.</p>

<p>The long night of their captivity dragged on and still the
"Gunner" and Jezebel lay as they had been left, without food or
drink, while the silent corpse of Capietro stared at the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't treat nobody like this," said the "Gunner," "not
even a rat."</p>

<p>Jezebel raised herself to one elbow. "Why not try it?" she
whispered.</p>

<p>"What?" demanded Danny. "I'd try anything once."</p>

<p>"What you said about a rat made me think of it," said Jezebel.
"We have lots of rats in the land of Midian. Sometimes we catch
them&mdash;they are very good to eat. We make traps, but if we do
not kill the rats soon after they are caught they gnaw their way to
freedom&mdash;they gnaw the cords which bind the traps
together."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" demanded Danny. "We ain't got no rats, and
if we had&mdash;well, I won't say I wouldn't eat 'em kid; but I
don't see what it's got to do with the mess we're in."</p>

<p>"We're like the rats, Danny," she said. "Don't you see? We're
like the rats and&mdash;we can gnaw our way to freedom!"</p>

<p>"Well, kid," said Danny, "if you want to gnaw your way through
the side of this hut, hop to it; but if I gets a chance to duck I'm
goin' through the door."</p>

<p>"You do not understand, Danny," insisted Jezebel. "You are an
egg that cannot talk. I mean that I can gnaw the cords that fasten
your wrists together."</p>

<p>"Geeze, kid!" exclaimed Danny. "Dumb ain't no name for it, and I
always thought I was the bright little boy. You sure got a bean,
and I don't mean maybe."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what you are talking about, Danny," said Jezebel,
"and I wish you would let me try to gnaw the cords from your wrist.
Can't you understand what I'm talking about?"</p>

<p>"Sure, kid, but I'll do the gnawing&mdash;my jaws are tougher.
Roll over, and I'll get busy. When you're free you can untie
me."</p>

<p>Jezebel rolled over on her stomach and Danny wriggled into
position where he could reach the thongs at her wrists with his
teeth. He fell to work with a will, but it was soon evident to him
that the job was going to be much more difficult than he had
anticipated.</p>

<p>He found, too, that he was very weak and soon tired; but though
often he was forced to stop through exhaustion, he never gave up.
Once, when he paused to rest, he kissed the little hands that he
was trying to liberate. It was a gentle, reverent kiss, quite
unlike the "Gunner," but then love is a strange force, and when it
is aroused in the breast of a man by a clean and virtuous woman it
makes him always a little tenderer and a little better.</p>

<p>Dawn was lifting the darkness within the hut, and still the
"Gunner" gnawed upon the thongs that it seemed would never part.
Capietro lay staring at the ceiling, his dead eyes rolled upward,
just as he had lain there staring through all the long hours of the
night, unseeing.</p>

<p>The <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> were
stirring in the village, for this was to be a busy day. Slaves were
preparing the loads of camp equipment and plunder that they were to
carry toward the north. The fighting men were hastening their
breakfasts that they might look to their weapons and their horse
gear before riding out on their last raid from this village,
against the camp of the English hunter.</p>

<p>Ntale the chief was eating beside the fire of his favorite wife.
"Make haste, woman," he said. "I have work to do before we
ride."</p>

<p>"You are chief now," she reminded him. "Let others work."</p>

<p>"This thing I do myself," replied the black man.</p>

<p>"What do you do that is so important that I must hasten the
preparation of the morning meal?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I go to kill the white man and get the girl ready for the
journey," he replied. "Have food prepared for her. She must eat or
she will die."</p>

<p>"Let her die," replied the woman. "I do not want her around.
Kill them both."</p>

<p>"Shut thy mouth!" snapped the man. "I am chief."</p>

<p>"If you do not kill her, I shall," said the woman. "I shall not
cook for any white bitch."</p>

<p>The man rose. "I go to kill the man," he said. "Have breakfast
for the girl when I return with her."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap25" id="chap25">XXV.&mdash;THE WAZIRI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"THERE!" gasped the "Gunner."</p>

<p>"I am free!" exclaimed Jezebel.</p>

<p>"And my jaws is wore out," said Danny.</p>

<p>Quickly Jezebel turned and worked upon the thongs that confined
the "Gunner's" wrists before taking the time to loose her ankles.
Her fingers were quite numb, for the cords had partially cut off
the circulation from her hands; and she was slow and bungling at
the work. It seemed to them both that she would never be done. Had
they known that Ntale had already arisen from his breakfast fire
with the announcement that he was going to kill the "Gunner," they
would have been frantic; but they did not know it, and perhaps that
were better, since to Jezebel's other handicaps was not added the
nervous tension that surely would have accompanied a knowledge of
the truth.</p>

<p>But at last the "Gunner's" hands were free; and then both fell
to work upon the cords that secured their ankles, which were less
tightly fastened.</p>

<p>At last the "Gunner" arose. "The first thing I do," he said, "is
to find out what I was lyin' on yesterday. It had a familiar feel
to it; and, if I'm right&mdash;boy!"</p>

<p>He rummaged among the filthy rags at the end of the hut, and a
moment later straightened up with a Thompson submachine gun in one
hand and his revolver, belt and holster in the other&mdash;a grin
on his face.</p>

<p>"This is the first break I've had in a long time," he said.
"Everything's jake now, sister."</p>

<p>"What are those things?" asked Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Them's the other half of 'Gunner' Patrick," replied Danny.
"Now, bring on the dirty rats!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, Ntale the chief drew aside the rug at the doorway
and looked in. The interior of the hut was rather dark, and at
first glance he could not make out the figures of the girl and the
man standing at the far side; but, silhouetted as he was against
the growing morning light beyond the doorway, he was plainly
visible to his intended victim; and Danny saw that the man carried
a pistol ready in his hand.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" had already buckled his belt about him. Now he
transferred the machine gun to his left hand and drew his revolver
from its holster. He did these things quickly and silently. So
quickly that, as he fired, Ntale had not realized that his
prisoners were free of their bonds&mdash;a thing he never knew, as,
doubtless, he never heard the report of the shot that killed
him.</p>

<p>At the same instant that the "Gunner" fired, the report of his
revolver was drowned by yells and a shot from a sentry at the gate,
to whom the coming day had revealed a hostile force creeping upon
the village.</p>

<p>As Danny Patrick stepped over the dead body of the chief and
looked out into the village he realized something of what had
occurred. He saw men running hastily toward the village gates and
scrambling to the banquette. He heard a fusillade of shots that
spattered the palisade, splintering the wood and tearing through to
fill the village with a screaming, terror stricken mob.</p>

<p>His knowledge of such things told him that only high powered
rifles could send their projectiles through the heavy wood of the
palisade. He saw the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> on the banquette returning
the fire with their antiquated muskets. He saw the slaves and
prisoners cowering in a corner of the village that was freer from
the fire of the attackers than other portions.</p>

<p>He wondered who the enemies of the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> might be, and past
experience suggested only two possibilities&mdash;either a rival
"gang" or the police.</p>

<p>"I never thought I'd come to it, kid," he said.</p>

<p>"Come to what, Danny?"</p>

<p>"I hate to tell you what I been hopin'," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Danny," she said. "I won't be angry."</p>

<p>"I been hopin' them guys out there was cops. Just think of that,
kid! Me, 'Gunner' Patrick, a-hopin' the cops would come!"</p>

<p>"What are cops, Danny?"</p>

<p>"Laws, harness bulls&mdash;Geeze, kid, why do you ask so many
questions? Cops is cops. And I'll tell you why I hope it's them. If
it ain't cops it's a rival mob, and we'd get just as tough a break
with them as with these guys."</p>

<p>He stepped out into the village street. "Well," he said, "here
goes Danny Patrick smearin' up with the police. You stay here, kid,
and lie down on your bread basket, so none of them slugs'll find
you, while I go out and push the smokes around."</p>

<p>Before the gate was a great crowd of <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> firing through openings at
the enemy beyond. The "Gunner" knelt and raised the machine gun to
his shoulder. There was the vicious b-r-r-r as of some titanic
rattle snake; and a dozen of the massed <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> collapsed, dead or
screaming, to the ground.</p>

<p>The others turned and, seeing the "Gunner," realized that they
were caught between two fires, for they remembered the recent
occasion upon which they had witnessed the deadly effects of this
terrifying weapon.</p>

<p>The "Gunner" spied Ogonyo among the prisoners and slaves huddled
not far from where he stood, and the sight of him suggested an idea
to the white man.</p>

<p>"Hey! Big feller, you!" He waved his hand to Ogonyo. "Come here!
Bring all them guys with you. Tell 'em to grab anything they can
fight with if they want to make their getaway."</p>

<p>Whether or not Ogonyo understood even a small part of what the
"Gunner" said, he seemed at least to grasp the main idea; and
presently the whole mob of prisoners and slaves, except the women,
had placed themselves behind Danny.</p>

<p>The firing from the attacking force had subsided somewhat since
Danny's typewriter had spoken, as though the leader of that other
party had recognized its voice and guessed that white prisoners
within the village might be menaced by his rifle fire. Only an
occasional shot, aimed at some specific target, was coming into the
village.</p>

<p>The <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> had regained
their composure to some extent and were preparing their horses and
mounting, with the evident intention of executing a sortie. They
were leaderless and confused, half a dozen shouting advice and
instructions at the same time.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Danny advanced upon them with his
motley horde armed with sticks and stones, an occasional knife and
a few swords hastily stolen from the huts of their captors.</p>

<p>As the <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> realized
that they were menaced thus seriously from the rear, the "Gunner"
opened fire upon them for the second time, and the confusion that
followed in the village compound gave the attackers both within and
without a new advantage.</p>

<p>The <a title="bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> fought among
themselves for the loose horses that were now stampeding in terror
about the village; and as a number of them succeeded in mounting
they rode for the village gates, overthrowing those who had
remained to defend them. Some among them forced the portals open;
and as the horsemen dashed out they were met by a band of black
warriors, above whose heads waved white plumes, and in whose hands
were modern high powered rifles.</p>

<p>The attacking force had been lying partially concealed behind a
low ridge, and as it rose to meet the escaping <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> the savage war cry of the
Waziri rang above the tumult of the battle.</p>

<p>First to the gates was Tarzan, war chief of the Waziri, and
while Muviro and a small detachment accounted for all but a few of
the horsemen who had succeeded in leaving the village, the ape-man,
with the remaining Waziri, charged the demoralized remnants of
Capietro's band that remained within the palisade.</p>

<p>Surrounded by enemies, the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> threw down their rifles and
begged for mercy, and soon they were herded into a corner of the
village under guard of a detachment of the Waziri.</p>

<p>As Tarzan greeted the "Gunner" and Jezebel he expressed his
relief at finding them unharmed.</p>

<p>"You sure come at the right time," Danny told him. "This old
typewriter certainly chews up the ammunition, and that last burst
just about emptied the drum; but say, who are your friends? Where
did you raise this mob?"</p>

<p>"They are my people," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Some gang!" ejaculated the "Gunner," admiringly; "but say, have
you seen anything of old Smithy?"</p>

<p>"He is safe at my camp."</p>

<p>"And Barbara," asked Jezebel; "where is she?"</p>

<p>"She is with Smith," replied Tarzan. "You will see them both in
a few hours. We start back as soon as I arrange for the disposal of
these people." He turned away and commenced to make inquiries among
the prisoners of the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a>.</p>

<p>"Is he not beautiful!" exclaimed Jezebel.</p>

<p>"Hey, sister, can that 'beautiful' stuff," warned the 'Gunner,'
"and from now on remember that I'm the only 'beautiful' guy you
know, no matter what my pan looks like."</p>

<p>Quickly Tarzan separated the prisoners according to their tribes
and villages, appointed headmen to lead them back their homes, and
issued instructions to them as he explained his plans.</p>

<p>The weapons, ammunition, loot and belongings of the <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a>, were divided among the
prisoners, after the Waziri had been allowed to select such trifles
as they desired. The captured <a title=
"bandits, brigands"><i>shiftas</i></a> were placed in charge of a
large band of Gallas with orders to return them to Abyssinia and
turn them over to the nearest <a title=
"prince, chief"><i>ras</i></a>.</p>

<p>"Why not hang them here?" asked the Galla headman. "We shall
then save all the food they would eat on the long march back to our
country, besides saving us much trouble and worry in guarding
them&mdash;for the <a title="prince, chief"><i>ras</i></a> will
certainly hang them."</p>

<p>"Take them back, as I tell you," replied Tarzan. "But if they
give you trouble do with them as you see fit."</p>

<p>It took little more than an hour to evacuate the village. All of
Smith's loads were recovered, including Danny's precious ammunition
and extra drums for his beloved Thompson; and these were assigned
to Smith's porters, who were once again assembled under Ogonyo.</p>

<p>When the village was emptied it was fired in a dozen places;
and, as the black smoke curled up toward the blue heavens, the
various parties took their respective ways from the scene of their
captivity, but not before the several headmen had come and knelt
before the Lord of the Jungle and thanked him for the deliverance
of their people.</p>

<h2><a name="chap26" id="chap26">XXVI.&mdash;THE LAST KNOT IS
TIED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LAFAYETTE SMITH and Lady Barbara had been
mystified witnesses to the sudden transformation of the peaceful
scene in the camp of Lord Passmore. All day the warriors had
remained in readiness, as though expecting a summons; and when
night fell they still waited.</p>

<p>Evidences of restlessness were apparent; and there was no
singing and little laughter in the camp, as there had been before.
The last that the two whites saw, as they retired for the night,
were the little groups of plumed warriors squatting about their
fires, their rifles ready to their hands; and they were asleep when
the summons came and the sleek, black fighting men melted silently
into the dark shadows of the forest, leaving only four of their
number to guard the camp and the two guests.</p>

<p>When Lady Barbara emerged from her tent in the morning she was
astonished to find the camp all but deserted. The <i>boy</i> who
acted in the capacity of personal servant and cook for her and
Smith was there and three other blacks. All were constantly armed;
but their attitude toward her had not changed, and she felt only
curiosity relative to the other altered conditions, so obvious at
first glance, rather than apprehension.</p>

<p>When Smith joined her a few minutes later he was equally at a
loss to understand the strange metamorphosis that had transformed
the laughing, joking porters and <a title=
"native soldiers"><i>askaris</i></a> into painted warriors and sent
them out into the night so surreptitiously, nor could they glean
the slightest information from their boy, who, though still
courteous and smiling, seemed by some strange trick of fate
suddenly to have forgotten the very fair command of English that he
had exhibited with evident pride on the previous day.</p>

<p>The long day dragged on until mid-afternoon without sign of any
change. Neither Lord Passmore nor the missing blacks returned, and
the enigma was as baffling as before. The two whites, however,
seemed to find much pleasure in one another's company; and so,
perhaps, the day passed more rapidly for them than it did for the
four blacks, waiting and listening through the hot, drowsy
hours.</p>

<p>But suddenly there was a change. Lady Barbara saw her <i>boy</i>
rise and stand in an attitude of eager listening. "They come!" he
said, in his own tongue, to his companions. Now they all stood and,
though they may have expected only friends, their rifles were in
readiness for enemies.</p>

<p>Gradually the sound of voices and of marching men became
distinctly audible to the untrained ears of the two whites, and a
little later they saw the head of a column filing through the
forest toward them.</p>

<p>"Why, there's the 'Gunner!'" exclaimed Lafayette Smith. "And
Jezebel, too. How odd that they should be together."</p>

<p>"With Tarzan of the Apes!" cried Lady Barbara. "He has saved
them both."</p>

<p>A slow smile touched the lips of the ape-man as he witnessed the
reunion of Lady Barbara and Jezebel and that between Smith and the
"Gunner," and it broadened a little, when, after the first burst of
greetings and explanations, Lady Barbara said, "It is unfortunate
that our host, Lord Passmore, isn't here."</p>

<p>"He is," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Lafayette Smith, looking about the camp.</p>

<p>"I am Lord Passmore," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You?" exclaimed Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"Yes. I assumed this role when I came north to investigate the
rumors I had heard concerning Capietro and his band, believing that
they not only would suspect no danger, but hoping, also, that they
would seek to attack and plunder my safari as they have those of
others."</p>

<p>"Geeze," said the "Gunner." "What a jolt they would of got!"</p>

<p>"That is why we never saw Lord Passmore," said Lady Barbara,
laughing. "I thought him a most elusive host."</p>

<p>"The first night I left you here," explained Tarzan, "I walked
into the jungle until I was out of sight, and then I came back from
another direction and entered my tent from the rear. I slept there
all night. The next morning, early, I left in search of your
friends&mdash;and was captured myself. But everything has worked
out well, and if you have no other immediate plans I hope that you
will accompany me back to my home and remain a while as my guests
while you recover from the rather rough experiences Africa has
afforded you. Or, perhaps," he added, "Professor Smith and his
friend wish to continue their geological investigations."</p>

<p>"I, ah, well, you see," stammered Lafayette Smith; "I have about
decided to abandon my work in Africa and devote my life to the
geology of England. We, or, er&mdash;you see, Lady
Barbara&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am going to take him back to England and teach him to shoot
before I let him return to Africa. Possibly we shall come back
later, though."</p>

<p>"And you, Patrick," asked Tarzan, "are you remaining to hunt,
perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Nix, mister," said Danny, emphatically, "We're goin' to
California and buy a garage and filling station."</p>

<p>"We?" queried Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"Sure," said the 'Gunner,' "me and Jez."</p>

<p>"Really?" exclaimed Lady Barbara. "Is he in earnest,
Jezebel?"</p>

<p>"Oke, kid&mdash;isn't it ripping?" replied the golden one.</p>
