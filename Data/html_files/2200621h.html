<h2>Production Note</h2>

<p>This ebook, <b>Volume II</b> of Holt's memoirs, is
primarily concerned with Holt's life in Australia from 1799 to
1812.</p>

<p><a href="https://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#holtj">Volume
I</a> of Holt's Memoirs provides details of his early life, to the time when he sailed to New South Wales. Holt is perhaps best known for his involvement in <i>The Battle of Vinegar Hill</i>.</p>

<p class="poem">"All have heard, sure, of Vinegar Hill,<br>
Likewise of the battle of Tara,<br>
Of General Holt and his men<br>

<h2>Ebook editors note:</h2>

<p>The original "Table of Contents" in Holt's Journal consists of
one long paragraph at the beginning of each volume containing the
contents of that volume. The editor supplied a heading for each
page of the book, sometimes the same heading for several pages, and
these headings are referred to in the "contents" paragraph,
separated by the page number on which each event is described in
the Journal (e.g. "Return of Holt to Parramatta, 118.").</p>

<p>These page descriptions have been omitted from this ebook and no
page numbers are shown. Instead, the ebook has been divided into
chapters, with titles provided by myself.</p>

<p>Where dates are provided in the journal, these are included as a

<hr><h2><a name="ch0"></a>Preface [from Volume I]</h2>

<p>The reasons which led to printing, in this country, the memoirs
of Theobald Wolfe Tone, are the same which induce the publisher
to submit to the public the memoirs of Joseph Holt; in the first
place, as presenting "a most curious and characteristic piece of
auto-biography," and in the second, as calculated to gratify the
general desire for information on the affairs of Ireland.

<p>"The famous chieftain, Holt," as the writer of these volumes is termed
in the Annual Register for 1798, was perhaps the most enterprizing
and distinguished leader of the Irish rebels in the field, and under
rather singular circumstances. Few, if any, of the original projectors
of the rebellion of 1798, the men who laid the foundation of that
event, were actors in the warfare which followed the development of
their revolutionary speculations; most of the early conspirators were
arrested either before or immediately upon the out-burst of actual
hostilities, and their places were supplied by weak, ambitious, and
irresolute men, who soon found themselves supplanted by fanatics and
cowards.

<p>"If the leaders of <i>the business</i>" Holt has remarked, in conversation with
Sir William Betham, "were not fanatics, fools, or cowards, how could
it have come to pass that an almost uneducated man like myself should
have obtained so much influence as to become a commander over thirteen
thousand men, most of whom hated the Protestant religion, which I had
been brought up in and always professed?"

<p>Against the latter part of this statement it may be urged, that so far
from the rebellion of 1798, being a Roman Catholic conspiracy to
overthrow the Protestant Church, that a majority of Protestants were
engaged as leaders in it particularly at the commencement, and that
they were in fact the persons with whom the design originated; but I
believe it will be found upon investigation, that these men, although
nominally Protestants, that is, of Protestant descent or connexions,
were actually either Deists or Atheists, like the Jacobins of France,
whose proceedings had inflamed the imaginations of irreligious men,
with a desire to see a new order of things. But at the period when Holt
became connected with the Irish rebels, there can be no question that
the grand bond of union which held them together was the Roman Catholic
religion, and that they were engaged in a confederacy against all
within what was regarded the heretical pale of the Protestant Church.

<p>Holt, however, possessed many of the qualifications necessary to form
a great commander. He was a man of keen observation, extraordinary
physical energy, and cool and undaunted courage; with a mind fertile
in expedient at the
critical moment of impending danger. These traits in his character,
especially when contrasted with the want of thought, the alarm and the
indecision of other rebel leaders, inspired respect and confidence
in him; and his humanity and love of justice made Holt admired and
esteemed by those under him, of whom he considered himself as the
natural protector. His orders were therefore implicitly obeyed, and
generally with cheerful alacrity, by men, who, while they detested his
creed, loved the individual even before the ministers of their own
religion.

<p>It was the possession of these superior qualities&mdash;for Holt's acts were
his own, he had no instructor; added to his strict enforcement of
discipline, and attention to the comforts and wants of his men, that
enabled him, as the leader of a war of mountain skirmishes, to defy for
six months the united efforts of the Royal Army, and the numerous corps
of yeomanry in an area of little more than twenty miles square, within
thirty miles of Dublin at its further, and eight or ten at its nearest
point of approach.
Nor was this by skulking in the wild and secluded districts of bog
and mountain which the county of Wicklow presents, a county, the
appearance whereof was most happily compared by Dean Swift to a
frieze mantle fringed with gold lace. Holt frequently came in contact
with detachments of the army sent against him, and seldom shunned an
engagement. In one instance, by the melancholy slaughter of a large
body of the "Ancient Britons," he executed what in military parlance
would be termed a brilliant affair, and when Holt was beaten or
out-numbered, he generally contrived to effect his retreat without'
any serious loss. On one occasion, in particular, when he was supposed
to be surrounded by the King's troops, Holt retired with his corps
unbroken.

<p>According to his own statement. Holt became a rebel against his
inclination, and having become one, he was the more formidable because
he was honest and faithful to his engagement. He proudly asserts, that
he never gave information or betrayed his cornpanions, and further
says, that he twice rejected an offer made to him on
the part of Government, of a command against his former followers and
associates. Holt also boasts that he never committed an act of wanton
cruelty, nor was guilty of murder in cold blood; and his detestation
of robbery is shewn by his having denounced to the officer commanding
the King's troops a gang of robbers who had laid the country under
contribution in Holt's name. In short, Holt represents himself as a
terrible enemy, but a generous and humane conqueror, who was unwilling
to spill blood in savage retaliation, or to allow it to be shed for
'revenge, and who, on all occasions restrained unnecessary plunder.
Although somewhat given to be a fatalist, Holt appears to have been
a sincerely religious man, and to have fervently believed in the
superintending providence and protection of the Almighty, a sentiment
which seems to have been ever uppermost in his mind, and to have
cheered and supported him through his extraordinary trials.

<p>In following his narrative it will be perceived that his belief was not
without some grounds of evidence; many hair-breadth escapes were
occasioned by his uneasy dreams when in imminent danger, and there is an
apparent interposition of Providence in his escape from an ignominious
death. Religious and moral reflections are of constant occurrence
in Holt's account of his adventures, and even the pious phraseology
sometimes used by him, and short attempts at hymn-like versification,
are indications of the character of the man.

<p>Holt was probably unjustly denounced as an United Irishman by the
friends of some of the many culprits he had apprehended and brought to
justice. In times of civil convulsion and rebellion, private malice
often suggests guilt, and the suggestion brings the consequences of
actual culpability on the innocent. This might have been the case with
respect to Holt; unless, indeed, that, having heard of the meditated
insurrection, " he felt a mysterious call that way which, however, does
not appear likely, taking into account Holt's circumstances as well as
the tone of his mind.

<p>Considering the period, and admitting that Holt had been unjustly
denounced as an
United Irishman, he shrewdly calculated his position when he says, that
by joining the rebels he had a chance of escape, but by submitting to
the enemies who had burned his house and destroyed his property, on a
false accusation, nothing but certain destruction awaited him.

<p>The accusation made by Holt against a gentleman of fortune and rank,
whose injustice and oppression, he would have it believed, drove him
into rebellion, is, perhaps, much exaggerated, and probably the entire
affair is misrepresented; but we may fairly imagine that some quarrel
which existed between the parties made the individual alluded to, more
credulous, than he might or would have been at a different and less
critical period, of any assertion respecting the treasonable intentions
of Holt; and, therefore, it is possible that Holt's house may have been
burned upon very slight grounds for suspicion. The parties are now gone
to their account, where both cease to trouble and are at rest, and
although, as the editor of Holt's memoirs, I could not refrain from
giving his own statement correctly, the omission of the name will, I
trust, be
an evidence of my wish to veil, as far as possible, the occurrence.
Great, indeed, should be the allowance made for the excitement and
irritation in Ireland of the year 1798; all statements relative to
which should be received with the utmost caution, though nothing can
be too horrible for belief. There can be no doubt that much injustice
and cruelty were perpetrated on very slight testimony, and often on
mere rumour, by persons who, in peaceable times, would have shuddered
with revolting disgust at the mere contemplation; so do times and
circumstances change not only the complexion of things, but the very
nature of man.

<p>Long after the hopes of success of the United Irishmen had been
dissipated, Holt supported himself in the Wicklow mountains; at last,
after many almost miraculous escapes, he succeeded in obtaining terms,
through the negotiation of Mrs. Latouche with Lord Powerscourt, to
whom he surrendered himself on the 10th November, 1798. Holt's life
was secured to him on condition of transportation to New South Wales,
where, having conducted himself well, he obtained a
free pardon, and returned to Ireland. During his latter years he lived
in apparent comfort and respectability at Kingstown, near Dublin, and
died there on the 16th May, 1826.

<p>In the <i>Dublin and London Magazine</i> for July, 1826, the following notice
of Holt occurs:&mdash;

<p><p class="newspaper">"This insurrectionary chieftain has at length gone
to the house appointed for all living.' He had been residing in New Dunleary,
or Kingstown, for nearly the last seven years, and had succeeded in
gaining the friendship or goodwill of most of his neighbours; there
were a few, to be sure, whom no concession, no care on his part,
could thoroughly soften. The men of the old ascendancy school, the
deeply dyed 'true-blues,' could never forget the General's earlier
transgressions. His subsequent good conduct and peaceable demeanour
could never, in their eyes, atone for the past. This unmitigated spirit
of hostility seriously annoyed poor Holt, for it was his wish to be on
friendly terms with all.<br>
<br>
"I first met him soon after his arrival at Dunleary. He had been
engaged in Dublin for a short time in the public business, but the noise
and confusion attending such a trade disturbed him. He was getting
old, and, as he told me, he was now anxious for rest and retirement.
He said he had secured a sufficiency for the remainder of his days,
emphatically adding, that though it came from Botany Bay, it had been
fairly and honourably earned.<br>
<br>
"I was eager to hear from him something of his exploits in
ninety-eight. He said there were many of those transactions that he did
not like to dwell on. He had done many things in the heat of passion
that he afterwards bitterly repented of. He was like many other
well-meaning men, <i>forced</i> to become a rebel, against his better judgment and
inclination. Holt was a substantial farmer in the county of Wicklow,
he dealt largely in wool; he was a Protestant,
and, for a time, barony constable, a post seldom
filled by men of questionable loyalty. He was
a man of good heart, and of liberal principles; he could not join his
Orange neighbours in insulting or injuring those who held another
creed. He was constantly the humble advocate of his Catholic brethren,
and this, in the eyes of the
ultras, was a sort of apostacy, it was worse than the sin of popery
itself. He, consequently, became what was then called a marked man. He
was cursed with an over-loyal squireen for a neighbour. This little
tyrant annoyed him in various ways; he denounced Holt as one of the
disaffected, and at length, when the rebellion broke out, he proceeded
with a troop of yeomanry to his dwelling for the purpose of arresting
him. The latter was away at Carnew on business; the women fled as
they saw their old enemy approaching, not calculating much on his
forbearance, and the loyal band, after searching the place, found a few
letters, which they construed into treason. They instantly set fire to
the house, and Holt on his return home found but a heap of ashes, where
he had so recently left a comfortable farm house and a large haggard of
corn."</p>

<p>The history of Holt is still kept alive in the memory of the Irish
peasantry by various popular songs, especially one entitled "The Victim
of Tyranny," which thus commences:&mdash;

<p><p class="poem">
"I had a tyrant landlord, base,<br>
Who saw my heart to Erin yearned.<br>
He to the ground my Cot did raze.<br>
And fired my substance dearly earned.<br>
Unmoved, remorseless, he beheld<br>
My Cottage falling, as it burned;<br>
His savage band insulting yelled.<br>
Nor from their deed of ruin turned."

<p>All that has been hitherto advanced, places Holt's character in
its most favourable light, and it now becomes the editor's duty to
acknowledge that his Hero, estimating him by his own statements, was an
exceedingly vain man, and the consequence is, that he often inflates
facts into nearly that extreme state of expansion, that the slightest
attack from the lance of an assailant is formidable as to the buoyancy
of Holt's veracity. It is impossible, for instance, to believe that
three hundred and seventy of the Royal troops were slaughtered by
Holt's rebel band at Ballyellis, in less than twenty minutes, although
there can be no doubt that this surprise was well managed on the part
of the rebels, and that Sir Watkin Wynne's corps sustained a serious
loss. Neither
is there any doubt that a discussion occurred between Lord Strangford,
and Admiral (the late Sir Manley),Dixon, respecting the condemnation
of the Nannina, an American vessel, which had been seized by an
English brig-of-war, at the Falkland Islands, in the act of rendering
assistance to shipwrecked British subjects; but that the American,
Spanish, Dutch, and French ministers were parties to this question,
could scarcely be credited, whether Lord Strangford had done me the
favour or not of placing this point beyond dispute.

<p>Holt is also very free of his abuse, which is vented in a vein of
vulgar satirical humour, against all with whom he happens to differ,
and his irritable temper betrays itself in many quaint impertinences.
To the editor it has been a most painful duty to preserve these
ebullitions of Holt's feeling towards individuals, but it was
impossible to omit passages so characteristic of the man.

<p>The aspersion of the conduct of Major Foveaux by Holt, is so extremely
gross in every particular, and Holt, upon all occasions, mentions
the name of that officer with so much evident malice, that
the editor hesitated whether he should not expunge the name, and
suppress the passages in question. He at length determined that Holt's
defamation should stand, feeling satisfied that the vindictive spirit
which animated Major Foveaux's accuser would be the best answer to
assertions which Holt had taken every opportunity of disseminating, and
that insinuation or suppression is always worse than direct accusation.
Had Holt's abuse of Major Foveaux been expressed in less decided- terms
than those of profligate, tyrant, and murderer, his statements might
have obtained that credence which it is now impossible to give them.

<p>Remarks of a similar tendency may be made with reference to other
individuals.

<p>If as an impartial editor, I am bound to make what in Ireland is called
"a clean beast of it," I must say that in many cases, notwithstanding
the honest pains that I have taken to support every statement of
Holt's by quotations from respectable authorities, there is an evident
over-colouring in his Memoirs, and that they
must be received with due allowance as an ex-parte statement. That
Holt has suppressed certain passages in his life, I have not the
slightest doubt, having in particular reason for believing that he
did give information to Government when in the Cove of Cork, of the
existence of an important conspiracy among the United Irishmen of the
Southern districts j and further, that this information was given at
his interview with General Meyers, and Sir Charles Ross, which he has
so minutely detailed. But notwithstanding this, and no doubt other
similar omissions, and the exaggeration of various points, which add
to, as the omissions noticed would detract from, the romance of Holt's
narrative, I am inclined to believe that his Memoirs are substantially
correct, and convey accurately enough, to use a painter's term, "the
general effect" of his character, and no unfair idea of the eventful
times in which he lived, and was a distinguished actor.

<p>However, with all the blemishes in Holt's character, he was calculated
to have made an extraordinary figure in the history of his&mdash;I
may say of our times, if he had been of a different grade of society,
and a man of education. Had Holt been in the British army, and in a
situation to improve his mind, and acquire information and polish, he
would most likely have risen to eminence.

<p>Of Holt's personal appearance, the portrait prefixed to this volume
will convey a correct idea. His height was about five feet ten inches;
he was extremely well made, of compact muscle, and remarkably athletic
and vigorous. Holt's hair was black, and his eye-brows heavy and bushy;
his eyes were dark and penetrating, but rather small. His nose was of
that class usually termed Roman, his forehead was finely developed, and
his face well proportioned and intellectual. He wore his beard under
his chin, shaving only the prominent parts, and this fashion appears to
have been a distinguishing mark of the fraternity of United Irishmen.
Holt had the power of readily assuming a commanding or determined look,
but there was nothing ferocious in it or in his appearance; and his
smile was one beaming with benevolence.
His whole appearance was likely to gain submission, as
determined resolution was stamped on his countenance. In his manners he
was simple and unaffected.

<p>The manuscript of these volumes was procured by Sir William Betham,
from Joseph Harrison Holt, the son of the writer, not long after his
father's death, when young Holt sold his little property at Kingstown,
and proceeded with his family to New South Wales, to join his elder
brother, and to endeavour to recover the hundred acres of land there,
which he said had
been granted to him as a child. Holt's eldest
son, Joshua, having remained in New South Wales, is I am told a
prosperous and respectable man. The manuscript, although undoubtedly a
genuine document, is, for the most part, a transcript either of Holt's
original rough copy, or, as seems more probable, from the colloquial
style, a transcript after his dictation, founded upon the notes which
he states that he had made when on the Falkland Islands in 1813. It was
written in 1818, and revised by Holt in the
course of the following year, when he appears to have added a few
observations. Holt's secretaries, for it is evident that he employed
more than one amanuensis, were quite as illiterate, if not more
illiterate than himself, and their orthography in many passages,
required some study on the part of the editor to decypher. For
instance, the word niece, in the manuscript, is usually spelled "nees,"
buffalo, "<i>buefalow</i>,"
boatswain, " <i>bousin</i>," Gazette," <i>Gisat</i>," verandah, "<i>farranda</i>"
windward, "<i>winword</i>," &amp;c., and, according to the same authority, the crew
of the <i>Sydney</i>, a ship from India, consisted of "<i>Mahomudins, say pies,
and Glascars</i>." But these mispellings, which in type are trifles to
the eye of a reader, become far more formidable in manuscript not very
legibly written. As words of ordinary occurrence were thus disguised by
Holt and his secretaries, it is no .matter of surprise that scarcely
the name of any place or person is correctly given, and it has formed
no small part of the editor's labour, to identify places and persons,
by reference to various authorities. Thus, "<i>Mager Provoux</i>" or "<i>Purvoux</i>"
is intended for Major Foveaux, "<i>Oie</i>," for Owhyhee, "<i>Oteitt</i>," for
Otaheite, "<i>Miderera,</i>" for Madeira, "<i>Habbit,</i>" for Abbott, " for
Jerusalem, "<i>Bly</i>,"
for Bligh, "<i>Putlon</i>' and "<i>Puttleton,</i>" for Putland, "<i>Alliegander</i>,"
for Alexander, "<i>Blacksell</i>," for Blaxcell, "<i>Graace</i>," for Grose,
"<i>Drewry</i>," for Durie, "<i>Annevil</i>," it is conjectured, means Grenville;
and so on for a list which may be extended to many pages.

<p>These examples are offered as an apology for any errors which may be
discovered, as for instance, the editor is by no means certain that
the Dr. Kelly mentioned in vol. ii., page 80, is not intended for Mr.
Caley, &amp;c. And it should be observed that Eagle Island of the Falkland
Islands, is now generally known as "Speedwell Island."

<p>Yet, notwithstanding the numerous emendations made in respect to
local and personal names, the editor has adhered in the text closely to
the original manuscript, feeling that much of
the interest and value of the narrative would be destroyed by any
attempt to refine Holt's expressions, or embellish his style.

<p>Two specimens of Holt's mode of spelling may be found in the letter
addressed by him to Lieutenant D'Aranda, and in Holt's copy of Mr.
Sumpter's letter, which are printed in the second volume. The slight
liberties also that it was necessary for the editor to take with his
text, will be exemplified by reference to the fac-simile of a passage
in Holt's autograph, and the corresponding pages of the second volume.
And it is certainly remarkable, that although the writers were very
illiterate, the style throughout is so clear, except occasionally, in
local descriptions, as scarcely to admit of being in any respect
misunderstood.

<p>The division adopted in the present volumes is that into which Holt's
account of his fortunes naturally separates itself, namely, his career
as a rebel in Ireland, and his adventures as an agriculturist in New
South Wales. The first volume brings down Holt's history to "the
close," I use
his own words, "of that most unhappy year, 1798." And the second
details the vicissitudes of his life, through good and evil report,
nearly to the period of his death.<br>

<p class="date-jnl">[1 January 1799]</p>

<p>A few paragraphs before the end of Volume 1 of <i>The Memoirs of
Joseph Holt</i>, appears the following newspaper report:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Holt, double-bolted, handcuffed, and
encompassed with what is called an iron circumference, was lately
put on board a transport to be conveyed to Botany Bay. He swore,
blasphemed, and inveighed most bitterly against 'breach of
treaty.'"&mdash;<i>Courier Newspaper</i>, 16th January, 1799.</p>

<p>Volume 2 of The Memoirs begins with preparations for the
departure of Holt for New South Wales, on the "<i>Minerva</i>."<br>
<br></p>

<hr>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1799, a coach came to the door of the
Tower, and a man named Wilkinson, came to me, and said that I was
to go to the Pigeon House in this coach, to embark; but first, he
was directed to put a small iron, or fetter, upon me, and he asked,
"Which leg it should be on?" The suddenness of this mandate
disconcerted me not a little, and I felt indignant at being treated
like a felon. My wife and children were in no state to proceed on a
voyage, and we were thunderstruck at this sudden order. My poor
woman fainted; it was a cruel scene. I endeavoured to console her;
she recovered, and I found it necessary to exert my energies. I
took leave of her, and went to the door of the Tower.</p>

<p>My feelings had been much softened by my intercourse with the
higher orders of society, and I began to fancy myself in a country
where the asperity of excitement had passed away, and that men saw
all things as they really existed, without exaggeration or
extenuation; but no sooner did I again come in contact with the
lower instruments of the Government, than I felt the indignation of
the rebel arise in my breast with renewed vigour. The rough and
savage manner in which orders were carried into effect, and the
unnecessary severity and disregard of the feelings of the
unfortunate victims of power, made my heart swell with indignation.
Influenced by these feelings, I entered the coach, in which were
two troopers, who accompanied me as guards. We soon entered into
conversation, for the men were both very communicative, and I
listened to their talk as the safest mode of proceeding. They spoke
of the Insurrection, and declared themselves inclined to favour it,
which I was not disposed to doubt, having had so many desertions
from the army of both English and Irish soldiers, but not a single
Scotchman or Welshman ever joined me. These men said the leaders of
the Insurrection in Ireland were too precipitate, and commenced
their operations before they had things ready; they should have
waited for assistance from England and Scotland, where people were
really ready to support them, by making a disturbance in those
countries, thus taking away the attention of the Government from
Ireland. They added, that had they been aware of what they would
have had to do in Ireland, damn them, but they would have deserted
sooner than have come over. When I discovered their disposition, I
said that I should be much gratified if they would let the coachman
stop at the next tavern, where we might all have a parting glass
for the sake of old Ireland. To this proposal they readily
assented, and when in the tavern I told them, that all things
considered, I felt happy at getting out of a country where so much
tyranny had been exercised towards poor, harmless, and defenceless
people; and that now, the last prayer I should probably ever put up
on my own native sod, was, that God would incline the hearts of all
her children to peace and good-will towards their neighbours; and,
that though I may not live to see the day, yet, that under the
blessing of God, the day should come, when Ireland would be happy
and prosperous. "Take my advice, soldiers," said I, "in whatever
station of life you may be placed, do your duty, obey all the
lawful commands of your superiors, and do not meddle with what you
do not understand: you will then be respected, and everything will
prosper about you. It is from meddling fellows, who will not leave
well alone, that all this misery has arisen, and on their heads are
the innocent blood of thousands. Rebel as I am considered, I here
drain my glass to the last words I shall probably ever speak in
Ireland, God Save the King." Not one word more was spoken, but they
continued to look at me with astonishment, and they left me at the
Pigeon House, where I entered a boat which brought me to a vessel,
commanded by one Christopher Dobson. This fellow, as I came
alongside, shouted to the prisoners' who were confined on board,
"You are now well enough, your General is come on board." There
were eighty men below deck, who gave me a welcome by a loud cheer.
The captain said, "Take him to Mess, No. 1, where there are none
but United Irishmen," and I was conducted down accordingly.</p>

<p>This Dobson was a man of repulsive countenance, and low, coarse
manners&mdash;the savage was marked on his countenance. He was of
low stature, not much above five feet five, broad shoulders, bandy
legs, but very athletic form; he had much hard weather in his
countenance, looked as bluff and rough as Bray-head, and and was
just the reverse of a man delicately brought up: his eyes had a
strange sort of twist, very frequently called a squint, erroneously
in Dobson, for sometimes he would carry his eyes as straight as any
man, which so altered the expression of his face, that, but for the
peculiarities of his person and make, it totally changed his
apparent identity. In. general he squinted horribly, his eyes
appeared at right angles with his intentions. His voice was so deep
and hollow, that he had seldom any occasion to use the speaking
trumpet. He wore what is called at sea a pea-jacket, a coarse blue
coat, which came down to his heels, and a hat covered with tarred
canvass. Such was the savage who received me on deck, as he would a
live hog, and ordered me to my stye with the rest of my kind,
without even a civil look, which perhaps he was unable to bestow on
any one. I said nothing to him, but began to reflect, that nine or
ten months at the mercy of this monster, would be a purgatory equal
to any which could be fancied for the most atrocious sinners, and I
inwardly hoped for strength to bear it. I wished also that my poor
wife and children might fall into better hands.</p>

<p>Dobson had agreed with Government to take us to Cork for a
stipulated sum, and to supply us with a pound of meat, and a pound
of bread, each day. In order to make this scanty allowance go
farther, he appointed a person to distribute it with light weights,
so as to give but seven, instead of ten pounds. It was no use to
remonstrate; any one who complained was instantly chained to the
deck of the vessel.</p>

<p>I found my messmates to consist of the following
persons:&mdash;</p>

<p>John Lacy, of Dublin, metal-founder.<br>
Joseph Davis, of ditto, cutler.<br>
Farrell Cuffe, of the King's County, schoolmaster.<br>
John Kincaid, of Armagh.<br>
William Henry, of ditto.<br>
Charles Dean, of Dublin, apothecary's apprentice.<br>
Richard Day.<br>
Samuel Car, brother to a clergy man of Armagh.<br>
Thomas Brady, chief clerk of the Gold Mines in the county of
Wicklow.</p>

<p>The delicate frames and constitutions of Henry and Dean were not
equal to the hardships inflicted by our tyrant, they expired before
we reached the Cove of Cork. Mr. Brady said to me:</p>

<p>"This is a most wretched lodging for you."</p>

<p>"It is," I replied, "but I have seen much hardship; my God has
ever been propitious to me, and I doubt not I shall have his wonted
support. A man who has proper feelings is able to suffer as well as
to enjoy."</p>

<p>Mr. Brady shared his pillow, which was a lock of hay, with me; a
plank was our path by day, our bed at night; and, as the vessel
rolled, the bilge water would flash under us. The hatchways were
left open to prevent our being suffocated; in the centre of the
vessel a large tub was placed for the accommodation of eighty
persons, not one of whom was allowed to go on deck at night, and
who were mostly fresh-water sailors. This disgusting and horrible
tub was emptied but once in twenty-four hours, and as the motion of
the vessel kept it in a continued state of evaporation, the
atmosphere we were compelled to breathe cannot easily be even
imagined. It is not be wondered at then, that those whose frames
and constitutions were delicate, sunk under the misery of our
situation.</p>

<p>Frosty winds, with rain and sleet, now brought to my
recollection the sufferings of Lord Cornwallis, on which a
well-known song was composed, the recollection of which animated my
depressed spirits, and I began to sing it, which surprised my
fellow-sufferers, but it served to elevate them also.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[2 January 1799]</p>

<p>On the 2nd of January, 1799, Dobson received orders to sail. He
weighed anchor, and on looking to the shore, I saw my faithful and
excellent, but disconsolate wife. We could do no more than make
motions of settled fidelity and affection; it was a silent
interchange, but it was truly honest. I felt more at this moment
than I am able to express. I had but five shillings in my
possession.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[3 January 1799]</p>

<p>On the 3rd, I saw the Wicklow mountains; my heart leaped at the
view, there was my once happy and prosperous home.</p>

<p class="poem">But ah! oppression drove me from my door,<br>
My cattle took and burned up all my store.</p>

<p>There I had been the happy, the blessed, the contented, the
prosperous, the respected, the beloved. There I had also been the
persecuted, the oppressed, the victim of the worst of passions;
and, in my turn, the vindicator of my wrongs, the avenger, the
terror, aye, and even the conqueror of my enemies. There I had
taught them the consequences of oppression, but I had now the
consolation, under all my sorrows, of knowing, that in those
mountains I had not wantonly shed blood, or cruelly inflicted
torture on my fellow-creatures when in my power, but had, to the
extent of my authority, endeavoured, and successfully, to mitigate
the horrors of civil war.</p>

<p>Had I known the misery of this vessel, I think no lord or lady
would have had influence enough to induce me to surrender. I
thought so at this moment, so much does present evil press on the
mind. I said, "I hope I shall one day return to my country, and
expose the cruel treatment which has been so undeservedly inflicted
on me."</p>

<p>Many are killed in battle, and we lament their fate, but it may
be questioned whether it be not better, than dragging on life under
a heavy load of oppression. I was, I thought, then like a cuckoo,
shooting off to the South, leaving bad days to the men I left
behind me.</p>

<p>We continued our voyage in very cold and inclement weather, and
suffered very much from thirst, our allowance being but one pint of
water in twenty-four hours. I often saw struggles between the
unfortunate wretches on board, for the possession of small pieces
of ice, which adhered to the sails and other parts of the ship, to
quench the burning of their parched mouths, so much were they
distressed by thirst, and one man I actually saw expire, crying
out, with his very last breath, "water, water!" We arrived at
Passage, near Waterford, where Dobson cast anchor.</p>

<p>Our delay here gave me an opportunity of writing to my wife, and
also to my guardian angel, Mrs. Latouche. My letter, as nearly as I
can now recollect, ran as follows,&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Dear and Excellent Lady,<br>
<br>
As you were the instrument in the hands of the Almighty, of my
surrender to Lord Powerscourt, and my giving up my mountainous life
of liberty, to the government, I hope your charity will be extended
farther, by restoring to my bosom, the dear, faithful, and
affectionate partner of my life. I had much better have perished in
the mountains, than live deprived of her society; most ardently do
I pray your ladyship to consider my unhappy lot. My wife and
children are now the only tie which makes life desirable, or even
tolerable. My property is all gone, I am in a miserable vessel,
full almost to suffocation of unhappy beings, without resources
even for personal cleanliness, and if left in that state, I cannot
long exist. Several poor wretches in this floating dungeon of
disgusting filth, have already fallen victims to the hardships they
suffered, and have perished of cold, hunger, and above all, of
thirst. We have been out but a few days. The cruel and unfeeling
monster, in the shape of a man who commands this vessel, seems to
feel that he has a cargo of swine, rather than of human beings, on
board. I am sure the excellent and benevolent Lord Lieutenant, and
the government, have no idea of the wretchedness and misery we are
suffering. It would have been much better, and more humane, to have
ordered us to have been shot on the Strand, than to doom us to
linger out such a wretched existence of miseries. Death would be a
relief to most of us.<br>
<br>
I have had such proofs of your ladyship's goodness, that I am
certain this statement will not be made in vain, when I humbly
solicit some small assistance to enable me to pay the passage of my
wife and family, to the far distant land of my exile. And, however
you may be pleased to assist me, I most fervently pray, the
Almighty may shower his blessings on you and yours with every
suitable reward.<br>
<br>
I remain, your grateful debtor;<br>
J. Holt.</p>

<p>By return of post, I received an answer from this best of
ladies,&mdash;such an answer as I might have expected from such a
woman; she was the concentration, the accumulation, the very
essence of benevolence. I read her letter over as well as I could,
but my eyes were full of tears&mdash;excess of my feelings of
gratitude blinded me, I could not see through the shower. I asked
for a pittance towards alleviating my misery&mdash;she supplied me
with the means of comfort, and even affluence, she did more, she
gave me back my wife to my bosom, and my children to my knees. She
also told me, that the expense of their passage should be paid, and
she had directed a banker at Cork to furnish me with whatever money
was required, to supply every necessary for us during the voyage.
She also said she had a particular affection for my daughter, and
would take care of her and educate her, if I would intrust her to
her care.</p>

<p>Mrs. Latouche sent for my wife, and communicated to her the
contents of my letter, and asked her if she could make up her mind
to live in Ireland, for if so, she would allow her and her children
a competent support. My wife burst into tears, saying, "My dear
madam, I am quite overcome with your goodness, but this world has
no charm for me without Joseph; our faith is plighted for life, and
I hope nothing but death will separate us." Her ladyship then
turned to my son, and told him she would bind him to a trade, and
take care of him, but if he wished to go with his father he might.
The boy, moved with affection, said, "he would go with his father."
Mrs. Latouche said, "I see, Mrs. Holt, your affection for each
other is so strong and mutual, that you ought not, and must not be
separated."</p>

<p>Peter Latouche, Esq., the happy husband of this angelic woman,
was present during this conversation, and asked my wife how she
could get to Cork? She answered:</p>

<p>"I have no other way of going but on my brother-in-law's horse
and cart."</p>

<p>"My poor woman," said he, "you would most likely be robbed and
murdered on the way! Take this," giving her five guineas, "that
will pay for coach-hire."</p>

<p>The particulars which I mention occurred so many years ago, that
it may be supposed the extreme warmth of my gratitude has in some
measure subsided. Both those excellent persons are now in the
enjoyment of the rewards due to benevolent Christians, whose acts
demonstrated their faith. But I am at this moment unable to find
words to express my admiration of their exalted goodness; any words
of praise from an unlettered man like myself, must fall short, far
short, of their merits; but if it was in my power to do so, I would
hand down the names of Mrs. and Mr. Peter Latouche in the annals of
history, for admiration and imitation, as illustrious patterns of
excellence, to the remotest posterity.</p>

<p>I now return to Ballyhack, where we were at anchor. The noise of
our arrival had spread far and wide. The title of "General" Holt
being universally acknowledged, induced many of the most
respectable inhabitants of the neighbourhood to come on board to
see "the General." My dress was that of a superior officer of the
army. One day, about two, o'clock, as I was taking my scanty and
coarse repast, I perceived several persons on deck endeavouring to
get a peep at me, on which I requested my company to stand so as to
intercept their view, when the following conversation took place
between Dobson and myself.</p>

<p><i>Dobson</i>.&mdash;"Holt, come up on deck."</p>

<p>I took no notice of this address; which he repeated in a
commanding tone, adding, "Come, you Sir, when you are called."</p>

<p><i>Holt</i>.&mdash;"To gratify you, I shall not come on deck;
you would keep even the air from me if you could, and I will not
come on deck at your command, to be made a show of."</p>

<p><i>Dobson</i>.&mdash;"There is a gentleman here who wants to
speak with you."</p>

<p><i>Holt</i>.&mdash;"You have as much power to let him down as to
keep me down, I shall stay where I am. If any one wants to speak
with me, they can do so."</p>

<p>Finding me determined, Dobson came down with four persons,
saying, "Would not you come up to please me?"</p>

<p><i>Holt</i>.&mdash;"No, but were you about to be hanged I would
offer my services as your executioner."</p>

<p>One of the party was an officer of the 89th regiment; I had met
that corps in Imail, and this young fellow evidently wished for a
bit of a show off at my expense, but I thought it likely I should
have more amusement with him, as I had taken some of the regiment
prisoners near Lugnaquilla. He addressed me in a flippant and
confident tone.</p>

<p><i>Officer</i>.&mdash;"Do you remember the 89th regiment?"</p>

<p><i>Holt</i>.&mdash;"O yes, Sir, it is not likely I shall ever
forget them."</p>

<p>Turning to those with him, he said, "Did not I tell you so?"
Again addressing me. "We gave you a very hard chase over
Imail?"</p>

<p>Holt.&mdash;"O yes, you did indeed, your men were very
swift-footed; active as my fellows were, you were very near getting
away from us, we only took three prisoners. I was quite blown in
chasing you; it put me in mind of swallow shooting. I was forced to
be very smart in taking aim, or your chaps made me throw away my
cartridge. I do not know how many were wounded, but you left me the
trouble of burying your dead. His Majesty gives good money for very
bad services. I never saw men behave worse than that same 89th did
on this occasion. My men did not get a scratch from you: having
fired your first volley, it was your last, and off you were like a
winged grouse. You did not fire at us a second time. The less you
say about Imail, the better." This sally struck the young officer
dumb. He retired without saying another word, and my
fellow-sufferers, in spite of their miserable condition, set up a
roar of laughter, which he will never forget, and which no doubt
was as unwelcome as a volley of musketry would have been to him,
for he was a fine young man, and probably a brave one; but I would
not allow his braggadocia over me.</p>

<p>We had on board a gentleman transport, named John St. Leger; he
had been captain of a troop, and afterwards a United Irishman; he
frequently drank with Dobson, and one night they got drunk and
quarrelled. Next morning, St. Leger was called by Dobson upon deck
to be ironed. He said, "I shall couple the captain and general
together." I answered, "You shall do no such thing. I have not
misconducted myself, and will take care not to do so; and,
therefore, put me in irons at your peril; I am not to be coupled
like a criminal goat."</p>

<p>He called to the sentry to bring me up, but the man very
properly said, "I will take care of him below, and while he
conducts himself well, I will protect him from being ill used. You
have no right to use unnecessary severity, merely out of spite, and
damn me if you shall." Dobson said he would complain to the
sergeant, the reply was, "There will be complaints, and a good
share of them will be against you." Poor St. Leger thus escaped
being put into confinement. He had plenty of money, and entertained
this brutal tyrant, who partook of his good cheer, and then vented
his beastly rage upon him.</p>

<p>During our stay in the river, several boats came along-side with
provisions for sale, but Dobson would not allow any one to buy,
although he knew we were nearly in a state of starvation. As many
of the poor wretches on board had been eight months on the water
without a change of clothes, they were in a state of inexpressible
torment, covered with vermin.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[23 January 1799]</p>

<p>On the 23rd of January, we arrived at the Cove of Cork, to our
great delight, as we hoped to be relieved in some degree from our
misery.</p>

<p>Sergeant Wiggan went on shore, and by him I wrote to General
Myers, stating the horrible plight we were in, and praying that he
would send some one to inspect our deplorable situation. In a short
time there came on board four officers, who instantly ordered every
man upon deck, and their wretched appearance fully justified the
statement I had made in my letter; indeed a more disgusting
exhibition of filthy and squalid misery could not be imagined; and
it is quite impossible to describe it except in language which
would make the heart sick.</p>

<p>One of the officers now produced my letter, and called on Dobson
to exhibit the weights he made use of for weighing out the
allowance to the prisoners, on which he produced honest weights.
The officer then called for the person employed in weighing the
provisions, who was a man named Tom Byrne, a plasterer, better
known in Dublin by the name of <i>Boxing Byrne</i> who was examined
by Dobson.</p>

<p><i>Dobson</i>. "Did not you weigh out the prisoners'
provisions?"</p>

<p><i>Byrne</i>. "I did, but not with them weights; I was directed
by Captain Dobson to use other weights, which are here,
gentlemen."</p>

<p>He then showed the false weights, which being examined and
compared with the true weights, were found to be exactly as my
letter had specified.</p>

<p>Dobson endeavoured to make excuses, but several of the prisoners
were examined, who brought home to him the most abominable acts of
cruelty and oppression. He said it was a conspiracy of all the
prisoners against him. My letter was now produced, and I
immediately came forward and avowed the writing, and declared
myself ready to verify it on oath, adding as I turned to Dobson,
"Can you deny any statement in that letter?" sergeant Wiggan had
before this stated the horrid treatment we had received at this
wretch's hands; the appearance of the prisoners and the ship, and
the exhibition of the false weights, were quite conclusive. One of
the officers said to him, "You are certainly a greater criminal
than any under your charge, and your crimes deserve summary
judgment; you ought to be hanged forthwith at the yard-arm. Every
charge in this letter has been brought home to you and proved.
Leave the ship, sir, immediately." The villain went over the side
amidst the hooting and execrations of all on board.</p>

<p>The officer then asked me a few questions, and said he should be
glad to have a little conversation with me at another opportunity.
He would take care that Dobson should be punished if possible, but
at all events he never should be employed again under his Majesty's
government. Thus we got redress, and would be ungrateful if we did
not:</p>

<p class="poem">Adore our king and praise the laws,<br>
And abjure those that are the cause<br>
Of perpetrating tyranny,<br>
Which by the above you plainly see.</p>

<p>We were all made loyal men by this act of justice, and began to
find out that the laws were good, and that we should have rebelled
against the understrappers of power, who substituted their own
villanous dispositions and tyrannous wills for good laws. As my
experience made me acquainted with the higher functionaries of
government, the more just and equitable was my treatment, and I
must say that I never made a complaint of ill usage to the higher
powers, which was not treated with respect, fairly considered,
properly investigated and immediately remedied. It therefore now
appears clearly to my mind, that the government and laws we wished
to subvert, would have been succeeded, had the United Irishmen been
victorious, by nothing half so good. The individuals who would have
been placed in power not feeling so just notions of right as those
already in authority. It was the corrupt and bad dispositions of
the lower officers of the government, and perhaps the innate
depravity incident to man, we ought to have rebelled against, and
not the British laws and general government, which are certainly
grounded in perfect equity, however they may be abused.</p>

<p>The <i>Minerva</i> transport, which was hired for our conveyance
to New South Wales, lay alongside the Polyphemus man-of-war. A
report was circulated that all the clothes of the prisoners on
board the dirty Lively would be thrown overboard, which induced the
poor fellows to sell them for little or nothing, in fact for
anything they could get&mdash;even for a pint of whisky. Dr. Archer
came on board, and I applied to him to know if every one would be
compelled to give up their clothes. He replied that it would be at
their own option, as any who possessed good clean clothe? would be
allowed to keep them. I immediately went below and passed the word
among the prisoners, which instantly put an end to this transfer of
property. A <i>santippe</i>* of a sergeant had his eye on my whole
apparel to clothe his children, but he was disappointed.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Xantippe? See the observation made in Note,
Vol. 1 p.10.]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[18 February 1799]</p>

<p>I saw a lighter coming from the <i>Minerva</i>, and instantly
went below, shaved and cleaned myself. The convicts' clothes were
on board the lighter, and the sergeant asked me if I preferred a
green jacket to a blue one, for there were jackets of both colours.
I answered, certainly, for no one would believe me if I said
otherwise. So he chose me two jackets, two pair of trousers, two
shirts, two pair of stockings, and two pair of shoes, a small flock
bed, a blanket, and a rug, which formed my share of his Majesty's
bountiful donation to General Holt, and to every other prisoner.
Then came a barber to shave my head; but I gave the fellow a slap
on the cheek, and desired the damned rascal to begone; on which a
complaint was made of me for disobedience; but I asked "was it
intended to shave my head off, for I had before clipped my hair as
close as scissors could make it." The <i>Santippe</i> sergeant
said, "Sir, will you throw me up them clothes?"</p>

<p>"Come down for them," said I.</p>

<p>"I cannot quit my post," he replied.</p>

<p>"Very well," said I, "you may stay where you are, then, for
these clothes may as well be my own as yours, and I shall keep
them. I have nothing more to say to you; you are like an overgrown
sweep, out of-your time; your time for being useful is gone by, and
when you were capable, you were not willing." I went on board the
lighter with my small suit, and proceeded to the <i>Minerva</i>,
right glad to be out of the detestable Lively.</p>

<p>The chief mate of the <i>Minerva</i> was a Mr. Harrison. The
second a Mr. Howe, a very gentlemanly man. Mr. Hegarty was the
third mate: of him I can say little in commendation; he was as bad
as he looked, and no deception. William Douglas was first quarter
master; &mdash;&mdash; James, second; John Thompson, third. Salkeld
was the name of the captain of the <i>Minerva</i>; he had married a
Cork lady named Graham, the daughter of a glass-blower. William
Bolten, a county of Wicklow man, was ship's carpenter. Martin
Short, from Naas, in Kildare, his mate. The <i>Minerva</i> was well
found and fitted for her voyage, and in every respect was
calculated for the service she was destined to perform. Every thing
appeared clean, orderly, and proper on board; decency, decorum, and
discipline appeared in every department, and in short, the
impression made on my mind, as I paced up and down the deck, was
most favourable to our future prospects.</p>

<p>The magnificent harbour called the Cove of Cork, is perhaps the
finest in the world; landlocked on all sides, the navies of Europe
might ride in safety daring the heaviest storms from any point of
the compass; there is but one entrance, nearly due south. The land
on all sides is high and bold; on the north is the town of Cove; to
the west is the passage up to Cork, by Haulbowling and Spike
Island; there is from three and half to seven fathoms of water at
the lowest tides. To the east is Rostellan Castle, a noble seat, as
it was described to me, and the town of Cloyne. The harbour abounds
in fish, and altogether it is a magnificent port.</p>

<p>A William Cox, Esq., paymaster of a military corps in New South
Wales, was on board the <i>Minerva</i>; he was going out in the
ship as a passenger, and came up and spoke to me; he inquired
respecting my affairs, and seemed much interested about me. I
showed him Mrs. Latouche's letter, and related to him her
ladyship's bountiful and benevolent generosity. He expressed his
satisfaction that my wife and family were going with me. He then
asked me down to his cabin, and introduced me to Mrs. Cox, an
amiable and excellent woman. They had their four sons on board,
namely, Charles, George, Henry, and Edward. This worthy family were
ever after generously kind, and even affectionately attentive to me
and mine.</p>

<p>Visitors came to the ship every day, asking me questions
relative to the late insurrection; my answers were seldom agreeable
to them. Captains Cox, Salkeld, and Mr. Harrison, would usually
join when these curious inquirers made their appearance. Generally
they were much annoyed at my small opinion of the yeomen; they
could not bear to hear the truth. Men not under military law, can
never be good soldiers in time of danger. The rebels fight well,
knowing their own safety depends on their exertions. One day in
particular, a very large party came from Cork, one of whom spoke so
very impertinently to me, that I told him he must exchange a shot
with me, for although I was under misfortune, I was not to be
insulted with impunity, which brought the gentleman to his senses,
and he made an apology. This amused my friends, the officers of the
ship, and I was ever after treated with kindness and respect.</p>

<p>One morning, walking the quarter-deck with Mr. Harrison, I
observed a boat approaching the <i>Minerva</i>, with a female in
it. I thought it was my wife; she was at least half a mile from us,
but I knew her figure. Mr. Harrison took his glass, and from my
description, soon confirmed my supposition. He ordered the chair to
be got ready by the quarter-master. The boat drew near, and to my
delight, the excellent partner of my joys and sorrows, with my boy,
were soon in my arms on the deck, and were received with every
attention by all on board. We were now again united, never to be
separated, till the common disturber of connubial happiness should
part us.</p>

<p>Captain Salkeld made an agreement with me for one hundred and
twenty guineas for their passage, and I gave an order on the banker
in Cork, which was duly honoured. Mrs. Holt then went on shore for
some necessaries which we required for the voyage, and the captain
gave orders for the carpenters to fit up a little cabin for me,
Mrs. Holt, and my son, off the steerage, and here we were most
comfortable.</p>

<p>We had on board the Rev. Henry Fulton, with his wife and family;
Mrs. Fulton was the daughter of the Rev. Mr. Walker, and came from
a place called Silver Mines, near Waterford. The Rev. Father
Harold, late parish priest of Reculla, in the county of Dublin. Dr.
O'Connor and his brother-in-law, William Henry Alcock, a captain of
infantry in the army.</p>

<p>These gentlemen were all exactly circumstanced as I was, and
were going on their travels for the same reason.</p>

<p>When well-educated men were disaffected, like the
foregoing&mdash;a captain upon full pay, a clergyman, who gets the
tithes of a parish for giving an exhortation once a week, which is
but a little conversation; a priest, who for saying mass,
christening, and performing like duties to his parishioners, which,
as I said, before, is but a little conversation;&mdash;when such
men,&mdash;men who get well paid for talking, become rebels, great
allowances should be made for poor, ignorant, oppressed and
ill-treated creatures, who are ground down to the very earth by
high rents, and other burdensome impositions. I asked those
gentlemen why they were rebels? Did you sustain great losses by
oppression? No. Were your houses burned? No. Were you taken in
battle? No. Did you rob anyone? No. We were taken too soon! "Well,"
said I, "you deserve to be transported, if it was only for your
stupidity; you had nothing to complain of. You have not, like
myself, earned what you have got; you should have done something to
entitle you to have your passage paid by the Crown."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Fulton and her son joined Mr. Fulton, and Mrs. Holt
and my sop had joined me, both he and myself were in possession of
every comfort a good man could desire; we had our faithful, honest,
amiable wives with us, adhering to us according to their vows, for
better for worse, in, sickness and in health, in adversity and
prosperity, in evil report and good report.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alcock, who was sister of Dr. O'Connor, came to pay her
husband and brother a friendly visit; I thought, of course, she was
coming to accompany him, to whom she was bound by the strongest of
ties, and with the additional inducement of having the company of
her brother also. She came, indeed, to the <i>Minerva</i>,
accompanied by a sharp attorney, and her object was, to prevail on
her silly husband to assign over to her, by a deed, his property,
to the amount of &pound;300 a year, and as soon as it was
perfected, she took her leave, with a coolness of manner and accent
which I shall never forget. Her "good bye," as she stepped into the
boat, was in a tone which so fully expressed the woman's character,
that I could not help feeling indignant and disgusted. I tried to
persuade Alcock not to sign the deed, but in vain. I told him he
would lose both his wife and his property; and so it turned out, he
never saw her more. The influence of wine, and the wiles of an
artful woman, backed by a scheming attorney, often have fatal
effects. He had, indeed, her picture, with some of her hair,
enshrined in gold, which he wore round his neck; it was all he
possessed. I knew him for fourteen years after his arrival in New
South Wales, and he never received a letter from his ungrateful
wife during that period. A virtuous wife is a jewel of inestimable
value, and the greatest earthly support to a man in misfortune; but
a worthless woman is a dreadful curse.</p>

<p>I will now describe the odd medley of persons who were assembled
on board the <i>Minerva</i>, in consequence of their disaffection
towards the Government.</p>

<p>Captain Alcock had full pay, and a private fortune of &pound;300
a year. I am puzzled to imagine what could have created
disaffection in his mind.</p>

<p>Captain John St. Leger, on full pay also, from a good king; what
could induce him to desert his honourable commission?</p>

<p>Parson Fulton, who had a parish, was a man who seemed to be in
rebellion <i>against himself</i>, his conduct is totally
inexplicable.</p>

<p>Father Harold had a parish also; but he wished to make his faith
ascendant; that perhaps was a good reason for his disaffection; but
would he have been better off had the rebellion been successful? I
think not.</p>

<p>Doctor, or Apothecary, O'Connor, he obtained a comfortable
living, by selling herbs, drugs, burgundy pitch-plasters, emetics,
and by bleeding, feeling the pulsations of a lady's heart, and
renovating decayed beauty with his lotions and cosmetics; he had no
business to scald his fingers in the burning pitch of politics.</p>

<p>I do not wish to extenuate or exclude the charges against
myself. I was deputy alnager under Sir John Blaquiere, which
produced me from &pound;80 to &pound;100 a year, I had, by
agencies, &pound;60, more. I was also chief barony constable,
tory-hunter, catcher of thieves, coiners, pick-pockets, and
murderers, which produced me &pound;50 more. Had I been mean enough
to take bribes, I might have made it &pound;150. I was likewise
overseer and projector of roads, leveller of hills and filler up of
hollows, making crooked ways straight, and rugged places smooth,
which I may justly say produced me &pound;50 more. So I was well
off. But with all these advantages, I was made a rebel; I was
deprived of them all by oppression, as I have before stated.</p>

<p>So of all this chance medley, but one, and that one was myself,
had any good reason, beyond their own fancy, to become disaffected;
on the contrary, they had every reason to wish to keep things as
they were, and of the whole, but myself alone had ever been guilty
of a direct act of rebellion, or had fired or received a shot with
a hostile intention.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[4 April 1799]</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fulton were put into the cabin with me and my wife.
My son was twelve years old on the 4th April, 1799, and quite an
active lad of his age. Captain Salkeld asked me to let him join the
boatswain's mess, which would be more healthy for him than walking
between decks. I did not object, on condition that the boy should
be a certain number of hours at school every day, as Farrell Cuffe,
a schoolmaster from the King's County, was on board. So Joshua was
entered on the ship's books, and put into the boatswain's watch;
some days he attended school, and others not, which was an
annoyance to me, but I was unwilling to complain, and allowed it to
pass.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[June 1799]</p>

<p>Some time in June, Captain Cox met General Meyers, and Major
Ross, and other officers, on shore, and the conversation turning on
me, both the General and Major expressed a wish for an interview.
On his return on board, Captain Cox requested me to accompany him
to see General Meyers. I accordingly dressed myself, and shortly
after Captain Cox, Lieutenant Maundrell, Sergeant Hobbs and myself,
with two sailors to row us, left the <i>Minerva</i>. As I passed
through the barrack-yard, there were assembled not less than four
hundred people to see the lion of the day. If I had been an
orangoutang, or kangaroo in boots, they could not have been more
anxious to view me, or have exhibited more surprise. I was dressed
and decorated as well as I could, full powdered, pomatomed, and
puffed, according to the white fashion of that day.</p>

<p>The General and Major Ross received me politely. The bell was
rung, and the butler and servants immediately appeared with
refreshments, of which we partook. The General then entered into
conversation with me about my military adventures, which I need not
here recapitulate. They were related more briefly, but nearly as I
have herein-before told them. The General then said, "Had you gone
through the same dangers and sufferings for your king, as you have,
for what you considered the cause of your country, you would now be
a happy man, Mr. Holt."</p>

<p>"General," said I, "I doubt it not, but happiness rests in the
mind. I could hot be happy if I had violated what I held to be a
sacred obligation. I certainly should have been happy to have
served my king as well as my country&mdash;their interests are the
same."</p>

<p><b>Major Ross</b>.&mdash;"You are quite right."</p>

<p><i>General Meyers</i>.&mdash;"You must know a great many people
in your own county."</p>

<p><i>Holt</i>.&mdash;"Most certainly; there are few I do not
know."</p>

<p><i>Major Ross</i>.&mdash;"I am informed that your wife and son
are going out with you. What would you think of staying at home?
You need not go unless you wish it. I will send and bring your wife
and son on shore."</p>

<p><i>Holt</i>.&mdash;"I fear, sir, everything is too far gone to
draw back now."</p>

<p><i>Major Ross</i>.&mdash;"Not at all, sir, provided you do what
you are required."</p>

<p><i>Holt</i>.&mdash;"Perhaps what is required would be more than
I could do."</p>

<p><i>General Meyers</i>.&mdash;"I think not. If you had a good
corps of cavalry under your command, you might do more service than
you ever did injury."</p>

<p><i>Holt</i>.&mdash;"Then they must be better and braver soldiers
than any I have fought against, most of whom were thin-skinned
fellows, who did not stand fire."</p>

<p><i>General Meyers</i>.&mdash;"Well, but as you know so many
people, you could render great service by prosecuting them."</p>

<p><i>Holt</i>.&mdash;"No, sir, that I can never do. I would rather
kill twenty men by my sword or pistol, than one by testimony on the
book; that is a character I always detested. Besides, General, I
have sworn to be faithful to these people; how can I break my oath?
I would, were I free and unsworn, and had never, been connected
with the rebels, be ready to serve my king, for whom I felt a warm
attachment, though I detested some of those who served him; but,
after swearing the United Irishman's oath, I have not been able by
any casuistry or consideration, to find out how I could be released
from the obligation. If I treated an oath lightly, and held it to
be a slight tie, which I could take one day, and act in the teeth
of the next day, I should be unworthy to be trusted by his
Majesty's Government; nor should I be, what I hope I shall ever be,
an honest man. General, I should detest myself were I to do it, and
you ought to detest me also. I am a poor man, and one of humble
birth, a mere yeoman; but I am a Protestant Christian, a man who,
when he takes an oath, keeps it; who believes sincerely in God, and
dare not violate an engagement taken in his name. I am thankful for
your kindness and politeness to me, but I cannot, I dare not,
accept any offer on these terms. Sir, may I presume to ask you one
question?"</p>

<p><i>General Meyers</i>.&mdash;"Certainly, Mr. Holt."</p>

<p><i>Holt</i>.&mdash;"I ask you then, sir, on your honour as a
gentleman and a soldier, are you not making me this offer on the
part of, and by the desire of Government?"</p>

<p><i>General Meyers</i>.&mdash;"I have no hesitation in saying,
Yes."</p>

<p><i>Holt</i>.&mdash;"I thought so, but I must decline accepting
the terms. No earthly good would compensate me for a violation of
my oath. I should be delighted to serve my king, in any way which
is honest, but I can never sell my self-respect. I should consider
myself a perjured villain were I to act as you have suggested. I
have already said as much to his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant.
Many times have I ventured my life in support of the laws, and
badly was I requited by those in power. I acknowledge that the
injury inflicted upon me was the private act of an individual, but
he was the instrument of the Government, and I could then see no
way of redress, or any hand in it, but that of legal oppression.*
Sir, I cannot accept the offer you have made me; the passage money
is paid for my wife and son, and, as for myself, I have earned my
free passage better than any united man in the ship. I mean no
disrespect. General; but I am sure you will have a better opinion
of me for refusing than for accepting this offer. If I did the
latter, I should deserve both the pillory and the gallows. So, in
the name of God, I will go and try my fortune in a new country;
for, in his name, I dare not do what is required of me, and I will
do-nothing to violate the sacred obligation I am under. I should
observe, however. General, that before I left my poor fellows,
those who adhered to me to the last, the men, who though they were
rebels, were not robbers, I addressed them and advised them, one
and all, to return to their homes and their allegiance; and if they
are allowed to do so, I have no doubt they will. As to those
fellows who have taken up robbery as their profession, nothing but
the bullet or the halter will cure them. My way of carrying on
hostilities did not suit them; they were for making fortunes by
plunder, and they will have their reward."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Upon a loose half-sheet of paper which was
placed here in Holt's original MS., the following reflections
occur; they are signed "Joseph Holt," and dated "Dunleary, 19th
February, 1819."&mdash;"I now, indeed, am satisfied that the act
out of which all my misfortunes have arisen, was unauthorized by
the higher powers, but the effect upon me and upon others was the
same as if such conduct had been sanctioned. Bad laws, well
administered, are better for a country than good laws converted to
private or party purposes. It is what we immediately feel that
comes home to us, and individual tyranny is thus attributed to
national causes.&mdash;<br>
<br>
"They burned my house,<br>
They blighted all my hope&mdash;<br>
In the king's name,<br>
And drove me to the Pope.<br>
They made me take a rebel's chance;<br>
To save my life&mdash;<br>
My children and my wife,<br>
I would have even fought for France."]</p>

<p><i>Major Ross</i>.&mdash;"Mr. Holt, I cannot but respect your
sentiments, they are those of, an honest man, and a good man
also."</p>

<p>Captain Cox then related certain facts which he had been told
respecting me, on which General Meyers made use of some
commendatory observations upon my conduct, and said, "Captain Cox,
give my compliments to Governor King, and beg of him to do
something for Mr. Holt, who is an extraordinary character." The
remembrance of this message was not forgotten by that worthy man;
Captain Cox; and four years afterwards was of great service to me.
We then left the General, and returned to the ship.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holt was more inclined to go than to remain, if we had the
power of choosing; for she said, it was dreadful to be in a country
where the greatest rogue's oath could destroy a man's house, or
even take away his life. We continued in the harbour some
considerable time after this. My wife was in the family way, and
now her time of confinement was fast approaching. Captain Salkeld
called me to him one morning, and said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Holt had no appearance of being with child when I agreed
for her passage, so you had better go to Cove and get her a lodging
in time." I replied. "No, Sir, that I cannot do. I agreed with you
for a certain sum for the passage of my wife and son, and if you
stay here much longer she may have another, so the sooner you weigh
anchor and be off, the better."</p>

<p>He said, "Neither you nor your wife told me that she was with
child when I agreed for her passage."</p>

<p>I told him that I did not see that there was any necessity for
doing so, adding, "You must be aware that married women are apt to
have children. Get ready the state-room, it will be employment for
Dr. Price. I can tell you this, if you are more than a year on your
voyage, Mrs. Holt may have another child."</p>

<p>There were thirty-four women, soldiers' wives and prisoners, on
board, besides Mrs. Cox and my wife. There were seven children born
while we remained in the Cove of Cork.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[17 July 1799]</p>

<p>The state-room was got ready, according to my desire, and on the
17th of July, at six o'clock in the morning, Mrs. Holt was
delivered of a son.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[19 July 1799]</p>

<p>On the 19th, he was baptized by the name of Joseph Harrison
Holt, by Parson Fulton; Mr. Harrison, William Henry Alcock, and
Mrs. Hobbs, who attended Mrs. Holt, being sponsors.</p>

<p>There were on board, besides the thirty-six women I have
mentioned, one hundred and thirty-two male prisoners, a lieutenant,
four sergeants, and twenty-seven private soldiers, three mates,
four quarter-masters, and twenty sailors.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Bound for New South Wales</h2>

<p class="date-jnl">[24 August 1799]</p>

<p>On the 24th of August, 1799, we weighed anchor, and sailed from
the Cove of Cork, with a fair wind.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[4 September 1799]</p>

<p>On the 4th of September, we were in sight of Madeira, and fired
a gun for a pilot, but none came off to us. We bore away from that
island, steering our course for Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[19 September 1799]</p>

<p>On the 19th, we had fair wind and weather, and saw Tristan da
Cunha, a small island, inhabited only by sea-birds.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[22 October 1799]</p>

<p>In eight weeks and three days we arrived at Rio de Janeiro,
without any occurrence worthy of particular mention.</p>

<p>We remained there three weeks, and got fresh provisions every
day, and abundance of fruits, as oranges, bananas, plantains, water
melons, musk melons, and cocoa nuts. Tobacco was, at Rio de
Janeiro, at three half-pence the pound, good rum at one and
sixpence the gallon, and wine at one and fourpence. A present was
sent from the shore for O'Connor, Alcock, and myself, of some
sugar, coffee, and chocolate, and many other good things; the
generous donor we never found out.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[November 1799]</p>

<p>I feel it but justice to mention the great humanity and
liberality of our government, when their admirable dispositions and
laws are not counteracted by their officers, and instruments. We
were supplied with the greatest abundance of provisions, and plain
but excellent clothing. The stores on board consisted of beef,
pork, fish, butter, cheese, peas, oatmeal, suet, plums, bread,
vinegar, mustard; tea and sugar for the females, tin kettles, and
all proper utensils, with wine and medicines for the sick and
infirm. So that many of the transports, I am satisfied, wished that
their passage should last for ever. No blame can be laid on the
home department, or the government, which I am convinced is
influenced by and conducted on the purest principles, and with the
best intentions. I should now feel it a great misfortune to the
country were it to be overthrown; it certainly would be likely to
be followed by a government not half as good.</p>

<p>But the admirable arrangements for the comfort of those under
sentence of transportation are frequently frustrated by the
contrivances of the captain and the steward, for their own
emolument; and his Majesty's bounty rendered useless to the people
for whom the supplies are intended. These persons (the captain and
steward) often curtail the allowance granted, for the purpose of
disposing of their savings at the ports they stop at. The first
thing which usually becomes scanty is butter. It sells at Rio de
Janeiro, the Cape of Good Hope, and New South Wales, at 5<i>s.</i>
a pound; pork at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; mustard and vinegar
10<i>s.</i> a gallon; in short, all European commodities which bear
a high price, soon get short. The allowance of which the prisoners
are curtailed, either by false weights and measures, or by as false
statements, are bartered by the captain, who exchanges the pork,
butter, flour, vinegar, &amp;c. for tobacco, which he gets at the
price of 12<i>s.</i> per hundred weight, and sells at New South
Wales at 10<i>s.</i> a pound, spirits at 1<i>s.</i> a gallon, which
he sells at 20<i>s.</i>; and thus is the liberal allowance,
bountifully granted by the king, dishonestly made away with in
traffic by his officers. An unfortunate transport has no knowledge
of these abuses, or means of detecting them, but a passenger who is
constantly upon the deck cannot but observe them; for the
barterings and delivering of the barrels of salt pork, &amp;c. are
made without concealment; so difficult is it to prevent abuses and
violations of the best regulations and intentions.</p>

<p>Captain Cox brought out with him, watches, beaver hats,
calicoes, shawls, glass of various kinds, cutlery, &amp;c. which he
sold at Rio de Janeiro at an incredible profit; but this
gentleman's traffic was fair and honourable. I remember, one day,
his servant was so loaded with dollars, the produce of Captain
Cox's dealings on shore, that it was with difficulty we brought him
into the ship.</p>

<p>There were two transports on board from Dublin,&mdash;John
Austin, and Marong, a Frenchman convicted of forging notes on the
bank of Ireland. Marong was a jeweller, and Austin an engraver.
Captain Cox employed these men to ornament the articles of
jewellery he brought out, particularly his watches, which were
generally of the class called "London runners," the works of which
are not of the best, but they look well, and that is what the
Brazilians consider more than their acting well; and he got a ready
demand for these articled, although they were anything but
time-keepers.</p>

<p>Captain Cox was particularly kind to me, and all those I wished
to favour. He would frequently say to Captain Salkeld, this is a
fine day, let up the prisoners to wash and shave, and get a little
fresh air. Captain Salkeld would answer:</p>

<p>"My quarter-masters are all busy, I cannot spare them."</p>

<p>"Give me the keys," Cox would say, "and I will find a quarter
master of my own; it will be good and humane to let the poor
creatures have a little fresh air and relaxation; I will be
responsible for their good behaviour."</p>

<p>He generally, indeed, I believe always prevailed, for Captain
Salkeld had great confidence in him. Captain Cox would then say to
me:</p>

<p>"Come, Holt, you must be quarter-master to-day; you have many
well wishers among the prisoners, do them a kind turn."</p>

<p>I was happy in having an opportunity of serving the poor
fellows, and as the crime of being an United Irishman was not,
according to my mind, in moral turpitude to be compared with
thieving and robbery, I always, on getting the keys, released my
brethren first, and gave them a longer liberty on deck. The others
I always limited to the allowed period. This caused great jealousy
among the prisoners, but I could not help it. I thought it quite
fair to make a distinction in their guilt. I also had Captain Cox
to support me. He always remained on deck during the whole period,
and we took special care to have every man shaved according to his
liking, and made perfectly clean and comfortable. Thus did this
excellent man contribute to the health and happiness of the
unfortunate prisoners, which also induced them to grateful and
respectful behaviour. On our arrival the ship was the healthiest
and best regulated which had ever reached the colony with
transports; this was chiefly caused by Captain Cox's exertions.
"Joseph having found favour in his sight," was also an humble
instrument in aiding his benevolent exertions; our captain's reply
of the quarter masters' hurry not being sufficient to divert the
benevolent Captain Cox from his humane purpose.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[16 November 1799]</p>

<p>On the 16th. November, we saw a sail to windward, which chased
us for two days: she showed Spanish colours, and we thought her a
frigate; but the <i>Minerva</i> was a good sailer and beat her by
chalks; we ran at least nine knots an hour, and effected our
escape. Had she captured us, she would have had a precious prize of
live lumber.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[18 November 1799]</p>

<p>Two days after we discovered two sail to leeward. The captain
said one was a Spanish galleon, the other a prison ship. He gave
orders to clear the ship for action; we had eight guns and two
swivels on the poop.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison came to me, and asked me, <i>if I would fight?</i>
I answered, "<i>Yes</i>" but I answered with mental reservation,
"then," said he, "take charge of the centre gun, you will, I am
sure, be quick, active and steady." I requested to be allowed to
choose from among the prisoners the requisite number of men to work
the gun, and he gave orders that I should have any I chose, on
which I called for John Kincaid, Richard Byrne, Joseph Davis,
Thomas Brady, Martin Short, and Pat Whelan, six good and resolute
men, on whom I could depend. I then got my cartridges, hand-spikes,
spunges, ramrods, tub-flame, and powder-monkey. I was soon charged
and ready, and I passed the word to Kincaid and Byrne to mind my
motions, and not to fire till I gave the signal. Captain Cox was on
the poop with his twenty-four marines, or soldiers. Lieutenant
Maundrill got a cramp in his stomach, which prevented his coming on
deck, so, had not Captain Cox been with us, the command of the
soldiers would have fallen on the sergeant; every medical
assistance was afforded the lieutenant without effect, but after we
got out of danger the medicine affected him, and he recovered very
speedily. All our guns were charged with grape; we bore down and
came within gun-shot, when to our surprise the vessel our captain
took for a prison ship opened her ports and exhibited the fine set
of teeth of a large Spanish frigate, from which she gave us a
broadside, but it was ill directed, and did us no harm. We did not,
however, wish to give her an opportunity of trying their effect
again by remaining within reach of her guns, so we put about and
crowded all sail, and it was well for us the <i>Minerva</i> knew
how to creep, which she did in good style, and soon distanced the
enemy, for in twelve hours we ran her hull down.</p>

<p>When danger is over the spirits revive, and happiness replaces
fear. Mr. Harrison brought me to his cabin, and the grog went about
in bumpers. After a time I said, "Mr. Harrison, till this day I
considered you a sagacious man."</p>

<p>"What have I done, sir," said he, "to alter your opinion of
me?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you," I answered, "you know, that although I am no
convict, I am under restraint, and if I was taken by any power, I
would demand the rights and privileges of a citizen of that power.
It was my interest, and the intention of the men you gave me from
among the prisoners, that we should be captured. All who are
enemies to England are our friends; we are in the state of bondmen
to England; with the Spaniards we should be free. Had England given
us freedom, we should have been grateful, and delighted to fight
for her; but she placed us in bondage, aye, and in chains&mdash;how
could you think we would fight to keep ourselves in irons? No, sir,
I tell you, had we come to action, I would have turned the gun
against the poop, and tried all I could to obtain liberty for
myself and the other prisoners. All nations of the world are our
friends, save England only."</p>

<p>He looked at me with astonishment, and at length said; "Are you
serious, Holt?</p>

<p>"On the word of an honest man, I am," said I, "you asked me the
simple question, '<i>Will you fight?</i>' I answered in the
affirmative; had you added, 'against the enemy?' I should have
said, <i>No</i>, for I scorn deception. Had you looked seriously at
me, you must have observed the features of my countenance full of
resolute determination, and every man I chose would have obeyed my
orders; they knew my mind by a secret signal. So, you see, the
bravest and the most prudent are weak at certain times, and
frequently so in times of impending danger. I would not have asked
for power to use it deceitfully, but you gave it me
unconditionally."</p>

<p>He hesitated for a time, and then held out his hand to me, and
said, "Holt, you are right; I acted imprudently. I ought, before I
gave you power, to have had your explicit declaration of how you
would use it. My esteem for you is not lessened by this candid
statement of your opinions and intentions. I feel that where I have
your pledge it will never be violated."</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison and I were always the best friends, and whenever he
wanted to obtain correct information, he always applied to me. We
had two disturbers of the harmony of the ship; I mean two stags or
informers, one named Robert Wilson, the other John Hewit, from the
north of Ireland. The former outwitted Dr. Price, and got himself
on the sick list for three months, and so far did he get to
windward, that he was allowed a bottle of wine every day, which he
sold at night for a shilling. To continue himself in favour, he was
continually writing to the captain frivolous letters. At last he
wrote to give information, that there was a conspiracy among the
prisoners to scuttle and sink the ship, which so much alarmed the
captain, that he showed the letter to Mr. Harrison and the other
officers. Mr. Harrison came to me, and showed me the letter; having
read it, I said to him, "Can you believe the men on board are so
devoid of sense, as to enter into a conspiracy to sacrifice their
lives? Just look seriously at the business, and you can have no
doubt on the subject. The writer of this letter is an enemy to the
peace and happiness of all on board, and wishes to annoy and
torture the unfortunate creatures under your care, and who are,
also, let me add, under your protection. If you will follow my
advice, it will put an end to all this in a short time."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I shall be glad to do so."</p>

<p>"Then, call Dr. Price."</p>

<p>The doctor soon appeared, and I examined him as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;"Doctor, have you not a patient named Wilson,
who has been very long on the sick list, to whom you give or allow
a bottle of wine daily?"</p>

<p><i>Dr. Price.</i>&mdash;"No, Sir, I have not, nor do I allow any
such thing to Wilson."</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;"No! Why, I must beg pardon; he says you do,
and he brings me the bottle every evening, and sells it to me for a
shilling. The <i>Minerva</i> is the cheapest tavern I have ever
known."</p>

<p>The case was too clear for contradiction, and Mr. Harrison
requested the doctor to follow my advice, and to try what effect it
would have. The wine was stopped, to the no small surprise of
Wilson. No one knew of the matter, but Mr. Harrison, the doctor,
and myself. When we met on the quarter-deck in the morning, I used
to ask Mr. Harrison if there was any news from below; he would
laugh, and say, "No, I think your skill better than the
doctor's&mdash;you have cured two complaints by one application."
During the voyage there was an end of talebearing, and comfort and
content prevailed on board. Thus one evil-minded man brought one
hundred and eighty under suspicion.</p>

<p>A few days after, we observed a small sloop coming from one of
the Brazil islands, fired a gun and brought her to. We lowered a
boat, and Captain Cox and some sailors went on board and procured
fruit, spices, and other small matters from her. Sergeant Cotton
gave me some cayenne pepper, which I had never before seen; he
desired me to taste it, which I did, and immediately thought I had
been poisoned. This caused no small amusement on the quarterdeck.
When my mouth got cool, and the effects were somewhat alleviated, I
was anxious that the sport should not be at my expense, and I
therefore offered Captain Alcock and Mr. Fulton a taste of my
strong-flavoured spice, which they both took into their mouths,
suspecting nothing particular, but immediately they ran about the
ship in an agitated manner, as if they had been mad, on which I
passed the word below, and presently we had all hands on deck,
enjoying the joke, except the spice tasters. Mr. Fulton said to me,
"Holt, you have poisoned me," on which I offered to call up the
priest to have him anointed, as he was about to die, thus adding
more annoyance to the afflicted, and laughter to those who had
escaped the visitation.</p>

<p>My good friend, Captain Cox, requested me to select from among
the prisoners some of the most respectable and best inclined men,
who were transported for their political opinions, and were not
robbers. "Choose me, Holt," said he, "from among the prisoners, a
few men in disposition like yourself."</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[December 1799]</p>

<p>We now made the south-west Cape of New Holland, and shortly
after saw Storm-bay passage. We then sailed along the coast,
keeping in sight of land, sometimes so close, that we could see the
people by help of a glass. We sailed above 3000 miles on the coast,
and passed by the head of old St. Patrick, and through Bass's
Straits. Captain Salkeld hoped to be at Port Jackson by the 25th of
December, but, in consequence of frequent calms, we did not reach
it until the 10th of January, 1800.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[10 January 1800]</p>

<p>We passed on, and at sun-set we bore out from land, two hours on
and two off. Just at day-light, we entered Sydney Heads, and fired
a gun for a pilot, but none appeared; we sailed by Pinchgut
Island.* The first remarkable object I saw was the skeleton of a
man, Morgan by name, on a gibbet; he was executed for murder.</p>

<p class="footnote">* "This is very small in circumference, situate
between Garden Island and Sydney, about a mile and a half from the
latter. The soil is almost a rock, in the clefts of which oysters
and other shell-fish occasionally abound. It is sometimes made use
of for drying powder, &amp;c.; but it derived its name from the
circumstance of sending here, by way of punishment, some of the
most incorrigible of the convicts, where being kept upon exceeding
short allowance, according as their crimes deserved, they conferred
upon it the name it bears. The post that appears upon its summit,
is the remainder of a gibbet, upon which a cooper, belonging to the
colony, was executed for a most atrocious murder; this wretch
having undertaken, for the small reward of one half-pint of rum, to
knock out the brains of one of the settlers, which he actually
carried into effect."&mdash;<i>Barrington's Voyage to New South
Wales</i>.<br>
<br>
Barrington says, that "On the 16th of October, [1796,] a boat sent
to the north shore for wood, brought in a man's hat, which was
found with a hammer lying near it. Some blood was found in the hat,
and, on searching, the body of a man was discovered near the water
side." At the Criminal Court, held between the 23rd and 29th of
November following, eight men were sentenced to death; one of these
was Francis Morgan, for the murder of the man whose body was found
on the 16th October. "The body of Morgan was ordered to be hung in
chains on the island Mat-te-wan-ye. This spectacle, shocking to the
refined mind, served as an object of ridicule to the convicts, and
terror to the natives; who, though hitherto particularly partial to
that spot, now totally abandoned it, lest the malefactor should
descend and seize them, in the same way as their superstition
prompted them to imagine spirits did."</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[11 January 1800]</p>

<p>We passed by Garden Island, and came to anchor in Sydney Cove,
at about 11 o'clock, a.m. on the 11th of January, 1800.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Arrival at Port Jackson, Sydney</h2>

<p class="date-jnl">[12 January 1800]</p>

<p>In the course of half an-hour, fifty boats were alongside; all
the robbers, pick-pockets, and thieves had plenty of acquaintance,
but I did not see a soul to whom I was known. It was Sunday morning
by our journals, but it was Saturday at Port Jackson. Next morning
there were twice as many boats alongside as on the previous day,
every one bringing presents to their acquaintance. We were not
permitted to land, nor were any persons allowed to come on board,
and the sentinels received orders to keep the boats from the ship's
sides. Captain Cox and his family alone went on shore.</p>

<p>On the larboard side was a soldier of the name of Lawless, from
the county of Cavan; he ordered a boat to keep off, which boat did
not instantly row away so fast as he wished, and he levelled his
musket and fired. The ball passed through the arm, and then the
body of a young man, who instantly expired. When I got on shore, I
heard that this man bore a good character, and this tyrannical act
put me in mind of the doings of the ancient Britons, who, after
they had taken everything from the cottage of a respectable and
respected man, would shoot the inhabitants at their doors.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[13 January 1800]</p>

<p>Lawless, the murderer, was brought on shore on Monday the 13th,
tried for wilful murder, and acquitted;* but to save him from the
vengeance of the people, he was sent to Norfolk Island, where
divine vengeance followed him, for I saw him with a deformed frame,
and covered with vermin. I have witnessed many instances of cruelty
and oppression in my life, but punishment, either in body or mind,
generally followed close on the steps of the perpetrator.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "On the 18th (January), a convict attempted
to go alongside the <i>Minerva</i>, and still persisting, though
repeatedly warned to keep off, was shot by the sentinel, agreeable
to his orders; who, though tried, was of course
acquitted."&mdash;Barrington's History of New South Wales.]</p>

<p>The ship was now visited by Captain Johnstone, Nicholas Divine,
and a naval officer, with several spectators. The prisoners were
brought upon deck, their irons taken off, and placed in three rows
on the deck. Captain Johnstone held the indent in his hand, on
which is inserted the name of every prisoner, their place of trial,
length of sentence, and the cause of conviction. Each man's trade
or profession was now enquired into, by which the authorities were
able to select such as they-wanted for government employ, and then
the gentlemen officers had their choice. The remainder were taken
by the residents, according to their station or influence. But this
ship's company had such a name for criminality, that a part was
sent at once to Norfolk Island, a place of transportation for those
who are too bad for Botany Bay.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In the History of New South Wales, bearing
the name of Barrington, it is observed, that "The generality of the
convicts sent by this ship, [the <i>Friendship</i> transport from
Ireland,] and the <i>Minerva</i>, [in which Holt arrived,] were but
ill calculated to be of any advantage to the settlement, as little
addition could be made by them to the strength of the labouring
gangs. Many of them were bred up in genteel habits, and others to
light professions, and, of course, unaccustomed to hard labour.
These must become a drain on the store; for, notwithstanding the
detestation of the crimes many of them were transported for, yet,
it was not possible for the Governor, consistent with his
well-known feeling of humanity, to send a physician, the once
sheriff of a county, a catholic priest, or a protestant clergyman
and family to the brick-carts, brick-fields, grubbing-hoe, or the
timber-carriage. The lower classes of convicts in these cargoes
were mostly old men, fit only for hut-keepers, to remain at home
and prevent robbery, while the other inhabitants of the hut were at
labour, thus, making good the old proverb, 'set a thief to catch a
thief.'"<br>
<br>
Barrington states that the <i>Minerva</i> had one hundred and
sixty-two male, and twenty-six female convicts on board, from
Ireland, "all in perfect health, their treatment doing the highest
credit to the master, the surgeon, and officers&mdash;only three
had died during the passage."]</p>

<p>Captain Johnstone came now to me, and very civilly addressed me,
for I kept myself from the convicts. Mr. Harrison stepped forward,
and introduced me, and spoke of me in such high terms, that Captain
Johnstone told me he would place me in a situation where I could
realize five hundred pounds a year, by superintending a large farm,
and a great quantity of stock, and I have no doubt he spoke the
truth. I returned him my thanks, and said I would give him an
answer in a few days.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[14 January 1800]</p>

<p>Captain Cox having had an interview with the Governor, came on
board on Wednesday the 14th. He addressed me in the usual form,
asking after Mrs. Holt and the children. I returned the compliment,
by enquiring after Mrs. Cox and his children. Some further ordinary
conversation took place, and then he said to me, "I find it very
difficult to get any of the prisoners from this ship landed
here."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," I replied, "I suppose they will land us somewhere.
I suppose they will not keep us always afloat."</p>

<p>"Oh," said he, "I have got leave for you and your family, and
Mr. Fulton to land."</p>

<p>I answered, "I am extremely grateful to you. Captain Cox, for
this kindness, but I am sorry you gave yourself so much trouble. I
have no fancy for one place more than another, not knowing anything
of any part of the country. It is quite immaterial to me where I
go."</p>

<p>He then, in a kind, and even affectionate tone of voice, said,
"The Governor has promised me six men, and you may be one of them,
if you please: I mean not to labour, but to superintend; you will
choose five honest United Irishmen, you and they will agree better
than robbers."</p>

<p>I waited the conclusion of this speech with coolness, and then
gave him as stern and terrific a look as I was capable of, for I
felt a deep indignation at his proposal, as well as regret and
disappointment. I had always considered Captain Cox as my friend,
and a kind friend; one who was ever ready to stand by me, and
defend my rights. I now found him an innovator on my liberty, one
who wished to make a felon of me. In the first impression of my
anger, I answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that the nature of the communication you have to make to me
from the Governor?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "pray, present my humble respects to his
Excellency, and let him know that I am not a convicted transport. I
came here on terms, to expatriate myself, but not to be subject to
the rules and slavery of those whose criminality has deprived them
of the rights of British subjects. I will never be his man, nor
yours."</p>

<p>I then leaped down from the quarter-deck and, wringing my hands
together for some time, and grinding my teeth, to endeavour to
control the violence of my emotion. I at length exclaimed, "Is it
come to this, Mr. Cox?"</p>

<p>He made no reply, but went down to his cabin, and I to mine,
where I told my wife of the conversation which had passed.</p>

<p>Mr. Fulton was much pleased to hear that he was permitted to
land, for he was tired of being in the ship. After breakfast I went
and told Mr. Harrison what had passed. He smiled at the reception I
had given to Captain Cox's proposal. He said, "You are right, do
not be put down, or submit to any degradation, they will think the
better of you. You are banished from your country, but there is no
other penalty attaches to you. You are not to leave the colony
without permission, but no one has a right to impose on you the
labour and restrictions which felons suffer. If any one attempts
it, call for the indent against your name, and they will find only
that you are to live in one of his Majesty's islands or colonies.
Captain Johnstone will give you an excellent situation." This
strengthened my resolution, and I determined rather to suffer death
than submit.</p>

<p>I was walking up and down on the quarterdeck with Mr. Harrison,
who asked me what I wished to do with my son Joshua, and whether I
would bind him apprentice to him, for if so, he offered to take
charge of him, to teach him navigation, and to use Mr. Harrison's
own words, "make a man of him." I returned him many thanks for his
kindness and his generous offer, but I said there were so many
casualties, contingencies, vexations and disappointments attending
a sailor's life, that I did not desire my son should adopt it. "My
wish," said I, "is to have the boy under my own eye." I then called
Joshua, and, before Captain Salkeld, desired him to clean himself
and get ready to go on shore.</p>

<p>The captain, I thought in a menacing manner, said, "Do not be in
too great a hurry to go on shore."</p>

<p>I answered, "Captain Salkeld, I wish to go ashore, and expect
you will throw no difficulties in my way, for I trust I shall be
allowed to do so whether you like it or not." Before he made me an
answer a boat came alongside with orders for Joseph Holt and family
to go on shore, which greatly delighted me, as my foot had not
touched the earth for twelve months and fourteen days. I hailed a
boat, and inquired what they would charge to bring myself and my
wife, and son, ashore. They answered two dollars. It was but about
fifteen minutes' row. I offered one, (it was three times too much)
which was accepted. I got my bed, trunks, and baggage into the
boat, and then my wife and two boys, and we soon were on shore.</p>

<p>I had received the day before an invitation from Mr. Maurice
Margarot to go to his house when I should land. This gentleman had
been convicted of sedition at Edinburgh, in 1794,* and transported
to New South Wales for fourteen years. He had seen me from his
garden come on shore, and he sent his servant to meet me. There
were about a hundred people at the landing place, who appeared so
very attentive and respectful, one offering to carry the child,
another the trunk, that I suspected all was not right, and that
their apparent kindness was not altogether without a hidden object.
I had not forgotten that I had arrived in the country of thieves,
therefore I desired them not to touch my luggage. Mr. Margarot's
man asked me if I would go to his masters house. I told him yes,
and requested him to get me some parties to carry the trunks. He
fixed on some of the good-natured and officious individuals who had
so pestered me with their offers of service. The trunks were soon
at Mr. Margarot's, and my generous and disinterested friends
demanded a dollar for about five minutes occupation. This arose
from the idea that I was a <i>general</i> and very full of dollars;
in this they were mistaken, for I was nearly as destitute of money
and of friends as most of my shipmates.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* 9th January, (1794), Edinburgh.&mdash;"This
morning, about ten o'clock, a vast crowd assembled in front of the
Black Bull Inn, where Maurice Margarot, indicted for seditious
practices, lodged. He shortly after came out, attended by three
friends. When lie got the length of the Register Office, the mob
forced all the four into a chaise which they had provided, and from
which they had previously taken the horses. This done, they
immediately drew the carriage to the Parliament Close, where Mr.
Margarot and his friends alighted, and walking into the Parliament
House, he assisted himself at the bar. On his way home Mr. Margarot
was again forced into a carriage by the mob, along with five of his
friends, and the horses being taken from the coach, the mob drew
him to his lodgings at the Black Bull Inn.<br>
<br>
"13th.&mdash;Mr. Margarot was accused of different seditious
practices. He conducted his own defence. After a long trial, the
jury found him guilty, and the court sentenced him to fourteen
years transportation beyond the seas.<br>
<br>
"In consequence of the proceedings on the 9th instant, while Mr.
Margarot went to the Justiciary Court, every precaution was taken
this day by the Lord Provost, Magistrates, and the Sheriff, to
prevent any breach of good order. A great crowd assembled at his
lodgings in Leith-street, about ten o'clock, and he was conducted
with a wreathe or arch held over him, with inscriptions of
'Reason,' 'Liberty,' &amp;c. About the middle of the North Bridge,
however, the cavalcade was met by the Lord Provost, Sheriff,
Constable, peace officers, &amp;c., and immediately dispersed, the
arch demolished, and its supporters taken into custody. A
press-gang attended to assist the peace-officers. Mr. Margarot then
walked to the court, escorted by the Lord Provost and Sheriff, and
no disturbance ensued.<br>
<br>
"February 10th.&mdash;This morning Messrs. Muir, Margarot,
Skirving, and Palmer, were removed from Newgate in a post-coach and
four, attended by two king's messengers. We learn that they were
taken on board vessels bound to Botany Bay."&mdash;<i>Annual
Register</i> for 1794.<br>
<br>
On the 25th October, 1794, "The Surprise transport arrived at
Sydney from England, whence she sailed on the 2nd of last May,
having on board sixty female, and twenty-three male convicts, some
stores and provisions, and three settlers for this colony. Among
the prisoners were Messrs. Muir, Palmer, Skirving, and Margarot,
four gentlemen lately convicted in Scotland of the crime of
sedition, considered as a public offence, and transported for the
same to this country.<br>
<br>
"The Lieutenant-Governor having set apart for each of the gentleman
who came from Scotland in the Surprise, a brick hut, in a row on
each side of the Cove, they took possession of their new
habitations, and soon declared that they found sufficient reason
for thinking their situation 'on the bleak and desolate shores of
New Holland,' not quite so terrible, as in England they had been
taught to expect."&mdash;<i>Collins</i>.<br>
<br>
Muir escaped from the colony in an American vessel, the
<i>Otter</i>, in February, 1796, and Skirving died on the 9th March
following. "A dysentery," says Collins, "was the apparent cause of
his death, but his heart was broken. In the hope of receiving
remittances from England, which might enable him to proceed with
spirit and success in farming, of which he appeared to have a
thorough knowledge, he had purchased from different persons who had
ground to sell, about one hundred acres of land, adjacent to the
town of Sydney. He soon found that a farm near the sea-coast was of
no great value. His attention and his efforts to cultivate the
ground were of no avail. Remittances he received none; he
contracted some little debts, and found himself neglected by that
party for whom he had sacrificed the dearest connections in life, a
wife and family, and finally yielded to the pressure of this
accumulated weight. Among us he was a pious, honest, worthy
character. In this settlement his political principles never
manifested themselves, but all his solicitude seemed to be to
evince himself the friend of human nature.&mdash;<i>Requiescat in
pace</i>."]</p>

<p>Mr. Margarot received me with kindness and hospitality, shaking
me by the hand; he was a man of great conversational powers, and of
literary acquirements, being well educated. Mrs. Margarot was of
the same rank and character, a lady of elegant manners. They were
both of hasty tempers, and very irritable. He asked me many
questions, some of them very unaccountable to me, who was not very
well up to republican notions. He told me his history briefly, and
why he was sent away from his own country.</p>

<p>About one o'clock, an Englishman named Barnes, came in with a
basket of beautiful peaches and nectarines, and an animal somewhat
like a rabbit, called a bandy-coot, on which we afterwards dined,
and found it of good flavour. Barnes was parish clerk, and came
from England with the Rev. Richard Johnson,* the first clergyman
who reached this colony. Mr. Margarot said he regretted his means
did not permit him to furnish his house with better fare for my
entertainment, but what he had, he was happy to share with me. I
then asked permission to send out for some spirits. I gave the
servant a guinea, (which left me but four to commence the world
with) and he brought us a wine bottle of rum, for which he paid
fourteen shillings, and I received three small pieces of silver as
change, cut in a triangular shape, the value of which I did not
know. We drank our rum punch, and chatted over our adventures.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Mr. Johnson went out in 1787, as chaplain to
the colonial settlement at New South Wales, in the squadron under
the command of Captain and Governor Phillip, to whom the foundation
of that penal settlement was entrusted. Mr. Johnson was appointed a
magistrate of the new colony by the governor. In July, 1793, his
exertions accomplished the construction of a church: "the front was
seventy-three feet by fifteen, and at right angles with the centre
projected another building, forty feet by fifteen. The edifice was
constructed of strong posts, wattles, and plaster, and was
thatched." It was capable of containing five hundred persons. In
the first discourse delivered by Him in this building, (on Sunday
the 24th August), he "lamented that the urgency of public works had
prevented any undertaking of the kind before, and had thus thrown
it upon him." In 1800, Mr. Johnson, as hereafter appears by Holt's
narrative,(pp. 97, 98),* sold his farm of 600 acres to Mr. Cox,
with the intention of returning to England.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* pp. 97, 98) The Rev. Richard Johnson was the
first clergyman who had ever landed in this colony, and, by his
prudence and economy, he made a' large fortune, with which he was
now about to return to England. He first raised and cultivated the
orange-tree in the colony. He sowed those seeds which he had
brought with him from Rio, and in a few years the trees produced
very fine fruit, which he sold at from sixpence to ninepence each.
Mr. Cox purchased from this gentleman his estate, which joined the
Brush Farm. It consisted of 600 acres of land, about 150 sheep, a
mare and three fillies, and some horned cattle. This purchase
increased my ride to about twelve miles; there was in it about two
acres of vineyard, which, some years, bore abundantly; and another
acre, covered with large orange-trees, early nectarines, peaches,
and some apricots. The place was called Canterbury; it was about
five miles from Sydney. I pruned the vines and fruit-trees, and now
I found my early instruction in gardening of great use to me. Mr.
Cox wished to have a handsome place here, and we began to build a
large dwelling-house.]</p>

<p>Among other things, I told Mr. Margarot, the treatment that my
son Joshua had received from Captain Salkeld. I had paid him sixty
guineas for the boy's passage, and he had entered him on the ship's
books as a sailor, and thus he had been living with the seamen, and
was entitled to wages, and I ought to receive the money back which
I had paid for his passage. I said I would go to the judge
advocate* and lodge my complaint. Mr. Margarot smiled at my
simplicity, and observed, "You are very young in this colony; do
not fancy that courts of justice exist here as they are constituted
at home; if you send a present to the judge, and it be greater and
more valuable than that sent by your adversary, you will succeed by
it, not otherwise; never rely here upon what Englishmen call the
justice of their case. Bad as the mother-country is, the courts
there are purity itself in comparison."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Mr. Richard Dore, whose conduct Holt
represents as highly disgraceful. (See p. 78.) He left England for
New South Wales, on 6th November, 1796, in the <i>Barwell</i>.]<br>
<br>
[. P. 78. Mr. Atkins was not a judge, but acted as a kind of
deputy when Judge Dore was not able, which frequently happened,
for, when spirits were plenty in the colony, he was generally
indisposed.]</p>

<p>I could scarcely believe him, but soon was satisfied that he
spoke the truth. I got an order and served it on Captain Salkeld,
claiming a return of the sixty guineas I had paid for the boy's
passage, and his pay as a seaman, he not having received the
comforts of a passenger, but having worked hard the whole voyage,
and being therefore entitled to compensation.</p>

<p>Salkeld was very angry, and said, "Had I known what sort of a
man you were, I would, have made you miserable during your
voyage."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it," was my answer, "I had more penetration.
I saw through your character, but was not the fool to let you know
it, when I was in your power; you have by your last observation
convinced me of your tyrannical disposition. I knew better than to
quarrel with a tiger when I was at his mercy. I am now free from
your authority, and you seem to threaten me still, but I will let
you know that no man shall do so with impunity."</p>

<p>We were standing on the shore, and a great number of persons
collected about us, who listened to the conversation, and began to
comment upon it, and to express their opinion in terms, which so
alarmed him, that he made a quick retreat. I set a man to watch
that evening, and he brought me word, that a firkin of butter, a
cheese, and five or six gallons of spirits, were landed from the
ship and sent to the judge's house. When the case came on I
produced the receipt, to show that my son was a passenger, and that
I had paid the money. The judge, however, would not listen to me,
saying we were all convicts; my wife, my son, and myself. I told
his honour that it was not so, for none of us were convicts. I had,
"on terms," agreed to live in the colony, but not as a convict; and
my wife and son were both passengers, as free from imputation as
himself. He desired me to be silent, and when I remonstrated, and
said his conduct was a perversion of justice, he ordered me to be
put out of court, adding, that if I said another word, he would
commit me to gaol.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[15 January 1800]</p>

<p>The next morning, I received directions to attend a muster of
the ship's company, which I accordingly did. Captain Johnstone
asked me if I knew where I lodged last night?</p>

<p>"Not very well," I replied, "as it was the first I had passed in
the colony. All I knew was that Mr. Margarot received me kindly and
hospitably, and I was much obliged to him."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Captain Johnstone, "you lodged in the most
seditious house in the colony."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said I, "I heard no sedition there. Mr. Margarot
appears to me a gentleman of great learning and polished manners,
one whose society I should covet much, as I felt I should receive
information and instruction from him. I hope, sir, you do not wish
me to associate with thieves and robbers! I am not disposed to meet
such characters, except at arm's length."</p>

<p>He replied, "I am glad to hear you say so."</p>

<p>We were then dismissed. The unfortunate convicts were placed
under overseers, and marched away in several employments. Those
transported for rebellion were left at large, to act as they
thought proper.</p>

<p>Thomas Prosser, Thomas Brady, Edward O'Hara and myself, all
United Irishmen, and alike circumstanced, agreed to walk out
together; they were very respectable men, and our only crime was
wrong notions in politics; so all that could be said was, "there go
four United Irishmen!" I asked my poor wife for some money; she
gave me a look of inquiry, as much as to say, "Recollect, the stock
we have is small." I understood her perfectly, and said, "Yes, my
dear, three days more will complete the business, but, with the
blessing of the Almighty, I shall be able to support you and your
children better than ever which, soon after, I was enabled to
perform. I then went away with the said men, and spent the guinea I
had received from my wife at the house of a Daniel Fayne.</p>

<p>On my return, she said, "Joseph, you have never been used to
labour, how will you obtain for us subsistence?" On which I
answered, "Government will never let a good soldier want."</p>

<p>She replied, "They would rather give you a rope than a
breakfast."</p>

<p>"That is too true to be put in a ballad," said I, "but they know
I can fight, and will be glad of my services in a condemned
regiment."</p>

<p>I endeavoured to bear up against untoward and unpromising
appearances, and did not despair.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[18 Jan 1800]</p>

<p>On the 18th, I received directions to go down to the wharf, in
order to proceed to Parramatta,* with my family and luggage, it
being intended to locate me in the interior. It was not difficult
for me to comply with this order, as my luggage was little more
ponderous than the stock in trade of a journeyman tailor. We got on
board a boat, and, proceeding up the river, landed at a village
about twenty miles from Sydney, and were directed to the Rev.
Samuel Marsden,** who sent a man with me, to point out a house
where I was to fix my family. It belonged to one Henry, who was
sent out by Sir Joseph Bankes to cultivate the science of
botany.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The town at Rose Hill (so called after the
Right Hon. George Rose) was named Parramatta, on the 4th June,
1791. Collins says, "The town which had been marked out at Rose
Hill, and which now wore something of a regular appearance, on this
occasion [the King's birth-day] received its name. The Governor
called it Par-ra-mat-ta, being the name by which the natives
distinguished the part of the country on which the town
stood."]</p>

<p class="footnote">[** The Rev. Mr. Marsden arrived at New South
Wales in March, 1794, as Assistant-Chaplain to the Rev. Mr.
Johnson, Chaplain of the settlement before mentioned, and whom he
succeeded. Collins records, that on the first Sunday in September,
1796, "A temporary church, formed out of the materials of two old
huts, was opened at Parramatta, by the Rev. Mr. Marsden."]</p>

<p>The day after, I walked about the town. I saw several persons
from Dublin, of whom I had some knowledge, and also my countryman,
the most accomplished of pickpockets, Barrington.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Barrington received a warrant of
emancipation on the 3rd November, 1792; and Captain Collins, in his
account of New South Wales, speaks of him in a passage which
Barrington, with grateful pride, introduces into his History of the
Colony;&mdash;if, indeed, Barrington be the author of the volumes
published with his name, which appears to me to be more than
doubtful. "The third (warrant) was made out in favour of one who,
whatever might have been his conduct when at large in society, had
here not only demeaned himself with the strictest propriety, but
had rendered essential services to the colony&mdash;George
Barrington. He came out in the <i>Active</i>; on his arrival, the
Governor employed him at Toongabbe (some new ground beyond
Parramatta), and in a situation that was likely to attract the envy
and hatred of the convicts, in proportion as he might be vigilant
and inflexible. He was first placed as a subordinate, and, shortly
after, as a principal watchman, in which situation he was diligent,
sober and impartial; and had rendered himself so eminently
serviceable, that the Governor resolved to draw him from the line
of convicts; and, with the instrument of his emancipation, he
received a grant of thirty acres of land, in an eligible situation
near Parramatta. He was afterwards sworn in as a peace-officer.
Here was not only a reward for past good conduct, but an incitement
to it; and Barrington found himself, through the Governor's
liberality, though not so absolutely free as to return to England
at his own pleasure, yet enjoying the immunities of a free man, a
settler, and a civil officer, in whose integrity much confidence
was placed."]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[19 January 1800]</p>

<p>He was walking arm in arm with Thomas Atkins, Esq.* I wished to
have some conversation with them, and I think they desired to talk
with me. Mr. Atkins asked me into his house, and Barrington
followed. A bottle of rum was produced, and some pleasant
conversation about Ireland passed. At length I wished to retire,
but Mr. Atkins said he never allowed any bottle off his table till
he saw it emptied. We finished the half-gallon bottle, and were of
course not a little elevated, being each of us as full of chatter
as a hen magpie in May. Mr. Atkins was not a judge, but acted as a
kind of deputy when Judge Dore was not able, which frequently
happened, for, when spirits were plenty in the colony, he was
generally indisposed. Barrington asked me a great many questions
about Ireland. When I returned, Mrs. Holt said she was apprehensive
that the hot climate and the drinking would injure my health. But I
told her, the hotter the climate, the more spirits might be drank,
which I afterwards found to be the case.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Quere?</i>&mdash;Richard (not Thomas)
Atkins, who was nominated by the Secretary of State to do the duty
of Judge Advocate, upon the return of Captain Collins to England,
in 1796, which duty he performed until the arrival of Mr. Dore, in
1797. "Mr. Richard Atkins, who came out in the Pitt, and who had
been sworn a justice of the peace," says Collins, under the date of
May, 1792, "went up to Parramatta, to reside there, the constant
presence of a magistrate being deemed by the Governor indispensable
at that settlement." Mr. Atkins was subsequently appointed
Registrar of the court of Vice-Admiralty, by Governor Phillip.]</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Marsden sent me a note, to say he would call upon
me, which he did next day, in company with Captain Johnstone, Mr.
Atkins, and Dr. Thompson.* He requested me to accompany them, and
we proceeded to a government settlement, where they were tilling
the ground on the public account. At a distance, I saw about fifty
men at work, as I thought dressed in nankeen jackets, but, on
nearer approach, I found them naked, except a pair of loose
trousers. Their skin was tanned by the sun and climate to that
colour. I felt much pity for the poor wretches; they had each a
kind of large hoe, about nine inches deep and eight wide, and the
handle as thick as that of a shovel, with which they turned up, as
with a spade, the ground, which was left to rot in the winter. They
cannot bear any clothes when at work in the heat of the day.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Collins says, speaking of the arrival of the
<i>Surprise</i> at Sydney, in October, 1794, which transport
brought Messrs. Muir, Palmer, Skirving, and Margarot,&mdash;"We
found, also, on board the <i>Surprise</i>, a Mr. James Thompson,
late Surgeon of the <i>Atlantic</i> transport, but who now came in
quality of Assistant Surgeon to the settlement." He rose to be
Chief Physician of the Colony, and his attention to the invalids of
the French corvettes <i>le Geographe</i> and <i>le Naturaliste</i>,
at Port Jackson, between June and November, 1802, is particularly
noticed by M. Peron. Holt, in a subsequent part of this Memoir,
states that he left the settlement in a French discovery ship, and
chuckles at the bargain he had made for Mr. Cox, in the purchase of
Dr. Thompson's farm and stock.]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[20 January 1800]</p>

<p>Captain Johnstone addressed me, saying, "Mr. Holt, you are a
good farmer, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I do well enough with horses and oxen, but not with men," said
I.</p>

<p>Dr. Thompson then said, "Do you not think these men would
understand you better than horses or oxen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied, "but it appears great brutality to work
men in this manner."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "it matters not what you think about it, you
will soon come into it."</p>

<p>Captain Johnstone then called a man, named Michael Fitzgerald,
and said, "Here is Mr. Holt come to assist you, so you will not be
so much confined in future."</p>

<p>"I am very glad of it," replied Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>I found afterwards, that this fellow had been a respectable
pickpocket in England. When I heard this conversation, I could
scarcely contain my indignation, but I thought it better to let
matters proceed on to the end. Captain Johnstone now said, "You
must get this house of Dr. Kelly's put into neat order; let it be
bricked, ceiled, and glass windows put in, and two acres of ground
enclosed for a garden."</p>

<p>"Yes," continued Mr. Marsden, "you know Mrs. Holt and her
children are free, and have a claim to the indulgence of a free
settler, and to have a man to bring her wood and water."</p>

<p>This was some consolation to me. I had, however, got my
instructions from my friend Mr. Margarot, who knew well the
constitution and laws of the colony. Orders having been thus given,
these gentlemen went away, and I returned home. On the way, I met a
man named Mangin Power, from Dirrelossery, near Roundwood, in the
county of Wicklow, son of Timothy Power. I saw him tried, and heard
the awful sentence of death passed upon him. I spoke to him.
Captain Johnstone asked me if I knew him. I said that I did,
perfectly well, and that I was present at his trial. He was tried
for buying twenty-six sheep, which had been stolen. The thief fled,
and poor Power was discovered with the sheep in his possession, and
was found guilty of the felony; but I had no doubt whatever of his
innocence. The thief was a regular jobber in sheep, and had bought
and sold hundreds. I also said I had had dealings with Power, to a
large amount, and always found him a correct, honest man. The
account I gave of this poor fellow was very useful to him; he was
made an overseer in the government employment a few days after; and
I was well pleased at being able to serve him, having always
observed that the merciful ever obtain mercy.</p>

<p>We now reached Parramatta, when the gentlemen took leave of me,
and I made haste to my poor wife, to communicate the conversation
which had passed. She, poor soul, was always contented with
everything which pleased me, and I was anxious to do the best I
could for her and our children. I told her, if I could not do
better I would submit but having heard Mr. Atkins tell Parson
Marsden that the Governor was to come to Parramatta the next day, I
determined to ask his Excellency some questions respecting our real
state: if I was really free, I determined to assert it, but if the
law was against me, I would make the best fight I could. I would,
however, have the highest authority, even the Governor himself, and
not submit to the whims of understrappers, who always assume
tenfold the airs that their superiors might be supposed to
have.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[21 January 1800]</p>

<p>Next morning we watched for the arrival of Captain John Hunter,
Governor and Chief in and over New South Wales and its
dependencies, &amp;c.; and I had the good fortune to meet his
Excellency. Having saluted him, he very graciously returned it.
Mrs. Holt was with me, having our child in her arms. His Excellency
went over to her, and took hold of the infant's hand, saying, he
was a fine boy; adding, "Pray, madam, do you get any milk for this
child?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said my wife, "I do not know where any is to be
had."</p>

<p>The overseer of the government dairy was passing at the time,
his name was John Warren, and his Excellency asked him if he knew
where this lady lived. Warren answered, "Yes."&mdash;"Well,"
continued the Governor, "send a quart of milk to her every morning;
and mind, if you neglect doing so, I will have you put out of your
place."</p>

<p>"Many thanks to your Excellency," we both exclaimed, "may God
reward you!"</p>

<p>"May I presume to ask," said I, "if it was by your Excellency's
command I was to be put under a man of the name of Fitzgerald, as a
superintendant, at Toongabbe?"* His Excellency answered with
saying, "No, sir, I never intended, or meant to put you into
government employ; you came here as a State prisoner, without any
indent against you, and while you conduct yourself correctly, no
one can or shall molest you. All you have to do, is to conduct
yourself as a peaceable subject, and we have no desire or power to
put you under restraint."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Collins mentions, that in 1792 "the
settlements beyond Parramatta, lately obtained, were in future to
be distinguished by the name of Toon-gab-be."]</p>

<p>I then told him what the four gentlemen had said; and the
Governor assured me he would put it out of the power of any one to
annoy me in future. "If you have any ground for complaint," his
Excellency added, "come to me, and I will redress you, and give you
any assistance I can." Then turning to Mrs. Holt, he told her she
was entitled to a servant, and might choose any man who came in the
ship with her. I mentioned Thomas Murphy, and his Excellency
immediately gave me an order for him; and told me to go where I
pleased, and do the best I could for myself and family. I thanked
his Excellency heartily. I got Murphy home, and made the poor
fellow as happy as I was myself. I told my wife I was still
fortunate, and was determined that resolution and good conduct
should be my motto: the excellent woman's eyes filled with tears of
joy and gratitude for so many mercies, after so much
affliction.</p>

<p>That evening, I received a note from my friend, Mr. Cox, and
having read it, I told my wife that a reconciliation was about to
take place, for Mr. Cox wanted to see me. It being late, I deferred
my visit till the morning, when I went to his house, situated about
two miles from mine. Feeling myself once more a free man was a
delightful sensation, having been able to escape from the authority
of those busy overbearing four gentlemen already named, and
declared free by the mouth of his Excellency, the Governor himself,
one of the most worthy of men, and the father, and a right good
father he was, to this infant colony. A perfect gentleman in his
manners, he was gracious and condescending to all, without
compromising his dignity, personal or official.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[22 January 1800]</p>

<p>I was received by Mr. Cox with cordiality, respect, and even
friendship. Had I submitted to be one of his six men, we should
have met on very different terms; he joined Judge Dore in making me
out a convict, but he knew nothing of the law; and as he possibly
acted from kind motives, I ought to feel obliged to him. However,
had I been in that unfortunate situation, he would, I think, have
alleviated my sufferings.</p>

<p>The inquiries of Mrs. Cox after my wife and children were
good-natured, and even gratifying. Captain Cox told me he was in
treaty for the purchase of a farm of one hundred acres, from Mr.
John Macarthur, captain in the New South Wales corps, and he wished
me to view it for him, before he concluded the bargain. I was happy
in having an opportunity of serving him, who had certainly made my
passage agreeable, and had been very kind and attentive to me and
my family. We went to see the farm: I had never seen such mould as
it was, for it resembled an old church-yard; loose, black, rank
looking earth; the ground, too, was very well situated, and I gave
my opinion very much in favour of the purchase.</p>

<p>I did not forget to communicate to Mr. Cox the interview I had
with Captain Johnstone and the other gentlemen, and the subsequent
conversation with his Excellency the Governor; and I stated that I
was now confirmed in the opinion that I was altogether at my own
disposal, to do the best I could. Mr. Cox said he rejoiced in the
circumstance, and hoped,&mdash;indeed, he doubted not to see me a
prosperous man. He added, "I have money, and you are possessed of
considerable knowledge in agricultural pursuits; suppose we join
them together, I think we should easily make a fortune."</p>

<p>I thanked him, and hoped he had not formed too favourable an
opinion of my abilities. "But," said I, "there are two parties to a
bargain, I will, think of it, and give you an answer in a few days;
it is better to consider the matter well before I undertake it,
that we may not both have to repent hereafter."</p>

<p>The following morning, I had a visit from the Rev. Mr. Marsden,
who put on a most solemn countenance, as if he was come to visit a
person in extremes. "I am told," said he, "you are about to
undertake the management of Mr. Cox's business."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said I, "suppose I should be so inclined, what
then? but if your informer had told you I had been requested by Mr.
Cox to do so, he would have been nearer the truth. I ought to be
much obliged to those who take such an interest in my affairs."</p>

<p>"The Governor," said Mr. Marsden, "is very much displeased at
your taking such liberties; you ought to know that no person in
your situation can do anything without his Excellency's
sanction.</p>

<p>"Sir," I answered, giving him a sort of smile, as it was, and is
to the present moment my fashion, when I can dare my enemies, "Your
advice is very well meant, no doubt; you are very uneasy lest I
should fall under the Governor's displeasure, but I will release
you from any anxiety on that account. I have had an interview with
his Excellency, and have fully satisfied myself of the exact nature
of my position. I am as free as you are, or any other man in the
colony, to go where I please, and do what I wish, while I conduct
myself like a good subject; and as I have no intention of acting
otherwise, I will release you from all care on my behalf, and give
you leisure to mind your own affairs, by assuring you I feel quite
competent to manage mine without your assistance."</p>

<p>He left me without further observation, evidently nettled at the
rebuke I had given him. He thought himself a great lawyer, and was
a busy meddling man, of shallow understanding.</p>

<p>24 Next day I saw Mr. Cox, to whom I related the conversation
with Parson Marsden. He laughed heartily at my account, and said,
"The Parson should have known better than to think to outwit you.
Holt, who have outwitted thousands." He then asked me if I had made
up my mind to take charge of the farm.</p>

<p>I replied, "On what terms, Mr. Cox? for it is right explicitly
to understand each other."</p>

<p>He answered, "I will give you one-third of the net produce, or
give you a salary."</p>

<p>I said, "Mr. Cox, I have been a master all my life, and have a
great reluctance to become a servant; you have a warm temper; I am,
I know, very easily excited also, and I will not enter into any
written engagement with you, but I will undertake the management of
your farm, and if you approve of me, and I am satisfied with you,
all will be well. At the end of the year, I am sure you will do me
justice, and make me a fair remuneration."</p>

<p>He replied, "Holt, this is a hard bargain for me, but be it
according to your wishes."</p>

<p>My remark was, "We shall know one another better at the end of
that period."</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4. Making a New Life</h2>

<p class="date-jnl">[1 February 1800]</p>

<p>On the first of February, 1800, I moved my family to the Brush
Farm, which was the name of my new residence. I got men to break up
the ground, and prepared sixty acres to be sown in with wheat.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[4 June 1800]</p>

<p>It was getting late for sowing wheat, but, by great exertion, I
commenced sowing on the 24th March, and finished the 3rd of June.
The 4th of June, the King's birth-day, was a general holiday
throughout the colony, and every prisoner got a pound of beef, or
pork, as did the soldiers, with the addition of half a pint of
spirits, each man to drink the King's health.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[14 October 1800]</p>

<p>I now began to break up ground for Indian corn, or maize; and,
by October, had twenty-two acres planted. On the 14th of this
month, a hail storm destroyed every acre of wheat, which was within
three weeks of being ripe. Mr. Cox came to see it, and after
considering the matter, we concluded that it was not worth leaving
it on the ground; so I got scythes, and mowed it down, and drew it
into the pig-yard.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[10 December 1800]</p>

<p>I then immediately set about breaking up the ground, and by the
10th of December, I had eighty-four acres of Indian corn planted,
and had eventually the satisfaction of pulling from each acre fifty
bushels of maize, which served us, in place of wheat, for our men
and stock. I bought a great many swine, and they turned out Well,
and afforded excellent food for the labourers, as the farmer has to
feed all the men he employs. I paid twenty shillings per acre for
breaking the ground, ten for hoeing and planting, and ten for
chipping, (the name used in New South Wales for harrowing;) for
sowing wheat and covering, sixteen shillings; and twenty shillings
for reaping and binding, was the common price. At the Hawkesbury
they pay from two to three pounds, as the crops are much more heavy
there. The men are paid in kind at the following
prices:&mdash;Pork, one shilling and sixpence a pound; sugar, the
same; wheat, ten shillings a bushel; Indian corn, at five shillings
a bushel; tobacco, from two and sixpence to fifteen and even twenty
shillings a pound; rum, fifteen shillings a bottle; tea, from ten
to twenty shillings a pound; and all other goods at the same
ratio.</p>

<p>We were sometimes so much in want of these almost necessary
articles, that the prices rose much higher. I have seen wheat three
guineas a bushel, and Indian corn three pounds. This, however, was
caused by a flood from the Blue Mountains, which carried away
everything before it. Eight thousand sheep, three thousand pigs,
and many hundred head of cattle, were swept off, and lost, by the
overflowing of the Hawkesbury river on this occasion, which caused
great distress and misery for a long time.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In the previous year (1799), the following
account of an inundation of this river is given in the History of
New South Wales, bearing Barrington's name:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"At the Hawkesbury a sad accident occurred, which proved
destructive to the settlers at that place. The river suddenly, and
in the course of a few hours, swelled to the height of fifty feet
from its usual level, and with such rapidity as to carry everything
that stood in the way before it. The government store-house,
erected at the first settling in this part, was in the course of
this inundation swept away, with all the provisions it contained.
Several inhabitants were taken from the ridges of their houses by
boats, only in time to save their lives; for most of the dwellings
were inundated, and the whole country appeared one extensive lake.
A very considerable number of live stock, with a great part of the
produce of the last harvest, and the household property of the
people, were driven away by the torrent. Fortunate indeed may it be
esteemed, only one life was lost.<br>
<br>
"This proved a shocking calamity; as no cause had appeared to
indicate an overflow of the river, the settlers were by no means
prepared for such an event. The natives, however, foresaw it, and
advised the inhabitants of it; but, not liking to be taught by
untutored savages, they neglected their advice, and thus ruinously
felt the effects. There was, no doubt, unperceived by the'
settlers, a very heavy fall of rain in the interior, among the
mountains; and, from the parched state of the land for such a long
time, it had not been absorbed, but ran down the sides of the
hills, filling the low grounds, and branches of the river, which
was, in form, strictly serpentine, and could not give a passage to
the water as fast as it descended. It was very generally believed
this violent inundation would, however, prove beneficial to the
grounds overflowed, making them produce with such abundance as to
cover the loss sustained. In a few days this collection of water
found its way to the sea, and tire river resumed its usual level,
when the settlers began fresh cropping their grounds."<br>
<br>
In the following year (1800), Barrington thus notices the overflow
of the Hawkesbury, mentioned by Holt:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"Accounts of an alarming nature toward the latter end of the month
(March) arrived from George's river and the Hawkesbury. The weather
had, for upwards of twenty days, been very wet, which was
unfortunate, as the maize was now ripe; the wind blew a heavy gale,
accompanied with so much rain, that the river Hawkesbury, and all
the creeks, rose beyond their banks, laying the flat country under
water. The consequent damage followed the desolation which this
flood spread over the cultivated grounds, and some lives were lost,
though, considering the extent of the flood, they were few."<br>
<br>
"Had the settlers been more industrious, they must in some degree
have been prepared for accidents of this nature; and it is to be
lamented, that, when they were established on the banks of the
Hawkesbury, attention had not been paid to the evident signs of the
floods which the river appeared liable to; had the dwellings been
built on higher ground, the inundations which had occurred could
have done no injury. The late overflows had been such as exceeded
in horror and destruction everything that could be imagined."<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
"In the earlier days of the settlement, the settlers on the
Hawkesbury had been much annoyed by the frequent overflowings of
that capacious river. In the month of March, 1800, the most severe
visitation of this nature had occurred, which had destroyed the
promise of an abundant harvest, spread desolation through the farms
in that district, destroyed numerous habitations, and caused the
loss of several of the unfortunate settlers and others. At the
melancholy period alluded to, the colony in this quarter was just
reaching a degree of ease and comfort from the judicious plans put
into execution by that 'father of his people,' Governor Hunter, and
the assistance he gave them as an encouragement to industrious
exertion. Scarcely, however, had they began to revive after this
calamity&mdash;scarcely had they repaired the ravages occasioned by
this tremendous inundation&mdash;scarcely had the desolated lands
once more confessed the power of cultivation, before those
ill-fated settlers were doomed to experience a repetition of the
destructive calamity; and on the 2nd March, 1801, the river again
overflowed its banks, and rushed impetuously to renew its former
devastations. Flocks and herds were swept away by its irresistible
influence; the houses, which had been rebuilt, were once more
levelled to the earth; and a settler was deprived of his existence,
after witnessing the catastrophe which had robbed him of the whole
of his possessions. The waters of the Hawkesbury at those periods
of inundation would rise seventy or eighty feet above their
accustomed level; and it is easy for the mind to picture to itself
the inexpressibly mournful consequences which must necessarily
accrue from such a circumstance. Neither was this overflowing an
event of rare occurrence, but was to be constantly expected, after
a long continuance of the rainy season, when the torrents which
rushed from the mountainous ridges which overlooked the channel of
the river, never failed to produce a rapid swelling of its waters,
and to cause an inundation of greater or less extent, and injury
more or less destructive to the inhabitants of its
vicinity."&mdash;<i>Mann's Picture of New South Wales</i>.]</p>

<p>The ground about the Hawkesbury is flat, and lies low; but it is
the finest and most productive land perhaps in the world: it
produces two crops every year. I lived in that quarter thirteen
years, and thirteen years before that the land was regularly
cropped every year, and produced enormous crops, but never got or
required a pound of manure. The farmers throw the manure into the
rivers, and burn straw to get it out of their way. There were other
lands, however, which required labour and manure as much as the
mountains of Wicklow; but every district yields two crops a year,
the sheep produce lambs twice, and all other females are equally
prolific after their kinds. There are eight animals here who carry
their young in a kind of natural bag under their belly, and are of
a different shape and make from the animals of any other
country.</p>

<p>Mr. Cox had made a purchase of a large flock of sheep from
Captain Macarthur; they were old rotten ewes of the Bengal breed;
he paid three pounds each for them, and one hundred and fifty
pounds for a brood mare. I did not see them before the bargain was
made. Captain Cox was a man of strict integrity, and thought every
man bound by his word, and, if pledged, his honour was inviolable;
but, whatever Mr. Macarthur thought, he did not act in this affair
in a gentlemanlike manner. He was as far from it, in this and other
transactions, as my nose is from silver.</p>

<p>Every soldier got twenty-five acres of land in fee; many of
them, when intoxicated, sold their ticket for a gallon of rum. Mr.
Macarthur used to supply them with goods, and so obtained from
these improvident and foolish men their tickets, by which he
acquired an enormous landed property. He was a tailor and
stay-maker by trade, but fortune favoured him, and he became rich;
and like most men who are raised from nothing, he did not bear his
prosperity meekly; his character was that of a very overbearing and
tyrannical man. He made Mr. Cox pay dearly for these sheep and the
mare.</p>

<p>Mr. Cox wanted to purchase some horned cattle from him, and
consulted me about them. I advised him to stick to Arthur and we
would try to make up the loss he had sustained in the sheep.
Macarthur had about one hundred head of cattle, bulls and cows; and
I advised Mr. Cox to take a bottle or two of wine with him, and
then to make the bargain after dinner. It was agreed that Mr. Cox
should buy half the stock undivided and they were to remain so for
eighteen months; he was to pay &pound;500 down, and the rest when
the division took place. The money was paid, and the cattle were
afterwards divided, when their sale produced &pound;1200 more than
the first cost; so much had they increased in number and value. I
bought from Macarthur sixty-nine pigs for Mr. Cox, by which I
cleared for him &pound;150; so we made up the loss he had sustained
by the manoeuvres of the first bargain.</p>

<p>The Rev. Richard Johnson was the first clergyman who had ever
landed in this colony, and, by his prudence and economy, he made a'
large fortune, with which he was now about to return to England. He
first raised and cultivated the orange-tree in the colony. He sowed
those seeds which he had brought with him from Rio, and in a few
years the trees produced very fine fruit, which he sold at from
sixpence to ninepence each. Mr. Cox purchased from this gentleman
his estate, which joined the Brush Farm. It consisted of 600 acres
of land, about 150 sheep, a mare and three fillies, and some horned
cattle. This purchase increased my ride to about twelve miles;
there was in it about two acres of vineyard, which, some years,
bore abundantly; and another acre, covered with large orange-trees,
early nectarines, peaches, and some apricots. The place was called
Canterbury; it was about five miles from Sydney. I pruned the vines
and fruit-trees, and now I found my early instruction in gardening
of great use to me. Mr. Cox wished to have a handsome place here,
and we began to build a large dwelling-house.</p>

<p>Every Saturday I rode to Brush Farm, and settled with the men
there. I called all hands, and showed them their week's work; and
if I thought I should not be wanted before the week was out, I did
not go there until the Saturday following. I thus managed both
estates to Mr. Cox's perfect satisfaction, and he became more
attached to me than ever. He also bought all the stock of horses
and cattle from Captain Prentice, which was a great addition to our
herd.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[5 September 1800]</p>

<p>On the 5th of September, 1800, I went to Brush Farm to measure
out the ground to be broken for corn, and had, as usual, settled
with and paid up the men. I had been so completely occupied with my
agricultural employments, as to be absolutely absorbed by them;
every other subject was banished from my thoughts, and I enjoyed a
repose and quiet of mind which I had not felt since I was living in
peaceable and quiet, but prosperous obscurity, at Roundwood.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to prosper which I put my hand to; my
excellent wife was recovering her good looks, and had thrown off
the woe-worn countenance of care and anxiety which had so-long
oppressed her; and my boys were lively and healthy children, and
promised me much satisfaction and happiness. In short, after all my
troubles, I at last found at Brush Farm <i>a home</i>, and a happy
one. What charms are to be found in that word, "home!" We repose
there in supposed safety; on my return, I was sure to be welcomed
by the smiles of my excellent partner, who was always anxiously
watching at the expected hour, and I was always met by her with
affectionate warmth. What does that man deserve who disturbs the
quiet and peace of an honest well-disposed man's
fireside?&mdash;who murders his peace?&mdash;for murder it
assuredly is&mdash;if you render a heaven on earth a hell, most
foul and malicious murder it is.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5. Holt's Arrest</h2>

<p class="poem">I lived in joys like these awhile,<br>
Folks far and near caress me,<br>
When, woe to me, mine enemy,<br>
Determined to distress me.</p>

<p>I was rather fatigued, after a hard day's work; for I had ridden
and walked a great way. After-drinking a little wine and water, we
went to bed, and I was soon asleep. About one in the morning, my
wife awaked me, hearing a noise of men talking near the house. I
thought it likely some persons were about to rob the granary, and I
got up in my shirt. Shortly after, there was a rap at the door. I
demanded, "Who is there?"</p>

<p>"A friend," answered a strange voice.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said I.</p>

<p>"I come with a message from Captain Cox."</p>

<p>I immediately opened the door, on which I was astonished at
seeing eight soldiers and a sergeant enter with fixed bayonets,
which they presented at my breast. I asked them what they were
about, to which they answered they would soon let me know. I said
it is a most cowardly proceeding to present muskets and bayonets
against the breast of an unarmed and naked man; for I was in my
shirt. "What is the cause of all this? I am totally at a loss to
guess what it means. Had I done or even said anything for which I
had any apprehension, I should have been prepared to meet you; and
see," I added, showing them a blunderbuss at the foot of my bed, "I
could have blown you all to eternity." They took down the
blunderbuss, and found a twelve-finger charge in it. They were
talking of taking it away with them; but I cautioned them against
adding robbery to the injustice they were committing, as it was the
property of William Cox, Esq.</p>

<p>When I had dressed myself, they found I was a person of superior
rank; so they added a pair of steel ruffles to the wrists of my
shirt, and brought me to the guard-house of Parramatta!</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[6 September 1800]</p>

<p>The next day I was put into a boat, and they were so good as to
send two persons with me in attendance to Sydney, who introduced me
to Mr. Daniel McKay,* a Scotchman, a person whose acquaintance I
did not covet; for he had been a transport, convicted of picking
pockets, or, in other words, of robbery; and as, on the principle
of setting a thief to catch a thief, they appointed this thief to
keep other thieves after they were caught; he was promoted to the
honourable office of gaoler of Sydney.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In 1794, Collins notices this man as an
incorrigible gambler, in the following passage:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"The late distress of the colony was not found to have made any
amendment in the morals of the convicts. Gaming still prevailed
among them in its fullest extent, and a theft, which was committed
at one of these meetings, showed how far it was carried. Among
those who made a daily practice of gaming, was one, who, in his
situation as an overseer, had given such offence to some of his
fellow-prisoners, that a plan was formed to plunder him the first
time that he should have a sum worthy of their attention. He was
accordingly surrounded, when engaged at play, by a party who,
watching their opportunity, rushed upon him when he had won a stake
of five and twenty dollars, and in the confusion that ensued,
secured the whole. He was, however, fortunate enough to seize one
of them with ten of the dollars in his hand, but was not able to
recover any more. The man whom he secured proved to be Samuel
Wright, who, in the month of July last, had been reprieved at the
foot of the gallows; so soon had he forgotten the terror of that
moment! On this circumstance being reported to the Lieutenant
Governor, Wright received an immediate corporal punishment.<br>
<br>
"McKay, the overseer, confessed that gaming had been for many years
his profession and subsistence, though born of honest and reputable
parents, and he acknowledged that, but for his pursuit of that
vice, he should never have visited this country in the situation of
a convict."]</p>

<p>We do not in England or Ireland attach much mildness of
character to the turnkey of a gaol. It sometimes happens that a
petty larceny rascal, or even a felon, who has not been steeped in
the lowest dregs of villainy, may be so far reformed as to be
thought worthy of being made one of the many-headed dogs of a
county gaol; a kind of deputy devil, with eminent qualities as a
tormentor, as well as a watcher over gaol birds committed to his
care; such a man, in comparison to Daniel McKay, would have been
thought worthy to be made a member of a colonial parliament, had
such a thing existed, or a justice of the peace, or judge, like the
<i>Doer</i>* of legal injuries in this colony; when compared to
this worthy, those fellows were angels of light.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Holt is here evidently punning on the Judge
Advocate's name. See p. 73.]</p>

<p>On my being handed over to his keeping, the following
conversation took place:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Weel, Master General Hoult, and you're welcome; I shall be
teaching ye a new exercise, for I hae nae doot but ye'll be hangit,
and I wish ye may, for weel ye deserve it."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt your wishes," said I; "for if there be any
humanity about you, there must be much deceit, as a more
unpromising-looking subject I never saw."</p>

<p>"You'll find oot my guid qualities, nae doot, in a foo days,"
said he; "sae just gang awa' by, wi' yer gates, intil this
comfortable lodgin'."</p>

<p>I was then put into a cell, and orders were given not to admit
any one to see me, nor was I to have any support but the gaol
allowance of a bottle of water and a pound of bread each day. The
doors were shut, and here I was again a poor unfortunate wretch in
the power of enemies. What new freak fortune was playing upon me, I
could not divine; I asked myself questions, and formed many
surmises as to what possibly could be the cause of the harsh
treatment I had met with, or, indeed, of my arrest at all. I felt
confident in my innocence of any crime. I had not even associated
with any one in particular, but had been so totally absorbed by the
business in which I was engaged, that I had no room for other
occupation; I never thought of anything but my own affairs, it
being my disposition to devote myself entirely to whatever I
undertook, knowing that no man can perform two things at the same
time, so well as if he gave up his entire attention to one of them.
I was puzzled to guess what I was accused of, but consoled with the
reflection that it must be a false charge. I trusted in my Maker to
relieve me from this, as He had from so many troubles. I had often
been afflicted, I prayed, and my prayer was always heard. Impressed
with this consoling reflection, I fell asleep, although I had no
bed, or even a bundle of straw, to keep my poor carcase from
contact with the cold flag-stones of my cell. In my youthful days,
I had read a book called "The Innocent Sufferer," and I thought
that if I should now die, my fate would, like that of the hero of
this story, afford an important moral for the benefit of
mankind.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[7 September 1800]</p>

<p>Next day the door of my cell was opened by the captivating and
interesting McKay, who brought me a bottle of water and my pound of
bread. I asked him if there was any news; he answered, with a
sneer, "Oh, yes; there be some foo of your Irishers to be hangit
presently."</p>

<p>I answered, "if they deserve it, I do not pity them."</p>

<p>He said no more, but locked the doors; and I was left to
twenty-four hours more of uninterrupted contemplation. I did not
use this time unprofitably; I prayed to my Creator, my bountiful
and merciful God, "with whom there is mercy, with whom there is
plenteous redemption," even to redeem my soul from the lowest pit
of hell, much more from the cell I was now so unjustly thrust into,
and from the merciless tormenting of devils incarnate. Although I
had often suffered from false witnesses, I considered that my
Redeemer had, for my sake, suffered persecution, even to a shameful
death upon a gibbet, while I had been rescued from death and shame.
Shall I then complain at this dispensation? said I; No! I will not;
I will trust in the Almighty providence for release from the hands
of my enemies. I had often before trusted in the mercy of my God,
and never in vain; all things may yet work together for good; this
affliction may yet be for my benefit.</p>

<p>I never touched the bread or water left in the cell; it was now
the second night; I lay down and slept, but uneasily, annoyed by
the hard cold stones. I was troubled with dreams, and uncomfortable
visions passed through my mind.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[8 September 1800]</p>

<p>I awoke; it was day; a shutter had been removed, and I saw the
light once more; I was no longer in darkness. About ten o'clock the
gaoler appeared with a second bottle of water, and the pound of
bread. He was about to take away the other bottle, and was
surprised to find it full, and the allowance of bread beside it,
untouched. He asked me if I intended to starve myself to death? I
answered, "My God supports me in my affliction, because I am
unjustly persecuted." He made no reply, but closed the door, and
went away.</p>

<p>Whether he told the Provost Marshal,* or not, I cannot say; but,
about eleven o'clock, that officer, attended by Captain Aikin,**
who commanded a merchant ship that lay in the harbour, came to the
gaol. The Provost Marshal looked very hard at me, and at length
said, "I am sorry to see you in this place."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Mr. Thomas Smyth. He had been acting
store-keeper at Sydney, and was appointed to succeed Mr. Henry
Brewer as Provost Marshal, in 1796, Brewer having become too aged
and infirm for the office. Captain Collins, in his account of the
colony, under the date of October 1792, says:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"As a store-keeper was a person on whom much dependence must
necessarily be placed, (it being his duty to be constantly present
whenever the stores were opened, and with a vigilant eye to observe
the conduct of the inferior servants,) at the strong recommendation
of the officers under whom he had served, sergeant Thomas Smyth was
discharged from the marine detachment, and placed upon the list of
superintendants of convicts as a store-keeper. This appointment
gave general satisfaction; and the Commissary now felt himself,
under all these arrangements, more at ease respecting the safety of
the stores and provisions under his charge."]</p>

<p class="footnote">[** <i>Quere</i>, Erskine?]</p>

<p>I answered, "Sir, I thank you for your commiseration; perhaps
you will be so good as to tell me when I am to suffer."</p>

<p>He stared at me, and at last said, "<i>Suffer</i>&mdash;what do
you mean? I do not understand you."</p>

<p>"Why, Sir," said I, "no man but one under sentence of death is
ever treated as I am. Put into a solitary cell, without even a
bundle of straw to keep his wretched body from the cold stones, and
given to support him such a miserable pittance as that you behold,
for two days. The British laws suppose every man to be innocent
until his guilt is made manifest; until then, he is never subjected
to more deprivation than is necessary for his security from escape.
Sir, until a man is found guilty, he is entitled to humane
treatment; and I declare, most solemnly to my God, at this moment,
that I have not the remotest notion of the cause of my arrest, or
why I am here, and why I am treated like a reprobate
malefactor."</p>

<p>The Provost Marshal and Captain Aikin seemed moved by these
observations. One of them then said, "If I were in your place, I
would tell the Governor what I knew about this plot."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Barrington gives the following account of
this conspiracy, or fancied conspiracy, for suspected participation
in which Holt appears to have been arrested:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"The Governor, in the beginning of May, received information from
the officers, that they had some grounds for suspecting that the
convicts from Ireland had brought with them the principles which
occasioned their being sent from that kingdom, and were holding
seditious correspondences, and unlawful meetings. To discover
whether there was any foundation for this, he called in the
assistance of Lieutenant Governor King, Colonel Paterson, Major
Foveaux, and the other magistrates; when it was determined to make
a general search among the persons suspected, in all parts of the
colony at the same time, and to secure and seal up their
papers.<br>
<br>
"This examination took place on the 15th; but nothing was
discovered that could furnish the smallest evidence of the imputed
crimes.<br>
<br>
"The next day, a convict, who had, with great earnestness,
propagated a report that many pikes had been secretly made, and, to
prevent detection, they had been sunk in a well known part of the
harbour, was examined. This fellow, on being examined by the
magistrates, confessed he knew nothing of what he had asserted, and
said he was intoxicated at the time. For this he was severely
punished, and it was doubtful it he had not chosen to suffer rather
than make known his confederates. Thus, he perhaps imagined, he
proved his innocence to his accusers, and his truth to his rebel
companions.<br>
<br>
"The secrecy with which this business was conducted prevented the
magistrates from making any discovery, and, of course, they
succeeded in no degree on an examination of Harold, the
before-mentioned Catholic priest, as being a party in seditious
conversations; for nothing appeared to criminate him, though the
fact was universally credited. The Governor judged it necessary, in
consequence of these conjectures, to extract the heads of several
acts against seditious correspondence or unlawful assemblies of the
people; and altering them so as to suit the settlement, published
them as a Proclamation, that none might plead ignorance of the
existence of such laws. This, besides being made public in the
usual manner, was read on Sunday the 24th, in church, after the
performance of divine service.<br>
<br>
"Some very serious rumours were circulated early in September,
respecting the prisoners lately sent from Ireland for sedition, and
being concerned in the late rebellion. It was asserted that they
had formed a plan for gaining possession of the colony; and that
many pikes were in great forwardness.<br>
<br>
These reports caused the Governor to nominate a committee of
officers to examine all suspected persons, and endeavour to
ascertain if any such design existed.<br>
<br>
"In the routine of their enquiries, they found occasion to imprison
Harold, the Catholic priest, who, both from his language and
behaviour, was suspected of being concerned in the intended attack
on the Government. He confessed the reports were founded in truth,
and undertook to discover the weapons concealed, of which it had
been said several hundreds were made. He implicated several of his
countrymen, and they, on being questioned, accused others; indeed,
from what transpired on the examination, the committee thought them
all deserving of punishment. Harold, however, was unable to fulfil
his promise of producing the pikes. He first said they were buried
in the ground of a settler; but, on searching every part of it, no
pikes could be found. He then said they were sunk in the harbour;
but here neither could they be discovered. Thus failing, he tried
to persuade an Irishman to make a few, in support of his assertion;
but the man, unfortunately for him, had been transported for having
already been a dealer in those articles, and declared he would not
involve himself a second time on their account. He, however, did at
length find a man to make something like one, from an old hinge:
this bore too strongly the marks of imposition to gain any credit.
There was evidently a determination to create an alarm. Harold,
declaring that he only, as their priest, was able to come at the
facts, was thought to be aiming at making himself of consequence in
the new-intended government. He had, some time since, applied to
the Governor for liberty to act as their priest; and, most
undoubtedly, had he been well-affected to the government, he might
have been of use to the colony in that office."]</p>

<p>I now began to surmise that I had been arrested on suspicion;
but was still ignorant of what was meant by <i>the plot</i>.</p>

<p>I answered, "I know nothing of any plot, and I cannot tell what
I do not know; I will not invent lies to injure any man, or to
please any Governor. If I were in a plot, I would not betray it;
but I am not, nor ever will be, willingly. If you have my
death-warrant in your pocket, take me out; I am sick of life. I am,
and have long been, the victim of tyranny and oppression, which
have been following me round the world; and I shall be glad to be
freed from a life of wretchedness and persecution. I did hope I
should have avoided tyranny here, but, wherever man exists, bad
passions and villainy find there a sure abode. Man, indeed, is
deceitful and desperately wicked."</p>

<p>Both these gentlemen were moved by my distress. Captain Aikin
took me by the hand, and, addressing the Provost Marshal, said,
"Sir, it is worse than murder to treat this man so inhumanly. I am
sure he is innocent; and, if so, what a horrible injustice has been
committed against him! If his guilt were manifest, it would not
justify the treatment he has received; but, if otherwise, place
yourself in his situation, and can words express the indignation
you would feel?" The tears ran down the cheeks of this worthy man,
and even the Provost Marshal's eyes were full.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," I said, "I know not the charge which is against me;
but, if I did, I would rather die than divulge a secret, after I
had sworn or promised to keep it."</p>

<p>Mr. Smyth, the Provost Marshal, then said, "I would have you
write to his Excellency the Governor, and, in a strong and forcible
manner, and let him know how you have been treated."</p>

<p>"Sir," I answered, "how can I write without either pen, ink, or
paper, or even light sufficient? I have no doubt God will give me
light in the world to come, where the wicked cease from troubling,
and the weary are at rest; but I have little hopes of peace and
quiet here."</p>

<p>In reply, the Provost Marshal said, that he would send me pen,
ink, and paper, and ordered that the door of the cell should be
left open. They both saw the bread and water of two days lying on
the floor of my cell by the wall, and they asked me whether that
was the allowance sent me, to which I answered in the affirmative,
observing that I would rather perish than touch a morsel of it. I
was anxious to die in the cell, if I could bring my wife and
children with me, and be rid of the tyranny and oppression of this
abominable world.</p>

<p>Mr. Smyth said, he hoped I would eat a breakfast he would send
me; adding, "if I were to lose my commission as Provost Marshal by
it, I will not suffer you to be without wholesome and proper food."
Both begged me not to despair, and all would yet be well. They
shook me cordially by the hand, and went away. Shortly after, Mr.
Smyth's servant brought me pen, ink, and paper, a chair and a
table, with a comfortable breakfast, which I ate, and then took up
the pen, and wrote to the Governor the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Sir,&mdash;I acknowledge the great power invested
in you; you are his Majesty's representative, and all I hope is,
that you will not disgrace your power, or go beyond the bounds of
the happy laws made for the protection of all his Majesty's
subjects. I am sorry that the law which is so ready to punish, is
not as prompt in protection. You know. Sir, there is a higher power
than yours; I only wish for fair usage as a man, and British law.
It may happen your Excellency to be tried, as the Governor of
India, was for flogging a man to death.<br>
<br>
I remain, your Excellency's<br>
Most humble and obedient Servant,<br>
Joseph Holt.</p>

<p>Mr. Smyth came, and took the letter to his Excellency, who, when
he had read it, as I was told by Mr. Smyth, took off his hat and
flung it down on the floor, and stamped with his feet in a violent
manner, muttering words to himself. At length, he turned to Mr.
Smyth, and said, "Let Holt be put in irons, and kept still more
strictly." He then walked about the room in silence for some time;
and then, turning to Mr. Smyth, said, in a more moderated tone,
"Mr. Smyth, have you any farther business?"</p>

<p>"None whatever, your Excellency, except about Mr. Holt."</p>

<p>"Then, you may go," answered he, snappishly.</p>

<p>"I know your Excellency's justice and humanity," replied Smyth,
"and I am satisfied you would not willingly punish an innocent
man."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said the Governor.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," continued Smyth, "if it turns out, as I am
satisfied it will, that Mr. Holt is free from, any knowledge of the
business for which he has been arrested, you will regret much the
hardships he has already suffered. He has not eaten a morsel of the
prison allowance since he was confined, and is already half
famished. He is a man of high spirit, and would rather die than
live in a state of unjust oppression. Great allowance should be
made for his feelings and expressions, if he be innocent."</p>

<p>"You are right, Smyth," said the Governor; "go to the gaol, and
have him removed to the debtor-side, and let him have wine and
spirits, but not to excess; and let his wife, or any respectable
person, see him at his pleasure."</p>

<p>My excellent friend, Smyth, came to me, with joy in his
countenance, and gave me this account of the good success of his
interview with the Governor. He took me out of Daniel McKay's
fangs, and brought me over to the house of the head gaoler, who was
also chief constable, and kept a public-house adjoining the prison,
where we had some rum and water, and other refreshment. He then
left orders with Henry Kable to allow me to take refreshment
whenever I wished. This Mr. Smyth was a North of Ireland man, and
so was Captain Aikin; and during the month I was confined, they
were very constant in their visits to me, or in sending Kable to me
to supply me with every necessary.</p>

<p>A few days after, nineteen men, charged with the conspiracy to
upset the government, for which I now found that I had been
arrested, were taken from the gaol, and brought before the Governor
for examination. Eighteen of them turned informers. These rascals
were all asked about me; but not one of them knew any thing to my
injury. They were a troublesome clutch of blackguards, and not a
few of them were sentenced to be flogged, which took place every
day; some of them sank under the effects of the punishment. Mr.
Harold, the priest, was said to be concerned in the plot.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[6 October 1800]</p>

<p>On the 6th of October, orders were given to prepare for the boat
to go to Parramatta. Mr. Smyth came and took me out of the prison,
and we went in a Government boat. About ten miles from Sydney we
met the passage-boat,* on board of which I spied my wife, with her
young child. Mr. Smyth instantly ordered the men to row to the
passage-boat, and take Mrs. Holt on board, which was done
accordingly.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Recording the occurrences of the year 1793,
Collins says&mdash;"Among the conveniences that were now enjoyed In
the colony, must be mentioned the introduction of passage boats,
which, for the benefit of settlers and others,'were allowed to go
between Sydney and Parramatta. They were the property of persons
who had served their respective terms of transportation, and from
each passenger one shilling was required for his passage; luggage
was paid for at the rate of one shilling per cwt.; and the entire
boat could be hired by one person for six shillings. This was a
great accommodation to the description of people whom it was
calculated to serve, and the proprietors of the boats found it very
profitable to themselves."]</p>

<p>When we arrived at Parramatta the prisoners were all put in
gaol, except the priest, who was left in a private house, on which,
however, a guard was placed; and Mr. Smyth allowed me to go at
liberty upon my parole of honour, to call on him in the
morning.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[7 October 1800]</p>

<p>I attended, to the minute. We marched to Toongabbe, where all
the government transports were kept, who were called out to witness
the punishment of the prisoners. One man, named Maurice Fitzgerald,
was sentenced to receive three hundred lashes, and the method of
punishment was such as to make it most effectual. The unfortunate
man had his arms extended round a tree, his two wrists tied with
cords, and his breast pressed closely to the tree, so that
flinching, from the blow was out of the question, for it was
impossible for him to stir. Father Harold was ordered to put his
hand against the tree by the hands of the prisoner, and two men
were appointed to flog, namely, Richard Rice, a left-handed man,
and John Johnson, the hangman from Sydney, who was right-handed.
They stood on each side of Fitzgerald; and I never saw two
threshers in a barn move their flails with more regularity than
these two man-killers did, unmoved by pity, and rather enjoying
their horrid employment than otherwise. The very first blows made
the blood spout out from Fitzgerald's shoulders; and I felt so
disgusted and horrified, that I turned my face away from the cruel
sight. One of the constables employed to carry into effect this
tremendous punishment, came up to me, and desired me to "look on,
at my peril." I frowned at the monster with disdain, and told him I
would demolish him if he attempted to interfere with me. Mr. Smyth
then advanced, and asked the fellows who had gathered about me what
authority they had to take any notice of me; upon which they walked
off. I could only compare these wretches to a pack of hounds at the
death of a hare, or tigers, who torment their victims before they
put them to death; and yet these fellows, I venture to assert, were
arrant cowards; for cowardice is always equal to
cruelty&mdash;fellows who dare not face a brave foe, but would cut
a submissive captive to mince-meat.</p>

<p>I have witnessed many horrible scenes; but this was the most
appalling sight I had ever seen. The day was windy, and I protest,
that although I was at least fifteen yards to leeward, from the
sufferers, the blood, skin, and flesh blew in my face as the
executioners shook it off from their cats. Fitzgerald received his
whole three hundred lashes, during which Doctor Magon used to go up
to him occasionally to feel his pulse, it being contrary to law to
flog a man beyond fifty lashes without having a doctor present. I
never shall forget this humane doctor, as he smiled and said, "Go
on; this man will tire you both before he fails!" During the time
Fitzgerald was receiving the punishment, he never uttered a groan;
the only words he said were, "Flog me fair; do not strike me on the
neck." When it was over, two constables took him by the arms to
help him into the cart. He said to them, "Let my arms go," and
struck each of them in the pit of the stomach with his elbows, and
knocked them both down; he then stepped into the cart unassisted,
as if he had not received a blow. The doctor remarked, "That man
has strength enough to bear two hundred more."</p>

<p>The next prisoner who was tied up was Paddy Galvin, a young lad
about twenty years of age; he was also sentenced to receive three
hundred lashes. The first hundred were given on his shoulders, and
he was cut to the bone between the shoulder-blades, which were both
bare. The doctor then directed the next hundred to be inflicted
lower down, which reduced his flesh to such a jelly that the doctor
ordered him to have the remaining hundred on the calves of his
legs. During the whole time Galvin never even whimpered or
flinched, if, indeed, it had been possible for him to have done so.
He was asked, "where the pikes were hid?" Galvin answered, that he
did not know, and that, if he did, he would not tell.</p>

<p>"You may hang me," said he, "if you like; but you shall have no
music out of my mouth to make others dance upon nothing." He was
put into the cart and sent to the hospital. Three other men then
received each one hundred lashes, and they sung out lustily, from
first to last. The name of one of these men was, Michael
Fitzgerald, a shoemaker by trade. They were all from the county of
Cork, and lived near Sir Henry Browne Hayes's.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Sir Henry Browne Hayes, who had served the
office of sheriff of the city of Cork, was tried in 1801 for the
abduction of Miss Pike, a Quaker lady of large fortune, and was
sentenced to death, which sentence was commuted to transportation
for life. Upon a considerable reward being offered for his
apprehension, Sir Henry walked into the shop of a hair-dresser in
Cork, named Coghlan, observing, after some conversation, that as it
was his intention to surrender himself, Coghlan might as well have
the benefit of the reward by giving him up. The following is one of
the many epigrams current at this time upon the subject:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"The fate of Sir Harry is sure a hard case;<br>
Unable in Cork to exhibit His face,<br>
Pursued by the brethren, proclaimed in the papers,<br>
Though his mighty misdeeds were mere boyish capers;<br>
Since Mercy, high Goddess, revisits these climes.<br>
And rebels and traitors are pardoned their crimes,<br>
Tho' different his guilt, let them all share alike,<br>
He was not <i>United</i>, and gave up his <i>Pike</i>."<br>
<br>
Sir Henry Hayes, as subsequently appears in this volume, suffered
shipwreck with Holt in returning to Ireland.]</p>

<p>When this terrible exhibition was over, Mr. Smyth and I walked
to Parramatta, and went to a tavern kept by James Larra, an honest
Jew,* where we dined upon a nice lamprey and some hung beef. After
dinner I was joined by my wife and child, and then went in a boat
to Colonel William Paterson's,** the Lieutenant-Governor, to
receive sentence. The tide, which runs up sixteen miles, was
favourable, as was the land-breeze; so that we ran down in an hour
and forty minutes. Many of the prisoners were sent to gaol previous
to being sent to Norfolk Island. After the fate of the rest had
been announced, the Colonel turned to me, and said, "Mr. Holt, it
is Governor King's orders that you take charge of the gaol gang,
and oversee them."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Collins chronicles that, in September 1794,
James Larra, who was a convict for life, received, with other
convicts, a conditional pardon, "or (as was the term among
themselves on this occasion) were made free on the ground, to
enable them to become settlers." Larra was a French Jew, and his
countryman, M. Peron, has made particular mention of him.]</p>

Country of the Hottentots and Caffraria, in the years
1777-8-9."]</p>

<p>I looked at him for about a minute, turning over in my mind what
answer I should give, and then said, "Sir, with due submission and
respect, I hope you will deliver to His Excellency my answer. I was
declared by Governor Hunter legally exempt from all compulsory
employment, and I have not since forfeited the rights of a British
subject by any crime, and, with God's blessing, it is my
determination to act and live as a dutiful and faithful subject to
my King and his laws. If His Excellency has power to make me a
slave, he has also power to take my life, and assuredly the latter
will be an easier task to accomplish than the former. I will never
live a slave, or submit to be degraded into a convicted felon."</p>

<p>The good old gentleman immediately retired. My wife was
dreadfully alarmed at my boldness, and said:</p>

<p>"My dear Joe, you are likely to lose your life by your hasty
temper."</p>

<p>I answered, "What is life, if it be clogged with such shocking
conditions? I had rather die a dozen times than be made a driver of
slaves, or to be constantly associated with the degraded wretches
of Toongabbe; besides, I know that the Governor cannot legally
compel me, and I do not think that he will do anything unlawfully
when he considers of the consequences."</p>

<p>The Colonel soon returned, saying:</p>

<p>"Mr. Holt, His Excellency wishes to see you himself."</p>

<p>I said, "I can go calmly to receive sentence of death, but will
never submit to arbitrary degradation."</p>

<p>I was conducted into the Governor's presence by a sergeant, and
I made my reverence respectfully to the King's representative, not
at all relaxing the stern determination of my countenance. He
looked very earnestly at me for some time, and at last, in a mild
and kind tone of voice, said, "You are very fond of your family,
Mr. Holt?"</p>

<p>"Your Excellency," said I, "I ought to be so; I have a worthy
and affectionate wife, and I am the father of good and dutiful
children; I hope I shall never disgrace them. I trust I do not
stand lower in Your Excellency's estimation on that account."</p>

<p>He then said, "Go home, then, with your wife and family, and
come to me hereafter, and I will give you a grant of land for
them." I bowed with gratitude, and told His Excellency his bounty
to me should not be abused; for I was disposed to be a faithful and
good subject, and nothing should lead me from that path. I joined
my poor wife immediately, whose heart was nearly broken with
apprehension of the Governor's displeasure, and she was overjoyed
at hearing that I received a reward instead of punishment. The
intelligence was too much for her, and she fainted away, but soon
recovered. I then went to Colonel Paterson, and thanked that
excellent man with an overflowing heart for his goodness to me; but
I was so much affected, that I could scarcely utter more than
broken expressions of gratitude. He said he felt happy in rescuing
me from oppression, and assured me that His Excellency's opinion of
me was now very favourable; "but not better," Colonel Paterson was
pleased to add, "than I am satisfied you deserve."</p>

<p>I then went to Henry Kable's,* and purchased some wine and rum,
and got into the boat to return home. It was one o'clock before we
reached Mr. Cox's house, where we went ashore. As soon as our
voices were heard, Mrs. Cox and her family got up, and showed their
kindness and affection by every possible mark of attention. After
stopping a few minutes, we proceeded to Brush Farm, and here I was
once more at peace in my own home.</p>

Wales, (1811)," describing one of the views of Sydney (No, 2),
which it was published to accompany and illustrate, says, "The

windows in front, and the warehouses around it, are discovered,
belongs to Mr. Henry Kable, who, with Messrs. Lord and Underwood,
have been very industrious and enterprising in the oil and
seal-skin trade, &amp;c., and possess a number of vessels and
considerable estates in the colony."]</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6. Free again</h2>

<p>The next morning I went through the flocks and herds; viewed and
counted them, and entered their increase and decrease in my
stock-book. I then went to the men, and ascertained what had been
done in my absence. My son had looked after the business; but,
being only thirteen years of age, I wished to prove the men's
honesty under his care; so I examined the day-book, transferred the
entries to my ledger, and made up my accounts, as I did not know
but Mr. Cox might discharge me, he having taken no steps whatever,
upon my arrest and confinement, which nettled me not a little.
After breakfast, I tied up my book in a pocket-handkerchief, and
walked with it over to Mr. Cox's house, and there, with Mr. James
King, the steward or clerk over the stores, who gave out everything
for the farm monthly, and kept the accounts, I compared books, and
saw that the debits and credits had been correctly entered.</p>

<p>Having arranged everything about Brush Farm upon this system, so
that there could be no mistake, I enquired respecting Canterbury.
Mr. King showed me a small book, which he had made; I took it, and
having ordered a horse to be saddled, I told King I would ride to
Canterbury, and overhaul the stock, settle with the men, and see
that all was right there, when my mind would be easy. I then asked
King if Mr. Cox had engaged any one in my situation, who said he
had heard nothing about it. I told him I should be glad to see Mr.
Cox on my return, and leaving him, proceeded to Canterbury. King
thought I had made up my mind to quit Mr. Cox's employment, and
told him so.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Cox accordingly sent for my wife, and asked her if
she knew anything of my intention of leaving my situation. She told
them she had not heard me say anything about it, but she knew I was
disappointed and hurt at the indifference Mr. Cox had apparently
exhibited on my arrest, having taken no steps on my behalf, and she
had heard me say that I had my choice of two of the best situations
in the colony. She knew also that Captain Rowley* had gone to see
me in prison, but she was not acquainted with the purport of his
visit. Mrs. Holt was going away, but Mrs. Cox would not allow her,
saying, that I would be soon back, and she might as well stay until
my return. She then made my wife some handsome presents, and, I
must admit, my wife told me that during the time I was in
confinement, Mrs. Cox appeared very much distressed and afflicted,
and shed many a tear at the distress of my wife and family. This
increased my attachment; but I could not account for Mr. Cox's
neglect of me in my trouble.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Captain Thomas Rowley, of the New South
Wales corps, in which his commission as Captain was dated 21st
June, 1796. He appears to have left this corps about 1802.]</p>

<p>The violent and intemperate disposition of Governor King, made
it difficult to know how to act; it often plunged innocent people
into most distressing circumstances. If any ill-disposed person
went to him with a story, he generally gave it credit and, without
enquiry or investigation, acted upon it. The first impression,
right or wrong, with him was conclusive for the time, and the
unfortunate accused was instantly subjected to the effects of his
weak mind and ill-judged precipitation. But I must do Governor King
the justice to say that, after he had taken time to reflect on the
injury he had been induced to inflict, no man felt more acutely
sorrow and remorse for the act; but it is too late for a doctor to
prescribe comforting medicines, after he has by a violent dose
killed his patient.</p>

<p>Upon my return from Canterbury, Mrs. Cox and my wife met me at
the door; Mrs. Cox welcomed me most cordially, and brought me into
the parlour, where I found refreshments laid out of the best of
everything. Soon after, Mr. Cox came in, shook me by the hand, and
said to his wife, "Now, my dear, I shall be able to sleep
comfortably, having Mr. Holt at liberty, and back again in
safety."</p>

<p>I felt gratified at this expression of good-will, but I
nevertheless handed him the stock book from Canterbury, which he
refused to look at, saying, "I hope everything pleased you
there."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said I, "but I feel it my duty to show you the way
in which I have made up my books and managed your affairs, and I
wish also to give you an account of your stock."</p>

<p>He paused, and after a slight hesitation said, "Mr. Holt, since
you have had the management of my affairs I have never looked into
your books or accounts, but paid according to your handwriting,
with the most perfect confidence."</p>

<p>"I have felt that, sir," I replied, "but I thought the suspicion
and oppression I have been subjected to might have lowered me in
your estimation."</p>

<p>Mr. Cox promptly answered, "On the contrary, your absence has
made me feel your value, and as to my not going to see you, do not
let that annoy you; as I was sure you had nothing to do with the
conspiracy, so I knew you must get over it triumphantly, and I
wished you to do so without my interference. I have now a reason
for complaint to the Governor, and I will let him know my mind at
our next meeting. I will vindicate your character, and make him
compensate you for your sufferings."</p>

<p>He then filled his glass, and made me fill mine, and drank to me
in so friendly a manner, that every unpleasant feeling was removed
from my mind. My wife and I went home, and had scarcely got into
our house before the servant arrived with a basket, and a note from
Mrs. Cox; in the basket were two gallons of wine and two of rum,
which the good lady begged us to accept, to replenish our
stock.</p>

<p>I mustered my men next morning, and chose four of the best, viz.
Michael Cavanagh, Anthony Kearns, James Martin, and John Joyce, and
set them to burn off the timber of sixteen acres, to make the
ground ready for planting the December crop. At this time I had
eighty acres planted at Brush Farm, and twenty-four at Canterbury.
A small farm, of thirty acres, was now offered to me for purchase,
by Curtis Bryan, and I recommended Mr. Cox to buy it, as it
adjoined his estate, which he did for &pound;40, half money and
half property. I also purchased for him two others, one of
twenty-five acres, from Thomas Tilley, the other of fifty acres,
from Mr. Hume, for &pound;45; another of thirty acres, from Thomas
Higgins, for &pound;35; and another farm of one hundred acres, I
also purchased for Mr. Cox, from a Captain McKellar, a Scotchman,*
for &pound;50 and ten gallons of rum.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In the Army List for 1804, I find Niel
McKellar, a Lieutenant in the New South Wales corps; his
commission, as Lieutenant, dated 11th November, 1795.]</p>

<p>I likewise bought another farm of one hundred acres, from
Captain Campbell, for &pound;100; and of Dr. Thompson a farm of one
hundred acres, with 124 sheep, an old mare, two fillies and a colt,
a cow and a young ox, for &pound;500.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It appears that those who received grants of
land in New South Wales, were generally anxious to dispose of their
farms in order to enter into trade, chiefly the retailing of
spirits, by which rapid fortunes had been made. Mann states,
that:<br>
<br>
"The inferior officers of the settlement, and the non-commissioned
officers and privates of the regiment, have been infected with the
itch for dealing; and many of the settlers themselves have either
disposed of their farms, or deserted them, to obtain the means or
the leisure to devote themselves to a species of dealing which
never failed to turn to good account. Many who had also served
their terms of transportation, instead of remaining to aid the
public service, withdrew themselves from the stores, and turned
their thoughts to trade. The consequence of this universal
inclination to one object, and that of such an evil nature, being
chiefly confined to the sale of spirits, soon became obvious, in
the desertion of those farms which had been previously tilled with
so much advantage, and in the neglect of all duties, whether of a
public or private nature. The immense profits made by this pursuit
served as a new stimulus to its continuance. One dealer was known
to have cleared twelve hundred pounds sterling in four weeks, and
chiefly by the sale of spirits; and an inhabitant of the lowest
order, who commenced dealing with five pounds, has been known to
realise five hundred pounds in the course of six months."]</p>

<p>The stock, when valued, was considered worth twenty-five per
cent more than the purchase money, consequently the farm did not
stand Mr. Cox in sixpence. What made things even better, was that
Mr. Cox paid him with bills on the regimental agents.</p>

<p>The Doctor went away in a French ship, that was exploring, and
Mrs. Thompson deserted from him with a French officer, taking the
bills with her; they were never heard of more.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The French discovery, or as Holt calls it,
exploring ship, which Dr. Thompson joined, must have been one of
the corvettes sent out by Buonaparte for the purpose of surveying
Australia. <i>Le Geographe</i> and <i>le Naturaliste</i> sailed
from Havre on the 19th October, 1800; the expedition-visited Port
Jackson in June, 1802, and remained there until the following
November. M. Peron, the naturalist, published an account of this
voyage; entitled&mdash;"Voyage de D&eacute;couverte aux Terres
Australes, &amp;c." Paris. 1808. 4to. With an Atlas; and a
subsequent volume appeared in 1815. Speaking of the reception of
the French expedition at Port Jackson, Peron says, "Our numerous
sick were received into the government hospital, where the English
surgeons paid them all possible attention. Dr. Thompson, the chief
physician of the colony, directed the mode of treatment, with the
greatest tenderness; and whatever we were in need of that the place
could furnish, was put at our disposal. The Governor-general gave
us an unlimited credit on the public treasury, and our commodore
was furnished with royal printed cheques, to fill up with any sum
that he might wish for; and these cheques, without any other
security than the signature of the French commandant, were accepted
by the inhabitants, with a confidence highly honourable to the
government of the country. Our salt provisions, spirits, and
biscuits were exhausted; but by means of these cheques we obtained
fresh supplies; and several times the magazines of the colony were
opened to supply us with articles which our agents could not
procure. Thus, by this generous relief, we were enabled to reclothe
our crews, who were in want of everything; repair our ships;
purchase one, instead of that we had lost; and be completely
prepared for continuing our voyage.<br>
<br>
"At the same time, our scientific researches met with every
encouragement; a guard of English soldiers was appointed expressly
to protect our observatory, which we placed on the north point of
the eastern bank of Sydney Cove. The whole country was open to the
excursions of our naturalists, and we were even permitted to wear
our arms, as were the persons of our suite; while guides and
interpreters were furnished us for our longer journeys. In short,
the English government behaved to us with such generosity, that
they acquired our warmest gratitude.<br>
<br>
"The principal object of our stay at Port Jackson," continues M.
Peron, "was that we might devote proper attention to every part of
the surrounding country. While our crews were repairing the damages
the ships had sustained, and getting in fresh supplies of
provisions, the naturalists extended their researches to every
branch of the physical history of this, interesting country."<br>
<br>
What a contrast is here exhibited to the treatment which Captain
Flinders experienced!]</p>

<p>Thus I made a good bargain for Mr. Cox, clearing for him above
&pound;1000 in one year, by these purchases.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[1801]</p>

<p>The next year, I bought John Ramsay's farm, of seventy-five
acres, for &pound;60, and then Michael Fitzgerald's, with eight
large pigs, and eighty bushels of maize, for &pound;100. I let the
farm in ten days after for &pound;40 a year. I then purchased
Barrington's farm, of twenty-five acres, an old brood mare with a
colt at her foot, for &pound;100, and sold the mare in four days
after, for &pound;85. I then bought fifty acres from Edward
Elliot,* for &pound;40, and by these means squared the estate, and
removed the lurchers to a distance from it. A lurcher is a degree
lower than a thief, as a thief is lower than a robber. I had no
desire for robbers in my neighbourhood, having forty-five convicts
under my care at the stores, and had to give them the same rations
and clothing as the government allowed. I had also twenty-five
freemen employed, making a total of seventy men, and it required
all my energies in full play to keep them in proper order.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Elliot is thus particularly noticed by
Captain Collins.&mdash;"One man, a settler at the Eastern Farms,
Edward Elliot, had received a ewe sheep from the late Governor
Phillip, before his departure in the year 1792. He had resisted
many temptations to sell it, and at the time this enquiry took
place was found possessing a stock of two-and-twenty sheep, males
and females. He had been fortunate in not meeting with any loss,
but had not added to his stock by any purchase. This was a proof
that industry did not go without its reward in this country."]</p>

<p>My freemen I always employed by the piece, and whenever I had
anything to do, I drew up an agreement, specifying every
particular, so that nothing remained but to see that the work was
done according to agreement. The mode of payment was also
specified, so that there could be no mistake or grumbling. As to
the convicts, there was a certain quantity of work, which, by the
government regulations they must do in a given time, and this may
be given to them by the day, week, or month, as you pleased, and
they must be paid a certain price for all the work they did beyond
the stipulated quantity.</p>

<p>If they were idle, and did not do the regulated quantity of
work, it was only necessary to take them before a magistrate, and
he would order them twenty-five lashes of the cat on their backs,
for the first offence, fifty for the second, and so on; and if that
would not do, they were at last put into a gaol gang, and made to
work in irons from morning till night.</p>

<p>In order to keep them honest, I paid them fully and fairly for
everything they did beyond their stipulated task, at the same rate
I paid the freemen, and, if I thought the rations not sufficient
for their comfortable support, I issued to each man six pounds of
wheat, fourteen of potatoes, and one of pork, in addition. By this
means the men were well fed; for the old saying is true, that
"Hunger will break through stone walls;" and it is all nonsense to
make laws for starving men. When any article was stolen from me, I
instantly paraded all hands, and told them that "if it was not
restored in a given time, I would stop all extra allowances and
indulgences; the thief," said I, "is a disgrace to the
establishment, and all employed in it, let the honest men find him
out, and punish him among yourselves, do not let it be said that
the flogger ever polluted this place by his presence. You all know
the advantages you enjoy above gangs on any other estate in the
colony, do not then throw them away. Do not let me know who the
thief is, but punish him by your own verdict." I then dismissed
them.</p>

<p>The transports would say amongst themselves that what I had told
them was all right. "We won't," they would reason, "be punished
because there happens to be an ungrateful thief among us." They
then called a jury, and entered into an investigation, and, on all
occasions, succeeded in detecting and punishing the offender. I was
by this line of conduct secure from plunder; and the disgusting
operation of flaying a man alive, with a cat-o'-nine-tails, did not
disgrace the farms under my superintendence. Mr. Cox one day said
to me, "Pray, Joseph, how is it that you never have to bring your
men to punishment? You have more under you, than I believe any man
in the colony, and, to the surprise of all, you have never had one
flogged, or indeed have made a complaint against one; they look
well, and appear contented, and even happy."&mdash;"Sir," said I,
"I have studied human nature more than books. I had the management
of many more men in my own country, and I was always rigidly just
to them. I never oppressed them, or suffered them to cheat their
employers or each other. They knew, if they did their duty they
would be well treated, and if not, sent to the right about. I
follow the same course with the men here. I have taught them the
advantages they derive from good conduct, and I make them punish an
offender themselves; therefore, if any depredation be committed on
your property, they are told that all allowances and indulgences
will be stopped, until whatever is missing be restored. The crime,
therefore, becomes one against themselves, and they have better
means of detecting it than I have. They call a jury, convict and
punish the offender. I should think myself very ill qualified to
act as your agent and overseer, were I to have a man or two flogged
every week. Besides the horrible inhumanity of this practice, the
loss of a man's week or fortnight's work will not be a trifle in a
year, at twelve and sixpence per week, for a man who gets the cat
is incapable of work till his back is well; so in prudence, as well
as in Christian charity, it is best to treat our fellow-creatures
like men, although they be degraded to the state of convict slaves.
They will, moreover, when properly treated, be sensible of
kindness, and find that they better themselves by behaving well.
But, as you ask me, I will show you my private flogger." I then
went to an outhouse, and brought Mr. Cox two hoes, one which
weighed three pounds and a half, the other seven. He took the
lightest in his hand, and said it was a very good one. I then
handed him the seven pound hoe, which he took into his hand, and,
after a time, said, "This is a terrible tool."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said I, "there is my punishment, the man who
misbehaves knows he will get the <i>seven pounder</i>, and I have
great satisfaction in saying it has been used but once, and then
only for a short time.</p>

<p>"The greater number of overseers in the colony," I continued,
"have been criminals themselves, and have neither prudence, honesty
or humanity; they are ruffian's, who are actuated and influenced by
the worst passions, and frequently flog an unfortunate wretch for
complaining of their oppression. No man could insult me by saying,
'I am as good as you, for you were a thief, and I am no worse!'
Believe me, sir, thieves never make good masters, or use power with
moderation or humanity."</p>

<p>Mr. Cox said, "Joseph, you ought to have been a lawyer, it is a
pity you were not brought up to the bar."</p>

<p>I answered, there was no occasion for his wishes, as, under
Governor King, I had already become acquainted with the bar more
intimately than was agreeable to me; "and moreover," said I, "were
I made a judge, I myself might sometimes have to hang the innocent
and acquit the guilty. I am much better qualified for the station I
hold, and I hope, sir, that you esteem me as good a servant, as I
consider you an excellent master."</p>

<p>While we were in conversation, a black man, named-John Randall,
passed by the window. Mr. Cox asked me who he was, and said, "Go
and learn what he wants." Randall told me that he wished to dispose
of his farm, and would sell it cheap, if I would promise to get him
into the choir. I told him I was busy at the moment, but would talk
to him about the matter next day. This man had been sportsman to
Governor Grose. His farm was about a mile and three quarters from
Mr. Cox's estate; and I recommended Mr. Cox to purchase it. Mr. Cox
looked at me for some time, as if hesitating, but at length, to my
surprise, he said, "Holt, if you like the farm, why not buy it for
yourself? I am sure I can get him into the choir, and it is time
you should be doing something for yourself and your own
family."</p>

<p>I answered, "Sir, I may not have as much money coming to me as
will pay for it."</p>

<p>He replied, "If you buy as cheap for yourself as you have done
for me, it will not cost you much, and I will advance for you as
far as &pound;500, if you get good value for your money," Then,
looking at me very earnestly, Mr. Cox added, "Holt, I know
you."</p>

<p>I answered, "I was very glad he did, and that it gave me great
pleasure." We then took more wine and water; he was a good soul
over his glass.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>A Man of Property</h2>

<p>The next day Randall came, and I went with him to view the farm;
it was very well circumstanced, and convenient for me, being so
near Mr. Cox's estate, and, as I hoped to continue with that
gentleman, I considered it very eligible.</p>

<p>I asked the price; Randall said &pound;60, and to engage to get
him into the choir. I told him that was more than I could do at
present; but I would give him forty pounds if I could get him into
the choir, and fifty if I could not do it; and if he came with me
he should have my letter to Colonel Paterson.</p>

<p>This black was a well-made fellow, about six feet high, and a
good musician on the flute and tambourine. I wrote to Colonel
Paterson in as polite a manner as I was able, and sent it by
<i>Blackee</i>. The Colonel returned me a very civil answer, to the
effect that he would do what he could to accomplish my wishes, and
would, if fit, take him into the choir, on my recommendation. We
then went to Mr. Cox, and he gave directions to have the deed of
conveyance prepared against ten o'clock the next day. It was made
out to my wife, Hester Holt, and her heirs; for although I had no
indent against me, there might, nevertheless, be a legal question
raised hereafter, about my capability to purchase.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[10 November 1801]</p>

<p>The deed was dated the 10th November, in the forty-first year of
the reign of His Majesty King George the Third, the money paid
down, and the writing witnessed by William Cox, Rebecca Cox, and
James King. This conveyance I have now in my possession at
Dunleary.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[1802]</p>

<p>I went down to Canterbury to arrange the business there, having
now very extensive concerns under my control. There were two
sawyers, three carpenters, two stone-cutters, twenty labourers, and
three shepherds at Canterbury, besides the concern at Brush Farm.
The whole number was 110 men, to supply with their provisions, to
apportion their work, and to pay every week; sometimes the weekly
bill amounted to &pound;150. My labour was very great; I had to
keep my accounts at night, and I found this, with my constant
exertion during the day, almost too much for me. It was not
necessary for me to tell Mr. Cox so; he saw the necessity I had for
assistance, and he asked me what I would charge for my son.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "the boy is a smart lad, but I will not fix his
value. Try him; put a gang of twenty men under him, and let him be
placed at a distance from me; if he has abilities to manage them,
and execute your commands properly, you may judge then of his
value."</p>

<p>Mr. Cox did as I suggested, and at the end of a month he met me,
and I asked him what he thought of his young steward? He answered
he was perfectly satisfied with him, and would give him &pound;60 a
year, and he put a memorandum in writing into my hand, to this
effect&mdash;"<i>I will give Joshua Holt sixty pounds a year.</i>"
So I had now &pound;160 a year, besides other advantages. I had
also more time to ride over the country, to buy and sell. My son
was but just turned of thirteen years of age at this time.</p>

<p>As I was riding through Parramatta, I met a man, named Thomas
Bray, who asked me into his house, and, as usual, placed the rum
bottle before me. He then told me he intended to leave the colony,
and wished me to buy 300 bushels of wheat, and 60 acres of land. He
asked &pound;60 for the land, and 6<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per bushel
for the wheat. I told him I would let him know. I then went to Mr.
Cox, and laid the business before him. He instantly desired me to
close the bargain. But I bought the wheat for him at six shillings
the bushel, and the land for fifty pounds; and both parties were
well satisfied, and Bray made me a present....*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A long passage here is very carefully
obliterated in Holt's original manuscript; from the few words which
can be deciphered, it appears to relate to Bray's present, and some
subsequent dealings between him and Holt, but it is impossible
satisfactorily to make out the particulars.]</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Observations on the Aborigines</h2>
Chapter 8.

<p>I will now attempt an account of the native inhabitants of this
country, their manners and laws, which they have apparently by the
instinct of nature. When first I went to the country, I was invited
to dine by Lieutenant Cummings,* of the Botany Bay corps, a man
well acquainted with the natives, and who, being fond of sport,
used to go out to hunt the kangaroo, which brought him in contact
with the natives.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Lieutenant William Cummings. His commission
as Lieutenant in the New South Wales corps was dated 25th June,
1793, and he appears to have left the service in 1800. On the 31st
December, 1792, Collins records that a grant of twenty-five acres
of land was made to Ensign Cummings, of the New South Wales corps,
and he adds&mdash;"In the instructions for granting lands in this
country no mention of officers had yet been made; it was, however,
fairly presumed that the officers could not be intended to be
precluded from the participation of any advantages which the Crown
might have to bestow in the settlements; particularly as the
greatest in its gift, the free possession of land, was held out to
people who had forfeited their lives before they came into the
colony."<br>
<br>
In October, 1793, a settler named Charles Williams, "sold his farm,
with the house, crop and stock, for something less than one hundred
pounds, to Lieutenant Cummings, to whose allotment of twenty-five
acres Williams's ground was contiguous." Collins also relates of
Lieutenant Cummings that, in March, 1795, he made an excursion, to
examine the country to the southward of Botany Bay, and that, in
his intercourse with the natives, he obtained information which led
him to believe that the cattle which had been lost soon after the
first arrival of the colonizers of New South Wales, were in
existence; and which proved to be the case. Holt subsequently
mentions Mr. Cummings as engaged in illicit distillation, and
attributes to him information given to the authorities against Holt
for the same practice.]</p>

<p>He [Cummings] was an Irishman, and the day I dined with him
about fifty natives collected round his house. They are very
inquisitive, and said to me, "Name you? you are Miel."* That is to
say, "You are a stranger, what is your name?" Mr. Cummings told
them I was his brother, and I passed by that name ever after.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Mi-yal&mdash;a stranger. Collins states,
that "this word has reference to sight; Mi, the eye." A collection
of words used by the natives in various parts of the coast of
Australia and Van Diemen's land, was made by Captain P. P. King, of
the Royal Navy, for the purpose of showing the great dissimilarity
that exists in the languages of the several tribes; "and it may be
remarked," observes that scientific officer, "that of thirty-three
objects, one only, <i>the eye</i>, is expressed by nearly the same
term at each place."]</p>

<p>The chief, or king of this tribe, was called Bennelong,* that is
to say, their "king for a long time." Every tribe has its chief,
who makes laws, hears trials, and acts as judge.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Bennelong, of whom Collins has preserved a
portrait, is certainly the most distinguished Australian chieftain
in the English annals of that continent: his history is curious, as
exhibiting the difficulty which exists in civilizing a savage.<br>
<br>
The Goat Island (called by the natives Me-mil), close to Sydney
Cove, was said to be the property of Bennelong's father. "On our
settling there," says Barrington, "he called it his, and took great
pleasure in being there with his wife."<br>
<br>
Bennelong was taken, with another native, in November 1789, and
detained by Governor Phillip, with the view of facilitating,
through their communication, a friendly intercourse between the
colonists and the natives; Bennelong's companion escaped a few days
after, and he followed the example in the ensuing May. Nothing was
heard of him until September, when Bennelong sent the Governor, by
Mr. White, who had fallen in with him not far from Sydney, a
present of a piece of whale, which was then lying on the beach.
Anxious to see him again, the Governor, after taking some arms from
the party at the Look-out, as he heard the Cove was full of
natives, proceeded to where the whale was lying, and which they had
assembled to feast upon. Here he found not only Bennelong, but his
former companion in captivity, Cole-be.<br>
<br>
Bennelong appeared much altered; he expressed his pleasure at
seeing the Governor again, as well as some of the officers by whom
he was accompanied, and a few articles were given to him and his
company; but the Governor observing that the natives were
assembling round his small party, and fearing treachery, was about
to withdraw to his boat, when "Bennelong, who had presented to him
several natives by name, pointed out one, whom the Governor
thinking to take particular notice of, stepped forward to meet,
holding out both his hands towards him. The savage, not
understanding this civility, and perhaps thinking that he was going
to seize him as a prisoner, lifted a spear from the grass with his
foot, and, fixing it on his throwing stick, in an instant darted it
at the Governor. The spear entered a little above the collar-bone,
and bad been discharged with such force, that the barb of it came
through on the other side." Governor Phillip, however, recovered in
about a fortnight, and as the accident appears to have arisen from
misunderstanding, and not from any hostile feeling, the intercourse
was soon resumed with Bennelong, who said he had beaten
Wil-le-me-rig, the man who threw the spear, and who, according to
Bennelong's statement, was only actuated by fears for his personal
safety. On the 8th October (1790) Bennelong visited the Governor,
and after repeating his visit, "solicited the Governor to build him
a hut at the extremity of the eastern point of the Cove. This,"
continues Collins, "the Governor, who was very desirous of
preserving the friendly intercourse which seemed to have taken
place, readily promised, and gave the necessary directions for its
being built."<br>
<br>
When Governor Phillip embarked for England, in Dec. 1792,
Bennelong, and another native named Yem-mer-ra-wan-nie, volunteered
to accompany him, notwithstanding the distress of their wives, and
the dismal lamentations of their friends. They arrived in England
with the Governor, on the 21st May, 1794, but they soon desired to
return to their own country, preferring the woods of New South
Wales to the houses of London.<br>
<br>
On the return of Bennelong to Sydney, with Governor Hunter, in
September 1795, "he conducted himself," says Collins, "with a
polished familiarity towards his sisters and other relations; but
to his acquaintance he was distant, and quite the man of
consequence. He declared, in a tone and with an air that seemed to
expect compliance, that he should no longer suffer them to fight,
and cut each other's throats, as they had done; that he should
introduce peace among them, and make them love each other. He
expressed his wish, that when they visited him at the Government
House they would contrive to be somewhat more cleanly in their
persons, and less coarse in their manners; and he seemed absolutely
offended at some little indelicacies which he observed in his
sister, Car-rang-ar-rang, who came in such haste from Botany Bay,
with a little nephew on her back, to visit him, that she left all
her habiliments behind her.<br>
<br>
"Bennelong had certainly not been an inattentive observer of the
manners of the people among whom he had lived; he conducted himself
with the greatest propriety at table, particularly in the
observance of those attentions which are chiefly requisite in the
presence of women. His dress appeared to be an object of no small
concern with him; and every one who knew him before he left the
country, and who saw him now, pronounced, without hesitation, that
Bennelong had not any desire to renounce the habits and comforts of
the civilized life which he appeared so readily and so successfully
to adopt.<br>
<br>
"His inquiries were directed, immediately on his arrival, after his
wife, Go-roo-bar-roo-bool-lo; and her he found with Caruey. On
producing a very fashionable rose-coloured petticoat and jacket,
made of a coarse stuff, accompanied by a gypsy bonnet of the same
colour, she deserted her lover, and followed her former husband. In
a few days, however, to the surprise of every one, we saw the lady
walking unencumbered with clothing of any kind, and Bennelong was
missing. Caruey was sought for, and we heard that he had been
severely beaten by Bennelong, at Rose bay, who retained so much of
our customs that he made use of his fists, instead of the weapons
of his country, to the great annoyance of Caruey, who would have
preferred meeting his rival fairly in the field, armed with the
spear and club. Caruey being much the younger man, the lady, every
inch a woman, followed her inclination, and Bennelong was compelled
to yield her without any further opposition. He seemed to have been
satisfied with the beating he had given Caruey, and hinted that,
resting for the present without a wife, he should look about him,
and at some future period make a better choice.<br>
<br>
"His absences from the Governor's house now became frequent, and
little attended to. When he went out, lie usually left his clothes
behind, resuming them carefully on his return, before he made his
visit to the Governor."<br>
<br>
"About this time," continues Collins [March, 1796], "Bennelong, who
occasionally shook off the habits of civilized life, and went for a
few days into the woods, with his sisters and other friends, sent
in word that he had had a contest with his bosom friend, Cole-be,
in which he had been so much the sufferer, that until his wounds
were healed he could not, with any pleasure to himself,.appear at
the Governor's table. This notification Was accompanied with a
request, that his clothes, which he had left behind him when he
went away, might be sent, together with some victuals, of which he
was much in want.<br>
<br>
"On his coming among us again, he appeared with a wound on his
mouth, which had divided the upper lip, and broke two of the teeth
of that jaw. His features, never very pleasing, now seemed out of
all proportion, and his pronunciation was much altered. Finding
himself badly received among the females (although improved by his
travels in the little attentions that are supposed to have their
weight with the sex), and not being able to endure a life of
celibacy, which had been his condition from the day of his
departure from this country until nearly the present hour, he made
an attack upon his friend's favourite, Boo-re-a, in which he was
not only unsuccessful, but was punished for his breach of
friendship as above related, by Cole-be, who sarcastically asked
him 'if he meant that kind of conduct to be a specimen of English
manners?'"<br>
<br>
Mann, in 1809, thus writes of Bennelong,&mdash;"Notwithstanding so
much pains had been taken for his improvement, both when separated
from his countrymen and since his return to New South Wales, he has
subsequently taken to the woods again, and returned to his old
habits; and now lives in the same manner as those who have never
mixed with the civilized world. Sometimes, indeed, he holds
intercourse with the colony; but every effort uniformly fails to
draw him once again into the circle of polished society, since he
prefers to taste of liberty amongst his native scenes, to the
unsatisfactory gratification which arises from an association with
strangers, however kind their treatment of him, and however
superior to his own enjoyments."]</p>

<p>They have no idea of God, or a Divinity of any kind, worship or
religion. They say, however, that there is a <i>murry</i> devil, of
whom they are very much afraid, and think he is in the habit of
playing ugly practical jokes and tricks upon them. They consider
him a cowardly rascal, and much afraid of fire; that the mischief
he does is always by stealth; and therefore when they build their
huts they place them in two straight lines opposite to each other,
and light fires at both ends, as well to alarm the devil, as that
they may see him when he approaches. They are very cowardly in the
dark, like the feeble-minded people in Ireland, and perhaps
everywhere.</p>

<p>They couple very early, and the marriage is settled by the old
ones; the young female is taken home to the parents of the male in
early infancy, and they are kept together until they are
marriageable, when a ceremony takes place, which, however, I must
decline relating. They go perfectly naked, and have no idea
whatever of shame on that account. There is no use in giving them
clothes or covering, as they do not require any, except in the
nights of July and August, which are the coldest in the year. I
have known ladies dress up the Gins (their name for a woman) of the
chiefs in European finery; they were very proud, and admired
themselves at first and for a short time, very much. But after
wearing the clothes for a day or two, they would throw them off. I
have frequently had a hundred of both males and females in the
farm-yard at a time, and it was my custom to take in the chief and
his Gin, and give them their breakfast and a glass of grog. I then
told them not to meddle with my corn or melons, for if they did, I
should be <i>murry</i> (very) angry with him.</p>

<p>He said "<i>Bail bail</i>," that is, never fear.</p>

<p>The chief then went out, and set up a shout, when all his
company came round him, and he gave the order, to which they were
as obedient as any party of soldiers I ever saw. He then held up
his hand, saying, "<i>Murry, Tat, Tat</i>" and pointing in a
certain direction, he would acquaint them where the next camp was
to be formed, and that they must not touch any thing belonging to
the master here, or that he would "<i>Murry pialla</i>" them, that
is, spear them to death. They then ordered their gins to go catch
"<i>mogra</i>" that is, fish, for the mistress.</p>

<p>The gins do all the drudgery for their husbands. They fish,
carry the provisions, corn, potatoes, bandycoots, and guannas. The
latter is an animal like a lizard, about four feet long, with four
short legs, and on its feet are extremely sharp claws; so sharp as
to enable it to run up the smoothest tree with great ease. It lays
four eggs about the size of a turkey's, with a bluish shell like a
duck's. Its head is very like a snake's, and when alarmed it
thrusts out its three-forked tongue in the same manner as snakes
do. I believe they are perfectly harmless, but their appearance to
me was very disgusting. They are great destroyers of poultry and
eggs. Their flesh, I am told, is very like that of a fowl. I had
several Englishmen with me, who used to eat them as well as snakes,
and they assured me, that the soup they made of both was of a very
fine flavour.</p>

<p>The gins carry everything they make use of, as well as their
children, or pickaninnies.</p>

<p>The names used by the natives for Father, is Ogibbrage.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* All the vocabularies that I have seen of the
language of the Natives of New South Wales, give Be-an-na
(shortened to Be-an and Be-a) as the word implying father. It was
the name bestowed by the natives on governor Hunter.]</p>

<p>Mother, <i>poisauna</i>.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Wy-an-na, and Wy-ang, are the words given by
Collins as meaning mother.]</p>

<p><i>Cobawn</i>, is big.</p>

<p><i>Patta</i>, eating.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Patta, is probably the verb to eat rather
than its participle. Collins has preserved the following inflexions
of the word. Pat-ta-diow, I have eaten. Pat-tt&aacute;-die-mi, you
have eaten. Pat-ty, he has eaten. Pat-ta-bow, I will eat.
Pat-t&aacute;-bow-me, you will eat; or will you eat? Pat-ta-ne,
they eat.]</p>

<p><i>Murry gunrin</i>, much afraid.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Mur-ray, great. According to the vocabulary
given by Collins, Bar-gat means afraid, or frightened.]</p>

<p><i>Pialla</i>, spearing man.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Collins explains the native word Bil-lar,
(between which and Pialla, it is not difficult to fancy the
identity) by "A spear with one barb cut from the wood."]</p>

<p><i>Murry boogare</i>, very good.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Bood-ger-re.&mdash;Collins.]</p>

<p><i>Murry wiren</i>, very bad.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Wee-re.&mdash;Collins.<br>
"That they," (the natives) observes Barrington; "well know the
difference between right and wrong, as far as concerns this world,
is evident, for if anybody does them an injury they exclaim Wee-re,
(bad); but if any person does them a service, Bood-jer-re,
(good)."]</p>

<p><i>Murry gama</i>, much offended.</p>

<p><i>Apatta</i>, eating.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* See observations on the previous word
Patta.]</p>

<p>I picked up these few words in my intercourse with them.</p>

<p>These people are very expert fishers; the gins use the line and
hook very skilfully, and the men, with a wooden spear of four
barbs, similar to our salmon spear in Ireland, and pointed with the
teeth of the kangaroo, strike large fish at the depth of a fathom,
with great dexterity.* These prongs or barbs are fastened into the
spear by a gum, which is got from one of the trees, and it fixes
the barbs very firmly. The natives have nets in which they carry
burdens, and also use for fishing. These nets are made of the
fibrous bark of a tree, by the women, who likewise manufacture the
fishing-lines. In their wandering life the gins transport
everything; the men carry nothing but their implements of war,
which I will endeavour to describe. Every man has a hielaman** or
shield, of an oval form, made of the bark of a tree, with a handle
behind it; with this in his left hand he parries the thrust of a
spear. Their spear is about eight feet long, the handle is made of
the grass tree, with a splice of about twenty inches at the end, of
iron-wood, fastened with the gum before mentioned, which holds it
so firmly that I have often tried to separate them but was unable;
there is a barb on each side of the point. This makes the wound it
inflicts very dangerous. These they call their death-spears, for
few survive if once wounded by one of them.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "The natives on the sea coast are those with
whom we happen to be most acquainted. Fish is their chief support.
Men, women, and children, are employed in procuring them; but the
means used are different according to the sex; the males always
killing them with the Fiz-gig, while the females use the hook and
line. The fiz-gig is made of the wattle; has a joint in it,
fastened by gum; is from fifteen to twenty feet in length, and
armed with four barbed prongs; the barb being a piece of bone
secured by gum. To each of these prongs they gave a particular
name; but I never could discover any sensible reason for the
distinction. The lines used by the women, are made by themselves,
of the bade of a small tree which they find in the neighbourhood.
Their hooks are made of the mother-of-pearl oyster, which they rub
on a stone until it assumes the shape they want. It must be
remarked that these hooks are not barbed; they nevertheless catch
fish with them with the greatest facility." <i>Collins's New South
Wales</i>. Appendix, No. iv.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[** E-lee-mong, a shield made of
bark.&mdash;<i>Collins</i>.]</p>

<p>They have another kind of spear which is not barbed, and much
lighter than the one described, which they throw with great
accuracy, and often transfix with it large birds on the wing, and
drive it through an animal on a tree one hundred feet high, or a
man, at an incredible distance; so great, that I am apprehensive of
being thought to draw a long bow, were I to state it.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Mann, in his "Picture of New South Wales,"
says, "They, (the natives) are amazingly expert at throwing the
spear, and will launch it, with unerring aim, to a distance of
thirty to sixty yards. I myself have seen a lad hurl his spear at a
hawk-eagle (a bird, which with wings expanded, measures from seven
to ten feet), flying in the air, with such velocity and
correctness, as to pierce his object, and bring the feathered
victim to the earth."]</p>

<p>Their manner of warfare is very singular; it has more the
appearance of a ceremony than enmity, as among other people. Once a
year, the tribes living in the neighbourhood of Sydney, and Field
of Mars, Northern boundary, and George's River-Cabramatta, all
join; Cow Pasture, plains of Hawkesbury, Broken Bay, and the Seven
Hills. The warriors are summoned by messengers from the opposing
party. These messengers have a hole made in the gristle of their
noses when young, and kept open till it heals; through this they
pass a wooden skewer, which is their token of war.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "As a principal ornament the men, on
particular occasions, thrust a bone or reed through the <i>septum
nasi</i>, the hole through which is bored when they are young. Some
boys who went away from us for a few days, returned dignified with
this strange ornament, having, in the mean time, the operation
performed upon them; they appeared to be from twelve to fifteen
years of age. The bone that they wear is the small bone in the leg
of the kangaroo, one end of which is sharpened to a point. I have
seen several women who had their noses perforated in this
extraordinary manner. "<i>Collins's New South Wales</i>. Appendix,
No. ii.<br>
<br>
"Between the ages of eight and sixteen, the males and females
undergo the operation whiqli they term Gnah-noong, viz. that of
having the <i>septum nasi</i> bored to receive a bone or reed,
which among them is deemed a great ornament, though I have seen
many whose articulation was thereby rendered very imperfect."
<i>Ibid</i>. Appendix, No. vi.]</p>

<p>Having smeared their bodies with a kind of red ocherous earth,
they get a sort of white clay and draw fantastic figures upon their
bodies; sometimes imitating the European dress, with buttons and
button holes, and embroidery like the jackets of a hussar.* Thus
fitted out with these emblems of war, they sally forth and pass
through the tribes, who are by them summoned to appear, fully
armed, in twenty-one days. The contending parties then remain
encamped six days before they give battle, which is always on a
fixed day, so that they have a pitched battle.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "On particular occasions they ornament
themselves with red and white clay, using the former when preparing
to fight, the latter for the more peaceful amusement of dancing.
The fashion of these ornaments was left to each person's taste; and
some, when decorated in their best manner, looked perfectly
horrible. Nothing could appear more terrible than a black and
dismal face, with a large white circle drawn round each eye. In
general, waved lines were marked down each arm, thigh, and leg; and
in some the cheeks were daubed; and lines drawn over each rib,
presented to the beholder a truly spectre-like figure. Previous
either to a dance or a combat, we always found them busily employed
in this necessary preliminary; and it must be observed, that when
other liquid could not be readily procured, they moistened the clay
with their own saliva." <i>Collins's New South Wales</i>. Appendix,
No. ii.]</p>

<p>The chiefs or officers lay out the ground, and mark their lines
with great accuracy, about fifty perches apart, perfectly straight,
opposite each other; the opposing parties walking about, apparently
in the most friendly way, during all this period of preparation, as
if they were on the best of terms. The Caragees* or doctors get
their attendants ready to take care of the wounded, to carry whom
from the field several strong men are in readiness. When all these
matters are arranged, the chiefs or generals call their men to
arms, and form them into line, which is done with great alertness.
There are about four hundred men on each side; and every one has
his spear ready to throw. They have a little stick about thirty
inches long, with a little pivot fixed in the back part of it, and
there is a small corresponding hole in the end of their spears,
which they hold up in the same manner that soldiers shoulder their
muskets; a shout is then given from each side by the leaders, which
is followed by two others, and on the third a discharge of the
spears takes place.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Collins renders this word Car-rah-dy. He
says (Appendix, No. vii.) "I think I may term the Car-rah-dy, their
high-priest of superstition."]</p>

<p>Each man watches their flight and receives the weapon upon his
shield, throwing the spear, thus parried, back to his adversary;*
and in the next moment he has another spear ready for action at the
word of command.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Speaking of a similar native contest,
Collins says, "Some of the spears which were thrown at them they
returned with extraordinary violence." "The most unaccountable
trait in this business was, the party thrown at providing his enemy
with weapons; for they have been repeatedly seen, when a spear has
flown harmless beyond them, to pick it up and fling it carelessly
back to their adversary. This might proceed from contempt, or from
there being a scarcity of spears; and I have thought that when
instead of flinging it carelessly back, they have thrown it with
much violence, it was because it had been thrown at them with a
greater degree of malevolence than the others. This rigid attention
to the point of honour, when fairly opposed to each other, is
difficult to reconcile with their treacherous and midnight
murders."]</p>

<p>The gins stand in the rear, and pick up the spears thrown by the
enemy. After every discharge the opposing parties each advance
about twenty yards, which soon brings the combatants to close
quarters.]</p>

<p>When they come within about forty paces, they throw by their
spears, and take a weapon called a <i>Nulanula</i>,* which is a
kind of battle-axe made of very hard wood; the head is round, and
resembles a plate, sharp-edged, but thickest in the middle, with a
handle like the hand-staff of a flail; it is a very powerful
weapon.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Although Collins has collected a list of the
names given by the natives of New South Wales to no less than
twenty-six varieties of spears, clubs and other implements of war,
no name bearing any resemblance to Nulanula is to be found
therein.]</p>

<p>With this they cut at each other about six or seven blows, when
another shout is given, and the gins present to each warrior a
stick three feet long, which they call a Waddy.* It is about as
thick as a shovel-handle, and very nearly as heavy as iron. Each
warrior then holds, in turn, his head for his adversary to strike
at with this waddy; and if the skull is broken by the blow, and the
man killed, the matter ends here; but if the person struck
fortunately escapes the blow, the striker must submit to the same
ceremony.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Woo-dah, according to Collins.]</p>

<p>The chiefs are merely spectators during this murderous
amusement, and when they think proper, they order, by another
shout, a charge of tomahawks, or small hatchets about three inches
broad in the blade, and as sharp as a carpenter's chisel. With
these they all cut away, splitting skulls, cutting off noses and
arms in the most fearful manner, until another shout is given by
the chiefs, when the slaughter ceases.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Extraordinary and unreasonable as this
account of the ceremony of a native contest may appear, Holt seems
to be fully borne out in his statement by Captain Collins's
relations; he says:&mdash;"The natives who lived about Sydney
appeared to place the utmost confidence in us, choosing a clear
spot between the town and the brick-fields for the performance of
any of their rites or ceremonies; and for three evenings the town
had been amused with one of their spectacles, which might properly
have been denominated a tragedy, for it was attended with a great
effusion of blood. It appeared from the best accounts we could
procure, that one or more murders having been committed in the
night, the assassins, who were immediately known, were compelled,
according to the custom of the country, to meet the relations of
the deceased, who were to avenge his death by throwing spears, and
drawing blood for blood.!" After detailing the manner in which a
native stood for three days to have spears thrown at him, Collins
proceeds thus:&mdash; "The business was resumed when they had
repaired their weapons, and the fray appeared to be general, men,
women, and children mingling in it, giving and receiving many
severe wounds, before night put an end to their warfare. What
rendered this sort of contest as unaccountable as it was
extraordinary, was, that friendship and alliance were known to
subsist between several that were opposed to each other, who fought
with all the ardour of the bitterest enemies, and who, though
wounded, pronounced the party by whom they had been hurt to be good
and brave, and their friends."<br>
<br>
Captain Collins, in the Appendix No. vi. to his work,
says:&mdash;We had been told for some days of their (the natives)
making great preparations for a fight, and gladly heard that they
had chosen a clear spot near the town for the purpose. The
contending parties consisted of most of our Sydney acquaintance,
and some natives from the South shore of Botany Bay. We repaired to
the spot an hour before sunset, and found them seated opposite to
each other on a level piece of ground between two hills. As a
prelude to the business, we observed our friends, after having
waited some time, stand up, and each man stooping down, take water
in the hollow of his band, (the place just before them being wet,)
which he drank. An elderly woman, with a cloak on her shoulders,
(made of opossum skins, and neatly sewn together,) and provided
with a club, then advanced from the opposite side, and uttering
much abusive language at the time, ran up to Cole-be, who was on
the Tight, and gave him what I should have considered a severe blow
on the head, which, with seeming contempt, he held out to her for
the purpose. She went through the same ceremony with the rest, who
made no resistance, until she came up to Ye-ra-ni-be, a very fine
boy, who stood on the left. He not admiring the blows that his
companions received, which were followed by blood, struggled with
her, and had he not been very active, I believe she would have
stabbed him with his own spear, which she wrested from him. The men
now advanced, and gave us many opportunities of witnessing the
strength and dexterity with which they threw their spears, and the
quickness of sight which was requisite to guard against them. The
contest lasted until dark, when throwing the spear could no longer
be accounted fair, and they then beat each other with clubs, until
they left off by mutual consent. In this part of the contest many
severe wounds were given, and much blood was drawn from the heads
of each party; but nothing material happened while they had light
enough to guard against the spear."]</p>

<p>I could compare the mutilations of the human frame in this
savage warfare to nothing that I had ever seen, except the
proceedings of the Ancient Britons at Newtown Mount Kennedy, on
Easter Tuesday in the year 1798; they mutilated the bodies of all
those who happened to have any green in their dresses. I was
witness to the conduct of these cruel barbarians in a Christian
country, which was not exceeded by the savages of New South
Wales.</p>

<p>The gins who were in the rear now advanced to the relief of the
wounded, and made a hideous yell of grief and woe. The Corragees
sucked the blood out of the wounds, and then filled them with a
kind of clay, which has a most powerful healing quality, and men
with dreadful wounds are frequently, indeed generally, recovered by
their treatment. A European, named Redman, who had been speared by
a native, was cured by one of the Corragees after Dr. Mason had
given' up the case as hopeless. The native cut out the spear with
great adroitness, and the wound soon healed; Upon Redman's
recovery, the Corragee demanded five pounds for his fee, saying,
"You would give ten pounds to white Corragee, why not five to black
Corragee." Redman, refusing to pay this demand, the native doctor
went to the Governor and complained, and, by His Excellency's
command, obtained a suit of clothes and a bottle of rum.</p>

<p>The gins are very prolific; as soon as a child is born, the
mother rolls it in dry clay, and then wraps it in the bark of the
tea-tree, which is as soft as velvet, and as thin as bank-note
paper.* In this covering she keeps the child for nine days, when
she strips it by the side of a pond; when undressed, she pitches
her infant into the water, and if it rises and floats, the mother
plunges in and brings out her child. It is astonishing to see the
vigour and agility of native children at this age. European women
seem to have new life and fecundity after being in this country for
a short time. I knew one instance of a woman of sixty years of age
having a child.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Collins says that he saw Bennelong's wife a
few hours after confinement. "To my great surprise," he adds, "she
was walking about alone, and picking up slicks to mend her fire.
The infant, whose skin appeared to have a reddish cast, was lying
in a piece of soft bark on the ground."]</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9. Pressures of
Business</h2>

<p>In the year 1802 I made a purchase of fifty acres of land from
the assignees of Daniel Spencer. This farm joined that which I had
purchased from John Randall. I bought it and the crop for
&pound;60. The crop was worth half that sum; for there were nine
acres of corn on it at the time. I had thus one hundred and ten
acres of my own, two cows, which I had bought from Government, and
sixty sheep. Mr. Cox would always exchange females for males with'
me; and a flock of sheep, in which the ewes breed twice a year,
soon increased. I had bought a young filly from Mr. Cox for one
hundred pounds, and I had as much grain to spare as would pay
Government for the two cows. This was the advance I had made for
myself and my family in the course of two years. I was proceeding
prosperously in the world, and was contented and cheerful. Besides
attending to my own affairs, I kept all the farms of Mr. Cox that
were within my reach in a proper condition and state of
cultivation.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[March 1802]</p>

<p>In March 1802 it was my intention to sow as much wheat and oats
as possible; and I accomplished the sowing of one hundred and
seventy acres, which produced a very fine crop. At this period I
sold for Mr. Cox several mares and horses at from one hundred to
one hundred and fifty pounds per head, several bullocks at
fifty-six guineas per head, and sheep at three guineas. I had
agreed to take wheat in payment for some of the horses; but I could
turn that into store, and get a bill on the Treasury; everything
seemed to go on in our favour.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[January 1803]</p>

<p>Mr. Cox was one night at Sydney, in company with Doctor
Jamieson,* who was Surgeon-General of New South Wales. They had
some words, and Mr. Cox owed him two hundred pounds. This happened
in January 1803, and in February Doctor Jamieson pressed him for
the money. The sum itself was a trifle to pay; but the Doctor had
circulated a report that Mr. Cox had failed, which made every one
who had the slightest demand upon him press forward with their
claims at once. When all the claims were added up, they made no
less a sum than twenty-two thousand pounds; and all his creditors
made a seizure at the same time. Mr. Cox came to me, and when he
alighted from his horse, I perceived, by his countenance, that
there was something serious in the matter. He beckoned to me to
follow him, and his first words were, "Mr. Holt, it is all over
with me."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Mr. Jamieson, the surgeon's mate of the
Sirius, proceeded with Lieutenant King, in 1788, to form a
settlement at Norfolk Island. In 1791 Mr. Jamieson received the
Governor's warrant, appointing him an assistant-surgeon to the
colony, in which capacity he was to be employed at Norfolk Island,
for which he sailed in the Supply, with ten settlers, in the March
of that year.]</p>

<p>I said, "Pray, Sir, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>Mr. Cox then told me how he and Jamieson had quarrelled, and
how, in consequence of what Jamieson had said of him, all his
creditors had pressed forward, and that he did not know in what
manner he should meet their demands.</p>

<p>My answer was, "Don't fret. Sir; for you have a great deal to
pay them with."</p>

<p>Mr. Cox observed, "If my creditors would only give me time, I
think, in the course of a year I could pay them all thirty
shillings to the pound."</p>

<p>We walked about a little, and when we went in, I brought my
books, and looked over the state of the stock. I saw at once if the
stock was sold then there would be a very great loss, and I advised
Mr. Cox to put off a settlement with his creditors as long as he
could, showing good cause for what I urged, as in the latter end of
March or early in April there would be a great number of young
lambs, and the old ewes and young lambs would sell very well.
Again, if six months' credit could be given, it would increase the
number of buyers tenfold. He approved of everything I said; but the
question was, whether the creditors would grant the required
indulgence. However, my worthy employer went away something better
in spirits than he came, though not actually a farthing richer.</p>

<p>A meeting was called of the creditors, and Mr. Cox gave in a
statement of the condition of his stock. The result was, that
trustees and a treasurer were appointed to take charge of his
affairs. Mr. Robert Campbell was the treasurer, and the Rev. Samuel
Marsden, with three others, the trustees. By them arrangements were
made for the first sale, which was fixed for the 15th April. I
picked out all the old ewes that had good lambs, and all the cows
that had young calves, and all the full-grown ones. The sale of
these were advertised, and notice given of six months' credit upon
good security. In New South Wales it is not difficult to ascertain
to whom credit may be given, as without any risk the stock and farm
of the purchaser may be taken as security.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[15 April 1803]</p>

<p>The day appointed for the sale arrived, and early in the morning
I sent up all the materials requisite for the company to lunch,
with the necessary refreshment. I very well knew the disposition of
the lower orders of the people; for I had been an auctioneer at
many places in Ireland, and I always saw that if the owner of the
goods gave two or three gallons of spirits to those assembled, the
cost was sure to be paid back to him in the price of a hogshead.
For when men get a little mellow, they forget that they will have
to sleep one-half of the six months for which they are to get
credit. It is like a man in Ireland passing his promissory note for
ninety-one days; the time soon slips away. I had mentioned my idea
to Mr. Cox, and he told me to act as I thought proper, feeling
satisfied that I would do everything to forward his interest.</p>

<p>I therefore sent up a right good sample of strong rum; and as
almost every one came up to make enquiries, knowing that I kept a
stock book, I was soon in possession of what every man intended to
buy,, and I was free in dealing out the rum; indeed, I must confess
that I had one-half of the poorer sort drunk before the sale took
place. Rum, at this time, sold for fifteen shillings a bottle in
the colony, and though I gave away my glasses for nothing, before
night what I had expended was worth five pounds a bottle.</p>

<p>Catalogues of the sale were printed, and the stock of all kinds
numbered, so that the auctioneer's clerk had no difficulty; no
earnest money being given, the purchaser's name, and the price, was
all that he had to set down opposite to the number. Mr. Cox kept
one book, James King kept another, and I kept a third; so that no
mistake could arise. Mr. Simeon Lord was auctioneer. Almost all the
creditors' attended this, sale, as it was advertised that if any of
the creditors made a purchase at the sale, they should be allowed
one-fourth of the debt due to them, in the payment of the purchase
money. This was a great temptation to the creditors to bid.</p>

<p>At one o'clock the sale began with the horned cattle. A cow,
that was 'blind, was put up, and Dr. Jamieson bought her, to the
great satisfaction of most of the people assembled, as to him might
be attributed the cause of the sale. This cow was knocked down to'
him at only fifty pounds, and he came to me to ask if she was in
calf. I congratulated him on his bargain, observing, much to the
amusement of those around us, that, as he was Surgeon-general, this
blind cow would give him an opportunity of showing his skill, by
restoring her to sight. The next lot was a young cow, with a female
calf one month old. They were put up at fifty guineas. Captain
Rowley bid fifty-five guineas, and the bidding advanced to sixty
guineas, sixty-five guineas, seventy-five guineas; at which sum
they were knocked down to John J ones. The cause of these rapid
advances being made, was owing to the competition between the
creditors to get a fourth of their claim upon Mr. Cox allowed in
payment. John Morgan bought a two-year-old heifer for sixty
guineas. Sergeant Field paid eighty guineas for a cow and a male
calf.</p>

<p>The sale of the cows went on from sixty to eighty-five guineas,
and during the time I took care to be free with my rum bottle, the
effect of which was obvious in the <i>spirited</i> manner of
bidding. The sale of the sheep followed. Lot number one consisted
of ten ewes and ten lambs, five males and five females. The ewes
were put up at two pounds ten shillings each, with the lambs. The
biddings went on, "two pounds fifteen,"&mdash;"three
pounds,"&mdash;"three pounds five,"&mdash;"three pounds
ten,"&mdash;"three pounds fifteen." And honest Richard Rice, the
flogger, bid "three pounds, seventeen shillings and sixpence." They
were knocked down to him. Lot number two was bought by the same
man, at four pounds two shillings and sixpence, ewe and lamb. The
reader can judge, therefore, the sum that eight hundred ewes
realised, at these prices; and good fat wethers at from three
pounds to four guineas. The horses sold at from one hundred pounds
each, to one hundred and twenty; the mares at from one hundred and
twenty to one hundred and fifty. Oxen from thirty to fifty pounds
each.</p>

<p>The second sale was appointed three months after the first, and
it produced an advanced price, as the cattle were of a better sort.
The first day's sale amounted to &pound;2780 12<i>s</i>. <i>6</i>d.
sterling.</p>

<p>At the meeting which was called for the adjustment of his
affairs, Mr. Cox was sworn, and among other things stated, that he
paid Holt one hundred a year, and that he considered my services
were worth five hundred a year to the creditors. Mr. Campbell, who
as I have mentioned, had been appointed treasurer, called on me for
my accounts of the money expended in the purchase of lands,
building houses, fencing, and clearing the land, making stock
yards, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I gave in my account to the amount of &pound;7600., which had
been expended for these purposes during my servitude. The
treasurer, Mr. Campbell, and the three trustees, namely, Mr.
Marsden, Mr. Wentworth,* and Captain Rowley, then asked me if I
would continue in my situation? I answered, that at the request of
Mr. Cox, I would, but not otherwise. They said, that all they
required of me was to see that the work was carried on as usual,
and to be able to give them proper accounts when called for. I then
ventured to put a question to them, which was, that as Mr. Cox had
given up the management of everything to them, I wished to know on
whom I was to call for my yearly wages. Mr. Robert Campbell
immediately said that he would undertake to pay my wages.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Collins, under the year 1796, has chronicled
that, "Late in the evening of the 5th of March, his Majesty's ship
the Reliance, returned from Norfolk Island. In her came Mr. D'Arcy
Wentworth. This person," he adds, "arrived at New South Wales, in
the Neptune transport (1790), and went immediately to Norfolk
Island, where he was employed first as a superintendent of
convicts, and afterwards as an assistant to the Surgeon, at the
hospital there, having been "bred to that profession.<br>
<br>
"On the 4th of May," in the same year, Collins adds, "The Governor
notified, in public orders, his appointment of ( Mr. D'Arcy
Wentworth to the situation of Assistant Surgeon to the Settlement,
(of New South Wales), in the room of Mr. Samuel Leads, (the
gentleman who came out with Governor Hunter,) he being permitted to
return to England, for the recovery of his health."]</p>

<p>I had prepared ground for planting a large crop, and my usual
time for commencing to sow was the first Monday after St. Patrick's
day; it requiring a few days to get my men sober. Having chosen
twelve of my best men to sow the seed, for at this time we used
neither plough nor harrow, I commenced sowing on the 21st of March,
and finished on the 8th of June, having put in 266 acres of wheat,
and 8 of oats, drawing the seed corn from Hawkesbury, where there
were several thousand bushels of wheat due for horses and mares
sold two years before this period. This was in consequence of Mr.
Cox's generosity, for there never was a man who desired to serve
another more than he did, or to do a kind act. When the purchaser
of a horse or a mare came to make his first payment, Mr. Cox would
often indulge them with six month's longer credit. He was truly a
good friend to every honest man he met with. His good treatment of
the convicts in his service had the happiest effect upon many of
those who were so lucky as to get into his service; most of them by
finding out that honesty was the best policy, became sincerely
honest and well conducted, and were purged and purified from their
former detestable propensities, and lived and died valuable members
of society. So much does gentle and mild treatment win upon the
minds of men, while harsh severity and coercion hardens their
hearts, and brutalizes their character.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[10 May 1803]</p>

<p>On the 10th of May the trustees sent for me and required a
statement of the disposal of the wheat I had drawn from James
Sherrard, at the Hawkesbury. I took from my pocket a little book in
which I entered, in short, all the transactions of my trust, and
from it ascertained the quantity I had drawn to be sixty bushels,
which being found correct, I detailed the quantity I had used as
seed, viz., fifty-seven bushels. It was demanded what I had done
with the three other bushels; my answer was ready, "I never sowed
foul seed on good ground, and therefore had screened and picked it,
and the result was that there were three bushels of oats, grass,
and other seeds, which if sown with the wheat would have injured
the sample; this dross I had given to the poultry."</p>

<p>They put to me many other questions which I thought not
altogether civil or generous, and I became warm, and told them I
would not act for them, if I was not trusted, as I felt myself
entitled to confidence. They then said they did not doubt me, but
that a complaint was made against Mr. Cox, which induced them to
question me. I felt very indignant at this, and immediately said,
"let the informer appear and face me, or I will not answer another
word; Mr. Cox is incapable of an unworthy act, and you must get
some other manager, for I will not act under suspicion, or allow
Mr. Cox to be insulted through me." I knew this was a malicious
attempt to injure Mr. Cox, and his feelings, and drive him from the
farm.</p>

<p>I found that Mrs. Cox had no horse at her command, so I went in,
to pay my respects to her, one morning, and said that it would
oblige me, and satisfy my mind, if she would accept of my mare.
When Mrs. Cox hesitated in replying to my offer; I said that I
hoped at least she would consider the mare as her own, as far as
the command and use of the beast, and if she did not do so, I would
think there was no friendship between us. After a pause, Mrs. Cox
said she would accept of my very friendly offer, and expressed
herself greatly obliged to me. She was a complete gentlewoman.</p>

<p>The last day's sale came on, and everything sold; the entire
stock was gone, and then the trustees directed me to reduce the
number of the hands employed; I was sorry for the poor fellows, who
knew well they must suffer by the change, but I determined to
render it as little injurious to them as possible, and after
ascertaining the names of the ships in which they came, the names
of the respective captains, where they were tried, what was their
sentence, and what length of time of it they had served; I drew up
characters for twelve of them, certifying their good conduct whilst
in the employ. I then marched them into Parramatta, to the Rev. Mr.
Marsden, and solicited his interest to obtain for them tickets of
leave, to get their living as free men, in consequence of their
regular and good conduct, which I certified to him. I succeeded in
obtaining for them the indulgence, and thus completed their
reformation; they became free if well conducted, and never after
forfeited, by ill conduct, the favour they had obtained. I then
took them to James Larra's, an honest Jew, and gave them each a
glass of rum at parting, and cautioned them as to their future
conduct. They very warmly expressed their gratitude.</p>

<p>The method I adopted to keep my men well clothed and in good
order, I will describe to you. I used to direct them to muster in
the square, in the front of Mr. Cox's house, or of my house, with
their boxes or bags, of clothes. I had a slip of paper, with every
man's name, and having formed them into line, I made the right hand
man show me how many shirts, trowsers, jackets, &amp;c. he had, and
if he exhibited a good stock, he had no mark put against his name.
Those who had a bad kit, had a cross placed opposite to their
names, and were told that no rum, or extra indulgence, would be
given to them, until their kit was made up to my notion of what
they ought to possess; and thus I had the best clothed servants of
any in the colony; they would earn from 7<i>s</i>. <i>6</i>d to
15<i>s</i>. a week each, besides their subsistence. They had slop
clothes given out to them twice a year, in lieu of their wages, or
so much of it as was necessary for their decent appearance, and
comfort. They were, in this manner, prevented from drinking their
earnings, and became sober, well conducted men. I believe it is the
love of drink, and the power that intoxication has over mankind,
which is the cause of the ruin of more than half of the population
of the world.</p>

<p>At one period, the constables of Parramatta, if they met a
convict carrying a bottle with spirits in it, usually seized it,
especially on Sundays; and it happened that one of my men, named
Joseph Murray, was carrying a bottle of spirits in his hand, with
which he was going to pay a tailor for making a jacket and
trowsers; a constable seized the bottle, and threatened to keep it.
Murray said to him, "You shall not do so till you have been with
Mr. Holt, and if he says my week's earnings are to be taken from
me, why, I will submit."</p>

<p>The constable consented to accompany Murray to my house; but
Murray, when he got him out of the town, took the bottle from him,
and gave him a sound drubbing; Murray then came to tell me his
story. I was much amused at the man's account of his adventure, and
was determined to see that justice should be done. I therefore
desired him to follow me with the bottle openly in his hand, and
not to conceal it in a handkerchief. We met several constables, but
they did not venture even to look at us a second time; if any man
had attempted to take the bottle, I was determined to have knocked
him down, and to have defended my conduct in doing so by
considering him as a highway robber. I went to the house of John
Jennett, who had succeeded Barrington the pickpocket* in the office
of chief constable.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Mr. George Barrington, "during his residence
in the colony," says Mann, "conducted himself with singular
propriety of conduct, and by his industry had saved some money; but
for a considerable time previous to his death he was in a state of
insanity, and was constantly attended by a trusty person. The
general opinion of those around him was, that he brought on this
malady, so destructive to the majesty of man, by his serious and
sorrowful reflections on his former career of iniquity. He
expressed a very considerable degree of displeasure, when he was in
a state of sanity, at his name being affixed to a narrative, which
he knew only by report, as being about to be published, and which
subsequently did appear under a deceptive mask."]</p>

<p>Having obtained admission to the presence of this great
functionary, I asked him if it were lawful for his constables to
stop my men on the highway, and take their property from them? and
if they acted by his authority? He disclaimed all knowledge of such
proceedings, and said it was altogether unlawful and unauthorized.
I then desired Murray to relate the facts just as the affair had
happened. I then observed, that it was after ten o'clock on
Saturday night when I paid Murray for his work, and that if he had
come into camp then it would appear as if he was out after hours.
"You know very well," said I, "that I never allow my men to be
scampering about camp on Saturdays; I make them perform their work,
and therefore on Sundays they must pay their debts; and what have
they to pay? only what I pay them with for their labour. Because
the payment was made in spirits, your constables take upon
themselves to stop my men on the highway, and to commit a robbery
upon them; for nothing else is it, the depriving a man by force of
the wages paid him by his employer, and which he has honestly
earned. Unless the practice is instantly put a stop to, I will see
the Governor on the subject, and in the mean time, so satisfied am
I of the illegality of the proceeding, that I will, on my own
responsibility, desire my men to resist any attempt of the kind,
and treat as robbers the fellows who conduct themselves as
such."</p>

<p>All the constables were sent for, and Murray having identified
the man who had attempted to make the seizure from him, he was
dismissed from his office, and orders were issued to the other
constables not to molest or interfere with my men unless they were
acting contrary to law or orders; so my poor fellows were
afterwards free from the petty tyranny of these blackguard
constables.</p>

<p>Jennett, although at first I think he was not very well pleased
with me, made me sit down with him. We afterwards made up any
misunderstanding which might have existed between us, while
drinking a bottle of rum together, and parted very good
friends.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[24 December 1803]</p>

<p>On the 24th of December, 1803, after settling business with Mr.
Cox, he desired me to go to Parramatta to meet certain men from the
Hawkesbury, when, to my great surprise and astonishment, I was
arrested, and brought before Judge Atkins. I requested his worship
would inform me of the cause of my being made a prisoner, as I was
totally ignorant of having incurred the displeasure of any one. He
answered me like an infuriated savage, roaring out like a wolf,
that he would soon let me know. "You thought to murder me," cried
he, adding with an oath, "but I will soon see you hanged."* I
answered, that "I knew not to what he alluded; and being innocent
of offence could laugh to Scorn his threats."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Holt's representation of the conduct of
those injudicial capacities in New South Wales, is, of course, the
statement of an irritated man; at the same time, what Mann says
strongly corroborates it:&mdash;"As instances of the irregularities
that have been practised by some of those in magisterial
capacities, I need repeat none others than that I have known men
without trial to be sentenced to transportation by a single
magistrate at his own barrack; and free men, after having been
acquitted by a court of criminal judicature, to be banished to one
or other of the dependent settlements; and I have heard a
magistrate tell a prisoner who was then "being examined for a
capital offence, and had some things found upon him which were
supposed to be stolen, and for which he would not account, that
were he not going to be hanged so soon, he (the magistrate) would
be d&mdash;&mdash;d if he would not make him say from whence he got
them; nor do I believe it less true, that records of an
examination, wherein a respectable young man was innocently
engaged, have been destroyed by that same magistrate before whom
the depositions were taken."]</p>

<p>Seeing sergeant Cotton pass, I called to him, and requested him
to send over to Mr. Cox to let him know what had taken place. He
was as much amazed as myself, having parted from me not twenty
minutes before. He came to me within fifteen minutes, and inquired
what had occasioned my arrest. I replied, "Sir, it appears to me
that you and Judge Atkins know; for you sent me into this town, and
the very moment I had come in I was made a prisoner."</p>

<p>Mr. Cox then asked the Judge the same question, observing, that
if I was arrested upon information, the informer was some damned
rascal, who, in order to get into favour, had made up a story
against a man as well conducted and as industrious as any in the
colony.</p>

<p>The Judge looked at me earnestly for some time, and at length
asked me why I wore my beard under my chin? I told him it was the
first mourning ever worn in Ireland; for at the time when its
ancient inhabitants were bowed down to the earth by tyranny and
oppression, the people of the country wore their beards; and that,
as I had felt tyranny and oppression as great as that of ancient
days, I mourned in the same manner, as I had suffered greatly, and
no one was better entitled than myself to bear this mark of grief
and depression; I saw nothing but treachery, deceit, falsehood,
tyranny, and oppression, let me go where I would.</p>

<p>He said, "I would advise you to cut off that beard from under
your chin."</p>

<p>I answered, "I hope, Judge, my beard does not fret or offend
you, as I intend to wear it until I go to my grave, if I be
permitted to have such a resting-place. I wish that it had the
virtue of Samson's hair."</p>

<p>Mr. Cox asked if he would take bail for my appearance the next
day, and, by great persuasion, he consented.</p>

<p>I was much irritated at these proceedings, and felt disposed to
do some act of violence; for I was tired of the constant recurrence
of oppression, notwithstanding my cautiously abstaining from
meddling in public matters. In my passion I said that I would
charge my blunderbuss, and rid the colony of a few wretches, and
then that I would shoot myself, and thus, with a desperate act of
just retaliation, end a life of misery and suspicion in this wicked
world, where I was tired of existence. The old Judge was more
frightened than his prisoner; for when a man has to turn to his
breast for support, the innocent can never be a coward.</p>

<p>I returned with Mr. Cox to his house, and my wife was sent for.
Mrs. Cox was very much concerned at my fresh misfortune, and begged
me to take some refreshment; but I had no desire for food. We were
all very much puzzled to know the cause of my arrest, or what
information could have been given against me. Mrs. Holt came and
spent the day with Mrs. Cox and myself, and Mr. Cox went to
Governor King to enquire into the affair, and obtain what
particulars he could. After some time, it was found out that a
rascal had made up a false accusation against me; his examination
convinced even the Governor of my innocence, and the atrocious lies
the wretch had fabricated. He had his reward, however, but not
<i>that</i> he hoped for; for the Governor ordered him to receive
two hundred lashes, and sent him to the Coal river to carry coal on
his back for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>I was immediately liberated, without leaving Mr. Cox's house, or
any form whatever, and all things looked smooth again; but old
Judge Atkins and I were never good friends afterwards.</p>

<p>I began to collect in the debts due to the estate, and succeeded
pretty well. My fine large crop of wheat promised to fulfil all my
hopes. On the 21st of October a more beautiful appearance of a
successful harvest never flattered the expectations of a farmer; it
was within three weeks of being ripe, the ears were full and plump,
the straw clean and well coloured, and in every respect it was
gratifying to look at. I was greatly rejoiced, expecting it would
clear off a good portion of Mr. Cox's debts. It was, however, but
delusive; and, like other dreams of hope, only made engaging and
delightful to disappoint our expectation, and to show how uncertain
are all human calculations. In three days it was completely
destroyed by the rust, and the produce of two hundred and sixty-six
acres was not worth twenty pounds.</p>

<p>This extraordinary blight, which is, I believe, peculiar to this
country, is produced by fogs, which come on suddenly, and obscure
the sky for some days; and if it happens when the wheat is nearly
ripe, inevitably destroys it. It covers the whole straw and ear
with a reddish powder, like the rust of iron, which falls off as
you walk through the standing corn, and iron-moulds cotton or linen
articles like iron rust, and so effectually, that in a very short
time they rot and fall in pieces. I sent for the treasurer and the
trustees, to view the com after this calamity, who condemned it as
not worth reaping, and we gave it to the neighbours, to turn their
pigs into it, to eat up the grain which had escaped the blight. It
was a loss of at least fifteen pounds per acre, which amounted to
&pound;3990, a terrible loss, indeed, at this time; but it could
not be helped, and fretting only made things worse: so we bore up
against the foul weather, and braved the storm, with courage but
with humility.</p>

<p>I had purchased a farm for &pound;300, from Lieut. John Brabyn,
of one hundred acres, on which were forty-five of as fine looking
wheat, and fifteen of maize corn, as ever were seen. Had I been
blessed with success, I should have cleared the whole price of the
farm for ever, and a hundred pounds into the bargain; but the crop
fell under the same calamity as Mr. Cox's, and did not produce me
five pounds. I gave Mr. Brabyn &pound;100, and relinquished the
bargain.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10 Insurrection</h2>

<p class="date-jnl">[February 1804]</p>

<p>I now approach a period of my life, which I consider the most
unfortunate in the whole of my existence. In February, 1804, the
devil was as busy in New South Wales as ever he had been in
Ireland, and exerted all his evil influence.</p>

<p>The lower people, convicts and others, both English and Irish,
seeing their torment increasing in this most ill-managed colony,
conceived an opinion that they could overpower the army, possess
themselves of the settlement, and eventually make their escape from
it. Where they were to go, did not enter into the contemplation of
these poor fellows, who fancied, at all events, they could not be
worse off than they were already.</p>

<p>Some of them hinted to me that they thought such a thing might
be done. I thought so too, and that it might come to a head; and,
therefore, pointed out in the strongest language I was master of,
the folly of such an attempt. "You saw," said I, "in Ireland, that
even there you could not depend on each other, and I am sure it
would be worse here. An insurrection will only add to your misery,
or bring you to the gallows."</p>

<p>Badly as the laws were administered in Ireland, it was much
worse here. Informers and false swearers were even more numerous in
New South Wales.</p>

<p>Their numbers were contemptible, and their means still more so;
therefore they must assuredly fail, and be hanged. I told them I
would have nothing to do with the business, and if such a scheme
should be put into execution, I would act on the side of the
government and the laws.</p>

<p>I did hope this advice would have had the desired effect, but
the foolish people had set their minds upon it, and were determined
to proceed, cost what it might. The English were as much involved
in the business as the Irish. Of course, after declaring my
sentiments so fully, I was not kept in their confidence; and I had
almost forgotten that such an idea had ever been hinted at.</p>

<p>I had at this time saved about &pound;500, and having "so much
to lose, besides, putting my family in jeopardy it was not for me
to interfere; I knew the trickery of men, and what reliance could
be placed on outlaws and rebels, who, if they once succeed in a
project, get out of all discipline; and, if defeated, surely betray
their leaders.</p>

<p>Had I no wife nor children, and been disposed to have taken the
lead on this occasion, I could have made a short job of it. The
military were so, inattentive, careless, and lax in their
discipline, that any one of skill could have formed a plan to
surprise them, and might have taken magazine, army and all, in an
hour. The government had treated me in such a manner, that I did
not feel myself called upon to become an informer for them, and as
for the unfortunate people, I knew they were not to be trusted,
and, therefore, I gave them no advice as to how they ought to act.
So, like a ship in bad weather, I determined to lie to, and let
everyone one take care of himself.</p>

<p>I shortly after went to the Hawkesbury, to gather in wheat; for,
having burned the candle with Mr. Cox, I was willing to burn the
ends, and so made him a present of three months, after serving him
four years.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[4 March 1804]</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, 1804, when returning home through
Parramatta, I saw several men standing about in little gangs, and
recollecting what had been told me, I suspected something was going
on, but said nothing. Having dined at Parramatta, I walked out, and
met Timothy Holster, task-master of the government men. He and I
seldom met but we drank together, when time permitted, and on the
present occasion we called for a decanter of rum. He was an
Englishman, and while we were drinking he said to me, "Mr. Holt,
take my advice, and do not be out late to-night, as I should be
sorry to hear anything against you." I asked him what he meant; and
he then told me that the Irishmen were to break out that night, but
that the government were in possession of their plans. I
immediately proceeded to Mr. Cox, and brought my wife and child to
his house, and told him what I had heard. He asked me my opinion of
the business; to which I answered, that I knew nothing more than
what I had heard and told him, but that I should be ready to defend
his house, and keep off any assailants. He gave Sergeant King, who
was his clerk, orders to prepare some cartridges, and we were all
upon the alert. Mr. Cox said it was very likely that the insurgents
would endeavour to force me to head them, and, if I refused, would
put me to death. My answer was "I can die but once, and from this
spot nothing shall induce me to move, until morning."</p>

<p>I then proceeded to secure the gates, doors, and all the
defences I could think of. I got the timber carriage chains, and
lapped them round the gates and posts. There were three gates to be
passed before the court-yard could be entered, and I made all fast.
Having thus got all things as secure as possible, I proceeded to.
examine the state of our fire-arms, and having loaded our muskets
with buck shot, I asked Mr. Cox if he would take the command. He
gave it to me, saying, I was more accustomed to such matters than
he was, and he had no doubt would make a good fight of it. I
therefore proceeded to make arrangements, in case we should be
attacked.</p>

<p>I placed Mr. Cox on my right, opposite a large gate-post,
fourteen inches square, and Sergeant King on my left, telling him,
that it was not fair that he should receive his Majesty's money for
doing nothing. John Joyce was placed at the upper gate, and Darby
Murphy at the lower gate, for a watchman. I then told every man
what he was to do, and that the first who stirred from his post,
without orders, should receive the contents of my musket in his
body. I took the centre myself, being flanked by Mr. Cox, and King.
The road or path leading to the house was only sixteen feet wide,
and it was paled in with a six foot paling, so that a party would
be obliged to keep very close together. We heard the insurgents at
the distance of about half a mile, but they came no nearer to
us.</p>

<p>About twelve at night, however, they went to my farm, and took
away a musket and a blunderbuss from my son, who was but fourteen
years old; and a young man named James Dobbs, an Englishman, they
forced to join them. My shepherd was so small that they did not
consider him worth their attention; but they swore they would soon
have me. When they were gone, Joshua, my son, came through the bush
and told us what had happened at the Brush Farm; we put him into
the house, with Mrs. Cox, my wife, and the children, and stood to
our posts till the morning, when Mr. Cox rode over to inquire the
cause of the proceedings of the night. He returned in the evening,
with the following account.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* D. D. Mann, who published, in 1811, a small
work entitled "The present picture of New South Wales," which was
written to illustrate some views of Sydney, gives the following
account of this insurrection. "At the commencement of the year
1804, the tranquillity of the Colony experienced some interruption.
I have mentioned the circumstances of the importation of Irish
Convicts, in the year 1800, and of their attempts to disseminate,
among their fellow prisoners, the seeds of insubordination and
riot. The vigilance and prudence of Governor Hunter, at that time,
checked the rapid progress of the flame of sedition; but although
apparently extinguished, the tire \$as only smothered for a time.
Discontent had taken root, and its eradication was a matter of more
difficulty than could have been foreseen. The most unprincipled of
the convicts had cherished the vile principles of their new
companions, and only waited for the maturity of their designs, to
commence the execution of schemes which involved the happiness and
security of the whole Colony. The operations of these disaffected
persons had hitherto been conducted with such secrecy, that no
suspicion of their views was entertained, until the 4th of March in
this year, when a violent insurrection broke out at Castle Hill-, a
settlement between Parramatta and Hawkesbury, and the insurgents
expressed their determination to emancipate themselves from their
confinement, or to perish in the struggle for liberty. Information
of the extent and alarming appearance of this mutiny having reached
the Governor, it was deemed necessary, on the following day, to
proclaim martial law; and a party of the troops under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel George Johnstone, were directed to pursue the
rebels. After a long march, the military detachment came up with
the insurgents near the Ponds, about half way between Parramatta
and Hawkesbury, and a short parley ensued, when the Colonel found
it necessary to fire upon them; and after killing several of the
misguided rebels, and making prisoners, of the principals who
survived, the remainder made a rapid retreat: Ten of the leaders of
this insurrection, who had been observed as particularly
conspicuous, and zealous in their endeavours to seduce the rest,
were tried on the 8th of March, and capitally convicted. Three were
executed on the same evening, at Parramatta, since it was justly
concluded that measures of prompt severity would have a greater
effect upon the minds of those who had forsaken their allegiance.
On the following day two other rebels were executed at Sydney, and
three at Castle Hill; the two remaining criminals were respited, as
they were the least corrupted, and had discovered symptoms of
sincere remorse for the part which they had taken in the late
operations. On the 9th, martial law was repealed."]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[5 March 1804]</p>

<p>About three hundred men had assembled on the Castle Hill, and
chosen one Cunningham, from the county of Kerry, as their leader.
Captain George Johnstone went up towards them, and demanded of
Cunningham what he wanted, and why they had assembled. If they had
any real grievance, he would endeavour and get it redressed,
Cunningham advanced, and took off his hat, and with it in one hand,
and a sword in the other, replied <i>"Death, or liberty!</i>"
Captain Johnstone made no attempt to molest him, but Laycock, who
stood six feet six inches, a quarter-master in his corps, came up,
and with one blow, killed Cunningham on the spot. On this the whole
of the mob took to their heels and many were shot in the pursuit.
Cunningham's body, although he was dead, was brought to Hawkesbury,
and hanged up as an example to the rest.</p>

<p>But what else could have been expected from the conduct of a
general, who would condescend to take off his hat to the captain of
ah opposing force? If I had been in Cunningham's place, I would
have taken off Captain Johnstone's head, instead of my own hat. I
had this account confirmed to me by one of my own men, named John
Byrne, who was one of the insurgents, and was present at the time
of the occurrence.</p>

<p>The unfortunate wretches who escaped by flight, were arrested by
a party of forty soldiers, the constables, and some loyal settlers;
and being brought before a Court Martial, it was arranged that lots
should, be drawn from a hat, and that every third man whose name
was drawn, should be hanged. Many fine young men were strung up
like dogs, but the arrival of the Governor put an end to this
extraordinary proceeding. Among those hanged, there was a nephew of
the Surgeon-general, Mr. Jamieson, but this was kept, as far as it
could be so, a profound secret.</p>

<p>Many persons now pressed forward to inform against those whom
they hated, and wished to destroy, and few had a good word for me,
thinking thereby to purchase favour for themselves; but Mr. Cox
being a magistrate, and knowing how I had been employed in arms for
the defence of his house and family, put a stop to the chief weight
of their malice at this time. The Governor, however, was prejudiced
against me, and soon found a cause to create suspicion. There was a
Frenchman named Francois Duliatt, who lived near the Government
House. He had come from a prison in England, out of which he had
been released for the purpose of propagating vineyard grapes, in
this colony. He owed me &pound;8, and as I went to get payment, and
he being a suspected person, and I having been seen going to his
house, I was called upon to state what had brought me there. I told
the Governor the truth, and took out of my pocket the note of hand
for the payment of the &pound;8 which I received.</p>

<p>The Governor looked at me with the enraged countenance of a
she-bear robbed of her whelps, and said, "Go home. Sir, take care
of yourself, or I will hang you." I made answer, "I hope you will
wait till I deserve it, and if you do, I defy you."</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[18 March 1804]</p>

<p>Mr. Cox's business being now completed, so far as I could be of
service in the matter, I began to prepare to move to my own farm.
On the 18th of March, I delivered to Mrs. Cox, a chest which had
been placed in my care, in the same state that I received it, and
this I was not a little pleased at being able to do, as my house
had been twice searched for papers which might throw any light on
the recent rebellion.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[19 March 1804]</p>

<p>On the 19th of March, in the morning, I had got the wagon
loaded, and had sent it over to my own house at Mount Hester, when,
as I was waiting for its return, that I might send my family over
altogether, the Governor required my attendance by a constable, who
in fact took me into custody.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Cox with the Governor, engaged in taking down the
informations of a one-handed man, named Neill Smith, from the
County of Monaghan, who swore that Holt had agreed to join the
rebels at Castle Hill, and that Captain Cox was to join them at
Parramatta. Mr. Cox said to him, "I had a doubt about the
correctness of what you were saying, my good man, but now I cannot
have any; I am sure you speak the truth." The wretched man took
encouragement from this, and proceeded to accuse so many
respectable people, that the Governor became, outrageous, and
ordered the rascal to gaol, until he should be sent to the Coal
River.</p>

<p>It was now my turn to be interrogated, and the Governor asked me
when I last saw James Grice?</p>

<p>I answered "about a month since; I met him in the street, at
Parramatta, but I have never spoken to him since I discharged him,
and had him tried for stealing Mr. Cox's sheep."</p>

<p>"You have, you villain?" said the Governor.</p>

<p>"I have not, Sir," was my reply. "I would not speak to him if I
met him ten times a-day."</p>

<p>The Governor persisted that I had, and so despotic was his
wrong-headed passion, that he neither regarded law nor justice. It
is a sad thing for any country to be in the power of one man, whose
temper is violent, and who accredits whatever is told him&mdash;who
is the slave of the first story. Now, I ask, if it was probable
that I would have any confidential communication with a man whom I
had discharged, and put on trial for his life. Is it probable, I
say, that I would wilfully put my life in his power a few months
afterwards?</p>

<p>The Governor, in his blind inveteracy against me, ordered me
away to Sydney gaol, and sent for one of my body-guards, Daniel
MacAlice, the late hangman of Trim, in the County of Meath. I
arrived at Sydney, about eleven o'clock at night, and was received
by Daniel McKay, the gaoler, who put me into "my old sitting room"
as he called the cell, locked the door, and knowing, I suppose,
that I was deserving of respect, placed two men to watch it, as
sentries over me.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[20 March 1804]</p>

<p>This morning my poor broken-hearted wife came to see me, full of
fear and apprehension; for hanging was now as much the fashion in
New South Wales, as it was in Ireland, in 1798. She brought me some
food, and not having tasted anything for six-and-thirty hours, it
was very acceptable. I remained in confinement all the 20th.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[21 March 1804]</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st, I was ordered to prepare for an
examination; and was brought before Judge Atkins, and five other
justices. I had a slip of paper and a pencil in readiness.</p>

<p>The first witness was John Welsh, a Kerry man. He swore that he
was at the Hawkesbury on the 3rd of March, and that he met me
coming towards the Green hills that he asked me when I would be at
home, and that I told him not until I had got my business done, and
that I could not tell when that would be.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Had you any more conversation?</p>

<p><i>Welsh.</i>&mdash;Yes; I asked Mr. Holt if he would come and
have something to drink; Holt said he had something else to do,
besides drinking.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Did he say anything else?</p>

<p><i>Welsh.</i>&mdash;He told me I ought to be flogged for not
being at home, and that I ought not to be out drinking at the
Hawkesbury.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;What did he mean by that?</p>

<p><i>Welsh.</i>&mdash;Why I suppose he meant that I should be at
home, getting myself ready.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;What do you mean by getting yourself
ready? Ready for what?</p>

<p><i>Welsh.</i>&mdash;To kill the soldiers, and then to have the
colony to ourselves.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Did Holt tell you that he was to assist
you in taking the colony?</p>

<p><i>Welsh.</i>&mdash;No, sir; Cunningham did, and I heard many
more saying the same.</p>

<p>The Judge then turned to me, and said, "Prisoner, have you any
questions to ask this man?"</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Yes, I have. By the virtue of the oath you
have sworn, did you ever see Holt within the last six months on
Castle Hill?</p>

<p><i>Welsh.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Had you ever any conversation with Holt,
about any such business as that you have mentioned?</p>

<p><i>Welsh.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Was Cunningham, to your knowledge, acquainted
with Holt?</p>

<p><i>Welsh.</i>&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Do you swear from your own knowledge, or from
what you have heard?</p>

<p><i>Welsh.</i>&mdash;I swear from what was common talk.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i>&mdash;Put him down.</p>

<p><br>
A second witness was now called and sworn. His name was William
Ralf.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Do you know Mr. Holt?</p>

<p><i>Ralf.</i>&mdash;No, sir.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;You don't know your general?</p>

<p><i>Half</i>.&mdash;Mr. Holt was not my general; Cunningham was
my general, but he is dead.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Do you know anything of this rebellion,
or was Mr. Holt to meet you?</p>

<p><i>Ralf.</i>&mdash;O! faith, I heard Johnson and Cunningham say
that Mr. Holt would soon learn us all to fight.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Did you never speak to Holt yourself?</p>

<p><i>Ralf.</i>&mdash;No, sir.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i>&mdash;Mr. Holt, have you any questions to ask this
witness?</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;When did you see Holt last?</p>

<p><i>Ralf.</i>&mdash;Faith, I don't know that I ever saw him.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Do you know me, my man?</p>

<p><i>Ralf.</i>&mdash;No, sir.</p>

<p>The witness was allowed to retire; and then a third witness,
named Lawrence Dempsey, was called and sworn.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Do you know the prisoner?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;Yes, I do.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Was he concerned in your plot at Castle
Hill? If he was, tell the Court all that you know.</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;Why, gentlemen, he was to take Parramatta,
and then he was to go to Sydney, and take that; and then to carry
the Hawkesbury, which we did not much care about.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Where was Holt to meet you?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;Outside the park gate.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Did he meet you?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;No, faith, he did not.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Do you know what hindered him?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Well, did Holt ever go to Castle Hill, to
consult with you about this meeting?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;And pray how do you know that he was to
join you?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;-Sure Cunningham told us. Holt would meet
us there.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Did you ever hear Holt say it
himself?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p>Here I was asked the usual question, if I had any questions to
put to the witness; to which I replied that I had.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;How long is it since you saw me, before
to-day?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;About six months.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Who spoke to you first about this
business?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;Johnson and Cunningham.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Did they, or either of them, tell you at that
time that Holt was to join them?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;-No.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;How long ago is it since you were told that
Holt would join in this business?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;About ten-days ago.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Do you know anything about Holt, of your own
knowledge?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;You swear by hearsay?</p>

<p><i>Dempsey.</i>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;You may go down.</p>

<p>Judge Atkins then said, "Holt, they will not swear against
you."</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied, "and I can tell the reason; and will,
before I leave this Court, if I am allowed. I think, gentlemen," I
added, "it has not much the appearance of justice, when witnesses
are produced to swear away, by hearsay, the life and character of a
man; and when a man of property in the colony is torn from his
family, and confined, upon informations that cannot be sustained in
evidence. But there is a better and a Higher Judge, than he who
presides in this Court, and He knows that I am an innocent and
injured man."</p>

<p>Two more witnesses were called in, but neither of them knew me,
and all they swore was from hearsay. The only question I put to
them, was, did they know Holt? and their replies were the same,
that they did not know me. So they went down, and I was remanded to
my cell, with the cold flags for my bed. And I had the honour of
having two sentinels posted at the door of my lodging all
night.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[23 March 1804]</p>

<p>On the 23rd I was again brought up, and eight witnesses were
examined in the same manner as before; not one of whom knew me, so
I did not trouble myself, nor occupy the time of the Court, by
asking them any questions.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[24 March 1804]</p>

<p>On the 24th, it was hinted to me, that if I had as many lives as
Plutarch, I was sure to lose them all; for that my persecutors were
determined upon my destruction. But I put my trust in Him who had
so often saved me, and said inwardly that God had more power than
ten devils. I prepared myself for my defence, and craved of McKay,
the jailor, to let me have a couple of glasses of spirits. I
reminded him that he ought to know what a day of trial was, as he
had himself been tried for his life; the consequence was, that he
allowed me to get the spirits. I got my paper and pencil ready; for
the colony I knew had been searched to procure some iron-mouthed
fellows to swear against me. The Court met at eleven o'clock; there
were eight magistrates, besides Judge Atkins. I wrote a note on a
small bit of paper to Colonel Paterson, which I handed to him; the
purport of it was to request that the witnesses against me might be
kept apart, adding that all I desired was a fair hearing.</p>

<p>The first witness called was John McKeown; being sworn, he said
that he never would have joined in any conspiracy but for me, and
it was the same with every man from Castle-hill to the branch; that
every time Cunningham and Johnson came into camp, they brought the
news that I had more than half the soldiers on my side, and that
the moment the body of the people came to Parramatta, the soldiers
had agreed to do all the rest. This witness further stated that he
saw me in company with Cunningham, that I was to have ammunition
for the whole party, that I was to go to Sydney, and take Dawes
Point and the Magazine, and put the Governor to death; that the
Judge was to be flogged to death, with about twenty more, whom they
called tyrants.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Did you hear the prisoner say all
this?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;No; I only heard him say, that he would
put the Governor to death, and flog the Judge to death.</p>

<p><i>Judge Atkins.</i>&mdash;Did he say for what reason he would
flog me to death?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.&mdash;</i>Because, Sir, you had ordered men to be
flogged, and they had died from the flogging.</p>

<p><i>Judge Atkins.</i>&mdash;You swear that you heard Holt say
that the Governor and Judge should be put to death. Now, gentlemen,
I believe that is enough; we need ask no more questions! (to
witness) you may go down.</p>

<p>Colonel Paterson asked me if I wished to put any questions to
this witness. I smiled and bowed, and then began my
cross-examination of him.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;By the virtue of your oath, what month was it
when you saw Holt and Cunningham in conversation together?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Was it one month ago?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Was it three months ago?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Is it a year ago?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;No, I believe it is not.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;What was the day of the week?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;I can't tell.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;What were you doing?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;I was going out from my breakfast.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Was there any body with you?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Do you recollect where you were going to
work?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Was it Sunday?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;No; I believe it was Monday.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;What hour of the day?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;Nine o'clock.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Is that the usual hour for the men to come to
breakfast?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Was Cunningham at work?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;I believe he was.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;By the virtue of your oath, how long is it
since you were flogged?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;I can't tell.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;By the oath you have taken, did you ever see
Holt at Castle Hill?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;No; I did not.</p>

<p><i>Holt.</i>&mdash;Come, Sir, do you know me?</p>

<p><i>McKeown.</i>&mdash;No, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Judge Atkins.</i>&mdash;Go down.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," said I, "I believe that is enough! Pray,
gentlemen, call for that man's character, and call him in again,
and put him on his oath, and he will not swear two words according
to what he has now sworn. Gentlemen, I am sorry to find myself so
much mistaken. I thought that I lived in one of His Majesty's
islands where the well-founded and glorious law of England would be
allowed to flow in its full and free, course of impartiality,
sweeping away, by the strength of its tide, all the impurities of
our nature; but, instead of this, I see the current of justice
impeded by hatred and malice, and overshadowed by a dark design
against my life. I only wish for a man-like trial, and I desire
only British law. I despise all interest"&mdash;</p>

<p>The worthy Judge here interrupted me and said, "Take him away;
he knows more law than all this Court."</p>

<p>I answered Judge Atkins: "I have forgotten more law than, I
believe, you ever knew, and I never saw occasion to change the name
by which I was baptized."</p>

<p>The magistrates all hung down their heads, to conceal a smile,
as they knew that Tommy had received a slap in the teeth.* Three or
four other witnesses were then examined, but their testimony
amounted to nothing against me, and so the matter ended, and I was
sent to gaol again.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* See page 77. I am unable to elucidate Holt's
piquant observation, unless indeed by presuming that in making out
Mr. Atkins' official appointment, some mistake had occurred
respecting his Christian name, which obliged him to act in his
official proceedings, as Richard, instead of Thomas; or it is
possible that his name may have been Thomas Richard, and that in
consequence of the reason stated, he used only the latter.]</p>

<p>My wife went to ask his Excellency what I had done? He said, if
I had done nothing I knew what was going on, and would not come in
and tell. "But," said the Governor to her, "if your husband gives
four thousand pounds bail for his good behaviour, I will let him
stay."</p>

<p>Mrs. Holt merely replied, that I had always conducted myself
well, since I had arrived in the Colony. The Governor thought that
I could not find bail to so large an amount, but Mr. Smyth the
Provost Marshal, who was by, offered himself as one of my bail, in
which offer he was soon joined by Mr. Cox, Mr. Marsden, and Mr.
Hobby.* Upon hearing which, the Governor said, "No, he has too many
friends in the Colony, and shall go."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The name of Lieutenant Thomas Hobby, appears
in the New South Wales corps; his commission, as Lieutenant bearing
date 9th November, 1797.]</p>

<p>The "stay," and "shall go," of the Governor, completely overcame
my poor wife; she knew that he possessed or exercised the power of
sending any one from the Colony to Norfolk Island, a place of
horrid banishment and cruel treatment, and she felt that I should
be separated from her and my family, and exposed to cruel usage;
falling down upon her two knees she exclaimed, "It was both a sin
and a shame to send a man away from his family, upon charges which
could not be proved against him on a fair trial," and, in the
bitterness of her heart, she added, "may God requite you as you
deserve. He will be with you when you will be out of this."</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. Norfolk Island</h2>

<p class="date-jnl">[18 April 1804]</p>

<p>I remained in gaol until the 18th of April, when my poor wife
and child came down to see me, and I heard that on the 19th the
ship <i>Betsey</i>, from India, was to sail for Norfolk Island. I
was put on board early in the morning, and was thus cruelly
separated from my faithful and affectionate partner, leaving her
behind me in a strange country, on my way to a stranger one, a
barbarous island, the dwelling place of devils in the human shape,
the refuse of Botany Bay, the doubly damned.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Norfolk Island, which is situated on the
twenty-ninth parallel of south latitude, to the northward of New
Zealand, had been so favourably spoken of by Captain Cook, that
Captain Phillip, in 1788, was directed to form a settlement there.
This service was entrusted to Lieutenant King, of the Sirius, who
performed it in so satisfactory a manner, that on his return to
England, in 1791, he was promoted to the rank of Commander, and in
1800 succeeded Captain Hunter, as Governor of New South Wales.
Norfolk Island was abandoned as a government settlement, in 1805-6,
at which period Holt returned from it to New South Wales, via Van
Dieman's Land; but it was again resumed as a penal settlement, in
1825.]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[1 May 1804]</p>

<p>In twelve days we made Howe's Island, which is small, and about
five hundred miles from Port Jackson.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[17 May 1804]</p>

<p>On the 17th of May, we got sight of Mount Pitt.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The highest ground on Norfolk Island.]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[19 May 1804]</p>

<p>On the 19th, I was put into the boat with my bed, trunk and
other matters. The boat had also several chests of tea in her. When
I was within twenty perches from the shore, I heard the villainous
blood-hounds on the beach cry out, "Put him out of the boat," on
which I was made to leap into the sea, and I just had the presence
of mind to pull out my watch and to thrust it into my mouth to
preserve it from the salt water. They wanted to put a chest of tea
on my back, for me to carry on shore, but I would not support it by
my hand, and when they found this, the chest was lifted up, and
dashed down with its corner against my back, between my shoulders,
which hurt me very much. I feel the effects of that blow to this
day, and probably shall do so, as long as I live.</p>

<p>It would have been far more merciful, in those days, to have
hanged all who violated the laws of their country, than to have
sent them out to New South Wales, and its dependencies, subject to
the unmerciful treatment of human tigers, who tortured or killed
those within their power, according to the caprice of the moment. I
saw many a fine man die in misery, inch by inch, from the
oppression he experienced&mdash;the most cruel of all deaths.</p>

<p>I was put in gaol immediately on my arrival, although I had the
act of my emancipation. But what was the use of any legal right or
document, where there was no court or authority to redress
grievances. For if the Governor was disposed to hang, or otherwise
put to death any one without trial, He could do so, as Major
Foveaux did, when he took Peter McClean and Sullivan* out of church
one Sunday, put them into a cell, and two hours afterwards had them
hanged without any trial, a practice contrary to the laws of
England, and I am confident, to the wish of our gracious king, who
is even more merciful than the laws are just.**</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This name is subsequently written by Holt,
<i>Wollihan</i>.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[** Probably this is the occurrence thus
noticed in the history of New South Wales, bearing Barrington's
name. "By information from Norfolk Island, intelligence was
received, that a plot was fortunately discovered on the 14th of
December 1800, formed by some of the convicts to murder the
officers, and by getting possession of the island, to liberate
themselves. Two of the ring-leaders were immediately executed, and
others properly punished."<br>
<br>
Major Foveaux, of the New South Wales corps, (in which his
commission as Major, bore the date of 10th June 1790), sailed from
Port Jackson, on the 29th of June 1800, in the Hunter, for Norfolk
Island, to take the command of that settlement.]</p>

<p>The day after landing I was ordered to labour, which, being a
lawful freeman, I at first refused to do. Many of my countrymen
advised me to submit, as any excuse to flog or hang a man was
eagerly laid hold of. I had heard of this Major Foveaux a long
time, and I had seen him in Port Jackson; so, upon consideration, I
took their good advice, as they also told me that he was shortly to
be sent to England, to answer for his various misdeeds; and I
joined the working gang, and continued to labour until the Major
gave up the reins of government to a perfect gentleman, and an
excellent officer, Captain John Piper.</p>

<p>Major Foveaux had no sooner left the shore in the boat, to
proceed to the ship that was to convey him away, than this worthy
man came to the gaol. He took me by the hand, and told me, that he
had not lost a moment in releasing me.</p>

<p>"You will consider yourself," said he, "at perfect liberty to
proceed to any part of the island you please, and anything that I
can do to make your residence comfortable, shall be done. You can
draw your provisions from the public stores as usual, but you need
not work."</p>

<p>I blessed my God for this signal deliverance, and prayed both
for my benefactor and oppressor,: but my prayers for the latter
were not very charitable. To Captain Piper I returned many thanks
for his great kindness, but I declined taking anything from the
stores.</p>

<p>Immediately upon leaving the gaol I took a lodging from George
Guy, who was the attendant upon the doctor, at the dispensary. I
agreed with him for my diet and lodging at fifteen shillings a
week; he had no family, except a woman he lived with, or she with
him, which was the same thing. In this respect no one was very
particular. Major Foveaux set the example here, by taking the wife
of sergeant Sherwin to live with him, and what was worse, he
confined the sergeant: so the poor fellow, seeing the danger he was
in, thought it better to save his life, and to lose his wife, than
to lose both. He was wise enough to perceive that it is very
foolish to quarrel with the judge where there is no jury, for no
man will give a verdict against himself. So Ann Sherwin remained
with Major Foveaux, and the sergeant left the regiment as soon as
he could, and married a young woman, by whom he had five
children.</p>

<p>When I left New South Wales, Sherwin, who was a remarkably good
man, was storekeeper at Parramatta. He has often passed a night at
my house, at George's River, when he told me of the treatment he
received, which was enough to make the blood of any honest man
boil. Ann Sherwin had great influence over the tigerly Major and,
notwithstanding her faults she had a good heart. Many a man's
prayer have I heard offered up for her, for she was always ready to
intercede for the oppressed, and many thousands of lashes has her
interference saved; especially to unfortunate Irishmen, to whom she
was always very partial.</p>

<p>A mistress generally possesses more power over a man than a
wife, and Mrs. Sherwin certainly took every opportunity of using
the influence she possessed, in the cause of mercy. But what
morals, or good conduct, can be expected from the lower orders,
when their Governor sets them an example of profligacy. Our good
old king's conduct was an example which all men might imitate to
advantage, and it is in every way worthy of admiration and
respect.</p>

<p>Governor King's proceedings respecting the poor convict women,
on their arrival in the colony, was abominable. They were disposed
of by Potter, the bellman, as so much livestock. I have seen them
afterwards sold, some of them for a gallon of rum, others for five
pounds and so on; and thus they were transferred from one brutal
fellow to another, without remedy or appeal.</p>

<p>The day of Foveaux's departure from Norfolk Island, was one of
great joy to all he left behind him. A general change in the
countenances of young and old was perceptible, and the people gave
God thanks for their deliverance from the power of this man. The
new Governor had the good will and respect of every one, for he had
always conducted himself as a Christian and a gentleman.</p>

<p>When I was put to hard labour, upon my first landing in Norfolk
Island, I offered to pay a man for doing my work, but this would
not be allowed, I must work myself, and in consequence of this
offer, and my wearing good clothes, the dirtiest work was assigned
to my share. I was locked up every night with the worst of
criminals, and two hours before day in winter, every man was made
to get up and to tie up his bed, which he had to carry out into the
gaol yard, and there it remained until night, whether it rained or
not.</p>

<p>We were then marched before the door of Robert Jones, who was
the head gaoler or superintendent of convicts. Bob Jones' real name
was Bob Buckey in some part of England; his father, his two
brothers, and himself, were concerned in many robberies; and a
reward being offered for their apprehension, this wretch prosecuted
his father and his two brothers to conviction. The three were
hanged, and he came to be transported under the name of Robert
Jones, by which he thought that he should not be known. I have been
present when some of the soldiers have told him of these
transactions. When this Jones came out in the morning, he would
order some of the convicts to one place, and some to another. Tony
Chandler, an Englishman, was one of the overseers. Peter McGuire
was another, or, to call him by his proper name, Peter Walsh. He
was the nephew of Paddy Walsh, of Coolagad, near Hays of
Ballidunure, in the County of Wicklow. Young Walsh was a sailor in
the fleet at the Nore, and was transported under the name of Peter
McGuire, which was his mother's name. This he told me himself.</p>

<p>Chandler and McGuire would proceed with their respective gangs
to where they were directed, and a task would be given to each man.
It was often the case that the men would work very, hard to get
this done early in the day, so that they might have some time to
work for themselves to earn some provisions, as what was allowed
was not sufficient to support them; five pounds of flour to each
man being the allowance for seven days to live and work upon. When
upon these occasions the convicts were returning from the public
labour earlier than usual, they have frequently been turned back to
the Cascade to launch a boat, and kept there until ten o'clock at
night, without having, during the entire day, tasted a morsel of
food. I have myself with them experienced this treatment, and have
been sent back to gaol with the gang wet from head to foot, in
which condition we have been turned in, and reckoned like a flock
of sheep, without time being allowed to us to prepare our food. The
next morning, when the bell rang at five o'clock, the order for
every one to get up was given in these words, "Turn out, you damned
souls." We had then to look for our wet rags; and if the slightest
grumbling escaped the lips of any one the order was, "To the
triangle," where the flogger was ready to give the unfortunate
wretch twenty-five lashes on his bare back, after receiving which,
he had to go to work as usual. I ask, whether hanging or shooting,
which puts a man out of his misery at once, is not infinitely
preferable to this kind of treatment;&mdash;hard labour, want of
sufficient food, the protracted endurance of wet, cold, and hunger,
and if a word, or even a breath of complaint, reaches the ears of
your cruel task-masters, the flesh is cut from your back, and you
are worked with double severity.</p>

<p>I think that the usage I have seen men receive in Norfolk Island
exceeds in cruelty anything that can be credited. There was, in
particular, one poor young man named Michael Cox, from the County
of Cork: he was compelled to walk about and work with a chain,
weighing twelve pounds, on his leg, and while labouring under a
dysentery was driven up to his middle in the sea, and obliged to
bring heavy packages ashore, He soon became too weak for work, and
too late had his irons knocked off. Cox died in a few days after,
and I hope he obtained forgiveness for his crimes, whatever they
may have been, and mercy in Heaven; for no clemency was extended to
him in Norfolk Island.</p>

<p>I often thought that the doctors at the Dispensary were afraid
to exempt a man from his work, although the two that were there in
my time were both excellent men. One of them was D'Arcy Wentworth
who was Surgeon-General of New South 1804 Wales at my departure;
the other was William Redfern, who was the Assistant-Surgeon to
Doctor Wentworth. They both came from the North of Ireland.</p>

<p>During the time I was associated with the convicts, I was kept
at the heaviest work, and Bobby Jones, when the Government had not
employment for all hands at hard labour, would go to Major Foveaux,
and tell him that he wanted different little things done and
request that he might have the use of a gang, which he would
immediately send to his own farm. At last, between fasting and hard
work, I fell down. When I recovered a little, I went to the house
of George Guy, and told him that I wanted to see the doctor. Guy
went for Mr. Wentworth, and when he came he felt my pulse, shook
his head, and, in a very sad tone of voice, said, "Poor
fellow!&mdash;you <i>are</i> suffering." He then ordered some
medicine for me, and went to the Commandant&mdash;that tyrant,
Foveaux&mdash;and told him that he believed he was acting beyond
his power, and that if I died from the effects of labour, and from
the want of proper food, he should feel it to be his duty to make a
notation accordingly.</p>

<p>Foveaux replied, in a grim manner&mdash;"Then we'll exempt him."
So Mr. Wentworth desired me to go in to my unhappy lodging, and not
to do any more work until he directed it. If I could have bought or
borrowed a pistol, the world, I think, would soon have been rid of
this man-killer, Foveaux, and with as short a warning as he gave
the two men he hung without trial; for why should any man, with the
means of placing himself upon equal terms, and exchanging life for
life without the endurance on his part of protracted misery, allow
himself to be murdered by a lingering death, and see his murderer
rejoicing before him? There are cases in which a man who shudders
at the idea of murder may be obliged to become an assassin in
self-defence; and did not tyrants feel and tremble at this power
which an act of self-sacrifice can accomplish, there would be, I
believe, more despotism and injustice in this world than already
exists.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[27 August 1804]</p>

<p>I was fourteen weeks and two days in torture from my landing on
Norfolk Island; but I have already stated. Captain Piper, the
successor of Major Foveaux as Commandant, was a worthy and
honourable gentleman. Major Foveaux was recalled, as I have been
told, to explain his conduct in hanging the two men, who, by his
order, were put to death. It is not difficult for a criminal to
take his trial when there is no prosecutor, and no evidence to
prove the facts; and, besides that, there are plenty of fine
silver-tongued gentlemen in England to plead for a client who has
the means of feeing them well for their plausible words and
ingenious conceits. It is a counsel's business to hang the
innocent, or to let them be hanged, which is nearly the same thing,
and to get the guilty free. Major Foveaux, therefore, came out
again to the colony, with the title of Colonel, instead of
Major.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Major Foveaux was promoted to the Brevet
rank of Lieutenant-Colonel on the 29th April, 1802.]</p>

<p>I remained in Norfolk Island until Government began to evacuate
it; and when Governor King reflected on his conduct towards me, he
forwarded orders to Captain Piper to send me back. Norfolk Island
is not more than twenty-one miles in circumference. It is seven
miles long, and four miles wide, and produces the sugar-cane,
lemons, oranges, plantains, bananas, coffee, and guavas, and all
sorts of fruits which I have seen in the Brazils. This island lies
in 29&deg; 14'. South, and is much warmer than Port Jackson. As the
first inhabitants were not sent here for their good behaviour,
their children and descendants are not the best conducted; indeed,
they are pretty strong specimens of human depravity. I remember one
day, when the Rev. Henry Fulton was reading the Fourth Commandment,
to keep holy the Sabbath day, Tony Chandler sung out, "Turn out,
you damned villains, and launch the boat;" and his voice was more
omnipotent than the parson's, who in a minute was left with a few
women for his congregation, to hear the rest of the Commandments.
As I was going out, I said to Mr. Fulton, "I perceive, Tony
Chandler's word has more power here than the Word of God." Fulton
smiled, and shook his head.</p>

<p>I was one day upon Mount George, when I saw fourteen ships
standing towards the island. I walked down and told Captain Piper
of the appearance of this fleet. When he and Mr. Wentworth had
examined these ships through a spy-glass, they expressed themselves
much alarmed, as at that time the French flag was victorious in
many parts of the world. I went to my lodging, and shortly after
Edward Kimbley came to me. This Kimbley was chief constable under
Bobby Buckey, otherwise Bobby Jones. Of course I submitted myself,
and went with him, and was committed to the gaol with sixty-five
more, who had been driven there by these creatures&mdash;I mean
Foveaux's blood, hounds. They were weak enough to think, that if
all the Irishmen were not confined, we would turn upon them, and
kill them, which they knew they well deserved. They therefore got
some soldiers to surround the gaol, and scaffolds were placed all
round it, and if the fleet had proved to be French men-of-war, it
was intended to have set fire to the gaol, and to have burned us
all alive. Fortunately we did not become aware of this intention
until the next day. We were kept within, the doors close locked;
the soldiers were upon the scaffolds, and the arrangement was that
any of the Irish prisoners who effected their escape through the
fire were to have been shot by the soldiers.</p>

<p>In this manner things remained all night, the guilty consciences
of these wretches rendering them far more afraid than the innocent
men whom they meditated to bum alive, but who were ignorant of
their diabolical conspiracy. When the morning came, all the
settlers, soldiers, and loyal men that could be mustered, amounted
to no more than two hundred. They assembled at the Cascade, and had
lugged down there two field-pieces. One old man had ordered the
whole island to be searched, and all the broken bottles to be
brought to him; and he swore that he would charge the two
six-pounders with these fragments of glass, which would cut the
French to pieces if they attempted to land. By these proceedings,
it will be perceived how ridiculous the defence they could have
made would have proved.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock one of the ships sent her boat ashore, and
when it was found that the fleet was not that of an enemy, we were
all liberated. When I heard of the plan for setting the gaol on
fire, and indeed saw the preparations and the torches, I was
exceedingly enraged at the scoundrels who could seriously have
contemplated so infamous a proceeding; and immediately set off to
seek Captain Piper, and to enquire of him whether he had any
knowledge of this inhuman design, for the destruction of men who
had committed no fault.</p>

<p>He wondered at what I said, and asked me who was my authority
for making the statement that I had done? I told him George Guy;
whom he sent for, with Jones, and Kimbley, and several others. Then
the whole truth appeared. Captain Piper declared his innocence of
this wicked conspiracy; and he immediately broke and displaced a
great number of those who had avowed their knowledge of it. I
observed to Captain Piper that it was a melancholy thing that poor
Irishmen should be always under suspicion; and that, in my opinion,
if it had so happened that the fleet was an enemy, and that they
effected a landing, those on shore took the wrong way to be treated
as civilized persons, by putting to a savage death their prisoners.
I said that it would have been the most barbarous act that ever was
committed. If these Irishmen had been guilty of a fault or a crime,
in their own country, they had suffered for it; and whatever that
fault or crime might have been, it was no excuse for murdering
them, as McClean and Wollihan* had been by Foveaux.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Quere</i>, Sullivan? See p. 221.]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[November 1805]</p>

<p>I never had one moment's peace of mind, in Norfolk Island, and
was rejoiced beyond measure at the prospect of my leaving that
infernal place. The ship <i>Sydney</i>, from India, had arrived to
move some of the settlers from Norfolk Island to the Derwent,* with
some of the stock which belonged to government; and there were
orders for me to go in the first ship. The <i>Sydney</i> was
commanded by Captain Forrest; his mate, Mr. November. Robinson, and
the sailors, were all from Bengal; they were Mahommedans, Sepoys,
and Lascars. Her loading occupied about three weeks, during which
time I found employment in getting my sea-stores prepared. I had
been in the condition of a free man about fifteen months on the
island, and amongst the persons I had become acquainted with, was a
man named James Mitchell, one of the missionaries who had been sent
out by Sir Joseph Banks to cultivate the natives of Owhyhee and
Otaheite. He, however, thought better of his mission, and
considered that it would be a more profitable speculation for him
to enter into business, which he did; and, at the time of which I
speak, he had made, a very handsome provision for himself. At my
departure from Norfolk Island, he gave, me the choice of supplying
me with the money, or with the goods which I required. I chose the
former, and drew my own bills, which, were in the following form.
"I promise to pay the bearer the sum of Five Pounds, on
demand."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "Captain John Hayes, of the Bombay Marine,
visited Storm Bay and D'Entrecasteaux's Channel, [on the southern
part of Australia,' now known as Van Dieman's Land,] with the
private ships Duke and Duchess, from India, in 1794. He went much
further up the Rivi&egrave;re du Nord, than the boat from the
French ships had done [in 1792,] and gave it the name of the
Derwent River. This name is likely to efface the first appellation,
and with some degree of propriety; both from the superior extent of
Captain Hayes' examination, and from North River being an equivocal
term for a stream at the south end of Van Dieman's Land.<br>
<br>
"That Captain Hayes had some intimation of the French discovery Is
evident; but, not knowing the distinctive appellations given, he
took upon himself to impose names every where. Succeeding visitors
have gone with his Sketch in their hands, whilst the Charts of
D'Entrecasteaux were unknown in that part of the world; from
whence, and still more from those names having now become familiar
to the settlement established in the Derwent River, it will be
difficult, if not impossible, in many cases, for the original

"The head of the Derwent is the sole part where Captain Hayes'
Sketch conveys information not to be found more accurately in the
Charts of D'Entrecasteaux."&mdash;<i>Flinders</i>, 1814.]</p>

<p>And then affixing my signature, I passed this to Mr. Mitchell,
who received it as cash. The first bill that I drew on home was for
fifty pounds, at ten days after sight. My son paid it punctually,
and Mr. Mitchell afterwards very readily continued to supply me
with cash.</p>

<p>During the greater part of the time that I remained on Norfolk
Island, I had nothing to employ me; so I amused myself by fishing,
both day and night. I usually angled from off the rocks by day, and
took fish in the sea; at night, I prepared a bob with large worms,
on a hank of thread; and I took eels by spearing. Having held a
lighted torch for some time over the water, the eels soon began to
rise to the surface, and to play about. With this torch in my left
hand, and a short hand-spear in my right, I have taken as many as
three hundred eels in a night. My night-lines, with a large hook,
were able to hold a fish of fifty pounds weight. I have caught
silver eels in a mill-pond, which weighed thirty-two pounds. I thus
kept myself occupied, for I could not sleep, from thinking upon my
unfortunate banishment, and about my poor wife and family. My life
was miserable, when I was not at work. I desired to have my fair
proportion of labour, and all that I complained of was labouring
like a slave, and being compelled to herd with the vilest wretches
in the creation.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitchell had biscuits, pork, French barley, flour, and rum,
which sold at three pounds a gallon; so I procured from him all
these articles, ready for my voyage, and settled with him, by
passing him my bill for eighty pounds sterling, at thirty-one days
after sight, payable to John Macarthur, in Port Jackson. The
captain of the <i>Sydney</i> gave me notice that he intended to
sail on Friday. This was on Thursday morning, and I therefore went
round the island, and took leave of all my acquaintances: I can
safely assert that there were many in Norfolk Island that were very
partial to me. I was, altogether, nineteen months and two days on
that cursed island. In the morning I came to the beach, with a man
to carry my trunk and bed; and I told John Drummond, the beach
master, that I wanted to put my goods in the boat, but he would not
allow me, and boat after boat went off to the ship, until near
night. I was therefore obliged to go to Captain Piper, and it was
not until I had taken this step, that my pork cask, bread, and
flour, were allowed by this petty tyrant to be embarked. When I was
in the boat, with all my property, I prayed to God that I might
have the satisfaction of returning to the villains Drummond and
Jones the torment they inflicted on me,&mdash;and I had!</p>

<p>The cause of Drummond's retarding my embarkation was this. The
sea was as calm as a mill-pond in the morning, which, at Norfolk
Island, is a sure sign of a sudden change; and he wished to detain
me to the last moment, merely to occasion me considerable trouble
and risk in getting on board the ship; but I reached the
<i>Sydney</i> with my goods in safety, just as the storm began to
rise. I had given the boatmen a glass of rum, after they had put my
things on deck, and had sent them down to the steerage, when I
perceived Drummond coming alongside; I assisted him up. He had an
order to search the ship, for Mary Ginders, the wife of William
Ginders. She was concealed in a sack of cabbage on board, and was
stowed away snug enough. Drummond searched to no purpose, for she
could not be found&mdash;at least by him. When he had concluded his
examination I went over to where he was standing, and said, "Well,
Drummond, you are not on the beach now."</p>

<p>"No, nor you either," said he.</p>

<p>I swore a big oath, that I would rid the world of one tyrant;
and, taking hold of him, if it had not been for the interference of
Mr. Robinson, I would have thrown Drummond overboard.</p>

<p>The moment he got free of my hands, he ran down into the boat,
and I saw no more of him for three years, when I had my
satisfaction of the wretch, as well as of Bobby Buckey, alias
Jones.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Although Holt has before adverted to the
satisfaction which it gave him to repay Drummond and Jones, "in
their own coin," the obligations he was under to them, he makes no
further mention of the matter.]</p>

<p>We sailed that night, with a very strong breeze, which continued
for several days, but we did not make Storm Bay passage for
twenty-two days. We were very near being upon the rocks, as our
ship refused her helm in a gale on a lee-shore; but we bore out,
and dropped anchor, got down our yards, and mended some of the
rigging.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[2 December 1805]</p>

<p>The next day it moderated, and December, weighing our anchor we
soon came alongside of Betsey Island,* but coming in the mouth of
the Derwent River, the land breeze blew so strong in our teeth,
that we were obliged to drop anchor again. However we were not more
than two hours when the sea-breeze sprung up, and then with all
hands to the capstan bars, the anchor was soon up, and crowding on
all sail our vessel could carry, about four o'clock in the evening
we dropped anchor so close to land, that you might have chucked a
biscuit from the ship ashore. Captain Forrest landed immediately
with the dispatches from Norfolk Island.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "This," says Flinders, "is the isle of
Willaumez, of D'Entrecasteaux; but it was known to me from the
sketch of Captain Hayes, and is still to the colonists, under the
name of Betsey's Island."]</p>

<p>There were on board a great number of sheep and cattle belonging
to government, and a Mr. George Guest, with his wife and six
children.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[3 December 1805]</p>

<p>I remained in the ship that night, and the next morning I was
visited by Mr. Denis Carty, a young man from the County of Wexford;
he was very glad to see me. I then dressed myself and went on
shore, to pay my respects to Governor Collins, who received me very
kindly, and told me he was sorry to hear of the severe conduct of
Governor King towards me. He said that he was in possession of the
history of the whole transaction, and he also said that Foveaux's
treatment of me was unpardonable, and ought to subject him to
trial.</p>

<p>I remarked to his Excellency that "if the storm which produced
misfortune was a thousand miles off from the spot where I stood in
sunshine, it was sure, by some sudden shift of the wind, to burst
over my head, and to strike me down to the earth with its
lightning."</p>

<p>He said, "You have a just right to say so."</p>

<p>Governor Collins made me take a couple of glasses of wine, and
he told me to call in the evening upon him, as he had a good deal
of business to transact with Captain Forrest. Therefore, taking a
respectful leave of the Governor, I went to my friend Carty, and
dined with him. After dinner we walked together towards Newtown,
which was the government settlement, and in the evening I went to
call upon the Governor.</p>

<p>He asked me how I liked the climate?</p>

<p>I told him, very well, for what I had seen of it, which was not
much; that I certainly liked the temperature of the air, and as far
as I could judge, preferred the place to Port Jackson.</p>

<p>Governor Collins then said, that he would feel obliged to me, if
during my stay I would take his boat and boat's crew, and explore
the land along the river, making any remarks or observations that
occurred to me, upon the ground, so that he might know where best
to appoint a location to place the settlers in, that would arrive
from Norfolk Island. He added, the superintendent will bear you
company, with your friend, Mr. Denis Carty.</p>

<p>I told his Excellency, in reply, that it would give me great
pleasure to put him in possession of everything that my slight
knowledge might enable me to observe.</p>

<p>He shook his head, and remarked that though he had never seen me
before, yet that he had a full account of what sort of a man I
was.</p>

<p>I bowed, and thanked him for his good opinion of me.</p>

<p>He presented me with some wine and cakes, and made me sit down.
Governor Collins further requested, that at my convenience I would
go through the government crop, and the settlers' crops, and
acquaint him with my idea of what they might be expected to
average.</p>

<p>I told him that I would do this the next day, as I could not go
exploring until the day following, requiring a smith to make me an
instrument which perhaps I might want. He was very curious to know
what this instrument was. I answered that, "the face of the earth
was as deceitful as that of man." That many a man looked honest and
good, if you were to judge him from his countenance, but that a
smiling countenance often disguised the heart of a villain. "This,"
said I, "experience has convinced me of."</p>

<p>"Your observation is perfectly correct, Mr. Holt," observed the
Governor, "you are, I perceive, a moralist."</p>

<p>To convince the Governor that he had not formed a false estimate
of me, and to illustrate the moral, I said, "Sir, does not Major
Foveaux look smiling and pleasant, even when he is ordering a man
to receive from one to five hundred lashes? I am not going Sir, to
explore for you, and to return with a fine account, which might
mislead you: no, Sir, I must bore into the soil, and examine what
is beneath the surface, it is for this purpose that I require an
auger made."</p>

<p>Governor Collins seemed pleased at my explanation, and was so
good as to remark, that I perfectly agreed with the character which
he had heard of me. I wished his Excellency good evening, and went
to join my friend, Mr. Carty, to whom I mentioned my intention of
going through the crops, the next day, in order to make a return of
my opinion respecting them to the Governor.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[4 December 1805]</p>

<p>On the following morning, my friend Mr. Carty, and I set out,
after breakfast, upon this business; what very much surprised me
was, perceiving that there had been a frost as thick as a dollar,
as it was the 4th of December, which in this part of the world may
be compared to July in Ireland, and is, in fact, considered the
prime hot month. We proceeded to Newtown, and going through the
government wheat, I soon observed that one-fourth of it was
smutted. Mr. Clark, the overseer of the crops, met me, and I asked
him what his opinion was about the produce? He said, he never saw a
better looking crop in his life. I made a slight remark to him
about the fulness of the ears of wheat. "Yes," said lie, "did you
ever see such an ear before, in your life?" I answered, "that, I
really did not remember to have ever seen such an ear of wheat
before;" and well I might say so, for not one single grain of wheat
was there in it. It was an ear of smut. I left the sagacious
superintendent perfectly happy in his joyous ignorance. I did not
see any occasion for making him miserable; besides, it is a foolish
thing ever to take an apprentice without a fee; it spoils trade to
do so; and is not of any utility to the teacher. Upon coming to the
end of the government crop; Mr. Clark wished me good morning, and a
pleasant walk. When he parted from us, I put my friend Mr. Carty,
in full possession of all my knowledge respecting the smut in
wheat: I had a few ears in my hand, which enabled me to explain and
show him the nature of this destructive blight; "about which," said
I, "Mr. Clark knows nothing. He may understand mending a
flag-walking lady's shoe, but I am sure he is quite ignorant of a
crop of wheat."</p>

<p>This Mr. Clark had been a shoemaker in London; by interest he
got out to New South Wales as a free settler, and he was then made
superintendent of the government crops, about which he knew
nothing. It is this kind of interest that is so injurious to the
public; the interest which appoints men to situations for which
they are not qualified. Clark was no more fit to be a
superintendent of a farm, than I am to be secretary of state. But
the worst thing in the appointment of an unqualified person to
office, is, that he generally attempts to make up for his ignorance
by presumption, and becomes overbearing and tyrannical. He is
jealous of every one who has abilities to fill the post in which he
is placed, and, in proportion to his inability, is his conceit. It
is the cause of misery to thousands, to take a tiger from the land,
or a shark out of the water, that go about seeking whom they, may
devour, and place them as rulers; instead of a man with the heart
of a Christian and the head of a scholar. Oh that those who are put
in authority over us would well weigh and consider the disposition
and qualifications of the men, by them appointed to be governors in
the far off comers of the earth!</p>

<p>Mr. Carty and I went on the settlers' farms,. The first we came
to belonged to a settler from Cornwall, in England. I entered into
conversation with him about his crop, and asked him how he liked
the country, and so on. He said, that in a few weeks he hoped he
should like the country better than he had hitherto done, for he
would then begin to shear his wheat.</p>

<p>I remarked, that I wished he could clean drag it; that is, in
the same way that we drag the dirty wool off the sheep's tails, to
make them clean. The settler, or farmer, did not seem to understand
me.</p>

<p>I said, "Sir, how many bushels do you expect to the acre?"</p>

<p>He replied, "I think there will be thirty-five, some say
forty."</p>

<p>"It looks," said I, "as if you will not get more than
thirty."</p>

<p>"Why, sir," he observed, "it is well headed, and large
grain."</p>

<p>I stepped into the wheat, and began to pick off a few large,
blue-looking ears of smut, and when I had a dozen of them in my
hand, I asked the farmer "Had he ever seen finer wheat in England?"
He said, not. Then I told him, that I feared he was much mistaken
in his calculations, as I did not think his crop would produce him
twenty bushels to the acre, and that only with much trouble, to get
it fit for use. I then explained to him his mistake; and showed him
that out of the dozen ears which I had in my hand, the produce was
not equal to one sound ear.</p>

<p>I made a note of all this in my book; and I went on to the next
farm, which belonged to a Mr. Hayes, who resided there with his
wife and daughter. They were manufacturers of straw; plaiting it,
in the neatest manner, for the use of ladies. The daughter was a
beautiful girl; she was the prettiest violet that I saw growing at
the Derwent. The old lady was very pleasant, as my friend and I
carried a bottle of good rum with us. I saw a very fine greyhound
here, and admired her beauty so much, that the old lady took me to
look at her pups. She had nine, and Mrs. Hayes asked me what I
might value them at?, I told her that I did not know, as I had
never seen any sold. She said that she would, keep one of them, and
that the other eight had been sold for eighty pounds, and to be
taken when six weeks old. I said that I would make a note of this
also; which I did.</p>

<p>I examined the wheat upon the farms of all the settlers, and
brought back with me, for the Governor, samples both of the wheat
and the smut. My visit to the settlers' farms, and the
conversations that I had with them about their crops, left all the
poor fellows in a perfect fever.</p>

<p>I waited on the Governor, and, after showing him samples of the
smut, I told him that, as near as I could calculate, to deduct the
smut from the apparent produce, would render the crop one thousand
bushels of wheat short of the returns that had been made to
him.</p>

<p>He asked me, whether Clark, the superintendent, was with me when
I made my examination?</p>

<p>I answered that "he was with me when I inspected the government
crop."</p>

<p>"And did he not see the smut?" enquired the Governor.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said I; "the poor man knows nothing about it."</p>

<p>His Excellency made me remain with him a good while in his tent;
and, among other things that he spoke of, he expressed a wish that
I would inspect the stock.</p>

<p>I told him that I would do so with much pleasure; and
accordingly, the next day, I made my inspection, in company with
Mr. Patrickson, who was a tailor by trade, from St. Giles', in
London, and was superintendent over the stock and town. I went
through the sheep, and found them in a most unhealthy condition,
requiring much care and doctoring. The cows were also in a very bad
state. There were five hundred of them, which had just arrived from
India, one of the hottest countries of the globe; and the long sea
voyage, with want of sufficient water, had produced a great scurf
on their skins.</p>

<p>Having completed my examination, and made my observations, I
gave my opinion to his Excellency upon the best mode of treatment.
He was pleased to express himself as very much obliged to me.</p>

<p>I said, "Sir, if I have been of any service, it is not to
government that I desire to be so; but my wish is, to evince my
respect for the character of Colonel Collins."</p>

<p>The Governor said, "that he felt obliged to me for this
compliment, and valued my opinion of him."</p>

<p>This gentleman had the good will, the good wishes, and the good
word of every one in the settlement. His conduct was exemplary, and
his disposition most humane. His treatment of the run-away convicts
was conciliatory, and even kind. He would go into the forests,
among the natives, to allow these poor creatures, the runaways, an
opportunity of returning to their former condition; and, half-dead
with cold and hunger, they would come and drop on their knees
before him, imploring pardon for their behaviour.</p>

<p>"Well," he would say to them, "now that you have lived in the
bush, do you think the change you made was for the better? Are you
sorry for what you have done?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And will you promise me never to go away again?</p>

<p>"Never, sir."</p>

<p>"Go to the storekeeper, then," the benevolent Collins would say,
"and get a suit of slops and your week's ration, and then go to the
overseer and attend to your work. I give you my pardon; but
remember, that I expect you will keep your promise to me."</p>

<p>I never heard of any other governor or commandant acting in this
manner, nor did I ever witness much leniency from any governor. I
have, however, been assured, that there was less crime, and much
fewer faults committed among the people under Governor Collins,
than in any other settlement, which I think is a clear proof that
mercy and humanity are the best policy.</p>

<p>Colonel Collins died at the Derwent, sincerely lamented by every
one there, as well as by all to whom this amiable and excellent
gentleman was known, even by reputation.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "Colonel David Collins was the eldest son of
General Arthur Tooker Collins and Harriet Frazer, of Pack, in the
King's County, Ireland, and grandson of Arthur Collins, author of
the 'Peerage of England,' &amp;c. He was born on the 3rd March,
1756, and received a liberal education under the Rev. Mr. Marshall,
Master of the Grammar School at Exeter, where his father resided.
In 1770 he was appointed Lieutenant of Marines; and in 1772 was
with" the late Admiral McBride when the unfortunate Matilda, Queen
of Denmark, was rescued from the dangers that awaited her by the
energy of the British Government, and conveyed to a place of safety
in the king her brother's Hanoverian dominions. On that, occasion
he commanded the guard that received her Majesty, and had the
honour of kissing her hand. In 1775, he was at the battle of
Bunker's Hill, in which the first battalion of marines to which he
belonged so signally distinguished itself; having its commanding
officer, the gallant Major Pitcairne, and a great many officers and
men, killed in storming the redout, besides a very large proportion
wounded. In 1777 he was Adjutant of the Chatham Division, and in
1784 Captain of Marines on board the <i>Courageux</i>, of 74 guns,
commanded by the late Lord Mulgrave, and participated in the
partial action that took place with the enemy's fleet, when Lord
Howe relieved Gibraltar. Reduced to half-pay at the peace of 1782,
he resided at Rochester, in Kent, (having previously married an
American lady, who survived him without issue); and, on its being
determined to found a colony, by sending convicts to Botany Bay, he
was appointed Judge-Advocate to the intended settlement, and, in
that capacity, sailed with Governor Phillip, in May, 1787 (who,
moreover, appointed him his secretary); which situation he filled
with the greatest credit to himself, and advantage to the colony,
until his return to England, in 1797. The history of the
settlement, which he soon after published, followed by a second
volume,&mdash;a work abounding with information highly interesting,
and written with the utmost simplicity,&mdash;will be read and
referred to as ft book of authority, as long as the colony exists
whose name it bears. The appointment of Judge-Advocate, however,
proved eventually injurious to his real interests. While absent he
had been passed over, when it came to his turn to be put on
full-pay; nor was he permitted to return to England, to reclaim his
rank in the corps; nor could he ever obtain any effectual
redress, but was afterwards compelled to come in as a junior
captain of the corps, though with his proper rank in the army. The
difference this made, in regard to his promotion, was, that he died
a captain instead of a colonel-commandant,&mdash;his rank in the
army being merely brevet. He bad then the mortification of finding,
that, after ten years distinguished service in the infancy of a
colony, and to the sacrifice of every real comfort, his only reward
had been the loss of many years' rank,&mdash;a vital injury to an
officer. A remark which his wounded feelings wrung from him, at the
close of the second volume of his history of the settlement,
appears to have awakened the sympathy of those in power; and he
was, almost immediately after its publication, offered the
government of the projected settlement on Van-Dieman's Land, which
he accepted, and sailed, once more for that quarter of the globe,
where he founded his new colony; struggled with great difficulties,
which he overcame; and, after remaining there eight years, was
enjoying the flourishing state his-exertions had produced, when he
died suddenly, after a few days' confinement from a slight cold, on
the 24th of March, 1810.<br>
<br>
"His person was remarkably handsome, and his manners extremely
prepossessing; while, to a cultivated understanding, and an early
fondness for the <i>belles lettres</i>, he joined the most cheerful-and
social disposition. How he was esteemed by the inhabitants of the
colony over which he presided, will appear, by the following
extract of a letter announcing his decease:&mdash;'By the death of
Colonel Collins, this colony has sustained a loss it will take a
number of years to get over. I have known and served with him from
the first establishment of the colony; and, when I speak the
feelings of my heart on this melancholy occasion, I am sure that it
is not my single voice, but that of every department whatsoever in
the settlement, who, with the most heartfelt regret, universally
acknowledge him to have been the father and friend of all.'"]</p>

<p>After I had given Governor Collins my advice respecting the
treatment of the government stock, I ordered the coxswain of his
boat to be ready the next morning, at six o'clock. I had my
marl-auger; and Mr. Clark, the superintendent, and my friend Mr.
Carty, embarked with me. We soon got to Herdsman's Cove, the place
where Doctor Mountgarret first made the settlement.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "The first settlement (on the
Derwent&mdash;see note on p. 236) was made in Risdon Cove, in 1803,
by Captain John Bowen, of the navy, who was sent from Port-Jackson
for that purpose, by his Excellency, Governor King; but on the
arrival of Colonel Collins, in 1804, it was removed to Sullivan
Cove."&mdash;Flinders.<br>
<br>
Sullivan Cove is nine miles from the entrance of the Derwent, on
the west side; Risdon Cove is four miles higher up.<br>
<br>
Flinders says, "In the afternoon of the 25th December, 1798, we got
the sloop, (the Norfolk, in which Mr. Bass accompanied him, and
they had discovered Bass's Strait, and that Van-Dieman's Land was
an island,) with much difficulty, five or six miles further up the
river, (Derwent,) to an inlet which I called Herdsman's Cove, from
the pastoral appearance of the surrounding country. Two streams
fall into it; and up the principal one, in the north-east corner, I
went two miles with the boat. The water was there found fresh, and
the depth sufficient to allow of its being reached by the sloop;
but the banks being steep and channel narrow, I was deterred from
watering in this place, by the fear of detention from foul
winds.<br>
<br>
"The width of the Derwent abreast of Herdsman's Cove, is
half-a-mile; but except a very narrow channel, close to the
eastern shore, it is too shallow even for boats. The intention of
proceeding further with the sloop, was therefore abandoned; but so
soon as the rainy blowing weather permitted, which was not until
the 28th, I accompanied Mr. Bass in a boat excursion up the river.
Three miles above Herdsman's Cove, the banks open out to a mile in
width; the river, from running north-westward, turns to the
south-west; and the deep channel makes a short cut across to the
convex bank, leaving the mud to collect in the opposite elbow. A
great deal of long aquatic grass growing upon these mud flats,
seemed to have attracted the black swans, for the number Collected
there was not estimated at less than five hundred.<br>
<br>
"The width of the Derwent is contracted in the southwest reach to
little more than a quarter-of-a-mile, and we had not rowed far up
it before the water became perfectly fresh. The land, on both
sides, rises to hills of moderate elevation, and the rather steep
acclivities being well clothed with verdure, they had an agreeable
appearance."<br>
<br>
After advancing five, miles above this elbow of the Derwent,
Flinders and his enterprising companion returned to their little
vessel.]</p>

<p>I went ashore here, and followed the course of a fresh-water
river, or rather brook, and I found very nice land along its banks;
but it did not continue so far as to tempt a settler to take a farm
there. I ordered the boatmen to row about four miles up the Great
River, and I told them that I would fire two shots within a minute
when I wanted them. I ranged through the forest, and, as I had
brought two grey-hounds with me, I had a nice chase after a
kangaroo-rat, which is an animal nearly as large as a hare. The
dogs killed her, and I shot a wood-duck. The claws of this bird
enable it to perch on the boughs of trees, and, at the same time,
it has the power of diving under water like a duck, and the plumage
is nearly the same. I made the man who attended us carry my game.
After this much sport, I began to lean towards the Great River; in
doing which, we came to a beautiful spring of water, by the side
whereof I sat down, and with Mr. Clark, and my friend Mr. Carty,
took some refreshment. We soon set forward, and met the boat. Mr.
Clark wished to return, and I was very glad of it; he went back by
land, and Mr. Carty and I proceeded on in the boat.</p>

<p>At the next fresh water stream that I perceived emptying itself
into the main river, I went ashore, and finding some good looking
land, applied my marl-auger to it. I found black mellow earth, of a
very good appearance. Having given orders to the boat as before, I
took out my pocket compass and directed my course due north, for
about two miles'; I then altered it, and began to make for the
river again; but I could not find above a hundred acres of good
land in connexion. Upon again embarking, we started a fine flock of
black swans.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[20 December 1805]</p>

<p>It was the 20th of December, and at that season the swans all go
up the river, until their wings get quills, which they drop in this
month.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Flinders, who visited Van Dieman's Land, in
December 1798, remarks that, "out of the flocks of black swans,
from one-fifth to one-tenth of them were unable to fly; and since
the same thing has been found to obtain in the months of January
and May, as well as in October, it is probably so at all times of
the year."]</p>

<p>"We came up with this flock, but only took one of them. Soon
alter we saw a very pretty stream of strong running water, coming
down out of a glen about two miles beyond Dromedary Mountain. I
made the boatmen row for the bank, and making fast the boat there,
we all went ashore. I tried the ground, and found it to be a black
sandy loam. I liked it much, but the question was how far it
extended. I made what observations I thought necessary, after
examining about two miles square, and laid down a plan of it, as
well as I was able. On our return to the boat, the dogs started and
killed a small kangaroo, the men soon paunched it, and we set out
towards. Alum Rock.</p>

<p>When it was about five o'clock, I thought it better to go ashore,
and to make up our fire for the night. Accordingly, we drew up our
boat, and having lit a fire, one of the men plucked the swan, and
another skinned the kangaroo; the duck and rat remained for the
morning. Our camp-kettle was put on with a piece of salt pork in
it, and after we had enjoyed ourselves, we all lay down, and slept
soundly until the morning.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[21 December 1805]</p>

<p>Perceiving a considerable mountain at the distance of about four
miles, I was anxious to get to the top of it, that I might have an
extensive view, and discover the nature of the surrounding country.
I therefore made the boatmen row me under the butt of this
mountain, and landing, I began to advance up the side; it took me
two hours to reach the top. There I sat down, and I saw the finest
looking country eyes ever beheld. The land at both sides of the
river was very flat, and free from timber, the river was very wide,
and the mountain that I was upon was soft, sandy ground, which rose
higher than Table Mountain, or Mount Dromedary.* I took a glass of
rum, and called it Mount Casha. We thought the plains below us were
too far for us to attempt to explore, as we could not bring the
boat on with us, a rocky ledge running across the river from one
side to the other, which prevented our passage.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Flinders, in 1798, says, "The banks of the
Derwent are not remarkably high, but the country in general may be
termed mountainous. Mount Table, at the back of Sullivan Cove, is
supposed to be three quarter of a mile in height; nor do I think,
from having seen it beyond the distance of thirty miles from the
sloop's deck, that it can be much less."]</p>

<p>We next proceeded towards Alum Rock; it is a bluff rock, about
forty feet above the level of the river, and the alum very
clear.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[23 December 1805]</p>

<p>On my return I had an unsatisfactory account for the Governor. I
went to him, and reported that there appeared to me to be several
good single farms, but no place of sufficient extent to answer for
a large settlement. I described to him Mount Casha, and the plains
that I saw from the summit of the mountain. He said he would send a
party to explore these plains, and to examine the river; and he
remarked, that if I could remain a week longer, he would request me
to proceed to Pit Water plains; but the ship had moved to Frederick
Henry Bay, and fearing that I might miss my passage in her, I
thought it better to follow her. The Governor proposed to me to
come and live with him, and he offered to make me superintendent
over the government stock, and cultivation, promising at the same
time, to give me as much land as I desired, besides a town grant,
and every encouragement that a man could expect; "for," said he, "I
might as well have two old women as the present superintendents, to
arrange and conduct business that is of vital importance to the
well-being of the settlement."</p>

<p>I told his Excellency, that as I had a good deal of horned
cattle, and stock, it would be troublesome for me to remove.</p>

<p>He instantly said in reply. "I will soon manage that; for I will
make Governor King take your stock in New South Wales, and I will
give you full value for them here." And Governor Collins did write
to Governor King to make this request, viz. that he would take my
stock and grain at a fair valuation, and send my family down to Van
Dieman's Land. When the Rev. Mr. Marsden came to inform me of this,
that Governor Collins had written for me, my wife was not satisfied
to move; so I declined going, and the day that I did so, was a bad
day for me, as I might soon have made a fortune under Governor
Collins; but having one hundred and ten acres of land, and good
beginnings of every kind of stock, I thought it better not to go
against my wife's inclination, and as Mr. Marsden said that
Governor King would not remain long in the colony.</p>

<p>My parting conversation with Governor Collins, was on the 23rd
day of December 1807.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This 1807, in Holt's manuscript, must have
been intended for 1805, for he particularly mentions his
conversation with Governor King, after his return to New South
Wales; and Captain King was superseded in the government by Captain
Bligh, on the 13th of August, 1806. "The little rebellion," also,
as Holt calls it, by which Governor Bligh was deposed, occurred on
the 25th of January, 1808. That 1807 is an error, also appears from
Holt's own assertion, that he was away from New South Wales
twenty-two months and two days. Now he has stated that he left the
colony on the 19th of April, (1804); that he reached Norfolk Island
on the 19th of May; and he says that he was fourteen weeks and two
days treated as a convict, after which he lived about fifteen
months as a free man on the island, which makes the time of his
departure from thence, November 1805. The month of December,
therefore, in that year, was passed by him at the Derwent, and his
return to Port Jackson, must have been in February, 1806.]</p>

<p>Leaving the town of Derwent, with all my little goods in a boat,
a storm arose as we were passing Betsey's Island, which obliged us
to go ashore until the weather moderated, and we did not make
Frederick Henry Bay until six o'clock in the evening. It lies
twenty-four miles from the town. I got my little property safely on
board.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[25 December 1805]</p>

<p>On the 25th, being Christmas day, I had many serious thoughts
about my wife and family.</p>

<p>A party going ashore from the ship, to cook their dinner, and
dine on the island, near which we were at anchor, sergeant McGawley
and sergeant Thorn asked me to join them, and I accepted their
invitation. The island was called Desolate Island, and indeed I,
thought so, although we had a good dinner and plenty to drink.
After dinner a black American, who was one of the party, played
upon the vial, and Thorn had his flute, so that we did not want
music to make us enjoy ourselves in this forlorn place. After we
returned on board, we had a great dance with all the sailors.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[29 December 1805]</p>

<p>Captain Forrest having got his oil on board, and stowed below,
sailed on the 29th for St. Groof.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[7 January 1806]</p>

<p>On the 7th January we got in the Groof. The land is in the form
of two half sickles, with a passage between them. We had only ten
tons of oil to take in, and while this was shipping, sergeant
McGawley, Thomas William Keilly, one Johnson, and myself, went
ashore. The morning was remarkably fine, and there was not the
slightest appearance of an approaching storm. We brought a leash of
greyhounds with us, and had some noble sport, killing two
kangaroos, and shooting some ducks. We suddenly saw the ship move,
and immediately this was followed by a hurricane that almost drove
her out of the water; she had dragged her anchors, and in another
minute would have been lost, but for black Charles, who dropped the
bower anchor, and saved her. The boat, which was sent for us only
ten minutes before, was stove in pieces; another boat was manned,
and succeeded in picking up the crew, and having put them on board,
came to take us off,, which was no trifling undertaking, for the
swell was so great that the rise and fall of every sea was twenty
feet; after great exertion and peril, we reached the ship, and she
got out to sea, running fourteen knots an hour under bare poles,
with only her stay-sail set, to keep her steady. The current ran so
strong, that it carried us through Banks' and Bass's Straits, and
then we fell in with the land of New Holland. Soon after, a great
fog came on, in which we overshot Sydney Head, and ran down to New
Castle [Newcastle], at the Coal River, where the fog cleared off.
Having tacked, we made the Head about nine in the morning, and at
twelve dropped anchor off Sydney.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. In Sydney Again</h2>

<p class="date-jnl">[5 February 1806]</p>

<p>I went on shore immediately, and the first man I met was Richard
Cheers, one of my old butchers. We had a glass together. I then
went to Mathew Kearns, and ordered him to get a chaise ready, and
in one hour and twenty minutes I was in Parramatta. John Rediton
drove the chaise from Sydney. I went into James Larra's Hotel, and
had a bottle of Madeira. Rediton returned with the chaise, and I
walked over to Mount Hester, which was only a mile and a half from
Parramatta. I was not seen or recognized by any one, until I was in
the court before my own door. The dogs began to bark at me, and
Mrs. Holt came to the door. The sight&mdash;the unexpected sight of
me completely overpowered her with joy, and she swooned away. I ran
forward, and took her up in my arms; she fainted a second time.
Pleasure and sorrow, however differently they may affect the heart,
are alike overpowering to the human frame. Twenty-two months and
two days had we been separated, which was a long time for a man and
his wife who were fond of each other, and who had always lived in
love and harmony together, to be parted. My two children clung with
their arms round my neck, crying with joy at seeing their father
once more, and on their little knees they gave their curses to
Governor King, for separating me from them. My men, hearing of my
arrival, which was soon spoken of, all left their work to welcome
me home. I was tired with the questions which were asked of me. And
I think we all passed that night in talking about, and thinking of,
Norfolk Island and the Derwent.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[6 February 1806]</p>

<p>Next morning, I had as many visitors to see me, as I had on my
return to Dublin, after being out of Ireland fifteen years, three
months and five days. I went to view my stock, and found a great
increase of every kind. My cows had the liberty of running with
Captain Kent's herd. He was the only gentleman that had an English
bull in the country. He and I were well acquainted before I was
banished to Norfolk Island, so he allowed my stock to run with his,
although for the stock of any other person in the colony, he
charged three guineas for each cow. This gentleman was Port Captain
of Sydney Harbour; he had married a niece of Governor Hunter's.
Mrs. Kent was an excellent woman, beloved of every one. I must say
this, and I say it with considerable pride, that I had many good
friends in New South Wales. The gentlemen of the country knew that
I had been sent away for a crime of which I was innocent, and
they did not disguise their feelings, by their conduct towards my
poor wife and young family.</p>

<p>In the course of a few days, during which I had arranged various
matters, his Excellency, Governor King, sent for me. I waited on
him accordingly, and thanked him for allowing me to return to my
family. And I have this proud consolation, that he told me with his
own lips, HE WAS SORRY I HAD BEEN UNJUSTLY PUNISHED!</p>

<p>Governor King was further pleased to say, that he would
hereafter be my friend.</p>

<p>I replied that "it was too late to offer physic to a dead man."
Nor could I restrain myself from making impertinent answers to his
Excellency.</p>

<p>He inquired how I liked Norfolk Island?</p>

<p>I said, "I have no objection to either the ground or the
climate, but I despise the inhabitants, and above all, their late
head."</p>

<p>The Governor said, "Mr. Holt, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean. Sir," I replied, "Major Foveaux. It is not my way to
assert what I do not mean. He, Sir, had no right to put me to hard
labour. You, Sir, gave me an emancipation order, which made me a
free subject. Nothing criminal was proved against me, when I was
under trial, and witness after witness were produced; nothing
criminal could be proved against me. It was your passion, Sir, and
no other cause, that banished me to Norfolk Island. You have acted
contrary to the laws of Great Britain. Remember, Sir, that I never
was a convict, and as long as I conducted myself as a peaceable
subject, I was under the protection of those laws. I was sent here
a state prisoner, not a convict. But to gratify k your love of
arbitrary power, you consigned me to the iron fangs of a monster
worse than that Ogre the seed of Abarcurtinea, and the offspring of
the Patagonians, that eat human flesh, and drink blood. He put me
to hard labour, to try if it would break my heart, and only for
Doctor Wentworth, would my life have been the sacrifice; but he
will be tried in a court where there are no stags or informers.
When the last trumpet shall sound, and all men must give an account
of themselves, when their Judge, the great and impartial though
merciful Judge of the universe, will have, the actions of all men
laid before him, without the crafty devices of councillors to
disguise the truth; then, I say, the case of the poor man, and even
the convict,, will be fairly considered. We are all. Sir, creatures
of clay, and, there will be at that last solemn day, no distinction
of persons. The highest and the lowest must give an equally strict
account of themselves, and from those to whom most is given, will
most be expected."</p>

<p>The Governor heard me patiently to the end, and then told me
that he never gave orders to put me to labour. He then said that he
thought I might turn preacher, instead of Crookes, who was a little
swaddling fellow, that taught in the school at Parramatta. The
Governor concluded by saying, "Go home, Mr. Holt, and beware of
rocks and quicksands;" which latter words he repeated three times
over, and then asked me if I knew what he meant?</p>

<p>I told him, very coolly, that I could not be certain what he
meant, but I believed what he intended to say was to warn me from
keeping bad company.</p>

<p>He answered, "Yes, I see that you do know."</p>

<p>Upon which I bowed and departed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. Oranges and Cattle</h2>

<p>I had, in my plantation, as many peaches as would make me five
hundred gallons of cider.* I therefore sent for my carpenter, and
desired him to make me a cider-press, which was completed and ready
when the fruit was ripe.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Dr. Lang, in his account of New South Wales,
recently published, (1834), tells us that peaches abound
everywhere; and that the fruit is "so abundant as to constitute a
considerable part of the food of the colonial pig, in the peach
season. Peaches are sold in Sydney market by the basket or, bushel,
at from fifteen pence to two shillings and six pence."</p>

<p>"If a peach-stone," adds the doctor, "is thrown into the ground
in a favourable situation, in New South Wales, a large quantity of
fruit may be gathered from the tree, that shortly after shoots up
from it, without any subsequent culture, at the expiration of the
third or fourth year."]</p>

<p>I began to pound my peaches, and to get the pipes and hogsheads
in order. I made my cider and had got it into my cellar, and then I
began to think of converting it into the best use to benefit my
family. Peach cider sold then at Parramatta, for nine, pence a
quart, but ten gallons of cider made one gallon of brandy, several
degrees above proof; so as I had Doctor Balmain's* still by me,
ever since I had bought his farm and stock for Mr. Cox, I thought
it a better plan for me to make some brandy, as I would then get my
money in a considerable sum, instead of by small instalments.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Collins mentions, that in September, 1796,
"the Rev. Mr. Johnson, and William Balmain, Esq. were nominated the
acting magistrates, in the district of the town of Sydney."]</p>

<p>I must admit that I knew it was a breach of a general order to
do what I intended, but as I had sustained so much loss by being
innocently sent away, and as no offer of remuneration had been made
to me, I did not consider that it was any great crime for me to
make the most I could of the produce of my own farm. Thus it ever
is, one illegal act is sure to be followed by another; and if
either deserve punishment, is it not the first' which led to the
second aggression? Justice is even-handed.</p>

<p>After some consideration about a convenient place to establish
my still, as I dared not have it in my house, I determined upon a
spot at a little distance, which was called the Rocks of Jerusalem.
Here I fixed my casks, with the still, and as the water came off
the rock into my flake stand, and I had a small brook to take away
my feints, I soon made twenty gallons, which I sold for fifty
pounds, spirits selling at that time, in the r public houses of the
colony, at five shillings the half-pint. I repeated the same
process again, and when I conveyed it away, I rode in my cart,
sitting on the kegs with my blunderbuss loaded in my hand; for I
was determined not to let my home manufacture be taken by any of
the rascally constables, who were as great cowards, as they were
tyrants. I' continued to make and sell until I had consumed all my
cider. I then bought five hundred weight of sugar, and put it into
my casks to ferment, mixing half a gallon of water with every pound
weight of sugar. By which process, twelve pounds of sugar produced
one gallon of good rum. I made my composition with half-ground
wheat for backen, as we had no oatmeal, and it took ten or fifteen
days to prepare it fit for distilling.</p>

<p>While this was going forward at the Rocks of Jerusalem, I went
up to the Hawkesbury to see some of my cows, that were among Mr.
Cox's cattle; and passing by the house of Lieutenant Cummings, he
hailed me, and reproached me for not calling in to see him, as I
passed. I replied, that I did not know where he lived.</p>

<p>He made me alight, put up my mare, and come into his house. In
the course of conversation he then said, "I wish you had come a
week later." I asked the reason; observing, that I thought a visit
one week was as good as another.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "it only makes this difference, that next week I
should have had some good rum made."</p>

<p>He then showed me his fixtures in so free a manner, that he
threw me completely off my guard, and I told him that I was at the
same game myself. He appeared not in the least surprised, and
merely remarked, "You have a very fine place to carry on your
distillery in the rocks."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "Jerusalem Rock is an excellent place."</p>

<p>He asked me in what part I had fixed my still, and I told him
the precise spot. The very night I commenced working, he gave
information, and I was caught. My men and son had just began, and
about half-a-gallon of singlins had run at the time of this
surprise. I was walking down towards the rocks, when a
light-horseman and two constables seized me; one of whom, putting a
pistol to my head, said, "If you speak one word, I will blow your
brains out."</p>

<p>I answered, "You damned rascals, what are you about?" and I said
this in so loud a voice, that my men heard me, and started off. The
light-horseman fired at them across the brook; and my son, who had
seized the blunderbuss and levelled it at the horseman, would have
fired in return, if he had not happily thought that he might kill
me as well as those by whom I was arrested. My son escaped, but my
two men were taken prisoners; and Oakes, the head constable,
brought me and my men before Major Abbott.</p>

<p>Upon our appearing before the major, he demanded of Oakes, how
he dared to bring me at that hour, and in that manner, as a
prisoner. "You know very well," said he, "that Mr. Holt would have
come in the morning."</p>

<p>"I certainly would have done so, major, if ordered," was my
reply.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "go home, and come in to me at nine o'clock
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>I wished Major Abbott a good night, and returned home. My poor
wife was full of lamentations, as usual. "Now, my dear," said she,
"you will be taken away from me again."</p>

<p>I told her she need not be alarmed, for that they could do
nothing more to me than put me under bail not to distil again for
one year, as this was the law in the colony at that time. I began
then to consider what defence I could make, or what I should say. I
might have denied that I was engaged in distilling, as I was taken
twenty perches from the still; but then my poor men would certainly
be flogged, and that would make them accuse me! I reasoned with
myself, and I saw no scandal nor fraud in what I had done, which
should induce me to deny the truth, or feel ashamed of my
conduct.</p>

<p>The following morning I walked into Parramatta, where I met
Major Abbott. "Well, Mr. Holt," said he, "you are never to be out
of trouble." I laughed, and so did the major. "This is a bad job,"
he added.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said I, "it is bad enough; but it is not also a
scandalous one. I have defrauded no one, and there is no treason
that I can see in a man making the most of his own property.
However, as far as you may consider it a crime, I am guilty,
although I was not upon the spot when the seizure took place. To
save you the trouble of enquiry and examination into this business,
Major Abbott," I continued, "I am here ready to admit that I am the
person who was carrying on the distillery, and I therefore hope
that you will order my two men, who are in gaol, to be discharged.
They were my servants, and obeyed my orders; and, if I had to lose
my life for it, no other man should be punished for my crime or
fault."</p>

<p>The major looked at me for some time before he spoke. "Well,
Holt," said he, "you are a fine-spirited fellow I know, and, I
believe, an honest man. You have, however, acted with so much
candour in this business, that I will ever after think well of
you."</p>

<p>I thanked the major for his favourable opinion of me, remarking
that, in the course of my life, I never knew any good to come of
shuffling; for that I had always observed, it only made a bad
matter worse, and that I would hate myself to the end of my life,
if I allowed my men to be flogged for my misdeed. He told me that
he would promise me the men should not be flogged, but that he was
afraid they would be taken from me; and so they, were, and all
indulgence that Government had given me was stopped.</p>

<p>Major Abbott desired that I would attend the court on the
following Saturday, bringing the two men with me, who would be
required to get bail in the sum of one hundred pounds each, and
myself in the sum of two hundred pounds sterling, that I would not
distil any spirits for one year. I thanked the major for his
conduct towards me, and returned home, where I ordered my mare to
be saddled, and then went to the Seven Hills, to see my old friend
John O'Mara. I told him the business, and he promised to come
forward as one of my bail. I then went to the Pennant Hills, and
asked John William John, a Welshman, to be my other bail, which he
consented to, and we passed our bond for the four hundred pounds;
the nature of which was, that I was not to distil any spirits for
one whole year. When the bond was signed, I observed, that "I was
not sorry that I was bound only for one year, as on to-morrow
twelve months I could begin again to distil."</p>

<p>Major Abbott laughed, and told me, that, if I did so, I had
better not let any Irishman again into my secret. Cummings was the
informer, and Hugh Byrne also gave information against me. This
Hugh Byrne was a driver* in the county of Wicklow; he lived in
Ballynabarney; near Ballinderry, and was nicknamed Hugh Yesty.
Cummings was in want of his breakfast before I left the colony; and
Byrne was cast for death for stealing government cows; but was
respited, and transported to the Coal River for his life. This I
have, from my son's letter, since I left the colony. Byrne was a
first cousin of Michael Dwyer, commonly called Captain Dwyer.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A trade unfortunately too well known in
Ireland, although probably the term will not be understood in
England. A driver, means a person employed to distrain or drive the
cattle from a farm, for the taxes, rent, or tithe; hence Byrne's
soubriquet, Vesty, from bear, a collection, tribute, or tax.]</p>

<p>I never attempted to distil any more; for I clearly saw, let me
do it as secretly as I could, it would be sure to be found out. And
a new law was made, by which any one taken in the act of
distilling, was to be transported for three years to the Coal
River; the land where the distillery was carried on, to be
confiscated to the crown; the horse and cart which conveyed spirits
distilled in the colony, to be seized and sold; any house in which
such spirits were disposed of to be fined, and those who drank the
spirits to be imprisoned. Yet, notwithstanding this severe law,
distilling was not suppressed, the temptation being so great, in
the enormous profit to be obtained, by the sale of spirits. The
cause of the great price of spirits, and of the attempt to suppress
the private distillation in the colony, which was produced thereby,
may be fairly stated as owing to the monopoly obtained by some of
the chief persons at Sydney, who were in a combination, by which
they made enormous fortunes; to the great misery of the large mass
of the settlers. These gentlemen would purchase an entire cargo of
spirits, and put it into their stores. For a few weeks after the
arrival of this cargo, they would sell it at two pounds ten
shillings a gallon, and then would raise the price to three pounds
a gallon,&mdash;indeed, I have known spirits sell at four pounds
the gallon; yet these gentlemen bought this spirit at ten shillings
the gallon. So seductive an article was spirits, that the poor and
the feeble-minded could not resist its purchase at any price, and
they therefore became the victims of imposition.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Mann, in his observations upon the trade and
manufactures of New South Wales, says, "Spirits are also bought up
with astonishing rapidity, and, when prohibited, will ever be
obtained by some means or other; and I have known it to sell as
high as thirty shillings per bottle; the general price by the
retailer, however, is from ten to sixteen shillings per bottle.
Most of the people in the colony, male and female, give way to
excessive drinking. It is to no purpose that the higher orders set
examples of sobriety and temperance; it is of no avail that the
Governor uses every prudent exertion to restrain the immoderate
traffic in these pernicious liquors; threats, entreaties, and
punishments are equally useless, and, while spirits are to be
procured, the inhabitants will possess them at the price of every
other comfort of life."</p>

<p>Enormous as the cost of spirits was in New South Wales, there
was more drank there than in any part of the world that I know of;
and it is my opinion, that to this infatuation, much of the crime
in the colony may be attributed. It may be thought a strange idea,
but it is my honest conviction, that if spirits were to be had at a
moderate price in New South Wales, there would be less
intoxication, and consequently less crime. Drunkenness, according
to my view of human nature, would soon work its own cure; it is the
love of drinking that is so dangerous, and love, I have observed,
is always increased in proportion to the difficulties it has to
encounter. We seldom prize that which is easy of acquisition.</p>

<p>Having given up all idea of again risking my peace of mind by
distilling, I began to till my ground, to attend to my stock, and
to collect in the debts that were due to me. One morning, as I was
walking in my orchard, a man came to my house, and, enquiring for
me, my wife told him where he would find me. He asked me whether I
would buy a couple of young heifers, if I got them cheap? I told
him that I had no objection; adding, "Who is it that has got those
heifers to sell?"</p>

<p>He replied, "Dick Troy."</p>

<p>"Why, has Troy heifers to sell?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the man, "he can sell two every month."</p>

<p>"Has he any of his own?" said I.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the man; "but he is herd in the Government
stock-yard, and when a cow or two calves, he need not return the
calves, and then he has more than the number that is in the book
with Mr. Jamieson, the superintendent over the stock."</p>

<p>I listened to the fellow, and thought that there was some scheme
in this, which I could not fathom; for I had known the rascal for
some years, and he had been under my care, as a Government-man to
Mr. Cox. His name was James Staines; and both Troy and he were from
the county of Kildare. I made him no reply, and he went away.</p>

<p>When I came in, my wife asked me what this man wanted; I told
her, and she instantly said, "My dear, depend upon it, this is some
plot to endeavour to get you hanged." I replied, "Never fear that,
nothing shall ever make a thief of me." As I walked about, I began
to think upon the matter, and, turning it over in my mind, it
appeared to me very like a plan to entrap me; for otherwise, I
thought the fellow would never have the impudence to come so openly
to ask me to buy heifers which belonged to the Government. I walked
into Parramatta, and meeting Mr. Marsden, told him word for word
what had passed, with my opinion of Staines. Mr. Marsden desired me
to stop, and he would mention it to the Governor, by whom I was
soon sent for. His Excellency questioned me as to everything that I
knew concerning this Staines, and advised me to buy the two heifers
from him and Troy.</p>

<p>I replied that I did not wish to do so.</p>

<p>The Governor said that I must buy the heifers.</p>

<p>My answer to this was,&mdash;that as yet an offer at a crime
only had been made, but that, if I purchased, the crime would be
complete; and that it was a capital crime, by the commission of
which, the lives of these two men would become forfeited to the
law. Moreover, I added, to be the receiver of stolen goods, as well
as the informer, would be an everlasting stain upon my character;
for the world would believe that I had bought these heifers for my
own gain.</p>

<p>The Governor then pledged me his solemn word and honour, that
the lives of these men should not be forfeited; and said that he
desired their prosecution, to prove to the authorities and those in
office how necessary it was to be vigilant in their duty. At last,
I thought that his Excellency began to doubt the truth of my story,
from my unwillingness to act as he desired; and that I had
fabricated a tale to get myself into favour, as many had done
before me. I said that if I bought the heifers I should be
countenancing thieves, and that the whole world should never make a
thief of me. The Governor, however, pressed me so much, that at
last I promised him that I would enquire of these men further about
the matter, and how they could so easily dispose of the Government
stock.</p>

<p>I went accordingly, and saw both Troy and Staines. I looked at
the cattle, and enquired the price that they wanted for the two
heifers; which was twenty pounds a head. The Government price would
have been twenty-eight pounds; so that the profit on the two to the
purchaser would have been only sixteen pounds sterling, with
perhaps the addition of ten pounds of rope into the bargain, and a
disgrace for ever to his name.</p>

<p>I asked Troy how I was to get these heifers into my herd? James
Staines, who was a very inventive rogue, and was never at a loss
for an expedient, suggested, that if I would go to the Hawkesbury
and drive my cattle home, he and Troy would meet me on the way, and
would put the two heifers into my herd. On my return to Parramatta,
I related to Mr. Marsden the conversation that I had with these two
fellows, and the plan they proposed to me.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mr. Marsden, "I will inform the Governor."</p>

<p>The result was, that I received orders to follow up the business.
Captain Houston, of the ship <i>Buffalo</i>,* was in the room at
the time, and he asked me if I wanted money to pay for the cattle?
"No, sir," I replied, "I do not; I have money enough of my own."
Captain Houston then said, "Show me some of the notes, then, until
I mark them." I gave him notes to the amount of twenty-five pounds,
and he marked them.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In the volumes bearing Barrington's name, it
is remarked, that "This ship, notwithstanding she was named the
<i>Buffalo</i>, had at her head a carved figure of a kangaroo, with
which the natives appeared very much pleased, not expecting to see
the animals of their country represented by us in wood."]</p>

<p>The following morning I went to Mr. Cox's, and drew my cattle
out of his herd, and drove them towards home. On my way I met
Captain Houston and the boatswain of the Buffalo, and they passed
me by. I had not driven on my herd much farther, when I met
Staines; he got before me, and turned my cows off the road into the
forest, and it gave me as much as I could do to keep in sight of
Staines and the cattle. After two miles chase, Staines met Troy and
the Government herd, and Troy turned two heifers into my herd; and
then Staines drove the Government cattle through the forest,
towards Parramatta. Captain Houston, who was at hand, now came up
and seized Staines, and took the notes out of his pocket. He looked
at them, and then said, "You got those notes from Holt?" Staines
answered that he did not; but Captain Houston having marked them,
was sufficient proof of that fact. Troy and Staines were both sent
for the next morning, and put into confinement.</p>

<p>As an example, the Governor had them both tried; and they were
found guilty of a crime for which they ought to have been hanged,
but I had his word of honour for their lives.</p>

<p>Robbery is a bad trade; for it generally ends by the gallows,
and is also the cause of leading others to the same end. I remember
a man in New South Wales, who, to my own knowledge, had four
hundred acres of land, one hundred head of cattle, several hundred
sheep, and some of the best horses and mares in the colony. I have
seen his son ride his own mare, and win fifty guineas, on the
race-course of New South Wales. This unfortunate-man,&mdash;but I
will also say, that he was a man not to be pitied,&mdash;bought a
cow from the Government-stock for twelve pounds, well knowing that
he was trafficking in what was stolen. The beast was soon
discovered by the brand of the broad-arrow, and the man was
apprehended and committed to gaol. When he found out the person who
was to be his prosecutor for buying this cow, knowing that, she was
the property of the crown, he formed a plan for his son and his
brother to lay in wait for the prosecutor, and shoot him. It would
be too tedious to explain the manner in which it happened, that the
man, upon whose life this design was formed, came to be shot by
Pierce Collet, who, in a few moments afterwards, was joined by the
two Kearns. The three of them, however, were hung for the murder;
and Mathew Kearns, the man who bought the cow, and possessed all
the land and stock that I have mentioned, was hanged also. Now, the
disgraceful death of four men, and the murder of another, was
caused by the desire of robbing Government of four pounds; as old
Kearns could have bought the cow for sixteen pounds. At his
shameful exit, his estate and stock, were valued at nine thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>However, I am of opinion that a man born to be hanged must die
by the gallows, at a particular minute. How otherwise, indeed,
could I have escaped the halter? And as for Kearns, since he was
hanged, there have been no less than fourteen men tried for buying
Government cattle, and cast for death, not one of whom was
executed; they were either respited and transported to the Coal
River for life, or pardoned.</p>

<p>The ship <i>Tillicherry</i> arrived in Port Jackson, with Irish
prisoners; among others came Michael Dwyer, commonly known by the
name of Captain Dwyer, in the County of Wicklow, after my
departure.* There were also Martin Burke, John Merrinna, Arthur
Dwyer and Hugh Byrne. These five transports had made terms with
Government, and got paid for going to New South Wales. According to
their conduct, they were to receive the encouragement and
indulgence of free settlers. Upon their landing, Governor King gave
each man one hundred acres of land, at George's River.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Dwyer, "the Wicklow desperado," has been
before mentioned in a note, vol. i. p. 157. "Dwyer the noted rebel
leader, more cruel than Hacket, or Holt, and who had been the
occasion of many atrocious murders near Baltinglass, obtained,"
according to Sir Richard Musgrave, "a protection from General
Moore, in 1798, and remained for some time in his camp, corrupting
his soldiers, and yet for more than two years he bids defiance to
the king's troops, and keeps the inhabitants of a large tract of
the County of Wicklow, in terror and dismay."<br>
<br>
"After the rebellion of 1798," says Mr. Wright, in his guide to the
County of Wicklow, "a few of the outlaws remained concealed in the
fastnesses of the Wicklow mountains, and with these the government
thought proper to capitulate, rather than continue so difficult a
pursuit, with so little success, as it had hitherto been attended
with. The most celebrated offender was Dwyer, better known as the
Wicklow desperado; being closely pursued, for several days, by a
body of Highlanders, he took shelter in St. Kevin's bed, and having
fallen asleep, the Highlanders had nearly come upon him by
surprise; however, he had just sufficient time to leap from the
cave into the lake, and ultimately reached the opposite shore, in
safety, accoutred as he was. The Highlanders found it impossible to
carry their muskets with them along the difficult path-way, so that
Dwyer was permitted to make towards the opposite land, without
molestation."<br>
<br>
With reference to this occurrence, the following dialogue is said
to have taken place, when the late Lord Norbury visited
Glendalough. Upon that facetious Judge inquiring for St. Kevin's
bed, it was pointed out by his Lordship's guide, as "that hole in
the rock."<br>
<br>
The comment was, "Oh, I see. The saint was a holy man; fond of
being rocked to sleep. Eh?"<br>
<br>
"I have hard (<i>heard</i>) so, my lord."<br>
<br>
"Hard lying, no doubt," observed the Judge, "just the den for a
Rockite."<br>
<br>
"Indeed, then, your lordship, before Captain Rock's time, the rebel
Dwyer used to shelter himself in the bed&mdash;Captain O'Dwyer, I
mean; and mighty proud he was of that same great O. Sure he would
write it before his name so large, that it looked among the other
letters, just like a turkey's egg in a hen's nest."<br>
<br>
"Very strange retreat for a rebel, with so much orange liking (
lichen) about the cliff."<br>
<br>
"'Tis true, for you, my right honourable lord, and the orange men
were near taking Dwyer."<br>
<br>
"Aye, near making a D'Oyer and Terminer business of it?"<br>
<br>
"But, please your lordship, Dwyer leaped into the water, like a
fairy?"<br>
<br>
"A complete leperchaun, that rascal."<br>
<br>
"And a party of soldiers, my lord, on the top of the
cliff&mdash;"<br>
<br>
"What&mdash;Highlanders?"<br>
<br>
"They were so, please your lordship, and when they fired at Dwyer,
he dived like a duck."<br>
<br>
"Yes; ducked, and so got off scot free?"<br>
<br>
"Oh! 'twas all right enough with him; he was up again, winking his
eye at the smoke."<br>
<br>
"Smoked them, did he?&mdash;Did not like their invitation to a
Caledonian ball? There are divers other stories about your lake, no
doubt?"<br>
<br>
"Plenty, my lord; there's one by Moore."<br>
<br>
"No more at present&mdash;that will do. Moore's songs haunt me, as
if I had murdered them in singing."<br>
<br>
"On the 14th of December, 1809, Dwyer, worn out, and nearly hunted
down by the activity of his pursuers,' is stated to have
surrendered himself to Captain Hume, having previously stipulated
that his life should be spared, and his wife and children should be
the companions of his days in exile."]</p>

<p>My eldest son, being now twenty-one years of age, desired to get
a farm for his stock which I gave him; and he went to the Governor,
and asked him for this indulgence. His Excellency gave him a grant
of land, of one hundred acres, adjoining to the grants which he had
given to those five Irishmen. I soon raised a house, and built
stock-yards for him upon his farm; and as it was a better place for
feeding stock, than where I lived, I removed to it myself, with my
family and stock. In the course of the first year, I cleared
forty-four acres, and made all sorts of convenient buildings; and I
remained there until I sold my property in New South Wales, and
prepared to leave the colony for Ireland.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>15. A New Governor</h2>

<p>Governor Bligh arrived in the colony, with his daughter, and his
son-in-law. Captain Putland. The Governor was a Post Captain in the
Royal Navy. Governor King, therefore, prepared for his departure,
his time having expired.</p>

<p>We had now a total change in our government; and Captain Bligh,
having received from the Duke of York, instructions concerning the
officers of the military detachment, he ordered the soldiers to be
paid in cash; and Mr. John Birch, who had come out with the
Governor, as Paymaster of the Regiment, and the other officers, had
nothing to live upon but their pay. Government had sent out various
articles, which were placed in his Majesty's stores, to pay the
settlers for the grain and animal flesh, sent in by them for the
support-of the military and convicts; a small charge only of per
centage for the freight being made upon the prime cost. The poor
convict, if he had by his labour earned one bushel of wheat, could
put it into store, and obtain in return any articles that he wanted
for use, in the amount of ten shillings. The settlers, when they
turned into store, pork, beef, mutton or grain, were paid with
goods, for which they were charged very little more than the market
price in England. This made the poor very happy as they had goods
of all kinds at moderate prices, for the use of their families and
workmen. The former practice was to draw from the stores all the
goods, in large quantities, and to pay the soldiers only in
goods; for every ten shillings' worth of which, according to the
value they were delivered at out of the store, the soldiers paid
twenty, and if they objected to this mode of payment, they were
most probably sent to the guard-house, tried by a Court Martial,
for mutiny, and sentenced to imprisonment.</p>

<p>Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp, when a soldier came to him for his
month's pay, would usually accost him with, "Well, what do you
want?"</p>

<p>"I want to be paid. Sir," the soldier would say,</p>

<p>"What will you have?" was always Captain Kemp's answer. "I have
very good tobacco, ten shillings the pound, and good tea at twenty
shillings the pound, prints at eight shillings a yard," and so
on.</p>

<p>If the poor soldier answered, "Sir, I do not want any of your
goods," the Captain's comment was, "You don't! You are a damned
saucy rascal?" Perhaps then the soldier would say, "Sir, if you
please, give me half money, and half goods." But this proposal was
equally objectionable to Captain Kemp, and generally led to his
thundering out, "Begone, you damned mutinous scoundrel, or I'll
send you to the guard-house, and have you flogged for your
impertinence to your officer." The soldier, having no redress,
would take his monthly pay in property, which he did not want, and
then he would endeavour to dispose of what he had received, to some
person who had money; generally selling it for less than half the
price he was charged by his Captain. This system of monopoly and
extortion compelled the soldier to serve his Majesty for half his
nominal pay; I can prove what I assert, as I have often bought
goods from the soldiers myself, upon these terms. It was, I must
confess, very provoking to see the officers draw the goods from the
public store, to traffic in them for their own private gain, which
goods were sent out for the advantage of the settlers, who were
compelled to deal with those huxter officers, for such articles as
they may require, giving them from fifty to five hundred per cent,
profit, and paying in grain.</p>

<p>It thus would happen, that one of these monopolizers, who never
grew a grain, would sometimes have a thousand bushels of wheat to
put in the store; and this was the manner in which all those old
tailors,, and shoemakers, staymakers, man-milliners, tobacconists,
and pedlars, that were called captains and lieutenants, made their
fortunes; by the extortion and the oppression of the soldier, the
settler, and the poor. Any one who doubts what I assert, may
inquire of any soldier who ever belonged to the 102nd regiment of
foot, concerning my statements, and he will find what I say to be
correct. The men are to be fallen in with, in many parts of Ireland
and England.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The following extracts from Dr. Lang's
account of New South Wales, appear to support Holt's assertions.
"In the years 1790 and 1791, a military corps, designated the New
South Wales Corps, which was afterwards embodied as the 102nd
regiment of the line, was raised in England, for the service of the
colony. That service it may naturally be supposed, was not
considered, at so early a period in the history of the colony,
either as the most dignified, or the most enviable in which a
British officer could be engaged; and commissions were consequently
procurable, in the 'New South Wales Corps, on much easier terms
than in certain other military bodies, such as the Guards or the
Blues. It was, therefore, quite possible that gentlemen might have
found their way into that corps, who possessed only in a very
limited degree, that honourable high-mindedness, which should ever
constitute the proud distinction of the British officer; combining,
as he is supposed to do, the elegant accomplishments of the
scholar, with the unexceptionable morals of the reputable citizen,
and holding in equal abhorrence the practices of the pettifogging
dealer, and the profligate] rake. And if such was actually the
case, it was not to be wondered at, that members of the corps I
allude to, should, in process of time, be found sullying their
hands with the slime of colonial pollution, and banding together on
every proper occasion, to maintain by violence, or injustice, what
they had obtained by the sacrifice of honour.' In short, for I have
no wish to be a dealer in enigmas, I am decidedly of opinion, that
the formation of the New South Wales Corps, was, both in a moral
and political sense, the most ill-advised and unfortunate measure
that the British government could, possibly have adopted towards
their infant settlement, on the Coast of New Holland, and that,
like the wrath of Achilles to the Greeks, it entailed ten thousand
sorrows on the colony of New South Wales."<br>
<br>
"The extraordinary fluctuations in the value of articles of
domestic consumption, to which the colony was subject, for many
years after its original establishment, and the extraordinary
profits that were not unfrequently realized on the investment of a
small capital, in mercantile speculation, afforded the officers of
the New South Wales Corps, both a temptation and an excuse for
endeavouring to eke out their military income, which, in such
circumstances, was often inadequate enough, by engaging, either
directly or indirectly, in such speculations."<br>
<br>
"During Governor King's administration, the population of New South
Wales consisted chiedy of those who sold rum, and of those who
drank it; as the general maxim of the colony, at that period was,
<i>make money, honestly if you, can, but by all means make
money</i>, it may naturally be supposed, that the sellers of this
article of universal requisition, would include persons of all
ranks and professions."</p>

<p>Anthony Fenn Kemp, is a pawnbroker in London; he was qualified
for any kind of huxtering or dealing, before he left New South
Wales, for although he held his Majesty's honourable commission, as
a captain in the army, he served his full time to that trade.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding what I have said of the officers of the New
South Wales Corps, which was made his Majesty's 102nd regiment,
there were belonging to it, two gentlemen who never dishonoured
themselves, or his Majesty's cloth. They were Captain John Piper,
and Captain Edward Abbott. They were both men of honour and
resolution. They conducted themselves, in all respects, as officers
and gentlemen. They served the poor, and they upheld the oppressed,
by which they kept themselves poor; but they would have been rich,
indeed, if prayers and good wishes could have made them wealthy,
and they retained their own self-respect. They were too
noble-minded to desire to make a fortune from the labour of the
settler, the plunder of the soldier, or from the sweat of the
convict's brow.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[1807]</p>

<p>I have been told, that these two gentlemen are now at Port
Dairympie, the one in the office of Judge Advocate, the other as
Naval Officer; wherever they may be, they cannot be better than I
wish them. It is deeply to be lamented, that any one should ever
receive a military commission, but a gentleman, who may be depended
upon, to act with honour and resolution. These are the two great
qualifications for a soldier; any man possessing them, will conduct
himself well in the field of battle, and will treat those over whom
he may have command, with humanity. Not so the poor, low, mean,
despicable creatures, who are thrust into a position for which they
are unfit, and who, upon all occasions, disgrace the commission
which they bear. They are cowards in the field, and tyrants over
those whom they dare to trample on, knowing that they have not the
power of defending themselves.</p>

<p>Governor Bligh followed the orders which he had received, upon
his departure from England; and Mr. John Macarthur, formerly a
captain in the 102d regiment, continued to carry on his old game of
brow-beating and extortion. Finding that this practice was likely
to be stopped, he and Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp, with several
others of the same regiment, felt themselves aggrieved at their
proceedings being checked.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[1808]</p>

<p>They entered into a league against the Governor, and led Major
George Johnstone to believe that Governor Bligh's intention was to
ruin them all.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[25 January 1808]</p>

<p>The Governor, finding it necessary to commit Macarthur to prison
for insolence and disobedience of orders, Major Johnstone came from
his own house, which was about two miles from Sydney Barracks, and
called all the soldiers to arms at the rear of the barrack. The
major then marched his regiment down to the parade-ground, and from
thence proceeded at their head to the Government House. The first
person they met was the Rev. Henry Fulton, and he asked Major
Johnstone what he and the soldiers wanted, marching in this manner
with drum and fife? The Governor and Fulton were both astonished at
these proceedings. Fulton was made a prisoner; upon seeing which,
Bligh became very much alarmed, being afraid that they would put
him to death, and he retired and hid himself under one of the beds.
Mrs. Putland, the Governor's daughter, made fight, but was soon
overcome, and the Governor was pulled out from under a bed, and
placed in confinement.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Dr. Lang, who has entered into an able and
pathetic vindication of the conduct of Governor Bligh, thus relates
the particulars of this most memorable occurrence in the history of
New South Wales, which took place on the very day previous to that
which commenced the twentieth year of the settlement of the
colony:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"Colonel Johnstone was, in an evil hour, most unfortunately
persuaded to usurp the government of the colony. Orders were
accordingly given for the regiment to form, and the drum was beat
loud and hard, between six and seven o'clock in the evening. The
regiment was instantly formed in the barrack-square, and marched
immediately, at a quick pace, towards Government House, with
bayonets fixed, colours displayed, and military music. Mrs.
Putland, the Governor's daughter, whose husband, a lieutenant in
the navy, had been interred only a few days before, (on which
occasion Colonel Johnstone was chief mourner,) presented herself at
the door of the house, and endeavoured to prevent the entrance of
the military with her parasol; but the house berng surrounded by
the soldiery, Colonel Johnstone, and a number of the latter, soon
effected an entrance. The Governor, however, was for some time not
to be found; but every room and crevice in the house being eagerly
searched for him by the soldiers, he was at length discovered
standing behind a cot, which was hanging in a back apartment, to
which he had retired on the approach of the military, in the act of
concealing certain papers of importance."]</p>

<p>The military then went to the gaol, and liberated Mr. Macarthur;
and all the people that had been put into official situations by
Governor Bligh, were instantly dismissed.</p>

<p>This revolution put the colony into considerable confusion.
Major Johnstone held the reins of government for some time. He
wrote to Colonel Paterson, who was the Lieutenant-Governor, and was
then at Port Dalrymple, requesting his return to Sydney, to take
the place of Governor Bligh; but the colonel refused to come,
stating, that if they had begun a rebellion at Sydney, they might
end it among themselves. Colonel Foveaux arriving from
England,&mdash;having been, as I before mentioned, raised from the
rank of major to that of colonel,&mdash;Major Johnstone gave up his
command to him, and then wrote again to the Lieutenant-Governor to
come to Sydney. This occasioned another change in the government of
the colony, which rendered everything very unsettled for some
time.</p>

<p>Colonel Paterson made conditions with Captain Bligh, for he was
no longer Governor, to go on board his ship, and there to remain
until orders should arrive from England concerning this unpleasant
business. Captain Bligh promised to do so; but, as soon as he got
on board, he weighed anchor, and sailed for the Derwent, and
assumed the command there, leaving us without ministerorpriestof
any kind, or preacher, except a barn-ranter, that neither
Roman-catholic nor protestant would go and listen to. There was no
clergyman to visit the sick, baptize the infant, or church the
women; so we were reduced to the same state as the heathen natives,
who had none of those ceremonies performed among them.</p>

<p>Governor Bligh wrote to England, to state that he had been
deprived of his authority by a rebellion at Sydney, in which the
whole of the military, officers and soldiers, were concerned. Upon
the receipt of this alarming intelligence, a regiment, or part of a
regiment, was immediately embarked for Sydney. During this
interval, our Lieutenant-Governor gave grants of land, free
pardons, emancipations, and all other kind of indulgences and
comforts, to those under him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>16. A Free Pardon for Holt</h2>

<p class="date-jnl">[12 January 1809]</p>

<p>On the 12th of January, 1809, my son was married to Elizabeth
Bray, a young woman who was born in New South Wales. She was the
daughter of Sergeant Bray, from the county of Galway, in Ireland.
Her mother's name was Mary Downes, from the county of Tipperary. I
approved of the match, but there was no one to marry them. I
remembered, however, to have heard, that in such cases a magistrate
might perform the marriage ceremony; so I went, in company with
Joseph Lewellin, who was step-father to this young woman, to
Colonel Paterson, to procure a licence from him for them to be
married, and we all then proceeded to Major Abbott, who performed
the ceremony, in the presence of Mr. Finucane, the secretary at
that time.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[4 June 1809]</p>

<p>As it approached the fourth of June, (the king's birthday,)
several people were busy in getting petitions'drawn up, for
presentation on that day, to Colonel Paterson soliciting a free
pardon. I went to Major Abbott, and asked him to sign my petition
to this effect, and to interest himself for me; but he observed,
that petitioning in this manner was, in his opinion, degrading
myself to the level of a convict. He was going out, and, taking me
by the arm, he walked down with me to the colonel's. Colonel
Paterson came out to see us.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said Major Abbott, "you are giving free pardons to
many people, and I think that Mr. Holt deserves his freedom as well
as any man in this colony."</p>

<p>The Colonel replied, "Major Abbott, as it is your wish, I will
give Mr. Holt his free pardon."</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[5 June 1809]</p>

<p>The major thanked him, and so did I, very sincerely. As we went
away together, Major Abbott remarked that he was very glad that it
had occurred to me to look after my pardon, as perhaps such another
opportunity for doing so might not occur again. I then returned
home, where I remained until the 5th day of June, when I came down
from George's River to the Governor's office, to enquire about my
pardon.</p>

<p>I was told that no directions had been given to make it out;
upon which I made it my business to see Mr. Finucane, and asked him
about it. He replied that he had received no orders to make out my
pardon, and enquired when the colonel had promised it to me. I
related to Mr. Finucane all that had occurred, and the manner in
which Colonel Paterson had granted Major Abbott's request in my
favour.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I will take care that the colonel shall not
forget his promise."</p>

<p>He went to the colonel, and very speedily returned to the
office, when he gave orders to the clerk to fill up a free and
absolute pardon for me.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[6 June 1809]</p>

<p>I remained in town that night, and the next morning Major Abbott
sent his orderly sergeant for me, and handed me my free pardon,
wishing me much luck with it. After making my grateful
acknowledgments to him, I came away. At the time I was exceedingly
glad; but I now am as sorry that I had so much interest made for
me, as to allow me to leave so fine a country and return to
Ireland. Upon my return home, my wife and children were very much
pleased that I now had it in my power to go or stay where and when
I liked. A few weeks after this, I drew up a memorial to Colonel
Paterson, representing that I had been several years in the colony,
and had never received any grant of land, and that, by my unaided
industry and good conduct, I had acquired two hundred and ten acres
of land, with four hundred sheep, fifty head of cattle, and seven
horses and mares; and therefore praying for a grant of ground.</p>

<p>The colonel, I understand, was well pleased at this statement of
my stock, and said that hfe would give directions to Mr. James
Meahan, the acting surveyor, to assign a grant for me.</p>

<p>Mr. Meahan was a friend of mine; he lost no time in measuring
out one hundred and ten acres of land for me, adjoining my son's
farm, and the necessary deeds were prepared and signed by the
colonel. I called it Holt's Fancy, and a very good farm it was. My
bounds adjoined thirteen thousand acres that were laid down in the
map for common land, which was of advantage to my farm, as it
thereby possessed the right of commonage: On my leaving New South
Wales, I sold it for ever, for the sum of fifty pounds, to Martin
Short, from the County of Kildare, a sufferer for his country, and
a carpenter by trade.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>17. Arrival of Governor
Macquarie</h2>

<p class="date-jnl">[4 January 1810]</p>

<p>On the 4th of January, 1810, three ships hove in sight of
Sydney,&mdash;the Dromedary, the Indostan, and a
store-ship,&mdash;which came up to the Cove with every preparation
to give a broadside, if they saw occasion. The account which had
been sent to England, by Governor Bligh, represented the country in
a state of insurrection, and, accordingly. Governor Macquarie*
thought that he and his battalion would have to fight their way.
Upon hearing of the arrival of the new Governor, I rode down from
George's River to have a look at the strange troops, and to see his
Excellency.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Lieutenant Colonel of the 73rd regiment. Dr.

<p class="date-jnl">[6 January 1810]</p>

<p>On the morning of the sixth, the troops began to disembark, and
the 102nd regiment fell in under arms, to salute his Excellency. I
waited to see the whole battalion land, with the Governor; Ellis
Bent, the Judge-Advocate; the Rev. Mr. Cooper, Chaplain; and a full
staff of officers. The old soldiers kept their ranks until all the
73 rd regiment had passed by, and marched up to the parade ground.
The Governor Macquarie, and his Lieutenant, Richard Charles
O'Connell, had their commissions read for them by the
Judge-Advocate, before all the officers, soldiers, and inhabitants.
The 73 rd then marched out of town, and pitched their tents one
mile and a half from the barrack.</p>

<p>The old soldiers, with their wives and children, were full of
lamentations that evening; for they saw that they must quit New
South Wales, and they knew that it was a very different thing
living there and living in England. Anthony Fenn Kemp lost his
commission as Judge-Advocate, and, from being a magistrate and a
great officer in the colony, became nothing more than a captain in
the 102nd regiment; and, worse than this, his rotten tobacco would
no longer pay the soldiers, so that misfortunes came upon him in
various shapes. The old soldiers and sergeants now began to split,
and inform respecting this little rebellion that had taken place;
for, although there was no fighting, I consider it to have been a
rebellion,* where they made a prisoner of his Majesty's
representative, contrary to the law of Great Britain. Governor
Macquarie would have had no difficulty in recruiting, if he was
willing to receive the old soldiers as volunteers, and some of them
he did keep out of charity.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* After detailing the dispute between Governor
Bligh and Mr. Macarthur, Dr. Lang says, "In regard to what
followed, there can be but one opinion&mdash;it was downright
rebellion."]</p>

<p>Comfort and happiness now began to appear in the countenances of
all the inhabitants of the colony. John Macarthur lost his
villainous trade, but it had lasted him long enough to enable him
to make a large fortune; putting his mutton and beef into his
Majesty's stores, at one shilling and sixpence the pound, and
getting bills on the Treasury of Great Britain. All the oppressors
were smashed together, and it was amusing enough to hear them
abusing each other and cursing the Governor. The only two
individuals whose characters stood free from blemish, were Major
Abbott and Captain Piper. They now enjoyed the reward of their
honourable conduct, in the esteem of the Governor, and the good
wishes of the settlers and others; of which these gentlemen were,
in every respect, most worthy.</p>

<p>Governor Macquarie lowered the price of beef and pork to one
shilling the pound, in the first year of his government; in the
course of the second, to nine-pence; and, in the third, to
eight-pence,&mdash;and the meat was sold in the open market. This
was of great service to the poor, and injured no one but those who
could bear it, and had too long enjoyed an unfair profit. His
Excellency issued a proclamation, directing every one who had
received a free pardon, or a grant of land, since the arrest of
Governor Bligh, to deliver up such pardon or grant to the
secretary, Mr. John Thomas Campbell. This news did not please me
much; but I went to my good friend Major Abbott, and asked him for
his advice. He told me to bring in my pardon and grant, and that he
hoped they would both be continued to me. I did as he directed, and
delivered up both at the Governor's office; nor did I make any
enquiries about them for a year afterwards. I then memorialized his
Excellency on the subject, and I procured the recommendation of
Captain Piper, which was to the following effect,&mdash;that "the
long residence and good conduct of the memorialist deserved the
favourable attention of Governor Macquarie." The Rev. Mr. Marsden
signed another strong recommendation of me to the Governor's
notice, as did also Surgeon-General Wentworth, who went to his
Excellency in person, and gave me a verbal character, which was
even better and stronger than what he had written.</p>

<p>Governor Macquarie came to me to the door, and said, that if my
character was as had been represented to him, he would give me both
my pardon and the grant which he had recalled, and he promised to
make further enquiries about me.</p>

<p>I assured his Excellency, that I felt satisfied the answers to
every enquiry he was pleased to make about me, would be an
additional recommendation of me to his notice, and would fully
confirm the statements before him. After this I retired, and heard
no more on the subject, until I received a note from Michael
Robinson, who was head clerk in the Secretary's Office, requesting
me to call there for my free pardon.</p>

<p>Upon the receipt of this note, I went immediately to my
countryman. Mr. Campbell, the Secretary, handed me my pardon; upon
getting which I put my hand in my pocket, and gave two pounds to
Mr. Robinson. I went straight to the hotel, and sitting down there,
drew out a notice of my stock and estates, to be sold by private
contract, and stated that ten months' credit would be given upon
approved security.</p>

<p>I then took this to Mr. Howe, the printer, and desired him to
put it into the <i>Weekly Gazette</i>,* which was done accordingly.
The Governor was very much surprised when he saw this advertisement
for the disposal of my stock and estates; and he remarked, that it
was much to be regretted, that a man of my knowledge and experience
in farming should leave the colony. There was, indeed, no one in
New South Wales that understood the treatment of cattle, and their
diseases, so well as I did. Robbers and pickpockets seldom make
these matters their study, which will account for the great want of
knowledge there was respecting a very important subject.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The late Mr. Robert Howe was editor of this
paper.<br>

sixpence, ornamented with an oval device, containing the implements
of husbandry, and the motto, "Thus we hope to conquer," was first
published by the authority of Governor King, at Port Jackson, on
the 6th of March, 1803.]</p>

<p>Governor Macquarie, according to my opinion, was a clever,
sensible man, and one that it was not easy to out-wit. However, he
was certainly over-reached in one matter, and that was in the
building of an hospital.* Having mentioned his wish, that there
should be a large hospital in Sydney, three gentlemen prepared and
submitted to his Excellency the plan of a large and fine building,
for this purpose, at which he was much pleased.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Dr. Lang's account of this affair seems to
bear out Holt's statement. "The demoralizing influence," observes
the Doctor, "indirectly resulting from the gratification of
Governor Macquarie's taste for public buildings, cannot be more
fitly illustrated than in the plan he pursued for the erection of a
general hospital in Sydney. Had the convicts been dispersed over
the territory in the way I have suggested, an hospital of
comparatively small dimensions would have been sufficient at head
qaarters; at all events, a plain substantial edifice'was all that
was wanted for such a purpose, till the expense of erecting
ornamental buildings could be borne by the revenue of the
colony.<br>
<br>
The colonial architect, however, having submitted to his Excellency
a plan for a spacious and costly edifice, consisting of a centre
building and two detached wings, to be erected of cut stone, with a
double verandah or covered portico, completely surrounding each of
the three piles of building&mdash;Governor Macquarie determined
that it should by all means be carried into effect. With this view
he made an agreement, on the part of the colonial government, with
Messrs. D'Arcy Wentworth, Blaxcell, and Riley, by which these
gentlemen stipulated to erect a building, agreeably to the plan
proposed, on condition of receiving a certain quantity of rum from
the king's stores, and of having the sole right to purchase, or to
land free of duty, all the ardent spirits that should be imported
into the colony for a term of years. The Rum Hospital", as it was
called at the time, was accordingly erected on these conditions;
and standing, as it does, on the summit of one of the two ridges on
which the town of Sydney is built, and which, running in a
northerly direction towards the harbour, with a valley terminating
in the beautiful inlet called Sydney Cove, between, is, it must be
acknowledged, a highly interesting and striking feature in the
aspect of one of the most thriving and best situated commercial
towns in the world."<br>
<br>
Dr. Lang further says:&mdash;"In the year 1824, the Rum Hospital
was calculated to be worth &pound;20,000. Iam confident as good a
building could now be erected for &pound;10,000. The quantity of
Bengal rum which the contractors received from government, was
60,000 gallons, which at the time was worth the whole estimated
cost of the building. The monopoly was for three years; it was
afterwards extended to three and a half; and as the contractors
could purchase spirits at three shillings and retail, them at
forty, it was supposed to be worth at least &pound;100,000. In
short, the monopoly was a sort of <i>regium donum</i>, or royal
gift, over and above the fair market price of the article bargained
for."]</p>

<p>The cost of completing this noble building was estimated at
fifty thousand pounds, which was so large a sum, that it seemed to
be out of the question. The gentlemen then offered to build the
hospital free of expense to the government, if the Governor would
grant them the following contract; which his Excellency, not
perceiving all the evil and the extortion that arose out of it,
agreed to do. Namely, that D'Arcy Wentworth, chief magistrate and
surgeon-general, Alexander Riley, and Garret Blaxcell, gentlemen,
merchants, would build and complete the said hospital, to the
satisfaction of his Excellency the Governor, at their own expense;
in return for which, his Excellency was not to allow any one but
the said three geutlemen to buy any spirits imported into the
colony, for three years. His Excellency passed a bond to them, to
secure this bargain; and they gave their bond to complete the work,
which they immediately commmenced. The first-floor is ten feet from
the ground, with a verandah ten feet wide. The next floor is
sixteen feet high. Persons, when walking in the verandah, are on a
level with the wall; and those on the top verandah are twenty-six
feet from the ground. These verandahs are fixed on round pillars of
cut stone, which are most beautiful columns. It is capable of
holding fifteen hundred persons, and is in a delightful situation,
commanding a view of the town, and extensive prospects of the
harbour.</p>

<p>I have never seen a more commodious building. But who is it that
has really built this hospital? Why, the unfortunate people
themselves. When a vessel arrives from Bengal, and in this way
upwards of five hundred thousand gallons of spirits were imported,
it is the custom to lower her yards and hoist an admission flag.
One of these three gentlemen would then go on board, and enquire of
the captain how much spirits he had got. The captain would produce
his bill of lading. Mr. Wentworth, or Mr. Riley, or Mr. Blaxcell,
would then ask the price; and seeing that the vessel was chartered
for Port Jackson, and therefore could not go to any other port,
they knew that no one but themselves could purchase.</p>

<p>The captain was therefore at their mercy; and in this way they
usually bought at about nine, or, at the most, ten shillings the
gallon, upon which one shilling duty was to be paid to the orphan's
fund. The buyers placed the spirits in the bonded stores; and then
the publicans would, as far as they were able, purchase at the
first sale at two pounds the gallon; at the second sale, the price
generally rose to two pounds ten shillings; and, at the third, to
two pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence. This increase of the
merchants' price, from two pounds, to two pounds seventeen
shillings and sixpence, was, perhaps, in the course of six weeks.
The publican retailed the spirits thus purchased by him, at five
shillings the half-pint. These three gentlemen, who have the
monopoly of the spirit trade, say that they built the hospital; but
I assert it is the poor people of the colony that built it. This
was the only mistake that I observed in the conduct of Governor
Macquarie, during the time that I remained in the colony.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[1 January 1811]</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1811, I received my free pardon</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[10 June 1811]</p>

<p>On the 10th of June, I sold the Glen Bride estate,* and
twenty-eight head of cattle, with a mare and a foal, to Mr. Edward
Lord, for the sum of one thousand pounds sterling, giving six
months' credit. Mr. Garret Blaxcell, passed his note to me for this
money, as Mr. Lord was going to England, and left the management of
his business to Mr. Blaxcell.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Query</i>, "Glen Bight?" When Holt's
attachment to Brush Farm is remembered, the names of "Glen Bight,"
and "Brush Island," mentioned in connexion by Flinders, vol. i.
clvi., among his and Bass's discoveries, in 1798, lead to the
supposition that some association exists between these names. If
not, the closeness of the coincidence is singular.]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[2 July 1811]</p>

<p>On the 2nd of July, I sold to Mr. William Redfern, Assistant
Surgeon to the Surgeon General, my sheep, that is to say, the
remainder of them, after the butchers had bought all the fat
wethers, for the sum of six hundred guineas. I had sold five
English-bred cows for the sum of two hundred pounds, and I sold Mr.
James Meahan my saddle mare, a brood mare, a young colt, with
carts, harness, saddles, bridles, and all other accoutrements
belonging to the horses. Then I had eight hundred bushels of wheat,
which I put into his Majesty's store. I sold Mount Hester farm, for
one hundred and fifty pounds sterling; and then I went to live in
Sydney, until a ship would offer, homeward bound.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>18. Homeward Bound</h2>

<p class="date-jnl">[21 August 1812]</p>

<p>On the 21st of August, there arrived the <i>Isabella</i>, from
London, laden with clothes, and other goods for sale. She took in.
her a return cargo of oil, pearl-shells, and green hides, with
thirtyr-four passengers. I was anxious to agree for my passage, and
I accordingly spoke to Capt. George Hicton, who commanded the
<i>Isabella</i>, on the subject.' He told me that the matter did
not rest with him, but referred me to Mr. Grenville Macarthur,
part-owner of the ship. I went to him and agreed for a passage for
six persons, viz. ray wife,. my son, three of my servants, and
myself, for thirty pounds a head, which came to the sum of one
hundred and eighty pounds; and I was to find all provisions and
water-casks, sufficient to hold one hundred and twenty gallons for
each person. My agreement was to have ten feet by eight in the
steerage, to build a comfortable cabin for myself and wife; a place
for my son's cot to hang outside of our cabin, and room for my
three men to sling their hammocks. All this being arranged, I had
to bring my wheat to the mill, to get my flour ready, and my
biscuits made. I had reserved of my best wheat, plenty for this
purpose, and I had kept up three large hogs, that were fat four
months before they were killed. I bought a bullock for twenty
pounds, that we might have a change of provisions on the passage,
and I also bought a cask of raisins, and salted the fat of the
bullock, for a plum-pudding eats well at sea. I laid in twelve
dozen of wine, twenty gallons of rum, forty pounds of tea, one
hundred and sixty pounds of sugar, and I bought water-pipes.</p>

<p>There was at this time one of my servants who had not received
his free pardon. I offered to leave fifty pounds as a provision for
him, at the latter end of his days, in the care of my son, who was,
and is still, living in the colony. Upon my telling him of my
intention, the old man began to cry, but when I saw that he was so
much attached to me, that he desired to go with me, I told him to
get ready, for that we should all go together. I then went with him
to the Government House, where the orderly sergeant asked me if I
wanted to see the Governor.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said I, "if you please," and then I told the old
man to appear deaf and bothered, and not to seem as if he heard one
word that any one spoke to him. He did as I desired, acting his
part right well.</p>

<p>I was ordered to come in by his Excellency, who enquired my
business. I told him that I had at the door, an old servant, who
had been with me ten years; that for the last three years he had
not been able to earn his bread, but he had conducted himself so
well, that I was satisfied to pay his passage, and bring him home
with me, to his own country, to spend the last moments of his life
with his wife and seven children.</p>

<p>"If," said I, "he is one of those poor creatures to whom your
Excellency can extend your benevolence by granting him his pardon,
both he and I will for ever pray."</p>

<p>The Governor ordered old John Byrne to come in. I said, "Your
Excellency will perceive that he is quite deaf." The Governor spoke
a few words to him, but John could not hear in the least what he
said. His Excellency then took up his pen and wrote a line to Mr.
Campbell, the secretary, which he gave me, and desired that I would
deliver it to him myself. We both thanked him, and Byrne came to
his hearing in a wonderful manner, before we were ten steps from
the Governor's door. I was not mistaken in the Governor's goodness,
for the next morning John Byrne's pardon was received. I had
procured Philip Harney's pardon, about ten months before this, and
Edward Kilbride had served his term of transportation. So that I
had nothing more to do but to get everything ready for sea.</p>

<p>I got my bullock and my hogs killed and cured, and put into my
casks. I calculated my supply for a nine months' voyage, and I laid
in everything in proportion. All my old acquaintances flocked round
me, and I had a fresh company every night. The passengers in the
<i>Isabella</i>, were Captain Robert Durie, Mrs. Durie, and
daughter; Captain Richard Brookes, Sir Henry Browne Hayes,* and his
man, Samuel Brickwell. Mary Anne Spencer, Mary Bindel, Elizabeth
Davis, with fourteen marines&mdash;thirty-four passengers in all.
There were twenty sailors and officers, making the total number on
board the <i>Isabella</i> fifty-four persons.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* See note at page 122, of this volume.]</p>

<p>I got my cabin comfortably made, and all my provisions stowed in
their proper places, and I put my old man, John Byrne, on board, as
a watch upon my goods.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[1 December 1812]</p>

<p>On the 1st of December, 1812, my wife and son came on board, and
we all slept there, for the first night.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[2 December 1812]</p>

<p>On the 2nd, we went to dine and slept on shore, at Mr. Patrick
Cullen's, where we met a large party at dinner.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[3 December 1812]</p>

<p>On the 3rd, we went on board again, and had a party from shore
to dine with us. Soon after we unmoored, and dropped down in the
stream.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[4 December 1812]</p>

<p>On the 4th of December, his Excellency the Governor came on
board with Major Maclean, and several officers. They all wished us
a good passage; and we weighed anchor and sailed.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[5 December 1812]</p>

<p>The 5th, we had a very fine day, with a fair wind, but the 6th
was very stormy, and we were obliged to lie-to, for twenty hours,
after the expiration of which, we got a gentle breeze, and went on
pleasantly until the 15th, when at twelve o'clock at night, we were
opposite the west Cape of Campbell's Island, on a lee shore.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[16 December 1812]</p>

<p>At one in the morning, the alarm was given, that there was very
high land to leeward. Captain, Richard Brookes instantly went on
deck, and seeing the great danger we were in, immediately ordered
the sailors to put on more sail, and he stood by the helm. He soon
said there was no danger, as she was gaining to windward, but he
never left the helm till we were past the Cape. He then came down,
and told Captain Hicton that, he and his sailors were very much to
blame, for not keeping a better lookout; and he further said, that
five minutes more would have made an end of our voyage, for then
all the men in the world could not have saved the <i>Isabella</i>;
and he begged that more care might be taken in future. Captain
Brookes was a mariner of great skill and experience.</p>

<p>We passed on very pleasantly until we came to the Diego Ramirez,
a small cluster of uninhabited islands,* but all covered with
various sorts of birds. These islands appeared, at the distance of
two miles, like several cocks of hay, but when near they were very
rough and dangerous. We passed them by safely, and had a fair wind
for some days.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* About fifty miles S.S.W. of Cape Horn.]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[24 December 1812]</p>

<p>On the 24th, the wind became foul, and it blew such a gale that
we were obliged to lie-to for fifty-six hours, and we were very
hard set to cook our Christmas dinner. We lost four of our sails,
and the mainsail and jib were much injured. A calm followed this
storm, and we took advantage of it to put our rigging to rights; we
then made sail, and the first land we saw after this, was Staten
Island,* which is inhabited by Patagonians. They are cannibals, and
eat the flesh of Christians (when they can get it); it lies beyond
Cape Horn, about one hundred miles. We had shortly before this come
in sight of Cape Horn, which is the South Cape of America.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Close to the N.E. of Cape Horn.]</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>19. Wreck of the
<i>Isabella</i></h2>

<p class="date-jnl">[7 February 1813]</p>

<p>On the 7th of February we were in sight of Falkland Islands. The
captain thought to have passed to the north side of these islands,
having the main-land on our left; but he could not weather the
North Cape, and was obliged to tack about; we had a fair wind,
going eight knots an hour afterwards.</p>

<p>He shortly after got drunk, and came into my cabin, and talked
wildly, saying he would not let any man know what harbour he would
enter; and further, he asked, if the ship should sink, and all on
board perish, who was to be responsible but him? I looked at the
captain very earnestly, and said, it did not matter much, if all
perished, where the responsibility rested, as no one would be alive
to prosecute. He then went to Mrs. Bindel's cabin, and got into
bed. About two o'clock in the morning he went on deck, and altered
our course about four points, which led us in between New Island
and Steeple Jason, straight for Eagle Island.</p>

<p>About three o'clock I heard a great alarm upon deck; and shortly
after the sailors shouted:</p>

<p>"Rocks on one side and breakers on the other."</p>

<p>I leaped out of my cot, as did my wife; we dressed ourselves,
and I assisted our son to get up. We then all three fell on our
knees, to implore God's mercy and assistance. I did not forgot the
Almighty's gracious interference on former occasions; and, although
I never would fail to make exertions in danger, I always first
prayed for God's support and protection.</p>

<p>We prayed, and our prayers were heard.</p>

<p>While on our knees, the ship struck on a rock with great
violence, and, in a moment after, lost her rudder. My poor wife
took our boy and placed him between us, saying, "Let us all, linked
in each others arms, go to our watery graves together." We resigned
ourselves to our fate, and thought of nothing but our great
Creator. I believe no one else on board prayed but ourselves. The
sailors were cursing and swearing most horribly at the ship, and it
was altogether a most frightful scene of confusion and noise.</p>

<p>Captain Brookes was on deck all the time; and to his exertions,
skill, and cool intrepidity, under God, we were indebted for our
lives. When the rudder was unshipped, he made the sailors square
the yards, and run for the land; and by the gracious goodness of
our God, the ship passed in between two rocks, with her bowsprit
over the dry land, when she was, at it were, wedged in, and freed
in a great measure from the force of the waves. I heard Captain
Brookes cry out, "There is how no danger of our lives." He ordered
the carpenter to stand by with his broad axe, and the moment she
struck to cut the rigging on the windward side, and two or three
blows of the axe brought the mainmast down, the top resting on a
rock, and the butt of the mast against the gunwale, which kept her
steady.</p>

<p>It was now daylight. The sailors ran about, desiring, with the
greatest insolence, every one of the passengers to hand out their
wine and spirits. The want of discipline soon manifested itself in
their conduct. A small boat was lowered down, in order to put the
females ashore, into which Sir Henry Hayes, his man, with Madison,
and Bellingham, got, and rowed off; but they had a narrow escape of
their lives. Captain Brookes now took the sole direction of
everything; he sent down the kedge-anchor and hawser; slung the
accommodation chair; put a messenger on each side, and by this
means we soon got the women out of the vessel. We first placed poor
Mrs. Durie in safety on the dry land; she was within a few days of
her confinement; Mrs. Holt followed next; and in a short time we
had them all landed in safety.</p>

<p>My sick old man and my son followed, and my care was thus
lessened. My other two men, instead of assisting me to get my goods
landed, went and joined the marines and sailors, and began to
drink. My poor old John, however, feeble as he was, stayed by my
trunks and goods, as I sent them down.</p>

<p>I had my cash, both paper and coin, about me. The honest marines
and sailors wanted me to pull off my great-coat, and go down in the
chair; but I knew what they were about, and did not comply. I asked
Philip Harney and Edward Kilbride to assist me in saving my goods
and provisions, and getting them ashore, but they both said, "Damn
them if they would."</p>

<p>I then went ashore, and gave orders to my son and old Byrne to
stay by the trunks, until I found Mrs. Holt; and I wandered with
Captain Durie in search of our wives. At last we found them,
sitting together, on "Sorrowful Bank," as I called it. I said,
"that sorrowful as it was, I was glad to see them safe on shore."
Mrs. Durie asked me to have a glass of rum. "I will, madam," said
I, "for it is wanted to me, as I have not broken my fast this
day."</p>

<p>She handed me a bottle, and told me that the men were gone to
look for fresh water. I waited with them until two o'clock in the
afternoon, and we all gave God thanks for our safe deliverance.
Captain Durie and I then went towards the wreck, and I began to
think how we could make a place to sleep in. I viewed the ground,
and fixed on a spot where I thought it best to pitch our tent; it
was a hollow, between two banks.</p>

<p>I proceeded to the ship, and got some spars and long oars, which
I fixed across from bank to bank; I also got a couple of sails, and
spread them over, and so covered the top, and thus made a kind of
tent. I then took the hatches of the ship and laid them down, and
fixed our beds on them; then I went for our trunks and luggage, as
well as my old man, who was not able to do anything to help
himself. This tent was large enough for Captain Durie's family as
well as my own, and we got something to eat and drink under its
shelter.</p>

<p>When I went again on board, I found the sailors and marines all
dead-drunk, with my two ungrateful rascals lying on the deck.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[9 February 1813]</p>

<p>In the morning of the 9th of February, at break of day, the
first person I saw was Kilbride, asleep and drunk; and going to the
wreck, I saw Harney lying on the deck, with his head and face so
much swelled, that I scarcely knew him.</p>

<p>He had been robbed of fifty-nine dollars, which he had got from
me a few days before. I was anxious to get my sugar-cask, which had
one hundred pounds weight remaining in it, but I could not find it.
My chest had been broken open and rifled of everything worth
taking, and nothing but plunder was going forward in every part of
the ship.</p>

<p>It reminded me of the plunder of the Ancient Britons, when they
went through Wicklow and Wexford, or the scene I was witness to at
the time that I burned the Marquis of Waterford's lodge, in
Hollywood Glen, when the countrymen acted in just the same
manner.</p>

<p>Captain Brookes and myself now began to consider what was to be
done in our new situation; and we suggested, that as we had neither
king nor government, nor laws nor constitution, that it was
necessary for the good of all to make certain rules for our
regulation while on the island, to shape our conduct by; and to
extend our means of living as long as possible. So, having called
all hands to choose a council, Captain Robert Durie had the voices
of all; he named Captain Brookes; and they both named Lieutenant
Landin; then the marines named Sir Henry Browne Hayes, for he was a
favourite with them, as he used to sit down on the deck and play
<i>hora the brouze</i> and <i>hide the button</i> with them, two
plays practised by blackguards. Then Brookes and Durie proposed me;
and afterwards Hicton and George Davis, the master and mate of the
<i>Isabella</i>, were elected.</p>

<p>We proceeded to draw up the following articles or laws</p>

<p><i>First</i>&mdash;That no man should be exempt from work, till
our provisions were all landed.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>&mdash;Any man found guilty of stealing or robbing,
was to be punished according to his offence.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>&mdash;Every man should attend roll-call in the
morning.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>&mdash;That no man should have more provisions than
another.</p>

<p><i>Fifth</i>&mdash;That all private stores should belong to the
general store.</p>

<p><i>Sixth</i>&mdash;That nothing should be done without the voice
of the majority.</p>

<p><i>Seventh</i>&mdash;That the provisions should be served, out
twice a week, to prevent waste in the first part of the week.</p>

<p>Every man signed 'these articles, as consenting to them.</p>

<p>When this was done, we all set to work at the wreck, and first
got out the bread, flour, peas, and rice, then the pork and beef;
and having ascertained the quantity, made a calculation to see how
long these provisions would last. It was resolved, that we should
proportion our supply for one year, which, according to our
numbers, gave two pounds of bread, half a pound of flour or rice,
and one pound of beef or pork, to each person per week. We then had
our wine and spirits gauged, and found that, for the same time,
namely, twelve months, we could allow a pint of wine, or half a
pint of spirits, daily, to every man. We also got out a
considerable quantity of gunpowder.</p>

<p>I proposed that the best shots should be employed as our
sportsmen, and as there were a great quantity of geese and other
wildfowl on the island, we might get a good supply of fresh
provisions in that way. "But," said I, "it ought to be proved who
are the best shots among us: powder and shot are ten times more
valuable to us on an island that is full of birds, than the
biscuits, beef, or pork that we have landed; as long as our
ammunition lasts we cannot want, and it therefore is, above all,
our particular duty to see that it is not thrown away, and that
every shot fired gives us the full value for it."</p>

<p>All agreed with what I said; and a board being set up, with a
piece of paper on it, marked as a target is painted, we ordered the
marines to get their muskets in order; and it was resolved that he
who went nearest to the mark for three shots, should be appointed
the sportsman. We measured out the distance for them to fire, which
was one hundred yards. Johnson fired first&mdash;he was an
Irishman&mdash;and did not come near the mark. In short ten fired,
and only two hit the mark. Upon repeating their shots they all
missed, except two; and John Bellingham was the only man that put
each shot inside of the ring.</p>

<p>I had a fair joke now against the soldiers and their shooting,
telling them that I had good reason for knowing all soldiers to be
bad marksmen, as they had missed me so often in 1798; for that
probably more shots were aimed at me, with the intention of killing
me, than had ever been aimed at any man alive and able to tell the
story. Turning to Captain Durie, I said, "The soldiers of the year
1798, in Ireland, would have picked up a poor living, if made
fowlers on the Falkland Islands." At this remark there was a
general laugh.</p>

<p>It was then agreed that the sportsman should have an extra
allowance of spirits in bad weather, and also that he should have
men allowed him to bring home the geese he shot. The first day he
killed twenty-four geese, and we allowed a goose to every four
persons. My mess was a large one; it consisted of Captain Durie,
his wife, child, and servant; myself, my wife, child, and servant,
and Captain Brookes; in all nine persons. The others were divided
into different messes, as they could agree to arrange them.</p>

<p>We then agreed to appoint a store-keeper, and Sergeant William
Beain was, at my suggestion, fixed on for that office, and we
placed a sentry over the stores; but as I found a great many drunk
in the morning, I called the council to meet, and brought the
drunken men forward; they were all marines and sailors. I stated
that the allowance of wine and spirits given the day before, could
have produced no appearance of intoxication at that time, therefore
that there must have been some dishonest proceedings. I then moved
that some of the passengers should be put as sentries, thinking it
would stop this practice; but this change proved of no use. So we
formed a new store in the midst of our little camp, in order to
guard our stock the better; for you may rest assured you might as
well expect to squeeze honey out of a smith's anvil, as to make an
old marine or sailor honest: it surpasses the art of man. They used
to bore holes in the sides of the pipes of wine, and then turn the
pipes down, so that when they came to be inspected there was no
appearance of any place where the wine could have been drawn off.
Still the same thing was going on; and I called another meeting, at
which it was agreed to make a vault or cellar in the ground, and to
sink out pipes of wine and casks of spirits three or four feet
under the earth, so that they could not be touched except by
raising, and we had a small hand-pump to take out what we wanted;
by this means we at length succeeded in keeping the men from
getting more than their fair allowance. We had now to call the
sentry, but before this the twelve o'clock sentry was sure to come
without calling.</p>

<p>We then set the carpenter to work to raise our long-boat, and to
deck her in order that, in case of emergency, we might put to sea
in her.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[14 February 1813]</p>

<p>Sunday, the 14th was very wet, and the water came through our
tent as we sat at dinner. Mrs. Durie began to bewail her hard lot,
and gave many evil wishes to Hicton, whose drunkenness had caused
all our misfortunes.</p>

<p>This poor lady was now near her time of lying-in, and had
nothing but the cold and wet turf for the floor of her apartment. I
endeavoured to comfort her, and told her that God had already been
gracious, and saved all our lives, and was able, and would provide
for her in her necessity. "With His help, madam," I said, "I will
have a house raised for you by this time on Tuesday next." She
looked at me very earnestly, as did her husband and Captain
Brookes.</p>

<p>I then said, "Captain Durie, have you any command over these
marines? If you have, let me have some assistance to-morrow."</p>

<p>After dinner, I went out and took a view of the ground where I
thought I could best erect a cabin, and I was not long in fixing
upon a proper spot. At five the next morning we began to work; but
having no spade, to cut the sods, I luckily remembered "a large old
sword, which I had given to my old man at Sydney, to guard my cabin
with, before I went on board the <i>Isabella</i>. The ground was
uneven, in banks, varying between three and five feet in height;
each bank was about three feet square. With this sword I cut into
the bank, and then got a man to take hold of the long grass that
grew on the top, and as he pulled it towards him, I, being on my
knees, cut round every side of the bank, and when he pulled it
down, then cut off the grass and shaped it into proper sods for my
wall. Sergeant Beain assisted me, and old Byrne pulled the grass
down, as I have mentioned. At night I had the walls up of a cabin
twenty feet long, ten wide, and seven high.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[15 February 1813]</p>

<p>I made Beain get one of the yards of the ship; this I cut in
two, and at each end there was a mortice where the pulley was
fixed; this answered for my ridgepole or board to go into. When we
got the ridge set, I took some of the boards of the deck and placed
them on the walls, and the other ends I nailed to the ridge, giving
it a good coat of pitch; then I got three good sails, and stretched
them well one over the other, so that the rain would fall off
quickly; and this formed an excellent roof, which, having pegged
strongly down, was secured from being blown off by the wind.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[16 February 1813]</p>

<p>I then, with some of the cleck planks, made a platform of
flooring; and, having removed the stove from the ship, and cut a
hole for the funnel, I brought coals out of the wreck, and one of
the cabin tables, with a few chairs. By three o'clock the
table-cloth was spread in the new habitation, and we sat down
happily to dinner, and many a grateful bumper was drank, with
thanks to me for what I had done. This was on Tuesday, the 16th
February, 1813. Mrs. Durie, I am sure, would speak of me to this
hour with gratitude. She is, I believe, now in some part of
Scotland, where the first battalion of the 73rd regiment is
stationed.</p>

<p>The carpenter's proceedings with the longboat were superintended
by Captain Brookes, who was a good seaman, and understood the best
manner of fitting her. As for Hicton, none of us made free with
him, it being through his means that we had been brought into our
miserable condition, so he kept in his hut. The different parties
lived as most convenient to themselves, with their several
acquaintances. Mrs. Durie and my wife kept very much to themselves;
and I am sure of this, that there never was a Captain's wife and a
General's wife fonder of one another.</p>

<p>We passed the remainder of this week very pleasantly; but my
Wife and myself felt very deeply for a lady in Mrs. Durie's
uncomfortable state, and our feelings of pity and regret were much
increased by the recollection, that a lady who had been reared with
every tender care, and who had been accustomed to every attention,
should be confined under a bank in a turf bog, without the comforts
of house and home, and no assistance but from God and Mrs. Holt. I
talked with my wife about her case, until it left us no time to
think for ourselves, and we did all that was possible to assist her
through her trouble.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[21 February 1813]</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 21st, we were sitting at dinner, when I
observed Mrs. Durie's countenance change, and I saw her time was
come. I took a glass of wine, and said to Captain Brookes:</p>

<p>"A safe passage to all on their journey;&mdash;gentlemen," said
I, "we will take a walk;" and out we went.</p>

<p>In about an hour and a half we returned, and the poor lady had
been safely delivered of a daughter: so the hand of the Lord
assisted these two females in their distress; and Mrs. Durie
recovered by his blessing, and the aid of her friend, without the
assistance of any doctor. Thus does our merciful God act to all
that put their trust in him. Upon hearing this good news, we came
in, and sitting down, enjoyed ourselves proclaiming the young lady
queen of the island, as the first-born there, and declaring her
name to be <i>Ann Providence Durie</i>.</p>

<p>We drank very heartily that night, as well on this this account
of the christening, as that our friend Captain Brookes intended to
sail next morning.</p>

<p>We put in the long boat three months' provisions of every
article that we had, and then called all hands to give their voices
for some one to command the boat. Captain Durie named Captain
Brookes, I said the same; and three-fourths of the people voted for
him. Sir Henry Browne Hayes wanted to go, but all, except five or
six marines, refused to agree to it. Captain Brookes was given the
command, with power to choose what companions he thought proper. He
fixed on George Davis, the mate of the <i>Isabella</i> wreck,
Lieutenant Landin, Joseph Woolley, a marine, and Anthony the
Irishman, as he could speak different languages, and an American,
which were as many as she could hold.</p>

<p>All hands went down to where the boat lay, and we launched her
off the stocks; after all her stores were on board I brought down a
bottle of rum to christen her, and you may be assured I filled my
glass, and drank prosperity to "FAITH AND HOPE." She hoisted her
sails, and went to sea.* We prayed for her success, as she was all
the hope we had to get our lives safe off from these islands.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The following is Lieutenant Landin's
narrative of the wreck of the <i>Isabella</i>, and of his
subsequent proceedings for the assistance of his shipwrecked
companions.<br>
<br>
"Having received his Excellency the Governor's permission to return
on leave of absence to England, I embarked, and sailed from Port
Jackson on the 4th December, 1812, in the <i>Isabella</i>, of
London, 193 tons burthen, in company with Captain Durie, of H. M.
73rd Regiment, and family, a detachment of Royal Marines, with
several other men and women passengers, who, with the crew of the
vessel, amounted in all, to fifty-four souls. Two months after our
departure, we passed Cape Horn, when it was the intention of the
Master of the vessel to put into some port in the Falkland Islands
for a supply of water, which intention, however, he changed as he
approached them, being entirely unacquainted, and having no charts
whereby he might be directed to a port.<br>
<br>
"His first intentions were to have steered between the islands and
the continent of South America, till on the 7th of February, about
six o'clock in the evening, the land was perceived too far ahead to
weather, when he put about to go on the eastern side of the island.
At about twelve o'clock at night, when not the least apprehension
was entertained of danger, the alarm was given of being close in
with the land.<br>
<br>
"No time was lost in taking in sail, and hauling close to the wind,
which we had scarce done, and in a fair way to weather it, when we
struck with great violence on a ledge of rocks under water, and
unshipped the rudder, and could plainly distinguish heavy breakers
all round us; after striking very hard for some time, we at last
drifted off, and found ourselves, between two and three in the
morning, close in with the shore; having cut away the masts, and
the tide ebbed, some sailors got on shore by the wreck, when a
hawser was made fast, and all the people safely landed; and
likewise succeeded in saving all the provisions, which precluded
the possibility of our suffering from want of sustenance for some
time, but left us as we now were upon a desert and uninhabited
island, surrounded by rocks and islands on every side, where we
could not suppose that any vessel would ever approach. No prospect
of ever being extricated from our deplorable situation remained,
but endeavouring to discover some Spanish settlement, which we
supposed to exist on some of the islands, which, however, we were
very ill-provided to do, having only a small long boat, about
seventeen feet and a half long; we got her, however, put in the
best possible order, and increased her weight by putting an
additional streak upon her,-and about two-thirds of a deck, to
enable her the better to withstand a heavy sea. These improvements
being completed, Mr. Brookes, a passenger, (having been a long time
master of a vessel) was nominated to navigate her, with the master
and two seamen of the <i>Isabella</i>, and a marine to go in her,
who, together with myself, (having volunteered my services,
conceiving that an application made by an officer belonging to the
service of his Britannic Majesty-might be of more avail than by a
private individual, in procuring relief) sailed on the 21st of
February, attended, as might be well supposed, by sincere wishes
for our success. We steered first towards an entrance about ten
leagues to the N.W. of us, which we supposed to be the entrance to
Falkland's Straits, intending to proceed to Port Egmont, as being
the most likely place to find the settlement, where we might find a
vessel either to carry off all the people to Rio de Janeiro, or one
by which we might proceed ourselves for assistance. From foul winds
we were five days before we reached the entrance we saw from the
island, during which time we encountered a very heavy gale of
wind, while we lay at anchor under the lee of a small island,
where we found what at first we had taken for the entrance to the
Sound, was a large Bay. We then steered towards the northward, and
in attempting to haul round, when we had cleared the Sound, we were
driven out by a heavy current to the southward, and during a dark
night, found the greatest difficulty in weathering the rocks on the
Eastern Island, and next morning were obliged to run to the
southward to find a port to recruit ourselves, being quite
exhausted the preceding evening.<br>
<br>
"Having found this, and now discovering it totally impracticable to
find the port we were in quest of, we formed the determination of
attempting the passage to the main, for which we sailed on the 8th
March, and being favoured with comparatively very moderate weather
and fair winds, we arrived at St. Lucia, in the River Plate, on the
26th. General Rondeau, at that time commanding the army besieging
Monte Video, offered me a passport to Monte Video, but at the same
time informed me of H.M. ship Nereus being at Buenos Ayres, of
which I was glad to avail myself, and again embarked in the boat,
and arrived on the evening of the 11th March. I cannot here refrain
from bearing testimony to the eagerness and activity of Captain
Heywood, displayed in refitting H. M. brig <i>Nancy</i>, which
arrived next day totally dismasted, to send to the relief of the
people on the island, which was completed on the 15th April.
Knowing by experience the danger of approaching those islands,
which have hitherto been so inaccurately described, and Lieutenant
D'Aranda, Commander of the <i>Nancy</i>, having no clue whereby he
might discover the particular island that my fellow-sufferers were
on, none of the people that were in the boat having any intention
to revisit them a second time, and likewise conceiving that what
observations I had been enabled to make, might be of service to
Lieutenant D'Aranda, I applied to Captain Heywood for a passage to
return in the <i>Nancy</i>, which was readily granted, and after a
very boisterous passage, in which Mr. D'Aranda evinced the greatest
perseverance, we discovered the land on the 14th", and anchored on
the 15th of May in the Bay, which at our departure we had taken for
the entrance of the Straits, from whence I was enabled to conduct
him to the island. On our arrival, we found most of the people
absent, a shallop belonging to an American brig having approached
the island in search of seal skins, and having given up every hope
with respect to the safety of the boat, they entered into an
agreement with them to carry them off the island; and all the able
hands were now absent fitting the brig, which lay among some of the
islands at some distance, to bring her round to carry them all off.
On the 15th of June the American brig arrived, when Mr. D'Aranda
conceiving they had broke their agreement made a prize of her,
determining to send her direct to England. The object of my return
being now completed, and anxious to proceed as quickly as possible
to deliver up the despatches with which I was charged by his
Excellency the Governor of New South Wales, I embarked in the
<i>Nannina</i>, American brig, and sailed from the Falkland Islands
on the 27th of July, when, on the 23rd of August, we were compelled
for want of sufficient provisions for so long a voyage, to put into
Rio de Janeiro.<br>
<br>
"Richard Landin,<br>
Lieut. H. M. 73rd Regt."]</p>

<p>The next day I began to build a house for my own residence, with
the assistance of my old man, who had much recovered, and my
son.</p>

<p>With the wainscoting of the cabin of the wreck I made a
comfortable bed-room for myself and wife, and another for my son
and old Byrne. As for my other two men, they behaved so ill at the
time of the wreck, that I took no notice of them afterwards; for as
they neglected me in the time of need, I knew their value, and
treated them accordingly; but him I found faithful is not forgotten
by me to this day. When my house was completed, I built a kitchen
for Mrs. Durie and myself; and when I had it put together, I got
the copper from the vessel and coppered it. The chimney I made in
the same manner as the chimneys to the small houses in the country
parts of Ireland, and I got a hob-stone from off the beach. My
chimney was so wide that I could lay a beam nine feet long across
it, which was sometimes necessary, as we had nothing to cut up the
wood with.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[1 March 1813]</p>

<p>On the 1st of March we had a strong southerly wind, which blew
the <i>Isabella</i> out of the water high and dry; and then we got
all the lead from her, which was her most valuable store.
Bellingham went out every day to shoot, unless it happened to be
very stormy; and I advised him always to keep, if possible, a day's
allowance in store, which would render the supply almost a
certainty. He did so, and I acted as commissary. Every day, when
Bellingham returned, he came to me, and delivered up what he had
shot, which I took an account of, and this is the cause of my being
now able to write all the particulars, as I kept a journal of all
the transactions that happened upon land or sea; and when I had an
hour to spare, I used to put down the occurrences of my life, as I
remembered them.</p>

<p>If I had a leisure day, I spent it in exploring the island upon
which we had been wrecked, and sometimes went out with Bellingham.
In one of these excursions, we saw a flock of as many as thirty
geese; and when we came up to them, I killed six at the first shot.
Bellingham charged, and then fired, killing at the second shot five
more; and we never left the spot until we had killed the last of
the flock. When the live geese saw their friends that had been shot
fall down on their backs, or the wounded fluttering about, instead
of taking to the wing and flying away, they would collect about the
dead and dying, and look on with surprise and wonder, so that we
certainly could not call them wild geese. I have also seen a flock
of geese, as soon as we came in sight of them, rise and fly towards
us, and alight around where we stood, looking at us without any
signs of fear, and cackling as if they were rejoiced at meeting
with us. I have knocked down some of them with my stick; and I very
seldom went out that I was not able to bring back with me a goose
or a pair of ducks. After I had seen the first day's sport, I
always took a stick with me, and I found that a load for three men
could with ease be procured in the course of one day, so that I
felt no apprehension at our wanting food.</p>

<p>One day I walked out with Captain Durie, and we went down to the
south-east side of Eagle Island, which was the name of the island
that we were on, as we afterwards found. The adjacent island was
called George's Island. As we walked along near the shore, we saw
several large animals, but we did not know what they were. When we
advanced towards them, they got up and made towards the water, into
which they plunged. Upon our return back, we saw another of those
animals get up out of the tussocks; it faced us, but I perceived by
its shape that it could not run fast; it was about the size of a
two years' old bull, with a head bigger than that of an ox, and
eyes as large as tea-cups. I had only my stick in my hand; and as
it came towards us, I stood right before it, and when within reach,
made a blow at one of its eyes, which completely put it out. The
animal roared very much; but instead of advancing, stopped, which I
took advantage of, and changing my position, made another blow
without loss of time at the other eye, which I struck with such
force that the juice from it squirted out into my face. The animal
roared very loudly; but I quickly struck it on the nose, which made
it turn from the water, and go towards the place it had come from.
As it appeared to me, that in this first engagement I was the
master, having blinded the animal, and perceiving that it laid down
its head, I felt inclined to complete my work, and gain the
complete victory. I called to Captain Durie to bring me a stone,
which he did; but I thought it too light, and sent him for another
of a larger size. He brought me a second stone, and with both of
them I attacked the animal.</p>

<p>By one of these, which struck it on the back of the head, it was
killed. I examined the place, and found that the skull, in the spot
of the death-wound, was not much thicker than the shell of an egg.
I viewed and examined the animal, but I could not tell what to call
it. Captain Durie and I felt the skin, upon which was a very
smooth, short, close hair, not unlike that with which trunks are
covered. And what did my great exploit turn out to be? Only killing
a young sea-elephant of a year old. When we returned, we described
our adventure, and one of the men went and cut out the tongue, of
which he made a good mess for his supper.</p>

<p>A full grown sea-elephant is as large as two English bullocks,
and produces eight barrels of oil. These animals are amphibious;
that is, they can live in the water or out of the water, for days
together. They burrow holes in the ground a quarter of a mile from
the sea, where they lie during the hot weather; and seldom leave,
unless they are in want of food, when they go to the sea. They move
nearly as fast backwards as forwards. These great animals have a
forked tail, divided for about three feet, with large fins on each
part. They have two very large fins, or small arms, about five feet
from the head, and on these they bear and travel on the land; and,
when in the sea, use them as oars, to pull through the water. In
these islands they are-very abundant. I had at one time forty-five
of their tongues drying in my chimney, in Eagle Island, and I took
some of them to sea with me, and I made a present of some to
Captain D'Afandaj commander of his Majesty's gun-brig,
<i>Nancy</i>.</p>

<p>There was a kind of duck on these islands, which the Americans
call loggerheads, but they cannot fly, having wings too small for
that purpose; their body is larger than that of an Irish goose;
and, in very stormy weather, when we could not use a musket with
effect, we would go to fresh water ponds, and get between these
ducks and the sea, and drive them inland. The moment they found
themselves among the grass, they would run their heads under the
grass, and there they remained till we came up to give them their
death-blow, or I should rather have said blows, for they are a very
strong fowl, and require two or three blows with a heavy stick from
the stoutest arm, to kill them. Their flesh is very dark, being
much like that of the wild goose in Ireland. We used to skin them,
as the feathers were of no use, and were very hard to pluck. The
body weighed about fourteen pounds, and when stewed down made very
good soup.</p>

<p>Some very fine celery grew on the island,* as fine indeed as I
ever saw in Dublin market, which was very useful to us for cooking
and making soup. The heavy rains washed down the earth from the
banks and high grounds, and thus the celery was earthed as it grew,
without any labour. It soon banished the scurvy, with which many of
the sailors were very much afflicted when we were wrecked. Before
we left Eagle Island they were quite well, and every one got to
look fat and wholesome.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* When the <i>Betsey,</i> whaler, visited the
Falkland Islands, in 1801, the seeds of several vegetables were
sown on the various islands by her crew, especially celery, of
which a cask had been taken by the <i>Betsey</i> in a Spanish
prize. It was, however, the constant practice for all whalers to
pay particular attention to the cultivation of vegetables upon the
uninhabited islands they were likely to visit.]</p>

<p>There was another sort of sea-bird, which we called divers, and
the seamen called "black shags." They never flew from us, and any
one might go in among five hundred of them, and with a long staff
knock down ten at a blow. They had no gizzards, and their flesh was
black and tasted fishy; but if put into fresh water for ten hours
before cooking, it took Off the fishy taste. It was the same with
the sea geese, or the geese that lived upon the salt water, and eat
small fishes and sea-weeds; but the flesh of the dry-land geese was
more like the flesh of poultry, and was far whiter than that of a
goose in England or Ireland. The land geese lived upon a berry,
called the cranberry, upon which food they got as fat as any geese
I ever saw.</p>

<p>The ducks, widgeons, teals, snipes, and doves, were far superior
to any in this kingdom. The barnacle or abrant was another bird,
something less than a goose in size, but very fat and pleasant for
food. I have also seen, in Eagle Island, the most beautiful swans
that eye ever beheld. The head was scarlet, and the neck black down
to the breast, the body milk-white, and they were larger than any
others that I have met with. In taking a walk along the sea shore,
the small birds would sometimes alight on my hat, and from that hop
down to my shoulders. I have indeed often put up my hand and caught
them; and after looking at them, I would let them go. It was quite
clear that they knew nothing of danger from man, as the passengers
and crew of the <i>Isabella</i> were probably the first people who
had sojourned on the island. The eagle and the hawk were so plenty,
that I often wondered at seeing such an abundance of other
birds.</p>

<p>I was very fond of birds, and when I left Port Jackson, I,
brought twenty-one parrots, and one cockatoo, with me in a cage;
they cost me sixty guineas. Fifteen of these parrots spoke, and
whistled, in a very remarkable manner. It was wonderful how readily
they picked up any tune played to them, on the flute or fife, and
how perfectly they imitated every note of it, as true as a
drum-major. My cockatoo spoke as much as any woman, and he could
bark like a dog, either a great dog or a little one, and imitate
other animals. He had acquired these accomplishments by walking out
every morning and perching himself on the yard gate, where he had
an opportunity of hearing the sounds made by the dogs and sheep,
and if he thought that the sheep were not driven out in or about
the usual time, he would call, "Phillip, Phillip&mdash;damn
you&mdash;come and reckon your sheep&mdash;you ought to be out."
These words, and many more he had learned quite perfectly, and was
very fond of repeating "damn you,"&mdash;"damn you," I have
observed that parrots and children, are good scholars at bad
words.</p>

<p>When I was wrecked on Eagle Island, and had but two pounds of
bread to live on for seven days, I was obliged; to turn my pretty
birds out to look for their own livelihood, and to my inexpressible
vexation, I saw the eagles dart at several of them, and in a moment
destroy them. Four of them, however, escaped, and fled into our
tent or cabin to us, for protection, and perching on my wife's lap,
cried "Pretty dear,"&mdash;"Pretty Polly." Their enemies were
standing almost at the door so she could not turn them out, but
kept them,, and we divided our mess with them. Of these four birds,
I sold three at, Rio de Janeiro, for ten pounds, and the other is
at Mr. Peter Latouche's, at Bellevieu, in the County Wicklow.</p>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>20. Rescue and Voyage to Rio de
Janeiro</h2>

<p>We remained living between hope and despair until the fourth day
of April, when Captain Durie and myself, took a walk after dinner
down towards George's Island, when we perceived a small vessel
coming from Berkeley's Sound, and bearing towards Eagle Island.
Captain Durie said, "That is our Faith and Hope." I looked steadily
at the little bark but soon perceived that it could not be our long
boat, and I told Captain Durie that I was satisfied it would prove
to be a vessel of three times her size. We went down to the shore,
and I pulled out my pocket handkerchief, and fixed it to the end of
my cane, as a signal of distress.</p>

<p>The signal was perceived by the vessel, and she bore in shore,
and lowered a boat. By this time, fourteen of our people had
collected on the beach. The first man that landed was Captain
Edward Fanning, from Nantucket, in America. He looked at me very
earnestly and came over, and shook hands with me; asking, "How was
the settlement of the world?" I answered, "Very well."</p>

<p>To explain to the reader the cause of his coming up to me, I
must state, that I wore my beard under my chin, as a mark of what I
was,* and he wore his in the same manner. After speaking two or
three words together, which made us know more than I am going to
relate, he asked me into his boat.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* An United Irishman. See page 189 of this
volume.]</p>

<p>I introduced Mr. Durie to him, and both of us, with Hicton, went
on board his vessel, where we found Captain Charles Barnet, and
Captain Andrew Hunter. We told them our sorrowful tale, and they
said that they had seen our flag, and could not tell the meaning of
it. I invited these three gentlemen to do us the honour to spend
the night with us at Newtown Providence, as I had called the little
settlement, and they promised to accept our invitation, as soon as
they got past the Cape of Barren Island. Captain Durie and I,
therefore, went home to order supper to be prepared, and Mrs. Durie
and Mrs. Holt, were quite in dudgeon with us, that we did not wait
for them to accompany us back to the shore. As we got down, our
visitors had just landed, and we piloted them up to our
habitations, and introduced them into Mrs. Durie's, where the table
was spread with such provisions as we had, and with wine and
spirits, of which they cheerfully partook. These gentlemen told me,
that my name was well known in America, and that they were very
glad to see me and my family, and would render us any service in
their power. They further said that if our long boat reached the
River Plate, it would be a miracle, and more than could be
reasonably expected, for there was a terrible sea to cross. I told
them that I would pay anything in reason, for a passage for myself,
my wife, son, and servant, to any place from whence there was a
chance of obtaining a passage to England, or Ireland. Captain
Fanning's and Captain Hunter's reply was, "Make yourself easy,
<i>General Holt</i>, we are bound to protect you and your family,
and if every one else should pay, you and yours must go free, as
you are a citizen of the world." Captain Hunter also told Captain
Durie, that as he and I were so intimate with each other, he and
his family should be treated in the same manner.</p>

<p>We were so much delighted at the prospect of being, released
from our confinement to Eagle Island, that we were very merry, and
kept it up jovially with our new friends, until past twelve o'clock
that night. We talked of several matters concerning America, and
among other things, the Americans told us that there was a war
between America and Great Britain, but that, notwithstanding this,
they thought themselves in duty bound, as men and sailors', to save
the lives of people in distress, belonging to any country.</p>

<p>The next morning was, according to our reckoning, the fifth day
of April, but we were a day too fast, as there was a day lost in
our voyage out, so a day was gained in coming home. Captain' Durie,
and I, called all hands together, and when they were assembled, I
spoke to Hicton, as nearly as I can recollect, in these
words:&mdash;-"Captain Hicton, by your misconduct you have brought
many lives into jeopardy, upon this desolate island, and you do
not, even now, when you have an opportunity, seem at all sensible
of your duty to your passengers, and crew. You have done nothing as
yet, towards obtaining a passage for any of us, but leave us to our
own exertions and resources. I now tell you, that Captain Durie,
and myself, with our families, have determined to go with our
kind-hearted American friends&mdash;the gentlemen who are
present."</p>

<p>Sir Henry Hayes then stepped forward and said, that "No one
should go until all went together." I laughed at him, and told him
that "he had about as much command over me as he had over Miss
Pike,* when he attempted to take her out of her carriage."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* See Note, at page 122 of this volume.]</p>

<p>A loud laugh followed my remark. Captain Hunter then said, that
"He always felt happy in being able to save any one's life, or
relieve any man when in distress; and that he would, give up the
further prosecution of his voyage until he had landed us all either
in South or North America, whichever circumstances might make it
most desirable to do."</p>

<p>I said, "Now you ail have heard the generous offer made by
Captain Hunter. Let all those who are inclined to accept it, follow
me and step over on this side, and those who wish to remain on the
island let them stand by Sir Henry Hayes." I was followed by
Captain Durie, and every one, else, except George Hilton, Sir Henry
Hayes, Samuel Brickwell, and Mrs. Bindel. Hicton, seeing how
matters stood, asked, us first, "what, it was that we all wanted?"
and then said, that "as a good deal of the wreck still remained, if
it was the general wish that he should abandon his vessel, or give
her up to the Americans, he would do so, and make the best bargain
for us all that he could, but that we should sign a paper to this
effect," which we all did. He then signed articles, and the
Americans became masters of whatever remained of the
<i>Isabella</i>, and of the whole stores.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[6 April 1813]</p>

<p>On and after the 6th of April we received rations from the
Americans, viz. four pounds of bread, and three pounds of beef or
pork, which was double the allowance of bread, and two-thirds more
of salt meat, than we had hitherto received; a goose was also
allowed for every three persons, each day. Mrs. Durie and her
family, five in number, went to the <i>Nannina</i> brig, where she
lay, at New Island. Mary Spencer and Mrs. Hughes also went on board
the brig, with five marines and five sailors, making the total
seventeen. This thinned our camp on Eagle Island; and I would have
gone too, had not Captain Fanning advised me to remain with him and
Captain Hunter, "for the purpose," as he said, "of making a little
society for them," as these American gentlemen would not associate
with Hayes or Hicton.</p>

<p>The first thing the Americans began to remove from the wreck was
the oil, and then the ship's copper. The pearl shells they put into
casks; but when the oil and shells were ready for transportation, a
road was wanted by which the casks could be rolled to the other
side of the island.</p>

<p>I told Captain Fanning that if he would give me the men, I would
quickly lay out the road for him, as it was a business that I had
formerly practised. The ground was a bog, and full of small banks;
so I got the boarding pikes, and put them up for sights, and then
got the carpenter, with his adze, and Sergeant Beain with another,
and they soon knocked off the heads of these little round banks. I
kept two men, with boarding pikes, employed in filling in the
hollows with the sods, and in one week I had the road completed,
fit for rolling over the oil and pearl shells, and for the
conveyance of seal and sea-lion skins, or anything else. By this
means we got over the <i>Isabella</i>'s anchors, cables, and all
her iron work.</p>

<p>I frequently walked along the coast, and whenever I saw a shoal
of sea-elephants or lions, I immediately informed Fanning, and the
next morning he would proceed to the place with his boat's crew. I
generally accompanied him, and I thought the killing of these
animals very good sport. A large elephant is allowed to have ten
barrels of blood in it, and eight barrels of oil. I have
occasionally brought Mrs. Holt to see a shoal of these sea monsters
killed. Until she had actually seen them, she would not believe the
accounts that I had given her of their size.</p>

<p>Captain Fanning and Captain Hunter having joined my mess, we
lived very merrily together, as ''the two captains had the
management of the wine and spirits, and everything else; we did
not, therefore, stint ourselves. A few brace of ducks or other
birds were generally shot by Captain Fanning, which made a very
agreeable change J in our diet, in addition to the meat in store.
Sometimes we had beef, and sometimes pork, and sometimes the tongue
of a sea-elephant, as we saved the tongues of all that were
killed.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[25 April 1813]</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, April 25, Captain Fanning killed eleven
sea-elephants in about half ah hour. The geese now began to get
scarce, and Captain Fanning took his boat and went over to George's
Island. On the 4th of May, he brought back eighty-nine geese, which
they saved in the following manner: they drew out the entrails, and
put a handful of salt into each bird, and with this the goose would
keep very well for ten days, hanging in the store.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[11 May 1813]</p>

<p>On the 11th of May, Captain Fanning brought sixty-two geese from
the same island.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[16 May 1813]</p>

<p>On the 16th, a further supply of fifty geese; so that we had an
abundant supply of food after the Americans joined us.</p>

<p>During all this time we were busily occupied in moving
everything across the island, from the <i>Isabella</i> to the
shipping place; and there was a good cargo of seal and sea-lion
skins in the wreck, besides which we every day added to the
quantity by killing more of these animals.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[17 May 1813]</p>

<p>On Monday, the 17th of May, about four o'clock in the evening,
the <i>Nancy</i>, gun-brig, belonging to his Majesty King George,
hove in sight. At first we thought that she was the <i>Nannina</i>;
but Captain Hunter, when he looked at her through his spy-glass,
saw that she was an armed vessel. Captain D'Aranda was the
commander of the <i>Nancy</i>. Here was an upside-down turn in the
ministry, which put us all in a quandary, for much as I wished for
a deliverance from Eagle Island, I regretted that anything
unfortunate should happen to those who had so well treated us, and
who had acted in every respect like men and Christians.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Landin had served as the pilot to the <i>Nancy</i>,
to direct her where to find us. He was the only one of the six who
embarked in the long-boat, that returned. Mr. Landin came ashore
with Captain William D'Aranda; and the moment that he saw Captain
Hunter, he desired him to consider himself a prisoner, by which we
saw clearly that it was the English captain's intention to make a
prize of the <i>Nannina</i>, and the Americans prisoners of war. I
could not help thinking this a hard case, considering their conduct
to distressed British subjects.</p>

<p>Hunter answered, "Very well. Many a good man has been a
prisoner." I was very sorry indeed to hear this word prisoner.
Captain Fanning, with his boat's crew, were at this time absent
from Eagle Island, procuring geese, with a supply of which, as I
have before stated, they had returned the previous day.</p>

<p>I asked Lieutenant Landin, and Captain D'Aranda, to come and
take some refreshment, which they did, drinking tea with Mrs. Holt,
and taking a glass of wine with me. Mr. D'Aranda, was so good as to
ask me if I wanted anything for myself and family. I thanked him,
and told him that I wanted nothing, except a little tobacco, to
comfort my old man, Byrne; but, I observed, at the same time, that
my store of sugar was getting low. Mr. D'Aranda said he would send
both the next day, and he invited me to go and see the
<i>Nancy</i>, which I replied, that I should have much pleasure in
doing.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[18 May 1813]</p>

<p>The next day I went to pay my respects to Captain D'Aranda, who
sent a boat for me, with an officer in it, and had the yards
manned, when I went on board, and the same when I was coming away.
He could not have paid a greater compliment to any person of high
rank. Captain D'Aranda's table was furnished with various dishes,
and he told me to want for nothing. He ordered Beain to serve out
seven pounds of bread, and seven pounds of meat, and as many geese
as Bellingham could kill, so that we now had more victuals than we
could consume; and soon forgot the time when we were obliged to
live on two pounds of bread for a week. The two Americans continued
to live with me.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[25 May 1813]</p>

<p>On the 25th of May, the shallop returned, and she was
immediately made a prize of, by the orders of Captain D'Aranda, and
the Americans were made prisoners of war. We still remained in
camp, and looking out for the arrival of the brig
<i>Nannina</i>.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[15 June 1813]</p>

<p>At seven o'clock in the morning of the 15th of June, I spied the
brig coming in between New Island and Port Louis. I told Hunter and
Fanning, and we saw the <i>Nannina</i> bearing down to Jack's
Harbour, where the <i>Nancy</i> lay. As soon as she dropped anchor,
the <i>Nannina</i> was boarded, by one of the officers of the
gun-brig, and Captain Valentine Barnet, an old man, sixty-nine
years of age, was ordered ashore, and Captain Basil Pease with him;
and they both came to Newtown Providence that night. I received
them with as much respect&mdash;perhaps more, than if they had been
commanding vessels. I felt for them, with all my heart, and tried
to make-them as comfortable as I could, in their misfortune. But
the old gentleman's case was the worst; for on the fourteenth, in
the morning, Captain. Charles Barnet went ashore to kill a few fat
hogs, to bring on board, fearing, that having so many more mouths,
the provisions might run short on the voyage, there being
forty-eight persons, in addition to the ship's company.</p>

<p>Five marines, and-three of the <i>Isabella's</i>'s old sailors,
weighed anchor and came away, leaving two of the <i>Isabella's</i>
sailors, three American sailors, and Barnet ashore. So that old
Captain Barnet's case was doubly distressing, being made a prisoner
himself, and losing his son. The reason that there were so many
captains on board the <i>Nannina</i>, may require to be explained.
These gentlemen, knowing that war was about to break out between
the United States and Great Britain, agreed, in New York, to make a
voyage as a joint speculation, for the purpose of procuring oil and
skins, and they all shipped themselves in this one vessel, to be
out of the way of the war. Here was another example that it is no
use attempting to avoid trouble or danger, although it is every
man's duty to do what he thinks is best, that he may have nothing
to reproach himself with, in the hour of trial.</p>

<p>I pitied, these poor gentlemen very much, and my sorrow for them
was nothing more than a debt of gratitude; but I said little,
remembering the proverb, that "a shut mouth denotes a steady head."
By a letter which I received from New York, I learned that young
Captain Barnet had never been heard of since, so that it is
probable he perished on the island, with the other poor fellows. I
think that leaving these men on the island, was a disgrace to the
British flag, and much worse in every respect than the seizure of
the <i>Nannina</i>, considering the humane service in which she was
employed.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[20 June 1813]</p>

<p>We all remained ashore, until the 20th of June, when I received
a note from Captain D'Aranda, saying, that he wished that I should
come on board his vessel, with my family, and he sent the shallop
round to carry our goods to the <i>Nancy</i>. I rose early, and got
my cot, bed, and trunks, across the island, the poor American
captains helped me to pack them, and they made their men carry my
luggage over for me. I thanked them, and shook hands with them, at
the same time assuring them that if I ever could serve them in any
way, I would do so, and this was my intention. I left old Jack
Byrne with them, as he felt himself very unwell on the water, and I
therefore wished him to remain until the last moment ashore.</p>

<p>When I saw my goods safely on board the shallop, my son and
myself walked through the mountains, to where the <i>Nancy</i> lay,
and we arrived there full two hours before the shallop. I must say,
that Captain D'Aranda used towards me, and my family, every
politeness and civility. He never had a party at dinner but he
invited Mrs. Holt, my son, and myself. We were put on the starboard
side of the gun-room, and Doctor Price on the larboard side, The
Doctor with the two Lieutenants, and myself, messed in the
gun-room.</p>

<p>I went twice to see my old American messmates, bringing some
tobacco with me, and I told them what I had heard concerning
themselves and vessel. Doctor Price and I became very intimate. He
was always at my side, except when he was going through his
inspections, and a very hard drinking man he was. While the
<i>Nancy</i> was smoked, Mrs. Holt and I paid a visit to the
<i>Nannina</i>, and spent a day on board of her, with our old
friends Captain and Mrs. Durie. They also felt very sorry for our
American benefactors, who had been plundered of their feather-beds,
which were ripped open, and the feathers let fly away with the
wind, and boat-sails made of the ticken.* The issue of wine and
spirits to the Americans, was also stopped; they were deprived of
the comforts of life, and put on half allowance, and under decks,
and yet the men were made to work. Which I always thought was
contrary to the treatment of prisoners of war, but the longer a man
lives the more he learns.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In the eyes of an Irish peasant, this
treatment of a feather-bed, (which is considered as a respectable
marriage portion), would appear almost as unpardonable an offence
as sacrilege.]</p>

<p>I heard that the <i>Nannina</i> brig was to sail from the
Falkland Islands, direct to England, and as I wished to shorten my
journey homewards, I wrote to Captain D'Aranda, as follows:</p>

<p class="letter">To Captain Dirlanda.*<br>
Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
I hope you will pardon my impartnance to pursume to ask the liberty
of going in the <i>Nannina</i> brig as I hear she is to sail
streight to England. My long absence from my country and the eager
desire to embrace a child dearly belove by her parens haiseings my
wishes to go. your complying with this will ever obblige your very
umble sarvant to command.<br>
<br>
Joseph Holt.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Holt's spelling has been preserved in this
letter, as a specimen of his orthography.]</p>

<p>The captain sent for me, and told me I might go in the
<i>Nannina</i>, but he said that he was afraid the accommodations
were not fit for me or my wife.</p>

<p>I thanked him kindly, and said that as it was but a short
passage, we would put up with whatever accommodations there were,
and proceed in the <i>Nannina</i>. So Captain D'Aranda, having
given me my wish, left me, and I made ready to shift my
quarters.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[10 July 1813]</p>

<p>On the 10th day of July, I moved to the <i>Nannina</i>.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[27 July 1813]</p>

<p>On the 27th, she sailed. She had been robbed of her compass, and
there were no lamps, nor had we as much spare rope as would fetter
a frog, nor a second sail to put up, if we lost one. Our orders
were to stay outside of the islands, until the <i>Nancy</i> came to
us. We sailed in the morning, and a gale of wind coming on, we bore
away, towards the river Plate, and when we were within eight hours
of reaching the mouth of that river, a strong head-wind came, which
drove us to sea again.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[14 August 1813]</p>

<p>On the fourteenth of August we got in sight of Grande Island,
and only for old Barnet, who knew the coast, we should have been
lost. The Americans, for self-preservation, often went up aloft to
take in reefs and handle the sails. Old Barnet said to me that we
had gone within five feet of the rock, when we went through a
passage only about one hundred feet wide, and with very dangerous
rocks on both sides; but he got us out of danger, and told Mr. Ash,
the Prize Master, where we were. We then bore out to sea, and
sailed more by guess than by knowledge, as we had no maps on board
nor anything to direct us, except old Barnet's memory; and a very
fine old fellow he was, as I ever saw.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[16 August 1813]</p>

<p>On the sixteenth of August we saw a sail to windward, and
thought that she was an enemy. I went below, and took out of my
trunk three hundred dollars, which I 'hid under the lower deck. If
the enemy proved to be an American I felt there was no fear of my
dollars, but it was "better to be sure than sorry." We bore towards
her gallantly, and when she saw that we were inclined to meet her,
she tacked about and took another course.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[21 August 1813]</p>

<p>On the twenty-first we saw the Sugar-loaf, a great high mountain
just at the entrance of Rio de Janeiro, and on the twenty-third we
came to anchor.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[23 August 1813]</p>

<p>When the Americans came on deck I shook hands with them, and
thanked them for all the service they had done me; and I told them
that I was ready to serve them in return. I moreover said, that I
felt it was my duty to become their servant, and to do what I could
for their comfort. "Go," said I, "and write your letters, and I
will deliver them. I do not care a farthing for one nation more
than another, beyond what honour and manhood requires."</p>

<p>Captain Hunter then said, "Holt, I was mistaken in you, though
many told me that you would stand our friend, I did not think
so&mdash;now I see the difference between what I was told and what
I thought. I now feel every confidence in you." He then wrote to
General Thomas Sumpter's secretary; the General was Minister
Plenipotentiary of the United States. When Captain Hunter's letter
was ready I called a canoe, and went ashore in it, and inquired for
General Sumpter's office, which I soon found. I went up stairs and
inquired for General Sumpter, when one of the clerks pointed him
out to me where he sat. I stepped over, and inquired if he was the
gentleman for whom my letter was directed; to which he answered
that he was.</p>

<p>I then gave him the letter, which he opened, and began to read
it; but when he came to the place where my name was mentioned in
it, he stopped short, and looking at me very earnestly said, "Sir,
will you walk this way?" upon which I followed him into his private
room. General Sumpter then said, "Pray, sir, are you the man who
commanded in Ireland in the year 1798?" I answered, "Yes, sir, I
am." He gave me his hand and said, "that he was glad to see me,
observing that my present conduct was like my former character,
very much to my credit. He then made me sit down, and I related to
him the whole transaction with respect to the Americans and the
<i>Nannina</i>.</p>

<p>Hicton had offered to swear that he did not engage the Americans
to take us off from the Falkland Islands, but I had made notes of
the matter. I had also a few honest fellows, who would not fail to
speak the truth; and I told General Sumpter that, if he pleased, I
would put my journal into his hand the next day, but he said it was
not necessary.</p>

<p>He then entered into conversation with me, asking me several
questions about New South Wales, and many other things. Mr. Sumpter
then wrote a letter to Captain Hunter, which he handed to me, and I
returned with it to the <i>Nannina</i>.</p>

<p>The next morning Admiral Dixon came on board the brig; Mr. Ash,
the Prize Master, was on shore, and the Americans were below. The
Admiral came over to where I was standing, and I saluted him.. He
asked me if I was one of the people who had been shipwrecked on the
Falkland Islands. I told his worship that I was, and I related to
him, as clearly as time would admit, all the particulars of our
story.</p>

<p>The Admiral then inquired where the Americans were? I told him
that they were below, and I called them upon deck. Old Barnet and
Hunter came upon deck, and they related to the Admiral exactly as I
had done the circumstances of their conduct; and old Barnet, in
conclusion observed that it was a bad job for him. "I think not,"
said Admiral Dixon, "it was the hand of God that guided you there
to save so many lives."</p>

<p>He then turned to me and asked, "How long had you been on Eagle
Island before the gentlemen arrived there?"</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[24 August 1813]</p>

<p>I told him "From the eighth of February to the fourth of April,
living on two pounds of bread and one pound of beef or pork; and,"
I added, "the Americans generously gave us plenty of food. It is my
opinion, your worship," said I, "that a vessel taken up by British
subjects, and for the purpose of saving their lives, ought to be
considered as an exception to the general rule respecting prizes.
Although there was a war between England and America at the time
that the <i>Nannina</i> was seized, the conduct of the Americans
towards us clearly showed that there was no enmity on their
part."</p>

<p>The Admiral said that he agreed with me, and he told the
Americans to go ashore, and to consider themselves no longer as
prisoners. This pleased me very much, to find that my poor friends
were once more at liberty. So we got ready to go ashore; and I
Called a canoe, in which we all went, with my wife and son, and
landed at the Palace Square. On going into the town, I saw the
English flag hanging to a pole, at the door of a house. I entered,
and called for a pint of rum, in order to give a couple of men a
glass; the landlord brought me about three naggins.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Naggin, or noggin, is the common name in
Ireland for a quarter of a pint measure.]</p>

<p>I looked at him very keenly, and asked him, if he kept up his
old fashion of short measure?&mdash;I knew him at once, and also
the woman that was with him; his name was Thomas Green, from
Cumberland, and the woman's name was Mary Dalton, from Dublin, and
both of them came out to Port Jackson, in the Tillicherry. He
called me out, and begged of me very earnestly not to say that I
had ever seen him in New South Wales. I promised him that I would
say nothing about the matter; whatever his honesty may have been,
he certainly always was a very civil and well-spoken man: and he
provided a lodging for me at the house of Patrick Rowley, from the
County of Kerry, a carpenter by trade. We lived in St. Joseph
Street, just above the Palace Square. I lodged there for fifty-nine
days before I sailed for Saint Salvador.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[25 August 1813]</p>

<p>The next day I returned to the <i>Nannina</i>, and, 25. having
got a boat, brought all my goods ashore. After I had got myself
settled in my lodgings, I went to pay a visit to General Sumpter,
who made me spend the day with him and Mrs. Sumpter. There was also
with them Mrs. Rutter, wife of Counsellor* Rutter.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Quere</i> Consul?]</p>

<p>They seemed highly entertained at the relation of my adventures,
although some of the passages in my life must have been mortifying
to the breast of humanity. When I mentioned the treatment I had
received from Governor King, and from Foveaux, they wondered that
the law of Great Britain could ever be administered in so base a
manner; and when I told them of the hardships that my wife had
suffered in consequence, and of her excellence and faithful
attachment to me through all my misfortunes, they requested of me
most earnestly,, and indeed made me promise, that I would bring my
wife and son to dine with them, and asked me to appoint the day. I
thanked-.those ladies most graciously for the honour they had done
me in inviting my wife to dine with them, and I requested that they
would be so good as to name the day when we should wait upon them.
They fixed upon the Friday following, and we attended according to
my promise.</p>

<p>I spent that evening with the greatest pleasure. General Sumpter
made me some very handsome presents; and at seven o'clock I took my
leave of the ladies, and returned to the city, where I found my
poor wife fretting at my long absence. I told her where I had been,
and that I had promised that she and my son should dine with the
general and his lady on the following Friday, when I would
introduce her to Mrs. Sumpter, and to Counsellor Rutter's lady.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[29 August 1813]</p>

<p>The general's seat was about a mile out of the city, in a
beautiful part of the country, just by where Sir Sidney Smith
lived. We went there; and, in the whole course of my life, I never
received so many compliments as I did on that day. After dinner,
the band sat in the verandah, and played various tunes and marches;
among the rest, "Erin go bragh." The day and the evening was spent
with the highest satisfaction. There was a large party of gentlemen
and ladies, to all of whom Mr. Sumpter presented me; telling the
company, at the same time, of the manner I had acted towards their
countrymen, and producing Captain Hunter's letter, which he made
the company read. "This," he said "is an additional testimony of
the character of General Holt, which is well known in the United
States, and his latter conduct will increase the high respect in
which he is held by the American people."</p>

<p>General Sumpter was so good as to say, that he would be very
happy if I would come and stay at his house during the time of my
remaining in the country; but he said, "I ought to mention to you,
that a compliance with my wishes might hurt you in the eyes of the
English! Government." I thanked the general, and said, "Sir, I do
not think that it can injure any man keeping the company of a
gentleman." I further told him, that although there were many
Englishmen and Irishmen here, yet not one of them had paid me any
attention, or offered me the least civility, since my arrival.
Again thanking him for his kind proposal, which, however, I
gratefully declined, I said, that I would do myself the honour of
calling to see him and his good lady occasionally, and that I did
not care whether my visits pleased or vexed any one.</p>

<p>Counsellor Rutter asked me many questions about the shipwreck;
and told me the manner to proceed, to get every one an allowance of
provisions daring the time that we remained in harbour. I felt much
obliged to him, as I always desired to be of service to my
fellow-creatures, who did not know how to help themselves. He
directed me to draw out a list of the names of every one who was
shipwrecked in the <i>Isabella</i>, and to hand it to Consul
Cunningham, who was the English Consul, under the Plenipotentiary
of Great Britain. As it was now eight o'clock at night, Mrs. Holt
felt anxious to get home to our lodging, where our trunks were, for
they contained our fortune, and she did not wish to give an
opportunity for vice. The general's carriage was ordered to the
door for our accommodation, and we took our leave of the company.
When we came to our lodgings, we found all our things safe there,
and just as we had left them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[30 August 1813]</p>

<p>The next morning, I drew out a statement, in conformity with Mr.
Rutter's suggestion, and laid it before Consul Cunningham, who did
not seem inclined to be civil; but observed that I, and some'
others mentioned in the list, had no right to get any relief. He
looked very fiercely at me. I returned his look as little in the
lamblike fashion as I was able, and replied, "Sir, I was not aware,
that when the Act of Parliament was made for the preservation of
his Majesty's, subjects, that there were any exceptions. I know
what the law is, and I will take care that it shall be put in
force." I then left his office; and I was never yet conquered when
I was right. I determined at once to apply to headquarters.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[31 August 1813]</p>

<p>The next morning, I drew up a short memorial to his Excellency
Lord Strangford, to which I signed my name, and took it 'to his
house myself. When his Excellency received it, he gave orders to
his man to bring me into the drawing-room, and to say that he would
be with me in a few minutes. I followed the servant, and sat down,
and in five minutes his Lordship walked in. I got up, and saluted
him, but he made me sit down, and he was good enough to sit down
beside me. To my great surprise, he asked me, when I had heard from
my brother? I told his Lordship about eighteen months ago.</p>

<p>"Sir," said his Excellency, "I was at Ballyarthur when you were
very busy in that neighbourhood, and often expected that you would
pay us a visit." His Lordship further said, that "he was very well
acquainted with my brother William."</p>

<p>I told his Excellency, that it gave me great pleasure to see a
noble gentleman like himself at so great a distance from Ireland,
and one who knew my friends. I said, "My Lord, I never thought of
paying you a visit before this day; but I hope, as you have
graciously condescended to recognise me, that you will take under
your humane care the poor shipwrecked creatures, as whose
representative I appear before your Excellency, and who stand in
need of a great and powerful friend like yourself. It is their
sufferings which have induced me to trespass upon your Lordship's
notice."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Upon my mentioning this passage in Holt's
autobiography, to Lord Strangford, his Lordship said, that he had
but a very faint recollection of seeing Holt at Rio de Janeiro. "My
only acquaintance in the traitor line," observed Lord Strangford,
"whom I remember to have found at Rio, was old Margarot, the
Scotchman, one of our aboriginal reformers. I saw much of him, oil
his return, with his wife, and an old cat, which had accompanied
him from Scotland, and been the companion of his exile."<br>
<br>
Lord Strangford, upon my subsequently submitting the above passage
to him, informs me that, "Holt is wrong in many of his statements."
"I cannot conceive," writes his Lordship, "that I could have spoken
to him of Ballyarthur, where I never was in the whole course of my
life; nor of his brothers, of whose existence I knew nothing, till
I received your letter this morning."]</p>

<p>Lord Strangford told me, that he would go as far as his
authority allowed him to do. I then related the treatment I had
received from Mr. Cunningham. I said, "My Lord, if Mr. Cunningham
had handed me a pistol, and kept another himself, I should have
known what to do; but he acted very unlike a gentleman in the
manner he addressed me." My Lord smiled, and said he was very sorry
that Consul Cunningham did not know me; but he desired me to call
the following morning upon the Consul, and that he would then
probably know who I was, and do anything for me that I
required.</p>

<p>When I was about going, I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled
out my bills, to show his Excellency who my agent was in New South
Wales; and I asked his lordship if he would give me cash for one
hundred and seventy pounds, which was the smallest bill I had. He
said he could not do so, and that there was no occasion. I
answered, that it was a pity to see a man in want, who had a full
and fair demand by bills upon the national treasury of England, for
two thousand five hundred pounds, observing, that "though my paper
was good, it made a bad dish to bring to table to satisfy the
appetite, when it could not be converted into available cash."</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[1 September 1813]</p>

<p>His Excellency said, that he felt satisfied Mr. Cunningham would
arrange everything for me to my entire satisfaction. I accordingly
waited upon Mr. Cunningham the next morning, at his office. He
received me in a very different manner indeed to what he did at
first.</p>

<p>He shook hands with me, brought a chair for me, which he placed
close to his own, and took down every name from my memorial, and
after that every one was paid one shilling and threepence per day,
and had their provisions on board the <i>Nannina</i> during their
stay. As for myself and family, I was in no want; but sooner than
let Mr. Cunningham have the money, I drew at my departure for
myself, wife, and son, the one and three-pence a day each for
fifty-nine days, which made the sum of ten pounds eighteen
shillings and three-pence sterling: for I thought that if I did not
draw this money, it would come to Mr. Cunningham, as it is such
little windfalls as this would have been, that make up the
emoluments of men placed in government situations abroad. It may be
judged of what service this allowance-money was to those who
suffered shipwreck with me, as it enabled them to lay in various
little stores, which made them comfortable on their passage
home.</p>

<p>Had I not followed up this business, and taken the proper means
of obtaining this allowance, we never should have got one shilling,
and all that money would have fallen a prize to those who had the
care of the English funds abroad. Mr. Russell was our Vice-Consul
at Rio de Janeiro; he was an Irishman, and very good to his
countrymen.</p>

<p>I was brought into court concerning the <i>Nannina</i>, and I
made a statement of everything that happened, from the 4th of April
till the 24th day of August. Admiral Dixon, his Excellency Lord
Strangford, the American Minister, Spanish Minister, Dutch and
French, all met for the purpose of seeing whether the American
vessel could be made a prize, as she was employed by British
subjects, and in saving of lives.* In this point lay the question;
otherwise as there was a war between the two nations, there could
be no doubt that she was a lawful prize.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Lord Strangford remarks on this
statement:&mdash;"The meeting of the admiral, the foreign
ministers, and myself, is a complete fabrication. England and
Portugal were at war with Holland and France, and there was neither
a Dutch nor a French minister, nor even a consul for the States at
Rio de Janeiro during the whole of my long residence there. As to
the American, Mr. Sumpter, it happened that literally and exactly
we never met, nor interchanged one word with each other, till the
very night before I left Rio, in 1815! when accident threw us
together at the house of the Marqueza de Bellas. I have, for
particular reasons, a most <i>perfect recollection of this
fact</i>."]</p>

<p>It was admitted by every one, that the greatest credit was due
to the Americans for their conduct, of assisting their enemies in
distress,. Admiral. Dixon gave his opinion in favour of the
Americans, and desired that the <i>Nannina</i> should be released
and put in order for them. I forgot to mention, that on leaving the
Falkland Islands, the small shallop, which was made fast to
the-<i>Nannina</i>, was lost in one of the storms which we
encountered. The Americans required that this shallop should be
made good, with all their other losses, upon which the case was
ordered to stand over, until Captain D'Aranda came in from Buenos
Ayres. Upon his arrival, he insisted, that by the law of nations
and of war, the <i>Nannina</i> was a lawful prize; and he re-seized
her, and brought her home to England, where she was sold. This I
have by letter from Valentine Barnet, of New York. However, I did
my duty, and all that was in my power to serve the Americans; nor,
by doing so, have I incurred the displeasure of any of the English
that had honour and humanity in their hearts.</p>

<p>I often visited my friend Mr. Sumpter, and I always found both
him and Mrs. Sumpter very much pleased to see me. He wished me to
go to America to live, and the General said that he would get me a
very fine estate there, which I have no doubt he would have done,
as I found him, up to the moment that we parted, act fully up to
his professions.</p>

<p>The unfortunate negroes, who are brought to this place from
Africa, ere publicly sold in the market-place. When a ship-load of
them arrives here, and are landed, they are driven for sale into a
large Square, in the centre of which there are five or six great
boilers fixed, where these unfortunate creatures boil some cabbage.
Every six of them have a small tub, capable of holding about two
gallons of water; into these tubs a certain quantity of a
substance, very much resembling oatmeal, is put, and then a ladle
full of boiling water is poured on this meal, with a cabbage-leaf
or two. No sooner is the boiling water added, than it becomes a
mess as thick as "stir-about," which they eat with their hands,
haying no kind of spoon or other convenience for doing so. When a
purchaser comes to look at these poor wretches, they are all made
to stand up, and the person who wants to buy examines them, in the
same manner as a man would a horse at a fair, looking at their
teeth and limbs; and when he agrees for the number that he wants,
he pays down his money, and drives them home.</p>

<p>The purchaser then drives them through the town, and shows them
the way in which they are to get their living, either by carrying
water, or baskets, or in various other ways; and after four or five
days they must earn for their master one cruzado a day, that is,
two shillings and sixpence, Sundays as well as week-days. Good,
young negroes, sell at from fifty to sixty pounds each, which
produces to the purchaser, during the life of the slave, seventeen
and sixpence a week. The owner of ten negroes is accounted to be a
person of no bad fortune, having one pound five shillings paid down
to him every night. No excuse will be taken for the non-payment of
this money; but what surprised me was, to see the negroes working
on the Sabbath day, in a country which is filled with priests, and
friars, and monks; though, indeed, they pay more attention there to
holidays than they do to Sundays.</p>

<p>There was hardly a week, during the time that I remained at Rio
de Janeiro, in which one or two saints' holidays were not observed.
During the day-time there is not much appearance of anything
particular going forward,, but at night there are bonfires, and
other marks of rejoicing, with sky-rockets, and all sorts of,
powder inventions, illuminations, singing psalms, and moving images
about. It is, indeed,, a grand sight to behold the image, of the
Virgin Mary with our Saviour in her arms, and the figures of
several saints, as large as the size of life, and dressed up as if
they were living. I went to see some of these processions, and they
exceeded anything that I ever saw, or am likely to see again. There
were numbers of little children, about eight years old, dressed in
the finest clothes, made to imitate angels, with wings fixed to
their shoulders; and these beautiful little creatures went along
the streets singing psalms. They were followed by images and an old
priest, who was reading prayers and chanting psalms, with two
negroes holding large wax candles in their hands; and then came the
young students, walking after the elders of their church.</p>

<p>It is beyond my knowledge to describe the images that are to be
seen in every church; and at all hours of the day and night, people
are to be found; with beads in their hands, praying before these
figures. I have been brought in by different parties, to view the
works in their churches; and I have seen the images of John the
Baptist, and John the Evangelist, and Jonathan, the son of Saul;
and I never expect to see the like again, while I am on this earth.
I saw, in the same church, the image of our Saviour, as he was
crucified, and the mark of where the spear-wound was in his side.
To look upon that glorious image, ought to make the most hardened
sinner repent of his sins.</p>

<p>My beard was now of fourteen years' growth; and I used to comb
it down regularly; The priests took me for a German, but some of
the Americans told them what countryman I was, and that I wore my
beard on account of the misery of my country, and as mourning for
my banishment. Then the priests were twice as partial to me as
before, and would say, "Senhor &aacute; grande esta bom," that is,
Sir, it is very good.</p>

<p>I wondered much at the manner in which the priests visited the
sick. When any person that was ill wanted to have the priest, and
sent for one, the priest would not obey the summons, unless
accompanied by eight soldiers and a drummer, and during all the
time that the priest remained within, the drummer kept beating his
drum, and-upon the' coming out of the priest, the soldiers would
fire a round, and then walk away.</p>

<p>Within an hour after any person died, two stout negroes made
their appearance, bearing a long pole and a thing like a hammock,
with strings to each end of it. The corpse being put into that
strong cloth or net and sowed up, they carried it out and laid it
upon the ground. Then the negroes placed the pole beside it, and
tied the cloth in which the dead body was wrapped, to the pole, and
by this means raising it up, away they went to the burial ground.
There they laid down their burthen, and stripping off the cloth,
tumbled the corpse into a hole by the side of which two more
negroes were waiting to do their part of the work, prepared with a
large piece of wood like a paving rammer. The moment the body was
in the hole, they began to pound it till every bone was broken in
pieces; then a full tub of lime was pitched into the hole, and
after it a tub full of <i>Agoa</i>, that is what they call water,
upon the lime. Over this they put a covering of twelve inches of
clay, and so leave it. In the course of ten days the negroes would
raise the bones and burn them; so in this, kind of way they always
had holes ready for use.</p>

<p>This was the manner in which all the Europeans were interred,
until Sir Sidney Smith got a piece of ground for a burial place,
and had it walled in; and there has been a very fine church, built
there. Ever since, the sailors and Europeans are buried there, in
the same manner as in England. All this I have myself seen.</p>

<p>The female negroes stand in a pond of water, and wash clothes at
so much a dozen, and they are obliged to pay their masters, every
night, two shillings and sixpence. I was one day in the market,
where bought some salad, and I put it up in a handkerchief. There
were nearly forty negroes about me with their baskets, but my
purchase was so small, that I thought I could carry it home myself,
very well, without the assistance of any one; but I have been told,
that I ran a very great risk of being murdered in doing so, as in
this city a man thinks nothing of plunging a knife into you, at the
slightest offence; and if he killed you dead on the spot, and he
could get to one of the churches, and put his little-finger in the
key-hole, until the Padre came, his life was safe. Several
murderers have been pointed out to me, walking about the streets,
and some that had killed three or four men.</p>

<p>During the time that I was at Rio, I saw no less than five
persons suffer death; they were all murderers, and my Lord
Strangford went to the Queen, and told her that she should follow
the English law, and hang every murderer. The Sept Queen did not
think very well of this advice at first, but when his lordship
spoke in a threatening manner, she gave her consent, and no one who
was not there, ever saw such a hanging match as it was. The moment
the hangman had the rope fixed upon the neck of the criminal, he
put his feet upon the shoulders of the man that was to die, and it
was a most horrible sight to see the devil of an executioner,
dancing on the other wretch, to put him out of the world.</p>

<p>In my eyes the women here are the handsomest race in the world.
Their skin is beautiful, equal in clearness to the skin of a new
laid egg; their eyes are black as sloes, their hair is dark,
shining like polished jet, and falls in ringlets over their face,
their teeth are as even as rows of printing, and white as pearls;
their eye-brows are like those of a doll, their waists of the
nicest form, and their feet and legs as if they were modelled in
wax-work. They are most complete patterns of the neatest form for a
woman. What helps to make the appearance of those nice ones even
more beautiful, is that in one street you would probably see women
of five or six different tints of colour; but women no more than
other things, should not be taken by their looks, for these
heavenly creature's that I have described, may be very devils in
temper. I have seen much deception in the course of my life, but
thanks be to God, I have surmounted those who thought to have taken
me in, at many times, and in various places.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[October 1813]</p>

<p>During my stay in the city of Rio de Janeiro, I continued,
occasionally,, to pay my respects to General Sumpter, and
Counsellor Rutter, and at length I agreed with John Hutchinson,
Captain of the <i>Venerable</i> brig, bound to Liverpool, for my
passage to England. This was a great relief to my mind,, and I went
immediately, and informed General Sumpter.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[14 October 1813]</p>

<p>He made me remain with him the whole of this day, which was the
14th of October, 1813, and Mrs. Sumpter and. Mrs. Rutter were, so
good as to say that I must come with my family, and spend another
day with, them. The day was appointed, and the General was to send
his carriage for Mrs. Holt, as the country was so very warm, for at
that time my wife was not very well, and it was dangerous for her
to walk in the heat of the day.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[16 October 1813]</p>

<p>We went on the 16th of October, and passed the day with much
pleasure. There was a very large party in the evening, and as Mrs.
Holt was walking in the garden, with the ladies, Mrs. Sumpter told
her not to provide any cordials for her voyage, as she had a case
ready packed for her. It was untruth to call what was in that case
cordials, for many a one drank a glass out of it, and could not
tell what they were drinking. This was the last evening we spent at
Mr. Sumpter's.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[17 October 1813]</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Holt received her case of cordials, and as the
General found that I was fond of smoking, he sent me a basket of
cigars, to amuse me on the passage. I went again to call upon
Captain Hutchinson, and repeated the agreement I had made with him,
which was to pay him one hundred and fifty pounds sterling, for the
passage of myself, my wife, and son, for which he was to furnish
our table with fresh meat, and poultry, every day during the
passage; and after dinner, he and we were each to drink a bottle of
good Madeira wine. He observed that Mrs. Holt and my son would not
be able to drink their bottle. My answer was a simple one, that as
he proposed no reduction in the passage money, there should be none
in the allowances, for what they were not able to drink, I might
have no objection to.</p>

<p>"He must be a bad man," said I, "that would not take his wife's
part, on such an occasion." He asked me how much spirits I should
wish to have in the course of the day? I told him I was no tippler,
and therefore never put myself upon an allowance, but as he had put
the question to me, I might as well candidly tell him, that I
thought four glasses in the four and twenty hours would not
seriously hurt my constitution, nor his store. He then said that he
was only joking, and that I should have as much wine and spirits as
I pleased to call for. I desired him to commit our agreement to
paper, as then there could be no mistake. He said there was no
occasion, for he had heard too much of me and my character to have
any doubt in his dealings with me.</p>

<p>In addition to the one hundred and fifty pounds, Captain
Hutchinson was to get one shilling and three-pence a head, for
every day that we were on board his vessel, so that both sums added
together, it was well worth his while to provide comfortably for us
during what is reckoned as a ten weeks' passage.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>21. Passage to England</h2>

<p>Having finally Agreed with Mr. Hutchinson, I moved my goods on
board the <i>Venerable</i> brig, and left myself as little as
possible to do on shore. I went to the Consul's office, and
received the money due to me, which Was ten pounds, eighteen
shillings, and three-pence, sterling, and an order from the Consul
to Captain Hutchinson, to receive on board the <i>Venerable</i>
brig, Joseph Holt, Hester Holt, Joseph Harrison Holt, and John
Byrne, my servant, and that John Hutchinson would be paid for each
person, the regular payment allowed by the law of Great Britain. I
delivered the order myself, to Mr. Hutchinson, who received it
without objection, and after that, he was bound to carry me and my
family to England.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[21 October 1813]</p>

<p>On the 21st of October, 1813, I took leave of General Sumpter
and his lady; after breakfast he went and wrote a protection as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To all Commanders of any public or private armed Ship, of the
United States&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Sir,<br>
<br>
If the bearer heare of General Joseph Holt should fall into your
power I do recommend [<i>him</i>] and his famely to your friendship
and attension. I have myself the proofe his Justice and friendship
to Amerricans who was taken by the British brig of War <i>Nancy</i>
while engaged in relieving the crew of a brutish ship which was
wrecked on the faulkland islands in which General Holt and family
was passengers. I therefore pray you to facilitate as much as
circumstances will purmit the continuance of his voyage home.
Whatever he sayes is his own property it is to be pursarve and kepe
will be respected as such and not taken from him.<br>
<br>
I have the honour to be, Sir,<br>
Your obblige sarvant,<br>
Thomas Sumton, <i>Jun</i>.<br>
Minaster Plenpottantrey of the United States<br>
at the Curt of Riedegan ne ro.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This letter is accurately printed from
Holt's manuscript, and although he states that, at the time of his
writing, the original was in his possession, the transcript has
been no doubt made from memory. In allusion to an improved version
of this letter, with which the same liberty of translation (if I
may so term it) was taken, as with the rest of Holt's manuscript,
Lord Strangford has remarked that, "Sumpter wrote remarkably well
and correctly; and I think," adds his lordship, "that he could
hardly have penned the whole of the document given by Holt."]</p>

<p>He gave the above written protection to me, and sealed it with
the eagle seal, leaving the letter open. I have it by me now, in
Dunleary. General Sumpter opened his desk, and said to me, "Sir,
from the nature of your misfortunes, perhaps you are out of hard
cash; here, take as much as you may want, of gold or silver, and on
my honour and word I do not wish you to return this money to me,
unless it is quite convenient for you to do so; but I do desire to
hear from you, of your health and welfare."</p>

<p>I answered, "General Sumpter, I am fully sensible of the
obligation your generous offer places me under to you, and I value
your friendship more than gold or silver. I am happy to be able to
assure you that I have hard cash enough left to serve me for a year
to come, at least; at the same time, I return you my sincere
thanks, and will ever bear in mind, and memory, your offer to
me."</p>

<p>I put out my hand, which he took, and held it in his for some
time; he then said, "I am afraid they will not receive you well, in
your country.&mdash;I mean that you will not be comfortable there;
and remember, if this should be the case, that America is always
large enough properly to maintain a true patriot, and will do so,
should you ever come there."</p>

<p>I am sorry to think, that as far as my experience goes, my
worthy friend, General Sumpter, spoke the truth to me, and many
times since my return, have I thought of what he said to me at
parting. It has, indeed, been my misfortune to be looked upon with
suspicion, and to be insulted by some of the lowest
ruffians&mdash;I do not mean in rank, but in bigotry&mdash;that the
world ever produced. But this has ever been the case in Ireland;
bigotry of various kinds rules that land, in the place of law and
justice. I am sorry that it comes within my knowledge to say this,
and the more so, as I fear that this will ever be the case.</p>

<p>I returned to the <i>Venerable</i> brig, and on the morning of
the twenty-third, our convoy fired a gun, and hoisted her signal
for sailing. We were convoyed by the Nereus, Nisus, and the
Inconstant, three frigates, with the Fairy and Satellite brigs, a
very strong convoy. Our number of merchant vessels, leaving the
rendezvous, was thirty-two. We passed the forts and batteries about
nine o'clock in the morning, and sailed for Saint Salvador. We had
very disagreeable winds during the passage.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[24 October 1813]</p>

<p>On the twenty-fourth, we were honoured by the company of Major
Kennedy, a Frenchman, who was under cover at Rio de Janeiro, and he
had agreed for his passage with Hutchinson. Myself and wife were
accommodated in the state cabin. Major Kennedy had one side of the
main cabin, and my son had the other. Captain Hutchinson slung his
cot in the centre of the cabin, Mr. William Moore, chief mate, lay
in a small room, and Mr. Crosby, the second mate, lay in another
small room opposite; so that we were stowed nearly as thick as
three in a bed. Major Kennedy was a very pleasant, funny gentleman,
but as he did not understand English, it made his jokes not easily
comprehended by us.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[19 November 1813]</p>

<p>On the 19th of November, we sailed down by the land, and coming
near Bahia, and finding that we could not get into harbour, by
daylight, our convoy made a signal for us all to lie-to. The total
number of our fleet, including our convoy, was thirty-seven sail.
Every vessel was ordered to hang out a lanthorn at the fore-mast
head; this was done in order to prevent the ships from getting foul
of each other.</p>

<p>About one o'clock in the morning, a brig called the Brothers,
struck against the <i>Venerable</i>, and had like to have sunk us.
There was a great hole made in our brig, just over my bed, which
much alarmed myself and my wife. The two vessels got their rigging
entangled together, and they were both obliged to cut away, to get
clear of each other. In the morning we made sail, and at ten
o'clock dropped anchor. The boat was lowered, and as I was ready to
go ashore, I went with Captain Hutchinson. "Captain," said I, "this
is a part of the world that I never was in before, and therefore I
think that I offer you a fair bet, which is, that we will meet
three persons ashore, to whom I am known." He refused my offer,
saying, "That if I was to go to the most remote part of the world,
I would be sure to be known."</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[20 November 1813]</p>

<p>Saint Salvador is a very old city, and is walled round, at the
sea-side. You must pass through a gate, at which there is a.
sentry, to get into the city. We went to an English hotel, kept by
Brown and Carter, and called for a bottle of cider. While we were
drinking it, a genteel looking man came in, and staring at me for a
few minutes, he asked me if I was General Holt? I told him that he
was not mistaken in believing me to be the man who was so called.
He wished much to detain me in conversation, but I was anxious to
view the city. I told him so, and went through as much of it as
time would allow. I had learned a little of the Portuguese
language, sufficient, at least, to enable me to ask a question or
two,, such as the way I should go, or for anything that I
wanted.</p>

<p>I went through the greatest part of the city that day, and
returned to the house of Brown and Carter, where I met some of the
sailors belonging to the brig, and as they had their boat ashore, I
returned with them to the <i>Venerable</i>. I described to Mrs.
Holt all that I had seen, and gave her an exact account of the form
of the city, and of the inhabitants, as far as I had seen them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[21 November 1813]</p>

<p>The next morning, a boat came from the shore, with a few people
in it of respectable appearance. I heard a man ask if there was a
passenger of the name of Holt on board. The mate answered, "Yes." I
went upon deck, and inquired who it was that wanted Holt? And a man
in the boat said, that he wished to see Holt. I told him to come on
deck, and that I would bring him to Holt. When he came on deck, I
desired him to follow me into the cabin, which he did, and I called
to the Steward for a bottle of wine. "Now," said I to my visitor,
"sit down, and just let us take a glass together, and while we are
doing so, you can tell me if you have any particular business with
Holt."</p>

<p>He said, that he only had a great wish to see him (and he kept
his eyes fixed upon me); that he had once seen Holt at his mother's
house, during the rebellion in Ireland, and that he was very
desirous of seeing him again. I told him, if he had anything to say
to Holt, he probably would never have a better opportunity of doing
so, than he had at the present moment. He caught me by the hand,
and said, that although he thought it must be me, yet be could not
be sure, for that I had got out of his perfect recollection. He
then told me that his name was Molloy, that he came from the County
of Kildare, and he reminded me of some circumstances which I had
forgotten, but when he mentioned them, they came back quite fresh
into my mind. We soon knew each other perfectly, and "Now, said he,
"if you want to know my business with Holt, it is to invite him and
his friends, to dine with me." He pointed out to me his house, and
told me that he kept the English Hotel, in Saint Salvador, where he
had made a very comfortable fortune.</p>

<p>I went ashore with Molloy, and an excellent house he has in that
city, where I spent a few hours with him. He reminded me of the
service I had done to his family, and said, that he was in
gratitude bound to pay me every respect and attention he could. He
was astonished when I told him that my wife and son had been in the
cabin, on board with us, and he most eagerly intreated of me to
promise to dine with him the next day, and to bring my family. I
said, that this must depend on how the water would be, as Mrs. Holt
was very timid in coming ashore.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[22 November 1813]</p>

<p>The next morning I went ashore, bringing my mistress with me,
but the hill was so steep, and the day so hot, and Mrs. Holt felt
herself so unwell, that she did not attempt to get up the hill, and
I returned with her and my son in the boat, to the brig. After
this, I went to my friend, Mr. Molloy's, and excused Mrs. Holt. He
and I had a repast, and some wine, while we were drinking of which,
he told me that he had made thirteen thousand pounds in seven
years, in the house in which we were, and he further said, that
when he got seven thousand pounds more, he would come back home to
Ireland. He told me the narrow escape he had in getting away. I
hope, notwithstanding his resolution to return to Ireland, that he
will stay where he is, and not come back to a nation full of
treachery, deception, and vile invention, where the people are
striving, one to cut the throat of another.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[23 November 1813]</p>

<p>I went the day following into the country to view the
plantations, but the bread-fruit interested me more than anything
else that I met with. I saw one hundred of this fruit growing upon
one tree, and each fruit as large as the largest twelve-penny loaf
in Ireland. In appearance it is like a great bladder filled with
fat. The first cut is crusty, but the second is like the cut of a
loaf; and ten minutes' toasting makes it fit for table. The flavour
is very nice. All sorts of spices, grow here, and there are people
here of all colours and of all countries. The streets of Saint
Salvador are very narrow, and the houses very high. I was walking
one day, when I came to the end of a narrow street, of which I
asked the name; but if I had walked a few steps, I might have
known it without asking, as the street was called after the
business which was carried on in it. I saw, in a cloud of dust,
twelve negroes, who were quite naked, grinding snuff, which was the
name of the street in question. And what from the heat of the
country, the stench of the negroes, and the penetrating dust of the
snuff, I should have thought it almost impossible to sustain life
there for half an hour. I never went ashore again after that
day.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[1 December 1813]</p>

<p>On the 1st of December our convoy fired a gun, and hoisted a
signal for sailing. Forty vessels immediately got under sail, and
about one o'clock we were outside Bahia, and steered for
Pernambuco, which is in latitude 8&deg;.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[4 December 1813]</p>

<p>The 4th of December we saw several Portuguese returning from
Pernambuco and Maranham, after disposing of their goods at these
places. And it was curious to see a high mast and great sails fixed
in a catamaran, which is a parcel of timber joined together, and no
boards to keep out the water. The captain sits on a three-legged
stool, up to his knees in water, and seems as proud as the greatest
captain in the British navy. We passed along very pleasantly, and
Major Kennedy amused us all very much by his attempts to speak
English. He would say, "Damn your eyes, and that good English." I
had much fun with him, telling him that he was getting impudent
since he had been admitted into the company of a <i>general</i>,
meaning myself. The Major would look at me very earnestly for some
time, and at last would make use of his new-learned words, "Damn
your eyes and that good English." Many little diverting things
occurred on the passage, which I do not take the trouble of setting
down.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[24 December 1813]</p>

<p>On the 24th of December, in the morning, we saw the hills over
Pernambuco; and in the evening, about seven o'clock, we were within
two leagues of the town, and our commodore made a signal for us to
lie-to till morning. Captain Hutchinson, on account of the fright
he had got at Bahia, hauled outside to windward, and kept his
station till morning.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[25 December 1813]</p>

<p>At day-light the signal was made to sail; and at eight o'clock
in the morning we came to anchor. This was the fourth Christmas-day
that I ate my dinner on the water. The boat was lowered, and
Captain Hutchinson, Major Kennedy, and myself went on shore. It was
my delight to go through all the towns that I could in foreign
countries, and to view the forts, and barracks, and all the public
works, as, old as I was, I did not know but that, in the chances of
war, it might come to my lot to storm some of these towns or
fortifications. Therefore I wished to inspect every place, examine
the harbours, take the bearing of the batteries, and look at the
entrances of the towns. I bought two chapeaux, with fruits of
various kinds; and I drank some good rum, at sixpence a quart, and
wine at nine-pence a quart. Oranges sold at four-pence a hundred,
limes at a penny a dozen, citrons at the same, guavas at a
halfpenny a dozen, and all other fruits at the same rates. I made a
purchase of some rum of superior quality, for two shillings a
gallon, and I bought a pine-apple for three-pence, and put it in my
rum, with a few orange peelings. In one week you could hardly know
that it was rum. This was my private store, which I kept in order
to give my old servant his grog as usual.</p>

<p>Pernambuco is built on a very nice hill, and it draws from the
water a gentle breeze, which makes this city, although it is in a
very hot climate, much more wholesome than Saint Salvador. The
houses are from three stories to five stories high, and the streets
so narrow, that a book or any other thing may be handed from the
window of one house to the opposite. I have, in walking down a
street, extended my arms from my body, and the street was not as
wide as my hands and arms stretched out. The only thing that I saw
which disgusted me, was the carcase of a dog hanging up for sale. I
asked the price of the hind quarter, and the butcher told me four
shillings. If the head had been cut off, I should never have
suspected that it was the carcase of a dog. I saw in this town the
handsomest woman that I ever beheld in any part of the world;, and
I likewise saw the ugliest woman there that ever drew breath, who
was one of the biggest also. One was as black and the other as fair
as nature ever created. All colours, all sizes, all forms, of men
and women, are to be seen here. There are fewer slaves in Saint
Salvador and Pernambuco than in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>Captain Hutchinson laid in at Pernambuco a stock of poultry,
fruit, and all things necessary for our voyage. On the 30th of
December the signal was made for sailing, and in thirty minutes
there were twenty-five anchors left in Pernambuco Roads, as the
anchorage is called. We got out safe, leaving our bower-anchor
after us; but we were better off than some of the other vessels,
for we brought away three-fourths of the cable. The
<i>Venerable</i> brig had nineteen thousand dry hides, besides
coffee, cotton, and wool.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[3 January 1814]</p>

<p>On the 3rd day of January, 1814, we made the island of Fernando,
in latitude four. It is a place that the Portuguese transport their
people to. Our vessel was a very bad sailer, which the Commodore
observing, he would occasionally send the <i>Fairy</i> brig back to pull
us on, by dropping a small cable, to which we made fast, and then
she soon had us first.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[10 February 1814]</p>

<p>We sailed very pleasantly until the 10th of February, on which
day there came a hurricane, and it was as much as we could do to
stand the sea. The <i>Venerable</i> had on her only her foresail
and stay-sail, and all hands were on deck. We parted with our
convoy in a gale, in latitude thirty-eight, and we had very foul
winds for several days afterwards.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[18 February 1814]</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>22. Life in England and

<p>On the 18th, at seven o'clock in the morning, we made Cape
Clear, in latitude 51&deg;, 22'.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[22 February 1814]</p>

<p>We had a variable wind up Channel; and on the 22nd we came into
the king's dock, at Liverpool, about twelve o'clock. I went up into
the town, to enquire for lodgings, and being recommended to Mrs.
Robinson, in Sparling-street, No. 87, I took lodgings from her at
fourteen shillings a week.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[27 February 1814]</p>

<p>On the 27th of February I took the coach to London, and I met in
it with Mr. Thomas Carty, from the county of Wexford. We passed the
time very agreeably, until we came to Stoney Pass, and the coach
stopped suddenly. I put out my head, and found neither the coachman
nor guard in their places. I called to Mr. Carty to come out, and
to hand me one of the pistols, saying, "Come, we will not suffer
ourselves to be robbed in the coach." There was one of the
proprietors of the coach in it, and he said, "There was no fear." I
asked him if he was one of the owners of the coach. His answer was,
"Yes, Sir, I am." I said I was very glad of it, as it would give me
the less trouble when I got to London. He endeavoured to pacify me;
but when the coachman and guard came back, I demanded of the guard
to see his fire-arms, and I found that they were not loaded, which
gave me more reason to speak with authority. I told the coachman I
would have him fined fifty pounds. I said no more until I came to
the Swan with Two Necks, in Lad-lane; and when I got out of the
coach, the owner came and asked me to walk in. I refused to do so,
but he pressed me so much, that I went in, when he asked me to take
share of a bottle of wine with him, and hoped that I would look
over the mistake that had happened on the road.* So I said I
would.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This passage is so obscure, as to be
incomprehensible. Holt's alarm can only be accounted for by
considering the state of distrust and excitement in which he had so
long lived.]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[March 1814]</p>

<p>I wished to go to Greenwich to see my old friend. Captain
Brookes, who, I heard lived there; but when I got to Greenwich, and
asked after him, I was told that he had purchased a ship, and
loaded her, and that he and his family had gone out to New South
Wales. I inquired for a decent lodging, and was recommended to a
Mr. Woodcock's, at the sign of the White Hart: I found it to be a
very genteel house, and there I remained. I ordered the coachman to
get some drink, and told him to call upon me in the morning, as I
had some particular business for him to do. I had brought with me
fifty-four letters for England, and I sorted them out, for there
were several that I had promised to deliver with my own hand; these
I kept, and the remainder I sent to the post-office. Then I told
Nathaniel Elms, the coachman, that I would give him one guinea if
he would drive me to every street and number I wanted to go to in
London. He agreed to the offer; and, to make our journey the more
handy, he got an open chaise, and we set out to London.</p>

<p>My first object was to go to Charing Cross, to the regimental
agents, to lodge my bills with them, being drawn by the pay-master
of the 73rd regiment upon them. We went there, and lodged my bills,
and got their receipt for the same. Then I went to Whitehall, to
the National Treasury, and lodged some of my bills there; when that
was done, we proceeded to deliver the letters. The coachman drove
me to every place I directed him, and I soon got rid of all my
letters, except one, which I had pledged myself to deliver with my
own hand. The promise respecting this letter I made to Mr. Robert
Jenkins, a merchant in New South Wales, that I should myself give
it either to his mother or his sister. So I ordered the coachman to
drive to Well Street, number eighteen, near Cripplegate, London
City. When I arrived there I got out of the chaise and rapped;
there soon appeared a very fine young woman, whom I supposed to be
the sister of Mr. Jenkins, so I put my hand in my pocket and handed
the letter to her. She said, "Sir, who is this from?" I answered,
"Mr. Robert Jenkins." That moment she swooned away; and the old
lady came out, and, seeing her daughter in a faint, upon hearing
the same words she fainted too, so that the coachman and myself had
got something to do upon our hands to recover them.</p>

<p>When they came to, they told me the cause of their fainting was,
that they had heard that Robert Jenkins was dead two years ago, and
both mother and daughter took hold of me, and insisted upon my
remaining with them. I felt myself obliged to comply with their
wishes; so I paid the coachman, and the old lady gave him his
dinner, and he went away very well satisfied.</p>

<p>Then their inquiries went on one after the other, and I was able
to tell them every particular concerning Mr. Jenkins; and, among
other things, I told them that he was married to the widow of
Captain Forrest, a lady of great fortune. Both the old and the
young lady were so much taken up with the recital of passages in my
life, that they thought nothing could be got good enough for me;
and, indeed, the great attention that they paid me, made me leave
them sooner than I otherwise would have done, as I did not wish to
put them to so much trouble.</p>

<p>I remained with them four days, and then returned to Greenwich,
to Mr. Woodcock's.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[8 March 1814]</p>

<p>On the 8th of March, and on the 9th I walked in the King's Park,
to view the curiosities of that place. I had promised Mrs. and Miss
Jenkins that I would call upon them again, and spend a few days
more with them before I would go to Liverpool. In my absence, Mrs.
Jenkins had written to her other daughter, who was on a visit in
Gloucester, which town is one hundred and twenty-one miles from
London, and when she got the news of her brother, she was curious
to see me; so she and a cousin-german of hers, of the name of
Richard Warren Coley,* a surgeon in the navy, who had spent many
years in India, came up to London. When I returned to Well Street I
was received by the whole party with every expression of esteem and
friendship. Mr. Coley and I went to look after my bills, to see if
they had been accepted; and finding that they were not ready, he
made me go to Abraham Toulmin, Esq., the navy agent, and give him
power to act for me.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Holt writes the name Richard <i>Farmer</i>
Coley.]</p>

<p>As I felt uneasy at being away from my family so long, I came to
the coach-stand, at Snow Hill, and paid my fare, and then I went
back to Mrs. Jenkins and took leave of ray worthy acquaintance.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[16 March 1814]</p>

<p>I arrived in Liverpool on the 16th of March; and my wife and son
were as much rejoiced at seeing me as if I had been seven years
away.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[17 March 1814]</p>

<p>The 17th of March the Irishmen all assembled, and walked in
procession, dressed with the ornaments that are due to the memory
of St. Patrick, a band, playing "Patrick's Day in the Morning,"
going before them. I brought my son with me to show him his
countrymen. I drank at Peter Ryan's, near the Packet-house; and I
got a cold, which so much affected me that I was confined to my
bed.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[18 March 1814]</p>

<p>On the 18th of March, I was so bad that I could not tell what
doctor to send for, whether for the body or the soul.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[1 April 1814]</p>

<p>I got ease on the 1st of April, and having received all my bills
from London, I felt very anxious to return to Ireland. So I went
down to the Packet-house, and agreed for my passage.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[3 April 1814]</p>

<p>We went on board the 3rd, and sailed.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[5 April 1814]</p>

<p>On the 5th day of April, 1814, I landed at the Pigeon House, in
Dublin Bay. I was so very bad that I told my wife if I should die
not to report it until we came to anchor, but thanks be to God, she
has me yet&mdash;and like to continue with her for some time.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Holt survived twelve years after this. At
the end of his manuscript autobiography the following note
occurs:&mdash;"Departed 16th May, 1826, aged 70 years." It is, I
think, in the writing of his son.]</p>

<p>There was a great number of men in the packet, and among them
was Mr. Farrell, chief peace officer in Major Sirr's office; and
when the packet came to anchor, as I was getting my trunks upon
deck, Mr. Farrell came up tome, and told me that I should go with
him to a magistrate. I asked him for what? and he said to show by
what authority I had returned from New South Wales. I told him that
I would see him damned before I would go with him, as I had my
authority for coming home. He replied that it was his duty to see
it. My answer was, "Then you shall wait on me; and if you come with
me to the Custom House, when I open my trunks, I will show you by
what authority I have returned to Ireland." He came with me, and
when I opened my trunks, I showed him my free pardon, saying, "I
hope you are now satisfied." He said "Yes," and went away.</p>

<p>I suppose he reported to Major Sirr what had happened, while I
got my trunks and goods loaded upon two cars; for by the time that
I came up to Kevin-street, there were two servants waiting for me,
as if out of respect. It was enough to vex any one, to see the
greedy appetite they had to make me a prisoner. If Jemmy O'Bryan,
the wilful murderer, had come to life, they could not have followed
him more close than they did me. The two men told Major Sirr had
sent for me. I answered, "He is in a great hurry to see me, I
suppose; so you shall go and get me a coach, for I cannot impair my
health by walking." They said they would get a coach; and if it was
not for the persuasion of my brother, they should have got one, for
I cared as much for Major Sirr as a cow cares for a holiday. My
brother said the distance was very short, and I could lean on his
arm in walking, and so went on.</p>

<p>When I entered the office, I hardly had breath to speak one
word. I saluted the gentlemen, and then addressed the Major,
saying, I was not going to talk standing, and I went over to a
chair and sat down; and then, as well as my breath allowed me, I
asked the Major if it was to see my alacrity that he had sent for
me? "Yes," said he, emphatically.</p>

<p>"Well, Major," said I, "You will, I hope, have no more trouble
on my account," and putting my hand in my pocket, I pulled out my
conditional pardon, which I handed over to him.</p>

<p>The Major read it; and when he came to a certain part of it,
where the words were to "abide by the consequences," he looked at
me, and said that this was not sufficient.</p>

<p>"Major," said I, "when you have done with that, I will show you
another."</p>

<p>He handed me back the paper I had given him, and then I pulled
out my absolute free pardon, and gave it to him. In a moment he
said, "that will do."</p>

<p>"Major," said I, "if I had not that precious bit of paper, I
never would have come to Ireland, for I was well aware of the good
wishes in store for me here."</p>

<p>He told me to go into the next room, until a clerk took down the
heads of my pardon, and entered it in the books. I went out, and
was shown into a little private room, until they had done with my
paper, and then it was brought to me. I had the pleasure of
speaking to Alderman Darley that day, in the office, and he
welcomed me home to my native country.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[14 April 1814]</p>

<p>I returned to Kevin-street, and went to lodge with Mosey Moyes,
where I remained nine days. My health was so bad, that Doctor
Percival wished me to go into the country; so I went to Sandy
Mount, and lodged at Joshua Holt's for fifty-four days.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">[6 June 1814]</p>

<p>I then returned to Kevin-street, at the corner of Redmond's
Hill, on the 6th June, 1814, to live in a house which I took from
Margaret Byers, and bad luck to both&mdash;house and woman.</p>

<p>I consulted with my wife, and told her that the only way to get
to the knowledge of what the people of Ireland had in their minds,
was for me to set up a tavern, and there every one might have free
access to me, to ask me whatever questions they pleased, and that
this would also be the means of preventing people from troubling me
unnecessarily; but I found my plan turn out the reverse of what I
intended, as it only brought me into trouble; for, if I did not sit
down and drink with my customers, most of whom came on purpose to
see me, I gave offence to them, and if I did drink with them, they
were sure to offend me. I mean the lower order of the people. When
they came into my house, they were, perhaps, three parts drunk; and
the first thing they would insist upon, was to shake hands with me,
and then to ask if I remembered so and so, or such a thing, in the
year 1798,. If I did not answer them, then one swore that I did not
like to tell; and another abused me, and said, who cares for a
transported vagabond like him? and so it went on.</p>

<p>After I had taken this house, I was told that the Major
[<i>Sirr</i>] would not grant me a licence to sell spirits. I went
to him, and enquired if this was the case; but he said, that with
the character I had brought home from two governors, I was entitled
to every indulgence that any other subject received, and that he
would certainly grant me the licence. When I came back, I put the
carpenters to work, and made my house fit for business. While I was
getting the place in order, several of the publicans, who were
jealous of me, would say, "Damn that bloody old rebel&mdash;He
surely never will get his licence."</p>

<p>Being satisfied with what the Major had told me, and having his
promise for the licence, I took no notice of anything that was
said, and made no remark until I had my cellar ready. Then I laid
in six hogsheads of porter, and one hundred and sixty gallons of
whiskey, with some rum, brandy, gin, and other cordials, measures
of all sorts, and other necessaries, to begin trade with. I also
engaged three waiters, and putting fifty pounds in my pocket, I
went down to Major Sirr's office, and took out my police licence.
The Major then desired one of the peace officers, to go with me to
the Lord Mayor's office, where there were a few shillings more to
pay; and we came to another office, and paid forty-six pounds and
ten-pence, there, for a small bit of parchment, with which in my
pocket, I came home and tapped two hogsheads of porter, and mounted
on the shelves, in my bar, sixty gallons of spirits.</p>

<p>I had my waiters ready, and opening my doors within one hour
afterwards, no one could get room to sit down in the house. The two
hogsheads of porter were sold in seven hours, and the spirits in
proportion. I was obliged to get two more waiters, and with five
waiters, I went on in this manner for four months, selling from ten
to fourteen hogsheads of porter every week, which inflamed the
hearts of my neighbours, who seeing my success in business,
endeavoured to change the feeling of the people towards me.</p>

<p>A report was circulated, that I kept an Orange Lodge in my
house, which turned the minds of the workmen and mechanics against
me, and I had a neighbour of the name of James Smith, a publican,
who would say to the people passing his door&mdash;"Would you go to
Holt, the swaddler, and pass by an honest man's door?" Some more
would say. "Holt is a friend of Major Sirr's." Another report
circulated, to reduce the esteem and friendship the people had
towards me, was, that I had been a traitor to my countrymen abroad.
This compliment, if a return of truth and gratitude was due to me,
and should have been paid&mdash;why did not some honest man go to
William Goff, or Father Dixon, of the County of Wexford; or to
Father Harold, now in Clontarf; or John Flinn, in Dunlaven; or
Denis McGuire, of Monrath, who now lives in Dublin; or John Byrne,
of the Seven Churches, who lived with me ten years in New South
Wales; or Edward Kilbride, who lived with me seven years abroad.
All these above-written names I refer to, whether I was ever a
traitor to my countrymen. I can call on them for an unblemished
character, during my banishment.</p>

<p>I would not take this trouble to gratify the impartial reader,
only to show how far a malicious mind can prevail on a weak and
feeble set of people, and a bad report gets so much help, that it
travels faster than water can run, or wind can blow. My good, good
reader, I will lay you down a moral of what I have wrote in the
last page. If feeble, and weak minded Irishmen fall out, without
cause, reason, reservation, or thought, one will call the other a
rogue, thief, or stag, or informer, hangman, and such like
respectable names. The standers by, or listeners, never take time
to investigate whether the man so abused is guilty or not, but the
first company they meet, if any conversation takes place, they
report what they have heard said of such a man. One tells ten, and
ten tell thirty, and so it goes on, till all the country has the
same report. I can only compare this to the Quaker, who would not
beat a bad dog, but turned him away, crying out "bad dog," which
the neighbours all taking for "mad dog," and not' taking time to
consider whether the dog was bad or mad, ran out and killed him. So
this is an example of the manner in which people with "bad"
characters, are run down. I think there is as little difference in
the way of what is called crime, between people shouting after me
"a bad character," as shooting at me with a ball. My character
defies the world to this present time, in all parts of the globe
that I have visited.</p>

<p>I found it a moral impossibility for me to command my temper and
passion, living as I did, a publican; and for this reason, one
vagabond set would come in and call me a bloody croppy;&mdash;such
rascals as this, I would kick properly, and if I had shot a fellow
belonging to this set, I had the protection of the laws of my
country. Another gang of ruffians would come in, and call me a
bloody Orange man. I am sure that many of these scoundrels were
bribed for calling me these names, and making those disturbances in
my house, in order to involve me in difficulties.</p>

<p>I was so tormented by various rascals, and drunken blackguards,
that I thought it better to get rid of my house, at once, for I saw
that it was impossible for me to live as a publican in Dublin.</p>

<p>[The events of the remainder of Holt's life, a few of which he
has imperfectly noted, are not remarkable. By his speculation, in
entering into business as a publican, he lost considerably, and he
was soon disgusted at the trade. He then took some land at
Dunleary, now called Kingstown, near Dublin, upon which he built a
few houses, and on the rent arising from these houses he lived, the
remainder of his days, always repenting bitterly of his folly, in
having left New South Wales, where he was prospering, and was
generally respected.<br>
<br>
Holt's manuscript concludes with the following jingle; upon which,
it is only necessary here to remark, that the passage printed in
italics, appears to have been an addition, after Holt's death.]</p>

<p>This world I now have travelled round,<br>
And but little truth or justice found;<br>
For the number of tyrants is so great,<br>
It makes me almost mankind hate.<br>
But the time will come, when cut down like a weed,<br>
The Lord will make their hearts to bleed.<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
Till my history is in print,<br>
I will no more represent.<br>
<i>In Kingstown me and my family live and dwelt.<br>
And all my friends do wish us well</i>.</p>
