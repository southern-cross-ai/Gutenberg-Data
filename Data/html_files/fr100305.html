Yasmini: "Set down my thoughts not yours<br>

if the tale is to be worth the pesa."</h2><br>


<p class="verse">Old Troy reaped rue in the womb of years<br>

For stolen Helen's sake;<br>

Till tenfold retribution rears<br>

Its wreck on embers slaked with tears<br>

That mended no heart-ache.<br>

The wail of the women sold as slaves<br>

Lest Troy breed sons again<br>

Dreed o'er a desert of nameless graves,<br>

The heaps and the hills that are Trojan graves<br>

Deep-runneled by the rain.<br>

<br>

But Troy lives on.<br>

Though Helen's rape<br>

And ten-year hold were vain;<br>

Though jealous gods with men conspire<br>

And Furies blast the Grecian fire;<br>

Yet Troy must rise again.<br>

Troy's daughters were a spoil and sport,<br>

Were limbs for a labor gang,<br>

Who crooned by foreign loom and mill<br>

Of Trojan loves they cherished still,<br>

Till Homer heard, and sang,<br>

<br>

They told, by the fire when feasters roared<br>

And minstrels waited turns,<br>

Of the might of the men that Troy adored,<br>

Of the valor in vain of the Trojan sword,<br>

With the love that slakeless burns,<br>

That caught and blazed in the minstrel mind<br>

Or ever the age of pen.<br>

So maids and a minstrel rebuilt Troy,<br>

Out of the ashes they rebuilt Troy<br>

To live in the hearts of men.<br>

<br>

&mdash;Out of the Ashes</p><br>

<p class="first">THE why and wherefore of my privilege to write a
true account of the Princess Yasmini's early youth is a story in
itself too long to tell here; but it came about through no
peculiar wisdom. I fell in a sort of way in love with her, and
that led to opportunity.</p>

<p>She never made any secret of the scorn with which she regards
those who singe wings at her flame. Rather she boasts of it with
limit-overreaching epithets. Her respect is reserved for those
rare men and women who can meet her in unfair fight and, if not
defeat her, then come close to it. She asks no concessions on
account of sex. Men's passions are but weapons forged for her
necessity; and as for genuine love-affairs, like Cleopatra, she
had but two, and the second ended in disaster to herself. This
tale is of the first one that succeeded, although fraught with
discontent for certain others.</p>

<p>The second affair came close to whelming thrones, and I wrote
of that in another book with an understanding due, as I have
said, to opportunity, and with a measure of respect that pleased
her.</p>

<p>She is habitually prompt and generous with her rewards, if
far-seeing in bestowal of them. So, during the days of her short
political eclipse that followed in a palace that had housed a
hundred kings, I saw her almost daily in a room&mdash;her holy of
holies&mdash;where the gods of ancient India were depicted in
three primal colors working miracles all over the walls and
where, if governments had only known it, she was already again
devising plans to set the world on fire.</p>

<p>There, amid an atmosphere of Indian scents and cigarette
smoke, she talked and I made endless notes, while now and then,
when she was meditative, her maids sang to an accompaniment of
rather melancholy wooden flutes. But whenever I showed a tendency
to muse she grew indignant.</p>

<p>"Of what mud are you building castles now? Set down my
thoughts not yours," she insisted, "if your tale is to be worth
the pesa."</p>

<p>By that she referred to the custom of all Eastern
story-tellers to stop at the exciting moment and take up a
collection of the country's smallest copper coins before
finishing the tale. But the reference was double-edged. A penny
for my thoughts, a penny for the West's interpretation of the
East was what she had in mind.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as it is to the West that the story must appeal
it has seemed wiser to remove it from her lips and so transpose
that, though it loses in lore unfortunately, it does gain
something of directness and simplicity. Her satire, and most of
her metaphor if always set down as she phrased it, would
scandalize as well as puzzle Western ears.</p>

<p>This tale is of her youth, but Yasmini's years have not yet
done more than ripen her. In a land where most women shrivel into
early age she continues, somewhere perhaps a little after thirty,
in the bloom of health and loveliness, younger in looks and
energy than many a Western girl of twenty-five. For she is of the
East and West, very terribly endowed with all the charms of
either and the brains of both.</p>

<p>Her quick wit can detect or invent mercurial Asian subterfuge
as swiftly as appraise the rather glacial drift of Western
thought; and the wisdom of both East and West combines in her to
teach a very nearly total incredulity in human virtue. Western
morals she regards as humbug, neither more nor less.</p>

<p>In virtue itself she believes, as astronomers for example
believe in the precession of the equinox; but that the rank and
file of human beings, and especially learned human beings, have
attained to the very vaguest understanding of it she scornfully
disbelieves. And with a frankness simply Gallic in its freedom
from those thought-conventions with which so many people like to
deceive themselves she deals with human nature on what she
considers are its merits. The result is sometimes very
disconcerting to the pompous and all the rest of the host of
self-deceived, but usually amusing to herself and often
profitable to her friends.</p>

<p>Her ancestry is worth considering, since to that she doubtless
owes a good proportion of her beauty and ability. On her father's
side she is Rajput, tracing her lineage so far back that it
becomes lost at last in fabulous legends of the Moon (who is
masculine, by the way, in Indian mythology). All of the great
families of Rajputana are her kin, and all the chivalry and
derring-do of that royal land of heroines and heroes is part of
her conscious heritage.</p>

<p>Her mother was Russian. On that side, too, she can claim blood
royal, not devoid of at least a trace of Scandinavian, betrayed
by glittering golden hair and eyes that are sometimes the color
of sky seen over Himalayan peaks, sometimes of the deep lake
water in the valleys. But very often her eyes seem so full of
fire and their color is so baffling that a legend has gained
currency to the effect that she can change their hue at will.</p>

<p>How a Russian princess came to marry a Rajput king is easier
to understand if one recalls the sinister designs of Russian
statecraft in the days when India and "warm sea-water" was the
great objective. The oldest, and surely the easiest, means of a
perplexed diplomacy has been to send a woman to undermine the
policy of courts or steal the very consciences of kings. Delilah
is a case in point. And in India, where the veil and the rustling
curtain and religion hide woman's hand without in the least
suppressing her, that was a plan too easy of contrivance to be
overlooked.</p>

<p>In those days there was a prince in Moscow whose public
conduct so embittered his young wife, and so notoriously, that
when he was found one morning murdered in his bed suspicion
rested upon her. She was tried in secret, as the custom was,
found guilty and condemned to death. Then, on the strength of
influence too strong for the czar, the sentence was commuted to
the far more cruel one of life imprisonment in the Siberian
mines. While she awaited the dreaded march across Asia in chains
a certain proposal was made to the Princess Sonia Omanoff, and no
one who knew anything about it wondered that she accepted without
much hesitation.</p>

<p>Less than a month after her arrest she was already in Paris,
squandering paper rubles in the fashionable shops. And at the
Russian Embassy in Paris she made the acquaintance of the very
first of the smaller Indian potentates who made the "grand tour."
Traveling abroad has since become rather fashionable, and is even
encouraged by the British-Indian Government because there is no
longer any plausible means of preventing it; but Maharajah Bubru
Singh was a pioneer, who dared greatly, and had his way even
against the objections of a high commissioner. In addition he had
had to defy the Brahmin priests who, all unwilling, are the
strong supports of alien overrule; for they are armed with the
iron-fanged laws of caste that forbid crossing the sea, among
innumerable other things.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was a hint of moral bravery behind the warrior
eyes that was enough in itself and she really fell in love at
first sight, as men said. But the secret police of Russia were at
her elbow, too, hinting that only one course could save her from
extradition and Siberian mines. At any rate she listened to the
Rajah's wooing; and the knowledge that he had a wife at home
already, a little past her prime perhaps and therefore
handicapped in case of rivalry, but never-the-less a prior wife,
seems to have given her no pause. The fact that the first wife
was childless doubtless influenced Bubru Singh.</p>

<p>They even say she was so far beside herself with love for him
that she would have been satisfied with the Gandharva marriage
ceremony sung by so many Rajput poets, that amounts to little
more than going off alone together. But the Russian diplomatic
scheme included provision for the Maharajah of a wife so
irrevocably wedded that the British would not be able to refuse
her recognition. So they were married in the presence of seven
witnesses in the Russian Embassy, as the records testify.</p>

<p>After that, whatever its suspicions, the British Government
had to admit her into Rajputana. And what politics she might have
played, whether the Russian gray-coat armies might have
encroached into those historic hills on the strength of her
intriguing, or whether she would have seized the first
opportunity to avenge herself by playing Russia false,&mdash;are
matters known only to the gods of unaccomplished things. For
Bubru Singh, her Maharajah, died of an accident very shortly
after the birth of their child Yasmini.</p>

<p>Now law is law, and Sonia Omanoff, then legally the Princess
Sonia Singh, had appealed from the first to Indian law and
custom, so that the British might have felt justified in leaving
her and her infant daughter to its most untender mercies. Then
she would have been utterly under the heel of the succeeding
prince, a nephew of her husband, unenamored of foreigners and
avowedly determined to enforce on his uncle's widow the Indian
custom of seclusion.</p>

<p>But the British took the charitable view, that covering a
multitude of sins. It was not bad policy to convert the erstwhile
Sonia Omanoff from secret enemy to grateful friend, and the feat
was easy.</p>

<p>The new Maharajah, Gungadhura Singh, was prevailed on to
assign an ancient palace for the Russian widow's use; and there,
almost within sight of the royal seraglio from which she had been
ousted, Yasmini had her bringing up, regaled by her mother with
tales of Western outrage and ambition, and well schooled in all
that pertained to her Eastern heritage by the thousand-and-one
intriguers whose delight and livelihood it is to fish the
troubled waters of the courts of minor kings.</p>

<p>All these things Yasmini told me in that scented chamber of
another palace, in which a wrathful government secluded her in
later years for its own peace as it thought, but for her own
recuperation as it happened. She told me many other things
besides that have some little bearing on this story but that, if
all related, would crowd the book too full. The real gist of them
is that she grew to love India with all her heart and India
repaid her for it after its own fashion, which is manyfold and
marvelous.</p>

<p>There is no fairer land on earth than that far northern slice
of Rajputana, nor a people more endowed with legend and the
consciousness of ancestry. They have a saying that every Rajput
is a king's son, and every Rajputni worthy to be married to an
emperor. It was in that atmosphere that Yasmini learned she must
either use her wits or be outwitted, and women begin young to
assert their genius in the East. But she outstripped precocity
and, being Western too, rode rough-shod on convention when it
suited her, reserving her concessions to it solely for occasions
when those matched the hand she held. All her life she has had to
play in a ruthless game, but the trump that she has learned to
lead oftenest is unexpectedness. And now to the story.</p> <hr>
<br>


<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1">CHAPTER I.</a><br>

"Gold is where you find it."</h2>

<p class="verse">There is a land where no resounding street<br>

With babel of electric-garish night<br>

And whir of endless wheels has put to flight<br>

The liberty of leisure. Sandaled feet<br>

And naked soles that feel the friendly dust<br>

Go easily along the never measured miles.<br>

A land at which the patron tourist smiles<br>

Because of gods in whom those people trust<br>

(He boasting One and trusting not at all);<br>

A land where lightning is the lover's boon,<br>

And honey oozing from an amber moon<br>

Illumines footing on forbidden wall;<br>

Where, 'stead of pursy jeweler's display,<br>

Parading peacocks brave the passer-by,<br>

And swans like angels in an azure sky<br>

Wing swift and silent on unchallenged way.<br>

No land of fable! Of the Hills I sing,<br>

Whose royal women tread with conscious grace<br>

The peace-filled gardens of a warrior race,<br>

Each maiden fit for wedlock with a king,<br>

And every Rajput son so royal born<br>

And conscious of his age-long heritage<br>

He looks askance at Burke's becrested page<br>

And wonders at the new-ennobled scorn.<br>

I sing (for this is earth) of hate and guile,<br>

Of tyranny and trick and broken pledge,<br>

Of sudden weapons, and the thrice-keen edge<br>

Of woman's wit, the sting in woman's smile,<br>

But also of the heaven-fathomed glow,<br>

The sweetness and the charm and dear delight<br>

Of loyal woman, humorous and right,<br>

Pure-purposed as the bosom of the snow.<br>

<br>

No tale, then, this of motors, but of men<br>

With camels fleeter than the desert wind,<br>

Who come and go. So leave the West behind,<br>

And, at the magic summons of the pen<br>

Forgetting new contentions if you will,<br>

Take wings, take silent wings of time untied,<br>

And see, with Fellow-friendship for your guide,<br>

A little how the East goes wooing still.<br>

<br>

&mdash;Royal Rajasthan</p><br>


<p class="first">DAWN at the commencement of hot weather in the
hills if not the loveliest of India's wealth of wonders (for
there is the moon by night) is fair preparation for whatever
cares to follow. There is a musical silence cut of which the
first voices of the day have birth; and a half-light holding in
its opalescence all the colors that the day shall use; a
freshness and serenity to hint what might be if the sons of men
were wise enough; and beauty unbelievable. The fortunate sleep on
roofs or on verandas, to be ready for the sweet cool wind that
moves in advance of the rising sun, caused, as some say, by the
wing-beats of departing spirits of the night.</p>

<p>So that in that respect the mangy jackals, the monkeys, and
the chandala (who are the lowest human caste of all and quite
untouchable by the other people the creator made) are most to be
envied; for there is no stuffy screen, and small convention,
between them and enjoyment of the blessed air.</p>

<p>Next in order of defilement to the sweepers,&mdash;or, as some
particularly righteous folk with inside reservations on the road
to Heaven firmly insist, even beneath the sweepers, and possibly
beneath the jackals &mdash;come the English, looking boldly on
whatever their eyes desire and tasting out of curiosity the fruit
of more than one forbidden tree, but obsessed by an amazing if
perverted sense of duty. They rule the land, largely by what they
idolize as "luck," which consists of tolerance for things they do
not understand. Understanding one another rather well, they are
more merciless to their own offenders than is Brahmin to
chandala, for they will hardly let them live. But they are a
people of destiny, and India has prospered under them.</p>

<p>In among the English something after the fashion of grace
notes in the bars of music&mdash;enlivening, if sharp at
times&mdash;come occasional Americans, turning up in unexpected
places for unusual reasons, and remaining &mdash;because it is no
man's business to interfere with them. Unlike the English, who
approach all quarters through official doors and never trespass
without authority, the Americans have an embarrassing way of
choosing their own time and step, taking officialdom, so to
speak, in flank. It is to the credit of the English that they
overlook intrusion that they would punish fiercely if committed
by unauthorized folk from home.</p>

<p>So when the Blaines, husband and wife, came to Sialpore in
Rajputana without as much as one written introduction, nobody
snubbed them. And when, by dint of nothing less than nerve nor
more than ability to recognize their opportunity, they acquired
the lease of the only vacant covetable house nobody was very
jealous, especially when the Blaines proved hospitable.</p>

<p>It was a sweet little nest of a house with a cool stone roof,
set in a rather large garden of its own on the shoulder of the
steep hill that overlooks the city. A political dependent of
Yasmini's father had built it as a haven for his favorite
paramour when jealousy in his seraglio had made peace at home
impossible. Being connected with the Treasury in some way, and
suitably dishonest, he had been able to make a luxurious
pleasaunce of it; and he had taste.</p>

<p>But when Yasmini's father died and his nephew Gungadhura
succeeded him as maharajah he made a clean sweep of the old
pension and employment list in order to enrich new friends, so
the little nest on the hill became deserted. Its owner went into
exile in a neighboring state and died there out of reach of the
incoming politician who naturally wanted to begin business by
exposing the scandalous remissness of his predecessor. The house
was acquired on a falling market by a money-lender, who
eventually leased it to the Blaines on an eighty per cent.
basis&mdash;a price that satisfied them entirely until they
learned later about local proportion.</p>

<p>The front veranda faced due east, raised above the garden by
an eight-foot wall, an ideal place for sleep because of the
unfailing morning breeze. The beds were set there side by side
each evening, and Mrs. Blaine&mdash;a full ten years younger than
her husband&mdash;formed a habit of rising in the dark and
standing in her night-dress, with bare feet on the utmost edge of
the top stone step, to watch for the miracle of morning. She was
fabulously pretty like that, with her hair blowing and her young
figure outlined through the linen; and she was sometimes
unobserved.</p>

<p>The garden wall, a hundred feet beyond, was of rock,
two-and-a-half men high, as they measure the unleapable in that
distrustful land; but the Blaines, hailing from a country where a
neighbor's dog and chickens have the run of twenty lawns, seldom
took the trouble to lock the little, arched, iron-studded door
through which the former owner had come and gone unobserved. The
use of an open door is hardly trespass under the law of any land;
and dawn is an excellent time for the impecunious who take
thought of the lily how it grows in order to outdo Solomon.</p>

<p>When a house changes hands in Rajputana there pass with it, as
well as the rats and cobras and the mongoose, those beggars who
were wont to plague the former owner. That is a custom so based
on ancient logic that the English, who appreciate conservatism,
have not even tried to alter it.</p>

<p>So when a cracked voice broke the early stillness out of
shadow where the garden wall shut off the nearer view, Theresa
Blaine paid small attention to it.</p>

<p>"Memsahib! Protectress of the poor!"</p>

<p>She continued watching the mystery of coming light. The
ancient city's domed and pointed roofs already glistened with
pale gold, and a pearly mist wreathed the crowded quarter of the
merchants. Beyond that the river, not more than fifty yards wide,
flowed like molten sapphire between unseen banks. As the pale
stars died, thin rays of liquid silver touched the surface of a
lake to westward, seen through a rift between purple hills. The
green of irrigation beyond the river to eastward shone like
square-cut emeralds, and southward the desert took to itself all
imaginable hues at once.</p>

<p>"Colorado!" she said then. "And Arizona! And Southern
California! And something added that I can't just place!"</p>

<p>"Sin's added by the scow-load!" growled her husband from the
farther bed. "Come back, Tess, and put some clothes on!"</p>

<p>She turned her head to smile, but did not move away. Hearing
the man's voice, the owners of other voices piped up at once from
the shadow, all together, croaking out of tune:</p>

<p>"Bhig mangi shahebi! Bhig mangi shahebi!"*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Alms! Alms!]</p>

<p>"I can see wild swans," said Theresa. "Come and
look&mdash;five&mdash; six&mdash;seven of them, flying northward,
oh, ever so high up!"</p>

<p>"Put some clothes on, Tess!"</p>

<p>"I'm plenty warm."</p>

<p>"Maybe. But there's some skate looking at you from the garden.
What's the matter with your kimono?"</p>

<p>However the dawn wind was delicious, and the night-gown more
decent than some of the affairs they label frocks. Besides, the
East is used to more or less nakedness and thinks no evil of it,
as women learn quicker than men.</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;in a minute."</p>

<p>"I'll bet there's a speculator charging 'em admission at the
gate," grumbled Dick Blaine, coming to stand beside her in
pajamas. "Sure you're right, Tess; those are swans, and that's a
dawn worth seeing."</p>

<p>He had the deep voice that the East attributes to manliness,
and the muscular mold that never came of armchair criticism. She
looked like a child beside him, though he was agile, athletic,
wiry, not enormous.</p>

<p>"Sahib!" resumed the voices. "Sahib! Protector of the poor!"
They whined out of darkness still, but the shadow was
shortening.</p>

<p>"Better feed 'em, Tess. A man's starved down mighty near the
knuckle if he'll wake up this early to beg."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Those are three regular bums who look on us as
their preserve. They enjoy the morning as much as we do.
Begging's their way of telling people howdy."</p>

<p>"Somebody pays them to come," he grumbled, helping her into a
pale blue kimono.</p>

<p>Tess laughed. "Sure! But it pays us too. They keep other bums
away. I talk to them sometimes."</p>

<p>"In English?"</p>

<p>"I don't think they know any. I'm learning their
language."</p>

<p>It was his turn to laugh. "I knew a man once who learned the
Gypsy bolo on a bet. Before he'd half got it you couldn't shoo
tramps off his door-step with a gun. After a time he grew to like
it&mdash;flattered him, I suppose, but decent folk forgot to ask
him to their corn-roasts. Careful, Tess, or Sialpore'll drop us
from its dinner lists."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it! They're crazy to learn American from
me, and to hear your cowpuncher talk. We're social lions. I think
they like us as much as we like them. Don't make that face, Dick,
one maverick isn't a whole herd, and you can't afford to quarrel
with the commissioner."</p>

<p>He chose to change the subject.</p>

<p>"What are your bums' names?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Funny names. Bimbu, Umra and Pinga. Now you can see them,
look, the shadow's gone. Bimbu is the one with no front teeth,
Umra has only one eye, and Pinga winks automatically. Wait till
you see Pinga smile. It's diagonal instead of horizontal. Must
have hurt his mouth in an accident."</p>

<p>"Probably he and Bimbu fought and found the biting tough.
Speaking of dogs, strikes me we ought to keep a good big fierce
one," be added suggestively.</p>

<p>"No, no, Dick; there's no danger. Besides, there's Chamu."</p>

<p>"The bums could make short work of that parasite."</p>

<p>"I'm safe enough. Tom Tripe usually looks in at least once a
day when you're gone."</p>

<p>"Tom's a good fellow, but once a day&mdash;. A hundred things
might happen. I'd better speak to Tom Tripe about those three
bums&mdash;he'll shift them!"</p>

<p>"Don't, Dick! I tell you they keep others away. Look, here
comes Chamu with the chota hazri."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>chota-hazri</i> (Hindi, "little
breakfast")]</p>

<p>Clad in an enormous turban and clean white linen from head to
foot, a stout Hindu appeared, superintending a tall meek
underling who carried the customary "little breakfast" of the
country&mdash;fruit, biscuits and the inevitable tea that haunts
all British byways. As soon as the underling had spread a cloth
and arranged the cups and plates Chamu nudged him into the
background and stood to receive praise undivided. The salaams
done with and his own dismissal achieved with proper dignity,
Chamu drove the hamal* away in front of him, and cuffed him the
minute they were out of sight. There was a noise of repeated
blows from around the corner.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>hamal</i> (Arabic)&mdash;a porter or
bearer in certain Moslem countries.]</p>

<p>"A big dog might serve better after all," mused Tess. "Chamu
beats the servants, and takes commissions, even from the
beggars."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"They told me."</p>

<p>"Um, Bing and Ping would better keep away. There's no
obligation to camp here."</p>

<p>"Only, if we fired Chamu I suppose the maharajah would be
offended. He made such a great point of sending us a faithful
servant."</p>

<p>"True. Gungadhura Singh is a suspicious rajah. He suspects me
anyway. I screwed better terms out of him than the miller got
from Bob White, and now whenever he sees me off the job he
suspects me of chicanery. If we fired Chamu he'd think I'd found
the gold and was trying to hide it. Say, if I don't find gold in
his blamed hills eventually&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"You'll find it, Dick. You never failed at anything you really
set your heart on. With your experience&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Experience doesn't count for much," he answered, blowing at
his tea to cool it. "It's not like coal or manganese. Gold is
where you find it. There are no rules."</p>

<p>"Finding it's your trade. Go ahead."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of that. What eats me," he said, standing up
and looking down at her, "is what I've heard about their passion
for revenge. Every one has the same story. If you disappoint
them, gee whiz, look out! Poisoning your wife's a sample of what
they'll do. It's crossed my mind a score of times, little girl,
that you ought to go back to the States and wait there till I'm
through&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stood on tiptoe and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Isn't that just like a man!"</p>

<p>"All the same&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go in, Dick, and get dressed, or the sun will be too high
before you get the gang started."</p>

<p>She took his arm and they went into the house together. Twenty
minutes later he rode away on his pony, looking if possible even
more of an athlete than in his pajamas, for there was an added
suggestion of accomplishment in the rolled-up sleeves and scarred
boots laced to the knee. Their leave-taking was a purely American
episode, mixed of comradeship, affection and just plain
foolishness, witnessed by more wondering, patient Indian eyes
than they suspected. Every move that either of them made was
always watched.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Chamu's attention was almost entirely
taken up just then by the crows, iniquitous black humorists that
took advantage of turned backs (for Tess walked beside the pony
to the gate) to rifle the remains of chota hazri, one of them
flying off with a spoon since the rest had all the edibles. Chamu
threw a cushion at the spoon-thief and called him "Balibuk,"
which means eater of the temple offerings, and is an insult
beyond price.</p>

<p>"That's the habit of crows," he explained indignantly to Tess
as she returned, laughing, to the veranda, picking up the cushion
on her way. "They are without shame. Garuda, who is king of all
the birds, should turn them into fish; then they could swim in
water and be caught with hooks. But first Blaine sahib should
shoot them with a shotgun."</p>

<p>Having offered that wise solution of the problem Chamu stood
with fat hands folded on his stomach.</p>

<p>"The crows steal less than some people," Tess answered
pointedly.</p>

<p>He preferred to ignore the remark.</p>

<p>"Or there might be poison added to some food, and the food
left for them to see," he suggested, whereat she astonished him,
American women being even more incomprehensible than their
English cousins.</p>

<p>"If you talk to me about poison I'll send you back to
Gungadhura in disgrace. Take away the breakfast things at
once."</p>

<p>"That is the hamal's business," he retorted pompously. "The
maharajah sahib is knowing me for most excellent butler. He
himself has given me already very high recommendation. Will he
permit opinions of other people to contradict him?"</p>

<p>The words "opinions of women" had trembled on his lips but
intuition saved that day. It flashed across even his obscene
mentality that he might suggest once too often contempt for
Western folk who worked for Eastern potentates. It was true he
regarded the difference between a contract and direct employment
as merely a question of degree, and a quibble in any case, and he
felt pretty sure that the Blaines would not risk the maharajah's
unchancy friendship by dismissing himself; but he suspected there
were limits. He could not imagine why, but he had noticed that
insolence to Blaine himself was fairly safe, Blaine being
super-humanly indifferent as long as Mrs. Blaine was shown
respect, even exceeding the English in the absurd length to which
he carried it. It was a mad world in Chamu's opinion. He went and
fetched the hamal, who slunk through his task with the air of a
condemned felon. Tess smiled at the man for encouragement, but
Chamu's instant jealousy was so obvious that she regretted the
mistake.</p>

<p>"Now call up the beggars and feed them," she ordered.</p>

<p>"Feed them? They will not eat. It is contrary to caste."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. They have no caste. Bring bread and feed them."</p>

<p>"There is no bread of the sort they will eat."</p>

<p>"I know exactly what you mean. If I give them bread there's no
profit for you&mdash;they'll eat it all; but if I give them money
you'll exact a commission from them of one pesa in five. Isn't
that so? Go and bring the bread."</p>

<p>He decided to turn the set-back into at any rate a minor
victory and went in person to the kitchen for chapatis such as
the servants ate. Then, returning to the top of the steps he
intimated that the earth-defilers might draw near and receive
largesse, contriving the impression that it was by his sole favor
the concession was obtained. Two of them came promptly and waited
at the foot of the steps, smirking and changing attitudes to draw
attention to their rags. Chamu tossed the bread to them with
expressions of disgust. If they had cared to pretend they were
holy men he would have been respectful, in degree at least, but
these were professionals so hardened that they dared ignore the
religious apology, which implies throughout the length and
breadth of India the right to beg from place to place. These were
not even true vagabonds, but rogues contented with one victim in
one place as long as benevolence should last.</p>

<p>"Where is the third one?" Tess demanded. "Where is Pinga?"</p>

<p>They professed not to know, but she had seen all three
squatting together close to the little gate five minutes before.
She ordered Chamu to go and find the missing man and he waddled
off, grumbling. At the end of five minutes he returned without
him.</p>

<p>"One comes on horseback," he announced, "who gave the third
beggar money, so that he now waits outside."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Who knows? Perhaps to keep watch."</p>

<p>"To watch for what?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?"</p>

<p>"Who is it on horseback? A caller? Some one coming for
breakfast? You'd better hurry."</p>

<p>The call at breakfast-time is one of the pleasantest
informalities of life in India. It might even be the
commissioner. Tess ran to make one of those swift changes of
costume with which some women have the gift of gracing every
opportunity. Chamu waddled down the steps to await with due
formality, the individual, in no way resembling a British
commissioner, who was leisurely dismounting at the wide gate
fifty yards to the southward of that little one the beggars
used.</p>

<p>He was a Rajput of Rajputs, thin-wristed, thin-ankled, lean,
astonishingly handsome in a high-bred Northern way, and possessed
of that air of utter self-assuredness devoid of arrogance which
people seem able to learn only by being born to it. His fine
features were set off by a turban of rose-pink silk, and the
only fault discoverable as he strode up the path between the
shrubs was that his riding-boots seemed too tight across the
instep. There was not a vestige of hair on his face. He was
certainly less than twenty, perhaps seventeen years old, or even
younger. Ages are hard to guess in that land.</p>

<p>Tess was back on the veranda in time to receive him, with
different shoes and stockings, and another ribbon in her hair;
few men would have noticed the change at all, although agreeably
conscious of the daintiness. The Rajput seemed unable to look
away from her but ignoring Chamu, as he came up the steps,
appraised her inch by inch from the white shoes upward until as
he reached the top their eyes met. Chamu followed him
fussily.</p>

<p>Tess could not remember ever having seen such eyes. They were
baffling by their quality of brilliance, unlike the usual
slumberous Eastern orbs that puzzle chiefly by refusal to express
emotion. The Rajput bowed and said nothing, so Tess offered him a
chair, which Chamu drew up more fussily than ever.</p>

<p>"Have you had breakfast?" she asked, taking the conscious
risk. Strangers of alien race are not invariably good guests,
however good-looking, especially when one's husband is somewhere
out of call. She looked and felt nearly as young as this man, and
had already experienced overtures from more than one young prince
who supposed he was doing her an honor. Used to closely guarded
women's quarters, the East wastes little time on wooing when the
barriers are passed or down. But she felt irresistibly curious,
and after all there was Chamu.</p>

<p>"Thanks, I took breakfast before dawn."</p>

<p>The Rajput accepted the proffered chair without acknowledging
the butler's existence. Tess passed him the big silver cigarette
box.</p>

<p>"Then let me offer you a drink."</p>

<p>He declined both drink and cigarette and there was a minute's
silence during which she began to grow uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"I was riding after breakfast&mdash;up there on the hill where
you see that overhanging rock, when I caught sight of you here on
the veranda. You, too, were watching the dawn&mdash;beautiful! I
love the dawn. So I thought I would come and get to know you.
People who love the same thing, you know, are not exactly
strangers."</p>

<p>Almost, if not quite for the first time Tess grew very
grateful for Chamu, who was still hovering at hand.</p>

<p>"If my husband had known, he would have stayed to receive
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I took good care for that! I continued my ride until
after I knew he had gone for the day."</p>

<p>Things dawn on your understanding in the East one by one, as
the stars come out at night, until in the end there is such a
bewildering number of points of light that people talk about the
"incomprehensible East." Tess saw light suddenly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that those three beggars are your spies?"</p>

<p>The Rajput nodded. Then his bright eyes detected the instant
resolution that Tess formed.</p>

<p>"But you must not be afraid of them. They will be very
useful&mdash; often."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>The visitor made a gesture that drew attention to Chamu.</p>

<p>"Your butler knows English. Do you know Russian?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"French?"</p>

<p>"Very little."</p>

<p>"If we were alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tess decided to face the situation boldly. She came from a
free land, and part of her heritage was to dare meet any man face
to face; but intuition combined with curiosity to give her
confidence.</p>

<p>"Chamu, you may go."</p>

<p>The butler waddled out of sight, but the Rajput waited until
the sound of his retreating footsteps died away somewhere near
the kitchen. Then:</p>

<p>"You feel afraid of me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not at all. Why should I? Why do you wish to see me
alone?"</p>

<p>"I have decided you are to be my friend. Are you not
pleased?"</p>

<p>"But I don't know anything about you. Suppose you tell me who
you are and tell me why you use beggars to spy on my
husband."</p>

<p>"Those who have great plans make powerful enemies, and fight
against odds. I make friends where I can, and instruments even of
my enemies. You are to be my friend."</p>

<p>"You look very young to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly Tess saw light again, and the discovery caused her
pupils to contract a little and then dilate. The Rajput noticed
it, and laughed. Then, leaning forward:</p>

<p>"How did you know I am a woman? Tell me. I must know. I shall
study to act better."</p>

<p>Tess leaned back entirely at her ease at last and looked up at
the sky, rather reveling in relief and in the fun of turning the
tables.</p>

<p>"Please tell me! I must know!"</p>

<p>"Oh, one thing and another. It isn't easy to explain. For one
thing, your insteps."</p>

<p>"I will get other boots. What else? I make no lap. I hold my
hands as a man does. Is my voice too high&mdash;too
excitable?"</p>

<p>"No. There are men with voices like yours. There's a long
golden hair on your shoulder that might, of course, belong to
some one else, but your ears are pierced&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So are many men's."</p>

<p>"And you have blue eyes, and long fair lashes. I've seen
occasional Rajput men with blue eyes, too, but your
teeth&mdash;much too perfect for a man."</p>

<p>"For a young man?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But add one thing to another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is something else. Tell me!"</p>

<p>"You remember when you called attention to the butler before I
dismissed him? No man could do that. You're a woman and you can
dance."</p>

<p>"So it is my shoulders? I will study again before the mirror.
Yes, I can dance. Soon you shall see me. You shall see all the
most wonderful things in Rajputana."</p>

<p>"But tell me about yourself," Tess insisted, offering the
cigarettes again. And this time her guest accepted one.</p>

<p>"My mother was the Russian wife of Bubru Singh, who had no
son. I am the rightful maharani of Sialpore, only those fools of
English put my father's nephew on the throne, saying a woman can
not reign. They are no wiser than apes! They have given Sialpore
to Gungadhura who is a pig and loathes them instead of to a woman
who would only laugh at them, and the brute is raising a litter
of little pigs, so that even if he and his progeny were poisoned
one by one, there would always be a brat left&mdash;he has so
many!"</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"First you must promise silence."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"Woman to woman!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Womb to womb&mdash;heart to heart&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"On my word of honor. But I promise nothing else,
remember!"</p>

<p>"So speaks one whose promises are given truly! We are already
friends. I will tell you all that is in my heart now."</p>

<p>"Tell me your name first."</p>

<p>She was about to answer when interruption came from the
direction of the gate. There was a restless horse there, and a
rider using resonant strong language.</p>

<p>"Tom Tripe!" said Tess. "He's earlier than usual."</p>

<p>The Rajputni smiled. Chamu appeared through the door behind
them with suspicious suddenness and waddled to the gate, watched
by a pair of blue eyes that should have burned holes in his back
and would certainly have robbed him of all comfort had he been
aware of them.</p> <hr> <br>

<p class="first">THE man at the gate dallied to look at his
horse's fetlocks. Tess's strange guest seemed in no hurry either,
but her movements were as swift as knitting-needles. She produced
a fountain pen, and of all unexpected things, a Bank of India
note for one thousand rupees&mdash;a new one, crisp and clean.
Tess did not see the signature she scrawled across its back in
Persian characters, and the pen was returned to an inner pocket
and the note, folded four times, was palmed in the subtle hand
long before Tom Tripe came striding up the path with jingling
spurs.</p>

<p>"Morning, ma'am,&mdash;morning! Don't let me intrude. I'd a
little accident, and took a liberty. My horse cut his
fetlock&mdash;nothing serious&mdash;and I set your two saises* to
work on it with a sponge and water. Twenty minutes&mdash;will see
it right as a trivet. Then I'm off again&mdash;I've a job of
work."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>sais, saice, syce</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a
coachman, a groom.]</p>

<p>He stood with back to the sun and hands on his hips, looking
up at Tess &mdash;a man of fifty&mdash;a soldier of another
generation, in a white uniform something like a British
sergeant-major's of the days before the Mutiny. His mutton-chop
whiskers, dyed dark-brown, were military mid-Victorian, as were
the huge brass spurs that jingled on black riding-boots. A
great-chested, heavy-weight athletic man, a few years past his
prime.</p>

<p>"Come up, Tom. You're always welcome."</p>

<p>"Ah!" His spurs rang on the stone steps, and, since Tess was
standing close to the veranda rail, he turned to face her at the
top. Saluting with martinet precision before removing his helmet,
he did not get a clear view of the Rajputni. "As I've said many
times, ma'am, the one house in the world where Tom Tripe may sit
down with princes and commissioners."</p>

<p>"Have you had breakfast?"</p>

<p>He made a wry face.</p>

<p>"The old story, Tom?"</p>

<p>"The old story, ma'am. A hair of the dog that bit me is all
the breakfast I could swallow."</p>

<p>"I suppose if I don't give you one now you'll have two
later?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "I must. One now would put me just to rights and
I'd eat at noon. Times when I'm savage with myself, and wait, I
have to have two or three before I can stomach lunch."</p>

<p>She offered him a basket chair and beckoned Chamu.</p>

<p>"Brandy and soda for the sahib."</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am!" said the soldier piously.</p>

<p>"Where's your dog, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Behaving himself, I hope, ma'am, out there in the sun by the
gate."</p>

<p>"Call him. He shall have a bone on the veranda. I want him to
feel as friendly here as you do."</p>

<p>Tom whistled shrilly and an ash-hued creature, part Great Dane
and certainly part Rampore,* came up the path like a catapulted
phantom, making hardly any sound. He stopped at the foot of the
steps and gazed inquiringly at his master's face.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Rampore, Rampore hound</i>&mdash;a
breed of large, strong-limbed, big-boned dogs.]</p>

<p>"You may come up."</p>

<p>He was an extraordinary animal, enormous, big-jowled, scarred,
ungainly and apparently aware of it. He paused again on the top
step.</p>

<p>"Show your manners."</p>

<p>The beast walked toward Tess, sniffed at her, wagged his stern
exactly once and retired to the other end of the veranda, where
Chamu, hurrying with brandy gave him the widest possible berth.
Tess looked the other way while Tom Tripe helped himself to a lot
of brandy and a little soda.</p>

<p>"Now get a big bone for the dog," she ordered.</p>

<p>"There is none," the butler answered.</p>

<p>"Bring the leg-of-mutton bone of yesterday."</p>

<p>"That is for soup today."</p>

<p>"Bring it!"</p>

<p>Chamu was standing between Tom Tripe and the Rajputni, with
his back to the latter; so nobody saw the hand that slipped
something into the ample folds of his sash. He departed muttering
by way of the steps and the garden, and the dog growled
acknowledgment of the compliment.</p>

<p>Tess's Rajput guest continued to say nothing; but made no move
to go. Introduction was inevitable, for it was the first rule of
that house that all ranks met there on equal terms, whatever
their relations elsewhere. Tom Tripe had finished wiping his
mustache, and Tess was still wondering just how to manage without
betraying the sex of the other or the fact that she herself did
not yet know her visitor's name, when Chamu returned with the
bone. He threw it to the dog from a safe distance, and was
sniffed at scornfully for his pains.</p>

<p>"Won't he take it?" asked Tess.</p>

<p>"Not from a black man. Bring it here, you!"</p>

<p>The great brute, with a sidewise growl and glare at the butler
that made him sweat with fright, picked up the bone and, at a
sign from his master, laid it at the feet of Tess.</p>

<p>"Show your manners!"</p>

<p>Once more he waved his stern exactly once.</p>

<p>"Give it to him, ma'am."</p>

<p>Tess touched the bone with her foot, and the dog took it away,
scaring Chamu along the veranda in front of him.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ever call him by name, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Bad for him, ma'am. When I say, 'Here, you!' or whistle, he
obeys quick as lightning. But if I say, 'Trotters!' which his
name is, he knows he's got to do his own thinking, and keeps his
distance till he's sure what's wanted. A dog's like an enlisted
man, ma'am; ought to be taught to jump at the word of command and
never think for himself until you call him out of the ranks by
name. Trotters understands me perfectly."</p>

<p>"Speaking of names," said Tess, "I'd like to introduce you to
my guest, Tom, but I'm afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may call me Gunga Singh," said a quiet voice full of
amusement, and Tom Tripe started. He turned about in his chair
and for the first time looked the third member of the party in
the face.</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity! Well, I'm jiggered! Dash my drink and dinner,
it's the princess!"</p>

<p>He rose and saluted cavalierly, jocularly, yet with a
deference one could not doubt, showing tobacco-darkened teeth in
a smile of almost paternal indulgence.</p>

<p>"So the Princess Yasmini is Gunga Singh this morning, eh? And
here's Tom Tripe riding up-hill and down-dale, laming his horse
and sweating through a clean tunic&mdash;with a threat in his ear
and a reward promised that he'll never see a smell of&mdash;while
the princess is smoking cigarettes&mdash; "</p>

<p>"In very good company!"</p>

<p>"In good company, aye; but not out of mischief, I'll be bound!
Naughty, naughty!" he said, wagging a finger at her. "Your
ladyship'll get caught one of these days, and where will Tom
Tripe be then? I've got my job to keep, you know. Friendship's
friendship and respect's respect, but duty's what I'm paid to do.
Here's me, drill-master of the maharajah's troops and a pension
coming to me consequent on good behavior, with orders to set a
guard over you, miss, and prevent your going and coming without
his highness' leave. And here's you giving the guard the slip!
Somebody tipped his highness off, and I wish you'd heard what's
going to happen to me unless I find you!"</p>

<p>"You can't find me, Tom Tripe! I'm not Yasmini today; I'm
Gunga Singh!"</p>

<p>"Tut-tut, Your Ladyship; that won't do! I swore on my Bible
oath to the maharajah that I left you day before yesterday
closely guarded in the palace across the river. He felt easy for
the first time for a week. Now, because they're afraid for their
skins, the guard all swear by Krishna you were never in there,
and that I've been bribed! How did you get out of the grounds,
miss?"</p>

<p>"Climbed the wall."</p>

<p>"I might have remembered you're as active as a cat! Next time
I'll mount a double guard on the wall, so they'll tumble off and
break their necks if they fall asleep. But there are no boats,
for I saw to it, and the bridge is watched. How did you cross the
river?"</p>

<p>"Swam."</p>

<p>"At night?"</p>

<p>The blue eyes smiled assent.</p>

<p>"Missy&mdash;Your Ladyship, you mustn't do that. Little ladies
that act that way might lose the number of their mess. There's
crockadowndillies in that river&mdash;aggilators&mdash;what d'ye
call the damp things?&mdash; mugger.* They snap their jaws on a
leg and pull you under! The sweeter and prettier you are the more
they like you! Besides, missy, princesses aren't supposed to
swim; it's vulgar."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>mugger</i> (Hindi <i>magar</i>,
"crocodile") &mdash;a large crocodile.]</p>

<p>He contrived to look the very incarnation of offended prudery,
and she laughed at him with a voice like a golden bell.</p>

<p>He faced Tess again with a gesture of apology.</p>

<p>"You'll pardon me, ma'am, but duty's duty."</p>

<p>Tess was enjoying the play immensely, shrewdly suspecting Tom
Tripe of more complaisance than he chose to admit to his
prisoner.</p>

<p>"You must treat my house as a sanctuary, Tom. Outside the
garden wall orders I suppose are orders. Inside it I insist all
guests are free and equal."</p>

<p>The Princess Yasmini slapped her boot with a little
riding-switch and laughed delightedly.</p>

<p>"There, Tom Tripe! Now what will you do?"</p>

<p>"I'll have to use persuasion, miss! Tell me how you got into
your own palace unseen and out again with a horse without a soul
knowing?"</p>

<p>"'Come into my net and get caught,' said the hunter; but the
leopard is still at large. 'Teach me your tracks,' begged the
hunter; but the leopard answered, 'Learn them!'"</p>

<p>"Hell's bells!"</p>

<p>Tom Tripe scratched his head and wiped sweat from his collar.
The princess was gazing away into the distance, not apparently
inclined to take the soldier seriously. Tess, wondering what her
guest found interesting on the horizon all of a sudden, herself
picked out the third beggar's shabby outline on the same high
rock from which Yasmini had confessed to watching before
dawn.</p>

<p>"Will your ladyship ride home with me?" asked Tom Tripe.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But why not?"</p>

<p>"Because the commissioner is coming and there is only one road
and he would see me and ask questions. He is stupid enough not to
recognize me, but you are too stupid to tell wise lies, and this
memsahib is so afraid of an imaginary place called hell that I
must stay and do my own&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I left off believing in hell when I was ten years old," Tess
answered.</p>

<p>"I hope to God you're right, ma'am!" put in Tom Tripe piously,
and both women laughed.</p>

<p>"Then I shall trust you and we shall always understand each
other," decided Yasmini. "But why will you not tell lies, if
there is no hell?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm guilty now and then."</p>

<p>"But you are ashamed afterward? Why? Lies are necessary, since
people are such fools!"</p>

<p>Tom Tripe interrupted, wiping the inside of his tunic collar
again with a big bandanna handkerchief.</p>

<p>"How do you know the commissioner is coming, Your Ladyship?
Phew! You'd better hide! I'll have to answer too many questions
as it is. He'd turn you outside in!"</p>

<p>"There is no hurry," said Yasmini. "He will not be here for
five minutes and he is a fool in any case. He is walking his
horse up-hill."</p>

<p>Tess too had seen the beggar on the rock remove his ragged
turban, rewind it, and then leisurely remove himself from sight.
The system of signals was pretty obviously simple. The whole
intriguing East is simple, if one only has simplicity enough to
understand it.</p>

<p>"Can your horse be seen from the road?" Yasmini asked.</p>

<p>"No, miss. The saises are attending to him under the
neem-trees at the rear."</p>

<p>"Then ask the memsahib's permission to pass through the house
and leave by the back way."</p>

<p>Tess, more amused than ever, nodded consent and clapped her
hands for Chamu to come and do the honors.</p>

<p>"I'll wait here," she said, "and welcome the
commissioner."</p>

<p>"But you, Your Ladyship?" Tom Tripe scratched his head in
evident confusion. "I've got to account for you, you know."</p>

<p>"You haven't seen me. You have only seen a man named Gunga
Singh."</p>

<p>"That's all very fine, missy, but the butler&mdash;that man
Chamu &mdash;he knows you well enough. He'll get the story to the
maharajah's ears."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me."</p>

<p>"You dassen't trust him, miss!"</p>

<p>Again came the golden laugh, expressive of the worldly wisdom
of a thousand women, and sheer delight in it.</p>

<p>"I shall stay here, if the memsahib permits."</p>

<p>Tess nodded again. "The commissioner shall sit with me on the
veranda," Tess said. "Chamu will show you into the parlor."</p>

<p>(The Blaines had never made the least attempt to leave behind
their home-grown names for things. Whoever wanted to in Sialpore
might have a drawing-room, but whoever came to that house must
sit in a parlor or do the other thing.)</p>

<p>"Is it possible the burra-sahib will suppose my horse is
yours?" Yasmini asked, and again Tess smiled and nodded. She
would know what to say to any one who asked impertinent
questions.</p>

<p>Yasmini and Tom Tripe followed Chamu into the house just as
the commissioner's horse's nose appeared past the gate-post; and
once behind the curtains in the long hall that divided room from
room, Tom Tripe called a halt to make a final effort at
persuasion.</p>

<p>"Now, missy, Your Ladyship, please!"</p>

<p>But she had no patience to spare for him.</p>

<p>"Quick! Send your dog to guard that door!"</p>

<p>Tom Tripe snapped his fingers and made a motion with his right
hand. The dog took up position full in the middle of the passage
blocking the way to the kitchen and alert for anything at all,
but violence preferred. Chamu, all sly smiles and effusiveness
until that instant, as one who would like to be thought a
confidential co-conspirator, now suddenly realized that his
retreat was cut off. No explanation had been offered, but the
fact was obvious and conscience made the usual coward of him. He
would rather have bearded Tom Tripe than the dog.</p>

<p>Yasmini opened on him in his own language, because there was
just a chance that otherwise Tess might overhear through the open
window and put two and two together.</p>

<p>"Scullion! Dish-breaker! Conveyor of uncleanness! You have a
son?"</p>

<p>"Truly, heaven-born. One son, who grows into a man&mdash;the
treasure of my old heart."</p>

<p>"A gambler!"</p>

<p>"A young man, heaven-born, who feels his manhood&mdash;now and
then gay &mdash;now and then foolish "</p>

<p>"A budmash!" (Bad rascal.)</p>

<p>"Nay, an honest one!"</p>

<p>"Who borrowed from Mukhum Dass the money-lender, making untrue
promises?"</p>

<p>"Nay, the money was to pay a debt."</p>

<p>"A gambling debt, and he lied about it."</p>

<p>"Nay, truly, heaven-born, he but promised Mukhum Dass he would
repay the sum with interest."</p>

<p>"Swearing he would buy with the money, two horses which Mukhum
Dass might seize as forfeit after the appointed time!"</p>

<p>"Otherwise, heaven-born, Mukhum Dass would not have lent the
money!"</p>

<p>"And now Mukhum Dass threatens prison?"</p>

<p>"Truly, heaven-born. The money-lender is without
shame&mdash;without mercy&mdash;without conscience."</p>

<p>"And that is why you&mdash;dog of a spying butler set to
betray the sahib's salt you eat&mdash;man of smiles and welcome
words!&mdash;stole money from me? Was it to pay the debt of thy
gambling brat-born-in-a-stable?"</p>

<p>"I, heaven-born? I steal from thee? I would rather be
beaten!"</p>

<p>"Thou shalt be beaten, and worse, thou and thy son! Feel in
his cummerbund, Tom Tripe! I saw where the money went!"</p>

<p>Promptly into the butler's sash behind went fingers used to
delving into more unmilitary improprieties than any ten civilians
could think of. Tripe produced the thousand-rupee note in less
than half a minute and, whether or not he believed it stolen, saw
through the plan and laughed.</p>

<p>"Is my name on the back of it?" Yasmini asked.</p>

<p>Tom Tripe displayed the signature, and Chamu's clammy face
turned ashen-gray.</p>

<p>"And," said Yasmini, fixing Chamu with angry blue eyes, "the
commissioner sahib is on the veranda! For the reputation of the
English he would cause an example to be made of servants who
steal from guests in the house of foreigners."</p>

<p>Chamu capitulated utterly, and wept.</p>

<p>"What shall I do? What shall I do?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"In the jail," Yasmini said slowly, "you could not spy on my
doings, nor report my sayings."</p>

<p>"Heaven-born, I am dumb! Only take back the money and I am
dumb forever, never seeing or having seen or heard either you or
this sahib here! Take back the money!"</p>

<p>But Yasmini was not so easily balked of her intention.</p>

<p>"Put his thumb-print on it, Tom Tripe, and see that he writes
his name."</p>

<p>The trembling Chamu was led into a room where an ink-pot stood
open on a desk, and watched narrowly while he made a thumb-mark
and scratched a signature. Then:</p>

<p>"Take the money and pay thy puppy's debt with it. Afterward
beat the boy. And see to it," Yasmini advised, "that Mukhum Dass
gives a receipt, lest he claim the debt a second time!"</p>

<p>Speechless between relief, doubt and resentment Chamu hid the
banknote in his sash and tried to feign gratitude&mdash;a quality
omitted from his list of elements when a patient, caste-less
mother brought him yelling into the world.</p>

<p>"Go!"</p>

<p>Tom Tripe made a sign to Trotters, who went and lay down,
obviously bored, and Chamu departed backward, bowing repeatedly
with both hands raised to his forehead.</p>

<p>"And now, Your Ladyship?"</p>

<p>"Take that eater-of-all-that-is-unnamable," (she meant the
dog), "and return to the palace."</p>

<p>"Your Ladyship, it's all my life's worth!"</p>

<p>"Tell the maharajah that you have spoken with a certain Gunga
Singh, who said that the Princess Yasmini is at the house of the
commissioner sahib."</p>

<p>"But it's not true; they'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let the commissioner sahib deny it then! Go!"</p>

<p>"But, missy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do as I say, Tom Tripe, and when I am maharani of Sialpore
you shall have double pay&mdash;and a troupe of dancing
girls&mdash;and a dozen horses &mdash;and the title of
bahadur&mdash;and all the brandy you can drink. The sepoys shall
furthermore have modern uniforms, and you shall drill them until
they fall down dead. I have promised. Go!"</p>

<p>With a wag of his head that admitted impotence in the face of
woman's wiles Tom strode out by the back way, followed at a
properly respectful distance by his
"eater-of-all-that-is-unnamable."</p>

<p>Then the princess walked through the parlor to the deeply
cushioned window-seat, outside which the commissioner sat quite
alone with Mrs. Blaine, trying to pull strings whose existence is
not hinted at in blue books. Yasmini from earliest infancy
possessed an uncanny gift of silence, sometimes even when she
laughed.</p> <hr> <br>

&mdash;No Trespass!</p>br&gt;

<p class="first">HE was a beau ideal commissioner. The native
newspaper said so when he first came, having painfully selected
the phrase from a "Dictionary Of Polite English for Public
Purposes" edited by a College graduate at present in the
Andamans. True, later it had called him an "overbearing and
insane procrastinator"&mdash;"an apostle of absolutism"
&mdash;and, plum of all literary gleanings, since it left so much
to the imagination of the native reader,&mdash;"laudator temporis
acti." But that the was because he had withdrawn his private
subscription prior to suspending the paper sine die under
paragraph so-and-so of the Act for Dealing with Sedition; it
could not be held to cancel the correct first judgment, any more
than the unmeasured early praise had offset later indiscretion.
Beau ideal must stand.</p>

<p>It was not his first call at the Blaines' house, although
somehow or other he never contrived to find Dick Blaine at home.
As a bachelor he had no domestic difficulties to pin him down
when office work was over for the morning, and, being a man of
hardly more than forty, of fine physique, with an astonishing
capacity for swift work, he could usual finish in an hour before
breakfast what would have kept the routine rank and file of
orthodox officials perspiring through the day. That was one
reason why he had been sent to Sialpore&mdash;men in the higher
ranks, with a pension due them after certain years of service,
dislike being hurried.</p>

<p>He was a handsome man&mdash;too handsome, some said&mdash;with
a profile like a medallion of Mark Anthony that lost a little of
its strength and poise when he looked straight at you. A
commissionership was an apparent rise in the world; but Sialpore
has the name of being a departmental cul-de-sac, and they had
laughed in the clubs about "Irish promotion" without exactly
naming judge O'Mally. (Mrs. O'Mally came from a cathedral city,
where distaste for the conventions is forced at high pressure
from early infancy.)</p>

<p>But there are no such things as political blind alleys to a
man who is a judge of indiscretion, provided he has certain other
unusual gifts as well. Sir Roland Samson, K. C. S. I., was not at
all a disappointed man, nor even a discouraged one.</p>

<p>Most people were at a disadvantage coming up the path through
the Blaines' front garden. There was a feeling all the way of
being looked down on from the veranda that took ten minutes to
recover from in the subsequent warmth of Western hospitality. But
Samson had learned long ago that appearance was all in his favor,
and he reinforced it with beautiful buff riding-boots that drew
attention to firm feet and manly bearing. It did him good to be
looked at, and he felt, as a painstaking gentleman should, that
the sight did spectators no harm.</p>

<p>"All alone?" he asked, feeling sure that Mrs. Blaine was
pleased to see him, and shifting the chair beside her as he sat
down in order to see her face better. "Husband in the hills as
usual? I must choose a Sunday next time and find him in."</p>

<p>Tess smiled. She was used to the remark. He always made it,
but always kept away on Sundays.</p>

<p>"There was a party at my house last night, and every one
agreed what an acquisition you and your husband are to Sialpore.
You're so refreshing &mdash;quite different to what we're all
used to."</p>

<p>"We're enjoying the novelty too&mdash;at least, Dick doesn't
have much time for enjoyment, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose he has had vast experience of mining?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he knows his profession, and works hard. He'll find gold
where there is any," said Tess.</p>

<p>"You never told me how he came to choose Sialpore as
prospecting ground."</p>

<p>Tess recognized the prevarication instantly. Almost the first
thing Dick had done after they arrived was to make a full
statement of all the circumstances in the commissioner's office.
However, she was not her husband. There was no harm in
repetition.</p>

<p>"The maharajah's secretary wrote to a mining college in the
States for the name of some one qualified to explore the old
workings in these hills. They gave my husband's name among
others, and he got in correspondence. Finally, being free at the
time, we came out here for the trip, and the maharajah offered
terms on the spot that we accepted. That is all."</p>

<p>Samson laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not all. A contract with the British Government
would be kept. I won't say a written agreement with Gungadhura is
worthless, but&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Oh, he has to pay week by week in advance to cover
expenses."</p>

<p>"Very wise. But how about if you find gold?"</p>

<p>"We get a percentage."</p>

<p>Every word of that, as Tess knew, the commissioner could have
ascertained in a minute from his office files. So she was quite
as much on guard as he &mdash;quite as alert to discover hidden
drifts.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there'll be complications," he went on with an air
of friendly frankness. "Perhaps I'd better wait until I can see
your husband?"</p>

<p>"If you like, of course. But he and I speak the same language.
What you tell me will reach him&mdash;anything you say, just as
you say it."</p>

<p>"I'd better be careful then!" he answered, smiling. "Wise
wives don't always tell their husbands everything."</p>

<p>"I've no secrets from mine."</p>

<p>"Unusual!" he smiled. "I might say obsolete! But you Americans
with your reputation for divorce and originality are very
old-fashioned in some things, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"What did you want me to tell my husband?" countered Tess.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he understands how complicated conditions are
here. For instance, does your contract stipulate where the gold
is to be found?"</p>

<p>"On the maharajah's territory."</p>

<p>"Anywhere within those limits?"</p>

<p>"So I understand."</p>

<p>"Is the kind of gold mentioned?"</p>

<p>"How many kinds are there?"</p>

<p>He gained thirty seconds for reflection by lighting a cigar,
and decided to change his ground.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of geology, I'm afraid. I wonder if your
husband knows about the so-called islands? There are patches of
British territory, administered directly by us, within the
maharajah's boundaries; and little islands of native territory
administered by the maharajah's government within the British
sphere."</p>

<p>"Something like our Indian reservations, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, but the analogy will do. If your husband were to
find gold &mdash;of any kind&mdash;on one of our 'islands' within
the maharajah's territory, his contract with the maharajah would
be useless."</p>

<p>"Are the boundaries of the islands clearly marked?"</p>

<p>"Not very. They're known, of course, and recorded. There's an
old fort on one of them, garrisoned by a handful of British
troops&mdash;a constant source of heart-burn, I believe, to
Gungadhura. He can see the top of the flag-staff from his palace
roof; a predecessor of mine had the pole lengthened, I'm told. On
the other hand, there's a very pretty little palace over on our
side of the river with about a half square mile surrounding it
that pertains to the native State. Your husband could dig there,
of course. There's no knowing that it might not pay&mdash;if he's
looking for more kinds of gold than one."</p>

<p>Tess contrived not to seem aware that she was being
pumped.</p>

<p>"D'you mean that there might be alluvial gold down by the
river?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Now, now, Mrs. Blaine!" he laughed. "You Americans are not so
ingenuous as you like to seem! Do you really expect us to believe
that your husband's purpose isn't in fact to discover the
Sialpore Treasure?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of it."</p>

<p>"I suspect he hasn't told you."</p>

<p>"I'll bet with you, if you like," she answered. "Our contract
against your job that I know every single detail of his terms
with Gungadhura!"</p>

<p>"Well, well,&mdash;of course I believe you, Mrs. Blaine. We're
not overheard are we?"</p>

<p>Not forgetful of the Princess Yasmini hidden somewhere in the
house behind her, but unsuspicious yet of that young woman's gift
for garnering facts, Tess stood up to look through the parlor
window. She could see all of the room except the rear part of the
window-seat, a little more than a foot of which was shut out of
her view by the depth of the wall. A cat, for instance, could
have lain there tucked among the cushions perfectly
invisible.</p>

<p>"None of the servants is in there," she said, and sat down
again, nodding in the direction of a gardener. "There's the
nearest possible eavesdropper."</p>

<p>Samson had made up his mind. This was not an occasion to be
actually indiscreet, but a good chance to pretend to be. He was a
judge of those matters.</p>

<p>"There have been eighteen rajahs of Sialpore in direct
succession father to son," he said, swinging a beautiful
buff-leather boot into view by crossing his knee, and looking at
her narrowly with the air of a man who unfolds confidences. "The
first man began accumulating treasure. Every single rajah since
has added to it. Each man has confided the secret to his
successor and to none else&mdash;father to son, you understand.
When Bubru Singh, the last man, died he had no son. The secret
died with him."</p>

<p>"How does anybody know that there's a secret then?" demanded
Tess.</p>

<p>"Everybody knows it! The money was raised by taxes. Minister
after minister in turn has had to hand over minted gold to the
reigning rajah&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And look the other way, I suppose, while the rajah hid the
stuff!" suggested Tess.</p>

<p>Samson screwed up his face like a man who has taken
medicine.</p>

<p>"There are dozens of ways in a native state of getting rid of
men who know too much."</p>

<p>"Even under British overrule?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "Poison&mdash;snakes&mdash;assassination&mdash;jail
on trumped-up charges, and disease in jail&mdash;apparent
accidents of all sorts. It doesn't pay to know too much."</p>

<p>"Then we're suspected of hunting for this treasure? Is that
the idea?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, since you've denied it. I believe you implicitly.
But I hope your husband doesn't stumble on it."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Or if he does, that he'll see his way clear to notify me
first."</p>

<p>"Would that be honest?"</p>

<p>He changed his mind. That was a point on which Samson prided
himself. He was not hidebound to one plan as some men are, but
could keep two or three possibilities in mind and follow up
whichever suited him. This was a case for indiscretion after
all.</p>

<p>"Seeing we're alone, and that you're a most exceptional woman,
I think I'll let you into a diplomatic secret, Mrs. Blaine. Only
you mustn't repeat it. The present maharajah, Gungadhura, isn't
the saving kind; he's a spender. He'd give his eyes to get hold
of that treasure. And if he had it, we'd need an army to suppress
him. We made a mistake when Bubru Singh died; there were two
nephews with about equal claims, and we picked the wrong
one&mdash;a born intriguer. I'd call him a rascal if he weren't a
reigning prince. It's too late now to unseat him&mdash;unless, of
course, we should happen to catch him in flagrante delicto."</p>

<p>"What does that mean? With the goods? With the treasure?"</p>

<p>"No, no. In the act of doing something grossly ultra
vires&mdash; illegal, that's to say. But you've put your finger
on the point. If the treasure should be found&mdash;as it might
be&mdash;somewhere hidden on that little plot of ground with a
palace on it on our side of the river, our problem would be
fairly easy. There'd be some way of&mdash;ah&mdash; making sure
the fund would be properly administered. But if Gungadhura found
it in the hills, and kept quiet about it as he doubtless would,
he'd have every sedition-monger in India in his pay within a
year, and the consequences might be very serious."</p>

<p>"Who is the other man&mdash;the one the British didn't
choose?" asked Tess.</p>

<p>"A very decent chap named Utirupa&mdash;quite a sportsman. He
was thought too young at the time the selection was made; but he
knew enough to get out of the reach of the new maharajah
immediately. They have a phrase here, you know, 'to hate like
cousins.' They're rather remote cousins, but they hate all the
more for that."</p>

<p>"So you'd rather that the treasure stayed buried?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. But he tossed ash from the end of his cigar to
illustrate offhandedness. "I think I could promise ten per cent.
of it to whoever brought us exact information of its whereabouts
before the maharajah could lay his hands on it."</p>

<p>"I'll tell that to my husband."</p>

<p>"Do."</p>

<p>"Of course, being in a way in partnership with Gungadhura, he
might &mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me give you one word of caution, if I may without
offense. We&mdash; our government&mdash;wouldn't recognize the
right of&mdash;of any one to take that treasure out of the
country. Ten per cent. would be the maximum, and that only in
case of accurate information brought in time to us."</p>

<p>"Aren't findings keepings? Isn't possession nine points of the
law?" laughed Tess.</p>

<p>"In certain cases, yes. But not where government knows of the
existence somewhere of a hoard of public funds&mdash;an enormous
hoard&mdash;it must run into millions."</p>

<p>"Then, if the maharajah should find it would you take it from
him?"</p>

<p>"No. We would put the screws on, and force him to administer
the fund properly if we knew about it. But he'd never tell."</p>

<p>"Then how d'you know he hasn't found the stuff already?"</p>

<p>"Because many of his personal bills aren't paid, and the
political stormy petrels are not yet heading his way. He's
handicapped by not being able to hunt for it openly. Some
ill-chosen confidant might betray the find to us. I doubt if he
trusts more than one or two people at a time."</p>

<p>"It must be hell to be a maharajah!" Tess burst out after a
minute's silence.</p>

<p>"It's sometimes hell to be commissioner, Mrs. Blaine."</p>

<p>"If I were Gungadhura I'd find that money or bust! And when
I'd found it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd endow an orphan asylum, eh?"</p>

<p>"I'd make such trouble for you English that you'd be glad to
leave me in peace for a generation!"</p>

<p>Samson laughed good-naturedly and twisted up the end of his
mustache.</p>

<p>"Pon my soul, you're a surprising woman! So your sympathies
are all with Gungadhura?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I think he's a criminal! He buys women, and
tortures animals in an arena, and keeps a troupe of what he is
pleased to call dancing-girls. I've seen his eyes in the morning,
and I suspect him of most of the vices in the calendar. He's
despicable. But if I were in his shoes I'd find that money and
make it hot for you English!"</p>

<p>"Are you of Irish extraction, Mrs. Blaine?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed I'm not. I'm Connecticut Yankee, and my husband's
from the West. I don't have to be Irish to think for myself, do
I?"</p>

<p>Samson did not know whether or not to take her seriously, but
recognized that his chance had gone that morning for the
flirtation he had had in view &mdash;very mild, of course, for a
beginning; it was his experience that most things ought to start
quite mildly, if you hoped to keep the other man from stampeding
the game. Nevertheless, as a judge of situations, be preferred
not to take his leave at that moment. Give a woman the last word
always, but be sure it is a question, which you leave
unanswered.</p>

<p>"You've a beautiful garden," he said; and for a minute or two
they talked of flowers, of which he knew more than a little; then
of music, of which he understood a very great deal.</p>

<p>"Have you a proper lease on this house?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"I believe so. Why?"</p>

<p>"I've been told there's some question about the title. Some
one's bringing suit against your landlord for possession on some
ground or another."</p>

<p>"What of it? Suppose the other should win&mdash;could he put
us out?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. That might depend on your present landlord's
power to make the lease at the time when he made it."</p>

<p>"But we signed the agreement in good faith. Surely, as long as
we pay the rent&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. Well&mdash;if there's any trouble,
come to me about it and we'll see what can be done."</p>

<p>"But who is this who is bringing suit against the
landlord?"</p>

<p>"I haven't heard his name&mdash;don't even know the details. I
hope you'll come out of it all right. Certainly I'll help in any
way I can. Sometimes a little influence, you know, exerted in the
right way&mdash;well &mdash;Please give my regards to your
husband&mdash;Good morning, Mrs. Blaine."</p>

<p>It was a pet theory of his that few men pay enough attention
to their backs,&mdash;not that he preached it; preaching is
tantamount to spilling beans, supposing that the other fellow
listens; and if he doesn't listen it is waste of breath. But he
bore in mind that people behind him had eyes as well as those in
front. Accordingly he made a very dignified exit down the long
path, tipped Mrs. Blaine's sais all the man had any right to
expect, and rode away feeling that he had made the right
impression. He looked particularly well on horseback.</p>

<p>Theresa Blaine smiled after him, wondering what impression she
herself had made; but she did not have much time to think about
it. From the open window behind her she was seized suddenly,
drawn backward and embraced.</p>

<p>"You are perfect!" Yasmini purred in her ear between kisses.
"You are surely one of the fairies sent to live among mortals for
a sin! I shall love you forever! Now that burra-wallah Samson
sahib will ride into the town, and perhaps also to the law-court,
and to other places, to ask about your landlord, of whom he knows
nothing, having only heard a servant's tale. But Tom Tripe will
have told already that I am at the burra commissioner's house,
and Gungadhura will send there to ask questions. And whoever goes
will have to wait long. And when the commissioner returns at last
he will deny that I have been there, and the messenger will
return to Gungadhura, who will not believe a word of it,
especially as he will know that the commissioner has been riding
about the town on an unknown errand. So, after he has learned
that I am back in my own palace, Gungadhura will try to poison me
again. All of which is as it should be. Come closer and let
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Child!" Tess protested. "Do you realize that you're dressed
up like an extremely handsome man, and are kissing me through a
window in the sight of all Sialpore? How much reputation do you
suppose I shall have left within the hour?</p>

<p>"There is only one kind of reputation worth the having,"
laughed Yasmini; "that of knowing how to win!"</p>

<p>"But what's this about poison?" Tess asked her.</p>

<p>"He always tries to poison me. Now he will try more
carefully."</p>

<p>"You must take care! How will you prevent him?"</p>

<p>By quite unconscious stages Tess found herself growing
concerned about this young truant princess. One minute she was
interested and amused. The next she was conscious of affection.
Now she was positively anxious about her, to use no stronger
word. Nor had she time to wonder why, for Yasmini's methods were
breathless.</p>

<p>"I shall eat very often at your house. And then you shall take
a journey with me. And after that the great pig Gungadhura shall
be very sorry he was born, and still more sorry that be tried to
poison me!"</p>

<p>"Tell me, child, haven't you a mother?"</p>

<p>"She died a year ago. If there is such a place as hell she has
gone there, of course, because nobody is good enough for Heaven.
But I am not Christian and not Hindu, so hell is not my
business."</p>

<p>"What are you, then?"</p>

<p>"I am Yasmini. There is nobody like me. I am all alone,
believing only what I know and laughing at the priests. I know
all the laws of caste, because that is necessary if you are to
understand men. And I have let the priests teach me their
religion because it is by religion that they govern people. And
the priests," she laughed, "are much more foolish than the fools
they entice and frighten. But the priests have power. Gungadhura
is fearfully afraid of them. The high priest of the temple of
Jinendra pretends to him that he can discover where the treasure
is hidden, so Gungadhura makes daily offerings and the priest
grows very fat."</p>

<p>"Who taught you such good English?" Tess asked her; for there
was hardly even a trace of foreign accent, nor the least
hesitation for a word.</p>

<p>"Father Bernard, a Jesuit. My mother sent for him, and he came
every day, year after year. He had a little chapel in Sialpore
where a few of the very low-caste people used to go to pray and
make confessions to him. That should have given him great power;
but the people of this land never confess completely, as he told
me the Europeans do, preferring to tell lies about one another
rather than the truth about themselves. I refused to be baptized
because I was tired of him, and after my mother died and she was
burned with the Hindu ritual, he received orders to go elsewhere.
Now there is another Jesuit, but he only has a little following
among the English, and can not get to see me because I hide
behind the purdah. The purdah is good&mdash;if you know how to
make use of it and not be ruled by it."</p>

<p>They were still in the window, Yasmini kneeling on the
cushions with her face in shadow and Tess with her back to the
light.</p>

<p>"Ah! Hasamurti comes!" said Yasmini suddenly. "She is my
cheti"*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>cheti</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a female
servant or slave; a hand-maiden.]</p>

<p>Tess turned swiftly, but all she saw was one of the three
beggars down by the little gate twisting himself a garland out of
stolen flowers.</p>

<p>"Now there will be a carriage waiting, and I must leave my
horse in your stable."</p>

<p>The beggar held the twisted flowers up to the sun-light to
admire his work.</p>

<p>"I must go at once. I shall go to the temple of Jinendra,
where the priest, who is no man's friend, imagines I am a friend
of his. He will promise me anything if I will tell him what to
say to Gungadhura; and I shall tell him, without believing the
promises. One of these days perhaps he will plot with Gungadhura
to have me poisoned, being in agreement with the commissioner
sahib who said to you just now that it is not good to know too
much! But neither is it good to be too late! Lend me a covering,
my sister &mdash;see, this is the very thing. I shall leave by
the little gate. Send the gardener on an errand. Are the other
servants at the back of the house? Of course yes, they will be
spying to see me leave by the way I came."</p>

<p>Tess sent the gardener running for a basket to put flowers in,
and when she turned her head again Yasmini had stepped out
through the window shrouded from head to heels in a camel-hair
robe such as the Bikanir Desert men wear at night. The lower part
of her face was hooded in it.</p>

<p>Provided you wear a turban you can wear anything else you like
in India without looking incongruous. It is the turban that turns
the trick. Even the spurs on the heels of riding-boots did not
look out of place.</p>

<p>"You'll sweat," laughed Tess. "That camel-hair is hot
stuff."</p>

<p>"Does the panther sweat under his pelt? I am stronger than a
panther. Now swiftly! I must go, but I will come soon. You are my
friend."</p>

<p>She was gone like a shadow without another word, with long
swift strides, not noticing the beggars and not noticed by them
as far as any one could tell. Tess sat down to smoke a cigarette
and think the experience over.</p>

<p>She had not done thinking when Dick Blaine returned
unexpectedly for early lunch and showed her a bag-full of
coarsely powdered quartz.</p>

<p>"There's color there," he said jubilantly. "Rather more than
merely color! It's not time to talk yet, but I think I've found a
vein that may lead somewhere. Then won't Gungadhura gloat?"</p>

<p>She told him at great length about Yasmini's visit, dwelling
on every detail of it, he listening like a man at a play, for
Tess had the gift of clear description.</p>

<p>"Go a journey with her, if you feel like it, Tess," he
advised. "You have a rotten time here alone all day, and I can't
do much to 'liven it. Take sensible precautions but have a good
time anyway you can."</p>

<p>Because Yasmini had monopolized imagination she told him last
of all, at lunch, about the commissioner's call, rehearsing that,
too, detail by detail, word for word.</p>

<p>"Wants me to find the treasure, does he, and call the game on
Gungadhura? What does he take me for? One of his stool-pigeons?
If it's a question of percentage, I'd prefer one from the
maharajah than from him. If I ever stumble on it, Gungadhura
shall know first go off the bat, and I'll see the British
Government in hell before I'll answer questions!"</p>

<p>"They'd never believe Gungadhura hadn't rewarded you," said
Tess.</p>

<p>"What of it?" he demanded. "What do we care what they believe?
And supposing it were true, what then? Just at present I'm in
partnership with Gungadhura."</p> <hr> <br>


<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4">CHAPTER IV.</a><br>

"The law ... is like a python after monkeys in the
tree-tops."</h2>

<p class="verse">Deep broods the calm where the cooing doves are
mating<br>

And shadows quiver noiseless 'neath the courtyard trees,<br>

Cool keeps the gloom where the suppliants are waiting<br>

Begging little favors of Jinendra on their knees.<br>

Peace over all, and the consciousness of nearness,<br>

Charity removing the remoteness of the gods;<br>

Spirit of compassion breathing with new clearness<br>

"There's a limit set to kama; there's a surcease from the

"Blessed were the few, who trim the lights of kindness,<br>

Toiling in the temple for the love of one and all,<br>

If it were not for hypocrisy and gluttony and blindness,"<br>

Smiles the image of Jinendra on the courtyard wall.<br>

<br>

&mdash;Jinendra's Smile</p><br>


<p class="first">YASMINI, hooded like a bandit in the camel-hair
cloak, resumed an air of leisurely dignity in keeping with the
unhurried habit of Sialpore the moment she was through the gate.
It was just as well she did, for Mukhum Dass, the money-lender,
followed by a sweating lean parasite on foot, was riding a smart
mule on his customary morning round to collect interest from
victims and oversee securities.</p>

<p>He was a fat, squat, slimy-looking person in a black alpaca
coat, with a black umbrella for protection from the sun, and an
air of sour dissatisfaction for general business
purposes&mdash;an air that was given the lie direct by a small,
acquisitive nose and bright brown eyes that surely never made bad
bargains. Yasmini's hooded figure brought him to a halt just at
the corner, where the little road below the Blaines' wall joined
the wider road that led down-hill. Business is business, and time
a serious matter only for those who sign promissory notes; he
drew rein without compunction.</p>

<p>"This house is yours?" she asked, and he nodded, his sharp
eyes shining like an animal's, determined to recognize his
questioner.</p>

<p>"There is a miscalculating son of lies who brings a lawsuit to
get the title?"</p>

<p>He nodded again&mdash;a man of few words except when words
exacted interest.</p>

<p>"Dhulap Singh, is it not? He is a secret agent of
Gungadhura."</p>

<p>"How do you know? Why should the maharajah want my
property?"</p>

<p>"He hunts high and low for the Sialpore treasure. Jengal
Singh, who built this house, was in the confidence of
Gungadhura's uncle, and a priest says there will be a clue found
to the treasure beneath the floor of this house."</p>

<p>"A likely tale indeed!"</p>

<p>"Very well, then&mdash;lose thine house!"</p>

<p>Yasmini turned on a disdainful heel and started down-hill.
Mukhum Dass called after her, but she took no notice. He sent the
sweating parasite to bring her back, but she shook him off with
execrations. Mukhum Dass turned his mule and rode down-hill after
her.</p>

<p>"True information has its price," he said. "Tell me your
name."</p>

<p>"That also has its price."</p>

<p>He cackled dryly. "Natives cost money only to their
owners&mdash;on a hundi.*"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>hundi</i>&mdash;(Hindu) a promissory
note, a bill-of-exchange.]</p>

<p>"Nevertheless there is a price."</p>

<p>"In advance? I will give a half-rupee!"</p>

<p>Once more Yasmini resumed her way down-hill. Again Mukhum Dass
rode after her.</p>

<p>"At any rate name the price."</p>

<p>"It is silence firstly; second, a security for silence."</p>

<p>"The first part is easy."</p>

<p>"Nay, difficult. A woman can keep silence, but men chatter
like the apes, in every coffee shop."</p>

<p>His bargain-driver's eyes watched hers intently, unable to
detect the slightest clue that should start him guessing. He was
trying to identify a man, not a woman.</p>

<p>"How shall I give security for silence?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I already hold it."</p>

<p>"How? What? Where?"</p>

<p>The money-lender betrayed a glimpse of sheer pugnacity that
seemed to amuse his tormentor.</p>

<p>"Send thy jackal out of ear-shot, tiger."</p>

<p>He snapped at his parasite angrily, and the man went away to
sit down. Then:</p>

<p>"Where are the title-deeds of the house you say you own?" she
asked him suddenly.</p>

<p>Mukhum Dass kept silence, and tried to smother the raging
anger in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Was it Mukhum Dass or another, who went to the priest in the
temple of Jinendra on a certain afternoon and requested
intercession to the god in order that a title-deed might be
recovered, that fell down the nullah when the snakes frightened a
man's mule and he himself fell into the road? Or was it another
accident that split that car of thine in two pieces?"</p>

<p>"Priests cackle like old women," growled the money-lender.</p>

<p>"Nay, but this one cackled to the god. Perhaps Jinendra felt
compassionate toward a poor shroff* who can not defend his suit
successfully without that title-deed. Jengal Singh died and his
son, who ought to know, claims that the house was really sold to
Dhulap Singh, who dallies with his suit because he suspects, but
does not know, that Mukhum Dass has lost the paper&mdash;
eh?"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>shroff</i> (Hindi from Arabic)&mdash;a
banker or money changer in the Far East.]</p>

<p>"How do you know these things?"</p>

<p>"Maybe the god Jinendra told! Which would be better, Mukhum
Dass&mdash; to keep great silence, and be certain to receive the
paper in time to defend the lawsuit,&mdash;or to talk freely, and
so set others talking?"</p>

<p>Who knows that it might not reach the ears of Jengal Singh
that the title-deed is truly lost?"</p>

<p>"He who tells secrets to a priest," swore the money-lender,
"would better have screamed them from the housetop.</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;the god heard. The priest told the god, and the god
told a certain one to whom the finder brought the paper, asking a
reward. That person holds the paper now as security for
silence!"</p>

<p>"It is against the law to keep my paper!"</p>

<p>"The law catches whom it can, Mukhum Dass, letting all others
go, like a python after monkeys in the tree-tops!"</p>

<p>"From whom am I to get my paper for the lawsuit at the proper
time?"</p>

<p>"From Jinendra's priest perhaps."</p>

<p>"He has it now? The dog's stray offspring! I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, he has it not! Be kind and courteous to Jinendra's
priest, or perhaps the god will send the paper after all to
Dhulap Singh!"</p>

<p>"As to what shall I keep silence?"</p>

<p>"Two matters. Firstly Chamu the butler will presently pay his
son's debt. Give Chamu a receipt with the number of the bank-note
written on it, saying nothing."</p>

<p>"Second?"</p>

<p>"Preserve the bank-note carefully for thirty days and keep
silence."</p>

<p>"I will do that. Now tell me thy name?"</p>

<p>Yasmini laughed. "Do thy victims repay in advance the rupees
not yet lent? Nay, the price is silence! First, pay the price;
then learn my name. Go &mdash;get thy money from Chamu the
butler. Breathe as much as a hint to any one, and thy title-deed
shall go to Dhulap Singh!"</p>

<p>Eying her like a hawk, but with more mixed emotions than that
bird can likely compass, the money-lender sat his mule and
watched her stride round the corner out of sight. Then, glancing
over her shoulder to make sure the man's parasite was not
watching her at his master's orders, she ran along the shoulder
of the hill to where, in the shelter of a clump of trees, a
carriage waited.</p>

<p>It was one of those lumbering, four-wheeled affairs with four
horses, and a platform for two standing attendants behind and
wooden lattice-work over the windows, in which the women-folk of
princes take the air. But there were no attendants&mdash;only a
coachman, and a woman who came running out to meet her; for
Yasmini, like her cousin the maharajah, did not trust too many
people all at once.</p>

<p>"Quick, Hasamurti!"</p>

<p>Fussing and giggling over her (the very name means Laughter),
the maid bustled her into the carriage, and without a word of
instruction the coachman tooled his team down-hill at a leisurely
gait, as if told in advance to take his time about it; the team
was capable of speed.</p>

<p>Inside the carriage, with a lot more chuckling and giggling a
change was taking place almost as complete as that from chrysalis
to butterfly. The toilet of a lady of Yasmini's nice
discrimination takes time in the easiest circumstances; in a
lumbering coach, not built for leg-room, and with a
looking-glass the size of a saucer, it was a mixture of
horse-play and miracle. Between them they upset the perfume
bottle, as was natural, and a shrill scream at one stage of the
journey (that started a rumor all over Sialpore to the effect
that Gungadhura was up to the same old game again) announced, as
a matter of plain fact that Yasmini had sat on the spurs. There
was long, spun-gold hair to be combed out&mdash;penciling to do
to eye-brows&mdash;lac to be applied to pretty feet to make them
exquisitely pretty&mdash;and layer on layer of gossamer silk to
be smothered and hung exactly right. Then over it all had to go
one of those bright-hued silken veils that look so casually worn
but whose proper adjustment is an art.</p>

<p>But when they reached the bottom of the long hill and began
twisting in and out among the narrow streets, it was finished. By
the time they reached the temple of Jinendra, set back in an old
stone courtyard with images of the placid god carved all about in
the shade of the wide projecting cornice, all was quiet and
orderly inside the carriage and there stepped out of it, followed
by the same dark-hooded maid, a swift vision of female loveliness
that flitted like a flash of light into the temple gloom.</p>

<p>It was not so squalid as the usual Hindu temple, although so
ancient that the carving of the pillars in some places was almost
worn away, and the broad stone flags on the floor were hollowed
deep by ages of devotion. The gloom was pierced here and there by
dim light from brass lamps, that showed carvings blackened by
centuries of smoke, but there was an unlooked-for suggestion of
care, and a little cleanliness that the fresh blossoms scattered
here and there accentuated.</p>

<p>There were very few worshipers at that hour&mdash;only a
woman, who desired a child and was praying to Jinendra as a last
recourse after trying all the other gods in vain, and a
half-dozen men&mdash;all eyes&mdash;who gossiped in low tones in
a corner. Yasmini gave them small chance to recognize her.
Quicker than their gaze could follow, a low door at the rear,
close beside the enormous, jeweled image of the god, closed
behind her and the maid, and all that was left of the vision was
the ringing echo of an iron lock dying away in dark corners and
suggesting nothing except secrecy.</p>

<p>The good square room she had entered so abruptly unannounced
was swept and washed. Sunlight poured into it at one end through
a window that opened on an inner courtyard, and there were
flowers everywhere&mdash;arranged in an enormous brass bowl on a
little table&mdash;scattered at random on the floor&mdash;hung in
plaited garlands from the hooks intended to support lamps. Of
furniture there was little, only a long cushioned bench down the
length of the wall beneath the window, and a thing like a throne
on which Jinendra's high priest sat in solitary grandeur.</p>

<p>He did not rise at first to greet her, for Jinendra's priest
was fat; there was no gainsaying it. After about a minute a sort
of earthquake taking place in him began to reach the surface; he
rocked on his center in increasing waves that finally brought him
with a spasm of convulsion to the floor. There he stood in full
sunlight with his bare toes turned inward, holding his stomach
with both hands, while Yasmini settled herself in graceful
youthful curves on the cushioned bench, with her face in shadow,
and the smirking maid at her feet. Then before climbing
ponderously back to his perch on the throne the priest touched
his forehead once with both hands and came close to a semblance
of bowing, the arrogance of sanctity combining with his paunch to
cut that ceremony short.</p>

<p>"Send the girl away," he suggested as soon as he was settled
into place again. But Yasmini laughed at him with that golden
note of hers that suggests illimitable understanding and
unfathomable mirth.</p>

<p>"I know the ways of priests," she answered. "The girl
stays!"</p>

<p>The priest's fat chops darkened a shade.</p>

<p>"There are things she should not know."</p>

<p>"She knows already more in her small head than there is in all
thy big belly, priest of an idol!"</p>

<p>"Beware, woman, lest the gods hear sacrilege!"</p>

<p>"If they are real gods they love me," she answered, "If they
have any sense they will be pleased whenever I laugh at your
idolatry. Hasamurti stays."</p>

<p>"But at the first imaginary insult she will run with
information to wherever it will do most harm. If she can be made
properly afraid, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yasmini's golden laugh cut him off short.</p>

<p>"If she is made afraid now she will hate me later. As long as
she loves me she will keep my secrets, and she will love me
because of the secrets&mdash;being a woman and not a
belly-with-a-big-tongue, who would sell me to the highest bidder,
if he dared. I know a Brahmin. Thou and I are co-conspirators
because my woman's wit is sharper than thy greed. We are
confidants because I know too much of thy misdeeds. We are going
to succeed because I laugh at thy fat fears, and am never
deceived for a moment by pretense of sanctity or promises however
vehement."</p>

<p>She said all that in a low sweet voice, and with a smile that
would have made a much less passionate man lose something of his
self-command. Jinendra's priest began to move uneasily.</p>

<p>"Peace, woman!"</p>

<p>"There is no peace where priests are," she retorted in the
same sweet-humored voice. "I am engaged in war, not
honey-gathering. I have lied sufficient times today to Mukhum
Dass to need ten priests, if I believed in them or were afraid to
lie! The shroff will come to ask about his title-deed. Tell him
you are told  certain person has it, but that if he dares
breathe a word the paper will go straight to Dhulap Singh, who
will destroy it and so safely bring his lawsuit. Then let Dhulap
Singh be told also that the title-deed is in certain hands, so he
will put off the lawsuit week after week, and one who is my
friend will suffer no annoyance."</p>

<p>"Who is this friend?"</p>

<p>"Another one who builds no bridges on thy sanctity."</p>

<p>"Not one of the English? Beware of them, I say; beware of
them!"</p>

<p>"No, not one of the English. Next, let Gungadhura be told that
Tom Tripe has ever an open-handed welcome at Blaine
sahib's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" he objected, shaking his fat face until the cheeks
wobbled. "Women are all fools sooner or later. Why let a drunken
English soldier be included in the long list of people to be
reckoned with?"</p>

<p>"Because Gungadhura will then show much favor to Tom Tripe,
who is my friend, and it amuses me to see my friends prosper.
Also I have a plan."</p>

<p>"Plans&mdash;plans&mdash;plans! And whither does the tangle
lead us?"</p>

<p>"To the treasure, fool!"</p>

<p>"But if you know so surely where the treasure is, woman, why
not tell me and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the single note of mocking golden laughter cut him off
short.</p>

<p>"I would trust thee with the secret, Brahmin, just as far as
the herdsman trusts a tiger with his sheep."</p>

<p>"But I could insure that Gungadhura should divide it into
three parts, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When the time comes," she answered, "the priest of Jinendra
shall come to me for his proportion, not I to the priest. Nor
will there be three portions, but one&mdash;with a little
percentage taken from it for the sake of thy fat belly.
Gungadhura shall get nothing!"</p>

<p>"I wash my hands of it all!" the priest retorted indignantly.
"The half for me, or I wash my hands of it and tell Gungadhura
that you know the secret! I will trust him to find a way to draw
thy cobra from its hole!"</p>

<p>"Maybe he might," she nodded, smiling, "after the English had
finished hanging thee for that matter of the strangling of Rum
Dass. Thy fat belly would look laughable indeed banging by a
stretched neck from a noose. They would need a thick rope. They
might even make the knot slippery with cow-grease for thy special
benefit."</p>

<p>The priest winced.</p>

<p>"None can prove that matter," he said, recovering his
composure with an effort.</p>

<p>"Except I," she retorted, "who have the very letter that was
written to Rum Dass that brought him into thy clutches&mdash;and
five other proofs beside! Two long years I waited to have a hold
on thee, priest, before I came to blossom in the odor of thy
sanctity; now I am willing to take the small chance of thy temper
getting the better of discretion!"</p>

<p>"You are a devil," he said simply, profoundly convinced of the
truth of his remark; and she laughed like a mischievous child,
clapping her hands together.</p>

<p>"So now," she said, "there is little else to discuss. If
Gungadhura should be superstitious fool enough to come to thee
again for auguries and godly counsel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He comes always. He shows proper devotion to Jinendra."</p>

<p>"Repeat the former story that a clue to the treasure must be
found in Blaine sahib's house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In what form? He will ask me again in what form the clue will
be, that he may recognize it?"</p>

<p>"Tell him there is a map. And be sure to tell him that Tom
Tripe is welcome at the house. Have you understood? Then one
other matter: when it is known that I am back in my palace
Gungadhura will set extra spies on me, and will double the guard
at all the doors to keep me from getting out again. He will not
trust Tom Tripe this time, but will give the charge to one of the
Rajput officers. But he will have been told that I was at the
commissioner sahib's house this morning, and therefore he will
not dare to have me strangled, because the commissioner sahib
might make inquiries. I have also made other
precautions&mdash;and a friend. But tell Gungadhura, lest he make
altogether too much trouble for me, that I applied to the
commissioner sahib for assistance to go to Europe, saying I am
weary of India. And add that the commissioner sahib counseled me
not to go, but promised to send English memsahibs to see me."
(She very nearly used the word American, but thought better of it
on the instant.)</p>

<p>"He will ask me how I know this," said the Brahmin, turning it
all over slowly in his mind and trying to make head or tail of
it.</p>

<p>"Tell him I came here like himself for priestly counsel and
made a clean breast of everything to thee! He will suspect thee
of lying to him; but what is one lie more or less?"</p>

<p>With that final shaft she gathered up her skirts, covered her
face, nudged the giggling maid and left him, turning the key in
the lock herself and flitting out through gloom into the sunlight
as fast as she had come. The carriage was still waiting at the
edge of the outer court, and once again the driver started off
without instructions, but tooling his team this time at a faster
pace, with a great deal of whip-cracking and shouts to
pedestrians to clear the way. And this time the carriage had an
escort of indubitable maharajah's men, who closed in on it from
all sides, their numbers increasing, mounted and unmounted, until
by the time Yasmini's own palace gate was reached there was as
good as a state procession, made up for the most part of men who
tried to look as if they had made a capture by sheer derring-do
and skill.</p>

<p>And down the street, helter-skelter on a sweating
thoroughbred, came Maharajah Gungadhura Singh just in time to see
the back of the carriage as it rumbled in through the gateway and
the iron doors clanged behind it. Scowling &mdash;altogether too
round-shouldered for the martial stock he sprang from
&mdash;puffy-eyed, and not so regal as overbearing in appearance,
he sat for a few minutes stroking his scented beard upward and
muttering to himself.</p>

<p>Then some one ventured to tell him where the carriage had been
seen waiting, and with what abundant skill it had been watched
and tracked from Jinendra's temple to that gate. At that he gave
an order about the posting of the guard, and, beckoning only one
mounted attendant to follow him, clattered away down-street,
taking a turn or two to throw the curious off the scent, and then
headed straight for the temple on his own account.</p> <hr> <br>

&mdash;An Audit By The Gods, Part 1</p><br>


<p class="first">THE one thing in India that never happens is the
expected. If the actual thing itself does occur, then the manner
of it sets up so many unforeseen contingencies that only the
subtlest mind, and the sanest and the least hidebound by opinion,
can hope to read the signs fast enough to understand them as they
happen. Naturally, there are always plenty of people who can read
backward after the event; and the few of those who keep the
lesson to themselves, digesting rather than discussing it, are to
be found eventually filling the senior secretaryships, albeit
bitterly criticized by the other men, who unraveled everything
afterward very cleverly and are always unanimous on just one
point&mdash;that the fellow who said nothing certainly knew
nothing, and is therefore of no account and should wield no
influence, Q.E.D.</p>

<p>And as we belong to the majority, in that we are uncovering
the course of these events very cleverly long after they took
place, we must at this point, to be logical, denounce Theresa
Blaine. She was just as much puzzled as anybody. But she said
much less than anybody, wasted no time at all on guesswork,
pondered in her heart persistently whatever she had actually seen
and heard, and in the end was almost the only non-Indian actor on
the stage of Sialpore to reap advantage. If that does not prove
unfitness for one of the leading parts, what does? A star should
scintillate&mdash;should focus all eyes on herself and interrupt
the progress of the play to let us know how wise and beautiful
and wonderful she is. But Tess apparently agreed with Hamlet that
"the play's the thing," and was much too interested in the plot
to interfere with it. She attended the usual round of dinners,
teas and tennis parties, that are part of the system by which the
English keep alive their courage, and growing after a while a
little tired of triviality, she tried to scandalize Sialpore by
inviting Tom Tripe to her own garden party, successfully
overruling Tripe's objections.</p>

<p>"Between you and I and the gate-post, lady, they don't hanker
for my society. If somebody&mdash;especially colonels, or a judge
maybe,&mdash; wanted to borrow a horse from the maharajah's
stable,&mdash;or perhaps they'd like a file o' men to escort a
picnic in the hills,&mdash;then it's 'Oh, hello, good morning,
Mr. Tripe. How's the dog this morning? And oh, by the way&mdash;'
Then I know what's coming an' what I can do for 'em I do, for I
confess, lady, that I hanker for a little bit o' flattery and a
few words o' praise I'm not entitled to. I don't covet any man's
money&mdash;or at least not enough to damn me into hell on that
account. Finding's keeping, and a bet's a bet, but I don't covet
money more than that dog o' mine covets fleas. He likes to
scratch 'em when he has 'em. Me the same; I can use money with
the next man, his or mine. But I wouldn't go to hell for money
any more than Trotters would for fleas, although, mind you, I'm
not saying Trotters hasn't got fleas. He has 'em, same as hell's
most folks' destiny. But when it comes to praise that ain't due
me, lady, I'm like Trotters with another dog's bone&mdash;I've
simply got to have it, reason or no reason. A common ordinary
bone with meat on it is just a meal. Praise I've earned is
nothing wonderful. But praise I don't deserve is stolen fruit,
and that's the sweetest. Now, if I was to come to your party I'd
get no praise, ma'am. I'd be doing right by you, but they'd say I
didn't know my place, and by and by they'd prove it to me sharp
and sneery. I'll be a coward to stop away, but &mdash;'Sensible
man,' they'll say. 'Knows when he isn't wanted.' You see, ma'am,
yours is the only house in Sialpore where I can walk in and know
I'm welcome whether you're at home or not."</p>

<p>"All the more reason for coming to the party, Tom."</p>

<p>"Ah-h-h! If only you understood!"</p>

<p>He wagged his head and one finger at her in his half-amused
paternal manner that would often win for him when all else
failed. But this time it did not work.</p>

<p>"I don't care for half-friends, Tom. If you expect to be
welcome at my house you must come to my parties when I ask
you."</p>

<p>"Lady, lady!"</p>

<p>"I mean it."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. I'll come. I've protested. That absolves me.
And my hide's thick. It takes more than just a snub or
two&mdash;or three to knock my number down! Am I to bring
Trotters?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Trotters is my friend too. I count on him to do
his tricks and help entertain."</p>

<p>"They'll say of you, ma'am, afterward that you don't know
better than ask Tripe and his vulgar dog to meet nice
people."</p>

<p>"They'll be right, Tom. I don't know better. I hope they'll
say it to me, that's all."</p>

<p>But Tess discovered when the day came that no American can
scandalize the English. They simply don't expect an American to
know bow to behave, and Tom Tripe and his marvelous performing
dog were accepted and approved of as sincerely as the real
American ice-cream soda&mdash;and forgotten as swiftly the
morning following.</p>

<p>The commissioner was actually glad to meet Tripe in the
circumstances. If the man should suppose that because Sir Roland
Samson and a judge of appeal engaged in a three-cornered
conversation with him at a garden party, therefore either of them
would speak to the maharajah's drill-master when next they should
meet in public, he might guess again, that was all.</p>

<p>One of the things the commissioner asked Tripe was whether he
was responsible for the mounting of palace guards&mdash;of course
not improperly inquisitive about the maharajah's personal affairs
but anxious to seem interested in the fellow's daily round, since
just then one couldn't avoid him.</p>

<p>"In a manner, and after a fashion, yes, sir. I'm responsible
that routine goes on regularly and that the men on duty know
their business."</p>

<p>"Ah. Nothing like responsibility. Good for a man. Some try to
avoid it, but it's good. So you look after the guard on all the
palaces? The Princess Yasmini's too, eh? Well, well; I can
imagine that might be nervous work. They say that young lady
is&mdash;! Eh, Tripe?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't say, sir. My duties don't take me inside the
palace."</p>

<p>"Now, now, Tripe! No use trying to look innocent! They tell me
she's a handful and you encourage her!"</p>

<p>"Some folks don't care what they say, sir."</p>

<p>"If she should be in trouble I dare say, now, you'd be the man
she'd apply to for help."</p>

<p>"I'd like to think that, sir."</p>

<p>"Might ask you to take a letter for instance, to me or his
honor the judge here?"</p>

<p>The judge walked away. He did not care to be mixed up in
intrigue, even hypothetically, and especially with a member of
the lower orders.</p>

<p>"I'd do for her what I'd do for a daughter of my own, sir,
neither more nor less."</p>

<p>"Quite so, Tripe. If she gave you a letter to bring to me,
you'd bring it, eh?"</p>

<p>"Excepting barratry, the ten commandments, earthquake and the
act of God, sir, yes."</p>

<p>"Without the maharajah knowing?"</p>

<p>"Without his highness knowing."</p>

<p>"You'd do that with a clear conscience, eh?"</p>

<p>Tom Tripe screwed his face up, puffed his cheeks, and struck a
very military attitude.</p>

<p>"A soldier's got no business with a conscience, sir.
Conscience makes a man squeamish o' doing right for fear his
wife's second cousin might tell the neighbors."</p>

<p>"Ha-ha! Very profoundly philosophic! I dare wager you've
carried her letters at least a dozen times&mdash;now come."</p>

<p>Again Tom Tripe puffed out his cheeks and struck an
attitude.</p>

<p>"Men don't get hanged for murder, sir."</p>

<p>"For what, then?"</p>

<p>"Talking before and afterward!"</p>

<p>"Excellent! If only every one remembered that! Did it ever
occur to you how the problem might be reversed ?"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"There might one day be a letter for the Princess Yasmini
that, as her friend, you ought to make sure should reach
her."</p>

<p>"I'd take a letter from you to her, sir, if that's your
meaning."</p>

<p>Sir Roland Samson, K.C.S.I., looked properly shocked.</p>

<p>There are few things so appalling as the abruptness with which
members of the lower orders divest diplomacy's kernel of its
decorative outer shell. "What I meant is&mdash;ah&mdash;" He set
his monocle, and stared as if Tripe were an insect on a
pin-point. "Since you admit you're in the business of intriguing
for the princess, no doubt you carry letters to, as well as from
her, and hold your tongue about that too?"</p>

<p>"If I should deliver letters they'd be secret or they'd have
gone through the mail. I'd risk my job each time I did it. Would
I risk it worse by talking? Once the maharajah heard a
whisper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I'll be careful not to drop a hint to his
highness. As you say, it might imperil your job. And, ah&mdash;"
(again the monocle,) " &mdash;the initials r.s.&mdash;in small
letters, not capitals, in the bottom left-hand corner of a small
white envelope would&mdash;ah&mdash; you understand?&mdash;you'd
see that she received it, eh?"</p>

<p>Tom Tripe bridled visibly. Neither the implied threat nor the
proposal to make use of him without acknowledging the service
afterward, escaped him. Samson, who believed among other things
in keeping all inferiors thoroughly in their place decided on the
instant to rub home the lesson while it smarted.</p>

<p>"You'd find it profitable. You'd be paid whatever the
situation called for. You needn't doubt that."</p>

<p>Tess, talking with a group of guests some little distance off,
observed a look of battle in Tom Tripe's eye, and smiled two
seconds later as the commissioner let fall his monocle. Two
things she was certain of at once: Tom Tripe would tell her at
the first opportunity exactly what had happened, and Samson would
lie about it glibly if provoked. She promised herself she would
provoke him. As a matter of fact Tom gave her two or three
versions afterward of what his words had been, their grandeur
increasing as imagination flourished in the comfortable warmth of
confidence. But the first account came from a fresh memory:</p>

<p>"No money you'll ever touch would buy my dog's silence, let
alone mine, sir! If you've a letter for the princess, send it
along and I'll see she gets it. If she cares to answer it, I'll
see the answer reaches you. As for dropping hints to the
maharajah about my doing little services for the
princess,&mdash;a gentleman's a gentleman, and don't need
instruction &mdash;nor advice from me. If I was out of a job
tomorrow I'd still be a man on two feet, to be met as such."</p>

<p>A man of indiscretion, and a diplomat, must have fireproof
feelings. As Tess had observed, Samson blenched distinctly, but
he recovered in a second and put in practise some of that
opportunism that was his secret pride, reflecting how a less
finished diplomatist would have betrayed resentment at the snub
from an inferior instead of affecting not to notice it at all. As
a student of human nature he decided that Tom Tripe's pride was
the point to take advantage of.</p>

<p>"You're the very man I can trust," he said. "I'm glad we have
had this talk. If ever you receive a small white envelope marked
r. s. in the left-hand bottom corner, see that the princess gets
it, and say nothing."</p>

<p>"Trust me, eh?" Tripe muttered as Samson walked away. "You
never trusted your own mother without you had a secret hold over
her. I wouldn't trust you that far!" He spat among the flowers,
for Tom could not pretend to real garden-party manners. "And if
she trusts you, letters or no letters, I'll eat my spurs and
saber cold for breakfast."</p>

<p>Then, as if to console himself with proof that some one in the
world did trust him thoroughly, Tom swaggered with a
riding-master stride to where Tess stood talking with a Rajput
prince, who had come late and threatened to leave early. The
prince had puzzled her by referring two or three times to his
hurry, once even going so far as to say good-by, and then not
going. It was as if he expected her to know something that she
did not know, and to give him a cue that he waited for in vain.
She felt he must think her stupid, and the thought made her every
minute less at ease; but Tom's approach, eyed narrowly by Samson
for some reason, seemed to raise the Rajput's spirits.</p>

<p>"If only my husband were here," she said aloud, "but at the
last minute &mdash;there was blasting, you know, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The prince&mdash;he was quite a young one&mdash;twenty-one
perhaps &mdash;murmured something polite and with eyes that
smoldered watched Tom take a letter from his tunic pocket. He
handed it to Tess with quite a flourish.</p>

<p>"Some one must have dropped this, ma'am."</p>

<p>The envelope was scented, and addressed in Persian characters.
She saw the prince's eyes devour the thing&mdash;saw him exchange
glances with Tom Tripe&mdash;and realized that Tom had rather
deftly introduced her to another actor in the unseen drama that
was going on. Clearly the next move was hers.</p>

<p>"Is it yours, perhaps?" she asked.</p>

<p>Prince Utirupa Singh bowed and took the letter. Samson with a
look of baffled fury behind the monocle, but a smile for
appearance's sake, joined them at that minute and Utirupa seemed
to take delight in so manipulating the sealed envelope that the
commissioner could only see the back of it.</p>

<p>The prince was an extremely handsome young man, as striking in
one way as Samson in another. Polo and pig-sticking had kept him
lean, and association with British officers had given him an air
of being frankly at his ease even when really very far from
feeling it. He had the natural Oriental gift of smothering
excitement, added to a trick learned from the West of aggressive
self-restraint that is not satisfied with seeming the opposite of
what one is, but insists on extracting humor from the situation
and on calling attention to the humor.</p>

<p>"I shall always be grateful to you," he said, smiling into
Tess's eyes with his own wonderful brown ones but talking at the
commissioner. "If I had lost this letter I should have been at a
loss indeed. If some one else had found it, that might have been
disastrous."</p>

<p>"But I did not find it for you," Tess objected.</p>

<p>Utirupa turned his back to the commissioner and answered in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, when I lose letters I shall come here
first!"</p>

<p>He bowed to take his leave and showed the back of the envelope
again to Samson, with a quiet malice worthy of Torquemada. The
commissioner looked almost capable of snatching it.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Blaine," he said with a laugh after the prince had gone,
"skill and experience, I am afraid, are not much good without
luck. Luck seems to be a thing I lack. Now, if I had picked up
that letter I've a notion that the information in it would have
saved me a year's work."</p>

<p>Tess was quite sure that Tom had not picked the letter up, but
there was no need to betray her knowledge.</p>

<p>"Do you mean you'd have opened a letter you picked up in my
garden?" she demanded.</p>

<p>His eyes accepted her challenge.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"But why? Surely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Necessity, dear lady, knows no law. That's one of the first
axioms of diplomacy. Consider your husband as a case in point.
Custom, which is the basis of nearly all law, says he ought to be
here entertaining your guests. Necessity, ignoring custom,
obliges him to stay in the hills and supervise the blasting,
disappointing every one but me. I'm going to take advantage of
his necessity."</p>

<p>If he had seen the swift glance she gave him he might have
changed the course of one small part of history. Tess knew
nothing of the intrigue he was engaged in, and did not propose to
be keeper of his secrets; if he had glimpsed that swift betrayal
of her feelings he would certainly not have volunteered further
confidences. But the poison of ambition blinds all those who
drink it, so that the "safest" men unburden themselves to the
wrong unwilling ears.</p>

<p>"Walk with me up and down the path where every one can see us,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"Why?" she laughed. "Do you flatter yourself I'd be afraid to
be caught alone with you?"</p>

<p>"I hope you'd like to be alone with me! I would like nothing
better. But if we walk up and down together on the path in full
view, we arouse no suspicion and we can't be overheard. I propose
to tell some secrets."</p>

<p>Not many women would resist the temptation of inside political
information. Recognizing that by some means beyond her
comprehension she was being drawn into a maze of secrets all
interrelated and any of them likely to involve herself at any
minute, Tess had no compunction whatever.</p>

<p>"I'll be frank with you," she said. "I'm curious."</p>

<p>Once they walked up the path and down again, talking of dogs,
because it happened that Tom Tripe's enormous beast was sprawling
in the shadow of a rose-bush at the farther end. The
commissioner did not like dogs. "Something loathsome about
them&mdash;degrading&mdash;especially the big ones." She
disagreed. She liked them, cold wet noses and all, even in the
dark. Tom Tripe, stepping behind a bush with the obvious purpose
of smoking in secret the clay pipe that be hardly troubled to
conceal, whistled the dog, who leapt into life as if stung and
joined his master.</p>

<p>The second time up and down they talked of professional
beggars and what a problem they are to India, because they both
happened as they turned to catch sight of Umra with the one eye,
entering through the little gate in the wall and shuffling
without modesty or a moment's hesitation to his favorite seat
among the shrubs, whence to view proceedings undisturbed.</p>

<p>"Those three beggars that haunt this house seem to claim all
our privileges," she said. "They wouldn't think of letting us
give a garden party without them."</p>

<p>"Say the word," he said, "and I'll have them put in
prison."</p>

<p>But she did not say the word.</p>

<p>The third time up the path he chose to waste on very obvious
flattery.</p>

<p>"You're such an unusual woman, you know, Mrs. Blaine. You
understand whatever's said to you, and don't ask idiotic
questions. And then, of course, you're American, and I feel I can
say things to you that my own countrywoman wouldn't understand.
As an American, in other words, you're privileged."</p>

<p>As they turned at the top of the path she felt a cold wet
something thrust into her hand from behind. She had never in her
life refused a caress to a dog that asked for one, and her
fingers closed almost unconsciously on Trotters' muzzle, touching
as they did so the square unmistakable hard edges of an envelope.
There was no mistaking the intent; the dog forced it on her and,
the instant her fingers closed on it, slunk out of sight.</p>

<p>"Wasn't that Tripe's infernal dog again?"</p>

<p>"Was it? I didn't see." She was wiping slobber on to her skirt
from an envelope whose strong perfume had excited the dog's
salivary glands. But it was true that she did not see.</p>

<p>"May I call you Theresa?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It would encourage confidences. There isn't another woman in
Sialpore whom I could tell what I'm going to say to you. The
others would repeat it to their husbands, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell mine everything. Every word!"</p>

<p>"Or they'd try to work me on the strength of it for little
favors&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Wait until you know me! Little favors don't appeal to me. I
like them big &mdash;very big!"</p>

<p>"Honestly, Theresa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Better call me Mrs. Blaine."</p>

<p>"Honestly, there's nothing under heaven that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you really know about me. I know there isn't. You were
going to tell secrets. I'm listening."</p>

<p>"You're a hard-hearted woman!"</p>

<p>She had contrived by that time to extract a letter from the
envelope behind her back, but how to read it without informing
Samson was another matter. As she turned up the path for the
sixth time, the sight of Tom Tripe making semi-surreptitious
signals to attract her attention convinced her that the message
was urgent and that she should not wait to read it until after
her last guests were gone. It was only one sheet of paper,
written probably on only one side&mdash;she hoped in English. But
how -</p>

<p>Suddenly she screamed, and Samson was all instant concern.</p>

<p>"Was that a snake? Tell me, was that a snake I saw. Oh, do
look, please! I loathe them."</p>

<p>"Probably a lizard."</p>

<p>"No, no, I know a lizard. Do please look!"</p>

<p>Unbelieving, he took a stick and poked about among the,
flowers to oblige her; so she read the message at her leisure
behind the broad of his back, and had folded it out of sight
before he looked up.</p>

<p>"No snakes. Nothing but a lizard."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad! Please forgive me, but I dread snakes. Now
tell me the secrets while I listen properly."</p>

<p>He noticed a change in her voice&mdash;symptoms of new
interest, and passed it to the credit of himself.</p>

<p>"There's an intrigue going on, and you can help me.
Sp&mdash;people whose business it is to keep me informed have
reported that Tom Tripe is constantly carrying letters from the
Princess Yasmini of Sialpore to that young Prince Utirupa who was
here this afternoon. Now, it's no secret that if Gungadhura Singh
were to get found out committing treason (and I'm pretty sure
he's guilty of it five days out of six!) we'd depose
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean the British would depose him?"</p>

<p>"Depose him root and branch. Then Utirupa would be next in
line. He's a decent fellow. He'd be sure of the nomination, and
he'd make a good ruler."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I want to know what the Princess Yasmini has to do with
it."</p>

<p>"It seems to me you're not telling secrets, but asking favors
for nothing."</p>

<p>"Not for nothing&mdash;not for nothing! There's positively
nothing that I won't do!"</p>

<p>"In return for&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Sure information as to what is going on."</p>

<p>"Which you think I can get for you?"</p>

<p>"I'm positive! You're such an extraordinary, woman. I'm pretty
sure it all hinges on the treasure I told you about the other
day. Whoever gets first hold of that holds all the trumps. I'd
like to get it myself. That would be the making of me,
politically speaking. If Gungadhura should get it he'd ruin
himself with intrigue in less than a year, but he might cause my
ruin in the process. If the local priests should get it&mdash;and
that's likeliest, all things considered&mdash;there'd be red ruin
for miles around; money and the church don't mix without
blood-letting, and you can't unscramble that omelet forever
afterward. I confess I don't know how to checkmate the priests.
Gungadhura I think I can manage, especially with your aid. But I
must have information."</p>

<p>"Is there any one else who'd be dangerous if he possessed the
secret?"</p>

<p>"Anybody would be, except myself. Anybody else would begin
playing for political control with it, and there'd be no more
peace on this side of India for years. And now, this is what I
want to say: The most dangerous individual who could possibly get
that treasure would be the Princess Yasmini. The difficulty of
dealing with her is that she's not above hiding behind purdah
(the veil), where no male man can reach her. There are several
women here whom I might interest in keeping an eye on
her&mdash;Tatum's wife, and Miss Bent, and Miss O'Hara, and the
Goole sisters&mdash;lots of 'em. But they'd all talk. And they'd
all try to get influence for their male connections on the
strength of being in the know. But somehow, Theresa, you're
different."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Blaine, please."</p>

<p>"I know Tom Tripe thinks the world of you. I want you to find
out for me from him everything he knows about this treasure
intrigue and whatever's behind it."</p>

<p>"You think he'd tell me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I want you to make the acquaintance of the Princess
Yasmini, and find out from her if you can what the letters are
that she writes to Utirupa. You'll find the acquaintance
interesting."</p>

<p>Tess crumpled a folded letter in her left hand.</p>

<p>"If you could give me an introduction to the
princess&mdash;they say she's difficult to see&mdash;some sort of
letter that would get me past the maharajah's guards," she
answered.</p>

<p>"I can. I will. The girl's a minor. I've the right to appoint
some one to visit her and make all proper inquiries. I appoint
you."</p>

<p>"Give me a letter now and I'll go tonight."</p>

<p>He stopped as they turned at the end of the path, and wrote on
a leaf of his pocket-book. Behind his back Tess waved her secret
letter to attract Tom Tripe's notice, and nodded.</p>

<p>"There." said Samson. "That's preliminary. I'll confirm it
later by letter on official paper. But nobody will dare question
that. If any one does, let me know immediately."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"And now, Theresa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You forget."</p>

<p>"I forget nothing. I never forget! You'll be wondering what
you are to get out of all this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wonder if you're capable of believing that nothing was
further from my thoughts!"</p>

<p>"Don't think I want all for nothing! Don't imagine my
happiness&mdash;my success could be complete without&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Without a whisky and soda. Come and have one. I see my
husband coming at last."</p>

<p>"Damn!" muttered Samson under his breath.</p>

<p>She had expected her husband by the big gate, but he came
through the little one, and she caught sight of him at once
because through the corner of her eye she was watching some one
else&mdash;Umra the beggar. Umra departed through the little gate
thirty seconds before her husband entered it.</p>

<p>Blaine was so jubilant over a sample of crushed quartz he had
brought home with him that there was no concealing his high
spirits. He was even cordial to Samson, whom he detested, and so
full of the milk of human kindness toward everybody else that
they all wanted to stay and be amused by him. But Tess got rid of
them at last by begging Samson to go first ostentatiously and set
them an example, which he did after extracting a promise from her
to see him tte--tte again at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>Then Tess showed her husband the letter that Tom's dog had
thrust into her hand.</p>

<p>"You dine alone tonight, Dick, unless you prefer the club. I'm
going at once. Read this."</p>

<p>It was written in a fine Italic hand on expensive paper, with
corrections here and there as if the writer had obeyed
inspiration first and consulted a dictionary afterward&mdash;a
neat letter, even neat in its mistakes.</p>

<p class="letter">"Most precious friend," it ran, "please visit
me. It is necessary that you find some way of
<strike>avoi</strike> <strike>elu</strike> tricking the guards,
because there are orders not to admit any one and not to let me
out. Please bring with you food from your house, because I am
hungry. A cat and two birds and a monkey have died from the food
cooked for me. I am also thirsty. My mother taught me to drink
wine, but the wine is finished, and I like water the best. Tom
Tripe will try to help you past the guards, but he has no brains,
so you must give him orders. He is very faithful. Please come
soon, and bring a very large quantity of water.<br>

<br>

"Yours with love, YASMINI."</p>

<p>He read the letter and passed it back.</p>

<p>"D'you think it's on the level, Tess?"</p>

<p>"I know it is! Imagine that poor child, Dick, cooped up in a
palace, starving and parching herself for fear of poison!"</p>

<p>"But how are you going to get to her? You can't bowl over
Gungadhura's guards with a sunshade."</p>

<p>"Samson wrote this for me."</p>

<p>Dick Blaine scowled.</p>

<p>"I imagine Samson's favors are paid for sooner or later."</p>

<p>"So are mine, Dick! The beast has called me Theresa three
times this afternoon, and has had the impudence to suggest that
his preferment and my future happiness may bear some relation to
each other."</p>

<p>"See here, Tess, maybe I'd better beat him and have done with
it."</p>

<p>"No. He can't corrupt me, but he might easily do you an
injury. Let him alone, Dick, and be as civil as you can. You did
splendidly this evening&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before I knew what he'd said to you!"</p>

<p>"Now you've all the more reason to be civil. I must keep in
touch with that young girl in the palace, and Samson is the only
influence I can count on. Do as I say, Dick, and be civil to him.
Pretend you're not even suspicious."</p>

<p>"But say, that guy's suggestions aggregate an ounce or two!
First, I'm to draw Gungadhura's money while I hunt for buried
treasure; but I'm to tip off Samson first. Second, I'm to look on
while he makes his political fortune with my wife's help. And
third&mdash;what's the third thing, Tess?"</p>

<p>She kissed him. "The third is that you're going to seem to be
fooled by him, for the present at all events. Let's know what's
at the bottom of all this, and help the princess and Tom Tripe if
it's possible. Are you tired?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"If you weren't tired I was going to ask you to put a turban
on as soon as it's dark, and dress up like a sais and drive me to
Yasmini's palace, with a revolver in each pocket in case of
accidents, and eyes and ears skinned until I come out again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not too tired for that."</p>

<p>"Come along then. I'll put up a hamper with my own hands. You
get wine from the cellar, and make sure the corks have not been
pulled and replaced. Then get the dog-cart to the door. I'll keep
it waiting there while you run up-stairs and change. Hurry,
Dick, hurry&mdash;it's growing dark! I'll put some sandwiches
under the seat for you to eat while you're waiting in the dark
for me."</p> <hr> <br>

&mdash;An Audit By The Gods, Part 2</p><br>


<p class="first">TOM TRIPP had done exactly what Yasmini ordered
him. Like his dog Trotters, whom he had schooled to perfection,
and as he would have liked to have the maharajah's guards behave,
he always fell back on sheer obedience whenever facts bewildered
him or circumstances seemed too strong.</p>

<p>Yasmini had ordered him to report to the maharajah a chance
encounter with an individual named Gunga Singh. Accordingly he
did. Asked who Gunga Singh was, he replied he did not know. She
had told him to say that Gunga Singh said the Princess Yasmini
was at the commissioner's house; so he told the maharajah that
and nothing further. Gungadhura sent two men immediately to make
inquiries. One drew the commissioner's house blank, bribing a
servant to let him search the place in Samson's absence; the
other met the commissioner himself, and demanded of him
point-blank what he had been doing with the princess. The
question was so bluntly put and the man's attitude so impudent
that Samson lost his temper and couched his denial in blunt
bellicose bad language. The vehemence convinced the questioner
that he was lying, as the maharajah was shortly informed. So the
fact became established beyond the possibility of refutation that
Yasmini had been closeted with Samson for several hours that
morning.</p>

<p>Remained, of course, to consider why she had gone to him and
what might result from her visit; and up to a certain point, and
in certain cases accurate guessing is easier than might be
expected for either side to a political conundrum, in India,
ample provision having been made for it by all concerned.</p>

<p>The English are fond of assuring strangers and one another
that spying is "un-English;" that it "isn't done, you know, old
top;" and the surest way of heaping public scorn and indignation
on the enemies of England is to convict them, correctly or
otherwise, of spying on England secretly. So it would be
manifestly libelous, ungentlemanly and proof conclusive of crass
ignorance to assert that Samson in his capacity of commissioner
employed spies to watch Gungadhura Singh. He had no public fund
from which to pay spies. If you don't believe that, then ponder
over a copy of the Indian Estimates. Every rupee is accounted
for.</p>

<p>The members of the maharajah's household who came to see
Samson at more or less frequent intervals were individuals of the
native community whom he encouraged to intimacy for ethnological
and social reasons. When they gave him information about
Gungadhura's doings, that was merely because they were incurably
addicted to gossip; as a gentleman, and in some sense a
representative of His Majesty the King, he would not dream, of
course, of paying attention to any such stuff; but one could not,
of course, be so rude and high-handed as to stop their talking
even if it did tend toward an accurate foreknowledge of the
maharajah's doings that was hardly "cricket."</p>

<p>As for money, certainly none changed hands. The indisputable
fact that certain friends and relatives of certain members of the
maharajah's household enjoyed rather profitable contracts on
British administered territory was coincidence. Everybody knows
how long is the arm of coincidence. Well, then, so are its ears,
and its tongue.</p>

<p>As for the maharajah, the rascal went the length of paying
spies in British government offices. There was never any knowing
who was a spy of his and who wasn't. People were everlastingly
crossing the river from the native state to seek employment in
some government department or other, and one could not
investigate them really thoroughly. It was so easy to forge
testimonials and references and what not. One of Samson's grooms
had once been caught red-handed eavesdropping in the dark.
Samson, of course, took the law into his own hands on that
occasion and thrashed the blackguard within an inch of his
treacherous life; and in proof that the thrashing was richly
deserved, some one reported to Samson the very next day how the
groom had gone straight to the maharajah and had been solaced
with silver money.</p>

<p>It was even said, although never proved, that the fat,
short-sighted young babu Sita Ram who typed the commissioner's
official correspondence was one of Gungadhura's spies. There was
a mystery about where he spent his evenings. But his mother's
uncle was a first-class magistrate, so one could not very well
dismiss him without clear proof. Besides, he was uncommonly
painstaking and efficient.</p>

<p>One way and another it is easy to see that Gungadhura had a
deal of dovetailed information from which to draw conclusions as
to the probable reason of Yasmini's alleged visit to the
commissioner. One false conclusion invariably leads to another,
and so Samson got the blame for the secret bargain with the
Rangar stable-owner, with whose connivance Yasmini had contrived
to keep a carriage available outside her palace gates. Her palace
gates having closed on the carriage now, the guards would pay
attention that it stayed inside, but there was no knowing how
many riding horses she might have at her beck and call in various
khans and palaces. Doubtless Samson had arranged for that.
Gungadhura sent men immediately to search Sialpore for horses
that might be held in waiting for her, with orders to hire or buy
the animals over her head, or in the alternative to lame
them.</p>

<p>As for her motive in visiting the commissioner, that was not
far to seek. There was only one motive in Sialpore for
anything&mdash;the treasure. No doubt Samson lusted for it as
sinfully and lustily and craftily as any one. If, thought
Gungadhura, Yasmini had a clue to its whereabouts, as she might
have, then whoever believed she was not trafficking with the
commissioner must be a simpleton. The commissioner was known to
have written more than one very secret report to Simla on the
subject of the treasure, and on the political consequences that
might follow on its discovery by natives of the country. The
reports had been so secret and important that Gungadhura had
thought it worth while to have the blotting paper from Samson's
desk photographed in Paris by a special process. Adding two and
two together now by the ancient elastic process, Gungadhura soon
reached the stage of absolute conviction that Yasmini was in
league with Samson to forestall him in getting control of the
treasure of his ancestors; and Gungadhura was a dark,
hot-blooded, volcanic-tempered man, who stayed not on the order
of his anger but blew up at once habitually.</p>

<p>We have seen how he came careering down-street just in time to
behold Yasmini's carriage rumble into her stone-paved palace
courtyard. After ordering the guards not to let her escape again
on pain of unnamed, but no less likely because illegal
punishment, he rode full pelt to the temple of Jinendra, whence
they assured him Yasmini had just come, and his spurs rang
presently on the temple floor like the footfalls of avenging
deity.</p>

<p>Jinendra's priest welcomed him with that mixture of deference
and patronage that priests have always known so well how to
extend to royalty, showing him respect because priestly
recognition of his royalty entitled him in logic to the outward
form of it&mdash;patronage because, as the "wisest fool in
Christendom" remarked, "No bishop no king!" The combination of
sarcastic respect and contemptuous politeness produced an
insolence that none except kings would tolerate for a moment; but
Jinendra's fat high priest could guess how far he dared go, as
shrewdly as a marksman's guesses windage.</p>

<p>"She has betrayed us! That foreign she-bastard has betrayed
us!" shouted Gungadhura, slamming the priest's private door
behind him and ramming home the bolt as if it fitted into the
breach of a rifle.</p>

<p>"Peace! Peace, Maharajah sahib! Out of anger came no wise
counsel yet!"</p>

<p>"She has been to the commissioner's house!"</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"You know it? Then she told you?"</p>

<p>The priest was about to lie, but Gungadhura saved him.</p>

<p>"I know she was here," he burst out. "My men followed her
home."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was here. She told."</p>

<p>"How did you make her tell? The she-devil is more cunning than
a cobra!"</p>

<p>Jinendra's high priest smiled complacently.</p>

<p>"A servant of the gods, such as I am, is not altogether
without power. I found a way. She told."</p>

<p>"I, too, will find a way!" muttered Gungadhura to himself.
Then to the priest: "What did she say? Why did she go to the
commissioner?"</p>

<p>"To ask a favor."</p>

<p>"Of course! What favor?"</p>

<p>"That she may go to Europe."</p>

<p>"Then there is no longer any doubt whatever! By Saraswati I
know that she has discovered where the treasure is!"</p>

<p>"My son," said the priest, "it is not manners to call on other
gods by name in this place."</p>

<p>"By Jinendra, then! Thou fat sedentary appetite, what a great
god thine must be, that he can choose no cleverer servant than
thee to muddle his affairs! While you were lulling me to sleep
with dreams about a clue to be found in a cellar, she has already
sucked the secret out from some cobra's hole and has sold it to
the commissioner! As soon as he has paid her a proportion of it
she will escape to Europe to avoid me&mdash;will she?"</p>

<p>"But the commissioner refused the desired permission," said
the priest, puffing his lips and stroking his stomach, as much as
to add, "It's no use getting impatient in Jinendra's temple. We
have all the inside information here."</p>

<p>"What do you make of that?" demanded Gungadhura.</p>

<p>The priest smiled. One does not explain everything to a mere
maharajah. But the mere maharajah was in no mood to be put off
with smiles just then. As Yasmini got the story afterward from
the bald old mendicant, whose piety had recently won him
permission to bask on the comfortable carved stones just outside
the window, Gungadhura burst forth into such explosive profanity
that the high priest ran out of the room. The mendicant vowed
that he heard the door slam&mdash;and so he did; but it was
really Gungadhura, done with argument, on his way to put threat
into action.</p>

<p>The mildest epithet he called Yasmini was "Widyadhara,"* which
meant in his interpretation of the word that she was an evil
spirit condemned to roam the earth because her sins were so awful
that the other evil spirits simply could not tolerate her.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Widyadhara, Vidyadhara</i>
(Sanskrit)&mdash; 'Bearer of Knowledge'; mythical air-space being
in human form having magical knowledge.]</p>

<p>"It is plain that the commissioner fears to let her go to
Europe!" swore Gungadhura. "Therefore it is plain that she and he
have a plan between them to loot the treasure and say nothing.
Neither trusts the other, as is the way of such people! He will
not let her out of sight until he can leave India himself!"</p>

<p>"He has promised to send European memsahibs to call on her,"
said the priest, and the maharajah gnashed his teeth and swore
like a man stung by a hornet.</p>

<p>"That is to prevent me from using violence on her! He will
have frequent reports as to her health! After a time, when he has
his fingers in the treasure, he will not be so anxious about her
welfare!"</p>

<p>"There was another matter that she told me," said the
priest.</p>

<p>"Repeat it then, Belly-of-Jinendra! Thy paunch retains a tale
too long!"</p>

<p>"Tripe, the drill-master, is a welcome guest at the house
built by Jengal Singh."</p>

<p>"What of it?"</p>

<p>"He may enter even when the sahibs are away from home. The
servants have orders to admit him."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>The priest smiled again.</p>

<p>"If it should chance to be true that the princess knows the
secret of the treasure, and that she is selling it to the
commissioner, Tripe could enter that house and discover the clue.
Who could rob you of the treasure once you knew the secret of its
hiding-place?"</p>

<p>It was at that point that the maharajah grew so exasperated at
the thought of another's knowledge of a secret that he considered
rightly his own by heritage, that his language exceeded not only
the bounds of decorum but the limits of commonplace blasphemy as
well. Turning his back on the priest he rushed from the room,
slamming the door behind him. And, being a ruminant fat mortal,
the priest sat so still considering on which side of the equation
his own bread might be buttered as to cause the impression that
the room was empty; whereas only the maharajah had left it. And a
little later the babu Sita Ram came in.</p>

<p>Gungadhura was in no mood to be trifled with. He knew pretty
well where to find Tom Tripe during any of the hours of duty, so
he cornered him without delay and, glaring at him with eyes like
an animal's at bay, ordered him to search the Blaine's house at
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>"Search for what?" demanded Tripe.</p>

<p>"For anything! For everything! Search the cellar; search the
garden; search the roof! Are You a fool? Are you fit for my
employment? Then search the house, and report to me anything
unusual that you find in it! Go!"</p>

<p>After several stiff brandies and soda Gungadhura then
conceived a plan that might have been dangerous supposing Yasmini
to have been less alert, and supposing that she really knew the
secret. He spent an evening coaching Patali, his favorite dancing
girl, and then sent her to Yasmini with almost full powers to
drive a bargain. She might offer as much as half of the treasure
to Yasmini provided Gungadhura should receive the other half and
the British should know nothing. That was the one point on which
Patali's orders permitted no discretion. The whole transaction
must be secret from the British.</p>

<p>Reporting the encounter afterward to her employer Patali
hardly seemed proud of her share in it. All the information she
brought back was to the effect that Yasmini denied all knowledge
of the treasure, and all desire to possess it.</p>

<p>"I think she knows nothing. She said very little to me. She
laughed at the idea of bargaining with Englishmen. She said you
are welcome to the treasure, maharajah sahib, and that if she
should ever find its hiding-place she will certainly tell you.
She plays the part of a woman whose spirit is already broken and
who is weary of India."</p>

<p>Having a very extensive knowledge of dancing girls and their
ways, Gungadhura did not believe much more than two per cent. of
Patali's account of what had taken place, and he was right,
except that he grossly overestimated her truthfulness. And even
with his experienced cynicism it never entered his head to
suppose that Patali was the individual who warned Yasmini in
advance of the preparations being made to poison her by
Gungadhura's orders. Yet, as it was Patali's own sister who made
the sweetmeats, and tampered with the charcoal for the filter,
and put the powdered diamonds in the chutney, it was likely
enough that Patali would know the facts; and as for motives,
dancing girls don't have them. They fear, they love, they desire,
they seek to please. If Yasmini could pluck heart-strings more
cleverly than Gungadhura could break and bruise them, so much the
worse for Gungadhura's plans, that was all, as far as Patali was
concerned.</p>

<p>For several days after that, as Yasmini more than hinted in
her letter to Tess, repeated efforts were made to administer
poison in the careful undiscoverable ways that India has made her
own since time immemorial. But you can not easily poison any one
who does not eat, and who drinks wine that was bottled in Europe;
or at any rate, to do it you must call in experts who are
expensive in the first place as well as adepts at blackmail in
the second. Yasmini enjoyed a charmed life and an increasing
appetite, Gungadhura's guards attending to it however, that she
took no more forbidden walks and rides and swims by moonlight to
make the hunger really unendurable. Supplies were allowed to pass
through the palace gate, after they had been tampered with.</p>

<p>Finally Gungadhura, biting his nails and drinking whisky in
the intervals between consultation with a dozen different sets of
priests, made up his mind to drastic action. It dawned on his
exasperated mind that every single priest, including Jinendra's
obese incumbent, was trying to take advantage of his predicament
in order to feather a priestly nest or forward plans
diametrically opposed to his own. (Not that recognition of
priestly deception made him less superstitious, or any less
dependent on the priest; if that were the way discovery worked,
all priests would have vanished long ago. It simply made him
furious, like a tiger in a net, and spurred him to wreak damage
in which the priests might have no hand.)</p>

<p>Whisky, drugs, reflection and the hints of twenty dancing
girls convinced him that Jinendra's priest especially was playing
a double game; for what was there in the fat man's mental
ingredients that should anchor his loyalty to an ill-tempered
prince, in case a princess of wit and youth and brilliant beauty
should stake her cunning in the game? Why was not Yasmini already
ten times dead of poison? Nothing but the cunning inspired by
partnership with priests, and alertness born of secret knowledge,
could have given her the intelligence to order her maids to boil
a present of twenty pairs of French silk stockings&mdash;nor the
malice to hang them afterward with her own hands on a line across
her palace roof in full view of Gungadhura's window!</p>

<p>Hatred of Yasmini was an obsession of his in any case. He had
loathed her mother, who dared try to wear down the rule that
women must be veiled. Even his own dancing girls were heavily
veiled in public, and all his relations with women of any sort
took place behind impenetrable screens. He was a stickler for
that sort of thing and, like others of his kidney, rather proud
of the rumors that no curtains could confine. So he loathed and
despised Yasmini even more than he had detested her mother,
because she coupled to her mother's Western notions about freedom
a wholly Eastern ability to take advantage of restraint. In other
words she was too clever for him.</p>

<p>On top of all that she had dared outrage his royal feelings by
refusing to be given in marriage to the husband be selected for
her&mdash;a fine, black &mdash;bristling, stout cavalier of sixty
with a wife or two already and impoverished estates that would
have swallowed Yasmini's fortune nicely at a gulp. Incidentally,
the husband would have eagerly canceled a gambling debt in
exchange for a young wife with an income.</p>

<p>There was no point at which Yasmini and himself could meet on
less than rapier terms. Her exploits in disguise were
notorious&mdash;so notorious that men sang songs about them in
the drinking places and the khans. And as if that were not bad
enough there was a rumor lately that she had turned Abhisharika.
The word is Sanskrit and poetic. To the ordinary folk, who like
to listen to love-stories by moonlight on the roofs or under
trees, that meant that she had chosen her own lover and would go
to him, when the time should come, of her own free will. To
Gungadhura, naturally, such a word bore other meanings. As we
have said, he was a stickler for propriety.</p>

<p>Last, and most uncomfortable crime of all, it seemed that she
had now arranged with Samson to have English ladies call on her
at intervals. Not a prophet on earth could guess where that might
lead to, and to what extremes of Western fashion; for though one
does not see the high-caste women of Rajputana, they themselves
see everything and know all that is going on. But it needed no
prophet to explain that a woman visited at intervals by the wives
of English officers could not be murdered easily or safely.</p>

<p>All arguments pointed one way. He must have it out with
Yasmini in one battle royal. If she should be willing to
surrender, well and good. He would make her pay for the past, but
no doubt there were certain concessions that he could yield
without loss of dignity. If she knew the secret of the
hiding-place of the treasure he would worm it out of her. There
are ways, he reflected, of worming secrets from a
woman&mdash;ways and means. If she knew the secret and refused to
tell, then he knew how to provide that she should never tell any
one else. If she had told some one else already, &mdash;Samson,
for instance, or Jinendra's priest&mdash;then he would see to it
that priest or commissioner, as the case might be, must carry on
without the cleverest member of the firm.</p>

<p>But he must hurry. Poison apparently would not work and he did
not dare murder her outright, much as he would have liked to. It
was maddening to think how one not very violent blow with a club
or a knife would put an end to her willfulness forever, and yet
that the risk to himself in that case would be almost as deadly
as the certainty for her. But accidents might happen. In a land
of elephants, tigers, snakes, wild boars and desperate men there
is a wide range for circumstance, and the sooner the accident the
less the risk of interference by some inquisitive English woman
with a ticket-of-admission signed by Samson.</p>

<p>An "accident" in Yasmini's palace, he decided would be nearly
as risky as murder. But he had a country-place fifty miles away
in the mountains, to which she could be forcibly removed, thus
throwing inquisitive Englishwomen off the scent for a while at
any rate. That secluded little hunting box stood by a purple lake
that had already drowned its dozens, not always without setting
up suspicion; and between the city of Sialpore and the
"Nesting-place of Seven Swans" lay leagues of wild road on which
anything at all might happen and be afterward explained away.</p>

<p>As for the forcible abduction, that could best be got around
by obliging her to write a letter to himself requesting
permission to visit the mountains for a change of air and
scenery. There were ways and means of obliging women to write
letters.</p>

<p>Best of all, of course, would be Yasmini's unconditional
surrender, because then he would be able to make use of her wits
and her information, instead of having to explain away her
"accident" and cope alone with any one whom she might already
have entrusted with her secret. There should be a strenuous
effort first to bring her to her senses. Physical pain, he had
noticed, had more effect on people's senses than any amount of
argument. There had been a very amusing instance recently. One of
his dancing girls named Malati had refused recently to sing and
dance her best before a man to whom Gungadhura had designed to
make a present of her; but the mere preliminaries of removing a
toe-nail behind the scenes had changed her mind within three
minutes.</p>

<p>Then there were other little humorous contrivances. There is a
way of tying an intended convert to your views in such ingenious
fashion that the lightest touch of a finger on taut catgut
stretched from limb to limb, causes exquisite agony. And a
cigarette end, of course, applied in such circumstances to the
tenderer parts has great power to persuade.</p>

<p>As to accomplices, those must be few and carefully chosen.
Alone against Yasmini he knew he would have no chance whatever,
for she was physically stronger than a panther, and as swift and
graceful. But there are creatures, not nearly yet extinct from
Eastern courts, known as eunuchs, whose strongest quality is
seldom said to be mercy, and whose chief business in life is to
be amenable to orders and to guard with their lives their
master's secrets. Three were really too many to be let into such
a secret; but it had needed two to hold Malati properly while the
third experimented on the toe-nail, and Yasmini was much stronger
than Malati; so he must chance it and take three.</p>

<p>The only remaining problem did not trouble him much. The
palace guards were his own men, and were therefore not likely to
question his right to ignore the first law of purdah that forbids
the crossing of a woman's threshold, especially after dark,
unless she is your property. Besides, they all knew already what
sort of prowl-by-night their master was, and laws, especially
such laws, were, made for other people, not for maharajahs.</p>

"That will be the end of Gungadhura!"</h2>

<p class="verse">A bloody enlisted man&mdash;that's me,<br>

A peg in the officer's plan&mdash;maybe.<br>

Drunk on occasion,<br>

Disgrace to a nation<br>

And proper societee.<br>

Yet I've a notion the sky&mdash;pure blue<br>

<p class="first">IT took longer to get the hamper ready than Tess
expected, partly because it did not seem expedient to have the
butler Chamu in the secret. By the time she and her husband were
up side by side in the dog-cart there was already a nearly full
moon silvering the sky, and the jackals were yelping miserably on
the hillside. Before they reached the stifling town a slow breeze
had moved the river-mist, until a curtain shut off the whole of
the bazaar and merchants' quarters from the better residential
section where the palaces stood. It was an ideal night for
adventure; an almost perfect night for crime; one could step from
street to street and leave no clue, because of the drifting
vapor.</p>

<p>Here and there a solitary policeman coughed after they had
passed, or slunk into a shadow lest they recognize and report him
for sleeping at his post. All sahibs have unreasonable habits,
and not even a constable can guess which one will not make
trouble for him. An occasional stray dog yapped at the wheels,
and more than once heads peered over roof-tops to try and glimpse
them, because gossip&mdash;especially about sahibs who are out
after dark &mdash;is a coinage of its own that buys welcome and
refreshment almost anywhere. But nothing in particular happened
until the horse struck sparks from the granite flagstones outside
Yasmini's gate, and a sleepy Rajput sentry brought his rifle to
the challenge.</p>

<p>Then it was not exactly obvious what to do next. Tess felt
perfectly confident on the high seat, with the pistol in her
husband's pocket pressing against her and his reassuring bulk
between her and the sentry; but everywhere else was insecurity
and doubt. One does not as a rule descend from dog-carts after
dark and present half-sheets of paper by way of passports for
admission to Rajput palaces. The sentry looked mildly interested,
no more. He had been so thoroughly warned and threatened in case
of efforts to escape from within, that it did not enter his head
that any one might want to enter. However, since the dog-cart
continued to stand still in front of the gate, he turned the
guard out as a matter of routine; one never knew when sahibs will
not complain about discourtesy.</p>

<p>The guard lined up at attention&mdash;eight men and a
risaldar&mdash; double the regular number by Gungadhura's orders.
The risaldar stepped up close to the dog-cart and spoke to the
man he imagined was the sais, using, as was natural, the Rajput
tongue. But Dick Blaine only knew enough of the language for
fetch and carry purposes&mdash;not enough to deceive a native as
to his nationality after the first two words.</p>

<p>"Now I feel foolish!" said Tess, and the risaldar of the guard
thrust his bearded face closer, supposing she spoke to him. Dick
answered her.</p>

<p>"Shall I drive you home again, little woman? Say, the word and
we're off."</p>

<p>"Not yet. I haven't tried my ammunition."</p>

<p>She pulled out Samson's scribbled permit and was about to
offer it to the guard. But there was a risk that whatever she did
would only arouse and increase his suspicions, and she offered it
nervously.</p>

<p>"What if he won't give it back to you?" asked her husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick, you're a regular prophet of evil tonight!"</p>

<p>However, she withdrew the paper before the guard's fingers,
closed on it. The next moment a figure like a phantom, making no
noise, almost made her scream. Dick produced a repeating pistol
with that sudden swiftness that proves old acquaintance with the
things, and the corporal of the guard sprang back with a shout of
warning to his men, imagining the pistol was intended for
himself. Tess recovered presence of mind first.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Dick. Put the gun out of sight."</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand and a cold nose touched her
finger-ends, sniffing them. A dog's forefeet were on the shaft,
and his eyes gleamed balefully in the carriage lamp light.</p>

<p>"Good Trotters! Good boy, Trotters!"</p>

<p>She remembered Tom Tripe's lecture about calling dogs by name,
wondering whether the rule applied to owners only, or whether
she, too, could make the creature "do this own thinking." Before
she could decide what she would like the dog to think about he
was gone again as silently as he had come. The guard was
thoroughly on the qui vive by that time, if not suspicious, then
officious. How should one protect the privacy of a palace gate if
unknown memsahibs in dog-carts, with saises who knew English but
did not answer when spoken to in the native tongue, were to be
allowed to draw up in front of the gate at unseemly hours and
remain there indefinitely. The risaldar ordered Tess away without
further ceremony, making his meaning plain by taking the horse's
head and starting him.</p>

<p>Dick Blaine drew the horse back on his haunches and cursed the
man for that piece of impudence, in language and with mannerisms
that banished forever any delusions as to his nationality; and it
occurred to the officer that his extra complement of men,
standing in a row like dummies at attention, were not there after
all for nothing. He despatched two of them at a run to
Gungadhura's palace, the one to tell the story of what had
happened and the other to add to it whatever the first might
omit. Between them they were likely to produce results of some
sort.</p>

<p>"Now we're done for!" sighed Tess. "No chance tonight, I'm
afraid. If only I'd done what she told me to and consulted with
Tom Tripe first. Better drive home now, Dick, before we make the
case worse."</p>

<p>The unreasonableness of the attempt convinced and discouraged
her. It was like a nightmare. But as Dick reined the horse about
there came out of the mist the sound of another horse at a walk,
and two men marching in step. Then a man's voice broke the
stillness. Dick reined in, and a second later Trotters' huge paws
rested on the shaft again. Tess could see his long,
unenthusiastic tail wagging to and fro.</p>

<p>"Tom!" she called. "Tom Tripe!"</p>

<p>"Coming, lady!"</p>

<p>Three figures emerged out of the gloom, one of them mounted
and loquacious.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what these rascally guards are doing off
their post! Give these sons of camp-followers an inch and they'll
take three leagues, every mother's son of them! Halt, there, you!
Now then, where's your officer? Give an account of
yourselves!"</p>

<p>There followed an interlude in Rajasthani. Tom Tripe becoming
more blasphemously vehement as it grew clearer that the risaldar
had done entirely right.</p>

<p>"Lady," he said presently, riding round to Tess's side of the
dog-cart. "I'm going to have hard work to convince this man. I'd
orders from Gungadhura to search your house, Krishna knows what
for, and I rode up to ask your leave to do it, hoping you'd be
alone after the party. Chamu told me you and your husband had
gone out, and one of the three beggars gave me a message intended
for you that tallied pretty close with one I knew you'd received
already, so I guessed where to head for, and sent the dog in
advance. He came back with his hair on end reporting trouble, and
then as luck would have it I rode into these two men on their way
to Gungadhura. If they'd reached him, we'd all have had to make
new plans tomorrow morning! You want to see the princess, of
course? But what have you got that can get by the guard?"</p>

<p>Tess produced Samson's scribbled note, and he studied it in
the carriage lamplight. Then she recalled Yasmini's warning that
Tom Tripe had no brains and must be told what to do. Her own wits
began to work desperately.</p>

<p>"I'm the lady doctor, Tom. That is my written order from the
burra sahib."</p>

<p>Tom scratched his head and swore in a low voice fervently.</p>

<p>"The difficulty's this, lady: since the escape from the palace
across the river, the maharajah has taken the posting of palace
guards out of my hands entirely. I've still the duty to inspect
and make sure they're on the job &mdash;Oh, I see! I have
it!"</p>

<p>He turned on the corporal with all the savagery that the white
man generates in contact with Eastern subordinates.</p>

<p>"What do you mean," he demanded in the man's own language, "by
standing in the way of the maharajah sahib's orders? Here's his
highness sending a lady doctor to the princess for an excuse to
confine her elsewhere and have all this trouble off our hands,
and you, like a blockhead, stand in the way to prevent it!
See&mdash;there's the letter!"</p>

<p>The Rajput looked perplexed. All the world knows what
privileges the rare American women doctors enjoy in that land of
sealed seraglios.</p>

<p>"But it is written in English," he objected. "The maharajah
sahib does not write English."</p>

<p>"Idiot! Of what use would a letter in Persian be to an
American lady doctor?"</p>

<p>"But to me? It is I who command the guard and must read the
letter. How can I read the letter?"</p>

<p>"I'll read it to you. What's more, I'll explain it. The
princess has been appealing to the commissioner sahib&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Rajput nodded. It was all over town that Yasmini had been
closeted with the commissioner on the morning of her recent
escape. She herself had deliberately sown the seeds of that
untruth.</p>

<p>"So the commissioner sahib and the maharajah sahib had a
conference &mdash;"</p>

<p>The Rajput nodded again. It was common knowledge, too that the
commissioner and Gungadhura had had a rather stormy interview the
day before; and it was none of the corporal's privilege to know
that all they had argued about was the ill-treatment of prisoners
in the Sialpore jail.</p>

<p>"&mdash;It was agreed at the conference that if the princess
can be proved mad, then the maharajah sahib may do as he's minded
about sending her away into the hills. If she's not mad, then
he's to give her her liberty. Do you understand, you
dunderhead?"</p>

<p>"Hah! I understand. But why at night? Why not the maharajah
sahib's signature in his own writing?"</p>

<p>"Son of incomprehension! Does the maharajah sahib wish still
more scandal than already has been by permitting such a visit in
the daytime? Strike me everlasting dumb if he hasn't had more
than enough already! Does he want the responsibility? Does he
wish the British to say afterward that it was all the maharajah's
doing? No, you ass! At the conference be agreed solely on
condition that the commissioner sahib should sign the letter and
relieve his highness of all blame in case of a verdict of
madness. And it was decided to send an American, lest there be
too much talk among the British themselves. Now, do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Hah! I understand. If all this is true the matter is easy. I
will send one of the guard with that letter to the maharajah
sahib. He will write his name on it and send it back, and all is
well."</p>

<p>"Suit yourself!" sneered Tom Tripe. "The maharajah sahib is
with his dancing girls this minute. What happened to the last man
who interrupted his amusements?"</p>

<p>The Rajput hesitated. The answer to that question could be
seen any day near the place they call the Old Gate, where beggars
sit in rags.</p>

<p>"Shall I offer him money?" whispered Tess.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, no, lady! The man's a decent soldier. He'd
refuse it and we'd all be in the apple-cart! Leave him to
me."</p>

<p>He turned again on the Rajput.</p>

<p>"You know who I am, don't you? You know it's my duty to see
that the palace guards attend to business, eh? That's why I'm
here tonight. His highness particularly warned me to see that if
anything unusual wanted doing it should get done. If you want to
question my authority you'll have it out with me before his
highness in the morning first thing."</p>

<p>The Rajput obviously wavered. Everybody knew that the first
thing in the morning was no good time to appear on charges before
a man who spent his nights as Gungadhura did.</p>

<p>"Who is to enter? A man and a woman?"</p>

<p>"No, you idiot! A lady doctor only. And nobody's to know.
You'd better warn your men that if there's any talk about this
night's business the palace guard will catch the first blast of
the typhoon. Gungadhura's anger isn't mild in these days!"</p>

<p>"Show me the letter again," said the Rajput. "Let me keep it
in case I am brought to book."</p>

<p>Tom translated that to Tess and her husband.</p>

<p>"It's this way, ma'am. If you let him keep the letter I
suspect he'll let you go in. But he may show it to the maharajah
in the morning, and then there'll be hot fat in the fire. If you
don't let him keep it, perhaps he'll admit you and perhaps he
won't; but if you keep the letter, and trouble comes of it, he
and I'll both be in the soup! Never mind about me. Maybe I'm too
valuable to be sent packing. I'll take the chance. But this man's
a decent soldier, and he'd be helpless."</p>

<p>"Let him keep it," said Tess.</p>

<p>Tom turned on the Rajput again.</p>

<p>"Here's the letter. Take it. But mark this! What his highness
wants tonight is discretion. There might be promotion for a man
who'd say nothing about this night's work. If, on top of that, he
was soldier enough to keep his men from talking he'd be reported
favorably to his highness by Tom Tripe. Who got you made
risaldar, eh? Who stood up for you, when you were charged with
striking Gullam Singh? Was Tom Tripe's friendship worth having
then? Now suit yourself! I've said all I'm going to say."</p>

<p>The Rajput muttered something in his beard, stared again at
the letter as if that of itself would justify him, looked sharply
at Tess, whose hamper might or might not be corroborative
evidence, folded the letter away in his tunic pocket, and made a
gesture of assent.</p>

<p>"Now, lady, hurry!" said Tom. "And here's hoping you're right
about there being no hell! I've told lies enough tonight to damn
my soul forever! Once you're safely through the gate I'll have a
word or two more with the guard, and then your husband and I will
go to a place close by that I know of and wait for you."</p>

<p>But Tess objected to that. "Please don't leave me waiting for
you in the dark outside the gate when I return! Why not keep the
carriage here; my husband won't mind."</p>

<p>"Might make talk, ma'am. I'll leave Trotters here to watch for
you. He'll bring word in less than a minute."</p>

<p>Tom Tripe dismounted to help her out of the dog-cart. The
Rajput struck the iron gate as if he expected to have to wake the
dead and take an hour about it. But it opened suspiciously
quickly and a bearded Afridi, of all unlikely people, thrust an
expectant face outward, rather like a tortoise emerging from its
shell, blinking as he tried to recognize the shadowy forms that
moved in the confusing lamplight. He seemed to know whom to
expect and admit, for he beckoned Tess with a long crooked
forefinger the moment she approached the gate, and in another ten
seconds the iron clanged behind her, shutting her off from
husband and all present hope of succor. The chance of any rescuer
entering the palace that night, whether by force or subtlety, was
infinitesimal.</p>

<p>The strange gate-man&mdash;he had a little kennel of a place
to sleep in just inside the entrance&mdash;snatched the hamper
from Tess and led her almost at a run across an ancient courtyard
whose outlines were nearly invisible except where the yellow
light of one ancient oil lantern on an iron bracket showed a part
of the palace wall and a steep flight of stone steps, worn down
the middle by centuries of sandals. Everything else was in gloom
and shadow, and only one chink of light betrayed the whereabouts
of a curtained window. The Afridi led her up the stone steps, and
paused at the top to hammer on a carved door with his clenched
fist; but the door moved while his fist was in mid-air, and the
merry-eyed maid who opened it mocked him for a lunatic. Dumb,
apparently, in the presence of woman, he slunk down the steps
again, leaving Tess wondering whether it were not good manners to
remove her shoes before entering. Natives of the country always
removed their shoes before entering her house, and she supposed
it would be only decent to reciprocate.</p>

<p>However, the maid took her by the hand and pulled her inside
without further ceremony, not letting go of the hand even to
close the door, but patting it and making much of her, smiling
the welcome that they had no words in common to express. The
little outer hall in which they stood was shut off by curtains
six yards high, all smothered in a needlework of peacocks that
generations of patient fingers must have toiled at. Pulling these
apart the maid led her into an inner hall fifty or sixty feet
long, the first sight of which banished all diffidence about her
shoes; for never had she seen such medley of East and West, such
toning down of Oriental mysticism with the sheer utility of
European importations; and that without incongruity.</p>

<p>The lamps, of which there were dozens, were mostly Russian.
Some of the furniture was Buhl, some French. There were hangings
that looked like loot from the Peking Summer Palace, and tapestry
from Gobelin. In a place of honor on a side wall was an icon,
framed in gold, and facing that an image of the Buddha done in
greenish bronze, flanked by a Dutch picture of the Twelve
Apostles with laughably Dutch faces receiving instruction on a
mountain from a Christ whose other name was surely Hans.</p>

<p>Down the center of the hall, leading to a gallery, was a
magnificent stairway of marble and lapis lazuli, carpeted with
long Bukhara strips so well joined end to end that the whole
looked like one piece. And at the top of those stairs Yasmini
stood waiting, her golden hair illuminated by glass lamps on
either marble column at the stairhead. She was as different from
the Gunga Singh of riding boots and turban as the morning is from
night&mdash; the loveliest, bewitchingest girl in silken gossamer
that Tess had ever set eyes on.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come!" she shouted gleefully. "I knew you
would get in! I knew you are my friend! Oh, I'm glad! I'm
glad!"</p>

<p>She pirouetted a dozen times on bare toes at the top of the
stairs, spinning until her silken skirts expanded in a nimbus,
then danced down-stairs into Tess's arms, where she clung,
panting and laughing.</p>

<p>"I'm so hungry! Oh, I'm hungry! Did you bring the food?"</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed!" Tess answered. "The man set it down outside the
door and I left it there."</p>

<p>But Yasmini gave a little shrill of delight, and Tess turned
to see that another maid had brought it.</p>

<p>"How many of you are there?"</p>

<p>"Five."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven! I've brought enough for a square meal for a
dozen."</p>

<p>"We have eaten a little, little bit each day of the servants'
rice, washing it first for hours, until today, when two of the
servants were taken sick and we thought perhaps their food was
poisoned too. Oh, we're hungry!"</p>

<p>Hasamurti, Yasmini's maid, opened the basket on the floor and
crowed aloud. Tess apologized.</p>

<p>"I knew nothing about the caste restrictions, but I've put in
meat jelly &mdash;and bread&mdash;and fruit&mdash;and
rice&mdash;and nuts&mdash; and milk&mdash;and tea&mdash;and
wine&mdash;and sugar&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yasmini laughed.</p>

<p>"I am as Western as I choose to be, and only pretend to caste
when I see fit. My maids do as I do, or they seek another
mistress. Come!"</p>

<p>Hasamurti would have spread a banquet there on the floor, but
Yasmini led them up-stairs, holding Tess by the hand, turning to
the right at the stairhead into a room all cream and golden,
lighted by hanging lamps that shone through disks of colored
glass. There she pulled Tess down beside her on to a great soft
divan and they all ate together, the maids munching their share
while they served their mistress. They devoured the milk, and
left the wine, eating, all things considered, astonishingly
moderately.</p>

<p>"Now we ought all to go to sleep," announced Yasmini, yawning,
and then bubbling with delighted laughter at the expression of
Tess's face. "The people outside might wait!"</p>

<p>"Great heavens, child. Do you suppose I can stay here
indefinitely?" Tess demanded. "I must be gone in an hour or my
husband will murder the guard and force an entrance!"</p>

<p>"I will have just such a husband soon," announced Yasmini.
"When I send him one little word, he will cut the throats of
thirty men and come to me through flames! Let us try your
husband," she added as an afterthought &mdash;then laughed again
at Tess's expression of dissent, and nodded.</p>

<p>"I, too, will be careful how I risk my husband! Men are but
moths in a woman's hands&mdash;fragile&mdash;but the good ones
are precious. Besides, we have no time tonight for sport. I must
escape."</p>

<p>Evidently Tess was causing her exquisite amusement. The
thought of being an accomplice in any such adventure stirred all
her Yankee common sense to its depths, and she had none of the
Eastern trick of not displaying her emotions.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, child! Let me go to the commissioner and warn him
that you are being starved to death in this place. I will
threaten him with public scandal if he doesn't put an end to it
at once."</p>

<p>"Pouf!" laughed Yasmini. "Samson sahib would make a nice
clumsy accomplice! He would send me to Calcutta, where I should
be poisoned sooner or later for a certainty, because Gungadhura
would send agents to attend to that. They would wait months and
months for their opportunity, and I can not always stay awake.
Meanwhile Samson sahib would claim praise from his government,
and they would put some more initials at the end of his name, and
promote him to a bigger district with more pay. No! Samson sahib
shall have another district surely, but even he in his conceit
will not consider it promotion! There will not be room for Samson
sahib in Sialpore when I am maharani!"</p>

<p>"You maharani? It was you yourself who told me that Gungadhura
has lots of children, who all stand between you and the throne.
Do you mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Again the bell-like laugh announced utter enjoyment of Tess's
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"No, I will kill nobody. I will not even send snakes in a
basket to Gungadhura. That scorpion shall sting himself to death
if he sees fit, with a ring of the fire of ridicule all about him
and no friends to console him, and no hope&mdash;nothing but
disappointment and fear and rage! I will kill nobody. Yet I will
be maharani within the month!"</p>

<p>Suddenly she grew deadly serious, her young face darkening as
the sky does when a quick cloud hides the sun.</p>

<p>"What is your husband's contract with Gungadhura? May he dig
for gold anywhere? He is digging now, isn't he, close to the
British fort on the 'island' in our territory&mdash;that fort
with the flagstaff on it that can be seen from Gungadhura's roof?
He is wasting time!"</p>

<p>"He has found a little vein of gold," said Tess, "that will
likely lead to a bigger vein."</p>

<p>"He is wasting time! Sita Ram, who has a compass, and who
knows all that goes on in Samson sahib's office, sent me word
that the little vein of gold runs nearly due north. In another
week at the rate the men are digging your husband will be under
the fort. That is English territory. The English have nothing to
do with Gungadhura's contract. They will take the gold your
husband finds and give him nothing. Then Samson sahib would be
considered a most excellent commissioner and would surely get
promotion! Pouf!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps my husband can make a separate bargain with the
English."</p>

<p>"Pouf! Samson sahib is an idiot, but he is not fool enough to
give away what would be in his hands already! I myself, hidden
beneath your window, heard him give you clear warning on that
point! No, there must be another plan. Your husband must dig
elsewhere."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, Gungadhura knows already that my husband has
found a 'leader.' He is all worked up about it, and goes every
day to watch the progress."</p>

<p>"Surely&mdash;knowing as well as I do that the vein is leading
toward the fort. He goes afterward to the priests, and prays that
the vein of gold may turn another way and save him from
bankruptcy! Listen? I speak truth! I speak to you woman to
woman&mdash;womb to womb! I will count myself accursed, and will
let a cobra bite me if I tell you now one word that is not true!
Do you believe I am going to tell you the truth?"</p>

<p>Tess nodded. Yasmini, by her own admission, would lie
deliberately when that suited her; but the truth tells itself, as
it were, and there is no mistaking it, except by such as lie
invariably, of whom there is a multifarious host.</p>

<p>"If your husband continues digging near the fort he will get
nothing, because the English will take it all. If he digs in a
certain other place he will get a very great fortune!"</p>

<p>"But, my dear, supposing that is quite true, how shall he
convince Gungadhura, after all the outlay and expense of the
present operations, that it's best to abandon them and begin all
over again in another place?"</p>

<p>Yasmini lay back on the cushions, drew something out from
under one of them, and laughed softly, as if enjoying a deep
underflow of secret information.</p>

<p>"Gungadhura himself shall insist on it!"</p>

<p>"What? On starting again in a new place?"</p>

<p>Yasmini nodded.</p>

<p>"Only do as I say, and Gungadhura himself shall insist."</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do?"</p>

<p>Tess was beginning to feel alarmed again. She knew to a rupee
how much Gungadhura had been obliged to pay out for the digging.
To make herself responsible even in degree for the abandonment of
all that outlay would be risky, even if no other construction
could be placed on it.</p>

<p>"Has Tom Tripe been told to search your house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, so he says."</p>

<p>"Do you know the cellar of your house?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It is dark. Are you afraid to go there?"</p>

<p>"No. Why?"</p>

<p>"Is there a flat stone in a corner of the cellar floor that
once had a ring in it but the ring is broken out?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good. Then Sita Ram did not lie to me. Take this." She gave
her a little silver tube, capped at either end and sealed heavily
with wax. "There is a writing inside it&mdash;done in Persian.
Hide that under the stone, and let Tom Tripe search the cellar
and find it there; but forbid him to remove it."</p>

<p>"If I only knew what you are driving at!" said Tess with a wry
smile.</p>

<p>A clumsier conspirator might have lost the game at that point
by over-emphasis, for Tess was wavering between point-blank
refusal and delay that would give her time to consult her
husband. But Yasmini, even at that age, was adept at feeling her
way nicely. Again she lay back on the cushion, and this time lit
a cigarette, smoking lazily.</p>

<p>"The stake that I am playing for&mdash;the stake that I shall
surely win," she said after a minute, "is too big to be risked.
If you are afraid, let us forget all that I have said. Let us be
friends and nothing more."</p>

<p>Tess did not answer. She recognized the appeal to her own
pride, and ignored it. What she was thinking of was Gungadhura's
beastliness&mdash;his attempts to poison Yasmini&mdash;his
treatment of women generally&mdash; his cruelty to animals in the
arena&mdash;his viciousness; and then, of how much more queenly
if nothing else, this girl would likely be than ever Gungadhura
could be kingly. It was tempting enough to have a hand in
substituting Yasmini for Gungadhura on the throne of Sialpore if
the chance of doing it were real.</p>

<p>Yasmini seemed able to read her thoughts, or at all events to
guess them.</p>

<p>"When I am maharani," she said, "there will be an end of
Gungadhura's swinishness. Moreover, promises will all be kept,
unwritten ones as well as written. Gungadhura's contracts will be
carried out. Do you believe me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I believe that."</p>

<p>"Let Tom Tripe find that silver tube in your cellar then. But
listen! When Gungadhura comes to your husband and insists on
digging elsewhere, let your husband bargain like a huckster! Let
him at first refuse. It may be that Gungadhura will let him
continue where he digs, and will himself send men to start
digging in the other place. In that case, well and good."</p>

<p>"I would prefer that, said Tess. "My husband is a mining
engineer. I think he would hate to abandon a true lead for a whim
of some one's else."</p>

<p>Yasmini's bright eyes gleamed intelligence. She was only
learning in those days to bend people to her own imperious will
and to use others' virtues for own ends as readily as their
vices. She recognized the necessity of yielding to Tess's
compunctions, more than suspecting that Dick Blaine would color
his own views pretty much to suit his wife's in any case. And
with a lightning ability peculiar to her she saw how to improve
her own plan by yielding.</p>

<p>"That is settled, then," she said lazily. "Your husband shall
continue to dig near the fort, if he so wishes. But let him show
Samson sahib some specimens of the gold&mdash;how little it
is&mdash;how feeble&mdash;how uncertain. Be sure he does that,
please. That will be the end of Gungadhura. And now it is time to
escape from here, and for you to help me."</p>

<p>Tess resigned herself to the inevitable. Whatever the
consequences, she was not willing to leave Yasmini to starve or
be poisoned.</p>

<p>"I'm ready!" she said. "What's the plan?"</p>

<p>"I shall leave all the maids behind. They have food enough for
the morning. In the morning, after it is known that I have
escaped, word shall be sent to Samson sahib that the women in
this palace have nothing but poisoned food to eat. He must beard
Gungadhura about that or lose his own standing with the
English."</p>

<p>"But how will you escape?"</p>

<p>"Nay, that is not the difficulty. Your husband and Tom Tripe
are waiting with the carriage. My part is easy. This is the
problem: how will you follow me?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"I must wear your clothes. In the dark I shall get past the
guard, making believe that I am you."</p>

<p>"Then how shall I manage?"</p>

<p>"You must do as I say. I can contrive it. Come, the maids and
I will make a true Rajputni of you. Only I must study how to walk
as you do; please walk along in front of me&mdash;that
way&mdash;follow Hasamurti through that door into my room. I will
study how you move your feet and shoulders."</p>

<p>Looking back as she followed Hasamurti, Tess witnessed a
caricature of herself that made her laugh until the tears
came.</p>

<p>"It is well!" said Yasmini. "This night began in hunger, like
the young moon. Now is laughter without malice. In a few hours
will be bright dawn &mdash;and after that, success!"</p> <hr>

&mdash;An Elephant Interlude</p><br>


<p class="first">THERE was brandy in the place that Tom Tripe
knew of&mdash; brandy and tobacco and a smell of elephants. Dick
Blaine, who scarcely ever touched strong liquor, having had
intimate acquaintance with abuse of it in Western mining camps,
had to sit and endure the spectacle of Tom's chief weakness,
glass after glass of the fiery stuff descending into a stomach
long since rendered insatiable by soldiering on peppery food in a
climate that is no man's friend. He protested a dozen times.</p>

<p>"We may need our wits tonight, Tom. Suppose we both keep
sober."</p>

<p>"Man alive, I've been doing this for years. Brandy and brains
are the same in my case. Keep me without it, and by bedtime I'm
an invalid. Give me all I want of it, and I'm a crafty
soldier-man."</p>

<p>Dick Blaine refilled his pipe and watched for an opportunity.
He had heard that kind of argument before, and had conquered
flood and fire with the aid of the very men who used it, that
being the gift (or whatever you like to call it) that had made
him independent while the others drew monthly pay in
envelopes.</p>

<p>It was a low oblong shed they sat in, with a wide door opening
on a side street within four hundred yards of Yasmini's palace
gate. It was furnished with a table, two chairs and a cot for Tom
Tripe's special use whenever the maharajah's business should
happen to keep him on night duty, his own proper quarters being
nearly a mile away. Alongside the shed was a very rough stable
that would accommodate a horse or two, and the back wall was a
mere partition of mud brick, behind which, under a thatched roof,
were tethered some of the maharajah's elephants. There were two
windows in the wall, through which one could see dimly the great
brutes' rumps as they swayed at their pickets restlessly. The
smell came through a broken pane, and every once in a while the
Blaines' horse, standing ready in the shafts outside with a
blanket over him, squealed at it indignantly.</p>

<p>Tom's horse dozed in the rough shed, being used to
elephants.</p>

<p>Dick got up once or twice to peer through the window at the
brutes.</p>

<p>"Are they tethered fore and aft?" he wondered.</p>

<p>"No," Tom answered. "One hind foot only."</p>

<p>"What's to stop them from turning round and breaking down this
rotten wall?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;except that they're elephants. They could break
their picket chains if they were minded to, same as I could break
Gungadhura's head and lose my job. But I won't do it, and nor
will they. They're elephants, and I'm a soldier. The trouble with
you is nerves, my boy. Have some brandy. You're worried about
your wife, but I tell you she's right as a trivet. I'd trust my
last chance with that little princess. I've done it often.
Brandy's the stuff to keep your hair on. Have some."</p>

<p>The bottle had only been three parts full. Tom poured out the
last of it and set a stone jorum of rum in readiness on the table
over against the wall.</p>

<p>"Wish we had hot water handy," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"Which of the elephants are tethered here?" asked Dick. "That
big one that killed a tiger in the arena the other day?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did you see that? Akbar was scarcely scratched. Quickest
thing ever I saw&mdash;squealed with rage the minute they turned
'stripes' loose &mdash;chased him to the wall&mdash;downed him
with a forefoot and crushed him into tiger jelly before you could
say British Constitution!"</p>

<p>"I guess that tiger had been kept in a cage too long," said
Dick.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it. He was fighting fit. But they'd given
old Akbar a skinful of rum, and that turns him into a holy
terror. He's quite quiet other times."</p>

<p>Dick looked at his watch. Tess had been in the palace about
three hours, and he was confident she would come away as soon as
possible, if for no other reason than to put an end to his
anxiety. She was likely to appear at the gate at any minute. At
any minute Tom Tripe was likely to attack the jorum, and if
present symptoms went for anything, it would not take much of it
to make him worse than useless. At present he was growing
reminiscent.</p>

<p>"Once old Akbar had a belly-ache and they gave him arak. They
didn't catch him for two days! He pulled up his picket-stake and
lit out for the horizon, chasing dogs and hens and monkeys and
anything else be could find that annoyed him. Screamed like a
locomotive. Horrid sight!"</p>

<p>"Where does this road outside lead to?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Don't lead anywhere. Blind alley. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing."</p>

<p>Dick was examining the wall between the shed they sat in and
the stable-place next door. It was much stronger than the mud
affair between them and the elephants. Tom Tripe had nearly
finished his tumbler-full, and there was madness in the air that
night that made a man take awfully long chances.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose a man could lose his way in the dark between
here and the palace gate?"</p>

<p>"Not even if he was as drunk as Noah. All he'd have to do 'ud
be hold on to the wall and walk forward. The road turns a corner,
but the walls are all blind and there's no other way but past the
palace. You sit here, though, my boy. No need to try that. Your
wife's all right."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe I'd better stay here."</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I could back the dog-cart into the shed where
your horse is? I hardly like to leave my horse standing any
longer in the open, yet he's better in the shafts in case we want
him in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Yes, the door's wide enough."</p>

<p>"Then I'll do it."</p>

<p>"Suit yourself. But take some of that rum before you go
outside. The night air's bad for your lungs. Help yourself and
pass the bottle, as the Queen said to the Archbishop of
Canterbury."</p>

<p>"All right, I will."</p>

<p>Dick poured a little on his handkerchief, thrust the
handkerchief through the broken pane and waved it violently to
spread the smell. It was cheap, immodest stuff, blatant with its
own advertisement. Then he set the jorum down on the end of the
table farthest from the wall, to the best of his judgment out of
reach from the window.</p>

<p>"Come along, Tom," he said then. "Help me with the horse."</p>

<p>"What's your hurry? Take a drink first."</p>

<p>"No, let's take one together afterward."</p>

<p>He took Tom by the shoulder and pushed him to his feet.</p>

<p>"The horse might break away. Come on, man, hurry!"</p>

<p>Over his shoulder Dick could see a long trunk nosing its way
gingerly through the broken pane and searching out the source of
the alluring smell. He pushed Tripe along in front of him, and
together they backed the dog-cart into the stable-place, making a
very clumsy business of it for three reasons: Tom Tripe was none
too sober: the horse was nearly crazy with fear of the uncanny
brutes just beyond the wall; and Dick was in too much hurry for
reasons of his own. However, they got horse and cart in backward,
and the door shut before the crash came.</p>

<p>The crash was of a falling mud-brick wall, pushed outward by
the shoulders of a pachyderm that wanted alcohol. The beast had
had it out of all sorts of containers and knew the trick of
emptying the last drop. The jorum was about his usual dose.</p>

<p>About two minutes later, while Dick and Tom Tripe between them
held a horse in intolerable durance between the shafts, and Tom's
horse out of sympathy kicked out at random into every shadow he
could reach, the door and part of the wall of Tom's shed fell
outward into the pitch dark street as Akbar, eleven feet four
inches at the shoulder, strode forward conjecturing what worlds
were yet to conquer. The other elephants stood motionless at
their pickets. A terrified mahout emerged through the debris like
a devil from bell's bunkers, calling to his elephant all the
endearing epithets he knew, and cursing him alternately. The
horses grew calmer and submitted to caresses, like children and
all creatures that have intimate contact with strong men; and
presently the night grew still.</p>

<p>"D'you suppose that brute swiped my liquor?" wondered Tom
Tripe. "You mind the horses while I look."</p>

<p>But suddenly there was a savage noise of trumpeting up-street,
followed by a bark and a yelp of canine terror.</p>

<p>"God!" swore Tom. "That's Trotters coming to fetch us! Akbar's
chasing him back this way! Hang on to the horse like ten men!
I'll go see!"</p>

<p>He was outside before Dick could remonstrate. Between them
they had lashed the dog-cart wheels during the first panic, but
even so Dick had his hands full, as the trumpeting drew nearer
and the horse went into agonies of senseless fear. It was a
fight, nothing less, between thinking man and mere instinctive
beast, and eventually Dick threw him with a trick of the reins
about his legs, and knelt on his head to keep him down. By the
grace of the powers of unexpectedness neither shafts nor harness
broke.</p>

<p>Outside in the darkness Tom Tripe peered through brandied eyes
at a great shadow that hunted to and fro a hundred yards away,
chasing something that was quite invisible, and making enough
noise about it to awake the dead.</p>

<p>"Trotters!" he yelled. "Trotters!"</p>

<p>A moment later a smaller shadow came into view at top speed,
panting, chased hotly by the bigger one.</p>

<p>"Trotters! Get back where you came from! Back, d'ye hear me!
Back!"</p>

<p>Within ten yards of his master the dog stopped to do his
thinking, and the elephant screamed with a sort of hunter's
ecstasy as he closed on him with a rush. But thought is swift,
and obedience good judgment. The dog doubled of a sudden between
Akbar's legs and the elephant slid on his rump in the futile
effort to turn after him&mdash;then crashed into the wall
opposite Tripe's dismantled shed&mdash;cannoned off it with a
grunt of sheer disgust&mdash; and set off up-street, once more in
hot pursuit.</p>

<p>"That brute got my good rum, damn him!" said Tom, opening the
stable door. "Hello! Horse down? Any harm done? Right-oh! We'll
soon have him up again. Better hurry now&mdash;Trotters came for
us."</p> <hr> <br>

<p class="first">WITHIN the palace Tess was reveling in
vaudeville In the first place, Yasmini had no Western views on
modesty. Whatever her mother may have taught her in that respect
had gone the way of all the other handicaps she saw fit to throw
into the discard, or to retain for use solely when she saw there
was advantage. The East uses dress for ornament, and understands
its use. The veil is for places where men might look with too
bold eyes and covet. Out of sight of privileged men prudery has
no place, and almost no advocates all the way from Peshawar to
Cape Comorin.</p>

<p>And Yasmini had loved dancing since the days when she tottered
her first steps for her mother's and Bubru Singh's delight. Long
before an American converted the Russian Royal Ballet, and the
Russian Royal Ballet in return took all the theater-going West by
storm&mdash;scandalizing, then amazing, then educating bit by
bit&mdash;Yasmini had developed her own ideas and brought them by
arduous practise to something near perfection. To that her
strength, agility and sinuous grace were largely due; and she
practiced no deceptions on herself, but valued all three
qualities for their effect on other people, keeping no light
under a bushel.</p>

<p>The consciousness of that night's climactic quality raised her
spirits to the point where they were irrepressible, and she
danced her garments off one by one, using each in turn as a foil
for her art until there was nothing left with which to multiply
rhythm and she danced before the long French mirrors yet more
gracefully with nothing on at all.</p>

<p>Getting Tess disrobed was a different matter. She did not own
to much prudery, but the maids' eyes were over-curious. And,
lacking, as she knew she did, Yasmini's ability to justify
nakedness by poetry of motion, she hid behind a curtain and was
royally laughed at for her pains. But she was satisfied to retain
that intangible element that is best named dignity, and let the
laughter pass unchallenged. Yasmini, with her Eastern heritage,
could be dignified as well as beautiful as nature made her. Not
so Tess, or at any rate she thought not, and what one thinks is
after all the only gage acceptable.</p>

<p>Then came the gorgeous fun of putting on Tess's clothes, each
to be danced in as its turn came, and made fun of, so that Tess
herself began to believe all Western clothes were awkward,
idiotic things&mdash;until Yasmini stood clothed complete at
last, with her golden hair all coiled under a Paris hat, and
looked as lovely that way as any. The two women were almost
exactly the same size. Even the shoes fitted, and when Yasmini
walked the length of the room with Tess's very stride and
attitude Tess got her first genuine glimpse of herself as
another's capably critical eyes saw her&mdash;a priceless
experience, and not so humiliating after all.</p>

<p>They dressed up Tess in man's clothes&mdash;a young
Rajput's&mdash;a suit Yasmini had worn on one of her wild
excursions, and what with the coiled turban of yellow silk and a
little black mustache adjusted by cunning fingers she felt as
happy as a child in fancy dress. But she found it more difficult
to imitate the Rajput walk than Yasmini did to copy her tricks of
carriage. For a few minutes they played at walking together up
and down the room before the mirror, applauded by the giggling
maids. But then suddenly came anti-climax. There was a great
hammering at the outer door, and one of the maids ran down to
investigate, while they waited in breathless silence.</p>

<p>The news the maid brought back was the worst imaginable. The
look-out at the northern corner of the wall (Yasmini kept watch
on her captors as rigorously as they spied on her) had run with
the word to the gate-man that Gungadhura himself was coming with
three eunuchs, all four on foot.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as the breathless girl could break that evil
tidings there came another hammering, and this time Hasamurti
went down to answer. Her news was worse. Gungadhura was at the
outer gate demanding admission, and threatening to order the
guard to break the gate in if refused.</p>

<p>"What harm can he do?" demanded Tess. "He won't dare try any
violence in front of me. Let us change clothes again."</p>

<p>Yasmini laughed at her.</p>

<p>"A prince on a horse may ride from harm," she answered. "When
princes walk, let other folk 'ware trouble! He comes to have his
will on me. Those eunuchs are the leash that always hunt with him
by night. They will manhandle you, too, if they once get in, and
Gungadhura will take his chance of trouble afterward. The guard
dare not refuse him."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" Tess wondered. "Can we hide?" Then,
pulling herself together for the sake of her race and her Western
womanhood: "If we make noise enough at the gate my husband will
come. We're all right."</p>

<p>"If there are any gods at all," said Yasmini piously, "they
will consider our plight. I think this is a vengeance on me
because I said I will leave my maids behind. I will not leave
them! Hasamurti&mdash;you and the others make ready for the
street!"</p>

<p>That was a simple matter. In three minutes all five women were
back in the room, veiled from head to foot. But the hammering at
the front door was repeated, louder than before. Tess wondered
whether to hope that the risaldar of the guard had already
reported to Gungadhura the lady doctor's visit, or to hope that
he had not.</p>

<p>"We will all go down together now," Yasmini decided, and
promptly she started to lead the way alone. But Hasamurti sprang
to her side, and insisted with tears on disguising herself as her
mistress and staying behind to provide one slim chance for the
rest to escape.</p>

<p>"In the dark you will pass for the memsahib," she urged. "The
memsahib will pass for a man. Wait by the gate until the
maharajah enters, while I stand at the door under the lamp as a
decoy. I will run into the house, and he will follow with the
eunuchs, while the rest of you slip out through the gate, and run
before the guard can close it. Perhaps one, at least, of the
other maids had better stay with me."</p>

<p>A second maid volunteered, but Yasmini would have none of that
plan. First and last the great outstanding difference between her
and the ordinary run of conspirators, Western or Eastern, was
unwillingness to sacrifice faithful friends even in a
pinch&mdash;although she could be ruthlessness itself toward
half-hearted ones. Both those habits grew on her as she grew
older.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the little curtained outer hall the
maids were on the verge of hysteria. Tess had herself well in
control, and was praying busily that her husband might only be
near enough to hear the racket at the gate. She was willing to be
satisfied with that, and to ask no further favors of Providence,
unless that Dick should have Tom Tripe with him. Outwardly calm
enough, she could not for the life of her remember to stride like
a man. Yasmini turned more than once to rally her about it.</p>

<p>Yasmini herself looked unaccountably meek in the Western
dress, but her blue eyes blazed with fury and she walked with
confidence, issuing her orders in a level voice. The gate-man had
come to the door again to announce that Gungadhura had issued a
final warning. Two more minutes and the outer gate should be
burst in by his orders.</p>

<p>"Tell the maharajah sahib that I come in person to welcome
him!" she retorted, and the gate-man hurried back into the dark
toward his post.</p>

<p>There were no lights at the outer gate. One could only guess
how the stage was set&mdash;the maharajah hooded lest some enemy
recognize him&mdash; the eunuchs behind him with cords concealed
under their loose outer garments &mdash;and the guard at a
respectful distance standing at attention. There was not a
maharajah's sepoy in Sialpore who would have dared remonstrate
with Gungadhura in dark or daylight.</p>

<p>Only as they passed under the yellow light shed by the
solitary lantern on the iron bracket did Tess get an inkling of
Yasmini's plan. Light glinted on the wrought hilt of a long
Italian dagger, and her smile was cold&mdash;
uncompromising&mdash;shuddersome.</p>

<p>Tess objected instantly. "Didn't you promise you'd kill
nobody? If we'd a pistol we could fire it in the air and my
husband would come in a minute."</p>

<p>"How do we know that Gungadhura hasn't killed your husband, or
shut him up somewhere?" Yasmini answered, and Tess had an attack
of cold chills that rendered her speechless for a moment. She
threw it off with a prodigious effort.</p>

<p>"But I've no weapon of any kind, and you can't kill
Gungadhura, three eunuchs and the guard as well!" she argued
presently.</p>

<p>"Wait and see what I will do!" was the only answer.
"Gungadhura caused my pistols to be stolen. But the darkness is
our friend, and I think the gods &mdash;if there are any
gods&mdash;are going to assist us."</p>

<p>They walked to the gate in a little close-packed group, and
found the gate-man stuttering through the small square hole
provided for interviews with strangers, telling the maharajah for
the third or fourth time that the princess herself was coming.
Gungadhura's voice was plainly audible, growling threats from the
outer darkness.</p>

<p>"Stand aside!" Yasmini ordered. "I will attend to the talking
now."</p>

<p>She went close to the square hole, but was careful to keep her
face in shadow at the left-hand side of it.</p>

<p>"What can His Highness, Gungadhura Singh, want with his
relative at this strange hour?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Open the gate!" came the answer. He was very close to
it&mdash;ready to push with his shoulder the instant the bolt was
drawn, for black passion had him in hand. But in the darkness he
was as invisible as she was.</p>

<p>"Nay, how shall I know it is Gungadhura Singh?"</p>

<p>"Ask the guard! Ho, there! Tell her who it is demands
admission!"</p>

<p>"Nay, they might lie to me! The voice sounds strange. I would
open for Gungadhura Singh; but I must be sure it is he and no
other."</p>

<p>"Look then!" he answered, and thrust his dark face close to
the opening.</p>

<p>Even the utterly base have intuition. Nothing else warned him.
In the very nick of time he stepped back, and Yasmini's long
dagger that shot forward like a stab of lightning only cut the
cheek beneath the eye, and slit it to the corner of his
mouth.</p>

<p>The blood poured down into his beard and added fury to
determination.</p>

<p>"Guards, break in the gate!" he shouted, and Yasmini stood
back in the darkest shadow, about as dangerous as a cobra
guarding young ones. With her left hand she signed to all six
women to hide themselves; but Tess came and stood beside her,
minded in that minute to give Gungadhura Western aftermath to
reckon with as well as the combined present courage of two women.
Wondering desperately what she could do to help against armed men
she suddenly snatched one of the long hat-pins that she herself
had adjusted in her own hat on Yasmini's head.</p>

<p>Yasmini hugged her close and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Better than sister! Better than friend!" she whispered.</p>

<p>Gungadhura had not been idle while he waited for his message
to reach Yasmini, but had sent some of the guard to find a baulk
of timber for a battering-ram. The butts of rifles would have
been useless against that stout iron.</p>

<p>The gate shook now under the weight of the first assault, but
the guards were handling the timber clumsily, not using their
strength together. Gungadhura cursed them, and spent two valuable
minutes trying to show them how the trick should be worked, the
blood that poured into his beard, and made of his mouth a
sputtering crimson mess, not helping to make his raging orders
any more intelligible.</p>

<p>Presently the second crash came, stronger and more elastic
than the first. The iron bent inward, and it was plainly only a
matter of minutes before the bolt would go. The gate-man came
creeping to Yasmini's side, and, with yellow fangs showing in a
grin meant to be affectionate, displayed an Afghan tulwar.</p>

<p>"Ismail!" she said. "I thought you were afraid and ran to
hide!"</p>

<p>"Nay!" he answered. "My life is thine, Princess! Gungadhura
took away all weapons, but this I hid. I went to find it. See,"
he grinned, feeling the edge with his thumb, "it is clean! It is
keen! It will cut throats!"</p>

<p>"I will not forget!" Yasmini answered, but the words were lost
in the din of the third blow of wood on iron.</p>

<p>The odds began not to look so bad&mdash;two desperate women
and a faithful Northern fighting man armed with a weapon that he
loved and understood, against a wounded blackguard and three
eunuchs. Perhaps the guard might look on and not interfere. There
was a chance to make a battle royal of it, whose tumult would
bring Dick Blaine and Tom Tripe to the rescue. What was the dog
doing? Tess wondered whether any animal could be so intelligent
after all as Tom pretended his was. Perhaps the maharajah had
seen the dog and killed him.</p>

<p>"Listen!" she urged. "Tell your maids to stampede for the
street the instant the door breaks in. That will give the guard
their work to do to hold them. Meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thump!" came the timber on the gate again, and even the
hinges shook in their stone setting.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Yasmini.</p>

<p>There was another noise up-street&mdash;a rushing to and fro,
and a trumpeting that no one could mistake.</p>

<p>"I said that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thump!" came the baulk of timber&mdash;not so powerfully as
before. There was distraction affecting the team-work. The scream
of an elephant fighting mad, and the yelp of a dog, that pierces
every other noise, rent the darkness close at hand.</p>

<p>"I said that the gods&mdash;"</p>

<p>There came the thud of a very heavy body colliding with a
wall, and another blood-curdling scream of rage&mdash;then the
thunder of what might have been an avalanche as part of a near-by
wall collapsed, and a brute as big as Leviathan approached at top
speed.</p>

<p>There was another thud, but this time caused by the hulk of
timber falling on the ground, as guard, eunuchs and Gungadhura
all took to their heels.</p>

<p>"Allah! Il hamdul illah!"* swore the gate-man.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Thanks be to   Allah! ]</p>

<p>"I said that the gods would help tonight!" Yasmini cried
exultantly.</p>

<p>"O Lord, what has happened to Dick?" groaned Tess between set
teeth.</p>

<p>The thunder of pursuit drew nearer. Possessed by some instinct
she never offered to explain, Yasmini stepped to the gate, drew
back the bolt, and opened it a matter of inches. In shot Tom
Tripe's dog, with his tongue hanging out and the fear of devils
blazing in his eyes. Yasmini slammed the gate again in the very
face of a raging elephant, and shot the bolt in the nick of time
to take the shock of his impact.</p>

<p>It was only a charge in half-earnest or he would have brought
the gate down. An elephant is a very short-sighted beast, and it
was pitch-dark. He could not believe that a dog could disappear
through a solid iron gate, and after testing the obstruction for
a moment or two, grumbling to himself angrily, he stood to smell
the air and listen. There was a noise farther along the street of
a stampede of some kind. That was likely enough his quarry,
probably frightening other undesirables along in front of him.
With a scream of mingled frenzy and delight he went off at once
full pelt.</p>

<p>"Oh, Trotters! Good dog, Trotters!" sobbed Tess, kneeling down
to make much of him, and giving way to the reaction that
overcomes men as well as women. "Where's your master? Oh, if you
could tell me where my husband is!"</p>

<p>She did not have long to wait for the answer to that. It took
the two men a matter of seconds to get the horse on his feet, and
no fire-engine ever left the station house one fraction faster
than Dick tooled that dog-cart. The horse was all nerves and in
no mood to wait on ceremony, which accounted for a broken spoke
and a fragment of the gate-post hanging in the near wheel. They
forgot to unlash the wheels before they started, so the dog-cart
came up-street on skids, as it were, screaming holy murder on the
granite flags &mdash;which in turn saved the near wheel from
destruction. It also made it possible to rein in the terrified
horse exactly in front of the palace gate; another proof that as
Yasmini said, the gods of India were in a mood to help that
night. (Not that she ever believed the gods are one bit more
consequential than men.)</p>

<p>Yasmini drew the bolt, and the gate creaked open reluctantly;
the shock of the elephant's shoulder had about ended its present
stage of usefulness. Tom Tripe, dismounting from his horse in a
hurry and throwing the reins over the dog-cart lamp, was first to
step through.</p>

<p>"Where's my dog?" he demanded. "Where's that Trotters o' mine?
Did Akbar get him?"</p>

<p>A cold nose thrust in his hand was the answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, so there you are, you rascal! There&mdash;lie down!"</p>

<p>That was all the ceremonial that passed between them, but the
dog seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>Tess was out through the gate almost sooner than Tom Tripe
could enter it. They brushed each other's shoulders as they
passed. Up in the dog-cart she and her husband laughed in each
other's arms, each at the other's disguise, neither of them with
the slightest notion what would happen next, except that Dick
knew the dog-cart wheels would have to be unlashed.</p>

<p>"How many people will the carriage hold?" Yasmini called to
them, appearing suddenly in the lamp-light. And Dick Blaine began
laughing all over again, for except for the golden hair she
looked so like the wife who sat on his left hand, and his wife so
like a Rajput that the humor of the situation was its only
obvious feature.</p>

<p>"I must not take my carriage, for they would trace it, and
besides, there is too little time. Can we all ride in your
carriage? There are six of us."</p>

<p>"Probably. But where to?" Dick answered.</p>

<p>"I will direct. Ismail must come too, but he can run."</p>

<p>It was an awful crowd, for the dog-cart was built for four
people at the most, and in the end Tess insisted on riding behind
Tom Tripe because she was dressed like a man and could do it
easily. Ismail was sent back to close the gate from the inside
and clamber out over the top of it. There was just room for a
lean and agile man to squeeze between the iron and the stone
arch.</p>

<p>"Let the watchmen who feared and hid themselves stay to give
their own account to Gungadhura!" Yasmini sneered scornfully.
"They are no longer men of mine!"</p>

<p>"Now, where away?" demanded Dick, giving the horse his head.
"To my house? You'll be safe there for the present."</p>

<p>"No. They might trace us there."</p>

<p>Yasmini was up beside him, wedged tightly between him and
Hasamurti, so like his own wife, except for a vague Eastern scent
she used, that he could not for the life of him speak to her as a
stranger.</p>

<p>"Listen!" she said excitedly. "I had horses here, there,
everywhere in case of need. But Gungadhura sent men and took them
all. Now I have only one horse&mdash;in your stable&mdash;I must
get that tonight. First, then, drive my women to a place that I
will show you."</p>

<p>Away in the distance they could hear the trumpeting of Akbar,
and the shouts of men who had been turned out to attempt the
hopeless task of capturing the brute. At each scream the horse
trembled in the shafts and had to be managed skillfully, but the
load was too heavy now for him to run away with it.</p>

<p>"If that elephant will continue to be our friend and will only
run the other way for a distraction, so that we are not seen, one
of these days I will give him a golden howdah!" vowed
Yasmini.</p>

<p>And Akbar did that very thing. Whoever was awake that night in
Sialpore, and was daring enough to venture in the dark streets,
followed the line of destruction and excitement, gloating over
the broken property of enemies or awakening friends to make them
miserable with condolences. The dog-cart threaded through the
streets unseen, for even the scarce night-watchmen left their
posts to take part in the hunt.</p>

<p>Yasmini guided them to the outskirts of the town in a line as
nearly straight as the congenital deviousness of Sialpore's
ancient architects allowed. There was not a street but turned a
dozen times to the mile. At one point she bade Dick stop, and
begged Tess to let Tom Tripe take her home, promising to see her
again within the hour. But Tess had recovered her nerve and was
determined to see the adventure through, in spite of the
discomforts of a seat behind Tom's military saddle.</p>

<p>They brought up at last in front of a low dark house at the
very edge of the city. It stood by itself in a compound, with
fields behind it, and looked prosperous enough to belong to one
of the maharajah's suite.</p>

<p>"The house of Mukhum Dass!" Yasmini announced.</p>

<p>"The money-lender?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Dick made a wry face, for the man's extortions were notorious.
But Yasmini never paused to cast up virtue when she needed
assistants in a hurry; rather she was adept at appraising
character and bending it to suit her ends. Ismail, hot and out of
breath from running at the cart-tail, was sent to pound the
money-lender's door, until that frightened individual came down
himself to inquire (with the door well held by a short chain)
what the matter was.</p>

<p>"I lend no money in the night!" was his form of greeting. He
always used it when gamblers came to him in the heat of the
loser's passion at unearthly hours&mdash;and sometimes ended by
making a loan at very high interest on sound security. Otherwise
he would have stayed in bed, whatever the thunderous
importunity.</p>

<p>Yasmini was down at the door by that time, and it was she who
answered.</p>

<p>"Nay, but men win lawsuits by gathering evidence! Are
title-deeds not legal in the dark?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded, reaching backward for a little
lamp that hung on the wall behind him and trying to see her
face.</p>

<p>"I am the same who met you that morning on the hilltop and
purchased silence from you at a price."</p>

<p>He peered through the narrow opening, holding the lamp above
his head.</p>

<p>"That was a man. You are a woman."</p>

<p>For answer to that she stood on tiptoe and blew the lamp out.
He would have slammed the door, but her foot was in the way.</p>

<p>"By dark or daylight, Mukhum Dass, your eyes read nothing but
the names on hundis! Now, what does the car say? Does the voice
tell nothing?"</p>

<p>"Aye, it is the same."</p>

<p>"You shall have that title-deed tomorrow at dawn&mdash;on
certain terms."</p>

<p>"How do I know?"</p>

<p>"Because I say it&mdash;I, who said that Chamu would repay his
son's loan,&mdash;I, who knew from the first all about the
title-deed,&mdash;I, who know where it is this minute,&mdash;I,
who know the secrets of Jinendra's priest,&mdash;I, whose name
stands written on the hundred-rupee note with which the butler
paid his son's debt!"</p>

<p>"The princess! The Princess Yasmini! It was her name on the
note!"</p>

<p>"Her name is mine!"</p>

<p>The money-lender stood irresolutely, shifting his balance from
foot to foot. It was his experience that when people with
high-born names came to him by night mysteriously there was
always profit in it for himself. And then, there was that
title-deed. He had bought the house cheap, but its present value
was five times what he gave for it. Its loss would mean more to
him than the loss of a wife to some men&mdash;as Yasmini knew,
and counted on.</p>

<p>"Open the door and let me in, Mukhum Dass! The terms are
these&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Nay, we can talk with the door between us."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, lose thy title-deed! Dhulap Singh, thine
enemy, shall have it within the hour!"</p>

<p>She took her foot out from the door and turned away briskly.
Promptly he opened the door wide, and called after her.</p>

<p>"Nay, come, we will discuss it."</p>

<p>"I discuss nothing!" she answered with a laugh. "I dictate
terms!"</p>

<p>"Name them, then."</p>

<p>"I have here five women. They must stay in safety in your
house until an hour before dawn."</p>

<p>"God forbid!"</p>

<p>"Until an hour before dawn, you hear me? If any come to
inquire for them or me, you must deny any knowledge."</p>

<p>"That I would be sure enough to do! Shall I have it said that
Mukhum Dass keeps a dozen women in his dotage?"</p>

<p>"An hour before dawn I will come for them."</p>

<p>"None too soon!"</p>

<p>"Then I will write a letter to a certain man, who, on
presentation of the letter, will hand you the title-deed at once
without payment."</p>

<p>"A likely tale!"</p>

<p>"Was it a likely tale that Chamu would repay his son's
debt?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I will take the hazard. Bring them in. But I will
not feed them. And if you fail to come for them before dawn I
will turn them out and it shall be all over Sialpore that the
Princess Yasmini&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment, Mukhum Dass! If one word of this escapes your
lips for a month to come, you shall go to jail for receiving
stolen money in payment of a debt! My name was on the money that
Chamu paid you with. You knew he stole it."</p>

<p>"I did not know!"</p>

<p>"Prove that in court, then!"</p>

<p>"Bring the women in!" he grumbled. "I am no cackler from the
roofs!"</p>

<p>Yasmini did not wait for him to change his mind but shepherded
her scared dependents through the door, and called for
Ismail.</p>

<p>"Did you see these women enter?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Aye. I saw. Have I not eyes?"</p>

<p>"Stay thou here outside and watch. Afterward, remember, if I
say nothing, be thou dumb as Tom Tripe's dog. But if I give the
word, tell all Sialpore that Mukhum Dass is a satyr who holds
revels in his house by night. Bring ten other men to swear to it
with thee, until the very children of the streets shout it after
him when he rides his rounds! Hast thou understood? Silence for
silence! But talk for talk! Hast thou heard, too, Mukhum Dass?
Good! Shut thy door tight, but thy mouth yet tighter! And try
rather to take liberties with hornets than with those five
women!"</p>

<p>Before he could answer she was gone, leaving Ismail lurking in
the shadows. Tess had dismounted from behind Tom Tripe and
climbed up beside her husband so that there were three on the
front seat again.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom Tripe!" Yasmini ordered, speaking with the voice of
command that Tom himself would have used to a subordinate. "Do
you as the elephant did, and cause distraction. Draw Gungadhura
off the scent!"</p>

<p>"Hell's bells, deary me, Your Ladyship!" he answered. "All the
drawing I'll do after this night's work will be my last month's
pay, and lucky if I see that! Lordy knows what the guard'll tell
the maharajah, nor what his rage'll add to it!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Gungadhura and the guard ran from the elephant like
dust before the wind. The guards are the better men, and will be
back at their post before this; but Gungadhura must find a
discreet physician to bind a slit face for him! Visit the guard
now, and get their ear first. Tell them Gungadhura wants no talk
about tonight's work. Then come to Blaine sahib's house and
search the cellar by lamplight, letting Chamu the butler see you
do it, but taking care not to let him see what you see. What you
do see, leave where it lies! Then see Gungadhura early in the
morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lordy me, Your Ladyship, he'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, he won't. He'll want to know how much you know about his
behavior at the gate. Tell him you know everything, and that
you've compelled the guard to keep silence. That ought to
reconcile the coward! But if he threatens you, then threaten him!
Threaten to go to Samson sahib with the whole story. (But if you
do dare really go to Samson sahib, never look me in the face
again!) Then tell Gungadhura that you searched the cellar, and
what you saw there under a stone, adding that Blaine sahib was
suspicious, and watched you, and afterward sealed the cellar
door. Have you understood me?"</p>

<p>"I understand there's precious little sleep for me tonight,
and hell in the morning!"</p>

<p>"Pouf! Are you a soldier?"</p>

<p>"I'm your ladyship's most thorough-paced admirer and obedient
slave!" Tom answered gallantly, his mutton-chop whiskers fairly
bristling with a grin.</p>

<p>"Prove it, then, this night!"</p>

<p>"As if I hadn't! Well&mdash;all's well, Your Ladyship, I'm on
the job! Crib, crupper and breakfast-time, yours truly!"</p>

<p>"When you have finished interviewing Gungadhura, find for
Blaine sahib a new cook and a new butler, who can be trusted not
to poison him!"</p>

<p>"If I can!"</p>

<p>"Of course you can find them! Tell Sita Ram, Samson sahib's
babu, what is wanted. He will find men in one hour who have too
much honor, and too little brains, and too great fear to poison
any one! Say that I require it of him. Have your understood? Then
go! Go swiftly to the guard and stop their tongues!"</p>

<p>Tom whistled his dog and rode off at a canter. Dick gave the
horse his head and drove home as fast as the steepness of the
hill permitted, Yasmini talking to him nearly all the way.</p>

<p>"You must dismiss Chamu," she insisted. "He is Gungadhura's
man, and the cook is under the heel of Chamu. Either man would
poison his own mother for a day's pay! Send them both about their
business the first thing in the morning if you value your life!
Before they go, let them see you put a great lock on the cellar
door, and nail it as well, and put weights on it! If men come at
any time to pry about the house, ask Samson sahib for a special
policeman to guard the place!"</p>

<p>"But what is all this leading to?" demanded Dick. "What does
it mean?"</p>

<p>"It means," she said slowly, "that the toils are closing in on
Gungadhura!"</p>

<p>"The way I figure it," he answered, "some one else had a
pretty narrow shave tonight!"</p>

<p>Yasmini knew better than to threaten Dick, or even to argue
with him vehemently, much less give him orders. But each man has
a line of least resistance.</p>

<p>"Your wife has told you what Gungadhura attempted?" she asked
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, while you were at the money-lender's&mdash;something of
it."</p>

<p>"If the guard should tell Gungadhura that your wife was in the
palace with me and could give evidence against him, what do you
suppose Gungadhura would do?"</p>

<p>"Damn him!" Dick murmured.</p>

<p>"There are so many
ways&mdash;snakes&mdash;poison&mdash;daggers in the
dark&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you suggest?" he asked her. "Leave Sialpore?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but with me! I know a safe place. She should come with
me."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Tonight! Before dawn."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By camel. I had horses and Gungadhura took them all, but his
brain was too sotted to think of camels, and I have camels
waiting not many miles from here! I shall take my horse from your
stable and ride for the camels, bringing them to the house of
Mukhum Dass. Let your wife meet me there one hour before
dawn."</p>

<p>"Dick!" said Tess, with her arm around him. "I want to go! I
know it sounds crazy, and absurd, and desperate; but I'm sure it
isn't! I want you to let me go with her."</p>

<p>They reached the house before he answered, he, turning it over
and over in his mind, taking into reckoning a thousand
things.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, "once in a while there's the strength
of a man about you, Tess. Maybe I'm a lunatic, but have it your
own way, girl, have it your own way!"</p> <hr> <br>

<p class="first">SOME of what follows presently was told to
Yasmini afterward by Sita Ram, some of it by Tom Tripe, and a
little by Dick Blaine, who had it from Samson himself. The rest
she pieced together from admissions by Jinendra's fat priest and
the gossip of some dancing girls.</p>

<p>Sir Roland Samson, K.C.S.I., as told already, was a very demon
for swift office work, routine pouring off him into the hands of
the right subordinates like water into the runnels of a roof,
leaving him free to bask in the sunshine of self-complacency. But
there is work that can not be tackled, or even touched by
subordinates; and, the fixed belief of envious inferiors to the
contrary notwithstanding, there are hours unpaid for, unincluded
in the office schedule, and wholly unadvertised that hold such
people as commissioners in durance vile.</p>

<p>On the night of Yasmini's escape Samson sat sweating in his
private room, with moths of a hundred species irritating him by
noisy self-immolation against the oil lamp-whose smoke made
matters worse by being sucked up at odd moments by the punkah,
pulled jerkily by a new man. Most aggravating circumstance of
all, perhaps, was that the movement of the punkah flickered his
papers away whenever he removed a weight. Yet he could not study
them unless he spread them all in front of him; and without the
punkah he felt he would die of apoplexy. He had to reach a
decision before midnight.</p>

<p>Babu Sita Ram was supposed to be sitting under a punkah in the
next room, with a locked door between him and his master. He was
staying late, by special request and as a special favor, to copy
certain very important but not too secret documents in time for
the courier next day. There were just as many insects to annoy
him, and the punkah flapped his papers too; but fat though he
was, and sweat though he did, his smile was the smile of a
hunter. From time to time he paused from copying, stole silently
to the door between the offices, gingerly removed a loose knot
from a panel, and clapped to the hole first one, and then the
other avidious brown eye.</p>

<p>Samson wished to goodness there was some one he dared consult
with. There were other Englishmen, of course, but they were all
ambitious like himself. He felt that his prospects were at stake.
News had reached the State Department (by channels Sita Ram could
have uncovered for him) that Gungadhura was intriguing with
tribes beyond the northwest frontier.</p>

<p>The tribes were too far away to come in actual touch with
Sialpore, although they were probably too wild and childish to
appreciate that fact. The point was that Gungadhura was said to
be promising them armed assistance from the British
rear&mdash;assistance that he never would possibly be able to
render them; and his almost certain intention was, when the
rising should materialize, to offer his small forces to the
British as an inexpensive means of quelling the disturbance, thus
restoring his own lost credit and double-crossing all concerned.
A subtle motive, subtly suspected.</p>

<p>It was no new thing in the annals of Indian state affairs, nor
anything to get afraid about; but what the State Department
desired to know was, why Sir Roland Samson, K. C. S. I., was not
keeping a closer eye on Gungadhura, what did he propose as the
least troublesome and quietest solution, and would he kindly
answer by return.</p>

<p>All that was bad enough, because a "beau ideal commissioner"
rather naturally feels distressed when information of that sort
goes over his head or under his feet to official superiors. But
he could have got around it. It should not have been very
difficult to write a report that would clear himself and give him
time to turn around.</p>

<p>But that very evening no less an individual than the high
priest of Jinendra had sent word by Sita Ram that he craved the
favor of an interview.</p>

<p>"And," had added Sita Ram with malicious delight, "it is about
the treasure of Sialpore and certain claims to it that I think he
wants to see you."</p>

<p>"Why should he come by night?" demanded Samson.</p>

<p>"Because his errand is a secret one," announced the babu, with
a hand on his stomach as if he had swallowed something
exquisite.</p>

<p>So Samson was in a quandary, going over secret records getting
ready for an issue with the priest. His report had to be ready by
morning, yet he hardly dared begin it without knowing what the
priest might have in mind; and on his own intricate knowledge of
the situation might depend whether or not he could extract, from
a man more subtle than himself, information on which to base
sound proposals to his government. His reputation was decidedly
at stake; and dangerous intrigue was in the air, or else the
priest would never be coming to visit him.</p>

<p>Sita Ram kept peeping at him through the knot-hole, as a cook
peers at a tit-bit in the oven, to judge whether it is properly
cooked yet.</p>

<p>Jinendra's priest had had time for reflection. True to his
kidney, he trusted nobody, unlike Yasmini who knew whom to trust,
and when, and just how far. It was all over the city that
Gungadhura's practices were hastening his ruin, so it was
obviously wise not to espouse the maharajah's cause, in addition
to which he had become convinced in his own mind that Yasmini
actually knew the whereabouts of the Sialpore treasure. But he
did not trust Yasmini either, nor did he relish her scornful
promise of a mere percentage of the hoard when it should at last
be found. He wanted at least the half of it, bargains to the
contrary notwithstanding; and he had that comfortable conscience
that has soothed so many priests, that argues how the church must
be above all bargains, all bonds, all promises. Was there any
circumstance, or man, or woman who could bind and circumscribe
Jinendra's high priest? He laughed at the suggestion of it.
Samson was the man to see&mdash;Samson the man to be inveigled in
the nets. So he sent his verbal message by the mouth of Sita
Ram&mdash;a very pious devotee of Jinendra by Yasmini's special
orders; and, disguising his enormous bulk in a thin cloak, set
forth long after dark in a covered cart drawn by two tiny
bulls.</p>

<p>There were two doors to Sita Ram's small office; two to
Samson's large one &mdash;three doors in all, because they shared
the connecting one (that was locked just now) in common. At the
first sound of the long-awaited heavy footsteps on the outer
porch Sita Ram hurried to do the honors, and presently ushered
into Samson's presence the enormous bulk of the high priest,
spreading a clean cloth for him on an easy chair because the
priest's caste put it out of the question for him to sit on
leather defiled by European trousers.</p>

<p>Then, while the customary salaams were taking place, and the
customary questions about health and other matters that neither
cared a fig about, Sita Ram ostentatiously drew a curtain
part-way over the connecting door, and retired by way of the
other door and the passage to remove the knot from its hole.</p>

<p>It was part of Samson's pride, and one of his stoutest rungs
in the ladder of preferment, that be knew more Indian languages
than any other man of his rank in the service, and knew them
well. There were asterisks and stars and wiggly marks against his
name in the blue book that would have passed muster as a secret
code, and every one of them betokened passed examinations in some
Eastern tongue. So he was fully able to meet the high priest on
his own ground, as well as conscious of the advantage he held to
begin with, in that the priest had come to him instead of his
going to the priest.</p>

<p>"Well?" he demanded, cutting the pleasantries short abruptly
as soon as Sita Ram had closed the door.</p>

<p>"I came to speak of politics."</p>

<p>"I listen."</p>

<p>Samson leaned back and scrutinized his visitor with deliberate
rudeness. Having the upper hand he proposed to hold it.</p>

<p>But Jinendra's high priest was no beginner either in the game
of Beggar-my-neighbor. He understood the value of a big trump to
begin with, provided there is other ammunition in reserve.</p>

<p>"The whereabouts of the treasure of Sialpore is known!"</p>

<p>"The deuce it is!" said Samson, in good plain English. "Who
knows it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The high priest smiled.</p>

<p>Samson, as was natural, felt that tingling up and down the
spine and quickening of the heart-beats that announces crisis in
one's personal affairs, but concealed it admirably. It was the
high priest's turn to speak. He waited.</p>

<p>"Half of that treasure belongs to the priesthood of Jinendra,"
said the priest at last.</p>

<p>"Since when?"</p>

<p>"Since the beginning."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"We were keepers of the treasure once years ago, before the
English came. There came a time when the reigning rajah deceived
us by a trick, including murder; and ever since the English took
control the priests have had less and less authority. There has
been no chance to&mdash;to bring any&mdash;to put
pressure&mdash;to reestablish our rights. Nevertheless, our
rights in the matter were never surrendered."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that exactly?"</p>

<p>"The English are now the real rulers of Sialpore."</p>

<p>Samson nodded. That was a significant admission, coming from a
Brahmin priest.</p>

<p>"They should claim the treasure. But they can not claim it
without knowing where it is. The priests of Jinendra are entitled
to their half."</p>

<p>"You mean you are willing that my government should take half
the treasure, provided the priests of Jinendra get the other half
of it?"</p>

<p>The priest moved his head and his lips in a way that might be
taken to mean anything.</p>

<p>"If you know where the treasure is, dig it up," said Samson,
"and you shall have your answer!"</p>

<p>Yasmini in the heat of excitement had called Samson an idiot,
but he was far from being that, as she knew as well as any one.
He judged in that moment that if Jinendra's priest knew really
where the treasure was, he would never have come to drive a
bargain for the half of it, but would have taken all and said
nothing. On the other hand, it well might be that Gungadhura's
searchers had stumbled on it. In that case, there was that secret
letter from headquarters hurriedly placed in his top drawer when
the priest came in, that would give good excuse for putting
screws on Gungadhura. A coup d'tat was not beyond the pale of
possibility. As a champion of indiscretion and a judge of
circumstances, he would dare. The gleam in his eyes betrayed that
he would dare, and the priest grew uneasy.</p>

<p>"It is not I who know where the treasure is. I know who
knows."</p>

<p>"You mean Gungadhura knows!"</p>

<p>The priest smiled again. The commissioner was not such a
dangerous antagonist after all. Samson's eyes betrayed
disappointment, and the priest took heart of grace.</p>

<p>"For one-half of the treasure I will tell you who it is that
knows. You can take possession of the of the person.
Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Illegal. By what right could I arrest a person simply because
some one else asserts without proof that that person knows where
the treasure is?"</p>

<p>"Not arrest, perhaps. But you might protect."</p>

<p>"From whom? From what?"</p>

<p>"Gungadhura suspects. He might use
poison&mdash;torture&mdash;might carry the person off into
hiding&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, for Samson's eyes were again a signal of
excitement. He had it! He knew as much as the priest himself did
in that instant! There was one particular individual in Sialpore
who fitted that bill.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he answered. "Gungadhura would be answerable to me
for any outrages."</p>

<p>The priest showed a slight trace of dejection, but went
forward bravely to defeat.</p>

<p>"There is danger," he said. "If Gungadhura should lay hands on
all that money, there would be no peace in Rajputana. I should
not bargain away what belongs to the priesthood, but discretion
is permitted me; if you will agree with me tonight, I will accept
a little less than half of it."</p>

<p>Samson wanted time to think, and he was through with the
priest&mdash; finished with the interview,&mdash;not even anxious
to appear polite.</p>

<p>"If you bring me definite information," he said slowly, "and
on the strength of that my government should come in possession
of the Sialpore treasure, I will promise you in writing five per
cent. of it for the funds of the priesthood of Jinendra, the
money to be held in trust and administered subject to
accounting."</p>

<p>Jinendra's high priest hove his bulk out of the leather chair
and went through the form of taking leave, contenting himself,
too, with the veriest shell of courtesy&mdash;scorn for such an
offer scowling from his fat face. Samson showed him to the door
and closed it after him, leaving Babu Sita Ram to do the honors
outside in the passage.</p>

<p>"I kiss feet!" said the babu. "You must bless me, father. I
kiss feet!"</p>

<p>The priest blessed him perfunctorily.</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do, holy one? Anything a babu such as
I can do to earn merit?"</p>

<p>Rolling on his ponderous way toward the waiting bull-cart, the
priest paused a moment&mdash;eyed Sita Ram as a python eyes a
meal&mdash;and answered him.</p>

<p>"Tell that woman from me that if she has a plan at all she
must unfold it swiftly. Tell her that this Samson sahib is after
the treasure for himself; that he invited me to help him and to
share it with him. Let her have word with me swiftly."</p>

<p>"What treasure?" asked Sita Ram ingenuously. Having had his
ear to the knot-hole throughout the interview, it suited him to
establish innocence. The priest could have struck himself for the
mistake, and Sita Ram, too, for the impudence.</p>

<p>"Never mind!" he answered. "Tell her what I say. Those who
obey and ask no unwise questions oftentimes receive rewards."</p>

<p>Inside the office Samson sat elated, wiping his forehead and
setting blotter over writing-paper lest sweat from his wrists
make the ink run. It was a bender of a night, but he saw his way
to a brilliant stroke of statecraft that would land him on the
heights of official approval forever. Heat did not matter. The
man at the punkah had fallen asleep, but he did not bother to
waken him. Back at the knot-hole, babu Sita Ram watched him
scribble half a dozen letters, tearing each up in turn until the
last one pleased him. Finally he sealed a letter, and directed it
by simply writing two small letters&mdash;r. s.&mdash;in the
bottom left-hand corner.</p>

<p>"Sita Ram!" he shouted then.</p>

<p>The babu let him call three times, for evidence of how hard it
was to hear through that thick door. When he came it was round by
the other way in a hurry.</p>

<p>"You called, sir?"</p>

<p>"You need not copy any more of those documents tonight, Sita
Ram. I shall send a telegram in the morning and keep my report in
hand for a day or two. But there's one more little favor I would
like to ask of you."</p>

<p>"Anything, sahib! Anything! Am only desirous to please your
excellency."</p>

<p>"Do you know a man named Tripe&mdash;Tom Tripe&mdash;
drill-instructor to the Maharajah's Guard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

<p>"Could you find him, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Tonight, sahib?"</p>

<p>"Yes, tonight."</p>

<p>"Sahib, he is usually drunk at night, and very rough!
Nevertheless, I could find him."</p>

<p>"Please do. And give him this letter. Say it is from me. He
will know what to do with it. Oh, and Sita Ram&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

<p>"You will receive two days' extra pay from me, over and above
your salary, for tonight's extra work."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sahib. You are most kind&mdash;always most
generous."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;ah&mdash;Sita Ram&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sahib?"</p>

<p>"Say nothing, will you? By nothing I mean nothing! Hold your
tongue, eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sahib. Aware of the honor of my confidential
position, I am always most discreet!"</p>

<p>"What are you doing with that waste-basket?"</p>

<p>"Taking it outside, sahib."</p>

<p>"The sweeper will do that in the morning."</p>

<p>"Am always discreet, sahib. Discretion is better part of
secrecy! Better to burn all torn-up paper before daylight
always!"</p>

<p>"Very good. You're quite right. Thank you, Sita Ram. Yes, burn
the torn paper, please."</p>

<p>So Sita Ram, piecing together little bits of paper got a very
good idea of what was in the letter that he carried. The bonfire
in the road looked beautiful and gladdened his esthetic soul, but
the secret information thrilled him, which was better. He crossed
the river, and very late that night he found Tom Tripe, as sober
as a judge, what with riding back and forth to the Blaines' house
and searching in a cellar and what-not. He gave him the letter,
and received a rupee because Tom's dog frightened him nearly out
of his wits. Tom swore at the letter fervently, but that was
Tom's affair, who could not guess the contents.</p>

<p>Almost exactly at dawn Sita Ram, as sleepy as a homing owl,
reached his own small quarters in the densest part of town. He
had his hand on the door when another hand restrained him from
behind.</p>

<p>"You know me?" said a voice he did not know. A moment later
his terrified eyes informed him.</p>

<p>"Mukhum Dass? I owe you nothing!"</p>

<p>"Liar! You have my title-deed! Hand it over before I bring the
constabeel!"</p>

<p>"I? Your title-deed? I know nothing of it. What
title-deed?"</p>

<p>Mukhum Dass cut expostulation short, and denied himself the
pleasure of further threatening.</p>

<p>"See. Here is a letter. Read it, and then hand me over my
title-deed!"</p>

<p>"Ah! That is different?" said Sita Ram, pocketing Yasmini's
letter, for precaution's sake. "Wait here while I bring it!"</p>

<p>Two minutes later he returned with a parchment in a tin
tube.</p>

<p>"Do I receive no recompense?" he asked. "Did I not find the
title-deed and keep it safe? Where is the reward?"</p>

<p>"Recompense?" growled Mukhum Dass. "To be out of jail is
recompense! The next time you find property of mine, bring it to
me, or the constabeel shall have work to do!"</p>

<p>"Dog!" snarled the babu after him. "Dog of a usurer! Wait and
see!"</p> <hr> <br>


<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11">CHAPTER XI.</a><br>

"Say: that little girl you're wanting<br>

to run off with is my wife!"</h2>

<p class="quote"><i>To cover a trail is less than half the work,
for any dog with a nose can smell it out. You should make a false
trail afterward to deceive the clever folk.</i><br>

<br>

&mdash;Eastern Proverb</p><br>


<p class="first">THE other side to the intrigue developed
furiously up at the Baines' house on the hillside. Yasmini gave
directions from Tess's bedroom, where Tess hid her from prying
servants, she electing to change clothes once more&mdash;this
time into her hostess' riding breeches, boots and helmet. But she
insisted on Tess retaining the Rajput costume, only allowing a
hand-bag to be packed with woman's things, skirt, blouse and so
on.</p>

<p>"If I am seen there must be no mistake about me. They must
swear that I am you! It doesn't matter who they believe that you
are. Above all, Chamu the butler must not see me. When he is
dismissed in the morning he will tell tales for very spite, and
take his chance of my accusing him of theft; so be sure that he
sees Tom Tripe search the cellar. Then he will confirm to the
maharajah afterward that Tripe did search&mdash;and did see
something &mdash;and that Blaine sahib did lock the cellar door
afterward in anger, and put weights on it. That is the important
thing. Blaine sahib must drive the carriage again to the house of
Mukhum Dass; and be sure that I am not kept waiting
there&mdash;we must start before the dawn breaks! Now give me
paper and a pen to write the chit (letter) for Mukhum Dass."</p>

<p>There was no ink in the bedroom; Dick took her into the place
he called his study, and locked the door, glad of the excuse. He
was minded to know more of the intrigue before letting his wife
go off again that night on any wild adventure, second thoughts
having stirred his caution. He began by offering to lend her
money, suspecting that a fugitive princess would need that more
than anything. But she replied by drawing out from her bosom a
packet containing thousands of rupees in Bank of India notes, and
gave him money instead&mdash;not much, but she forced it on
him.</p>

<p>"For the three beggars. Ten rupees each. Pay it them in silver
in the morning. They have been very useful often, and may be so
again."</p>

<p>He watched her write the letter and seal the envelope.
Then:</p>

<p>"Say," he said, "don't you think you'd be doing right by
telling me more of this? I'll say nothing to a soul, but that
little girl you're wanting to run off with is my wife, and I'll
admit I'm kind o' concerned on her account."</p>

<p>Yasmini met his iron-gray eyes, judged him and found him
good.</p>

<p>"I never trusted man yet, not even the husband I shall marry,
with all I shall tell you," she answered. "Will you give me
silence in return for it?"</p>

<p>"Mum as the grave," he answered. And Dick Blaine kept his
word, not even hinting to Tess on the long drive afterward that
there had been as much as a question asked or confidence
exchanged. And Tess respected the silence, not deceived for a
minute by it. He and Yasmini had been longer in that room
together than any one-page letter needed, and she was sure there
was only one subject they discussed.</p>

<p>Dick brought Yasmini's horse to the gate, not to the door, and
she mounted outside in the road for additional precaution.
Instantly, then, without a word of farewell she was off like the
wind down-hill.</p>

<p>"It'll be all over town tomorrow that I'm dead or dying, if
anybody sees her!" Dick told his wife. "They'll swear that was
you, Tess, riding full pelt for the doctor!"</p>

<p>Soon after that Tom Tripe came, and made Chamu hold a light
for him while he searched the cellar.</p>

<p>"Hold the candle and your tongue too, confound you!" he told
the grumbling butler, indignant at being brought from bed.</p>

<p>Dick had already put the silver tube in place. Tom Tripe
raised the stone and saw it&mdash;uttered a tremendous
oath&mdash;and dropped the heavy stone back over the hole.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Dick demanded from the ladder-head,
appearing with a lantern from behind the raised trap.</p>

<p>"Looking for rum!" Tom answered. Then he turned on Chamu. "Did
you see what I saw? Speak a word of it, you devil, and I'll tear
your throat out! Silence, d'you understand?"</p>

<p>"Come out of there!" Dick ordered angrily. "I'll have to lock
this cellar door! I can't have people prospecting down there!
I've got reasons of my own for keeping that cellar undisturbed!
I'm surprised at you, Tom Tripe, taking advantage of me when my
back's turned!"</p>

<p>The minute they were up he put a padlock on the trap, and
nailed it down to the beams as well. Then, summoning Tom's aid,
he levered and shoved into place on top of it the heavy iron safe
in which he kept his specimens and money.</p>

<p>"That'll do for you, Chamu!" he said finally. "I don't care to
keep a butler who takes guests into the cellar at this hour of
night! You may go. I'll give you your time in the morning."</p>

<p>Chamu showed his teeth, by no means for the first time. It was
a favorite method of his for covering up bad service to fall back
on his reference.</p>

<p>"Maharajah sahib who is recommending me will not be pleased at
my dismissal!"</p>

<p>"You and your maharajah go to hell together!" Dick retorted.
"Tell him from me that I won't have inquisitive people in my
cellar! Now go; there's nothing more to talk about. Fire the
cook, too, as soon as he wakes! Tell him I don't like ground
glass in my omelet! Not been any in it? Well, what do I care? I
don't want any in it&mdash;that's enough! I'm taking no chances.
Tell him he's fired, and you two pull your freight together in
the morning first thing!"</p>

<p>Ten minutes alone with Yasmini had worked wonders with Dick
Blaine. Given to making up his mind and seeing resolution through
to stern conclusions, he was her stout ally from the moment when
he unlocked the study door again until the end&mdash;a good
silent ally too busy, apparently, about his own affairs to be
suspected. Certainly Samson never suspected his real share in the
intrigue&mdash;Samson, the judge of circumstances, indiscretions,
men and opportunity.</p>

<p>He sent Tom Tripe packing, with a flea in his ear for Chamu's
benefit, and a whispered word of friendship. Later he drove Tess
down-hill in the dog-cart, first changing his own disguise for
American clothes because the saises might be up and about when he
returned at dawn, and for them to see him in the costume of a
sais would only have added to the risk of putting Gungadhura's
men on the scent of Yasmini. Saises are almost the most prolific
source of rumor, but he had a means of stilling their
tongues.</p>

<p>There was little to say during the dark drive. They were
affectionate, those two, without too many words when it came to
leave-taking, each knowing the other's undivided love. Tess had
money&mdash;a revolver&mdash; cartridges&mdash;some
food&mdash;sufficient change of clothing for a week&mdash;
sun-spectacles; he reassured himself twice on all those
points.</p>

<p>"If you're camel-sick, fetch it up and carry, on," he advised,
"it'll soon pass. Then a hot bath, if you can get it, before you
stiffen. Failing that, oil."</p>

<p>The camels, with Yasmini and her women already mounted, were
kneeling in the darkness outside the house of Mukhum Dass.</p>

<p>"Come!" called Yasmini. "Hurry!"</p>

<p>Dick kissed his wife&mdash;waved his hand to
Yasmini&mdash;helped Tess on to the last camel in the kneeling
line&mdash;and they were off, the camel-men not needing to shout
to make those Bikaniri racers rise and start. They were gone like
ghosts into the darkness, making absolutely no noise, before Dick
could steady his nervous horse.</p>

<p>Then Ismail wanted to tie Yasmini's abandoned horse to the
tail of the dog-cart, but Dick sent him off to stable it
somewhere at the other side of town to help throw trackers off
the scent. He himself drove home by a very wide circuit indeed,
threading his cautious way among the hills toward the
gold-diggings, where he drove back and forward several times
around the edges of the dump, in order that the saises might see
the red dirt on the wheels afterward and believe, and tell where
he had been.</p>

<p>There was some risk that a panther, or even a tiger might try
for the horse in the dark, but that was not the kind of danger
that disturbed Dick Blaine much. A pistol at point-blank range is
as good as a rifle most nights of the week. He arrived home after
daylight with a very weary horse, and ordered the saises to wash
the wheels at once, in order that the color of the dirt might be
impressed on them thoroughly. They were quite sure he had been at
the mine all night. Then he paid off Chamu and the cook and sent
them packing.</p>

<p>He was looking for the beggars, to pay them, when Tom Tripe's
dog arrived and began hunting high and low for Tess. Trotters had
something in his mouth, wrapped in cloth and then again in
leather. He refused to give it to Dick, defying threats and
persuasion both. Dick offered him food, but the dog had
apparently eaten&mdash;water, but he would not drink.</p>

<p>Then the three beggars came, and watched Dick's efforts with
the interest of spectators at a play.</p>

<p>"Messenger!" said Bimbu finally, nodding at the dog. That much
was pretty obvious.</p>

<p>"Princess!" he added, seeing Dick was still puzzled. It
flashed across Dick's mind that on the dresser in the bedroom was
Tess's hat that Yasmini had worn. Doubtless to a dog's keen nose
it smelt of both of them. He ran to fetch it, the dog followed
him, eager to get into the house. He offered the hat to the dog,
who sniffed it and yelped eagerly.</p>

<p>"Bang goes fifty dollars, then!" he laughed.</p>

<p>He took the hat to Bimbu.</p>

<p>"Can you ride a camel?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The man nodded. "Another would drive it."</p>

<p>"Do you know where to get one?"</p>

<p>Bimbu nodded again.</p>

<p>"Take this hat, so that the dog will follow you, and ride by
camel to the home of Utirupa Singh. Here is money for the camel.
If you overtake the princess there will be a fabulous reward. If
you get there soon after she does there will be a good reward. If
you take too long on the way there will be nothing for you but a
beating! Go&mdash;hurry&mdash;get a move on! And don't you lose
the dog!"</p> <hr> <br>


<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">CHAPTER XII.</a><br>

"Ready for anything!<br>

If I weaken, tie me on the camel!"</h2>

<p class="verse">There are they who yet remember, when the depot's
forty jaws<br>

Through iron teeth that chatter to the tramping of a throng<br>

Spew out the crushed commuter in obedience to laws<br>

That all accord observance and that all agree are wrong;<br>

When rush and din and hubbub stir the too responsive vein<br>

Till head and heart are conquered by the hustle roaring by<br>

And the sign looks good that glitters on the temple gate of
Gain,&mdash;<br>

"There are spaces just as luring where the leagues untrodden
lie!"<br>

<br>

There are they who yet remember 'mid the fever of exchange,<br>

When the hot excitement throttles and the millions make or
break,<br>

How a camel's silent footfall on the ashen desert range<br>

Swings cushioned into distances where thoughts unfettered
wake,<br>

And the memory unbidden plucks an unconverted heart<br>

Till the glamour goes from houses and emotion from the
street,<br>

And the truth glares good and gainly in the face of 'change and
mart:<br>

"There are deserts more intensive. There are silences as
sweet!"</p><br>


<p class="first">THERE are camels and camels&mdash;more kinds
than there are of horses. The Bishareen of the Sudan is not a bad
beast, but compared to the Bikaniri there are no other desert
mounts worth a moment's consideration. Fleet as the wind, silent
as its own shadow, enduring as the long hot-season of its home,
the trained Bikaniri swings into sandy distances with a gait that
is a gallop really&mdash;the only saddle-beast of all that lifts
his four feet from the ground at once, seeming to spurn the very
laws of gravity.</p>

<p>They are favored folk who come by first-class Bikaniri camels,
for the better sort are rare, hard held to, and only to be bought
up patiently by twos and ones. Fourteen of them in one string,
each fit that instant for a distance-race with death itself, was
perhaps the best proof possible of Yasmini's influence on the
country-side. They were gathered for her and held in readiness by
men who loved her and detested Gungadhura.</p>

<p>Normally the drivers would have taken a passenger apiece, and
seven of the animals would have been ample; but this was a night
and a dawn when speed was nine-tenths of the problem, and Yasmini
had spared nothing&mdash;no man, no shred of pains or
influence,&mdash;and proposed to spare no beast.</p>

<p>They rode in single file, each man with a led camel ridden by
a woman, except that Yasmini directed her own mount and for the
most part showed the way, her desert-reared guide being hard put
to keep his own animal abreast of her. There is a gift&mdash;a
trick of riding camels, very seldom learned by the city-born; and
he, or she, who knows the way of it enjoys the ungrudged esteem
of desert men all the way from China to Damascus, from Peshawar
to Morocco. The camels detect a skilled hand even more swiftly
than a horse does and, like the horse, do their best work for the
rider who understands. So the only sound, except for a gurgle now
and then, and velvet-silent footfalls on the level sand, was the
grunts of admiration of the men behind. They had muffled all the
camel-bells.</p>

<p>When they started the night was deepest purple, set densely
with a mass of colored jewels; even the whitest of the stars
stole color from the rest. But gradually, as they raced toward
the sky-line and the stars paled, the sky changed into mauve.
Then without warning a belt of pale gold shone in the west behind
them, and with the false dawn came the cool wind like a legacy
from the kindly night-gods to encourage humans to endure the day.
A little later than the wind the true dawn came, fiery with hot
promise, and Tess on the last camel soon learned the meaning of
the cloak Yasmini had made her wear. Worn properly it covers all
the face except the eyes, leaving no surface for the hot wind to
torture, and saving the lips and lungs from being scorched.</p>

<p>In after years, when Yasmini was intriguing for an empire that
in her imagination should control the world, she had the
telegraph and telephone at times to aid her, as well as the
organized, intricate system of British Government to manipulate
from behind the scenes; but now she was racing against the wires,
and in no mood to appeal for help to a government that she did
not quite understand as yet, but intended to foot royally in any
case.</p>

<p>The easiest thing Gungadhura could do, and surest thing he
would attempt once word should reach him that she had vanished
from Sialpore would be to draw around her a network of his own
men. Watchers from the hills and lurkers in the sand-dunes could
pass word along of the direction she had taken; and the sequel,
if Gungadhura was only quick enough, would depend simply on the
loneliness or otherwise of the spot where she could be brought to
bay. If there were no witnesses his problem would be simple. But
if murder seemed too dangerous, there was the Nesting-place of
Seven Swans up in the mountains, as well as other places even
lonelier, to which she and Tess could be abducted. Tess might be
left, perhaps, to make her own way back and give her own
explanation of flight with a maharajah's daughter; but for
Yasmini abduction to the hills could only mean one of two things:
unthinkable surrender, or sure death by any of a hundred secret
means.</p>

<p>So the way they took was wild and lonely, frequented only by
the little jackals that eat they alone know what, and watched by
unenthusiastic kites that always seemed to be wheeling in air
just one last time before flying to more profitable feeding
ground. Yet within a thousand paces of the line they took lay a
trodden track, well marked by the sun-dried bones of camels (for
the camel dies whenever he feels like it, without explanation or
regret, and lies down for the purpose in the first uncomfortable
place to hand).</p>

<p>Yasmini and the guide between them, first one, then the other
assuming the direction, led the way around low hills and behind
the long, blown folds of sand netted scantly down by tufted, dry
grass, always avoiding open spaces where they might be seen, or
hollows too nearly shut in on both sides, where there might be
ambush.</p>

<p>Twice they were seen before the sun was two hours high, the
first time by a caravan of merchants headed toward Sialpore, who
breasted a high dune half a mile away and took no notice; but
that would not prevent the whole caravansary in the city's midst
from knowing what they had seen, and just how long ago, and
headed which way, within ten minutes after they arrived
&mdash;as, in fact, exactly happened.</p>

<p>The second party to catch sight of them consisted of four men
on camels, whose rifles, worn military fashion with a sling,
betrayed them as Gungadhura's men. "Desert police" he called
them. "Takers of tenths" was the popular, and much more accurate
description. The four gave chase, for a caravan in a hurry is
always likely to pay well for exemption from delay; and coming
nearly at right angles they had all the advantage. It was crime
to refuse to halt for them, for they were semi-military,
uniformed police. Yet their invariable habit of prying into
everything and questioning each member of a caravan would be
certain to lead to discovery. They had a signal station on the
hill two miles behind them, to keep them in touch with other
parties, north, south, east and west. It looked like Yasmini's
undoing, for they were gaining two for one along the shorter
course. Tess fingered the pistol her husband had made her bring,
wondering whether Yasmini would dare show fight (not guessing yet
the limitless abundance of her daring), and wondering whether she
herself would dare reply to the fire of authorized policemen. She
did not relish the thought of being an outlaw with a genuine
excuse for her arrest.</p>

<p>But the four police were oversure, and Yasmini too
quick-witted for them. They took a short cut down into a sandy
hollow, letting their quarry get out of sight, plainly intending
to wait on rising ground about a thousand yards ahead, where they
could foil attempts to circumvent them and, for the present, take
matters easy.</p>

<p>Instantly Yasmini changed direction, swinging her camel to the
right, down a deep nullah, and leading full pelt at right angles
to her real course. It was ten minutes before the men caught
sight of them again, and by that time they had nearly drawn
abreast, well beyond reasonable rifle range, and were heading
back toward their old direction, so that the police had lost
advantage, and a stern chase on slower camels was their only hope
but one. They fired half a dozen shots by way of calling
attention to themselves &mdash;then wheeled and raced away toward
the signal station on the hill.</p>

<p>Yasmini held her course for an hour after that, until a spur
of the hillside and another long fold of the desert shut them off
from the signaler's view. There she called a halt, unexpectedly,
for the camels did not need it. She was worried about
Tess&mdash;the one untested link in her chain of fugitives.</p>

<p>"Can you keep on through all the hot day?" she asked. "These
other women are as lithe as leopards, for I make them dance. They
are better able to endure than cheetahs. But you? Shall I put two
women on one camel, and send you back to Sialpore with two
men?"</p>

<p>Tess's back ached and she was dizzy, but her own powers had
been tested many a time; this was not more than double the strain
she had withstood before, and she was aware of strength in
reserve, to say nothing of conviction that what Yasmini's maids
could do she herself would rather perish than fall short of.
There is an element of sheer, pugnacious, unchristian human pride
that is said to damn, while it saves the best of us at times.</p>

<p>"Certainly not! I can carry on all day!" she answered.</p>

<p>Yasmini emitted her golden bell-like laugh that expressed such
immeasurable understanding and delight in all she understands.
(It has overtones that tell of vision beyond the ken of folk who
build on mud.)</p>

<p>"The maids shall knead your muscles for you at the other end,"
she answered. "Courage is good! You are my sister! You shall see
things that the West knows nothing of! If those
thrice-misbegotten Takers of Tenths had not seen us, we would
have reached our goal a little after midday. As it is, they have
certainly signaled to another party of Gungadhura's spawn
somewhere ahead of us, who will be coming this way with eyes open
and a lesson in mind for those who disregard their comrades'
challenge to halt and be looted! When I am maharani there shall
be a new system of protecting desert roads! But I dare not try
conclusions now. We must take a wide circuit and not reach our
destination until night falls. Are you willing?"</p>

<p>"Ready for anything!" said Tess. "If I weaken, tie me on the
camel!"</p>

<p>"Good! So speaks a woman! One woman of spirit is the master of
a dozen men &mdash;always.</p>

<p>They all drank sparingly of tepid water, ate a little of the
food each had, and were off again without letting the camels
kneel&mdash;heading now away from the hills toward a dazzling
waste of silver sand, across which the eyes lost all sense of
perspective, and all power to separate three objects in a row; a
land of mirage and monotony, glittering in places with the aching
white of salt deposits.</p>

<p>The heat increased, but the speed never slackened for an
instant. Flies emerged from everywhere to fasten on to
unprotected skin, and the only relief from them was under the hot
cloaks that burned them with the heat absorbed from sun and wind.
But even in that ghastly wilderness there were other living
things. Now and then a lean leopard stole away from in front of
them; and once they saw a man, naked and thinner than a rake,
striding along a ridge on heaven knew what errand. There were
scorpions everywhere.</p>

<p>Hour after hour, guided by desert-instinct that needs no
compass, and ever alert for sky-line watchers, Yasmini and the
headman took turns in giving direction, he yielding to her
whenever their judgment differed. And whether she was right or
not in every instance, she brought them at last to a little
desert oasis, where there was brackish water deep down in a
sand-hole, and a great rock offered shadow to rest in.</p>

<p>There they lay until the sun declined far enough to lose a
little of his power to scorch, and the camels bubbled to one
another, thirstless, unwearied, dissatisfied, as the universal
way of camels is, kneeling in a circle, rumps outward, each one
resentful of the other's neighborhood and, above all, disgruntled
at man's tyranny.</p>

<p>"By now," laughed Yasmini, smoking one of Tess's cigarettes in
the shadow of the rock, "Gungadhura knows surely that my palace
is empty and the bird has flown. Ten dozen different people will
have carried to him as many accounts of it, and each will have
offered different explanation and advice! I wonder what
Jinendra's fat priest has to say about it! Gungadhura will have
sent for him. He would hardly ride to the priest through the
streets, even in a carriage, with that love-token still raw and
smarting with which I marked his face! Two reliable reports will
have reached him already as to which direction I have taken. Yet
the telegraph will have told him that I have not been seen to
cross the border, and he will be wondering&mdash;wondering. May
he wonder until his brains whirl round and sicken him!"</p>

<p>"What can he do?" suggested Tess.</p>

<p>"Do? He can be spiteful. He will enter my palace and remove
the furniture, taking my mother's legacies to his own
lair&mdash;where I shall recover them all within three
weeks&mdash;and his own beside! I will be maharani within the
month!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you a wee bit previous?" suggested Tess.</p>

<p>"Not I! I never boast. My mother taught me that. Or when I do
boast it is to put men off the scent. I boasted once to Samson
sahib when be offered to have me sent to college, telling him I
was in the same school as himself and would learn the quicker. He
has wondered ever since then what I meant. "Krishna!" she laughed
impiously. "I wonder what Samson sahib would not give to have me
in his clutches at this minute! Have I told you that Gungadhura
plots with the Northwest tribes, and that the English know it?
No? Didn't I tell you? Samson sahib would give me almost anything
I asked, if he knew that it was I who told his government of
Gungadhura's plots; he would know then that with my knowledge to
guide him he would be more than a match for Gungadhura, instead
of a ball kicked this and that way between Gungadhura and the
English! Sometimes I almost think he would consent to try to make
me maharani!"</p>

<p>"Why not give him the chance then?"</p>

<p>"For two reasons. The English too often desert their
commissioners. My sure way is better than his blundering
attempts! The other reason is an even better one, and you shall
know it soon. I think&mdash;I do not know&mdash; I think, and I
hope that the fat high priest of Jinendra is playing me false,
and has gone to Samson sahib to make a bargain with him. Samson
sahib will consent to no bargains with that fat fool, if I am any
judge of hucksters; but he will have his ears on end and his eyes
sore with over-watchfulness from now forward! Oh, I hope
Jinendra's priest has gone to him! I tried to stir treachery in
his mind by brow-beating him about the bargain that be tried to
force from me!"</p>

<p>"But what are you and the priest and Samson all bargaining
about?" demanded Tess.</p>

<p>"The treasure of Sialpore! But I make no bargains! I, who know
where the treasure is! Why should I offer to share what is mine?
I will have a marriage contract drawn, and you shall be a
witness. That treasure is my dowry. Listen! Bubru Singh my father
died without a son&mdash;the first of all that long line who left
no son to follow him. The custom was that he should tell his son,
and none else, the secret of the treasure. He hated Gungadhura;
and, not knowing which the English would choose for his
successor, Gungadhura or another man, he told no one, making only
hints to my mother on his death-bed and saying that if I, his
daughter, ever developed brains enough to learn the secret of the
treasure, then I might also have wit enough to win the throne and
all would be well."</p>

<p>"And you discovered it? How did you discover it?"</p>

<p>"Not I."</p>

<p>"Who then?"</p>

<p>"Your husband did!"</p>

<p>"My husband? Dick Blaine? But that can't be true; he never
told me; he tells me everything."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he would have told if he had understood. He hardly
understands yet. Only in part&mdash;a little."</p>

<p>"Then how in the world&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Yasmini's golden laugh cut short the question as she rose to
her feet with a glance at the westering sun.</p>

<p>"Let us go. Two hours from now we shall cross the border into
another state. Two hours after night-fall our journey is ended.
Then the last game begins&mdash;the last chukker&mdash;and I
win!"</p>

<p>Tess wished then that they had never halted! The rest had
given her muscles time to stiffen, and her nerves the opportunity
to learn how tired they were. As the camels rose jerkily and
followed their leader in line at the same fast pace as before she
grew sick with the agony of aching bones and the utter weariness
of motion repeated again and again without varying or ceasing.
Every ligament in her body craved only stillness, but the camel's
unaccustomed thrust and sway continued, repeated to infinity,
until her nerves grew numb and she was hardly conscious of time,
distance, or direction.</p>

<p>Once again there was pursuit, but Tess was hardly conscious of
it&mdash; hardly realized that shots were fired&mdash;clinging to
the saddle in the misery of a sickness more weakening and deathly
than the sort small boats provide at sea. The sun went down and
left her cooler, but not recovered. She knew nothing of
boundaries, or of the changing nature of the country-side. It
meant nothing to her that they were passing great trees now, and
that once they crossed a stream by a wide stone bridge. The only
thought that kept drumming in her mind was that Dick, the ever
dependable, had misinformed her. She had "fetched it up"&mdash;a
dozen times. True to his instruction, she had "carried on." But
it did not pass! She felt more sick, more agonized, more weary
every minute.</p>

<p>But at last, because there is an end even to the motion of a
camel, in this world of example instances, about two hours after
nightfall the caravan halted in the shadow of great trees beside
a stone house with a wall about it. Her camel knelt with a motion
like a landslide, and Tess fell off forward on the ground and
fainted, only snatched away by strong hands in the nick of time
to save her from the camel's teeth. Uncertain, unforgiving brutes
are camels&mdash;ungrateful for the toil men put them to. For an
hour after that she was only dimly conscious of being laid on
something soft, and of supple, tireless women's hands that
kneaded her, and kneaded her, taking the weary muscles one by one
and coaxing them back to painlessness.</p>

<p>So she did not see the dog arrive&mdash;Trotters, the
Rampore-Great Dane, cousin to half the mongrel stock of
Hindustan, slobbering on a package that his set jaws hardly could
release; Yasmini, scornful of the laws of caste and ever
responsive to a true friend, pried it loose with strong fingers.
It was she, too, who saw to the dog's needs&mdash;fed him and
gave him drink&mdash;removed a thorn from his forefoot and made
much of him. She even gave Bimbu food, with her own hands, and
saw that his driver and camel had a place to rest in, before she
undid the string that bound the leather jacket of the
package.</p>

<p>Bimbu on the camel had led the dog by the short route and,
having nothing to be robbed of, had had small trouble with
policemen on the way.</p>

<p>The first thing Tess was really conscious of when she regained
her senses was a great dog that slumbered restlessly beside her
own finger-marked, disheveled, dusty, fifty-dollar hat on the
floor near by, awaking at intervals to sniff her hand and
reassure himself&mdash;then returning to the hat to sleep, and
gallop in his sleep; a rangy, gray, enormous beast with cavernous
jaws that she presently recognized as Trotters.</p>

<p>Then came the maids again, afraid for their very lives of the
dog, but still more mindful of Yasmini's orders. They resumed
their kneading of stiff muscles, rubbing in oil that smelt of
jasmine, singing incantations while they worked. They lifted the
bed away from the wall, and one of the women danced around and
around it rhythmically, surrounding Tess with what the West
translates as "influence"&mdash;the spell that all the East knows
keeps away evil interference.</p>

<p>Last of all by candlelight, Yasmini came, scented and fresh
and smiling as the flower from which she has her name, dressed
now in the soft-hued silken garments of a lady of the land.</p>

<p>"Where did you get them?" Tess asked her.</p>

<p>"These clothes? Oh, I have friends here. Have no fear
now&mdash;there are friends on every side of us."</p>

<p>She showed Tess a letter, pierced in four places by a dog's
eye-teeth.</p>

<p>"This is from Samson sahib. Do you remember how I prayed that
Jinendra's priest might think to play me false? I think he has.
Some one has been to Samson sahib. Hear this:</p>

<p class="letter">"The Princess Yasmini Omanoff Singh,<br>

<br>

"Your Highness,<br>

<br>

"Word has reached me frequently of late of pressure brought to
bear on you from certain quarters, and hints have been dropped in
my hearing that the object of the pressure is to induce you to
disclose a secret you possess. Let me assure you that my official
protection from all illegal restraint and improper treatment is
at your service. Further, that in case your secret is such as
concerns vitally the political relations, present or future, of
Sialpore the proper person to whom to confide it is myself.
Should you see your way to take that only safe course, you may
rest assured that your own interests will be cared for in every
way possible.<br>

<br>

"I have the honor to be,<br>

<br>

"Your Highness' obedient servant,<br>

<br>

"Roland Samson, K. C. S. I."</p>

<p>"That looks fair enough," said Tess. "I dislike Samson for
reasons of my own, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hah!" laughed Yasmini. "He makes love to you! Is it not so?
He would make love to me if I gave him opportunity! What a jest
for the gods if I should play that game with him and make him
marry me! I could! I could make of Samson a power in India! But
the man would weary me with his conceit and his 'orders from
higher up' within a week. I can have power without his help! What
a royal jest, though, to marry Samson and intrigue with all the
jealous English wives who think they pull the strings of
government!"</p>

<p>"You'd get the worst of it," laughed Tess.</p>

<p>"Maybe. I shall never try it. I am more of the East than the
West. But I will answer Samson. Bimbu shall remain here lest he
talk too much, but the dog shall take a letter to Tom Tripe at
dawn. Samson knew hours ago that I have flown the nest. He will
wonder how Tom Tripe holds communication with me, and so swiftly,
and will have greater respect for him&mdash;which may serve us
later."</p>

<p>"Let me add a letter to my husband then, to tell him I'm
safe."</p>

<p>"Surely. But now eat. Eat and be strong. Can you stand? Can
you walk? Have the maids put new life in you?"</p>

<p>Tess was astonished at her swift recovery. She was a little
stiff&mdash; a little weak&mdash;a little tired; but she could
walk up and down the room with her natural gait and Yasmini
clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"I will order food brought. Listen! Tonight I am Abhisharika.
Do you know what that is&mdash;Abhisharika?"</p>

<p>Tess shook her head.</p>

<p>"I go to my lover of my own accord!"</p>

<p>"That sounds more like West than East!"</p>

<p>"You think so? You shall come with me and see! You shall play
the part of cheti (the indispensable hand-maiden)&mdash;you and
Hasamurti. You must dress like her. Simply be still and watch,
and you shall see!"</p> <hr> <br>


<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br>

"I am a king's daughter!"</h2>

<p class="verse">Of what use were the gift of gods,<br>

The buoyant sweetness of a virgin state,<br>

The blossomy delight of youth<br>

Ablow with promise of fruit consummate;<br>

What use the affluence of song<br>

And marvel of delicious motion meet<br>

To grace the very revelings of Fawn,<br>

Could she not lay them at another's feet?</p><br>


<p class="first">THAT was a night when the full-moon rose in a
sea of silver, and changed into amber as it mounted in the sky.
The light shone like liquid honey, and the shadowed earth was
luminous and still. The very deepest of the shadows glowed with
undertones of half-suggested color. Hardly a zephyr moved.</p>

<p>"You see?" said Yasmini. "The gods are our servants! They have
set the stage!"</p>

<p>Hand in hand&mdash;Yasmini in the midst in spotless silken
white; Tess and Hasamurti draped in black from head to
foot&mdash;they left the house by a high teak door in the garden
wall and started down a road half hidden by lacy shadows. All
three wore sandals on bare feet, and Tess was afraid at first of
insects.</p>

<p>"Have no fear of anything tonight," Yasmini whispered. "The
gods are all about us! Vasuki, who is king of all the snakes, is
on our side!"</p>

<p>One could not speak aloud, for the spell of mystery overlay
everything. They walked into the very heart of silent beauty.
Overhead, enormous trees, in which the sacred monkeys slept,
dropped tendrils like long arms yearning with the love of mother
earth. Here and there the embers of a dying fire glowed crimson,
and the only occasional sound was of sleepy cattle that chewed
the cud contentedly&mdash;or when a monkey moved above them to
change his roost. Once, a man's voice singing by a fireside
conjured back for a moment the world's hard illusion; but the
stillness and the mystery overcame him too, and all was true
again, and wonderful.</p>

<p>Hand in hand they followed the road to its end and turned into
a lane between thorn hedges. Now the moon shone straight toward
them and there was no shadow, so that the earth was bright golden
underfoot&mdash;a lane of mellow light on which they trod between
fantastic woven walls. At the end of the lane they came into a
clearing at a forested-edge, where an ancient ruined temple
nestled in the shadow of great trees, its stone front and the
seated image of a long-neglected god restored to more than
earthly sanctity and peace by the cool, caressing moonlight.</p>

<p>"Jinendra again!" Yasmini whispered. "Always Jinendra! His
priests are rascals, but the god himself is kind! When I am
maharani, that temple shall stand whole again!"</p>

<p>In front of the temple, between them and the trees, was a pond
edged with carved stone. Lotus leaves floated on the water, and
one blue flower was open wide to welcome whoever loved
serenity.</p>

<p>Still hand in hand, they crossed the clearing mid-way to the
pond, and there Yasmini bade them stand.</p>

<p>"Draw no nearer. Only stand and watch."</p>

<p>She had a great blue flower in her bosom that heaved and fell
for proof of her own emotion. Hasamurti's hand was trembling as
she nestled closer, and Tess felt her own pulsing to quick
heart-beats as she clasped the girl's.</p>

<p>Yasmini left them, and walked alone to the very edge of the
pond, where she stood still for several minutes, apparently
gazing at her own reflection in the moonlit water&mdash;or
perhaps listening. There was no sign of any one else, nor sound
of footfall. Then, as if the reflection satisfied, or she had
heard some whisper meant for her and none else, she began to
dance, moving very slowly in the first few rhythmic steps,
resembling a water-goddess, the clinging silk displaying her
young outline as she bent and swayed.</p>

<p>She might have been watching her reflection still, so close
she danced to the water's edge with her back turned to the moon.
But presently the dance grew quicker, and extended arms that
glistened in the light like ivory increased the sinuous
perfection of each pose. Still there was nothing wild in
it&mdash;nothing but the very spirit of the moonlight, beautiful
and kind and full of peace. She moved now around the water, in a
measured cadence that by some unfathomable witchery of her
devising conveyed a thought of maidenhood and modesty. It dawned
on Tess, who watched her spell-bound, that there was not one
immodest thought in all Yasmini's throng of moods, but only a
scorn of all immodesty and its pretensions. And whether that was
art, or sheer expression of the truth within her rather than a
recognition of the truth without, Tess never quite determined;
for it is easier to judge spoken word and unexpected deed than to
see the thought behind it. That night Yasmini's mood was simpler
and less unseemly than the very virgin dress she wore.</p>

<p>Presently she danced more swiftly, making no sound, so
phantom-light and graceful that the rhythm of her movement
carried her with scarce a touch to earth. That was strength as
well as art, but the art made strength seem spiritual power to
float on air. Gaiety grew now into her cadences&mdash; the utter
joy of being young. She seemed to revel in a sense of buoyancy
that could lift her above all the grim deceptions of the world of
wrath and iron, and make her, like the moonlight, all-kind,
all-conquering. Three times round the pond she leapt and gamboled
in an ecstasy of youth undisillusioned.</p>

<p>Then the dance changed, though there was yet in it the heart
of gaiety. There moved now in the steps a sense of
mystery&mdash;a consciousness of close infinity unfolding, far
more subtly signified than by the clumsy shift of words. And she
welcomed all the mystery&mdash;greeted it with outstretched
arms&mdash;was glad of it, and eager-impetuous to know the new
worlds and the ways undreamed of. Minute after minute, rhapsody
on rhapsody, she wooed the near, untouchable delights that, like
the moonbeams, seem but empty nothing when the drudges seize them
for their palaces of mud.</p>

<p>Nor did she woo in vain. There were stanzas in her dance of
simple gratitude, as if the spirit of the mystery had found her
mood acceptable and dowered her with new ability to see, and
know, and understand. Even the two watchers, hand in hand a
hundred paces off, felt something of the power of vision she had
gained, and thrilled at its wonder.</p>

<p>Borne on new wings of fancy now her dance became a very image
of those infinite ideas she had seen and felt. She herself,
Yasmini, was a part of all she saw&mdash;mistress of all she
knew&mdash;own sister of the beauty in the moonlight and the
peace that filled the glade. The night itself&mdash; moon, sky
and lotus-dappled water&mdash;trees -growth and grace and
stillness, were part of her and she of them. Verily that minute
she, Yasmini, danced with the gods and knew them for what in
truth they are&mdash;ideas a little lower, a little less
essential than the sons of men.</p>

<p>Then, as if that knowledge were the climax of attainment, and
its ownership a spell that could command the very lips of night,
there came a man's voice calling from the temple in the ancient
Rajasthani tongue.</p>

<p>"Oh, moon of my desire! Oh, dear delight! Oh, spirit of all
gladness! Come!"</p>

<p>Instantly the dance ceased. Instantly the air of triumph left
her. As a flower's petals shut at evening, fragrant with promise
of a dawn to come, she stood and let a new mood clothe her with
humility; for all that grace of high attainment given her were
nothing, unless she, too, made of it a gift. That night her
purpose was to give the whole of what she knew herself to be.</p>

<p>So, with arms to her sides and head erect, she walked straight
toward the temple; and a man came out to meet her, tall and
strong, who strode like a scion of a stock of warriors. They met
mid-way and neither spoke, but each looked in the other's eyes,
then took each other's hands, and stood still minute after
minute. Hasamurti, gripping Tess's fingers, caught her breath in
something like a sob, while Tess could think of nothing else than
Brynhild's oath:</p>

<p class="verse">"O Sigurd, Sigurd,<br>

Now hearken while I swear!<br>

The day shall die forever<br>

And the sun to darkness wear<br>

Ere I forget thee, Sigurd ..."</p>

<p>Her lips repeated it over and over, like a prayer, until the
man put his arm about Yasmini and they turned and walked together
to the temple. Then Hasamurti tugged at Tess, and they followed,
keeping their distance, until Yasmini and her lover sat on one
stone in the moonlight on the temple porch, their faces clearly
lighted by the mellow beams. Then Tess and Hasamurti took their
stand again, hand in each other's hand, and watched once
more.</p>

<p>It was love-making such as Tess had never dreamed
of,&mdash;and Tess was no familiar of hoydenish amours;
gentle&mdash;poetic&mdash;dignified on his part&mdash;manly as
the plighting of the troth of warriors' sons should be. Yasmini's
was the attitude of simple self-surrender, stripped of all
pretense, devoid of any other spirit than the will to give
herself and all she had, and knowledge that her gift was more
than gold and rubles.</p>

<p>For an hour they sat together murmuring questions and reply,
heart answering to heart, eyes reading eyes, and hand enfolding
hand; until at last Yasmini rose to leave him and he stood like a
lord of squadroned lances to watch her go.</p>

<p>"Moon of my existence!" was his farewell speech to her.</p>

<p>"Dear lord!" she answered. Then she turned and went, not
looking back at him, walking erect, as one whose lover is the son
of twenty kings. Without a word she took Tess and Hasamurti by
the hand, and, looking straight before her with blue eyes glowing
at the welling joy of thoughts too marvelous for speech, led them
to the lane&mdash;the village street&mdash;and the door in the
wall again. The man was still gazing after her, erect and
motionless, when Tess turned her head at the beginning of the
lane; but Yasmini never looked back once.</p>

<p>"Why did you never tell me his name?" Tess asked; but if
Yasmini heard the question she saw fit not to answer it. Not a
word passed her lips until they reached the house, crossed the
wide garden between pomegranate shrubs, and entered the dark door
across the body of a sleeping watchman&mdash;or a watchman who
could make believe he slept. Then:</p>

<p>"Good night!" she said simply. "Sleep well! Sweet dreams!
Come, Hasamurti &mdash;your hands are cleverer than the other
women's."</p>

<p>Daughter of a king, and promised wife of a son of twenty
kings, she took the best of the maids to undress her, without any
formal mockery of excuse. Two of the other women were awake to
see Tess into bed&mdash;no mean allowance for a royal lady's
guest.</p>

<p>Very late indeed that night Tess was awakened by Yasmini's
hand stroking the hair back from her forehead. Again there was no
explanation, no excuse. A woman who was privileged to see and
hear what Tess had seen and heard, needed no apology for a visit
in the very early hours.</p>

<p>"What do you think of him?" she asked. "How do you like him?
Tell me!"</p>

<p>"Splendid!" Tess answered, sitting up to give the one word
emphasis. "But why did you never tell me his name?"</p>

<p>"Did you recognize him?"</p>

<p>"Surely! At once&mdash;first thing!"</p>

<p>"No true-born Rajputni ever names her lover or her
husband."</p>

<p>"But you knew that I know Prince Utirupa Singh. He came to my
garden party!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, no Rajputni names her lover to another man or
woman&mdash; calling him by his own name only in retirement, to
his face."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;he&mdash;isn't he the one who Sir Roland Samson
told me ought to have been maharajah instead of Gungadhura?"</p>

<p>Yasmini nodded and pressed her hand.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night you shall see another spectacle. Once, when
Rajputana was a veritable land of kings, and not a province
tricked and conquered by the English, there was a custom that
each great king held a durbar, to which princes came from
everywhere, in order that the king's daughter might choose her
own husband from among them. The custom died, along with other
fashions that were good. The priests killed it, knowing that
whatever fettered women would increase their sway. But I will
revive it&mdash;as much as may be, with the English listening to
every murmur of their spies and the great main not yet thrown. I
have no father, but I need none. I am a king's daughter! Tomorrow
night I will single out my husband, and name him by the title
under which I shall marry him&mdash;in the presence of such men
of royal blood as can be trusted with a secret for a day or two!
There are many who will gladly see the end of Gungadhura! But I
must try to sleep&mdash;I have hardly slept an hour. If a maid
were awake to sing to me&mdash;but they sleep like the dead after
the camel-ride, and Hasamurti, who sings best, is weariest of
all."</p>

<p>"Suppose I sing to you?" said Tess.</p>

<p>"No, no; you are tired too."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! It's nearly morning. I have slept for hours. Let me
come and sing to you."</p>

<p>"Can you? Will you? I am full of gladness, and my brain whirls
with a thousand thoughts, but I ought to sleep."</p>

<p>So Tess went to Yasmini's room, and sat beneath the punkah
crooning Moody and Sankey hymns and darky lullabies, until
Yasmini dropped into the land of dreams. Then, listening to the
punkah's regular soft swing, she herself fell forward on her
arms, half-resting on the bed, half on the chair, until Hasamurti
crept in silently and, laughing, lifted her up beside Yasmini and
left her there until the two awoke near noon, wondering, in each
other's arms.</p>

hidden in the folds of your proposal; and that is dangerous
too.</i><br>

<br>

&mdash;Eastern Proverb</p>

<p class="first">IT tickled Gungadhura's vanity to have an
Englishman in his employ; but Tom Tripe never knew from one day
to another what his next reception would be. On occasion it would
suit the despot's sense of humor to snub and slight the veteran
soldier of a said-to-be superior race; and he would choose to do
that when there was least excuse for it. On the other hand, he
recognized Tom as almost indispensable; he could put a lick and
polish on the maharajah's troops that no amount of cursing and
coaxing by their own officers accomplished. Tom understood to a
nicety that drift of the Rajput's martial mind that caused each
sepoy to believe himself the equal of any other Rajput man, but
permitted him to tolerate fierce disciplining by an alien.</p>

<p>And Tom had his own peculiarities. Born in a Shorncliffe
barrack hut, he had a feudal attitude toward people of higher
birth. As for a prince&mdash; there was almost no limit to what
he would not endure from one, without concerning himself whether
the prince was right or wrong. Not that he did not know his
rights; his limitations were not Prussian; he would stand up for
his rights, and on their account would answer the maharajah back
more bluntly and even offensively than Samson, for instance,
would have dreamed of doing. But a prince was a prince, and that
was all about it.</p>

<p>So, on the morning following the flight of Yasmini and Tess,
Tom, sore-eyed from lack of sleep but with an eye-opener of raw
brandy inside him, and a sense of irritation due to the absence
of his dog, roundly cursed nine unhappy mahouts for having dared
let an elephant steal his rum&mdash; drilled two companies of
heavy infantry in marching order on parade until the sweat ran
down into their boots and each miserable man saw two suns in the
sky where one should be&mdash;dismissed them with a threat of
extra parades for a month to come unless they picked their feet
up cleaner&mdash;and reported, with his heart in his throat, at
Gungadhura's palace.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the Sikh doctor was just leaving. It
always suited that doctor to be very friendly with Tom Tripe,
because there were pickings, in the way of sick certificates that
Tom could pass along to him, and shortcomings that Tom could
overlook. He told Tom that the maharajah was in no mood to be
spoken to, and in no condition to be seen.</p>

<p>"Then you go back and tell his highness," Tom retorted, "that
I've got to speak with him! Business is business!"</p>

<p>The doctor used both hands to illustrate.</p>

<p>"But his cheek is cut with a great gash from here to here! He
was testing a sword-blade in the armory, last night, and it broke
and pierced him."</p>

<p>"Hasn't a soldier like me seen wounds before? I don't swoon
away at the sight of blood! He can do his talking through a
curtain if he's minded!"</p>

<p>"I would not dare, Mr. Tripe! He has given orders. You must
ask one of the eunuchs&mdash;really."</p>

<p>"I thought you and I were friends?" said Tom, with whiskers
bristling.</p>

<p>"Always! I hope always! But in this instance&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom folded both arms behind his back, drill-master-on-parade
fashion.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," he answered. "Friendship's friendship.
Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours. I want to see his
highness. I want to see him bad. You're the man that's asked to
turn the trick for me."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Tripe, I will try. I will try. But what shall I
tell him?"</p>

<p>Tom hesitated. That doctor was a more or less discreet
individual, or he would not have been sent for. Besides, he had
lied quite plausibly about the dagger-wound. But there are
limits.</p>

<p>"Tell him," he said presently, "that I've found the man who
left that sword in his armory o' purpose for to injure him! Say I
need private and personal instructions quick!"</p>

<p>The doctor returned up the palace steps. Ten minutes later he
came down again smiling, with the word that Tom was to be
admitted. In a hurry, then, Tom's brass spurs rang on
Gungadhura's marble staircase while a breathless major-domo tried
to keep ahead of him. One takes no chances with a man who can
change his mind as swiftly as Gungadhura habitually did. Without
a glance at silver shields, boars' heads, tiger-skins, curtains
and graven gold ornaments beyond price, or any of the other
trappings of royal luxury, Tom followed the major-domo into a
room furnished with one sole divan and a little Buhl-work table.
The maharajah, sprawling on the divan in a flowered silk
deshabille and with his head swathed in bandages, ignored Tom
Tripe's salute, and snarled at the major-domo to take himself out
of sight and hearing.</p>

<p>Soldier-fashion, as soon as the door had closed behind him Tom
stood on no ceremony, but spoke first.</p>

<p>"There was a fracas last night, Your Highness, outside a
certain palace gate." He pronounced the word to rhyme with
jackass, but Gungadhura was not in a mood to smile. "An escaped
elephant bumped into the gate and bent it. The guard took to
their heels; so I've locked 'em all up, solitary, to think their
conduct over."</p>

<p>The maharajah nodded.</p>

<p>"Good!" he said curtly.</p>

<p>"I cautioned the relieving guard that if they had a word to
say to any one they'd follow the first lot into cells. It don't
do to have it known that elephants break loose that easy."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>"Subsequently, acting on instructions from Your Highness, I
searched the cellar of Mr. Blaine's house on the hill, Chamu the
butler holding a candle for me." "What did he see? What did that
treacherous swine see?" snapped Gungadhura, pushing back the
bandage irritably from the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Nothing, Your Highness, except that he saw me lift a stone
and look under it."</p>

<p>"What did you see under the stone?"</p>

<p>"A silver tube, all wrought over with Persian patterns, and
sealed at both ends with a silver cap and lots o' wax."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you take it, you idiot?"</p>

<p>"Two reasons. Your Highness told me to report to you what I
saw, not to take nothing. And Mr. Blaine came to the top of the
cellar ladder and was damned angry. He'd have seen me if I'd
pinched a cockroach. He was that angry that he locked the cellar
door afterward, and nailed it down, and rolled a safe on top of
it!"</p>

<p>"Did he suspect anything?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Your Highness."</p>

<p>"What did you tell him?"</p>

<p>"Said I was looking for rum."</p>

<p>"Doubtless he believed that; you have a reputation! You are an
idiot! If you had brought away what you saw under that stone, you
might have drawn your pension today and left India for good!"</p>

<p>Tom made no answer. The next move was Gungadhura's. There was
silence while a gold clock on the wall ticked off eighty
seconds.</p>

<p>"You are an idiot!" Gungadhura broke out at last. "You have
missed a golden opportunity! But if you will hold your
tongue&mdash;absolutely &mdash;you shall draw your pension in a
month or two from now, with ten thousand rupees in gold into the
bargain!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Highness." (A native of the country would have
begun to try to bargain there and then. But there are more
differences than one between the ranks of East and West; more
degrees than one of dissimulation. Tom gravely doubted
Gungadhura's prospect of being in position to grant him a
pension, or any other favor, a month or two from then. A native
of the country would have bargained nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Keep that guard confined for the present. You have my leave
to go."</p>

<p>Tom saluted and withdrew. He was minded to spit on the palace
steps, but refrained because the guard would surely have reported
what he did to Gungadhura, who would have understood the act in
its exact significance.</p>

<p>As he left the palace yard he passed a curtained two-wheeled
cart drawn by small humped bulls, and turned his head in time to
see the high priest of Jinendra heave his bulk out from behind
the curtains and wheezily ascend the palace steps.</p>

<p>"A little ghostly consolation for the maharajah's sins!" he
muttered, as he headed toward his own quarters for another stiff
glass of brandy and some sleep. He felt he needed both&mdash;or
all three!</p>

<p>"If it's true there's no hell, then I'm on velvet!" he
muttered. "But I'm a liar! A liar by imputation&mdash;by
suggestion&mdash;by allegation &mdash;by collusion&mdash;and in
fact! Now, if I was one o' them Hindus I could hire a priest to
sing a hymn and start me clean again from the beginning. Trouble
is, I'm a complacent liar! I'll do it again, and I know it!
Brandy's the right oracle for me!"</p>

<p>But there was no consolation, ghostly or otherwise, being
brought to Gungadhura. Jinendra's fat high priest, short-winded
from his effort on the stairs, with aching hams and knees that
trembled from exertion, was ushered into a chamber some way
removed from that in which Tom Tripe had had his interview. The
maharajah lay now with his head on the lap of Patali, his
favorite dancing girl, in a room all scent and cushions and
contrivances. (That was how Yasmini learned about it
afterward.)</p>

<p>It was against all the canons of caste and decency to accord
an interview to any one in that flagrant state of
impropriety&mdash;to a high priest especially. But it amused
Gungadhura to outrage the priest's alleged asceticism, and to
show him discourtesy (without in the least affecting his own
superstitious scruples in the matter of religion.) Besides, his
head ached, and he liked to have Patali's resourcefulness and wit
to reinforce his own tired intuition.</p>

<p>The priest sat for several minutes recovering breath and
equipoise. Then, when the pain had left his thighs and he felt
comfortable, he began with a bomb.</p>

<p>"Mukhum Dass the money-lender has been to me to give thanks,
and to make a meager offering for the recovery of his lost
title-deed! He has it back!"</p>

<p>Gungadhura swore so savagely that Patali screamed.</p>

<p>"How did he find it? Where?"</p>

<p>Mukhum Dass had told the exact truth, as it happened, but the
priest had drawn his own conclusions from the fact that it was
Samson's babu who returned the document. He was less than ever
sure of Gungadhura's prospects, suspecting, especially since his
own night-interview with the commissioner, that some new dark
plot was being hatched on the English side of the river. Having
no least objection to see Gungadhura in the toils, he did not
propose to tell him more than would frighten and worry him.</p>

<p>"He said that a hand gave him the paper in the dark. It was
the work of Jinendra doubtless."</p>

<p>"Pah! Thy god functions without thee, then! That is a wondrous
bellyful of brains of thine! Do you know that the princess has
fled the palace?"</p>

<p>Jinendra's priest feigned surprise.</p>

<p>"Is it not as clear as the stupidity on thy fat face that the
ten-times casteless hussy is behind this? Bag of wind and widows'
tenths! Now I must buy the house on the hill from Mukhum Dass and
pay the brute his price for it!"</p>

<p>"Borrowing the money from him first?" the priest suggested
with a fat smirk. None guessed better than he how low debauch had
brought the maharajah's private treasury.</p>

<p>"Go and pray!" growled Gungadhura. "Are thy temple offices of
no more use than to bring thee here twitting me with poverty? Go
and lay that belly on the flags, and beat thy stupid brains out
on the altar step! Jinendra will be glad to see thy dark soul on
its way to Yum (the judge of the dead) and maybe will reward me
afterward! Go! Get out here! Leave me alone to think!"</p>

<p>The priest went through the form of blessing him, taking more
than the usual time about the ceremony for sake of the annoyance
that it gave. Gungadhura was too superstitious to dare interrupt
him.</p>

<p>"Better tell that Mukhum Dass to sell me the house cheap,"
said the maharajah as a sort of afterthought. Patali had been
whispering to him. "Tell him the gods would take it as an act of
merit."</p>

<p>"Cheap?" said the priest over his shoulder as he reached the
door. "I proposed it to him." (That was not exactly true. He had
proposed that Mukhum Dass should give the title to the temple as
an act of grace.) "He answered that what the gods have returned
to him must be doubly precious and certainly entrusted to his
keeping; therefore he would count it a deadly sin to part with
the title now on any terms!"</p>

<p>"Go!" growled Gungadhura. "Get out of here!"</p>

<p>After the priest had gone he talked matters over with Patali,
while she stroked his aching head. Whoever knows the mind of the
Indian dancing girl could reason out the calculus of treason.
They are capable of treachery and loyalty to several sides at
once; of sale of their affections to the highest bidder, and of
death beside the buyer in his last extremity, having sold his
life to a rival whom they loathe. They are the very priestesses
of subterfuge &mdash;idolaters of
intrigue&mdash;past&mdash;mistresses of sedition and seduction.
Yet even Patali did not know the real reason why Gungadhura
lusted for possession of that small house on the hill. She
believed it was for a house of pleasure for herself.</p>

<p>"Persuade the American gold-digger to transfer the lease of
it," she suggested. "He is thy servant. He dare not refuse."</p>

<p>But Gungadhura had already enough experience of Richard Blaine
to suspect the American of limitless powers of refusal. He was
superstitious enough to believe in the alleged vision of
Jinendra's priest, that the clue to the treasure of Sialpore
would be found in the cellar of that house, where Jengal Singh
had placed it; impious enough to double-cross the priest, and to
use any means whatever, foul preferred, to get possession of the
clue. But he was sensible enough to know that Dick Blaine could
not be put out of his house by less than legal process. Patali,
watching the expression of his eyes, mercurially changed her
tactics.</p>

<p>"Today the court is closed," she said. "Tomorrow Mukhum Dass
will go to file his paper and defeat the suit of Dhulap Singh. He
will ride by way of the hat between the temple of Siva and the
place where the dead Afghan kept his camels. He must ride that
way, for his home is on the edge of town."</p>

<p>But Gungadhura shook his head. He hardly dared seize Mukhum
Dass or have him robbed, because the money-lender was registered
as a British subject, which gave him full right to be
extortionate in any state he pleased, with protection in case of
interference. He could rob Dick Blaine with better prospect of
impunity. Suddenly he decided to throw caution to the winds.
Patali ceased from stroking his head, for she recognized in his
eyes the blaze of determination, and it put all her instincts on
the defensive.</p>

<p>"Pen, ink and paper!" he ordered.</p>

<p>Patali brought them, and he addressed the envelope first,
practicing the spelling and the none too easily accomplished
English.</p>

<p>"Why to him?" she asked, watching beside his shoulder. "If you
send him a letter he will think himself important. Word of
mouth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, fool! He would not come without a letter."</p>

<p>"Better to meet him, then, as if by accident and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no time! That cursed daughter of my uncle is up to
mischief. She has fled. Would that Yum had her! She went to
Samson days ago. The English harass me. She has made a bargain
with the English to get the treasure first and ruin me. I need
what I need swiftly!"</p>

<p>"Then the house is not for me?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>He wrote the letter, scratching it laboriously in a narrow
Italian hand; then sealed and sent it by a messenger. But Patali,
sure in her own mind that her second thoughts had been best and
determined to have the house for her own, went out to set spies
to keep a very careful eye on Mukhum Dass and to report the
money-lender's movements to her hour by hour.</p>

<p>In less than an hour Dick Blaine arrived by dog-cart in answer
to the note, and Patali did her best to listen through a keyhole
to the interview. But she was caught in the act by Gungadhura's
much neglected queen, and sent to another part of the palace with
a string of unedifying titles ringing in her ears.</p>

<p>There was not a great deal to hear. Dick Blaine was perfectly
satisfied to let the maharajah search his cellar. He was almost
suspiciously complaisant, making no objection whatever to
surrendering the key and explaining at considerable length just
how it would be easiest to draw the nails. He would be away from
home all day, but Chamu the butler would undoubtedly admit the
maharajah and his men. For the rest, he hoped they would find
what they were looking for, whatever that might be; and he
sincerely hoped that the maharajah had not hurt his head
seriously.</p>

<p>Asked why he had nailed the cellar door down, he replied that
he objected to unauthorized people nosing about in there.</p>

<p>"Who has been in the cellar?" asked Gungadhura.</p>

<p>"Only Tom Tripe."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite. Until that very evening I always kept the cellar
padlocked. It's a Yale lock. There's nobody in this man's town
could pick it."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;thank you for the permission."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it. I hope your head don't hurt you much. Good
morning."</p>

<p>Dick little suspected, as he drove the dog-cart across the
bridge toward the club, chuckling over the quick success of
Yasmini's ruse, that he himself had set the stage for
tragedy.</p> <hr> <br>

To test your cunning by!</p><br>


<p class="first">IT is not always an entirely simple matter in
India to dismiss domestic servants. To begin with it was Sunday;
the ordinary means of cashing checks were therefore unavailable,
and Dick Blaine had overlooked the fact that he had no money of
small denominations in the house. It was hardly reasonable to
expect Chamu and the cook to leave without their wages.</p>

<p>Then again, Sita Ram had not yet sent new servants to replace
the potential poisoners; and Chamu had put up a piteous bleating,
using every argument, from his being an orphan and the father of
a son, down to the less appealing one that Gungadhura would be
angry. In vain Dick reassured him that he and cook and maharajah
might all go to hell together with his, Dick Blaine's, express
permission. In vain he advised him to put the son to work, and be
supported for a while in idleness. Chamu lamented noisily.
Finally Dick compromised by letting both servants remain for one
more day, reflecting that they could not very well tamper with
boiled eggs; lunch and dinner he would get at the English club
across the river; for breakfast on Monday he would content
himself again with boiled eggs, and biscuits out of an imported
tin, after which he would cash a check and send both the rascals
packing.</p>

<p>So the toast that Chamu brought him he broke up and threw into
the garden, where the crows devoured it without apparent
ill-effect; he went without tea, and spent an hour or so after
breakfast with a good cigar and a copy of a month-old Nevada
newspaper. That religious rite performed, he shaved twice over,
it being Sunday, and strolled out to look at the horses and
potter about the garden that was beginning to shrivel up already
at the commencement of the hot weather.</p>

<p>"If I knew who would be maharajah of this state from one week
to the next," he told himself, "I'd get a contract from him to
pipe water all over the place from the hills behind."</p>

<p>He was sitting in the shade, chewing an unlit cigar,
day-dreaming about water-pressure and dams and gallons-per-hour,
when Gungadhura's note came and he ordered the dog-cart at once,
rather glad of something to keep him occupied. As he drove away
he did not see Mukhum Dass lurking near the small gate, as it was
not intended that he should. Mukhum Dass, for his part, did not
see Pinga, the one-eyed beggar with his vertical smile, who
watched him from behind a rock, for that was not intended either.
Pinga himself was noticed closely by another man.</p>

<p>The minute Dick was out of sight Mukhum Dass entered the small
gate in the wall, and called out for Chamu brazenly. Chamu
received him at the bottom of the house-steps, but Mukhum Dass
walked up them uninvited.</p>

<p>"The cellar," he said. "I have come to see the cellar. There
is a complaint regarding the foundations. I must see."</p>

<p>"But, sahib, the door is locked."</p>

<p>"Unlock it."</p>

<p>"I have no key."</p>

<p>"Then break the lock!"</p>

<p>"The cellar door is nailed down!"</p>

<p>"Draw the nails!"</p>

<p>"I dare not! I don't know how! By what right should I do this
thing?"</p>

<p>"It is my house. I order it!"</p>

<p>"But, sahib, only yesterday Blaine sahib dismissed me in great
anger because I permitted another one as much as to look into the
cellar!"</p>

<p>If the tale Yasmini told him on the morning of her first visit
to Tess had not been enough to determine Mukhum Dass, now, with
the lost title-deed recovered, the conviction that Gungadhura
wanted the place for secret reasons, and Chamu's objections to
confirm the whole wild story, he became as set on his course and
determined to wring the last anna out of the mystery as only a
money-lender can be.</p>

<p>"With what money did you repay to me the loan that your son
obtained by false pretenses?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I? What? I repaid the loan. I have the receipt. That is
enough."</p>

<p>"On the receipt stands written the number of the bank-note. I
have kept the bank-note. It was stolen from the Princess Yasmini.
Do you wish to go to jail? Then open that cellar door!"</p>

<p>"Sahib, I never stole the note!" wept Chamu. "It was thrust
into my cummerbund from behind!"</p>

<p>But Mukhum Dass set his face like a flint, and the wretched
Chamu knew nothing about the law against compounding felonies.
Wishing he had had curiosity enough himself to search the cellar
thoroughly before the door was nailed down, he finally yielded to
the money-lender's threats and between them, with much sweating
and grunting, they pushed and pulled the safe from off the trap.
Then came the much more difficult task of drawing nails without
an instrument designed for it. Dick Blaine kept all his tools
locked up.</p>

<p>"There is an outside door to the cellar, behind the house,"
said Chamu.</p>

<p>"But that is of iron, idiot! and bolts on the inside with a
great bar resting in the stonework. Are there no tools in the
garden?"</p>

<p>Chamu did not know, and the money-lender went himself to see.
There Pinga with the vertical smile saw him choose a small
crow-bar and return into the house with it. Pinga passed the word
along to another man, who told it to a third, who ran with it
hot-foot to Gungadhura's palace.</p>

<p>Once inside the house again Mukhum Dass lost no time, arguing
to himself most likely that with the secret of the treasure of
Sialpore in his possession it would not much matter what damage
he had done. He would be able to settle for it. He broke the hasp
of the door, and levered up the trap, splintering it badly and
breaking both hinges in the process, while Chamu watched him,
growing green with fear.</p>

<p>Then he ordered a lamp and went alone into the cellar, while
Chamu, deciding that a desperate situation called for desperate
remedies, went up-stairs on business of his own. It took Mukhum
Dass about two minutes to discover the loose stone&mdash;less
than two more to raise it&mdash;and about ten seconds to see and
pounce on the silver tube. He was too bent on business to notice
the man with the vertical smile peering down at him through the
trap. Pinga escaped from the house after seeing the money-lender
hide the tube inside his clothes, and less than a minute later a
lean man ran like the wind to Gungadhura's palace to confirm the
first's report.</p>

<p>With a wry face at the splintered trap-door, and a shrug of
his shoulders of the kind he used when clients begged in tears
for extra time in which to pay, Mukhum Dass looked about for
Chamu with a sort of half-notion of giving him a small bribe. But
Chamu was not to be seen. So he left the house by the way he had
come, mounted his mule where he had left it in a hollow down the
road, and rode off smiling.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Chamu and the cook both left by the same
exit. Chamu had with him, besides his own bundle of belongings, a
revolver belonging to Dick Blaine, two bracelets belonging to
Tess, a fountain-pen that he had long had his heart on, plenty of
note-paper on which to have a writer forge new references, a
half-dozen of Dick's silk handkerchiefs and a turquoise tie-pin.
The revolver alone, in that country in those days, would sell for
enough to take him to Bombay, where new jobs with newly arrived
sahibs are plentiful. The cook, not having enjoyed the run of the
house, had only a few knives and a pound of cocoa. They quarreled
all the way down-hill as to why Chamu should and should not
defray the cook's traveling expenses.</p>

<p>A little later, in the hat between Siva's temple and the
building, where the dead Afghan used to keep his camels, Mukhum
Dass, smiling as he rode, was struck down by a knife-blow from
behind and pitched off his mule head-foremost. The mule ran away.
The money-lender's body was left lying in a pool of blood, with
the clothing torn from it; and it was considered by those who
found the body several hours afterward and drove away the pariah
dogs and kites, that the fact of his money having been taken
deprived the murder of any unusual interest.</p>

<p>Late that evening Dick Blaine, returning from a desultory
dinner at the club across the river, very nearly fell into the
trap-door, for the hamal had run away too, thinking he would
surely be accused of all the mischief, and no lamps were lit.</p>

<p>"Well!" he remarked, striking a match to look about him,
"dad-blame me if that isn't a regular small town yegg's trick!
You'd think after I gave Gungadhura the key and all, he'd have
the courtesy to use it and draw the nails! His head can't ache
enough to suit me! Me for the princess! If I'd any scruples,
believe me, bo, they're vanished&mdash;gone&mdash;Vamoosed! That
young woman's going to win against the whole darned outfit,
English, Indian and all! Me for her! Chamu! Where's Chamu? Why
aren't the lamps lit?"</p>

<p>He wandered through the house in the dark in search of
servants, and finally lit a lamp himself, locked all the doors
and went to bed.</p> <hr> <br>

<p class="first">TROTTERS, fed on chopped raw meat by advice of
Tess, and brushed by Bimbu for an hour to get the stiffness out
of him, was sent off in the noon heat with a double message for
his master, one addressed to Samson, one to Dick Blaine, and both
wrapped in the same chewed leather cover, that the dog might
understand. The mongrel in him made him more immune to heat than
a thoroughbred would have been. In any case, he showed nothing
but eagerness to get back to Tom Tripe, and, settling the package
comfortably in his jaws, was off without ceremony at a steady
canter.</p>

<p>"If all my friends were like that one," said Yasmini, "I would
be empress of the earth, not queen of a little part of Rajputana!
However, one thing at a time!"</p>

<p>It was hardly more than a village that Tess could see through
the jalousies of her bedroom windows. The room was at a corner,
so that she had a wide view in two directions from either deep
window-seat. There were all the signs of Indian village life
about her&mdash;low, thatched houses in compounds fenced with
thorn and prickly pear,&mdash;temples in between
them,&mdash;trades and handicrafts plied in the shade of ancient
trees, &mdash;squalor and beauty, leisure, wealth, poverty and
lordliness all hand in hand. She could see the backs of elephants
standing in a compound under trees, and there were peacocks
swaggering everywhere, eating the same offal, though, as the
unpretentious chickens in the streets. Over in the distance,
beyond the elephants, was the tiled roof of a great house
glinting in strong sunlight between the green of enormous pipal
trees; and there were other houses, strong to look at but not so
great, jumbled together in one quarter where a stream passed
through the village.</p>

<p>Yasmini came and sat beside her in the window-seat, as simply
dressed in white as on the night before, with her gold hair
braided up loosely and an air of reveling in the luxury of peace
and rest.</p>

<p>"That great house," she said, peering through the jalousies,
"is where the ceremony is to be tonight. My father's father built
it. This is not our state, but he owned the land."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it belong to Gungadhura now?" Tess asked.</p>

<p>"No. It was part of my legacy. This house, too, that we are
in. Look, some of them have come on elephants to do me honor.
Many of the nobles of the land are poor in these days; one, they
tell me, came on foot, walking by night lest the ill-bred laugh
at him. He has a horse now. He shall have ten when I am
maharani!"</p>

<p>"Won't the English get to hear of this?" Tess asked.</p>

<p>Yasmini laughed.</p>

<p>"Their spies are everywhere. But there has been great talk of
a polo tournament to be held on the English side of the river at
Sialpore. The English encourage games, thinking they keep us
Rajputs out of mischief &mdash;as indeed is true. This, then, is
a conference to decide which of our young bloods shall take part
in the tournament, and who shall contribute ponies. The English
lend one another ponies; why not we? The spies will report great
interest in the polo tournament, and the English will smile
complacently."</p>

<p>"But suppose a spy gets in to see the ceremony?" Tess
suggested.</p>

<p>Yasmini's blue eyes looked into hers and there was a Viking
glare behind them, suggestive of the wintry fjords whence one of
her royal ancestresses came.</p>

<p>"Let him!" she said. "It would be the last of him!"</p>

<p>Tess considered a while in silence.</p>

<p>"When is the tournament to be?" she asked presently. "Won't
the English think it strange that the conference about men and
ponies should be put off until so late?"</p>

<p>"They might have," Yasmini answered. "They are suspicious of
all gatherings. But a month ago we worked up a dispute entirely
for their benefit. This is supposed to be a last-hour effort to
bring cohesion out of jealousy. The English like to see Rajputs
quarrel among themselves, because of their ancient saw that says
'Divide and govern!' I do not understand the English
altogether&mdash;yet; but in some ways they are like an open
book. They will let us quarrel over polo to our heart's
content."</p>

<p>There is something very close to luxury in following the
thread of an intrigue, sitting on soft cushions with the sunlight
sending layers of golden shafts through jalousies into a cool
room; so little of the strain and danger of it; so much of its
engagement. Tess was enjoying herself to the top of her bent.</p>

<p>"But when the ceremony is over," she said, "and you yourself
have proclaimed Prince Utirupa king of Sialpore, there will still
remain the problem of how to make the English recognize him.
There is Gungadhura, for instance, to get out of the way; and
Gungadhura's sons&mdash;how many has he?"</p>

<p>"Five, all whole and well. But the dogs must suffer for their
breeding. Who takes a reverter's colt to school into a charger?
The English will turn their eyes away from Gungadhura's
stock."</p>

<p>"But Gungadhura himself?"</p>

<p>"Is in the toils already! Say this for the English: they are
slow to reach conclusions&mdash;slower still to change their
policy; but when their mind is made up they are swift! Gungadhura
has been sending messages to the Northwest tribes. How do I know?
You saw Ismail, my gate-man? His very brother took the letters
back and forth!"</p>

<p>"But why should Gungadhura risk his throne by anything so
foolish?"</p>

<p>"He thinks to save it. He thinks to prove that the tribes
began the dickering, and then to offer his army to the
English&mdash;Tom Tripe and all! Patali put him up to it. Perhaps
she wants a necklace made of Hill-men's teeth&mdash;who knows?
Gungadhura went deeply into debt with Mukhum Dass, to send money
to the Mahsudis, who think more of gold than promises. The fool
imagines that the English will let him levy, extra taxes
afterward to recoup himself. Besides, there would be the daily
expenses of his army, from which he could extract a lakh or two.
Patali yearns for diamonds in the fillings of her teeth!"</p>

<p>"Did you work out all this deep plot for yourself?" Tess
asked.</p>

<p>"I and the gods! The gods of India love intrigue. My father
left me as a sort of ward of Jinendra, although my mother tried
to make a Christian of me, and I always mistrusted Jinendra's
priest. But Jinendra has been good. He shall have two new temples
when I am maharani."</p>

<p>"And you have been looking for the treasure ever since your
father died?"</p>

<p>"Ever since. My father prophesied on his death-bed that I
should have it in the end, but all he told to help me find it was
a sort of conundrum. 'Whoever looks for flowers,' be said, 'finds
happiness. Who looks for gold finds all the harness and the teeth
of war! A hundred guard the treasure day and night, changing with
the full moon!' So I have always looked for flowers, and I am
often happy. I have sent flowers every day to the temple of
Jinendra."</p>

<p>"Who or what can the hundred be, who guard the treasure day
and night?" Tess wondered.</p>

<p>"That is what puzzled me. At first, because I was very young,
I thought they must be snakes. So I made friends with the snakes,
learning how to handle even cobras without fear of them. Then,
when I had learned that snakes could tell me nothing, but are
only Widyadharas&mdash;beautiful lost fairies dreadfully afraid
of men, and very, very wishful to be comforted, I began to think
the hundred must be priests. So I made friends with the priests,
and let them teach me all their knowledge. But they know nothing!
They are parasites! They teach only what will keep men in their
power, and women in subjection, themselves not understanding what
they teach! I soon learned that if the priests were
treasure-guards their charge would have been dissipated long ago!
Then I looked for a hundred trees, and found them! A hundred
pipal trees all in a place together! But that was only like the
first goal in the very first chukker of the game&mdash;as you
shall learn soon!"</p>

<p>"Then surely I know!" said Tess excitedly. "In the grounds of
the palace across the river, that you escaped from the night
before you came to see me, there is quite a little forest of
pipals."</p>

<p>"Nine and sixty and the roots of four," Yasmini answered, her
eyes glowing as if there were fire behind them. "The difficulty
is, though, that they don't change with the full moon! Pipal
trees grow on forever, never changing, except to grow bigger and
bigger. They outlive centuries of men. Nevertheless, they gave me
the clue, not only to the treasure but to the winning of it!"</p>

<p>The afternoon wore on in drowsy quiet, both of the girls
sleeping at intervals&mdash;waited on at intervals by Hasamurti
with fruit and cooling drinks&mdash;Yasmini silent oftener than
not as the sun went lower, as if the details of what she had to
do that night were rehearsing themselves in her mind. No amount
of questioning by Tess could make her speak of them again, or
tell any more about the secret of the treasure. At that age
already she knew too well the virtue and fun of
unexpectedness.</p>

<p>They ate together very early, reclining at a low table heaped
with more varieties of food than Tess had dreamed that India
could produce; but ate sparingly because the weight of what was
coming impressed them both. Hasamurti sang during the meal,
ballad after ballad of the warring history of Rajasthan and its
royal heroines, accompanying herself on a stringed instrument,
and the ballads seemed to strike the right chord in Yasmini's
heart, for when the meal finished she was queenly and alert, her
blue eyes blazing.</p>

<p>Then came the business of dressing, and two maids took Tess
into her room to bathe and comb and scent and polish her, until
she wondered how the rest of the world got on without
hand-maidens, and laughed to think that one short week ago she
had never had a personal attendant since her nurse. Swiftly the
luxurious habit grows; she rather hoped her husband might become
rich enough to provide her a maid always!</p>

<p>And after all that thought and trouble and attention she stood
arrayed at last as no more than a maid herself&mdash;true, a maid
of royalty; but very simply dressed, without a jewel, with plain
light sandals on her stockinged feet, and with a plain veil
hanging to below her knees&mdash;all creamy white. She admitted
to herself that she looked beautiful in the long glass, and
wished that Dick could see her so, not guessing how soon Dick
would see her far more gorgeously arrayed.</p>

<p>Yasmini, when she came into the room, was a picture to take
the breath away,&mdash;a rhapsody in cream and amber, glittering
with gems. There were diamonds sparkling on her girdle, bosom,
ears, arms; a ruby like a prince's ransom nestled at her throat;
there were emeralds and sapphires stitched to the soft texture of
her dress to glow and glitter as she moved; and her hair was
afire with points of diamond light. Coil on coil of huge pearls
hung from her shoulders to her waist, and pearls were on her
sandals.</p>

<p>"Child, where in heaven's name did you get them all?" Tess
burst out.</p>

<p>"These? These jewels? Some are the gifts of Rajput noblemen.
Some are heirlooms lent for the occasion. This&mdash;and this"
she touched the ruby at her throat and a diamond that glittered
at her breast like frozen dew &mdash;"he gave me. He sent them by
his brother, with an escort of eight gentlemen. But you should
wear jewels, too."</p>

<p>"I have none&mdash;none with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought of that. I borrowed these for you."</p>

<p>With her own hands she put opals around Tess's neck that
glowed as if they were alive, and then bracelets on her right arm
of heavy, graven gold; then kissed her.</p>

<p>"You look lovely! I shall need you tonight! No other human
guesses how I need you! You and Hasamurti are to stand close to
me until the end. The other maids will take their place behind
us. Now we are ready. Come."</p>

<p>Outside in the dark there were torches flaring, and low gruff
voices announced the presence of about fifty men. Once or twice a
stallion neighed; and there was another footfall, padded and
heavy, in among the stamping of held horses.</p>

<p>The night was hot, and full of that musty mesmeric quality
that changes everything into a waking dream. The maids threw dark
veils over them to save their clothing from the dust kicked up by
a crowd, and perhaps, too, as a concession to the
none-so-ancient, but compelling custom that bids women be covered
in the streets.</p>

<p>Yasmini took Tess by the hand and walked out with her,
followed closely by Hasamurti and the other women, between the
pomegranates to the gate in the garden wall. From that moment,
though, she stood alone and never touched hand, or sought as much
as the supporting glances of her women until they came back at
midnight.</p>

<p>A watchman opened the gate and, Yasmini leading, they passed
through a double line of Rajput noblemen, who drew their sabers
at some one's hoarse command and made a steel arch overhead that
flashed and shimmered in the torchlight. Beyond that one order to
draw sabers none spoke a word. Tess looked straight in front of
her, afraid to meet the warrior eyes on either hand, lest some
one should object to a foreigner in their midst on such a night
of nights.</p>

<p>In the road were three great elephants standing in line with
ladders leaning against them. The one in front was a tusker with
golden caps and chains on his glistening ivory, and a howdah on
his back like a miniature pagoda&mdash;a great gray monster, old
in the service of three Rajput generations, and more conscious of
his dignity than years. Yasmini mounted him, followed by Tess and
Hasamurti, who took their place behind her in the howdah, one on
either side, Hasamurti pushing Tess into her proper place, after
which her duty was to keep a royal fan of ostrich plumes gently
moving in the air above Yasmini's head.</p>

<p>The other women climbed on to the elephant behind, and the
third one was mounted by one man, who looked like a prince, to
judge by the jewels glittering in his turban.</p>

<p>"His brother!" Hasamurti whispered.</p>

<p>Then again a hoarse command broke on the stillness. Horses
wheeled out from the shadow of the wall, led by saises, and the
Rajput gentry mounted. Ten of them in line abreast led the
procession, while some formed a single line on either hand, and
ten brought up the rear. Men with torches walked outside the
lines. But no one shouted. No one spoke.</p>

<p>Straight down the quiet road under the majestic trees, with
the monkeys, frightened by the torchlight, chattering nervously
among the branches, &mdash;to the right near the lane Yasmini
used the night before, and on toward the shadowy bulk of the
great house in the distance the elephant trod loftily, the swing
and sway of his back suggesting ages of past history, and
ever-lasting ages more to come. The horses kicked and squealed,
for the Rajput loves a mettled mount; but nothing disturbed the
elephant's slow, measured stride, or moved the equanimity of his
mahout.</p>

<p>Villagers came to the walls, and stood under the roadside
trees to smile and stare. Every man and child salaamed low as the
procession passed, and some followed in the dust to feast their
curiosity until the end of it; but not a voice was raised much
above a whisper, except where once or twice a child cried
shrilly.</p>

<p>"Why the silence?" Tess asked in a whisper, and without
turning her head Yasmini answered:</p>

<p>"Would you have the English know that I was hailed as maharani
through the streets? Give them but leave and they would beat the
tom-toms, and dance under the trees. These are all friends
here."</p>

<p>The great house was surrounded by a high wall, but a gate was
flung wide open to receive them and the procession never paused
until the leading elephant came to a halt under a portico lit by
dozens of oil lamps. Standing on the porch were four women,
veiled, but showing the glint of jewels and the sheen of splendid
dresses underneath; they were the first that night to give tongue
in acclamation, raising a hub-bub of greeting with a waving of
slim hands and arms. They clustered round Yasmini as she climbed
down from the elephant, and led her into the hall with arms in
hers and a thousand phrases of congratulation and glad
welcome.</p>

<p>"Four queens!" Hasamurti whispered.</p>

<p>Tess and Hasamurti followed, side by side, not down the main
hall, but to the left, into a suite of rooms reserved for women,
where they all removed their veils and the talking and laughter
began anew. There were dozens of other women in there&mdash;about
half as many ladies as attendants, and they made more noise than
a swarm of Vassar freshmen at the close of term.</p>

<p>The largest of the suite of rooms was higher than the rest by
half a dozen steps. At its farther end was a gilded door, on
either side of which, as far as the walls at each end, was a
panel of very deeply carved wood, through the interstices of
which every whisper in the durbar hall was audible when the women
all were still, and every man and movement could be seen. Yasmini
took her stand close to the gilded door, and Tess and Hasamurti
watched the opportunity to come beside her&mdash;no very easy
matter in a room where fifty women jockeyed for recognition and a
private word.</p>

<p>But there came a great noise of men's voices in the durbar
hall, and of a roll-call answered one by one, each name being
written in a vellum book, that none might say afterward he was
present, who was not, and none might escape responsibility. The
women grew silent as a forest that rustles and shivers in the
night wind, and somebody turned down the lights, so that it was
easier to see through the carved panel, and not so easy to be
seen. Immediately beyond the panel was a dais, or wide platform,
bare of everything except a carpet that covered it from end to
end. A short flight of steps from the center of it led to the
durbar floor below.</p>

<p>The durbar floor was of polished teak, and all the columns
that supported the high roof were of the same wood, carved with
fantastic patterns. From the center hung a huge glass chandelier,
its quivering pendants multiplying the light of a thousand
candles; and in every corner of the hall were other chandeliers,
and mirrors to reflect the light in all directions.</p>

<p>Grouped in the center of the hall were about two hundred men,
all armed with sabers,&mdash;men of every age, and height and
swarthiness, from stout, blue-bearded veterans to youths yet in
their teens,&mdash;dressed in every hue imaginable from the
scarlet frock-coat, white breeches and high black boots of a
risaldar-major to the jeweled silken gala costume of the dandies
of Rajput's youth. There was not a man present who did not rank
himself the equal of all reigning kings, whatever outward
deference the exigency of alien overrule compelled. This was a
race that, like the Poles, knew itself to have been conquered
because of subdivision and dissension in its ranks; no lack of
courage or of martial skill had brought on their subjection. Not
nearly all their best were there that night&mdash;not even any of
the highest-placed, because of jealousy and the dread of
betrayal; but there was not a priest among them, so that the
chance was high that their trust would be well kept.</p>

<p>These were the pick of Rajputana's patriots&mdash;the men who
loved the old ways, yet admitted there was virtue in an
adaptation of the new. And Yasmini, with a gift for reading men's
hearts that has been her secret and her source of power first and
last, was reviving an ancient royal custom for them, to the end
that she might lead them in altogether new ways of her own
devising.</p>

<p>The roll-call ended, a veteran with a jeweled aigrette in his
turban stood apart from the rest with his back toward the dais
steps and made a speech that was received in silence, though the
women peering through the panel, fluttered with excitement, and
the deep breathing in the durbar hall sounded like the very
far-off murmur of a tide. For he rang the changes on the ancient
chivalry of Rajasthan, and on the sanctity of ancient custom, and
the right they had to follow what their hearts accounted
good.</p>

<p>"And as in ancient days," he said, "our royal women chose
their husbands at a durbar summoned by the king; and because in
ancient times, when Rajasthan was a land of kings indeed and its
royal women, as the endless pages of our history tell, stood
proved and acclaimed as fit to govern, and defend, and die
untarnished in the absence of their lords; therefore we now see
fit to attend this durbar, and to witness and give sanction. Once
again, my Lords, a royal daughter of a throne of Rajasthan shall
choose her husband in the sight of all of us let come of it what
may!"</p>

<p>He ceased, and the crowd burst into cheers. Yasmini translated
his speech afterward to Tess. He said not a word of Gungadhura,
or of the throne of Sialpore, leaving that act of utter daring to
the woman who was, after all, the leader of them all that
night.</p>

<p>Now all eyes were on the dais and the door behind it. In the
inner room the women stirred and whispered, while a dozen of
them, putting on their veils again, gathered around Yasmini,
waiting in silence for her to give the cue. She waited long
enough to whet the edge of expectation, and then nodded.
Hasamurti opened the door wide and Yasmini stepped forth,
aglitter with her jewels.</p>

<p>"Ah-h-h!" was her greeting&mdash;the unbidden, irrepressible,
astonished gasp of mixed emotion of a crowd that sees more wonder
than it bargained for.</p>

<p>The twelve princesses took their place beside her on the dais,
six on either side. Immediately behind her Tess and Hasamurti
stood. Yasmini's other maids arranged themselves with their backs
to the gilded door. She, Tess and Hasamurti were the only women
there unveiled.</p>

<p>She stood two minutes long in silence, smiling down at them
while Tess's heart-beats drummed until she lost count, Tess
suspecting nervousness because of her own nerves, and not so
wildly wrong.</p>

<p>"You're not alone," she whispered. "You've a friend behind
you&mdash;two friends!"</p>

<p>Then Yasmini spoke.</p>

<p>"My Lords." The word "Bahadur" rolled from her golden throat
like chords of Beethoven's overture to Leonori. "You do our olden
customs honor. True chivalry had nearly died since superstition
and the ebb and flow of mutual mistrust began to smother it in
modern practices. But neither priest nor alien could make it
shame for maidenhood to choose which way its utmost honor lies.
Ye know your hearts' delight. Goodness, love and soundless fealty
are the attributes your manhood hungers for. Of those three
elements is womanhood. And so, as Shri&mdash;goddess of all good
fortune&mdash;comes ever to her loved one of her own accord and
dowers him with richer blessing than he dreamed, true womanhood
should choose her mate and, having chosen, honor him. My Lords, I
choose, in confidence of your nobility and chivalry!"</p>

<p>Pausing for a minute then, to let the murmur of assent die
down, and waiting while they stamped and shuffled into three long
lines, she descended the steps alone, moving with a step so
dignified, yet modest, that no memory of past events could
persuade Tess it was artistry. She felt&mdash;Tess was sure of
it, and swore to it afterward&mdash;in her heart of hearts the
full spiritual and profound significance of what she did.</p>

<p>Beginning at the left end of the first line, she passed slowly
and alone before them, looking each man in the eyes, smiling at
each one as she passed him. Not a man but had his full meed of
attention and the honor due to him who brings the spirit of
observance and the will to help another man succeed.</p>

<p>Back along the second line she went, with the same supreme
dignity and modesty, omitting not even the oldest veteran, nor
letting creep into her smile the veriest suggestion of another
sentiment than admiration for the manliness by whose leave she
was doing what she did. Each man received his smile of
recognition and the deference due his pride.</p>

<p>Then down the third line, yet more slowly, until Tess had cold
chills, thinking Utirupa was not there! One by one she viewed
them all, until the last man's turn came, and she took him by the
hand and led him forth.</p>

<p>At that the whole assembly milled into a mob and reformed in
double line up and down the room. The same voice that had
thundered in the darkness roared again and two hundred swords
leapt from their scabbards. Under an arch of blazing steel, in
silence, Yasmini and her chosen husband came to the dais and
stood facing the assembly hand in hand, while the swords went
back to their owners' sides and once more the crowd clustered in
the center of the hall.</p>

<p>There was a movement in among them then. Some servants brought
in baskets, and distributed them at about equal intervals amid
the forest of booted legs. When the servants had left the hall,
Yasmini spoke.</p>

<p>"My Lords, in the presence of you all I vow love, honor,
fealty and a wife's devotion to the prince of my
choosing&mdash;to my husband who shall be&mdash;who now is by
Gandharva ceremony; for I went to him of my own free will by
night! My Lords, I present to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a pause, while every man present caught his breath,
and the women rustled like a dove-cot behind the panel.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Gunga Khatiawara Dhuleep Rhakapushi Utirupa
Singh&mdash; Maharajah of Sialpore!"</p>

<p>Two hundred swords sprang clear again. The chandeliers rattled
and the beams shook to the thunder of two hundred throats.</p>

<p>"Rung Ho!" they roared.</p>

<p>"Rung Ho!"</p>

<p>"Rung Ho!" bringing down their right feet with a stamp all
together that shook the building.</p>

<p>Then the baskets were cut open by the swords' points and they
flung flowers at the dais, swamping it in jasmine and
sweet-smelling buds, until the carpet was not visible. The same
black-bearded veteran who had spoken first mounted the dais and
hung garlands on Yasmini and her prince, and again the hall shook
to the roar of acclamation and the sharp ringing of keen
steel.</p>

<p>But Yasmini had not finished all she had to say. When the
shouting died and the blades returned to scabbards, her voice
again stirred their emotions, strangely quiet and yet reaching
all ears with equal resonance, like the note of a hidden
bell.</p>

<p>"And since, my Lords, in olden days it happened often that a
Rajput woman held and buttressed up her husband's throne,
honoring him and Rajputana with her courage and her wit, and
daring even in the arts of war, so now: this prince shall have
his throne by woman's wit. Before another full moon rises he
shall sit throned in the palace of his ancestors; and ye who love
royal Rajasthan shall answer whether I chose wisely, in the days
to come!"</p>

<p>They answered then and there to the utmost of their lungs. And
while the hall resounded to the crash and clangor of applause she
let go Utirupa's hand, bowed low to him, and vanished through the
gilded door in the midst of her attendant women.</p>

<p>For two hours after that she was the center of a vortex of
congratulation &mdash;questions&mdash;whisperings&mdash;laughter
and advice, while the women flocked about her and she introduced
Tess to them one by one. Tess, hardly understanding a word of
what was said to her, was never made so much of in her life,
sharing honors with Yasmini, almost as much a novelty as she
&mdash;a Western woman, spirited behind the purdah by the same
new alchemy that made a girl of partly foreign birth, and so
without caste in the Hindu sense of it, revive a royal custom
with its antecedents rooted in the very rocks of time. It was a
night of breathless novelty.</p>

<p>There were the inevitable sweetmeats&mdash;the inevitable
sugared drinks. Then the elephants again, and torches under the
mysterious trees, with a sabered escort plunging to the right and
left. The same torch-lit faces peering from the village doors and
walls; and at last the gate again in the garden wall, and a bolt
shot home, and silence. Then:</p>

<p>"Did I do well?" Yasmini asked, leaning at last on Tess. "Oh,
my sister! Without you there to lend me courage I had
failed!"</p> <hr> <br>


<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII.</a><br>

"Suppose I lock the door?"</h2>

<p class="verse">How about the door! Did somebody lock it?<br>

"I," said the Chairman, "had the key in my pocket."<br>

Who shut the windows? "I," said the vice.<br>

"I shut the window, it seemed to me wise."<br>

"I," said the clerk, "looked under the table<br>

And out on the balcony under the gable."<br>

Then who let the secret out? Who overheard?<br>

Maybe a mouse, or the flies, or a bird!</p><br>


<p class="first">Tom Tripe felt like a new man, and his whiskers
crackled with self-satisfaction. For one thing, his dog Trotters
was back again &mdash;sore-footed, it was true, and unable at
present to follow him on his rounds; and rather badly scratched
where a leopard must have missed his spring on the moonlit
desert; but asleep in the stable litter, on the highroad to
recovery.</p>

<p>Tom had ridden that morning, first to Dick Blaine up at the
gold mine, because he was a friend and needed good news of his
wife; then across the bridge to Samson, straightening out the
crumpled letter from Yasmini as he rode, and chuckling to himself
at the thought of mystifying the commissioner. And it all worked
out the way he hoped, even to the offer of a drink&mdash; good
brandy&mdash;Hennesey's Three Star.</p>

<p>"How did you manage it?" asked Samson. "The princess has
disappeared. There's a rumor she's over the border in the next
state. Gungadhura has seized her palace and rifled it. How did
you get my letter to her, and her answer so swiftly?"</p>

<p>"Ah, sir," said Tom Tripe mischievously, "we in the native
service have our little compensations&mdash;our little ways and
means!"</p>

<p>That was better than frankincense and myrrh, to mystify a
genuine commissioner! Tom rode back to his quarters turning over
the taste of brandy in his mouth&mdash;he had made a martial raid
on Samson's tantalus&mdash; and all aglow with good humor.</p>

<p>Not so Samson. The commissioner was irritable, and more so now
that he opened the scented letter Tom had brought. It was deuced
curt, it seemed to him, and veiled a sort of suggested laughter,
if there was anything insinuative in polite phrases.</p>

<p>"The Princess Yasmini Omanoff Singh," it ran, "hastens to
return thanks for Sir Roland Samson's kind letter. She is not,
however, afraid of imprisonment or of undue pressure; and as for
her secret, that is safe as long as the river runs through the
state of Sialpore."</p>

<p>Not a word more. He frowned at the letter, and read and reread
it, sniffing at the scent and holding up the paper to the light,
so that Sita Ram very nearly had a chance to read it through the
knot-hole in the door. The last phrase was the puzzler. It read
at first like a boast&mdash;like one of those picturesque
expressions with which the Eastern mind enjoys to overstate its
case. But he reflected on it. As an Orientalist of admitted
distinction he had long ago concluded that hyperbole in the East
is always based on some fact hidden in the user's mind, often
without the user's knowledge. He had written a paper on that very
subject, which the Spectator printed with favorable editorial
comment; and Mendelsohn K. C. had written him a very agreeable
letter stating that his own experience in criminal cases amply
bore out the theory. He rang the desk bell for Sita Ram.</p>

<p>"Get me the map of the province."</p>

<p>Sita Ram held it by two corners under the draughty punkah
while Samson traced the boundaries with his finger. It was
exactly as he thought: without that little palace and its
grounds, the state of Sialpore would be bounded exactly by the
river. Take away the so-called River Palace with the broad acres
surrounding it, and the river would no longer run through the
state of Sialpore. That would be the end, then, of the safety of
the secret. There was food for reflection there.</p>

<p>What if the famous treasure of Sialpore were buried somewhere
in the grounds of the River Palace! Somewhere, for instance,
among those gigantic pipal trees.</p>

<p>He folded the map and returned it to Sita Ram.</p>

<p>"I'm expecting half a dozen officers presently. Show them in
the minute they come. And&mdash;ah&mdash;you'd better lock that
middle door."</p>

<p>Sita Ram dutifully locked the door on Samson's side, and drew
the curtain over it. There was a small hole in the curtain, of
peculiar shape&mdash; moths had been the verdict when Samson
first noticed it, and Sita Ram had advised him to indent for some
preventive of the pests; which Samson did, and the hole did not
grow any greater afterward.</p>

<p>Samson had had to call a conference, much though he disliked
doing it. The rules for procedure in the case of native states
included the provision of an official known as resident, whose
duty was to live near the native ruler &mdash;and keep a sharp
eye on him. But Samson, prince of indiscretion, had seen fit
three months before to let that official go home to England on
long leave, and to volunteer the double duty in his absence. The
proposal having economic value, and there being no known trouble
in Sialpore just then, the State Department had consented.</p>

<p>The worst of that was that there was no one now in actual
close touch with Gungadhura. The best of it was that there was
none to share the knowledge of Samson's underlying
scheme&mdash;which was after all nothing but to win high laurels
for himself, by somewhat devious ways, perhaps, but justified in
his opinion in the circumstances. And the very worst of it was
that good form and official precedent obliged him to call a
conference before recommending certain drastic action to his
government. Having no official resident to consult, he had to go
through the form of consulting somebody; and the more he called
in, the less likelihood there was of any one man arrogating undue
credit to himself.</p>

<p>They were ushered in presently by Sita Ram. Ross, the
principal medical officer came first; it was a pity he ranked so
high that he could not be overlooked, but there you were. Then
came Sir Hookum Bannerjee, judge of the circuit
court&mdash;likely to have a lot to say without much meaning in
it, and certainly anxious to please. Next after him Sita Ram
showed in Norwood, superintendent of police; one disliked calling
in policemen, they were so interfering and tactless, but Norwood
had his rights. Then came Topham, acting assistant to Samson,
loaned from another state to replace young Wilkinson, home on
sick leave, and full-back on the polo team&mdash;a quiet man as a
rule, anxious to get back to his own district, and probably
reasonably safe. Last came Lieutenant-Colonel Willoughby de
Wing&mdash; small, brusk and florid&mdash;acting in command of
the 88th Sikh Lancers, and preferring that to any other task this
side of heaven or hell;&mdash; "Nothing to do with politics, my
boy,&mdash;not built that way&mdash; don't like 'em&mdash;never
understood 'em anyhow. Soldiering's my business."</p>

<p>It was well understood it was to be a secret conference. The
invitations had been marked "Secret."</p>

<p>"Suppose I lock the door," suggested Samson by way of
additional reminder; and he did that, resuming his chair with an
expression that permitted just the least suggestion of a serious
situation to escape him. But he was smiling amiably, and his
curled mustache did not disguise the corners of a willful
mouth.</p>

<p>"There is proof conclusive," he began, "&mdash;I've telegrams
here that you may see in confidence, that Gungadhura has been
trafficking with Northwest tribes. He has sent them money, and
made them promises. There isn't a shade of doubt of it. The
evidence is black. The question is, what's to be done?"</p>

<p>They passed the telegrams from hand to hand, Norwood looking
rather supercilious. (The police could handle espionage of that
sort so much better.) But it was the youngest man's place to
speak first.</p>

<p>"Depose him, I suppose, and put his young son in his place,"
suggested Topham. "There's plenty of precedent."</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>"I know Gungadhura. He's a bad strain. It's physiological.
I've made a study of these things, and I'm as certain as that I
sit here that any son of Gungadhura's would eventually show the
same traits as his sire. If you can get rid of Gungadhura, get
rid of his whole connection by all means."</p>

<p>"What should be done with the sons, then?" asked Sir Hookum
Bannerjee, father of half a dozen budding lawyers.</p>

<p>"Oh, send 'em to school in England, I suppose," said Samson.
"There's precedent for that too. But there's another point.
Mukhum Dass the money-lender has been foully murdered, struck
down by a knife from behind by some one who relieved him of his
money. Either a case of simply robbery, or else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or else what?" Colonel Willoughby de Wing screwed home his
monocle.</p>

<p>"That's as obvious as twice two. That rascal Mukhum Dass was
bound to die violently sooner or later. He was notoriously the
worst usurer and title-jumper on this side of India. He charged
me once a total of eighty-five per cent. for a small
loan&mdash;and legally, too; kept within the law! I know
him!"</p>

<p>"On the other hand," said Samson, "I've been informed that the
cellar of the house at present occupied by those Americans on the
hill&mdash;the gold-miner, you know&mdash;Blaine&mdash;was
burgled last Sunday morning. Blaine himself complained to me. It
seems that he had given Gungadhura leave to search the cellar, at
Gungadhura's request, for what purpose Blaine professes not to
know. Blaine himself, you may remember, lunched and dined at the
club last Sunday and gave three of us a rather costly lesson in
his national game of poker. It took place while he was with us at
the club. He has been able to discover, by cross-examining some
witnesses&mdash;beggars, I believe, who haunt the
house,&mdash;that Mukhum Dass got to the place ahead of
Gungadhura, burgled the cellar, removed something of great value
to Gungadhura, and went off with it. On the way home he was
murdered."</p>

<p>"The murder of Mukhum Dass was known very soon afterward, of
course, to the police," said Norwood. "But we can't do anything
across the river without orders. Why didn't Mr. Blaine bring his
complaint and evidence to me?"</p>

<p>"Because I asked him not to!" answered Samson. "We're mixed up
here in a political case."</p>

<p>"Damn all politics!" growled Willoughby de Wing.</p>

<p>"If it can be proved that Gungadhura murdered Mukhum Dass, or
caused him to be murdered, I should say arrest him, try the brute
and hang him!" said Topham. "Confound these native princes that
take law into their own hands!"</p>

<p>"I should say, let's prove the case if we can," said Samson,
"and use that for an extra argument to force Gungadhura's
abdication. No need to hang him. If he'd killed a princess, or an
Englishman, we'd be obliged to take extreme measures; but, as De
Wing says, Mukhum Dass was an awful undesirable. If we hanged
Gungadhura, we'd almost have to put one of his five sons on the
throne to succeed him. If be abdicates, we can please ourselves.
I think I can persuade him to abdicate&mdash;if Norwood, for
instance, knows of any way to gather secret evidence about that
murder&mdash;secret, you understand me, Norwood. We need that for
a sword of Damocles."</p>

<p>"Who's to succeed him in that case?" asked Ross, the P. M.
O.</p>

<p>"I shall recommend Utirupa Singh," said Samson, with his eyes
alert.</p>

<p>Ross nodded.</p>

<p>"Utirupa is one of those men who make me think the Rajput race
is not moribund."</p>

<p>"A good clean sportsman!" said Topham. "Plays a red-hot game
of polo, too!"</p>

<p>"Pays up his bets, moreover, like a gentleman!" said Colonel
Willoughby de Wing.</p>

<p>"I feel sure," said Sir Hookum Bannerjee, seeing be was
expected to say something, "that Prince Utirupa Singh would be
acceptable to the Rajputs themselves, who are long weary of
Gungadhura's way. But he is not married. It is a pity always that
a reigning prince should be unmarried; there are so many
opportunities in that case for intrigue, and for mistakes."</p>

<p>"Gad!" exclaimed Willoughby de Wing, dropping his monocle.
"What a chance to marry him to that young Princess
Whatshername&mdash;you know the one I mean&mdash;the one that's
said to masquerade in men's clothes and dance like the devil, and
all that kind of thing. I know nothing of politics, but
&mdash;what a chance!"</p>

<p>"God forbid!" laughed Samson. "That young woman is altogether
too capable of trouble without a throne to play with! I suspect
her, as it happens, of very definite and dangerous intentions
along another line connected with the throne of Sialpore. But I
know how to disappoint her and stop her game. I intend to
recommend&mdash;for the second time, by the way&mdash;that she,
also, should be sent to Europe for a proper education! But the
point I'm driving at is this: are we agreed as to the proper
course to take with Gungadhura?"</p>

<p>They nodded.</p>

<p>"Then, as I see it, there's no desperate hurry. Norwood will
need time to gather evidence; I'll need specific facts, not
hearsay, to ram down Gungadhura's throat. I'll send a wire to the
high commissioner and another to Simla, embodying what we
recommend, and&mdash;what do you say to sending for a battery or
two?"</p>

<p>"Good!" said Willoughby de Wing. "A very good thought indeed!
I know nothing of politics, except this; that there's nothing
like guns to overawe the native mind and convince him that the
game's up! Let's see&mdash;who'd come with the guns? Coburn,
wouldn't he? Yes, Coburn. He's my junior in the service. Yes, a
very good notion indeed. Ask for two batteries by all means."</p>

<p>"I'll tell them not to hurry," said Samson. "It's hot weather.
They can make it in easy stages."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Topham. "They'll be here in time for the polo.
Won't they beef!"</p>

<p>"Talking of polo, who's to captain the other side? Is it known
yet?" asked De Wing.</p>

<p>"Utirupa," answered Topham. "There was never any doubt of
that. We've got Collins to captain us, and Latham and Cartwright,
besides me. We'll give him the game of his life!"</p>

<p>"That settles quite an important point," said Samson. "The
polo tournament &mdash;after it, rather&mdash;is the time to talk
to Utirupa. If we keep quiet until then&mdash;all of us, I
mean&mdash;there'll be no chance of the cat jumping before the
State Department pulls the string. I feel sure, from inside
information, that Headquarters would like nothing known about
this coup d'tat until it's consummated. Explanations afterward,
and the fewer the better! Have a drink anybody?"</p>

<p>In the outer office beyond the curtain Sita Ram cautiously
refitted the knot into its hole, and sat down to write hurriedly
while details were fresh in mind. Ten minutes afterward, when the
conference had broken up in small-talk, he asked permission to
absent himself for an hour or two. He said he had a debt to pay
across the river, to a man whose wife was ill.</p>

<p>One hour and a half later by Sita Ram's wrist watch, Ismail,
an Afridi gate-keeper at present apparently without a job,
started off on a racing camel full-pelt for the border, with a
letter in his pocket addressed to a merchant by way of ostensible
business, and ten rupees for solace to the Desert Police. Tucked
away in the ample folds of his turban was a letter to Yasmini,
giving Sita Ram's accurate account of what had happened at the
secret conference.</p> <hr> <br>

<p class="first">MEANWHILE, Gungadhura was not inactive, nor
without spies of his own, who told him more or less vaguely that
trouble was cooking for him in the English camp. A letter he
expected from the Mahsudi tribe had not reached him. It was the
very letter he had hoped to show to Samson in proof of Mahsudi
villainy and his own friendship; but he rather feared it had
fallen into secret service hands, in which case he might have a
hard time to clear himself.</p>

<p>Then there was the murder of Mukhum Dass. He had not been able
to resist that opportunity, when Patali reported to him what
Mukhum Dass had been seen to make away with. And now he had the
secret of the treasure in his possession&mdash;implicit
directions, and a map! He suspected they had been written by some
old priest, or former rajah's servant, in the hope of a chance
for treachery, and hidden away by Jengal Singh with the same
object. There were notes on the margins by Jengal Singh. The
thing was obviously genuine. But the worst of it was Patali knew
all about it now, and that cursed idiot Blaine had complained to
Samson of burglary, after he learned that the cellar door was
broken open by the money-lender. Why hadn't he come to himself,
he wondered, and been satisfied with a string of promises? That
would have been the courteous thing to do. Instead of that, now
Samson's spies were nosing about, and only the gods knew what
they might discover. The man who had done the murder was safely
out of the way&mdash;probably in Delhi by that time, or on his
way there; but that interfering ass Norwood might be awake for
once, and if the murderer should happen to get caught, and should
confess&mdash;as hired murderers do sometimes&mdash;it would need
an awful lot of expert lying and money, too, to clear
himself.</p>

<p>With funds&mdash;ample extravagant supplies of ready cash, he
felt he could even negotiate the awkward circumstance that he
himself was deeply in debt to Mukhum Dass at the time of the
murder. Money and brains combined can accomplish practically
anything. Delhi and Bombay and Calcutta were full of clever
lawyers. The point was, he must hurry. And he did not dare trust
any one with knowledge of his secret, except Patali, who had
wormed out some and guessed the rest, because of the obvious risk
of Samson getting wind of it through spies and so forestalling
him. He felt he had Samson's character estimated nicely.</p>

<p>Arguing with himself&mdash;distracted between fear on one
hand, and Patali's importunity on the other, he reached the
conclusion that Dick Blaine was his only safe reliance. The
American seemed to have an obsession for written contracts, and
for enforcing the last letter of them. Well and good, he would
make another contract with Dick Blaine, and told Patali so, she
agreeing that the American was the safest tool to use. She saw
herself already with her arms up to the shoulders in the treasure
of Sialpore.</p>

<p>"The American has few friends," she said. "He smokes a pipe,
and thinks, and now that they say his wife has gone away there is
less chance than ever of his talking."</p>

<p>"He will need to be paid," said Gungadhura.</p>

<p>"There will be plenty to pay him with!" she answered, her eyes
gleaming.</p>

<p>So Gungadhura, with his face still heavily bandaged, drove in
a lumbering closed carriage up the rough track to the tunnel Dick
had blasted in the hill-side. The carriage could not go close to
the tunnel-mouth, because the track was only wide enough just
there for the dump-carts to come and go. So he got out and walked
into the tunnel unattended. Dick was used to seeing him about the
works in any case and never objected to explaining things,
several times over on occasion.</p>

<p>He found Dick superintending the careful erection of a wall of
rock and cement, and he thought for an instant that the American
looked annoyed to see him there. But Dick assumed his poker
expression the moment afterward, and you couldn't have guessed
whether he was glad or sorry.</p>

<p>"You block the tunnel?" the maharajah asked.</p>

<p>"The vein's disappeared," said Dick. "The rock's all faulty
here this and that way. I'm shoring up the end to keep the roof
from falling down on us, and next I'm going to turn sharp at
right angles and try to find the end of the vein where it broke
off."</p>

<p>"You are too near the fort in any case," said the maharajah.
"No use driving under the fort."</p>

<p>"What do you propose I should do?" Dick answered a trifle
testily.</p>

<p>"Dig elsewhere."</p>

<p>"What, and scrap this outlay?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have a reason. A
particular&mdash;eh&mdash;reason."</p>

<p>Dick nodded, poker face set solid.</p>

<p>The maharajah paused. His advantage was that his face was all
smothered in the bandages, and the dim light in the tunnel was
another good ally. His back, too, was toward the entrance, so
that the American's chance of reading between the words was
remarkably slight. Dick's back was against the uncompleted
masonry.</p>

<p>"Could I&mdash;eh&mdash;count on you for&mdash;eh&mdash;very
absolute silence?"</p>

<p>"I talk like that parrot in the story," Dick answered.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;eh&mdash;know a little now of Sialpore, Mr. Blaine.
You &mdash;eh&mdash;understand how easily&mdash;eh&mdash;rumors
get about. A little&mdash;eh&mdash;foundation
and&mdash;eh&mdash;up-side-down pyramids of fancy&mdash;eh? You
comprehend me?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I get you."</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;you have a good working party."</p>

<p>"Fine!" said Dick. "Just about broke in. Got the gang working
pretty well to rights at last."</p>

<p>"Would you&mdash;eh&mdash;it would take a long time to get
such another party of laborers&mdash;eh&mdash;trained to work
well and swiftly?"</p>

<p>"Months!" said Dick. "Unless you've got tame wizards up your
sleeve."</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;I was wondering&mdash;eh&mdash;whether you would be
content to&mdash;eh&mdash;take your working party
and&mdash;eh&mdash; do a little work for me elsewhere?"</p>

<p>"I'm right set on puzzling out this fault in the reef," Dick
answered promptly. "My contract reads&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For compensation, of course," said Gungadhura. "You would be
adequately &mdash;eh&mdash;there could be a contract drawn."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't cancel this one&mdash;not for hard cash," Dick
retorted.</p>

<p>"No, no. I do not ask that. It would&mdash;eh&mdash;not be
necessary."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what's the proposal?"</p>

<p>Dick settled himself back against the masonry crossed his
feet, and knocked out ashes from his pipe. The maharajah walked
twice, ten yards toward the entrance and back again.</p>

<p>"How long would it take
you&mdash;eh&mdash;to&mdash;eh&mdash;what was it you
said?&mdash;to puzzle out this fault?"</p>

<p>"No knowing."</p>

<p>"A short&mdash;eh&mdash;additional delay will hardly
matter?"</p>

<p>"Not if I kept the gang in harness. 'Twouldn't pay to let the
team-work slide. Costs too much in time and trouble to break 'em
in again."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;eh&mdash;will you go and dig for me
elsewhere?"</p>

<p>"On what terms?"</p>

<p>"The same terms."</p>

<p>"You pay all expenses and&mdash;what am I to dig for?"</p>

<p>"Gold!"</p>

<p>"Do I get my percentage of the gross of all gold won?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But because this is a certainty and&mdash;eh&mdash;I pay
all expenses&mdash;eh&mdash;of course, in&mdash;eh&mdash;return
for secrecy you&mdash;eh&mdash;should be well paid,
but&mdash;eh&mdash;a certain stated sum should be sufficient, or
a much smaller percentage."</p>

<p>"Suppose we get down to figures?" Dick suggested.</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand rupees, or one per cent."</p>

<p>"At my option?"</p>

<p>Gungadhura nodded. Dick whistled.</p>

<p>"There'd have to be a time limit. I can't stay and dig forever
for a matter of fifty thousand dibs."</p>

<p>Gungadhura grew emphatic at that point, using both clenched
fists to beat the air.</p>

<p>"Time limit? There must be no time lost at all! Have you
promised to be silent? Have you promised not to breathe one
little word to anybody?&mdash; Not to your own wife? Not to
Samson?&mdash;Above all not to Samson? Then I will tell you."</p>

<p>Gungadhura glanced about him like a stage conspirator.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Dick. "There's nobody here knows English except
you and me."</p>

<p>"You are to dig for the treasure of Sialpore! The treasure of
my ancestors!"</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand dibs&mdash;or one per cent. at my option, eh?
Make it two per cent., and draw your contract!"</p>

<p>"Two per cent. is too much!"</p>

<p>"Get another man to dig, then!"</p>

<p>"Very well, I make it two per cent. But you must hurry!"</p>

<p>"Draw your contract. Time limit how long?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks&mdash;three weeks&mdash;not more than a month at
the very utmost! You draw the contract in English, and I will
sign it this afternoon. You must begin to dig tomorrow at
dawn!"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the grounds of the River Palace&mdash;across the
river&mdash; beginning close to the great pipal trees."</p>

<p>"They're all outside the palace wall. How in thunder can I
keep secret about that?"</p>

<p>"You must begin inside the palace wall, and tunnel
underground."</p>

<p>"Dirt's all soft down there," said Dick. "We'll need to prop
up as we go. Lots of lumber. Cost like blazes. Where's the lumber
coming from?"</p>

<p>"Cut down the pipal trees!"</p>

<p>"Man&mdash;we'd need a mill!"</p>

<p>"There is no lumber&mdash;not in such a hurry."</p>

<p>"What'll we do then? Can't have accidents."</p>

<p>"Pah! The lives of a few coolies, Mr. Blaine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, Maharajah sahib! Murder's not my long
suit."</p>

<p>"Then pull the palace down and use the beams!"</p>

<p>"You'd have to put that in writing."</p>

<p>"Include it in the contract then! Now, have we agreed?"</p>

<p>"I guess so. If I think of anything else I'll talk it over
with you when I bring the contract round this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Good. Then I will give you the map."</p>

<p>"Better give it me now, so I can study it."</p>

<p>"The&mdash;eh&mdash;risk of that is too great, Mr.
Blaine!"</p>

<p>"Seems to me your risk is pretty heavy as it is," Dick
retorted. "If I was going to spill your secret, I could do it
now, map or no map!"</p>

<p>Three times again Gungadhura paced the tunnel, torn between
mistrust, impatience and anxiety. At last he thrust his bandaged
face very close to Dick's and spoke in a level hard voice,
smiling thinly.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Blaine. I will entrust the map to you. But let
me first tell you certain things&mdash;certain quite true things.
Every attempt to steal that treasure has ended in ill-luck! There
have been many. All the conspirators have died&mdash;by
poison&mdash;by dagger&mdash;by the sword&mdash;by
snake-bite&mdash;by bullets&mdash;they have all died
&mdash;always! Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Dick shuddered in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"Then take the map!"</p>

<p>Gungadhura turned his back and fumbled in the folds of his
semi-European clothing. He produced the silver tube after a
minute, removed the cap from one end, and shook out a piece of
parchment. There was a dull crimson stain on it.</p>

<p>"The blood of a man who tried to betray the secret!" said
Gungadhura. "See-the knife of an assassin pierced the tube, and
blood entered through the hole. It happened long ago."</p>

<p>But he did not pass the tube to Dick that he might examine the
knife mark.</p>

<p>"These notes on the edge of the map are probably in the hand
of Jengal Singh, who stole it. He died of snake-bite more than a
year ago. They are in Persian; he notes that four of the trees
are dead and only their roots remain; therefore that measurements
must allow for that. You must find the roots of the last tree,
Mr. Blaine, and measure carefully from both ends, digging
afterward in a straight line from inside the palace wall by
compass. Is it clear?"</p>

<p>"I guess so. Leave it with me and I'll study it."</p>

<p>The maharajah kept the tube and left the parchment in Dick's
hands.</p>

<p>"This afternoon, then?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon," said Dick.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Dick resumed the very careful building of
the masonry, placing the last stones with his own hands. Then he
went out into the sunlight, to sit on a rock and examine the
parchment with a little pocket magnifying-glass that he always
carried for business purposes. He studied it for ten minutes.</p>

<p>"It's clever," he said at last. "Dashed clever. It 'ud fool
the Prince of Wales!" (Dick had astonishing delusions as to the
supposed omniscience of the heir to the throne of England.) "The
ink looks old, and it's not metallic ink. The parchment's as old
as Methuselah&mdash;I'll take my oath on that. There's even
different ink been used for the map and the margin notes. But
that's new blood or my name's Mike! That blood's not a week old!
Phew! I bet it's that poor devil Mukhum Dass! Now&mdash;let's
figure on this: Mukhum Dass burgled my house, and was murdered
about an hour afterward. I think &mdash;I can't swear, because he
didn't let me hold it, but I think that tube in Gungadhura's hand
was the very identical one that I hid under the cellar
floor&mdash;that Mukhum Dass stole&mdash;and that the maharajah
now carries in his pocket. This map has blood on it. What's the
inference?"</p>

<p>He filled his pipe and smoked reflectively.</p>

<p>"The inference is, that I'm accessory after the fact to the
money-lender's murder, unless" -</p>

<p>He finished the pipe, and knocked the ashes out.</p>

<p>"&mdash;unless I break my promise, and hand this piece of
evidence over to Norwood. I guess he's arch-high-policeman
here."</p>

<p>As if the guardian angel of Dick's conscience was at work that
very minute to torment him, there came the sound of an
approaching horse, and Samson turned the corner into view.</p>

<p>"Oh, hullo, Blaine! How's the gold developing?"</p>

<p>"So-so. Have they found the murderer of Mukhum Dass yet?"</p>

<p>Samson dropped his reins to light a cigar, and took his time
about it.</p>

<p>"Not exactly."</p>

<p>"Hum! You either exactly find the murderer, or you don't!"</p>

<p>"We've our suspicions."</p>

<p>"Leading anywhere?"</p>

<p>"Too soon to say."</p>

<p>"If I was to offer to put you next to a piece of pretty
evidence, how'd that suit you?"</p>

<p>Samson had to relight the cigar, in order to get opportunity
to read Dick's face before he answered.</p>

<p>"I don't think so, Blaine, thank you&mdash;at least not at
present. If you've direct evidence of an eye-witness, of
course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing like that," said Dick.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be candid with you, Blaine. We know quite well who
the murderer is. At the right moment we shall land on him hammer
and tongs. But you see&mdash;we need to choose the right moment,
for political reasons. Now&mdash;technically speaking&mdash;all
evidence in criminal cases ought to go to the police, and the
police might act too hastily&mdash;you understand me?"</p>

<p>"If you know who the man is, of course," said Dick, "there's
nothing more I need do."</p>

<p>"Except to be discreet, Blaine! Please be discreet! We shall
get the man. Don't doubt it! You and your wife have set us all an
example here of minding nobody's business except your own. I'd be
awfully obliged if you'd keep yourself as far as possible out of
this mess. Should we need any further evidence than we've got
already, I'd ask you for it, of course."</p>

<p>"Suits me all right," said Dick. "I'm mum."</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, Blaine. Can I offer you a cigar? I'm on my
way to take a look at the fort. Seems like an anachronism,
doesn't it, for us to keep an old-fashioned fort like this so
near our own border in native territory. Care to come with me?
Well, so long then&mdash;see you at the club again, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>Samson rode on.</p>

<p>"A narrow squeak that!" said Dick to himself, stowing away the
map that he had held the whole time in his right hand in full
view of the commissioner.</p> <hr> <br>

&mdash;The East to Columbia</p><br>


<p class="first">TESS was in something very near to paradise, if
paradise is constant assuaging of the curiosity amid surroundings
that conduce to idleness. There were men on that country-side in
plenty who would not have dared admit a Western woman into their
homes; but even those could hardly prevent wives and daughters
from visiting Yasmini in the perfectly correct establishment she
kept. And there were other men, more fearless of convention, who
were willing that Tess, if veiled, should cross their private
thresholds.</p>

<p>So there followed a round of visits and return calls, of other
marvelous rides by elephant at night, because the daytime was too
hot for comfort, and oftener, long drives in latticed carriages,
with footmen up behind and an escort to ride before and swear at
the lethargic bullock-men&mdash; carriages that bumped along the
country roads on strange, old-fashioned springs.</p>

<p>Yasmini was welcome everywhere, and, in the cautious, tenfold
guarded Eastern way, kept open house. The women reveled in her
free ideas and in the wit with which she heaped scorn on the
priest-made fashions that have kept all India in chains for
centuries, mocking the priests, as some thought, at the risk of
blasphemy.</p>

<p>Almost as much as in Yasmini's daring they took ingenuous
delight in Tess, persuading Yasmini to interpret questions and
reply or, very rarely, bringing with them some duenna who had a
smattering of English.</p>

<p>All imprisoned folk, and especially women in the shuttered
zenanas of the East, develop a news-sense of their own that
passes the comprehension of free-ranging mortals. They were
astonishingly well informed about the outer world&mdash;even the
far-flung outer world, yet asked the most childish questions; and
only a few of them could have written their own names,&mdash;
they who were titled ladies of a land of ancient chivalry.</p>

<p>"Wait until I am maharani!" Yasmini said. "The women have
always ruled India. Women rule the English, though the English
hate the thought of it and make believe otherwise. With the aid
of women I will change the face of India,&mdash;the women and the
gods!"</p>

<p>But she was careful of her promises, holding out no prospects
that would stir premature activity among the ranks she counted
on.</p>

<p>"Promise the gods too much," she said, "and the gods overwhelm
you. They like to serve, which is their business, not to have you
squandering on them. Tell the women they are rulers, and they
will start to destroy their empire by making public what is
secret! If you tell the men that the women rule them, what will
the men do?"</p>

<p>"Shut them up all the closer, I suppose," suggested Tess.</p>

<p>"Is that what they ever did? No. They will choose for them
certain offices they can not fill because of inexperience, and
put the noisiest women in them, and make mock of them, and laugh!
Not for a long time yet must India know who rules her!"</p>

<p>"Child, where did you learn all your philosophy?" Tess asked
her, one night when they were watching the stars from the bedroom
window-seat.</p>

<p>"Oh, men taught me this and that thing, and I have always
reversed it and believed the opposite. Why do men teach? To make
you free, or to bind you to their own wheel? The English teach
that English ways are good for the world. I answer that the world
has been good to England and the English would like to keep it
so! The pundits say we should study the philosophies. They made
me study, hours and hours when I was little. Why? To bind me to
the wheel of their philosophy, and keep me subject to them! I say
philosophy is good for pundits, as a pond is good for frogs; but
shall I be a frog, too, and croak about the beauties of the mud?
The priests say we should obey them, and pray, and make
offerings, and keep the religious law. I say, that religion is
good for priests, which is why they cherish it, and add to it,
and persuade foolish women to believe it! As for the gods, if
they are anything they are our servants!"</p>

<p>"Your husband is going to have an interesting time," laughed
Tess.</p>

<p>Yasmini's blue eyes suddenly turned soft and serious.</p>

<p>"Do you think I can not be a wife " she asked. "Do you suppose
there is no mother-love in me? Do you think I do not understand
how a man needs cherishing? Do you think I will preach to my
husband, or oppose his plans? No! I will do as the gods do when
the priests are asleep! I will let him go his own way, and will
go with him, never holding back; and little by little he will
learn that I have understanding. Little by little he will grow
into knowledge of the things I know&mdash;and he will be a very
great man!"</p>

<p>There were no visits whatever from Utirupa, for the
country-side would have been scandalized. Only, flowers came
every day in enormous quantities; and there was a wealth of
horses, carriages, jewels and armed men at his bride's disposal
that proved he had not forgotten her existence or her needs. She
had claimed marriage to him by Gandharva rite, and he had tacitly
consented, but she was not ready yet to try conclusions with the
secret, octopus influence of the priests; and there was another
reason.</p>

<p>"If it should get to Samson's cars that he and I are married,
that would be the end of his chance of the throne of Sialpore.
Samson is English of the English. He would oppose to the end the
nomination of a maharajah, whose wife has notions of her
own&mdash;as I am known to have! They like him&mdash; my
husband&mdash;because he plays good polo, and will bet with them,
and can play cricket; and because he seems to follow no special
line of politics. But if it were known he had a clever
wife&mdash;me for wife&mdash;they would have none of him! I shall
be a surprise for them when the die is cast!"</p>

<p>Tess was in almost daily communication with Dick, for, what
with Tom Tripe and Sita Ram and about a dozen other sworn
accomplices, Yasmini had messages coming and going all the time.
Camels used to arrive long after dark, and letters were brought
in, smelly with the sweat of loyal riders who had hidden them
from too inquisitive police. Most of them carried back a
scribbled word for Dick. But he said nothing about the treasure
in his curt, anonymous, unsigned replies, being nervous about
sending messages at all.</p>

<p>Only, when in one letter he mentioned digging in another
place, and Tess read the sentence aloud, Yasmini squealed with
delight. The next day her own advices confirmed the hint, Sita
Ram sending a long account of new developments and adding that
"Samson sahib is much exercised in mind about it."</p>

<p>"All goes well!" Yasmini belled in her golden voice. "Samson
has seen the hidden meaning of my letter! If I had told him
bluntly where the treasure is, he would have laughed and
forgotten it! But because he thinks he reads the secret of my
mind, he flatters himself and falls into the trap! Now we have
Samson caught, and all is well!"</p>

<p>"It would be a very canny person who could read the secret of
your mind, I should say!" laughed Tess.</p>

<p>"I am as simple as the sunlight!" Yasmini answered honestly.
"It is Samson who is dark, not I."</p>

<p>Yasmini began making ready for departure, giving a thousand
orders to dependents she could trust.</p>

<p>"At the polo game," she asked Tess, "when the English ask
questions as to where you have been, and what you saw, what will
you tell them?"</p>

<p>"Why not the truth? Samson expressly asked me to cultivate
your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Splendid! Tell them you traveled on camel-back by night
across the desert with me! By the time they have believed that we
will think of more to add to it! We return by elephant to
Sialpore together, timing our arrival for the polo game. There we
separate. You watch the game together with your husband. I shall
be in a closed carriage&mdash;part of the time. I shall be there
all the time, but I don't think you will see me."</p>

<p>"But you say they have rifled your palace. Where will you
sleep?" Tess asked.</p>

<p>"At your house on the hill!"</p>

<p>"But that is in Gungadhura's territory. Aren't you afraid of
him?"</p>

<p>"Of Gungadhura? I? I never was! But now whoever fears him
would run from a broken snake. I have word that the fool has
murdered Mukhum Dass the money-lender. You may trust the English
to draw his teeth nicely for him after that! Gungadhura is like a
tiger in a net he can not break!"</p>

<p>"He might send men to break into the house," Tess argued.</p>

<p>"There will be sharper eyes than any of his watching!"</p>

<p>But Tess was alarmed at the prospect. She did not mind in the
least what the English might have to say about it afterward; but
to have her little house the center of nocturnal feuds, with her
husband using his six-shooters, and heaven only knew what
bloodshed resulting, was more of a prospect than she looked
forward to.</p>

<p>"Sister," said Yasmini, taking her by both hands. "I must use
your house. There is no other place."</p>

<p>No one could refuse her when her deep blue eyes grew soft and
pleading, let alone Tess, who had lived with her and loved her
for a week.</p>

<p>"Very well," she answered; and Yasmini's eyes softened and
brightened even more.</p>

<p>"I shall not forget!"</p>

<p>Getting ready was no child's play. It was to be a leisurely
procession in the olden style, with tents, servants, and all the
host of paraphernalia and hangers-on that that entails; not
across the desert this time, but around the edge of it, the way
the polo ponies went, and out of Gungadhura's reach. For, however
truly Yasmini might declare that she was not afraid of Gungadhura
(and she vowed she never boasted), she was running no unnecessary
risks; it takes a long time for the last rats to desert a sinking
ship, (the obstinate go down with it), and just as long for the
last assassins to change politics. She was eager to run all the
risks when that was the surest strategy, but cautious
otherwise.</p>

<p>The secret of her safety lay in the inviolable privacy
surrounding woman's life in all that part of India&mdash;privacy
that the English have respected partly because of their own
inherent sense of personal retirement, partly because it was the
easiest way and saved trouble; but mainly because India's women
have no ostensible political power, and there is politics enough
without bringing new millions more potential agitators into
light. So word of her life among the women did not travel swiftly
to official ears, as that of a male intriguer would certainly
have done. Utirupa was busy all day long with polo, and the
Powers that Be were sure of it, and pleased. What Gungadhura
knew, or guessed, was another matter; but Gungadhura had his own
hands full just then.</p>

<p>So they formed part of a procession that straggled along the
miles, of elephants, camels and groups of ponies, carts loaded
with tents, chattering servants, parties of Rajput gentlemen,
beggars, hangers-on, retainers armed with ancient swords,
mountebanks, several carriage-loads of women, who could sing and
dance and were as particular about their veiling as if Lalun were
not their ancestress, the inevitable fakirs, camel-loads of
entertainers, water-carriers, sheep, asses, and bullock-drawn,
squeaking two-wheeled carts aburst with all that men and animals
could eat. Three days and nights of circus life, as Tess
described it afterward to Dick.</p>

<p>Yasmini and Tess rode part of the way on an elephant, lying
full-length in the hooded howdah with a view of all the
country-side, starting before dawn and resting through the long
heat of the day. But monotony formed no part of Yasmini's scheme
of life, and daring was the very breath she breathed. Most of the
time they rode horseback together, disguised as men and taking to
the fields whenever other parties drew too close. But sometimes
Yasmini left Tess on the elephant, and mingled freely with the
crowd, her own resourcefulness and intimate knowledge of the
language and the customs enough protection.</p>

<p>Nights were the amazing time. A great camp spread out under
ancient trees &mdash;bonfires glowing everywhere, and native
followers squatted around them,&mdash;long, whinnying
horse-lines&mdash;elephants, great gurgling shadows, swaying at
their pickets&mdash;shouting, laughter, music,&mdash;and, over
all, soft purple darkness and the stars.</p>

<p>For it was something more than a mere polo tournament that
they were traveling to. It had grown out of a custom abolished by
the government, of traveling once a year to Sialpore to air and
consider grievances&mdash;a custom dating from long before the
British occupation, when the princes of the different states were
all in rival camps and that was about the only opportunity to
meet on reasonably friendly terms. In later years it had looked
like developing into a focus of political solidity; so some
ingenious commissioner had introduced the polo element,
eliminating, item after item, all the rest. Then the date had
been changed to the early hot weather, in order to reduce
attendance; but the only effect that had was to keep away the
English from outlying provinces. It was the one chance that part
of Rajputana had to get together, and the Rajputs swarmed to the
tournament&mdash;along the main trunk road that the English had
reconstructed in early days for the swifter movement of their
guns. (It did not follow any particular trade route, although
trade had found its way afterward along it.)</p>

<p>Yasmini saw Utirupa every night, she apparently as much a man
as he in turban and the comfortable Rajput costume&mdash;shorter
by a bead, but as straight-standing and as agile. Tess and
Hasamurti used to watch them under the trees, ready to give the
alarm in case of interruption, sometimes near enough to catch the
murmured flow of confidence uniting them in secrecy of sacred,
unconforming interviews. It was common knowledge that Yasmini was
in the camp, but she was always supposed to be tented safely on
the outskirts, with her women and a guard of watchful servants
all about her. There was no risk of an affront to her in any
case; it was known that Utirupa would attend to that.</p>

<p>Each night between the bonfires there was
entertainment&mdash;men who walked tight-ropes, wrestlers, a
performing horse, ballad-singers and, dearest delight of all, the
tellers of Eastern tales, who sat with silent rings of men about
them and reeled off the old, loved, impossible adventures of the
days when the gods walked with men on earth&mdash;stories of
miracles and love and derring-do, with heroes who could fight a
hundred men unscathed, and heroines to set the heart on fire.</p>

<p>Then off again before sunrise in the cool amid the shouting
and confusion of a breaking camp, with truant ponies to be
hunted, and everybody yelling for his right of road, and the
elephants sauntering urbanely through it all with trunks alert
for pickings from the hay-carts. They were nights and days
superbly gorgeous, all-entertaining, affluent of humor.</p>

<p>Then on the third day, nearing Sialpore toward evening they
filed past two batteries of Royal Horse Artillery, drawn up on a
level place beside the road to let them by&mdash;an act of
courtesy not unconnected with its own reward. It is never a bad
plan to let the possibly rebellious take a long look at the
engines of enforcement.</p>

<p>"Ah!" laughed Yasmini, up in the howdah now beside Tess on the
elephant, "the guns of the gods! I said the gods were helping
us!"</p>

<p>"Look like English guns to me," Tess answered.</p>

<p>"So think the English, too. So thinks Samson who sent for
them. So, too, perhaps Gungadhura will think when he knows the
guns are coming! But I know better. I never promise the gods too
much, but let them make me promises, and look on while they
perform them. I tell you, those are the guns of the gods!"</p>

<p class="first">THE business of getting a maharajah off the
throne, even in a country where the overlords are nervous, and
there is precedent, is not entirely simple, especially when the
commissioner who recommends it has a name for indiscretion and
ambition. The government of conquered countries depends almost as
much on keeping clever administrators in their place as on
fostering subdivision among the conquered.</p>

<p>So, very much against his will, Samson was obliged to go to
see a high commissioner, who is a very important person indeed,
and ram home his arguments between four walls by word of mouth.
He did not take Sita Ram with him, so there is a gap in the story
at that point, partly bridged by Samson's own sketchy account of
the interview to Colonel Willoughby de Wing, overheard by Carlos
de Sousa Braganza the Goanese club butler, and reported to
Yasmini at third hand.</p>

<p>There were no airplanes or official motor-cars at that time to
take officials at outrageous speed on urgent business. But
Samson's favorite study in his spare time was Julius Caesar, who
usually traveled long distances at the rate of more than a
hundred miles a day, and was probably short-winded from debauch
into the bargain. What the great Julius could do, Samson could do
as well; but in spite of whip and spur and post, ruthless robbery
of other people's reserved accommodation, and a train caught by
good luck on the last stage, it took him altogether seven
valuable days and nights. For there was delay, too, while the
high commissioner wired to Simla in code for definite permission
to be drastic.</p>

<p>The telegram from the secretary of state pointed out, as
Samson had predicted that it would, the desirability of avoiding
impeachment and trial if that were possible, in view of the state
of public unrest in India and the notorious eagerness of
Parliament at home to interfere in Indian affairs.</p>

<p>"Get him to abdicate!" was the meat of the long message.</p>

<p>"Can you do it?" asked the high commissioner.</p>

<p>"Leave that to me!" boasted Samson. "And now this other
matter. These 'islands' as they're called. It's absurd and
expensive to continue keeping up a fort inside the maharajah's
territory. There's no military advantage to us in having it so
near our border. And there are totally unnecessary problems of
administration that are entailed by the maharajah administering a
small piece of territory on our side of the river. I've had a
contract drawn for your approval&mdash;Sir Hookum Bannerjee drew
it, he's a very able lawyer &mdash;stipulating with Utirupa, in
consideration of our recognition of himself and his heirs as
rulers of the State of Sialpore, that he shall agree to exchange
his palace and land on our side of the river against our fort on
his side. What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"It isn't a good bargain. He ought to give us more than that
in the circumstances, against a fort and&mdash;and all that kind
of thing."</p>

<p>"It's a supremely magnificent bargain!" retorted Samson.
"Altogether overlooking what we'll save in money by not having to
garrison that absurd fort, it's the best financial bargain this
province ever had the chance of!"</p>

<p>"How d'ye mean?"</p>

<p>Samson whispered. Even those four solid walls were not
discreet enough.</p>

<p>"The treasure of Sialpore is buried in the River Palace
grounds! Millions! Think of it&mdash;Millions! Lakhs and
crores!"</p>

<p>The high commissioner whistled.</p>

<p>"That 'ud mean something to the province, wouldn't it! Show me
your proofs."</p>

<p>How Samson got around the fact that he had no actually
definite proofs, he never told. But he convinced the high
commissioner, who never told either, unless to somebody at Simla,
who buried the secret among the State Department files.</p>

<p>"I'll wire Simla," said the high commissioner presently, "for
permission to authorize you to set your signature to that
contract on behalf of government. The minute I get it I'll wire
you to Sialpore and confirm by letter. Now you'd better get back
to your post in a hurry. And don't forget, it would be difficult
in a case like this to err on the side of silence, Samson. Who'll
have to be told?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but Willoughby de Wing. I'll have to ask him for
troops to guard the River Palace grounds. There's a confounded
American digging this minute in the River Palace grounds by
arrangement with Gungadhura. He'll have to be stopped, and I'll
have to make some sort of explanation."</p>

<p>"What's an American doing in Sialpore?"</p>

<p>"Prospecting. Has a contract with Gungadhura."</p>

<p>"Um-m-m! We'll have Standard Oil in next! Better point out to
Utirupa that contracts with foreigner's aren't regarded
cordially."</p>

<p>"That's easily done," said Samson. "Utirupa is nothing if not
anxious to please."</p>

<p>"Yes, Utirupa is a very fine young fellow&mdash;and a good
sportsman, too, I'm told."</p>

<p>"There is no reason why Utirupa should recognize the contract
between Gungadhura and the American. It was a private
contract&mdash;no official sanction. If Gungadhura isn't in
position to continue it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Well&mdash;good-by. I'll look forward to a good
report from you."</p>

<p>By train and horse and tonga Samson contrived to reach
Sialpore on the morning before the day set for the polo
tournament. He barely allowed himself time to shave before going
to see Dick Blaine, and found him, as he expected, at the end of
the tunnel nearly a hundred yards long that started from inside
the palace wall and passed out under it. The guards at the gate
did not dare refuse the commissioner admission. So far, Dick had
not begun demolition of the palace, but had dragged together
enough lumber by pulling down sheds and outhouses. He was not a
destructive-minded man.</p>

<p>"Will you come outside and talk with me?" Samson shouted, amid
the din of pick and shovel work.</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>Dick's poker face was in perfect working order by the time
they reached the light. But he stood with his back to the sun and
let Samson have the worst of the position.</p>

<p>"You're wasting time and money, Blaine. I've come to tell you
so."</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;that's good of you."</p>

<p>"Your contract with Gungadhura is not worth the paper it's
written on."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"He will not be maharajah after noon today!"</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!"</p>

<p>"That information is confidential, but the news will be out by
tomorrow. The British Administration intends to take over all the
land on this side of the river. That's confidential too. Between
you and me, our government would never recognize a contract
between you and Gungadhura. I warned you once, and your wife a
second time."</p>

<p>"Sure, she told me."</p>

<p>"Well. You and I have been friends, Blaine. I'd like you to
regard this as not personal. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I get you. I'm to call the men off? That it?"</p>

<p>"You've only until tomorrow in any case."</p>

<p>"And Gungadhura, broke, to look to for the pay-roll!
Well&mdash;as you say, what's the use?"</p>

<p>"I'd pay your men off altogether, if I were you."</p>

<p>"They're a good gang."</p>

<p>"No doubt. We've all admired your ability to make men work.
But there'll be a new maharajah in a day or two, and, strictly
between you and me, as one friend to another, there'll be a very
slight chance indeed of your getting a contract from the incoming
man to carry on your mining in the hills. I'd like to save you
trouble and expense."</p>

<p>"Real good of you."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;found anything down there?" Samson nodded over his
shoulder toward the tunnel mouth.</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Any signs of anything?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>Samson looked relieved.</p>

<p>"By the way. You mentioned the other day something about
evidence relating to the murder of Mukhum Dass."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Was it anything important?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. Looked so to me."</p>

<p>"Would you mind giving me an outline of it?"</p>

<p>"You said that day you knew who murdered Mukhum Dass?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When I got in this morning there was a note on my desk
from Norwood, the superintendent of police, to say that they've
arrested your butler and cook, and the murderer of Mukhum Dass
all hiding together near a railway station. The murderer has
squealed, as you Americans say. They often do when they're
caught. He has told who put him up to it."</p>

<p>"Guess I'll give you this, then. It's the map out of the
silver tube that Mukhum Dass burgled from my cellar. Gungadhura
gave it to me with instructions to dig here. You'll note there's
blood on it."</p>

<p>Samson's eyes looked hardly interested as he took it. Then he
looked, and they blazed. He put it in his inner pocket
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Too bad, Blaine!" he laughed. "So you even had a map of the
treasure, eh? Another day or two and you'd have forestalled us! I
suppose you'd a contract with Gungadhura for a share of it?"</p>

<p>"You bet!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it wasn't registered. I doubt if you could have
enforced it. Gungadhura is an awful rascal."</p>

<p>"Gee!" lied Dick. "I never thought of that! I had my other
contract registered all right&mdash;in your office&mdash;you
remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I warned you at the time about Gungadhura."</p>

<p>"You did. I remember now. You did. Well, I suppose the wife
and I'll be heading for the U. S. A. soon, richer by the
experience. Still&mdash;I reckon I'll wait around and see the new
maharajah in the saddle, and watch what comes of it."</p>

<p>"You've no chance, Blaine, believe me!"</p>

<p>"All right, I'll think it over. Meanwhile, I'll whistle off
these men."</p>

<p>The next man Samson interviewed was Willoughby de Wing.</p>

<p>"Let me have a commissioner's escort, please," he demanded.
"I'm going to see Gungadhura now! You'd better follow up with a
troop to replace the maharajah's guards around his palace. We
can't put him under arrest without impeaching him; but&mdash;make
it pretty plain to the guard they're there to protect a man who
has abdicated; that no one's to be allowed in, and nobody out
unless he can explain his business. Then, can you spare some
guards for another job? I want about twenty men on the River
Palace at once. Caution them carefully. Nobody's to go inside the
grounds. Order the maharajah's guards away! It's a little
previous. His officers will try to make trouble of course. But an
apology at the proper time will cover that."</p>

<p>"What's the new excitement?" asked the colonel. "More murders?
More princesses out at night?"</p>

<p>"This is between you and me. Not a word to a living soul, De
Wing!" Samson paused, then whispered: "The treasure of
Sialpore!"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;in the palace?"</p>

<p>"In the grounds! There's a tunnel already half-dug, leading
toward it from inside the palace wall. I've proof of the location
in my pocket!"</p>

<p>"Gad's teeth!" barked Willoughby de Wing. "All right, I'll
have your escort in a jiffy. Have a whisky and soda, my boy, to
stiffen you before the talk with Gungadhura!"</p>

<p>A little less than half an hour later Samson drove across the
bridge in the official landau, followed by an officer, a jemadar,
a naik and eight troopers of De Wing's Sikh cavalry. Willoughby
de Wing drove in the carriage with him as a witness. They entered
the palace together, and were kept waiting so long that Samson
sent the major-domo to the maharajah a second time with a veiled
threat to repeat, said slowly:</p>

<p>"Say the business is urgent and that I shall not be held
responsible for consequences if he doesn't see me at once!"</p>

<p>"Gad!" swore De Wing, screwing in his monocle. "I'd like a
second whisky and soda! I suppose there's none here. I hate to
see a man broke&mdash;even a blackguard!"</p>

<p>Gungadhura received them at last, seated, in the official
durbar room. The bandages were gone from his face, but a strip of
flesh-colored court-plaster from eye to lip gave him an almost
comical look of dejection, and he lolled in the throne-chair with
his back curved and head hung forward, scowling as a man does not
who looks forward to the interview.</p>

<p>Samson cleared his throat, and read what be had to say,
holding the paper straight in front of him.</p>

<p>"I have a disagreeable task of informing Your Highness that
your correspondence with the Mahsudi tribe is known to His
Majesty's Government."</p>

<p>Gungadhura scowled more deeply, but made no answer.</p>

<p>"Amounting as it does to treason, at a time when His Majesty's
Government are embarrassed by internal unrest, your act can not
be overlooked."</p>

<p>Gungadhura made a motion as if to interrupt, but thought
better of it.</p>

<p>"In the circumstances I have the honor to advise Your Highness
that the wisest course, and the only course that will avoid
impeachment, is abdication."</p>

<p>Gungadhura shook his head violently.</p>

<p>"I can explain," he said. "I have proofs."</p>

<p>Samson turned the paper over&mdash;paused a moment&mdash;and
began to read the second sheet.</p>

<p>"It is known who murdered Mukhum Dass. The assassin has been
caught, and has confessed."</p>

<p>Gungadhura's eyes that had been dull, and almost listless
hitherto, began to glare like an animal's.</p>

<p>"I have here&mdash;" Samson reached in his pocket, "a certain
piece of parchment&mdash;a map in fact&mdash;that was stolen from
the body of Mukhum Dass. Perhaps Your Highness will recognize it.
Look!"</p>

<p>Gungadhura looked, and started like a man stung. Samson
returned the map to his pocket, for the maharajah almost looked
like trying to snatch it; but instead he collapsed in his chair
again.</p>

<p>"If I abdicate?" he asked, as if his throat and lips could
hardly form the words.</p>

<p>"That would be sufficient. The assassin would then be allowed
to plead guilty to another charge there is against him, and the
matter would be dropped."</p>

<p>"I abdicate!"</p>

<p>"On behalf of His Majesty's Government I accept the
abdication. Sign this, please."</p>

<p>Samson laid a formal written act of abdication on the table by
the throne. Gungadhura signed it. Willoughby de Wing wrote his
signature as witness. Samson took it back and folded it away.</p>

<p>"Arrangements will be made for Your Highness to leave Sialpore
tomorrow morning, with a sufficient escort for your protection.
Provision will be made in due course for your private residence
elsewhere. Be good enough to hold yourself and your family in
readiness tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"But my son!" exclaimed Gungadhura. "I abdicate in favor of my
son!"</p>

<p>"In case of abdication by a reigning prince, or deposition of
a reigning prince," said Samson, "the Government of India
reserves the right to appoint his successor, from among eligible
members of his family if there be any, but to appoint his
successor in any case. There is ample precedent."</p>

<p>"And my son?"</p>

<p>"Will certainly not be considered."</p>

<p>Gungadhura glanced about him like a frenzied man, and then lay
back in a state of near-collapse. Samson and De Wing both bowed,
and left the room.</p>

<p>"Poor devil!" said De Wing, "I'm sorry for him."</p>

<p>"Would you be a good fellow," said Samson, "and send off this
wire for me? There&mdash;I've added the exact time of the
abdication. I've got to go now and summon a durbar of
Gungadhura's state officers, and tell them in confidence what's
happened. I shall hint pretty broadly that Utirupa is our man,
and then ask them which prince they'd like to have succeed."</p>

<p>"Good!" said De Wing. "Nothing like tact! Why not meet me at
the club for a whisky and soda afterward?"</p>

<p>Inside the durbar hall Gungadhura sat alone for just so long
as it took the sound of the closing door to die away. Then
another door, close behind the throne chair opened, and Patali
entered. She looked at him with pity on her face, and
curiosity.</p>

<p>"That American sold you," she said after a minute.</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"I say, that American sold you! He sold you, and the map, and
the treasure to the English!"</p>

<p>"I know it! I know it!"</p>

<p>"If I were a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>She waited, but he gave no sign of manhood.</p>

<p>"If I were a man I know what I would do!"</p>

<p>"Peace, Patali! I am a ruined man. They will all desert me as
soon as the news is out. They are deserting now; I feel it in my
bones. I have none to send."</p>

<p>"Send? It is only maharajahs who must send. Men do their own
work! I know what I would do to an American or any other man, who
sold me!"</p> <hr> <br>


<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21">CHAPTER XXI.</a><br>

"The guns of the gods!"</h2>

<p class="quote"><i>The king sent his army and said, "Lo, I did
it. Consider my prowess and my strategy!" But the gods
laughed.</i><br>

<br>

&mdash;Eastern Proverb</p>

<p>Very shortly after dawn on the morning of the polo game
Yasmini left the Blaines' house on business of her own. The news
of Gungadhura's abdication was abroad already, many times
multiplied by each mouth until two batteries of guns had become
an army corps. But what caused the greatest excitement was the
news, first of all whispered, then confirmed, that Gungadhura
himself was missing.</p>

<p>That disturbing knowledge was the factor that prevented
Yasmini from returning to her own rifled palace and making the
best of it; for it would take time to hedge the place about
properly with guards. There was simply no knowing what Gungadhura
might be up to. She judged it probable that he had seen through
her whole plot in the drear light of revelation that so often
comes to stricken men, and in that case her own life was likely
in danger every second he was still at liberty. But she sent word
to Utirupa, too, to be on the alert. And she saw him herself that
morning, in her favorite disguise of a Rangar zemindar, which is
a Rajput landowner turned Mohammedan. The disguise precluded any
Hindu interference, and Mohammedans on that country-side, who
might have questioned her, were scarce.</p>

<p>The polo did not take place until late afternoon, because of
the heat, but the grounds were crowded long before the time by a
multi-colored swarm in gala mood, whom the artillerymen, pressed
into service as line-keepers, had hard work to keep back of the
line. There was a rope around three sides of the field, but it
broke repeatedly, and in the end the gunners had to be stationed
a few feet apart all down the side opposite the grand-stand to
keep the crowd from breaking through.</p>

<p>There were carriages in swarms, ranging from the spider-wheel
gig of a British subaltern to the four-in-hand of Rajput
nobility&mdash;kept pretty carefully apart, though. The
conquerors of India don't mix with the conquered, as a rule,
except officially. And there were half a dozen shuttered
carriages that might have contained ladies, and might not; none
knew.</p>

<p>It was a crowd that knew polo from the inside outward, and
when the ponies were brought at last and stood in line below the
grand-stand, each in charge of his sais, there grew a great
murmur of critical approval; for the points of a horse in
Rajputana are as the lines of a yacht at Marblehead, and the
marks of a dog in Yorkshire; the very urchins know them. The
Bombay side of India had been scoured pretty thoroughly for
mounts for that event. The Rajputs had on the whole the weight of
money, and perhaps the showiest ponies, but the English team,
nearly all darker in color as it happened, except for one
pie-bald, looked trained up to the last notch and bore the air of
knowing just what to expect, that is as unmistakable in horses as
in men.</p>

<p>Tom Tripe was there with his dog. Trotters had the
self-imposed and wholly agreeable task of chasing all unattached
dogs off the premises. But Tom Tripe himself was keeping rather
in the background, because technically, as a servant of
Gungadhura, he was in a delicate position. A voice that he could
swear he almost recognized whispered to him in the crowd that the
English were going to forbid the next maharajah to have any but
employees of his own race. And a laugh that he could pick out of
a million greeted his change of countenance. But though he turned
very swiftly, and had had no brandy since morning to becloud his
vision, he failed to see his tormentor.</p>

<p>Tess and Dick drove down in ample time, as they had imagined,
and found hard work to squeeze the dog-cart in between the
phalanxes of wheels already massed on the ground. When they went
to the grand-stand it was to find not a seat left in the rows
reserved for ordinary folk; so Samson, who arrived late too,
magnificent in brand-new riding-boots, invited them to sit next
him in front.</p>

<p>The ground was in perfect condition&mdash;a trifle hard,
because of the season, but flat as a billiard table and as fast
as even Rajputs could desire. A committee of them had been going
over it daily for a week past, recommending touches here,
suggesting something there, neglecting not an inch, because the
finer stick-work of the Rajput team would be lost on uneven
ground; and the English had been sportsmen enough to accommodate
them without a murmur.</p>

<p>When a little bell rang and the teams turned out for the first
chukker in deathly-silence, it was evident at once what the
Rajput strategy would be. They had brought out their fastest
ponies to begin with, determined to take the lead at the start
and hold it.</p>

<p>One could hear the crowd breathe when the whistle blew; for in
India polo is a game to watch, not an opportunity for small talk.
Instantly the ball went clipping toward the English goal, to be
checked by Topham at full-back, who sent it out rattling to the
right wing. But the Rajput left-wing man, a young cousin of
Utirupa, cut in like an arrow. The ball crossed over to the right
wing, where Utirupa took it, galloping down the line on a
chestnut mare that had the speed of wind. Topham, racing to
intercept the ball, missed badly; a second later the Rajput
center thundered past both men and scored the goal, amid a roar
from the spectators, less than a minute from the start.</p>

<p>"Dick!" Tess exclaimed. "You ought to be ashamed of me! I'm
rooting for the Rajputs against my own color!"</p>

<p>"So'm I!" he answered. "I wish to glory there was some one
here to bet with!"</p>

<p>Samson overheard.</p>

<p>"Which way do you want to bet?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A thousand on the Rajputs."</p>

<p>"Thousand what?"</p>

<p>"Dollars. Three thousand rupees."</p>

<p>"Confound it, you Americans are all too rich! Never mind, I'll
take you."</p>

<p>"A bet!" Dick answered, and both men wrote it down.</p>

<p>About nine words were said by the captain of the English team
as they rode back to the center of the field, and when the ball
was in play again there was no more of the scattering open play
that suited the other side, but a close, short-hitting,
chop-and-follow method that tried ponies' tempers, and a
scrimmage every ten yards that made all unavailing the Rajputs'
speed and dash. Whenever a stroke of lightning wrist-work sent
the ball clipping down-field Topham returned it to the center and
the scrimmage began all over again. The first chukker ended in
mid-field, with the score 1&mdash;0.</p>

<p>Both sides brought out fresh ponies for the second, and the
Rajputs tried again to score with their favorite tactics of
long-hitting and tremendous speed. But the English were playing
dogged-does-it, and Topham on the pie-bald at full back was
invincible. Nothing passed him. Nor were the English slow. Three
times they seized opportunity in mid-field and rode with a burst
of fiery hitting toward the Rajput goal. Three times the gunners
down the line began to yell. The English team were getting
together, and the Rajputs a little wild. But the chukker ended
with the same score, 1&mdash; 0.</p>

<p>"How d'you feel about it now?" asked Samson, looking as calm
as the English habitually do whenever their pulse beats
furiously.</p>

<p>"I'd like to bet too!" Tess laughed, leaning across.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;the same sized bet?"</p>

<p>"No, a hundred."</p>

<p>"Dollars ?"</p>

<p>"Rupees!" she laughed. "I'm not so rich as my husband."</p>

<p>"Can't refuse a lady!" Samson answered, noting the bet down.
"I shall be a rich man tonight. They play a brilliant game, those
fellows, but we always beat them in the end."</p>

<p>"How do you account for that?" Dick asked, suspecting what was
coming.</p>

<p>"Oh, in a number of ways, but chiefly because they lack
team-loyalty among themselves. They're all jealous of one
another, whereas our fellows play as a unit."</p>

<p>As if in confirmation of Samson's words the Rajput team seemed
rather to go to pieces in the third chukker. There was the same
brilliant individual hitting, and as much speed as ever, but the
genius was not there. In vain Utirupa took the ball out of a
scrimmage twice and rode away with it. He was not backed up in
the nick of time, and before the end of the third minute the
English scored.</p>

<p>"You'd better go and hedge those bets," laughed Samson when
the chukker ended. "There are plenty of the native gentry over
yonder who'd be delighted to gamble a fortune with you yet!"</p>

<p>Dick scarcely heard. He was watching Utirupa, who stood by the
pony-line where a sais was doing something to a saddle girth. A
rangar came up to the prince and spoke to him&mdash;a slim,
young-looking man, a head the shorter of the two, with a turban
rather low over his eyes, and the loose end of it, for some
reason, across the lower half of his face. Dick nudged Tess, and
she nodded. After that Utirupa appeared to speak in low tones to
each member of his own team.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. What was that you said?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"I say you'd better hedge those bets."</p>

<p>"I'll double with you, if you like!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, man! I've wagered a month's pay already! Go and
bet with Willoughby de Wing or one of the gunner officers."</p>

<p>The rangar disappeared into the crowd before the teams rode
out for the fourth encounter, and Tess, who had made up her mind
to watch the shuttered carriages that stood in line together in a
roped enclosure of their own, became too busy with the game.
Something had happened to the Rajputs. They no longer played with
the gallery-appealing smash-and-gallop fury that won them the
first goal, although their speed held good and the stick-work was
marvelous. But they seemed more willing now to mix it in the
middle of the field, and to ride off an opponent instead of
racing for the chance to shine individually. It became the
English turn to drive to the wings and try to clear the ball for
a hurricane race down-field; and they were not quite so good at
those tactics as the other side were.</p>

<p>All the rest of that game until the eighth, chukker after
chukker, the Rajputs managed to reverse the usual procedure,
obliging the English team to wear itself out in terrific efforts
to break away, tiring men and ponies in a tight scramble in which
neither side could score.</p>

<p>"It looks like a draw after all," said Samson. "Bets off in
that case, I suppose? Disappointing game in my opinion."</p>

<p>"'Tisn't over yet," said Dick.</p>

<p>The Rajputs were coming out for the last chukker with their
first and fastest ponies that had rested through the game; and
they were smiling. Utirupa had said something that was either a
good joke or else vastly reassuring. As a matter of fact he had
turned them loose at last to play their old familiar game again,
and from the second that the ball went into play the crowd was on
tiptoe, swaying this and that way with excitement.</p>

<p>In vain the English sought to return to the scrimmage play; it
was too late. The Rajputs had them rattled. Topham at full-back
on the pie-bald was a stone wall, swift, hard-hitting and
resourceful, but in vain. Swooping down the wings, and passing
with the dextrous wrist-work and amazing body-bends that they
alone seem able to accomplish, they put the English team on the
defensive and kept them there. Once, at about half-time, by a
dash all together the English did succeed in carrying t he ball
down-field, but that was their last chance, and they missed it.
In the last two minutes the Rajputs scored two goals, the last
one driven home by Utirupa himself, racing ahead of the field
with whirling stick and the thunder of a neck-and-neck stampede
behind him.</p>

<p>"That'll be your month's pay!" laughed Dick. "I hope you won't
starve for thirty days!"</p>

<p>The crowd went mad with delight, and swarmed on to the ground,
shouting and singing. Samson got up, looking as if he rather
enjoyed to lose three thousand rupees in an afternoon.</p>

<p>"If you'll excuse me," he said, I'll go and shake hands with
Utirupa. He deserves congratulation. It was head-work won that
game."</p>

<p>"I wonder what she said to him at the end of the third
chukker," Tess whispered to Dick.</p>

<p>Samson found Utirupa giving orders to the saises, and shook
hands with him.</p>

<p>"Good game, Utirupa! Congratulate you. By the way: there's
going to be a meeting on important business in my office half an
hour from now. When you've had a tub and a change, I wish you'd
come and join us. We want a word with you."</p>

<p>"Where are the gunners going to?" asked Tess. "The men who
kept the line &mdash;look! They're all trooping off the ground in
the same direction."</p>

<p>"Dunno," said her husband. "Let's make for the dog-cart and
drive home. If we hang around Samson'll think we're waiting for
that money!"</p>

<p>Half an hour after that, Utirupa presented himself at Samson's
office in the usual neat Rajput dress that showed off his lithe
figure and the straightness of his stature. There was quite a
party there to meet him &mdash;Samson, Willoughby de Wing,
Norwood, Sir Hookum Bannerjee, Topham (still looking warm and
rather weary after the game)&mdash;and outside on the open ground
beyond the compound wall two batteries of horse-guns were drawn
up at attention. But if Utirupa felt surprise he did not show
it.</p>

<p>"To make a short story of a long one, Prince Utirupa," Samson
began at once, "as you know, Gungadhura abdicated yesterday. The
throne of Sialpore is vacant, and you are invited to accept it. I
have here the required authority from Simla."</p>

<p>Utirupa rose from his chair, and bowed.</p>

<p>"I am willing to accept," he answered quietly. His face showed
no emotion.</p>

<p>"There is one stipulation, though," said Samson. "We are tired
of these foolish 'islands'&mdash;our territory in yours and yours
in ours. There's a contract here. As your first official
act&mdash;there's no time like the present&mdash;we want you to
exchange the River Palace, on this side of the river, for out
fort on your side."</p>

<p>Utirupa said never a word.</p>

<p>"It's not a question of driving a bargain," Samson went on.
"We don't know what the palace may be worth, or what is in it. If
there is any valuable furniture you'd like removed, we'll waive
that point; but on the terms of the contract we exchange the
fort, with the guns and whatever else is there except the actual
harness and supplies of the garrison, against the land and palace
and whatever it contains except furniture."</p>

<p>Utirupa smiled&mdash;perhaps because the guns in that fort
were known to date from before the Mutiny.</p>

<p>"Will you agree?"</p>

<p>"I will sign," said Utirupa. And he signed the contract there
and then, in presence of all those witnesses. Ten minutes later,
as he left the office, the waiting batteries fired him a
fourteen-gun salute, that the world might know how a new
maharajah occupied the throne of Sialpore.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, up at the house on the hill Tess and Dick found
Yasmini already there ahead of them, lying at her ease, dressed
as a woman of women, and smoking a cigarette in the window-seat
of the bedroom Tess had surrendered to her.</p>

<p>"What was it you said to him after the third chukker?" was the
first question Tess asked.</p>

<p>"You recognized me?"</p>

<p>"Sure. So did my husband. What did you say to him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I just said that if he hoped to win he must play the game
of the English, and play it better, that was all. He won, didn't
he? I didn't stay to the end. I knew he would win."</p>

<p>Almost as they spoke the fourteen-gun salute boomed out from
across the river, and echoed from the hills.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Yasmini. "Listen! The guns of the gods! He is
maharajah now."</p>

<p>"But what of the treasure?" Tess asked her. "Dick told me this
morning that the English have a guard all round the River Palace,
and expect to dig the treasure up themselves."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the English need it more than he and I do," Yasmini
answered.</p>

<p>That evening Tom Tripe turned up, and Yasmini came down-stairs
to talk with him, Trotters remaining outside the window with his
ash-colored hair on end and a succession of volcanic growls
rumbling between flashed teeth.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the dog, that he won't come in?" asked
Tess.</p>

<p>"Nothing, ma'arm He's just encouraging himself. He stays here
tonight."</p>

<p>"Trotters does? Why?"</p>

<p>"It's known all over Sialpore that her ladyship's staying
here, and Gungadhura's at large somewhere.</p>

<p>You're well guarded; that's been seen to, but Trotters stays
for double inner-guard. One or two men might go to sleep.
Gungadhura might pass them a poisoned drink, or physic their
rations in some way. And then, they're what you might call fixed
point men here, one there, with instructions they'll be skinned
alive and burned if they leave their exact position. Trotters has
a roving commission, to nose and snarl whenever he's minded. You
can't poison him, for he won't eat from strangers. You can't see
to knife him in the dark, because he's ash-colored and moves too
swift. And if Gungadhura comes an' shoots at where Trotters' eyes
gleam&mdash;well&mdash;Mr. Dick Blaine is liable to wake up an'
show his highness how Buffalo Billy imitates a Gatling gun! The
house is safe, but I thought I'd come and mention it."</p>

<p>"When will my palace be ready?" Yasmini asked.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow or the next day, Your Ladyship. There wasn't so much
taken out after all, though a certain amount was stolen. The
first orders the new maharajah gave were to have your palace
attended to; and some of the stolen stuff is coming in already;
word went out that if stuff was returned there'd be nothing said,
but if it weren't returned there'd be something brand-new in the
line of trouble for all concerned. The priests have been told to
pass the word along. 'No obedience from priests, no priests at
the coronation ceremony!&mdash;It's my belief from about two
hours' observation that we've got a maharajah now with guts, if
you'll excuse my bad French, please, ma'am."</p>

<p>"What does it matter to you, Tom, whether he is good or not?"
Yasmini asked mischievously. Isn't there a rumor that the English
won't allow any but the native-born instructors after this?"</p>

<p>"Ah, naughty, naughty!" he laughed, shaking a gnarled
forefinger. "I thought it was your voice in the crowd. Your
Ladyship 'ud like to have me all nervous, wouldn't you?
Well&mdash;if Tom Tripe was out of a job tomorrow, the very first
person he'd apply to for a new one would be the Princess Yasmini;
and she'd give it him!"</p>

<p>"What have you in your hand?" Yasmini asked.</p>

<p>"Gungadhura's turban that he wore the night when Akbar chased
him down the street."</p>

<p>Yasmini nodded, understanding instantly.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, after a rousing stiff night-cap, Tom took
his leave. They heard his voice outside the window:</p>

<p>"Trotters!"</p>

<p>The dog's tail beat three times on the veranda.</p>

<p>"Take a smell o' this!"</p>

<p>There was silence, followed by a growl.</p>

<p>"If he comes,&mdash;kill him! D'ye understand? Kill him!
There&mdash; there's the turban for you to lie on an' memorize
the smell! Kill him! Ye understand?"</p>

<p>A deep growl was the answer, and Tom Tripe marched off toward
the stables for his horse, whistling Annie Rooney, lest some too
enthusiastic watcher knife him out of a shadow.</p>

<p>"When I am maharani," said Yasmini, "Tom Tripe shall have the
title of sirdar, whether the English approve of it or not!"</p>

<hr> <br>


<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br>

"Making one hundred exactly!"</h2>

<p class="quote"><i>The Creator caused flowers to bloom in the
desert and buried jewels in the bosom of the earth. That is lest
men should grow idle, wallowing in delights they have, instead of
acquiring merit in the search for beauty that is out of
reach.</i><br>

<br>

&mdash;Eastern Proverb</p><br>


<p class="first">TECHNICALLY, Yasmini was as much Maharani of
Sialpore as she would ever be, the moment that the fourteen-gun
salute boomed out across the river. For the English do not
recognize a maharani, except as courtesy title. The reigning
prince is maharajah, and, being Hindu, can have one wife or as
many as he pleases. Utirupa and Yasmini claimed to have married
themselves by Gandharva rite, and, had she chosen, she could have
gone to live with him that minute.</p>

<p>But that would not have paid her in the long run. The priests,
for instance, whom she despised with all her character, would
have been outraged into life-long enmity; and she knew their
power.</p>

<p>"It is one thing," she told Tess, "to determine to be rid of
cobras; but another to spurn them with your hand and foot. They
bite!"</p>

<p>Then again, it would not have suited her to slip quietly into
Utirupa's palace and assume the reins of hidden influence without
the English knowing it. She proposed taking uttermost advantage
of the purdah custom that protects women in India from
observation and makes contact between them and the English almost
impossible. But she intended, too, to force the Indian Government
into some form of recognition of her.</p>

<p>"If they acknowledge me, they lock swords with every woman in
the country. Let them deny me afterward, and all those swords
will quiver at their throats! A woman's sword is subtler than a
man's."</p>

<p>(That was the secret of her true strength in all the years
that followed. It was never possible to bring her quite to bay,
because the women pulled hidden strings for her in the sphere
that is above and below the reach of governments.) So she moved
back into her own palace, where she received only Tess of all the
Anglo-Saxon women in India.</p>

<p>"Why don't you keep open house to English women, and start
something?" Tess asked her. But Yasmini laughed.</p>

<p>"My power would be gone. Do you fight a tiger by going down on
all-fours with him and using teeth and claws? Or do you keep your
distance, and use a gun?"</p>

<p>"But the English women are not tigresses."</p>

<p>"If they were, I would laugh at them. Trapping tigers is a
task the jungle coolies can attend to well! But if I admit the
English women into my palace, they will come out of curiosity.
And out of pity, or compassion or some such odious emotion they
will invite me to their homes, making an exhibition of me to
their friends. Should I be one of them? Never! Would they admit
other Indian women with me? Certainly; any one I cared to
recommend. They would encourage us to try to become their social
equals, as they would call it, always backing away in front of us
and beckoning, we striving, and they flattered. No! I will
reverse that. I will have the English women striving to enter our
society! They shall wake up one day to discover there is
something worth having that is out of reach. Then see the
commotion! Watch the alteration then! Today they say, when they
trouble to think of us at all, 'Come and visit us; our ways are
good; we will not hurt you; come along,' as the children call to
a kitten in the street. Then they will say, 'We have this and
that to offer. We desire your good society. Will you admit us if
we bring our gifts?' That will be another story, but it will take
time."</p>

<p>"More than time," Tess answered. "Genius."</p>

<p>"I have genius. That is why I know too much to declare war on
the priests. I shall have a proper wedding, and priests shall
officiate, I despising them and they aware of it. That will be
their first defeat. They shall come to my marriage as dogs come
to their mistress when she calls&mdash;and be whipped away again
if they fawn too eagerly! They will not dare refuse to come,
because then war would be joined, and I might prove to people how
unnecessary priests are. But they are more difficult to deal with
than the English. A fat hypocrite like Jinendra's high priest is
like a carp to be caught with a worm, or an ass to be beaten with
a stick; but there are others&mdash;true ascetics&mdash;lusting
for influence more than a bellyful, caring nothing for the
outside of the power if they hold the nut&mdash;nothing for the
petals, if they hold the seed. Those men are not easy. For the
present I shall seem to play into their hands, but they know that
I despise them!"</p>

<p>So great preparations were made for a royal wedding. And when
Samson heard that Yasmini was to be Utirupa's bride he was
sufficiently disgusted, even to satisfy Yasmini, who was no
admirer of his. Sita Ram's account of Samson's rage, as he
explained the circumstance to Willoughby de Wing, was almost
epic.</p>

<p>"Damn the woman! And damn him! She's known for a
trouble-maker. Simla will be asking me why on earth I permitted
it. They'll want to know why I didn't caution Utirupa and warn
him against that princess in particular. She's going to parade
through the streets under my very nose and in flat defiance of
our government, just at the very time when I've gone on record as
sponsor for Utirupa. I've assured them he wouldn't do an
ill-advised thing, and I specifically undertook to see that he
married wisely. But it was too early yet to speak to him about
it. And here he springs this offense on me! It's too
bad&mdash;too bad!"</p>

<p>"You'll be all right with Simla," said Willoughby de Wing.
"Dig up the treasure and they'll recommend you for the K. C. B.,
with the pick of all the jobs going!"</p>

<p>"They don't give K. C. B.'s to men in my trade," Samson
answered rather gloomily. "They reserve them for you professional
butchers."</p>

<p>He was feeling jumpy about the treasure, and dreaming of it
all night long in a way that did not make the waking fears more
comfortable. A whole company of sappers bad been sent for; and
because of the need of secrecy for the present, a special
appropriation had had to be made to cover the cost of lumber for
the tunnel that Dick began, and that the sappers finished. They
had dug right up to the pipal trees, and half-killed them by
tunneling under their roots along one side; but without
discovering anything so far, except a few old coins. (The very
ancient golden mohur in the glass case marked "Sialpore" in the
Allahabad Museum is one of them.) Now they were going to tunnel
down the other side and kill the ancient trees completely.</p>

<p>Being a man of a certain courage, Samson had it in
mind&mdash;perhaps &mdash;to send the map to an expert for an
opinion on it. Only, he hated experts; they were so bent always
on establishing their own pet theory. And it was late&mdash;a
little late for expert opinions on the map. The wisest way was to
keep silent and continue digging, even if the operation did kill
ancient landmarks that one could see&mdash;from across the river,
for instance.</p>

<p>And, of course, he could not refuse to recognize the wedding
officially and put on record the name, ancestry and title of the
maharajah's legal first wife. Nor could he keep away, because,
with amazingly shrewd judgment, Yasmini had contrived the novelty
of welding wedding and coronation ceremony and festival in one.
Instead of two successive outbursts of squandering, there would
be only one. It was economic progress. One could not withhold
approval of it. He must go in person, smile, give a valuable
present (paid for by the government, of course), and say the
proper thing.</p>

<p>One modicum of consolation did ooze out of the rind of
Samson's situation. It would have been no easier, be reflected,
to say the right thing at the right time at the coronation
ceremony, especially to the right people, if that treasure should
already have been dug up and reposing in the coffers of the
Indian Government. After a certain sort of bargain, one's tongue
feels unpleasant in one's cheek.</p>

<p>Sialpore, however, was much more taken up with preparations
for the colossal coronation-wedding feast than with Samson's
digging. Yasmini went on her palace roof each day to see how the
trees leaned this and that way, as the earth was mined from under
them. And Tom Tripe, standing guard on the bastion of the fort to
oversee the removal of certain stores and fittings before the
English should march out finally and the maharajah's men march
in, could see the destruction of the pipal trees too. So, for
that matter, could Dick Blaine, on the day when he took some of
the gang and blocked up the mouth of the mine on the hill with
cemented masonry&mdash;to prevent theft; and cursed himself
afterward for being such a fool as to brick up his luncheon
basket inside the tunnel, to say nothing of all the men's water
bottles and some of their food and tools. But nobody else in
Sialpore took very much notice of Samson's excavation, and nobody
cared about Dick's mine.</p>

<p>Every maharajah always tries to make his wedding and
coronation ceremonies grander, and more extravagant and memorable
than anybody's else have been since history began; and there are
plenty whose interest it is to encourage him, and to help him do
it; money-lenders, for instance. But Utirupa not only had two
magnificent ceremonies to unite in one, but Yasmini to supply the
genius. The preparations made the very priests gasp (and they
were used to orgies of extravagance&mdash;taught and preached and
profited by them in fact.)</p>

<p>Once or twice Tess remonstrated, but Yasmini turned a
scornfully deaf ear.</p>

<p>"What would you have us do instead? Invest all the money at
eight per cent., so that the rich traders may have more capital,
and found an asylum where Bimbu, Umra and Pinga may live in
idleness and be rebuked for mirth?"</p>

<p>"Bimbu, Umra and Pinga might be put to work," said Tess. "As
for mirth, they laugh at such unseemly things. They could be
taught what proper humor is."</p>

<p>"Have they not worked?" Yasmini asked. "Has one man got into
your house, without you, or the guard set to watch you, knowing
it? Could any one have done it better? Did it not have to be
done? As for humor&mdash;have they not enjoyed the task? Has it
not been a sweeter tale in their ears than the story-teller's at
the corner, because they have told it to themselves and acted a
part in it?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Tess, "you can't convince me! There are
institutions that could be founded with all that money you and
your husband are going to spend on ceremony, that would do
good."</p>

<p>"Institutions?" Yasmini's eyes grew ablaze with blue indignant
fire. "There were institutions in this land before the English
came, which need attention before we worry ourselves over new
ones. Play was one of them, and I will revive it first! The
people used to dance under the trees by moonlight. Do they do it
now? It is true they used to die of famine in the bad years,
growing much too fat in good ones, and the English have changed
that. But I will give them back the gladness, if I can, that has
been squeezed out by too many 'institutions!'"</p>

<p>"You would rather see Bimbu, Umra and Pinga happy, than
prosperous and well-clothed?"</p>

<p>"Which would you rather?" Yasmini asked her. "You shall see
them well clothed in a little while. Just wait."</p>

<p>There were almost endless altercations with the priests.
Utirupa himself was known to have profound Sikh
tendencies&mdash;a form of liberalism in religion that produced
almost as much persecution at one time as Protestantism did in
Europe. To marry a woman openly who had no true claim to caste at
all, as Yasmini, being the daughter of a foreigner, had not, was
in the eyes of the priests almost as great an offense as
Yasmini's father's, who crossed the kali pani* and married abroad
in defiance of them. So the priests demanded the most elaborate
ritual of purification that ingenuity could devise, together with
staggering sums of money. Utirupa's eventual threat to lead a
reform movement in Rajputana brought them to see reason, however,
and they eventually compromised, with a stipulation that the
public should not be told how much had been omitted.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>kali pani</i> (Hindi)&mdash;ocean;
literally: "black water."]</p>

<p>There was feasting in the streets for a week before the great
inauguration ceremony. Tables were set in every side-street,
where whoever cared to might eat his fill of fabulous free
rations. Each night the streets were illuminated with colored
lights, and fireworks blazed and roared against the velvet sky at
intervals, dowering the ancient trees and temple-tops with
momentary splendor.</p>

<p>All day long there were performances by acrobats, and songs,
and story-telling whenever there was room for a crowd to gather.
Fakirs as gruesome and fantastic as the side-shows at a Western
fair flocked in to pose and be gaped at, receiving, besides free
rations and tribute of small coin, gratification to their vanity
in return for the edifying spectacle.</p>

<p>There were little processions, too, of princes arriving from a
distance to be present on the great day, their elephants of state
loaded with extravagant gifts and their retainers vying with
peacocks in efforts to look splendid, and be arrogant, and claim
importance for their masters. Never a day but three or four or
half-a-dozen noble guests arrived; and nobody worked except those
who had to make things easy for the rest; and they worked
overtime.</p>

<p>One accustomed spectacle, however, was omitted. Utirupa would
have none of the fights between wild animals in the arena that
had formed such a large part of Gungadhura's public amusement.
But there was ram-fighting, and wrestling between men such as
Sialpore had never seen, all the best wrestlers from distant
parts being there to strive for prizes. Hired dancers added to
the gaiety at night, and each incoming nobleman brought nautch
girls, or acrobats, or trained animals, or all three to add to
the revelry. And there was cock-fighting, and quail-fighting, of
course, all day long and every day, with gambling in
proportion.</p>

<p>When the day of days at last arrived the city seemed full of
elephants. Every compound and available walled space had been
requisitioned to accommodate the brutes, and there were
sufficient argumentative mahouts, all insisting that their
elephants had not enough to eat, and all selling at least half of
the provided ration, to have formed a good-sized regiment. The
elephants' daily bath in the river was a sight worth crossing
India to see. There was always the chance, besides, that
somebody's horses would take fright and add excitement to the
spectacle.</p>

<p>Up in the great palace Utirupa feasted and entertained his
equals all day long, and most of the night. There was
horse-racing that brought the crowd out in its thousands, and a
certain amount of tent-pegging and polo, but most of the royal
gala-making was hidden from public view. (Patali, for instance,
reckless of Gungadhura's fall and looking for new fields to
conquer, provided a nautch by herself and her own trained galaxy
of girls that would not have done at all in public.)</p>

<p>Yasmini kept close in her own palace. She, too, had her hands
full with entertaining, for there were about a dozen of the wives
of distant princes who had made the journey in state to attend
the ceremony and watch it from behind the durbar grille&mdash;to
say nothing of the wives of local magnates. But she herself kept
within doors, until the night before the night of full moon, the
day before the ceremony.</p>

<p>That night she dressed as a rangar once more, and rode in
company with Tess and Dick, with Ismail the Afridi running like a
dog in the shadows behind them, to the fort on the hill that the
English had promised to evacuate that night. They never changed
the garrison in any case except by night, because of the heat and
the long march for the men; and as near the full moon as possible
was the customary date.</p>

<p>As they neared the fort they could see Tom Tripe, with his
huge dog silhouetted on the bastion beside him, standing like
Napoleon on the seashore keeping vigil. From that height he could
oversee the blocked-up mouth of Dick's mine, and in the bright
moonlight it would have been difficult for any one to approach
either mine or fort without detection; for there was only one
road, and Dick's track making a detour from it&mdash;both in full
view.</p>

<p>He caught sight of them, and Dick whistled, the dog answering
with a cavernous howl of recognition. Tom disappeared from the
bastion, and after about ten minutes turned up in the shadow
where they waited.</p>

<p>"Come to watch the old march out and the new march in?" he
asked. "I'll stand here with you, if I may. They're due."</p>

<p>"Is everything ready?" asked Yasmini.</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Ladyship. They've been ready for an hour, and
fretful. There's a story gone the rounds that the fort is
haunted, and if ever a garrison was glad to quit it's this one!
Let's hope the incoming garrison don't get wind of it. A Sepoy
with the creeps ain't dependable. Hullo, here they come!"</p>

<p>There came a sound of steady tramping up-hill, and a bugle
somewhere up in the darkness announced that the out-going
garrison had heard it and were standing to arms. Presently
Utirupa rode into view accompanied by half a dozen of his guests,
and followed by a company from his own army, officered by
Rajputs. If he knew that Yasmini was watching from the shadow he
made no sign, but rode straight on up-hill. The heavy breathing
of his men sounded through the darkness like the whispering of
giants, and their steady tramp was like a giant's footfall; for
Tom Tripe had drilled them thoroughly, even if their weapons were
nearly as old-fashioned as the fort to which they marched.</p>

<p>After an interminable interval there came another bugle-blast
above them, and the departing garrison tramped within
ear-shot.</p>

<p>"Now count them!" Yasmini whispered, and Tess wondered
why.</p>

<p>They were marching down-hill as fast as they could
swing&mdash;a detachment of Punjabi infantry under the command of
a native subahdar, with two ammunition mules and a cartful of
their kits and personal belongings &mdash;all talking and
laughing as if regret were the last thing in their minds.</p>

<p>"Ninety-seven," said Tess, when the last had passed
down-hill.</p>

<p>"Did you count the man beside the driver on the cart?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There was one sick man in a doolie. Did you count him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ninety-eight, them Tom!"</p>

<p>"Your Ladyship?"</p>

<p>"Weren't there some English officers?"</p>

<p>"Two. A captain and a subaltern. They left late this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Making?" said Yasmini.</p>

<p>"Exactly a hundred," answered Tess.</p>

<p>"Let us go now," said Yasmini. "We must be up at dawn for the
great day. I shall expect you very early, remember. Tom! You may
ride back with us. His highness will mount the guard in person.
You're to come to my palace. I've a present waiting for you."</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII.</a><br>

"Three amber moons in a purple sky."</h2>

<p class="quote"><i>It is better to celebrate the occasion than
to annoy the gods with pretended virtue and too many
promises.</i><br>

<br>

&mdash;Eastern Proverb</p><br>


<p class="first">THE day of the great inauguration ceremony
dawned inauspiciously for somebody. For one thing, the blasting
powder laid ready by the sappers under the pipal trees for
explosion the day following, blew up prematurely. Some idiot had
left a kerosene lamp burning in the dug-out, probably, and a rat
upset it; or some other of the million possibilities took place.
Nobody was killed, but a dozen pipal trees were blown to
smithereens, and the ghastly fact laid bare for all to see that
in the irregular chasm that remained there was not a symptom of
the treasure&mdash;as Samson was immediately notified.</p>

<p>So Samson had to attend the ceremony with that disconcerting
knowledge up his sleeve. But that was not all. The night
signaler, going off duty, had brought him a telegram from the
high commissioner to say that all available military bands were
to be lent for the day to the maharajah, and that as many British
officers as possible, of all ranks, were to take part in the
procession to grace it with official sanctity.</p>

<p>That was especially aggravating because it had reached his
ears that the Princess Yasmini intended to ride veiled in the
procession, and to sit beside her husband in the durbar hall
unveiled. He was therefore going to be obliged to recognize her
more or less officially as consort of the reigning prince. Simla
did not realize that, of course; but it was too late to wire for
different instructions. He had a grim foreboding that he himself
would catch it later on when the facts leaked out, as they were
bound to do.</p>

<p>(It was babu Sita Ram who "caught it" first, though. Within
two days Samson discovered that Sita Ram had been sending
official telegrams in code on his own account, very cleverly
designed to cause the high commissioner to give those last minute
instructions. It was obvious that a keener wit than the babu's
had inspired him; but, though he was brow-beaten for an hour he
did not implicate Yasmini. And after he had been dismissed from
the service with ignominy she engaged him as a sort of secretary,
at the same pay.)</p>

<p>But that was not all, either. The murderer of Mukhum Dass was
refusing stolidly to plead guilty to another charge, and Blaine's
butler had come out with the whole story of the burglary.
Parliament would get to hear about it next, and then there would
be the very deuce to pay. The police were offering the murderer
what they called "inducements and persuasion;" but he held out
for "money down," and did not seem to find too unendurable
whatever it was that happened to him at intervals in the dark
cell. There are limits even to what an Indian policeman can do,
without making marks on a man or compelling the attention of
European officers.</p>

<p>On top of all that, Samson had to hand Dick Blaine a check
amounting to a month's pay, look pleasant while he did it,
and&mdash;above all&mdash; look pleasant at the coming
durbar.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there were people who enjoyed themselves.
Sialpore, across the river, was a dinning riot of
excitement&mdash;flags, triumphal arches, gala clothes and
laughter everywhere. Dick Blaine, driving Tess toward Yasmini's
palace in the very early dawn, had to drive slowly to avoid
accident, for the streets were already crowded. His own place in
the procession was to be on horseback pretty nearly anywhere he
chose to insert himself behind the royal cortege, and, not being
troubled on the score of precedence, he had Tom Tripe in mind as
a good man to ride with. Tom could tell him things.</p>

<p>But he waited there for more than an hour until the royal
elephants arrived, magnificent in silver howdahs and bright
paint, and watched Tess emerge with Yasmini and the other women.
Tess wore borrowed jewels, and a veil that you could see her face
through; but Yasmini was draped from head to foot as if the eyes
of masculinity had never rested on her, and never might. Things
were not going quite so smoothly as they ought, although Tom
Tripe was galloping everywhere red-necked with energy, and it was
nearly half an hour more before the escort of maharajah's troops
came in brand-new scarlet uniforms, to march in front, and
behind, and on each side of the elephants. So Dick got quite a
chance to "josh" Tess, and made the most of it.</p>

<p>But things got under way at last. Dick's sais found him with
the horse he was to ride, and the procession gathered first on
the great maidan between the city and the river, with bands in
full blast, drums thundering to split the ears, masters of
ceremony shouting, and the elephants enjoying themselves most of
all, as they always do when they have a stately part to play in
company.</p>

<p>Utirupa led the way in a golden howdah on Akbar, the biggest
elephant in captivity and the very archetype of sobriety ever
since his escapade with Tom Tripe's rum. Akbar was painted all
over with vermilion and blue decorations, and looked as if butter
would not melt in his mouth.</p>

<p>Next after Utirupa the princes rode in proper order of rank
and precedence, each with two attendants up behind him waving
fans of ostrich plumes. Then came a band. Then Samson, and a
score of British officers in carriages whose teams were nearly
frantic from the din and the smell of elephants and had to have
runners to hold their heads&mdash;all of which added exquisite
amusement. Then another band, and a column of the maharajah's
troops. Then more elephants, loaded with the lesser notables; and
after them, a column nearly a mile long of Rajput gentry on the
most magnificent horses they could discover and go in debt
for.</p>

<p>After the Rajput gentry came a third band, followed by more
maharajah's troops, and then Yasmini on her elephant, followed by
twenty princesses and Tess, each with a great beast to herself
and at least two maids to wave the jeweled fans. Then more
troops, followed by Dick and Tom Tripe together on horseback
leading the rank and file. Trotters jogged along between Tom and
Dick, pausing at intervals to struggle with both forefeet to
remove a collar bossed with solid gold that he regarded as an
outrage to his dogly dignity.</p>

<p>And the rank and file were well worth looking at, for whoever
could find a decent suit of clothes was marching, shouting,
laughing, sweating, kicking up the dust, and having a good time
generally. The water-sellers were garnering a harvest; fruit- and
sweetmeat-peddlers were dreaming of open-fronted shops and how to
defeat the tax-collector. The police swaggered and yelled and
ordered everybody this and that way; and nobody took the
slightest notice; and the policemen did not dare do anything
about it because the crowd was too unanimously bent on having its
own way, and therefore dangerous to bully but harmless if not
hit.</p>

<p>Half-way down the thronging stream of men on foot came another
elephant &mdash;a little one, alone, carrying three gentlemen in
fine white raiment &mdash;Bimbu and Pinga and Umra to wit, who,
it is regrettable to chronicle, were very drunk indeed and
laughed exceedingly at most unseemly jokes, exchanging jests with
the crowd that would have made Tess's hair stand on end, if she
could have heard and understood them. From windows, and roofs
that overhung the street, people threw flowers at Bimbu, Pinga
and Umra, because all Hindustan knows there is merit in treating
beggars as if they were noblemen; and Bimbu wove himself a
garland out of the buds to wear on his turban, which made him
look more Bacchanalian than ever.</p>

<p>In and out and around and through the ancient city the
procession filed, passing now and then through streets so narrow
that people could have struck Utirupa through the upper story
windows; but all they threw at him was flowers, calling him
"Bahadur" and king of elephants, and great prince, and dozens of
other names that never hurt anybody with a sense of pageantry and
humor. He acted the part for them just as they wanted him to,
sitting bolt upright in the howdah like a prince in a fairy
story, with jeweled aigrette in his turban and more enormous
diamonds flashing on his silken clothes than a courtesan would
wear at Monte Carlo. And all the other princes were likewise in
degree, only that they rode rather smaller elephants, Akbar
having no peer when he was sober and behaved himself.</p>

<p>And when Yasmini passed, and Tess and all the other
princesses, there was such excitement as surely had never been
before; for if you looked carefully, with a hand held to keep the
sun from your eyes, you could actually see the outlines of their
faces through the veils! And such loveliness! Such splendor! Such
pride! Such jewels! Above all, such fathomless mystery and
suggestion of intrigue! Pageantry is expensive, but&mdash;believe
Sialpore &mdash;it is worth the price!</p>

<p>And then in front of the durbar hall in the dinning, throbbing
heat, all the animals and carriages and men got mixed in a
milling vortex, while the notables went into the hall to be
jealous of one another's better places and left the crowd outside
to sort itself. And everything was made much more interesting by
the fact that Akbar was showing signs of ill-temper, throwing up
his great trunk once or twice to trumpet dissatisfaction. His
mahout was calling him endearing names and using the ankus
alternately, promising him rum with one breath and a thrashing
with the next. But Akbar wanted alcohol, not promises, and none
dared give him any before evening, when he might get as drunk as
he wished in a stone-walled compound all to himself.</p>

<p>Then Samson's horses took fright at Akbar's trumpeting, he
getting out of the carriage at the durbar door only in the nick
to time. The horses bolted into the crowd, and an indignant
elephant smashed the carriage; but nobody was hurt beyond a
bruise or two, although they passed word down the thunderous line
that a hundred and six and thirty had been crushed to death and
one child injured, which made it much more thrilling, and the
sensation was just as actual as if the deaths had really
happened.</p>

<p>And inside the durbar hall there was surely never such a
splendid scene in history&mdash;such a sea of turbans&mdash;such
glittering of jewels &mdash;such a peacocking and swaggering and
proud bearing of ancient names! Utirupa sat on the throne in
front of a peacock-feather decoration; and-marvel of
marvels!&mdash;Yasmini sat on another throne beside him,
unveiled!&mdash;with a genuine unveiled and very beautiful
princess beside her, whom nobody except Samson suspected might be
Tess. She wore almost as many jewels as the queen herself, and
looked almost as ravishing.</p>

<p>But the Princess Yasmini's eyes&mdash;they were the glory of
that occasion! Her spun-gold hair was marveled at, but her
eyes&mdash;surely they were lent by a god for the event! They
were bluer than the water of Himalayan lakes; bluer than
turquoise, sapphire, the sky, or any other blue thing you can
think of&mdash;laughing blue,&mdash;loving, understanding,
likable, amusing blue&mdash;two jewels that outshone all the
other jewels in the durbar hall that day.</p>

<p>And as each prince filed past Utirupa in proper order of
precedence, to make a polite set speech, and bow, and be bowed to
in return, he had to pass Yasmini first, and bow to her first,
although he made his speech to Utirupa, who acknowledged it. So,
when Samson's turn came, he, too, had to bow first to Yasmini,
because as a gentleman he could hardly do less; and her wonderful
eyes laughed into his angry ones as she bowed to him in return,
with such good humor and elation that he could not help but smile
back; he could forgive a lovely woman almost anything, could
Samson. He could almost forgive her that no less than nineteen
British officers of various ranks, as well as
one-hundred-and-three-and-twenty native noblemen had seen him
with their own eyes to make an official bow to the consort of a
reigning maharajah. He had recognized her officially! Well; he
supposed he could eat his aftermath as well as any man; and he
drove home with a smile and a high chin, to unbosom himself to
Colonel Willoughby de Wing over a whisky and soda at the club, as
Ferdinand de Sousa Braganza reported in some detail at the
Goanese Club afterward.</p>

<p>Late that night, when the fireworks were all over and the
lights were beginning to be extinguished on the roofs and
windows, it was a question which was most drunk&mdash;Akbar, the
three beggars, or Tom Tripe. Akbar's outrageous trumpeting could
be heard all over the city, as he raced around his dark compound
after shadows, and rats, and mice and anything else that he
imagined or could see. What Tom Tripe saw kept him to his
quarters, where Trotters watched him in dire misery. The three
beggars, Bimbu, Pinga and Umra, saw three amber moons in a purple
sky, for they said so. They also said that all the world was
lovely, and Yasmini was a queen of queens, out of whose jeweled
hand the very gods ate. And when people scolded them for
blasphemy, they made such outrageously funny and improper jokes
that everybody laughed again.</p>

<p>Drunk or sober (and more than ninety-nine per cent. of
Sialpore was absolutely sober then as always) every one had
something to amuse and entertain, except Samson, whose mental
vision was of a great empty hole in the ground in which he might
just as well bury all his hopes of ever being high commissioner;
and poor Tom Tripe, who had worked harder than anybody, and was
now enjoying the aftermath perhaps least.</p>

<p>Sialpore put itself to bed in great good temper, sure that
princes and elephants and ceremony were the cream of life, and
that whoever did not think so did not deserve to have any
pageantry and pomp, and that was all about it.</p>

<p>Next morning early, Dick Blaine drove down to look for Tom
Tripe, found him&mdash;bound him in a blanket&mdash;shoved him,
feet first, on to the floor of the dog-cart, and drove him,
followed by Trotters in doubt whether to show approval or fight,
to his own house on the hill, where Tess and he nursed the old
soldier back to soberness and old remorse.</p>

<p>By that time Bimbu and Pinga and Umra were back again at the
garden gate, sitting in the dust in ancient rags and whining,
"Bhig mangi, saheebi!" "Alms! heaven-born, alms!"</p> <hr> <br>


<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV.</a><br>

"A hundred guarded it."</h2>

<p class="quote"><i>"You are a fool," said the crow. "Am I?" the
hen answered. "Certainly you are a fool. You sit in a dark corner
hatching eggs, when there are live chickens for the asking over
yonder." So the hen left her nest in search of ready-made
chickens, and the crow, made a square meal</i>.<br>

<br>

&mdash;Eastern Proverb</p><br>


<p class="first">IT began to be rumored presently that Utirupa
had declined to recognize Blaine's contract with his predecessor.
Samson's guarded hints, and the fact that the mouth of the mine
remained blocked with concrete masonry were more or less
corroborative. But the Blaines did not go, although Dick put in
no appearance at the club.</p>

<p>Then Patali, who was sedulously cultivating Yasmini's
patronage, with ulterior designs on Utirupa that were not
misunderstood, told Norwood's wife's ayah's sister's husband that
the American had secured another contract; and the news, of
course, reached Samson's ears at once.</p>

<p>So Samson called on Utirupa and requested explanations. He was
told that the mining contract had not received a moment's
consideration and, with equal truth, that the American, being an
expert in such matters and on the spot, had been asked to
undertake examination of the fort's foundations. The new
maharani, it seemed, had a fancy to build a palace where the fort
stood, and the matter was receiving shrewd investigation and
estimate in advance.</p>

<p>Samson could not object to that. Those foundations had not
been examined carefully for eight hundred years. A perfectly good
palace had been wrested away by diplomatic means, on Samson's own
initiative, and there was no logical reason why the maharajah
should not build another one to replace it. The fort had no
modern military value.</p>

<p>"I hope you're not going to try to pay for your new palace out
of taxes?" Samson asked bluntly.</p>

<p>But Utirupa smiled. He hoped nothing of that kind would be
necessary. Samson could not go and investigate what Blaine was
doing, because he was given plainly to understand that the new
palace was the maharani's business; and one does not intrude
uninvited into the affairs of ladies in the East. The efforts of
quite a number of spies, too, were unavailing. So Dick had his
days pretty much to himself, except when Tess brought his lunch
to him, or Yasmini herself in boots and turban rode up for a few
minutes to look on. The guards on the bastions, and in the great
keep in the center, knew nothing whatever of what was happening,
because all Dick's activity was underground and Tom Tripe, with
that ferocious dog of his, kept guard over the ancient door that
led to the lower passages. Dick used to return home every evening
tired out, but Tom Tripe, keeping strictly sober, slept in the
fort and said nothing of importance to any one. He looked drawn
and nervous, as if something had terrified him, but public
opinion ascribed that to the "snakes" on the night of the
coronation.</p>

<p>Then about sundown one evening Tom Tripe galloped in a great
hurry to Utirupa's palace. That was nothing to excite comment,
because in his official capacity he was always supposed to be
galloping all over the place on some errand or another. But after
dark Utirupa and Yasmini rode out of the palace unattended, which
did cause comment, Yasmini in man's clothes, as usual when she
went on some adventure. It was not seen which road they took,
which was fortunate in the circumstances.</p>

<p>Tess was up at the fort before them, waiting with Dick outside
the locked door leading to the ancient passages below. They said
nothing beyond the most perfunctory greetings, but, each taking a
kerosene lantern, passed through the door in single file, Tom
leading, and locked the door after them. That was all that the
fort guards ever knew about what happened.</p>

<p>"I've not been in," said Dick's voice from behind them. "All
I've done is force an entrance."</p>

<p>From in front Tom Tripe took up the burden.</p>

<p>"And I wouldn't have liked your job, sir! It was bad enough to
sit and guard the door. After you'd gone o' nights I'd sit for
hours with my hair on end, listening; and the dog 'ud growl
beside me as if he saw ghosts!"</p>

<p>"Maybe it was snakes," Yasmini answered. "They will flee from
the lantern-light&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Your Ladyship. I'm not afraid of snakes&mdash;except them
Scotch plaid ones that come o' brandy on top o' royal durbars!
This was the sound o' some one digging&mdash;digging all night
long down in the bowels of the earth! Look out!"</p>

<p>They all jumped, but it proved to be only Tom's own shadow
that had frightened him. His nerves were all to pieces, and Dick
Blaine took the lead. The dog was growling intermittently and
keeping close to Tom's heels.</p>

<p>They passed down a long spiral flight of stone steps into a
sort of cavern that had been used for ammunition room. The
departing British troops had left a dozen ancient cannon balls,
not all of which were in one place. The smooth flags of the floor
were broken, and at the far end one very heavy stone was lifted
and laid back, disclosing a dark hole.</p>

<p>"I used the cannon balls," said Dick, "to drop on the stones
and listen for a hollow noise. Once I found that, the game was
simple."</p>

<p>Leading down into the dark hole were twelve more steps,
descending straight, but turning sharply at the bottom. Dick led
the way.</p>

<p>"The next sight's gruesome!" he announced, his voice booming
hollow among the shadows.</p>

<p>The passage turned into a lofty chamber in the rock, whose
walls once had all been lined with dressed stone, but some of the
lining had fallen. In the shadows at one end an image of Jinendra
smiled complacently, and there were some ancient brass lamps
banging on chains from arches cut into the rock on every
side.</p>

<p>"This is the grue," said Dick, holding his lantern high.</p>

<p>Its light fell on a circle of skeletons, all perfect, each
with its head toward a brass bowl in the center.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" growled Tom Tripe. "Those are the ghosts that dig o'
nights! Go smell 'em, Trotters! Are they the enemy?"</p>

<p>The dog sniffed the bones, but slunk away again
uninterested.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing!" laughed Dick. "You haven't laid the ghost
yet, Tom!"</p>

<p>"Have you got your pistols with you?" Tom retorted, patting
his own jacket to show the bulge of one beneath it.</p>

<p>"Those," said Yasmini, standing between the skeletons and
holding up her own light, "are the bones of priests, who died
when the secret of the place was taken from them! My father told
me they were left to starve to death. This was Jinendra's
temple."</p>

<p>"D'you suppose they pulled that cut stone from the walls,
trying to force a way out?" Dick hazarded. "The lid of the hole
we came down through is a foot thick, and was set solid in
cement; they couldn't have lifted that if they tried for a week.
Everything's solid in this place. I sounded every inch of the
floor with a cannon ball, but it's all hard underneath."</p>

<p>"I would have gone straight to the image of Jinendra," said
Yasmini. "Jinendra smiles and keeps his secrets so well that I
should have suspected him at once!"</p>

<p>"I went to that last," Dick answered. "It looks so like a
piece of high relief carved out of the rock wall. As a matter of
fact, though, it's about six tons of quartz with a vein of gold
in it&mdash;see the gold running straight up the line of the nose
and over the middle of the head?&mdash;I pried it away from the
wall at last with steel wedges, and there's just room to squeeze
in behind it. Beyond that is another wall that I had to cut
through with a chisel. Who goes in first?"</p>

<p>"Who looks for gold finds gold!" Yasmini quoted. "The vein of
gold you have been mining was the clue to the secret all
along."</p>

<p>She would have led the way, but Utirupa stopped her.</p>

<p>"If there is danger," he said, "it is my place to lead."</p>

<p>But nobody would permit that, Yasmini least of all.</p>

<p>"Shall Samson choose a new maharajah so soon as all that?" she
laughed.</p>

<p>"Let the dog go first!" Tom proposed. Trotters was sniffing at
the dark gap behind Jinendra's image, with eyes glaring and a low
rumbling growl issuing from between bared teeth. But Trotters
would not go.</p>

<p>Finally, in the teeth of remonstrances from Tess, Dick cocked
a pistol and, with his lantern in the other hand, strode in
boldly. Trotters followed him, and Tom Tripe next. Then Utirupa.
Then the women.</p>

<p>Nothing happened. The passage was about ten feet long and a
yard wide. They squeezed one at a time through the narrow break
Dick had made in the end of it, into a high, pitch-dark cave that
smelt unexplainably of wood-smoke, Dick standing just inside the
gap to bold the lantern for them and help them
through&mdash;continuing to stand there after Tess had entered
last.</p>

<p>"Jee-rusalem!" he exclaimed. "This is where I lose out!"</p>

<p>The first glance was enough to show that they stood in the
secret treasure-vault of Sialpore. There were ancient gold coins
in heaps on the floor where they had burst by their own weight
out of long-demolished bags &mdash;countless coins; and drums and
bags and boxes more of them behind. But what made Dick exclaim
were the bars of silver stacked at the rear and along one side in
rows as high as a man.</p>

<p>"My contract reads gold!" he said. "A percentage of all gold.
There's not a word in it of silver. Who'd ever have thought of
finding silver, anyhow, in this old mountain?"</p>

<p>"Your percentage of the gold will make you rich," said
Utirupa. "But you shall take silver too. Without you we might
have found nothing for years to come."</p>

<p>"A contract's a contract," Dick answered. "I drew it myself,
and it stands."</p>

<p>"Look out!" yelled Tom Tripe suddenly. But the warning came
too late.</p>

<p>Out of the shadow behind a stack of silver bars rushed a man
with a long dagger, stabbing frantically at Dick. Tom's great
barking army revolver missed, filling the chamber with noise and
smoke, for he used black powder.</p>

<p>Down went Dick under his assailant, and the dagger rose and
fell in spasmodic jerks. Dick had hold of the man's wrist, but
the dagger-point dripped blood and the fury of the attack
increased as Dick appeared to weaken. Utirupa ran in to drag the
assailant off, but Trotters got there first&mdash;chose his
neck-hold like a wolf in battle&mdash;and in another second Dick
was free with Tess kneeling beside him while a life-and-death
fight between animal and man raged between the bars of
silver.</p>

<p>"Gungadhura!" Yasmini shouted, waving her lantern for a sight
of the struggling man's face. He was lashing out savagely with
the long knife, but the dog had him by the neck from behind, and
he only inflicted surface wounds.</p>

<p>"Hell's bells! He'll kill my dog!" roared Tom. "Hi, Trotters.
Here, you &mdash;Trotters!"</p>

<p>But the dog took that for a call to do his thinking, and let
go for a better hold. His long fangs closed again on the victim's
jugular, and tore it out. The long knife clattered on the stone
floor, and then Tom got his dog by the jaws and hauled him
off.</p>

<p>"You can't blame the dog," he grumbled. "He knew the smell of
him. He'd been told to kill him if he got the chance."</p>

<p>"Gungadhura!" said Yasmini again, holding her lantern over the
dying man. "So Gungadhura was Tom Tripe's ghost! What a pity that
the dog should kill him, when all he wanted was a battle to the
death with me! I would have given him his fight!"</p>

<p>Dick was in no bad way. He had three flesh wounds on his right
side, and none of them serious. Tess stanched them with torn
linen, and she and Tom Tripe propped him against some bags of
bullion, while Utirupa threw his cloak over Gungadhura's dead
body.</p>

<p>"How did Gungadhura get in here?" wondered Tess.</p>

<p>"Through the hole at the end of the mine-shaft, I suppose,"
said Dick. "I built up the lower one&mdash;he came one day and
saw me doing it&mdash; but left a space at the top that looked
too small for a man to crawl through. Then I blocked the mouth of
the tunnel afterward, and shut him in, I suppose. He's had the
men's rice and water-bottles, and they left a lot of faggots in
the tunnel, too, I remember. That accounts for the smell of
smoke."</p>

<p>"But what was the digging I've heard o' nights?" demanded Tom.
"I'm not the only one. The British garrison was scared out of its
wits."</p>

<p>Utirupa was hunting about with a lantern in his hand, watching
the dog go sniffing in the shadows.</p>

<p>"Come and see what he has done!" he called suddenly, and
Yasmini ran to his side.</p>

<p>In a corner of the vault one of the great facing stones had
been removed, disclosing a deep fissure in the rock. One of Dick
Blaine's crow-bars that he had left in the tunnel lay beside
it.</p>

<p>"He must have found that by tapping," said Tom Tripe.</p>

<p>"Yes, but look why he wanted it!" Yasmini answered. "Tom,
could you be as malicious as that?"</p>

<p>"As what, Your Ladyship?"</p>

<p>"See, he has poured gold into the fissure, hoping to close it
up again so that nobody could find it!"</p>

<p>"But why didn't he work his way out with the crow-bar?" Dick
objected from his perch between the bags of bullion.</p>

<p>"What was his life worth to him outside?" Yasmini asked.
"Samson knew who murdered Mukhum Dass. He would have been a
prisoner for the rest of his life to all intents and purposes.
No! He preferred to hide the treasure again, and then wait here
for me, suspecting that I knew where it is and would come for it!
Only we came too soon, before he had it hidden!"</p>

<p>But it was Patali afterward, between boasting and confession,
who explained that Dick was Gungadhura's real objective after
all. He preferred vengeance on the American even to a settled
account with Yasmini. He must have found the treasure by accident
after crawling into the unsealed crack in the wall to wait there
against Dick's coming.</p>

<p>"The money must stay here, and be removed little by little,"
said Utirupa.</p>

<p>"First of all Blaine sahib's share of it!" Yasmini added. "Who
shall count it? Who!"</p>

<p>"Never mind the money now," Tess answered. "Dick's alive! When
did you first know you'd found the treasure, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Not until the day that Gungadhura found me closing up the
fault, and asked me to dig at the other place. The princess told
me I was on the trail of it that night that you went with her by
camel; but I didn't know I'd found it till the day that
Gungadhura came."</p>

<p>"How did you know where it was?" Tess asked, and Yasmini
laughed.</p>

<p>"A hundred guarded it. I looked for a hundred pipal trees, and
found them &mdash;near the River Palace. But they were not
changed once a month. I looked from there, and saw another
hundred pipal trees&mdash;here, below this fort&mdash;exactly a
hundred. But neither were they changed once a month. Then I
counted the garrison of the fort&mdash;exactly a hundred, all
told. Then I knew. Then I remembered that 'who looks for gold
finds gold,' and saw your husband digging for it. It seemed to me
that the vein of gold he was following should lead to the
treasure, so I pulled strings until Samson blundered, trying to
trick us. And now we have the treasure, and the English do not
know. And I am maharani, as they do know, and shall know still
better before I have finished! But what are we to do with
Gungadhura's body? It shall not lie here to rot; it must have a
decent burial."</p>

<p>Very late that night, Tom Tripe moved the guards about on the
bastions, contriving that the road below should not be overlooked
by any one. The moon had gone down, so that it was difficult to
see ten paces. He produced an ekka from somewhere&mdash;one of
those two-wheeled carts drawn by one insignificant pony that do
most of the unpretentious work of India; and he and Ismail, the
Afridi gate-man, drove off into the darkness with a covered
load.</p>

<p>Early next morning Gungadhura's body was found in the great
hole that Samson's men had blasted in the River Palace grounds,
and it was supposed that a jackal had mangled his body after
death.</p>

<p>That was what gave rise to the story that the English got the
treasure after all, and that Gungadhura, enraged and mortified at
finding it gone, had committed suicide in the great hole it was
taken from. They call the great dead pipal tree that is the only
one left now of the hundred, Gungadhura's gibbet; and there is
quite a number, even of English people, who believe that the
Indian Government got the money. But I say no, because Yasmini
told me otherwise. And if it were true that t he English really
got the money, what did they do with it and why was Samson
removed shortly afterward to a much less desirable post? Any one
could see how Utirupa prospered, and he never raised the taxes
half a mill.</p>

<p>Samson had his very shrewd suspicions, one of which was that
that damned American with his smart little wife had scored off
him in some way. But he went to his new post, at about the same
time that the Blaines left for other parts, with some of the
sting removed from his hurt feelings. For he took Blaine's rifle
with him&mdash;a good one; and the horse and dog-cart, and a
riding pony&mdash;more than a liberal return for payment of a
three-thousand rupee bet. Pretty decent of Blaine on the whole,
he thought. No fuss. No argument. Simply a short note of
farewell, and a request that he would "find the horses a home and
a use for the other things." Not bad. Not a bad fellow after
all.</p> <hr> <br>

<p class="first">SMOKING a cigarette lazily on Utirupa's palace
roof, Yasmini reached for Tess's hand.</p>

<p>"Come nearer. See&mdash;take this. It is the value, and more,
of the percentage of the silver that your husband would not
take."</p>

<p>She clasped a diamond necklace around Tess's neck, and watched
it gleam and sparkle in the refracted sunlight.</p>

<p>"Don't you love it? Aren't they perfect? And now&mdash;you've
a great big draft of money, so I suppose you're both off to
America, and good-by to me forever?"</p>

<p>"For a long time."</p>

<p>"But why such a long time? You must come again soon. Come next
year. You and I love each other. You teach me things I did not
know, and you never irritate me. I love you. You must come back
next year!"</p>

<p>Tess shook her head.</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"They say the climate isn't good for them until they're
eighteen at least &mdash;some say twenty."</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh, I envy you! What will you call him? It will be a
boy&mdash;it is sure to be a boy!"</p>

<p>"Richard will be one name, after my husband."</p>

<p>"And the other? You must name him after me in some way. You
can not call a boy Yasmini. Would Utirupa sound too strange in
America?"</p>

<p>"Rupert would sound better."</p>

<p>"Good! He shall be Rupert, and I will send a gift to him!"</p>

<p>(That accounts for the initials R.R.B. on a certain young
man's trunk at Yale, and for the imported pedigree horse he rides
during vacation&mdash; the third one, by the way, of a succession
he has received from India.)</p>

<p>And that is the whole story, as Yasmini told it to me in the
wonderful old palace at Buhl, years afterward, when Utirupa was
dead, and the English Government had sent her into forced
seclusion for a while&mdash;to repent of her manifold political
sins, as they thought&mdash;and to start new enterprises as it
happened. She had not seen Theresa Blaine again, she told me,
although they always corresponded; and she assured me over and
over again, calling the painted figures of the old gods on the
walls to witness, that but for Theresa Blaine's companionship and
affection at the right moment, she would never have had the
courage to do what she did, even though the guns of the gods were
there to help her.</p>
