  <h2><a name="fore"
     id="fore">FOREWORD</a></h2>

<p class="first">I AM a medical man specializing in neurology and
diseases of the brain. My peculiar field is abnormal psychology,
and in it I am recognized as an expert. I am closely connected
with two of the foremost hospitals in New York, and have received
many honors in this country and abroad. I set this down, risking
identification, not through egotism but because I desire to show
that I was competent to observe, and competent to bring practiced
scientific judgment upon, the singular events I am about to
relate.</p>

<p>I say that I risk identification, because Lowell is not my
name. It is a pseudonym, as are the names of all the other
characters in this narrative. The reasons for this evasion will
become increasingly apparent.</p>

<p>Yet I have the strongest feeling that the facts and
observations which in my casebooks are grouped under the heading
of "The Dolls of Mme. Mandilip" should be clarified, set down in
orderly sequence and be made known. Obviously, I could do this in
the form of a report to one of my medical societies, but I am too
well aware of the way my colleagues would receive such a paper,
and with what suspicion, pity or even abhorrence, they would
henceforth regard me, so counter to accepted notions of cause and
effect do many of these facts and observations run.</p>

<p>But now, orthodox man of medicine that I am, I ask myself
whether there may not be causes other than those we admit. Forces
and energies which we stubbornly disavow because we can find no
explanation for them within the narrow confines of our present
knowledge. Energies whose reality is recognized in folklore, the
ancient traditions, of all peoples, and which, to justify our
ignorance, we label myth and superstition.</p>

<p>A wisdom, a science, immeasurably old. Born before history,
but never dying nor ever wholly lost. A secret wisdom, but always
with its priests and priestesses guarding its dark flame, passing
it on from century to century. Dark flame of forbidden
knowledge... burning in Egypt before even the Pyramids were
raised; and in temples crumbling now beneath the Gobi's sands;
known to the sons of Ad whom Allah, so say the Arabs, turned to
stone for their sorceries ten thousand years before Abraham trod
the streets of Ur of the Chaldees; known in China&mdash;and known
to the Tibetan lama, the Buryat shaman of the steppes and to the
warlock of the South Seas alike.</p>

<p>Dark flame of evil wisdom... deepening the shadows of
Stonehenge's brooding menhirs; fed later by hands of Roman
legionaries; gathering strength, none knows why, in medieval
Europe... and still burning, still alive, still strong.</p>

<p>Enough of preamble. I begin where the dark wisdom, if that it
were, first cast its shadow upon me.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE UNKNOWN
DEATH</h2>

<p class="first">I HEARD the clock strike one as I walked up the
hospital steps. Ordinarily I would have been in bed and asleep,
but there was a case in which I was much interested, and Braile,
my assistant, had telephoned me of certain developments which I
wished to observe. It was a night in early November. I paused for
a moment at the top of the steps to look at the brilliancy of the
stars. As I did so an automobile drew up at the entrance to the
hospital.</p>

<p>As I stood, wondering what its arrival at that hour meant, a
man slipped out of it. He looked sharply up and down the deserted
street, then threw the door wide open. Another man emerged. The
two of them stooped and seemed to be fumbling around inside. They
straightened and then I saw that they had locked their arms
around the shoulders of a third. They moved forward, not
supporting but carrying this other man. His head hung upon his
breast and his body swung limply.</p>

<p>A fourth man stepped from the automobile.</p>

<p>I recognized him. He was Julian Ricori, a notorious underworld
chieftain, one of the finished products of the Prohibition Law.
He had been pointed out to me several times. Even if he had not
been, the newspapers would have made me familiar with his
features and figure. Lean and long, with silvery white hair,
always immaculately dressed, a leisured type from outward
seeming, rather than leader of such activities as those of which
he was accused.</p>

<p>I had been standing in the shadow, unnoticed. I stepped out of
the shadow. Instantly the burdened pair halted, swiftly as
hunting hounds. Their free hands dropped into the pockets of
their coats. Menace was in that movement.</p>

<p>"I am Dr. Lowell," I said, hastily. "Connected with the
hospital. Come right along."</p>

<p>They did not answer me. Nor did their gaze waver from me; nor
did they move. Ricori stepped in front of them. His hands were
also in his pockets. He looked me over, then nodded to the
others; I felt the tension relax.</p>

<p>"I know you, Doctor," he said pleasantly, in oddly precise
English. "But that was quite a chance you took. If I might advise
you, it is not well to move so quickly when those come whom you
do not know, and at night&mdash; not in this town."</p>

<p>"But," I said, "I do know you, Mr. Ricori."</p>

<p>"Then," he smiled, faintly, "your judgment was doubly at
fault. And my advice doubly pertinent."</p>

<p>There was an awkward moment of silence. He broke it.</p>

<p>"And being who I am, I shall feel much better inside your
doors than outside."</p>

<p>I opened the doors. The two men passed through with their
burden, and after them Ricori and I. Once within, I gave way to
my professional instincts and stepped up to the man the two were
carrying. They shot a quick glance at Ricori. He nodded. I raised
the man's head.</p>

<p>A little shock went through me. The man's eyes were wide open.
He was neither dead nor unconscious. But upon his face was the
most extraordinary expression of terror I had ever seen in a long
experience with sane, insane and borderland cases. It was not
undiluted fear. It was mixed with an equally disturbing horror.
The eyes, blue and with distended pupils, were like exclamation
points to the emotions printed upon that face. They stared up at
me, through me and beyond me. And still they seemed to be looking
inward &mdash;as though whatever nightmare vision they were
seeing was both behind and in front of them.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Ricori had been watching me closely. "Exactly, Dr.
Lowell, what could it be that my friend has seen&mdash;or has
been given&mdash;that could make him appear so? I am most anxious
to learn. I am willing to spend much money to learn. I wish him
cured, yes&mdash;but I shall be frank with you, Dr. Lowell. I
would give my last penny for the certainty that those who did
this to him could not do the same thing to me&mdash;could not
make me as he is, could not make me see what he is seeing, could
not make feel what he is feeling."</p>

<p>At my signal, orderlies had come up. They took the patient and
laid him on a stretcher. By this time the resident physician had
appeared. Ricori touched my elbow.</p>

<p>"I know a great deal about you, Dr. Lowell," he said. "I would
like you to take full charge of this case."</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>He continued, earnestly: "Could you drop everything else?
Spend all your time upon it? Bring in any others you wish to
consult&mdash;don't think of expense-"</p>

<p>"A moment, Mr. Ricori," I broke in. "I have patients who
cannot be neglected. I will give all the time I can spare, and so
will my assistant, Dr. Braile. Your friend will be constantly
under observation here by people who have my complete confidence.
Do you wish me to take the case under those conditions?"</p>

<p>He acquiesced, though I could see he was not entirely
satisfied. I had the patient taken to an isolated private room,
and went through the necessary hospital formalities. Ricori gave
the man's name as Thomas Peters, asserted that he knew of no
close relations, had himself recorded at Peters' nearest friend,
assumed all responsibility, and taking out a roll of currency,
skimmed a thousand dollar bill from it, passing it to the desk as
"preliminary costs."</p>

<p>I asked Ricori if he would like to be present at my
examination. He said that he would. He spoke to his two men, and
they took positions at each side of the hospital doors&mdash;on
guard. Ricori and I went to the room assigned to the patient. The
orderlies had stripped him, and he lay upon the adjustable cot,
covered by a sheet. Braile, for whom I had sent, was bending over
Peters, intent upon his face, and plainly puzzled. I saw with
satisfaction that Nurse Walters, an unusually capable and
conscientious young woman, had been assigned to the case. Braile
looked up at me. He said: "Obviously some drug."</p>

<p>"Maybe," I answered. "But if so then a drug I have never
encountered. Look at his eyes-"</p>

<p>I closed Peters' lids. As soon as I had lifted my fingers they
began to rise, slowly, until they were again wide open. Several
times I tried to shut them. Always they opened: the terror, the
horror in them, undiminished.</p>

<p>I began my examination. The entire body was limp, muscles and
joints. It was as flaccid, the simile came to me, as a doll. It
was as though every motor nerve had gone out of business. Yet
there was none of the familiar symptoms of paralysis. Nor did the
body respond to any sensory stimulus, although I struck down into
the nerve trunks. The only reaction I could obtain was a slight
contraction of the dilated pupils under strongest light.</p>

<p>Hoskins, the pathologist, came in to take his samples for
blood tests. When he had drawn what he wanted, I went over the
body minutely. I could find not a single puncture, wound, bruise
or abrasion. Peters was hairy. With Ricori's permission, I had
him shaved clean&mdash;chest, shoulders, legs, even the head. I
found nothing to indicate that a drug might have been given him
by hypodermic. I had the stomach emptied and took specimens from
the excretory organs, including the skin. I examined the
membranes of nose and throat: they seemed healthy and normal;
nevertheless, I had smears taken from them. The blood pressure
was low, the temperature slightly subnormal; but that might mean
nothing. I gave an injection of adrenaline. There was absolutely
no reaction from it. That might mean much.</p>

<p>"Poor devil," I said to myself. "I'm going to try to kill that
nightmare for you, at any rate."</p>

<p>I gave him a minimum hypo of morphine. It might have been
water for all the good it did. Then I gave him all I dared. His
eyes remained open, terror and horror undiminished. And pulse and
respiration unchanged.</p>

<p>Ricori had watched all these operations with intense interest.
I had done all I could for the time, and told him so.</p>

<p>"I can do no more," I said, "until I receive the reports of
the specimens. Frankly, I am all at sea. I know of no disease nor
drug which would produce these conditions."</p>

<p>"But Dr. Braile," he said, "mentioned a drug-"</p>

<p>"A suggestion only," interposed Braile hastily. "Like Dr.
Lowell, I know of no drug which would cause such symptoms."</p>

<p>Ricori glanced at Peters' face and shivered.</p>

<p>"Now," I said, "I must ask you some questions. Has this man
been ill? If so, has he been under medical care? If he has not
actually been ill, has he spoken of any discomfort? Or have you
noticed anything unusual in his manner or behavior?"</p>

<p>"No, to all questions," he answered. "Peters has been in
closest touch with me for the past week. He has not been ailing
in the least. Tonight we were talking in my apartments, eating a
late and light dinner. He was in high spirits. In the middle of a
word, he stopped, half-turned his head as though listening; then
slipped from his chair to the floor. When I bent over him he was
as you see him now. That was precisely half after midnight. I
brought him here at once."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "that at least gives us the exact time of the
seizure. There is no use of your remaining, Mr. Ricori, unless
you wish."</p>

<p>He studied his hands a few moments, rubbing the carefully
manicured nails.</p>

<p>"Dr. Lowell," he said at last, "if this man dies without your
discovering what killed him, I will pay you the customary fees
and the hospital the customary charges and no more. If he dies
and you make this discovery after his death, I will give a
hundred thousand dollars to any charity you name. But if you make
the discovery before he dies, and restore him to health &mdash;I
will give you the same sum."</p>

<p>We stared at him, and then as the significance of this
remarkable offer sank in, I found it hard to curb my anger.</p>

<p>"Ricori," I said, "you and I live in different worlds,
therefore I answer you politely, although I find it difficult. I
will do all in my power to find out what is the matter with your
friend and to cure him. I would do that if he and you were
paupers. I am interested in him only as a problem which
challenges me as a physician. But I am not interested in you in
the slightest. Nor in your money. Nor in your offer. Consider it
definitely rejected. Do you thoroughly understand that?"</p>

<p>He betrayed no resentment.</p>

<p>"So much so that more than ever do I wish you to take full
charge," he said.</p>

<p>"Very well. Now where can I get you if I want to bring you
here quickly?"</p>

<p>"With your permission," he answered, "I should like to
have&mdash;well, representatives&mdash;in this room at all times.
There will be two of them. If you want me, tell them&mdash;and I
will soon be here."</p>

<p>I smiled at that, but he did not.</p>

<p>"You have reminded me," he said, "that we live in different
worlds. You take your precautions to go safely in your
world&mdash;and I order my life to minimize the perils of mine.
Not for a moment would I presume to advise you how to walk among
the dangers of your laboratory, Dr. Lowell. I have the
counterparts of those dangers. Bene&mdash;I guard against them as
best I can."</p>

<p>It was a most irregular request, of course. But I found myself
close to liking Ricori just then, and saw clearly his point of
view. He knew that and pressed the advantage.</p>

<p>"My men will be no bother," he said. "They will not interfere
in any way with you. If what I suspect to be true is true they
will be a protection for you and your aids as well. But they, and
those who relieve them, must stay in the room night and day. If
Peters is taken from the room, they must accompany him&mdash;no
matter where it is that he is taken."</p>

<p>"I can arrange it," I said. Then, at his request, I sent an
orderly down to the doors. He returned with one of the men Ricori
had left on guard. Ricori whispered to him, and he went out. In a
little while two other men came up. In the meantime I had
explained the peculiar situation to the resident and the
superintendent and secured the necessary permission for their
stay.</p>

<p>The two men were well-dressed, polite, of a singularly tight-
lipped and cold-eyed alertness. One of them shot a glance at
Peters.</p>

<p>"Christ!" he muttered.</p>

<p>The room was a corner one with two windows, one opening out on
the Drive, the other on the side street. Besides these, there
were no outer openings except the door to the hall; the private
bathroom being enclosed and having no windows. Ricori and the two
inspected the room minutely, keeping away, I noticed, from the
windows. He asked me then if the room could be darkened. Much
interested, I nodded. The lights were turned off, the three went
to the windows, opened them and carefully scrutinized the six-
story sheer drop to both streets. On the side of the Drive there
is nothing but the open space above the park. Opposite the other
side is a church.</p>

<p>"It is at this side you must watch," I heard Ricori say; he
pointed to the church. "You can turn the lights on now,
Doctor."</p>

<p>He started toward the door, then turned.</p>

<p>"I have many enemies, Dr. Lowell. Peters was my right hand. If
it was one of these enemies who struck him, he did it to weaken
me. Or, perhaps, because he had not the opportunity to strike at
me. I look at Peters, and for the first time in my life I,
Ricori&mdash;am afraid. I have no wish to be the next, I have no
wish to look into hell!"</p>

<p>I grunted at that! He had put so aptly what I had felt and had
not formulated into words.</p>

<p>He started to open the door. He hesitated.</p>

<p>"One thing more. If there should be any telephone calls
inquiring as to Peters' condition let one of these men, or their
reliefs, answer. If any should come in person making inquiry,
allow them to come up&mdash;but if they are more than one, let
only one come at a time. If any should appear, asserting that
they are relations, again let these men meet and question
them."</p>

<p>He gripped my hand, then opened the door of the room. Another
pair of the efficient-appearing retainers were awaiting him at
the threshold. They swung in before and behind him. As he walked
away, I saw that he was crossing himself vigorously.</p>

<p>I closed the door and went back into the room. I looked down
on Peters.</p>

<p>If I had been religious, I too would have been doing some
crossing. The expression on Peters' face had changed. The terror
and horror were gone. He still seemed to be looking both beyond
me and into himself, but it was a look of evil
expectancy&mdash;so evil that involuntarily I shot a glance over
my shoulder to see what ugly thing might be creeping upon me.</p>

<p>There was nothing. One of Ricori's gunmen sat in the corner of
the window, in the shadow, watching the parapet of the church
roof opposite; the other sat stolidly at the door.</p>

<p>Braile and Nurse Walters were at the other side of the bed.
Their eyes were fixed with horrified fascination on Peters' face.
And then I saw Braile turn his head and stare about the room as I
had.</p>

<p>Suddenly Peters' eyes seemed to focus, to become aware of the
three of us, to become aware of the entire room. They flashed
with an unholy glee. That glee was not maniacal&mdash;it was
diabolical. It was the look of a devil long exiled from his well-
beloved hell, and suddenly summoned to return.</p>

<p>Or was it like the glee of some devil sent hurtling out of his
hell to work his will upon whom he might?</p>

<p>Very well do I know how fantastic, how utterly unscientific,
are such comparisons. Yet not otherwise can I describe that
strange change.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly as the closing of a camera shutter, that
expression fled and the old terror and horror came back. I gave
an involuntary gasp of relief, for it was precisely as though
some evil presence had withdrawn. The nurse was trembling; Braile
asked, in a strained voice: "How about another hypodermic?"</p>

<p>"No," I said. "I want you to watch the progress of
this&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;without drugs. I'm going down to
the laboratory. Watch him closely until I return."</p>

<p>I went down to the laboratory. Hoskins looked up at me.</p>

<p>"Nothing wrong, so far. Remarkable health, I'd say. Of course
all I've results on are the simpler tests."</p>

<p>I nodded. I had an uncomfortable feeling that the other tests
also would show nothing. And I had been more shaken than I would
have cared to confess by those alternations of hellish fear,
hellish expectancy and hellish glee in Peters' face and eyes. The
whole case troubled me, gave me a nightmarish feeling of standing
outside some door which it was vitally important to open, and to
which not only did I have no key but couldn't find the keyhole. I
have found that concentration upon microscopic work often permits
me to think more freely upon problems. So I took a few smears of
Peters' blood and began to study them, not with any expectation
of finding anything, but to slip the brakes from another part of
my brain.</p>

<p>I was on my fourth slide when I suddenly realized that I was
looking at the incredible. As I had perfunctorily moved the
slide, a white corpuscle had slid into the field of vision. Only
a simple white corpuscle&mdash;but within it was a spark of
phosphorescence, shining out like a tiny lamp!</p>

<p>I thought at first that it was some effect of the light, but
no manipulation of the illumination changed that spark. I rubbed
my eyes and looked again. I called Hoskins.</p>

<p>"Tell me if you see something peculiar in there."</p>

<p>He peered into the microscope. He started, then shifted the
light as I had.</p>

<p>"What do you see, Hoskins?"</p>

<p>He said, still staring through the lens:</p>

<p>"A leucocyte inside of which is a globe of phosphorescence.
Its glow is neither dimmed when I turn on the full illumination,
nor is it increased when I lessen it. In all except the ingested
globe the corpuscle seems normal."</p>

<p>"And all of which," I said, "is quite impossible."</p>

<p>"Quite," he agreed, straightening. "Yet there it is!"</p>

<p>I transferred the slide to the micro-manipulator, hoping to
isolate the corpuscle, and touched it with the tip of the
manipulating needle. At the instant of contact the corpuscle
seemed to burst. The globe of phosphorescence appeared to
flatten, and something like a miniature flash of heat-lightning
ran over the visible portion of the slide.</p>

<p>And that was all&mdash;the phosphorescence was gone.</p>

<p>We prepared and examined slide after slide. Twice more we
found a tiny shining globe, and each time with the same result,
the bursting corpuscle, the strange flicker of faint
luminosity&mdash;then nothing.</p>

<p>The laboratory 'phone rang. Hoskins answered.</p>

<p>"It's Braile. He wants you&mdash;quick."</p>

<p>"Keep after it, Hoskins," I said, and hastened to Peters'
room. Entering, I saw Nurse Walters, face chalk white, eyes
closed, standing with her back turned to the bed. Braile was
leaning over the patient, stethoscope to his heart. I looked at
Peters; and stood stock still, something like a touch of
unreasoning panic at my own heart. Upon his face was that look of
devilish expectancy, but intensified. As I looked, it gave way to
the diabolic joy, and that, too, was intensified. The face held
it for not many seconds. Back came the expectancy then on its
heels the unholy glee. The two expressions alternated, rapidly.
They flickered over Peters' face like&mdash;like the flickers of
the tiny lights within the corpuscles of his blood. Braile spoke
to me through stiff lips:</p>

<p>"His heart stopped three minutes ago! He ought to be
dead&mdash;yet listen-"</p>

<p>The body of Peters stretched and stiffened. A sound came from
his lips &mdash;a chuckling sound; low yet singularly
penetrating, inhuman, the chattering laughter of a devil. The
gunman at the window leaped to his feet, his chair going over
with a crash. The laughter choked and died away, and the body of
Peters lay limp.</p>

<p>I heard the door open, and Ricori's voice: "How is he, Dr.
Lowell? I could not sleep-" He saw Peters' face.</p>

<p>"Mother of Christ!" I heard him whisper. He dropped to his
knees.</p>

<p>I saw him dimly for I could not take my eyes from Peters'
face. It was the face of a grinning, triumphant fiend&mdash;all
humanity wiped from it &mdash;the face of a demon straight out of
some mad medieval painter's hell. The blue eyes, now utterly
malignant, glared at Ricori.</p>

<p>And as I looked, the dead hands moved; slowly the arms bent up
from the elbows, the fingers contracting like claws; the dead
body began to stir beneath the covers -</p>

<p>At that the spell of nightmare dropped from me; for the first
time in hours I was on ground that I knew. It was the rigor
mortis, the stiffening of death&mdash;but setting in more quickly
and proceeding at a rate I had never known.</p>

<p>I stepped forward and drew the lids down over the glaring
eyes. I covered the dreadful face.</p>

<p>I looked at Ricori. He was still on his knees, crossing
himself and praying. And kneeling beside him, arm around his
shoulders, was Nurse Walters, and she, too, was praying.</p>

<p>Somewhere a clock struck five.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE
QUESTIONNAIRE</h2>

<p class="first">I OFFERED to go home with Ricori, and somewhat
to my surprise he accepted with alacrity. The man was pitiably
shaken. We rode silently, the tight-lipped gunmen alert. Peters'
face kept floating before me.</p>

<p>I gave Ricori a strong sedative, and left him sleeping, his
men on guard. I had told him that I meant to make a complete
autopsy.</p>

<p>Returning to the hospital in his car, I found the body of
Peters had been taken to the mortuary. Rigor mortis, Braile told
me, had been complete in less than an hour&mdash;an astonishingly
short time. I made the necessary arrangements for the autopsy,
and took Braile home with me to snatch a few hours sleep. It is
difficult to convey by words the peculiarly unpleasant impression
the whole occurrence had made upon me. I can only say that I was
as grateful for Braile's company as he seemed to be for mine.</p>

<p>When I awoke, the nightmarish oppression still lingered,
though not so strongly. It was about two when we began the
autopsy. I lifted the sheet from Peters' body with noticeable
hesitation. I stared at his face with amazement. All diabolism
had been wiped away. It was serene, unlined&mdash;the face of a
man who had died peacefully, with no agony either of body or
mind. I lifted his hand, it was limp, the whole body flaccid, the
rigor gone.</p>

<p>It was then, I think, that I first felt full conviction I was
dealing with an entirely new, or at least unknown, agency of
death, whether microbic or otherwise. As a rule, rigor does not
set in for sixteen to twenty-four hours, depending upon the
condition of the patient before death, temperature and a dozen
other things. Normally, it does not disappear for forty-eight to
seventy-two hours. Usually a rapid setting-in of the stiffening
means as rapid a disappearance, and vice versa. Diabetics stiffen
quicker than others. A sudden brain injury, like shooting, is
even swifter. In this case, the rigor had begun instantaneously
with death, and must have completed its cycle in the
astonishingly short time of less than five hours&mdash;for the
attendant told me that he had examined the body about ten o'clock
and he had thought that stiffening had not yet set in. As a
matter of fact, it had come and gone.</p>

<p>The results of the autopsy can be told in two sentences. There
was no ascertainable reason why Peters should not be alive. And
he was dead!</p>

<p>Later, when Hoskins made his reports, both of these utterly
conflicting statements continued to be true. There was no reason
why Peters should be dead. Yet dead he was. If the enigmatic
lights we had observed had anything to do with his death, they
left no traces. His organs were perfect, all else as it should
have been; he was, indeed, an extraordinarily healthy specimen.
Nor had Hoskins been able to capture any more of the light-
carrying corpuscles after I had left him.</p>

<p>That night I framed a short letter describing briefly the
symptoms observed in Peters' case, not dwelling upon the changes
in expression but referring cautiously to "unusual grimaces" and
a "look of intense fear." Braile and I had this manifold and
mailed to every physician in Greater New York. I personally
attended to a quiet inquiry to the same effect among the
hospitals. The letters asked if the physicians had treated any
patients with similar symptoms, and if so to give particulars,
names, addresses, occupations and any characteristic
interest&mdash;under seal, of course, of professional confidence.
I flattered myself that my reputation was such that none of those
who received the questionnaires would think the request actuated
either by idle curiosity or slightest unethical motive.</p>

<p>I received in response seven letters and a personal visit from
the writer of one of them. Each letter, except one, gave me in
various degrees of medical conservatism, the information I had
asked. After reading them, there was no question that within six
months seven persons of oddly dissimilar characteristics and
stations in life had died as had Peters.</p>

<p>Chronologically, the cases were as follows:</p>

<ol> <li>May 25: Ruth Bailey, spinster; fifty years old;
moderately wealthy; Social Registerite and best of reputation;
charitable and devoted to children.</li>

<li>June 20: Patrick McIlraine; bricklayer; wife and two
children.</li>

<li>August 1: Anita Green; child of eleven; parents in moderate
circumstances and well educated.</li>

<li>August 15: Steve Standish; acrobat; thirty; wife and three
children.</li>

<li>August 30: John J. Marshall; banker; sixty interested in
child welfare.</li>

<li>September 10: Phineas Dimott; thirty-five; trapeze performer;
wife and small child.</li>

<li>October 12: Hortense Darnley; about thirty; no
occupation.</li> </ol>

<p>Their addresses, except two, were widely scattered throughout
the city.</p>

<p>Each of the letters noted the sudden onset of rigor mortis and
its rapid passing. Each of them gave the time of death following
the initial seizure as approximately five hours. Five of them
referred to the changing expressions which had so troubled me; in
the guarded way they did it I read the bewilderment of the
writers.</p>

<p>"Patient's eyes remained open," recorded the physician in
charge of the spinster Bailey. "Staring, but gave no sign of
recognition of surroundings and failed to focus upon or present
any evidence of seeing objects held before them. Expression one
of intense terror, giving away toward death to others peculiarly
disquieting to observer. The latter intensified after death
ensued. Rigor mortis complete and dissipated within five
hours."</p>

<p>The physician in charge of McIlraine, the bricklayer, had
nothing to say about the ante-mortem phenomena, but wrote at some
length about the expression of his patient's face after
death.</p>

<p>"It had," he reported, "nothing in common with the muscular
contraction of the so-called 'Hippocratic countenance,' nor was
it in any way the staring eyes and contorted mouth familiarly
known as the death grin. There was no suggestion of agony, after
the death&mdash;rather the opposite. I would term the expression
one of unusual malice."</p>

<p>The report of the physician who had attended Standish, the
acrobat, was perfunctory, but it mentioned that "after patient
had apparently died, singularly disagreeable sounds emanated from
his throat." I wondered whether these had been the same demonic
vociferations that had come from Peters, and, if so, I could not
wonder at all at my correspondent's reticence concerning
them.</p>

<p>I knew the physician who had attended the
banker&mdash;opinionated, pompous, a perfect doctor of the very
rich.</p>

<p>"There can be no mystery as to the cause of death," he wrote.
"It was certainly thrombosis, a clot somewhere in the brain. I
attach no importance whatever to the facial grimaces, nor to the
time element involved in the rigor. You know, my dear Lowell," he
added, patronizingly, "it is an axiom in forensic medicine that
one can prove anything by rigor mortis."</p>

<p>I would have liked to have replied that when in doubt
thrombosis as a diagnosis is equally as useful in covering the
ignorance of practitioners, but it would not have punctured his
complacency.</p>

<p>The Dimott report was a simple record with no comment whatever
upon grimaces or sounds.</p>

<p>But the doctor who had attended little Anita had not been so
reticent.</p>

<p>"The child," he wrote, "had been beautiful. She seemed to
suffer no pain, but at the onset of the illness I was shocked by
the intensity of terror in her fixed gaze. It was like a waking
nightmare&mdash;for unquestionably she was conscious until death.
Morphine in almost lethal dosage produced no change in this
symptom, nor did it seem to have any effect upon heart or
respiration. Later the terror disappeared, giving way to other
emotions which I hesitate to describe in this report, but will do
so in person if you so desire. The aspect of the child after
death was peculiarly disturbing, but again I would rather speak
than write of that."</p>

<p>There was a hastily scrawled postscript; I could see him
hesitating, then giving way at last to the necessity of
unburdening his mind, dashing off that postscript and rushing the
letter away before he could reconsider -</p>

<p>"I have written that the child was conscious until death. What
haunts me is the conviction that she was conscious after physical
death! Let me talk to you."</p>

<p>I nodded with satisfaction. I had not dared to put that
observation down in my questionnaire. And if it has been true of
the other cases, as I now believed it must have been, all the
doctors except Standish's had shared my conservatism&mdash;or
timidity. I called little Anita's physician upon the 'phone at
once. He was strongly perturbed. In every detail his case had
paralleled that of Peters. He kept repeating over and over:</p>

<p>"The child was sweet and good as an angel, and she changed
into a devil!"</p>

<p>I promised to keep him apprised of any discoveries I might
make, and shortly after our conversation I was visited by the
young physician who had attended Hortense Darnley. Doctor Y, as I
shall call him, had nothing to add to the medical aspect other
than what I already knew, but his talk suggested the first
practical line of approach toward the problem.</p>

<p>His office, he said, was in the apartment house which had been
Hortense Darnley's home. He had been working late, and had been
summoned to her apartment about ten o'clock by the woman's maid,
a colored girl. He had found the patient lying upon her bed, and
had at once been struck by the expression of terror on her face
and the extraordinary limpness of her body. He described her as
blonde, blue-eyed&mdash;"the doll type."</p>

<p>A man was in the apartment. He had at first evaded giving his
name, saying that he was merely a friend. At first glance, Dr. Y
had thought the woman had been subjected to some violence, but
examination revealed no bruises or other injuries. The "friend"
had told him they had been eating dinner when "Miss Darnley
flopped right down on the floor as though all her bones had gone
soft, and we couldn't get anything out of her." The maid
confirmed this. There was a half-eaten dinner on the table, and
both man and servant declared Hortense had been in the best of
spirits. There had been no quarrel. Reluctantly, the "friend" had
admitted that the seizure had occurred three hours before, and
that they had tried to "bring her about" themselves, calling upon
him only when the alternating expressions which I have referred
to in the case of Peters began to appear.</p>

<p>As the seizure progressed, the maid had become hysterical with
fright and fled. The man was of tougher timber and had remained
until the end. He had been much shaken, as had Dr. Y, by the
after-death phenomena. Upon the physician declaring that the case
was one for the coroner, he had lost his reticence, volunteering
his name as James Martin, and expressing himself as eager for a
complete autopsy. He was quite frank as to his reasons. The
Darnley woman had been his mistress, and he "had enough trouble
without her death pinned to me."</p>

<p>There had been a thorough autopsy. No trace of disease or
poison had been found. Beyond a slight valvular trouble of the
heart, Hortense Darnley had been perfectly healthy. The verdict
had been death by heart disease. But Dr. Y was perfectly
convinced the heart had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>It was, of course, quite obvious that Hortense Darnley had
died from the same cause or agency as had all the others. But to
me the outstanding fact was that her apartment had been within a
stone's throw of the address Ricori had given me as that of
Peters. Furthermore, Martin was of the same world, if Dr. Y's
impressions were correct. Here was conceivably a link between two
of the cases&mdash;missing in the others. I determined to call in
Ricori, to lay all the cards before him, and enlist his aid if
possible.</p>

<p>My investigation had consumed about two weeks. During that
time I had become well acquainted with Ricori. For one thing he
interested me immensely as a product of present-day conditions;
for another I liked him, despite his reputation. He was
remarkably well read, of a high grade of totally unmoral
intelligence, subtle and superstitious&mdash;in olden time he
would probably have been a Captain of Condottieri, his wits and
sword for hire. I wondered what were his antecedents. He had paid
me several visits since the death of Peters, and quite plainly my
liking was reciprocated. On these visits he was guarded by the
tight-lipped man who had watched by the hospital window. This
man's name, I learned, was McCann. He was Ricori's most trusted
bodyguard, apparently wholly devoted to his white-haired chief.
He was an interesting character too, and quite approved of me. He
was a drawling Southerner who had been, as he put it, "a cow-
nurse down Arizona way, and then got too popular on the
Border."</p>

<p>"I'm for you, Doc," he told me. "You're sure good for the
boss. Sort of take his mind off business. An' when I come here I
can keep my hands outa my pockets. Any time anybody's cutting in
on your cattle, let me know. I'll ask for a day off."</p>

<p>Then he remarked casually that he "could ring a quarter with
six holes at a hundred foot range."</p>

<p>I did not know whether this was meant humorously or seriously.
At any rate, Ricori never went anywhere without him; and it
showed me how much he had thought of Peters that he had left
McCann to guard him.</p>

<p>I got in touch with Ricori and asked him to take dinner with
Braile and me that night at my house. At seven he arrived,
telling his chauffeur to return at ten. We sat at the table with
McCann, as usual, on watch in my hall, thrilling, I knew, my two
night nurses&mdash;I have a small private hospital
adjunct&mdash;by playing the part of a gunman as conceived by the
motion pictures.</p>

<p>Dinner over, I dismissed the butler and came to the point. I
told Ricori of my questionnaire, remarking that by it I had
unearthed seven cases similar to that of Peters.</p>

<p>"You can dismiss from your mind any idea that Peters' death
was due to his connection with you, including the tiny globes of
radiance in the blood of Peters."</p>

<p>At that his face grew white. He crossed himself.</p>

<p>"La strega!" he muttered. "The Witch! The Witch-fire!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man!" I said. "Forget your damned superstitions. I
want help."</p>

<p>"You are scientifically ignorant! There are some things, Dr.
Lowell-" he began, hotly; then controlled himself.</p>

<p>"What is it you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"First," I said, "let's go over these eight cases, analyze
them. Braile, have you come to any conclusions?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Braile answered. "I think all eight were murdered!"</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE DEATH AND NURSE
WALTERS</h2>

<p class="first">THAT Braile had voiced the thought lurking
behind my own mind&mdash;and without a shred of evidence so far
as I could see to support it&mdash; irritated me.</p>

<p>"You're a better man than I am, Sherlock Holmes," I said
sarcastically. He flushed, but repeated stubbornly:</p>

<p>"They were murdered."</p>

<p>"La strega!" whispered Ricori. I glared at him.</p>

<p>"Quit beating around the bush, Braile. What's your
evidence?"</p>

<p>"You were away from Peters almost two hours; I was with him
practically from start to finish. As I studied him, I had the
feeling that the whole trouble was in the mind&mdash;that it was
not his body, his nerves, his brain, that refused to function,
but his will. Not quite that, either. Put it that his will had
ceased to care about the functions of the body&mdash;and was
centered upon killing it!"</p>

<p>"What you're outlining now is not murder but suicide. Well, it
has been done. I've watched a few die because they had lost the
will to live-"</p>

<p>"I don't mean that," he interrupted. "That's passive. This was
active&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good God, Braile!" I was honestly shocked. "Don't tell me
you're suggesting all eight passed from the picture by willing
themselves out of it &mdash;and one of them only an eleven-year-
old child!"</p>

<p>"I didn't say that," he replied. "What I felt was that it was
not primarily Peters' own will doing it, but another's will,
which had gripped his, had wound itself around, threaded itself
through his will. Another's will which he could not, or did not
want to resist&mdash;at least toward the end."</p>

<p>"La maledetta strega!" muttered Ricori again.</p>

<p>I curbed my irritation and sat considering; after all, I had a
wholesome respect for Braile. He was too good a man, too sound,
for one to ride roughshod over any idea he might voice.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea as to how these murders, if murders they
are, were carried out?" I asked politely.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," said Braile.</p>

<p>"Let's consider the murder theory. Ricori, you have had more
experience in this line than we, so listen carefully and forget
your witch," I said, brutally enough. "There are three essential
factors to any murder&mdash; method, opportunity, motive. Take
them in order. First&mdash;the method.</p>

<p>"There are three ways a person can be killed by poison or by
infection: through the nose&mdash;and this includes by
gases&mdash;through the mouth and through the skin. There are two
or three other avenues. Hamlet's father, for example, was
poisoned, we read, through the ears, although I've always had my
doubts about that. I think, pursuing the hypothesis of murder, we
can bar out all approaches except mouth, nose, skin&mdash;and, by
the last, entrance to the blood can be accomplished by absorption
as well as by penetration. Was there any evidence whatever on the
skin, in the membranes of the respiratory channels, in the
throat, in the viscera, stomach, blood, nerves, brain&mdash;of
anything of the sort?"</p>

<p>"You know there wasn't," he answered.</p>

<p>"Quite so. Then except for the problematical lighted
corpuscle, there is absolutely no evidence of method. Therefore
we have absolutely nothing in essential number one upon which to
base a theory of murder. Let's take number
two&mdash;opportunity.</p>

<p>"We have a tarnished lady, a racketeer, a respectable
spinster, a bricklayer, an eleven-year-old schoolgirl, a banker,
an acrobat and a trapeze performer. There, I submit, is about as
incongruous a congregation as is possible. So far as we can tell,
none of them except conceivably the circus men&mdash;and Peters
and the Darnley woman&mdash;had anything in common. How could
anyone, who had opportunity to come in close enough contact to
Peters the racketeer to kill him, have equal opportunity to come
in similar close contact with Ruth Bailey, the Social Registerite
maiden lady? How could one who had found a way to make contact
with banker Marshall come equally close to acrobat Standish? And
so on&mdash;you perceive the difficulty? To administer whatever
it was that caused the deaths&mdash;if they were murder
&mdash;could have been no casual matter. It implies a certain
degree of intimacy. You agree?"</p>

<p>"Partly," he conceded.</p>

<p>"Had all lived in the same neighborhood, we might assume that
they might normally have come within range of the hypothetical
killer. But they did not&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Dr. Lowell," Ricori interrupted, "but suppose they
had some common interest which brought them within that
range."</p>

<p>"What possible common interest could so divergent a group have
had?"</p>

<p>"One common interest is very plainly indicated in these
reports and in what McCann has told us."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Ricori?"</p>

<p>"Babies," he answered. "Or at least&mdash;children."</p>

<p>Braile nodded: "I noticed that."</p>

<p>"Consider the reports," Ricori went on. "Miss Bailey is
described as charitable and devoted to children. Her charities,
presumably, took the form of helping them. Marshall, the banker,
was interested in child-welfare. The bricklayer, the acrobat and
the trapeze performer had children. Anita was a child. Peters and
the Darnley woman were, to use McCann's expression, 'daffy' over
a baby."</p>

<p>"But," I objected, "if they are murders, they are the work of
one hand. It is beyond range of possibility that all of the eight
were interested in one baby, one child, or one group of
children."</p>

<p>"Very true," said Braile. "But all could have been interested
in one especial, peculiar thing which they believed would be of
benefit to or would delight the child or children to whom each
was devoted. And that peculiar article might be obtainable in
only one place. If we could find that this is the fact, then
certainly that place would bear investigation."</p>

<p>"It is," I said, "undeniably worth looking into. Yet it seems
to me that the common-interest idea works two ways. The homes of
those who died might have had something of common interest to an
individual. The murderer, for example, might be a radio adjuster.
Or a plumber. Or a collector. An electrician, and so and so
on."</p>

<p>Braile shrugged a shoulder. Ricori did not answer; he sat deep
in thought, as though he had not heard me.</p>

<p>"Please listen, Ricori," I said. "We've gotten this far.
Method of murder &mdash;if it is murder&mdash;unknown.
Opportunity for killing&mdash;find some person whose business,
profession or what not was a matter of interest to each of the
eight, and whom they visited or who visited them; said business
being concerned, possibly, in some way with babies or older
children. Now for motive. Revenge, gain, love, hate, jealousy,
self-protection? None of these seems to fit, for again we come to
that barrier of dissimilar stations in life."</p>

<p>"How about the satisfaction of an appetite for
death&mdash;wouldn't you call that a motive?" asked Braile,
oddly. Ricori half rose from his chair, stared at him with a
curious intentness; then sank back, but I noticed he was now all
alert.</p>

<p>"I was about to discuss the possibility of a homicidal
maniac," I said, somewhat testily.</p>

<p>"That's not exactly what I mean. You remember Longfellow's
lines:</p>

<p class="poem">I shot an arrow into the air.<br> It fell to
earth I know not where.</p>

<p>"I've never acquiesced in the idea that that was an inspired
bit of verse meaning the sending of an argosy to some unknown
port and getting it back with a surprise cargo of ivory and
peacocks, apes and precious stones. There are some people who
can't stand at a window high above a busy street, or on top of a
skyscraper, without wanting to throw something down. They get a
thrill in wondering who or what will be hit. The feeling of
power. It's a bit like being God and unloosing the pestilence
upon the just and the unjust alike. Longfellow must have been one
of those people. In his heart, he wanted to shoot a real arrow
and then mull over in his imagination whether it had dropped in
somebody's eye, hit a heart, or just missed someone and skewered
a stray dog. Carry this on a little further. Give one of these
people power and opportunity to loose death at random, death
whose cause he is sure cannot be detected. He sits in his
obscurity, in safety, a god of death. With no special malice
against anyone, perhaps&mdash;impersonal, just shooting his
arrows in the air, like Longfellow's archer, for the fun of
it."</p>

<p>"And you wouldn't call such a person a homicidal maniac?" I
asked, dryly.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. Merely free of inhibitions against killing.
He might have no consciousness of wrongdoing whatever. Everybody
comes into this world under sentence of death&mdash;time and
method of execution unknown. Well, this killer might consider
himself as natural as death itself. No one who believes that
things on earth are run by an all-wise, all-powerful God thinks
of Him as a homicidal maniac. Yet He looses wars, pestilences,
misery, disease, floods, earthquakes&mdash;on believers and
unbelievers alike. If you believe things are in the hands of what
is vaguely termed Fate&mdash; would you call Fate a homicidal
maniac?"</p>

<p>"Your hypothetical archer," I said, "looses a singularly
unpleasant arrow, Braile. Also, the discussion is growing far too
metaphysical for a simple scientist like me. Ricori, I can't lay
this matter before the police. They would listen politely and
laugh heartily after I had gone. If I told all that is in my mind
to the medical authorities, they would deplore the decadence of a
hitherto honored intellect. And I would rather not call in any
private detective agency to pursue inquiries."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You have unusual resources," I answered. "I want you to sift
every movement of Peters and Hortense Darnley for the past two
months. I want you to do all that is possible in the same way
with the others-"</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>"I want you to find that one place to which, because of their
love for children, each of these unfortunates was drawn. For
though my reason tells me you and Braile have not the slightest
real evidence upon which to base your suspicions, I grudgingly
admit to you that I have a feeling you may be right."</p>

<p>"You progress, Dr. Lowell," Ricori said, formally. "I predict
that it will not be long before you will as grudgingly admit the
possibility of my witch."</p>

<p>"I am sufficiently abased," I replied, "by my present
credulity not to deny even that."</p>

<p>Ricori laughed, and busied himself copying the essential
information from the reports. Ten o'clock struck. McCann came up
to say that the car was waiting and we accompanied Ricori to the
door. The gunman had stepped out and was on the steps when a
thought came to me.</p>

<p>"Where do you begin, Ricori?"</p>

<p>"With Peters' sister."</p>

<p>"Does she know Peters is dead?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, reluctantly. "She thinks him away. He is
often away for long, and for reasons which she understands he is
not able to communicate with her directly. At such times I keep
her informed. And the reason I have not told her of Peters' death
is because she dearly loved him and would be in much
sorrow&mdash;and in a month, perhaps, there is to be another
baby."</p>

<p>"Does she know the Darnley woman is dead, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. Probably. Although McCann evidently does
not."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I don't see how you're going to keep Peters'
death from her now. But that's your business."</p>

<p>"Exactly," he answered, and followed McCann to the car.</p>

<p>Braile and I had hardly gotten back to my library when the
telephone rang. Braile answered it. I heard him curse, and saw
that the hand that held the transmitter was shaking. He said: "We
will come at once."</p>

<p>He set the transmitter down slowly, then turned to me with
twitching face.</p>

<p>"Nurse Walters has it!"</p>

<p>I felt a distinct shock. As I have written, Walters was a
perfect nurse, and besides that a thoroughly good and attractive
young person. A pure Gaelic type&mdash;blue-black hair, blue eyes
with astonishingly long lashes, milk-white skin&mdash;yes,
singularly attractive. After a moment or two of silence I
said:</p>

<p>"Well, Braile, there goes all your fine-spun reasoning. Also
your murder theory. From the Darnley woman to Peters to Walters.
No doubt now that we're dealing with some infectious
disease."</p>

<p>"Isn't there?" he asked, grimly. "I'm not prepared to admit
it. I happen to know Walters spends most of her money on a little
invalid niece who lives with her&mdash;a child of eight. Ricori's
thread of common interest moves into her case."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," I said as grimly, "I intend to see that every
precaution is taken against an infectious malady."</p>

<p>By the time we had put on our hats and coats, my car was
waiting. The hospital was only two blocks away, but I did not
wish to waste a moment. I ordered Nurse Walters removed to an
isolated ward used for observation of suspicious diseases.
Examining her, I found the same flaccidity as I had noted in the
case of Peters. But I observed that, unlike him, her eyes and
face showed little of terror. Horror there was, and a great
loathing. Nothing of panic. She gave me the same impression of
seeing both within and without. As I studied her I distinctly saw
a flash of recognition come into her eyes, and with it appeal. I
looked at Braile&mdash;he nodded; he, too, had seen it.</p>

<p>I went over her body inch by inch. It was unmarked except for
a pinkish patch upon her right instep. Closer examination made me
think this had been some superficial injury, such as a chafing,
or a light burn or scald. If so, it had completely healed; the
skin was healthy.</p>

<p>In all other ways her case paralleled that of Peters&mdash;and
the others. She had collapsed, the nurse told me, without warning
while getting dressed to go home. My inquiry was interrupted by
an exclamation from Braile. I turned to the bed and saw that
Walters' hand was slowly lifting, trembling as though its raising
was by some terrific strain of will. The index finger was half-
pointing. I followed its direction to the disclosed patch upon
the foot. And then I saw her eyes, by that same tremendous
effort, focus there.</p>

<p>The strain was too great; the hand dropped, the eyes again
were pools of horror. Yet clearly she had tried to convey to us
some message, something that had to do with that healed
wound.</p>

<p>I questioned the nurse as to whether Walters had said anything
to anyone about any injury to her foot. She replied that she had
said nothing to her, nor had any of the other nurses spoken of
it. Nurse Robbins, however, shared the apartment with Harriet and
Diana. I asked who Diana was, and she told me that was the name
of Walters' little niece. This was Robbins' night off, I found,
and gave instructions to have her get in touch with me the moment
she returned to the apartment.</p>

<p>By now Hoskins was taking his samples for the blood tests. I
asked him to concentrate upon the microscopic smears and to
notify me immediately if he discovered one of the luminous
corpuscles. Bartano, an outstanding expert upon tropical
diseases, happened to be in the hospital, as well as Somers, a
brain specialist in whom I had strong confidence. I called them
in for observation, saying nothing of the previous cases. While
they were examining Walters, Hoskins called up to say he had
isolated one of the shining corpuscles. I asked the pair to go to
Hoskins and give me their opinion upon what he had to show them.
In a little while they returned, somewhat annoyed and mystified.
Hoskins, they said, had spoken of a "leucocyte containing a
phosphorescent nucleus." They had looked at the slide but had
been unable to find it. Somers very seriously advised me to
insist upon Hoskins having his eyes examined. Bartano said
caustically that he would have been quite as surprised to have
seen such a thing as he would have been to have observed a
miniature mermaid swimming around in an artery. By these remarks,
I realized afresh the wisdom in my silence.</p>

<p>Nor did the expected changes in expression occur. The horror
and loathing persisted, and were commented upon by both Bartano
and Somers as "unusual." They agreed that the condition must be
caused by a brain lesion of some kind. They did not think there
was any evidence either of microbic infection or of drugs or
poison. Agreeing that it was a most interesting case, and asking
me to let them know its progress and outcome, they departed.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fourth hour, there was a change of
expression, but not what I had been expecting. In Walters' eyes,
on her face, was only loathing. Once I thought I saw a flicker of
the devilish anticipation flash over her face. If so, it was
quickly mastered. About the middle of the fourth hour, we saw
recognition again return to her eyes. Also, there was a
perceptible rally of the slowing heart. I sensed an intense
gathering of nervous force.</p>

<p>And then her eyelids began to rise and fall, slowly, as though
by tremendous effort, in measured time and purposefully. Four
times they raised and lowered; there was a pause; then nine times
they lifted and fell; again the pause, then they closed and
opened once. Twice she did this -</p>

<p>"She's trying to signal," whispered Braile. "But what?"</p>

<p>Again the long-lashed lids dropped and rose&mdash;four
times... pause... nine times... pause... once...</p>

<p>"She's going," whispered Braile.</p>

<p>I knelt, stethoscope at ears... slower... slower beat the
heart... and slower... and stopped.</p>

<p>"She's gone!" I said, and arose. We bent over her, waiting for
that last hideous spasm, convulsion&mdash;whatever it might
be.</p>

<p>It did not come. Stamped upon her dead face was the loathing,
and that only. Nothing of the devilish glee. Nor was there sound
from her dead lips. Beneath my hand I felt the flesh of her white
arm begin to stiffen.</p>

<p>The unknown death had destroyed Nurse Walters&mdash;there was
no doubt of that. Yet in some obscure, vague way I felt that it
had not conquered her.</p>

<p>Her body, yes. But not her will!</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE THING IN
RICORI'S CAR</h2>

<p class="first">I RETURNED home with Braile, profoundly
depressed. It is difficult to describe the effect the sequence of
events I am relating had upon my mind from beginning to
end&mdash;and beyond the end. It was as though I walked almost
constantly under the shadow of an alien world, nerves prickling
as if under surveillance of invisible things not of our life...
the subconsciousness forcing itself to the threshold of the
conscious, battering at the door between and calling out to be on
guard... every moment to be on guard. Strange phrases for an
orthodox man of medicine? Let them stand.</p>

<p>Braile was pitiably shaken. So much so that I wondered whether
there had been more than professional interest between him and
the dead girl. If there had been, he did not confide in me.</p>

<p>It was close to four o'clock when we reached my house. I
insisted that he remain with me. I called the hospital before
retiring, but they had heard nothing of Nurse Robbins. I slept a
few hours, very badly. Shortly after nine, Robbins called me on
the telephone. She was half hysterical with grief. I bade her
come to my office, and when she had done so Braile and I
questioned her.</p>

<p>"About three weeks ago," she said, "Harriet brought home to
Diana a very pretty doll. The child was enraptured. I asked
Harriet where she had gotten it, and she said in a queer little
store way downtown.</p>

<p>"'Job,' she said&mdash;my name is Jobina&mdash;'There's the
queerest woman down there. I'm sort of afraid of her, Job.'</p>

<p>"I didn't pay much attention. Besides, Harriet wasn't ever
very communicative. I had the idea she was a bit sorry she had
said what she had.</p>

<p>"Now I think of it though, Harriet acted rather funny after
that. She'd be gay and then she'd be&mdash;well, sort of
thoughtful. About ten days ago she came home with a bandage
around her foot. The right foot? Yes. She said she'd been having
tea with the woman she'd gotten Diana's doll from. The teapot
upset and the hot tea had poured down on her foot. The woman had
put some salve on it right away, and now it didn't hurt a
bit.</p>

<p>"'But I think I'll put something on it I know something
about,' she told me. Then she slipped off her stocking and began
to strip the bandage. I'd gone into the kitchen and she called to
me to come and look at her foot.</p>

<p>"'It's queer,' she said. 'That was a bad scald, Job. Yet it's
practically healed. And that salve hasn't been on more than an
hour.'</p>

<p>"I looked at her foot. There was a big red patch on the
instep. But it wasn't sore, and I told her the tea couldn't have
been very hot.</p>

<p>"'But it was really scalded, Job,' she said. 'I mean it was
blistered.'</p>

<p>"She sat looking at the bandage and at her foot for quite a
while. The salve was bluish and had a queer shine to it. I never
saw anything like it before. No, I couldn't detect any odor to
it. Harriet reached down and took the bandage and said:</p>

<p>"'Job, throw it in the fire.'</p>

<p>"I threw the bandage in the fire. I remember that it gave a
queer sort of flicker. It didn't seem to burn. It just flickered
and then it wasn't there. Harriet watched it, and turned sort of
white. Then she looked at her foot again.</p>

<p>"'Job,' she said. 'I never saw anything heal as quick as that.
She, must be a witch.'</p>

<p>"'What on earth are you talking about, Harriet?' I asked
her.</p>

<p>"'Oh, nothing,' she said. 'Only I wish I had the courage to
rip that place on my foot wide open and rub in an antidote for
snake-bite!'</p>

<p>"Then she laughed, and I thought she was fooling. But she
painted it with iodine and bandaged it with an antiseptic
besides. The next morning she woke me up and said:</p>

<p>"'Look at that foot now. Yesterday a whole pot of scalding tea
poured over it. And now it isn't even tender. And the skin ought
to be just smeared off. Job, I wish to the Lord it was!'</p>

<p>"That's all, Dr. Lowell. She didn't say any more about it and
neither did I. And she just seemed to forget all about it. Yes. I
did ask her where the shop was and who the woman was, but she
wouldn't tell me. I don't know why.</p>

<p>"And after that I never knew her so gay and carefree. Happy,
careless... Oh, I don't know why she should have died... I
don't... I don't!"</p>

<p>Braile asked:</p>

<p>"Do the numbers 491 mean anything to you, Robbins? Do you
associate them with any address Harriet knew?"</p>

<p>She thought, then shook her head. I told her of the measured
closing and opening of Walters' eyes.</p>

<p>"She was clearly attempting to convey some message in which
those numbers figured. Think again."</p>

<p>Suddenly she straightened, and began counting upon her
fingers. She nodded.</p>

<p>"Could she have been trying to spell out something? If they
were letters they would read d, i and a. They're the first three
letters of Diana's name."</p>

<p>"Well, of course that seemed the simple explanation. She might
have been trying to ask us to take care of the child." I
suggested this to Braile. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"She knew I'd do that," he said. "No, it was something
else."</p>

<p>A little after Robbins had gone, Ricori called up. I told him
of Walters' death. He was greatly moved. And after that came the
melancholy business of the autopsy. The results were precisely
the same as in that of Peters. There was nothing whatever to show
why the girl had died.</p>

<p>At about four o'clock the next day Ricori again called me on
the telephone.</p>

<p>"Will you be at home between six and nine, Dr. Lowell?" There
was suppressed eagerness in his voice.</p>

<p>"Certainly, if it is important," I answered, after consulting
my appointment book. "Have you found out anything, Ricori?"</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>"I do not know. I think perhaps&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"You mean," I did not even try to hide my own eagerness. "You
mean&mdash; the hypothetical place we discussed?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. I will know later. I go now, to where it may
be."</p>

<p>"Tell me this, Ricori&mdash;what do you expect to find?"</p>

<p>"Dolls!" he answered.</p>

<p>And as though to avoid further questions he hung up before I
could speak.</p>

<p>Dolls!</p>

<p>I sat thinking. Walters had bought a doll. And in that same
unknown place where she had bought it, she had sustained the
injury which had so worried her&mdash;or rather, whose unorthodox
behavior had so worried her. Nor was there doubt in my mind,
after hearing Robbins' story, that it was to that injury she had
attributed her seizure, and had tried to tell us so. We had not
been mistaken in our interpretation of that first desperate
effort of will I have described. She might, of course, have been
in error. The scald or, rather, the salve had had nothing
whatever to do with her condition. Yet Walters had been strongly
interested in a child. Children were the common interest of all
who had died as she had. And certainly the one great common
interest of children is dolls. What was it that Ricori had
discovered?</p>

<p>I called Braile, but could not get him. I called up Robbins
and told her to bring the doll to me immediately, which she
did.</p>

<p>The doll was a peculiarly beautiful thing. It had been cut
from wood, then covered with gesso. It was curiously life-like. A
baby doll, with an elfin little face. Its dress was exquisitely
embroidered, a folk-dress of some country I could not place. It
was, I thought, almost a museum piece, and one whose price Nurse
Walters could hardly have afforded. It bore no mark by which
either maker or seller could be identified. After I had examined
it minutely, I laid it away in a drawer. I waited impatiently to
hear from Ricori.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock there was a sustained, peremptory ringing of
the doorbell. Opening my study door, I heard McCann's voice in
the hall, and called to him to come up. At first glance I knew
something was very wrong. His tight-mouthed tanned face was a
sallow yellow, his eyes held a dazed look. He spoke from stiff
lips:</p>

<p>"Come down to the car. I think the boss is dead."</p>

<p>"Dead!" I exclaimed, and was down the stairs and out beside
the car in a breath. The chauffeur was standing beside the door.
He opened it, and I saw Ricori huddled in a corner of the rear
seat. I could feel no pulse, and when I raised the lids of his
eyes they stared at me sightlessly. Yet he was not cold.</p>

<p>"Bring him in," I ordered.</p>

<p>McCann and the chauffeur carried him into the house and placed
him on the examination table in my office. I bared his breast and
applied the stethoscope. I could detect no sign of the heart
functioning. Nor was there, apparently, any respiration. I made a
few other rapid tests. To all appearances, Ricori was quite dead.
And yet I was not satisfied. I did the things customary in
doubtful cases, but without result.</p>

<p>McCann and the chauffeur had been standing close beside me.
They read my verdict in my face. I saw a strange glance pass
between them; and obviously each of them had a touch of panic,
the chauffeur more markedly than McCann. The latter asked in a
level, monotonous voice:</p>

<p>"Could it have been poison?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it could-" I stopped.</p>

<p>Poison! And that mysterious errand about which he had
telephoned me! And the possibility of poison in the other cases!
But this death&mdash;and again I felt the doubt&mdash;had not
been like those others.</p>

<p>"McCann," I said, "when and where did you first notice
anything wrong?"</p>

<p>He answered, still in that monotonous voice:</p>

<p>"About six blocks down the street. The boss was sitting close
to me. All at once he says 'Jesu!' Like he's scared. He shoves
his hands up to his chest. He gives a kind of groan an' stiffens
out. I says to him: 'What's the matter, boss, you got a pain?' He
don't answer me, an' then he sort of falls against me an' I see
his eyes is wide open. He looks dead to me. So I yelps to Paul to
stop the car and we both look him over. Then we beat it here like
hell."</p>

<p>I went to a cabinet and poured them stiff drinks of brandy.
They needed it. I threw a sheet over Ricori.</p>

<p>"Sit down," I said, "and you, McCann, tell me exactly what
occurred from the time you started out with Mr. Ricori to
wherever it was he went. Don't skip a single detail."</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>"About two o'clock the boss goes to Mollie's&mdash;that's
Peters' sister &mdash;stays an hour, comes out, goes home and
tells Paul to be back at four-thirty. But he's doing a lot of
'phoning so we don't start till five. He tells Paul where he
wants to go, a place over in a little street down off Battery
Park. He says to Paul not to go through the street, just park the
car over by the Battery. And he says to me, 'McCann, I'm going in
this place myself. I don't want 'em to know I ain't by myself.'
He says, 'I got reasons. You hang around an' look in now an'
then, but don't come in unless I call you.' I says, 'Boss, do you
think it's wise?' An' he says, 'I know what I'm doing an' you do
what I tell you.' So there ain't any argument to that.</p>

<p>"We get down to this place an' Paul does like he's told, an'
the boss walks up the street an' he stops at a little joint
that's got a lot of dolls in the window. I looks in the place as
I go past. There ain't much light but I see a lot of other dolls
inside an' a thin gal at a counter. She looks white as a fish's
belly to me, an' after the boss has stood at the window a minute
or two he goes in, an' I go by slow to look at the gal again
because she sure looks whiter than I ever saw a gal look who's on
her two feet. The boss is talkin' to the gal who's showing him
some dolls. The next time I go by there's a woman in the place.
She's so big, I stand at the window a minute to look at her
because I never seen anybody that looks like her. She's got a
brown face an' it looks sort of like a horse, an' a little
mustache an' moles, an' she's as funny a looking broad as the
fish-white gal. Big an' fat. But I get a peep at her
eyes&mdash;Geeze, what eyes! Big an' black an' bright, an'
somehow I don't like them any more than the rest of her. The next
time I go by, the boss is over in a corner with the big dame.
He's got a wad of bills in his hand and I see the gal watching
sort of frightened like. The next time I do my beat, I don't see
either the boss or the woman.</p>

<p>"So I stand looking through the window because I don't like
the boss out of my sight in this joint. An' the next thing I see
is the boss coming out of a door at the back of the shop. He's
madder than hell an' carrying something an' the woman is behind
him an' her eyes spitting fire. The boss is jabbering but I can't
hear what he's saying, an' the dame is jabbering too an' making
funny passes at him. Funny passes? Why, funny motions with her
hands. But the boss heads for the door an' when he gets to it I
see him stick what he's carrying inside his overcoat an' button
it up round it.</p>

<p>"It's a doll. I see its legs dangling down before he gets it
under his coat. A big one, too, for it makes quite a bulge-"</p>

<p>He paused, began mechanically to roll a cigarette, than
glanced at the covered body and threw the cigarette away. He went
on:</p>

<p>"I never see the boss so mad before. He's muttering to himself
in Italian an' saying something over an' over that sounds like
'strayga.' I see it ain't no time to talk so I just walk along
with him. Once he says to me, more as if he's talking to himself
than me, if you get what I mean&mdash;he says, 'The Bible says
you shall not suffer a witch to live.' Then he goes on muttering
an' holding one arm fast over this doll inside his coat.</p>

<p>"We get to the car an' he tells Paul to beat it straight to
you an' to hell with traffic&mdash;that's right, ain't it, Paul?
Yes. When we get in the car he stops muttering an' just sits
there quiet, not saying anything to me until I hear him say
Jesu!' like I told you. And that's all, ain't it, Paul?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur did not answer. He sat staring at McCann with
something of entreaty in his gaze. I distinctly saw McCann shake
his head. The chauffeur said, in a strongly marked Italian
accent, hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"I do not see the shop, but everything else McCann say is
truth."</p>

<p>I got up and walked over to Ricori's body. I was about to lift
the sheet when something caught my eye. A red spot about as big
as a dime&mdash;a blood stain. Holding it in place with one
finger, I carefully lifted the edge of the sheet. The blood spot
was directly over Ricori's heart.</p>

<p>I took one of my strongest glasses and one of my finest
probes. Under the glass, I could see on Ricori's breast a minute
puncture, no larger than that made by a hypodermic needle.
Carefully I inserted the probe. It slipped easily in and in until
it touched the wall of the heart. I went no further.</p>

<p>Some needle-pointed, exceedingly fine instrument had been
thrust through Ricori's breast straight into his heart!</p>

<p>I looked at him, doubtfully; there was no reason why such a
minute puncture should cause death. Unless, of course, the weapon
which had made it had been poisoned; or there had been some other
violent shock which had contributed to that of the wound itself.
But such shock or shocks might very well bring about in a person
of Ricori's peculiar temperament some curious mental condition,
producing an almost perfect counterfeit of death. I had heard of
such cases.</p>

<p>No, despite my tests, I was not sure Ricori was dead. But I
did not tell McCann that. Alive or dead, there was one sinister
fact that McCann must explain. I turned to the pair, who had been
watching me closely.</p>

<p>"You say there were only the three of you in the car?"</p>

<p>Again I saw a glance pass between them.</p>

<p>"There was the doll," McCann answered, half-defiantly. I
brushed the answer aside, impatiently.</p>

<p>"I repeat: there were only the three of you in the car?"</p>

<p>"Three men, yes."</p>

<p>"Then," I said grimly, "you two have a lot to explain. Ricori
was stabbed. I'll have to call the police."</p>

<p>McCann arose and walked over to the body. He picked up the
glass and peered through it at the tiny puncture. He looked at
the chauffeur. He said:</p>

<p>"I told you the doll done it, Paul!"</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE THING IN
RICORI'S CAR (CONTINUED)</h2>

<p class="first">I SAID, incredulously, "McCann, you surely don't
expect me to believe that?"</p>

<p>He did not answer, rolling another cigarette which this time
he did not throw away. The chauffeur staggered over to Ricori's
body; he threw himself on his knees and began mingled prayers and
implorations. McCann, curiously enough, was now completely
himself. It was as though the removal of uncertainty as to the
cause of Ricori's death had restored all his old cold confidence.
He lighted the cigarette; he said, almost cheerfully:</p>

<p>"I'm aiming to make you believe."</p>

<p>I walked over to the telephone. McCann jumped in front of me
and stood with his back against the instrument.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Doc. If I'm the kind of a rat that'll stick a
knife in the heart of the man who hired me to protect
him&mdash;ain't it occurred to you the spot you're on ain't so
healthy? What's to keep me an' Paul from giving you the works an'
making our getaway?"</p>

<p>Frankly, that had not occurred to me. Now I realized in what a
truly dangerous position I was placed. I looked at the chauffeur.
He had risen from his knees and was standing, regarding McCann
intently.</p>

<p>"I see you get it." McCann smiled, mirthlessly. He walked to
the Italian. "Pass your rods, Paul."</p>

<p>Without a word the chauffeur dipped into his pockets and
handed him a pair of automatics. McCann laid them on my table. He
reached under his left arm and placed another pistol beside them;
reached into his pocket and added a second.</p>

<p>"Sit there, Doc," he said, and indicated my chair at the
table. "That's all our artillery. Keep the guns right under your
hands. If we make any breaks, shoot. All I ask is you don't do
any calling up till you've listened."</p>

<p>I sat down, drawing the automatics to me, examining them to
see that they were loaded. They were.</p>

<p>"Doc," McCann said, "there's three things I want you to
consider. First, if I'd had anything to do with smearing the
boss, would I be giving you a break like this? Second, I was
sitting at his right side. He had on a thick overcoat. How could
I reach over an' run anything as thin as whatever killed him must
have been all through his coat, an' through the doll, through his
clothes, an' through him without him putting up some kind of a
fight. Hell, Ricori was a strong man. Paul would have seen us-
"</p>

<p>"What difference would that have made," I interrupted, "if
Paul were an accomplice?"</p>

<p>"Right," he acquiesced, "that's so. Paul's as deep in the mud
as I am. Ain't that so, Paul?" He looked sharply at the
chauffeur, who nodded. "All right, we'll leave that with a
question mark after it. Take the third point &mdash;if I'd killed
the boss that way, an' Paul was in it with me, would we have took
him to the one man who'd be expected to know how he was killed?
An' then when you'd found out as expected, hand you an alibi like
this? Christ, Doc, I ain't loco enough for that!"</p>

<p>His face twitched.</p>

<p>"Why would I want to kill him? I'd a-gone through hell an'
back for him an' he knew it. So would've Paul."</p>

<p>I felt the force of all this. Deep within me I was conscious
of a stubborn conviction that McCann was telling the
truth&mdash;or at least the truth as he saw it. He had not
stabbed Ricori. Yet to attribute the act, to a doll was too
fantastic. And there had been only the three men in the car.
McCann had been reading my thoughts with an uncanny
precision.</p>

<p>"It might've been one of them mechanical dolls," he said.
"Geared up to stick."</p>

<p>"McCann, go down and bring it up to me," I said
sharply&mdash;he had voiced a rational explanation.</p>

<p>"It ain't there," he said, and grinned at me again
mirthlessly. "It out!"</p>

<p>"Preposterous-" I began. The chauffeur broke in:</p>

<p>"It's true. Something out. When I open the door. I think it
cat, dog, maybe. I say, 'What the hell-' Then I see it. It run
like hell. It stoop. It duck in shadow. I see it just as flash
an' then no more. I say to McCann &mdash;'What the hell!' McCann,
he's feeling around bottom of car. He say &mdash;'It's the doll.
It done for the boss!' I say: 'Doll! What you mean doll?' He tell
me. I know nothing of any doll before. I see the boss carry
something in his coat, si. But I don't know what. But I see one
goddam thing that don't look like cat, dog. It jump out of car,
through my legs, si!"</p>

<p>I said ironically: "Is it your idea, McCann, that this
mechanical doll was geared to run away as well as to stab?"</p>

<p>He flushed, but answered quietly:</p>

<p>"I ain't saying it was a mechanical doll. But anything else
would be &mdash;well, pretty crazy, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"McCann," I asked abruptly, "what do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Doc, when I was down Arizona way, there was a ranchero died.
Died sudden. There was a feller looked as if he had a lot to do
with it. The marshal said: 'Hombre, I don't think you done
it&mdash;but I'm the lone one on the jury. What say?' The hombre
say, 'Marshal, give me two weeks, an' if I don't bring in the
feller that done it, you hang me.' The marshal says, 'Fair
enough. The temporary verdict is deceased died by shock.' It was
shock all right. Bullet shock. All right, before the two weeks
was up, along comes this feller with the murderer hog-tied to his
saddle."</p>

<p>"I get your point, McCann. But this isn't Arizona."</p>

<p>"I know it ain't. But couldn't you certify it was heart
disease? Temporarily? An' give me a week? Then if I don't come
through, shoot the works. I won't run away. It's this way, Doc.
If you tell the bulls, you might just as well pick up one of them
guns an' shoot me an' Paul dead right now. If we tell the bulls
about the doll, they'll laugh themselves sick an' fry us at Sing
Sing. If we don't, we fry anyway. If by a miracle the bulls drop
us &mdash;there's them in the boss's crowd that'll soon remedy
that. I'm telling you, Doc, you'll be killing two innocent men.
An' worse, you'll never find out who did kill the boss, because
they'll never look any further than us. Why should they?"</p>

<p>A cloud of suspicion gathered around my conviction of the
pair's innocence. The proposal, naive as it seemed, was subtle.
If I assented, the gunman and the chauffeur would have a whole
week to get away, if that was the plan. If McCann did not come
back, and I told the truth of the matter, I would be an accessory
after the fact&mdash;in effect, co-murderer. If I pretended that
my suspicions had only just been aroused, I stood, at the best,
convicted of ignorance. If they were captured, and recited the
agreement, again I could be charged as an accessory. It occurred
to me that McCann's surrender of the pistols was extraordinarily
clever. I could not say that my assent had been constrained by
threats. Also, it might have been only a cunningly conceived
gesture to enlist my confidence, weaken my resistance to his
appeal. How did I know that the pair did not have still other
weapons, ready to use if I refused?</p>

<p>Striving to find a way out of the trap, I walked over to
Ricori. I took the precaution of dropping the automatics into my
pockets as I went. I bent over Ricori. His flesh was cold, but
not with the peculiar chill of death. I examined him once more,
minutely. And now I could detect the faintest of pulsation in the
heart a bubble began to form at the corner of his lips
&mdash;Ricori lived!</p>

<p>I continued to bend over him, thinking faster than ever I had
before. Ricori lived, yes. But it did not lift my peril. Rather
it increased it. For if McCann had stabbed him, if the pair had
been in collusion, and learned that they had been unsuccessful,
would they not finish what they had thought ended? With Ricori
alive, Ricori able to speak and to accuse them&mdash;a death more
certain than the processes of law confronted them. Death at
Ricori's command at the hands of his henchmen. And in finishing
Ricori they would at the same time be compelled to kill me.</p>

<p>Still bending, I slipped a hand into my pocket, clenched an
automatic, and then whirled upon them with the gun leveled.</p>

<p>"Hands up! Both of you!" I said.</p>

<p>Amazement flashed over McCann's face, consternation over the
chauffeur's. But their hands went up.</p>

<p>I said, "There's no need of that clever little agreement,
McCann. Ricori is not dead. When he's able to talk he'll tell
what happened to him."</p>

<p>I was not prepared for the effect of this announcement. If
McCann was not sincere, he was an extraordinary actor. His lanky
body stiffened, I had seldom seen such glad relief as was stamped
upon his face. Tears rolled down his tanned cheeks. The chauffeur
dropped to his knees, sobbing and praying. My suspicions were
swept away. I did not believe this could be acting. In some
measure I was ashamed of myself.</p>

<p>"You can drop your hands, McCann," I said, and slipped the
automatic back in my pocket.</p>

<p>He said, hoarsely: "Will he live?"</p>

<p>I answered: "I think he has every chance. If there's no
infection, I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" whispered McCann, and over and over, "Thank
God!"</p>

<p>And just then Braile entered, and stood staring in amazement
at us.</p>

<p>"Ricori has been stabbed. I'll explain the whole matter
later," I told him. "Small puncture over the heart and probably
penetrating it. He's suffering mainly from shock. He's coming out
of it. Get him up to the Annex and take care of him until I
come."</p>

<p>Briefly I reviewed what I had done and suggested the immediate
further treatment. And when Ricori had been removed, I turned to
the gunmen.</p>

<p>"McCann," I said, "I'm not going to explain. Not now. But here
are your pistols, and Paul's. I'm giving you your chance."</p>

<p>He took the automatics, looking at me with a curious gleam in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I ain't saying I wouldn't like to know what touched you off,
Doc," he said. "But whatever you do is all right by me&mdash;if
only you can bring the boss around."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly there are some who will have to be notified of
his condition," I replied. "I'll leave that all to you. All I
know is that he was on his way to me. He had a heart attack in
the car. You brought him to me. I am now treating him&mdash;for
heart attack. If he should die, McCann &mdash;well, that will be
another matter."</p>

<p>"I'll do the notifying," he answered. "There's only a couple
that you'll have to see. Then I'm going down to that doll joint
an' get the truth outa that hag."</p>

<p>His eyes were slits, his mouth a slit, too.</p>

<p>"No," I said, firmly. "Not yet. Put a watch on the place. If
the woman goes out, discover where she goes. Watch the girl as
closely. If it appears as though either of them or both of them
are moving away&mdash;running off &mdash;let them. But follow
them. I don't want them molested or even alarmed until Ricori can
tell what happened there."</p>

<p>"All right," he said, but reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Your doll story," I reminded him, sardonically, "would not be
so convincing to the police as to my somewhat credulous mind.
Take no chance of them being injected into the matter. As long as
Ricori is alive, there is no need of them being so injected."</p>

<p>I took him aside.</p>

<p>"Can you trust the chauffeur to do no talking?"</p>

<p>"Paul's all right," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, for both your sakes, he would better be," I warned.</p>

<p>They took their departure. I went up to Ricori's room. His
heart was stronger, his respiration weak but encouraging. His
temperature, although still dangerously subnormal, had improved.
If, as I had told McCann, there was no infection, and if there
had been no poison nor drug upon the weapon with which he had
been stabbed, Ricori should live.</p>

<p>Later that night two thoroughly polite gentlemen called upon
me, heard my explanation of Ricori's condition, asked if they
might see him, did see him, and departed. They assured me that
"win or lose" I need have no fear about my fees, nor have any
hesitancy in bringing in the most expensive consultants. In
exchange, I assured them that I believed Ricori had an excellent
chance to recover. They asked me to allow no one to see him
except themselves, and McCann. They thought it might save me
trouble to have a couple of men whom they would send to me, to
sit at the door of the room&mdash;outside, of course, in the
hall. I answered that I would be delighted.</p>

<p>In an exceedingly short time two quietly watchful men were on
guard at Ricori's door, just as they had been over Peters'.</p>

<p>In my dreams that night dolls danced around me, pursued me,
threatened me. My sleep was not pleasant.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; STRANGE EXPERIENCE
OF OFFICER SHEVLIN</h2>

<p class="first">MORNING brought a marked improvement in Ricori's
condition. The deep coma was unchanged, but his temperature was
nearly normal; respiration and heart action quite satisfactory.
Braile and I divided duties so that one of us could be constantly
within call of the nurses. The guards were relieved after
breakfast by two others. One of my quiet visitors of the night
before made his appearance, looked at Ricori and received with
unfeigned gratification my reassuring reports.</p>

<p>After I had gone to bed the obvious idea had occurred to me
that Ricori might have made some memorandum concerning his quest;
I had felt reluctance about going through his pockets, however.
Now seemed to be the opportunity to ascertain whether he had or
had not. I suggested to my visitor that he might wish to examine
any papers Ricori had been carrying, adding that we had been
interested together in a certain matter, that he had been on his
way to discuss this with me when he had undergone his seizure;
and that he might have carried some notes of interest to me. My
visitor agreed; I sent for Ricori's overcoat and suit and we went
through them. There were a few papers, but nothing relating to
our investigation.</p>

<p>In the breast pocket of his overcoat, however, was a curious
object &mdash;a piece of thin cord about eight inches long in
which had been tied nine knots, spaced at irregular intervals.
They were curious knots too, not quite like any I could recollect
having observed. I studied the cord with an unaccountable but
distinct feeling of uneasiness. I glanced at my visitor and saw a
puzzled look in his eyes. And then I remembered Ricori's
superstition, and reflected that the knotted cord was probably a
talisman or charm of some sort. I put it back in the pocket.</p>

<p>When again alone, I took it out and examined it more minutely.
The cord was of human hair, tightly braided&mdash;the hair a
peculiarly pale ash and unquestionably a woman's. Each knot, I
now saw, was tied differently. Their structure was complex. The
difference between them, and their irregular spacing, gave a
vague impression of forming a word or sentence. And, studying the
knots, I had the same sensation of standing before a blank door,
vitally important for me to open, that I had felt while watching
Peters die. Obeying some obscure impulse, I did not return the
cord to the pocket but threw it into the drawer with the doll
which Nurse Robbins had brought me.</p>

<p>Shortly after three, McCann telephoned me. I was more than
glad to hear from him. In the broad light of day his story of the
occurrence in Ricori's car had become incredibly fantastic, all
my doubts returning.</p>

<p>I had even begun again to review my unenviable position if he
disappeared. Some of this must have shown in the cordiality of my
greeting, for he laughed.</p>

<p>"Thought I'd rode off the range, did you, Doc? You couldn't
drive me away. Wait till you see what I got."</p>

<p>I awaited his arrival with impatience. When he appeared he had
with him a sturdy, red-faced man who carried a large paper
clothing-bag. I recognized him as a policeman I had encountered
now and then on the Drive, although I had never before seen him
out of uniform. I bade the two be seated, and the officer sat on
the edge of a chair, holding the clothes-bag gingerly across his
knees. I looked at McCann inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Shevlin," he waved his hand at the officer, "said he knew
you, Doc. But I'd have brought him along, anyway."</p>

<p>"If I didn't know Dr. Lowell, it's not me that'd be here,
McCann me lad," said Shevlin, glumly. "But it's brains the Doc
has got in his head, an' not a cold boiled potato like that
damned lootenant."</p>

<p>"Well," said McCann, maliciously, "the Doc'll prescribe for
you anyway, Tim."</p>

<p>"'Tis no prescribin' I want, I tell you," Shevlin bellowed, "I
seen it wit' me own eyes, I'm tellin' you! An' if Dr. Lowell
tells me I was drunk or crazy I'll tell him t'hell wit' him, like
I told the lootenant. An' I'm tellin' you, too, McCann."</p>

<p>I listened to this with growing amazement.</p>

<p>"Now, Tim, now, Tim," soothed McCann, "I believe you. You
don't know how much I want to believe you&mdash;or why,
either."</p>

<p>He gave me a quick glance, and I gathered that whatever the
reason he had brought the policeman to see me, he had not spoken
to him of Ricori.</p>

<p>"You see, Doc, when I told you about that doll getting up an'
jumping out of the car you thought I was loco. All right, I says
to me, maybe it didn't get far. Maybe it was one of them improved
mechanical dolls, but even if it was it has to run down sometime.
So I goes hunting for somebody else that might have seen it. An'
this morning I runs into Shevlin here. An' he tells me. Go on,
Tim, give the Doc what you gave me."</p>

<p>Shevlin blinked, shifted the bag cautiously and began. He had
the dogged air of repeating a story that he had told over and
over. And to unsympathetic audiences; for as he went on he would
look at me defiantly, or raise his voice belligerently.</p>

<p>"It was one o'clock this mornin'. I am on me beat when I hear
somebody yellin' desperate like. 'Help!' he yells. 'Murder! Take
it away!' he yells. I go runnin', an' there standin' on a bench
is a guy in his soup-an'-nuts an' high hat jammed over his ears,
an' a-hittin' this way an' that wit' his cane, an' a-dancin' up
an' down an' it's him that's doin' the yellin'.</p>

<p>"I reach over an' tap him on the shins wit' me night-club, an'
he looks down an' then flops right in me arms. I get a whiff of
his breath an' I think I see what's the matter wit' him all
right. I get him on his feet, an' I says: 'Come on now, the
pink'll soon run off the elephants,' I says. It's this
Prohibition hooch that makes it look so thick,' I says. 'Tell me
where you live an' I'll put you in a taxi, or do you want t'go to
a hospital?' I says.</p>

<p>"He stands there a-holdin' unto me an' a-shakin', an' he says:
'D'ye think I'm drunk?' An' I begins t'tell him. 'An' how-' when
I looks at him, an' he ain't drunk. He might've been drunk, but
he ain't drunk now. An' all t'once he flops down on the bench an'
pulls up his pants an' down his socks, an' I sees blood runnin'
from a dozen little holes, an' he says, 'Maybe you'll be tellin'
me it's pink elephants done that?'</p>

<p>"I looks at 'em an' feels 'em, an' it's blood all right, as if
somebody's been jabbin' a hat-pin in him-"</p>

<p>Involuntarily I stared at McCann. He did not meet my eyes.
Imperturbably he was rolling a cigarette.</p>

<p>"An' I says: 'What the hell done it?' An' he says 'The doll
done it!'"</p>

<p>A little shiver ran down my back, and I looked again at the
gunman. This time he gave me a warning glance. Shevlin glared up
at me.</p>

<p>"'The doll done it!' he tells me," Shevlin shouted. "He tells
me the doll done it!"</p>

<p>McCann chuckled and Shevlin turned his glare from me to him. I
said hastily:</p>

<p>"I understand, Officer. He told you it was the doll made the
wounds. An astonishing assertion, certainly."</p>

<p>"Y'don't believe it, y'mean?" demanded Shevlin, furiously.</p>

<p>"I believe he told you that, yes," I answered. "But go
on."</p>

<p>"All right, would y'be sayin' I was drunk too, t'believe it?
Fer it's what that potato-brained lootenant did."</p>

<p>"No, no," I assured him hastily. Shevlin settled back, and
went on:</p>

<p>"I asks the drunk, 'What's her name?' 'What's whose name?'
says he. 'The doll's,' I says. 'I'll bet you she was a blonde
doll,' I says, 'an' wants her picture in the tabloids. The
brunettes don't use hatpins,' I says. 'They're all fer the
knife.'</p>

<p>"'Officer,' he says, solemn, 'it was a doll. A little man
doll. An' when I say doll I mean a doll. I was walkin along,' he
says, 'gettin' the air. I won't deny I'd had some drinks,' he
says, 'but nothin' I couldn't carry. I'm swishin' along wit' me
cane, when I drops it by that bush there,' he says, pointin'. 'I
reach down to pick it up,' he says, 'an' there I see a doll. It's
a big doll an' it's all huddled up crouchin', as if somebody
dropped it that way. I reaches over t' pick it up. As I touch it,
the doll jumps as if I hit a spring. It jumps right over me
head,' he says. 'I'm surprised,' he says, 'an' considerably
startled, an' I'm crouchin' there lookin' where the doll was when
I feel a hell of a pain in the calf of me leg,' he says, 'like I
been stabbed. I jump up, an' there's this doll wit' a big pin in
its hand just ready t' jab me again.'</p>

<p>"'Maybe,' says I to the drunk, 'maybe 'twas a midget you
seen?' 'Midget hell!' says he, 'it was a doll! An' it was jabbin'
me wit' a hat-pin. It was about two feet high,' he says, 'wit'
blue eyes. It was grinnin' at me in a way that made me blood run
cold. An' while I stood there paralyzed, it jabbed me again. I
jumped on the bench,' he says, 'an' it danced around an' around,
an' it jumped up an' jabbed me. An' it jumped down an' up again
an' jabbed me. I thought it meant to kill me, an' I yelled like
hell,' says the drunk. 'An' who wouldn't?' he asks me. 'An' then
you come,' he says, 'an' the doll ducked into the bushes there.
Fer God's sake, officer, come wit' me till I can get a taxi an'
go home,' he says, 'fer I make no bones tellin' you I'm scared
right down to me gizzard!' says he.</p>

<p>"So I take the drunk by the arm," went on Shevlin, "thinkin',
poor lad, what this bootleg booze'll make you see, but still
puzzled about how he got them holes in his legs. We come out to
the Drive. The drunk is still a-shakin' an' I'm a-waitin' to hail
a taxi, when all of a sudden he lets out a squeal. 'There it
goes! Look, there it goes!'</p>

<p>"I follow his finger, an' sure enough I see somethin'
scuttlin' over the sidewalk an' out on the Drive. The light's
none too good, an' I think it's a cat or maybe a dog. Then I see
there's a little coupe drawn up opposite at the curb. The cat or
dog, whatever it is, seems to be makin' fer it. The drunk's still
yellin' an' I'm tryin' to see what it is, when down the Drive
hell-fer-leather comes a big car. It hits this thing kersmack an'
never stops. He's out of sight before I can raise me whistle. I
think I see the thing wriggle an' I think, still thinkin' it's a
cat or dog, 'I'll put you out of your misery,' an' I run over to
it wit' me gun. As I do so the coupe that's been waitin' shoots
off hell-fer-leather too. I get over to what the other car hit,
an' I look at it&mdash; "</p>

<p>He slipped the bag off his knees, set it down beside him and
untied the top.</p>

<p>"An' this is what it was."</p>

<p>Out of the bag he drew a doll, or what remained of it. The
automobile had gone across its middle, crushing it. One leg was
missing; the other hung by a thread. Its clothing was torn and
begrimed with the dirt of the roadway. It was a doll&mdash;but
uncannily did it give the impression of a mutilated pygmy. Its
neck hung limply over its breast.</p>

<p>McCann stepped over and lifted the doll's head, I stared, and
stared... with a prickling of the scalp... with a slowing of the
heart-beat...</p>

<p>For the face that looked up at me, blue eyes glaring, was the
face of Peters!</p>

<p>And on it, like the thinnest of veils, was the shadow of that
demonic exultance I had watched spread over the face of Peters
after death had stilled the pulse of his heart!</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE PETERS
DOLL</h2>

<p class="first">SHEVLIN watched me as I stared at the doll. He
was satisfied by its effect upon me.</p>

<p>"A hell of a lookin' thing, ain't it?" he asked. "The doctor
sees it, McCann. I told you he had brains!" He jounced the doll
down upon his knee, and sat there like a red-faced ventriloquist
with a peculiarly malevolent dummy&mdash;certainly it would not
have surprised me to have heard the diabolic laughter issue from
its faintly grinning mouth.</p>

<p>"Now, I'll tell you, Dr. Lowell," Shevlin went on. "I stands
there lookin' at this doll, an' I picks it up. 'There's more in
this than meets the eye, Tim Shevlin,' I says to myself. An' I
looks to see what's become of the drunk. He's standin' where I
left him, an' I walk over to him an' he says: 'Was it a doll like
I told you? Hah! I told you it was a doll! Hah! That's him!' he
says, gettin' a peek at what I'm carryin'. So I says to him,
'Young fellow, me lad, there's somethin' wrong here. You're goin'
to the station wit' me an' tell the lootenant what you told me
an' show him your legs an' all,' I says. An' the drunk says,
'Fair enough, but keep that thing on the other side of me.' So we
go to the station.</p>

<p>"The lootenant's there an' the sergeant an' a coupla flatties.
I marches up an' sticks the doll on the top of the desk in front
of the lootenant.</p>

<p>"'What's this?' he says, grinnin'. 'Another kidnapin'?'</p>

<p>"Show him your legs," I tells the drunk. 'Not unless they're
better than the Follies,' grins this potato-brained ape. But the
drunk's rolled up his pants an' down his socks an' shows 'em.</p>

<p>"'What t'hell done that?' says the lootenant, standin' up.</p>

<p>"'The doll,' says the drunk. The lootenant looks at him, and
sits back blinkin'. An' I tells him about answerin' the drunk's
yells, an' what he tells me, an' what I see. The sergeant laughs
an' the flatties laugh but the lootenant gets red in the face an'
says, 'Are you tryin' to kid me, Shevlin?' An' I says, 'I'm
tellin' you what he tells me an' what I seen, an' there's the
doll.' An' he says, 'This bootleg is fierce but I never knew it
was catchin'.' An' he crooks his finger at me an' says, 'Come up
here, I want t' smell your breath.' An' then I knows it's all up,
because t' tell the truth the drunk had a flask an' I'd took one
wit' him. Only one an' the only one I'd had. But there it was on
me breath. An' the lootenant says, 'I thought so. Get down."</p>

<p>"An' then he starts bellerin' an' hollerin' at the drunk, 'You
wit' your soup-an'-nuts an' your silk hat, you ought to be a
credit to your city an' what t' hell you think you can do,
corrupt a good officer an' kid me? You done the first but you
ain't doin' the second,' he yelps. 'Put him in the cooler,' he
yelps. 'An' throw his damned doll in wit' him t' keep him
company!' An' at that the drunk lets out a screech an' drops t'
the floor. He' out good an' plenty. An' the lootenant says, 'The
poor damned fool by God he believes his own lie! Bring him around
an' let him go.' An' he says t' me, 'If you weren't such a good
man, Tim, I'd have you up for this. Take your degen'ret doll an'
go home,' he says, 'I'll send a relief t' your beat. An' take t-
morrow off an' sober up,' says he. An' I says t' him, 'All right,
but I seen what I seen. An' t' hell wit' you all," I says t' the
flatties. An' everybody's laughin' fit t' split. An' I says t'
the lootenant, 'If you break me for it or not, t' hell wit' you
too.' But they keep on laughin', so I take the doll an' walk
out."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"I take the doll home," he resumed. "I tell it all t' Maggie,
me wife. An' what does she tell me? 'T' think you've been off the
hard stuff or near off so long,' she says, 'an' now look at you!'
she says, 'wit' this talk of stabbin' dolls, an' insultin' the
lootenant, an' maybe gettin' sent t' Staten Island,' she says.
'An' Jenny just gettin' in high school! Go t' bed,' she says,
'an' sleep it off, an' throw the doll in the garbage,' she says.
But by now I am gettin' good an' mad, an' I do not throw it in
the garbage but I take it with me. An' a while ago I meet McCann,
an' somehow he knows somethin', I tell him an' he brings me here.
An' just fer what, I don't know."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to speak to the lieutenant?" I asked.</p>

<p>"What could you say?" he replied, reasonably enough. "If you
tell him the drunk was right, an' that I'm right an' I did see
the doll run, what'll he think? He'll think you're as crazy as I
must be. An' if you explain maybe I was a little off me nut just
for the minute, it's to the hospital they'll be sendin' me. No,
Doctor. I'm much obliged, but all I can do is say nothin' more
an' be dignified an' maybe hand out a shiner or two if they get
too rough. It's grateful I am fer the kindly way you've listened.
It makes me feel better."</p>

<p>Shevlin got to his feet, sighing heavily.</p>

<p>"An' what do you think? I mean about what the drunk said he
seen, an' what I seen?" he asked somewhat nervously.</p>

<p>"I cannot speak for the inebriate," I answered cautiously. "As
for yourself&mdash;well, it might be that the doll had been lying
out there in the street, and that a cat or dog ran across just as
the automobile went by. Dog or cat escaped, but the action
directed your attention to the doll and you thought-"</p>

<p>He interrupted me with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"All right. All right. 'Tis enough. I'll just leave the doll
wit' you to pay for the diagnosis, sir."</p>

<p>With considerable dignity and perceptibly heightened color
Shevlin stalked from the room. McCann was shaking with silent
laughter. I picked up the doll and laid it on my table. I looked
at the subtly malignant little face and I did not feel much like
laughing.</p>

<p>For some obscure reason I took the Walters doll out of the
drawer and placed it beside the other, took out the strangely
knotted cord and set it between them. McCann was standing at my
side, watching. I heard him give a low whistle.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that, Doc?" he pointed to the cord. I told
him. He whistled again.</p>

<p>"The boss never knew he had it, that's sure," he said. "Wonder
who slipped it over on him? The hag, of course. But how?"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, the witch's ladder," he pointed again to the cord.
"That's what they call it down Mexico way. It's bad medicine. The
witch slips it to you and then she has power over you." He bent
over the cord... "Yep, it's the witch's ladder&mdash;the nine
knots an' woman's hair... an' in the boss's pocket!"</p>

<p>He stood staring at the cord. I noticed he made no attempt to
pick it up.</p>

<p>"Take it up and look at it closer, McCann," I said.</p>

<p>"Not me!" He stepped back. "I'm telling you it's bad medicine,
Doc."</p>

<p>I had been steadily growing more and more irritated against
the fog of superstition gathering ever heavier around me, and now
I lost my patience.</p>

<p>"See here, McCann," I said, hotly, "are you, to use Shevlin's
expression, trying to kid me? Every time I see you I am brought
face to face with some fresh outrage against credibility. First
it is your doll in the car. Then Shevlin. And now your witch's
ladder. What's your idea?"</p>

<p>He looked at me with narrowed eyes, a faint flush reddening
the high check-bones.</p>

<p>"The only idea I got," he drawled more slowly than usual, "is
to see the boss on his feet. An' to get whoever got him. As for
Shevlin&mdash;you don't think he was faking, do you?"</p>

<p>"I do not," I answered. "But I am reminded that you were
beside Ricori in the car when he was stabbed. And I cannot help
wondering how it was that you discovered Shevlin so quickly
today."</p>

<p>"Meaning by that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Meaning," I answered, "that your drunken man has disappeared.
Meaning that it would be entirely possible for him to have been
your confederate. Meaning that the episode which so impressed the
worthy Shevlin could very well have been merely a clever bit of
acting, and the doll in the street and the opportunely speeding
automobile a carefully planned maneuver to bring about the exact
result it had accomplished. After all, I have only your word and
the chauffeur's word that the doll was not down in the car the
whole time you were here last night. Meaning that-"</p>

<p>I stopped, realizing that, essentially, I was only venting
upon him the bad temper aroused by my perplexity.</p>

<p>"I'll finish for you," he said. "Meaning that I'm the one
behind the whole thing."</p>

<p>His face was white, and his muscles tense.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing for you that I like you, Doc," he
continued. "It's a better thing for you that I know you're on the
level with the boss. Best of all, maybe that you're the only one
who can help him, if he can be helped. That's all."</p>

<p>"McCann," I said, "I'm sorry, deeply sorry. Not for what I
said, but for having to say it. After all, the doubt is there.
And it is a reasonable doubt. You must admit that. Better to
spread it before you than keep it hidden."</p>

<p>"What might be my motive?"</p>

<p>"Ricori has powerful enemies. He also has powerful friends.
How convenient to his enemies if he could be wiped out without
suspicion, and a physician of highest repute and unquestionable
integrity be inveigled into giving the death a clean bill of
health. It is my professional pride, not personal egotism, that I
am that kind of a physician, McCann."</p>

<p>He nodded. His face softened and I saw the dangerous tenseness
relax.</p>

<p>"I've no argument, Doc. Not on that or nothing else you've
said. But I'm thanking you for your high opinion of my brains.
It'd certainly take a pretty clever man to work all this out
this-a-way. Sort of like one of them cartoons that shows seventy-
five gimcracks set up to drop a brick on a man's head at exactly
twenty minutes, sixteen seconds after two in the afternoon. Yeah,
I must be clever!"</p>

<p>I winced at this broad sarcasm, but did not answer. McCann
took up the Peters doll and began to examine it. I went to the
'phone to ask Ricori's condition. I was halted by an exclamation
from the gunman. He beckoned me, and handing me the doll, pointed
to the collar of its coat. I felt about it. My fingers touched
what seemed to be the round head of a large pin. I pulled out as
though from a dagger sheath a slender piece of metal nine inches
long. It was thinner than an average hat-pin, rigid and needle-
pointed.</p>

<p>Instantly I knew that I was looking upon the instrument that
had pierced Ricori's heart!</p>

<p>"Another outrage!" McCann drawled. "Maybe I put it there,
Doc!"</p>

<p>"You could have, McCann."</p>

<p>He laughed. I studied the queer blade&mdash;for blade it
surely was. It appeared to be of finest steel, although I was not
sure it was that metal. Its rigidity was like none I knew. The
little knob at the head was half an inch in diameter and less
like a pinhead than the haft of a poniard. Under the magnifying
glass it showed small grooves upon it... as though to make sure
the grip of a hand... a doll's hand a doll's dagger! There were
stains upon it.</p>

<p>I shook my head impatiently, and put the thing aside,
determining to test those stains later. They were bloodstains, I
knew that, but I must make sure. And yet, if they were, it would
not be certain proof of the incredible &mdash;that a doll's hand
had used this deadly thing.</p>

<p>I picked up the Peters doll and began to study it minutely. I
could not determine of what it was made. It was not of wood, like
the other doll. More than anything else, the material resembled a
fusion of gum and wax. I knew of no such composition. I stripped
it of the clothing. The undamaged part of the doll was
anatomically perfect. The hair was human hair, carefully planted
in the scalp. The eyes were blue crystals of some kind. The
clothing showed the same extraordinary skill in the making as the
clothes of Diana's doll.</p>

<p>I saw now that the dangling leg was not held by a thread. It
was held by a wire. Evidently the doll had been molded upon a
wire frame-work. I walked over to my instrument cabinet, and
selected a surgical saw and knives.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Doc." McCann had been following my movements.
"You going to cut this thing apart?"</p>

<p>I nodded. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a heavy
hunting knife. Before I could stop him, he had brought its blade
down like an ax across the neck of the Peters doll. It cut
through it cleanly. He took the head and twisted it. A wire
snapped. He dropped the head on the table, and tossed the body to
me. The head rolled. It came to rest against the cord he had
called the witch's ladder.</p>

<p>The head seemed to twist and to look up at us. I thought for
an instant the eyes flared redly, the features to contort, the
malignancy intensify &mdash;as I had seen it intensify upon
Peters' living face... I caught myself up, angrily a trick of the
light, of course.</p>

<p>I turned to McCann and swore.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>"You're worth more to the boss than I am," he said,
cryptically.</p>

<p>I did not answer. I cut open the decapitated body of the doll.
As I had suspected, it had been built upon a wire framework. As I
cut away the encasing material, I found this framework was a
single wire, or a single metal strand, and that as cunningly as
the doll's body had been shaped, just as cunningly had this wire
been twisted into an outline of the human skeleton!</p>

<p>Not, of course, with minute fidelity, but still with amazing
accuracy... there were no joints nor articulations... the
substance of which the doll was made was astonishingly pliant...
the little hands flexible... it was more like dissecting some
living mannikin than a doll... And it was rather dreadful...</p>

<p>I glanced toward the severed head.</p>

<p>McCann was bending over it, staring down into its eyes, his
own not more than a few inches away from the glinting blue
crystals. His hands clutched the table edge and I saw that they
were strained and tense as though he were making a violent effort
to push himself away. When he had tossed the head upon the table
it had come to rest against the knotted cord&mdash;but now that
cord was twisted around the doll's severed neck and around its
forehead as though it were a small serpent!</p>

<p>And distinctly I saw that McCann's face was moving closer...
slowly closer... to that tiny one... as though it were being
drawn to it... and that in the little face a living evil was
concentrated and that McCann's face was a mask of horror.</p>

<p>"McCann!" I cried, and thrust an arm under his chin, jerking
back his head. And as I did this I could have sworn the doll's
eyes turned to me, and that its lips writhed.</p>

<p>McCann staggered back. He stared at me for a moment, and then
leaped to the table. He picked up the doll's head, dashed it to
the floor and brought his heel down upon it again and again, like
one stamping out the life of a venomous spider. Before he ceased,
the head was a shapeless blotch, all semblance of humanity or
anything else crushed out of it&mdash;but within it the two blue
crystals that had been its eyes still glinted, and the knotted
cord of the witch's ladder still wound through it.</p>

<p>"God! It was... was drawing me down to it..."</p>

<p>McCann lighted a cigarette with shaking hand, tossed the match
away. The match fell upon what had been the doll's head.</p>

<p>There followed, simultaneously, a brilliant flash, a
disconcerting sobbing sound and a wave of intense heat. Where the
crushed head had been there was now only an irregularly charred
spot upon the polished wood. Within it lay the blue crystals that
had been the eyes of the doll&mdash;lusterless and blackened. The
knotted cord had vanished.</p>

<p>And the body of the doll had disappeared. Upon the table was a
nauseous puddle of black waxy liquid out of which lifted the ribs
of the wire skeleton!</p>

<p>The Annex 'phone rang; mechanically I answered it.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ricori, sir. He's out of the coma. He's awake!"</p>

<p>I turned to McCann.</p>

<p>"Ricori's come through!"</p>

<p>He gripped my shoulders&mdash;then drew a step away, a touch
of awe on his face.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" whispered McCann. "Yeah&mdash;he came through when the
knots burned! It freed him! It's you an' me that's got to watch
our step now!"</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; NURSE WALTERS'
DIARY</h2>

 <p class="first">I TOOK McCann up with me to Ricori's bedside.
Confrontation with his chief would be the supreme test, I felt,
resolving one way or another all my doubts as to his sincerity.
For I realized, almost immediately, that bizarre as had been the
occurrences I have just narrated, each and all of them could have
been a part of the elaborate hocus-pocus with which I had
tentatively charged the gunman. The cutting off of the doll's
head could have been a dramatic gesture designed to impress my
imagination. It was he who had called my attention to the
sinister reputation of the knotted cord. It was McCann who had
found the pin. His fascination by the severed head might have
been assumed. And the tossing of the match a calculated action
designed to destroy evidence. I did not feel that I could trust
my own peculiar reactions as valid.</p>

<p>And yet it was difficult to credit McCann with being so
consummate an actor, so subtle a plotter. Ah, but he could be
following the instructions of another mind capable of such
subtleties. I wanted to trust McCann. I hoped that he would pass
the test. Very earnestly I hoped it.</p>

<p>The test was ordained to failure. Ricori was fully conscious,
wide awake, his mind probably as alert and sane as ever. But the
lines of communication were still down. His mind had been freed,
but not his body. The paralysis persisted, forbidding any
muscular movements except the deep-seated unconscious reflexes
essential to the continuance of life. He could not speak. His
eyes looked up at me, bright and intelligent, but from an
expressionless face... looked up at McCann with the same
unchanging stare.</p>

<p>McCann whispered: "Can he hear?"</p>

<p>"I think so, but he has no way of telling us."</p>

<p>The gunman knelt beside the bed and took Ricori's hands in
his. He said, clearly: "Everything's all right, boss. We're all
on the job."</p>

<p>Not the utterance nor the behavior of a guilty man&mdash;but
then I had told him Ricori could not answer. I said to
Ricori:</p>

<p>"You're coming through splendidly. You've had a severe shock,
and I know the cause. I'd rather you were this way for a day or
so than able to move about. I have a perfectly good medical
reason for this. Don't worry, don't fret, try not to think of
anything unpleasant. Let your mind relax. I'm going to give you a
mild hypo. Don't fight it. Let yourself sleep."</p>

<p>I gave him the hypodermic, and watched with satisfaction its
quick effect. It convinced me that he had heard.</p>

<p>I returned to my study with McCann. I was doing some hard
thinking. There was no knowing how long Ricori would remain in
the grip of the paralysis. He might awaken in an hour fully
restored, or it might hold him for days. In the meantime there
were three things I felt it necessary to ascertain. The first
that a thorough watch was being kept upon the place where Ricori
had gotten the doll; second, that everything possible be found
out about the two women McCann had described; third, what it was
that had made Ricori go there. I had determined to take the
gunman's story of the happenings at the store at their face
value&mdash;for the moment at least. At the same time, I did not
want to admit him into my confidence any more than was
necessary.</p>

<p>"McCann," I began, "have you arranged to keep the doll store
under constant surveillance, as we agreed last night?"</p>

<p>"You bet. A flea couldn't hop in or out without being
spotted."</p>

<p>"Any reports?"</p>

<p>"The boys ringed the joint close to midnight. The front's all
dark. There's a building in the back an' a space between it an'
the rear of the joint. There's a window with a heavy shutter, but
a line of light shows under it. About two o'clock this fish-white
gal comes slipping up the street and gets in. The boys at the
back hear a hell of a squalling, an' then the light goes out.
This morning the gal opens the shop. After a while the hag shows
up, too. They're covered, all right."</p>

<p>"What have you found out about them?"</p>

<p>"The hag calls herself Madame Mandilip. The gal's her niece.
Or so she says. They rode in about eight months since. Nobody
knows where from. Pay their bills regular. Seem to have plenty of
money. Niece does all the marketing. The old woman never goes
out. Keep to themselves like a pair of clams. Have strictly
nothing to do with the neighbors. The hag has a bunch of special
customers&mdash;rich-looking people many of them. Does two kinds
of trade, it looks&mdash;regular dolls, an' what goes with 'em,
an' special dolls which they say the old woman's a wonder at.
Neighbors ain't a bit fond of 'em. Some of 'em think she's
handling dope. That's all yet."</p>

<p>Special dolls? Rich people?</p>

<p>Rich people like the spinster Bailey, the banker Marshall?</p>

<p>Regular dolls&mdash;for people like the acrobat, the
bricklayer? But these might have been "special" too, in ways
McCann could not know.</p>

<p>"There's the store," he continued. "Back of it two or three
rooms. Upstairs a big room like a storeroom. They rent the whole
place. The hag an' the wench, they live in the rooms behind the
store."</p>

<p>"Good work!" I applauded, and hesitated&mdash;"McCann, did the
doll remind you of somebody?"</p>

<p>He studied me with narrowed eyes.</p>

<p>"You tell me," he said at last, dryly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I thought it resembled Peters."</p>

<p>"Thought it resembled!" he exploded. "Resembled&mdash;hell! It
was the lick-an'-spit of Peters!"</p>

<p>"Yet you said nothing to me of that. Why?" I asked,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Well I'm damned-" he began, then caught himself. "I knowed
you seen it. I thought you kept quiet account of Shevlin, an'
followed your lead. Afterwards you were so busy putting me
through the jumps there wasn't a chance."</p>

<p>"Whoever made that doll must have known Peters quite well." I
passed over this dig. "Peters must have sat for the doll as one
sits for an artist or a sculptor. Why did he do it? When did he
do it? Why did anyone desire to make a doll like him?"</p>

<p>"Let me work on the hag for an hour an' I'll tell you," he
answered, grimly.</p>

<p>"No," I shook my head. "Nothing of that sort until Ricori can
talk. But maybe we can get some light in another way. Ricori had
a purpose in going to that store. I know what it was. But I do
not know what directed his attention to the store. I have reason
to believe it was information he gained from Peters' sister. Do
you know her well enough to visit her and to draw from her what
it was she told Ricori yesterday? Casually&mdash;tactfully&mdash;
without telling her of Ricori's illness?"</p>

<p>He said, bluntly: "Not without you give me more of a
lead&mdash;Mollie's no fool."</p>

<p>"Very well. I am not aware whether Ricori told you, but the
Darnley woman is dead. We think there is a connection between her
death and Peters' death. We think that it has something to do
with the love of both of them for Mollie's baby. The Darnley
woman died precisely as Peters did-"</p>

<p>He whispered&mdash;"You mean with the
same&mdash;trimmings?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We had reason to think that both might have picked up
the&mdash; the disease&mdash;in the same place. Ricori thought
that perhaps Mollie might know something which would identify
that place. A place where both of them might have gone, not
necessarily at the same time, and have been exposed to&mdash;the
infection. Maybe even a deliberate infection by some ill-disposed
person. Quite evidently what Ricori learned from Mollie sent him
to the Mandilips. There is one awkward thing,
however&mdash;unless Ricori told her yesterday, she does not know
her brother is dead."</p>

<p>"That's right," he nodded. "He gave orders about that."</p>

<p>"If he did not tell her, you must not."</p>

<p>"You're holding back quite a lot, ain't you, Doc?" He drew
himself up to go.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, frankly. "But I've told you enough."</p>

<p>"Yeah? Well, maybe." He regarded me, somberly. "Anyway, I'll
soon know if the boss broke the news to Mollie. If he did, it
opens up the talk natural. If he didn't&mdash;well, I'll call you
up after I've talked to her. Hasta luego."</p>

<p>With this half-mocking adieu he took his departure. I went
over to the remains of the doll upon the table. The nauseous
puddle had hardened. In hardening it had roughly assumed the
aspect of a flattened human body. It had a peculiarly unpleasant
appearance, with the miniature ribs and the snapped wire of the
spine glinting above it. I was overcoming my reluctance to
collect the mess for analysis when Braile came in. I was so full
of Ricori's awakening, and of what had occurred, that it was some
time before I noticed his pallor and gravity. I stopped short in
the recital of my doubts regarding McCann to ask him what was the
matter.</p>

<p>"I woke up this morning thinking of Harriet," he said. "I knew
the 4-9-1 code, if it was a code, could not have meant Diana.
Suddenly it struck me that it might mean Diary. The idea kept
haunting me. When I had a chance I took Robbins and went to the
apartment. We searched, and found Harriet's diary. Here it
is."</p>

<p>He handed me a little red-bound book. He said: "I've gone
through it."</p>

<p>I opened the book. I set down the parts of it pertinent to the
matter under review.</p>
<br>

<p class="journal"><b>Nov. 3</b>. Had a queer sort of experience today.
Dropped down to Battery Park to look at the new fishes in the
Aquarium. Had an hour or so afterwards and went poking around
some of the old streets, looking for something to take home to
Diana. Found the oddest little shop. Quaint and old looking with
some of the loveliest dolls and dolls' clothes in the window I've
ever seen. I stood looking at them and peeping into the shop
through the window. There was a girl in the shop. Her back was
turned to me. She turned suddenly and looked at me. She gave me
the queerest kind of shock. Her face was white, without any color
whatever and her eyes were wide and sort of staring and
frightened. She had a lot of hair, all ashen blonde and piled up
on her head. She was the strangest looking girl I think I've ever
seen. She stared at me for a full minute and I at her. Then she
shook her head violently and made motions with her hands for me
to go away. I was so astonished I could hardly believe my eyes. I
was about to go in and ask her what on earth was the matter with
her when I looked at my watch and found I had just time to get
back to the hospital. I looked into the shop again and saw a door
at the back beginning slowly to open. The girl made one last and
it seemed almost despairing gesture. There was something about it
that suddenly made me want to run. But I didn't. I did walk away
though. I've puzzled about the thing all day. Also, besides being
curious I'm a bit angry. The dolls and clothes are beautiful.
What's wrong with me as a customer? I'm going to find out.</p>
<br>

<p class="journal"><b>Nov. 5</b>. I went back to the doll shop
this afternoon. The mystery deepens. Only I don't think it's much
of a mystery. I think the poor thing is a bit crazy. I didn't
stop to look in the window but went right in the door. The white
girl was at a little counter at the back. When she saw me her
eyes looked more frightened than ever and I could see her
tremble. I went up to her and she whispered, "Oh, why did you
come back? I told you to go away!" I laughed, I couldn't help it,
and I said: "You're the queerest shopkeeper I ever met. Don't you
want people to buy your things?" She said low and very quickly:
"It's too late! You can't go now! But don't touch anything. Don't
touch anything she gives you. Don't touch anything she points out
to you." And then in the most everyday way she said quite
clearly: "Is there anything I can show you? We have everything
for dolls." The transition was so abrupt that it was startling.
Then I saw that a door had opened in the back of the shop, the
same door I had seen opening before, and that a woman was
standing in it looking at me.<p>

<p class="journal">I gaped at her I don't know how long. She was
so truly extraordinary. She must be almost six feet and heavy,
with enormous breasts. Not fat. Powerful. She has a long face and
her skin is brown. She has a distinct mustache and a mop of iron-
gray hair.</p>

<p class="journal">It was her eyes that held me spellbound. They
are simply enormous&mdash; black and so full of life! She must
have a tremendous vitality. Or maybe it is the contrast with the
white girl who seems to be drained of life. No, I'm sure she has
a most unusual vitality. I had the queerest thrill when she was
looking at me. I thought, nonsensically&mdash;"What big eyes you
have, grandma!"</p>

<p class="journal">"The better to see you with, my dear!"</p>

<p class="journal">"What big teeth you have, grandma!"</p>

<p class="journal">"The better to eat you with, my dear!" (I'm
not so sure though that it was all nonsense.) And she really has
big teeth, strong and yellow. I said, quite stupidly: "How do you
do?" She smiled and touched me with her hand and I felt another
queer thrill. Her hands are the most beautiful I ever saw. So
beautiful, they are uncanny. Long with tapering fingers and so
white. Like the hands El Greco or Botticelli put on their women.
I suppose that is what gave me the odd shock. They don't seem to
belong to her immense coarse body at all. But neither do the
eyes. The hands and the eyes go together. Yes, that's it.</p>

<p class="journal">She smiled and said: "You love beautiful
things." Her voice belongs to hands and eyes. A deep rich glowing
contralto. I could feel it go through me like an organ chord. I
nodded. She said: "Then you shall see them, my dear. Come." She
paid no attention to the girl. She turned to the door and I
followed her. As I went through the door I looked back at the
girl. She appeared more frightened than ever and distinctly I saw
her lips form the word&mdash; "Remember."</p>

<p class="journal">The room she led me into was&mdash;well, I
can't describe it. It was like her eyes and hands and voice. When
I went into it I had the strange feeling that I was no longer in
New York. Nor in America. Nor anywhere on earth, for that matter.
I had the feeling that the only real place that existed was the
room. It was frightening. The room was larger than it seemed
possible it could be, judging from the size of the store. Perhaps
it was the light that made it seem so. A soft mellow, dusky
light. It is exquisitely paneled, even the ceiling. On one side
there is nothing but these beautiful old dark panelings with
carvings in very low relief covering them. There is a fireplace
and a fire was burning in it. It was unusually warm but the
warmth was not oppressive. There was a faint fragrant odor,
probably from the burning wood. The furniture is old and
exquisite too, but unfamiliar. There are some tapestries, clearly
ancient. It is curious, but I find it difficult to recall clearly
just what is in that room. All that is clear is its unfamiliar
beauty. I do remember clearly an immense table, and I recall
thinking of it as a "baronial board." And I remember intensely
the round mirror, and I don't like to think of that.</p>

<p class="journal">I found myself telling her all about myself
and about Diana, and how she loved beautiful things. She
listened, and said in that deep, sweet voice, "She shall have one
beautiful thing, my dear." She went to a cabinet and came to me
with the loveliest doll I have ever seen. It made me gasp when I
thought how Di would love it. A little baby doll, and so life-
like and exquisite.</p>

<p class="journal">"Would she like that?" she asked.</p>

<p class="journal">I said: "But I could never afford such a
treasure. I'm poor."</p>

<p class="journal">And she laughed, and said: "But I am not poor.
This shall be yours when I have finished dressing it."</p>

<p class="journal">It was rude, but I could not help saying: "You
must be very, very rich to have all these lovely things. I wonder
why you keep a doll store."</p>

<p class="journal">And she laughed again and said, "Just to meet
nice people like you, my dear."</p>

<p class="journal">It was then I had the peculiar experience,
with the mirror. It was round and I had looked and looked at it
because it was like, I thought, the half of an immense globule of
clearest water. Its frame was brown wood elaborately carved, and
now and then the reflection of the carvings seemed to dance in
the mirror like vegetation on the edge of a woodland pool when a
breeze ruffles it. I had been wanting to look into it, and all at
once the desire became irresistible. I walked to the mirror. I
could see the whole room reflected in it. Just as though I were
looking not at its image or my own image but into another similar
room with a similar me peering out. And then there was a wavering
and the reflection of the room became misty, although the
reflection of myself was perfectly clear. Then I could see only
myself, and I seemed to be getting smaller and smaller until I
was no bigger than a large doll. I brought my face closer and the
little face thrust itself forward. I shook my head and smiled,
and it did the same. It was my reflection&mdash;but so small! And
suddenly I felt frightened and shut my eyes tight. And when I
looked in the mirror again everything was as it had been
before.</p>

<p class="journal">I looked at my watch and was appalled at the
time I had spent. I arose to go, still with the panicky feeling
at my heart. She said: "Visit me again tomorrow, my dear. I will
have the doll ready for you." I thanked her and said I would. She
went with me to the door of the shop. The girl did not look at me
as I passed through.</p>

<p class="journal">Her name is Madame Mandilip. I am not going to
her tomorrow nor ever again. She fascinates me but she makes me
afraid. I don't like the way I felt before the round mirror. And
when I first looked into it and saw the whole room reflected, why
didn't I see her image in it? I did not! And although the room
was lighted, I can't remember seeing any windows or lamps. And
that girl! And yet&mdash;Di would love the doll so!</p>
<br>

<p class="journal"><b>Nov. 7</b>. Queer how difficult it is to keep to
my resolution not to return to Madame Mandilip. It makes me so
restless! Last night I had a terrifying dream. I thought I was
back in that room. I could see it distinctly. And suddenly I
realized I was looking out into it. And that I was inside the
mirror. I knew I was little. Like a doll. I was frightened and I
beat against it, and fluttered against it like a moth against a
windowpane. Then I saw two beautiful long white hands stretching
out to me. They opened the mirror and caught me and I struggled
and fought and tried to get away. I woke with my heart beating so
hard it nigh smothered me. Di says I was crying out: "No! No! I
won't! No, I won't!" over and over. She threw a pillow at me and
I suppose that's what awakened me.</p>

<p class="journal">Today I left the
hospital at four, intending to go right home. I don't know what I
could have been thinking about, but whatever it was I must have
been mighty preoccupied. I woke up to find myself in the Subway
station just getting on a Bowling Green train. That would have
taken me to the Battery. I suppose absentmindedly I had set out
for Madame Mandilip's. It gave me such a start that I almost ran
out of the station and up to the street. I think I'm acting very
stupidly. I always have prided myself on my common sense. I think
I must consult Dr. Braile and see whether I'm becoming neurotic.
There's no earthly reason why I shouldn't go to see Madame
Mandilip. She is most interesting and certainly showed she liked
me. It was so gracious of her to offer me that lovely doll. She
must think me ungrateful and rude. And it would please Di so.</p>

<p class="journal">When I think of how I've been feeling about
the mirror it makes me feel as childish as Alice in Wonderland or
Through the Looking Glass, rather. Mirrors or any other
reflecting surfaces make you see queer things sometimes. Probably
the heat and the fragrance had a lot to do with it. I really
don't know that Madame Mandilip wasn't reflected. I was too
intent upon looking at myself. It's too absurd to run away and
hide like a child from a witch. Yet that's precisely what I'm
doing. If it weren't for that girl&mdash;but she certainly is a
neurotic! I want to go, and I just don't see why I'm behaving
so.</p>
<br>

<p class="journal"><b>Nov. 10</b>. Well, I'm glad I didn't persist in
that ridiculous idea. Madame Mandilip is wonderful. Of course,
there are some queer things I don't understand, but that's
because she is so different from any one I've ever met and
because when I get inside her room life becomes so different.
When I leave, it's like going out of some enchanted castle into
the prosiest kind of world. Yesterday afternoon I determined I'd
go to see her straight from the hospital. The moment I made up my
mind I felt as though a cloud had lifted from it. Gayer and
happier than I've been for a week. When I went in the store the
white girl&mdash;her name is Laschna&mdash;stared at me as though
she was going to cry. She said, in the oddest choked voice,
"Remember that I tried to save you!"</p>

<p class="journal">It seemed so funny that I laughed and laughed.
Then Madame Mandilip opened the door, and when I looked at her
eyes and heard her voice I knew why I was so light-
hearted&mdash;it was like coming home after the most awful siege
of home-sickness. The lovely room welcomed me. It really did.
It's the only way I can describe it. I have the queer feeling
that the room is as alive as Madame Mandilip. That it is a part
of her&mdash;or rather, a part of the part of her that are her
eyes and hands and voice. She didn't ask me why I had stayed
away. She brought out the doll. It is more wonderful than ever.
She has still some work to do on it. We sat and talked, and then
she said: "I'd like to make a doll of you, my dear." Those were
her exact words, and for just an instant I had a frightened
feeling because I remembered my dream and saw myself fluttering
inside the mirror and trying to get out. And then I realized it
was just her way of speaking, and that she meant she would like
to make a doll that looked like me. So I laughed and said, "Of
course you can make a doll of me, Madame Mandilip." I wonder what
nationality she is.</p>
<p class="journal">She laughed with me, her big eyes bigger than
ever and very bright. She brought out some wax and began to model
my head. Those beautiful long fingers worked rapidly as though
each of them was a little artist in itself. I watched them,
fascinated. I began to get sleepy, and sleepier and sleepier. She
said, "My dear, I do wish you'd take off your clothes and let me
model your whole body. Don't be shocked. I'm just an old
woman."</p>

<p class="journal">I didn't mind at all, and I said sleepily,
"Why, of course you can."</p>

<p class="journal">And I stood on a little stool and watched the
wax taking shape under those white fingers until it had become a
small and most perfect copy of me. I knew it was perfect,
although I was so sleepy I could hardly see it. I was so sleepy
Madame Mandilip had to help me dress, and then I must have gone
sound asleep, because I woke up with quite a start to find her
patting my hands and saying, "I'm sorry I tired you, child. Stay
if you wish. But if you must go, it is growing late."</p>

<p class="journal">I looked at my watch and I was still so sleepy
I could hardly see it, but I knew it was dreadfully late. Then
Madame Mandilip pressed her hands over my eyes and suddenly I was
wide awake. She said, "Come tomorrow and take the doll." I said,
"I must pay you what I can afford." She said, "You've paid me in
full, my dear, by letting me make a doll of you." Then we both
laughed and I hurried out. The white girl was busy with someone,
but I called "au 'voir" to her. Probably she didn't hear me, for
she didn't answer.</p>
<br>

<p class="journal"><b>Nov. 11</b>. I have the doll and Diana is crazy
about it! How glad I am I didn't surrender to that silly morbid
feeling. Di has never had anything that has given her such
happiness. She adores it! Sat again for Madame Mandilip this
afternoon for the finishing touches on my own doll. She is a
genius. Truly a genius! I wonder more than ever why she is
content to run a little shop. She surely could take her place
among the greatest of artists. The doll literally is me. She
asked if she could cut some of my hair for its head and of course
I let her. She tells me this doll is not the real doll she is
going to make of me. That will be much larger. This is just the
model from which she will work. I told her I thought this was
perfect but she said the other would be of less perishable
material. Maybe she will give me this one after she is finished
with it. I was so anxious to take the baby doll home to Di that I
didn't stay long. I smiled and spoke to Laschna as I went out,
and she nodded to me although not very cordially. I wonder if she
can be jealous.</p>

<p class="journal"><b>Nov. 13</b>. This is the first time I have felt
like writing since that dreadful case of Mr. Peters on the
morning of the 10th. I had just finished writing about Di's doll
when the hospital called to say they wanted me on duty that
night. Of course, I said I would come. Oh, but I wish I hadn't.
I'll never forget that dreadful death. Never! I don't want to
write or think about it.</p>

<p class="journal">When I came home that morning I could
not sleep, and I tossed and tossed trying to get his face out of
my mind. I thought I had schooled myself too well to be affected
by any patient. But there was something&mdash;Then I thought that
if there was anyone who could help me to forget, it would be
Madame Mandilip. So about two o'clock I went down to see her.
Madame was in the store with Laschna and seemed surprised to see
me so early. And not so pleased as usual, or so I thought but
perhaps it was my nervousness.</p>

<p class="journal">The moment I entered the lovely room I began
to feel better. Madame had been doing something with wire on the
table but I couldn't see what because she made me sit in a big
comfortable chair, saying, "You look tired, child. Sit here and
rest until I'm finished and here's an old picture book that will
keep you interested."</p>

<p class="journal">She gave me a queer old book,
long and narrow and it must have been very old because it was on
vellum or something and the pictures and their colorings were
like some of those books that have come down from the Middle
Ages, the kind the old monks used to paint. They were all scenes
in forests or gardens and the flowers and trees were the
queerest! There were no people or anything in them but you had
the strangest feeling that if you had just a little better eyes
you could see people or something behind them. I mean it was as
though they were hiding behind the trees and flowers or among
them and looking out at you.</p>

<p class="journal">I don't know how long I studied the
pictures, trying and trying to see those hidden folk, but at last
Madame called me. I went to the table with the book still in my
hand. She said, "That's for the doll I am making of you. Take it
up and see how cleverly it is done."</p>

<p class="journal">And she pointed to something
made of wire on the table. I reached out to pick it up and then
suddenly I saw that it was a skeleton. It was little, like a
child's skeleton and all at once the face of Mr. Peters flashed
in my mind and I screamed in a moment of perfectly crazy panic
and threw out my hands. The book flew out of my hand and dropped
on the little wire skeleton and there was a sharp twang and the
skeleton seemed to jump.</p>

<p class="journal">I recovered myself immediately and I saw
that the end of the wire had come loose and had cut the binding
of the book and was still stuck in it. For a moment Madame was
dreadfully angry. She caught my arm and squeezed it so it hurt
and her eyes were furious and she said in the strangest voice,
"Why did you do that? Answer me. Why?"</p>

<p class="journal">And she actually shook me.
I don't blame her now, although then she really did frighten me,
because she must have thought I did it deliberately. Then she saw
how I was trembling and her eyes and voice became gentle and she
said, "Something is troubling you, my dear. Tell me and perhaps I
can help you."</p>

<p class="journal">She made me lie down upon a divan and sat beside
me and stroked my hair and forehead and though I never discuss
our cases to others I found myself pouring out the whole story of
the Peters case. She asked who was the man who had brought him to
the hospital and I said Dr. Lowell called him Ricori and I
supposed he was the notorious gangster. Her hands made me feel
quiet and nice and sleepy and I told her about Dr. Lowell and how
great a doctor he is and how terribly I am in love in secret with
Dr. B. I'm sorry I told her about the case. Never have I done
such a thing. But I was so shaken and once I had begun I seemed
to have to tell her everything.</p>

<p class="journal">Everything in my mind was so
distorted that once when I had lifted my head to look at her I
actually thought she was gloating. That shows how little I was
like myself! After I had finished she told me to lie there and
sleep and she would waken me when I wished. So I said I must go
at four. I went right to sleep and woke up feeling rested and
fine.</p>

<p class="journal">When I went out the little skeleton and book
were still on the table, and I said I was so sorry about the
book. She said, "Better the book than your hand, my dear. The
wire might have snapped loose while you were handling it and
given you a nasty cut." She wants me to bring down my nurse's
dress so she can make a little one like it for the new doll.</p>
<br>

<p class="journal"><b>Nov. 14</b>. I wish I'd never gone to Madame
Mandilip's. I wouldn't have had my foot scalded. But that's not
the real reason I'm sorry. I couldn't put it in words if I tried.
But I do wish I hadn't.</p>

<p class="journal">I took the nurse's costume down to her
this afternoon. She made a little model of it very quickly. She
was gay and sang me some of the most haunting little songs. I
couldn't understand the words. She laughed when I asked her what
the language was and said, "The language of the people who peeped
at you from the pictures of the book, my dear."</p>

<p class="journal">That was a strange thing to say. How did she
know I thought there were people hidden in the pictures? I do
wish I'd never gone there. She brewed some tea and poured cups
for us. And then just as she was handing me mine her elbow struck
the teapot and overturned it and the scalding tea poured right
down over my right foot. It pained atrociously. She took off the
shoe and stripped off the stocking and spread salve of some sort
over the scald. She said it would take out the pain and heal it
immediately. It did stop the pain, and when I came home I could
hardly believe my eyes. Job wouldn't believe it had really been
scalded.</p>

<p class="journal">Madame Mandilip was terribly distressed about
it. At least she seemed to be. I wonder why she didn't go to the
door with me as usual. She didn't. She stayed in the room. The
white girl, Laschna, was close to the door when I went out into
the store. She looked at the bandage on my foot and I told her it
had been scalded but Madame had dressed it. She didn't even say
she was sorry. As I went out I looked at her and said a bit
angrily, "Goodbye." Her eyes filled with tears and she looked at
me in the strangest way and shook her head and said "Au 'voir!" I
looked at her again as I shut the door and the tears were rolling
down her cheeks. I wonder&mdash;why? (I wish I had never gone to
Madame Mandilip!!!)</p>
<br>

<p class="journal"><b>Nov. 15</b>. Foot all healed. I haven't the
slightest desire to return to Madame Mandilip's. I shall never go
there again. I wish I could destroy that doll she gave me for Di.
But it would break the child's heart.</p>
<br>

<p class="journal"><b>Nov. 20</b>. Still no desire to see her. I find
I'm forgetting all about her. The only time I think of her is
when I see Di's doll. I'm glad! So glad I want to dance and sing.
I'll never see her again.</p>

<p class="journal">But dear God how I wish I never had seen her!
And still I don't know why.</p>

<p><br>
This was the last reference to Madame Mandilip in Nurse
Walters' diary. She died on the morning of November 25.</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; END OF THE PETERS
DOLL</h2>

<p class="first">Braile had been watching me closely. I met his
questioning gaze, and tried to conceal the perturbation which the
diary had aroused. I said:</p>

<p>"I never knew Walters had so imaginative a mind."</p>

<p>He flushed and asked angrily: "You think she was
fictionizing?"</p>

<p>"Not fictionizing, exactly. Observing a series of ordinary
occurrences through the glamour of an active imagination would be
a better way of putting it."</p>

<p>He said, incredulously, "You don't realize that what she has
written is an authentic, even though unconscious, description of
an amazing piece of hypnotism?"</p>

<p>"The possibility did occur to me," I answered tartly. "But I
find no actual evidence to support it. I do perceive, however,
that Walters was not so well balanced as I had supposed her. I do
find evidence that she was surprisingly emotional; that in at
least one of her visits to this Madame Mandilip she was plainly
overwrought and in an extreme state of nervous instability. I
refer to her most indiscreet discussion of the Peters case, after
she had been warned by me, you will remember, to say nothing of
it to anyone whatsoever."</p>

<p>"I remember it so well," he said, "that when I came to that
part of the diary I had no further doubt of the hypnotism.
Nevertheless, go on."</p>

<p>"In considering two possible causes for any action, it is
desirable to accept the more reasonable," I said, dryly.
"Consider the actual facts, Braile. Walters lays stress upon the
odd conduct and warnings of the girl. She admits the girl is a
neurotic. Well, the conduct she describes is exactly what we
would expect from a neurotic. Walters is attracted by the dolls
and goes in to price them, as anyone would. She is acting under
no compulsion. She meets a woman whose physical characteristics
stimulate her imagination &mdash;and arouse her emotionalism. She
confides in her. This woman, evidently also of the emotional
type, likes her and makes her a present of a doll. The woman is
an artist; she sees in Walters a desirable model. She asks her to
pose&mdash;still no compulsion and a natural request&mdash;and
Walters does pose for her. The woman has her technique, like all
artists, and part of it is to make skeletons for the framework of
her dolls. A natural and intelligent procedure. The sight of the
skeleton suggests death to Walters, and the suggestion of death
brings up the image of Peters which has been powerfully impressed
upon her imagination. She becomes momentarily hysterical
&mdash;again evidence of her overwrought condition. She takes tea
with the doll-maker and is accidentally scalded. Naturally this
arouses the solicitude of her hostess and she dresses the scald
with some unguent in whose efficacy she believes. And that is
all. Where in this entirely commonplace sequence of events is
there evidence that Walters was hypnotized? Finally, assuming
that she was hypnotized, what evidence is there of motive?"</p>

<p>"She herself gave it," he said, "'to make a doll of you, my
dear!'"</p>

<p>I had almost convinced myself by my argument, and this remark
exasperated me.</p>

<p>"I suppose," I said, "you want me to believe that once lured
into the shop, Walters was impelled by occult arts to return
until this Madame Mandilip's devilish purpose was accomplished.
That the compassionate shop-girl tried to save her from what the
old melodramas called a fate worse than death&mdash;although not
precisely the fate they meant. That the doll she was to be given
for her niece was the bait on the hook of a sorceress. That it
was necessary she be wounded so the witch's salve could be
applied. That it was the salve which carried the unknown death.
That the first trap failing, the accident of the tea-kettle was
contrived and was successful. And that now Walters' soul is
fluttering inside the witch's mirror, just as she had dreamed.
And all this, my dear Braile, is the most outrageous
superstition!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said obliquely. "So those possibilities did occur to
you after all? Your mind is not so fossilized as a few moments
ago I supposed."</p>

<p>I became still more exasperated.</p>

<p>"It is your theory that from the moment Walters entered the
store, every occurrence she has narrated was designed to give
this Madame Mandilip possession of her soul, a design that was
consummated by Walters' death?"</p>

<p>He hesitated, and then said: "In essence&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"A soul!" I mused, sardonically. "But I have never seen a
soul. I know of no one whose evidence I would credit who has seen
a soul. What is a soul &mdash;if it exists? It is ponderable?
Material? If your theory is correct it must be. How could one
gain possession of something which is both imponderable and
nonmaterial? How would one know one had it if it could not be
seen nor weighed, felt nor measured, nor heard? If not material,
how could it be constrained, directed, confined? As you suggest
has been done with Walters' soul by this doll-maker. If material,
then where does it reside in the body? Within the brain? I have
operated upon hundreds and never yet have I opened any secret
chamber housing this mysterious occupant. Little cells, far more
complicated in their workings than any machinery ever devised,
changing their possessor's mentality, moods, reason, emotion,
personality &mdash;according to whether the little cells are
functioning well or ill. These I have found, Braile&mdash;but
never a soul. Surgeons have thoroughly explored the balance of
the body. They, too, have found no secret temple within it. Show
me a soul, Braile, and I'll believe in Madame Mandilip."</p>

<p>He studied me in silence for a little, then nodded.</p>

<p>"Now I understand. It's hit you pretty hard, too, hasn't it?
You're doing a little beating of your own against the mirror,
aren't you? Well, I've had a struggle to thrust aside what I've
been taught is reality and to admit there may be something else
just as real. This matter, Lowell, is extra-medical, outside the
science we know. Until we admit that, we'll get nowhere. There
are still two points I'd like to take up. Peters and the Darnley
woman died the same kind of death. Ricori finds that they both
had dealings with a Madame Mandilip&mdash;or so we can assume. He
visits her and narrowly escapes death. Harriet visits her, and
dies as Darnley and Peters did. Reasonably, therefore, doesn't
all this point to Madame Mandilip as a possible source of the
evil that overtook all four?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," I answered.</p>

<p>"Then it must follow that there could have been real cause for
the fear and forebodings of Harriet. That there could exist a
cause other than emotionalism and too much imagination&mdash;even
though Harriet were unaware of these circumstances."</p>

<p>Too late I realized the dilemma into which my admission had
put me, but I could answer only in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"The second point is her loss of all desire to return to the
doll-maker after the teapot incident. Did that strike you as
curious?"</p>

<p>"No. If she were emotionally unstable, the shock would
automatically set itself up as an inhibition, a subconscious
barrier. Unless they are masochists, such types do not like to
return to the scene of an unpleasant experience."</p>

<p>"Did you notice her remark that after the scalding, the woman
did not accompany her to the door of the store? And that it was
the first time she had neglected to do so?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly. Why?"</p>

<p>"This. If the application of the salve constituted the final
act, and thereafter death became inevitable, it might be highly
embarrassing to Madame Mandilip to have her victim going in and
out of her shop during the time it took the poison to kill. The
seizure might even take place there, and lead to dangerous
questions. The clever thing, therefore, would be to cause the
unsuspecting sacrifice to lose all interest in her; indeed, feel
a repulsion against her, or even perhaps forget her. This could
be easily accomplished by post-hypnotic suggestion. And Madame
Mandilip had every opportunity for it. Would this not explain
Harriet's distaste as logically as imagination&mdash; or
emotionalism?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I admitted.</p>

<p>"And so," he said, "we have the woman's failure to go to the
door with Harriet that day explained. Her plot has succeeded. It
is all over. And she has planted her suggestion. No need now for
any further contact with Harriet. She lets her go, unaccompanied.
Significant symbolism of finality!"</p>

<p>He sat thinking.</p>

<p>"No need to meet Harriet again," he half-whispered, "till
after death!"</p>

<p>I said, startled: "What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," he answered.</p>

<p>He crossed to the charred spot upon the floor and picked up
the heat-blasted crystals. They were about twice the size of
olive pits and apparently of some composite. He walked to the
table and looked down upon the grotesque figure with its skeleton
ribs.</p>

<p>"Suppose the heat melted it?" he asked, and reached over to
lift the skeleton. It held fast, and he gave it a sharp tug.
There was a shrill twanging sound, and he dropped it with a
startled oath. The thing fell to the floor. It writhed, the
single wire of which it was made uncoiling.</p>

<p>Uncoiling, it glided over the floor like a serpent and came to
rest, quivering.</p>

<p>We looked from it to the table.</p>

<p>The substance that had resembled a sprawling, flattened,
headless body was gone. In its place was a film of fine gray dust
which swirled and eddied for a moment in some unfelt
draft&mdash;and then, too, was gone.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; NURSE'S CAP AND
WITCH'S LADDER</h2>

<p class="first">"She knows how to get rid of the evidence!"</p>

<p>Braile laughed&mdash;but there was no mirth in his laughter. I
said nothing. It was the same thought I had held of McCann when
the doll's head had vanished. But McCann could not be suspected
of this. Evading any further discussion of the matter, we went to
the Annex to see Ricori.</p>

<p>There were two new guards on watch at his door. They arose
politely and spoke to us pleasantly. We entered softly. Ricori
had slipped out of the drug into a natural sleep. He was
breathing easily, peacefully, in deep and healing slumber.</p>

<p>His room was a quiet one at the rear, overlooking a little
enclosed garden. Both my houses are old-fashioned, dating back to
a more peaceful New York; sturdy vines of Virginia creepers climb
up them both at front and back. I cautioned the nurse to maintain
utmost quiet, arranging her light so that it would cast only the
slightest gleam upon Ricori. Going out, I similarly cautioned the
guards, telling them that their chief's speedy recovery might
depend upon silence.</p>

<p>It was now after six. I asked Braile to stay for dinner, and
afterward to drop in on my patients at the hospital and to call
me up if he thought it worthwhile. I wanted to stay at home and
await Ricori's awakening, should it occur.</p>

<p>We had almost finished dinner when the telephone rang. Braile
answered.</p>

<p>"McCann," he said. I went to the instrument.</p>

<p>"Hello, McCann. This is Dr. Lowell."</p>

<p>"How's the boss?"</p>

<p>"Better, I'm expecting him to awaken any moment and to be able
to talk," I answered, and listened intently to catch whatever
reaction he might betray to this news.</p>

<p>"That's great, Doc!" I could detect nothing but deepest
satisfaction in his tones. "Listen, Doc, I seen Mollie an' I got
some news. Dropped round on her right after I left you. Found
Gilmore&mdash;that's her husband&mdash; home, an' that gave me a
break. Said I'd come in to ask her how she'd like a little ride.
She was tickled an' we left Gil home with the kid-"</p>

<p>"Does she know of Peters' death?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Nope. An' I didn't tell her. Now listen. I told you
Horty&mdash;What? Why Missus Darnley, Jim Wilson's gal. Yeah. Let
me talk, will you? I told you Horty was nuts on Mollie's kid.
Early last month Horty comes in with a swell doll for the kid.
Also she's nursing a sore hand she says she gets at the same
place she got the doll. The woman she gets the doll from gave it
to her, she tells Mollie&mdash;What? No, gave her the doll, not
the hand. Say, Doc, ain't I speaking clear? Yeah, she gets her
hand hurt where she got the doll. That's what I said. The woman
fixes it up for her. She gives her the doll for nothing, Horty
tells Mollie, because she thought Horty was so pretty an' for
posing for her. Yeah, posing for her, making a statue of her or
something. That makes a hit with Horty because she don't hate
herself an' she thinks this doll woman a lallapaloozer. Yeah, a
lallapaloozer, a corker! Yeah.</p>

<p>"About a week later Tom&mdash;that's Peters&mdash;shows up
while Horty's there an' sees the doll. Tom's a mite jealous of
Horty with the kid an' asks her where she got it. She tells him a
Madame Mandilip, an' where, an' Tom he says as this is a gal-doll
she needs company, so he'll go an' get a boy-doll. About a week
after this Tom turns up with a boy-doll the lick-an'-split of
Horty's. Mollie asks him if he pays as much for it as Horty. They
ain't told him about Horty not paying nothing for it or posing.
Mollie says Tom looks sort of sheepish but all he says is, well,
he ain't gone broke on it. She's going to kid him by asking if
the doll woman thinks he's so pretty she wants him to pose, but
the kid sets up a whoop about the boy-doll an' she forgets it.
Tom don't show up again till about the first of this month. He's
got a bandage on his hand an' Mollie, kidding, asks him if he got
it where he got the doll. He looks surprised an' says 'yes, but
how the hell did you know that?' Yeah-yeah, that's what she says
he told her. What's that? Did the Mandilip woman bandage it for
him? How the hell&mdash; I don't know. I guess so, maybe. Mollie
didn't say an' I didn't ask. Listen, Doc, I told you Mollie's no
dummy. What I'm telling you took me two hours to get. Talking
'bout this, talking 'bout that an' coming back casual like to
what I'm trying to find out. I'm afraid to ask too many
questions. What? Oh, that's all right, Doc. No offense. Yeah, I
think it pretty funny myself. But like I'm telling you I'm afraid
to go too far. Mollie's too wise.</p>

<p>"Well, when Ricori comes up yesterday he uses the same tactics
as me, I guess. Anyway, he admires the dolls an' asks her where
she gets 'em an' how much they cost an' so on. Remember, I told
you I stay out in the car while he's there. It's after that he
goes home an' does the telephoning an' then beats it to the
Mandilip hag. Yeah, that's all. Does it mean anything? Yeah? All
right then."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment or two, but I had not heard the
click of the receiver. I asked:</p>

<p>"Are you there, McCann?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. I was just thinking." His voice held a wistful note.
"I'd sure like to be with you when the boss comes to. But I'd
best go down an' see how the hands are getting along with them
two Mandilip cows. Maybe I'll call you up if it ain't too late.
G'by."</p>

<p>I walked slowly back to Braile, trying to marshal my
disjointed thoughts. I repeated McCann's end of the conversation
to him exactly. He did not interrupt me. When I had finished he
said quietly:</p>

<p>"Hortense Darnley goes to the Mandilip woman, is given a doll,
is asked to pose, is wounded there, is treated there. And dies.
Peters goes to the Mandilip woman, gets a doll, is wounded there,
is presumably treated there. And dies like Hortense. You see a
doll for which, apparently, he has posed. Harriet goes through
the same routine. And dies like Hortense and Peters. Now
what?"</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt rather old and tired. It is not precisely
stimulating to see crumbling what one has long believed to be a
fairly well ordered world of recognized cause and effect. I said
wearily:</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>He arose, and patted my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Get some sleep. The nurse will call you if Ricori wakes.
We'll get to the bottom of this thing."</p>

<p>"Even if we fall to it," I said, and smiled.</p>

<p>"Even if we have to fall to it," he repeated, and did not
smile.</p>

<p>After Braile had gone I sat for long, thinking. Then,
determined to dismiss my thoughts, I tried to read. I was too
restless, and soon gave it up. Like the room in which Ricori lay,
my study is at the rear, looking down upon the little garden. I
walked to the window and stared out, unseeingly. More vivid than
ever was that feeling of standing before a blank door which it
was vitally important to open. I turned back into the study and
was surprised to find it was close to ten o'clock. I dimmed my
light and lay down upon the comfortable couch. Almost immediately
I fell asleep.</p>

<p>I awoke from that sleep with a start, as though someone had
spoken in my ear. I sat up, listening. There was utter silence
around me. And suddenly I was aware that it was a strange
silence, unfamiliar and oppressive. A thick, dead silence that
filled the study and through which no sound from outside could
penetrate. I jumped to my feet and turned on the lights, full.
The silence retreated, seemed to pour out of the room like
something tangible. But slowly. Now I could hear the ticking of
my clock&mdash;ticking out abruptly, as though a silencing cover
had been whisked from it. I shook my head impatiently, and walked
to the window. I leaned out to breathe the cool night air. I
leaned out still more, so that I could see the window of Ricori's
room, resting my hand on the trunk of the vine. I felt a tremor
along it as though someone were gently shaking it&mdash;or as
though some small animal were climbing it -</p>

<p>The window of Ricori's room broke into a square of light.
Behind me I heard the shrilling of the Annex alarm bell which
meant the urgent need of haste. I raced out of the study, and up
the stairs and over.</p>

<p>As I ran into the corridor I saw that the guards were not at
the door. The door was open. I stood stock-still on its
threshold, incredulous -</p>

<p>One guard crouched beside the window, automatic in hand. The
other knelt beside a body on the floor, his pistol pointed toward
me. At her table sat the nurse, head bent upon her
breast&mdash;unconscious or asleep. The bed was empty. The body
on the floor was Ricori!</p>

<p>The guard lowered his gun. I dropped at Ricori's side. He was
lying face down, stretched out a few feet from the bed. I turned
him over. His face had the pallor of death, but his heart was
beating.</p>

<p>"Help me lift him to the bed," I said to the guard. "Then shut
that door."</p>

<p>He did so, silently. The man at the window asked from the side
of his mouth, never relaxing his watch outward:</p>

<p>"Boss dead?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," I answered, then swore as I seldom do&mdash;"What
the hell kind of guards are you?"</p>

<p>The man who had shut the door gave a mirthless chuckle.</p>

<p>"There's more'n you goin' to ask that, Doc."</p>

<p>I gave a glance at the nurse. She still sat huddled in the
limp attitude of unconsciousness or deep sleep. I stripped Ricori
of his pajamas and went over his body. There was no mark upon
him. I sent for adrenalin, gave him an injection and went over to
the nurse, and shook her. She did not awaken. I raised her
eyelids. The pupils of her eyes were contracted. I flashed a
light in them, without response. Her pulse and respiration were
slow, but not dangerously so. I let her be for a moment and
turned to the guards.</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>They looked at each other uneasily. The guard at the window
waved his hand as though bidding the other do the talking. This
guard said:</p>

<p>"We're sitting out there. All at once the house gets damned
still. I says to Jack there, 'Sounds like they put a silencer on
the dump.' He says, 'Yeah.' We sit listening. Then all at once we
hear a thump inside here. Like somebody falling out of bed. We
crash the door. There's the boss like you seen him on the floor.
There's the nurse asleep like you see her. We glim the alarm and
pull it. Then we wait for somebody to come. That's all, ain't it,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," answered the guard at the window, tonelessly. "Yeah, I
guess that's all."</p>

<p>I looked at him, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You guess that's all? What do you mean&mdash;you guess?"</p>

<p>Again they looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Better come clean, Bill," said the guard at the window.</p>

<p>"Hell, he won't believe it," said the other.</p>

<p>"And nobody else. Anyway, tell him."</p>

<p>The guard Bill said:</p>

<p>"When we crash the door we seen something like a couple of
cats fighting there beside the window. The boss is lying on the
floor. We had our guns out but was afraid to shoot for what you
told us. Then we heard a funny noise outside like somebody
blowing a flute. The two things broke loose and jumped up on the
window sill, and out. We jumped to the window. And we didn't see
nothing."</p>

<p>"You saw the things at the window. What did they look like
then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You tell him, Jack."</p>

<p>"Dolls!"</p>

<p>A shiver went down my back. It was the answer I had
expected&mdash;and dreaded. Out the window! I recalled the tremor
of the vine when I gripped it! The guard who had closed the door
looked at me, and I saw his jaw drop.</p>

<p>"Jesus, Jack!" he gasped. "He believes it!"</p>

<p>I forced myself to speak.</p>

<p>"What kind of dolls?"</p>

<p>The guard at the window answered, more confidently.</p>

<p>"One we couldn't see well. The other looked like one of your
nurses if she'd shrunk to about two feet!"</p>

<p>One of my nurses... Walters... I felt a wave of weakness and
sank down on the edge of Ricori's bed.</p>

<p>Something white on the floor at the head of it caught my eye.
I stared at it stupidly, then leaned and picked it up.</p>

<p>It was a nurse's cap, a little copy of those my nurses wear.
It was about large enough to fit the head of a two foot
doll...</p>

<p>There was something else where it had been. I picked that
up.</p>

<p>It was a knotted cord of hair pale ashen hair with nine
curious knots spaced at irregular intervals along it...</p>

<p>The guard named Bill stood looking down at me anxiously. He
asked:</p>

<p>"Want me to call any of your people, Doc?"</p>

<p>"Try to get hold of McCann," I bade him; then spoke to the
other guard: "Close the windows and fasten them and pull down the
curtains. Then lock the door."</p>

<p>Bill began to telephone. Stuffing the cap and knotted cord in
my pocket, I walked over to the nurse. She was rapidly recovering
and in a minute or two I had her awake. At first her eyes dwelt
on me, puzzled; took in the lighted room and the two men, and the
puzzlement changed to alarm. She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"I didn't see you come in! Did I fall asleep... what's
happened?... " Her hand went to her throat.</p>

<p>"I'm hoping you can tell us," I said, gently.</p>

<p>She stared at me uncomprehendingly. She said, confusedly:</p>

<p>"I don't know... it became terribly still... I... thought I
saw something moving at the window... then there was a queer
fragrance and then I looked up to see you bending over me."</p>

<p>I asked: "Can you remember anything of what you saw at the
window? The least detail&mdash;the least impression. Please
try."</p>

<p>She answered, hesitantly: "There was something white... I
thought someone... something... was watching me... then came the
fragrance, like flowers... that's all."</p>

<p>Bill hung up the telephone: "All right, Doc. They're after
McCann. Now what?"</p>

<p>"Miss Butler," I turned to the nurse. "I'm going to relieve
you for the balance of the night. Go to bed. And I want you to
sleep. I prescribe-" I told her what.</p>

<p>"You're not angry&mdash;you don't think I've been careless-
"</p>

<p>"No, to both." I smiled and patted her shoulder. "The case has
taken an unexpected turn, that's all. Now don't ask any more
questions."</p>

<p>I walked with her to the door, opened it.</p>

<p>"Do exactly as I say."</p>

<p>I closed and locked the door behind her.</p>

<p>I sat beside Ricori. The shock that he had
experienced&mdash;whatever it might have been&mdash;should either
cure or kill, I thought grimly. As I watched him, a tremor went
through his body. Slowly an arm began to lift, fist clenched. His
lips moved. He spoke, in Italian and so swiftly that I could get
no word. His arm fell back. I stood up from the bed. The
paralysis had gone. He could move and speak. But would he be able
to do so when consciousness assumed sway? I left this for the
next few hours to decide I could do nothing else.</p>

<p>"Now listen to me carefully," I said to the two guards. "No
matter how strange what I am going to say will seem, you must
obey me in every detail! Ricori's life depends upon your doing
so. I want one of you to sit close beside me at the table here. I
want the other to sit beside Ricori, at the head or the bed and
between him and me. If I am asleep and he should awaken, arouse
me. If you see any change in his condition, immediately awaken
me. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>They said: "Okay."</p>

<p>"Very well. Now here is the most important thing of all. You
must watch me even more closely. Whichever of you sits beside me
must not take his eyes off me. If I should go to your chief it
would be to do one of three things only &mdash;listen to his
heart and breathing&mdash;lift his eyelids&mdash; take his
temperature. I mean, of course, if he should be as he now is. If
I seem to awaken and attempt to do anything other than these
three&mdash;stop me. If I resist, make me helpless&mdash;tie me
up and gag me&mdash;no, don't gag me&mdash;listen to me and
remember what I say. Then telephone to Dr. Braile&mdash;here is
his number."</p>

<p>I wrote, and passed it to them.</p>

<p>"Don't damage me any more than you can help," I said, and
laughed.</p>

<p>They stared at each other, plainly disconcerted. "If you say
so, Doc-" began the guard Bill, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I do say so. Do not hesitate. If you should be wrong, I'll
not hold it against you."</p>

<p>"The Doc knows what he's about, Bill," said the guard
Jack.</p>

<p>"Okay then," said Bill.</p>

<p>I turned out all the lights except that beside the nurse's
table. I stretched myself in her chair and adjusted the lamp so
my face could be plainly seen. That little white cap I had picked
from the floor had shaken me &mdash;damnably! I drew it out and
placed it in a drawer. The guard Jack took his station beside
Ricori. Bill drew up a chair, and sat facing me. I thrust my hand
into my pocket and clutched the knotted cord, closed my eyes,
emptied my mind of all thought, and relaxed. In abandoning, at
least temporarily, my conception of a sane universe I had
determined to give that of Madame Mandilip's every chance to
operate.</p>

<p>Faintly, I heard a clock strike one. I slept.</p>

<p>Somewhere a vast wind was roaring. It circled and swept down
upon me. It bore me away. I knew that I had no body, that indeed
I had no form. Yet I was. A formless sentience whirling in that
vast wind. It carried me into infinite distance. Bodiless,
intangible as I knew myself to be, yet it poured into me an
unearthly vitality. I roared with the wind in unhuman jubilance.
The vast wind circled and raced me back from immeasurable
space...</p>

<p>I seemed to awaken, that pulse of strange jubilance still
surging through me... Ah! There was what I must destroy... there
on the bed... must kill so that this pulse of jubilance would not
cease... must kill so that the vast wind would sweep me up again
and away and feed me with its life... but careful... careful...
there&mdash;there in the throat just under the ear... there is
where I must plunge it... then off with the wind again... there
where the pulse beats... what is holding me back?... caution...
caution, "I am going to take his temperature"... that's it,
careful, "I am going to take his temperature."... Now&mdash;one
quick spring, then into his throat where the pulse beats... "Not
with that you don't!"... Who said that?... still holding me...
rage, consuming and ruthless blackness and the sound of a vast
wind roaring away and away...</p>

<p>I heard a voice: "Slap him again, Bill, but not so hard. He's
coming around." I felt a stinging blow on my face. The dancing
mists cleared from before my eyes. I was standing halfway between
the nurse's table and Ricori's bed. The guard Jack held my arms
pinioned to my sides. The guard Bill's hand was still raised.
There was something clenched tightly in my own hand. I looked
down. It was a strong scalpel, razor-edged!</p>

<p>I dropped the scalpel. I said, quietly: "It's all right now,
you can release me."</p>

<p>The guard Bill said nothing. His comrade did not loose his
grip. I twisted my head and I saw that both their faces were
sallow white. I said:</p>

<p>"It was what I had expected. It was why I instructed you. It
is over. You can keep your guns on me if you like."</p>

<p>The guard who held me freed my arms. I touched my cheek
gingerly. I said mildly:</p>

<p>"You must have hit me rather hard, Bill."</p>

<p>He said: "If you could a seen your face, Doc, you'd wonder I
didn't smash it."</p>

<p>I nodded, clearly sensible now of the demonic quality of that
rage, I asked:</p>

<p>"What did I do?"</p>

<p>The guard Bill said: "You wake up and set there for a minute
staring at the chief. Then you take something out of that drawer
and get up. You say you're going to take his temperature. You're
half to him before we see what you got. I shout, 'Not with that
you don't!' Jack grabs you. Then you went crazy. And I had to
slam you. That's all."</p>

<p>I nodded again. I took out of my pocket the knotcord of
woman's pale hair, held it over a dish and touched a match to it.
It began to burn, writhing like a tiny snake as it did so, the
complex knots untying as the flame touched them. I dropped the
last inch of it upon the plate and watched it turn to ash.</p>

<p>"I think there'll be no more trouble tonight," I said. "But
keep up your watch just as before."</p>

<p>I dropped back into the chair and closed my eyes...</p>

<p>Well, Braile had not shown me a soul, but&mdash;I believed in
Madame Mandilip.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; A DOLL
KILLS</h2>

<p class="first">The balance of the night I slept soundly and
dreamlessly. I awakened at my usual hour of seven. The guards
were alert. I asked if anything had been heard from McCann, and
they answered no. I wondered a little at that, but they did not
seem to think it out of the ordinary. Their reliefs were soon
due, and I cautioned them to speak to no one but McCann about the
occurrences of the night, reminding them that no one would be
likely to believe them if they did. They assured me, earnestly,
that they would be silent. I told them that I wanted the guards
to remain within the room thereafter, as long as they were
necessary.</p>

<p>Examining Ricori, I found him sleeping deeply and naturally.
In all ways his condition was most satisfactory. I concluded that
the second shock, as sometimes happens, had, counteracted the
lingering effects of the initial one. When he awakened, he would
be able to speak and move. I gave this reassuring news to the
guards. I could see that they were bursting with questions. I
gave them no encouragement to ask them.</p>

<p>At eight, my day nurse for Ricori appeared, plainly much
surprised to have found Butler sleeping and to find me taking her
place. I made no explanation, simply telling her that the guards
would now be stationed within the room instead of outside the
door.</p>

<p>At eight-thirty, Braile dropped in on me for breakfast, and to
report. I let him finish before I apprised him of what had
happened. I said nothing, however, of the nurse's little cap, nor
of my own experience.</p>

<p>I assumed this reticence for well-considered reasons. One,
Braile would accept in its entirety the appalling deduction from
the cap's presence. I strongly suspected that he had been in love
with Walters, and that I would be unable to restrain him from
visiting the doll-maker. Usually hard-headed, he was in this
matter far too suggestible. It would be dangerous for him, and
his observations would be worthless to me. Second, if he knew of
my own experience, he would without doubt refuse to let me out of
his sight. Third, either of these contingencies would defeat my
own purpose, which was to interview Madame Mandilip entirely
alone&mdash;with the exception of McCann to keep watch outside
the shop.</p>

<p>What would come of that meeting I could not forecast. But,
obviously, it was the only way to retain my self-respect. To
admit that what had occurred was witchcraft, sorcery,
supernatural&mdash;was to surrender to superstition. Nothing can
be supernatural. If anything exists, it must exist in obedience
to natural laws. Material bodies must obey material laws. We may
not know those laws&mdash;but they exist nevertheless. If Madame
Mandilip possessed knowledge of an unknown science, it behooved
me as an exemplar of known science, to find out what I could
about the other. Especially as I had recently responded so
thoroughly to it. That I had been able to outguess her in her
technique&mdash;if it had been that, and not a self-induced
illusion &mdash;gave me a pleasant feeling of confidence. At any
rate, meet her I must.</p>

<p>It happened to be one of my days for consultation, so I could
not get away until after two. I asked Braile to take charge of
matters after that, for a few hours.</p>

<p>Close to ten the nurse telephoned that Ricori was awake, that
he was able to speak and had been asking for me.</p>

<p>He smiled at me as I entered the room. As I leaned over and
took his wrist he said:</p>

<p>"I think you have saved more than my life, Dr. Lowell! Ricori
thanks you. He will never forget!"</p>

<p>A bit florid, but thoroughly in character. It showed that his
mind was functioning normally. I was relieved.</p>

<p>"We'll have you up in a jiffy." I patted his hand.</p>

<p>He whispered: "Have there been any more deaths?"</p>

<p>I had been wondering whether he had retained any recollection
of the affair of the night. I answered:</p>

<p>"No. But you have lost much strength since McCann brought you
here. I don't want you to do much talking today." I added,
casually: "No, nothing has happened. Oh, yes&mdash;you fell out
of bed this morning. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>He glanced at the guards and then back at me. He said:</p>

<p>"I am weak. Very weak. You must make me strong quickly."</p>

<p>"We'll have you sitting up in two days, Ricori."</p>

<p>"In less than two days I must be up and out. There is a thing
I must do. It cannot wait."</p>

<p>I did not want him to become excited. I abandoned any
intention of asking what had happened in the car. I said,
incisively:</p>

<p>"That will depend entirely upon you. You must not excite
yourself. You must do as I tell you. I am going to leave you now,
to give orders for your nutrition. Also, I want your guards to
remain in this room."</p>

<p>He said: "And still you tell me&mdash;nothing has
happened."</p>

<p>"I don't intend to have anything happen." I leaned over him
and whispered: "McCann has guards around the Mandilip woman. She
cannot run away."</p>

<p>He said: "But her servitors are more efficient than mine, Dr.
Lowell!"</p>

<p>I looked at him sharply. His eyes were inscrutable. I went
back to my office, deep in thought. What did Ricori know?</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock McCann called me on the telephone. I was so
glad to hear from him that I was angry.</p>

<p>"Where on earth have you been-" I began.</p>

<p>"Listen, Doc. I'm at Mollie's&mdash;Peters' sister," he
interrupted. "Come here quick."</p>

<p>The peremptory demand added to my irritation. "Not now," I
answered. "These are my office hours. I will not be free until
two."</p>

<p>"Can't you break away? Something's happened. I don't know what
to do!" There was desperation in his voice.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you over-" His voice steadied, grew gentle; I
heard him say, "Be quiet, Mollie. It can't do no good!" Then to
me&mdash;"Well, come as soon as you can, Doc. I'll wait. Take the
address." Then when he had given it to me, I heard him again
speaking to another&mdash;"Quit it, Mollie! I ain't going to
leave you."</p>

<p>He hung up, abruptly. I went back to my chair, troubled. He
had not asked me about Ricori. That in itself was disquieting.
Mollie? Peters' sister, of course! Was it that she had learned of
her brother's death, and suffered collapse? I recalled that
Ricori had said she was soon to be a mother. No, I felt that
McCann's panic had been due to something more than that. I became
more and more uneasy. I looked over my appointments. There were
no important ones. Coming to sudden determination, I told my
secretary to call up and postpone them. I ordered my car, and set
out for the address McCann had given me.</p>

<p>McCann met me at the door of the apartment. His face was drawn
and his eyes haunted. He drew me within without a word, and led
me through the hall. I passed an open door and glimpsed a woman
with a sobbing child in her arms. He took me into a bedroom and
pointed to the bed.</p>

<p>There was a man lying on it, covers pulled up to his chin. I
went over to him, looked down upon him, touched him. The man was
dead. He had been dead for hours. McCann said:</p>

<p>"Mollie's husband. Look him over like you done the boss."</p>

<p>I had a curiously unpleasant sense of being turned on a
potter's wheel by some inexorable hand&mdash;from Peters, to
Walters, to Ricori, to the body before me. Would the wheel stop
there?</p>

<p>I stripped the dead man. I took from my bag a magnifying glass
and probes. I went over the body inch by inch, beginning at the
region of the heart. Nothing there nothing anywhere... I turned
the body over...</p>

<p>At once, at the base of the skull, I saw a minute
puncture.</p>

<p>I took a fine probe and inserted it. The probe&mdash;and again
I had that feeling of infinite repetition&mdash;slipped into the
puncture. I manipulated it, gently.</p>

<p>Something like a long thin needle had been thrust into that
vital spot just where the spinal cord connects with the brain. By
accident, or perhaps because the needle had been twisted savagely
to tear the nerve paths, there had been paralysis of respiration
and almost instant death.</p>

<p>I withdrew the probe and turned to McCann.</p>

<p>"This man has been murdered," I said. "Killed by the same kind
of weapon with which Ricori was attacked. But whoever did it made
a better job. He'll never come to life again as Ricori did."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" said McCann, quietly. "An' me an' Paul was the only
ones with Ricori when it happened. An' the only ones here with
this man, Doc, was his wife an' baby! Now what're you going to do
about that? Say those two put him on the spot&mdash;like you
thought we done the boss?"</p>

<p>I said: "What do you know about this, McCann? And how did you
come to be here so&mdash;opportunely?"</p>

<p>He answered, patiently: "I wasn't here when he was
killed&mdash;if that's what you're getting at. If you want to
know the time, it was two o'clock. Mollie got me on the 'phone
about an hour ago an' I come straight up."</p>

<p>"She had better luck than I had," I said, dryly. "Ricori's
people have been trying to get hold of you since one o'clock last
night."</p>

<p>"I know. But I didn't know it till just before Mollie called
me. I was on my way to see you. An' if you want to know what I
was doing all night, I'll tell you. I was out on the boss's
business, an' yours. For one thing trying to find out where that
hell-cat niece keeps her coupe. I found out&mdash; too late."</p>

<p>"But the men who were supposed to be watching-"</p>

<p>"Listen, Doc, won't you talk to Mollie now?" he interrupted
me, "I'm afraid for her. It's only what I told her about you an'
that you was coming that's kept her up."</p>

<p>"Take me to her," I said, abruptly.</p>

<p>We went into the room where I had seen the woman and the
sobbing child. The woman was not more than twenty-seven or -
eight, I judged, and in ordinary circumstances would have been
unusually attractive. Now her face was drawn and bloodless, in
her eyes horror, and a fear on the very borderline of madness.
She stared at me, vacantly; she kept rubbing her lips with the
tips of her forefingers, staring at me with those eyes out of
which looked a mind emptied of everything but fear and grief. The
child, a girl of no more than four, kept up her incessant
sobbing. McCann shook the woman by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Snap out of it, Mollie," he said, roughly, but pityingly,
too. "Here's the Doc."</p>

<p>The woman became aware of me, abruptly. She looked at me
steadily for slow moments, then asked, less like one questioning
than one relinquishing a last thin thread of hope:</p>

<p>"He is dead?"</p>

<p>She read the answer in my face. She cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, Johnnie&mdash;Johnnie Boy! Dead!"</p>

<p>She took the child up in her arms. She said to it, almost
tranquilly: "Johnnie Boy has gone away, darling. Daddy has had to
go away. Don't cry, darling, we'll soon see him!"</p>

<p>I wished she would break down, weep; but that deep fear which
never left her eyes was too strong; it blocked all normal outlets
of sorrow. Not much longer, I realized, could her mind stand up
under that tension.</p>

<p>"McCann," I whispered, "say something, do something to her
that will arouse her. Make her violently angry, or make her cry.
I don't care which."</p>

<p>He nodded. He snatched the child from her arms and thrust it
behind him. He leaned, his face close to the woman's. He said,
brutally:</p>

<p>"Come clean, Mollie! Why did you kill John?"</p>

<p>For a moment the woman stood, uncomprehending. Then a tremor
shook her. The fear vanished from her eyes and fury took its
place. She threw herself upon McCann, fists beating at his face.
He caught her, pinioned her arms. The child screamed.</p>

<p>The woman's body relaxed, her arms fell to her sides. She
crumpled to the floor, her head bent over her knees. And tears
came. McCann would have lifted, comforted her. I stopped him.</p>

<p>"Let her cry. It's the best thing for her."</p>

<p>And after a little while she looked up at McCann and said,
shakily:</p>

<p>"You didn't mean that, Dan?"</p>

<p>He said: "No, I know you didn't do it, Mollie. But now you've
got to talk to the Doc. There's a lot to be done."</p>

<p>She asked, normally enough now: "Do you want to question me,
Doctor? Or shall I just go on and tell you what happened?"</p>

<p>McCann said: "Tell him the way you told me. Begin with the
doll."</p>

<p>I said: "That's right. You tell me your story. If I've any
questions, I'll ask them when you are done."</p>

<p>She began:</p>

<p>"Yesterday afternoon Dan, here, came and took me out for a
ride. Usually John does not... did not get home until about six.
But yesterday he was worried about me and came home early, around
three. He likes... he liked... Dan, and urged me to go. It was a
little after six when I returned.</p>

<p>"'A present came for the kid while you were out, Mollie,' he
said. 'It's another doll. I'll bet Tom sent it.' Tom is my
brother.</p>

<p>"There was a big box on the table, and I lifted the lid. In it
was the most life-like doll imaginable. A perfect thing. A little
girl-doll. Not a baby-doll, but a doll like a child about ten or
twelve years old. Dressed like a schoolgirl, with her books
strapped, and over her shoulder&mdash; only about a foot high,
but perfect. The sweetest face&mdash;a face like a little angel.
John said: 'It was addressed to you, Mollie, but I thought it was
flowers and opened it. Looks as though it could talk, doesn't it?
I'll bet it's what they call a portrait-doll. Some kid posed for
that, all right.' At that, I was sure Tom had sent it, because he
had given little Mollie one doll before, and a friend of mine
who's... whose dead... gave her one from the same place, and she
told me the woman who made the dolls had gotten her to pose for
one. So putting this together, I knew Tom had gone and gotten
little Mollie another. But I asked John: 'Wasn't there a note or
a card or anything in it?' He said, 'No&mdash;oh, yes, there was
one funny thing. Where is it? I must have stuck it in my
pocket.'</p>

<p>"He hunted around in his pockets and brought out a cord. It
had knots in it, and it looked as if it was made of hair. I said,
'Wonder what Tom's idea was in that?' John put it back in his
pocket, and I thought nothing more about it.</p>

<p>"Little Mollie was asleep. We put the doll beside her where
she could see it when she woke up. When she did, she was in
raptures over it. We had dinner, and Mollie played with the doll.
After we put her to bed I wanted to take it away from her, but
she cried so we let her go to sleep with it. We played cards
until eleven, and then made ready for bed.</p>

<p>"Mollie is apt to be restless, and she still sleeps in a low
crib so she can't fall out. The crib is in our bedroom, in the
corner beside one of the two windows. Between the two windows is
my dressing table, and our bed is set with its head against the
wall opposite the windows. We both stopped and looked at Mollie,
as we always do... did. She was sound asleep with the doll
clasped in one arm, its head on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"John said: 'Lord, Mollie&mdash;that doll looks as alive as
the baby! You wouldn't be surprised to see it get up and walk.
Whoever posed for it was some sweet kid.'</p>

<p>"And that was true. It had the sweetest, gentlest little
face... and oh, Dr. Lowell... that's what helps make it so
dreadful... so utterly dreadful... "</p>

<p>I saw the fear begin to creep back into her eyes.</p>

<p>McCann said: "Buck up, Mollie!"</p>

<p>"I tried to take the doll. It was so lovely I was afraid the
baby might roll on it or damage it some way," she went on again
quietly, "but she held it fast, and I did not want to awaken her.
So I let it be. While we were undressing, John took the knotted
cord out of his pocket.</p>

<p>"'That's a funny looking bunch of knots,' he said. 'When you
hear from Tom ask him what it's for.' He tossed the cord on the
little table at his side of the bed. It wasn't long before he was
asleep. And then I went asleep too.</p>

<p>"And then I woke up... or thought I did... for if I was awake
or dreaming I don't know. I must have been a dream&mdash;and
yet... Oh, God, John is dead... I heard him die..."</p>

<p>Again, for a little time, the tears flowed. Then:</p>

<p>"If I was awake, it must have been the stillness that awakened
me. And yet &mdash;it is what makes me feel I must have been
dreaming. There couldn't be such silence... except in a dream. We
are on the second floor, and always there is some sound from the
street. There wasn't the least sound now... it was as though...
as though the whole world had suddenly been stricken dumb. I
thought I sat up, listening... listening thirstily for the
tiniest of noises. I could not even hear John breathing. I was
frightened, for there was something dreadful in that stillness.
Something living! Something wicked! I tried to lean over to John,
tried to touch him, to awaken him.</p>

<p>"I could not move! I could not stir a finger! I tried to
speak, to cry out. I could not!</p>

<p>"The window curtains were partly drawn. A faint light showed
beneath and around them from the street. Suddenly this was
blotted out. The room was dark &mdash;utterly dark.</p>

<p>"And then the green glow began -</p>

<p>"At first it was the dimmest gleam. It did not come from
outside. It was in the room itself. It would flicker and dim,
flicker and dim. But always after each dimming it was brighter.
It was green like the light of the firefly. Or like looking at
moonlight through clear green water. At last the green glow
became steady. It was like light, and still it wasn't light. It
wasn't brilliant. It was just glowing. And it was
everywhere&mdash;under the dressing table, under the chairs... I
mean it cast no shadows. I could see everything in the bedroom. I
could see the baby asleep in her crib, the doll's head on her
shoulder...</p>

<p>"The doll moved!</p>

<p>"It turned its head, and seemed to listen to the baby's
breathing. It put its little hands upon the baby's arm. The arm
dropped away from it.</p>

<p>"The doll sat up!</p>

<p>"And now I was sure that I must be dreaming the strange
silence the strange green glow... and this...</p>

<p>"The doll clambered over the side of the crib, and dropped to
the floor. It came skipping over the floor toward the bed like a
child, swinging its school books by their strap. It turned its
head from side to side as it came, looking around the room like a
curious child. It caught sight of the dressing table, and
stopped, looking up at the mirror. It climbed up the chair in
front of the dressing table. It jumped from the chair seat to the
table, tossed its books aside and began to admire itself in the
mirror.</p>

<p>"It preened itself. It turned and looked at itself, first over
this shoulder and then over that. I thought: 'What a queer
fantastic dream!' It thrust its face close to the mirror and
rearranged and patted its hair. I thought: 'What a vain little
doll!' And then I thought: 'I'm dreaming all this because John
said the doll was so life-like he wouldn't be surprised to see it
walk.' And then I thought: 'But I can't be dreaming, or I
wouldn't be trying to account for what I'm dreaming!' And then it
all seemed so absurd that I laughed. I knew I had made no sound.
I knew I couldn't... that the laugh was inside me. But it was as
though the doll had heard me. It turned and looked straight at me
-</p>

<p>"My heart seemed to die within me. I've had nightmares, Dr.
Lowell&mdash; but never in the worst of them did I feel as I did
when the doll's eyes met mine...</p>

<p>"They were the eyes of a devil! They shone red. I mean they
were&mdash; were&mdash;luminous... like some animal's eyes in the
dark. But it was the &mdash;the&mdash;hellishness in them that
made me feel as though a hand had gripped my heart! Those eyes
from hell in that face like one of God's own angels...</p>

<p>"I don't know how long it stood there, glaring at me. But at
last it swung itself down and sat on the edge of the dressing
table, legs swinging like a child's and still with its eyes on
mine. Then slowly, deliberately, it lifted its little arm and
reached behind its neck. Just as slowly it brought its arm back.
In its hand was a long pin... like a dagger...</p>

<p>"It dropped from the dressing table to the floor. It skipped
toward me and was hidden by the bottom of the bed. An instant and
it had clambered up the bed and stood, still looking at me with
those red eyes, at John's feet.</p>

<p>"I tried to cry out, tried to move, tried to arouse John. I
prayed&mdash; 'Oh, God, wake him up! Dear God&mdash;wake
him!'</p>

<p>"The doll looked away from me. It stood there, looking at
John. It began to creep along his body, up toward his head. I
tried to move my hand, to follow it. I could not. The doll passed
out of my sight...</p>

<p>"I heard a dreadful, sobbing groan. I felt John shudder, then
stretch and twist... I heard him sigh...</p>

<p>"Deep deep down... I knew John was dying... and I could do
nothing... in the silence in the green glow...</p>

<p>"I heard something like the note of a flute, from the street,
beyond the windows. There was a tiny scurrying. I saw the doll
skip across the floor and spring up to the windowsill. It knelt
there for a moment, looking out into the street. It held
something in its hand. And then I saw that what it held was the
knotted cord John had thrown on his table.</p>

<p>"I heard the flute note again... the doll swung itself out of
the window... I had a glimpse of its red eyes... I saw its little
hands clutching the sill... and it was gone...</p>

<p>"The green glow... blinked and... went out. The light from the
street returned around the curtains. The silence seemed...
seemed... to be sucked away.</p>

<p>"And then something like a wave of darkness swept over me. I
went down under it. Before it swept over me I heard the clock
strike two.</p>

<p>"When I awakened again... or came out of my faint... or, if it
was just a dream, when I awakened... I turned to John. He lay
there... so still! I touched him... he was cold... so cold! I
knew he was dead!</p>

<p>"Dr. Lowell... tell me what was dream and what was real? I
know that no doll could have killed John!</p>

<p>"Did he reach out to me when he was dying, and did the dream
come from that? Or did I... dreaming... kill him?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; TECHNIQUE OF
MADAME MANDILIP</h2>

<p class="first">There was an agony in her eyes that forbade the
truth, so I lied to her.</p>

<p>"I can comfort you as to that, at least. Your husband died of
entirely natural causes&mdash;from a blood clot in the brain. My
examination satisfied me thoroughly as to that. You had nothing
to do with it. As for the doll&mdash;you had an unusually vivid
dream, that is all."</p>

<p>She looked at me as one who would give her soul to believe.
She said:</p>

<p>"But I heard him die!"</p>

<p>"It is quite possible-" I plunged into a somewhat technical
explanation which I knew she would not quite understand, but
would, perhaps, be therefore convincing&mdash;"You may have been
half-awake&mdash;on what we term the borderline of waking
consciousness. In all probability the entire dream was suggested
by what you heard. Your subconsciousness tried to explain the
sounds, and conceived the whole fantastic drama you have recited
to me. What seemed, in your dream, to take up many minutes
actually passed through your mind in a split second&mdash;the
subconsciousness makes its own time. It is a common experience. A
door slams, or there is some other abrupt and violent sound. It
awakens the sleeper. When he is fully awake he has recollection
of some singularly vivid dream which ended with a loud noise. In
reality, his dream began with the noise. The dream may have
seemed to him to have taken hours. It was, in fact, almost
instantaneous, taking place in the brief moment between noise and
awakening."</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath; her eyes lost some of their agony. I
pressed my advantage.</p>

<p>"And there is another thing you must remember&mdash;your
condition. It makes many women peculiarly subject to realistic
dreams, usually of an unpleasant character. Sometimes even to
hallucinations."</p>

<p>She whispered: "That is true. When little Mollie was coming I
had the most dreadful dreams-"</p>

<p>She hesitated; I saw doubt again cloud her face.</p>

<p>"But the doll&mdash;the doll is gone!" she said.</p>

<p>I cursed to myself at that, caught unawares and with no ready
answer. But McCann had one. He said, easily:</p>

<p>"Sure it's gone, Mollie. I dropped it down the chute into the
waste. After what you told me I thought you'd better not see it
any more."</p>

<p>She asked, sharply:</p>

<p>"Where did you find it? I looked for it."</p>

<p>"Guess you weren't in shape to do much looking," he answered.
"I found it down at the foot of the kid's crib, all messed up in
the covers. It was busted. Looked like the kid had been dancing
on it in her sleep."</p>

<p>She said hesitantly: "It might have slipped down. I don't
think I looked there-"</p>

<p>I said, severely, so she might not suspect collusion between
McCann and myself:</p>

<p>"You ought not to have done that, McCann. If you had shown the
doll to her, Mrs. Gilmore would have known at once that she had
been dreaming and she would have been spared much pain."</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't a doctor." His voice was sullen. "I done what I
thought best."</p>

<p>"Go down and see if you can find it," I ordered, tartly. He
glanced at me sharply. I nodded&mdash;and hoped he understood. In
a few minutes he returned.</p>

<p>"They cleaned out the waste only fifteen minutes ago," he
reported, lugubriously. "The doll went with it. I found this,
though."</p>

<p>He held up a little strap from which dangled a half-dozen
miniature books. He asked:</p>

<p>"Was them what you dreamed the doll dropped on the dressing
table, Mollie?"</p>

<p>She stared, and shrank away.</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered. "Please put it away, Dan. I don't want
to see it."</p>

<p>He looked at me, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I guess maybe I was right at that when I threw the doll away,
Doc."</p>

<p>I said: "At any rate, now that Mrs. Gilmore is satisfied it
was all a dream, there's no harm done."</p>

<p>"And now," I took her cold hands in mine. "I'm going to
prescribe for you. I don't want you to stay in this place a
moment longer than you can help. I want you to pack a bag with
whatever you and little Mollie may need for a week or so, and
leave at once. I am thinking of your condition&mdash;and a little
life that is on its way. I will attend to all the necessary
formalities. You can instruct McCann as to the other details. But
I want you to go. Will you do this?"</p>

<p>To my relief, she assented readily. There was a somewhat
harrowing moment when she and the child bade farewell to the
body. But before many minutes she was on her way with McCann to
relations. The child had wanted to take "the boy and girl dolls."
I had refused to allow this, even at the risk of again arousing
the mother's suspicions. I wanted nothing of Madame Mandilip to
accompany them to their refuge. McCann supported me, and the
dolls were left behind.</p>

<p>I called an undertaker whom I knew. I made a last examination
of the body. The minute puncture would not be noticed, I was
sure. There was no danger of an autopsy, since my certification
of the cause of death would not be questioned. When the
undertaker arrived I explained the absence of the wife
&mdash;imminent maternity and departure at my order. I set down
the cause of death as thrombosis&mdash;rather grimly as I
recalled the similar diagnosis of the banker's physician, and
what I had thought of it.</p>

<p>After the body had been taken away, and as I sat waiting for
McCann to return, I tried to orient myself to this phantasmagoria
through which, it seemed to me, I had been moving for endless
time. I tried to divest my mind of all prejudice, all
preconceived ideas of what could and could not be. I began by
conceding that this Madame Mandilip might possess some wisdom of
which modern science is ignorant. I refused to call it witchcraft
or sorcery. The words mean nothing, since they have been applied
through the ages to entirely natural phenomena whose causes were
not understood by the laity. Not so long ago, for example, the
lighting of a match was "witchcraft" to many savage tribes.</p>

<p>No, Madame Mandilip was no "witch," as Ricori thought her. She
was mistress of some unknown science&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>And being a science, it must be governed by fixed
laws&mdash;unknown though those laws might be to me. If the doll-
maker's activities defied cause and effect, as I conceived them,
still they must conform to laws of cause and effect of their own.
There was nothing supernatural about them&mdash;it was only that,
like the savages, I did not know what made the match burn.
Something of these laws, something of the woman's
technique&mdash;using the word as signifying the details,
collectively considered, of mechanical performance in any
art&mdash;I thought I perceived. The knotted cord, "the witch's
ladder," apparently was an essential in the animation of the
dolls. One had been slipped into Ricori's pocket before the first
attack upon him. I had found another beside his bed after the
disturbing occurrences of the night. I had gone to sleep holding
one of the cords&mdash;and had tried to murder my patient! A
third cord had accompanied the doll that had killed John
Gilmore.</p>

<p>Clearly, then, the cord was a part of the formula for the
direction of control of the dolls.</p>

<p>Against this was the fact that the intoxicated stroller could
not have been carrying one of the "ladders" when attacked by the
Peters doll.</p>

<p>It might be, however, that the cord had only to do with the
initial activity of the puppets; that once activated, their
action might continue for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>There was evidence of a fixed formula in the making of the
dolls. First, it seemed, the prospective victim's free consent to
serve as model must be obtained; second, a wound which gave the
opportunity to apply the salve which caused the unknown death;
third, the doll must be a faithful replica of the victim. That
the agency of death was the same in each case was proven by the
similar symptoms.</p>

<p>But did those deaths actually have anything to do with the
motility of the dolls? Were they actually a necessary part of the
operation?</p>

<p>The doll-maker might believe so; indeed, undoubtedly did
believe so.</p>

<p>I did not.</p>

<p>That the doll which had stabbed Ricori had been made in the
semblance of Peters; that the "nurse doll" which the guards had
seen poised on my window-ledge might have been the one for which
Walters had posed; that the doll which had thrust the pin into
Gilmore's brain was, perhaps, the replica of little Anita, the
eleven-year-old schoolgirl&mdash;all this I admitted.</p>

<p>But that anything of Peters, anything of Walters, anything of
Anita had animated these dolls... that dying, something of their
vitality, their minds, their "souls" had been drawn from them,
had been transmuted into an essence of evil, and imprisoned in
these wire-skeletoned puppets... against this all my reason
revolted. I could not force my mind to accept even the
possibility.</p>

<p>My analysis was interrupted by the return of McCann.</p>

<p>He said, laconically: "Well, we put it over."</p>

<p>I asked. "McCann&mdash;you weren't by any chance telling the
truth when you said you found the doll?"</p>

<p>"No, Doc. The doll was gone all right."</p>

<p>"But where did you get the little books?"</p>

<p>"Just where Mollie said the doll tossed 'em&mdash;on her
dressing table. I snaked 'em after she'd told me her story. She
hadn't noticed 'em. I had a hunch. It was a good one, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"You had me wondering," I replied. "I don't know what we could
have said if she had asked for the knotted cord."</p>

<p>"The cord didn't seem to make much of a dent on her-" He
hesitated. "But I think it means a hell of a lot, Doc. I think if
I hadn't took her out, and John hadn't happened home, and Mollie
had opened the box instead of him &mdash;I think it's Mollie he'd
have found lying dead beside him."</p>

<p>"You mean-"</p>

<p>"I mean the dolls go for whichever gets the cords," he said
somberly.</p>

<p>Well, it was much the same thought I had in my own mind.</p>

<p>I asked: "But why should anybody want to kill Mollie?"</p>

<p>"Maybe somebody thinks she knows too much. And that brings me
to what I've been wanting to tell you. The Mandilip hag knows
she's being watched!"</p>

<p>"Well, her watchers are better than ours." I echoed Ricori;
and I told McCann then of the second attack in the night; and why
I had sought him.</p>

<p>"An' that," he said when I had ended, "Proves the Mandilip hag
knows who's who behind the watch on her. She tried to wipe out
both the boss and Mollie. She's onto us, Doc."</p>

<p>"The dolls are accompanied," I said. "The musical note is a
summons. They do not disappear into thin air. They answer the
note and make their way... somehow to whoever sounds the note.
The dolls must be taken from the shop. Therefore one of the two
women must take them. How did they evade your watchers?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." The lean face was worried. "The fish-white gal
does it. Let me tell you what I found out, Doc. After I left you
last night I go down to see what the boys have to say. I hear
plenty. They say about four o'clock the gal goes in the back an'
the old woman takes a chair in the store. They don't think
nothing of that. But about seven who do they see walking down the
street and into the doll joint but the gal. They give the boys in
the back hell. But they ain't seen her go, an' they pass the buck
to the boys in front.</p>

<p>"Then about eleven o'clock one of the relief lads comes in
with worse news. He says he's down at the foot of Broadway when a
coupe turns the corner an' driving it is the gal. He can't be
mistaken because he's seen her in the doll joint. She goes up
Broadway at a clip. He sees there ain't nobody trailing her, an'
he looks around for a taxi. Course there's nothing in sight
&mdash;not even a parked car he can lift. So he comes down to the
gang to ask what the hell they mean by it. An' again nobody's
seen the gal go."</p>

<p>"I take a couple of the boys an' we start out to comb the
neighborhood to find out where she stables the coupe. We don't
have no luck at all until about four o'clock when one of the
tails&mdash;one of the lads who's been looking&mdash;meets up
with me. He says that about three he sees the gal &mdash;at least
he thinks it's the gal&mdash;walking along the street around the
corner from the joint. She's got a coupla big suitcases but they
don't seem to trouble her none. She's walking quick. But away
from the doll joint. He eases over to get a better look, when all
of a sudden she ain't there. He sniffs around the place he's seen
her. There ain't hide nor hair of her. It's pretty dark, an' he
tries the doors an' the areaways, but the doors are locked an'
there ain't nobody in the areaways. So he gives it up an' hunts
me.</p>

<p>"I look over the place. It's about a third down the block
around the corner from the doll joint. The doll joint is eight
numbers from the corner. They're mostly shops an' I guess storage
up above. Not many people living there. The houses all old ones.
Still, I don't see how the gal can get to the doll joint. I think
maybe the tail's mistaken. He's seen somebody else, or just
thinks he's seen somebody. But we scout close around, an' after a
while we see a place that looks like it might stable a car. It
don't take us long to open the doors. An' sure enough, there's a
coupe with its engine still hot. It ain't been in long. Also it's
the same kind of coupe the lad who's seen the gal says she was
driving.</p>

<p>"I lock the place up again, an' go back to the boys. I watch
with 'em the rest of the night. Not a light in the doll joint.
But nigh eight o'clock, the gal shows up inside the shop and
opens up!"</p>

<p>"Still," I said at this point, "you have no real evidence she
had been out. The girl your man thought he saw might not have
been she at all."</p>

<p>He looked at me pityingly.</p>

<p>"She got out in the afternoon without 'em seeing her, didn't
she? What's to keep her from doing the same thing at night? The
lad saw her driving a coupe, didn't he? An' we find a coupe like
it close where the wench dropped out of sight."</p>

<p>I sat thinking. There was no reason to disbelieve McCann. And
there was a sinister coincidence in the hours the girl had been
seen. I said, half-aloud:</p>

<p>"The time she was out in the afternoon coincides with the time
the doll was left at the Gilmores'. The time she was out at night
coincides with the time of the attack upon Ricori, and the death
of John Gilmore."</p>

<p>"You hit it plumb in the eye!" said McCann. "She goes an'
leaves the doll at Mollie's, an' comes back. She goes an' sets
the dolls on the boss. She waits for 'em to pop out. Then she
goes an' collects the one she's left at Mollie's. Then she beats
it back home. They're in the suitcases she's carrying."</p>

<p>I could not hold back the irritation of helpless mystification
that swept me.</p>

<p>"And I suppose you think she got out of the house by riding a
broomstick up the chimney," I said, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, seriously. "No, I don't, Doc. But them
houses are old, and I think maybe there's a rat hole of a passage
or something she gets through. Anyway, the hands are watching the
street an' the coupe stable now, an' she can't pull that
again."</p>

<p>He added, morosely:</p>

<p>"At that, I ain't saying she couldn't bridle a broomstick if
she had to."</p>

<p>I said, abruptly: "McCann, I'm going down to talk to this
Madame Mandilip. I want you to come with me."</p>

<p>He said: "I'll be right beside you, Doc. With my fingers on my
guns."</p>

<p>I said: "No, I'm going to see her alone. But I want you to
keep close watch outside."</p>

<p>He did not like that; argued; at last reluctantly
assented.</p>

<p>I called up my office. I talked to Braile and learned that
Ricori was recovering with astonishing rapidity. I asked Braile
to look after things the balance of the day, inventing a
consultation to account for the request. I had myself switched to
Ricori's room. I had the nurse tell him that McCann was with me,
that we were making an investigation along a certain line, the
results of which I would inform him on my return, and that,
unless Ricori objected, I wanted McCann to stay with me the
balance of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Ricori sent back word that McCann should follow my orders as
though they were his own. He wanted to speak to me, but that I
did not want. Pleading urgent haste, I rang off.</p>

<p>I ate an excellent and hearty lunch. I felt that it would help
me hold tighter to the realities&mdash;or what I thought were the
realities&mdash; when I met this apparent mistress of illusions.
McCann was oddly silent and preoccupied.</p>

<p>The clock was striking three when I set off to meet Madame
Mandilip.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; MADAME
MANDILIP</h2>

<p class="first">I stood at the window of the doll-maker's shop,
mastering a stubborn revulsion against entering. I knew McCann
was on guard. I knew that Ricori's men were watching from the
houses opposite, that others moved among the passersby. Despite
the roaring clatter of the elevated trains, the bustle of traffic
along the Battery, the outwardly normal life of the street, the
doll-maker's shop was a beleaguered fortress. I stood, shivering
on its threshold, as though at the door of an unknown world.</p>

<p>There were only a few dolls displayed in the window, but they
were unusual enough to catch the eyes of a child or a grown-up.
Not so beautiful as that which had been given Walters, nor those
two I had seen at the Gilmores', but admirable lures,
nevertheless. The light inside the shop was subdued. I could see
a slender girl moving at a counter. The niece of Madame Mandilip,
no doubt. Certainly the size of the shop did not promise any such
noble chamber behind it as Walters had painted in her diary.
Still, the houses were old, and the back might extend beyond the
limits of the shop itself.</p>

<p>Abruptly and impatiently I ceased to temporize.</p>

<p>I opened the door and walked in.</p>

<p>The girl turned as I entered. She watched me as I came toward
the counter. She did not speak. I studied her, swiftly. An
hysterical type, obviously; one of the most perfect I had ever
seen. I took note of the prominent pale blue eyes with their
vague gaze and distended pupils; the long and slender neck and
slightly rounded features; the pallor and the long thin fingers.
Her hands were clasped, and I could see that these were unusually
flexible &mdash;thus carrying out to the last jot the Laignel-
Lavastine syndrome of the hysteric. In another time and other
circumstances she would have been a priestess, voicing oracles,
or a saint.</p>

<p>Fear was her handmaiden. There could be no doubt of that. And
yet I was sure it was not of me she was frightened. Rather was it
some deep and alien fear which lay coiled at the roots of her
being, sapping her vitality&mdash; a spiritual fear. I looked at
her hair. It was a silvery ash... the color... the color of the
hair that formed the knotted cords!</p>

<p>As she saw me staring at her hair, the vagueness in her pale
eyes diminished, was replaced by alertness. For the first time
she seemed to be aware of me. I said, with the utmost
casualness:</p>

<p>"I was attracted by the dolls in your window. I have a little
granddaughter who would like one I think."</p>

<p>"The dolls are for sale. If there is one you fancy, you may
buy it. At its price."</p>

<p>Her voice was low-pitched, almost whispering, indifferent. But
I thought the intentness in her eyes sharpened.</p>

<p>"I suppose," I answered, feigning something of irritation,
"that is what any chance customer may do. But it happens that
this child is a favorite of mine and for her I want the best.
Would it be too much trouble to show me what other, and perhaps
better, dolls you may have?"</p>

<p>Her eyes wavered for a moment. I had the thought that she was
listening to some sound I could not hear. Abruptly her manner
lost its indifference, became gracious. And at that exact moment
I felt other eyes upon me, studying me, searching me. So strong
was the impression that, involuntarily, I turned and peered about
the shop. There was no one except the girl and me. A door was at
the counter's end, but it was lightly closed. I shot a glance at
the window to see whether McCann was staring in. No one was
there.</p>

<p>Then, like the clicking of a camera shutter, the unseen gaze
was gone. I turned back to the girl. She had spread a half-dozen
boxes on the counter and was opening them. She looked up at me,
candidly, almost sweetly. She said:</p>

<p>"Why, of course you may see all that we have. I am sorry if
you thought me indifferent to your desires. My aunt, who makes
the dolls, loves children. She would not willingly allow one who
also loves them to go from here disappointed."</p>

<p>It was a curious little speech, oddly stilted, enunciated half
as though she were reciting from dictation. Yet it was not that
which aroused my interest so much as the subtle change that had
taken place in the girl herself. Her voice was no longer languid.
It held a vital vibrancy. Nor was she the lifeless, listless
person she had been. She was animated, even a touch of
vivaciousness about her; color had crept into her face and all
vagueness gone from her eyes; in them was a sparkle, faintly
mocking, more than faintly malicious.</p>

<p>I examined the dolls.</p>

<p>"They are lovely," I said at last. "But are these the best you
have? Frankly, this is rather an especial occasion&mdash;my
granddaughter's seventh birthday. The price doesn't really matter
as long, of course, as it is in reason-"</p>

<p>I heard her sigh. I looked at her. The pale eyes held their
olden fear-touched stare, all sparkling mockery gone. The color
had fled her face. And again, abruptly, I felt the unseen gaze
upon me, more powerfully than before. And again I felt it
shuttered off.</p>

<p>The door beside the counter opened.</p>

<p>Prepared though I had been for the extraordinary by Walters'
description of the doll-maker, her appearance gave me a distinct
shock. Her height, her massiveness, were amplified by the
proximity of the dolls and the slender figure of the girl. It was
a giantess who regarded me from the doorway &mdash;a giantess
whose heavy face with its broad, high cheek bones, mustached
upper lip and thick mouth produced a suggestion of masculinity
grotesquely in contrast with the immense bosom.</p>

<p>I looked into her eyes and forgot all grotesqueness of face
and figure. The eyes were enormous, a luminous black, clear,
disconcertingly alive. As though they were twin spirits of life,
and independent of the body. And from them poured a flood of
vitality that sent along my nerves a warm tingle in which there
was nothing sinister&mdash;or was not then.</p>

<p>With difficulty I forced my own eyes from hers. I looked for
her hands. She was swathed all in black, and her hands were
hidden in the folds of her ample dress. My gaze went back to her
eyes, and within them was a sparkle of the mocking contempt I had
seen in those of the girl. She spoke, and I knew that the vital
vibrancy I had heard in the girl's voice had been an echo of
those sonorously sweet, deep tones.</p>

<p>"What my niece has shown does not please you?"</p>

<p>I gathered my wits. I said: "They are all beautiful,
Madame&mdash; Madame-"</p>

<p>"Mandilip," she said, serenely. "Madame Mandilip. You do not
know the name, eh?"</p>

<p>"It is my ill fortune," I answered, ambiguously. "I have a
grandchild &mdash;a little girl. I want something peculiarly fine
for her seventh birthday. All that I have been shown are
beautiful&mdash;but I was wondering whether there was not
something-"</p>

<p>"Something&mdash;peculiarly-" her voice lingered on the word -
"more beautiful. Well, perhaps there is. But when I favor
customers peculiarly-" I now was sure she emphasized the word -"I
must know with whom I am dealing. You think me a strange
shopkeeper, do you not?"</p>

<p>She laughed, and I marveled at the freshness, the
youthfulness, the curious tingling sweetness of that
laughter.</p>

<p>It was by a distinct effort that I brought myself back to
reality, put myself again on guard. I drew a card from my case. I
did not wish her to recognize me, as she would have had I given
her my own card. Nor did I desire to direct her attention to
anyone she could harm. I had, therefore, prepared myself by
carrying the card of a doctor friend long dead. She glanced at
it.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said. "You are a professional&mdash;a physician.
Well, now that we know each other, come with me and I will show
you of my best."</p>

<p>She led me through the door and into a wide, dim corridor. She
touched my arm and again I felt that strange, vital tingling. She
paused at another door, and faced me.</p>

<p>"It is here," she said, "that I keep my best.
My&mdash;peculiarly best!"</p>

<p>Once more she laughed, then flung the door open.</p>

<p>I crossed the threshold and paused, looking about the room
with swift disquietude. For here was no spacious chamber of
enchantment such as Walters had described. True enough, it was
somewhat larger than one would have expected. But where were the
exquisite old panelings, the ancient tapestries, that magic
mirror which was like a great "half-globe of purest water," and
all those other things that had made it seem to her a
Paradise?</p>

<p>The light came through the half-drawn curtains of a window
opening upon a small, enclosed and barren yard. The walls and
ceiling were of plain, stained wood. One end was entirely taken
up by small, built-in cabinets with wooden doors. There was a
mirror on the wall, and it was round&mdash;but there any
similarity to Walters' description ended.</p>

<p>There was a fireplace, the kind one can find in any ordinary
old New York house. On the walls were a few prints. The great
table, the "baronial board," was an entirely commonplace one,
littered with dolls' clothing in various stages of
completion.</p>

<p>My disquietude grew. If Walters had been romancing about this
room, then what else in her diary was invention&mdash;or, at
least, as I had surmised when I had read it, the product of a too
active imagination?</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;she had not been romancing about the doll-maker's
eyes, nor her voice; and she had not exaggerated the doll-maker's
appearance nor the peculiarities of the niece. The woman spoke,
recalling me to myself, breaking my thoughts.</p>

<p>"My room interests you?"</p>

<p>She spoke softly, and with, I thought, a certain secret
amusement.</p>

<p>I said: "Any room where any true artist creates is of
interest. And you are a true artist, Madame Mandilip."</p>

<p>"Now, how do you know that?" she mused.</p>

<p>It had been a slip. I said, quickly:</p>

<p>"I am a lover of art. I have seen a few of your dolls. It does
not take a gallery of his pictures to make one realize that
Raphael, for example, was a master. One picture is enough."</p>

<p>She smiled, in the friendliest fashion. She closed the door
behind me, and pointed to a chair beside the table.</p>

<p>"You will not mind waiting a few minutes before I show you my
dolls? There is a dress I must finish. It is promised, and soon
the little one to whom I have promised it will come. It will not
take me long."</p>

<p>"Why, no," I answered, and dropped into the chair.</p>

<p>She said, softly: "It is quiet here. And you seem weary. You
have been working hard, eh? And you are weary."</p>

<p>I sank back into the chair. Suddenly I realized how weary I
really was. For a moment my guard relaxed and I closed my eyes. I
opened them to find that the doll-maker had taken her seat at the
table.</p>

<p>And now I saw her hands. They were long and delicate and white
and I knew that they were the most beautiful I had ever beheld.
Just as her eyes seemed to have life of their own, so did those
hands seem living things, having a being independent of the body
to which they belonged. She rested them on the table. She spoke
again, caressingly.</p>

<p>"It is well to come now and then to a quiet place. To a place
where peace is. One grows so weary&mdash;so weary. So
tired&mdash;so very tired."</p>

<p>She picked a little dress from the table and began to sew.
Long white fingers plied the needle while the other hand turned
and moved the small garment. How wonderful was the motion of
those long white hands... like a rhythm... like a song...
restful!</p>

<p>She said, in low sweet tones:</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;here nothing of the outer world comes. All is
peace &mdash;and rest&mdash;rest-"</p>

<p>I drew my eyes reluctantly from the slow dance of those hands,
the weaving of those long and delicate fingers which moved so
rhythmically. So restfully. The doll-maker's eyes were on me,
soft and gentle... full of that peace of which she had been
telling.</p>

<p>It would do no harm to relax a little, gain strength for the
struggle which must come. And I was tired. I had not realized how
tired! My gaze went back to her hands. Strange hands&mdash;no
more belonging to that huge body than did the eyes and voice.</p>

<p>Perhaps they did not! Perhaps that gross body was but a cloak,
a covering, of the real body to which eyes and hands and voice
belonged. I thought over that, watching the slow rhythms of the
hands. What could the body be like to which they belonged? As
beautiful as hands and eyes and voice?</p>

<p>She was humming some strange air. It was a slumberous, lulling
melody. It crept along my tired nerves, into my weary
mind&mdash;distilling sleep... sleep. As the hands were weaving
sleep. As the eyes were pouring sleep upon me -</p>

<p>Sleep!</p>

<p>Something within me was raging, furiously. Bidding me rouse
myself! Shake off this lethargy! By the tearing effort that
brought me gasping to the surface of consciousness, I knew that I
must have passed far along the path of that strange sleep. And
for an instant, on the threshold of complete awakening, I saw the
room as Walters had seen it.</p>

<p>Vast, filled with mellow light, the ancient tapestries, the
panelings, the carved screens behind which hidden shapes lurked
laughing&mdash;laughing at me. Upon the wall the mirror&mdash;and
it was like a great half-globe of purest water within which the
images of the carvings round its frame swayed like the
reflections of verdure round a clear woodland pool!</p>

<p>The immense chamber seemed to waver&mdash;and it was gone.</p>

<p>I stood beside an overturned chair in that room to which the
doll-maker had led me. And the doll-maker was beside me, close.
She was regarding me with a curious puzzlement and, I thought, a
shadow of chagrin. It flashed upon me that she was like one who
had been unexpectedly interrupted -</p>

<p>Interrupted! When had she left her chair? How long had I
slept? What had she done to me while I had been sleeping? What
had that terrific effort of will by which I had broken from her
web prevented her from completing?</p>

<p>I tried to speak&mdash;and could not. I stood tongue-tied,
furious, humiliated. I realized that I had been trapped like the
veriest tyro&mdash; I who should have been all alert, suspicious
of every move. Trapped by voice and eyes and weaving hands by the
reiterated suggestion that I was weary so weary... that here was
peace... and sleep... sleep... What had she done to me while I
slept? Why could I not move? It was as though all my energy had
been dissipated in that one tremendous thrust out of her web of
sleep! I stood motionless, silent, spent. Not a muscle moved at
command of my will. The enfeebled hands of my will reached out to
them&mdash;and fell.</p>

<p>The doll-maker laughed. She walked to the cabinets on the far
wall. My eyes followed her, helplessly. There was no slightest
loosening of the paralysis that gripped me. She pressed a spring,
and the door of a cabinet slipped down.</p>

<p>Within the cabinet was a child-doll. A little girl, sweet-
faced and smiling. I looked at it and felt a numbness at my
heart. In its small, clasped hands was one of the dagger-pins,
and I knew that this was the doll which had stirred in the arms
of the Gilmore baby... had climbed from the baby's crib... had
danced to the bed and thrust...</p>

<p>"This is one of my peculiarly best!" The doll-maker's eyes
were on me and filled with cruel mockery. "A good doll! A bit
careless at times, perhaps. Forgetting to bring back her school-
books when she goes visiting. But so obedient! Would you like her
for your granddaughter?"</p>

<p>Again she laughed&mdash;youthful, tingling, evil laughter. And
suddenly I knew Ricori had been right and that this woman must be
killed. I summoned all my will to leap upon her. I could not move
a finger.</p>

<p>The long white hands groped over the next cabinet and touched
its hidden spring. The numbness at my heart became the pressure
of a hand of ice. Staring out at me from that cabinet was
Walters! And she was crucified!</p>

<p>So perfect, so&mdash;alive was the doll that it was like
seeing the girl herself through a diminishing glass. I could not
think of it as a doll, but as the girl. She was dressed in her
nurse's uniform. She had no cap, and her black hair hung
disheveled about her face. Her arms were outstretched, and
through each palm a small nail had been thrust, pinning the hands
to the back of the cabinet. The feet were bare, resting one on
the other, and through the insteps had been thrust another nail.
Completing the dreadful, the blasphemous, suggestion, above her
head was a small placard. I read it:</p>

<p>"The Burnt Martyr."</p>

<p>The doll-maker murmured in a voice like honey garnered from
flowers in hell:</p>

<p>"This doll has not behaved well. She has been disobedient. I
punish my dolls when they do not behave well. But I see that you
are distressed. Well, she has been punished enough&mdash;for the
moment."</p>

<p>The long white hands crept into the cabinet, drew out the
nails from hands and feet. She set the doll upright, leaning
against the back. She turned to me.</p>

<p>"You would like her for your granddaughter, perhaps? Alas! She
is not for sale. She has lessons to learn before she goes again
from me."</p>

<p>Her voice changed, lost its diabolic sweetness, became charged
with menace.</p>

<p>"Now listen to me&mdash;Dr. Lowell! What&mdash;you did not
think I knew you? I knew you from the first. You too need a
lesson!" Her eyes blazed upon me. "You shall have your
lesson&mdash;you fool! You who pretend to heal the mind&mdash;and
know nothing, nothing I say, of what the mind is. You, who
conceive the mind as but a part of a machine of flesh and blood,
nerve and bone and know nothing of what it houses. You&mdash;who
admit existence of nothing unless you can measure it in your
test-tubes or see it under your microscope. You&mdash;who define
life as a chemical ferment, and consciousness as the product of
cells. You fool! Yet you and this savage, Ricori, have dared to
try to hamper me, to interfere with me, to hem me round with
spies! Dared to threaten me&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;possessor of
the ancient wisdom beside which your science is as crackling of
thorns under an empty pot! You fools! I know who are the dwellers
in the mind&mdash;and the powers that manifest themselves through
it&mdash;and those who dwell beyond it! They come at my call. And
you think to pit your paltry knowledge against mine? You fool!
Have you understood me? Speak!"</p>

<p>She pointed a finger at me. I felt my throat relax, knew I
could speak once more.</p>

<p>"You hell bag!" I croaked. "You damned murderess! You'll go to
the electric chair before I'm through with you!"</p>

<p>She came toward me, laughing.</p>

<p>"You would give me to the law? But who would believe you?
None! The ignorance that your science has fostered is my shield.
The darkness of your unbelief is my impregnable fortress. Go play
with your machines, fool! Play with your machines! But meddle
with me no more!"</p>

<p>Her voice grew quiet, deadly.</p>

<p>"Now this I tell you. If you would live, if you would have
live those who are dear to you&mdash;take your spies away. Ricori
you cannot save. He is mine. But you&mdash;think never of me
again. Pry no more into my affairs. I do not fear your
spies&mdash;but they offend me. Take them away. At once. If by
nightfall they are still on watch-"</p>

<p>She caught me by the shoulder with a grip that bruised. She
pushed me toward the door.</p>

<p>"Go!"</p>

<p>I fought to muster my will, to raise my arms. Could I have
done so I would have struck her down as I would a ravening beast.
I could not move them. Like an automaton I walked across the room
to the door. The doll-maker opened it.</p>

<p>There was an odd rustling noise from the cabinets. Stiffly, I
turned my head.</p>

<p>The doll of Walters had fallen forward. It lay half over the
edge. Its arms swung, as though imploring me to take it away. I
could see in its palms the marks of the crucifying nails. Its
eyes were fixed on mine -</p>

<p>"Go!" said the doll-maker. "And remember!"</p>

<p>With the same stiff motion I walked through the corridor and
into the shop. The girl watched me, with vague, fear-filled eyes.
As though a hand were behind me, pressing me inexorably on, I
passed through the shop and out of its door into the street.</p>

<p>I seemed to hear, did hear, the mocking evil-sweet laughter of
the doll-maker!</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE DOLL-MAKER
STRIKES</h2>

<p class="first">The moment I was out in the street, volition,
power of movement, returned to me. In an abrupt rush of rage, I
turned to re-enter the shop. A foot from it, I was brought up as
against an invisible wall. I could not advance a step, could not
even raise my hands to touch the door. It was as though at that
point my will refused to function, or rather that my legs and
arms refused to obey my will. I realized what it was&mdash;post-
hypnotic suggestion of an extraordinary kind, part of the same
phenomena which had held me motionless before the doll-maker, and
had sent me like a robot out of her lair. I saw McCann coming
toward me, and for an instant had the mad idea of ordering him to
enter and end Madame Mandilip with a bullet. Common sense swiftly
told me that we could give no rational reason for such killing,
and that we would probably expiate it within the same apparatus
of execution with which I had threatened her.</p>

<p>McCann said: "I was getting worried, Doc. Just about to break
in on you."</p>

<p>I said: "Come on, McCann. I want to get home as quickly as
possible."</p>

<p>He looked at my face, and whistled.</p>

<p>"You look like you been through a battle, Doc."</p>

<p>I answered: "I have. And the honors are all with Madame
Mandilip&mdash; so far."</p>

<p>"You came out quiet enough. Not like the boss, with the hag
spitting hell in your face. What happened?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you later. Just let me be quiet for a while. I want
to think."</p>

<p>What I actually wanted was to get back my self-possession. My
mind seemed half-blind, groping for the tangible. It was as if it
had been enmeshed in cobwebs of a peculiarly unpleasant
character, and although I had torn loose, fragments of the web
were still clinging to it. We got into the car and rolled on for
some minutes in silence. Then McCann's curiosity got the better
of him.</p>

<p>"Anyway," he asked, "what did you think of her?"</p>

<p>By this time I had come to a determination. Never had I felt
anything to approach the loathing, the cold hatred, the
implacable urge to kill, which this woman had aroused in me. It
was not that my pride had suffered, although that was sore
enough. No, it was the conviction that in the room behind the
doll-shop dwelt blackest evil. Evil as inhuman and alien as
though the doll-maker had in truth come straight from that hell
in which Ricori believed. There could be no compromise with that
evil. Nor with the woman in whom it was centered.</p>

<p>I said: "McCann, in all the world there is nothing so evil as
that woman. Do not let the girl slip through your fingers again.
Do you think she knew last night that she had been seen?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Increase the guards in front and back of the place at once.
Do it openly, so that the women cannot help noticing it. They
will think, unless the girl is aware that she was observed, that
we are still in ignorance of the other exit. They will think we
believe she managed to slip out unseen either at front or back.
Have a car in readiness at each end of the street where she keeps
the coupe. Be careful not to arouse their suspicions. If the girl
appears, follow her-" I hesitated.</p>

<p>McCann asked: "And then what?"</p>

<p>"I want her taken&mdash;abducted, kidnapped&mdash;whatever you
choose to call it. It must be done with the utmost quietness. I
leave that to you. You know how such things are done better than
I. Do it quickly and do it quietly. But not too near the doll-
shop&mdash;as far away from it as you can. Gag the girl, tie her
up if necessary. But get her. Then search the car thoroughly.
Bring the girl to me at my house&mdash;with whatever you find. Do
you understand?"</p>

<p>He said: "If she shows, we'll get her. You going to put her
through the third degree?"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;and something more. I want to see what the doll-
maker will do. It may goad her into some action which will enable
us to lay hands on her legitimately. Bring her within reach of
the law. She may or may not have other and invisible servants,
but my intention is to deprive her of the visible one. It may
make the others visible. At the least, it will cripple her."</p>

<p>He looked at me, curiously; "She musta hit you pretty hard,
Doc."</p>

<p>"She did," I answered curtly. He hesitated.</p>

<p>"You going to tell the boss about this?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"I may or I may not&mdash;tonight. It depends upon his
condition. Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, if we're going to pull off anything like a kidnapping,
I think he ought to know."</p>

<p>I said, sharply: "McCann, I told you Ricori's message was that
you were to obey orders from me as though they were from him. I
have given you your orders. I accept all the responsibility."</p>

<p>"Okay," he answered, but I could see that his doubt still
lingered.</p>

<p>Now, assuming Ricori had sufficiently recovered, there was no
real reason why I should not tell him what had happened during my
encounter with Madame Mandilip. It was different with Braile.
More than suspecting, as I did, the attachment between him and
Walters, I could not tell him of the crucified doll&mdash;and
even now I thought of it not as a doll crucified, but as Walters
crucified. If I told him, I knew well that there would be no
holding him back from instant attack upon the doll-maker. I did
not want that.</p>

<p>But I was aware of a most stubborn reluctance to tell Ricori
the details of my visit. The same held good for Braile in other
matters besides the Walters doll. And why did I feel the same way
about McCann? I set it down to wounded vanity.</p>

<p>We stopped in front of my house. It was then close to six.
Before getting out of the car I repeated my instructions. McCann
nodded.</p>

<p>"Okay, Doc. If she comes out, we get her."</p>

<p>I went into the house, and found a note from Braile saying
that he would not be in to see me until after dinner. I was glad
of that. I dreaded the ordeal of his questions. I learned that
Ricori was asleep, and that he had been regaining strength with
astonishing rapidity. I instructed the nurse to tell him, should
he awaken, that I would visit him after I had dined. I lay down,
endeavoring to snatch a little sleep before eating.</p>

<p>I could not sleep&mdash;constantly the face of the doll-maker
came before me whenever I began to relax into a doze, throwing me
into intense wakefulness.</p>

<p>At seven I arose and ate a full and excellent dinner,
deliberately drinking at least twice the amount of wine I
ordinarily permit myself, finishing with strong coffee. When I
arose from the table I felt distinctly better, mentally alert and
master of myself once more&mdash;or so I believed. I had decided
to apprise Ricori of my instructions to McCann concerning the
abduction of the girl. I realized that this was certain to bring
down upon me a minute catechism concerning my visit to the doll-
shop, but I had formulated the story I intended to tell -</p>

<p>It was with a distinct shock that I realized that this story
was all that I could tell! Realized that I could not communicate
to the others the portions I had deleted, even if I desired. And
that this was by command of the doll-maker&mdash;post-hypnotic
suggestion which was a part of those other inhibitions she had
laid upon my will; those same inhibitions which had held me
powerless before her, had marched me out of her shop like a robot
and thrust me back from her door, when I would have re-
entered!</p>

<p>During that brief tranced sleep she had said to me: "This and
this you must not tell. This and this you may."</p>

<p>I could not speak of the child-doll with the angelic face and
the dagger-pin which had pricked the bubble of Gilmore's life. I
could not speak of the Walters doll and its crucifixion. I could
not speak of the doll-maker's tacit admission that she had been
responsible for the deaths that had first led us to her.</p>

<p>However, this realization made me feel even better. Here at
last was something understandable&mdash;the tangibility for which
I had been groping; something that had in it nothing of
sorcery&mdash;nor of dark power; something entirely in the realm
of my own science. I had done the same thing to patients, many
times, bringing their minds back to normality by these same post-
hypnotic suggestions.</p>

<p>Also, there was a way by which I could wash my own mind clean
of the doll-maker's suggestions, if I chose. Should I do this?
Stubbornly, I decided I would not. It would be an admission that
I was afraid of Madame Mandilip. I hated her, yes&mdash;but I did
not fear her. Knowing now her technique, it would be folly not to
observe its results with myself as the laboratory experiment. I
told myself that I had run the gamut of those suggestions
&mdash;that whatever else it had been her intention to implant
within my mind had been held back by my unexpected awakening -
</p>

<p>Ah, but the doll-maker had spoken truth when she called me
fool!</p>

<p>When Braile appeared, I was able to meet him calmly. Hardly
had I greeted him when Ricori's nurse called up to say her
patient was wide-awake and anxious to see me.</p>

<p>I said to Braile: "This is fortunate. Come along. It will save
me from telling the same story twice over."</p>

<p>He asked: "What story?"</p>

<p>"My interview with Madame Mandilip."</p>

<p>He said, incredulously: "You've seen her!"</p>

<p>"I spent the afternoon with her. She is most interesting. Come
and hear about it."</p>

<p>I led the way rapidly to the Annex, deaf to his questions.
Ricori was sitting up. I made a brief examination. Although still
somewhat weak, he could be discharged as a patient. I
congratulated him on what was truly a remarkable recovery. I
whispered to him:</p>

<p>"I've seen your witch and talked to her. I have much to tell
you. Bid your guards take their stations outside the door. I will
dismiss the nurse for a time."</p>

<p>When guards and nurse were gone, I launched into an account of
the day's happenings, beginning with my summons to the Gilmore
apartment by McCann. Ricori listened, face grim, as I repeated
Mollie's story. He said:</p>

<p>"Her brother and now her husband! Poor, poor Mollie! But she
shall be avenged! Si!&mdash;greatly so! Yes!"</p>

<p>I gave my grossly incomplete version of my encounter with
Madame Mandilip. I told Ricori what I had bidden McCann to do. I
said:</p>

<p>"And so tonight, at least, we can sleep in peace. For if the
girl comes out with the dolls, McCann gets her. If she does not,
then nothing can happen. I am quite certain that without her the
doll-maker cannot strike. I hope you approve, Ricori."</p>

<p>He studied me for a moment, intently.</p>

<p>"I do approve, Dr. Lowell. Most greatly do I approve. You have
done as I would have done. But&mdash;I do not think you have told
us all that happened between you and the witch."</p>

<p>"Nor do I," said Braile.</p>

<p>I arose.</p>

<p>"At any rate, I've told you the essentials. And I'm dead
tired. I'm going to take a bath and go to bed. It's now nine-
thirty. If the girl does come out it won't be before eleven,
probably later. I'm going to sleep until McCann fetches her. If
he doesn't, I'm going to sleep all night. That's final. Save your
questions for the morning."</p>

<p>Ricori's searching gaze had never left me. He said:</p>

<p>"Why not sleep here? Would it not be safer for you?"</p>

<p>I succumbed to a wave of intense irritation. My pride had been
hurt enough by my behavior with the doll-maker and the manner she
had outwitted me. And the suggestion that I hide from her behind
the guns of his men opened the wound afresh.</p>

<p>"I am no child," I answered angrily. "I am quite able to take
care of myself. I do not have to live behind a screen of gunmen-
"</p>

<p>I stopped, sorry that I had said that. But Ricori betrayed no
anger. He nodded, and dropped back on his pillows.</p>

<p>"You have told me what I wanted to know. You fared very badly
with the witch, Dr. Lowell. And you have not told us all the
essentials."</p>

<p>I said: "I am sorry, Ricori!"</p>

<p>"Don't be." For the first time he smiled. "I understand,
perfectly. I also am somewhat of a psychologist. But I say this
to you&mdash;it matters little whether McCann does or does not
bring the girl to us tonight. Tomorrow the witch dies&mdash;and
the girl with her."</p>

<p>I made no answer. I recalled the nurse, and re-stationed the
guards within the room. Whatever confidence I might feel, I was
taking no chances with Ricori's safety. I had not told him of the
doll-maker's direct threat against him, but I had not forgotten
it.</p>

<p>Braile accompanied me to my study. He said,
apologetically:</p>

<p>"I know you must be damned tired, Lowell, and I don't want to
pester you. But will you let me stay in your room with you while
you are sleeping?"</p>

<p>I said with the same stubborn irritability:</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Braile, didn't you hear what I told Ricori?
I'm much obliged and all of that, but it applies to you as
well."</p>

<p>He said quietly: "I am going to stay right here in the study,
wide-awake, until McCann comes or dawn comes. If I hear any
sounds in your room, I'm coming in. Whenever I want to take a
look at you to see whether you are all right, I'm coming in.
Don't lock your door, because if you do I'll break it down. Is
that all quite clear?"</p>

<p>I grew angrier still. He said:</p>

<p>"I mean it."</p>

<p>I said: "All right. Do as you damned please."</p>

<p>I went into my bedroom, slamming the door behind me. But I did
not lock it.</p>

<p>I was tired, there was no doubt about that. Even an hour's
sleep would be something. I decided not to bother with the bath,
and began to undress. I was removing my shirt when I noticed a
tiny pin upon its left side over my heart. I opened the shirt and
looked at the under side. Fastened there was one of the knotted
cords!</p>

<p>I took a step toward the door, mouth open to call Braile. Then
I stopped short. I would not show it to Braile. That would mean
endless questioning. And I wanted to sleep.</p>

<p>God! But I wanted to sleep!</p>

<p>Better to burn the cord. I searched for a match to touch fire
to it &mdash;I heard Braile's step at the door and thrust it
hastily in my trousers' pocket.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" I called.</p>

<p>"Just want to see you get into bed all right."</p>

<p>He opened the door a trifle. What he wanted to discover, of
course, was whether I had locked it. I said nothing, and went on
undressing.</p>

<p>My bedroom is a large, high-ceilinged room on the second floor
of my home. It is at the back of the house, adjoining my study.
There are two windows which look out on the little garden. They
are framed by the creeper. The room has a chandelier, a massive,
old-fashioned thing covered with prisms&mdash; lusters I think
they are called, long pendants of cut-glass in six circles from
which rise the candle-holders. It is a small replica of one of
the lovely Colonial chandeliers in Independence Hall at
Philadelphia, and when I bought the house I would not allow it to
be taken down, nor even be wired for electric bulbs. My bed is at
the end of the room, and when I turn upon my left side I can see
the windows outlined by faint reflections. The same reflections
are caught by the prisms so that the chandelier becomes a
nebulously glimmering tiny cloud. It is restful, sleep-inducing.
There is an ancient pear tree in the garden, the last survivor of
an orchard which in spring, in New York's halcyon days, lifted to
the sun its flowered arms. The chandelier is just beyond the foot
of the bed. The switch which controls my lights is at the head of
my bed. At the side of the room is an old fireplace, its sides of
carved marble and with a wide mantel at the top. To visualize
fully what follows, it is necessary to keep this arrangement in
mind.</p>

<p>By the time I had undressed, Braile, evidently assured of my
docility, had closed the door and gone back into the study. I
took the knotted cord, the witch's ladder, and threw it
contemptuously on the table. I suppose there was something of
bravado in the action; perhaps, if I had not felt so sure of
McCann, I would have pursued my original intention of burning it.
I mixed myself a sedative, turned off the lights and lay down to
sleep. The sedative took quick effect.</p>

<p>I sank deep and deeper into a sea of sleep&mdash;deeper... and
deeper...</p>

<p>I awoke.</p>

<p>I looked around me... how had I come to this strange place? I
was standing within a shallow circular pit, grass lined. The rim
of the pit came only to my knees. The pit was in the center of a
circular, level meadow, perhaps a quarter of a mile in diameter.
This, too, was covered with grass; strange grass, purple-
flowered. Around the grassy circle drooped unfamiliar trees...
trees scaled with emeralds green and scarlet... trees with
pendulous branches covered with fernlike leaves and threaded with
slender vines that were like serpents. The trees circled the
meadow, watchful, alert... watching me... waiting for me to
move...</p>

<p>No, it was not the trees that were watching! There were things
hidden among the trees, lurking... malignant things... evil
things... and it was they who were watching me, waiting for me to
move!</p>

<p>But how had I gotten here? I looked down at my legs, stretched
my arms... I was clad in the blue pajamas in which I had gone to
bed... gone to my bed in my New York house... in my house in New
York... how had I come here? I did not seem to be dreaming...</p>

<p>Now I saw that three paths led out of the shallow pit. They
passed over the edge, and stretched, each in a different
direction, toward the woods. And suddenly I knew that I must take
one of these paths, and that it was vitally important that I pick
the right one... that only one could be traversed safely... that
the other two would lead me into the power of those lurking
things.</p>

<p>The pit began to contract. I felt its bottom lifting beneath
my feet. The pit was thrusting me out! I leaped upon the path at
my right, and began to walk slowly along it. Then involuntarily I
began to run, faster and faster along it, toward the woods. As I
drew nearer I saw that the path pierced the woods straight as an
arrow flight, and that it was about three feet wide and bordered
closely by the trees, and that it vanished in the dim green
distance. Faster and faster I ran. Now I had entered the woods,
and the unseen things were gathering among the trees that
bordered the path, thronging the borders, rushing silently from
all the wood. What those things were, what they would do to me if
they caught me I did not know... I only knew that nothing that I
could imagine of agony could equal what I would experience if
they did catch me.</p>

<p>On and on I raced through the wood, each step a nightmare. I
felt hands stretching out to clutch me... heard shrill
whisperings... Sweating, trembling, I broke out of the wood and
raced over a vast plain that stretched, treeless, to the distant
horizon. The plain was trackless, pathless, and covered with
brown and withered grass. It was like, it came to me, the blasted
heath of Macbeth's three witches. No matter... it was better than
the haunted wood. I paused and looked back at the trees. I felt
from them the gaze of myriads of the evil eyes.</p>

<p>I turned my back, and began to walk over the withered plain. I
looked up at the sky. The sky was misty green. High up in it two
cloudy orbs began to glow... black suns... no, they were not
suns... they were eyes... The eyes of the doll-maker! They stared
down at me from the misty green sky... Over the horizon of that
strange world two gigantic hands began to lift... began to creep
toward me... to catch me and hurl me back into the wood... white
hands with long fingers... and each of the long white fingers a
living thing. The hands of the doll-maker!</p>

<p>Closer came the eyes, and closer writhed the hands. From the
sky came peal upon peal of laughter... The laughter of the doll-
maker!</p>

<p>That laughter still ringing in my ears, I awakened&mdash;or
seemed to awaken. I was in my room sitting bolt upright in my
bed. I was dripping with sweat, and my heart was pumping with a
pulse that shook my body. I could see the chandelier glimmering
in the light from the windows like a small nebulous cloud. I
could see the windows faintly outlined. It was very still...</p>

<p>There was a movement at one of the windows. I would get up
from the bed and see what it was&mdash;I could not move!</p>

<p>A faint greenish glow began within the room. At first it was
like the flickering phosphorescence one sees upon a decaying log.
It waxed and waned, waxed and waned, but grew ever stronger. My
room became plain. The chandelier gleamed like a decaying emerald
-</p>

<p>There was a little face at the window! A doll's face! My heart
leaped, then curdled with despair. I thought: "McCann has failed!
It is the end!"</p>

<p>The doll looked at me, grinning. Its face was smooth shaven,
that of a man about forty. The nose was long, the mouth wide and
thin-lipped. The eyes were close-set under bushy brows. They
glittered, red as rubies.</p>

<p>The doll crept over the sill. It slid, head-first, into the
room. It stood for a moment on its head, legs waving. It
somersaulted twice. It came to its feet, one little hand at its
lips, red eyes upon mine&mdash;waiting. As though expecting
applause! It was dressed in the tights and jacket of a circus
acrobat. It bowed to me. Then with a flourish, it pointed to the
window.</p>

<p>Another little face was peering there. It was austere, cold,
the face of a man of sixty. It had small side whiskers. It stared
at me with the expression I supposed a banker might wear when
someone he hates applies to him for a loan&mdash;I found the
thought oddly amusing. Then abruptly I ceased to feel amused.</p>

<p>A banker-doll! An acrobat-doll!</p>

<p>The dolls of two of those who had suffered the unknown
death!</p>

<p>The banker-doll stepped with dignity down from the window. It
was in full evening dress, swallowtails, stiff shirt&mdash;all
perfect. It turned and with the same dignity raised a hand to the
windowsill. Another doll stood there&mdash;the doll of a woman
about the same age as the banker-doll, and garbed like it in
correct evening dress.</p>

<p>The spinster!</p>

<p>Mincingly, the spinster-doll took the proffered hand. She
jumped lightly to the floor.</p>

<p>Through the window came a fourth doll, all in spangled tights
from neck to feet. It took a flying leap, landing beside the
acrobat-doll. It looked up at me with grinning face, then
bowed.</p>

<p>The four dolls began to march toward me, the acrobats leading,
and behind them with slow and stately step, the spinster-doll and
banker-doll arm-in-arm.</p>

<p>Grotesque, fantastic, these they were&mdash;but not humorous,
God &mdash;no! Or if there were anything of humor about them, it
was that at which only devils laugh.</p>

<p>I thought, desperately: "Braile is just on the other side of
the door! If I could only make some sound!"</p>

<p>The four dolls halted and seemed to consult. The acrobats
pirouetted, and reached to their backs. They drew from the hidden
sheaths their dagger-pins. In the hands of banker-doll and
spinster-doll appeared similar weapons. They presented the points
toward me, like swords.</p>

<p>The four resumed their march to my bed...</p>

<p>The red eyes of the second acrobat-doll&mdash;the trapeze
performer, I knew him now to be&mdash;had rested on the
chandelier. He paused, studying it. He pointed to it, thrust the
dagger-pin back into its sheath, and bent his knees, hands cupped
in front of them. The first doll nodded, then stood, plainly
measuring the height of the chandelier from the floor and
considering the best approach to it. The second doll pointed to
the mantel, and the pair of them swarmed up its sides to the
broad ledge. The elderly pair watched them, seemingly much
interested. They did not sheath their dagger-pins.</p>

<p>The acrobat-doll bent, and the trapeze-doll put a little foot
in its cupped hands. The first doll straightened, and the second
flew across the gap between mantel and chandelier, caught one of
the prismed circles, and swung. Immediately the other doll leaped
outward, caught the chandelier and swung beside its spangled
mate.</p>

<p>I saw the heavy old fixture tremble and sway. Down upon the
floor came crashing a dozen of the prisms. In the dead stillness,
it was like an explosion.</p>

<p>I heard Braile running to the door. He threw it open. He stood
on the threshold. I could see him plainly in the green glow, but
I knew that he could not see&mdash;that to him the room was in
darkness. He cried:</p>

<p>"Lowell! Are you all right? Turn on the lights!"</p>

<p>I tried to call out. To warn him. Useless! He groped forward,
around the foot of the bed, to the switch. I think that then he
saw the dolls. He stopped short, directly beneath the chandelier,
looking up.</p>

<p>And as he did so the doll above him swung by one hand, drew
its dagger-pin from its sheath and dropped upon Braile's
shoulders, stabbing viciously at his throat!</p>

<p>Braile shrieked&mdash;once. The shriek changed into a dreadful
bubbling sigh...</p>

<p>And then I saw the chandelier sway and lurch. It broke from
its ancient fastenings. It fell with a crash that shook the
house, down upon Braile and the doll-devil ripping at his
throat.</p>

<p>Abruptly the green glow disappeared. There was a scurrying in
the room like the running of great rats.</p>

<p>The paralysis dropped from me. I threw my hand round to the
switch and turned on the lights; leaped from the bed.</p>

<p>Little figures were scrambling up and out of the window. There
were four muffled reports like popguns. I saw Ricori at the door,
on each side of him a guard with silenced automatic, shooting at
the window.</p>

<p>I bent over Braile. He was quite dead. The falling chandelier
had dropped upon his head, crushing the skull. But Braile had
been dying before the chandelier had fallen... his throat
ripped... the carotid artery severed.</p>

<p>The doll that had murdered him was gone!</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE WITCH
GIRL</h2>

<p class="first">I stood up. I said bitterly:</p>

<p>"You were right, Ricori&mdash;her servants are better than
yours."</p>

<p>He did not answer, looking down at Braile with pity-filled
face.</p>

<p>I said: "If all your men fulfill their promises like McCann,
that you are still alive I count as one of the major
miracles."</p>

<p>"As for McCann," he turned his gaze to me somberly, "he is
both intelligent and loyal. I will not condemn him unheard. And I
say to you, Dr. Lowell, that if you had shown more frankness to
me this night&mdash;Dr. Braile would not be dead."</p>

<p>I winced at that&mdash;there was too much truth in it. I was
racked by regret and grief and helpless rage. If I had not let my
cursed pride control me, if I had told them all that I could of
my encounter with the doll-maker, explained why there were
details I was unable to tell, given myself over to Braile for a
cleansing counter-hypnotization&mdash;no, if I had but accepted
Ricori's offer of protection, or Braile's to watch over me while
asleep&mdash;then this could not have happened.</p>

<p>I looked into the study and saw there Ricori's nurse. I could
hear whispering outside the study doors&mdash;servants, and
others from the Annex who had been attracted by the noise of the
falling chandelier. I said to the nurse, quite calmly:</p>

<p>"The chandelier fell while Dr. Braile was standing at the foot
of my bed talking to me. It has killed him. But do not tell the
others that. Only say that the chandelier fell, injuring Dr.
Braile. Send them back to their beds &mdash;say that we are
taking Dr. Braile to the hospital. Then return with Porter and
clean up what you can of the blood. Leave the chandelier as it
is."</p>

<p>When she had gone I turned to Ricori's gunmen.</p>

<p>"What did you see when you shot?"</p>

<p>One answered: "They looked like monkeys to me."</p>

<p>The other said: "Or midgets."</p>

<p>I looked at Ricori, and read in his face what he had seen. I
stripped the light blanket from the bed.</p>

<p>"Ricori," I said, "let your men lift Braile and wrap him in
this. Then have them carry him into the small room next to the
study and place him on the cot."</p>

<p>He nodded to them, and they lifted Braile from the debris of
shattered glass and bent metal. His face and neck had been cut by
the broken prisms and by some chance one of these wounds was
close to the spot where the dagger-pin of the doll had been
thrust. It was deep, and had probably caused a second severance
of the carotid artery. I followed with Ricori into the small
room. They placed the body on the cot and Ricori ordered them to
go back to the bedroom and watch while the nurses were there. He
closed the door of the small room behind them, then turned to
me.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Dr. Lowell?"</p>

<p>What I felt like doing was weeping, but I answered: "It is a
coroner's case, of course. I must notify the police at once."</p>

<p>"What are you going to tell them?"</p>

<p>"What did you see at the window, Ricori?"</p>

<p>"I saw the dolls!"</p>

<p>"And I. Can I tell the police what did kill Braile before the
chandelier fell? You know I cannot. No, I shall tell them that we
were talking when, without warning, the fixture dropped upon him.
Splintered glass from the pendants pierced his throat. What else
can I say? And they will believe that readily enough when they
would not believe the truth-"</p>

<p>I hesitated, then my reserve broke; for the first time in many
years, I wept.</p>

<p>"Ricori&mdash;you were right. Not McCann but I am to blame for
this &mdash;the vanity of an old man&mdash;had I spoken freely,
fully&mdash; he would be alive... but I did not... I did not... I
am his murderer."</p>

<p>He comforted me&mdash;gently as a woman...</p>

<p>"It was not your fault. You could not have done otherwise...
being what you are... thinking as you have so long thought. If in
your unbelief, your entirely natural unbelief, the witch found
her opportunity... still, it was not your fault. But now she
shall find no more opportunities. Her cup is full and
overflowing..."</p>

<p>He put his hands on my shoulders.</p>

<p>"Do not notify the police for a time&mdash;not until we hear
from McCann. It is now close to twelve and he will telephone even
if he does not come. I will go to my room and dress. For when I
have heard from McCann I must leave you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do, Ricori?"</p>

<p>"Kill the witch," he answered quietly. "Kill her and the girl.
Before the day comes. I have waited too long. I will wait no
longer. She shall kill no more."</p>

<p>I felt a wave of weakness. I dropped into a chair. My sight
dimmed. Ricori gave me water, and I drank thirstily. Through the
roaring in my ears I heard a knocking at the door and the voice
of one of Ricori's men:</p>

<p>"McCann is here."</p>

<p>Ricori said: "Tell him to come in."</p>

<p>The door opened. McCann strode into the room.</p>

<p>"I got her-"</p>

<p>He stopped short, staring at us. His eyes fell upon the
covered body upon the cot and his face grew grim:</p>

<p>"What's happened?"</p>

<p>Ricori answered: "The dolls killed Dr. Braile. You captured
the girl too late, McCann. Why?"</p>

<p>"Killed Braile? The dolls! God!" McCann's voice was as though
a hand had gripped his throat.</p>

<p>Ricori asked: "Where is the girl, McCann?"</p>

<p>He answered, dully: "Down in the car, gagged and tied."</p>

<p>Ricori asked: "When did you get her? And where?"</p>

<p>Looking at McCann, I suddenly felt a great pity and sympathy
for him. It sprang from my own remorse and shame. I said:</p>

<p>"Sit down, McCann. I am far more to blame for what has
happened than you can possibly be."</p>

<p>Ricori said, coldly: "Leave me to be judge of that. McCann,
did you place cars at each end of the street, as Dr. Lowell
instructed?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then begin your story at that point."</p>

<p>McCann said: "She comes into the street. It's close to eleven.
I'm at the east end an' Paul at the west. I say to Tony: 'We got
the wench pocketed!' She carries two suitcases. She looks around
an' trots where we located her car. She opens the door. When she
comes out she rides west where Paul is. I've told Paul what the
Doc tells me, not to grab her too close to the doll-shop. I see
Paul tail her. I shoot down the street an' tail Paul.</p>

<p>"The coupe turns into West Broadway. There she gets the break,
a Staten Island boat is just in an' the street's lousy with a
herd of cars. A Ford shoots over to the left, trying to pass
another. Paul hits the Ford and wraps himself round one of the
El's pillars. There's a mess. I'm a minute or two getting out the
jam. When I do, the coupe's outa sight.</p>

<p>"I hop down an' telephone Rod. I tell him to get the wench
when she shows up, even if they have to rope her off the steps of
the doll-shop. An' when they get her, bring her right here.</p>

<p>"I come up here. I figure maybe she's headed this way. I coast
along by here an' then take a look in the Park, I figure the
doll-hag's been getting all the breaks an' now one's due me. I
get it. I see the coupe parked under some trees. We get the gal.
She don't put up no fight at all. But we gag her an' put her in
the car. Tony rolls the coupe away an' searches it. There ain't a
thing in it but the two suitcases an' they're empty. We bring the
gal here."</p>

<p>I asked: "How long between when you caught the girl and your
arrival?"</p>

<p>"Ten-fifteen minutes, maybe. Tony nigh took the coupe to
pieces. An' that took time."</p>

<p>I looked at Ricori. McCann must have come upon the girl just
about the moment Braile had died. He nodded:</p>

<p>"She was waiting for the dolls, of course."</p>

<p>McCann asked: "What do you want me to do with her?"</p>

<p>He looked at Ricori, not at me. Ricori said nothing, staring
at McCann with a curious intentness. But I saw him clench his
left hand, then open it, fingers wide. McCann said:</p>

<p>"Okay, boss."</p>

<p>He started toward the door. It did not take unusual acumen to
know that he had been given orders, nor could their significance
be mistaken.</p>

<p>"Stop!" I intercepted him and stood with my back against the
door. "Listen to me, Ricori. I have something to say about this.
Dr. Braile was as close to me as Peters to you. Whatever the
guilt of Madame Mandilip, this girl is helpless to do other than
what she orders her. Her will is absolutely controlled by the
doll-maker. I strongly suspect that a good part of the time she
is under complete hypnotic control. I cannot forget that she
tried to save Walters. I will not see her murdered."</p>

<p>Ricori said: "If you are right, all the more reason she should
be destroyed quickly. Then the witch cannot make use of her
before she herself is destroyed."</p>

<p>"I will not have it, Ricori. And there is another reason. I
want to question her. I may discover how Madame Mandilip does
these things&mdash; the mystery of the dolls&mdash;the
ingredients of the salve&mdash;whether there are others who share
her knowledge. All this and more, the girl may know. And if she
does know, I can make her tell."</p>

<p>McCann said, cynically: "Yeah?"</p>

<p>Ricori asked: "How?"</p>

<p>I answered grimly: "By using the same trap in which the doll-
maker caught me."</p>

<p>For a full minute Ricori considered me, gravely.</p>

<p>"Dr. Lowell," he said, "for the last time I yield my judgment
to yours in this matter. I think you are wrong. I know that I was
wrong when I did not kill the witch that day I met her. I believe
that every moment this girl is permitted to remain alive is a
moment laden with danger for us all. Nevertheless, I
yield&mdash;for this last time."</p>

<p>"McCann," I said, "bring the girl into my office. Wait until I
get rid of anyone who may be downstairs."</p>

<p>I went downstairs, McCann and Ricori following. No one was
there. I placed on my desk a development of the Luys mirror, a
device used first at the Slpetrire in Paris to induce hypnotic
sleep. It consists of two parallel rows of small reflectors
revolving in opposite directions. A ray of light plays upon them
in such a manner as to cause their surfaces alternately to gleam
and darken. A most useful device, and one to which I believed the
girl, long sensitized to hypnotic suggestion, must speedily
succumb. I placed a comfortable chair at the proper angle, and
subdued the lights so that they could not compete with the
hypnotic mirror.</p>

<p>I had hardly completed these arrangements when McCann and
another of Ricori's henchmen brought in the girl. They placed her
in the easy chair, and I took from her lips the cloth with which
she had been silenced.</p>

<p>Ricori said: "Tony, go out to the car. McCann, you stay
here."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; END OF THE WITCH
GIRL</h2>

<p class="first">The girl made no resistance whatever. She seemed
entirely withdrawn into herself, looking up at me with the same
vague stare I had noted on my visit to the doll-shop. I took her
hands. She let them rest passively in mine. They were very cold.
I said to her, gently, reassuringly:</p>

<p>"My child, no one is going to hurt you. Rest and relax. Sink
back in the chair. I only want to help you. Sleep if you wish.
Sleep."</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear, still regarding me with that vague
gaze. I released her hands. I took my own chair, facing her, and
set the little mirrors revolving. Her eyes turned to them at
once, rested upon them, fascinated. I watched her body relax; she
sank back in her chair. Her eyelids began to droop.</p>

<p>"Sleep," I said softly. "Here none can harm you. While you
sleep none can harm you. Sleep... sleep..."</p>

<p>Her eyes closed; she sighed.</p>

<p>I said: "You are asleep. You will not awaken until I bid you.
You cannot awaken until I bid you."</p>

<p>She repeated in a murmuring, childish voice: "I am asleep; I
cannot awaken until you bid me."</p>

<p>I stopped the whirling mirrors. I said to her: "There are some
questions I am going to ask you. You will listen, and you will
answer me truthfully. You cannot answer them except truthfully.
You know that."</p>

<p>She echoed, still in that faint childish voice: "I must answer
you truthfully. I know that."</p>

<p>I could not refrain from darting a glance of triumph at Ricori
and McCann. Ricori was crossing himself, staring at me with wide
eyes in which were both doubt and awe. I knew he was thinking
that I, too, knew witchcraft. McCann sat chewing nervously. And
staring at the girl.</p>

<p>I began my questions, choosing at first those least likely to
disturb. I asked:</p>

<p>"Are you truly Madame Mandilip's niece?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Who are you, then?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"When did you join her, and why?"</p>

<p>"Twenty years ago. I was in a creche, a foundling asylum at
Vienna. She took me from it. She taught me to call her my aunt.
But she is not."</p>

<p>"Where have you lived since then?"</p>

<p>"In Berlin, in Paris, then London, Prague, Warsaw."</p>

<p>"Did Madame Mandilip make her dolls in each of these
places?"</p>

<p>She did not answer; she shuddered; her eyelids began to
tremble.</p>

<p>"Sleep! Remember, you cannot awaken until I bid you! Sleep!
Answer me."</p>

<p>She whispered: "Yes."</p>

<p>"And they killed in each city?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sleep. Be at ease. Nothing is going to harm you-" Her
disquietude had again become marked, and I veered for a moment
from the subject of the dolls. "Where was Madame Mandilip
born?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"How old is she?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. I have asked her, and she has laughed and said
that time is nothing to her. I was five years old when she took
me. She looked then just as she does now."</p>

<p>"Has she any accomplices&mdash;I mean are there others who
make the dolls?"</p>

<p>"One. She taught him. He was her lover in Prague."</p>

<p>"Her lover!" I exclaimed, incredulously&mdash;the image of the
immense gross body, the great breasts, the heavy horse-like face
of the doll-maker rising before my eyes. She said:</p>

<p>"I know what you are thinking. But she has another body. She
wears it when she pleases. It is a beautiful body. It belongs to
her eyes, her hands, her voice. When she wears that body she is
beautiful. She is terrifyingly beautiful. I have seen her wear it
many times."</p>

<p>Another body! An illusion, of course... like the enchanted
room Walters had described... and which I had glimpsed when
breaking from the hypnotic web in which she had enmeshed me... a
picture drawn by the doll-maker's mind in the mind of the girl. I
dismissed that, and drove to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>"She kills by two methods, does she not&mdash;by the salve and
by the dolls?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by the unguent and the dolls."</p>

<p>"How many has she killed by the unguent in New York?"</p>

<p>She answered, indirectly: "She has made fourteen dolls since
we came here."</p>

<p>So there were other cases that had not been reported to me! I
asked:</p>

<p>"'And how many have the dolls killed?"</p>

<p>"Twenty."</p>

<p>I heard Ricori curse, and shot him a warning look. He was
leaning forward, white and tense; McCann had stopped his
chewing.</p>

<p>"How does she make the dolls?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Do you know how she prepares the unguent?"</p>

<p>"No. She does that secretly."</p>

<p>"What is it that activates the dolls?"</p>

<p>"You mean makes them&mdash;alive?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Something from the dead!"</p>

<p>Again I heard Ricori cursing softly. I said: "If you do not
know how the dolls are made, you must know what is necessary to
make them alive. What is it?"</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>"You must answer me. You must obey me. Speak!"</p>

<p>She said: "Your question is not clear. I have told you that
something of the dead makes them alive. What else is it you would
know?"</p>

<p>"Begin from where one who poses for a doll first meets Madame
Mandilip to the last step when the doll&mdash;as you put
it&mdash;becomes alive."</p>

<p>She spoke, dreamily:</p>

<p>"She has said one must come to her of his own will. He must
consent of his own volition, without coercion, to let her make
the doll. That he does not know to what he is consenting matters
nothing. She must begin the first model immediately. Before she
completes the second&mdash;the doll that is to live &mdash;she
must find opportunity to apply the unguent. She has said of this
unguent that it liberates one of those who dwell within the mind,
and that this one must come to her and enter the doll. She has
said that this one is not the sole tenant of the mind, but with
the others she has no concern. Nor does she select all of those
who come before her. How she knows those with whom she can deal,
or what there is about them which makes her select them, I do not
know. She makes the second doll. At the instant of its completion
he who has posed for it begins to die. When he is dead&mdash;the
doll lives. It obeys her&mdash;as they all obey her..."</p>

<p>She paused, then said, musingly "All except one-"</p>

<p>"And that one?"</p>

<p>"She who was your nurse. She will not obey. My aunt torments
her, punishes her... still she cannot control her. I brought the
little nurse here last night with another doll to kill the man
my&mdash;aunt&mdash;cursed. The nurse came, but she fought the
other doll and saved the man. It is something my aunt cannot
understand... it perplexes her... and it gives me... hope!"</p>

<p>Her voice trailed away. Then suddenly, with energy, she
said:</p>

<p>"You must make haste. I should be back with the dolls. Soon
she will be searching for me. I must go... or she will come for
me... and then... if she finds me here... she will kill
me..."</p>

<p>I said: "You brought the dolls to kill me?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Where are the dolls now?"</p>

<p>She answered: "They were coming back to me. Your men caught me
before they could reach me. They will go... home. The dolls
travel quickly when they must. It is more difficult without me
that is all... but they will return to her."</p>

<p>"Why do the dolls kill?"</p>

<p>"To... please... her."</p>

<p>I said: "The knotted cord, what part does it play?"</p>

<p>She answered: "I do not know&mdash;but she says-" Then
suddenly, desperately, like a frightened child, she whispered:
"She is searching for me! Her eyes are looking for me... her
hands are groping&mdash;she sees me! Hide me! Oh, hide me from
her quick..."</p>

<p>I said: "Sleep more deeply! Go down&mdash;down
deep&mdash;deeper still into sleep. Now she cannot find you! Now
you are hidden from her!"</p>

<p>She whispered: "I am deep in sleep. She has lost me. I am
hidden. But she is hovering over me she is still
searching..."</p>

<p>Ricori and McCann had left their chairs and were beside
me.</p>

<p>Ricori asked:</p>

<p>"You believe the witch is after her?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "But this is not an unexpected development.
The girl has been under the woman's control so long, and so
completely, that the reaction is natural. It may be the result of
suggestion, or it may be the reasoning of her own
subconsciousness... she has been breaking commands... she has
been threatened with punishment if she should-"</p>

<p>The girl screamed, agonized:</p>

<p>"She sees me! She has found me! Her hands are reaching out to
me!"</p>

<p>"Sleep! Sleep deeper still! She cannot hurt you. Again she has
lost you!"</p>

<p>The girl did not answer, but a faint moaning was audible, deep
in her throat.</p>

<p>McCann swore, huskily: "Christ! Can't you help her?"</p>

<p>Ricori, eyes unnaturally bright in a chalky face, said: "Let
her die! It will save us trouble!"</p>

<p>I said to the girl, sternly:</p>

<p>"Listen to me and obey. I am going to count five. When I come
to five &mdash;awaken! Awaken at once! You will come up from
sleep so swiftly that she cannot catch you! Obey!"</p>

<p>I counted, slowly, since to have awakened her at once would,
in all likelihood, have brought her to the death which her
distorted mind told her was threatened by the doll-maker.</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three-"</p>

<p>An appalling scream came from the girl. And then -</p>

<p>"She's caught me! Her hands are around my heart... Uh-h-
h..."</p>

<p>Her body bent; a spasm ran through her. Her body relaxed and
sank limply in the chair. Her eyes opened, stared blankly; her
jaw dropped.</p>

<p>I ripped open her bodice, set my stethoscope to her heart. It
was still.</p>

<p>And then from the dead throat issued a voice organ-toned,
sweet, laden with menace and contempt...</p>

<p>"You fools!"</p>

<p>The voice of Madame Mandilip!</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; BURN WITCH
BURN!</h2>

<p class="first">Curiously enough, Ricori was the least affected
of the three of us. My own flesh had crept. McCann, although he
had never heard the doll-maker's voice, was greatly shaken. And
it was Ricori who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"You are sure the girl is dead?"</p>

<p>"There is no possible doubt of it, Ricori."</p>

<p>He nodded to McCann: "Carry her down to the car."</p>

<p>I asked: "What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>He answered: "Kill the witch." He quoted with satiric
unctuousness: "In death they shall not be divided." He said,
passionately: "As in hell they shall burn together forever!"</p>

<p>He looked at me, sharply.</p>

<p>"You do not approve of this, Dr. Lowell?"</p>

<p>"Ricori, I don't know&mdash;I honestly do not know. Today I
would have killed her with my own hands but now the rage is
spent. What you have threatened is against all my instincts, all
my habits of thought, all my convictions of how justice should be
administered. It seems to me&mdash; murder!"</p>

<p>He said: "You heard the girl. Twenty in this city alone killed
by the dolls. And fourteen dolls. Fourteen who died as Peters
did!"</p>

<p>"But, Ricori, no court could consider allegations under
hypnosis as evidence. It may be true, it may not be. The girl was
abnormal. What she told might be only her
imaginings&mdash;without supporting evidence, no court on earth
could accept it as a basis for action."</p>

<p>He said: "No&mdash;no earthly court-" He gripped my shoulders.
He asked: "Do you believe it was truth?"</p>

<p>I could not answer, for deep within me I felt it was truth. He
said:</p>

<p>"Precisely, Dr. Lowell! You have answered me. You know, as I
know, that the girl did speak the truth. You know, as I know,
that our law cannot punish the witch. That is why I must kill
her. In doing that, I, Ricori, am no murderer. No, I am God's
executioner!"</p>

<p>He waited for me to speak. Again I could not answer.</p>

<p>"McCann"&mdash;he pointed to the girl&mdash;"do as I told you.
Then return."</p>

<p>And when McCann had gone out with the frail body in his arms,
Ricori said:</p>

<p>"Dr. Lowell&mdash;you must go with me to witness this
execution."</p>

<p>I recoiled at that. I said:</p>

<p>"Ricori, I can't. I am utterly weary&mdash;in body and mind. I
have gone through too much today. I am broken with grief-"</p>

<p>"You must go," he interrupted, "if we have to carry you,
gagged as the girl was, and bound. I will tell you why. You are
at war with yourself. Alone, it is possible your scientific
doubts might conquer, that you would attempt to halt me before I
have done what I swear by Christ, His Holy Mother, and the
Saints, I shall do. You might yield to weariness and place the
whole matter before the police. I will not take that risk. I have
affection for you, Dr. Lowell, deep affection. But I tell you
that if my own mother tried to stop me in this I would sweep her
aside as ruthlessly as I shall you."</p>

<p>I said: "I will go with you."</p>

<p>"Then tell the nurse to bring me my clothing. Until all is
over, we remain together. I am taking no more chances."</p>

<p>I took up the telephone and gave the necessary order. McCann
returned, and Ricori said to him:</p>

<p>"When I am clothed, we go to the doll-shop. Who is in the car
with Tony?"</p>

<p>"Larson and Cartello."</p>

<p>"Good. It may be that the witch knows we are coming. It may be
that she has listened through the girl's dead ears as she spoke
from her dead throat. No matter. We shall assume that she did
not. Are there bars on the door?"</p>

<p>McCann said: "Boss, I ain't been in the shop. I don't know.
There's a glass panel. If there's bars we can work 'em. Tony'll
get the tools while you put on your clothes."</p>

<p>"Dr. Lowell," Ricori turned on me. "Will you give me your word
that you will not change your mind about going with me? Nor
attempt to interfere in what I am going to do?"</p>

<p>"I give you my word, Ricori."</p>

<p>"McCann, you need not come back. Wait for us in the car."</p>

<p>Ricori was soon dressed. As I walked with him out of my house,
a clock struck one. I remembered that this strange adventure had
begun, weeks ago, at that very hour...</p>

<p>I rode in the back of the car with Ricori, the dead girl
between us. On the middle seats were Larson and Cartello, the
former a stolid Swede, the latter a wiry little Italian. The man
named Tony drove, McCann beside him. We swung down the avenue and
in about half an hour were on lower Broadway. As we drew near the
street of the doll-maker, we went less quickly. The sky was
overcast, a cold wind blowing off the bay. I shivered, but not
with cold.</p>

<p>We came to the corner of the doll-maker's street.</p>

<p>For several blocks we had met no one, seen no one. It was as
though we were passing through a city of the dead. Equally
deserted was the street of the doll-maker.</p>

<p>Ricori said to Tony:</p>

<p>"Draw up opposite the doll-shop. We'll get out. Then go down
to the corner. Wait for us there."</p>

<p>My heart was beating uncomfortably. There was a quality of
blackness in the night that seemed to swallow up the glow from
the street lamps. There was no light in the doll-maker's shop,
and in the old-fashioned doorway, set level with the street, the
shadows clustered. The wind whined, and I could hear the beating
of waves on the Battery wall. I wondered whether I would be able
to go through that doorway, or whether the inhibition the doll-
maker had put upon me still held me.</p>

<p>McCann slipped out of the car, carrying the girl's body. He
propped her, sitting in the doorway's shadows. Ricori and I,
Larson and Cartello, followed. The car rolled off. And again I
felt the sense of nightmare unreality which had clung to me so
often since I had first set my feet on this strange path to the
doll-maker...</p>

<p>The little Italian was smearing the glass of the door with
some gummy material. In the center of it he fixed a small vacuum
cup of rubber. He took a tool from his pocket and drew with it a
foot-wide circle on the glass. The point of the tool cut into the
glass as though it had been wax. Holding the vacuum cup in one
hand, he tapped the glass lightly with a rubber-tipped hammer.
The circle of glass came away in his hand. All had been done
without the least sound. He reached through the hole, and fumbled
about noiselessly for a few moments. There was a faint click. The
door swung open.</p>

<p>McCann picked up the dead girl. We went, silent as phantoms,
into the doll-shop. The little Italian set the circle of glass
back in its place. I could see dimly the door that opened into
the corridor leading to that evil room at the rear. The little
Italian tried the knob. The door was locked. He worked for a few
seconds, and the door swung open. Ricori leading, McCann behind
him with the girl, we passed like shadows through the corridor
and paused at the further door.</p>

<p>The door swung open before the little Italian could touch
it.</p>

<p>We heard the voice of the doll-maker!</p>

<p>"Enter, gentlemen. It was thoughtful of you to bring me back
my dear niece! I would have met you at my outer door&mdash;but I
am an old, old woman and timid!"</p>

<p>McCann whispered: "One side, boss!"</p>

<p>He shifted the body of the girl to his left arm, and holding
her like a shield, pistol drawn, began to edge by Ricori. Ricori
thrust him away. His own automatic leveled, he stepped over the
threshold. I followed McCann, the two gunmen at my back.</p>

<p>I took a swift glance around the room. The doll-maker sat at
her table, sewing. She was serene, apparently untroubled. Her
long white fingers danced to the rhythm of her stitches. She did
not look up at us. There were coals burning in the fireplace. The
room was very warm, and there was a strong aromatic odor,
unfamiliar to me. I looked toward the cabinets of the dolls.</p>

<p>Every cabinet was open. Dolls stood within them, row upon row,
staring down at us with eyes green and blue, gray and black,
lifelike as though they were midgets on exhibition in some
grotesque peepshow. There must have been hundreds of them. Some
were dressed as we in America dress; some as the Germans do; some
as the Spanish, the French, the English; others were in costumes
I did not recognize. A ballerina, and a blacksmith with his
hammer raised... a French chevalier, and a German student,
broadsword in hand, livid scars upon his face... an Apache with
knife in hand, drug-madness on his yellow face and next to him a
vicious-mouthed woman of the streets and next to her a
jockey...</p>

<p>The loot of the doll-maker from a dozen lands!</p>

<p>The dolls seemed to be poised to leap. To flow down upon us.
Overwhelm us.</p>

<p>I steadied my thoughts. I forced myself to meet that battery
of living dolls' eyes as though they were but lifeless dolls.
There was an empty cabinet... another and another... five
cabinets without dolls. The four dolls I had watched march upon
me in the paralysis of the green glow were not there nor was
Walters.</p>

<p>I wrenched my gaze away from the tiers of the watching dolls.
I looked again at the doll-maker, still placidly sewing... as
though she were alone... as though she were unaware of us... as
though Ricori's pistol were not pointed at her heart... sewing...
singing softly...</p>

<p>The Walters doll was on the table before her!</p>

<p>It lay prone on its back. Its tiny hands were fettered at the
wrists with twisted cords of the ashen hair. They were bound
round and round, and the fettered hands clutched the hilt of a
dagger-pin!</p>

<p>Long in the telling, but brief in the seeing&mdash;a few
seconds in time as we measure it.</p>

<p>The doll-maker's absorption in her sewing, her utter
indifference to us, the silence, made a screen between us and
her, an ever-thickening though invisible barrier. The pungent
aromatic fragrance grew stronger.</p>

<p>McCann dropped the body of the girl on the floor.</p>

<p>He tried to speak&mdash;once, twice; at the third attempt he
succeeded. He said to Ricori hoarsely, in strangled voice:</p>

<p>"Kill her... or I will-" Ricori did not move. He stood rigid,
automatic pointed at the doll-maker's heart, eyes fixed on her
dancing hands. He did not seem to hear McCann, or if he heard, he
did not heed. The doll-maker's song went on... it was like the
hum of bees... it was a sweet droning... it garnered sleep as the
bees garner honey... sleep...</p>

<p>Ricori shifted his grip upon his gun. He sprang forward. He
swung the butt of the pistol down upon a wrist of the doll-
maker.</p>

<p>The hand dropped, the fingers of that hand writhed...
hideously the long white fingers writhed and twisted... like
serpents whose backs have been broken...</p>

<p>Ricori raised the gun for a second blow. Before it could fall
the doll-maker had leaped to her feet, overturning her chair. A
whispering ran over the cabinets like a thin veil of sound. The
dolls seemed to bend, to lean forward...</p>

<p>The doll-maker's eyes were on us now. They seemed to take in
each and all of us at once. And they were like flaming black suns
in which danced tiny crimson flames.</p>

<p>Her will swept out and overwhelmed us. It was like a wave,
tangible. I felt it strike me as though it were a material thing.
A numbness began to creep through me. I saw the hand of Ricori
that clutched the pistol twitch and whiten. I knew that same
numbness was gripping him as it gripped McCann and the
others...</p>

<p>Once more the doll-maker had trapped us!</p>

<p>I whispered: "Don't look at her, Ricori... don't look in her
eyes..."</p>

<p>With a tearing effort I wrested my own away from those flaming
black ones. They fell upon the Walters doll. Stiffly, I reached
to take it up&mdash; why, I did not know. The doll-maker was
quicker than I. She snatched up the doll with her uninjured hand,
and held it to her breast. She cried, in a voice whose vibrant
sweetness ran through every nerve, augmenting the creeping
lethargy:</p>

<p>"You will not look at me? You will not look at me!
Fools&mdash;you can do nothing else!"</p>

<p>Then began that strange, that utterly strange episode that was
the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>The aromatic fragrance seemed to pulse, to throb, grow
stronger. Something like a sparkling mist whirled out of
nothingness and covered the doll-maker, veiling the horse-like
face, the ponderous body. Only her eyes shone through that
mist...</p>

<p>The mist cleared away. Before us stood a woman of breath-
taking beauty &mdash;tall and slender and exquisite. Naked, her
hair, black and silken fine, half-clothed her to her knees.
Through it the pale golden flesh gleamed. Only the eyes, the
hands, the doll still clasped to one of the round, high breasts
told who she was.</p>

<p>Ricori's automatic dropped from his hand. I heard the weapons
of the others fall to the floor. I knew they stood rigid as I,
stunned by that incredible transformation, and helpless in the
grip of the power streaming from the doll-maker.</p>

<p>She pointed to Ricori and laughed: "You would kill
me&mdash;me! Pick up your weapon, Ricori&mdash;and try!"</p>

<p>Ricori's body bent slowly, slowly... I could see him only
indirectly, for my eyes could not leave the woman's... and I knew
that his could not... that, fastened to them, his eyes were
turning upward, upward as he bent. I sensed rather than saw that
his groping hand had touched his pistol&mdash;that he was trying
to lift it. I heard him groan. The doll-maker laughed again.</p>

<p>"Enough, Ricori&mdash;you cannot!"</p>

<p>Ricori's body straightened with a snap, as though a hand had
clutched his chin and thrust him up...</p>

<p>There was a rustling behind me, the patter of little feet, the
scurrying of small bodies past me.</p>

<p>At the feet of the woman were four mannikins... the four who
had marched upon me in the green glow... banker-doll, spinster-
doll, the acrobat, the trapeze performer.</p>

<p>They stood, the four of them, ranged in front of her, glaring
at us. In the hand of each was a dagger-pin, points thrust at us
like tiny swords. And once more the laughter of the woman filled
the room. She spoke, caressingly:</p>

<p>"No, no, my little ones. I do not need you!"</p>

<p>She pointed to me.</p>

<p>"You know this body of mine is but illusion, do you not?
Speak."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And these at my feet&mdash;and all my little ones&mdash;are
but illusions?"</p>

<p>I said: "I do not know that."</p>

<p>"You know too much&mdash;and you know too little. Therefore
you must die, my too wise and too foolish doctor-" The great eyes
dwelt upon me with mocking pity, the lovely face became
maliciously pitiful. "And Ricori too must die&mdash;because he
knows too much. And you others&mdash;you too must die. But not at
the hands of my little people. Not here. No! At your home, my
good doctor. You shall go there silently&mdash;speaking neither
among yourselves nor to any others on your way. And when there
you will turn upon yourselves... each slaying the other...
rending yourselves like wolves... like&mdash; "</p>

<p>She staggered back a step, reeling.</p>

<p>I saw&mdash;or thought I saw&mdash;the doll of Walters writhe.
Then swift as a striking snake it raised its bound hands and
thrust the dagger-pin through the doll-maker's throat... twisted
it savagely... and thrust and thrust again... stabbing the golden
throat of the woman precisely where that other doll had stabbed
Braile!</p>

<p>And as Braile had screamed&mdash;so now screamed the doll-
maker... dreadfully, agonizedly...</p>

<p>She tore the doll from her breast. She hurled it from her. The
doll hurtled toward the fireplace, rolled, and touched the
glowing coals.</p>

<p>There was a flash of brilliant flame, a wave of that same
intense heat I had felt when the match of McCann had struck the
Peters doll. And instantly, at the touch of that heat, the dolls
at the woman's feet vanished. From them arose swiftly a pillar of
that same brilliant flame. It coiled and wrapped itself around
the doll-maker, from feet to head.</p>

<p>I saw the shape of beauty melt away. In its place was the
horse-like face, the immense body of Madame Mandilip... eyes
seared and blind... the long white hands clutching at her torn
throat, and no longer white but crimson with her blood.</p>

<p>Thus for an instant she stood, then toppled to the floor.</p>

<p>And at that instant of her fall, the spell that held us
broke.</p>

<p>Ricori leaned toward the huddled hulk that had been the doll-
maker. He spat upon it. He shouted, exultantly:</p>

<p>"Burn witch burn!"</p>

<p>He pushed me to the door, pointing toward the tiers of the
watching dolls that strangely now seemed lifeless! Only
dolls!</p>

<p>Fire was leaping to them from draperies and curtains. The fire
was leaping at them as though it were some vengeful spirit of
cleansing flame!</p>

<p>We rushed through the door, the corridor, out into the shop.
Through the corridor and into the shop the flames poured after
us. We ran into the street.</p>

<p>Ricori cried: "Quick! To the car!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the street was red with the light of the flames. I
heard windows opening, and shouts of warning and alarm.</p>

<p>We swung into the waiting car, and it leaped away.</p> <hr>

<p>Three weeks had passed since the death of the doll-maker.
Ricori and I sat at dinner in my home. A silence had fallen
between us. I had broken it with the curious invocation that
begins this, the concluding chapter of my narrative, scarcely
aware that I had spoken aloud. But Ricori looked up, sharply.</p>

<p>"You quote someone? Whom?"</p>

<p>I answered: "A tablet of clay, inscribed by some Chaldean in
the days of Assur-nizir-pal, three thousand years ago."</p>

<p>He said: "And in those few words he has told all our
story!"</p>

<p>"Even so, Ricori. It is all there&mdash;the dolls&mdash;the
unguent &mdash;the torture&mdash;death&mdash;and the cleansing
flame."</p>

<p>He mused: "It is strange, that. Three thousand years
ago&mdash;and even then they knew the evil and its remedy...
'effigies similar to my form... who have taken away my breath...
an ointment of harmful herbs... to my death they have led me... O
God of Fire-destroy them!' It is all our story, Dr. Lowell."</p>

<p>I said: "The death-dolls are far, far older than Ur of the
Chaldees. Older than history. I have followed their trail down
the ages since the night Braile was killed. And it is a long,
long trail, Ricori. They have been found buried deep in the
hearths of the Cro-Magnons, hearths whose fires died twenty
thousand years ago. And they have been found under still colder
hearths of still more ancient peoples. Dolls of flint, dolls of
stone, dolls carved from the mammoth's tusks, from the bones of
the cave bear, from the saber-toothed tiger's fangs. They had the
dark wisdom even then, Ricori."</p>

<p>He nodded: "Once I had a man about me whom I liked well. A
Transylvanian. One day I asked him why he had come to America. He
told me a strange tale. He said that there had been a girl in his
village whose mother, so it was whispered, knew things no
Christian should know. He put it thus, cautiously, crossing
himself. The girl was comely, desirable&mdash;yet he could not
love her. She, it seemed, loved him&mdash;or perhaps it was his
indifference that drew her. One afternoon, coming home from the
hunt, he passed her hut. She called to him. He was thirsty, and
drank the wine she offered him. It was good wine. It made him
gay&mdash;but it did not make him love her.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, he went with her into the hut, and drank more
wine. Laughing, he let her cut hair from his head, pare his
finger-nails, take drops of blood from his wrist, and spittle
from his mouth. Laughing, he left her, and went home, and slept.
When he awakened, it was early evening, and all that he
remembered was that he had drunk wine with the girl, but that was
all.</p>

<p>"Something told him to go to church. He went to church. And as
he knelt, praying, suddenly he did remember more&mdash;remembered
that the girl had taken his hair, his nail parings, his spittle
and his blood. And he felt a great necessity to go to this girl
and to see what she was doing with his hair, his nail parings,
his spittle, his blood. It was as though he said, the Saint
before whom he knelt was commanding him to do this.</p>

<p>"So he stole to the hut of the girl, slipping through the
wood, creeping up to her window. He looked in. She sat at the
hearth, kneading dough as though for bread. He was ashamed that
he had crept so with such thoughts &mdash;but then he saw that
into the dough she was dropping the hair she had cut from him,
the nail parings, the blood, the spittle. She was kneading them
within the dough. Then, as he watched, he saw her take the dough
and model it into the shape of a little man. And she sprinkled
water upon its head, baptizing it in his name with strange words
he could not understand.</p>

<p>"He was frightened, this man. But also he was greatly enraged.
Also he had courage. He watched until she had finished. He saw
her wrap the doll in her apron, and come to the door. She went
out of the door, and away. He followed her&mdash;he had been a
woodsman and knew how to go softly, and she did not know he was
following her. She came to a crossroads. There was a new moon
shining, and some prayer she made to this new moon. Then she dug
a hole, and placed the doll of dough in that hole. And then she
defiled it. After this she said:</p>

<p>"'Zaru (it was this man's name)! Zaru! Zaru! I love you. When
this image is rotted away you must run after me as the dog after
the bitch. You are mine, Zaru, soul and body. As the image rots,
you become mine. When the image is rotted, you are all mine.
Forever and forever and forever!'</p>

<p>"She covered the image with earth. He leaped upon her, and
strangled her. He would have dug up the image, but he heard
voices and was more afraid and ran. He did not go back to the
village. He made his way to America.</p>

<p>"He told me that when he was out a day on that journey, he
felt hands clutching at his loins&mdash;dragging him to the rail,
to the sea. Back to the village, to the girl. By that, he knew he
had not killed her. He fought the hands. Night after night he
fought them. He dared not sleep, for when he slept he dreamed he
was there at the cross-roads, the girl beside him&mdash; and
three times he awakened just in time to check himself from
throwing himself into the sea.</p>

<p>"Then the strength of the hands began to weaken. And at last,
but not for many months, he felt them no more. But still he went,
always afraid, until word came to him from the village. He had
been right&mdash;he had not killed her. But later someone else
did. That girl had what you have named the dark wisdom. Si!
Perhaps it turned against her at the end&mdash;as in the end it
turned against the witch we knew."</p>

<p>I said: "It is curious that you should say that, Ricori...
strange that you should speak of the dark wisdom turning against
the one who commands it... but of that I will speak later. Love
and hate and power&mdash;three lusts&mdash;always these seem to
have been the three legs of the tripod on which burns the dark
flame; the supports of the stage from which the death-dolls
leap...</p>

<p>"Do you know who is the first recorded Maker of Dolls? No?
Well, he was a God, Ricori. His name was Khnum. He was a God long
and long before Yawveh of the Jews, who was also a maker of
dolls, you will recall, shaping two of them in the Garden of
Eden; animating them; but giving them only two inalienable
rights&mdash;first, the right to suffer; second, the right to
die. Khnum was a far more merciful God. He did not deny the right
to die&mdash;but he did not think the dolls should suffer; he
liked to see them enjoy themselves in their brief breathing
space. Khnum was so old that he had ruled in Egypt ages before
the Pyramids or the Sphinx were thought of. He had a brother God
whose name was Kepher, and who had the head of a Beetle. It was
Kepher who sent a thought rippling like a little wind over the
surface of Chaos. That, thought fertilized Chaos, and from it the
world was born...</p>

<p>"Only a ripple over the surface, Ricori! If it had pierced the
skin of Chaos... or thrust even deeper... into its heart... what
might not mankind now be? Nevertheless, rippling, the thought
achieved the superficiality that is man. The work of Khnum
thereafter was to reach into the wombs of women and shape the
body of the child who lay within. They called him the Potter-God.
He it was who, at the command of Amen, greatest of the younger
Gods, shaped the body of the great Queen Hat-shep-sut whom Amen
begot, lying beside her mother in the likeness of the Pharaoh,
her husband. At least, so wrote the priests of her day.</p>

<p>"But a thousand years before this there was a Prince whom
Osiris and Isis loved greatly&mdash;for his beauty, his courage
and his strength. Nowhere on earth, they thought, was there a
woman fit for him. So they called Khnum, the Potter-God, to make
one. He came, with long hands like those of... Madame Mandilip...
like hers, each finger alive. He shaped the clay into a woman so
beautiful that even the Goddess Isis felt a touch of envy. They
were severely practical Gods, those of old Egypt, so they threw
the Prince into a sleep, placed the woman beside him, and
compared&mdash;the word in the ancient papyrus is
'fitted'&mdash;them. Alas! She was not harmonious. She was too
small. So Khnum made another doll. But this was too large. And
not until six were shaped and destroyed was true harmony
attained, the Gods satisfied, the fortunate Prince given his
perfect wife&mdash;who had been a doll.</p>

<p>"Ages after, in the time of Rameses III, it happened that
there was a man who sought for and who found this secret of
Khnum, the Potter-God. He had spent his whole life in seeking it.
He was old and bent and withered; but the desire for women was
still strong within him. All that he knew to do with that secret
of Khnum was to satisfy that desire. But he felt the necessity of
a model. Who were the fairest of women whom he could use as
models? The wives of the Pharaoh, of course. So this man made
certain dolls in the shape and semblance of those who accompanied
the Pharaoh when he visited his wives. Also, he made a doll in
the likeness of the Pharaoh himself; and into this he entered,
animating it. His dolls then carried him into the royal harem,
past the guards, who believed even as did the wives of Pharaoh,
that he was the true Pharaoh. And entertained him
accordingly.</p>

<p>"But, as he was leaving, the true Pharaoh entered. That must
have been quite a situation, Ricori&mdash;suddenly, miraculously,
in his harem, the Pharaoh doubled! But Khnum, seeing what had
happened, reached down from Heaven and touched the dolls,
withdrawing their life. And they dropped to the floor, and were
seen to be only dolls.</p>

<p>"While where one Pharaoh had stood lay another doll and
crouched beside it a shivering and wrinkled old man!</p>

<p>"You can find the story, and a fairly detailed account of the
trial that followed, in a papyrus of the time; now, I think, in
the Turin Museum. Also a catalogue of the tortures the magician
underwent before he was burned. Now, there is no manner of doubt
that there were such accusations, nor that there was such a
trial; the papyrus is authentic. But what, actually, was at the
back of it? Something happened&mdash;but what was it? Is the
story only another record of superstition&mdash;or does it deal
with the fruit of the dark wisdom?"</p>

<p>Ricori said: "You, yourself, watched that dark wisdom fruit.
Are you still unconvinced of its reality?"</p>

<p>I did not answer; I continued: "The knotted cord&mdash;the
Witch's Ladder. That, too, is most ancient. The oldest document
of Frankish legislation, the Salic Law, reduced to written form
about fifteen hundred years ago, provided the severest penalties
for those who tied what it named the Witch's Knot-"</p>

<p><i>"La scala della strega,"</i> he said. "Well, do we know
that cursed thing in my land&mdash;and to our black sorrow!"</p>

<p>I took startled note of his pallid face, his twitching
fingers; I said, hastily: "But of course, Ricori, you realize
that all I have been quoting is legend? Folklore. With no proven
basis of scientific fact."</p>

<p>He thrust his chair back, violently, arose, stared at me,
incredulously. He spoke, with effort: "You still hold that the
devil-work we witnessed can be explained in terms of the science
you know?"</p>

<p>I stirred, uncomfortably: "I did not say that, Ricori. I do
say that Madame Mandilip was as extraordinary a hypnotist as she
was a murderess &mdash;a mistress of illusion-"</p>

<p>He interrupted me, hands clenching the table's edge: "You
think her dolls were illusions?"</p>

<p>I answered, obliquely: "You know how real was that illusion of
a beautiful body. Yet we saw it dissolve in the true reality of
the flames. It had seemed as veritable as the dolls, Ricori-"</p>

<p>Again he interrupted me: "The stab in my heart... the doll
that killed Gilmore... the doll that murdered Braile... the
blessed doll that slew the witch! You call them illusions?"</p>

<p>I answered, a little sullenly, the old incredulity suddenly
strong within me: "It is entirely possible that, obeying a post-
hypnotic command of the doll-maker, you, yourself, thrust the
dagger-pin into your own heart! It is possible that obeying a
similar command, given when and where and how I do not know,
Peters' sister, herself, killed her husband. The chandelier fell
on Braile when I was, admittedly, under the influence of those
same post-hypnotic influences&mdash;and it is possible that it
was a sliver of glass that cut his carotid. As for the doll-
maker's own death, apparently at the hands of the Walters doll,
well, it is also possible that the abnormal mind of Madame
Mandilip was, at times, the victim of the same illusions she
induced in the minds of others. The doll-maker was a mad genius,
governed by a morbid compulsion to surround herself with the
effigies of those she had killed by the unguent. Marguerite de
Valois, Queen of Navarre, carried constantly with her the
embalmed hearts of a dozen or more lovers who had died for her.
She had not slain those men&mdash;but she knew she had been the
cause of their deaths as surely as though she had strangled them
with her own hands. The psychological principle involved in Queen
Marguerite's collection of hearts and Madame Mandilip's
collection of dolls is one and the same."</p>

<p>He had not sat down; still in that strained voice he repeated:
"I asked you if you called the killing of the witch an
illusion."</p>

<p>I said: "You make it very uncomfortable for me,
Ricori&mdash;staring at me like that... and I am answering your
question. I repeat it is possible that in her own mind she was at
times the victim of the same illusions she induced in the minds
of others. That at times she, herself, thought the dolls were
alive. That in this strange mind was conceived a hatred for the
doll of Walters. And, at the last, under the irritation of our
attack, this belief reacted upon her. That thought was in my mind
when, a while ago, I said it was curious that you should speak of
the dark wisdom turning against those who possessed it. She
tormented the doll; she expected the doll to avenge itself if it
had the opportunity. So strong was this belief, or expectation,
that when the favorable moment arrived, she dramatized it. Her
thought became action! The doll-maker, like you, may well have
plunged the dagger-pin into her own throat&mdash; "</p>

<p>"You fool!"</p>

<p>The words came from Ricori's mouth&mdash;and yet it was so
like Madame Mandilip speaking in her haunted room and speaking
through the dead lips of Laschna that I dropped back into my
chair, shuddering.</p>

<p>Ricori was leaning over the table. His black eyes were blank,
expressionless. I cried out, sharply, a panic shaking me:
"Ricori&mdash; wake&mdash; "</p>

<p>The dreadful blankness in his eyes flicked away; their gaze
sharpened, was intent upon me. He said, again in his own
voice:</p>

<p>"I am awake, I am so awake&mdash;that I will listen to you no
more! Instead&mdash;listen, you to me, Dr. Lowell. I say to
you&mdash;to hell with your science! I tell you this&mdash;that
beyond the curtain of the material at which your vision halts,
there are forces and energies that hate us, yet which God in his
inscrutable wisdom permits to be. I tell you that these powers
can reach through the veil of matter and become manifest in
creatures like the doll-maker. It is so! Witches and sorcerers
hand in hand with evil! It is so! And there are powers friendly
to us which make themselves manifest in their chosen ones.</p>

<p>"I say to you&mdash;Madame Mandilip was an accursed witch! An
instrument of the evil powers! Whore of Satan! She burned as a
witch should burn in hell &mdash;forever! I say to you that the
little nurse was an instrument of the good powers. And she is
happy today in Paradise&mdash;as she shall be forever!"</p>

<p>He was silent, trembling with his own fervor. He touched my
shoulder:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Dr. Lowell&mdash;tell me as truthfully as though you
stood before the seat of God, believing in Him as I
believe&mdash;do those scientific explanations of yours truly
satisfy you?"</p>

<p>I answered, very quietly:</p>

<p>"No, Ricori."</p>

<p>Nor do they.</p>
