<h2><a name="ch-00" id="ch-00"></a>Victoria's Unspoiled Alpine
Kingdom</h2>

<p>Though Victoria has mountain scenery equal to any in the world,
it is only in recent years that it has been fully appreciated and
developed. Every kind of scenery is scattered throughout the many
mountain ranges&mdash;in them is repeated the rugged grandeur of
the Scottish hill country, the immense vistas of the Alps, and the
snow-capped peaks of Switzerland.</p>

<p>Most of these resorts can be reached by train. Others are within
easy travelling distance of a railway, and to these regular car
services are maintained throughout the tourist season.</p>

<p>For all, the mountains are splendid. For those seeking a change
from the sea-side holiday, they are ideal.</p>

<p class="cp"><img alt="" src=
"1402801h-images/VictoriaPeaks03.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">The famous Buffalo Chalet (4,400 feet above sea
level) is built practically on the edge of the Buffalo Gorge, over
which the waters of the Crystal Brook leap in a sheer drop of 750
feet. The Gorge is one of the most awe-inspiring sights one could
imagine&mdash;only five minutes' walk from the comfort and
conveniences of the most up-to-date guest house in Australia.</p>

<hr>

<p class="cp"><img alt="" src=
"1402801h-images/VictoriaPeaks04.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">1&mdash;Mountain mists lend an air of
enchantment to the Chalet at Mount Buffalo. 2&mdash;A fine fleet of
cars with expert drivers is maintained for the conveyance of
visitors from the railway to the plateau. 3&mdash;Morning sunshine
on the Chalet gives it an imposing appearance. 4&mdash;The spacious
Chalet verandah is the regular rendezvous for guests each morning
before setting out on the excursions for the day. 5&mdash;There are
some delightful walks which are enhanced by the beauty of the snow.
6&mdash;A motor snow-plow keeps the mountain road open right
through the winter. 7&mdash;Motors of all descriptions make the
trip to the Chalet. 8&mdash;Cosy bungalows close by the Chalet are
available for special parties or for families.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>MT. BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK</h2>

<p>The Mount Buffalo National Park is a little more than 200 miles
by rail north-eastward from Melbourne, and is reached from either
Porepunkah or Bright by road. The Railway Department, which
operates the commodious Chalet on Mount Buffalo, runs a regular
motor service between the railway and the summit of the mount.
Comfortable cars are used, and arrangements can be made for
transfer direct from the train to the Chalet.</p>

<p>Mount Buffalo National Park is the finest mountain resort in
Australia. It has an altitude of 5645 feet, and offers a diversity
of magnificent mountain scenery, including gorges, waterfalls,
colossal granite masses, fern gullies, and lakes and streams
teeming with trout. At all seasons it is a wonderful holiday
playground. Its winter snow and ice sports are thrilling. The
wildflowers in spring and summer are exquisite.</p>

<p>Accommodation is provided at the entirely modern Chalet,
controlled by the Victorian Railway Department, away up thousands
of feet on the plateau, and in close proximity to the head of the
famous Buffalo Gorge.</p>

<p>There is hardly a road in Australia more picturesque than that
connecting the railway and main road in the valley with the
plateau. Every yard is an inspiration, and almost the whole
well-graded, sinuous 20 miles from Bright through Porepunkah to the
Plateau, is a realm of scenic wonder.</p>

<p>The road crosses the Eurobin Creek at a point a short distance
below the Eurobin and Ladies' Bath Falls.</p>

<p>The Eurobin Fails, reached by an easy walk beside a mountain
stream, are formed by the water which flows from the Plateau
through a deep glen.</p>

<p>On the course of the Falls Creek, as the stream flowing from the
foot of the Buffalo Gorge is called, occurs the beautiful spectacle
known as the Ladies' Bath Fails. These are about 40 feet deep, the
water dropping into a rocky basin, several hundred yards from the
Eurobin Falls.</p>

<p>Skirting the eastern bank of the Eurobin Creek, the road rises
gradually. About a mile and a half beyond Buffalo Falls House a
magnificent view of the 1700 feet "drop" and the Buffalo Falls is
obtained.</p>

<p>About seven miles from its start the road comes on to a clear
spot called Mackey's Lookout (named after a former Minister for
Lands). From this point a wonderful panoramic view is obtained.</p>

<p>There is a sharp turn from here, and the way leads through
granite country, past Staker's Lookout (named after a tourist
pioneer of the mountain), then over the crest, and the plateau is
reached. A small plain is traversed, a bridge spanning the aptly
named Crystal Brook is crossed, and suddenly around a sweeping turn
the Chalet comes into view.</p>

<p class="cp"><img alt="" src=
"1402801h-images/VictoriaPeaks05.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">One of the finest views at Mount Buffalo is that
from Bent's Lookout (4,400 feet) near the front of the Chalet.
Immediately below are the cultivated fields in the Buckland Valley.
In the dim distance are the glistening snow-capped peaks of the
Australian Alps, including Mount Kosciusko, (7,328 feet) the
highest peak in Australia.</p>

<h2>MT. BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK&mdash;IN SEASON AT ALL SEASONS</h2>

<h3>Spring&mdash;Summer&mdash;Autumn</h3>

<p>Mount Buffalo National Park has been aptly termed "The Garden of
the Gods." At every turn there are views to give pleasure to the
eye. The beautiful walks are an unending delight, whether
undertaken in winter or summer.</p>

<p>Everywhere there is the music of crystal-clear streams and of
noisy waterfalls. Even when the air is calm on these exalted
altitudes, the faint murmur of the wind in the forests beneath
intensifies the sense of splendid isolation that is one of
Buffalo's strongest attractions.</p>

<p>Mt. Buffalo is an all-the-year-round resort. Although it earned
its reputation as a winter resort, its beauties are by no means
confined to that season of the year. On the hottest day in summer
the temperature is seldom above 75 degrees. Spring is
wonderful&mdash;the wildflowers bloom in splendid profusion; in
fact, summer is a continuous springtime, with its cool atmosphere
and mild sunshine. Autumn, with its pure revitalising mountain
breezes, shows another phase of Buffalo where one breathes air of
champagne, and after sleeping peacefully, rises invigorated to
welcome holiday exercise.</p>

<p>Within two minutes' walk of the front of the Chalet, on the flat
surface of an enormous granite boulder, is Bent's Lookout (altitude
4400 feet). Safely here from a railed enclosure is overlooked the
stupendous chasm of the Buffalo Gorge.</p>

<h3>Fine Panorama of Mountains</h3>

<p>Eighty-five miles distant is the faint outline of Mount
Kosciusko (altitude 7328 feet)&mdash;the highest peak in Australia.
In the middle distance stands Mount Bogong (6509 feet), and to the
right Mounts Fainter (6160 feet) Feathertop (6306 feet), and Hotham
(6100 feet).</p>

<p>Immediately below are the Eurobin Falls and the winding ruddy
ribbon of the road in the Buckland Valley.</p>

<p>The Gorge close by consists of two stupendous cliffs of solid
granite, varying in depth from 1200 to 1700 feet, over which
thunder in a sheer leap of 1700 feet the waters of the famous
Buffalo Falls.</p>

<p>Lake Catani (named after a former Engineer for Public Works, who
thought out and supervised the scheme) is an attractive 60-acre
sheet of water. It is surrounded by low hills, with trees right to
the water's edge.</p>

<p>In the seasons, boating, bathing, trout fishing or skating are
eagerly enjoyed. The trout fishing is splendid.</p>

<h3>Supreme Winter Resort</h3>

<p>Mount Buffalo National Park has no rival in Australia as a
winter resort. All snow sports may be indulged in there under
conditions equal to the best resorts on the Continent.</p>

<p>In winter the lake is frozen to a depth of eight inches, and
skating is most popular.</p>

<p>Toboganning and ski-running give endless frolicsome sport during
the snow season. Adjoining the lake are two excellent toboggan
runs.</p>

<p>Anything more picturesque than the lake with its moving group of
skaters and rushing toboggans it would be hard to imagine.</p>

<p>Overlooking the lake on a high point is the Monolith&mdash;a
huge granite boulder, 30 feet high, and balanced on the edge of a
mighty rocky outcrop. A stairway gives access to its lofty
rail-protected summit.</p>

<h3>The Horn&mdash;The Highest Peak</h3>

<p>Seven miles distant in a south-westerly direction is The Horn
(altitude 5645 feet). It is the highest peak on the Plateau, and is
the objective of one of the finest trips which may be made during a
stay on the mountain because of the unforgettable views. The last
mile to the lookout is a real mountaineering adventure, with good,
but entirely safe, climbing. Tourists make the trip to The Horn a
day's outing, but they may stay the night there in a specially
provided and suitably furnished cottage.</p>

<p>The Leviathan Rock, on the way to The Horn, is believed to be
the largest single stone in Australia, and is estimated to contain
30,000 tons of granite. It is 75 feet high, 150 feet long, and 60
feet broad, and rests on a base of about six feet.</p>

<p>These are but a few of the places to be seen by visitors making
a week's stay. There are many other points of interest for those
who can stay longer. There are wonderful fern glades, cascades and
forests&mdash;in short, charm and wonder are everywhere.</p>

<p>For the nights the social life at the Chalet is full of
throbbing pleasure. There is something for every visitor&mdash;snug
lounges, music, dancing in a spacious ball-room, and all modern
comfort. Quiet pleasure or rollicking gaiety provides irresistible
appeal for everyone.</p>

<p>The Chalet has all the conveniences of a city hotel, and is
complete with hot and cold water services, ample bathrooms,
electric light, billiard rooms, drying rooms, and efficient
sewerage. It can accommodate 201 people.</p>

<p class="cp">(<b>See plan of Mt. Buffalo Plateau, at the <a href=

</p>

<p class="caption">It is a majestic sight looking upward across the
waving tree tops to the scar on the face of the Buffalo Gorge. This
scar is really the waters of the Crystal Brook tumbling from the
Plateau to the depths of the Gorge. Towering cliffs on either side
give that impression of grandeur which can be seen only at Mount
Buffalo.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>MYRTLEFORD DISTRICT OFFERS GOOD
FISHING</h2>

<p>Myrtleford is a small township on the Myrtle Creek close to its
junction with the Ovens River, 177 miles from Melbourne, on the
Wangaratta-Bright branch railway line. Good cod and perch fishing
is to be had in the Buffalo River, and trout are taken in the Nug
Nug, Sandy, and Happy Valley Creeks.</p>

<p>Among the waterfalls are those on the Nug Nug Creek. The water
in the Lily Falls on the Buffalo Creek has a drop of 200 feet. The
Twin Falls are a mile further up the same stream.</p>

<p>Although seldom availed of, this may be made the starting point
for the trip to the Buffalo Plateau. The route lies westward to the
Buffalo River. A rough track leaving the Buffalo River road leads
along the ridge of a spur of the range and gives access to the
summit of the plateau at a point between Mount Dunne and Pulpit
Rock, the "back door of the mountain."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>POREPUNKAH AND BRIGHT</h2>

<p>Porepunkah and Bright, four miles apart, have assumed importance
as the points from which the Buffalo Plateau can best be reached.
In and around each there is plenty to interest the visitor.
Porepunkah is the nearest railway point to the mountain.</p>

<p>Bright is much the larger township. It is the railway terminus,
196 miles from Melbourne, and the centre of an ideal tourist
district. It lies on the Ovens River, with picturesque mountains on
the north, south and east.</p>

<p>A pleasant walk is that to The Gap. Splendid views are obtained
on the way of Bright, the Wandiligong Valley, and Mount Bogong.
From The Gap a further trail leads upward to a spot known as the
Landslip. On account of the very fine outlook to be obtained from
Clearspot (3500 feet), the trip is well worth making.</p>

<p>The drive through the Buckland Valley is charming in the highest
degree. It is the oldest inhabited part. In 1857 the Buckland riot
took place here, when the European population drove the Chinese off
the goldfield in a body.</p>

<p class="cp"><img alt="" src=
"1402801h-images/VictoriaPeaks07.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">Porepunkah, 192 miles from Melbourne, is one of
the terminal stations for tourists going to Mount Buffalo. It is
the centre of a rich valley district. The Ovens River flows
nearby.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>MOUNT FEATHERTOP&mdash;6306 FEET
ABOVE SEA LEVEL</h2>

<p class="cp"><img alt="" src=
"1402801h-images/VictoriaPeaks08.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">Mount Feathertop may be truly described as one
of the most beautiful mountains in Victoria. Views are obtained of
the surrounding country for miles around. There are some wonderful
ski-runs, and the snow sports enthusiast will find ample scope for
his prowess.</p>

<p>Mount Feathertop has always been the objective of the more
venturesome tourist, but in the last few years it is attaining
greater popularity, especially as a company has been formed with
the object of establishing a Chalet at Mount Feathertop. A
temporary bungalow has been erected, and tourists who desire to
spend a holiday at this lofty resort can arrange to do so.</p>

<p>Combined rail, car and accommodation tickets are available at
the Government Tourist Bureau. The train journey is made to Bright,
thence by car to Harrietville, 16 miles along the Ovens Valley,
where a change is made to horses.</p>

<p>Then follows an interesting seven miles circuitous ride up the
mountain along the bridle track. It is a ride with attractions all
its own. At each turn a new spot of scenic beauty is revealed,
until at last the bungalow is reached.</p>

<p>The bungalow is about a mile from the summit of the mountain,
whence wonderful views of the surrounding peaks and the valleys are
obtainable.</p>

<p class="cp"><img alt="" src=
"1402801h-images/VictoriaPeaks09.jpg">
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>BEECHWORTH</h2>

<p>Beechworth is the principal town in the Ovens district, 172
miles from Melbourne, and 1775 feet above sea level. The rail route
is by way of the Sydney line to Wangaratta, where trains are
changed. It has romantic gold mining memories. Beechworth has
gained a wide reputation for beautiful mountain scenery, fine
panoramic views and invigorating mountain air.</p>

<p>Adjacent to the town are many fascinating walks, where Nature
has piled rocks in various fantastic forms. Among the many
attractive outings is that to One Tree Hill, about a mile from the
town. Ingram's Rock is only about a mile and a half from the town,
and because of the almost level walking along tree-shaded paths, is
a favourite resort.</p>

<p>Buckland's Gap is four miles from Beechworth on the road to
Myrtleford and Bright. From here a fine view can be obtained of the
Blue Alps.</p>

<p>Ten miles out of Beechworth another point of observation is
Mount Pilot. It is considered to be the finest lookout position,
being higher and better situated than One Tree Hill.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>STANLEY</h2>

<p>Stanley, a town at the foot of Mount Stanley, is reached by a
pleasant drive of about seven miles from Beechworth. Stanley is
about 700 feet above Beechworth and the Sugarloaf Mountain. the
Mount Stanley fern gullies, Rose Creek and Hillsborough are among
the many attractions for the tourist.</p>

<hr>

<h2>YACKANDANDAH</h2>

<p>"The Eden of Victoria" is the name sometimes given to
Yackandandah. It is in the north-eastern district, 184 miles by
rail from Melbourne, and is reached by way of Wangaratta and
Beechworth. The township is 1003 feet above sea level, and
possesses an unrivalled summer and winter climate. The surrounding
country is mountainous, but the township is situated on sloping
ground at the junction of the Yackandandah and Commissioner
Creeks.</p>

<p>Among the picturesque spots are the Indigo Falls about seven
miles- out. Brown's Gap is 15 miles from Yackandandah.</p>

<hr>

<h2>TALLANGATTA</h2>

<p>Pleasantly situated 212½ miles by rail north-east of Melbourne,
and not far from the Murray, Tallangatta, a fair-sized town, stands
in the midst of the hills at the junction of the Tallangatta Creek
and the Mitta Mitta River. There is ample accommodation, and many
enjoyable drives may he made in every direction amid charming
scenery.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic mountaineers will find much interesting country to
explore. one of the trips being to Mt. Kosciusko, over the New
South Wales border.</p>

<p>Guides are available, but it is inadvisable to undertake the
trip in winter, when the snow is likely to render the route
impassable.</p>

<p>The district is one that appeals strongly to the artist and the
sportsman, the scenery being magnificent, and the shooting
excellent. The mountain streams have been well stocked with English
trout for many years.</p>

<hr>

<h2>TRAWOOL, GRANITE AND YEA</h2>

<p>Trawool and Granite are on the Goulburn River within several
miles of each other, and a little more than 60 miles from
Melbourne. They are on the Mansfield railway line, which branches
off from the main north-eastern line at Tallarook.</p>

<p>These places are chiefly availed of by sportsmen, who either
make their headquarters here or camp in the vicinity, there being
plenty of sport for both rod and gun.</p>

<p>Yea, 80 miles from Melbourne, lies at the foot of a range of
hills on the Yea River. It is a popular rendezvous for sportsmen,
and has trout streams that offer good sport. Other good streams are
the Murrundindi River, which has a three-mile stretch of rapids, in
which the trout are good game, the Falls Creek, and the head waters
of the King Parrott and Silver Creeks.</p>

<p>One of the finest sights in the district is the Wilhelmina
Falls, about 17 miles out of the township on the Murrundindi
River.</p>

<p class="cp"><img alt="" src=
"1402801h-images/VictoriaPeaks10.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">Mount Feathertop is one of the few peaks in
Victoria which has snow during the summer months. For the tourist
desiring something entirely new and novel in the way of a holiday
this locality is recommended.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>ALEXANDRA ONE OF OUR OLDEST
TOWNSHIPS</h2>

<p>Prettily circled by a chain of mountains, Alexandra has an
appeal all its own. It is one of the oldest townships in the State.
Surrounding it is some fine pastoral country. Along the Goulburn
River is considerable cultivation.</p>

<p>Leaving the town and going into the hills, the tourist will find
good accommodation at Thornton, seven miles out, or at Taggerty, 11
miles in a southerly direction at the foot of the Cathedral Peak
and at the junction of the Acheron and Little Rivers. There are
many choice camping grounds in the district, with good fishing
streams. Rabbits are plentiful, and afford good shooting. There are
waterfowl in season for the gun.</p>

<h3>Delightful Excursions Around Alexandra</h3>

<p>Tourists fond of walking will find many delightful excursions
around Alexandra. From Brooks' Cutting, three miles distant, the
best view of the whole of the Goulburn Valley is obtained; while
from Mount Prospect, 1075 feet, three miles away, the lover of good
scenery can look down upon the township and away across the
Cathedral Mount.</p>

<p>The Royston Falls (18 miles) and the Rubicon Fails (15½ miles)
are reached through the Rubicon Forest (declared by experts to be
the finest forest in Victoria), by way of Thornton, where the road
turning to the right is followed. After passing the Rubicon Bridge
a sign post indicates the way. The Rubicon Falls are set in the
midst of delightful scenery.</p>

<h3>A Fern Glade of Entrancing Beauty</h3>

<p>Passing along an alternative track on the east branch of the
river one enters a fern glade of entrancing beauty. A few hundred
yards further on towers the massive Elephant Rock, a huge monolith,
which projects over the outcrop nearly 30 feet.</p>

<p>The route to the Snob's Creek Falls (14 miles) is by the main
road to Upper Thornton, the turn-off being indicated by a sign post
about 12 miles from the town.</p>

<p>The return to Melbourne may be made by way of Marysville and
Healesville, a car journey of 50 miles. The roads are good, and the
route embraces some fine scenery, including the famous Blacks'
Spur. Healesville is the entraining station for Melbourne.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>MANSFIELD HAS A HEALTHY BRACING
CLIMATE</h2>

<p>Mansfield has been described as the capital of the Upper
Goulburn. It is 131 miles by rail from Melbourne and is the
terminus of the line branching from the main north-eastern line at
Tallarook. The township is in a basin surrounded by a fringe of
beautiful green hills and mountains, some of which are snow-capped
during the winter. Mansfield is noted for its healthy, bracing
climate.</p>

<p>In the surrounding district is scenery of a rough and rugged
nature. Mount Buller (6000 feet) stands out as a prominent
landmark. It is approached through Merrijig, from which it is 12
miles distant. Horses and guides can be engaged here for the
ascent.</p>

<p>Power's Lookout, named in the early days after a bushranger of
that name, is a prominent cliff, from which a magnificent panoramic
view of the surrounding country can be obtained.</p>

<p>Merrijig, a pretty village 11 miles from Mansfield, on the
Delatite River, has some of the best trout fishing in the State.
The Howqua River is a burbling mountain stream, with clear,
beautiful ponds. It is nine miles fro Merrijig to the nearest point
on the river, which has gained for itself a reputation for
providing excellent rainbow trout sport.</p>

<p>Mount Cobbler (5347 feet) and Mount Howitt (5715 feet) are each
about 25 miles distant, and, with the shorter trip to Mount Buller,
form objectives for mountaineering excursions. These mountains are
snow-covered in winter, and are rapidly becoming very popular with
devotees of snow sports, such as skiing.</p>

<p>It is from Mansfield that many of the more venturesome start on
excursions through the little-known mountain fastnesses of eastern
Victoria. The climb to Mount Howitt is full of excitement. The
track curves round steep ravines, and crosses and re-crosses the
river as it winds amid the mighty peaks.</p>

<p>In places the ledge on the cliff is just wide enough for a horse
to pass; on one side massive walls of granite tower above, on the
other there is a sheer drop of hundreds of feet to the valley
below. As the head of the stream is neared the country grows
wilder.</p>

<p>When the crest of Mount Howitt is reached, the view is
unforgettable. Instead of the accustomed ridges or conical peak of
the ordinary mountain, a large plain is revealed, covered with
snowgrass and dotted with cattle.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>BRIGHT TO OME0&mdash;ACROSS THE
AUSTRALIAN ALPS</h2>

<p>What is claimed to be the highest coach road in Australia
extends for 97 miles in north-eastern Victoria through some of the
most picturesque and impressive mountain scenery in the State. It
is, unfortunately, not passable in the winter, because, on account
of its great altitude, it is then snow-covered. It provides a
wonderful tour in summer, however, realising the ideal combination
of continuity and change.</p>

<p>Motorists have found the trip irresistibly fascinating within
the last few years, and the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria has
used this route for its motor reliability trials.</p>

<p>This route forms portion of a fine tour by rail from Melbourne
to Bright in the north-east, or to Bruthen, in Gippsland, and then
across the Alps by road. The road trip consists of two main
sections centred on Omeo.</p>

<p>From the rail terminus at Bright to Harrietville is 16 miles
over a level road, running between the mountains parallel with the
Ovens River, and passing through the small hamlet of Freeburgh.
Climbing commences soon after leaving Harrietville, and an altitude
of 4000 feet is reached within four miles.</p>

<p>Thirty miles from Bright at The Hospice, Mount St. Bernard, the
height is 5060 feet, or 3998 feet above Bright.</p>

<p>A favourite excursion from The Hospice is to Mount Hotham, six
miles distant, where a wonderful view is obtained from the summit.
A long narrow ridge rises up towards Mount Feathertop. Away to the
north Mount Bogong, Victoria's highest peak&mdash;6509
feet&mdash;rears its mighty form amid an ocean of mountain
tops.</p>

<p>All around is splendid grandeur. Other points that can be
visited if the tourist has time are Mount Freezeout, The Twins, and
the Bogong High Plains, 5000 feet above sea level. In winter these
places are the resort of ski-ing enthusiasts, who have formed a
club in Victoria.</p>

<p>By the service car (summer season only) Bright to Omeo is now a
one-day trip. Tourists may leave Bright at 8.30 am. on Tuesday and
Friday and arrive at Omeo at 4 p.m. same day. The road follows east
from The Hospice, and traverses the southern end of Mount Smythe,
thence along the western slope of Mount Blowhard until near Mount
Hotham. The first ten miles of this section of the road excites
fervent admiration.</p>

<p>In some places, notably at Mount Blowhard, the road is little
more than the width of a vehicle. Below are great cliffs and
yawning chasms, down which the traveller looks 1000 to 1500
feet.</p>

<p>Leaving Mount Hotham, the road is on a falling grade. Victoria
River, a good trout stream, is passed. The falls on this river,
about five miles distant, are a fine spectacle, especially when the
river is in flood.</p>

<p>After minor ups and downs, the road plunges through a little
creek, and climbs Mount Livingstone, a very tall peak. It is a long
pull up, and a delightfully varied road down, winding around
countless spurs, and giving occasional glimpses of Omeo nestling in
a bower of hills.</p>

</p>

<p>There is a regular motor service between Omeo and Bruthen (190
miles by rail to Melbourne), forming the second portion of the link
by road in the circular tour from Melbourne to Melbourne, by way of
the Alps, Omeo, and the Tambo Valley. Cars leave Omeo, and after a
gradual climb of nine miles reach the crest of the Dividing Range
(2700 feet).</p>

<p>Running through the mining townships of Cassilis and Tongio
West, the cars continue through Swift's Creek to Doctor's Flat, and
then to Tambo Crossing.</p>

<p>Tambo Crossing is the turning off point for the sequestered
mining village of Stirling, and here also is the commencement of
the famous rich Tambo River flats. The scenery all the way is most
arresting.</p>

<p>It is level running then to Double Bridges, and to the rail
connection point at Bruthen, whence the way to the metropolis lies
open by rail all the way, 190 miles, or by rail to Bairnsdale,
steamer via Lakes Entrance, through the beautiful Gippsland Lakes,
to Sale, and then by rail to Melbourne.</p>

<p>Bruthen is a thriving little town, and the outlet for the
agricultural and pastoral production of a big district. Bairnsdale
and Sale are populous towns, with fine business interests, and the
centres of wealthy farming districts.</p>

<p>As already indicated, the round trip may be made in the reverse
direction, by train from Melbourne to Bruthen, then by car through
the Tambo Valley to Omeo and across the Alps to Bright, and return
to Melbourne by train.</p>

<p>The return portions of railway excursion tickets issued from
Melbourne to Bright may be used from Bruthen, Bairnsdale and
Sale.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>OMEO TO TALLANGATTA</h2>

<p>Tallangatta may also be reached via Omeo, and the grand scenery
along the route is claimed by some to equal, if not to excel, that
across the Alps. There is, however, no regular service throughout
the whole of the distance, and special arrangements have to be made
for at least one of the stages.</p>

<p>A little more than 100 miles is covered by vehicle. The Anglers'
Rest Hotel, 14 miles from Omeo, is the first stopping place. Within
half a mile of the hotel is the Cobungra Creek. The Bundarrah River
is a quarter of a mile, and the Big or Mitta Mitta River, half a
mile distant. There is good fishing in all these streams, and the
last named river can be fished with waders for 30 miles.</p>

<p>Sportsmen who make Anglers' Rest Hotel their headquarters can,
by communicating with the proprietor in advance, arrange to be met
at Omeo.</p>

<p>Exploration of the Bogong High Plains may also be conducted from
here. It would be well to have the services of a guide for trips of
this nature. There are many waterfalls, and a spot locally known as
The Ruined Castle, with remarkable features caused by volcanic
action, may be inspected.</p>

<p>From the Anglers' Rest Hotel the road closely follows the course
of the Mitta Mitta River. The river is crossed by a bridge three
miles from the Glen Wills township, the end of the stage coach
journey, 35 miles from Omeo.</p>

<p>Sunnyside, three miles by road or one mile by a steep foot track
farther on, is 1000 feet higher than Glen Wills. Accommodation is
available at the Mount Wills Hotel.</p>

<p>It is a stiff climb to the top of Mount Wills (5758 feet), but a
magnificent view is the reward at the summit.</p>

<h3>Picturesque Township of Mitta Mitta</h3>

<p>An early start should be made from Sunnyside for Mitta Mitta, a
section of the trip for which special transport arrangements may be
necessary. A halt is made at Lightning Creek, 22 miles from Glen
Wills. A descent of 500 feet in the next nine miles is made, and
the traveller is then in Snowy Creek township, or, as it is
sometimes called, Granite Flat.</p>

<p>A track, which provides another means of reaching Mount Bogong,
has been cleared from here to the summit, distant about 18 miles.
This track can be easily followed on foot, and is negotiable for a
pack horse.</p>

<p>After a six-mile stretch along a level road the picturesque
township of Mitta Mitta is reached. From here there is a daily
motor service to Tallangatta, 38 miles away.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>OMEO&mdash;A TYPICAL OLD MINING
TOWN</h2>

<p>Omeo, an old mining town now, through the falling-off of gold
production, is a shadow of its former self. It is the principal
township in the Australian Alps and the centre from which roads or
tracks radiate to Bright, Tallangatta, Mount Kosciusko, to the
wonderful caves on the Limestone Creek, to Bruthen, and
Bairnsdale.</p>

<p>The winding main street is characteristic of an old mining
township. Like most of such places it originated with a few canvas
tents. They dotted the banks of the Livingstone Creek in the days
when the Omeo diggings were famous for their richness.</p>

<p>Omeo is 2100 feet above sea level, and is linked with the
railway on the south at Bruthen, and on the north at Bright, by
motor services. The district is a fine cattle grazing area, and is
popular with anglers, there being three good trout streams to
choose from.</p>

<p>Fourteen miles out is Lake Omeo, about two miles long by one
mile wide. Past its shores runs the well-made roadway to
Benambra.</p>

<p>Mount Bogong is 35 miles distant from Omeo, and can be easily
reached. The first 29 miles, to Middle Creek, can be covered by car
passing Anglers' Rest Hotel, 14 miles out. This house is within
half a mile of three fine, swift-running streams, each of which
abound with Loch Leven, Rainbow, and Brown Trout.</p>

<p>From Middle Creek the last six miles to the top of the Mount is
covered either on horseback or on foot.</p>

<p>The Marble Caves on the Limestone River should be included in
the itinerary of this Alpine Tour. They are about 40 miles from
Omeo, and are approached by a fair road by way of Mount Leinster
for 25 miles, thence by a rough bush track. Buggies can be driven
the whole way the last three miles being on a very steep down grade
to the Limestone River flat.</p>

<p class="cp"><img alt="" src=
"1402801h-images/VictoriaPeaks15.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">Romance is associated with Omeo, one of the
oldest mining towns in Victoria. It is the radial point for roads
and tracks leading to the mountains in the Alpine district.</p>

<p>Solid marble forms the entrance to the Marble Arch Cave. Inside
the scene is unforgettably impressive. These caves are not yet
opened up as a regular tourist objective, but are destined to
become an outstanding feature of an Alpine holiday.</p>

<p>Mount Kosciusko can be reached from Omeo. The distance is 75
miles, and the trip takes about five days. The first 25 miles is to
Mount Leinster, but the rest of the journey must be made either on
horseback or on foot. There is no accommodation en route, and
tourist must provide themselves with camping outfits and carry all
necessary provisions.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>MOUNTS BEN CAIRN AND DONNA
BUANG</h2>

<p>One of the finest mountain holidays which one may enjoy adjacent
to Melbourne is at Warburton, in the Yarra valley, 48 miles front
Melbourne. Towering above Warburton are Mounts Ben Cairn (3400
feet) and Donna Buang&mdash;the hill of the crow&mdash;4080 feet.
These may be made the objective for walking tours, or they may he
visited by motor, a fine tourist road climbing the range and
connecting with both peaks.</p>

<p>A well-made road runs a winding length of 12 miles to the summit
of Mount Donna Buang, but the trip may be made in a steeper six
miles by those capable and desirous of making the trip on foot.</p>

<p>From the top where a lookout platform with a ladder of access
has been erected, a wide and far-flung view is
obtained&mdash;partly forest, partly cleared valley of the Yarra
just below, to the distant heights of the Baw Baw plateau with its
elevation of 5000 feet, and stretching still further eastward into
Gippsland.</p>

<p>A fine motor tour is from Warburton to Launching Place, thence
to Healesville road at a point known as Panton's Gap, and thence
running in an easterly direction to Ben Cairn, a huge granite
outcrop, overlooking the Yarra Valley.</p>

<p>From Ben Cairn the road follows just below the crest of the
mountains between the two peaks.</p>

<p>Along the route splendid views of the valleys and glens are
obtained, and on the descent from Mount Donna Buang the road winds
through glorious forest glades of myrtle, mountain ash and
eucalypts. In many places the boughs interlacing above form a
magnificent archway.</p>

<p>From Mount Donna Buang, the road drops more than 3000 feet in 10
miles. Six miles of the road from Mount Donna Buang to what is
known as the Turn Table, at the junction of the Cement Creek road,
has been named the Lovers' Drive.</p>

<p>From Cement Creek one may traverse the road along the Acheron
Valley, one of the most beautiful forest and mountain drives in the
State. The grades are easy, and for miles the road winds along the
slope of the ranges through virgin forest at a level of 2500
feet.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>THE BAW BAW RANGES FOR WILD
SCENERY</h2>

<p>Lovers of wild scenery, natural colour, and mountain life will
find all on the 71-mile tourist route which commences at Warburton,
the train terminus on the picturesque Upper Yarra, 48 miles east of
Melbourne, and ends at the mining township of Walhalla, another
rail terminus.</p>

<p>A tourist map giving details of distances, landmarks, and
camping sites is available at the Tourist Bureau.</p>

<p>The first stage of the journey from Warburton is along the main
road to Woods Point, passing up the Yarra Valley and overlooking
the bends and reaches of the river.</p>

<p>The Upper Yarra Hotel (20 miles) ends the first stage of the
trip at 1000 feet above sea level. Horses may be hired here for the
next stage to the first shelter hut (14 miles) and the Yarra Falls,
a series of wonderful cascades, having a fall of about 750
feet.</p>

<p>From the lookout above the falls the track is a kind of
switchback, with a rise ever a little greater than the fall, until
the second shelter hut (14 miles) is reached. on the crest of Mount
Whitelaw.</p>

<p>The next stage is an easy walk of about eight miles to the third
shelter hut, on Talbot Peak. On this walk there is ample time for a
side excursion to Mount Baw Baw (5500 feet), distinctly marked as a
commanding point of the range by the trigonometrical
station&mdash;a high cairn.</p>

<p>Mountaineering ends at Talbot Peak. Here the range breaks down
abruptly. The last stage of 15 miles is first an abrupt descent of
3500 feet in three miles on the steep side of Mount Erica (4800
feet), through a magnificent forest of white gum and ferns.</p>

<p>Then the tourist track is lost in older bush roads, which centre
upon the Thomson River Bridge, and finally upon
Walhalla&mdash;strangest and most interesting of all the old mining
towns of Victoria.</p>

<p>For convenience, the route has been described as from Melbourne
by way of Warburton, but the route may be reversed at will. Should
this be done, the morning train is taken to Moe, on the main
Gippsland line, where passengers change into the narrow gauge train
for the 26-mile journey to Walhalla.</p>

Moe to Walhalla is declared to be the most picturesque railway
route in Victoria. It winds along the beautiful valleys between
towering hills, across burbling streams and at times in sight of
the roadway. 5.&mdash;Walhalla township is set in delightful
surroundings among the hills. It is the jumping-off point for
dozens of delightful walks and tours in the mountain district.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>WALHALLA&mdash;A DELIGHTFUL
MOUNTAIN RETREAT</h2>

<p>With its winding and narrow street, and its miles of mountain
tracks, Walhalla presents many quaint attractions for the tourist.
The journey there over the 26 miles of narrow gauge railway from
Moe, curving round hillsides, skirting deep ravines, and crossing
mountain streams, is an experience in itself. It would he difficult
to imagine a finer scenic railway.</p>

<p>Soon after crossing the Thomson River bridge, a fine structure
supported by cement piers, the train enters the Stringers' Creek
Gorge. After an enthralling journey, the train draws up at the
Walhalla station, built right across the creek, with mountains
rising abruptly within a few yards on either side.</p>

<p>Gold production is now negligible, although exploratory work is
still going on to re-discover the rich vein which made Walhalla
famous; but this delightful little town, in its deep and narrow
valley hemmed in on either side by towering heights, will always be
the goal enchanting of the holiday maker.</p>

<p>The Weeping Rock is less than a mile from the railway station.
From the Greenleaf Spur, about 3i miles out, the best view of the
district can be obtained.</p>

<p>Within a mile of the town is Black Diamond Hill. This is the
highest point in the immediate vicinity, being 2075 feet above sea
level.</p>

<p>A walk of a little more than two miles to Lammer's Creek will
well repay those who do not mind some stiff climbing. The route is
to Maidentown, and down the Eureka Spur.</p>

<p>Good trips for the trout fisherman are those to the junction of
the Thomson and Aberfeldy Rivers, a spot little frequented, and to
the Steel Bridge.</p>

<p>Tourists holding return halves of tickets from Melbourne to
Warburton may return from Walhalla on payment of the single fare
for the extra mileage.</p>

glory.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>THE GRAMPIANS A WILD AND RUGGED
LAND OF FLOWERS</h2>

<p>To reach the wondrous mountain district of The Grampians,
tourists leave the train at Stawell. This attractive town, which
owes its foundation to sensational discoveries of gold in the early
days, is 150 miles northwest of Melbourne, on the main line to
Adelaide.</p>

<p>Cars run regularly the 14 miles from the town to the mountains.
There are half a dozen houses of accommodation within Hall's Gap
and in the Fyan's Creek Valley.</p>

<p>The general shape of the mountains is that of a giant
boomerang&mdash;Mount William (3830 feet), the culminating point,
being on the bend.</p>

<p>Mount Zero, the northern extremity, is 32 miles away in a
straight line, while Mount Sturgeon, at the other end, is 28 miles
south-westerly.</p>

<p>Properly speaking, the Grampians are the section from Mount
William north; to the south the mountains take the name of the
Serra Ranges. The Grampians are unique. Not only are the mountains
a striking mass in relation to the surrounding flatness, but they
have a character all their own. There is nothing else in Victoria
like them. They are a system of towering sandstone cliffs.</p>

<p>The rock formations are remarkable, the scenery is of the
finest, and the high colours of the cliffs add to the general
effect. Nature has stained the rock faces with her universal
pigment, iron rust, in all shades of yellow, brown and red.</p>

<h3>Splendid Panoramic Views</h3>

<p>The vast panoramas from the prominent peaks are among the finest
in the State. From one point a vast section of Western Victoria
lies stretched out before the tourist like a giant relief map.</p>

<p>Starting out from one of the accommodation houses, and following
a well-defined zigzag track, one is led through the Devil's Gap,
and by a short divergence to Mushroom Rock. This rock weighs about
50 tons, yet is supported by a small stalk-like pedestal. From here
the path leads upwards to the famous Sundial Rock, a ponderous mass
of sandstone, from which one of the finest internal views of the
Grampians is obtained.</p>

<p>Turning off from the old road to the Borough Huts, a winding
road has been cut on the mountainside for 5½ miles, leading to
Mount Rosea, passing on the way the beautiful Silverband Falls.</p>

<p>From the falls the track leads through long glades of tree-ferns
to the foot of the Grand Stairway up the mountain. This stairway is
a remarkable natural ledge about 13 feet wide, leading right up the
800-feet face of the precipice.</p>

<p>An easy climb for another mile leads to the summit of Mount
Rosea (3095 feet), so called in admiration of the beautiful native
shrub, Pultenoea Rosea, which is found nowhere else but here and on
Mount William.</p>

<p>Change of scenery of a delightful nature may be enjoyed by
spending a few days in the vicinity of the Borough Huts. Still
further variety and wilder forms of nature may be viewed on
excursions to the Barbican Rocks.</p>

<p>From the picnic grounds lying just within Hall's Gap many
delightful excursions may be made. That which should afford most
enjoyment is the exploration of Wonderland. Its charms are
innumerable, and no visitor should leave without feasting his eyes
upon them. A feature of it is The Silent Street, formed by cliffs
of great height running parallel to each other, leaving but a
narrow space between, and almost meeting overhead.</p>

<h3>Great Walls of Sandstone</h3>

<p>Upon emerging from The Silent Street, the visitor passes The
Unicorn, and may then proceed to try his powers of self-control on
The Nerve Test, a narrow arch-shaped rocky promontory jutting out
from the top of the cliff with great depths on either side. The
feat is to walk out to the end, turn round, and walk back again. A
believer in "Safety First" would leave it alone.</p>

<p>The Grand Canyon is formed by walls of sandstone about 300 feet
high, with many curious forms etched by Nature upon them. Its
termination has been made rather abrupt by a huge fall of rock,
over which flows a beautiful waterfall known as the Bridal
Veil.</p>

<p>To the naturalist, desiring to study the ways of the eagle, the
Grampians offer unlimited facilities. Kangaroo, wallaby, the emu,
and other native creatures, are to be seen in the ranges. They are
protected by the Game Act.</p>

<p>A description of this mountain region would be incomplete
without mention of its floral beauty. It is a botanical paradise.
Its wild flowers in the season are famous for their variety and
loveliness. There are showy Grevilleas, Boronias, and Epacrids,
with orchids and ferns in 600 different varieties. Quaint grass
trees are a feature.</p>

<p>Native heath, which grows in profusion, is the finest in the
State, During the flowering season personally conducted tours are
arranged by the Government Tourist Bureau.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>MOUNT MACEDON&mdash;AN IDEAL
RESORT</h2>

<p>Comparative proximity to Melbourne, good train service, and
natural beauty, make Mount Macedon (3000 feet above sea level) one
of Victoria's best tourist resorts. At the trigonometrical station
the height is 3325 feet, and at the summit of Camel's Hump 3294
feet. From here extensive views, extending in all directions, may
be obtained, especially in the south, with Port Phillip Bay in the
distance. Almost due south lie the You Yangs, while in the north
tower the mighty peaks of the Victorian Alps.</p>

<p>The best panorama of the surrounding country is obtained at the
Camel's Hump, where a tablet indicating the points of interest on
the landscape has been erected by the late Sir Thomas Carmichael, a
former Governor of the State, in memory of the happy times he had
spent on the mountain.</p>

<h3>Macedon Enjoys an Equable Climate</h3>

<p>Owing to its elevated position, the district enjoys an equable
climate. This makes it ideal for holiday making. The air is
invigorating even on the hottest days of summer. Cool and
refreshing nights give new life to those in need of rest and
recreation. The mountain may be reached by travel to either Macedon
(43 miles) or to Woodend (48½ miles).</p>

<p>Two townships, Macedon and Upper Macedon, are in the district.
Near to the Macedon railway station is the State Nursery, covering
about 90 acres, where millions of trees are grown each year for
distribution to the State forests throughout Victoria. The nursery
surrounds the district reservoir, and is well worthy of a
visit.</p>

<p>Upper Macedon is four miles away. There are comfortable guest
houses here. On the higher levels are the State pine plantations.
Hidden among the luxuriant trees are also beautiful mountain homes,
belonging to business and professional men from the city.</p>

<h3>Special Appeal During the Autumn</h3>

<p>The country cottage of the Governor of Victoria is also on the
southern slope of the mountain, and is surrounded by beautiful
gardens. Private nurseries on the mountain are a delight at all
seasons of the year. During the autumn Macedon has a special
appeal, because of the beautiful autumn tints on the trees.</p>

<p>It is about two miles from the Camel's Hump to the summit of
Mount Macedon itself. The view from here is not as good as from the
Hump because of the timber which intercepts the vision.</p>

<p>There is ample scope for the lover of fern glades. A magnificent
fernery lies along the course of the Stony Creek, and a track runs
through it almost to the foot of the mount, crossing and
re-crossing the creek several times on the way.</p>

<p>Geologists will find much to interest them in the Macedon
district.</p>

<p>There is an excellent train service to Macedon&mdash;four trains
to and from the city each day, with supplemented services during
holiday periods.</p>

<p>There are splendid accommodation houses on the northern slopes
of the mount, where the views are splendid, and the climate is just
as bracing as on the opposite side. Descending the mount towards
Woodend is the picturesque residence of the late W. P. McGregor.
Extensive grounds surround the house, and there are terraced
gardens. Further down towards Woodend are extensive golf links. The
road thence to the township traverses wooded country.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>WOODEND&mdash;A FINE HEALTH
RESORT</h2>

<p>Woodend, surrounded by hills and forests of eucalypt, is held in
esteem as a health resort. Five miles out is the Hanging Rock. It
is difficult to say why it has been give this name. The rock rises
to a height of 400 feet above the surrounding country, and easy
access is gained to its summit by well-graded paths along its
sloping sides.</p>

<p>Its comparatively flat summit is strewn with gigantic boulders,
evidently the result of volcanic action in some far distant age.
Fanciful resemblances have been traced in some of the rocks to
certain personal peculiarities and supposed likenesses to animal
forms.</p>

<p>From the summit is obtainable an excellent view of the rich
agricultural lands stretching towards Lancefield and Romsey, Mount
Alexander, the Bullengarook Ranges, the township of Woodend and
Mount Macedon.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>THE SERRA RANGES, DUNKELD AND
HAMILTON DISTRICT</h2>

<p>The Serras share with the Grampians the distinction of being the
only mountain resorts in the Western District of Victoria. Dunkeld,
a pastoral township on the Wannon River, 178 miles from Melbourne,
is the place through which they are most conveniently reached.</p>

<p>Immediately at the back of the town rise the two
peaks&mdash;Mount Sturgeon, 1946 feet, so called because of its
supposed likeness to the fish of that name, and Mount Abrupt, 2720
feet. From Mount Abrupt the curiously serrated ridge of the Serra
Range stretches in a northeasterly direction for a distance of more
than 30 miles.</p>

<p>A drive to Castle Peak, skirting the Wannon River, is of
interest, the scenery being different from that seen in other parts
of the State.</p>

<p class="caption">Mount Sturgeon, 1,946 feet, also adjoins

its supposed likeness to the fish of that name.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>NAYOOK AND NOOJEE, THE YOU
YANGS, MOUNT MARTHA AND ARTHUR'S SEAT</h2>

<h3>NAYOOK AND NOOJEE&mdash;DEEP GLENS AND GREAT FORESTS</h3>

<p>An intensely interesting field for the tourist is served by the
branch line of railway which junctions with the main Gippsland line
at Warragul, and extends beyond Neerim South as far as Noojee, 88½
miles from Melbourne. It is a grazing district on the fringe of a
magnificent hardwood forest, where the mountain ash tree rivals the
great redwoods of the Yosemite Valley, in California.</p>

<p>From Noojee, the valleys of the Loch and Latrobe Rivers can be
penetrated, and the southern slopes of the Great Dividing Range, of
which Mount Horsfall is a prominent feature, can be explored.</p>

<p>The enchanting Glen Nayook is not far from the Nayook station.
It is crammed full of beautiful tree ferns, and has been rendered
accessible by tracks.</p>

<p>Before Noojee is reached the traveller crosses some of the
highest trestle railway bridges in Victoria. The scenery on the
last few miles of the trip is fine.</p>

<p>Noojee, the terminal station, is situated between the Loch and
Toorongo Rivers, both of which flow south into the Latrobe. The
station gives access to glorious wooded and fern bowered valleys
comparatively seldom visited, and consequently possessing a newness
and freshness which the nature lover cannot fail to appreciate.</p>

<h3>THE YOU YANGS ARE OF HISTORIC INTEREST</h3>

<p>The You Yangs, 36 miles from Melbourne, are just big hills with
trees, that seem to exist in spite of Nature rather than because of
it, with age-worn granite rocks, which swing the mind for a moment
away into antiquity. These rocks and these hills, the geologists
tell us, are immensely old, perhaps 40,000,000 years.</p>

<p>From the topmost rock (1154 feet), Flinders Peak, Captain
Matthew Flinders, R.N., on May 1, 1802, surveyed the Bay&mdash;a
fact recorded on a tablet inserted in the granite.</p>

<p>The outlook from here is remarkable. By your very feet is broad,
expansive Port Phillip Bay, and to the northward Hobson's Bay.
Still further away is mighty Melbourne, gleaming in the sun, and
seeming to lie at the foot of Mount Dandenong, although we know
quite well that Mount Dandenong is 24 miles beyond. We look to the
south over Geelong, by clear and lovely Corio Bay, and we behold in
a vision of the future what a splendid city Geelong will be as one
of the world's greatest ports and as a throbbing centre of
manufacturing industry.</p>

<p>A complete circuit may be made of the range of vision. On the
distant skyline may be seen Mount Gellibrand, Mount Elephant, Mount
Anakie, Mount Buninyong, Mount Warrenheip, Mount Blackwood, Mount
Bullengarook, Mount Macedon, Mount Disappointment, the Gellibrand
Pile Light, Mount Dandenong, Arthur's Seat, Cape Schanck,
Portarlington, Point Flinders, Corio Bay, and Geelong.</p>

<p>The You Yangs may be reached by train to Little River or Lara
and a walk of a few miles.</p>

<h3>MOUNT MARTHA</h3>

<p>Mount Martha, 44 miles from Melbourne, lies upon a gentle slope
overlooking the sea and the esplanade at Dromana. From the mountain
top is obtainable a lovely series of views extending in every
direction, and including the heights of Macedon, and the You Yangs
to the north and north-west across the intervening surface of Port
Phillip.</p>

<p>Westward lie Portarlington and St. Leonard's, whilst farther
south the eye ranges past the nearer slopes of Dromana, crowned
with beautiful residences, to the proud prominence of Arthur's
Seat, and beyond all to the open waters of Bass Strait seen through
the Heads.</p>

<h3>ARTHUR'S SEAT</h3>

<p>The summit of Arthur's Seat, adjacent to the township of
Dromana, on the Mornington Peninsula, is 1200 feet above sea level.
There is a splendid drive to the top, affording many beautiful
panoramic views on the way. The outlook from the tower at the top
is superb. Not only Port Phillip Bay and the waters of Western
Port, but a long stretch of the outer ocean is spread before one;
the Nepean tongue appears very narrow as it curves symmetrically
towards the entrance.</p>

<p>There is at Arthur's Seat a shelter shed and a water tank for
the convenience of picnickers.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>Tours in the Mt. Buffalo
National Park</h2>

<p>There are innumerable enchanting tours to be made in all
directions in the Mount Buffalo National Park. One could spend
weeks here and not visit all of the many points of interest.</p>

<p>One of the most delightful tours, and incidentally the longest,
is that to The Horn (5645 feet), seven miles from The Chalet. This
is usually the objective of a day's trek, the party spending the
night in the cottage at The Horn, rising early to view the glorious
sunrise from this high point and then returning, perhaps, by a
different route to The Chalet next day.</p>

<p>Organised tours under the supervision of experienced guides are
arranged by the Government Tourist Bureau. Guests are invited to
join these special parties, no charge being made for the special
arrangements for comfort and convenience.</p>

<p>Tracks in the Mount Buffalo National Park are well-graded and
well-defined.</p>

<p>Motor tours to special features in the district, such as to the
hop fields in the valley or to mountains in the other ranges are
also arranged at nominal rates.</p>
