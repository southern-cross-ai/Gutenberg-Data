<h2>The Bright Boy</h2>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Young Joseph Last, having finally gone down from Oxford, wondered
a good deal what he was to do next and for the years following next.
He was an orphan from early boyhood, both his parents having died of
typhoid within a few days of each other when Joseph was ten years
old, and he remembered very little of Dunham, where his father ended
a long line of solicitors, practising in the place since 1707. The
Lasts had once been very comfortably off. They had intermarried now
and again with the gentry of the neighbourhood and did a good deal of
the county business, managing estates, collecting rents, officiating
as stewards for several manors, living generally in a world of quiet
but snug prosperity, rising to their greatest height, perhaps, during
the Napoleonic Wars and afterwards. And then they began to decline,
not violently at all, but very gently, so that it was many years
before they were aware of the process that was going on, slowly,
surely. Economists, no doubt, understand very well how the country
and the country town gradually became less important soon after the
Battle of Waterloo; and the causes of the decay and change which
vexed Cobbett so sadly, as he saw, or thought he saw, the life and
strength of the land being sucked up to nourish the monstrous
excrescence of London. Anyhow, even before the railways came, the
assembly rooms of the country towns grew dusty and desolate, the
county families ceased to come to their "town houses" for the winter
season, and the little theatres, where Mrs. Siddons and Grimaldi had
appeared in their divers parts, rarely opened their doors, and the
skilled craftsmen, the clock-makers and the furniture makers and the
like began to drift away to the big towns and to the capital city. So
it was with Dunham. Naturally the fortunes of the Lasts sank with the
fortunes of the town; and there had been speculations which had not
turned out well, and people spoke of a heavy loss in foreign bonds.
When Joseph's father died, it was found that there was enough to
educate the boy and keep him in strictly modest comfort and not much
more.</p>

<p>He had his home with an uncle who lived at Blackheath, and after a
few years at Mr. Jones's well-known preparatory school, he went to
Merchant Taylors and thence to Oxford. He took a decent degree (2nd
in Greats) and then began that wondering process as to what he was to
do with himself. His income would keep him in chops and steaks, with
an occasional roast fowl, and three or four weeks on the Continent
once a year. If he liked, he could do nothing, but the prospect
seemed tame and boring. He was a very decent Classical scholar, with
something more than the average schoolmaster's purely technical
knowledge of Latin and Greek and professional interest in them:
still, schoolmastering seemed his only clear and obvious way of
employing himself. But it did not seem likely that he would get a
post at any of the big public schools. In the first place, he had
rather neglected his opportunities at Oxford. He had gone to one of
the obscurer colleges, one of those colleges which you may read about
in memoirs dealing with the first years of the nineteenth century as
centres and fountains of intellectual life; which for some reason or
no reason have fallen into the shadow. There is nothing against them
in any way; but nobody speaks of them any more. In one of these
places Joseph Last made friends with good fellows, quiet and
cheeerful men like himself; but they were not, in the technical sense
of the term, the "good friends" which a prudent young man makes at
the University. One or two had the Bar in mind, and two or three the
Civil Service; but most of them were bound for country curacies and
country offices. Generally, and for practical purposes, they were
"out of it": they were not the men whose whispers could lead to
anything profitable in high quarters. And then, again, even in those
days, games were getting important in the creditable schools; and
there, young Last was very decidedly out of it. He wore spectacles
with lenses divided in some queer manner: his athletic disability was
final and complete.</p>

<p>He pondered, and thought at first of setting up a small
preparatory school in one of the well-to-do London suburbs; a
day-school where parents might have their boys well-grounded from the
very beginning, for comparatively modest fees, and yet have their
upbringing in their own hands. It had often struck Last that it was a
barbarous business to send a little chap of seven or eight away from
the comfortable and affectionate habit of his home to a strange place
among cold strangers; to bare boards, an inky smell, and grammar on
an empty stomach in the morning. But consulting with Jim Newman of
his old college, he was warned by that sage to drop his scheme and
leave it on the ground. Newman pointed out in the first place that
there was no money in teaching unless it was combined with
hotel-keeping. That, he said, was all right, and more than all right;
and he surmised that many people who kept hotels in the ordinary way
would give a good deal to practise their art and mystery under
Housemaster's Rules. "You needn't pay so very much for your
furniture, you know. You don't want to make the boys into young
sybarites. Besides, there's nothing a healthy-minded boy hates more
than stuffiness: what he likes is clean fresh air and plenty of it.
And, you know, old chap, fresh air is cheap enough. And then with the
food, there's apt to be trouble in the ordinary hotel if it's
uneatable; but in the sort of hotel we're talking of, a little
accident with the beef or mutton affords a very valuable opportunity
for the exercise of the virtue of self-denial."</p>

<p>Last listened to all this with a mournful grin.</p>

<p>"You seem to know all about it," he said. "Why don't you go in for
it yourself?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't keep my tongue in my cheek. Besides, I don't think
it's fair sport. I'm going out to India in the autumn. What about
pig-sticking?"</p>

<p>"And there's another thing," he went on after a meditative pause.
"That notion of yours about a day prep. school is rotten. The parents
wouldn't say thank you for letting them keep their kids at home when
they're all small and young. Some people go so far as to say that the
chief purpose of schools is to allow parents a good excuse for
getting rid of their children. That's nonsense. Most fathers and
mothers are very fond of their children and like to have them about
the house; when they're young, at all events. But somehow or other,
they've got it into their heads that strange schoolmasters know more
about bringing up a small boy than his own people; and there it is.
So, on all counts, drop that scheme of yours."</p>

<p>Last thought it over, and looked about him in the scholastic
world, and came to the conclusion that Newman was right. For two or
three years he took charge of reading parties in the long vacation.
In the winter he found occupation in the coaching of backward boys,
in preparing boys not so backward for scholarship examinations; and
his little text-book, <i>Beginning Greek</i>, was found quite useful
in Lower School. He did pretty well on the whole, though the work
began to bore him sadly, and such money as he earned, added to his
income, enabled him to live, in the way he liked, comfortably enough.
He had a couple of rooms in one of the streets going down from the
Strand to the river, for which he paid a pound a week, had bread and
cheese and odds and ends for lunch, with beer from his own barrel in
the cellar, and dined simply but sufficiently now in one, now in
another of the snug taverns which then abounded in the quarter. And,
now and again, once a month or so, perhaps, instead of the tavern
dinners, there was the play at the Vaudeville or the Olympic, the
Globe or the Strand, with supper and something hot to follow. The
evening might turn into a little party: old Oxford friends would look
him up in his rooms between six and seven; Zouch would gather from
the Temple and Medwin from Buckingham Street, and possibly Garraway,
taking the Yellow Albion 'bus, would descend from his remote steep in
the northern parts of London, would knock at 14, Mowbray Street, and
demand pipes, porter, and the pit at a good play. And, on rare
occasions, another member of the little society, Noel, would turn up.
Noel lived at Turnham Green in a red brick house which was then
thought merely old-fashioned, which would now&mdash;but it was pulled
down long ago&mdash;be distinguished as choice Queen Anne or Early
Georgian. He lived there with his father, a retired official of the
British Museum, and through a man whom he had known at Oxford, he had
made some way in literary journalism, contributing regularly to an
important weekly paper. Hence the consequence of his occasional
descents on Buckingham Street, Mowbray Street, and the Temple. Noel,
as in some sort a man of letters, or, at least, a professional
journalist, was a member of Blacks' Club, which in those days had
exiguous premises in Maiden Lane. Noel would go round the haunts of
his friends, and gather them to stout and oysters, and guide them
into some neighbouring theatre pit, whence they viewed excellent
acting and a cheerful, nonsensical play, enjoyed both, and were ready
for supper at the Tavistock. This done, Noel would lead the party to
Blacks', where they, very likely, saw some of the actors who had
entertained them earlier in the evening, and Noel's friends, the
journalists and men-of-letters, with a painter and a black-and-white
man here and there. Here, Last enjoyed himself very much, more
especially among the actors, who seemed to him more genial than the
literary men. He became especially friendly with one of the players,
old Meredith Mandeville, who had talked with the elder Kean, was
reliable in the smaller Shakespearean parts, and had engaging tales
to tell of early days in county circuits. "You had nine shillings a
week to begin with. When you got to fifteen shillings you gave your
landlady eight or nine shillings, and had the rest to play with. You
felt a prince. And the county families often used to come and see us
in the Green Room: most agreeable."</p>

<p>With this friendly old gentleman, whose placid and genial serenity
was not marred at all by incalculable quantities of gin, Last loved
to converse, getting glimpses of a life strangely remote from his
own: vagabondage, insecurity, hard times, and jollity; and against it
all as a background, the lighted murmur of the stage, voices uttering
tremendous things, and the sense of moving in two worlds. The old
man, by his own account, had not been eminently prosperous or
successful, and yet he had relished his life, and drew humours from
its disadvantages, and made hard times seem an adventure. Last used
to express his envy of the player's career, dwelling on the dull
insignificance of his own labours, which, he said, were a matter of
tinkering small boys' brains, teaching older boys the tricks of the
examiners, and generally doing things that didn't matter.</p>

<p>"It's no more education than bricklaying is architecture," he said
one night. "And there's no fun in it."</p>

<p>Old Mandeville, on his side, listened with interest to these
revelations of a world as strange and unknown to him as the life of
the floats was to the tutor. Broadly speaking, he knew nothing of any
books but play books. He had heard, no doubt, of things called
examinations, as most people have heard of Red Indian initiations;
but to him one was as remote as the other. It was interesting and
strange to him to be sitting at Blacks' and actually talking to a
decent young fellow who was seriously engaged in this queer business.
And there were&mdash;Last noted with amazement&mdash;points at which
their two circles touched, or so it seemed. The tutor, wishing to be
agreeable, began one night to talk about the origins of King Lear.
The actor found himself listening to Celtic legends which to him
sounded incomprehensible nonsense. And when it came to the Knight who
fought the King of Fairyland for the hand of Cordelia till Doomsday,
he broke in: "<i>Lear</i> is a pill; there's no doubt of that. You're
too young to have seen Barry O'Brien's <i>Lear</i>: magnificent. The
part has been attempted since his day. But it has never been played.
I have depicted the Fool myself, and, I must say, not without some
meed of applause. I remember once at Stafford ..." and Last was
content to let him tell his tale, which ended, oddly enough, with a
bullock's heart for supper.</p>

<p>But one night when Last was grumbling, as he often did, about the
fragmentary, desultory, and altogether unsatisfactory nature of his
occupation, the old man interrupted him in a wholly unexpected
vein.</p>

<p>"It is possible," he began, "mark you, I say possible, that I may
be the means of alleviating the tedium of your lot. I was calling
some days ago on a cousin of mine, a Miss Lucy Pilliner, a very
agreeable woman. She has a considerable knowledge of the world, and,
I hope you will forgive the liberty, but I mentioned in the course of
our conversation that I had lately become acquainted with a young
gentleman of considerable scholastic distinction, who was somewhat
dissatisfied with the too abrupt and frequent entrances and exits of
his present tutorial employment. It struck me that my cousin received
these remarks with a certain reflective interest, but I was not
prepared to receive this letter."</p>

<p>Mandeville handed Last the letter. It began: "My dear Ezekiel,"
and Last noted out of the corner of his eye a glance from the actor
which pleaded for silence and secrecy on this point. The letter went
on to say in a manner almost as dignified as Mandeville's, that the
writer had been thinking over the circumstances of the young tutor,
as related by her cousin in the course of their most agreeable
conversation of Friday last, and she was inclined to think that she
knew of an educational position shortly available in a private
family, which would be of a more permanent and satisfactory nature.
"Should your friend feel interested," Miss Pilliner ended, "I should
be glad if he would communicate with me, with a view to a meeting
being arranged, at which the matter could be discussed with more
exact particulars.</p>

<p>"And what do you think of it?" said Mandeville, as Last returned
Miss Pilliner's letter.</p>

<p>For a moment Last hesitated. There is an attraction and also a
repulsion in the odd and the improbable, and Last doubted whether
educational work obtained through an actor at Blacks' and a lady at
Islington&mdash;he had seen the name at the top of the
letter&mdash;could be altogether solid or desirable. But brighter
thoughts prevailed, and he assured Mandeville that he would be only
too glad to go thoroughly into the matter, thanking him very warmly
for his interest. The old man nodded benignly, gave him the letter
again that he might take down Miss Pilliner's address, and suggested
an immediate note asking for an appointment.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "despite the carping objections of the Moody
Prince, I propose to drink your jocund health to-night."</p>

<p>And he wished Last all the good luck in the world with hearty
kindliness.</p>

<p>In a couple of days Miss Pilliner presented her compliments to Mr.
Joseph Last and begged him to do her the favour of calling on her on
a date three days ahead, at noon, "if neither day nor hour were in
any way incompatible with his convenience." They might then, she
proceeded, take advantage of the occasion to discuss a certain
proposal, the nature of which, she believed, had been indicated to
Mr. Last by her good cousin, Mr. Meredith Mandeville.</p>

<p>Corunna Square, where Miss Pilliner lived, was a small, almost a
tiny, square in the remoter parts of Islington. Its two-storied
houses of dim, yellowish brick were fairly covered with vines and
clematis and all manner of creepers. In front of the houses were
small paled gardens, gaily flowering, and the square enclosure held
little else besides a venerable, wide-spreading mulberry, far older
than the buildings about it. Miss Pilliner lived in the quietest
corner of the square. She welcomed Last with some sort of compromise
between a bow and a curtsey, and begged him to be seated in an
upright arm-chair, upholstered in horse-hair. Miss Pilliner, he
noted, looked about sixty, and was, perhaps, a little older. She was
spare, upright, and composed; and yet one might have suspected a
lurking whimsicality. Then, while the weather was discussed, Miss
Pilliner offered a choice of port or sherry, sweet biscuits or plum
cake. And so to the business of the day.</p>

<p>"My cousin, Mr. Mandeville, informed me," she began, "of a young
friend of great scholastic ability, who was, nevertheless,
dissatisfied with the somewhat casual and occasional nature of his
employment. By a singular coincidence, I had received a letter a day
or two before from a friend of mine, a Mrs. Marsh. She is, in fact, a
distant connection, some sort of cousin, I suppose, but not being a
Highlander or a Welshwoman, I really cannot say how many times
removed. She was a lovely creature; she is still a handsome woman.
Her name was Manning, Arabella Manning, and what possessed her to
marry Mr. Marsh I really cannot say. I only saw the man once, and I
thought him her inferior in every respect, and considerably older.
However, she declares that he is a devoted husband and an excellent
person in every respect. They first met, odd as it must seem, in
Pekin, where Arabella was governess in one of the Legation families.
Mr. Marsh, I was given to understand, represented highly important
commercial interests at the capital of the Flowery Land, and being
introduced to my connection, a mutual attraction seems to have
followed. Arabella Manning resigned her position in the
attach&eacute;'s family, and the marriage was solemnised in due
course. I received this intelligence nine years ago in a letter from
Arabella, dated at Pekin, and my relative ended by saying that she
feared it would be impossible to furnish an address for an immediate
reply, as Mr. Marsh was about to set out on a mission of an extremely
urgent nature on behalf of his firm, involving a great deal of
travelling and frequent changes of address. I suffered a good deal of
uneasiness on Arabella's account; it seemed such an unsettled way of
life, and so unhomelike. However, a friend of mine who is in the City
assured me that there was nothing unusual in the circumstances, and
that there was no cause for alarm. Still, as the years went on, and I
received no further communication from my cousin, I made up my mind
that she had probably contracted some tropical disease which had
carried her off, and that Mr. Marsh had heartlessly neglected to
communicate to me the intelligence of the sad event. But a month ago,
almost to the day&mdash;Miss Pilliner referred to an almanac on the
table beside her&mdash;I was astonished and delighted to receive a
letter from Arabella. She wrote from one of the most luxurious and
exclusive hotels in the West End of London, announcing the return of
her husband and herself to their native land after many years of
wandering. Mr. Marsh's active concern in business had, it appeared,
at length terminated in a highly prosperous and successful manner,
and he was now in negotiation for the purchase of a small estate in
the country, where he hoped to spend the remainder of his days in
peaceful retirement." Miss Pilliner paused and replenished Last's
glass.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," she continued, "to trouble you with this long
narrative, which, I am sure, must be a sad trial of your patience.
But, as you will see presently, the circumstances are a little out of
the common, and as you are, I trust, to have a particular interest in
them, I think it is only right that you should be fully
informed&mdash;fair and square, and all above board, as my poor
father used to say in his bluff manner.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Last, I received, as I have said, this letter from
Arabella with its extremely gratifying intelligence. As you may
guess, I was very much relieved to hear that all had turned out so
felicitously. At the end of her letter, Arabella begged me to come
and see them at Billing's Hotel, saying that her husband was most
anxious to have the pleasure of meeting me."</p>

<p>Miss Pilliner went to a drawer in a writing-table by the window
and took out a letter.</p>

<p>"Arabella was always considerate. She says, 'I know that you have
always lived very quietly, and are not accustomed to the turmoil of
fashionable London. But you need not be alarmed. Billing's Hotel is
no bustling modern caravanserai. Everything is very quiet, and,
besides, we have our own small suite of apartments. Herbert&mdash;her
husband, Mr. Last&mdash;positively insists on your paying us a visit,
and you must not disappoint us. If next Thursday, the 22nd, suits
you, a carriage shall be sent at four o'clock to bring you to the
hotel, and will take you back to Corunna Square, after you have
joined us in a little dinner.'</p>

<p>"Very kind, most considerate; don't you agree with me, Mr. Last?
But look at the postscript."</p>

<p>Last took the letter, and read in a tight, neat script: "PS. We
have a wonderful piece of news for you. It is too good to write, so I
shall keep it for our meeting."</p>

<p>Last handed back Mrs. Marsh's letter. Miss Pilliner's long and
ceremonious approach was lulling him into a mild stupor; he wondered
faintly when she would come to the point, and what the point would be
like when she came to it, and, chiefly, what on earth this rather
dull family history could have to do with him.</p>

<p>Miss Pilliner proceeded.</p>

<p>"Naturally, I accepted so kindly and urgent an invitation. I was
anxious to see Arabella once more after her long absence, and I was
glad to have the opportunity of forming my own judgment as to her
husband, of whom I knew absolutely nothing. And then, Mr. Last, I
must confess that I am not deficient in that spirit of curiosity,
which gentlemen have scarcely numbered with female virtues. I longed
to be made partaker in the wonderful news which Arabella had promised
to impart on our meeting, and I wasted many hours in speculating as
to its nature.</p>

<p>"The day came. A neat brougham with its attendant footman arrived
at the appointed hour, and I was driven in smooth luxury to Billing's
Hotel in Manners Street, Mayfair. There a major-domo led the way to
the suite of apartments on the first floor occupied by Mr. and Mrs.
Marsh. I will not waste your valuable time, Mr. Last, by expatiating
on the rich but quiet luxury of their apartments; I will merely
mention that my relative assured me that the S&egrave;vres ornaments
in their drawing-room had been valued at nine hundred guineas. I
found Arabella still a beautiful woman, but I could not help seeing
that the tropical countries in which she had lived for so many years
had taken their toll of her once resplendent beauty; there was a
weariness, a lassitude in her appearance and demeanour which I was
distressed to observe. As to her husband, Mr. Marsh, I am aware that
to form an unfavourable judgment after an acquaintance which has only
lasted a few hours is both uncharitable and unwise; and I shall not
soon forget the discourse which dear Mr. Venn delivered at Emmanuel
Church on the very Sunday after my visit to my relative: it really
seemed, and I confess it with shame, that Mr. Venn had my own case in
mind, and felt it his bounden duty to warn me while it was yet time.
Still, I must say that I did not take at all to Mr. Marsh. I really
can't say why. To me he was most polite; he could not have been more
so. He remarked more than once on the extreme pleasure it gave him to
meet at last one of whom he had heard so much from his dear Bella; he
trusted that now his wandering days were over, the pleasure might be
frequently repeated; he omitted nothing that the most genial courtesy
might suggest. And yet, I cannot say that the impression I received
was a favourable one. However; I dare say that I was mistaken."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Last was resigned. The point of the long story
seemed to recede into some far distance, into vanishing
prospective.</p>

<p>"There was nothing definite?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"No; nothing definite. I may have thought that I detected a lack
of candour, a hidden reserve behind all the generosity of Mr. Marsh's
expressions. Still; I hope I was mistaken.</p>

<p>"But I am forgetting in these trivial and I trust erroneous
observations, the sole matter that is of consequence; to you, at
least, Mr. Last. Soon after my arrival, before Mr. Marsh had
appeared, Arabella confided to me her great piece of intelligence.
Her marriage had been blessed by offspring. Two years after her union
with Mr. Marsh, a child had been born, a boy. The birth took place at
a town in South America, Santiago de Chile&mdash;I have verified the
place in my atlas&mdash;where Mr. Marsh's visit had been more
protracted than usual. Fortunately, an English doctor was available,
and the little fellow throve from the first, and as Arabella, his
proud mother, boasted, was now a beautiful little boy, both handsome
and intelligent to a remarkable degree. Naturally, I asked to see the
child, but Arabella said that he was not in the hotel with them.
After a few days it was thought that the dense and humid air of
London was not suiting little Henry very well; and he had been sent
with a nurse to a resort in the Isle of Thanet, where he was reported
to be in the best of health and spirits.</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Last, after this tedious but necessary preamble, we
arrive at that point where you, I trust, may be interested. In any
case, as you may suppose, the life which the exigencies of business
compelled the Marshes to lead, involving as it did almost continual
travel, would have been little favourable to a course of systematic
education for the child. But this obstacle apart, I gathered that Mr.
Marsh holds very strong views as to the folly of premature
instruction. He declared to me his conviction that many fine minds
had been grievously injured by being forced to undergo the process of
early stimulation; and he pointed out that, by the nature of the
case, those placed in charge of very young children were not persons
of the highest acquirements and the keenest intelligence. 'As you
will readily agree, Miss Pilliner,' he remarked to me, 'great
scholars are not employed to teach infants their alphabet, and it is
not likely that the mysteries of the multiplication table will be
imparted by a master of mathematics.' In consequence, he urged, the
young and budding intelligence is brought into contact with dull and
inferior minds, and the damage may well be irreparable."</p>

<p>There was much more, but gradually light began to dawn on the
dazed man. Mr. Marsh had kept the virgin intelligence of his son
Henry undisturbed and uncorrupted by inferior and incompetent
culture. The boy, it was judged, was now ripe for true education, and
Mr. and Mrs. Marsh had begged Miss Pilliner to make enquiries, and to
find, if she could, a scholar who would undertake the whole charge of
little Henry's mental upbringing. If both parties were satisfied, the
engagement would be for seven years at least, and the appointments,
as Miss Pilliner called the salary, would begin with five hundred
pounds a year, rising by an annual increment of fifty pounds.
References, particulars of University distinctions would be required:
Mr. Marsh, long absent from England, was ready to proffer the names
of his bankers. Miss Pilliner was quite sure, however, that Mr. Last
might consider himself engaged, if the position appealed to him.</p>

<p>Last thanked Miss Pilliner profoundly. He told her that he would
like a couple of days in which to think the matter over. He would
then write to her, and she would put him into communication with Mr.
Marsh. And so he went away from Corunna Square in a mood of great
bewilderment and doubt. Unquestionably, the position had many
advantages. The pay was very good. And he would be well lodged and
well fed. The people were wealthy, and Miss Pilliner had assured him:
"You will have no cause to complain of your entertainment." And from
the educational point of view, it would certainly be an improvement
on the work he had been doing since he left the University. He had
been an odd-job man, a tinker, a patcher, a cobbler of other people's
work; here was a chance to show that he was a master craftsman. Very
few people, if any, in the teaching profession had ever enjoyed such
an opportunity as this. Even the sixth-form masters in the big public
schools must sometimes groan at having to underpin and relay the bad
foundations of the Fifth and Fourth. He was to begin at the
beginning, with no false work to hamper him: "from A B C to Plato,
&AElig;schylus, and Aristotle," he murmured to himself. Undoubtedly
it was a big chance.</p>

<p>And on the other side? Well, he would have to give up London, and
he had grown fond of the homely, cheerful London that he knew; his
comfortable rooms in Mowbray Street, quiet enough down by the
unfrequented Embankment, and yet but a minute or two from the ringing
Strand. Then there were the meetings with the old Oxford friends, the
nights at the theatre, the snug taverns with their curtained boxes,
and their good chops and steaks and stout, and chimes of midnight and
after, heard in cordial company at Blacks': all these would have to
go. Miss Pilliner had spoken of Mr. Marsh as looking for some place a
considerable distance from town, "in the real country." He had his
eye, she said, on a house on the Welsh border, which he thought of
taking furnished, with the option of buying, if he eventually found
it suited him. You couldn't look up old friends in London and get
back the same night, if you lived somewhere on the Welsh border.
Still, there would be the holidays, and a great deal might be done in
the holidays.</p>

<p>And yet; there was still debate and doubt within his mind, as he
sat eating his bread and cheese and potted meat, and drinking his
beer in his sitting-room in peaceful Mowbray Street. He was
influenced, he thought, by Miss Pilliner's evident dislike of Mr.
Marsh, and though Miss Pilliner talked in the manner of Dr. Johnson,
he had a feeling that, like a lady of the Doctor's own day, she had a
bottom of good sense. Evidently she did not trust Mr. Marsh overmuch.
Yet, what can the most cunning swindler do to his resident tutor?
Give him cold mutton for dinner or forget to pay his salary? In
either case, the remedy was simple: the resident tutor would swiftly
cease to reside, and go back to London, and not be much the worse.
After all, Last reflected, a man can't compel his son's tutor to
invest in Uruguayan Silver or Java Spices or any other fallacious
commercial undertaking, so what mattered the supposed trickiness of
Marsh to him?</p>

<p>But again, when all had been summed up and considered, for and
against; there was a vague objection remaining. To oppose this, Last
could bring no argument, since it was without form of words,
shapeless, and mutable as a cloud.</p>

<p>However, when the next morning came, there came with it a couple
of letters inviting him to cram two young dunderheads with facts and
figures and verbs in <i>mi</i>. The prospect was so terribly
distasteful that he wrote to Miss Pilliner directly after breakfast,
enclosing his College Testimonials and certain other commendatory
letters he had in his desk. In due course, he had an interview with
Mr. Marsh at Billing's Hotel. On the whole, each was well-enough
pleased with the other. Last found Marsh a lean, keen, dark man in
later middle age; there was a grizzle in his black hair above the
ears, and wrinkles seamed his face about the eyes. His eyebrows were
heavy, and there was a hint of a threat in his jaw, but the smile
with which he welcomed Last lit up his grimmish features into a
genial warmth. There was an oddity about his accent and his tone in
speaking; something foreign, perhaps? Last remembered that he had
journeyed about the world for many years, and supposed that the
echoes of many languages sounded in his speech. His manner and
address were certainly suave, but Last had no prejudice against
suavity, rather, he cherished a liking for the decencies of common
intercourse. Still, no doubt, Marsh was not the kind of man Miss
Pilliner was accustomed to meet in Corunna Square society or among
Mr. Venn's congregation. She probably suspected him of having been a
pirate.</p>

<p>And Mr. Marsh on his side was delighted with Last. As appeared
from a letter addressed by him to Miss Pilliner&mdash;"or, may I
venture to say, Cousin Lucy?"&mdash;Mr. Last was exactly the type of
man he and Arabella had hoped to secure through Miss Pilliner's
recommendation. They did not want to give their boy into the charge
of a flashy man of the world with a substratum of learning. Mr. Last
was, it was evident, a quiet and unworldly scholar, more at home
among books than among men; the very tutor Arabella and himself had
desired for their little son. Mr. Marsh was profoundly grateful to
Miss Pilliner for the great service she had rendered to Arabella, to
himself, and to Henry.</p>

<p>And, indeed, as Mr. Meredith Mandeville would have said, Last
looked the part. No doubt, the spectacles helped to create the
remote, retired, Dominie Sampson impression.</p>

<p>In a week's time it was settled, he was to begin his duties. Mr.
Marsh wrote a handsome cheque, "to defray any little matters of
outfit, travelling expenses, and so forth; nothing to do with your
salary." He was to take train to a certain large town in the west,
and there he would be met and driven to the house, where Mrs. Marsh
and his pupil were already established&mdash;"beautiful country, Mr.
Last; I am sure you will appreciate it."</p>

<p>There was a famous farewell gathering of the old friends. Zouch
and Medwin, Garraway and Noel came from near and far. There was
grilled sole before the mighty steak, and a roast fowl after it. They
had decided that as it was the last time, perhaps, they would not go
to the play, but sit and talk about the mahogany. Zouch, who was
understood to be the ruler of the feast, had conferred with the head
waiter, and when the cloth was removed, a rare and curious port was
solemnly set before them. They talked of the old days when they were
up at Wells together, pretended&mdash;though they knew
better&mdash;that the undergraduate who had cut his own father in
Piccadilly was a friend of theirs, retold jokes that must have been
older than the wine, related tales of Moll and Meg, and the famous
history of Melcombe, who screwed up the Dean in his own rooms. And
then there was the affair of the Poses Plastiques. Certain lewd
fellows, as one of the Dons of Wells College expressed it, had
procured scandalous figures from the wax-work booth at the fair, and
had disposed them by night about the fountain in the college garden
in such a manner that their scandal was shamefully increased. The
perpetrators of this infamy had never been discovered: the five
friends looked knowingly at each other, pursed their lips, and passed
the port.</p>

<p>The old wine and the old stories blended into a mood of gentle
meditation; and then, at the right moment, Noel carried them off to
Blacks' and new company. Last sought out old Mandeville and related,
with warm gratitude, the happy issue of his intervention.</p>

<p>The chimes sounded, and they all went their several ways.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Though Joseph Last was by no means a miracle of observation and
deduction, he was not altogether the simpleton among his books that
Mr. Marsh had judged him. It was not so very long before a certain
uneasiness beset him in his new employment.</p>

<p>At first everything had seemed very well. Mr. Marsh had been right
in thinking that he would be charmed by the scene in which the White
House was set. It stood, terraced on a hill-side, high above a grey
and silver river winding in esses through a lonely, lovely valley.
Above it, to the east, was a vast and shadowy and ancient wood,
climbing to the high ridge of the hill, and descending by height and
by depth of green to the level meadows and to the sea. And, standing
on the highest point of the wood above the White House, Last looked
westward between the boughs and saw the lands across the river, and
saw the country rise and fall in billow upon billow to the huge dim
wall of the mountain, blue in the distance, and white farms shining
in the sun on its vast side. Here was a man in a new world. There had
been no such country as this about Dunham in the Midlands, or in the
surroundings of Blackheath or Oxford; and he had visited nothing like
it on his reading parties. He stood amazed, enchanted under the green
shade, beholding a great wonder. Close beside him the well bubbled
from the grey rocks, rising out of the heart of the hill.</p>

<p>And in the White House, the conditions of life were altogether
pleasant. He had been struck by the dark beauty of Mrs. Marsh, who
was clearly, as Miss Pilliner had told him, a great many years
younger than her husband. And he noted also that effect which her
cousin had ascribed to years of living in the tropics, though he
would hardly have called it weariness or lassitude. It was something
stranger than that; there was the mark of flame upon her, but Last
did not know whether it were the flame of the sun, or the stranger
fires of places that she had entered, perhaps long ago.</p>

<p>But the pupil, little Henry, was altogether a surprise and a
delight. He looked rather older than seven, but Last judged that this
impression was not so much due to his height or physical make as to
the bright alertness and intelligence of his glance. The tutor had
dealt with many little boys, though with none so young as Henry; and
he had found them as a whole a stodgy and podgy race, with faces that
recorded a fixed abhorrence of learning and a resolution to learn as
little as possible. Last was never surprised at this customary
expression. It struck him as eminently natural. He knew that all
elements are damnably dull and difficult. He wondered why it was
inexorably appointed that the unfortunate human creature should pass
a great portion of its life from the very beginning in doing things
that it detested; but so it was, and now for the syntax of the
optative.</p>

<p>But there were no such obstinate entrenchments in the face or the
manner of Henry Marsh. He was a handsome boy, who looked brightly and
spoke brightly, and evidently did not regard his tutor as a hostile
force that had been brought against him. He was what some people
would have called, oddly enough, old-fashioned; child-like, but not
at all childish, with now and then a whimsical turn of phrase more
suggestive of a humorous man than a little boy. This older habit was
no doubt to be put down partly to the education of travel, the
spectacle of the changing scene and the changing looks of men and
things, but very largely to the fact that he had always been with his
father and mother, and knew nothing of the company of children of his
own age.</p>

<p>"Henry has had no playmates," his father explained. "He's had to
be content with his mother and myself. It couldn't be helped. We've
been on the move all the time; on shipboard or staying at
cosmopolitan hotels for a few weeks, and then on the road again. The
little chap had no chance of making any small friends."</p>

<p>And the consequence was, no doubt, that lack of childishness that
Last had noted. It was, probably, a pity that it was so.
Childishness, after all, was a wonder world, and Henry seemed to know
nothing of it: he had lost what might be, perhaps, as valuable as any
other part of human experience, and he might find the lack of it as
he grew older. Still, there it was; and Last ceased to think of these
possibly fanciful deprivations, when he began to teach the boy, as he
had promised himself, from the very beginning. Not quite from the
beginning; the small boy confessed with a disarming grin that he had
taught himself to read a little: "But please, sir, don't tell my
father, as I know he wouldn't like it. You see, my father and mother
had to leave me alone sometimes, and it was so dull, and I thought it
would be such fun if I learnt to read books all by myself."</p>

<p>Here, thought Last, is a lesson for schoolmasters. Can learning be
made a desirable secret, an excellent sport, instead of a horrible
penance? He made a mental note, and set about the work before him. He
found an extraordinary aptitude, a quickness in grasping his
indications and explanations such as he had never known
before&mdash;"not in boys twice his age, or three times his age, for
the matter of that," as he reflected. This child, hardly removed from
strict infancy, had something almost akin to genius&mdash;so the
happy tutor was inclined to believe. Now and again, with his, "Yes,
sir, I see. And then, of course ..." he would veritably take the
coming words out of Last's mouth, and anticipate what was, no doubt,
logically the next step in the demonstration. But Last had not been
accustomed to pupils who anticipated anything&mdash;save the hour for
putting the books back on the shelf. And above all, the instructor
was captured by the eager and intense curiosity of the instructed. He
was like a man reading <i>The Moonstone</i>, or some such sensational
novel, and unable to put the book down till he had read to the very
last page and found out the secret. This small boy brought just this
spirit of insatiable curiosity to every subject put before him. "I
wish I had taught him to read," thought Last to himself. "I have no
doubt he would have regarded the alphabet as we regard those
entrancing and mysterious cyphers in Edgar Allan Poe's stories. And,
after all, isn't that the right and rational way of looking at the
alphabet?"</p>

<p>And then he went on to wonder whether curiosity, often regarded as
a failing, almost a vice, is not, in fact, one of the greatest
virtues of the spirit of man, the key to all knowledge and all the
mysteries, the very sense of the secret that must be discovered.</p>

<p>With one thing and another: with this treasure of a pupil, with
this enchantment of the strange and beautiful country about him, and
with the extreme kindness and consideration shown him by Mr. and Mrs.
Marsh, Last was in rich clover. He wrote to his friends in town,
telling them of his happy experiences, and Zouch and Noel, meeting by
chance at the Sun, the Dog, or the Triple Tun, discussed their
friend's felicity.</p>

<p>"Proud of the pup," said Zouch.</p>

<p>"And pleased with the prospect," responded Noel, thinking of
Last's lyrics about the woods and the waters, and the scene of the
White House. "Still, <i>timeo Hesperides et dona ferentes</i>. I
mistrust the west. As one of its own people said, it is a land of
enchantment and illusion. You never know what may happen next. It is
a fortunate thing that Shakespeare was born within the safety line.
If Stratford had been twenty or thirty miles farther west ... I don't
like to think of it. I am quite sure that only fairy gold is dug from
Welsh goldmines. And you know what happens to that."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, far from the lamps and rumours of the Strand, Last
continued happy in his outland territory, under the great wood. But
before long he received a shock. He was strolling in the terraced
garden one afternoon between tea and dinner, his work done for the
day; and feeling inclined for tobacco with repose, drifted towards
the stone summer-house&mdash;or, perhaps, gazebo&mdash;that stood on
the verge of the lawn in a coolness of dark ilex trees. Here one
could sit and look down on the silver winding of the river, crossed
by a grey bridge of ancient stone. Last was about to settle down when
he noticed a book on the table before him. He took it up, and glanced
into it, and drew in his breath, and turning over a few more pages,
sank aghast upon the bench. Mr. Marsh had always deplored his
ignorance of books. "I knew how to read and write and not much more,"
he would say, "when I was thrown into business&mdash;at the bottom of
the stairs. And I've been so busy ever since that I'm afraid it's too
late now to make up for lost time." Indeed, Last had noted that
though Marsh usually spoke carefully enough, perhaps too carefully,
he was apt to lapse in the warmth of conversation: he would talk of
"fax," meaning "facts." And yet, it seemed, he had not only found
time for reading, but had acquired sufficient scholarship to make out
the Latin of a terrible Renaissance treatise, not generally known
even to collectors of such things. Last had heard of the book; and
the few pages he had glanced at showed him that it thoroughly
deserved its very bad character.</p>

<p>It was a disagreeable surprise. He admitted freely to himself that
his employer's morals were no business of his. But why should the man
trouble to tell lies? Last remembered queer old Miss Pilliner's
account of her impressions of him; she had detected "a lack of
candour," something reserved behind a polite front of cordiality.
Miss Pilliner was, certainly, an acute woman: there was an undoubted
lack of candour about Marsh.</p>

<p>Last left the wretched volume on the summer-house table, and
walked up and down the garden, feeling a good deal perturbed. He knew
he was awkward at dinner, and said he felt a bit seedy, inclined to a
headache. Marsh was bland and pleasant as usual, and Mrs. Marsh
sympathised with Last. She had hardly slept at all last night, she
complained, and felt heavy and tired. She thought there was thunder
in the air. Last, admiring her beauty, confessed again that Miss
Pilliner had been right. Apart from her fatigue of the moment, there
was a certain tropical languor about her, something of still, burning
nights and the odour of strange flowers.</p>

<p>Marsh brought out a very special brandy which he administered with
the black coffee; he said it would do both the invalids good, and
that he would keep them company. Indeed, Last confessed to himself
that he felt considerably more at ease after the good dinner, the
good wine, and the rare brandy. It was humiliating, perhaps, but it
was impossible to deny the power of the stomach. He went to his room
early and tried to convince himself that the duplicity of Marsh was
no affair of his. He found an innocent, or almost innocent
explanation of it before he had finished his last pipe, sitting at
the open window, hearing faintly the wash of the river and gazing
towards the dim lands beyond it.</p>

<p>"Here," he meditated, "we have a modified form of Bounderby's
Disease. Bounderby said that he began life as a wretched, starved,
neglected little outcast. Marsh says that he was made into an office
boy or something of the sort before he had time to learn anything.
Bounderby lied, and no doubt Marsh lies. It is the trick of wealthy
men; to magnify their late achievements by magnifying their early
disadvantages."</p>

<p>By the time he went to sleep he had almost decided that the young
Marsh had been to a good grammar school, and had done well.</p>

<p>The next morning, Last awoke almost at ease again. It was no doubt
a pity that Marsh indulged in a subtle and disingenuous form of
boasting, and his taste in books was certainly deplorable: but he
must look after that himself. And the boy made amends for all. He
showed so clean a grasp of the English sentence, that Last thought he
might well begin Latin before very long. He mentioned this one night
at dinner, looking at Marsh with a certain humorous intention. But
Marsh gave no sign that the dart had pricked him.</p>

<p>"That shows I was right," he remarked. "I've always said there's
no greater mistake than forcing learning on children before they're
fit to take it in. People will do it, and in nine cases out of ten
the children's heads are muddled for the rest of their lives. You see
how it is with Henry; I've kept him away from books up to now, and
you see for yourself that I've lost him no time. He's ripe for
learning, and I shouldn't wonder if he got ahead better in six months
than the ordinary, early-crammed child would in six years."</p>

<p>It might be so, Last thought, but on the whole he was inclined to
put down the boy's swift progress rather to his own exceptional
intelligence than to his father's system, or no system. And in any
case, it was a great pleasure to teach such a boy. And his
application to his books had certainly no injurious effect on his
spirits. There was not much society within easy reach of the White
House, and, besides, people did not know whether the Marshes were to
settle down or whether they were transient visitors: they were chary
of paying their calls while there was this uncertainty. However, the
rector had called; first of all the rector and his wife, she cheery,
good-humoured and chatty; he somewhat dim and vague. It was
understood that the rector, a high wrangler in his day, divided his
time between his garden and the invention of a flying machine. He had
the character of being slightly eccentric. He came not again, but
Mrs. Winslow would drive over by the forest road in the governess's car
with her two children; Nancy, a pretty fair girl of seventeen, and
Ted, a boy of eleven or twelve, of that type which Last catalogued as
"stodgy and podgy," broad and thick set, with bulgy cheeks and eyss,
and something of the determined expression of a young bulldog. After
tea Nancy would organise games for the two boys in the garden and
join in them herself with apparent relish. Henry, who had known few
companions besides his parents, and had probably never played a game
of any kind, squealed with delight, ran here and there and
everywhere, hid behind the summer-house and popped out from the
screen of the French beans with the greatest gusto, and Ted Winslow
joined in with an air of protest. He was on his holidays, and his
expression signified that all that sort of thing was only fit for
girls and kids. Last was delighted to see Henry so ready and eager to
be amused; after all he had something of the child in him. He seemed
a little uncomfortable when Nancy Winslow took him on her knee after
the sports were over; he was evidently fearful of Ted Winslow's
scornful eye. Indeed, the young bulldog looked as if he feared that
his character would be compromised by associating with so manifest
and confessed a kid. The next time Mrs. Winslow took tea at the White
House, Ted had a diplomatic headache and stayed at home. But Nancy
found games that two could play, and she and Henry were heard
screaming with joy all over the gardens. Henry wanted to show Nancy a
wonderful well that he had discovered in the forest; it came, he
said, from under the roots of a great yew tree. But Mrs. Marsh seemed
to think that they might get lost.</p>

<p>Last had got over the uncomfortable incident of that villainous
book in the summer-house. Writing to Noel, he had remarked that he
feared his employer was a bit of an old rascal in some respects, but
all right so far as he was concerned; and there it was. He got on
with his job and minded his own business. Yet, now and again, his
doubtful uneasiness about the man was renewed. There was a bad
business at a hamlet a couple of miles away, where a girl of twelve
or thirteen, coming home after dusk from a visit to a neighbour, had
been set on in the wood and very vilely misused. The unfortunate
child, it would appear, had been left by the scoundrel in the black
dark of the forest, at some distance from the path she must have
taken on her way home. A man who had been drinking late at the Fox
and Hounds heard crying and screaming, "like someone in a fit," as he
expressed it, and found the girl in a terrible state, and in a
terrible state she had remained ever since. She was quite unable to
describe the person who had so shamefully maltreated her; the shock
had left her beside herself; she cried out once that something had
come behind her in the dark, but she could say no more, and it was
hopeless to try to get her to describe a person that, most likely,
she had not even seen. Naturally, this very horrible story made
something of a feature in the local paper, and one night, as Last and
Marsh were sitting smoking after dinner, the tutor spoke of the
affair; said something about the contrast between the peace and
beauty and quiet of the scene and the villainous crime that had been
done hard by. He was surprised to find that Marsh grew at once ill at
ease. He rose from his chair and walked up and down the room
muttering "horrible business, shameful business"; and when he sat
down again, with the light full on him, Last saw the face of a
frightened man. The hand that Marsh laid on the table was twitching
uneasily; he beat with his foot on the floor as he tried to bring his
lips to order, and there was a dreadful fear in his eyes.</p>

<p>Last was shocked and astonished at the effect he had produced with
a few conventional phrases. Nervously, willing to tide over a painful
situation, he began to utter something even more conventional to the
effect that the loveliness of external nature had never conferred
immunity from crime, or some stuff to the same inane purpose. But
Marsh, it was clear, was not to be soothed by anything of the kind.
He started again from his chair and struck his hand upon the table,
with a fierce gesture of denial and refusal.</p>

<p>"Please, Mr. Last, let it be. Say no more about it. It has upset
Mrs. Marsh and myself very much indeed. It horrifies us to think that
we have brought our boy here, to this peaceful place as we thought,
only to expose him to the contagion of this dreadful affair. Of
course we have given the servants strict orders not to say a word
about it in Henry's presence; but you know what servants are, and
what very sharp ears children have. A chance word or two may take
root in a child's mind and contaminate his whole nature. It is,
really, a very terrible thought. You must have noticed how distressed
Mrs. Marsh has been for the last few days. The only thing we can do
is to try and forget it all, and hope no harm has been done."</p>

<p>Last murmured a word or two of apology and agreement, and the talk
moved off into safer country. But when the tutor was alone, he
considered what he had seen and heard very curiously. He thought that
Marsh's looks did not match his words. He spoke as the devoted
father, afraid that his little boy should overhear nauseous and
offensive gossip and conjecture about a horrible and obscene crime.
But he looked like a man who had caught sight of a gallows, and
that, Last felt, was altogether a very different kind of fear. And,
then, there was his reference to his wife. Last had noticed that
since the crime in the forest there had been something amiss with
her; but, again, he mistrusted Marsh's comment. Here was a woman
whose usual habit was a rather lazy good humour; but of late there
had been a look and an air of suppressed fury, the burning glance of
a jealous woman, the rage of despised beauty. She spoke little, and
then as briefly as possible; but one might suspect flames and fires
within. Last had seen this and wondered, but not very much, being
resolved to mind his own business. He had supposed there had been
some difference of opinion between her and her husband; very likely
about the re-arrangement of the drawing-room furniture and hiring a
grand piano. He certainly had not thought of tracing Mrs. Marsh's
altered air to the villainous crime that had been committed. And now
Marsh was telling him that these glances of concealed rage were the
outward signs of tender maternal anxiety; and not one word of all
that did he believe. He put Marsh's half-hidden terror beside his
wife's half-hidden fury; he thought of the book in the summer-house
and things that were being whispered about the horror in the wood:
and loathing and dread possessed him. He had no proof, it was true;
merely conjecture, but he felt no doubt. There could be no other
explanation. And what could he do, but leave this terrible place?</p>

<p>Last could get no sleep. He undressed and went to bed, and tossed
about in the half-dark of the summer night. Then he lit his lamp and
dressed again, and wondered whether he had better not steal away
without a word, and walk the eight miles to the station, and escape
by the first train that went to London. It was not merely loathing
for the man and his works; it was deadly fear, also, that urged him
to fly from the White House. He felt sure that if Marsh guessed at
his suspicions of the truth, his life might well be in danger. There
was no mercy or scruple in that evil man. He might even now be at his
door, listening, waiting. There was cold terror in his heart, and
cold sweat pouring at the thought. He paced softly up and down his
room in his bare feet, pausing now and again to listen for that other
soft step outside. He locked the door as silently as he could, and
felt safer. He would wait till the day came and people were stirring
about the house, and then he might venture to come out and make his
escape.</p>

<p>And yet when he heard the servants moving over their work, he
hesitated. The light of the sun was shining in the valley, and the
white mist over the silver river floated upward and vanished; the
sweet breath of the wood entered the window of his room. The black
horror and fear were raised from his spirit. He began to hesitate, to
suspect his judgment, to enquire whether he had not rushed to his
black conclusions in a panic of the night. His logical deductions at
midnight seemed to smell of nightmare in the brightness of that
valley; the song of the aspiring lark confuted him. He remembered
Garraway's great argument after a famous supper at the Turk's Head:
that it was always unsafe to make improbability the guide of life. He
would delay a little, and keep a sharp look out, and be sure before
taking sudden and violent action. And perhaps the truth was that Last
was influenced very strongly by his aversion from leaving young
Henry, whose extraordinary brilliance and intelligence amazed and
delighted him more and more.</p>

<p>It was still early when at last he left his room, and went out
into the fine morning air. It was an hour or more before
breakfast-time, and he set out on the path that led past the wall of
the kitchen garden up the hill and into the heart of the wood. He
paused a moment at the upper corner, and turned round to look across
the river at the happy country showing its morning magic and delight.
As he dawdled and gazed, he heard soft steps approaching on the other
side of the wall, and low voices murmuring. Then, as the steps drew
near, one of the voices was raised a little, and Last heard Mrs.
Marsh speaking:</p>

<p>"Too old, am I? And thirteen is too young. Is it to be seventeen
next when you can get her into the wood? And after all I have done
for you, and after what you have done to me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh enumerated all these things without remission, and
without any quiver of shame in her voice. She paused for a moment.
Perhaps her rage was choking her; and there was a shrill piping
cackle of derision, as if Marsh's voice had cracked in its
contempt.</p>

<p>Very softly, but very swiftly, Last, the man with the grey face
and the staring eyes, bolted for his life, down and away from the
White House. Once in the road, free from the fields and brakes, he
changed his run into a walk, and he never paused or stopped, till he
came with a gulp of relief into the ugly streets of the big
industrial town. He made his way to the station at once, and found
that he was an hour too soon for the London Express. So there was
plenty of time for breakfast; which consisted of brandy.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>The tutor went back to his old life and his old ways, and did his
best to forget the strange and horrible interlude of the White House.
He gathered his podgy pups once more about him; crammed and coached,
read with undergraduates during the long vacation, and was moderately
satisfied with the course of things in general. Now and then, when he
was endeavouring to persuade the podges against their deliberate
judgment that Latin and Greek were languages once spoken by human
beings, not senseless enigmas invented by demons, he would think with
a sigh of regret of the boy who understood and longed to understand.
And he wondered whether he had not been a coward to leave that
enchanting child to the evil mercies of his hideous parents. But what
could he have done? But it was dreadful to think of Henry, slowly or
swiftly corrupted by his detestable father and mother, growing up
with the fat slime of their abominations upon him.</p>

<p>He went into no detail with his old friends. He hinted that there
had been grave unpleasantness, which made it impossible for him to
remain in the west. They nodded, and perceiving that the subject was
a sore one, asked no questions, and talked of old books and the new
steak instead. They all agreed, in fact, that the steak was far too
new, and William was summoned to explain this horror. Didn't he know
that beefsteak, beefsteak meant for the consumption of Christian men,
as distinguished from Hottentots, required hanging just as much as
game? William the ponderous and benignant, tasted and tested, and
agreed; with sorrowful regret. He apologised, and went on to say that
as the gentlemen would not care to wait for a fowl, he would suggest
a very special, tender, and juicy fillet of roast veal, then in cut.
The suggestion was accepted, and found excellent. The conversation
turned to Choric Metres and Florence St. John at the Strand. There
was Port later.</p>

<p>It was many years afterwards, when this old life, after crumbling
for a long while, had come down with a final crash, that Last heard
the real story of his tutorial engagement at the White House. Three
dreadful people were put in the dock at the Old Bailey. There was an
old man, with the look of a deadly snake; a fat, sloppy, deplorable
woman with pendulous cheeks and a faint hint of perished beauty in
her eyes; and to the utter blank amazement of those who did not know
the story, a wonderful little boy. The people who saw him in court
said he might have been taken for a child of nine or ten; no more.
But the evidence that was given showed that he must be between fifty
and sixty at the least; perhaps more than that.</p>

<p>The indictment charged these three people with an unspeakable and
hideous crime. They were charged under the name of Mailey, the name
which they had borne at the time of their arrest; but it turned out
at the end of the trial that they had been known by many names in the
course of their career: Mailey, Despasse, Lartigan, Delarue, Falcon,
Lecossic, Hammond, Marsh, Haringworth. It was established that the
apparent boy, whom Last had known as Henry Marsh, was no relation of
any kind to the elder prisoners. "Henry's" origins were deeply
obscure. It was conjectured that he was the illegitimate son of a
very high Englishman, a diplomatist, whose influence had counted for
a great deal in the Far East. Nobody knew anything about the mother.
The boy showed brilliant promise from very early years, and the
father, a bachelor, and disliking what little he knew of his
relations, left his very large fortune to his son. The diplomatist
died when the boy was twelve years old; and he had been aged, and
more than aged when the child was born. People remarked that Arthur
Wesley, as he was then called, was very short for his years, and he
remained short, and his face remained that of a boy of seven or
eight. He could not be sent to a school, so he was privately
educated. When he was of age, the trustees had the extraordinary
experience of placing a very considerable property in the hands of a
young man who looked like a little boy. Very soon afterwards, Arthur
Wesley disappeared. Dubious rumours spoke of reappearances, now here,
now there, in all quarters of the world. There were tales that he had
"gone fantee" in what was then unknown Africa, when the Mountains of
the Moon still lingered on the older maps. It was reported, again,
that he had gone exploring in the higher waters of the Amazon, and
had never come back; but a few years later a personage that must have
been Arthur Wesley was displaying unpleasant activities in Macao. It
was soon after this period, according to the prosecution,
that&mdash;in the words of counsel&mdash;he realised the necessity of
"taking cover." His extraordinary personality, naturally enough, drew
attention to him and his doings, and these doings being generally or
always of an infamous kind, such attention was both inconvenient and
dangerous. Somewhere in the East, and in very bad company, he came
upon the two people who were charged with him. Arabella Manning, who
was said to have respectable connections in Wiltshire, had gone out
to the East as a governess, but had soon found other occupations.
Meers had been a clerk in a house of business at Shanghai. His very
ingenious system of fraud obtained his discharge, but, for some
reason or other, the firm refused to prosecute, and Meers
went&mdash;where Arthur Wesley found him. Wesley thought of his great
plan. Manning and Meers were to pretend to be Mr. and Mrs.
Marsh&mdash;that seemed to have been their original style&mdash;and
he was to be their little boy. He paid them well for their various
services: Arabella was his mistress-in-chief, the companion of his
milder moments, for some years. Occasionally, a tutor was engaged to
make the situation more plausible. In this state, the horrible trio
peregrinated over the earth.</p>

<p>The court heard all this, and much more, after the jury had found
the three prisoners guilty of the particular offence with which they
were charged. This last crime&mdash;which the Press had to enfold in
paraphrase and periphrase&mdash;had been discovered, strange as it
seemed, largely as a result of the woman's jealousy. Wesley's ...
affections, let us call them, were still apt to wander, and
Arabella's jealous rage drove her beyond all caution and all control.
She was the weak joint in Wesley's armour, the rent in his cover.
People in court looked at the two; the debauched, deplorable woman
with her flagging, sagging cheeks, and the dim fire still burning in
her weary old eyes, and at Wesley, still, to all appearance, a bright
and handsome little boy; they gasped with amazement at the grotesque,
impossible horror of the scene. The judge raised his head from his
notes, and gazed steadily at the convicted persons for some moments;
his lips were tightly compressed.</p>

<p>The detective drew to the end of his portentous history. The track
of these people, he said, had been marked by many terrible scandals,
but till quite lately there had been no suspicion of their guilt. Two
of these cases involved the capital charge: but formal evidence was
lacking.</p>

<p>He drew to his close.</p>

<p>"In spite of his diminutive stature and juvenile appearance, the
prisoner, Charles Mailey, <i>alias</i> Arthur Wesley, made a
desperate resistance to his arrest. He is possessed of immense
strength for his size, and almost choked one of the officers who
arrested him."</p>

<p>The formulas of the court were uttered. The judge, without a word
of comment, sentenced Mailey, or Wesley, to imprisonment for life,
John Meers to fifteen years' imprisonment, Arabella Manning to ten
years' imprisonment.</p>

<p>The old world, it has been noted, had crashed down. Many, many
years had passed since Last had been hunted out of Mowbray Street,
that went down dingily, peacefully from the Strand. Mowbray Street
was now all blazing office buildings. Later, he had been driven from
one nook and corner and snug retreat after another as new London rose
in majesty and splendour. But for a year or more he had lain hidden
in a by-street that had the advantage of leading into a disused
graveyard near the Gray's Inn Road. Medwin and Garraway were dead;
but Last summoned the surviving Zouch and Noel to his abode one
night; and then and there made punch, and good punch for them.</p>

<p>"It's so jolly it must be sinful," he said, as he pared his
lemons, "but up to the present I believe it is not illegal. And I
still have a few bottles of that port I bought in 'ninety-two."</p>

<p>And then he told them for the first time all the whole story of
his engagement at the White House.</p>

<h2>The Tree of Life</h2>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>The Morgans of Llantrisant were regarded for many centuries as
among the most considerable of the landed gentry of South Wales. They
had been called Reformation <i>parvenus</i>, but this was a piece of
unhistorical and unjust abuse. They could trace their descent back,
without doubt, certainly as far as Morgan ab Ifor, who fought and, no
doubt, flourished in his way <i>c</i>. 980. He, in his turn, was
always regarded as of the tribe of St. Teilo; and the family kept, as
a most precious relic, a portable altar which was supposed to have
belonged to the saint. And for many hundred years, the eldest son had
borne the name of Teilo. They had intermarried, now and again, with
the Normans, and lived in a thirteenth-century castle, with certain
additions for comfort and amenity made in the reign of Henry VII,
whose cause they had supported with considerable energy. From Henry,
they had received grants of forfeited estates, both in Monmouthshire
and Glamorganshire. At the dissolution of the religious houses, the
Sir Teilo of the day was given Llantrisant Abbey with all its
possessions. The monastic church was stripped of its lead roof, and
soon fell into ruin, and became a quarry for the neighbourhood. The
abbot's lodging and other of the monastic buildings were kept in
repair, and being situated in a sheltered valley, were used by the
family as a winter residence in preference to the castle, which was
on a bare hill, high above the abbey. In the seventeenth century, Sir
Henry Morgan&mdash;his elder brother had died young&mdash;was a
Parliament man. He changed his opinions, and rose for the King in
1648; and, in consequence, had the mortification of seeing the outer
wall of the castle on the hill, not razed to the ground, but
carefully reduced to a height of four or five feet by the Cromwellian
major-general commanding in the west. Later in the century, the
Morgans became Whigs, and later still were able to support Mr.
Gladstone, up to the Home Rule Bill of 1886. They still held most of
the lands which they had gathered together gradually for eight or
nine hundred years. Many of these lands had been wild, remote, and
mountainous, of little use or profit save for the sport of hunting
the hare; but early in the nineteenth century mining experts from the
north, Fothergills and Renshaws, had found coal, and pits were sunk
in the wild places, and the Morgans became wealthy: in the modern
way. By consequence, the bad seasons of the late 'seventies and the
agricultural depression of the early 'eighties hardly touched them.
They reduced rents and remitted arrears and throve on their mining
royalties: they were still great people of the county. It was a very
great pity that Teilo Morgan of Llantrisant was an invalid and an
enforced recluse; especially as he was devoted to the memories of his
house, and to the estate, and to the interests of the people on
it.</p>

<p>The Llantrisant Abbey of his day had been so altered from age to
age that the last abbot would certainly have seen little that was
familiar to his eyes. It was set in rich and pleasant meadow-land,
with woods of oak and beech, and ash and elm all about it. Through
the park ran the swift, clear river, Avon Torfaen, the stone or
boulder-crusher, so named from its furious courses in the mountains
where it rose. And the hills stood round the Abbey on every side.
Here and there in the southern-facing front of the house, there could
be seen traces of fifteenth-century building; but on this had been
imposed the Elizabethan gables of the first lay resident, and Inigo
Jones was said to have added the brick wing with the Corinthian
pilasters, and there was a stuccoed projection in the sham Gothic of
the time of George II. It was architecturally ridiculous, but it was
supposed to be the warmest part of the house, and Teilo Morgan
occupied a set of five or six rooms on the first floor, and often
looked out on the park, and opened the windows to hear the sound of
the pouring Avon, and the murmur of the wood-pigeons in the trees,
and the noise of the west wind from the mountain. He longed to be out
among it all, running as he saw boys running on the hill-side through
a gap in the wood; but he knew that there was a gulf fixed between
him and that paradise. There was, it seemed, no specific disease but
a profound weakness, a <i>marasmus</i> that had stopped short of its
term, but kept the patient chronically incapable of any physical
exertion, even the slightest. They had once tried taking him out on a
very fine day in the park, in a wheeled chair; but even that easy
motion was too much for him. After ten minutes, he had fainted, and
lay for two or three days on his back, alive, but little more than
alive. Most of his time was spent on a couch. He would sit up for his
meals and to interview the estate agent; but it was effort to do so
much as this. He used to read in county histories and in old family
records of the doings of his ancestors; and wonder what they would
have said to such a successor. The storming of castles at dead
darkness of night, the firing of them so that the mountains far away
shone, the arrows of the Gwent bowmen darkening the air at
Cr&eacute;cy, the battle of the dawn by the river, when it was seen
scarlet by the first light in the east, the drinking of Gascon wine
in hall from moonrise to sunrise; he was no figure for the old days
and works of the Morgans.</p>

<p>It was probable that his feeble life was chiefly sustained by his
intense interest in the doings of the estate. The agent, Captain
Vaughan, a keen, middle-aged man, had often told him that a monthly
interview would be sufficient and more than sufficient. "I'm afraid
you find all this detail terribly tiring," he would say. "And you
know it's not really necessary. I've one or two good men under me,
and between us we manage to keep things in very decent order. I do
assure you, you needn't bother. As a matter of fact; if I brought you
a statement once a quarter, it would be quite enough."</p>

<p>But Teilo Morgan would not entertain any such laxity.</p>

<p>"It doesn't tire me in the least," he always replied to the
agent's remonstrances. "It does me good. You know a man must have
exercise in some form or another. I get mine on your legs. I'm still
enjoying that tramp of yours up to Castell-y-Bwch three years ago.
You remember?"</p>

<p>Captain Vaughan seemed at a loss for a moment.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he said. "Three years ago? Castell-y-Bwch? Now, what
was I doing up there?"</p>

<p>"You can't have forgotten. Don't you recollect? It was just after
the great snowstorm. You went up to see that the roof was all right,
and fell into a fifteen-foot drift on the way."</p>

<p>"I remember now," said Vaughan. "I should think I do remember. I
don't think I've been so cold and so wet before or since&mdash;worse
than the Balkans. I wasn't prepared for it. And when I got through
the snow, there was an infernal mountain stream still going strong
beneath it all."</p>

<p>"But there was a good fire at the pub when you got there?"</p>

<p>"Half-way up the chimney; coal and wood mixed; roaring, I've never
seen such a blaze: six foot by three, I should think. And I told them
to mix it strong."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd been there," said the squire. "Let me see; you
recommended that some work should be done on the place, didn't you?
Re-roofing, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the slates were in a bad way, and in the following March we
replaced them by stone tiles, extra heavy. Slates are not good
enough, half-way up the mountain. To the west, of course, the place
is more or less protected by the wood, but the south-east pine end is
badly exposed and was letting the wet through, so I ran up an oak
frame, nine inches from the wall, and fixed tiles on that. You
remember passing the estimate?"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course. And it's done all right? No trouble
since?"</p>

<p>"No trouble with wind or weather. When I was there last, the fat
daughter was talking about going to service in Cardiff. I don't think
Mrs. Samuel fancied it much. And young William wants to go down the
pit when he leaves school."</p>

<p>"Thomas is staying to help his father with the farm, I hope? And
how is the farm doing now?"</p>

<p>"Fairly well. They pay their rent regularly, as you know. In spite
of what I tell them, they will try to grow wheat. It's much too high
up."</p>

<p>"How do the people on the mountain like the new parson?"</p>

<p>"They get on with him all right. He tries to persuade them to come
to Mass, as he calls it, and they stay away and go to meeting. But
quite on friendly terms&mdash;out of business hours."</p>

<p>"I see. I should think he would be more at home in one of the
Cardiff parishes. We must see if it can't be worked somehow. And how
about those new pigsties at Ty, Captain? Have you got the estimate
with you? Read it out, will you? My eyes are tired this morning. You
went to Davies for the estimate? That's right: the policy of the
estate is, always encourage the small man. Have you looked into that
business of the marsh?"</p>

<p>"The marsh? Oh, you mean at Kemeys? Yes, I've gone into it. But I
don't think it would pay for draining. You'd never see your money
back."</p>

<p>"You think not? That's a pity."</p>

<p>Teilo Morgan seemed depressed by the agent's judgment on the
Kemeys marshland. He weighed the matter.</p>

<p>"Well; I suppose you are right. We mustn't go in for fancy
farming. But look here! It's just struck me. Why not utilise the
marsh for growing willows? We could run a sluice from the brook right
across it. It might be possible to start basket-making&mdash;in a
small way, of course, at first. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"That wants looking into," said Captain Vaughan. "I know a place
in Somerset where they are doing something of the kind. I'll go over
on Wednesday and see if I can get some useful information. I hardly
think the margin of profit would be a big one. But you would be
satisfied with two per cent?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. And here's a thing I've been wanting to talk to you
about for a long time&mdash;for the last three or four Mondays
&mdash;and I've always forgotten: You know the Graeg on the home
farm? A beautiful southern exposure, and practically wasted. I feel
sure that egg-plants would do splendidly there. Could you manage to
get out some figures for next Monday? There's no reason why the
egg-plant shouldn't become as popular as the tomato and the banana;
if a cheap supply were forthcoming. You will see to that, won't you?
If you're busy, you might put off going to Somerset till next week:
no hurry about the marsh."</p>

<p>"Very good. The Graeg: egg-plants." The agent made an entry in his
note-book, and took his leave soon afterwards. He paced a long
corridor till he came to the gallery, from which the main staircase
of the Abbey went down to the entrance hall. There he encountered an
important-looking personage, square-chinned, black-coated, slightly
grizzled.</p>

<p>"As usual, I suppose?" the personage enquired.</p>

<p>"As usual."</p>

<p>"What was it this time?"</p>

<p>"Egg-plants."</p>

<p>The important one nodded, and Captain Vaughan went on his way.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>As soon as the agent had gone, Teilo Morgan rang a bell. His man
came, and lifted him skilfully out of the big chair, and laid him on
the day-bed by the window, propping him with cushions behind his
back.</p>

<p>"Two cushions will be enough," said the squire. "I'm rather tired
this morning."</p>

<p>The man put the bell within easy reach, and went out softly. Teilo
Morgan lay back quite still; thinking of old days, and of happy
years, and of the bad season that followed them. His first
recollections were of a little cottage, snow-white, high upon the
mountain, a little higher than the hamlet of Castell-y-Bwch, of which
he had been talking to the agent. The shining walls of the cottage,
freshly whitened every Easter, were very thick, and sloped outward to
the ground: the windows were deep-set in the wall. By the porch which
sheltered the front door from the great winds of the mountain, were
two shrubs, one on each side, that were covered in their season with
orange-coloured flowers, as round as oranges, and these golden
flowers were, in his memory, tossed and shaken to and fro, in the
breeze that always blew in that high land, when every leaf and
blossom of the lower slopes were still. About the house was the
garden, and a rough field, and a small cherry orchard, in a sheltered
dip of land, and a well dripping from the grey rock with water very
clear and cold. Above the cottage and its small demesne came a high
bank, with a hedge of straggling, wind-beaten trees and bramble
thickets on top of it, and beyond, the steep and wild ascent of the
mountain, where the dark green whin bushes bore purple berries, where
white cotton grew on the grass, and the bracken shimmered in the sun,
and the imperial heather glowed on golden autumn days. Teilo
remembered well how, a long age ago, he would stand in summer weather
by the white porch, and look down on the great territory, as if on
the whole world, far below: wave following wave of hill and valley,
of dark wood and green pastures and cornfields, pale green or golden,
the white farms shining, the mist of blue smoke above the Roman city,
and to the right, the far waters of the yellow sea. And then there
were the winter nights: all the air black as pitch, and a noise of
tumult and battle, when the great winds and driving rain beat upon
wall and window; and it was praise and thanksgiving to lie safe and
snug in a cot by the settle near the light and the warmth of the
fire, while without the heavens and the hills were confounded
together in the roaring darkness.</p>

<p>In the white cottage on the high land, Teilo had lived with his
mother and grandmother, very old, bent and wrinkled; with a sallow
face, and hair still black in spite of long years. But he was a very
small boy, when a gentleman who had often been there before, came and
took his mother and himself away, down into the valley; and his next
memories were of the splendours of Llantrisant Abbey, where the three
of them lived together, and were waited on by many servants, and he
found that the gentleman was his father: a cheerful man, always
laughing, with bright blue eyes and a thick, tawny moustache, that
drooped over his chin. Here Teilo ran about the park, and raced
sticks in the racing Avon, and climbed up the steep hill they called
the Graeg, and liked to be there because with the shimmering,
sweet-scented bracken it was like the mountain-side. His walks and
runs and climbs did not last long. The strange illness that nobody
seemed to understand struck him down, and when after many weeks of
bitter pains and angry, fiery dreams, the anguish of day and night
left him; he was weak and helpless, and lay still, waiting to get
well, and never got well again. Month after month be lay there in his
bed, able to move his hands faintly, and no more. At the end of a
year he felt a little stronger and tried to walk, and just managed to
get across the room, helping himself from chair to chair. There was
one thing that was for the better: he had been a silent child, happy
to sit all by himself hour after hour on the mountain and then on the
steep slope of the Graeg, without uttering a word or wanting anyone
to come and talk to him. Now, in his weakness, he chattered eagerly,
and thought of admirable things. He would tell his father and mother
all the schemes and plans he was making; and he wondered why they
looked so sadly at him.</p>

<p>And then, disaster. His father died, and his mother and he had to
leave Llantrisant Abbey; they never told him why. They went to live
in a grey, dreary street somewhere in the north of London. It was a
place full of ugly sights and sounds, with a stench of burning bones
always in the heavy air, and an unseemly litter of egg-shells and
torn paper and cabbage-stalks about the gutters, and screams and
harsh cries fouling the ears at midnight. And in winter, the yellow
sulphur mist shut out the sky and burned sourly in the nostrils. A
dreadful place, and the exile was long there. His mother went out on
most days soon after breakfast, and often did not come back till ten,
eleven, twelve at night, tired to death, as she said, and her dark
beauty all marred and broken. Two or three times, in the course of
the day, a neighbour from the floor below would come in and see if he
wanted anything; but, except for these visits, he lay alone all the
hours, and read in the few old books that they had in the room. It
was a life of bewildered misery. There was not much to eat, and what
there was seemed not to have the right taste or smell; and he could
not understand why they should have to live in the horrible street,
since his mother had told him that now his father was dead, he was
the rightful master of Llantrisant Abbey and should be a very rich
man. "Then why are we in this dreadful place?" he asked her; and she
only cried.</p>

<p>And then his mother died. And a few days after the funeral, people
came and took him away; and he found himself once more at
Llantrisant, master of it all, as his mother had told him he should
be. He made up his mind to learn all about the lands and farms that
he owned, and got them to bring him the books of the estate, and then
Captain Vaughan began to come and see him, and tell him how things
were going on, and how this farmer was the best tenant in the county,
and how that man had nothing but bad luck, and John Williams would
put gin in his cider, and drive breakneck down steep, stony lanes on
market nights, standing up in the cart like a Roman charioteer. He
learnt about all these works and ways, and how the land was farmed,
and what was done and what was needed to be done in the farmhouses
and farm-buildings, and asked the agent about all his visits of
inspection and enquiry, till he felt that he knew every field and
footpath on the Llantrisant estate, and could find his way to every
farm-house and cottage chimney corner from the mountain to the sea.
It was the absorbing interest and the great happiness of his life;
and he was proud to think of all he had done for the land and for the
people on it. They were excellent people, farmers, but apt to be too
conservative, too much given to stick in the old ruts that their
fathers and grandfathers had made, obstinately loyal to old methods
in a new world. For example, there was Williams, Penyrhaul, who
almost refused to grow roots, and Evan Thomas, Glascoed, who didn't
believe in drainpipes, and tried to convince Vaughan that bush
drainage was better for the land, and half a dozen, at least, who
were sure that all artificials exhausted the soil, and the silly
fellow who had brought his black Castle Martins with him from
Pembrokeshire, and turned up his nose at Shorthorns and Herefords.
Still, Vaughan had a way with him, and made most of them see reason
sooner or later; and they all knew that there was not another estate
in England or Wales that was so ready to meet its tenants halfway,
and do repairs and build new barns and cowsheds very often before
they were asked. Teilo Morgan gave his agent all the credit he
deserved, but at the same time he could not help feeling that in
spite of his disabilities, of the weakness that kept him a prisoner
to these four or five rooms, so that he had not once gone over the
rest of the Abbey since his return to it; in spite of his invalid and
stricken days, a great deal was owing to himself and to the fresh
ideas that he had brought to the management of the estate. He took in
the farming journals, and was thoroughly well read in the latest
literature that dealt with the various branches of agriculture, and
he knew in consequence that he was well in advance of his time, in
advance even of the most forward agriculturalists of the day.</p>

<p>There were methods and schemes and ideas in full course of
practical and successful working on the Llantrisant property that
were absolutely unheard of on any other estate in the country. He had
wanted to discuss some of these ideas in the Press; but Vaughan had
dissuaded him; he said that for the present the force of prejudice
was too strong. Vaughan was possibly right; all the same Teilo Morgan
knew that he was making agricultural history. In the meantime, he was
jotting down careful and elaborate notes on the experiments that were
being tried, and in a year or two he intended to put a book on the
stocks: <i>The Llantrisant Estates: a New Era in Farming</i>.</p>

<p>He was pondering happily in this strain, when, in a flash, a
brilliant, a dazzling notion came to him. He drew a long breath of
delighted wonder; then rang his hand-bell, and told the man that he
might now put in the third cushion&mdash;"and give me my writing
things." A handy contraption, with paper, ink and the rest was
adjusted before him, and as soon as the servant was gone, Teilo began
a letter, his eyes bright with excitement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Dear Vaughan</span>,<br>
 "I know you think I'm inclined to be rather too experimental in my
farming; I believe that this time you will agree that I have hit on a
great idea. Don't say a word to anybody about it. I am astonished
that it hasn't been thought of long ago, and my only fear is that we
may be forestalled. I suppose the fact is that it has been staring us
all in the face so long that we haven't noticed it!</p>

<p>"My idea is simply this; a plantation, or orchard, if you like, of
the Arbor Vit&aelig;; and I know the exact place for it. You have
often told me how Jenkins of the Garth insists on having those fields
of his by the Soar down in potatoes, a most unsuitable place for such
a crop. I want you to go and see him as soon as you have time, and
tell him we want the use of the fields&mdash;about five acres, if I
remember. Of course, he must be compensated, and, within reason, you
can be as liberal as you like. I have understood from you that the
soil is a deep, rich loam, in very good heart; it should be an ideal
position for the culture I intend. I believe that the Arbor
Vit&aelig; will flourish anywhere, and is practically indifferent to
climatic conditions: 'makes its own climate,' as one writer rather
poetically expresses it. Still, its culture in this county is an
experiment; and I am sure Mharadwys&mdash;I think that's the old name
of those fields by the Soar&mdash;is the very spot.</p>

<p>"The land must be thoroughly trenched. Get this put in hand as
soon as you can possibly manage it. Let them leave it in ridges, so
that the winter frosts can break it up. Then, if we give it a good
dressing of superphosphate of lime and bone meal in the spring, and
plough in September, everything will be ready for the autumn
planting. You know I always insist on shallow planting; don't bury
the roots in a hole; spread them out evenly within five or six inches
of the surface; let them feel the sun. And when it comes to staking;
mind that each tree has two stakes, crossed at the top, with the,
points driven into the ground at a good distance from the, roots. I
am sure that the single stake, close to the tree stem, with its point
driven through the roots is very bad practice.</p>

<p>"Of course, you will appreciate the importance of this new
culture. The twelve distinct kinds of fruit produced by this
extraordinary tree, all of them of delicious flavour, render it
absolutely unique. Whatever the cost of the experiment may be, I am
sure it will be made good in a very short time. And it must be
remembered that while the name, <i>Tous les mois</i>, given to a kind
of strawberry cultivated on the continent, really only implies that
the plants fruit all through the summer and early autumn, in the case
of the Arbor Vit&aelig;, the claim may be made with literal truth. As
the old writers say: 'The Arbor yielded her fruit ever month.' No
other cropper, however heavy, can be compared with it. And in
addition to all this, the leaves are said to possess the most
valuable therapeutic qualities.</p>

<p>"Don't you agree with me that this will prove by far the most
important and far-reaching of all our experiments?<br>
<span style="margin: 2em;">"I remain,<br>
</span> <span style="margin: 4em;">"Yours sincerely,<br>
</span> <span class="smcap" style="margin: 6em;">Teilo
Morgan</span>.</p>

<p>"P.S. On consideration; I think it might be better to keep the
dressing of super and bone meal till the autumn, just before
ploughing.</p>

<p>"And you might as well begin to look up the Nurserymens'
Catalogues. As we shall be giving a large order, you may have to
place it with two or three firms. I think you will find the Arbor
Vit&aelig; listed with the Conifer&aelig;."</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Long years after all this, two elderly men were talking together
in a club smoking-room. They had the place almost to themselves; most
of the members, having lunched and taken their coffee and cigarettes,
had strolled away. There was a small knot of men with their heads
close together over the table, chuckling and relating and hearing
juicy gossip. Two or three others were dotted about the solemn,
funebrous room, each apart with his paper, deep in his arm-chair. Our
two were in a retired corner, which might have been called snug in
any other place. They were old friends, it appeared, and one, the
less elderly, had returned not long before from some far place, after
an absence of many years.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen anything of Harry Morgan since I've been home," he
remarked. "I suppose he's still in town."</p>

<p>"Still in Beresford Street. But he doesn't get out so much now.
He's getting a bit stiff in the joints. A good ten years older than I
am."</p>

<p>"I should like to see him again. I always thought him a very good
fellow."</p>

<p>"A first-rate fellow. You know that story about Bartle Frere? Man
was sent to meet him at the station, and asked how he should know
him. They told him to look out for an old gentleman with grey
whiskers helping somebody&mdash;and he found Frere helping an old
woman with a big basket out of a third-class carriage. Harry Morgan
was like that&mdash;except for the whiskers."</p>

<p>There was a pause; and then the man who had retold the old Sir
Bartle Frere story began again.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you ever heard the kindest thing Morgan ever
did&mdash;one of the kindest things I've ever heard of. You know I
come from his part of the country: my people used to have Plas Henoc,
only a few miles from Llantrisant Abbey, the Morgans' place. My
father told me all about it; Harry kept the thing very dark. Upon my
word! what is it about a man not letting his left hand know what his
right hand is about? Morgan has lived up to that if any man ever did.
Well, it was like this:</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of old Teilo Morgan? He was a bit before our
day. Not an old man, by the way; I don't suppose he was much over
forty when he died. Well, he went the pace in the old style. He was
very well known in town, not in society, or rather in damned bad
society, and not far from here either. They had a picture of him in
some low print of the time, with those long whiskers that used to be
worn then. They didn't give his name; just called it, 'The Hero of
the Haymarket.' You wouldn't believe it, would you, but in those days
the Haymarket was the great place for night-houses&mdash;Kate
Hamilton and all that lot. Morgan was in the thick of it all; but
that picture annoyed him; he had those whiskers of his cut off at
Truefitt's the very next day. He was the sort of man they got the
silver dinner service out for, when he entertained his friends at
Cremorne. And 'Judge and Jury,' and the <i>poses plastiques</i>, and
that place in Windmill Street where they fought without the
gloves&mdash;and all the rest of it.</p>

<p>"And it was just as bad down in the country. He used to take his
London friends, male and female, down there, and lead the sort of
life he lived in town, as near as he could make it. They used to tell
a story, true very likely, of how he and half a dozen rapscallions
like himself were putting away the port after dinner, and making a
devil of a noise, all talking and shouting and cursing at the top of
their, voices, when Teilo seemed to pull himself together and get
very grave all in a minute. 'Silence! gentlemen!' he called out. The
rest of them took no notice; one of them started a blackguard song,
and the others got ready to join in the chorus. 'Hold your damned
tongues, damn you!' Morgan bawled at them, and smashed a big decanter
on the table. 'D'you think,' he said, 'that that's the sort of thing
for youngsters to listen to? Have you no sense of decency? Didn't I
tell you that the children were coming down to dessert?' With that,
he rang a bell that was by him on the table and&mdash;so the story
goes&mdash;six young fellows and six girls came trooping down the big
staircase: without a single stitch on them, calling out in squeaky
voices: 'Oh, dear Papa, what have you done to dear Mamma?' And the
rest of it."</p>

<p>The phrase was evidently an inclusive, vague, but altogether
damnatory clause with this teller of old tales.</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, "you can imagine what the county thought of
all that sort of thing. Teilo Morgan made Llantrisant Abbey stink in
their nostrils. Naturally, none of them would go near the place. The
women, who were, perhaps, rather more particular about such matters
than they are now, simply wouldn't have Morgan's name mentioned in
their presence. The Duke cut him dead in the street. His subscription
to the Hunt was returned. I don't think he cared. You know Garden
Parties were beginning to get fashionable then, and they say Morgan
sent out engraved invitation cards, with a picture of a Nymph and a
Satyr on them that some artist fellow had done for him&mdash;not a
nice picture at all according to county standards. And what d'ye
think he had at the bottom of the card instead of R.S.V.P.?&mdash;'No
clothes by request.' He was a damned impudent fellow, if you like. I
believe the party came off all right, with more friends from town,
and most unusual games and sports on the lawn and in the shrubberies.
It was said that Treowen, the Duke's son, was there; but he always
swore through thick and thin that it was a lie. But it was brought up
against him afterwards when he stood with Herbert for the county.
"And what d'ye think happened next? A most extraordinary thing.
Nobody was prepared for it. Everyone said he would just drink and
devil and wench himself to death, and a damned good riddance. Well,
I'll tell you. There was one thing, you know, that everybody had to
confess: in his very worst days Teilo Morgan always left the country
girls alone. Never interfered with the farmers' daughters or cottage
girls or anything in that way. And then, one fine day when he was up
with a keeper looking after a few head of grouse he had on the
mountain, what should he do but fall in love with a girl of fifteen,
who lived with her mother or grandmother, I don't know which, in a
cottage right up there. Mary Trevor, I believe her name was. My
father had seen her once or twice afterwards driving with Morgan in
his tandem: he said she was a most beautiful creature, a perfectly
lovely woman. She was a type that you see sometimes in Wales: very
dark, black eyes, black hair, oval face, skin a pale olive&mdash;not
at all unlike those girls that used to prance up and down Arles in
Southern France, with their hair done up in velvet ribbons; I don't
know whether you've ever been there? There's something Oriental about
that style of beauty; it doesn't last long.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, Teilo Morgan fell flat on the spot. He went straight down
to the Abbey and packed the whole company back to town&mdash;told
them they could go to hell, or bloody Jerusalem, or the Haymarket,
for all he cared. As soon as they'd all gone, he was off to the
mountain again. He wasn't seen at the Abbey for weeks. I am sure I
don't know why he didn't marry the girl straight away; nobody knew.
She said that he did marry her; but we shall come to that presently.
In due course, the baby came along, and Morgan wanted to pension off
the old lady and take the mother and child down to Llantrisant. But
the doctors advised against it. I believe Morgan got some very good
men down, and they were all inclined to shake their heads over the
child. I don't think they committed themselves or named any distinct
disease or anything of that kind; but they were all agreed that there
was a certain delicacy of constitution, and that the boy would have a
much better chance if they kept him up in the mountain air for the
first few years of his life. Llantrisant Abbey, I should tell you, is
right down in the valley by the river, with woods and hills all round
it; fine place, but rather damp and relaxing, I dare say. So, the
long and short of it was that young Teilo stayed up with his mother
and the old woman, and old Teilo used to come and see them for
week-ends, as they say now, till the boy was four or five years old;
and then the old lady was looked after somewhere or other, and the
mother and son went to live at the Abbey.</p>

<p>"Everything went on all right&mdash;except that the county people
kept away&mdash;for three or four years. The child seemed well and
strong, and the tutor they got in for him said he was a tremendous
fellow with his books, well in advance of his age, unusually
interested in his work and all that. Then he got ill, very ill
indeed. I don't know what it was; some brain trouble, I should think,
meningitis or something of that sort. It was touch and go for weeks,
and it left the unfortunate little chap an absolute wreck at the end
of it. For a long time they thought he was paralysed; all the
strength had gone out of his limbs. And the worst of it was, the mind
was affected. He seemed bright enough, mind you; nothing dull or
heavy about him; and I'm told you might listen to him chattering away
for half an hour on end, and go away thinking he was a perfect
phenomenon of a child for intelligence. But if you listened long
enough, you'd hear something that would pull you up with a jerk.
Crazy?&mdash;yes, and worse than crazy&mdash;mixed up in a way with a
kind of sense, so that you might begin to wonder which was queer,
yourself or the boy. It was a dreadful grief to the parents,
especially to his father. He used to talk about his sins finding him
out. I don't know, there may have been something in that. 'Whips to
scourge us'&mdash;perhaps so.</p>

<p>"They got the tutor back after some time; the child begged so hard
for him that they were afraid he'd worry himself into another brain
fever if they didn't give way. So he came along with instructions to
make the lessons as much a farce as he liked, and the more the
better; not on any account to press the boy over his work. And from
what my father told me, young Teilo nearly drove the poor man off his
head. He was far sharper in a way than he'd ever been before, with a
memory like Macaulay's&mdash;once read, never forgotten&mdash;and an
amazing appetite for learning. But then the twist in the brain would
come out. Mathematics brilliant; and at the end of the lesson he'd
frighten that tutor of his with a new theory of figures, some notion
of the figures that we don't know of, the numbers that are between
the others, something rather more than one and less than two, and so
forth. It was the same with everything: there was the Secret Conquest
of England a hundred years ago, that nobody was allowed to mention,
and the squares that were always changing their shape in geometry,
and the great continent that was hidden because Africa was on top of
it, so that you couldn't see it. Then, when it came to the classics,
there were fresh cases for the nouns and new moods for the verbs: and
all the rest of it. Most extraordinary, and very sad for his father
and mother. The poor little fellow took a tremendous interest in the
family history and in the property; but I believe he hashed all that
up in some infernal way. Well; it seemed there was nothing to be
done.</p>

<p>"Then his father died. Of course, the question of the succession
came up at once. Poor Mrs. Morgan, as she called herself to the last,
swore she was married to Teilo, but she couldn't produce any
papers&mdash;any papers that were evidence of a legal marriage
anyhow. I fancy the truth was that they were married in some
forgotten little chapel up in the mountains by a hedge preacher or
somebody of that kind, who didn't know enough to get in the
registrar. Of course, Teilo ought to have known better, but probably
he didn't bother at the time so long as he satisfied the girl. He may
have meant to make it all right eventually, and left it too late: I
don't know. Anyhow, Payne Llewellyn, the family solicitor, gave the
poor woman to understand that she and the boy would have to leave
Llantrisant Abbey, and off they went. They had one room in a
miserable back street in Islington or Barnsbury or some such
God-forsaken place and she earned a bare living in a sweater's
workshop.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, the property had passed to a cousin; Harry Morgan. And
he hadn't been heard of, or barely heard of, for some years. He had
gone off exploring Central Asia or the sources of the Amazon when
Teilo Morgan was in his glory&mdash;if you can put it that way. He
hadn't heard a word of Teilo's reformation or of Mary Trevor and her
boy; and when old Llewellyn was able to get at him after considerable
difficulty and delay, he never mentioned the woman or her son. When
Morgan did come home at last, he found he didn't fancy the old family
place; called it a dismal hole, I believe. Anyhow, he let it on a
longish lease to a mental specialist&mdash;mad doctors, they called
them then&mdash;and he turned the Abbey into a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>"Then somebody told Harry about Mary Trevor, and the poor child,
and the marriage or no-marriage. He was furious with Llewellyn. He
had a search made, and when he found them, it was just too late so
far as Mary Trevor was concerned. She had died, of grief and hard
work and semi-starvation, no doubt. But Harry took the boy away, and
finding how he was longing to go back to the Abbey&mdash;he was quite
convinced, you see, that he was the owner of it and of all the Morgan
estates&mdash;Harry got the doctor who was running the place to take
Teilo as a patient. He was given a set of rooms to himself in a wing,
right away from the other patients. Everything was done to encourage
him in his notion that he was Teilo Morgan of Llantrisant Abbey.
Going back to the old place had stirred up all his enthusiasm for the
family, and the property, and the management of the estates, and it
became the great interest of his life. He quite thought he was making
it the best-managed estate in the county: inaugurating a new era in
English farming, and all the rest of it. Harry Morgan instructed
Captain Vaughan, the Estate Agent, to see Teilo once a week, and
enter into all his schemes and pretend to carry them out, and I
believe Vaughan played up extremely well, though he sometimes found
it difficult to keep a straight face; You see, that twist in the
brain wasn't getting any better, and when it went to work on
practical farming it produced some amazing results. Vaughan would be
told to get this bit of land ready for pineapples, and somewhere else
they were to grow olives; and what about zebras for haulage? But it
kept him happy to the last. D'you know, the very day he died, he
wrote a long letter of instructions to Vaughan. What d'you think it
was about? You won't guess. He told Vaughan to plant the Tree of Life
in a potato patch by the Soar, and gave full cultural
directions."</p>

<p>"God bless me! You don't say so?"</p>

<p>The Major, who had listened to the long story, ruminated awhile.
He had been brought up in an old-fashioned Evangelical household, and
had always loved "Revelation." The text burned and glowed into his
memory, and he said in a strong voice:</p>

<p>'In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of
fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree
were for the healing of the nations.'"</p>

<p>There was only one man beside our two friends left in the
darkening room; and he had fallen fast asleep in his arm-chair, with
his paper on the ground before him. The Major's clear intonation woke
him with a crash, and when he heard the words that were being
uttered, he was seized with unspeakable and panic terror, and ran out
of the room, howling (more or less) for the Committee.</p>

<p>But the Major having ended his text, said:</p>

<p>"I always thought Harry Morgan was a good fellow. But I didn't
know he was such a thundering good fellow as that."</p>

<p>And that was his Amen.</p>

<h2>Opening the Door</h2>

<h4>(1931)</h4>

<p>The newspaper reporter, from the nature of the case, has generally
to deal with the commonplaces of life. He does his best to find
something singular and arresting in the spectacle of the day's
doings; but, in spite of himself, he is generally forced to confess
that whatever there may be beneath the surface, the surface itself is
dull enough.</p>

<p>I must allow, however, that during my ten years or so in Fleet
Street, I came across some tracks that were not devoid of oddity.
There was that business of Campo Tosto, for example. That never got
into the papers. Campo Tosto, I must explain, was a Belgian, settled
for many years in England, who had left all his property to the man
who looked after him.</p>

<p>My news editor was struck by something odd in the brief story that
appeared in the morning paper, and sent me down to make inquiries. I
left the train at Reigate; and there I found that Mr. Campo Tosto had
lived at a place called Burnt Green&mdash;which is a translation of
his name into English&mdash;and that he shot at trespassers with a
bow and arrows. I was driven to his house, and saw through a glass
door some of the property which he had bequeathed to his servant:
fifteenth-century triptychs, dim and rich and golden; carved statues
of the saints; great spiked altar candlesticks; storied censers in
tarnished silver; and much more of old church treasure. The legatee,
whose name was Turk, would not let me enter; but, as a treat, he took
my newspaper from my pocket and read it upside down with great
accuracy and facility. I wrote this very queer story, but Fleet
Street would not suffer it. I believe it struck them as too strange a
thing for their sober columns.</p>

<p>And then there was the affair of the J.H.V.S. Syndicate, which
dealt with a Cabalistic cipher, and the phenomenon, called in the Old
Testament, "the Glory of the Lord," and the discovery of certain
objects buried under the site of the Temple at Jerusalem; that story
was left half told, and I never heard the ending of it. And I never
understood the affair of the hoard of coins that a storm disclosed on
the Suffolk coast near Aldeburgh. From the talk of the longshoremen,
who were on the look-out amongst the dunes, it appeared that a great
wave came in and washed away a slice of the sand cliff just beneath
them. They saw glittering objects as the sea washed back, and
retrieved what they could. I viewed the treasure&mdash;it was a
collection of coins; the earliest of the twelfth century, the latest,
pennies, three or four of them, of Edward VII, and a bronze medal of
Charles Spurgeon. There are, of course, explanations of the puzzle;
but there are difficulties in the way of accepting any one of them.
It is very clear, for example, that the hoard was not gathered by a
collector of coins; neither the twentieth-century pennies nor the
medal of the great Baptist preacher would appeal to a
numismatologist.</p>

<p>But perhaps the queerest story to which my newspaper connections
introduced me was the affair of the Reverend Secretan Jones, the
"Canonbury Clergyman," as the headlines called him.</p>

<p>To begin with, it was a matter of sudden disappearance. I believe
people of all sorts disappear by dozens in the course of every year,
and nobody hears of them or their vanishings. Perhaps they turn up
again, or perhaps they don't; anyhow, they never get so much as a
line in the papers, and there is an end of it. Take, for example,
that unknown man in the burning car, who cost the amorous commercial
traveller his life. In a certain sense, we all heard of him; but he
must have disappeared from somewhere in space, and nobody knew that
he had gone from his world. So it is often; but now and then there is
some circumstance that draws attention to the fact that A. or B. was
in his place on Monday and missing from it on Tuesday and Wednesday;
and then inquiries are made and usually the lost man is found, alive
or dead, and the explanation is often simple enough.</p>

<p>But as to the case of Secretan Jones. This gentleman, a cleric as
I have said, but seldom, it appeared, exercising his sacred office,
lived retired in a misty, 1830-40 square in the recesses of
Canonbury. He was understood to be engaged in some kind of scholarly
research, was a well-known figure in the Reading Room of the British
Museum, and looked anything between fifty and sixty. It seems
probable that if he had been content with that achievement he might
have disappeared as often as he pleased, and nobody would have
troubled; but one night as he sat late over his books in the
stillness of that retired quarter, a motor-lorry passed along a road
not far from Tollit Square, breaking the silence with a heavy rumble
and causing a tremor of the ground that penetrated into Secretan
Jones's study. A teacup and saucer on a side-table trembled slightly,
and Secretan Jones's attention was taken from his authorities and
note-books.</p>

<p>This was in February or March of 1907, and the motor industry was
still in its early stages. If you preferred a horse-bus, there were
plenty left in the streets. Motor coaches were non-existent, hansom
cabs still jogged and jingled on their cheerful way; and there were
very few heavy motor-vans in use. But to Secretan Jones, disturbed by
the rattle of his cup and saucer, a vision of the future, highly
coloured, was vouchsafed, and he began to write to the papers. He saw
the London streets almost as we know them to-day; streets where a
horse-vehicle would be almost a matter to show one's children for
them to remember in their old age; streets in which a great
procession of huge omnibuses carrying fifty, seventy, a hundred
people was continually passing; streets in which vans and trailers
loaded far beyond the capacity of any manageable team of horses would
make the ground tremble without ceasing.</p>

<p>The retired scholar, with the happy activity which does sometimes,
oddly enough, distinguish the fish out of water, went on and spared
nothing. Newton saw the apple fall, and built up a mathematical
universe; Jones heard the teacup rattle, and laid the universe of
London in ruins. He pointed out that neither the roadways nor the
houses beside them were constructed to withstand the weight and
vibration of the coming traffic. He crumbled all the shops in Oxford
Street and Piccadilly into dust; he cracked the dome of St. Paul's,
brought down Westminster Abbey, reduced the Law Courts to a fine
powder. What was left was dealt with by fire, flood and pestilence.
The prophetic Jones demonstrated that the roads must collapse,
involving the various services beneath them. Here, the water-mains
and the main drainage would flood the streets; there, huge volumes of
gas would escape, and electric wires fuse; the earth would be rent
with explosions, and the myriad streets of London would go up in a
great flame of fire. Nobody really believed that it would happen, but
it made good reading, and Secretan Jones gave interviews, started
discussions, and enjoyed himself thoroughly. Thus he became the
"Canonbury Clergyman." "Canonbury Clergyman says that Catastrophe is
Inevitable"; "Doom of London pronounced by Canonbury Clergyman";
"Canonbury Clergyman's Forecast: London a Carnival of Flood, Fire and
Earthquake"&mdash;that sort of thing.</p>

<p>And thus Secretan Jones, though his main interests were
liturgical, was able to secure a few newspaper paragraphs when he
disappeared&mdash;rather more than a year after his great campaign in
the Press, which was not quite forgotten, but not very clearly
remembered.</p>

<p>A few paragraphs, I said, and stowed away, most of them, in
out-of-the-way corners of the papers. It seemed that Mrs. Sedger, the
woman who shared with her husband the business of looking after
Secretan Jones, brought in tea on a tray to his study at four o'clock
as usual, and came, again as usual, to take it away at five. And, a
good deal to her astonishment, the study was empty. She concluded
that her master had gone out for a stroll, though he never went out
for strolls between tea and dinner. He didn't come back for dinner;
and Sedger, inspecting the hall, pointed out that the master's hats
and coats and sticks and umbrellas were all on their pegs and in
their places. The Sedgers conjectured this, that, and the other,
waited a week, and then went to the police, and the story came out
and perturbed a few learned friends and correspondents: Prebendary
Lincoln, author of <i>The Roman Canon in the Third Century</i>; Dr.
Brightwell, wise on the Rite of Malabar; and Stokes, the Mozarabic
man. The rest of the populace did not take very much interest in the
affair, and when, at the end of six weeks, there was a line or two
stating that "the Rev. Secretan Jones, whose disappearance at the
beginning of last month from his house in Tollit Square, Canonbury,
caused some anxiety to his friends, returned yesterday," there was
neither enthusiasm nor curiosity. The last line of the paragraph said
that the incident was supposed to be the result of a
misunderstanding; and nobody even asked what that statement
meant.</p>

<p>And there would have been the end of it&mdash;if Sedger had not
gossiped to the circle in the private bar of The King of Prussia.
Some mysterious and unofficial person, in touch with this circle,
insinuated himself into the presence of my news editor and told him
Sedger's tale. Mrs. Sedger, a careful woman, had kept all the rooms
tidy and well dusted. On the Tuesday afternoon she had opened the
study door and saw, to her amazement and delight, her master sitting
at his table with a great book open beside him and a pencil in his
hand. She exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, I <i>am</i> glad to see you back again!"</p>

<p>"Back again?" said the clergyman. "What do you mean? I think I
should like some more tea."</p>

<p>"I don't know in the least what it's all about," said the news
editor, "but you might go and see Secretan Jones and have a chat with
him. There may be a story in it." There was a story in it, but not
for my paper, or any other paper.</p>

<p>I got into the house in Tollit Square on some unhandsome pretext
connected with Secretan Jones's traffic scare of the year before. He
looked at me in a dim, abstracted way at first&mdash;the "great book"
of his servant's story, and other books, and many black quarto
notebooks were about him&mdash;but my introduction of the proposed
design for a "mammoth carrier" clarified him, and he began to talk
eagerly, and as it seemed to me lucidly, of the grave menace of the
new mechanical transport.</p>

<p>"But what's the use of talking?" he ended. "I tried to wake people
up to the certain dangers ahead. I seemed to succeed for a few weeks;
and then they forgot all about it. You would really say that the
great majority are like dreamers, like sleepwalkers. Yes; like men
walking in a dream; shutting out all the actualities, all the facts
of life. They know that they are, in fact, walking on the edge of a
precipice; and yet they are able to believe, it seems, that the
precipice is a garden path; and they behave as if it were a garden
path, as safe as that path you see down there, going to the door at
the bottom of my garden."</p>

<p>The study was at the back of the house, and looked on the long
garden, heavily overgrown with shrubs run wild, mingling with one
another, some of them flowering richly, and altogether and happily
obscuring and confounding the rigid grey walls that doubtless
separated each garden from its neighbours. Above the tall shrubs,
taller elms and planes and ash trees grew unlopped and handsomely
neglected; and under this deep concealment of green boughs the path
went down to a green door, just visible under a cloud of white
roses.</p>

<p>"As safe as that path you see there," Secretan Jones repeated,
and, looking at him, I thought his expression changed a little; very
slightly, indeed, but to a certain questioning, one might say to a
meditative doubt. He suggested to me a man engaged in an argument,
who puts his case strongly, decisively; and then hesitates for the
fraction of a second as a point occurs to him of which he had never
thought before; a point as yet unweighed, unestimated; dimly present,
but more as a shadow than a shape.</p>

<p>The newspaper reporter needs the gestures of the serpent as well
as its wisdom. I forget how I glided from the safe topic of the
traffic peril to the dubious territory which I had been sent to
explore. At all events, my contortions were the most graceful that I
could devise; but they were altogether vain. Secretan Jones's kind,
lean, clean-shaven face took on an expression of distress. He looked
at me as one in perplexity; he seemed to search his mind not for the
answer that he should give me, but rather for some answer due to
himself.</p>

<p>"I am extremely sorry that I cannot give you the information you
want," he said, after a considerable pause. "But I really can't go
any farther into the matter. In fact, it is quite out of the question
to do so. You must tell your editor&mdash;or sub-editor; which is
it?&mdash;that the whole business is due to a misunderstanding, a
misconception, which I am not at liberty to explain. But I am really
sorry that you have come all this way for nothing."</p>

<p>There was real apology and regret, not only in his words, but in
his tones and in his aspect. I could not clutch my hat and get on my
way with a short word in the character of a disappointed and somewhat
disgusted emissary; so we fell on general talk, and it came out that
we both came from the Welsh borderland, and had long ago walked over
the same hills and drunk of the same wells. Indeed, I believe we
proved cousinship, in the seventh degree or so, and tea came in and
before long Secretan Jones was deep in liturgical problems, of which
I knew just enough to play the listener's part. Indeed, when I had
told him that the <i>hwyl</i>, or chanted eloquence, of the Welsh
Methodists was, in fact, the Preface Tone of the Roman Missal, he
overflowed with grateful interest, and made a note in one of his
books, and said the point was most curious and important. It was a
pleasant evening, and we strolled through the french windows into the
green-shadowed, blossoming garden, and went on with our talk, till it
was time&mdash;and high time&mdash;for me to go. I had taken up my
hat as we left the study, and as we stood by the green door in the
wall at the end of the garden, I suggested that I might use it.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," said Secretan Jones, looking, I thought, a little
worried, "but I am afraid it's jammed, or something of that kind. It
has always been an awkward door, and I hardly ever use it."</p>

<p>So we went through the house, and on the doorstep he pressed me to
come again, and was so cordial that I agreed to his suggestion of the
Saturday sennight. And so at last I got an answer to the question
with which my newspaper had originally entrusted me; but an answer by
no means for newspaper use. The tale, or the experience, or the
impression, or whatever it may be called, was delivered to me by very
slow degrees, with hesitations, and in a manner of tentative
suggestion that often reminded me of our first talk together. It was
as if Jones were again and again questioning himself as to the matter
of his utterances, as if he doubted whether they should not rather be
treated as dreams, and dismissed as trifles without consequence.</p>

<p>He said once to me: "People do tell their dreams, I know; but
isn't it usually felt that they are telling nothing? That's what I am
afraid of."</p>

<p>I told him that I thought we might throw a great deal of light on
very dark places if more dreams were told.</p>

<p>"But there," I said, "is the difficulty. I doubt whether the
dreams that I am thinking of <i>can</i> be told. There are dreams
that are perfectly lucid from beginning to end, and also perfectly
insignificant. There are others which are blurred by a failure of
memory, perhaps only on one point: you dream of a dead man as if he
were alive. Then there are dreams which are prophetic: there seems,
on the whole, no doubt of that. Then you may have sheer clotted
nonsense; I once chased Julius C&aelig;sar all over London to get his
recipe for curried eggs. But, besides these, there is a certain dream
of another order: utter lucidity up to the moment of waking, and then
perceived to be beyond the power of words to express. It is neither
sense nor nonsense; it has, perhaps, a notation of its own, but ...
well, you can't play Euclid on the violin."</p>

<p>Secretan Jones shook his head. "I am afraid my experiences are
rather like that," he said. It was clear, indeed, that he found great
difficulty in finding a verbal formula which should convey some hint
of his adventures.</p>

<p>But that was later. To start with, things were fairly easy; but,
characteristically enough, he began his story before I realised that
the story was begun. I had been talking of the queer tricks a man's
memory sometimes plays him. I was saying that a few days before, I
was suddenly interrupted in some work I was doing. It was necessary
that I should clear my desk in a hurry. I shuffled a lot of loose
papers together and put them away, and awaited my caller with a fresh
writing-pad before me. The man came. I attended to the business with
which he was concerned, and went back to my former affair when he had
gone. But I could not find the sheaf of papers. I thought I had put
them in a drawer. They were not in the drawer; they were not in any
drawer, or in the blotting-book, or in any place where one might
reasonably expect to find them. They were found next morning by the
servant who dusted the room, stuffed hard down into the crevice
between the seat and the back of an arm-chair, and carefully hidden
under a cushion.</p>

<p>"And," I finished, "I hadn't the faintest recollection of doing
it. My mind was blank on the matter."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Secretan Jones, "I suppose we all suffer from that
sort of thing at times. About a year ago I had a very odd experience
of the same kind. It troubled me a good deal at the time. It was soon
after I had taken up that question of the new traffic and its
probable&mdash;its certain&mdash;results. As you may have gathered, I
have been absorbed for most of my life in my own special studies,
which are remote enough from the activities and interests of the day.
It hasn't been at all my way to write to the papers to say there are
too many dogs in London, or to denounce street musicians. But I must
say that the extraordinary dangers of using our present road system
for a traffic for which it was not designed did impress themselves
very deeply upon me; and I dare say I allowed myself to be
over-interested and over-excited.</p>

<p>"There is a great deal to be said for the Apostolic maxim: 'Study
to be quiet and to mind your own business.' I am afraid I got the
whole thing on the brain, and neglected my own business, which at
that particular time, if I remember, was the investigation of a very
curious question&mdash;the validity or non-validity of the
Consecration Formula of the <i>Grand Saint Graal: Car chou est li
sanc di ma nouviele loy, li miens meismes.</i> Instead of attending
to my proper work, I allowed myself to be drawn into the discussion I
had started, and for a week or two I thought of very little else:
even when I was looking up authorities at the British Museum, I
couldn't get the rumble of the motor-van out of my head. So, you see,
I allowed myself to get harried and worried and distracted, and I put
down what followed to all the bother and excitement I was going
through. The other day, when you had to leave your work in the middle
and start on something else, I dare say you felt annoyed and put out,
and shoved those papers of yours away without really thinking of what
you were doing, and I suppose something of the same kind happened to
me. Though it was still queerer, I think."</p>

<p>He paused, and seemed to meditate doubtfully, and then broke out
with an apologetic laugh, and: "It really sounds quite crazy!" And
then: "I forgot where I lived."</p>

<p>"Loss of memory, in fact, through overwork and nervous
excitement?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not quite in the usual way. I was quite clear about my
name and my identity. And I knew my address perfectly well:
Thirty-nine, Tollit Square, Canonbury."</p>

<p>"But you said you forgot where you lived."</p>

<p>"I know; but there's the difficulty of expression we were talking
about the other day. I am looking for the notation, as you called it.
But it was like this: I had been working till the morning in the
Reading Room with the motor danger at the back of my mind, and as I
left the Museum, feeling a sort of heaviness and confusion, I made up
my mind to walk home. I thought the air might freshen me a little. I
set out at a good pace. I knew every foot of the way, as I had often
done the walk before, and I went ahead mechanically, with my mind
wrapt up in a very important matter relating to my proper studies. As
a matter of fact, I had found in a most unexpected quarter a
statement that threw an entirely new light on the Rite of the Celtic
Church, and I felt that I might be on the verge of an important
discovery. I was lost in a maze of conjectures, and when I looked up
I found myself standing on the pavement by the Angel, Islington,
totally unaware of where I was to go next.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite so: I knew the Angel when I saw it, and I knew I lived
in Tollit Square; but the relation between the two had entirely
vanished from my consciousness. For me, there were no longer any
points of the compass; there was no such thing as direction, neither
north nor south, nor left nor right, an extraordinary sensation,
which I don't feel I have made plain to you at all. I was a good deal
disturbed, and felt that I must move somewhere, so I set
off&mdash;and found myself at King's Cross railway station. Then I
did the only thing there was to be done: took a hansom and got home,
feeling shaky enough."</p>

<p>I gathered that this was the first incident of significance in a
series of odd experiences that befell this learned and amiable
clergyman. His memory became thoroughly unreliable, or so he thought
at first.</p>

<p>He began to miss important papers from his table in the study. A
series of notes, on three sheets lettered A, B, and C, were placed by
him on the table under a paperweight one night, just before he went
up to bed. They were missing when he went into his study the next
morning. He was certain that he had put them in that particular
place, under the bulbous glass weight with the pink roses embedded in
its depths: but they were not there. Then Mrs. Sedger knocked at the
door and entered with the papers in her hand. She said she had found
them between the bed and the mattress in the master's bedroom, and
thought they might be wanted.</p>

<p>Secretan Jones could not make it out at all. He supposed he must
have put the papers where they were found and then forgotten all
about it, and he was uneasy, feeling afraid that he was on the brink
of a nervous breakdown. Then there were difficulties about his books,
as to which he was very precise, every book having its own place. One
morning he wanted to consult the <i>Missale de Arbuthnott</i>, a big
red quarto, which lived at the end of a bottom shelf near the window.
It was not there. The unfortunate man went up to his bedroom, and
felt the bed all over and looked under his shirts in the chest of
drawers, and searched all the room in vain. However, determined to
get what he wanted, he went to the Reading Room, verified his
reference, and returned to Canonbury: and there was the red quarto in
its place. Now here, it seemed certain, there was no room for loss of
memory; and Secretan Jones began to suspect his servants of playing
tricks with his possessions, and tried to find a reason for their
imbecility or villainy&mdash;he did not know what to call it. But it
would not do at all. Papers and books disappeared and reappeared, or
now and then vanished without return. One afternoon, struggling, as
he told me, against a growing sense of confusion and bewilderment, he
had with considerable difficulty filled two quarto sheets of ruled
paper with a number of extracts necessary to the subject he had in
hand. When this was done, he felt his bewilderment thickening like a
cloud about him: "It was, physically and mentally, as if the objects
in the room became indistinct, were presented in a shimmering mist or
darkness." He felt afraid, and rose, and went out into the garden.
The two sheets of paper he had left on his table were lying on the
path by the garden door.</p>

<p>I remember he stopped dead at this point. To tell the truth, I was
thinking that all these instances were rather matter for the ear of a
mental specialist than for my hearing. There was evidence enough of a
bad nervous breakdown, and it seemed to me, of delusions. I wondered
whether it was my duty to advise the man to go to the best doctor he
knew, and without delay. Then Secretan Jones began again:</p>

<p>"I won't tell you any more of these absurdities. I know they are
drivel, pantomime tricks and traps, children's conjuring;
contemptible, all of it.</p>

<p>"But it made me afraid. I felt like a man walking in the dark,
beset with uncertain sounds and faint echoes of his footsteps that
seem to come from a vast depth, till he begins to fear that he is
treading by the edge of some awful precipice. There was something
unknown about me; and I was holding on hard to what I knew, and
wondering whether I should be sustained.</p>

<p>"One afternoon I was in a very miserable and distracted state. I
could not attend to my work. I went out into the garden, and walked
up and down trying to calm myself. I opened the garden door and
looked into the narrow passage which runs at the end of all the
gardens on this side of the square. There was nobody
there&mdash;except three children playing some game or other. They
were queer, stunted little creatures, and I turned back into the
garden and walked into the study. I had just sat down, and had turned
to my work hoping to find relief in it, when Mrs. Sedger, my servant,
came into the room and cried out, in an excited sort of way, that she
was glad to see me back again.</p>

<p>"I made up some story. I don't know whether she believes it. I
suppose she thinks I have been mixed up in something
disreputable."</p>

<p>"And what had happened?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the remotest notion."</p>

<p>We sat looking at each other for some time.</p>

<p>"I suppose what happened was just this," I said at last. "Your
nervous system had been in a very bad way for some time. It broke
down utterly; you lost your memory, your sense of
identity&mdash;everything. You may have spent the six weeks in
addressing envelopes in the City Road."</p>

<p>He turned to one of the books on the table and opened it. Between
the leaves there were the dimmed red and white petals of some flower
that looked like an anemone.</p>

<p>"I picked this flower," he said, "as I was walking down the path
that afternoon. It was the first of its kind to be in
bloom&mdash;very early. It was still in my hand when I walked back
into this room, six weeks later, as everybody declares. But it was
quite fresh."</p>

<p>There was nothing to be said. I kept silent for five minutes, I
suppose, before I asked him whether his mind was an utter blank as to
the six weeks during which no known person had set eyes on him;
whether he had no sort of recollection, however vague.</p>

<p>"At first, nothing at all. I could not believe that more than a
few seconds came between my opening the garden door and shutting it.
Then in a day or two there was a vague impression that I had been
somewhere where everything was absolutely right. I can't say more
than that. No fairyland joys, or bowers of bliss, or anything of that
kind; no sense of anything strange or unaccustomed. But there was no
care there at all. <i>Est enim magnum chaos</i>."</p>

<p>But that means "For there is a great void," or "A great gulf."</p>

<p>We never spoke of the matter again. Two months later he told me
that his nerves had been troubling him, and that he was going to
spend a month or six weeks at a farm near Llanthony, in the Black
Mountains, a few miles from his old home. In three weeks I got a
letter, addressed in Secretan Jones's hand. Inside was a slip of
paper on which he had written the words:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Est enim magnum chaos</i>.</p>

<p>The day on which the letter was posted he had gone out in wild
autumn weather, late one afternoon, and had never come back. No trace
of him has ever been found.</p>

<h2>The Marriage of Panurge</h2>

<p>It was a dim, hot night; all the great city smoked as with a mist,
and a tawny moon rose through films of cloud far in the vista of the
east. Ambrose thought with a sudden recollection that the moon, that
world of splendour, was shining in a farther land, on the coast of
the wild rocks, on the heaving sea, on the faery apple-garths in
Avalon, where, though the apples are always golden, yet the blossoms
of enchantment never fade, but hang for ever against the sky.</p>

<p>They were passing a half-lit street, and these dreams were broken
by the sudden clanging, rattling music of a piano-organ. For a moment
they saw the shadowy figures of the children as they flitted to and
fro, dancing odd measures in the rhythm of the tune. Then they came
into a long, narrow way with a church spire in the distance, and near
the church they passed the "church-shop"&mdash;Roman, evidently, from
the subjects and the treatment of the works of art on view. But it
was strange! In the middle of the window was a crude, glaring statue
of some saint. He was in bright red robes, sprinkled with golden
stars; the blood rained down from a wound in his forehead, and with
one hand he drew the scarlet vestment aside and pointed to the
dreadful gash above his heart, and from this, again, the bloody drops
fell thick. The colours stared and shrieked, and yet, through the
bad, cheap art there seemed to shine a rapture that was very near to
beauty; the thing expressed was so great that it had to a certain
extent overcome the villainy of the expression.</p>

<p>They wandered vaguely, after their custom. Ambrose was silent; he
was thinking of Avalon and "Red Martyrdom" and the Frenchman's
parting salutation, of the vision in one of the old books, "the Man
clothed in a robe redder and more shining than burning fire, and his
feet and his hands and his face were of a like flame, and five angels
in fiery vesture stood about him, and at the feet of the Man the
ground was covered with a ruddy dew."</p>

<p>They passed under an old church tower that rose white in the
moonlight above them. The air had cleared, the mist had floated away,
and now the sky glowed violet, and the white stones of the classic
spire shone on high. From it there came suddenly a tumult of glad
sound, exultant bells in ever-changing order, pealing out as if to
honour some great victory, so that the mirth of the street below
became but a trivial restless noise. He thought of some passage that
he had read but could not distinctly remember: a ship was coming back
to its haven after a weary and tempestuous voyage over many dreadful
seas, and those on board saw the tumult in the city as their sails
were sighted; heard afar the shouts of gladness from the rejoicing
people; heard the bells from all the spires and towers break suddenly
into triumphant chorus, sounding high above the washing of the
waves.</p>

<p>Ambrose roused himself from his dreams. They had been walking in a
circle and had returned almost to the street of the Ch&acirc;teau,
though, their knowledge of the district being of an unscientific
character, they were under the impression that they were a mile or so
away from that particular point. As it happened, they had not entered
this street before, and they were charmed at the sudden appearance of
stained glass lighted up from within. The colour was rich and good;
there were flourished scrolls and grotesques in the Renaissance
manner, many emblazoned shields in ruby and gold and azure; and the
centre-piece showed the Court of the Beer King&mdash;a jovial and
venerable figure attended by a host of dwarfs and kobolds, all
holding on high enormous mugs of beer. They went in boldly and were
glad. It was the famous "Three Kings" in its golden and unreformed
days, but this they knew not. The room was of moderate size, very
low, with great dark beams in the white ceiling. White were the
walls; on the plaster, black-letter texts with vermilion initials
praised the drinker's art, and more kobolds, in black and red, loomed
oddly in unsuspected corners. The lighting, presumably, was gas, but
all that was visible were great antique lanterns depending from iron
hooks, and through their dull green glass only a dim radiance fell
upon the heavy oak tables and the drinkers. From the middle beam an
enormous bouquet of fresh hops hung on high; there was a subdued
murmur of talk, and now and then the clatter of the lid of a mug, as
fresh beer was ordered. In one corner there was a kind of bar; behind
it a couple of grim women&mdash;the kobolds
apparently&mdash;performed their office; and above, on a sort of
rack, hung mugs and tankards of all sizes and of all fantasies. There
were plain mugs of creamy earthenware, mugs gaudily and oddly painted
with garlanded goats, with hunting scenes, with towering castles,
with flaming posies of flowers. Then some friend of the drunken, some
sage who had pried curiously into the secrets of thirst, had made a
series of wonders in glass, so shining and crystalline that to behold
them was as if one looked into a well, for every glitter of the
facets gave promise of satisfaction. There were the mugs, capacious
and very deep, crowned for the most part not with mere plain lids of
common use and make, but with tall spires in pewter, richly
ornamented, evident survivals from the Middle Ages. Ambrose's eyes
glistened; the place was altogether as he would have designed it.
Nelly, too, was glad to sit down, for they had walked longer than
usual. She was refreshed by a glass of some cool drink with a borage
flower and a cherry floating in it, and Ambrose ordered a mug of
beer.</p>

<p>It is not known how many of these <i>krugs</i> he emptied. It was,
as has been noted, a sultry night, and the streets were dusty, and
that glass of Benedictine after dinner rather evokes than dismisses
the demon of thirst. Still, Munich beer is no hot and rebellious
drink, so the causes of what followed must probably be sought for in
other springs. Ambrose took a deep draught, gazed upward to the
ceiling, and ordered another mug of beer for himself and some more of
the cool and delicate and flowery beverage for Nelly. When the drink
was set upon the board, he thus began, without title or preface:</p>

<p>"You must know, Nelly dear," he said, "that the marriage of
Panurge, which fell out in due time (according to the oracle and
advice of the Holy Bottle), was by no means a fortunate one. For,
against all the counsel of Pantagruel and of Friar John, and indeed
of all his friends, Panurge married in a fit of spleen and obstinacy
the crooked and squinting daughter of the little old man who sold
green sauce in the Rue Quincangrogne at Tours&mdash;you will see the
very place in a few days, and then you will understand everything.
You do not understand that? My child, that is impiety, since it
accuses the Zeitgeist, who is certainly the only god that ever
existed, as you will see more fully demonstrated in Huxley and
Spencer and all the leading articles in all the leading newspapers.
<i>Quod erat demonstrandum</i>. To be still more precise: You must
know that when I am dead, and a very great man indeed, many thousands
of people will come from all the quarters of the globe&mdash;not
forgetting the United States&mdash;to Lupton. They will come and
stare very hard at the Old Grange, which will have an inscription
about me on the wall; they will spend hours in High School; they will
walk all round Playing Fields; they will cut little bits off 'brooks'
and 'quarries.' Then they will view the Sulphuric Acid works, the
Chemical Manure factory and the Free Library, and whatever other
stink-pots and cesspools Lupton town may contain; they will finally
enjoy the view of the Midland Railway Goods Station. Then they will
say: '<i>Now</i> we understand him; <i>now</i> that beautiful passage
is quite clear; <i>now</i> one sees how he got all his inspiration in
that lovely old school and the wonderful English country-side.' So
you see that when I show you the Rue Quincangrogne you will perfectly
understand this history. Let us drink; the world shall never be
drowned again, so have no fear.</p>

<p>"Well, the fact remains that Panurge, having married this hideous
wench aforesaid, was excessively unhappy. It was in vain that he
argued with his wife in all known languages and in some that are
unknown, for, as she said, she only knew two languages, the one of
Touraine and the other of the Stick, and this second she taught
Panurge <i>per modum passionis</i>&mdash;that is by beating him, and
this so thoroughly that poor Pilgarlic was sore from head to foot. He
was a worthy little fellow, but the greatest coward that ever
breathed. Believe me, illustrious drinkers and most precious....
Nelly, never was man so wretched as this Panurge since Paradise fell
from Adam. This is the true doctrine; I heard it when I was at
Eleusis. You enquire what was the matter? Why, in the first place,
this vile wretch whom they all called&mdash;so much did they hate
her&mdash;La Vie Mortale, or Deadly Life, this vile wretch, I say:
what do you think that she did when the last note of the fiddles had
sounded and the wedding guests had gone off to the 'Three Lampreys'
to kill a certain worm&mdash;the which worm is most certainly
immortal, since it is not dead yet! Well, then, what did Madame
Panurge? Nothing but this: She robbed her excellent and devoted
husband of all that he had. Doubtless you remember how, in the old
days, Panurge had played ducks and drakes with the money that
Pantagrael had given him, so that he borrowed on his corn when it was
still in the ear, and before it was sown, if we enquire a little more
closely. In truth, the good little man never had a penny to bless
himself withal, for the which cause Pantagruel loved him all the more
dearly. So that when the Dive Bouteille gave its oracle, and Panurge
chose his spouse, Pantagruel showed how preciously he esteemed a
hearty spender by giving him such a treasure that the goldsmiths who
live under the bell of St. Gatien still talk of it before they dine,
because by doing so their mouths water, and these salivary secretions
are of high benefit to the digestion: read on this, Galen. If you
would know how great and glorious this treasure was, you must go to
the Library of the Archev&ecirc;ch&eacute; at Tours, where they will
show you a vast volume bound in pigskin, the name of which I have
forgotten. But this book is nothing else than the list of all the
wonders and glories of Pantagruel's wedding present to Panurge; it
contains surprising things, I can tell you, for, in good coin of the
realm alone, never was gift that might compare with it; and besides
the common money there were ancient pieces, the very names of which
are now incomprehensible, and incomprehensible they will remain till
the coming of the Coqcigrues. There was, for instance, a great gold
Sol, a world in itself, as some said truly, and I know not how many
myriad myriad of Etoiles, all of the finest silver that was ever
minted, and Anges-Gardiens, which the learned think must have been
first coined at Angers, though others will have it that they were the
same as our Angels; and, as for Roses de Paradis and Couronnes
Immortelles, I believe he had as many of them as ever he would.
Beauties and joys he was to keep for pocket-money; small change is
sometimes great gain. And, as I say, no sooner had Panurge married
that accursed daughter of the Rue Quincangrogne than she robbed him
of everything, down to the last brass farthing. The fact is that the
woman was a witch; she was also something else which I leave out for
the present. But, if you will believe me, she cast such a spell upon
Panurge that he thought himself an absolute beggar. Thus he would
look at his Sol d'Or and say: 'What is the use of that? It is only a
great bright lump: I can see it every day.' Then when they said, 'But
how about those Anges-Gardiens?' he would reply, 'Where are they?
Have you seen them? <i>I</i> never see them. Show them to me,' and so
with all else; and all the while that villain of a woman beat,
thumped and belaboured him so that the tears were always in his eyes,
and they say you could hear him howling all over the world. Everybody
said that he had made a pretty mess of it, and would come to a bad
end.</p>

<p>"Luckily for him, this ... witch of a wife of his would sometimes
doze off for a few minutes, and then he had a little peace, and he
would wonder what had become of all the gay girls and gracious ladies
that he had known in old times&mdash;for he had played the devil with
the women in his day and could have taught Ovid lessons in <i>arte
amoris</i>. Now, of course, it was as much as his life was worth to
mention the very name of one of these ladies, and as for any little
sly visits, stolen endearments, hidden embraces, or any small matters
of that kind, it was <i>good-bye, I shall see you next Nevermas</i>.
Nor was this all, but worse remains behind; and it is my belief that
it is the thought of what I am going to tell you that makes the wind
wail and cry of winter nights, and the clouds weep, and the sky look
black; for in truth it is the greatest sorrow that ever was since the
beginning of the world. I must out with it quick, or I shall never
have done: in plain English, and as true as I sit here drinking good
ale, not one drop or minim or drachm or penny-weight of drink had
Panurge tasted since the day of his wedding! He had implored mercy,
he had told her how he had served Gargantua and Pantagruel and had
got into the habit of drinking in his sleep, and his wife merely
advised him to go to the devil&mdash;she was not going to let him so
much as look at the nasty stuff. '"Touch not, taste not, smell not,"
is my motto,' said she. She gave him a blue ribbon, which she said
would make up for it. 'What do you want with Drink?' said she. 'Go
and do business instead, it's much better for you.'</p>

<p>"Sad, then, and sorry enough was the estate of poor Panurge. At
last, so wretched did he become, that he took advantage of one of his
wife's dozes and stole away to the good Pantagrael, and told him the
whole story&mdash;and a very bad one it was&mdash;so that the tears
rolled down Pantagruel's cheeks from sheer grief, and each teardrop
contained exactly one hundred and eighteen gallons of aqueous fluid,
according to the calculations of the best geometers. The great man
saw that the case was a desperate one, and Heaven knew, he said,
whether it could be mended or not; but certain it was that a business
such as this could not be settled in a hurry, since it was not like a
game at shove-ha'penny to be got over between two gallons of wine. He
therefore counselled Panurge to have patience and bear with his wife
for a few thousand years, and in the meantime they would see what
could be done. But, lest his patience should wear out, he gave him an
odd drug or medicine, prepared by the great artist of the mountains
of Cathay, and this he was to drop into his wife's glass&mdash;for,
though he might have no drink, she was drunk three times a day, and
she would sleep all the longer, and leave him awhile in peace. This
Panurge very faithfully performed, and got a little rest now and
again, and they say that while that devil of a woman snored and
snorted he was able, by odd chances once or twice, to get hold of a
drop of the right stuff&mdash;good old Stingo from the big
barrel&mdash;which he lapped up as eagerly as a kitten laps cream.
Others there be who declare that once or twice he got about his sad
old tricks, while his ugly wife was sleeping in the sun; the women on
the Maille make no secret of their opinion that his old mistress,
Madame Sophia, was seen stealing in and out of the house as slyly as
you please, and God knows what goes on when the door is shut. But the
Tourainians were always sad gossips, and one must not believe all
that one hears. I leave out the flat scandal-mongers who are bold
enough to declare that he kept one mistress at Jerusalem, another at
Eleusis, another in Egypt and about as many as are contained in the
seraglio of the Grand Trunk, scattered up and down in the towns and
villages of Asia; but I do believe there was some kissing in dark
corners, and a curtain hung across one room in the house could tell
odd tales. Nevertheless, La Vie Mortale (a pest on her!) was more
often awake than asleep, and when she was awake Panurge's case was
worse than ever. For, you see, the woman was no piece of a fool, and
she saw sure enough that something was going on. The Stingo in the
barrel was lower than of rights, and more than once she had caught
her husband looking almost happy, at which she beat the house about
his ears. Then, another time, Madame Sophia dropped her ring, and
again this sweet lady came one morning so strongly perfumed that she
scented the whole place, and when La Vie woke up it smelt like a
church. There was fine work then, I promise you; the people heard the
bangs and curses and shrieks and groans as far as Amboise on the one
side and Luynes on the other; and that year the Loire rose ten feet
higher than the banks on account of Panurge's tears. As a punishment,
she made him go and be industrial, and he built ten thousand
stink-pot factories with twenty thousand chimneys, and all the leaves
and trees and green grass and flowers in the world were blackened,
and died, and all the waters were poisoned so that there were no
perch in the Loire, and salmon fetched forty sols the pound at Chinon
market. As for the men and women, they became yellow apes and
listened to a codger named Calvin, who told them they would all be
damned eternally (except himself and his friends), and they found his
doctrine very comforting, and probable too, since they had the sense
to know that they were more than half damned already. I don't know
whether Panurge's fate was worse on this occasion or on another when
his wife found a book in his writing, full from end to end of poetry;
some of it about the wonderful treasure that Pantagruel had given
him, which he was supposed to have forgotten; some of it verses to
those old light-o'-loves of his, with a whole epic in praise of his
mistress-in-chief, Sophia. Then, indeed, there was the very deuce to
pay; it was bread and water, stripes and torment, all day long, and
La Vie swore a great oath that if he ever did it again he should be
sent to spend the rest of his life in Manchester, whereupon he fell
into a swoon from horrid fright and lay like a log, so that everybody
thought he was dead.</p>

<p>"All this while the great Pantagruel was not idle. Perceiving how
desperate the matter was, he summoned the Thousand and First Great
&OElig;cumenical Council of all the sages of the wide world, and when
the fathers had come, and had heard High Mass at St. Gatien's, the
session was opened in a pavilion in the meadows by the Loire just
under the Lanterne of Roche Corbon, whence this Council is always
styled the great and holy Council of the Lantern. If you want to know
where the place is you can do so very easily, for there is a choice
tavern on the spot where the pavilion stood, and there you may have
<i>malelotte</i> and <i>friture</i> and amber wine of Vouvray, better
than in any tavern in Touraine. As for the history of the acts of
this great Council, it is still a-writing, and so far only two
thousand volumes in elephant folio have been printed <i>sub signo
Lucern&aelig; cum permissu superiorum</i>. However, as it is
necessary to be brief, it may be said that the holy fathers of the
Lantern, after having heard the whole case as it was exposed to them
by the great clerks of Pantagruel, having digested all the arguments,
looked into the precedents, applied themselves to the doctrine,
explored the hidden wisdom, consulted the Canons, searched the
Scriptures, divided the dogma, distinguished the distinctions and
answered the questions, resolved with one voice that there was no
help in the world for Panurge, save only this: he must forthwith
achieve the most high, noble and glorious quest of the Sangraal, for
no other way was there under heaven by which he might rid himself of
that pestilent wife of his, La Vie Mortale.</p>

<p>"And on some other occasion," said Ambrose, "you may hear of the
last voyage of Panurge to the Glassy Isle of the Holy Graal, of the
incredible adventures that he achieved, of the dread perils through
which he passed, of the great wonders and marvels and compassions of
the way, of the manner in which he received the title Plentyn y
Tonau, which signifies 'Child of the Water-floods,' and how at last
he gloriously attained the vision of the Sangraal, and was most
happily translated out of the power of La Vie Mortale."</p>

<p>"And where is he now?" said Nelly, who had found the tale
interesting but obscure.</p>

<p>"It is not precisely known&mdash;opinions vary. But there are two
odd things: one is that he is exactly like that man in the red dress
whose statue we saw in the shop window to-night; and the other is
that from that day to this he has never been sober for a single
minute.</p>

<h2>The Holy Things</h2>

<p>The sky was blue above Holborn, and only one little cloud, half
white, half golden, floated on the wind's way from west to east. The
long aisle of the street was splendid in the full light of the
summer, and away in the west, where the houses seemed to meet and
join, it was as a rich tabernacle, mysterious, the carven house of
holy things.</p>

<p>A man came into the great highway from a quiet court. He had been
sitting under plane-tree shade for an hour or more, his mind racked
with perplexities and doubts, with the sense that all was without
meaning or purpose, a tangle of senseless joys and empty sorrows. He
had stirred in it and fought and striven, and now disappointment and
success were alike tasteless. To struggle was weariness, to attain
was weariness, to do nothing was weariness. He had felt, a little
while before, that from the highest to the lowest things of life
there was no choice, there was not one thing that was better than
another: the savour of the cinders was no sweeter than the savour of
the ashes. He had done work which some men liked and others disliked,
and liking and disliking were equally tiresome to him. His poetry or
his pictures or whatever it was that he worked at had utterly ceased
to interest him, and he had tried to be idle, and found idleness as
impossible as work. He had lost the faculty for making and he had
lost the power of resting; he dozed in the day-time and started up
and cried at night. Even that morning he had doubted and hesitated,
wondering whether to stay indoors or to go out, sure that in either
plan there was an infinite weariness and disgust.</p>

<p>When he at last went abroad he let the crowd push him into the
quiet court, and at the same time cursed them in a low voice for
doing so; he tried to persuade himself that he had meant to go
somewhere else. When he sat down he desperately endeavoured to rouse
himself, and as he knew that all the strong interests are egotistic,
he made an effort to grow warm over the work he had done, to find a
glow of satisfaction in the thought that he had accomplished
something. It was nonsense; he had found out a clever trick and had
made the most of it, and it was over. Besides, how would it interest
him if afterwards he was praised when he was dead? And what was the
use of trying to invent some new tricks? It was folly; and he ground
his teeth as a new idea came into his mind and was rejected. To get
drunk always made him so horribly ill, and other things were more
foolish and tiresome than poesy or painting, whichever it was.</p>

<p>He could not even rest on the uncomfortable bench, beneath the
dank, stinking plane tree. A young man and a girl came up and sat
next to him, and the girl said, "Oh, isn't it beautiful to-day?" and
then they began to jabber to one another&mdash;the blasted fools! He
flung himself from the seat and went out into Holborn.</p>

<p>As far as one could see, there were two processions of omnibuses,
cabs, and vans that went east and west and west and east. Now the
long line would move on briskly, now it stopped. The horses' feet
rattled and pattered on the asphalt, the wheels ground and jarred, a
bicyclist wavered in and out between the serried ranks, jangling his
bell. The foot-passengers went to and fro on the pavement, with an
endless change of unknown faces; there was an incessant hum and
murmur of voices. In the safety of a blind passage an Italian whirled
round the handle of his piano-organ; the sound of it swelled and sank
as the traffic surged and paused, and now and then one heard the
shrill voices of the children who danced and shrieked in time to the
music. Close to the pavement a coster pushed his barrow, and
proclaimed flowers in an odd intonation, reminding one of the
Gregorian chant. The cyclist went by again with his jangling,
insistent bell, and a man who stood by the lamp-post set fire to his
pastille ribbon, and let the faint blue smoke rise into the sun. Away
in the west, where the houses seemed to meet, the play of sunlight on
the haze made, as it were, golden mighty shapes that paused and
advanced, and paused again.</p>

<p>He had viewed the scene hundreds of times, and for a long while
had found it a nuisance and a weariness. But now, as be walked
stupidly, slowly, along the southern side of Holborn, a change fell.
He did not in the least know what it was, but there seemed to be a
strange air, and a new charm that soothed his mind.</p>

<p>When the traffic was stopped, to his soul there was a solemn hush
that summoned remnants of a far-off memory. The voices of the
passengers sank away, the street was endued with a grave and reverent
expectation. A shop that he passed had a row of electric lamps
burning above the door, and the golden glow of them in the sunlight
was, he felt, significant. The grind and jar of the wheels, as the
procession moved on again, gave out a chord of music, the opening of
some high service that was to be done, and now, in an ecstasy, he was
sure that he heard the roll and swell and triumph of the organ, and
shrill sweet choristers began to sing. So the music sank and swelled
and echoed in the vast aisle&mdash;in Holborn.</p>

<p>What could these lamps mean, burning in the bright sunlight? The
music was hushed in a grave close, and in the rattle of traffic he
heard the last deep, sonorous notes shake against the choir
walls&mdash;he had passed beyond the range of the Italian's
instrument. But then a rich voice began alone, rising and falling in
monotonous but awful modulations, singing a longing, triumphant song,
bidding the faithful lift up their hearts, be joined in heart with
the Angels and Archangels, with the Thrones and Dominations. He could
see no longer, he could not see the man who passed close beside him,
pushing his barrow, and calling flowers.</p>

<p>Ah! He could not be mistaken, he was sure now. Tho air was blue
with incense, he smelt the adorable fragrance. The time had almost
come. And then the silvery, reiterated, instant summons of a bell;
and again, and again.</p>

<p>The tears fell from his eyes, in his weeping the tears poured a
rain upon his cheeks. But he saw in the distance, in the far
distance, the carven tabernacle, golden mighty figure a-moving
slowly, imploring arms stretched forth.</p>

<p>There was a noise of a great shout; the choir sang in the tongue
of his boyhood that he had forgotten:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">SANT ... SANT ... SANT</p>

<p>Then the silvery bell tinkled anew; and again, and again. He
looked and saw the Holy, White, and Shining Mysteries
exhibited&mdash;in Holborn.</p>

<h2>Psychology</h2>

<p>Mr. Dale, who had quiet rooms in a western part of London, was
very busily occupied one day with a pencil and little scraps of
paper. He would stop in the middle of his writing, of his monotonous
tramp from door to window, jot down a line of hieroglyphics, and turn
again to his work. At lunch he kept his instruments on the table
beside him, and a little notebook accompanied him on his evening walk
about the Green. Sometimes he seemed to experience a certain
difficulty in the act of writing, as if the heat of shame or even
incredulous surprise held his hand, but one by one the fragments of
paper fell into the drawer, and a full feast awaited him at the day's
close.</p>

<p>As he lit his pipe at dusk, he was standing by the window and
looking out into the street. In the distance cab-lights flashed to
and fro, up and down the hill, on the main road. Across the way he
saw the long line of sober grey houses, cheerfully lit up for the
most part, displaying against the night the dining-room and the
evening meal. In one house, just opposite, there was brighter
illumination, and the open windows showed a modest dinner-party in
progress, and here and there a drawing-room on the first floor glowed
ruddy, as the tall shaded lamp was lit. Everywhere Dale saw a quiet
and comfortable respectability; if there were no gaiety there was no
riot, and he thought himself fortunate to have got "rooms" in so sane
and meritorious a street.</p>

<p>The pavement was almost deserted. Now and again a servant would
dart out from a side door and scurry off in the direction of the
shops, returning in a few minutes in equal haste. But foot-passengers
were rare, and only at long intervals a stranger would drift from the
highway and wander with slow speculation down Abingdon Road, as if he
had passed its entrance a thousand times and had at last been piqued
with curiosity and the desire of exploring the unknown. All the
inhabitants of the quarter prided themselves on their quiet and
seclusion, and many of them did not so much as dream that if one
went far enough the road degenerated and became abominable, the home
of the hideous, the mouth of a black purlieu. Indeed, stories, ill
and malodorous, were told of the streets parallel to east and west,
which perhaps communicated with the terrible sink beyond, but those
who lived at the good end of Abingdon Road knew nothing of their
neighbours.</p>

<p>Dale leant far out of his window. The pale London sky deepened to
violet as the lamps were lit, and in the twilight the little gardens
before the houses shone, seemed as if they grew more clear. The
golden laburnum but reflected the last bright yellow veil that had
fallen over the sky after sunset, the white hawthorn was a gleaming
splendour, the red may a flameless fire in the dusk. From the open
window, Dale could note the increasing cheerfulness of the diners
opposite, as the moderate cups were filled and emptied; blinds in the
higher stories brightened up and down the street when the nurses came
up with the children. A gentle breeze, that smelt of grass and woods
and flowers, fanned away the day's heat from the pavement stones,
rustled through the blossoming boughs, and sank again, leaving the
road to calm.</p>

<p>All the scene breathed the gentle domestic peace of the stories;
there were regular lives, dull duties done, sober and common thoughts
on every side. He felt that he needed not to listen at the windows,
for he could divine all the talk, and guess the placid and usual
channels in which the conversation flowed. Here there were no spasms,
nor raptures, nor the red storms of romance, but a safe rest;
marriage and birth and begetting were no more here than breakfast and
lunch and afternoon tea.</p>

<p>And then he turned away from the placid transparency of the
street, and sat down before his lamp and the papers he had so
studiously noted. A friend of his, an "impossible" man named Jenyns,
had been to see him the night before, and they had talked about the
psychology of the novelists, discussing their insight, and the depth
of their probe.</p>

<p>"It is all very well as far as it goes," said Jenyns. "Yes, it is
perfectly accurate. Guardsmen do like chorus-girls, the doctor's
daughter is fond of the curate, the grocer's assistant of the Baptist
persuasion has sometimes religious difficulties, 'smart' people no
doubt think a great deal about social events and complications: the
Tragic Comedians felt and wrote all that stuff, I dare say. But do
you think that is all? Do you call a description of the gilt tools on
the morocco here an exhaustive essay on Shakespeare?"</p>

<p>"But what more is there?" said Dale. "Don't you think, then, that
human nature has been fairly laid open? What more?"</p>

<p>"Songs of the frantic lupanar; delirium of the madhouse. Not
extreme wickedness, but the insensate, the unintelligible, the
lunatic passion and idea, the desire that must come from some other
sphere that we cannot even faintly imagine. Look for yourself; it is
easy."</p>

<p>Dale looked now at the ends and scraps of paper. On them he had
carefully registered all the secret thoughts of the day, the crazy
lusts, the senseless furies, the foul monsters that his heart had
borne, the maniac phantasies that he had harboured. In every note he
found a rampant madness, the equivalents in thought of mathematical
absurdity, of two-sided triangles, of parallel straight lines which
met.</p>

<p>"And we talk of absurd dreams," he said to himself. "And these are
wilder than the wildest visions. And our sins; but these are the sins
of nightmare.</p>

<p>"And every day," he went on, "we lead two lives, and the half of
our soul is madness, and half heaven is lit by a black sun. I say I
am a man, but who is the other that hides in me?"</p>

<br>

<h2>The Turanians</h2>

<p>The smoke of the tinkers' camp rose a thin pale-blue from the
heart of the wood.</p>

<p>Mary had left her mother at work on "things," and had gone out
with a pale and languid face into the hot afternoon. She had talked
of walking across the fields to the Green, and of having a chat with
the doctor's daughter, but she had taken the other path that crept
down towards the hollow and the dark thickets of the wood.</p>

<p>After all, she had felt too lazy to rouse herself, to make the
effort of conversation, and the sunlight scorched the path that was
ruled straight from stile to stile across the brown August fields,
and she could see, even from far away, how the white dust-clouds were
smoking on the road by the Green. She hesitated, and at last went
down under the far-spreading oak trees, by a winding way of grass
that cooled her feet.</p>

<p>Her mother, who was very kind and good, used to talk to her
sometimes on the evils of "exaggeration," on the necessity of
avoiding phrases violently expressed, words of too fierce an energy.
She remembered how she had run into the house a few days before and
had called her mother to look at a rose in the garden that "burnt
like a flame." Her mother had said the rose was very pretty, and a
little later had hinted her doubts as to the wisdom of "such very
strong expressions."</p>

<p>"I know, my dear Mary," she had said, "that in your case it isn't
affectation. You really <i>feel</i> what you say, don't you? Yes; but
is it nice to feel like that? Do you think that it's quite
<i>right</i>, even?"</p>

<p>The mother had looked at the girl with a curious wistfulness,
almost as if she would say something more, and sought for the fit
words, but could not find them. And then she merely remarked:</p>

<p>"You haven't seen Alfred Moorhouse since the tennis party, have
you? I must ask him to come next Tuesday; you like him?"</p>

<p>The daughter could not quite see the link between her fault of
"exaggeration" and the charming young barrister, but her mother's
warning recurred to her as she strayed down the shadowed path, and
felt the long dark grass cool and refreshing about her feet. She
would not have put this sensation into words, but she thought it was
as though her ankles were gently, sweetly kissed as the rich grass
touched them, and her mother would have said it was not right to
think such things.</p>

<p>And what a delight there was in the colours all about her! It was
as though she walked in a green cloud; the strong sunlight was
filtered through the leaves, reflected from the grass, and made
visible things&mdash;the tree-stems, the flowers, and her own
hands&mdash;seem new, transformed into another likeness. She had
walked by the woodpath over and over again, but to-day it had become
full of mystery and hinting, and every turn brought a surprise.</p>

<p>To-day the mere sense of being alone under the trees was an acute
secret joy, and as she went down deeper and the wood grew dark about
her, she loosened her brown hair, and when the sun shone over the
fallen tree she saw her hair was not brown, but bronze and golden,
glowing on her pure white dress.</p>

<p>She stayed by the well in the rock, and dared to make the dark
water her mirror, looking to right and left with shy glances and
listening for the rustle of parted boughs, before she would match her
gold with luminous ivory. She saw wonders in a glass as she leaned
over the shadowed, mysterious pool, and smiled at the smiling nymph,
whose lips parted as if to whisper secrets.</p>

<p>As she went on her way, the thin blue smoke rose from a gap in the
trees, and she remembered her childish dread of "the gipsies." She
walked a little farther, and laid herself to rest on a smooth patch
of turf, and listened to the strange intonations that sounded from
the camp. "Those horrible people" she had heard the yellow folk
called, but she found now a pleasure in voices that sang and,
indistinctly heard, were almost chantmg, with a rise and fall of
notes and a wild wail, and the solemnity of unknown speech. It seemed
a fit music for the unknown woodland, in harmony with the drip of the
well, and the birds' sharp notes, and the rustle and hurry of the
wood creatures.</p>

<p>She rose again and went on till she could see the red fire between
the boughs; and the voices thrilled into an incantation. She longed
to summon up courage and talk to these strange-wood-folk, but she was
afraid to burst into the camp. So she sat down under a tree and
waited, hoping that one of them might happen to come her way.</p>

<p>There were six or seven men, as many women, and a swarm of
fantastic children, lolling and squatting about the fire, gabbling to
one another in their singsong speech. They were people of curious
aspect, short and squat, high-cheek-boned, with dingy yellow skin and
long almond eyes; only in one or two of the younger men there was a
suggestion of a wild, almost faun-like grace, as of creatures who
always moved between the red fire and the green leaf. Though
everybody called them gipsies, they were in reality Turanian
metal-workers, degenerated into wandering tinkers; their ancestors
had fashioned the bronze battle-axes, and they mended pots and
kettles. Mary waited under the tree, sure that she had nothing to
fear, and resolved not to run away if one of them appeared.</p>

<p>The sun sank into a mass of clouds and the air grew close and
heavy; a mist steamed up about the trees, a blue mist like the smoke
of a wood-fire. A strange smiling face peered out from between the
leaves, and the girl knew that her heart leapt as the young man
walked towards her.</p>

<p>The Turanians moved their camp that night. There was a red glint,
like fire, in the vast shadowy west, and then a burning paten floated
up from a wild hill. A procession of weird bowed figures passed
across the crimson disk, one stumbling after another in long single
file, each bending down beneath his huge shapeless pack, and the
children crawled last, goblin-like, fantastic.</p>

<p>The girl was lying in her white room, caressing a small green
stone, a curious thing cut with strange devices, awful with age. She
held it close to the luminous ivory, and the gold poured upon it.</p>

<p>She laughed for joy, and murmured and whispered to herself, asking
herself questions in the bewilderment of her delight. She was afraid
to say anything to her mother.</p>

<h2>The Rose Garden</h2>

<p>And afterwards she went very softly, and opened the window and
looked out. Behind her the room was in a mystical semi-darkness;
chairs and tables were hovering, ill-defined shapes, there was but
the faintest illusory glitter from the talc moons in the rich Indian
curtain which she had drawn across the door. The yellow silk
draperies of the bed were but suggestions of colour, and the pillow
and the white sheets glimmered as a white cloud in a far sky at
twilight.</p>

<p>She turned from the dusky room, and with dewy tender eyes gazed
out across the garden towards the lake. She could not rest nor lay
herself down to sleep; though it was late, and half the night had
passed, she could not rest. A sickle moon was slowly drawing upwards
through certain filmy clouds that stretched in a long band from east
to west, and a pallid light began to flow from the dark water, as if
there also some vague star were rising. She looked with eyes
insatiable for wonder; and she found a strange Eastern effect in the
bordering of reeds, in their spear-like shapes, in the liquid ebony
that they shadowed, in the fine inlay of pearl and silver as the moon
shone free; a bright symbol in the steadfast calm of the sky.</p>

<p>There were faint stirring sounds heard from the fringe of reeds,
and now and then the drowsy broken cry of water-fowl, for they knew
that the dawn was not far off. In the centre of the lake was a carved
white pedestal, and on it shone a white boy holding the double flute
to his lips.</p>

<p>Beyond the lake the park began, and sloped gently to the verge of
the wood, now but a dark cloud beneath the sickle moon. And then
beyond and farther still, undiscovered hills, grey bands of cloud,
and the steep pale height of the heaven. She gazed on with her tender
eyes, bathing herself as it were in the deep rest of the night,
veiling her soul with the half-light and the half-shadow, stretching
out her delicate hands into the coolness of the misty silvered air,
wondering at her hands.</p>

<p>And then she turned from the window, and made herself a divan of
cushion on the Persian carpet, and half sat, half lay there, as
motionless, as ecstatic as a poet dreaming under roses, far in
Ispahan. She gazed out, after all, to assure herself that sight and
the eyes showed nothing but a glimmering veil, a gauze of curious
lights and figures, that in it there was no reality or substance. He
had always told her that there was only one existence, one science,
one religion, that the external world was but a variegated shadow,
which might either conceal or reveal the truth; and now she
believed.</p>

<p>He had shown her that bodily rapture might be the ritual and
expression of the ineffable mysteries, of the world beyond sense,
that must be entered by the way of sense; and now she believed. She
had never much doubted any of his words, from the moment of their
meeting a month before. She had looked up as she sat in the arbour,
and her father was walking down between the avenue of roses bringing
to her the stranger, thin and dark with a pointed beard and
melancholy eyes. He murmured something to himself as they shook
hands; she could hear the rich unknown words that sounded as the echo
of far music. Afterwards he had told her what the lines were:</p>

<p class="poem">How say ye that I was lost? I wandered among
roses.<br>
Can he go astray who enters the rose garden?<br>
The lover in the house of his Darling is not forlorn.<br>
I wandered among roses. How say ye that I was lost?</p>

His voice, murmuring the strange words, had persuaded her, and now
she had the rapture of the perfect knowledge. She had looked out into
the silvery uncertain night in order that she might experience the
sense that for her these things no longer existed. She was not any
more a part of the garden, or of the lake, or of the wood, or of the
life that she had led hitherto. Another line that he had quoted came
to her:

<p class="poem">The kingdom of I and We forsake, and your home in
annihilation make.</p>

<p>It had seemed at first almost nonsense, if it had been possible
for him to talk nonsense; but now she was thrilled and filled with
the meaning of it. Herself was annihilated; at his bidding she had
destroyed all her old feelings, and emotions, her likes and dislikes,
all the inherited loves and hates that her father and mother had
given her; the old life had been thrown utterly away.</p>

<p>It grew light, and when the dawn burned she fell asleep,
murmuring:</p>

<p>"How say ye that I was lost?"</p>

<h2>The Ceremony</h2>

<p>From her childhood, from those early and misty days which began to
seem unreal, she recollected the grey stone in the wood.</p>

<p>It was something between the pillar and the pyramid in shape, and
its grey solemnity amidst the leaves and the grass shone and shone
from those early years, always with some hint of wonder. She
remembered how, when she was quite a little girl, she had strayed one
day, on a hot afternoon, from her nurse's side, and only a little way
in the wood the grey stone rose from the grass, and she cried out and
ran back in panic terror.</p>

<p>"What a silly little girl!" the nurse had said. "It's only the
&mdash;&mdash; stone." She had quite forgotten the name that the
servant had given, and she was always ashamed to ask as she grew
older.</p>

<p>But always that hot day, that burning afternoon of her childhood
when she had first looked consciously on the grey image in the wood,
remained not a memory, but a sensation. The wide wood swelling like
the sea, the tossing of the bright boughs in the sunshine, the sweet
smell of the grass and flowers, the beating of the summer wind upon
her cheek, the gloom of the underglade rich, indistinct, gorgeous,
significant as old tapestry; she could feel it and see it all, and
the scent of it was in her nostrils. And in the midst of the picture,
where strange plants grew gross in shadow, was the old grey shape of
the stone.</p>

<p>But there were in her mind broken remnants of another and far
earlier impression. It was all uncertain, the shadow of a shadow, so
vague that it might well have been a dream that had mingled with the
confused waking thoughts of a little child. She did not know that she
remembered, she rather remembered the memory. But again it was a
summer day, and a woman, perhaps the same nurse, held her in her
arms, and went through the wood. The woman carried bright flowers in
one hand; the dream had in it a glow of bright red, and the perfume
of cottage roses. Then she saw herself put down for a moment on the
grass, and the red colour stained the grim stone, and there was
nothing else&mdash;except that one night she woke up and heard the
nurse sobbing.</p>

<p>She often used to think of the strangeness of very early life; one
came, it seemed, from a dark cloud, there was a glow of light, but
for a moment, and afterwards the night. It was as if one gazed at a
velvet curtain, heavy, mysterious, impenetrable blackness, and then,
for the twinkling of an eye, one spied through a pinhole a storied
town that flamed, with fire about its walls and pinnacles. And then
again the folding darkness, so that sight became illusion, almost in
the seeing. So to her was that earliest, doubtful vision of the grey
stone, of the red colour spilled upon it, with the incongruous
episode of the nursemaid, who wept at night.</p>

<p>But the later memory was clear; she could feel, even now, the
inconsequent terror that sent her away shrieking, running to the
nurse's skirts. Afterwards, through the days of girlhood, the stone
had taken its place amongst the vast array of unintelligible things
which haunt every child's imagination. It was part of life, to be
accepted and not questioned; her elders spoke of many things which
she could not understand, she opened books and was dimly amazed, and
in the Bible there were many phrases which seemed strange. Indeed,
she was often puzzled by her parents' conduct, by their looks at one
another, by their half-words, and amongst all these problems which
she hardly recognized as problems, was the grey ancient figure rising
from dark grass.</p>

<p>Some semi-conscious impulse made her haunt the wood where shadow
enshrined the stone. One thing was noticeable: that all through the
summer months the passers-by dropped flowers there. Withered blossoms
were always on the ground, amongst the grass, and on the stone fresh
blooms constantly appeared. From the daffodil to the Michaelmas daisy
there was marked the calendar of the cottage gardens, and in the
winter she had seen sprays of juniper and box, mistletoe and holly.
Once she had been drawn through the bushes by a red glow, as if there
had been a fire in the wood, and when she came to the place, all the
stone shone and all the ground about it was bright with roses.</p>

<p>In her eighteenth year she went one day into the wood, carrying
with her a book that she was reading. She hid herself in a nook of
hazel, and her soul was full of poetry, when there was a rustling,
the rapping of parted boughs returning to their place. Her
concealment was but a little way from the stone, and she peered
through the net of boughs, and saw a girl timidly approaching. She
knew her quite well: it was Annie Dolben, the daughter of a labourer,
lately a promising pupil at Sunday school. Annie was a nice-mannered
girl, never failing in her curtsey, wonderful for her knowledge of
the Jewish Kings. Her face had taken an expression that whispered,
that hinted strange things; there was a light and a glow behind the
veil of flesh. And in her hand she bore lilies.</p>

<p>The lady hidden in hazels watched Annie come close to the grey
image; for a moment her whole body palpitated with expectation,
almost the sense of what was to happen dawned upon her. She watched
Annie crown the stone with flowers; she watched the amazing ceremony
that followed.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of all her blushing shame, she herself bore
blossoms to the wood a few months later. She laid white hot-house
lilies upon the stone, and orchids of dying purple, and crimson
exotic flowers. Having kissed the grey image with devout passion, she
performed there all the antique immemorial rite.</p>

<h2>The Soldiers' Rest</h2>

<p>The soldier with the ugly wound in the head opened his eyes at
last, and looked about him with an air of pleasant satisfaction.</p>

<p>He still felt drowsy and dazed with some fierce experience through
which he had passed, but so far he could not recollect much about it.
But an agreeable glow began to steal about his heart&mdash;such a
glow as comes to people who have been in a tight place and have come
through it better than they had expected. In its mildest form this
set of emotions may be observed in passengers who have crossed the
Channel on a windy day without being sick. They triumph a little
internally, and are suffused with vague, kindly feelings.</p>

<p>The wounded soldier was somewhat of this disposition as he opened
his eyes, pulled himself together, and looked about him. He felt a
sense of delicious ease and repose in bones that had been racked and
weary, and deep in the heart that had so lately been tormented there
was an assurance of comfort&mdash;of the battle won. The thundering,
roaring waves were passed; he had entered into the haven of calm
waters. After fatigues and terrors that as yet he could not recollect
he seemed now to be resting in the easiest of all easy chairs in a
dim, low room.</p>

<p>In the hearth there was a glint of fire and a blue, sweet-scented
puff of wood smoke; a great black oak beam roughly hewn crossed the
ceiling. Through the leaded panes of the windows he saw a rich glow
of sunlight, green lawns, and against the deepest and most radiant of
all blue skies the wonderful far-lifted towers of a vast Gothic
cathedral&mdash;mystic, rich with imagery.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he murmured to himself. "I didn't know they had such
places in France. It's just like Wells. And it might be the other day
when I was going past the Swan, just as it might be past that window,
and asked the ostler what time it was, and he says, 'What time? Why,
summertime'; and there outside it looks like summer that would last
for ever. If this was an inn they ought to call it 'The Soldiers'
Rest.'"</p>

<p>He dozed off again, and when he opened his eyes once more a kindly
looking man in some sort of black robe was standing by him.</p>

<p>"It's all right now, isn't it?" he said, speaking in good
English.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, sir, as right as can be. I hope to be back again
soon."</p>

<p>"Well, well; but how did you come here? Where did you get that?"
He pointed to the wound on the soldier's forehead.</p>

<p>The soldier put his hand up to his brow and looked dazed and
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he said at last, "it was like this, to begin at the
beginning. You know how we came over in August, and there we were in
the thick of it, as you might say, in a day or two. An awful time it
was, and I don't know how I got through it alive. My best friend was
killed dead beside me as we lay in the trenches. By Cambrai, I think
it was.</p>

<p>"Then things got a little quieter for a bit, and I was quartered
in a village for the best part of a week. She was a very nice lady
where I was, and she treated me proper with the best of everything.
Her husband he was fighting; but she had the nicest little boy I ever
knew, a little fellow of five, or six it might be, and we got on
splendid. The amount of their lingo that kid taught me&mdash;'We, we'
and 'Bong swor' and 'Commong voo porty voo,' and all&mdash;and I
taught him English. You should have heard that nipper say ''Arf a
mo', old un'! It was a treat.</p>

<p>"Then one day we got surprised. There was about a dozen of us in
the village, and two or three hundred Germans came down on us early
one morning. They got us; no help for it. Before we could shoot.</p>

<p>"Well, there we were. They tied our hands behind our backs, and
smacked our faces and kicked us a bit, and we were lined up opposite
the house where I'd been staying.</p>

<p>"And then that poor little chap broke away from his mother, and he
run out and saw one of the Boshes, as we call them, fetch me one over
the jaw with his clenched fist. Oh dear! oh dear! he might have done
it a dozen times if only that little child hadn't seen him.</p>

<p>"He had a poor bit of a toy I'd bought him at the village shop; a
toy gun it was. And out he came running, as I say, crying out
something in French like 'Bad man! bad man! don't hurt my Anglish or
I shoot you'; and he pointed that gun at the German soldier. The
German, he took his bayonet, and he drove it right through the poor
little chap's throat."</p>

<p>The soldier's face worked and twitched and twisted itself into a
sort of grin, and he sat grinding his teeth and staring at the man in
the black robe. He was silent for a little. And then he found his
voice, and the oaths rolled terrible, thundering from him, as he
cursed that murderous wretch, and bade him go down and burn for ever
in hell. And the tears were raining down his face, and they choked
him at last.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, I'm sure," he said, "especially you being
a minister of some kind, I suppose; but I can't help it. He was such
a dear little man."</p>

<p>The man in black murmured something to himself: "<i>Pretiosa in
conspectu Domini mars innocentium ejus</i>"&mdash;Dear in the sight
of the Lord is the death of His innocents. Then he put a kind hand
very gently on the soldier's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said he; "I've seen some service in my time, myself.
But what about that wound?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that; that's nothing. But I'll tell you how I got it. It was
just like this. The Germans had us fair, as I tell you, and they shut
us up in a barn in the village; just flung us on the ground and left
us to starve seemingly. They barred up the big door of the barn, and
put a sentry there, and thought we were all right.</p>

<p>"There were sort of slits like very narrow windows in one of the
walls, and on the second day it was, I was looking out of these slits
down the street, and I could see those German devils were up to
mischief. They were planting their machine guns everywhere handy
where an ordinary man coming up the street would never see them, but
I see them, and I see the infantry lining up behind the garden walls.
Then I had a sort of a notion of what was coming; and presently, sure
enough, I could hear some of our chaps singing 'Hullo, hullo, hullo!'
in the distance; and I says to myself, 'Not this time.'</p>

<p>"So I looked about me, and I found a hole under the wall; a kind
of a drain I should think it was, and I found I could just squeeze
through. And I got out and crept round, and away I goes running down
the street, yelling for all I was worth, just as our chaps were
getting round the corner at the bottom. 'Bang, bang!' went the guns,
behind me and in front of me, and on each side of me, and
then&mdash;bash! something hit me on the head and over I went; and I
don't remember anything more till I woke up here just now."</p>

<p>The soldier lay back in his chair and closed his eyes for a
moment. When he opened them he saw that there were other people in
the room besides the minister in the black robes. One was a man in a
big black cloak. He had a grim old face and a great beaky nose. He
shook the soldier by the hand.</p>

<p>"By God! sir," he said, "you're a credit to the British Army;
you're a damned fine soldier and a good man, and, by God! I'm proud
to shake hands with you."</p>

<p>And then someone came out of the shadow, someone in queer clothes
such as the soldier had seen worn by the heralds when he had been on
duty at the opening of Parliament by the King.</p>

<p>"Now, by <i>Corpus Domini</i>," this man said, "of all knights ye
be noblest and gentlest, and ye be of fairest report, and now ye be a
brother of the noblest brotherhood that ever was since this world's
beginning, since ye have yielded dear life for your friends'
sake."</p>

<p>The soldier did not understand what the man was saying to him.
There were others, too, in strange dresses, who came and spoke to
him. Some spoke in what sounded like French. He could not make it
out; but he knew that they all spoke kindly and praised him.</p>

<p>"What does it all mean?" he said to the minister. "What are they
talking about? They don't think I'd let down my pals?"</p>

<p>"Drink this," said the minister, and he handed the soldier a great
silver cup, brimming with wine.</p>

<p>The soldier took a deep draught, and in that moment all his
sorrows passed from him.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Vin nouveau du Royaume</i>," said the minister. "New Wine of
the Kingdom, you call it." And then he bent down and murmured in the
soldier's ear.</p>

<p>"What," said the wounded man, "the place they used to tell us
about in Sunday School? With such drink and such
joy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice was hushed. For as he looked at the minister the fashion
of his vesture was changed. The black robe seemed to melt away from
him. He was all in armour, if armour be made of starlight, of the
rose of dawn, and of sunset fires; and he lifted up a great sword of
flame.<br>

<h2>The Happy Children</h2>

<p>A day after the Christmas of 1915, my professional duties took me
up north; or to be as precise as our present conventions allow, to
"the North-Eastern district." There was some singular talk; mad
gossip of the Germans having a "dug-out" somewhere by Malton Head.
Nobody seemed to be quite clear as to what they were doing there or
what they hoped to do there; but the report ran like wildfire from
one foolish mouth to another, and it was thought desirable that the
whole silly tale should be tracked down to its source and exposed or
denied once and for all.</p>

<p>I went up, then, to that north-eastern district on Sunday,
December 26th, 1915, and pursued my investigations from Helmsdale
Bay, which is a small watering-place within a couple of miles of
Malton Head. The people of the dales and the moors had just heard of
the fable, I found, and regarded it all with supreme and sour
contempt. So far as I could make out, it originated from the games of
some children who had stayed at Helmsdale Bay in the summer. They had
acted a rude drama of German spies and their capture, and had used
Helby Cavern, between Helmsdale and Malton Head, as the scene of
their play. That was all; the fools apparently had done the rest; the
fools who believed with all their hearts in "the Russians," and got
cross with anyone who expressed a doubt as to "the Angels of
Mons."</p>

<p>"Gang oop to beasten and tell them sike a tale and they'll not
believe it," said one dalesman to me; and I have a suspicion that he
thought that I, who had come so many hundred miles to investigate the
story, was but little wiser than those who credited it. He could not
be expected to understand that a journalist has two offices&mdash;to
proclaim the truth and to denounce the lie.</p>

<p>I had finished with "the Germans" and their dug-out early in the
afternoon of Monday, and I decided to break the journey home at
Banwick, which I had often heard of as a beautiful and curious old
place. So I took the one-thirty train, and went wandering inland, and
stopped at many unknown stations in the midst of great levels, and
changed at Marishes Ambo, and went on again through a strange land in
the dimness of the winter afternoon. Somehow the train left the level
and glided down into a deep and narrow dell, dark with winter woods,
brown with withered bracken, solemn in its loneliness. The only thing
that moved was the swift and rushing stream that foamed over the
boulders and then lay still in brown pools under the bank.</p>

<p>The dark woods scattered and thinned into groups of stunted,
ancient thorns; great grey rocks, strangely shaped, rose out of the
ground; crenellated rocks rose on the heights on either side. The
brooklet swelled and became a river, and always following this river
we came to Banwick soon after the setting of the sun.</p>

<p>I saw the wonder of the town in the light of the afterglow that
was red in the west. The clouds blossomed into rose-gardens; there
were seas of fairy green that swam about isles of crimson light;
there were clouds like spears of flame, like dragons of fire. And
under the mingling lights and colours of such a sky Banwick went down
to the pools of its land-locked harbour and climbed again across the
bridge towards the ruined abbey and the great church on the hill.</p>

<p>I came from the station by an ancient street, winding and narrow,
with cavernous closes and yards opening from it on either side, and
flights of uneven steps going upward to high terraced houses, or
downward to the harbour and the incoming tide. I saw there many
gabled houses, sunken with age far beneath the level of the pavement,
with dipping roof-trees and bowed doorways, with traces of grotesque
carving on their walls. And when I stood on the quay, there on the
other side of the harbour was the most amazing confusion of red-tiled
roofs that I had ever seen, and the great grey Norman church high on
the bare hill above them; and below them the boats swinging in the
swaying tide and the water burning in the fires of the sunset. It was
the town of a magic dream. I stood on the quay till the shining had
gone from the sky and the waterpools, and the winter night came down
dark upon Banwick.</p>

<p>I found an old snug inn just by the harbour, where I had been
standing. The walls of the rooms met each other at odd and unexpected
angles; there were strange projections and juttings of masonry, as if
one room were trying to force its way into another; there were
indications as of unthinkable staircases in the corners of the
ceilings. But there was a bar where Tom Smart would have loved to
sit, with a roaring fire and snug, old elbow chairs about it and
pleasant indications that if "something warm" were wanted after
supper it could be generously supplied.</p>

<p>I sat in this pleasant place for an hour or two and talked to the
pleasant people of the town who came in and out. They told me of the
old adventures and industries of the town. It had once been, they
said, a great whaling port, and then there had been a lot of
shipbuilding, and later Banwick had been famous for its
amber-cutting. "And now there's nowt," said one of the men in the
bar; "but we get on none so badly."</p>

<p>I went out for a stroll before my supper. Banwick was now black,
in thick darkness. For good reasons not a single lamp was lighted in
the streets, hardly a gleam showed from behind the closely curtained
windows. It was as if one walked a town of the Middle Ages, and with
the ancient overhanging shapes of the houses dimly visible I was
reminded of those strange, cavernous pictures of medi&aelig;val Paris
and Tours that Dor&eacute; drew.</p>

<p>Hardly anyone was abroad in the streets; but all the courts and
alleys seemed alive with children. I could just see little white
forms fluttering to and fro as they ran in and out. And I never heard
such happy children's voices. Some were singing, some were laughing;
and peering into one black cavern, I made out a ring of children
dancing round and round and chanting in clear voices a wonderful
melody; some old tune of local tradition, as I supposed, for its
modulations were such as I had never heard before.</p>

<p>I went back to my tavern and spoke to the landlord about the
number of children who were playing about the dark streets and
courts, and how delightfully happy they all seemed to be.</p>

<p>He looked at me steadily for a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>"Well, you see, sir, the children have got a bit out of hand of
late; their fathers are out at the front, and their mothers can't
keep them in order. So they're running a bit wild."</p>

<p>There was something odd about his manner. I could not make out
exactly what the oddity was, or what it meant. I could see that my
remark had somehow made him uncomfortable; but I was at a loss to
know what I had done. I had my supper, and then sat down for a couple
of hours to settle "the Germans" of Malton Head.</p>

<p>I finished my account of the German myth, and instead of going to
bed, I determined that I would have one more look at Banwick in its
wonderful darkness. So I went out and crossed the bridge, and began
to climb up the street on the other side, where there was that
strange huddle of red roofs mounting one above the other that I had
seen in the afterglow. And to my amazement I found that these
extraordinary Banwick children were still about and abroad, still
revelling and carolling, dancing and singing, standing, as I
supposed, on the top of the flights of steps that climbed from the
courts up the hillside, and so having the appearance of floating in
mid-air. And their happy laughter rang out like bells on the
night.</p>

<p>It was a quarter past eleven when I had left my inn, and I was
just thinking that the Banwick mothers had indeed allowed indulgence
to go too far, when the children began again to sing that old melody
that I had heard in the evening. And now the sweet, clear voices
swelled out into the night, and, I thought, must be numbered by
hundreds. I was standing in a dark alley-way, and I saw with
amazement that the children were passing me in a long procession that
wound up the hill towards the abbey. Whether a faint moon now rose,
or whether clouds passed from before the stars, I do not know; but
the air lightened, and I could see the children plainly as they went
by singing, with the rapture and exultation of them that sing in the
woods in springtime.</p>

<p>They were all in white, but some of them had strange marks upon
them which, I supposed, were of significance in this fragment of some
traditional mystery-play that I was beholding. Many of them had
wreaths of dripping seaweed about their brows; one showed a painted
scar on her throat; a tiny boy held open his white robe, and pointed
to a dreadful wound above his heart, from which the blood seemed to
flow; another child held out his hands wide apart and the palms
looked torn and bleeding, as if they had been pierced. One of the
children held up a little baby in her arms, and even the infant
showed the appearance of a wound on its face.</p>

<p>The procession passed me by, and I heard it still singing as if in
the sky as it went on its steep way up the hill to the ancient
church. I went back to my inn, and as I crossed the bridge it
suddenly struck me that this was the eve of the Holy Innocents'. No
doubt I had seen a confused relic of some medi&aelig;val observance,
and when I got back to the inn I asked the landlord about it.</p>

<p>Then I understood the meaning of the strange expression I had seen
on the man's face. He was sick and shuddering with terror; he drew
away from me as though I were a messenger from the dead.</p>

<p>Some weeks after this I was reading in a book called <i>The
Ancient Rites of Banwick</i>. It was written in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth by some anonymous person who had seen the glory of the old
abbey, and then the desolation that had come to it. I found this
passage:</p>

<p>"And on Childermas Day, at midnight, there was done there a
marvellous solemn service. For when the monks had ended their singing
of Te Deum at their Mattins, there came unto the altar the lord
abbot, gloriously arrayed in a vestment of cloth of gold, so that it
was a great marvel to behold him. And there came also into the church
all the children that were of tender years of Banwick, and they were
all clothed in white robes. And then began the lord abbot to sing the
Mass of the Holy Innocents. And when the sacring of the Mass was
ended, then there came up from the church into the quire the youngest
child that there was present that might hold himself aright. And this
child was borne up to the high altar, and the lord abbot set the
little child upon a golden and glistering throne afore the high
altar, and bowed down and worshipped him, singing, 'Talium Regnum
Coelorum, Alleluya. Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven. Alleluya,' and
all the quire answered singing, 'Amicti sunt stolis albis, Alleluya,
Alleluya; They are clad in white robes, Alleluya, Alleluya.' And then
the prior and all the monks in their order did like worship and
reverence to the little child that was upon the throne."</p>

<p>I had seen the White Order of the Innocents. I had seen those who
came singing from the deep waters that are about the
<i>Lusitania</i>; I had seen the innocent martyrs of the fields of
Flanders and France rejoicing as they went up to hear their Mass in
the spiritual place.</p>

<h2>THE COSY ROOM</h2>

<h4>(1929)</h4>

<p>And he found to his astonishment that he came to the appointed
place with a sense of profound relief. It was true that the window
was somewhat high up in the wall, and that, in case of fire, it might
be difficult, for many reasons, to get out that way; it was barred
like the basement windows that one sees now and then in London
houses, but as for the rest it was an extremely snug room. There was
a gay flowering paper on the walls, a hanging bookshelf&mdash;his
stomach sickened for an instant&mdash;a little table under the window
with a board and draughtsmen on it, two or three good pictures,
religious and ordinary, and the man who looked after him was
arranging the tea-things on the table in the middle of the room. And
there was a nice wicker chair by a bright fire. It was a thoroughly
pleasant room; cosy you would call it. And, thank God, it was all
over, anyhow.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>It had been a horrible time for the last three months, up to an
hour ago. First of all there was the trouble; all over in a minute,
that was, and couldn't be helped, though it was a pity, and the girl
wasn't worth it. But then there was the getting out of the town. He
thought at first of just going abput his ordinary business and
knowing nothing about it; he didn't think that anybody had seen him
following Joe down to the river. Why not loaf about as usual, and say
nothing, and go into the Ringland Arms for a pint? It might be days
before they found the body under the alders; and there would be an
inquest, and all that. Would it be the best plan just to stick it
out, and hold his tongue if the police came asking him questions? But
then, how could he account for himself and his doings that evening?
He might say he went for a stroll in Bleadon Woods and home again
without meeting anybody. There was nobody who could contradict him
that he could think of.</p>

<p>And now, sitting in the snug room with the bright wallpaper,
sitting in the cosy chair by the fire&mdash;all so different from the
tales they told of such places&mdash;he wished he had stuck it out
and faced it out, and let them come on and find out what they could.
But then he had got frightened. Lots of men had heard him swearing
it would be outing does for Joe If he didn't leave the girl alone.
And he had shown his revolver to Dick Haddon and "Lobster" Carey, and
Finniman, and others, and then they would be fitting the bullet into
the revolver, and it would be all up. He got into a panic and shook
with terror, and knew he could never stay in Ledham, not another
hour.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Mrs. Evans, his landlady, was spending the evening with her
married daughter at the other side of the town, and would not be back
till eleven. He shaved off his stubbly black beard and moustache, and
slunk out of the town in the dark and walked all through the night by
a lonely by-road, and got to Darnley, twenty miles away, in the
morning in time to catch the London excursion. There was a great
crowd of people, and, so far as he could see, nobody that he knew,
and the carriages packed full of Darnleyites and Lockwood weavers all
in high spirits and taking no notice of him. They all got out at
King's Cross, and he strolled about with the rest, and looked round
here and there as they did and had a glass of beer at a crowded bar.
He didn't see how anybody was to find out where he had gone.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>He got a back room in a quiet street off the Caledonian Road, and
waited. There was something in the evening paper that night,
something that you couldn't very well make out. By the next day Joe's
body was found, and they got to Murder&mdash;the doctor said it
couldn't be suicide. Then his own name came in, and he was missing
and was asked to come forward. And then he read that he was supposed
to have gone to London, and he went sick with fear. He went hot and
he went cold. Something rose in his throat and choked him. His hands
shook as he held the paper, his head whirled with terror. He was
afraid to go home to his room, because he knew he could not stay
still in it; he would be tramping up and down, like a wild beast, and
the landlady would wonder. And he was afraid to be in the streets,
for fear a policeman would come behind him and put a hand on his
shoulder. There was a kind of small square round the corner and he
sat down on one of the benches there and held up the paper before his
face, with the children yelling and howling and playing all about him
on the asphalt paths. They took no notice of him, and yet they were
company of a sort; it was not like being all alone in that little,
quiet room. But it soon got dark and the man came to shut the
gates.</p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>And after that night; nights and days of horror and sick terrors
that he never had known a man could suffer and live. He had brought
enough money to keep him for a while, but every time he changed a
note he shook with fear, wondering whether it would be traced. What
could he do? Where could he go? Could he get out of the country? But
there were passports and papers of all sorts; that would never do. He
read that the police held a clue to the Ledham Murder Mystery; and he
trembled to his lodgings and locked himself in and moaned in his
agony, and then found himself chattering words and phrases at random,
without meaning or relevance; strings of gibbering words: "all right,
all right, all right ... yes, yes, yes, yes ... there, there, there
... well, well, well, well ..." just because he must utter something,
because he could not bear to sit still and silent, with that anguish
tearing his heart, with that sick horror choking him, with that
weight of terror pressing on his breast. And then, nothing happened;
and a little, faint, trembling hope fluttered in his breast for a
while, and for a day or two he felt he might have a chance after
all.</p>

<p>One night he was in such a happy state that he ventured round to
the little public-house at the corner, and drank a bottle of Old
Brown Ale with some enjoyment, and began to think of what life might
be again, if by a miracle&mdash;he recognized even then that it would
be a miracle&mdash;all this horror passed away, and he was once more
just like other men, with nothing to be afraid of. He was relishing
the Brown Ale, and quite plucking up a spirit, when a chance phrase
from the bar caught him: "looking for him not far from here, so they
say." He left the glass of beer half full, and went out wondering
whether he had the courage to kill himself that night. As a matter of
fact the men at the bar were talking about a recent and sensational
cat burglar; but every such word was doom to this wretch. And ever
and again, he would check himself in his horrors, in his mutterings
and gibberings, and wonder with amazement that the heart of a man
could suffer such bitter agony, such rending torment. It was as if he
had found out and discovered, he alone of all men living, a new world
of which no man before had ever dreamed, in which no man could
believe, if he were told the story of it. He had woken up in his past
life from such nightmares, now and again, as most men suffer. They
were terrible, so terrible that he remembered two or three of them
that had oppressed him years before; but they were pure delight to
what he now endured. Not endured, but writhed under as a worm
twisting amidst red, burning coals. He went out into the streets,
some noisy, some dull and empty, and considered in his panic-stricken
confusion which he should choose. They were looking for him in that
part of London; there was deadly peril in every step. The streets
where people went to and fro and laughed and chattered might be the
safer; he could walk with the others and seem to be of them, and so
be less likely to be noticed by those who were hunting on his track.
But then, on the other hand, the great electric lamps made these
streets almost as bright as day, and every feature of the passers-by
was clearly seen. True, he was clean-shaven now, and the pictures of
him in the papers showed a bearded man, and his own face in the glass
still looked strange to him. Still, there were sharp eyes that could
penetrate such disguises; and they might have brought down some man
from Ledham who knew him well, and knew the way he walked; and so he
might be haled and held at any moment. He dared not walk under the
clear blaze of the electric lamps. He would be safe in the dark,
quiet by-ways.</p>

<p>He was turning aside, making for a very quiet street close by,
when he hesitated. This street, indeed, was still enough after dark,
and not over well lighted. It was a street of low, two-storied houses
of grey brick that had grimed, with three or four families in each
house. Tired men came home here after working hard all day, and
people drew their blinds early and stirred very little abroad, and
went early to bed; footsteps were rare in this street and in other
streets into which it led, and the lamps were few and dim compared
with those in the big thoroughfares. And yet, the very fact that few
people were about made such as were all the more noticeable and
conspicuous. And the police went slowly on their beats in the dark
streets as in the bright, and with few people to look at no doubt
they looked all the more keenly at such as passed on the pavement. In
his world, that dreadful world that he had discovered and dwelt in
alone, the darkness was brighter than the daylight, and solitude more
dangerous than a multitude of men. He dared not go into the light, he
feared the shadows, and went trembling to his room and shuddered
there as the hours of the night went by; shuddered and gabbled to
himself his infernal rosary: "all right, all right, all right ...
splendid, splendid ... that's the way, that's the way, that's the
way, that's the way ... yes, yes, yes ... first rate, first rate ...
all right ... one, one, one, one"&mdash;gabbled in a low mutter to
keep himself from howling like a wild beast.</p>

<h4>VI</h4>

<p>It was somewhat in the manner of a wild beast that he beat and
tore against the cage of his fate. Now and again it struck him as
incredible. He would not believe that it was so. It was something
that he would wake from, as he had waked from those nightmares that
he remembered, for things did not really happen so. He could not
believe it, he would not believe it. Or, if it were so indeed, then
all these horrors must be happening to some other man into whose
torments he had mysteriously entered. Or he had got into a book, into
a tale which one read and shuddered at, but did not for one moment
credit; all make-believe, it must be, and presumably everything would
be all right again. And then the truth came down on him like a heavy
hammer, and beat him down, and held him down&mdash;on the burning
coals of his anguish.</p>

<p>Now and then he tried to reason with himself. He forced himself to
be sensible, as he put it; not to give way, to think of his chances.
After all, it was three weeks since he had got into the excursion
train at Darnley, and he was still a free man, and every day of
freedom made his chances better. These things often die down. There
were lots of cases in which the police never got the man they were
after. He lit his pipe and began to think things over quietly. It
might be a good plan to give his landlady notice, and leave at the
end of the week, and make for somewhere in South London, and try to
get a job of some sort: that would help to put them off his track. He
got up and looked thoughtfully out of the window; and caught his
breath. There, outside the little newspaper shop opposite, was the
bill of the evening paper: New Clue in Ledham Murder Mystery.</p>

<h4>VII</h4>

<p>The moment came at last. He never knew the exact means by which he
was hunted down. As a matter of fact, a woman who knew him well
happened to be standing outside Darnley station on the Excursion Day
morning, and she had recognized him, in spite of his beardless chin.
And then, at the other end, his landlady, on her way upstairs, had
heard his mutterings and gabblings, though the voice was low. She was
interested, and curious, and a little frightened, and wondered
whether her lodger might be dangerous, and naturally she talked to
her friends. So the story trickled down to the ears of the police,
and the police asked about the date of the lodger's arrival. And
there you were. And there was our nameless friend, drinking a good,
hot cup of tea, and polishing off the bacon and eggs with rare
appetite; in the cosy room with the cheerful paper; otherwise the
Condemned Cell.</p>

<h2>Munitions of War</h2>

<h4>(1915)</h4>

<p>There was a thick fog, acrid and abominable, all over London when
I set out for the West. And at the heart of the fog, as it were, was
the shudder of the hard frost that made one think of those winters in
Dickens that had seemed to have become fabulous. It was a day on
which to hear in dreams the iron ring of the horses' hoofs on the
Great North Road, to meditate on the old inns with blazing fires, the
coach going onward into the darkness, into a frozen world.</p>

<p>A few miles out of London the fog lifted. The horizon was still
vague in a purple mist of cold, but the sun shone brilliantly from a
pale clear sky of blue, and all the earth was a magic of whiteness:
white fields stretched to that dim violet mist far away, white hedges
divided them, and the trees were all snowy white with the winter
blossom of the frost. The train had been delayed a little by the
thick fog about London; now it was rushing at a tremendous speed
through this strange white world.</p>

<p>My business with the famous town in the West was to attempt to
make some picture of it as it faced the stress of war, to find out
whether it prospered or not. From what I had seen in other large
towns, I expected to find it all of a bustle on the Saturday, its
shops busy, its streets thronged and massed with people. Therefore,
it was with no small astonishment that I found the atmosphere of
Westpool wholly different from anything I had observed at Sheffield
or Birmingham. Hardly anybody seemed to leave the train at the big
station, and the broad road into the town wore a shy, barred-up air;
it reminded one somewhat of the streets by which the traveller passes
into forgotten places, little villages that once were great cities. I
remember how in the town of my birth, Caerleon-on-Usk, the doctor's
wife would leave the fire and run to the window if a step sounded in
the main street outside; and strangely I was reminded of this as I
walked from the Westpool station. Save for one thing: at intervals
there were silent parties huddled together as if for help and
comfort, and all making for the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>There is a fair quarter of an hour's walk between Westpool station
and the centre of the town. And here I would say that though Westpool
is one of the biggest and busiest cities in England, it is also, in
my judgment, one of the most beautiful. Not only on account of the
ancient timbered houses that still overhang many of its narrower
streets, not only because of its glorious churches and noble old
traditions of splendour&mdash;I am known to be weak and partial where
such things are concerned&mdash;but rather because of its site. For
through the very heart of the great town a narrow, deep river runs,
full of tall ships, bordered by bustling quays; and so you can often
look over your garden wall and see-a cluster of masts, and the
shaking out of sails for a fair wind. And this bringing of deep-sea
business into the middle of the dusty streets has always seemed to me
an enchantment; there is something of Sindbad and Basra and Bagdad
and the Nights in it. But this is not all the delight of Westpool;
from the very quays of the river the town rushes up to great heights,
with streets so steep that often they are flights of steps as in St.
Peter Port, and ladder-like ascents. And as I came to Middle Quay in
Westpool that winter day, the sun hovered over the violet mists, and
the windows of the houses on the heights flamed and flashed red,
vehement fires.</p>

<p>But the slight astonishment with which I had noted the shuttered
and dismal aspect of the station road now became bewilderment. Middle
Quay is the heart of Westpool, and all its business. I had always
seen it swarm like an anthill. There were scarcely half a dozen
people there on Saturday afternoon; and they seemed to be hurrying
away. The Vintry and the Little Vintry, those famous streets, were
deserted. I saw in a moment that I had come on a fool's errand: in
Westpool assuredly there was no hurry or rush of war-business, no
swarm of eager shoppers for me to describe. I had an introduction to
a well-known Westpool man. "Oh, no," he said, "we are very slack in
Westpool. We are doing hardly anything. There's an aeroplane factory
out at Oldham, and they're making high explosives by Portdown, but
that doesn't affect us. Things are quiet, very quiet." I suggested
that they might brighten up a little at night. "No," he said, "it
really wouldn't be worth your while to stay on; you wouldn't find
anything to write about, I assure you."</p>

<p>I was not satisfied. I went out and about the desolate streets of
the great city; I made inquiries at random, and always heard the same
story&mdash;"Things were very slack." And I began to receive an
extraordinary impression: that the few I met were frightened, and
were making the best of their way, either out of the town, or to the
safety of their own bolted doors and barred shutters. It was only the
very special mention of a friendly commercial traveller of my
acquaintance that got me a room for the night at the Pineapple on
Middle Quay, overlooking the river. The landlord assented with
difficulty, after praising the express to town. "It's a noisy place,
this," he said, "if you're not used to it." I looked at him. It was
as quiet as if we were in the heart of the forest or the desert. "You
see," he said, "we don't do much in munitions, but there's a lot of
night transport for the docks at Portdown. You know those climbing
motors that they use in the Army, caterpillars or whatever they call
them. We get a lot of them through Westpool; we get all sorts of
heavy stuff, and I expect they'll wake you at night. I wouldn't go to
the window, if I were you, if you do wake up. They don't like anybody
peering about."</p>

<p>And I woke up in the dead of night. There was a thundering and a
rumbling and a trembling of the earth such as I had never heard. And
shouting too; and rolling oaths that sounded like judgment. I got up
and drew the blind a little aside, in spite of the landlord's
warning, and there was that desolate Middle Quay swarming with men,
and the river full of great ships, faint and huge in the frosty mist,
and sailing-ships too. Men were rolling casks by the hundred down to
the ships. "Hurry up, you lazy lubbers, you damned sons of guns, damn
ye!" bellowed a huge voice. "Shall the King's Majesty lack powder?"
"No, by God, he shall not!" roared the answer. "I rolled it aboard
for old King George, and young King George shall be none the worse
for me."</p>

<p>"And who the devil are you to speak so bold?"</p>

<p>"Blast ye, bos'n; I fell at Trafalgar."</p>

<h4><a name="14_1"><span class="smcap">i<br>
 The Rumour of the Marvellous</span></a></h4>

<p>There are strange things lost and forgotten in obscure corners of
the newspaper. I often think that the most extraordinary item of
intelligence that I have read in print appeared a few years ago in
the London press. It came from a well-known and most respected news
agency; I imagine it was in all the papers. It was astounding.</p>

<p>The circumstances necessary&mdash;not to the understanding of this
paragraph, for that is out of the question&mdash;but, we will say, to
the understanding of the events which made it possible, are these. We
had invaded Tibet, and there had been trouble in the hierarchy of
that country, and a personage known as the Tashi Lama had taken
refuge with us in India. He went on pilgrimage from one Buddhist
shrine to another, and came at last to a holy mountain of Buddhism,
the name of which I have forgotten. And thus the morning paper:</p>

<p>"His Holiness the Tashi Lama then ascended the Mountain and was
transfigured&mdash;Reuter."</p>

<p>That was all. And from that day to this I have never heard a word
of explanation or comment on this amazing statement.</p>

<p>There was no more, it seemed, to be said. "Reuter," apparently,
thought he had made his simple statement of the facts of the case,
had thereby done his duty, and so it all ended. Nobody, so far as I
know, ever wrote to any paper asking what Reuter meant by it, or what
the Tashi Lama meant by it. I suppose the fact was that nobody cared
twopence about the matter; and so this strange event&mdash;if there
were any such event&mdash;was exhibited to us for a moment, and the
lantern show revolved to other spectacles.</p>

<p>This is an extreme instance of the manner in which the marvelous
is flashed out to us and then withdrawn behind its black veils and
concealments; but I have known of other cases. Now and again, at
intervals of a few years, there appear in the newspapers strange
stories of the strange doings of what are technically called
<i>poltergeists</i>. Some house, often a lonely farm, is suddenly
subjected to an infernal bombardment. Great stones crash through the
windows, thunder down the chimneys, impelled by no visible hand. The
plates and cups and saucers are whirled from the dresser into the
middle of the kitchen, no one can say how or by what agency. Upstairs
the big bedstead and an old chest or two are heard bounding on the
floor as if in a mad ballet. Now and then such doings as these excite
a whole neighbourhood; sometimes a London paper sends a man down to
make an investigation. He writes half a column of description on the
Monday, a couple of paragraphs on the Tuesday, and then returns to
town. Nothing has been explained, the matter vanishes away; and
nobody cares. The tale trickles for a day or two through the press,
and then instantly disappears, like an Australian stream, into the
bowels of darkness. It is possible, I suppose, that this singular
incuriousness as to marvellous events and reports is not wholly
unaccountable. It may be that the events in question are, as it were,
psychic accidents and misadventures. They are not meant to happen,
or, rather, to be manifested. They belong to the world on the other
side of the dark curtain; and it is only by some queer mischance that
a corner of that curtain is twitched aside for an instant.
Then&mdash;for an instant&mdash; we see; but the personages whom Mr.
Kipling calls the Lords of Life and Death take care that we do not
see too much. Our business is with things higher and things lower,
with things different, anyhow; and on the whole we are not suffered
to distract ourselves with that which does not really concern us. The
transfiguration of the Lama and the tricks of the <i>poltergeist</i>
are evidently no affairs of ours; we raise an uninterested eyebrow
and pass on&mdash;to poetry or to statistics.</p>

<p>Be it noted; I am not professing any fervent personal belief in
the reports to which I have alluded. For all I know, the Lama, in
spite of Reuter, was not transfigured, and the <i>poltergeist</i>, in
spite of the late Mr. Andrew Lang, may in reality be only mischievous
Polly, the servant girl at the farm. And to go farther: I do not know
that I should be justified in putting either of these cases of the
marvellous in line with a chance paragraph that caught my eye last
summer; for this had not, on the face of it at all events, anything
wildly out of the common. Indeed, I dare say that I should not have
read it, should not have seen it, if it had not contained the name of
a place which I had once visited, which had then moved me in an odd
manner that I could not understand. Indeed, I am sure that this
particular paragraph deserves to stand alone, for even if the
<i>poltergeist</i> be a real <i>poltergeist</i>, it merely reveals
the psychic whimsicality of some region that is not our region. There
were better things and more relevant things behind the few lines
dealing with Llantrisant, the little town by the sea in
Arfonshire.</p>

<p>Not on the surface, I must say, for the cutting&mdash;I have
preserved it&mdash;reads as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Llantrisant</span>.&mdash;The season promises
very favourably: temperature of the sea yesterday at noon, 65 deg.
Remarkable occurrences are supposed to have taken place during the
recent Revival. The lights have not been observed lately. The Crown.
The Fisherman's Rest."</p>

<p>The style was odd certainly; knowing a little of newspapers, I
could see that the figure called, I think, <i>tmesis,</i> or cutting,
had been generously employed; the exuberances of the local
correspondent had been pruned by a Fleet Street expert. And these
poor men are often hurried; but what did those "lights" mean? What
strange matters had the vehement blue pencil blotted out and brought
to naught?</p>

<p>That was my first thought, and then, thinking still of Llantrisant
and how I had first discovered it and found it strange, I read the
paragraph again, and was saddened almost to see, as I thought, the
obvious explanation. I had forgotten for the moment that it was
war-time, that scares and rumours and terrors about traitorous
signals and flashing lights were current everywhere by land and sea;
someone, no doubt, had been watching innocent farmhouse windows and
thoughtless fan-lights of lodging-houses; these were the "lights"
that had not been observed lately.</p>

<p>I found out afterwards that the Llantrisant correspondent had no
treasonous lights in his mind, but something very different. Still;
what do we know? He may have been mistaken, "the great rose of fire"
that came over the deep may have been the port light of a
coasting-ship. Did it shine at last from the old chapel on the
headland? Possibly; or possibly it was the doctor's lamp at Sarnau,
some miles away. I have had wonderful opportunities lately of
analysing the marvels of lying, conscious and unconscious: and indeed
almost incredible feats in this way can be performed. If I incline to
the less likely explanation of the "lights" at Llantrisant, it is
merely because this explanation seems to me to be altogether
congruous with the "remarkable occurrences" of the newspaper
paragraph.</p>

<p>After all, if rumour and gossip and hearsay are crazy things to be
utterly neglected and laid aside; on the other hand, evidence is
evidence, and when a couple of reputable surgeons assert, as they do
assert in the case of Olwen Phillips, Croeswen, Llantrisant, that
there has been a "kind of resurrection of the body," it is merely
foolish to say that these things don't happen. The girl was a mass of
tuberculosis, she was within a few hours of death; she is now full of
life. And so, I do not believe that the rose of fire was merely a
ship's light, magnified and transformed by dreaming Welsh
sailors.</p>

<p>But now I am going forward too fast. I have not dated the
paragraph, so I cannot give the exact day of its appearance, but I
think it was somewhere between the second and third week of June. I
cut it out partly because it was about Llantrisant, partly because of
the "remarkable occurrences". I have an appetite for these matters,
though I also have this misfortune, that I require evidence before I
am ready to credit them, and I have a sort of lingering hope that
some day I shall be able to elaborate some scheme or theory of such
things.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, as a temporary measure, I hold what I call
the doctrine of the jig-saw puzzle. That is: this remarkable
occurrence, and that, and the other may be, and usually are, of no
significance. Coincidence and chance and unsearchable causes will now
and again make clouds that are undeniable fiery dragons, and potatoes
that resemble eminent statesmen exactly and minutely in every
feature, and rocks that are like eagles and lions. All this is
nothing; it is when you get your set of odd shapes and find that they
fit into one another, and at last that they are but parts of a large
design; it is then that research grows interesting and indeed
amazing, it is then that one queer form confirms the other, that the
whole plan displayed justifies, corroborates, explains each separate
piece.</p>

<p>So; it was within a week or ten days after I had read the
paragraph about Llantrisant and had cut it out that I got a letter
from a friend who was taking an early holiday in those regions.</p>

<p>"You will be interested," he wrote, "to hear that they have taken
to ritualistic practices at Llantrisant. I went into the church the
other day, and instead of smelling like a damp vault as usual, it was
positively reeking with incense."</p>

<p>I knew better than that. The old parson was a firm Evangelical; he
would rather have burnt sulphur in his church than incense any day.
So I could not make out this report at all; and went down to Arfon a
few weeks later determined to investigate this and any other
remarkable occurrence at Llantrisant.</p>

<h4 align="center"><a name="14_2"><span class="smcap">ii<br>
Odours of Paradise</span></a></h4>

<p>I went down to Arfon in the very heat and bloom and fragrance of
the wonderful summer that they were enjoying there. In London there
was no such weather: it rather seemed as if the horror and fury of
the war had mounted to the very skies and were there reigning. In the
mornings the sun burnt down upon the city with a heat that scorched
and consumed; but then clouds heavy and horrible would roll together
from all quarters of the heavens, and early in the afternoon the air
would darken, and a storm of thunder and lightning, and furious,
hissing rain would fall upon the streets. Indeed, the torment of the
world was in the London weather. The city wore a terrible vesture;
within our hearts was dread; without we were clothed in black clouds
and angry fire.</p>

<p>It is certain that I cannot show in any words the utter peace of
that Welsh coast to which I came; one sees, I think, in such a change
a figure of the passage from the disquiets and the fears of earth to
the peace of paradise. A land that seemed to be in a holy, happy
dream, a sea that changed all the while from olivine to emerald, from
emerald to sapphire, from sapphire to amethyst, that washed in white
foam at the bases of the firm, grey rocks, and about the huge crimson
bastions that hid the western bays and inlets of the waters; to this
land I came, and to hollows that were purple and odorous with wild
thyme, wonderful with many tiny, exquisite flowers. There was
benediction in centaury, pardon in eyebright, joy in lady's slipper;
and so the weary eyes were refreshed, looking now at the little
flowers and the happy bees about them, now on the magic mirror of the
deep, changing from marvel to marvel with the passing of the great
white clouds, with the brightening of the sun. And the ears, torn
with jangle and racket and idle, empty noise, were soothed and
comforted by the ineffable, unutterable, unceasing murmur, as the
tides swarm to and fro, uttering mighty, hollow voices in the caverns
of the rocks.</p>

<p>For three or four days I rested in the sun and smelt the savour of
the blossoms and of the salt water, and then, refreshed, I remembered
that there was something queer about Llantrisant that I might as well
investigate. It was no great thing that I thought to find, for, it
will be remembered, I had ruled out the apparent oddity of the
reporter's&mdash;or commissioner's?&mdash;reference to lights, on the
ground that he must have been referring to some local panic about
signalling to the enemy; who had certainly torpedoed a ship or two
off Lundy in the Bristol Channel. All that I had to go upon was the
reference to the "remarkable occurrences" at some revival, and then
that letter of Jackson's which spoke of Llantrisant church as
"reeking" with incense, a wholly incredible and impossible state of
things. Why, old Mr. Evans, the rector, looked upon coloured stoles
as the very robe of Satan and his angels, as things dear to the heart
of the Pope of Rome. But as to incense! As I have already familiarly
observed, I knew better.</p>

<p>But as a hard matter of fact, this may be worth noting: when I
went over to Llantrisant on Monday, August 9th, I visited the church,
and it was still fragrant and exquisite with the odour of rare gums
that had fumed there.</p>

<p>Now I happened to have a slight acquaintance with the rector. He
was a most courteous and delightful old man, and on my last visit he
had come across me in the churchyard, as I was admiring the very fine
Celtic cross that stands there. Besides the beauty of the interlaced
ornament there is an inscription in Ogham on one of the edges,
concerning which the learned dispute; it is altogether one of the
more famous crosses of Celtdom. Mr. Evans, I say, seeing me looking
at the cross, came up and began to give me, the stranger, a
r&eacute;sum&eacute;&mdash;somewhat of a shaky and uncertain
r&eacute;sum&eacute;, I found afterwards&mdash;of the various debates
and questions that had arisen as to the exact meaning of the
inscription, and I was amused to detect an evident but underlying
belief of his own: that the supposed Ogham characters were, in fact,
due to boys' mischief and weather and the passing of the ages. But
then I happened to put a question as to the sort of stone of which
the cross was made, and the rector brightened amazingly. He began to
talk geology, and, I think, demonstrated that the cross or the
material for it must have been brought to Llantrisant from the
south-west coast of Ireland. This struck me as interesting, because
it was curious evidence of the migrations of the Celtic saints, whom
the rector, I was delighted to find, looked upon as good Protestants,
though shaky on the subject of crosses; and so, with concessions on
my part, we got on very well. Thus, with all this to the good, I was
emboldened to call upon him.</p>

<p>I found him altered. Not that he was aged; indeed, he was rather
made young, with a singular brightening upon his face, and something
of joy upon it that I had not seen before, that I have seen on very
few faces of men. We talked of the war, of course, since that is not
to be avoided; of the farming prospects of the country; of general
things, till I ventured to remark that I had been in the church, and
had been surprised to find it perfumed with incense.</p>

<p>"You have made some alterations in the service since I was here
last? You use incense now?"</p>

<p>The old man looked at me strangely, and hesitated.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "there has been no change. I use no incense in the
church. I should not venture to do so."</p>

<p>"But," I was beginning, "the whole church is as if High Mass had
just been sung there, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He cut me short, and there was a certain grave solemnity in his
manner that struck me almost with awe.</p>

<p>"I know you are a railer," he said, and the phrase coming from
this mild old gentleman astonished me unutterably. "You are a railer
and a bitter railer; I have read articles that you have written, and
I know your contempt and your hatred for those you call Protestants
in your derision; though your grandfather, the vicar of
Caerleon-on-Usk, called himself Protestant and was proud of it, and
your great-grand-uncle Hezekiah, <i>ffeiriad coch yr
Castletown</i>&mdash;the Red Priest of Castletown&mdash;was a great
man with the Methodists in his day, and the people flocked by their
thousands when he administered the Sacrament. I was born and brought
up in Glamorganshire, and old men have wept as they told me of the
weeping and contrition that there was when the Red Priest broke the
Bread and raised the Cup. But you are a railer, and see nothing but
the outside and the show. You are not worthy of this mystery that has
been done here."</p>

<p>I went out from his presence rebuked indeed, and justly rebuked;
but rather amazed. It is curiously true that the Welsh are still one
people, one family almost, in a manner that the English cannot
understand, but I had never thought that this old clergyman would
have known anything of my ancestry or their doings. And as for my
articles and suchlike, I knew that the country clergy sometimes read,
but I had fancied my pronouncements sufficiently obscure, even in
London, much more in Arfon.</p>

<p>But so it happened, and so I had no explanation from the rector of
Llantrisant of the strange circumstance, that his church was full of
incense and odours of paradise.</p>

<p>I went up and down the ways of Llantrisant wondering, and came to
the harbour, which is a little place, with little quays where some
small coasting trade still lingers. A brigantine was at anchor here,
and very lazily in the sunshine they were loading it with anthracite;
for it is one of the oddities of Llantrisant that there is a small
colliery in the heart of the wood on the hillside. I crossed a
causeway which parts the outer harbour from the inner harbour, and
settled down on a rock beach hidden under a leafy hill. The tide was
going out, and some children were playing on the wet sand, while two
ladies&mdash;their mothers, I suppose&mdash;talked together as they
sat comfortably on their rugs at a little distance from me.</p>

<p>At first they talked of the war, and I made myself deaf, for of
that talk one gets enough, and more than enough, in London. Then
there was a period of silence, and the conversation had passed to
quite a different topic when I caught the thread of it again. I was
sitting on the further side of a big rock, and I do not think that
the two ladies had noticed my approach. However, though they spoke of
strange things, they spoke of nothing which made it necessary for me
to announce my presence.</p>

<p>"And, after all," one of them was saying, "what is it all about? I
can't make out what is come to the people."</p>

<p>This speaker was a Welshwoman; I recognized the clear,
overemphasized consonants, and a faint suggestion of an accent. Her
friend came from the Midlands, and it turned out that they had only
known each other for a few days. Theirs was a friendship of the beach
and of bathing; such friendships are common at small seaside
places.</p>

<p>"There is certainly something odd about the people here. I have
never been to Llantrisant before, you know; indeed, this is the first
time we've been in Wales for our holidays, and knowing nothing about
the ways of the people and not being accustomed to hear Welsh spoken,
I thought, perhaps, it must be my imagination. But you think there
really is something a little queer?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you this: that I have been in two minds whether I
should not write to my husband and ask him to take me and the
children away. You know where I am at Mrs. Morgan's, and the Morgans'
sitting-room is just the other side of the passage, and sometimes
they leave the door open, so that I can hear what they say quite
plainly. And you see I understand the Welsh, though they don't know
it. And I hear them saying the most alarming things!"</p>

<p>"What sort of things?"</p>

<p>"Well, indeed, it sounds like some kind of a religious service,
but it's not Church of England, I know that. Old Morgan begins it,
and the wife and children answer. Something like: 'Blessed be God for
the messengers of Paradise.' 'Blessed be His Name for Paradise in the
meat and in the drink.' 'Thanksgiving for the old offering.'
'Thanksgiving for the appearance of the old altar.' 'Praise for the
joy of the ancient garden.' 'Praise for the return of those that have
been long absent.' And all that sort of thing. It is nothing but
madness."</p>

<p>"Depend upon it," said the lady from the Midlands, "there's no
real harm in it. They're Dissenters; some new sect, I dare say. You
know some Dissenters are very queer in their ways."</p>

<p>"All that is like no Dissenters that I have ever known in all my
life whatever," replied the Welsh lady somewhat vehemently, with a
very distinct intonation of the land. "And have you heard them speak
of the bright light that shone at midnight from the church?"</p>

<h4 align="center"><a name="14_3"><span class="smcap">iii<br>
A Secret in a Secret Place</span></a></h4>

<p>Now here was I altogether at a loss and quite bewildered. The
children broke into the conversation of the two ladies and cut it
short, just as the midnight lights from the church came on the field,
and when the little girls and boys went back again to the sands
whooping, the tide of talk had turned, and Mrs. Harland and Mrs.
Williams were quite safe and at home with Janey's measles, and a
wonderful treatment for infantile earache, as exemplified in the case
of Trevor. There was no more to be got out of them, evidently, so I
left the beach, crossed the harbour causeway, and drank beer at the
Fisherman's Rest till it was time to climb up two miles of deep lane
and catch the train for Penvro, where I was staying. And I went up
the lane, as I say, in a kind of amazement; and not so much, I think,
because of evidences and hints of things strange to the senses, such
as the savour of incense where no incense had smoked for three
hundred and fifty years and more, or the story of bright light
shining from the dark, closed church at dead of night, as because of
that sentence of thanksgiving "for paradise in meat and in
drink."</p>

<p>For the sun went down and the evening fell as I climbed the long
hill through the deep woods and the high meadows, and the scent of
all the green things rose from the earth and from the heart of the
wood, and at a turn of the lane far below was the misty glimmer of
the still sea, and from far below its deep murmur sounded as it
washed on the little hidden, enclosed bay where Llantrisant stands.
And I thought, if there be paradise in meat and in drink, so much the
more is there paradise in the scent of the green leaves at evening
and in the appearance of the sea and in the redness of the sky; and
there came to me a certain vision of a real world about us all the
while, of a language that was only secret because we would not take
the trouble to listen to it and discern it.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when I got to the station, and here were the
few feeble oil lamps lit, glimmering in that lonely land, where the
way is long from farm to farm. The train came on its way, and I got
into it; and just as we moved from the station I noticed a group
under one of those dim lamps. A woman and her child had got out, and
they were being welcomed by a man who had been waiting for them. I
had not noticed his face as I stood on the platform, but now I saw it
as he pointed down the hill towards Llantrisant, and I think I was
almost frightened.</p>

<p>He was a young man, a farmer's son, I would say, dressed in rough
brown clothes, and as different from old Mr. Evans, the rector, as
one man might be from another. But on his face, as I saw it in the
lamp-light, there was the like brightening that I had seen on the
face of the rector. It was an illuminated face, glowing with an
ineffable joy, and I thought it rather gave light to the platform
lamp than received light from it. The woman and her child, I
inferred, were strangers to the place, and had come to pay a visit to
the young man's family. They had looked about them in bewilderment,
half alarmed, before they saw him; and then his face was radiant in
their sight, and it was easy to see that all their troubles were
ended and over. A wayside station and a darkening country; and it was
as if they were welcomed by shining, immortal gladness&mdash;even
into paradise.</p>

<p>But though there seemed in a sense light all about my ways, I was
myself still quite bewildered. I could see, indeed, that something
strange had happened or was happening in the little town hidden under
the hill, but there was so far no clue to the mystery, or rather, the
clue had been offered to me, and I had not taken it, I had not even
known that it was there; since we do not so much as see what we have
determined, without judging, to be incredible, even though it be held
up before our eyes. The dialogue that the Welsh Mrs. Williams had
reported to her English friend might have set me on the right way;
but the right way was outside all my limits of possibility, outside
the circle of my thought. The pal&aelig;ontologist might see
monstrous, significant marks in the slime of a river bank, but he
would never draw the conclusions that his own peculiar science would
seem to suggest to him; he would choose any explanation rather than
the obvious, since the obvious would also be the
outrageous&mdash;according to our established habit of thought, which
we deem final.</p>

<p>The next day I took all these strange things with me for
consideration to a certain place that I knew of not far from Penvro.
I was now in the early stages of the jig-saw process, or rather I had
only a few pieces before me, and&mdash;to continue the
figure&mdash;my difficulty was this: that though the markings on each
piece seemed to have design and significance, yet I could not make
the wildest guess as to the nature of the whole picture, of which
these were the parts. I had clearly seen that there was a great
secret; I had seen that on the face of the young farmer on the
platform of Llantrisant station; and in my mind there was all the
while the picture of him going down the dark, steep, winding lane
that led to the town and the sea, going down through the heart of the
wood, with light about him.</p>

<p>But there was bewilderment in the thought of this, and in the
endeavour to match it with the perfumed church and the scraps of talk
that I had heard and the rumour of midnight brightness; and though
Penvro is by no means populous, I thought I would go to a certain
solitary place called the Old Camp Head, which looks towards Cornwall
and to the great deeps that roll beyond Cornwall to the far ends of
the world; a place where fragments of dreams&mdash;they seemed such
then&mdash;might, perhaps, be gathered into the clearness of
vision.</p>

<p>It was some years since I had been to the Head, and I had gone on
that last time and on a former visit by the cliffs, a rough and
difficult path. Now I chose a landward way, which the county map
seemed to justify, though doubtfully, as regarded the last part of
the journey. So, I went inland and climbed the hot summer by-roads,
till I came at last to a lane which gradually turned turfy and
grass-grown, and then on high ground, ceased to be. It left me at a
gate in a hedge of old thorns; and across the field beyond there
seemed to be some faint indications of a track. One would judge that
sometimes men did pass by that way, but not often.</p>

<p>It was high ground but not within sight of the sea. But the breath
of the sea blew about the hedge of thorns, and came with a keen
savour to the nostrils. The ground sloped gently from the gate and
then rose again to a ridge, where a white farmhouse stood all alone.
I passed by this farmhouse, threading an uncertain way, followed a
hedgerow doubtfully; and saw suddenly before me the Old Camp, and
beyond it the sapphire plain of waters and the mist where sea and sky
met. Steep from my feet the hill fell away, a land of gorse-blossom,
red-gold and mellow, of glorious purple heather. It fell into a
hollow that went down, shining with rich green bracken, to the
glimmering sea; and before me, and beyond the hollow rose a height of
turf, bastioned at the summit with the awful, age-old walls of the
Old Camp; green, rounded circumvallations, wall within wall,
tremendous, with their myriad years upon them.</p>

<p>Within these smoothed, green mounds, looking across the shining
and changing of the waters in the happy sunlight, I took out the
bread and cheese and beer that I had carried in a bag, and ate and
drank, and lit my pipe, and set myself to think over the enigmas of
Llantrisant. And I had scarcely done so when, a good deal to my
annoyance, a man came climbing up over the green ridges, and took up
his stand close by, and stared out to sea. He nodded to me, and began
with "Fine weather for the harvest" in the approved manner, and so
sat down and engaged me in a net of talk. He was of Wales, it seemed,
but from a different part of the country, and was staying for a few
days with relations&mdash;at the white farmhouse which I had passed
on my way. His tale of nothing flowed on to his pleasure and my pain,
till he fell suddenly on Llantrisant and its doings. I listened then
with wonder, and here is his tale condensed. Though it must be
clearly understood that the man's evidence was only second-hand; he
had heard it from his cousin, the farmer.</p>

<p>So, to be brief, it appeared that there had been a long feud at
Llantrisant between a local solicitor, Lewis Prothero (we will say),
and a farmer named James. There had been a quarrel about some trifle,
which had grown more and more bitter as the two parties forgot the
merits of the original dispute, and by some means or other, which I
could not well understand, the lawyer had got the small freeholder
"under his thumb." James, I think, had given a bill of sale in a bad
season, and Prothero had bought it up; and the end was that the
farmer was turned out of the old house, and was lodging in a cottage.
People said he would have to take a place on his own farm as a
labourer; he went about in dreadful misery, piteous to see. It was
thought by some that he might very well murder the lawyer, if he met
him.</p>

<p>They did meet, in the middle of the market-place at Llantrisant
one Saturday in June. The farmer was a little black man, and he gave
a shout of rage, and the people were rushing at him to keep him off
Prothero.</p>

<p>"And then," said my informant, "I will tell you what happened.
This lawyer, as they tell me, he is a great big brawny fellow, with a
big jaw and a wide mouth, and a red face and red whiskers. And there
he was in his black coat and his high hard hat, and all his money at
his back, as you may say. And, indeed, he did fall down on his knees
in the dust there in the street in front of Philip James, and every
one could see that terror was upon him. And he did beg Philip James's
pardon, and beg of him to have mercy, and he did implore him by God
and man and the saints of paradise. And my cousin, John Jenkins,
Penmawr, he do tell me that the tears were falling from Lewis
Prothero's eyes like the rain. And he put his hand into his pocket
and drew out the deed of Pantyreos, Philip James's old farm that was,
and did give him the farm back and a hundred pounds for the stock
that was on it, and two hundred pounds, all in notes of the bank, for
amendment and consolation.</p>

<p>"And then, from what they do tell me, all the people did go mad,
crying and weeping and calling out all manner of things at the top of
their voices. And at last nothing would do but they must all go up to
the churchyard, and there Philip James and Lewis Prothero they swear
friendship to one another for a long age before the old cross, and
everyone sings praises. And my cousin he do declare to me that there
were men standing in that crowd that he did never see before in
Llantrisant in all his life, and his heart was shaken within him as
if it had been in a whirlwind."</p>

<p>I had listened to all this in silence. I said then:</p>

<p>"What does your cousin mean by that? Men that he had never seen in
Llantrisant? What men?"</p>

<p>"The people," he said very slowly, "call them the Fishermen."</p>

<p>And suddenly there came into my mind the "Rich Fisherman" who in
the old legend guards the holy mystery of the Graal.</p>

<h4 align="center"><a name="14_4"><span class="smcap">iv<br>
 The Ringing of the Bell</span></a></h4>

<p>So far I have not told the story of the things of Llantrisant, but
rather the story of how I stumbled upon them and among them,
perplexed and wholly astray, seeking, but yet not knowing at all what
I sought; bewildered now and again by circumstances which seemed to
me wholly inexplicable; devoid, not so much of the key to the enigma,
but of the key to the nature of the enigma. You cannot begin to solve
a puzzle till you know what the puzzle is about. "Yards divided by
minutes," said the mathematical master to me long ago, "will give
neither pigs, sheep, nor oxen." He was right; though his manner on
this and on all other occasions was highly offensive. This is enough
of the personal process, as I may call it; and here follows the story
of what happened at Llantrisant last summer, the story as I pieced it
together at last.</p>

<p>It all began, it appears, on a hot day, early in last June; so far
as I can make out, on the first Saturday in the month. There was a
deaf old woman, a Mrs. Parry, who lived by herself in a lonely
cottage a mile or so from the town. She came into the marketplace
early on the Saturday morning in a state of some excitement, and as
soon as she had taken up her usual place on the pavement by the
churchyard, with her ducks and eggs and a few very early potatoes,
she began to tell her neighbours about her having heard the sound of
a great bell. The good women on each side smiled at one another
behind Mrs. Parry's back, for one had to bawl into her ear before she
could make out what one meant; and Mrs. Williams, Penycoed, bent over
and yelled: "What bell should that be, Mrs. Parry? There's no church
near you up at Penrhiw. Do you hear what nonsense she talks?" said
Mrs. Williams in a low voice, to Mrs. Morgan. "As if she could hear
any bell, whatever."</p>

<p>"What makes you talk nonsense yourself?" said Mrs. Parry, to the
amazement of the two women. "I can hear a bell as well as you, Mrs.
Williams, and as well as your whispers either."</p>

<p>And there is the fact, which is not to be disputed; though the
deductions from it may be open to endless disputations; this old
woman who had been all but stone deaf for twenty years&mdash;the
defect had always been in her family&mdash;could suddenly hear on
this June morning as well as anybody else. And her two old friends
stared at her, and it was some time before they had appeased her
indignation, and induced her to talk about the bell.</p>

<p>It had happened in the early morning, which was very misty. She
had been gathering sage in her garden, high on a round hill looking
over the sea. And there came in her ears a sort of throbbing and
singing and trembling, "as if there were music coming out of the
earth," and then something seemed to break in her head, and all the
birds began to sing and make melody together, and the leaves of the
poplars round the garden fluttered in the breeze that rose from the
sea, and the cock crowed far off at Twyn, and the dog barked down in
Kemeys Valley. But above all these sounds, unheard for so many years,
there thrilled the deep and chanting note of the bell, "like a bell
and a man's voice singing at once."</p>

<p>They stared again at her and at one another. "Where did it sound
from?" asked one. "It came sailing across the sea," answered Mrs.
Parry quite composedly, "and I did hear it coming nearer and nearer
to the land."</p>

<p>"Well, indeed," said Mrs. Morgan, "it was a ship's bell then,
though I can't make out why they would be ringing like that."</p>

<p>"It was not ringing on any ship, Mrs. Morgan," said Mrs.
Parry.</p>

<p>"Then where do you think it was ringing?"</p>

<p>"Ym Mharadwys," replied Mrs. Parry. Now that means "in Paradise,"
and the two others changed the conversation quickly. They thought
that Mrs. Parry had got back her hearing suddenly&mdash;such things
did happen now and then&mdash;and that the shock had made her "a bit
queer." And this explanation would no doubt have stood its ground, if
it had not been for other experiences. Indeed, the local doctor (who
had treated Mrs. Parry for a dozen years, not for her deafness, which
he took to be hopeless and beyond cure, but for a tiresome and
recurrent winter cough), sent an account of the case to a colleague
at Bristol, suppressing, naturally enough, the reference to Paradise.
The Bristol physician gave it as his opinion that the symptoms were
absolutely what might have been expected. "You have here, in all
probability," he wrote, "the sudden breaking down of an old
obstruction in the aural passage, and I should quite expect this
process to be accompanied by tinnitus of a pronounced and even
violent character."</p>

<p>But for the other experiences? As the morning wore on and drew to
noon, high market, and to the utmost brightness of that summer day,
all the stalls and the streets were full of rumours and of awed
faces. Now from one lonely farm, now from another, men and women came
and told the story of how they had listened in the early morning with
thrilling hearts to the thrilling music of a bell that was like no
bell ever heard before. And it seemed that many people in the town
had been roused, they knew not how, from sleep; waking up, as one of
them said, as if bells were ringing and the organ playing, and a
choir of sweet voices singing all together: "There were such melodies
and songs that my heart was full of joy."</p>

<p>And a little past noon some fishermen who had been out all night
returned, and brought a wonderful story into the town of what they
had heard in the mist; and one of them said he had seen something go
by at a little distance from his boat. "It was all golden and
bright," he said, "and there was glory about it." Another fisherman
declared: "There was a song upon the water that was like heaven."</p>

<p>And here I would say in parenthesis that on returning to town I
sought out a very old friend of mine, a man who has devoted a
lifetime to strange and esoteric studies. I thought that I had a tale
that would interest him profoundly, but I found that he heard me with
a good deal of indifference. And at this very point of the sailors'
stories I remember saying: "Now what do you make of that? Don't you
think it's extremely curious?" He replied: "I hardly think so.
Possibly the sailors were lying; possibly it happened as they say.
Well; that sort of thing has always been happening." I gave my
friend's opinion; I make no comment on it.</p>

<p>Let it be noted that there was something remarkable as to the
manner in which the sound of the bell was heard&mdash;or supposed to
be heard. There are, no doubt, mysteries in sounds as in all else;
indeed, I am informed that during one of the horrible outrages that
have been perpetrated on London during this autumn there was an
instance of a great block of workmen's dwellings in which the only
person who heard the crash of a particular bomb falling was an old
deaf woman, who had been fast asleep till the moment of the
explosion. This is strange enough of a sound that was entirely in the
natural (and horrible) order; and so it was at Llantrisant, where the
sound was either a collective auditory hallucination or a
manifestation of what is conveniently, if inaccurately, called the
supernatural order.</p>

<p>For the thrill of the bell did not reach to all ears&mdash;or
hearts. Deaf Mrs. Parry heard it in her lonely cottage garden, high
above the misty sea; but then, in a farm on the other or western side
of Llantrisant, a little child, scarcely three years old, was the
only one out of a household of ten people who heard anything. He
called out in stammering baby Welsh something that sounded like
"Clychau fawr, clychau fawr"&mdash;the great bells, the great
bells&mdash;and his mother wondered what he was talking about. Of the
crews of half a dozen trawlers that were swinging from side to side
in the mist, not more than four men had any tale to tell. And so it
was that for an hour or two the men who had heard nothing suspected
his neighbour, who had heard marvels, of lying; and it was some time
before the mass of evidence coming from all manners of diverse and
remote quarters convinced the people that there was a true story
here. A might suspect B, his neighbour, of making up a tale; but when
C, from some place on the hills five miles away, and D, the fisherman
on the waters, each had a like report, then it was clear that
something had happened.</p>

<p>And even then, as they told me, the signs to be seen upon the
people were stranger than the tales told by them and among them. It
has struck me that many people in reading some of the phrases that I
have reported will dismiss them with laughter as very poor and
fantastic inventions; fishermen, they will say, do not speak of "a
song like heaven" or of "a glory about it." And I dare say this would
be a just enough criticism if I were reporting English fishermen;
but, odd though it may be, Wales has not yet lost the last shreds of
the grand manner. And let it be remembered also that in most cases
such phrases are translated from another language, that is, from the
Welsh.</p>

<p>So, they come trailing, let us say, fragments of the cloud of
glory in their common speech; and so, on this Saturday, they began to
display, uneasily enough in many cases, their consciousness that the
things that were reported were of their ancient right and former
custom. The comparison is not quite fair; but conceive Hardy's old
Durbeyfield suddenly waking from long slumber to find himself in a
noble thirteenth-century hall, waited on by kneeling pages, smiled on
by sweet ladies in silken c&ocirc;tehardies.</p>

<p>So by evening time there had come to the old people the
recollection of stories that their fathers had told them as they sat
round the hearth of winter nights, fifty, sixty, seventy years ago;
stories of the wonderful bell of Teilo Sant, that had sailed across
the glassy seas from Syon, that was called a portion of Paradise,
"and the sound of its ringing was like the perpetual choir of the
angels."</p>

<p>Such things were remembered by the old and told to the young that
evening, in the streets of the town and in the deep lanes that
climbed far hills. The sun went down to the mountain red with fire
like a burnt offering, the sky turned violet, the sea was purple, as
one told another of the wonder that had returned to the land after
long ages.</p>

<h4 align="center"><a name="14_5"><span class="smcap">v<br>
 The Rose of Fire</span></a></h4>

<p>It was during the next nine days, counting from that Saturday
early in June&mdash;the first Saturday in June, as I
believe&mdash;that Llantrisant and all the regions about became
possessed either by an extraordinary set of hallucinations or by a
visitation of great marvels.</p>

<p>This is not the place to strike the balance between the two
possibilities. The evidence is, no doubt, readily available; the
matter is open to systematic investigation.</p>

<p>But this may be said: The ordinary man, in the ordinary passages
of his life, accepts in the main the evidence of his senses, and is
entirely right in doing so. He says that he sees a cow, that he sees
a stone wall, and that the cow and the stone wall are "there." This
is very well for all the practical purposes of life, but I believe
that the metaphysicians are by no means so easily satisfied as to the
reality of the stone wall and the cow. Perhaps they might allow that
both objects are "there" in the sense that one's reflection is in a
glass; there is an actuality, but is there a reality external to
oneself? In any event, it is solidly agreed that, supposing a real
existence, this much is certain&mdash;it is not in the least like our
conception of it. The ant and the microscope will quickly convince us
that we do not see things as they really are, even supposing that we
see them at all. If we could "see" the real cow she would appear
utterly incredible, as incredible as the things I am to relate.</p>

<p>Now, there is nothing that I know much more unconvincing than the
stories of the red light on the sea. Several sailors, men on small
coasting ships, who were working up or down the Channel on the
Saturday night, spoke of "seeing" the red light, and it must be said
that there is a very tolerable agreement in their tales. All make the
time as between midnight of the Saturday and one o'clock on the
Sunday morning. Two of those sailormen are precise as to the time of
the apparition; they fix it by elaborate calculations of their own as
occurring at 12.20 a.m. And the story?</p>

<p>A red light, a burning spark seen far away in the darkness, taken
at the first moment of seeing for a signal, and probably an enemy
signal. Then it approached at a tremendous speed, and one man said he
took it be the port light of some new kind of navy motor boat which
was developing a rate hitherto unheard of, a hundred or a hundred and
fifty knots an hour. And then, in the third instant of the sight, it
was clear that this was no earthly speed. At first a red spark in the
farthest distance; then a rushing lamp; and then, as if in an
incredible point of time, it swelled into a vast rose of fire that
filled all the sea and all the sky and hid the stars and possessed
the land. "I thought the end of the world had come," one of the
sailors said.</p>

<p>And then, an instant more, and it was gone from them, and four of
them say that there was a red spark on Chapel Head, where the old
grey chapel of St. Teilo stands, high above the water, in a cleft of
the limestone rocks.</p>

<p>And thus the sailors; and thus their tales are incredible; but
<i>they</i> are not incredible. I believe that men of the highest
eminence in physical science have testified to the occurrence of
phenomena every whit as marvellous, to things as absolutely opposed
to all natural order, as we conceive it; and it may be said that
nobody minds them. "That sort of thing has always been happening," as
my friend remarked to me. But the men, whether or no the fire had
ever been without them, there was no doubt that it was now within
them, for it burned in their eyes. They were purged as if they had
passed through the Furnace of the Sages governed with Wisdom that the
alchemists know. They spoke without much difficulty of what they had
seen, or had seemed to see, with their eyes, but hardly at all of
what their hearts had known when for a moment the glory of the fiery
rose had been about them.</p>

<p>For some weeks, afterwards, they were still, as it were, amazed;
almost, I would say, incredulous. If there had been nothing more than
the splendid and fiery appearance, showing and vanishing, I do
believe that they themselves would have discredited their own senses
and denied the truth of their own tales. And one does not dare to say
whether they would not have been right. Men like Sir William Crookes
and Sir Oliver Lodge are certainly to be heard with respect, and they
bear witness to all manner of apparent eversions of laws which we, or
most of us, consider far more deeply founded than the ancient hills.
They may be justified; but in our hearts we doubt. We cannot wholly
believe in inner sincerity that the solid table did rise, without
mechanical reason or cause, into the air, and so defy that which we
name the "law of gravitation." I know what may be said on the other
side, I know that there is not true question of "law" in the case;
that the law of gravitation really means just this: that I have never
seen a table rising without mechanical aid, or an apple, detached
from the bough, soaring to the skies instead of falling to the
ground. The so-called law is just the sum of common observation and
nothing more; yet I say, in our hearts we do not believe that the
tables rise; much less do we believe in the rose of fire that for a
moment swallowed up the skies and seas and shores of the Welsh coast
last June.</p>

<p>And the men who saw it would have invented fairy tales to account
for it, I say again, if it had not been for that which was within
them.</p>

<p>They said, all of them and it was certain now that they spoke the
truth, that in the moment of the vision, every pain and ache and
malady in their bodies had passed away. One man had been vilely drunk
on venomous spirit, procured at Jobson's Hole down by the Cardiff
Docks. He was horribly ill; he had crawled up from his bunk for a
little fresh air; and in an instant his horrors and his deadly nausea
had left him. Another man was almost desperate with the raging
hammering pain of an abscess on a tooth; he says that when the red
flame came near he felt as if a dull, heavy blow had fallen on his
jaw, and then the pain was quite gone; he could scarcely believe that
there had been any pain there.</p>

<p>And they all bear witness to an extraordinary exaltation of the
senses. It is indescribable, this; for they cannot describe it. They
are amazed, again; they do not in the least profess to know what
happened; but there is no more possibility of shaking their evidence
than there is a possibility of shaking the evidence of a man who says
that water is wet and fire hot.</p>

<p>"I felt a bit queer afterwards," said one of them, "and I steadied
myself by the mast, and I can't tell how I felt as I touched it. I
didn't know that touching a thing like a mast could be better than a
big drink when you're thirsty, or a soft pillow when you're
sleepy."</p>

<p>I heard other instances of this state of things, as I must vaguely
call it, since I do not know what else to call it. But I suppose we
can all agree that to the man in average health, the average impact
of the external world on his senses is a matter of indifference. The
average impact; a harsh scream, the bursting of a motor tire, any
violent assault on the aural nerves will annoy him, and he may say
"damn." Then, on the other hand, the man who is not "fit" will easily
be annoyed and irritated by someone pushing past him in a crowd, by
the ringing of a bell, by the sharp closing of a book.</p>

<p>But so far as I could judge from the talk of these sailors, the
average impact of the external world had become to them a fountain of
pleasure. Their nerves were on edge, but an edge to receive exquisite
sensuous impressions. The touch of the rough mast, for example; that
was a joy far greater than is the joy of fine silk to some luxurious
skins; they drank water and stared as if they had been <i>fins
gourmets</i> tasting an amazing wine; the creak and whine of their
ship on its slow way were as exquisite as the rhythm and song of a
Bach fugue to an amateur of music.</p>

<p>And then, within; these rough fellows have their quarrels and
strifes and variances and envyings like the rest of us; but that was
all over between them that had seen the rosy light; old enemies shook
hands heartily, and roared with laughter as they confessed one to
another what fools they had been.</p>

<p>"I can't say how it has happened or what has happened at all,"
said one, "but if you have all the world and the glory of it, how can
you fight for fivepence?"</p>

<p>The church of Llantrisant is a typical example of a Welsh parish
church, before the evil and horrible period of "restoration."</p>

<p>This lower world is a palace of lies, and of all foolish lies
there is none more insane than a certain vague fable about the
medi&aelig;val freemasons, a fable which somehow imposed itself upon
the cold intellect of Hallam the historian. The story is, in brief,
that throughout the Gothic period, at any rate, the art and craft of
church building were executed by wandering guilds of "freemasons,"
possessed of various secrets of building and adornment, which they
employed wherever they went. If this nonsense were true, the Gothic
of Cologne would be as the Gothic of Colne, and the Gothic of Arles
like to the Gothic of Abingdon. It is so grotesquely untrue that
almost every county, let alone every country, has its distinctive
style in Gothic architecture. Arfon is in the west of Wales; its
churches have marks and features which distinguish them from the
churches in the east of Wales.</p>

<p>The Llantrisant church has that primitive division between nave
and chancel which only very foolish people decline to recognize as
equivalent to the Oriental iconostasis and as the origin of the
Western rood-screen. A solid wall divided the church into two
portions; in the centre was a narrow opening with a rounded arch,
through which those who sat towards the middle of the church could
see the small, red-carpeted altar and the three roughly shaped lancet
windows above it.</p>

<p>The "reading pew" was on the outer side of this wall of partition,
and here the rector did his service, the choir being grouped in seats
about him. On the inner side were the pews of certain privileged
houses of the town and district.</p>

<p>On the Sunday morning the people were all in their accustomed
places, not without a certain exultation in their eyes, not without a
certain expectation of they knew not what. The bells stopped ringing,
the rector, in his old-fashioned, ample surplice, entered the
reading-desk, and gave out the hymn: "My God, and is Thy table
spread."</p>

<p>And, as the singing began, all the people who were in the pews
within the wall came out of them and streamed through the archway
into the nave. They took what places they could find up and down the
church, and the rest of the congregation looked at them in
amazement.</p>

<p>Nobody knew what had happened. Those whose seats were next to the
aisle tried to peer into the chancel, to see what had happened or
what was going on there. But somehow the light flamed so brightly
from the windows above the altar, those being the only windows in the
chancel, one small lancet in the south wall excepted, that no one
could see anything at all.</p>

<p>"It was as if a veil of gold adorned with jewels was hanging
there," one man said; and indeed there are a few odds and scraps of
old painted glass left in the eastern lancets.</p>

<p>But there were few in the church who did not hear now and again
voices speaking beyond the veil.</p>

<h4 align="center"><a name="14_6"><span class="smcap">vi<br>
 Olwen's Dream</span></a></h4>

<p>The well-to-do and dignifed personages who left their pews in the
chancel of Llantrisant church and came hurrying into the nave could
give no explanation of what they had done. They felt, they said, that
they "had to go," and to go quickly; they were driven out, as it
were, by a secret, irresistible command. But all who were present in
the church that morning were amazed, though all exulted in their
hearts; for they, like the sailors who saw the rose of fire on the
waters, were filled with a joy that was literally ineffable, since
they could not utter it or interpret it to themselves.</p>

<p>And they too, like the sailors, were transmuted, or the world was
transmuted for them. They experienced what the doctors call a sense
of <i>bien &ecirc;tre</i>, but a <i>bien &ecirc;tre</i> raised to the
highest power. Old men felt young again, eyes that had been growing
dim now saw clearly, and saw a world that was like Paradise, the same
world, it is true, but a world rectified and glowing, as if an inner
flame shone in all things, and behind all things.</p>

<p>And the difficulty in recording this state is this, that it is so
rare an experience that no set language to express it is in
existence. A shadow of its raptures and ecstasies is found in the
highest poetry; there are phrases in ancient books telling of the
Celtic saints that dimly hint at it; some of the old Italian masters
of painting had known it, for the light of it shines in their skies
and about the battlements of their cities that are founded on magic
hills. But these are but broken hints.</p>

<p>It is not poetic to go to Apothcaries' Hall for similes. But for
many years I kept by me an article from the <i>Lancet</i> or the
<i>British Medical Journal</i>&mdash;I forget which&mdash;in which a
doctor gave an account of certain experiments he had conducted with a
drug called the Mescal Button, or Anhelonium Lewinii. He said that
while under the influence of the drug he had but to shut his eyes,
and immediately before him there would rise incredible Gothic
cathedrals, of such majesty and splendour and glory that no heart had
ever conceived. They seemed to surge from the depths to the very
heights of heaven, their spires swayed amongst the clouds and the
stars, they were fretted with admirable imagery. And as he gazed, he
would presently become aware that all the stones were living stones,
that they were quickening and palpitating, and then that they were
glowing jewels, say, emeralds, sapphires, rubies, opals, but of hues
that the mortal eye had never seen.</p>

<p>That description gives, I think, some faint notion of the nature
of the transmuted world into which these people by the sea had
entered, a world quickened and glorified and full of pleasures. Joy
and wonder were on all faces; but the deepest joy and the greatest
wonder were on the face of the rector. For he had heard through the
veil the Greek word for "holy," three times repeated. And he, who had
once been a horrified assistant at High Mass in a foreign church,
recognized the perfume of incense that filled the place from end to
end.</p>

<p>It was on that Sunday night that Olwen Phillips of Croeswen
dreamed her wonderful dream. She was a girl of sixteen, the daughter
of small farming people, and for many months she had been doomed to
certain death. Consumption, which flourishes in that damp, warm
climate, had laid hold of her; not only her lungs but her whole
system was a mass of tuberculosis. As is common enough, she had
enjoyed many fallacious brief recoveries in the early stages of the
disease, but all hope had long been over, and now for the last few
weeks she had seemed to rush vehemently to death. The doctor had come
on the Saturday morning, bringing with him a colleague. They had both
agreed that the girl's case was in its last stages. "She cannot
possibly last more than a day or two," said the local doctor to her
mother. He came again on the Sunday morning and found his patient
perceptibly worse, and soon afterwards she sank into a heavy sleep,
and her mother thought that she would never wake from it.</p>

<p>The girl slept in an inner room communicating with the room
occupied by her father and mother. The door between was kept open, so
that Mrs. Phillips could hear her daughter if she called to her in
the night. And Olwen called to her mother that night, just as the
dawn was breaking. It was no faint summons from a dying bed that came
to the mother's ears, but a loud cry that rang through the house, a
cry of great gladness. Mrs. Phillips started up from sleep in wild
amazement, wondering what could have happened. And then she saw
Olwen, who had not been able to rise from her bed for many weeks
past, standing in the doorway in the faint light of the growing day.
The girl called to her mother: "Mam! mam! It is all over. I am quite
well again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Phillips roused her husband, and they sat up in bed staring,
not knowing on earth, as they said afterwards, what had been done
with the world. Here was their poor girl wasted to a shadow, lying on
her death-bed, and the life sighing from her with every breath, and
her voice, when she last uttered it, so weak that one had to put
one's ear to her mouth. And here in a few hours she stood up before
them; and even in that faint light they could see that she was
changed almost beyond knowing. And, indeed, Mrs. Phillips said that
for a moment or two she fancied that the Germans must have come and
killed them in their sleep, and so they were all dead together. But
Olwen called out again, so the mother lit a candle and got up and
went tottering across the room, and there was Olwen all gay and plump
again, smiling with shining eyes. Her mother led her into her own
room, and set down the candle there, and felt her daughter's flesh,
and burst into prayers, and tears of wonder and delight, and
thanksgivings, and held the girl again to be sure that she was not
deceived. And then Olwen told her dream, though she thought it was
not a dream.</p>

<p>She said she woke up in the deep darkness, and she knew the life
was fast going from her. She could not move so much as a finger, she
tried to cry out, but no sound came from her lips. She felt that in
another instant the whole world would fall from her&mdash;her heart
was full of agony. And as the last breath was passing her lips, she
heard a very faint, sweet sound, like the tinkling of a silver bell,
it came from far away, from over by Ty-newydd. She forgot her agony
and listened, and even then, she says, she felt the swirl of the
world as it came back to her. And the sound of the bell swelled and
grew louder, and it thrilled all through her body, and the life was
in it. And as the bell rang and trembled in her ears, a faint light
touched the wall of her room and reddened, till the whole room was
full of rosy fire. And then she saw standing before her bed three men
in blood-coloured robes with shining faces. And one man held a golden
bell in his hand. And the second man held up something shaped like
the top of a table. It was like a great jewel, and it was of a blue
colour, and there were rivers of silver and of gold running through
it and flowing as quick streams flow, and there were pools in it as
if violets had been poured out into water, and then it was green as
the sea near the shore, and then it was the sky at night with all the
stars shining, and then the sun and the moon came down and washed in
it. And the third man held up high above this a cup that was like a
rose on fire; "there was a great burning in it, and a dropping of
blood in it, and a red cloud above it, and I saw a great secret. And
I heard a voice that sang nine times: 'Glory and praise to the
Conqueror of Death, to the Fountain of Life immortal.' Then the red
light went from the wall, and it was all darkness, and the bell rang
faint again by Capel Teilo, and then I got up and called to you."</p>

<p>The doctor came on the Monday morning with the death certificate
in his pocket-book, and Olwen ran out to meet him. I have quoted his
phrase in the first chapter of this record: "A kind of resurrection
of the body." He made a most careful examination of the girl; he has
stated that he found that every trace of disease had disappeared. He
left on the Sunday morning a patient entering into the coma that
precedes death, a body condemned utterly and ready for the grave. He
met at the garden gate on the Monday morning a young woman in whom
life sprang up like a fountain, in whose body life laughed and
rejoiced as if it had been a river flowing from an unending well.</p>

<p>Now this is the place to ask one of those questions&mdash;there
are many such&mdash;which cannot be answered. The question is as to
the continuance of tradition; more especially as to the continuance
of tradition among the Welsh Celts of to-day. On the one hand, such
waves and storms have gone over them. The wave of the heathen Saxons
went over them, then the wave of Latin medi&aelig;valism, then the
waters of Anglicanism; last of all the flood of their queer
Calvinistic Methodism, half Puritan, half pagan. It may well be asked
whether any memory can possibly have survived such a series of
deluges. I have said that the old people of Llantrisant had their
tales of the bell of Teilo Sant; but these were but vague and broken
recollections. And then there is the name by which the "strangers"
who were seen in the marketplace were known; that is more precise.
Students of the Graal legend know that the keeper of the Graal in the
romances is the "King Fisherman", or the "Rich Fisherman"; students
of Celtic hagiology know that it was prophesied before the birth of
Dewi (or David) that he should be "a man of acquatic life," that
another legend tells how a little child, destined to be a saint, was
discovered on a stone in the river, how through his childhood a fish
for his nourishment was found on that stone every day, while another
saint, Ilar, if I remember, was expressly known as "The Fisherman".
But has the memory of all this persisted in the church-going and
chapel-going people of Wales at the present day? It is difficult to
say. There is the affair of the Healing Cup of Nant Eos, or Tregaron
Healing Cup, as it is also called. It is only a few years ago since
it was shown to a wandering harper, who treated it lightly, and then
spent a wretched night, as he said, and came back penitently and was
left alone with the sacred vessel to pray over it, till "his mind was
at rest." That was in 1887.</p>

<p>Then for my part&mdash;I only know modern Wales on the surface, I
am sorry to say&mdash;I remember three or four years ago speaking to
my temporary landlord of certain relics of Saint Teilo, which are
supposed to be in the keeping of a particular family in that country.
The landlord is a very jovial merry fellow, and I observed with some
astonishment that his ordinary, easy manner was completely altered as
he said, gravely, "That will be over there, up by the mountain,"
pointing vaguely to the north. And he changed the subject, as a
Freemason changes the subject.</p>

<p>There the matter lies, and its appositeness to the story of
Llantrisant is this: that the dream of Olwen Phillips was, in fact,
the vision of the Holy Graal.</p>

<h4 align="center"><a name="14_7"><span class="smcap">vii<br>
 The Mass of The Sangraal</span></a></h4>

<p><i>"Ffeiriadwyr Melcisidec! Ffeiriadwyr Melcisidec!"</i> shouted
the old Calvinistic Methodist deacon with the grey beard, "Priesthood
of Melchizedek! Priesthood of Melchizedek!"</p>

<p>And he went on:</p>

<p>"The Bell that is like <i>y glwys yr angel ym
mharadwys</i>&mdash;the joy of the angels in Paradise&mdash;is
returned; the Altar that is of a colour that no men can discern is
returned, the Cup that came from Syon is returned, the ancient
Offering is restored, the Three Saints have come back to the church
of the <i>tri sant</i>, the Three Holy Fishermen are amongst us, and
their net is full. <i>Gogoniant, gogoniant</i>&mdash;glory,
glory!"</p>

<p>Then another Methodist began to recite in Welsh a verse from
Wesley's hymn.</p>

<p class="poem">God still respects Thy sacrifice,<br>
 <span style="margin: 1em;">Its savour sweet doth always
please;</span><br>
The Offering smokes through earth and skies,<br>
<span style="margin: 1em;">Diffusing life and joy and
peace;</span><br>
To these Thy lower courts it comes<br>
And fills them with Divine perfumes.</p>

<p>The whole church was full, as the old books tell, of the odour of
the rarest spiceries. There were lights shining within the sanctuary,
through the narrow archway.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the end of what befell at Llantrisant.
For it was the Sunday after that night on which Olwen Phillips had
been restored from death to life. There was not a single chapel of
the Dissenters open in the town that day. The Methodists with their
minister and their deacons and all the Nonconformists had returned on
this Sunday morning to "the old hive." One would have said, a church
of the Middle Ages, a church in Ireland to-day. Every seat&mdash;save
those in the chancel&mdash;was full, all the aisles were full, the
churchyard was full; everyone on his knees, and the old rector
kneeling before the door into the holy place.</p>

<p>Yet they can say but very little of what was done beyond the veil.
There was no attempt to perform the usual service; when the bells had
stopped the old deacon raised his cry, and priest and people fell
down on their knees as they thought they heard a choir within singing
"Alleluya, alleluya, alleluya." And as the bells in the tower ceased
ringing, there sounded the thrill of the bell from Syon, and the
golden veil of sunlight fell across the door into the altar, and the
heavenly voices began their melodies.</p>

<p>A voice like a trumpet cried from within the brightness:</p>

<p><i>Agyos, Agyos, Agyos.</i></p>

<p>And the people, as if an age-old memory stirred in them,
replied:</p>

<p><i>Agyos yr T&acirc;d, agyos yr Mab, agyos yr Yspryd Glan. Sant,
sant, sant, Drindod sant vendigeid. Sanctus Arglwydd Dduw Sabaoth,
Dominus Deus.</i></p>

<p>There was a voice that cried and sang from within the altar; most
of the people had heard some faint echo of it in the chapels; a voice
rising and falling and soaring in awful modulations that rang like
the trumpet of the Last Angel. The people beat upon their breasts,
the tears were like rain of the mountains on their cheeks; those that
were able fell down on their faces before the glory of the veil. The
said afterwards that men of the hills, twenty miles away, heard that
cry and that singing, rushing upon them on the wind, and they fell
down on their faces, and cried: "The offering is accomplished,"
knowing nothing of what they said.</p>

<p>There were a few who saw three come out of the door of the
sanctuary, and stand for a moment on the pace before the door. These
three were in dyed vesture, red as blood. One stood before two,
looking to the west, and he rang the bell. And they say that all the
birds of the wood, and all the waters of the sea, and all the leaves
of the trees, and all the winds of the high rocks uttered their
voices with the ringing of the bell. And the second and the third;
they turned their faces one to another. The second held up the lost
altar that they once called <i>Sapphirus</i>, which was like the
changing of the sea and of the sky, and like the immixture of gold
and silver. And the third heaved up high over the altar a cup that
was red with burning and the blood of the offering.</p>

<p>And the old rector cried aloud then before the entrance:</p>

<p><i>Bendigeid yr Offeren yn oes oesoedd</i>&mdash;blessed be the
Offering unto the ages of ages.</p>

<p>And then the Mass of the Sangraal was ended, and then began the
passing out of that land of the holy persons and holy things that had
returned to it after the long years. It seemed, indeed, to many that
the thrilling sound of the bell was in their ears for days, even for
weeks after that Sunday morning. But thenceforth neither bell nor
altar nor cup was seen by anyone; not openly, that is, but only in
dreams by day and by night. Nor did the people see Strangers again in
the market of Llantrisant, nor in the lonely places where certain
persons oppressed by great affliction and sorrow had once or twice
encountered them.</p>

<p>But that time of visitation will never be forgotten by the people.
Many things happened in the nine days that have not been set down in
this record&mdash;or legend. Some of them were trifling matters,
though strange enough in other times. Thus a man in the town who had
a fierce dog that was always kept chained up found one day that the
beast had become mild and gentle.</p>

<p>And this is stranger: Edward Davies, of Lanafon, a farmer, was
roused from sleep one night by a queer yelping and barking in his
yard. He looked out of the window and saw his sheep-dog playing with
a big fox; they were chasing each other by turns, rolling over and
over one another, "cutting such capers as I did never see the like,"
as the astonished farmer put it. And some of the people said that
during this season of wonder the corn shot up, and the grass
thickened, and the fruit was multiplied on the trees in a very
marvellous manner.</p>

<p>More important, it seemed, was the case of Williams, the grocer;
though this may have been a purely natural deliverance. Mr. Williams
was to marry his daughter Mary to a smart young fellow from
Carmarthen, and he was in great distress over it. Not over the
marriage itself, but because things had been going very badly with
him for some time, and he could not see his way to giving anything
like the wedding entertainment that would be expected of him. The
wedding was to be on the Saturday&mdash;that was the day on which the
lawyer, Lewis Prothero, and the farmer, Philip James, were
reconciled&mdash;and this John Williams, without money or credit,
could not think how shame would not be on him for the meagerness and
poverty of the wedding feast.</p>

<p>And then on the Tuesday came a letter from his brother, David
Williams, Australia, from whom he had not heard for fifteen years.
And David it seemed, had been making a great deal of money, and was a
bachelor, and here was with his letter a paper good for a thousand
pounds: "You may as well enjoy it now as wait till I am dead." This
was enough, indeed, one might say; but hardly an hour after the
letter had come the lady from the big house (Plas Mawr) drove up in
all her grandeur, and went into the shop and said: "Mr. Williams,
your daughter Mary has always been a very good girl, and my husband
and I feel that we must give her some little thing on her wedding,
and we hope she'll be very happy." It was a gold watch worth fifteen
pounds. And after Lady Watcyn, advances the old doctor with a dozen
of port, forty years upon it, and a long sermon on how to decant it.
And the old rector's old wife brings to the beautiful dark girl two
yards of creamy lace, like an enchantment, for her wedding veil, and
tells Mary how she wore it for her own wedding fifty years ago; and
the squire, Sir Watcyn, as if his wife had not been already with a
fine gift, calls from his horse, and brings out Williams and barks
like a dog at him: "Goin' to have a weddin', eh, Williams? Can't have
a weddin' without champagne, y' know; wouldn't be legal, don't y'
know. So look out for a couple of cases." So Williams tells the story
of the gifts; and certainly there was never so famous a wedding in
Llantrisant before.</p>

<p>All this, of course, may have been altogether in the natural
order; the "glow," as they call it, seems more difficult to explain.
For they say that all through the nine days, and indeed after the
time had ended, there never was a man weary or sick at heart in
Llantrisant, or in the country round it. For a man felt that his work
of the body or the mind was going to be too much for his strength,
then there would come to him of a sudden a warm glow and a thrilling
all over him, and he felt as strong as a giant, and happier than he
had ever been in his life before, so that lawyer and hedger each
rejoiced in the task that was before him, as if it were sport and
play.</p>

<p>And, much more wonderful than this or any other wonders was
forgiveness, with love to follow it. There were meetings of old
enemies in the market-place and in the street that made the people
lift up their hands and declare that it was as if one walked the
miraculous streets of Syon.</p>

<p>But as to the "phenomena," the occurrences for which, in ordinary
talk, we should reserve the word "miraculous"? Well, what do we know?
The question that I have already stated comes up again, as to the
possible survival of old tradition in a kind of dormant, or torpid,
semi-conscious state. In other words, did the people "see" and "hear"
what they expected to see and hear? This point, or one similar to it,
occurred in a debate between Andrew Lang and Anatole France as to the
visions of Joan of Arc. M. France stated that when Joan saw St.
Michael, she saw the traditional archangel of the religious art of
her day, but to the best of my belief Andrew Lang proved that the
visionary figure Joan described was not in the least like the
fifteenth-century conception of St. Michael. So, in the case of
Llantrisant, I have stated that there was a sort of tradition about
the holy bell of Teilo Sant; and it is, of course, barely possible
that some vague notion of the Graal cup may have reached even Welsh
country folks through Tennyson's "Idylls."</p>

<p>But so far I see no reason to suppose that these people had ever
heard of the portable altar (called Sapphirus in William of
Malmesbury) or of its changing colours "that no man could
discern."</p>

<p>And then there are the other questions of the distinction between
hallucination and the vision, of the average duration of one and the
other, and of the possibility of collective hallucination. If a
number of people all see (or think they see) the same appearances,
can this be merely hallucination? I believe there is a leading case
on the matter, which concerns a number of people seeing the same
appearance on a church wall in Ireland; but there is, of course, this
difficulty, that one may be hallucinated and communicate his
impression to the others, telepathically.</p>

<p>But at the last, what do we know?</p>
