<br>

<p style="text-indent:0">I WILL tell you of Niord and the Worm. You
have heard the tale before in many guises wherein the hero was
named Tyr, or Perseus, or Siegfried, or Beowulf, or Saint George.
But it was Niord who met the loathly demoniac thing that crawled
hideously up from hell, and from which meeting sprang the cycle of
hero-tales that revolves down the ages until the very substance of
the truth is lost and passes into the limbo of all forgotten
legends. I know whereof I speak, for I was Niord.</p>

<p>As I lie here awaiting death, which creeps slowly upon me like a
blind slug, my dreams are filled with glittering visions and the
pageantry of glory. It is not of the drab, disease-racked life of
James Allison I dream, but all the gleaming figures of the mighty
pageantry that have passed before, and shall come after; for I have
faintly glimpsed, not merely the shapes that trail out behind, but
shapes that come after, as a man in a long parade glimpses, far
ahead, the line of figures that precede him winding over a distant
hill, etched shadow like against the sky. I am one and all the
pageantry of shapes and guises and masks which have been, are, and
shall be the visible manifestations of that illusive, intangible,
but vitally existent spirit now promenading under the brief and
temporary name of James Allison.</p>

<p>Each man on earth, each woman, is part and all of a similar
caravan of shapes and beings. But they can not remember&mdash;their
minds can not bridge the brief, awful gulfs of blackness which lie
between those unstable shapes, and which the spirit, soul or ego,
in spanning, shakes off its fleshy masks. I remember. Why I can
remember is the strangest tale of all; but as I lie here with
death's black wings slowly unfolding over me, all the dim folds of
my previous lives are shaken out before my eyes, and I see myself
in many forms and guises&mdash;braggart, swaggering, fearful,
loving, foolish, all that men&mdash;have been or will be.</p>

<p>I have been Man in many lands and many conditions; yet&mdash;and
here is another strange thing&mdash;my line of reincarnation runs
straight down one unerring channel. I have never been any but a man
of that restless race men once called Nordheimr and later Aryans,
and today name by many names and designations. Their history is my
history, from the first mewling wail of a hairless white ape cub in
the wastes of the arctic, to the death-cry of the last degenerate
product of ultimate civilization, in some dim and unguessed future
age.</p>

<p>My name has been Hialmar, Tyr, Bragi, Bran, Horsa, Eric, and
John. I strode red-handed through the deserted streets of Rome
behind the yellow-maned Brennus; I wandered through the violated
plantations with Alaric and his Goths when the flame of burning
villas lit the land like day and an empire was gasping its last
under our sandalled feet; I waded sword in hand through the foaming
surf from Hengist's galley to lay the foundations of England in
blood and pillage; when Leif the Lucky sighted the broad white
beaches of an unguessed world, I stood beside him in the bows of
the dragonship, my golden beard blowing in the wind; and when
Godfrey of Bouillon led his Crusaders over the walls of Jerusalem,
I was among them in steel cap and brigandine.</p>

<p>But it is of none of these things I would speak. I would take
you back with me into an age beside which that of Brennus and Rome
is as yesterday. I would take you back through, not merely
centuries and millenniums, but epochs and dim ages unguessed by the
wildest philosopher. Oh far, far and far will you fare into the
nighted Past before you win beyond the boundaries of my race,
blue-eyed, yellow-haired, wanderers, slayers, lovers, mighty in
rapine and wayfaring.</p>

<p>It is the adventure of Niord Worm's-bane of which I
speak&mdash;the root-stem of a whole cycle of hero-tales which has
not yet reached its end, the grisly underlying reality that lurks
behind time-distorted myths of dragons, fiends and monsters.</p>

<p>Yet it is not alone with the mouth of Niord that I will speak. I
am James Allison no less than I was Niord, and as I unfold the
tale, I will interpret some of his thoughts and dreams and deeds
from the mouth of the modern I, so that the saga of Niord shall not
be a meaningless chaos to you. His blood is your blood, who are
sons of Aryan; but wide misty gulfs of eons lie horrifically
between, and the deeds and dreams of Niord seem as alien to your
deeds and dreams as the primordial and lion-haunted forest seems
alien to the white-walled city street.</p>

<p>It was a strange world in which Niord lived and loved and
fought, so long ago that even my eon-spanning memory can not
recognize landmarks. Since then the surface of the earth has
changed, not once but a score of times; continents have risen and
sunk, seas have changed their beds and rivers their courses,
glaciers have waxed and waned, and the very stars and
constellations have altered and shifted.</p>

<p>It was so long ago that the cradle-land of my race was still in
Nordheim. But the epic drifts of my people had already begun, and
blue-eyed, yellow-maned tribes flowed eastward and southward and
westward, on century-long treks that carried them around the world
and left their bones and their traces in strange lands and wild
waste places. On one of these drifts I grew from infancy to
manhood. My knowledge of that northern homeland was dim memories,
like half-remembered dreams, of blinding white snow plains and ice
fields, of great fires roaring in the circle of hide tents, of
yellow manes flying in great winds, and a sun setting in a lurid
wallow of crimson clouds, blazing on trampled snow where still dark
forms lay in pools that were redder than the sunset.</p>

<p>That last memory stands out clearer than the others. It was the
field of Jotunheim, I was told in later years, whereon had just
been fought that terrible battle which was the Armageddon of the
Esirfolk, the subject of a cycle of hero-songs for long ages, and
which still lives today in dim dreams of Ragnarok and
Goetterdaemmerung. I looked on that battle as a mewling infant; so
I must have lived about&mdash;but I will not name the age, for I
would be called a madman, and historians and geologists alike would
rise to refute me.</p>

<p>But my memories of Nordheim were few and dim, paled by memories
of that long, long trek upon which I had spent my life. We had not
kept to a straight course, but our trend had been for ever
southward. Sometimes we had bided for a while in fertile upland
valleys or rich river&mdash;traversed plains, but always we took up
the trail again, and not always because of drouth or famine. Often
we left countries teeming with game and wild grain to push into
wastelands. On our trail we moved endlessly, driven only by our
restless whim, yet blindly following a cosmic law, the workings of
which we never guessed, any more than the wild geese guess in their
flights around the world. So at last we came into the Country of
the Worm.</p>

<p>I will take up the tale at the time when we came into
jungle-clad hills reeking with rot and teeming with spawning life,
where the tom-toms of a savage people pulsed incessantly through
the hot breathless night. These people came forth to dispute our
way&mdash;short, strongly built men, black-haired, painted,
ferocious, but indisputably white men. We knew their breed of old.
They were Picts, and of all alien races the fiercest. We had met
their kind before in thick forests, and in upland valleys beside
mountain lakes. But many moons had passed since those meetings.</p>

<p>I believe this particular tribe represented the easternmost
drift of the race. They were the most primitive and ferocious of
any I ever met. Already they were exhibiting hints of
characteristics I have noted among black savages in jungle
countries, though they had dwelt in these environs only a few
generations. The abysmal jungle was engulfing them, was
obliterating their pristine characteristics and shaping them in its
own horrific mold. They were drifting into head-hunting, and
cannibalism was but a step which I believe they must have taken
before they became extinct. These things are natural adjuncts to
the jungle; the Picts did not learn them from the black people, for
then there were no blacks among those hills. In later years they
came up from the south, and the Picts first enslaved and then were
absorbed by them. But with that my saga of Niord is not
concerned.</p>

<p>We came into that brutish hill country, with its squalling
abysms of savagery and black primitiveness. We were a whole tribe
marching on foot, old men, wolfish with their long beards and gaunt
limbs, giant warriors in their prime, naked children running along
the line of march, women with tousled yellow locks carrying babies
which never cried&mdash;unless it were to scream from pure rage. I
do not remember our numbers, except, that there were some five
hundred fighting-men&mdash;and by fighting-men I mean all males,
from the child just strong enough to lift a bow, to the oldest of
the old men. In that madly ferocious age all were fighters. Our
women fought, when brought to bay, like tigresses, and I have seen
a babe, not yet old enough to stammer articulate words, twist its
head and sink its tiny teeth in the foot that stamped out its
life.</p>

<p>Oh, we were fighters! Let me speak of Niord. I am proud of him,
the more when I consider the paltry crippled body of James Allison,
the unstable mask I now wear. Niord was tall, with great shoulders,
lean hips and mighty limbs. His muscles were long and swelling,
denoting endurance and speed as well as strength. He could run all
day without tiring, and he possessed a co-ordination that made his
movements a blur of blinding speed. If I told you his full
strength, you would brand me a liar. But there is no man on earth
today strong enough to bend the bow Niord handled with ease. The
longest arrow-flight on record is that of a Turkish archer who sent
a shaft 482 yards. There was not a stripling in my tribe who could
not have bettered that flight.</p>

<p>As we entered the jungle country we heard the tom-toms booming
across the mysterious valleys that slumbered between the brutish
hills, and in a broad, open plateau we met our enemies. I do not
believe these Picts knew us, even by legends, or they had never
rushed so openly to the onset, though they outnumbered us. But
there was no attempt at ambush. They swarmed out of the trees,
dancing and singing their war-songs, yelling their barbarous
threats. Our heads should hang in their idol-hut and our
yellow-haired women should bear their sons. Ho! ho! ho! By Ymir, it
was Niord who laughed then, not James Allison. Just so we of the
Æsir laughed to hear their threats &mdash; deep thunderous
laughter from broad and mighty chests. Our trail was laid in blood
and embers through many lands. We were the slayers and ravishers,
striding sword in hand across the world, and that these folk
threatened us woke our rugged humor.</p>

<p>We went to meet them, naked but for our wolfhides, swinging our
bronze swords, and our singing was like rolling thunder in the
hills. They sent their arrows among us, and we gave back their
fire. They could not match us in archery. Our arrows hissed in
blinding clouds among them, dropping them like autumn leaves, until
they howled and frothed like mad dogs and charged to hand-grips.
And we, mad with the fighting joy, dropped our bows and ran to meet
them, as a lover runs to his love.</p>

<p>By Ymir, it was a battle to madden and make drunken with the
slaughter and the fury. The Picts were as ferocious as we, but ours
was the superior physique, the keener wit, the more highly
developed fighting-brain. We won because we were a superior race,
but it was no easy victory. Corpses littered the blood-soaked
earth; but at last they broke, and we cut them down as they ran, to
the very edge of the trees. I tell of that fight in a few bald
words. I can not paint the madness, the reek of sweat and blood,
the panting, muscle-straining effort, the splintering of bones
under mighty blows, the rending and hewing of quivering sentient
flesh; above all the merciless abysmal savagery of the whole
affair, in which there was neither rule nor order, each man
fighting as he would or could. If I might do so, you would recoil
in horror; even the modern I, cognizant of my close kinship with
those times, stand aghast as I review that butchery. Mercy was yet
unborn, save as some individual's whim, and rules of warfare were
as yet undreamed of. It was an age in which each tribe and each
human fought tooth and fang from birth to death, and neither gave
nor expected mercy.</p>

<p>So we cut down the fleeing Picts, and our women came out on the
field to brain the wounded enemies with stones, or cut their
throats with copper knives. We did not torture. We were no more
cruel than life demanded. The rule of life was ruthlessness, but
there is more wanton cruelty today than ever we dreamed of. It was
not wanton bloodthirstiness that made us butcher wounded and
captive foes. It was because we knew our chances of survival
increased with each enemy slain.</p>

<p>Yet there was occasionally a touch of individual mercy, and so
it was in this fight. I had been occupied with a duel with an
especially valiant enemy. His tousled thatch of black hair scarcely
came above my chin, but he was a solid knot of steel-spring
muscles, than which lightning scarcely moved faster. He had an iron
sword and a hide-covered buckler. I had a knotty-headed bludgeon.
That fight was one that glutted even my battle-lusting soul. I was
bleeding from a score of flesh wounds before one of my terrible,
lashing strokes smashed his shield like cardboard, and an instant
later my bludgeon glanced from his unprotected head. Ymir! Even now
I stop to laugh and marvel at the hardness of that Pict's skull.
Men of that age were assuredly built on a rugged plan! That blow
should have spattered his brains like water. It did lay his scalp
open horribly, dashing him senseless to the earth, where I let him
lie, supposing him to be dead, as I joined in the slaughter of the
fleeing warriors.</p>

<p>When I returned reeking with sweat and blood, my club horridly
clotted with blood and brains, I noticed that my antagonist was
regaining consciousness, and that a naked tousle-headed girl was
preparing to give him the finishing touch with a stone she could
scarcely lift. A vagrant whim caused me to check the blow. I had
enjoyed the fight, and I admired the adamantine quality of his
skull.</p>

<p>We made camp a short distance away, burned our dead on a great
pyre, and after looting the corpses of the enemy, we dragged them
across the plateau and cast them down in a valley to make a feast
for the hyenas, jackals and vultures which were already gathering.
We kept close watch that night, but we were not attacked, though
far away through the jungle we could make out the red gleam of
fires, and could faintly hear, when the wind veered, the throb of
tom-toms and demoniac screams and yells&mdash;keenings for the
slain or mere animal squallings of fury.</p>

<p>Nor did they attack us in the days that followed. We bandaged
our captive's wounds and quickly learned his primitive tongue,
which, however, was so different from ours that I can not conceive
of the two languages having ever had a common source.</p>

<p>His name was Grom, and he was a great hunter and fighter, he
boasted. He talked freely and held no grudge, grinning broadly and
showing tusk-like teeth, his beady eyes glittering from under the
tangled black mane that fell over his low forehead. His limbs were
almost ape-like in their thickness.</p>

<p>He was vastly interested in his captors, though he could never
understand why he had been spared; to the end it remained an
inexplicable mystery to him. The Picts obeyed the law of survival
even more rigidly than did the Æsir. They were the more practical,
as shown by their more settled habits. They never roamed as far or
as blindly as we. Yet in every line we were the superior race.</p>

<p>Grom, impressed by our intelligence and fighting qualities,
volunteered to go into the hills and make peace for us with his
people. It was immaterial to us, but we let him go. Slavery had not
yet been dreamed of.</p>

<p>So Grom went back to his people, and we forgot about him, except
that I went a trifle more cautiously about my hunting, expecting
him to be lying in wait to put an arrow through my back. Then one
day we heard a rattle of tom-toms, and Grom appeared at the edge of
the jungle, his face split in his gorilla-grin, with the painted,
skinclad, feather-bedecked chiefs of the clans. Our ferocity had
awed them, and our sparing of Grom further impressed them. They
could not understand leniency; evidently we valued them too cheaply
to bother about killing one when he was in our power.</p>

<p>So peace was made with much pow-wow, and sworn to with many
strange oaths and rituals&mdash;we swore only by Y'mir, and an
Æsir never broke that vow. But they swore by the elements, by the
idol which sat in the fetish-hut where fires burned for ever and a
withered crone slapped a leather-covered drum all night long, and
by another being too terrible to be named.</p>

<p>Then we all sat around the fires and gnawed meat-bones, and
drank a fiery concoction they brewed from wild grain, and the
wonder is that the feast did not end in a general massacre; for
that liquor had devils in it and made maggots writhe in our brains.
But no harm came of our vast drunkenness, and thereafter we dwelt
at peace with our barbarous neighbors. They taught us many things,
and learned many more from us. But they taught us iron-workings;
into which they had been forced by the lack of copper in those
hills, and we quickly excelled them.</p>

<p>We went freely among their villages&mdash;mud-walled clusters of
huts in hilltop clearings, overshadowed by giant trees&mdash;and we
allowed them to come at will among our camps&mdash;straggling lines
of hide tents on the plateau where the battle had been fought. Our
young men cared not for their squat beady-eyed women, and our rangy
clean-limbed girls with their tousled yellow heads were not drawn
to the hairy-breasted savages. Familiarity over a period of years
would have reduced the repulsion on either side, until the two
races would have flowed together to form one hybrid people, but
long before that time the Æsir rose and departed, vanishing into
the mysterious hazes of the haunted south. But before that exodus
there came to pass the horror of the Worm.</p>

<p>I hunted with Grom and he led me into brooding, uninhabited
valleys and up into silence-haunted hills where no men had set foot
before us. But there was one valley, off in the mazes of the
southwest, into which he would not go. Stumps of shattered columns,
relics of a forgotten civilization, stood among the trees on the
valley floor. Grom showed them to me, as we stood on the cliffs
that flanked the mysterious vale, but he would not go down into it,
and he dissuaded me when I would have gone alone. He would not
speak plainly of the danger that lurked there, but it was greater
than that of serpent or tiger, or the trumpeting elephants which
occasionally wandered up in devastating droves from the south.</p>

<p>Of all beasts, Grom told me in the gutturals of his tongue, the
Picts feared only Satha, the great snake, and they shunned the
jungle where he lived. But there was another thing they feared, and
it was connected in some manner with the Valley of Broken Stones,
as the Picts called the crumbling pillars. Long ago, when his
ancestors had first come into the country, they had dared that grim
vale, and a whole clan of them had perished, suddenly, horribly,
and unexplainably. At least Grom did not explain. The horror had
come up out of the earth, somehow, and it was not good to talk of
it, since it was believed that It might be summoned by speaking of
It&mdash;whatever It was.</p>

<p>But Grom was ready to hunt with me anywhere else; for he was the
greatest hunter among the Picts, and many and fearful were our
adventures. Once I killed, with the iron sword I had forged with my
own hands, that most terrible of all beasts&mdash;old saber-tooth,
which men today call a tiger because he was more like a tiger than
anything else. In reality he was almost as much like a bear in
build, save for his unmistakably feline head. Saber-tooth was
massive-limbed, with a low-hung, great, heavy body, and he vanished
from the earth because he was too terrible a fighter, even for that
grim age. As his muscles and ferocity grew, his brain dwindled
until at last even the instinct of self-preservation vanished.
Nature, who maintains her balance in such things, destroyed him
because, had his super-fighting powers been allied with an
intelligent brain, he would have destroyed all other forms of life
on earth. He was a freak on the road of evolution &mdash; organic
development gone mad and run to fangs and talons, to slaughter and
destruction.</p>

<p>I killed saber-tooth in a battle that would make a saga in
itself, and for months afterward I lay semi-delirious with ghastly
wounds that made the toughest warriors shake their heads. The Picts
said that never before had a man killed a saber-tooth
single-handed. Yet I recovered, to the wonder of all.</p>

<p>While I lay at the doors of death there was a secession from the
tribe. It was a peaceful secession, such as continually occurred
and contributed greatly to the peopling of the world by
yellow-haired tribes. Forty-five of the young men took themselves
mates simultaneously and wandered off to found a clan of their own.
There was no revolt; it was a racial custom which bore fruits in
all the later ages, when tribes sprung from the same roots met,
after centuries of separation, and cut one another's throats with
joyous abandon. The tendency of the Aryan and the pre-Aryan was
always toward disunity, clans splitting off the main stem, and
scattering.</p>

<p>So these young men, led by one Bragi, my brother-in-arms, took
their girls and venturing to the southwest, took up their abode in
the Valley of Broken Stones. The Picts expostulated, hinting
vaguely of a monstrous doom that haunted the vale, but the Æsir
laughed. We had left our own demons and weirds in the icy wastes of
the far blue north, and the devils of other races did not much
impress us.</p>

<p>When my full strength was returned, and the grisly wounds were
only scars, I girt on my weapons and strode over the plateau to
visit Bragi's clan. Grom did not accompany me. He had not been in
the Æsir camp for several days. But I knew the way. I remembered
well the valley, from the cliffs of which I had looked down and
seen the lake at the upper end, the trees thickening into forest at
the lower extremity. The sides of the valley were high sheer
cliffs, and a steep broad ridge at either end, cut it off from the
surrounding country. It was toward the lower or southwestern end
that the valley-floor was dotted thickly with ruined columns, some
towering high among the trees, some fallen into heaps of
lichen-clad stones. What race reared them none knew. But Grom had
hinted fearsomely of a hairy, apish monstrosity dancing loathsomely
under the moon to a demoniac piping that induced horror and
madness.</p>

<p>I crossed the plateau whereon our camp was pitched, descended
the slope, traversed a shallow vegetation-choked valley, climbed
another slope, and plunged into the hills. A half-day's leisurely
travel brought me to the ridge on the other side of which lay the
valley of the pillars. For many miles I had seen no sign of human
life. The settlements of the Picts all lay many miles to the east.
I topped the ridge and looked down into the dreaming valley with
its still blue lake, its brooding cliffs and its broken columns
jutting among the trees. I looked for smoke. I saw none, but I saw
vultures wheeling in the sky over a cluster of tents on the lake
shore.</p>

<p>I came down the ridge warily and approached the silent camp. In
it I halted, frozen with horror. I was not easily moved. I had seen
death in many forms, and had fled from or taken part in red
massacres that spilled blood like water and heaped the earth with
corpses. But here I was confronted with an organic devastation that
staggered and appalled me. Of Bragi's embryonic clan, not one
remained alive, and not one corpse was whole. Some of the hide
tents still stood erect. Others were mashed down and flattened out,
as if crushed by some monstrous weight, so that at first I wondered
if a drove of elephants had stampeded across the camp. But no
elephants ever wrought such destruction as I saw strewn on the
bloody ground. The camp was a shambles, littered with bits of flesh
and fragments of bodies&mdash;hands, feet, heads, pieces of human
debris. Weapons lay about, some of them stained with a greenish
slime like that which spurts from a crushed caterpillar.</p>

<p>No human foe could have committed this ghastly atrocity. I
looked at the lake, wondering if nameless amphibian monsters had
crawled from the calm waters whose deep blue told of unfathomed
depths. Then I saw a print left by the destroyer. It was a track
such as a titanic worm might leave, yards broad, winding back down
the valley. The grass lay flat where it ran, and bushes and small
trees had been crushed down into the earth, all horribly smeared
with blood and greenish slime.</p>

<p>With berserk fury in my soul I drew my sword and started to
follow it, when a call attracted me. I wheeled, to see a stocky
form approaching me from the ridge. It was Grom the Pict, and when
I think of the courage it must have taken for him to have overcome
all the instincts planted in him by traditional teachings and
personal experience, I realize the full depths of his friendship
for me.</p>

<p>Squatting on the lake shore, spear in his hands, his black eyes
ever roving fearfully down the brooding tree-waving reaches of the
valley, Grom told me of the horror that had come upon Bragi's clan
under the moon. But first he told me of it, as his sires had told
the tale to him.</p>

<p>Long ago the Picts had drifted down from the northwest on a
long, long trek, finally reaching these jungle-covered hills,
where, because they were weary, and because the game and fruit were
plentiful and there were no hostile tribes, they halted and built
their mud-walled villages.</p>

<p>Some of them, a whole clan of that numerous tribe, took up their
abode in the Valley of the Broken Stones. They found the columns
and a great ruined temple back in the trees, and in that temple
there was no shrine or altar, but the mouth of a shaft that
vanished deep into the black earth, and in which there were no
steps such as a human being would make and use. They built their
village in the valley, and in the night, under the moon, horror
came upon them and left only broken walls and bits of slime-smeared
flesh.</p>

<p>In those days the Picts feared nothing. The warriors of the
other clans gathered and sang their war-songs and danced their
war-dances, and followed a broad track of blood and slime to the
shaft-mouth in the temple. They howled defiance and hurled down
boulders which were never heard to strike bottom. Then began a thin
demoniac piping, and up from the well pranced a hideous
anthropomorphic figure dancing to the weird strains of a pipe it
held in its monstrous hands. The horror of its aspect froze the
fierce Picts with amazement, and close behind it a vast white bulk
heaved up from the subterranean darkness. Out of the shaft came a
slavering mad nightmare which arrows pierced but could not check,
which swords carved but could not slay. It fell slobbering upon the
warriors, crushing them to crimson pulp, tearing them to bits as an
octopus might tear small fishes, sucking their blood from their
mangled limbs and devouring them even as they screamed and
struggled. The survivors fled, pursued to the very ridge, up which,
apparently, the monster could not propel its quaking mountainous
bulk.</p>

<p>After that they did not dare the silent valley. But the dead
came to their shamans and old men in dreams and told them strange
and terrible secrets. They spoke of an ancient, ancient race of
semihuman beings which once inhabited that valley and reared those
columns for their own weird inexplicable purposes. The white
monster in the pits was their god, summoned up from the nighted
abysses of mid-earth uncounted fathoms below the black mold, by
sorcery unknown to the sons of men. The hairy anthropomorphic being
was its servant, created to serve the god, a formless elemental
spirit drawn up from below and cased in flesh, organic but beyond
the understanding of humanity. The Old Ones had long vanished into
the limbo from whence they crawled in the black dawn of the
universe; but their bestial god and his inhuman slave lived on. Yet
both were organic after a fashion, and could be wounded, though no
human weapon had been found potent enough to slay them.</p>

<p>Bragi and his clan had dwelt for weeks in the valley before the
horror struck. Only the night before, Grom, hunting above the
cliffs, and by that token daring greatly, had been paralyzed by a
high-pitched demon piping, and then by a mad clamor of human
screaming. Stretched face down in the dirt, hiding his head in a
tangle of grass, he had not dared to move, even when the shrieks
died away in the slobbering, repulsive sounds of a hideous feast.
When dawn broke he had crept shuddering to the cliffs to look down
into the valley, and the sight of the devastation, even when seen
from afar, had driven him in yammering flight far into the hills.
But it had occurred to him, finally, that he should warn the rest
of the tribe, and returning, on his way to the camp on the plateau,
he had seen me entering the valley.</p>

<p>So spoke Grom, while I sat and brooded darkly, my chin on my
mighty fist. I can not frame in modern words the clan-feeling that
in those days was a living vital part of every man and woman. In a
world where talon and fang were lifted on every hand, and the hands
of all men raised against an individual, except those of his own
clan, tribal instinct was more than the phrase it is today. It was
as much a part of a man as was his heart or his right hand. This
was necessary, for only thus banded together in unbreakable groups
could mankind have survived in the terrible environments of the
primitive world. So now the personal grief I felt for Bragi and the
clean-limbed young men and laughing white-skinned girls was drowned
in a deeper sea of grief and fury that was cosmic in its depth and
intensity. I sat grimly, while the Pict squatted anxiously beside
me, his gaze roving from me to the menacing deeps of the valley
where the accursed columns loomed like broken teeth of cackling
hags among the waving leafy reaches.</p>

<p>I, Niord, was not one to use my brain over-much. I lived in a
physical world, and there were the old men of the tribe to do my
thinking. But I was one of a race destined to become dominant
mentally as well as physically, and I was no mere muscular animal.
So as I sat there there came dimly and then clearly a thought to me
that brought a short fierce laugh from my lips.</p>

<p>Rising, I bade Grom aid me, and we built a pyre on the lake
shore of dried wood, the ridge-poles of the tents, and the broken
shafts of spears. Then we collected the grisly fragments that had
been parts of Bragi's band, and we laid them on the pile, and
struck flint and steel to it.</p>

<p>The thick sad smoke crawled serpent-like into the sky, and
turning to Grom, I made him guide me to the jungle where lurked
that scaly horror, Satha, the great serpent. Grom gaped at me; not
the greatest hunters among the Picts sought out the mighty crawling
one. But my will was like a wind that swept him along my course,
and at last he led the way. We left the valley by the upper end,
crossing the ridge, skirting the tall cliffs, and plunged into the
fastnesses of the south, which was peopled only by the grim
denizens of the jungle. Deep into the jungle we went, until we came
to a low-lying expanse, dank and dark beneath the great
creeper-festooned trees, where our feet sank deep into the spongy
silt, carpeted by rotting vegetation, and slimy moisture oozed up
beneath their pressure. This, Grom told me, was the realm haunted
by Satha, the great serpent.</p>

<p>Let me speak of Satha. There is nothing like him on earth today,
nor has there been for countless ages. Like the meat-eating
dinosaur, like old saber-tooth, he was too terrible to exist. Even
then he was a survival of a grimmer age when life and its forms
were cruder and more hideous. There were not many of his kind then,
though they may have existed in great numbers in the reeking ooze
of the vast jungle-tangled swamps still farther south. He was
larger than any python of modern ages, and his fangs dripped with
poison a thousand times more deadly than that of a king cobra.</p>

<p>He was never worshipped by the pure-blood Picts, though the
blacks that came later deified him, and that adoration persisted in
the hybrid race that sprang from the Negroes and their white
conquerors. But to other peoples he was the nadir of evil horror,
and tales of him became twisted into demonology; so in later ages
Satha became the veritable devil of the white races, and the
Stygians first worshipped, and then, when they became Egyptians,
abhorred him under the name of Set, the Old Serpent, while to the
Semites he became Leviathan and Satan. He was terrible enough to be
a god, for he was a crawling death. I had seen a bull elephant fall
dead in his tracks from Satha's bite. I had seen him, had glimpsed
him writhing his horrific way through the dense jungle, had seen
him take his prey, but I had never hunted him. He was too grim,
even for the slayer of old saber-tooth.</p>

<p>But now I hunted him, plunging farther and farther into the hot,
breathless reek of his jungle, even when friendship for me could
not drive Grom farther. He urged me to paint my body and sing my
death-song before I advanced farther, but I pushed on
unheeding.</p>

<p>In a natural runway that wound between the shouldering trees, I
set a trap. I found a large tree, soft and spongy of fiber, but
thick-boled and heavy, and I hacked through its base close to the
ground with my great sword, directing its fall so that, when it
toppled, its top crashed into the branches of a smaller tree,
leaving it leaning across the runway, one end resting on the earth,
the other caught in the small tree. Then I cut away the branches on
the under side, and cutting a slim tough sapling I trimmed it and
stuck it upright like a prop-pole under the leaning tree. Then,
cutting a way the tree which supported it, I left the great trunk
poised precariously on the prop-pole, to which I fastened a long
vine, as thick as my wrist.</p>

<p>Then I went alone through that primordial twilight jungle until
an overpowering fetid odor assailed my nostrils, and from the rank
vegetation in front of me, Satha reared up his hideous head,
swaying lethally from side to side, while his forked tongue jetted
in and out, and his great yellow terrible eyes burned icily on me
with all the evil wisdom of the black elder world that was when man
was not. I backed away, feeling no fear, only an icy sensation
along my spine, and Satha came sinuously after me, his shining
eighty-foot barrel rippling over the rotting vegetation in mesmeric
silence. His wedge-shaped head was bigger than the head of the
hugest stallion, his trunk was thicker than a man's body, and his
scales shimmered with a thousand changing scintillations. I was to
Satha as a mouse is to a king cobra, but I was fanged as no mouse
ever was. Quick as I was, I knew I could not avoid the lightning
stroke of that great triangular head; so I dared not let him come
too close. Subtly I fled down the runway; and behind me the rush of
the great supple body was like the sweep of wind through the
grass.</p>

<p>He was not far behind me when I raced beneath the deadfall, and
as the great shining length glided under the trap, I gripped the
vine with both hands and jerked desperately. With a crash the great
trunk fell across Satha's scaly back, some six feet back of his
wedge-shaped head.</p>

<p>I had hoped to break his spine but I do not think it did, for
the great body coiled and knotted, the mighty tail lashed and
thrashed, mowing down the bushes as if with a giant flail. At the
instant of the fall, the huge head had whipped about and struck the
tree with a terrific impact, the mighty fangs shearing through bark
and wood like scimitars. Now, as if aware he fought an inanimate
foe, Satha turned on me, standing out of his reach. The scaly neck
writhed and arched, the mighty jaws gaped, disclosing fangs a foot
in length, from which dripped venom that might have burned through
solid stone.</p>

<p>I believe, what of his stupendous strength, that Satha would
have writhed from under the trunk, but for a broken branch that had
been driven deep into his side, holding him like a barb. The sound
of his hissing filled the jungle and his eyes glared at me with
such concentrated evil that I shook despite myself. Oh, he knew it
was I who had trapped him! Now I came as close as I dared, and with
a sudden powerful cast of my spear, transfixed his neck just below
the gaping jaws, nailing him to the tree-trunk Then I dared
greatly, for he was far from dead, and I knew he would in an
instant tear the spear from the wood and be free to strike. But in
that instant I ran in, and swinging my sword with all my great
power, I hewed off his terrible head.</p>

<p>The heavings and contortions of Satha's prisoned form in life
were naught to the convulsions of his headless length in death. I
retreated, dragging the gigantic head after me with a crooked pole,
and at a safe distance from the lashing, flying tail, I set to
work. I worked with naked death then, and no man ever toiled more
gingerly than did I. For I cut out the poison sacs at the base of
the great fangs, and in the terrible venom I soaked the heads of
eleven arrows, being careful that only the bronze points were in
the liquid, which else had corroded away the wood of the tough
shafts. While I was doing this, Grom, driven by comradeship and
curiosity, came stealing nervously through the jungle, and his
mouth gaped as he looked on the head of Satha.</p>

<p>For hours I steeped the arrowheads in the poison, until they
were caked with a horrible green scum, and showed tiny flecks of
corrosion where the venom had eaten into the solid bronze. He
wrapped them carefully in broad, thick, rubber-like leaves, and
then, though night had fallen and the hunting beasts were roaring
on every hand, I went back through the jungled hills, Grom with me,
until at dawn we came again to the high cliffs that loomed above
the Valley of Broken Stones.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the valley I broke my spear, and I took all the
unpoisoned shafts from my quiver, and snapped them. I painted my
face and limbs as the Æsir painted themselves only when they went
forth to certain doom, and I sang my death-song to the sun as it
rose over the cliffs, my yellow mane blowing in the morning
wind.</p>

<p>Then I went down into the valley, bow in hand. Grom could not
drive himself to follow me. He lay on his belly in the dust and
howled like a dying dog.</p>

<p>I passed the lake and the silent camp where the pyre-ashes still
smoldered, and came under the thickening trees beyond. About me the
columns loomed, mere shapeless heaps from the ravages of staggering
eons. The trees grew more dense, and under their vast leafy
branches the very light was dusky and evil. As in twilight shadow I
saw the ruined temple, cyclopean walls staggering up from masses of
decaying masonry and fallen blocks of stone. About six hundred
yards in front of it a great column reared up in an open glade,
eighty or ninety feet in height. It was so worn and pitted by
weather and time that any child of my tribe could have climbed it,
and I marked it and changed my plan.</p>

<p>I came to the ruins and saw huge crumbling walls upholding a
domed roof from which many stones had fallen, so that it seemed
like the lichen-grown ribs of some mythical monster's skeleton
arching above me. Titanic columns flanked the open doorway through
which ten elephants could have stalked abreast. Once there might
have been inscriptions and hieroglyphics on the pillars and walls,
but they were long worn away. Around the great room, on the inner
side, ran columns in better state of preservation. On each of these
columns was a flat pedestal, and some dim instinctive memory
vaguely resurrected a shadowy scene wherein black drums roared
madly, and on these pedestals monstrous beings squatted loathsomely
in inexplicable rituals rooted in the black dawn of the
universe.</p>

<p>There was no altar&mdash;only the mouth of a great well-like
shaft in the stone floor, with strange obscene carvings all about
the rim. I tore great pieces of stone from the rotting floor and
cast them down the shaft which slanted down into utter darkness. I
heard them bound along the side, but I did not hear them strike
bottom. I cast down stone after stone, each with a searing curse,
and at last I heard a sound that was not the dwindling rumble of
the falling stones. Up from the well floated a weird demon-piping
that was a symphony of madness. Far down in the darkness I glimpsed
the faint fearful glimmering of a vast white bulk.</p>

<p>I retreated slowly as the piping grew louder, falling back
through the broad doorway. I heard a scratching, scrambling noise,
and up from the shaft and out of the doorway between the colossal
columns came a prancing incredible figure. It went erect like a
man, but it was covered with fur, that was shaggiest where its face
should have been. If it had ears, nose and a mouth I did not
discover them. Only a pair of staring red eyes leered from the
furry mask. Its misshapen hands held a strange set of pipes, on
which it blew weirdly as it pranced toward me with many a grotesque
caper and leap.</p>

<p>Behind it I heard a repulsive obscene noise as of a quaking
unstable mass heaving up out of a well. Then I nocked an arrow,
drew the cord and sent the shaft singing through the furry breast
of the dancing monstrosity. It went down as though struck by a
thunderbolt, but to my horror the piping continued, though the
pipes had fallen from the malformed hands. Then I turned and ran
fleetly to the column, up which I swarmed before I looked back.
When I reached the pinnacle I looked, and because of the shock and
surprise of what I saw, I almost fell from my dizzy perch.</p>

<p>Out of the temple the monstrous dweller in the darkness had
come, and I, who had expected a horror yet cast in some terrestrial
mold, looked on the spawn of nightmare. From what subterranean hell
it crawled in the long ago I know not, nor what black age it
represented. But it was not a beast, as humanity knows beasts. I
call it a worm for lack of a better term. There is no earthly
language which has a name for it. I can only say that it looked
somewhat more like a worm than it did an octopus, a serpent or a
dinosaur.</p>

<p>It was white and pulpy, and drew its quaking bulk along the
ground, worm-fashion. But it had wide flat tentacles, and fleshly
feelers, and other adjuncts the use of which I am unable to
explain. And it had a long proboscis which it curled and uncurled
like an elephant's trunk. Its forty eyes, set in a horrific circle,
were composed of thousands of facets of as many scintillant colors
which changed and altered in never-ending transmutation. But
through all interplay of hue and glint, they retained their evil
intelligence&mdash;intelligence there was behind those flickering
facets, not human nor yet bestial, but a night-born demoniac
intelligence such as men in dreams vaguely sense throbbing
titanically in the black gulfs outside our material universe. In
size the monster was mountainous; its bulk would have dwarfed a
mastodon.</p>

<p>But even as I shook with the cosmic horror of the thing, I drew
a feathered shaft to my ear and arched it singing on its way. Grass
and bushes were crushed flat as the monster came toward me like a
moving mountain and shaft after shaft I sent with terrific force
and deadly precision. I could not miss so huge a target. The arrows
sank to the feathers or clear out of sight in the unstable bulk,
each bearing enough poison to have stricken dead a bull elephant.
Yet on it came; swiftly, appallingly, apparently heedless of both
the shafts and the venom in which they were steeped. And all the
time the hideous music played a maddening accompaniment, whining
thinly from the pipes that lay untouched on the ground.</p>

<p>My confidence faded; even the poison of Satha was futile against
this uncanny being. I drove my last shaft almost straight downward
into the quaking white mountain, so close was the monster under my
perch. Then suddenly its color altered. A wave of ghastly blue
surged over it, and the vast hulk heaved in earthquake-like
convulsions. With a terrible plunge it struck the lower part of the
column, which crashed to falling shards of stone. But even with the
impact, I leaped far out and fell through the empty air full upon
the monster's back.</p>

<p>The spongy skin yielded and gave beneath my feet, and I drove my
sword hilt-deep, dragging it through the pulpy flesh, ripping a
horrible yard-long wound, from which oozed a green slime. Then a
flip of a cable-like tentacle flicked me from the titan's back and
spun me three hundred feet through the air to crash among a cluster
of giant trees.</p>

<p>The impact must have splintered half the bones in my frame, for
when I sought to grasp my sword again and crawl anew to the combat,
I could not move hand or foot, could only writhe helplessly with my
broken back. But I could see the monster and I knew that I had won,
even in defeat. The mountainous bulk was heaving and billowing, the
tentacles were lashing madly, the antennae writhing and knotting,
and the nauseous whiteness had changed to a pale and grisly green.
It turned ponderously and lurched back toward the temple, rolling
like a crippled ship in a heavy swell. Trees crashed and splintered
as it lumbered against them.</p>

<p>I wept with pure fury because I could not catch up my sword and
rush in to die glutting my berserk madness in mighty strokes. But
the worm-god was death-stricken and needed not my futile sword. The
demon pipes on the ground kept up their infernal tune, and it was
like the fiend's death-dirge. Then as the monster veered and
floundered, I saw it catch up the corpse of its hairy slave. For an
instant the apish form dangled in midair, gripped round by the
trunk-like proboscis, then was dashed against the temple wall with
a force that reduced the hairy body to a mere shapeless pulp. At
that the pipes screamed out horribly, and fell silent for ever.</p>

<p>The titan staggered on the brink of the shaft; then another
change came over it&mdash;a frightful transfiguration the nature of
which I can not yet describe. Even now when I try to think of it
clearly, I am only chaotically conscious of a blasphemous,
unnatural transmutation of form and substance, shocking and
indescribable. Then the strangely altered bulk tumbled into the
shaft to roll down into the ultimate darkness from whence it came,
and I knew that it was dead. And as it vanished into the well, with
a rending, grinding groan the ruined walls quivered from dome to
base. They bent inward and buckled with deafening reverberation,
the columns splintered, and with a cataclysmic crash the dome
itself came thundering down. For an instant the air seemed veiled
with flying debris and stone-dust, through which the treetops
lashed madly as in a storm or an earthquake convulsion. Then all
was clear again and I stared, shaking the blood from my eyes. Where
the temple had stood there lay only a colossal pile of shattered
masonry and broken stones, and every column in the valley had
fallen, to lie in crumbling shards.</p>

<p>In the silence that followed I heard Grom wailing a dirge over
me. I bade him lay my sword in my hand, and he did so, and bent
close to hear what I had to say, for I was passing swiftly.</p>

<p>"Let my tribe remember," I said, speaking slowly. "Let the tale
be told from village to village, from camp to camp, from tribe to
tribe, so that men may know that not man nor beast nor devil may
prey in safety on the golden-haired people of Asgard. Let them
build me a cairn where I lie and lay me therein with my bow and
sword at hand, to guard this valley for ever; so if the ghost of
the god I slew comes up from below, my ghost will ever be ready to
give it battle."</p>

<p>And while Grom howled and beat his hairy breast, death came to
me in the Valley of the Worm.</p>
