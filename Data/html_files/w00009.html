<h3><a name="1_0_2">BACK TO GOD'S COUNTRY</a></h3>

<p>When Shan Tung, the long-cued Chinaman from Vancouver, started up
the Frazer River in the old days when the Telegraph Trail and the
headwaters of the Peace were the Meccas of half the gold-hunting
population of British Columbia, he did not foresee tragedy ahead of
him. He was a clever man, was Shan Tung, a cha-sukeed, a very devil in
the collecting of gold, and far-seeing. But he could not look forty
years into the future, and when Shan Tung set off into the north, that
winter, he was in reality touching fire to the end of a fuse that was
to burn through four decades before the explosion came.</p>

<p>With Shan Tung went Tao, a Great Dane. The Chinaman had picked him
up somewhere on the coast and had trained him as one trains a horse.
Tao was the biggest dog ever seen about the Height of Land, the most
powerful, and at times the most terrible. Of two things Shan Tung was
enormously proud in his silent and mysterious oriental way&mdash;of
Tao, the dog, and of his long, shining cue which fell to the crook of
his knees when he let it down. It had been the longest cue in
Vancouver, and therefore it was the longest cue in British Columbia.
The cue and the dog formed the combination which set the forty-year
fuse of romance and tragedy burning. Shan Tung started for the El
Dorados early in the winter, and Tao alone pulled his sledge and
outfit. It was no more than an ordinary task for the monstrous Great
Dane, and Shan Tung subserviently but with hidden triumph passed outfit
after outfit exhausted by the way. He had reached Copper Creek Camp,
which was boiling and frothing with the excitement of gold-maddened
men, and was congratulating himself that he would soon be at the camps
west of the Peace, when the thing happened. A drunken Irishman, filled
with a grim and unfortunate sense of humor, spotted Shan Tung's
wonderful cue and coveted it. Wherefore there followed a bit of
excitement in which Shan Tung passed into his empyrean home with a
bullet through his heart, and the drunken Irishman was strung up for
his misdeed fifteen minutes later. Tao, the Great Dane, was taken by
the leader of the men who pulled on the rope. Tao's new master was a
"drifter," and as he drifted, his face was always set to the north,
until at last a new humor struck him and he turned eastward to the
Mackenzie. As the seasons passed, Tao found mates along the way and
left a string of his progeny behind him, and he had new masters, one
after another, until he was grown old and his muzzle was turning gray.
And never did one of these masters turn south with him. Always it was
north, north with the white man first, north with the Cree, and then
wit h the Chippewayan, until in the end the dog born in a Vancouver
kennel died in an Eskimo igloo on the Great Bear. But the breed of the
Great Dane lived on. Here and there, as the years passed, one would
find among the Eskimo trace-dogs, a grizzled-haired, powerful-jawed
giant that was alien to the arctic stock, and in these occasional
aliens ran the blood of Tao, the Dane.</p>

<p>Forty years, more or less, after Shan Tung lost his life and his cue
at Copper Creek Camp, there was born on a firth of Coronation Gulf a
dog who was named Wapi, which means "the Walrus." Wapi, at full growth,
was a throwback of more than forty dog generations. He was nearly as
large as his forefather, Tao. His fangs were an inch in length, his
great jaws could crack the thigh-bone of a caribou, and from the
beginning the hands of men and the fangs of beasts were against him.
Almost from the day of his birth until this winter of his fourth year,
life for Wapi had been an unceasing fight for existence. He was
maya-tisew&mdash;bad with the badness of a devil. His reputation had
gone from master to master and from igloo to igloo; women and children
were afraid of him, and men always spoke to him with the club or the
lash in their hands. He was hated and feared, and yet because he could
run down a barren-land caribou and kill it within a mile, and would
hold a big white bear at bay until the hunters came, he was not
sacrificed to this hate and fear. A hundred whips and clubs and a
hundred pairs of hands were against him between Cape Perry and the
crown of Franklin Bay&mdash;and the fangs of twice as many dogs.</p>

<p>The dogs were responsible. Quick-tempered, clannish with the savage
brotherhood of the wolves, treacherous, jealous of leadership, and with
the older instincts of the dog dead within them, their merciless feud
with what they regarded as an interloper of another breed put the devil
heart in Wapi. In all the gray and desolate sweep of his world he had
no friend. The heritage of Tao, his forefather, had fallen upon him,
and he was an alien in a land of strangers. As the dogs and the men and
women and children hated him, so he hated them. He hated the sight and
smell of the round-faced, blear-eyed creatures who were his master, yet
he obeyed them, sullenly, watchfully, with his lips wrinkled warningly
over fangs which had twice torn out the life of white bears. Twenty
times he had killed other dogs. He had fought them singly, and in
pairs, and in packs. His giant body bore the scars of a hundred wounds.
He had been clubbed until a part of his body was deformed and he
traveled with a limp. He kept to himself even in the mating season. And
all this because Wapi, the Walrus, forty years removed from the Great
Dane of Vancouver, was a white man's dog.</p>

<p>Stirring restlessly within him, sometimes coming to him in dreams
and sometimes in a great and unfulfilled yearning, Wapi felt vaguely
the strange call of his forefathers. It was impossible for him to
understand. It was impossible for him to know what it meant. And yet he
did know that somewhere there was something for which he was seeking
and which he never found. The desire and the questing came to him most
compellingly in the long winter filled with its eternal starlight, when
the maddening yap, yap, yap of the little white foxes, the barking of
the dogs, and the Eskimo chatter oppressed him like the voices of
haunting ghosts. In these long months, filled with the horror of the
arctic night, the spirit of Tao whispered within him that somewhere
there was light and sun, that somewhere there was warmth and flowers,
and running streams, and voices he could understand, and things he
could love. And then Wapi would whine, and perhaps the whine would
bring him the blow of a club, or the lash of a whip, or an Eskimo
threat, or the menace of an Eskimo dog's snarl. Of the latter Wapi was
unafraid. With a snap of his jaws, he could break the back of any other
dog on Franklin Bay.</p>

<p>Such was Wapi, the Walrus, when for two sacks of flour, some
tobacco, and a bale of cloth he became the property of Blake, the
uta-wawe-yinew, the trader in seals, whalebone&mdash;and women. On this
day Wapi's soul took its flight back through the space of forty years.
For Blake was white, which is to say that at one time or another he had
been white. His skin and his appearance did not betray how black he had
turned inside and Wapi's brute soul cried out to him, telling him how
he had waited and watched for this master he knew would come, how he
would fight for him, how he wanted to lie down and put his great head
on the white man's feet in token of his fealty. But Wapi's bloodshot
eyes and battle-scarred face failed to reveal what was in him, and
Blake&mdash;following the instructions of those who should
know&mdash;ruled him from the beginning with a club that was more
brutal than the club of the Eskimo.</p>

<p>For three months Wapi had been the property of Blake, and it was now
the dead of a long and sunless arctic night. Blake's cabin, built of
ship timber and veneered with blocks of ice, was built in the face of a
deep pit that sheltered it from wind and storm. To this cabin came the
Nanatalmutes from the east, and the Kogmollocks from the west,
bartering their furs and whalebone and seal-oil for the things Blake
gave in exchange, and adding women to their wares whenever Blake
announced a demand. The demand had been excellent this winter. Over in
Darnley Bay, thirty miles across the headland, was the whaler Harpoon
frozen up for the winter with a crew of thirty men, and straight out
from the face of his igloo cabin, less than a mile away, was the Flying
Moon with a crew of twenty more. It was Blake's business to wait and
watch like a hawk for such opportunities as there, and
tonight&mdash;his watch pointed to the hour of twelve,
midnight&mdash;he was sitting in the light of a sputtering seal-oil
lamp adding up figures which told him that his winter, only half gone,
had already been an enormously profitable one.</p>

<p>"If the Mounted Police over at Herschel only knew," he chuckled.
"Uppy, if they did, they'd have an outfit after us in twenty-four
hours."</p>

<p>Oopi, his Eskimo right-hand man, had learned to understand English,
and he nodded, his moon-face split by a wide and enigmatic grin. In his
way, "Uppy" was as clever as Shan Tung had been in his.</p>

<p>And Blake added, "We've sold every fur and every pound of bone and
oil, and we've forty Upisk wives to our credit at fifty dollars
apiece."</p>

<p>Uppy's grin became larger, and his throat was filled with an
exultant rattle. In the matter of the Upisk wives he knew that he stood
ace-high.</p>

<p>"Never," said Blake, "has our wife-by-the-month business been so
good. If it wasn't for Captain Rydal and his love-affair, we'd take a
vacation and go hunting."</p>

<p>He turned, facing the Eskimo, and the yellow flame of the lamp lit
up his face. It was the face of a remarkable man. A black beard
concealed much of its cruelty and its cunning, a beard as carefully
Van-dycked as though Blake sat in a professional chair two thousand
miles south, but the beard could not hide the almost inhuman hardness
of the eyes. There was a glittering light in them as he looked at the
Eskimo. "Did you see her today, Uppy? Of course you did. My Gawd, if a
woman could ever tempt me, she could! And Rydal is going to have her.
Unless I miss my guess, there's going to be money in it for us&mdash;a
lot of it. The funny part of it is, Rydal's got to get rid of her
husband. And how's he going to do it, Uppy? Eh? Answer me that. How's
he going to do it?"</p>

<p>In a hole he had dug for himself in the drifted snow under a huge
scarp of ice a hundred yards from the igloo cabin lay Wapi. His bed was
red with the stain of blood, and a trail of blood led from the cabin to
the place where he had hidden himself. Not many hours ago, when by
God's sun it should have been day, he had turned at last on a teasing,
snarling, back-biting little kiskanuk of a dog and had killed it. And
Blake and Uppy had beaten him until he was almost dead.</p>

<p>It was not of the beating that Wapi was thinking as he lay in his
wallow. He was thinking of the fur-clad figure that had come between
Blake's club and his body, of the moment when for the first time in his
life he had seen the face of a white woman. She had stopped Blake's
club. He had heard her voice. She had bent over him, and she would have
put her hand on him if his master had not dragged her back with a cry
of warning. She had gone into the cabin then, and he had dragged
himself away.</p>

<p>Since then a new and thrilling flame had burned in him. For a time
his senses had been dazed by his punishment, but now every instinct in
him was like a living wire. Slowly he pulled himself from his retreat
and sat down on his haunches. His gray muzzle was pointed to the sky.
The same stars were there, burning in cold, white points of flame as
they had burned week after week in the maddening monotony of the long
nights near the pole. They were like a million pitiless eyes, never
blinking, always watching, things of life and fire, and yet dead. And
at those eyes, the little white foxes yapped so incessantly that the
sound of it drove men mad. They were yapping now. They were never
still. And with their yapping came the droning, hissing monotone of the
aurora, like the song of a vast piece of mechanism in the still farther
north. Toward this Wapi turned his bruised and beaten head. Out there,
just beyond the ghostly pale of vision, was the ship. Fifty times he
had slunk out and around it, cautiously as the foxes themselves. He had
caught its smells and its sounds; he had come near enough to hear the
voices of men, and those voices were like the voice of Blake, his
master. Therefore, he had never gone nearer.</p>

<p>There was a change in him now. His big pads fell noiselessly as he
slunk back to the cabin and sniffed for a scent in the snow. He found
it. It was the trail of the white woman. His blood tingled again, as it
had tingled when her face bent over him and her hand reached out, and
in his soul there rose up the ghost of Tao to whip him on. He followed
the woman's footprints slowly, stopping now and then to listen, and
each moment the spirit in him grew more insistent, and he whined up at
the stars. At last he saw the ship, a wraithlike thing in its piled-up
bed of ice, and he stopped. This was his dead-line. He had never gone
nearer. But tonight&mdash;if any one period could be called
night&mdash;he went on.</p>

<p>It was the hour of sleep, and there was no sound aboard. The foxes,
never tiring of their infuriating sport, were yapping at the ship. They
barked faster and louder when they caught the scent of Wapi, and as he
approached, they drifted farther away. The scent of the woman's trail
led up the wide bridge of ice, and Wapi followed this as he would have
followed a road, until he found himself all at once on the deck of the
Flying Moon. For a space he was startled. His long fangs bared
themselves at the shadows cast by the stars. Then he saw ahead of him a
narrow ribbon of yellow light. Toward this Wapi sniffed out, step by
step, the footprints of the woman. When he stopped again, his muzzle
was at the narrow crack through which came the glimmer of light.</p>

<p>It was the door of a deck-house veneered like an igloo with snow and
ice to protect it from cold and wind. It was, perhaps, half an inch
ajar, and through that aperture Wapi drank the warm, sweet perfume of
the woman. With it he caught also the smell of a man. But in him the
woman scent submerged all else. Overwhelmed by it, he stood trembling,
not daring to move, every inch of him thrilled by a vast and mysterious
yearning. He was no longer Wapi, the Walrus; Wapi, the Killer. Tao was
there. And it may be that the spirit of Shan Tung was there. For after
forty years the change had come, and Wapi, as he stood at the woman's
door, was just dog,&mdash;a white man's dog&mdash;again the dog of the
Vancouver kennel&mdash;the dog of a white man's world.</p>

<p>He thrust open the door with his nose. He slunk in, so silently that
he was not heard. The cabin was lighted. In a bed lay a white-faced,
hollow-cheeked man&mdash;awake. On a low stool at his side sat a woman.
The light of the lamp hanging from above warmed with gold fires the
thick and radiant mass of her hair. She was leaning over the sick man.
One slim, white hand was stroking his face gently, and she was speaking
to him in a voice so sweet and soft that it stirred like wonderful
music in Wapi's warped and beaten soul. And then, with a great sigh, he
flopped down, an abject slave, on the edge of her dress.</p>

<p>With a startled cry the woman turned. For a moment she stared at the
great beast wide-eyed, then there came slowly into her face recognition
and understanding. "Why, it's the dog Blake whipped so terribly," she
gasped. "Peter, it's&mdash;it's Wapi!" For the first time Wapi felt the
caress of a woman's hand, soft, gentle, pitying, and out of him there
came a wimpering sound that was almost a sob.</p>

<p>"It's the dog&mdash;he whipped," she repeated, and, then, if Wapi
could have understood, he would have noted the tense pallor of her
lovely face and the look of a great fear that was away back in the
staring blue depths of her eyes.</p>

<p>From his pillow Peter Keith had seen the look of fear and the
paleness of her cheeks, but he was a long way from guessing the truth.
Yet he thought he knew. For days&mdash;yes, for weeks&mdash;there had
been that growing fear in her eyes. He had seen her mighty fight to
hide it from him. And he thought he understood.</p>

<p>"I know it has been a terrible winter for you, dear," he had said to
her many times. "But you mustn't worry so much about me. I'll be on my
feet again&mdash;soon." He had always emphasized that. "I'll be on my
feet again soon!"</p>

<p>Once, in the breaking terror of her heart, she had almost told him
the truth. Afterward she had thanked God for giving her the strength to
keep it back. It was day&mdash;for they spoke in terms of day and
night&mdash;when Rydal, half drunk, had dragged her into his cabin, and
she had fought him until her hair was down about her in tangled
confusion&mdash;and she had told Peter that it was the wind. After
that, instead of evading him, she had played Rydal with her wits, while
praying to God for help. It was impossible to tell Peter. He had aged
steadily and terribly in the last two weeks. His eyes were sunken into
deep pits. His blond hair was turning gray over the temples. His cheeks
were hollowed, and there was a different sort of luster in his eyes. He
looked fifty instead of thirty-five. Her heart bled in its agony. She
loved Peter with a wonderful love.</p>

<p>The truth! If she told him that! She could see Peter rising up out
of his bed like a ghost. It would kill him. If he could have seen
Rydal&mdash;only an hour before&mdash;stopping her out on the deck,
taking her in his arms, and kissing her until his drunken breath and
his beard sickened her! And if he could have heard what Rydal had said!
She shuddered. And suddenly she dropped down on her knees beside Wapi
and took his great head in her arms, unafraid of him&mdash;and glad
that he had come.</p>

<p>Then she turned to Peter. "I'm going ashore to see Blake
again&mdash;now," she said. "Wapi will go with me, and I won't be
afraid. I insist that I am right, so please don't object any more,
Peter dear."</p>

<p>She bent over and kissed him, and then in spite of his protest, put
on her fur coat and hood, and stood for a moment smiling down at him.
The fear was gone out of her eyes now. It was impossible for him not to
smile at her loveliness. He had always been proud of that. He reached
up a thin hand and plucked tenderly at the shining little tendrils of
gold that crept out from under her hood.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't, dear," he pleaded.</p>

<p>How pathetically white, and thin, and weak he was! She kissed him
again and turned quickly to hide the mist in her eyes. At the door she
blew him a kiss from the tip of her big fur mitten, and as she went out
she heard him say in the thin, strange voice that was so unlike the old
Peter:</p>

<p>"Don't be long, Dolores."</p>

<p>She stood silently for a few moments to make sure that no one would
see her. Then she moved swiftly to the ice bridge and out into the
star-lighted ghostliness of the night. Wapi followed close behind her,
and dropping a hand to her side she called softly to him. In an instant
Wapi's muzzle was against her mitten, and his great body quivered with
joy at her direct speech to him. She saw the response in his red eyes
and stopped to stroke him with both mittened hands, and over and over
again she spoke his name. "Wapi&mdash;Wapi&mdash;Wapi." He whined. She
could feel him under her touch as if alive with an electrical force.
Her eyes shone. In the white starlight there was a new emotion in her
face. She had found a friend, the one friend she and Peter had, and it
made her braver.</p>

<p>At no time had she actually been afraid&mdash;for herself. It was
for Peter. And she was not afraid now. Her cheeks flushed with exertion
and her breath came quickly as she neared Blake's cabin. Twice she had
made excuses to go ashore&mdash;just because she was curious, she had
said&mdash;and she believed that she had measured up Blake pretty well.
It was a case in which her woman's intuition had failed her miserably.
She was amazed that such a man had marooned himself voluntarily on the
arctic coast. She did not, of course, understand his
business&mdash;entirely. She thought him simply a trader. And he was
unlike any man aboard ship. By his carefully clipped beard, his calm,
cold manner of speech, and the unusual correctness with which he used
his words she was convinced that at some time or another he had been
part of what she mentally thought of as "an entirely different
environment."</p>

<p>She was right. There was a time when London and New York would have
given much to lay their hands on the man who now called himself
Blake.</p>

<p>Dolores, excited by the conviction that Blake would help her when he
heard her story, still did not lose her caution. Rydal had given her
another twenty-four hours, and that was all. In those twenty-four hours
she must fight out their salvation, her own and Peter's. If Blake
should fail&mdash;</p>

<p>Fifty paces from his cabin she stopped, slipped the big fur mitten
from her right hand and unbuttoned her coat so that she could quickly
and easily reach an inside pocket in which was Peter's revolver. She
smiled just a bit grimly, as her fingers touched the cold steel. It was
to be her last resort. And she was thinking in that flash of the days
"back home" when she was counted the best revolver shot at the Piping
Rock. She could beat Peter, and Peter was good. Her fingers twined a
bit fondly about the pearl-handled thing in her pocket. The last
resort&mdash;and from the first it had given her courage to keep the
truth from Peter!</p>

<p>She knocked at the heavy door of the igloo cabin. Blake was still
up, and when he opened it, he stared at her in wide-eyed amazement.
Wapi hung outside when Dolores entered, and the door closed. "I know
you think it strange for me to come at this hour," she apologized, "but
in this terrible gloom I've lost all count of hours. They have no
significance for me any more. And I wanted to see you&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>She emphasized the word. And as she spoke, she loosened her coat and
threw back her hood, so that the glow of the lamp lit up the ruffled
mass of gold the hood had covered. She sat down without waiting for an
invitation, and Blake sat down opposite her with a narrow table between
them. Her face was flushed with cold and wind as she looked at him. Her
eyes were blue with the blue of a steady flame, and they met his own
squarely. She was not nervous. Nor was she afraid.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can guess&mdash;why I have come?" she asked.</p>

<p>He was appraising her almost startling beauty with the lamp glow
flooding down on her. For a moment he hesitated; then he nodded,
looking at her steadily. "Yes, I think I know," he said quietly. "It's
Captain Rydal. In fact, I'm quite positive. It's an unusual situation,
you know. Have I guessed correctly?"</p>

<p>She nodded, drawing in her breath quickly and leaning a little
toward him, wondering how much he knew and how he had come by it.</p>

<p>"A very unusual situation," he repeated. "There's nothing in the
world that makes beasts out of men&mdash;most men&mdash;more quickly
than an arctic night, Mrs. Keith. And they're all beasts out
there&mdash;now&mdash;all except your husband, and he is contented
because he possesses the one white woman aboard ship. It's putting it
brutally plain, but it's the truth, isn't it? For the time being
they're beasts, every man of the twenty, and you&mdash;pardon
me!&mdash;are very beautiful. Rydal wants you, and the fact that your
husband is dying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is not dying," she interrupted him fiercely. "He shall not die!
If he did&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you love him?" There was no insult in Blake's quiet voice. He
asked the question as if much depended on the answer, as if he must
assure himself of that fact.</p>

<p>"Love him&mdash;my Peter? Yes!"</p>

<p>She leaned forward eagerly, gripping her hands in front of him on
the table. She spoke swiftly, as if she must convince him before he
asked her another question. Blake's eyes did not change. They had not
changed for an instant. They were hard, and cold, and searching,
unwarmed by her beauty, by the luster of her shining hair, by the touch
of her breath as it came to him over the table.</p>

<p>"I have gone everywhere with him&mdash;everywhere," she began.
"Peter writes books, you know, and we have gone into all sorts of
places. We love it&mdash;both of us&mdash;this adventuring. We have
been all through the country down there," she swept a hand to the
south, "on dog sledges, in canoes, with snowshoes, and pack-trains.
Then we hit on the idea of coming north on a whaler. You know, of
course, Captain Rydal planned to return this autumn. The crew was
rough, but we expected that. We expected to put up with a lot. But even
before the ice shut us in, before this terrible night came, Rydal
insulted me. I didn't dare tell Peter. I thought I could handle Rydal,
that I could keep him in his place, and I knew that if I told Peter, he
would kill the beast. And then the ice&mdash;and this night&mdash;" She
choked.</p>

<p>Blake's eyes, gimleting to her soul, were shot with a sudden fire as
he, too, leaned a little over the table. But his voice was unemotional
as rock. It merely stated a fact. "That's why Captain Rydal allowed
himself to be frozen in," he said. "He had plenty of time to get into
the open channels, Mrs. Keith. But he wanted you. And to get you he
knew he would have to lay over. And if he laid over, he knew that he
would get you, for many things may happen in an arctic night. It shows
the depth of the man's feelings, doesn't it? He is sacrificing a great
deal to possess you, losing a great deal of time, and money, and all
that. And when your husband dies&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her clenched little fist struck the table. "He won't die, I tell
you! Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;Rydal says he is going to die."</p>

<p>"Rydal&mdash;lies. Peter had a fall, and it hurt his spine so that
his legs are paralyzed. But I know what it is. If he could get away
from that ship and could have a doctor, he would be well again in two
or three months."</p>

<p>"But Rydal says he is going to die."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the significance of Blake's words this time.
Her eyes filled with sudden horror. Then they flashed with the blue
fire again. "So&mdash;he has told you? Well, he told me the same thing
today. He didn't intend to, of course. But he was half mad, and he had
been drinking. He has given me twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"In which to&mdash;surrender?"</p>

<p>There was no need to reply.</p>

<p>For the first time Blake smiled. There was something in that smile
that made her flesh creep. "Twenty-four hours is a short time," he
said, "and in this matter, Mrs. Keith, I think that you will find
Captain Rydal a man of his word. No need to ask you why you don't
appeal to the crew! Useless! But you have hope that I can help you? Is
that it?"</p>

<p>Her heart throbbed. "That is why I have come to you, Mr. Blake. You
told me today that Fort Confidence is only a hundred and fifty miles
away and that a Northwest Mounted Police garrison is there this
winter&mdash;with a doctor. Will you help me?"</p>

<p>"A hundred and fifty miles, in this country, at this time of the
year, is a long distance, Mrs. Keith," reflected Blake, looking into
her eyes with a steadiness that at any other time would have been
embarrassing. "It means the McFarlane, the Lacs Delesse, and the Arctic
Barren. For a hundred miles there isn't a stick of timber. If a storm
came&mdash;no man or dog could live. It is different from the coast.
Here there is shelter everywhere." He spoke slowly, and he was thinking
swiftly. "It would take five days at thirty miles a day. And the
chances are that your husband would not stand it. One hundred and
twenty hours at fifty degrees below zero, and no fire until the fourth
day. He would die."</p>

<p>"It would be better&mdash;for if we stay&mdash;" she stopped,
unclenching her hands slowly.</p>

<p>"What?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I shall kill Captain Rydal," she declared. "It is the only thing I
can do. Will you force me to do that, or will you help me? You have
sledges and many dogs, and we will pay. And I have judged you to
be&mdash;a man."</p>

<p>He rose from the table, and for a moment his face was turned from
her. "You probably do not understand my position, Mrs. Keith," he said,
pacing slowly back and forth and chuckling inwardly at the shock he was
about to give her. "You see, my livelihood depends on such men as
Captain Rydal. I have already done a big business with him in bone,
oil, pelts&mdash;and Eskimo women."</p>

<p>Without looking at her he heard the horrified intake of her breath.
It gave him a pleasing sort of thrill, and he turned, smiling, to look
into her dead-white face. Her eyes had changed. There was no longer
hope or entreaty in them. They were simply pools of blue flame. And
she, too, rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;I can expect&mdash;no help&mdash;from you."</p>

<p>"I didn't say that, Mrs. Keith. It shocks you to know that I am
responsible. But up here, you must understand the code of ethics is a
great deal different from yours. We figure that what I have done for
Rydal and his crew keeps sane men from going mad during the long months
of darkness. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to help you&mdash;and
Peter. I think I shall. But you must give me a little time in which to
consider the matter&mdash;say an hour or so. I understand that whatever
is to be done must be done quickly. If I make up my mind to take you to
Fort Confidence, we shall start within two or three hours. I shall
bring you word aboard ship. So you might return and prepare yourself
and Peter for a probable emergency."</p>

<p>She went out dumbly into the night, Blake seeing her to the door and
closing it after her. He was courteous in his icy way but did not offer
to escort her back to the ship. She was glad. Her heart was choking her
with hope and fear. She had measured him differently this time. And she
was afraid. She had caught a glimpse that had taken her beyond the man,
to the monster. It made her shudder. And yet what did it matter, if
Blake helped them?</p>

<p>She had forgotten Wapi. Now she found him again close at her side,
and she dropped a hand to his big head as she hurried back through the
pallid gloom. She spoke to him, crying out with sobbing breath what she
had not dared to reveal to Blake. For Wapi the long night had ceased to
be a hell of ghastly emptiness, and to her voice and the touch of her
hand he responded with a whine that was the whine of a white man's dog.
They had traveled two-thirds of the distance to the ship when he
stopped in his tracks and sniffed the wind that was coming from shore.
A second time he did this, and a third, and the third time Dolores
turned with him and faced the direction from which they had come. A low
growl rose in Wapi's throat, a snarl of menace with a note of warning
in it.</p>

<p>"What is it, Wapi?" whispered Dolores. She heard his long fangs
click, and under her hand she felt his body grow tense. "What is it?"
she repeated.</p>

<p>A thrill, a suspicion, shot into her heart as they went on. A fourth
time Wapi faced the shore and growled before they reached the ship.
Like shadows they went up over the ice bridge. Dolores did not enter
the cabin but drew Wapi behind it so they could not be seen. Ten
minutes, fifteen, and suddenly she caught her breath and fell down on
her knees beside Wapi, putting her arms about his gaunt shoulders. "Be
quiet," she whispered. "Be quiet."</p>

<p>Up out of the night came a dark and grotesque shadow. It paused
below the bridge, then it came on silently and passed almost without
sound toward the captain's quarters. It was Blake. Dolores' heart was
choking her. Her arms clutched Wapi, whispering for him to be quiet, to
be quiet. Blake disappeared, and she rose to her feet. She had come of
fighting stock. Peter was proud of that. "You slim wonderful little
thing!" he had said to her more than once. "You've a heart in that
pretty body of yours like the general's!" The general was her father,
and a fighter. She thought of Peter's words now, and the fighting blood
leaped through her veins. It was for Peter more than herself that she
was going to fight now.</p>

<p>She made Wapi understand that he must remain where he was. Then she
followed after Blake, followed until her ears were close to the door
behind which she could already hear Blake and Rydal talking.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later she returned to Wapi. Under her hood her face was
as white as the whitest star in the sky. She stood for many minutes
close to the dog, gathering her courage, marshaling her strength,
preparing herself to face Peter. He must not suspect until the last
moment. She thanked God that Wapi had caught the taint of Blake in the
air, and she was conscious of offering a prayer that God might help her
and Peter.</p>

<p>Peter gave a cry of pleasure when the door opened and Dolores
entered. He saw Wapi crowding in, and laughed. "Pals already! I guess I
needn't have been afraid for you. What a giant of a dog!"</p>

<p>The instant she appeared, Dolores forced upon herself an appearance
of joyous excitement. She flung off her coat and ran to Peter, hugging
his head against her as she told him swiftly what they were going to
do. Fort Confidence was only one hundred and fifty miles away, and a
garrison of police and a doctor were there. Five days on a sledge! That
was all. And she had persuaded Blake, the trader, to help them. They
would start now, as soon as she got him ready and Blake came. She must
hurry. And she was wildly and gloriously happy, she told him. In a
little while they would be at least on the outer edge of this horrible
night, and he would be in a doctor's hands.</p>

<p>She was holding Peter's head so that he could not see her face, and
by the time she jumped up and he did see it, there was nothing in it to
betray the truth or the fact that she was acting a lie. First she began
to dress Peter for the trail. Every instant gave her more courage. This
helpless, sunken-cheeked man with the hair graying over his temples was
Peter, her Peter, the Peter who had watched over her, and sheltered
her, and fought for her ever since she had known him, and now had come
her chance to fight for him. The thought filled her with a wonderful
exultation. It flushed her cheeks, and put a glory into her eyes, and
made her voice tremble. How wonderful it was to love a man as she loved
Peter! It was impossible for her to see the contrast they
made&mdash;Peter with his scrubby beard, his sunken cheeks, his
emaciation, and she with her radiant, golden beauty. She was ablaze
with the desire to fight. And how proud of her Peter would be when it
was all over!</p>

<p>She finished dressing him and began putting things in their big
dunnage sack. Her lips tightened as she made this preparation. Finally
she came to a box of revolver cartridges and emptied them into one of
the pockets of her under-jacket. Wapi flattened out near the door,
watched every movement she made.</p>

<p>When the dunnage sack was filled, she returned to Peter. "Won't it
be a joke on Captain Rydal!" she exulted. "You see, we aren't gong to
let him know anything about it." She appeared not to observe Peter's
surprise. "You know how I hate him, Peter dear," she went on. "He is a
beast. But Mr. Blake has done a great deal of trading with him, and he
doesn't want Captain Rydal to know the part he is taking in getting us
away. Not that Rydal would miss us, you know! I don't think he cares
very much whether you live or die, Peter, and that's why I hate him.
But we must humor Mr. Blake. He doesn't want him to know."</p>

<p>"Odd," mused Peter. "It's sort of&mdash;sneaking away."</p>

<p>His eyes had in them a searching question which Dolores tried not to
see and which she was glad he did not put into words. If she could only
fool him another hour&mdash;just one more hour.</p>

<p>It was less than that&mdash;half an hour after she had finished the
dunnage sack&mdash;when they heard footsteps crunching outside and then
a knock at the door. Wapi answered with a snarl, and when Dolores
opened the door and Blake entered, his eyes fell first of all on the
dog.</p>

<p>"Attached himself, eh?" he greeted, turning his quiet, unemotional
smile on Peter. "First white woman he has ever seen, and I guess the
case is hopeless. Mrs. Keith may have him."</p>

<p>He turned to her. "Are you ready?"</p>

<p>She nodded and pointed to the dunnage sack. Then she put on her fur
coat and hood and helped Peter sit up on the edge of the bed while
Blake opened the door again and made a low signal. Instantly Uppy and
another Eskimo came in. Blake led with the sack, and the two Eskimos
carried Peter. Dolores followed last, with the fingers of one little
hand gripped about the revolver in her pocket. Wapi hugged so close to
her that she could feel his body.</p>

<p>On the ice was a sledge without dogs. Peter was bundled on this, and
the Eskimos pulled him. Blake was still in the lead. Twenty minutes
after leaving the ship they pulled up beside his cabin.</p>

<p>There were two teams ready for the trail, one of six dogs, and
another of five, each watched over by an Eskimo. The visor of Dolores'
hood kept Blake from seeing how sharply she took in the situation.
Under it her eyes were ablaze. Her bare hand gripped her revolver, and
if Peter could have heard the beating of her heart, he would have
gasped. But she was cool, for all that. Swiftly and accurately she
appraised Blake's preparations. She observed that in the six-dog team,
in spite of its numerical superiority, the animals were more powerful
than those in the five-dog team. The Eskimos placed Peter on the
six-dog sledge, and Dolores helped to wrap him up warmly in the
bearskins. Their dunnage sack was tied on at Peter's feet. Not until
then did she seem to notice the five-dog sledge. She smiled at Blake.
"We must be sure that in our excitement we haven't forgotten
something," she said, going over what was on the sledge. "This is a
tent, and here are plenty of warm bearskins&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"
She looked up at Blake, who was watching her silently. "If there is no
timber for so long, Mr. Blake, shouldn't we have a big bundle of
kindling? And surely we should have meat for the dogs!"</p>

<p>Blake stared at her and then turned sharply on Uppy with a rattle of
Eskimo. Uppy and one of the companions made their exit instantly and in
great haste.</p>

<p>"The fools!" he apologized. "One has to watch them like children,
Mrs. Keith. Pardon me while I help them."</p>

<p>She waited until he followed Uppy into the cabin. Then, with the
remaining Eskimo staring at her in wonderment, she carried an extra
bearskin, the small tent, and a narwhal grub-sack to Peter's sledge. It
was another five minutes before Blake and the two Eskimos reappeared
with a bag of fish and a big bundle of ship-timber kindlings. Dolores
stood with a mittened hand on Peter's shoulder, and bending down, she
whispered:</p>

<p>"Peter, if you love me, don't mind what I'm going to say now. Don't
move, for everything is going to be all right, and if you should try to
get up or roll off the sledge, it would be so much harder for me. I
haven't even told you why we're going to Port Confidence. Now you'll
know!"</p>

<p>She straightened up to face Blake. She had chosen her position, and
Blake was standing clear and unshadowed in the starlight half a dozen
paces from her. She had thrust her hood back a little, inspired by her
feminine instinct to let him see her contempt for him.</p>

<p>"You beast!"</p>

<p>The words hissed hot and furious from her lips, and in that same
instant Blake found himself staring straight into the unquivering
muzzle of her revolver.</p>

<p>"You beast!" she repeated. "I ought to kill you. I ought to shoot
you down where you stand, for you are a cur and a coward. I know what
you have planned. I followed you when you went to Rydal's cabin a
little while ago, and I heard everything that passed between you.
Listen, Peter, and I'll tell you what these brutes were going to do
with us. You were to go with the six-dog team and I with the five, and
out on the barrens we were to become separated, you to go on and be
killed when you we're a proper distance away, and I to be brought
back&mdash;to Rydal. Do you understand, Peter dear? Isn't it splendid
that we should have forced on us like this such wonderful material for
a story!"</p>

<p>She was gloriously unafraid now. A paean of triumph rang in her
voice, triumph, contempt, and utter fearlessness. Her mittened hand
pressed on Peter's shoulder, and before the weapon in her other hand
Blake stood as if turned into stone.</p>

<p>"You don't know," she said, speaking to him directly, "how near I am
to killing you. I think I shall shoot unless you have the meat and
kindlings put on Peter's sledge immediately and give Uppy
instructions&mdash;in English&mdash;to drive us to Fort Confidence.
Peter and I will both go with the six-dog sledge. Give the instructions
quickly, Mr. Blake!"</p>

<p>Blake, recovering from the shock she had given him, flashed back at
her his cool and cynical smile. In spite of being caught in an
unpleasant lie, he admired this golden-haired, blue-eyed slip of a
woman for the colossal bluff she was playing. "Personally, I'm sorry,"
he said, "but I couldn't help it. Rydal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am sure, unless you give the instructions quickly, that I shall
shoot," she interrupted him. Her voice was so quiet that Peter was
amazed. "I'm sorry, Mrs. Keith. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>A flash of fire blinded him, and with the flash Blake staggered back
with a cry of pain and stood swaying unsteadily in the starlight,
clutching with one hand at an arm which hung limp and useless at his
side.</p>

<p>"That time, I broke your arm," said Dolores, with scarcely more
excitement than if she had made a bull's-eye on the Piping Rock range.
"If I fire again, I am quite positive that I shall kill you!"</p>

<p>The Eskimos had not moved. They were like three lifeless, staring
gargoyles. For another second or two Blake stood clutching at his arm.
Then he said,</p>

<p>"Uppy, put the dog meat and the kindlings on the big
sledge&mdash;and drive like hell for Fort Confidence!" And then, before
she could stop him, he followed up his words swiftly and furiously in
Eskimo.</p>

<p>"Stop!"</p>

<p>She almost shrieked the one word of warning, and with it a second
shot burned its way through the flesh of Blake's shoulder and he went
down. The revolver turned on Uppy, and instantly he was electrified
into life. Thirty seconds later, at the head of the team, he was
leading the way out into the chaotic gloom of the night. Hovering over
Peter, riding with her hand on the gee-bar of the sledge, Dolores
looked back to see Blake staggering to his feet. He shouted after them,
and what he said was in Uppy's tongue. And this time she could not stop
him.</p>

<p>She had forgotten Wapi. But as the night swallowed them up, she
still looked back, and through the gloom she saw a shadow coming
swiftly. In a few moments Wapi was running at the tail of the sledge.
Then she leaned over Peter and encircled his shoulders with her furry
arms.</p>

<p>"We're off!" she cried, a breaking note of gladness in her voice.
"We're off! And, Peter dear, wasn't it perfectly thrilling!"</p>

<p>A few minutes later she called upon Uppy to stop the team. Then she
faced him, close to Peter, with the revolver in her hand.</p>

<p>"Uppy," she demanded, speaking slowly and distinctly, "what was it
Blake said to you?"</p>

<p>For a moment Uppy made as if to feign stupidity. The revolver
covered a spot half-way between his narrow-slit eyes.</p>

<p>"I shall shoot&mdash;"</p>

<p>Uppy gave a choking gasp. "He said&mdash;no take trail For'
Con'dence&mdash;go wrong&mdash;he come soon get you."</p>

<p>"Yes, he said just that." She picked her words even more slowly.
"Uppy, listen to me. If you let them come up with us&mdash;unless you
get us to Fort Confidence&mdash;I will kill you. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>She poked her revolver a foot nearer, and Uppy nodded emphatically.
She smiled. It was almost funny to see Uppy's understanding liven up at
the point of the gun, and she felt a thrill that tingled to her
finger-tips. The little devils of adventure were wide-awake in her,
and, smiling at Uppy, she told him to hold up the end of his driving
whip. He obeyed. The revolver flashed, and a muffled yell came from him
as he felt the shock of the bullet as it struck fairly against the butt
of his whip. In the same instant there came a snarling deep-throated
growl from Wapi. From the sledge Peter gave a cry of warning. Uppy
shrank back, and Dolores cried out sharply and put herself swiftly
between Wapi and the Eskimo. The huge dog, ready to spring, slunk back
to the end of the sledge at the command of her voice. She patted his
big head before she got on the sledge behind Peter.</p>

<p>There was no indecision in the manner of Uppy'S going now. He struck
out swift and straight for the pale constellation of stars that hung
over Fort Confidence. It was splendid traveling. The surface of the
arctic plain was frozen solid. What little wind there was came from
behind them, and the dogs were big and fresh. Uppy ran briskly,
snapping the lash of his whip and la-looing to the dogs in the manner
of the Eskimo driver. Dolores did not wait for Peter's demand for a
further explanation of their running away and her remarkable words to
Blake. She told him. She omitted, for the sake of Peter's peace of
mind, the physical insults she had suffered at Captain Rydal's hands.
She did not tell him that Rydal had forced her into his arms a few
hours before and kissed her. What she did reveal made Peter's arms and
shoulders grow tense and he groaned in his helplessness.</p>

<p>"If you'd only told me!" he protested. Dolores laughed triumphantly,
with her arm about his shoulder. "I knew my dear old Peter too well for
that," she exulted. "If I had told you, what a pretty mess we'd be in
now, Peter! You would have insisted on calling Captain Rydal into our
cabin and shooting him from the bed&mdash;and then where would we have
been? Don't you think I'm handling it pretty well, Peter dear?"</p>

<p>Peter's reply was smothered against her hooded cheek.</p>

<p>He began to question her more directly now, and with his ability to
grasp at the significance of things he pointed out quickly the
tremendous hazard of their position. There were many more dogs and
other sledges at Blake's place, and it was utterly inconceivable that
Blake and Captain Rydal would permit them to reach Fort Confidence
without making every effort in their power to stop them. Once they
succeeded in placing certain facts in the hands of the Mounted Police,
both Rydal and Blake would be done for. He impressed this uncomfortable
truth on Dolores and suggested that if she could have smuggled a rifle
along in the dunnage sack it would have helped matters considerably.
For Rydal and Blake would not hesitate at shooting. For them it must be
either capture or kill&mdash;death for him, anyway, for he was the one
factor not wanted in the equation. He summed up their chances and their
danger calmly and pointedly, as he always looked at troubling things.
And Dolores felt her heart sinking within her. After all, she had not
handled the situation any too well. She almost wished she had killed
Rydal herself and called it self-defense. At least she had been
criminally negligent in not smuggling along a rifle.</p>

<p>"But we'll beat them out," she argued hopefully. "We've got a
splendid team, Peter, and I'll take off my coat and run behind the
sledge as much as I can. Uppy won't dare play a trick on us now, for he
knows that if I should miss him, Wapi would tear the life out of him at
a word from me. We'll win out, Peter dear. See if we don't!"</p>

<p>Peter hugged his thoughts to himself. He did not tell her that Blake
and Rydal would pursue with a ten- or twelve-dog team, and that there
was almost no chance at all of a straight get-away. Instead, he pulled
her head down and kissed her.</p>

<p>To Wapi there had come at last a response to the great yearning that
was in him. Instinct, summer and winter, had drawn him south, had
turned him always in that direction, filled with the uneasiness of the
mysterious something that was calling to him through the years of forty
generations of his kind. And now he was going south. He sensed the fact
that this journey would not end at the edge of the Arctic plain and
that he was not to hunt caribou or bear. His mental formulae
necessitated no process of reasoning. They were simple and to the point
His world had suddenly divided itself into two parts; one contained the
woman, and the other his old masters and slavery. And the woman stood
against these masters. They were her enemies as well as his own.
Experience had taught him the power and the significance of firearms,
just as it had made him understand the uses for which spears, and
harpoons, and whips were made. He had seen the woman shoot Blake, and
he had seen her ready to shoot at Uppy. Therefore he understood that
they were enemies and that all associated with them were enemies. At a
word from her he was ready to spring ahead and tear the life out of the
Eskimo driver and even out of the dogs that were pulling the sledge. It
did not take him long to comprehend that the man on the sledge was a
part of the woman.</p>

<p>He hung well back, twenty or thirty paces behind the sledge, and
unless Peter or the woman called to him, or the sledge stopped for some
reason, he seldom came nearer.</p>

<p>It took only a word from Dolores to bring him to her side.</p>

<p>Hour after hour the journey continued. The plain was level as a
floor, and at intervals Dolores would run in the trail that the load
might be lightened and the dogs might make better time. It was then
that Peter watched Uppy with the revolver, and it was also in these
intervals&mdash;running close beside the woman&mdash;that the blood in
Wapi's veins was fired with a riotous joy.</p>

<p>For three hours there was almost no slackening in Uppy's speed. The
fourth and fifth were slower. In the sixth and seventh the pace began
to tell. And the plain was no longer hard and level, swept like a floor
by the polar winds. Rolling undulations grew into ridges of snow and
ice; in places the dogs dragged the sledge over thin crusts that broke
under the runners; fields of drift snow, fine as shot, lay in their
way; and in the eighth hour Uppy stopped the lagging dogs and held up
his two hands in the mute signal of the Eskimo that they could go no
farther without a rest.</p>

<p>Wapi dropped on his belly and watched. His eyes followed Uppy
suspiciously as he strung up the tent on its whalebone supports to keep
the bite of the wind from the sledge on which Dolores sat at Peter's
feet. Then Uppy built a fire of kindlings, and scraped up a pot of ice
for tea-water. After that, while the water was heating, he gave each of
the trace dogs a frozen fish. Dolores herself picked out one of the
largest and tossed it to Wapi. Then she sat down again and began to
talk to Peter, bundled up in his furs. After a time they ate, and drank
hot tea, and after he had devoured a chunk of raw meat the size of his
two fists, Uppy rolled himself in his sleeping bag near the dogs. A
little at a time Wapi dragged himself nearer until his head lay on
Dolores' coat. After that there was a long silence broken only by the
low voices of the woman and the man, and the heavy breathing of the
tired dogs. Wapi himself dozed off, but never for long. Then Dolores
nodded, and her head drooped until it found a pillow on Peter's
shoulder. Gently Peter drew a bearskin about her, and for a long time
sat wide-awake, guarding Uppy and baring his ears at intervals to
listen. A dozen times he saw Wapi's bloodshot eyes looking at him, and
twice he put out a hand to the dog's head and spoke to him in a
whisper.</p>

<p>Even Peter's eyes were filmed by a growing drowsiness when Wapi drew
silently away and slunk suspiciously into the night. There was no
yapping foxes here, forty miles from the coast. An almost appalling
silence hung under the white stars, a silence broken only by the low
and distant moaning the wind always makes on the barrens. Wapi listened
to it, and he sniffed with his gray muzzle turned to the north. And
then he whined. Had Dolores or Peter seen him or heard the note in his
throat, they, too, would have stared back over the trail they had
traveled. For something was coming to Wapi. Faint, elusive, and
indefinable breath in the air, he smelled it in one moment, and the
next it was gone. For many minutes he stood undecided, and then he
returned to the sledge, his spine bristling and a growl in his
throat.</p>

<p>Wide-eyed and staring, Peter was looking back. "What is it,
Wapi?"</p>

<p>His voice aroused Dolores. She sat up with a start. The growl had
grown into a snarl in Wapi's throat.</p>

<p>"I think they are coming," said Peter calmly. "You'd better rouse
Uppy. He hasn't moved in the last two hours."</p>

<p>Something that was like a sob came from Dolores' lips as she stood
up. "They're not coming," she whispered. "They've stopped&mdash;and
they're building a fire!"</p>

<p>Not more than a third of a mile away a point of yellow flame flared
up in the night.</p>

<p>"Give me the revolver, Peter."</p>

<p>Peter gave it to her without a word. She went to Uppy, and at the
touch of her foot he was out of his sleeping-bag, his moon-face staring
at her. She pointed back to the fire. Her face was dead white. The
revolver was pointed straight at Uppy's heart.</p>

<p>"If they come up with us, Uppy&mdash;you die!"</p>

<p>The Eskimo's narrow eyes widened. There was murder in this white
woman's face, in the steadiness of her hand, and in her voice. If they
came up with them&mdash;he would die! Swiftly he gathered up his
sleeping-bag and placed it on the sledge. Then he roused the dogs,
tangled in their traces. They rose to their feet, sleepy and
ill-humored. One of them snapped at his hand. Another snarled viciously
as he untwisted a trace. Then one of the yawning brutes caught the new
smell in the air, the smell that Wapi had gathered when it was a mile
farther off. He sniffed. He sat back on his haunches and sent forth a
yelping howl to his comrades in the other team. In ten seconds the
other five were howling with him, and scarcely had the tumult burst
from their throats when there came a response from the fire half a mile
away.</p>

<p>"My God!" gasped Peter, under his breath.</p>

<p>Dolores sprang to the gee-bar, and Uppy lashed his long whip until
it cracked like a repeating rifle over the pack. The dogs responded and
sped through the night. Behind them the pandemonium of dog voices in
the other camp had ceased. Men had leaped into life. Fifteen dogs were
straightening in the tandem trace of a single sledge.</p>

<p>Dolores laughed, a sobbing, broken laugh, that in itself was a cry
of despair. "Peter, if they come up with us, what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"If they overtake us," said Peter, "give me the revolver. It is
fully loaded?"</p>

<p>"I have cartridges&mdash;"</p>

<p>For the first time she remembered that she had not filled the three
empty chambers. Crooking her arm under the gee-bar, she fumbled in her
pocket. The dogs, refreshed by their sleep and urged by Uppy's whip,
were tearing off the first mile at a great speed. The trail ahead of
them was level and hard again. Uppy knew they were on the edge of the
big barren of the Lacs Delesse, and he cracked his whip just as the off
runner of the sledge struck a hidden snow-blister. There was a sudden
lurch, and in a vicious up-shoot of the gee-bar the revolver was
knocked from Dolores' hand&mdash;and was gone. A shriek rose to her
lips, but she stifled it before it was given voice. Until this minute
she had not felt the terror of utter hopelessness upon her. Now it made
her faint. The revolver had not only given her hope, but also a
steadfast faith in herself. From the beginning she had made up her mind
how she would use it in the end, even though a few moments before she
had asked Peter what they would do.</p>

<p>Crumpled down on the sledge, she clung to Peter, and suddenly the
inspiration came to her not to let him know what had happened. Her arms
tightened about his shoulders, and she looked ahead over the backs of
the wolfish pack, shivering as she thought of what Uppy would do could
he guess her loss. But he was running now for his life, driven on by
his fear of her unerring marksmanship&mdash;and Wapi. She looked over
her shoulder. Wapi was there, a huge gray shadow twenty paces behind.
And she thought she heard a shout!</p>

<p>Peter was speaking to her. "Blake's dogs are tired," he was saying.
"They were just about to camp, and ours have had a rest.
Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We shall beat them!" she interrupted him. "See how fast we are
going, Peter! It is splendid!"</p>

<p>A rifle-shot sounded behind them. It was not far away, and
involuntarily she clutched him tighter. Peter reached up a hand.</p>

<p>"Give me the revolver, Dolores."</p>

<p>"No," she protested. "They are not going to overtake us."</p>

<p>"You must give me the revolver," he insisted.</p>

<p>"Peter, I can't. You understand, I can't. I must keep the
revolver."</p>

<p>She looked back again. There was no doubt now. Their pursuers were
drawing nearer. She heard a voice, the la-looing of running Eskimos, a
faint shout which she knew was a white man's shout&mdash;and another
rifle shot. Wapi was running nearer. He was almost at the tail of the
sledge, and his red eyes were fixed on her as he ran.</p>

<p>"Wapi!" she cried. "Wapi!"</p>

<p>His jaws dropped agape. She could hear his panting response to her
voice.</p>

<p>A third shot&mdash;over their heads sped a strange droning
sound.</p>

<p>"Wapi," she almost screamed, "go back! Sick 'em, Wapi&mdash;sick
'em&mdash;sick 'em&mdash;sick 'em!" She flung out her arms, driving him
back, repeating the words over and over again. She leaned over the edge
of the sledge, clinging to the gee-bar. "Go back, Wapi! Sick
'em&mdash;sick 'em&mdash;sick 'em!"</p>

<p>As if in response to her wild exhortation, there came a sudden
yelping outcry from the team behind. It was close upon them now.
Another ten minutes.</p>

<p>And then she saw that Wapi was dropping behind. Quickly he was
swallowed up in the starlit chaos of the night.</p>

<p>"Peter," she cried, sobbingly. "Peter!"</p>

<p>Listening to the retreating sound of the sledge, Wapi stood a silent
shadow in the trail. Then he turned and faced the north. He heard the
other sound now, and ahead of it the wind brought him a smell, the
smell of things he hated. For many years something had been fighting
itself toward understanding within him, and the yelping of dogs and the
taint in the air of creatures who had been his slave-masters narrowed
his instinct to the one vital point. Again it was not a process of
reason but the cumulative effect of things that had happened, and were
happening. He had scented menace when first he had given warning of the
nearness of pursuers, and this menace was no longer an elusive and
unseizable thing that had merely stirred the fires of his hatred. It
was now a near and physical fact. He had tried to run away from
it&mdash;with the woman&mdash;but it had followed and was overtaking
him, and the yelping dogs were challenging him to fight as they had
challenged him from the day he was old enough to take his own part. And
now he had something to fight for. His intelligence gripped the fact
that one sledge was running away from the other, and that the sledge
which was running away was his sledge&mdash;and that for his sledge he
must fight.</p>

<p>He waited, almost squarely in the trail. There was no longer the
slinking, club-driven attitude of a creature at bay in the manner in
which he stood in the path of his enemies. He had risen out of his
serfdom. The stinging slash of the whip and his dread of it were gone.
Standing there in the starlight with his magnificent head thrown up and
the muscles of his huge body like corded steel, the passing spirit of
Shan Tung would have taken him for Tao, the Great Dane. He was not
excited&mdash;and yet he was filled with a mighty desire&mdash;more
than that, a tremendous purpose. The yelping excitement of the oncoming
Eskimo dogs no longer urged him to turn aside to avoid their insolent
bluster, as he would have turned aside yesterday or the day before. The
voices of his old masters no longer sent him slinking out of their way,
a growl in his throat and his body sagging with humiliation and the
rage of his slavery. He stood like a rock, his broad chest facing them
squarely, and when he saw the shadows of them racing up out of the
star-mist an eighth of a mile away, it was not a growl but a whine that
rose in his throat, a whine of low and repressed eagerness, of a great
yearning about to be fulfilled. Two hundred yards&mdash;a
hundred&mdash;eighty&mdash;not until the dogs were less than fifty from
him did he move. And then, like a rock hurled by a mighty force, he was
at them.</p>

<p>He met the onrushing weight of the pack breast to breast. There was
no warning. Neither men nor dogs had seen the waiting shadow. The crash
sent the lead-dog back with Wapi's great fangs in his throat, and in an
instant the fourteen dogs behind had piled over them, tangled in their
traces, yelping and snarling and biting, while over them round-faced,
hooded men shouted shrilly and struck with their whips, and from the
sledge a white man sprang with a rifle in his hands. It was Rydal.
Under the mass of dogs Wapi, the Walrus, heard nothing of the shouts of
men. He was fighting. He was fighting as he had never fought before in
all the days of his life. The fierce little Eskimo dogs had smelled
him, and they knew their enemy. The lead-dog was dead. A second Wapi
had disemboweled with a single slash of his inch-long fangs. He was
buried now. But his jaws met flesh and bone, and out of the squirming
mass there rose fearful cries of agony that mingled hideously with the
bawling of men and the snarling and yelping of beasts that had not yet
felt Wapi's fangs. Three and four at a time they were at him. He felt
the wolfish slash of their teeth in his flesh. In him the sense of pain
was gone. His jaws closed on a foreleg, and it snapped like a stick.
His teeth sank like ivory knives into the groin of a brute that had
torn a hole in his side, and a smothered death-howl rose out of the
heap. A fang pierced his eye. Even then no cry came from Wapi, the
Walrus. He heaved upward with his giant body. He found another throat,
and it was then that he rose above the pack, shaking the life from his
victim as a terrier would have shaken a rat. For the first time the
Eskimos saw him, and out of their superstitious souls strange cries
found utterance as they sprang back and shrieked out to Rydal that it
was a devil and not a beast that had waited for them in the trail.
Rydal threw up his rifle. The shot came. It burned a crease in Wapi's
shoulder and tore a hole as big as a man's fist in the breast of a dog
about to spring upon him f rom behind. Again he was down, and Rydal
dropped his rifle, and snatched a whip from the hand of an Eskimo.
Shouting and cursing, he lashed the pack, and in a moment he saw a
huge, open-jawed shadow rise up on the far side and start off into the
open starlight. He sprang back to his rifle. Twice he fired at the
retreating shadow before it disappeared. And the Eskimo dogs made no
movement to follow. Five of the fifteen were dead. The remaining ten,
torn and bleeding&mdash;three of them with legs that dragged in the
bloody snow&mdash;gathered in a whipped and whimpering group. And the
Eskimos, shivering in their fear of this devil that had entered into
the body of Wapi, the Walrus, failed to respond to Rydal's command when
he pointed to the red trail that ran out under the stars.</p>

<p>At Fort Confidence, one hundred and fifty miles to the south, there
was day&mdash;day that was like cold, gray dawn, the day one finds just
beyond the edge of the Arctic night, in which the sun hangs like a pale
lantern over the far southern horizon. In a log-built room that faced
this bit of glorious red glow lay Peter, bolstered up in his bed so
that he could see it until it faded from the sky. There was a new light
in his face, and there was something of the old Peter back in his eyes.
Watching the final glow with him was Dolores. It was their second
day.</p>

<p>Into this world, in the twilight that was falling swiftly as they
watched the setting of the sun, came Wapi, the Walrus. Blinded in the
eye, gaunt with hunger and exhaustion, covered with wounds, and with
his great heart almost ready to die, he came at last to the river
across which lay the barracks. His vision was nearly gone, but under
his nose he could still smell faintly the trail he was following until
the last. It led him across the river. And in darkness it brought him
to a door.</p>

<p>After a little the door opened, and with its opening came at last
the fulfilment of the promise of his dreams&mdash;hope, happiness,
things to live for in a new, a white-man's world. For Wapi, the Walrus,
forty years removed from Tao of Vancouver, had at last come home.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_3">THE YELLOW-BACK</a></h3>

<p>Above God's Lake, where the Bent Arrow runs red as pale blood under
its crust of ice, Reese Beaudin heard of the dog auction that was to
take place at Post Lac Bain three days later. It was in the cabin of
Joe Delesse, a trapper, who lived at Lac Bain during the summer, and
trapped the fox and the lynx sixty miles farther north in this month of
February.</p>

<p>"Diantre, but I tell you it is to be the greatest sale of dogs that
has ever happened at Lac Bain!" said Delesse. "To this Wakao they are
coming from all the four directions. There will be a hundred dogs,
huskies, and malamutes, and Mackenzie hounds, and mongrels from the
south, and I should not wonder if some of the little Eskimo devils were
brought from the north to be sold as breeders. Surely you will not miss
it, my friend?"</p>

<p>"I am going by way of Post Lac Bain," replied Reese Beaudin
equivocally.</p>

<p>But his mind was not on the sale of dogs. From his pipe he puffed
out thick clouds of smoke, and his eyes narrowed until they seemed like
coals peering out of cracks; and he said, in his quiet, soft voice:</p>

<p>"Do you know of a man named Jacques Dupont, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>Joe Delesse tried to peer through the cloud of smoke at Reese
Beaudin's face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know him. Does he happen to be a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>Reese laughed softly.</p>

<p>"I have heard of him. They say that he is a devil. To the west I was
told that he can whip any man between Hudson's Bay and the Great Bear,
that he is a beast in man-shape, and that he will surely be at the big
sale at Lac Bain."</p>

<p>On his knees the huge hands of Joe Delesse clenched slowly, gripping
in their imaginary clutch a hated thing.</p>

<p>"Oui, I know him," he said. "I know also&mdash;Elise&mdash;his wife.
See!"</p>

<p>He thrust suddenly his two huge knotted hands through the smoke that
drifted between him and the stranger who had sought the shelter of his
cabin that night.</p>

<p>"See&mdash;I am a man full-grown, m'sieu&mdash;a man&mdash;and yet I
am afraid of him! That is how much of a devil and a beast in man-shape
he is."</p>

<p>Again Reese Beaudin laughed in his low, soft voice.</p>

<p>"And his wife, mon ami? Is she afraid of him?"</p>

<p>He had stopped smoking. Joe Delesse saw his face. The stranger's
eyes made him look twice and think twice.</p>

<p>"You have known her&mdash;sometime?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a long time ago. "We were children together. And I have heard
all has not gone well with her. Is it so?"</p>

<p>"Does it go well when a dove is mated to a vulture, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>"I have also heard that she grew up to be very beautiful," said
Reese Beaudin, "and that Jacques Dupont killed a man for her. If that
is so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not so," interrupted Delesse. "He drove another man
away&mdash;no, not a man, but a yellow-livered coward who had no more
fight in him than a porcupine without quills! And yet she says he was
not a coward. She has always said, even to Dupont, that it was the way
le Bon Dieu made him, and that because he was made that way he was
greater than all other men in the North Country. How do I know?
Because, m'sieu, I am Elise Dupont's cousin."</p>

<p>Delesse wondered why Reese Beaudin's eyes were glowing like living
coals.</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;again, it is only rumor I have heard&mdash;they say
this man, whoever he was, did actually run away, like a dog that had
been whipped and was afraid to return to its kennel."</p>

<p>"Pst!" Joe Delesse flung his great arms wide. "Like that&mdash;he
was gone. And no one ever saw him again, or heard of him again. But I
know that she knew&mdash;my cousin, Elise. What word it was he left for
her at the last she has always kept in her own heart, mon Dieu, and
what a wonderful thing he had to fight for! You knew the child. But the
woman&mdash;non? She was like an angel. Her eyes, when you looked into
them&mdash;hat can I say, m'sieu? They made you forget. And I have seen
her hair, unbound, black and glossy as the velvet side of a sable,
covering her to the hips. And two years ago I saw Jacques Dupont's
hands in that hair, and he was dragging her by it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something snapped. It was a muscle in Reese Beaudin's arm. He had
stiffened like iron.</p>

<p>"And you let him do that!"</p>

<p>Joe Delesse shrugged his shoulders. It was a shrug of hopelessness,
of disgust.</p>

<p>"For the third time I interfered, and for the third time Jacques
Dupont beat me until I was nearer dead than alive. And since then I
have made it none of my business. It was, after all, the fault of the
man who ran away. You see, m'sieu, it was like this: Dupont was mad for
her, and this man who ran away&mdash;the Yellow-back&mdash;wanted her,
and Elise loved the Yellow-back. This Yellow-back was twenty-three or
four, and he read books, and played a fiddle and drew strange
pictures&mdash;and was weak in the heart when it came to a fight. But
Elise loved him. She loved him for those very things that made him a
fool and a weakling, m'sieu, the books and the fiddle and the pictures;
and she stood up with the courage for them both. And she would have
married him, too, and would have fought for him with a club if it had
come to that, when the thing happened that made him run away. It was at
the midsummer carnival, when all the trappers and their wives and
children were at Lac Bain. And Dupont followed the Yellow-back about
like a dog. He taunted him, he insulted him, he got down on his knees
and offered to fight him without getting on his feet; and there, before
the very eyes of Elise, he washed the Yellow-back's face in the grease
of one of the roasted caribou! And the Yellow-back was a man! Yes, a
grown man! And it was then that Jacques Dupont shouted out his
challenge to all that crowd. He would fight the Yellow-back. He would
fight him with his right arm tied behind his back! And before Elise and
the Yellow-back, and all that crowd, friends tied his arm so that it
was like a piece of wood behind him, and it was his right arm, his
fighting arm, the better half of him that was gone. And even then the
Yellow-back was as white as the paper he drew pictures on. Ventre saint
gris, but then was his chance to have killed Jacques Dupont! Half a man
could have done it. Did he, m'sieu? No, he did not. With his one arm
and his one hand Jacques Dupont whipped that Yellow-back, and he would
have killed him if Elise had not rushed in to sav e the Yellow-back's
purple face from going dead black. And that night the Yellow-back slunk
away. Shame? Yes. From that night he was ashamed to show his face ever
again at Lac Bain. And no one knows where he went. No one&mdash;except
Elise. And her secret is in her own breast."</p>

<p>"And after that?" questioned Reese Beaudin, in a voice that was
scarcely above a whisper.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand," said Joe Delesse. "It was strange, m'sieu,
very strange. I know that Elise, even after that coward ran away, still
loved him. And yet&mdash;well, something happened. I overheard a
terrible quarrel one day between Jan Thiebout, father of Elise, and
Jacques Dupont. After that Thiebout was very much afraid of Dupont. I
have my own suspicion. Now that Thiebout is dead it is not wrong for me
to say what it is. I think Thiebout killed the halfbreed Bedore who was
found dead on his trap-line five years ago. There was a feud between
them. And Dupont, discovering Thiebout's secret&mdash;well, you can
understand how easy it would be after that, m'sieu. Thiebout's winter
trapping was in that Burntwood country, fifty miles from neighbor to
neighbor, and very soon after Bedore's death Jacques Dupont became
Thiebout's partner. I know that Elise was forced to marry him. That was
four years ago. The next year old Thiebout died, and in all that time
not once has Elise been to Post Lac Bain!"</p>

<p>"Like the Yellow-back&mdash;she never returned," breathed Reese
Beaudin.</p>

<p>"Never. And now&mdash;it is strange&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is strange, Joe Delesse?"</p>

<p>"That for the first time in all these years she is going to Lac
Bain&mdash;to the dog sale."</p>

<p>Reese Beaudin's face was again hidden in the smoke of his pipe.
Through it his voice came.</p>

<p>"It is a cold night, M'sieu Delesse. Hear the wind howl!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is cold&mdash;so cold the foxes will not run. My traps and
poison-baits will need no tending tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Unless you dig them out of the drifts."</p>

<p>"I will stay in the cabin."</p>

<p>"What! You are not going to Lac Bain!"</p>

<p>"I doubt it."</p>

<p>"Even though Elise, your cousin, is to be there?"</p>

<p>"I have no stomach for it, m'sieu. Nor would you were you in my
boots, and did you know why he is going. Par les mille cornes d'u
diable, I cannot whip him but I can kill him&mdash;and if I
went&mdash;and the thing happens which I guess is going to
happen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Qui? Surely you will tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will tell you. Jacques Dupont knows that Elise has never
stopped loving the Yellow-back. I do not believe she has ever tried to
hide it from him. Why should she? And there is a rumor, m'sieu, that
the Yellow-back will be at the Lac Bain dog sale."</p>

<p>Reese Beaudin rose slowly to his feet, and yawned in that
smoke-filled cabin.</p>

<p>"And if the Yellow-back should turn the tables, Joe Delesse, think
of what a fine thing you will miss," he said.</p>

<p>Joe Delesse also rose, with a contemptuous laugh.</p>

<p>"That fiddler, that picture-drawer, that book-reader&mdash;Pouff!
You are tired, m'sieu, that is your bunk."</p>

<p>Reese Beaudin held out a hand. The bulk of the two stood out in the
lamp-glow, and Joe Delesse was so much the bigger man that his hand was
half again the size of Reese Beaudin's. They gripped. And then a
strange look went over the face of Joe Delesse. A cry came from out of
his beard. His mouth grew twisted. His knees doubled slowly under him,
and in the space of ten seconds his huge bulk was kneeling on the
floor, while Reese Beaudin looked at him, smiling.</p>

<p>"Has Jacques Dupont a greater grip than that, Joe Delesse?" he asked
in a voice that was so soft it was almost a woman's.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" gasped Delesse. He staggered to his feet, clutching his
crushed hand. "M'sieu&mdash;"</p>

<p>Reese Beaudin put his hands to the other's shoulders, smiling,
friendly.</p>

<p>"I will apologize, I will explain, mon ami," he said. "But first,
you must tell me the name of that Yellow-back who ran away years ago.
Do you remember it?"</p>

<p>"Oui, but what has that to do with my crushed hand? The
Yellow-back's name was Reese Beaudin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I am Reese Beaudin," laughed the other gently.</p>

<p>On that day&mdash;the day of Wakoa, the dog sale&mdash;seven fat
caribou were roasting on great spits at Post Lac Bain, and under them
were seven fires burning red and hot of seasoned birch, and around the
seven fires were seven groups of men who slowly turned the roasting
carcasses.</p>

<p>It was the Big Day of the mid-winter festival, and Post Lac Bain,
with a population of twenty in times of quiet, was a seething
wilderness metropolis of two hundred excited souls and twice as many
dogs. From all directions they had come, from north and south and east
and west; from near and from far, from the Barrens, from the swamps,
from the farther forests, from river and lake and hidden trail&mdash;a
few white men, mostly French; half-breeds and 'breeds, Chippewans, and
Crees, and here and there a strange, dark-visaged little interloper
from the north with his strain of Eskimo blood. Foregathered were all
the breeds and creeds and fashions of the wilderness.</p>

<p>Over all this, pervading the air like an incense, stirring the
desire of man and beast, floated the aroma of the roasting caribou. The
feast-hour was at hand. With cries that rose above the last words of a
wild song the seven groups of men rushed to seven pairs of props and
tore them away. The great carcasses swayed in mid-air, bent slowly over
their spits, and then crashed into the snow fifteen feet from the fire.
About each carcass five men with razor-sharp knives ripped off hunks of
the roasted flesh and passed them into eager hands of the hungry
multitude. First came the women and children, and last the men.</p>

<p>On this there peered forth from a window in the factor's house the
darkly bearded, smiling face of Reese Beaudin.</p>

<p>"I have seen him three times, wandering about in the crowd, seeking
someone," he said. "Bien, he shall find that someone very soon!"</p>

<p>In the face of McDougall, the factor, was a strange look. For he had
listened to a strange story, and there was still something of shock and
amazement and disbelief in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Reese Beaudin, it is hard for me to believe."</p>

<p>"And yet you shall find that it is true," smiled Reese.</p>

<p>"He will kill you. He is a monster&mdash;a giant!"</p>

<p>"I shall die hard," replied Reese.</p>

<p>He turned from the window again, and took from the table a violin
wrapped in buckskin, and softly he played one of their old love songs.
It was not much more than a whisper, and yet it was filled with a
joyous exultation. He laid the violin down when he was finished, and
laughed, and filled his pipe, and lighted it.</p>

<p>"It is good for a man's soul to know that a woman loves him, and has
been true," he said. "Mon pere, will you tell me again what she said?
It is strength for me&mdash;and I must soon be going."</p>

<p>McDougall repeated, as if under a strain from which he could not
free himself:</p>

<p>"She came to me late last night, unknown to Dupont. She had received
your message, and knew you were coming. And I tell you again that I saw
something in her eyes which makes me afraid! She told me, then, that
her father killed Bedore in a quarrel, and that she married Dupont to
save him from the law&mdash;and kneeling there, with her hand on the
cross at her breast, she swore that each day of her life she has let
Dupont know that she hates him, and that she loves you, and that some
day Reese Beaudin would return to avenge her. Yes, she told him
that&mdash;I know it by what I saw in her eyes. With that cross
clutched in her fingers she swore that she had suffered torture and
shame, and that never a word of it had she whispered to a living soul,
that she might turn the passion of Jacques Dupont's black heart into a
great hatred. And today&mdash;Jacques Dupont will kill you!"</p>

<p>"I shall die hard," Reese repeated again.</p>

<p>He tucked the violin in its buckskin covering under his arm. From
the table he took his cap and placed it on his head.</p>

<p>In a last effort McDougall sprang from his chair and caught the
other's arm.</p>

<p>"Reese Beaudin&mdash;you are going to your death! As factor of Lac
Bain&mdash;agent of justice under power of the Police&mdash;I forbid
it!"</p>

<p>"So-o-o-o," spoke Reese Beaudin gently. "Mon pere&mdash;"</p>

<p>He unbuttoned his coat, which had remained buttoned. Under the coat
was a heavy shirt; and the shirt he opened, smiling into the factor's
eyes, and McDougall's face froze, and the breath was cut short on his
lips.</p>

<p>"That!" he gasped.</p>

<p>Reese Beaudin nodded.</p>

<p>Then he opened the door and went out.</p>

<p>Joe Delesse had been watching the factor's house, and he worked his
way slowly along the edge of the feasters so that he might casually
come into the path of Reese Beaudin. And there was one other man who
also had watched, and who came in the same direction. He was a
stranger, tall, closely hooded, his mustached face an Indian bronze. No
one had ever seen him at Lac Bain before, yet in the excitement of the
carnival the fact passed without conjecture or significance. And from
the cabin of Henri Paquette another pair of eyes saw Reese Beaudin, and
Mother Paquette heard a sob that in itself was a prayer.</p>

<p>In and out among the devourers of caribou-flesh, scanning the groups
and the ones and the twos and the threes, passed Jacques Dupont, and
with him walked his friend, one-eyed Layonne. Layonne was a big man,
but Dupont was taller by half a head. The brutishness of his face was
hidden under a coarse red beard; but the devil in him glowered from his
deep-set, inhuman eyes; it walked in his gait, in the hulk of his great
shoulders, in the gorilla-like slouch of his hips. His huge hands hung
partly clenched at his sides. His breath was heavy with whisky that
Layonne himself had smuggled in, and in his heart was black murder.</p>

<p>"He has not come!" he cried for the twentieth time. "He has not
come!"</p>

<p>He moved on, and Reese Beaudin&mdash;ten feet away&mdash;turned and
smiled at Joe Delesse with triumph in his eyes. He moved nearer.</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you he would not find in me that narrow-shouldered,
smooth-faced stripling of five years ago?" he asked. "N'est-ce pas,
friend Delesse?"</p>

<p>The face of Joe Delesse was heavy with a somber fear.</p>

<p>"His fist is like a wood-sledge, m'sieu."</p>

<p>"So it was years ago."</p>

<p>"His forearm is as big as the calf of your leg."</p>

<p>"Oui, friend Delesse, it is the forearm of a giant."</p>

<p>"He is half again your weight."</p>

<p>"Or more, friend Delesse."</p>

<p>"He will kill you! As the great God lives, he will kill you!"</p>

<p>"I shall die hard," repeated Reese Beaudin for the third time that
day.</p>

<p>Joe Delesse turned slowly, doggedly. His voice rumbled.</p>

<p>"The sale is about to begin, m'sieu. See!"</p>

<p>A man had mounted the log platform raised to the height of a man's
shoulders at the far end of the clearing. It was Henri Paquette, master
of the day's ceremonies, and appointed auctioneer of the great wakao. A
man of many tongues was Paquette. To his lips he raised a great
megaphone of birchbark, and sonorously his call rang out&mdash;in
French, in Cree, in Chippewan, and the packed throng about the
caribou-fires heaved like a living billow, and to a man and a woman and
a child it moved toward the appointed place.</p>

<p>"The time has come," said Reese Beaudin. "And all Lac Bain shall
see!"</p>

<p>Behind them&mdash;watching, always watching&mdash;followed the
bronze-faced stranger in his close-drawn hood.</p>

<p>For an hour the men of Lac Bain gathered close-wedged about the log
platform on which stood Henri Paquette and his Indian helper. Behind
the men were the women and children, and through the cordon there ran a
babiche-roped pathway along which the dogs were brought.</p>

<p>The platform was twenty feet square, with the floor side of the logs
hewn flat, and there was no lack of space for the gesticulation and
wild pantomime of Paquette. In one hand he held a notebook, and in the
other a pencil. In the notebook the sales of twenty dogs were already
tabulated, and the prices paid.</p>

<p>Anxiously, Reese Beaudin was waiting. Each time that a new dog came
up he looked at Joe Delesse, but, as yet Joe had failed to give the
signal.</p>

<p>On the platform the Indian was holding two malamutes in leash now
and Paquette was crying, in a well simulated fit of great fury:</p>

<p>"What, you cheap kimootisks, will you let this pair of malamutes go
for seven mink and a cross fox. Are you men? Are you poverty-stricken?
Are you blind? A breed dog and a male giant for seven mink and a cross
fox? Non, I will buy them myself first, and kill them, and use their
flesh for dog-feed, and their hides for fools' caps! I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Twelve mink and a Number Two Cross," came a voice out of the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Twelve mink and a Number One," shouted another.</p>

<p>"A little better&mdash;a little better!" wailed Paquette. "You are
waking up, but slowly&mdash;mon Dieu, so slowly! Twelve mink
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A voice rose in Cree:</p>

<p>"Nesi-tu-now-unisk!"</p>

<p>Paquette gave a triumphant yell.</p>

<p>"The Indian beats you! The Indian from Little Neck Lake&mdash;an
Indian beats the white man! He offers twenty beaver&mdash;prime skins!
And beaver are wanted in Paris now. They're wanted in London. Beaver
and gold&mdash;they are the same! But they are the price of one dog
alone. Shall they both go at that? Shall the Indian have them for
twenty beaver&mdash;twenty beaver that may be taken from a single house
in a day&mdash;while it has taken these malamutes two and a half years
to grow? I say, you cheap kimootisks&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then an amazing thing happened. It was like a bomb falling in
that crowded throng of wondering and amazed forest people.</p>

<p>It was the closely hooded stranger who spoke.</p>

<p>"I will give a hundred dollars cash," he said.</p>

<p>A look of annoyance crossed Reese Beaudin's face.</p>

<p>He was close to the bronze-faced stranger, and edged nearer.</p>

<p>"Let the Indian have them," he said in a low voice. "It is Meewe. I
knew him years ago. He has carried me on his back. He taught me first
to draw pictures."</p>

<p>"But they are powerful dogs," objected the stranger. "My team needs
them."</p>

<p>The Cree had risen higher out of the crowd. One arm rose above his
head. He was an Indian who had seen fifty years of the forests, and his
face was the face of an Egyptian.</p>

<p>"Nesi-tu-now Nesoo-sap umisk!" he proclaimed.</p>

<p>Henri Paquette hopped excitedly, and faced the stranger.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two beaver," he challenged. "Twenty-two&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let Meewe have them," replied the hooded stranger.</p>

<p>Three minutes later a single dog was pulled up on the log platform.
He was a magnificent beast, and a rumble of approval ran through the
crowd.</p>

<p>The face of Joe Delesse was gray. He wet his lips. Reese Beaudin,
watching him, knew that the time had come. And Joe Delesse, seeing no
way of escape, whispered:</p>

<p>"It is her dog, m'sieu. It is Parka&mdash;and Dupont sells him today
to show her that he is master."</p>

<p>Already Paquette was advertising the virtues of Parka when Reese
Beaudin, in a single leap, mounted the log platform, and stood beside
him.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he cried.</p>

<p>There fell a silence, and Reese said, loud enough for all to
hear:</p>

<p>"M'sieu Paquette, I ask the privilege of examining this dog that I
want to buy."</p>

<p>At last he straightened, and all who faced him saw the smiling sneer
on his lips.</p>

<p>"Who is it that offers this worthless cur for sale?" Lac Bain heard
him say. "P-s-s-st&mdash;it is a woman's dog! It is not worth bidding
for!"</p>

<p>"You lie!" Dupont's voice rose in a savage roar. His huge shoulders
bulked over those about him. He crowded to the edge of the platform.
"You lie!"</p>

<p>"He is a woman's dog," repeated Reese Beaudin without excitement,
yet so clearly that every ear heard. "He is a woman's pet, and M'sieu
Dupont most surely does lie if he denies it!"</p>

<p>So far as memory went back no man at Lac Bain that day had ever
heard another man give Jacques Dupont the lie. A thrill swept those who
heard and understood. There was a great silence, in that silence men
near him heard the choking rage in Dupont's great chest. He was staring
up&mdash;straight up into the smiling face of Reese Beaudin; and in
that moment he saw beyond the glossy black beard, and amazement and
unbelief held him still. In the next, Reese Beaudin had the violin in
his hands. He flung off the buckskin, and in a flash the instrument was
at his shoulder.</p>

<p>"See! I will play, and the woman's pet shall sing!"</p>

<p>And once more, after five years, Lac Bain listened to the magic of
Reese Beaudin's violin. And it was Elise's old love song that he
played. He played it, smiling down into the eyes of a monster whose
face was turning from red to black; yet he did not play it to the end,
nor a quarter of it, for suddenly a voice shouted:</p>

<p>"It is Reese Beaudin&mdash;come back!"</p>

<p>Joe Delesse, paralyzed, speechless, could have sworn it was the
hooded stranger who shouted; and then he remembered, and flung up his
great arms, and bellowed:</p>

<p>"Oui&mdash;by the Saints, it is Reese Beaudin&mdash;Reese Beaudin
come back!"</p>

<p>Suddenly as it had begun the playing ceased, and Henri Paquette
found himself with the violin in his hands. Reese Beaudin turned,
facing them all, the wintry sun glowing in his beard, his eyes smiling,
his head high&mdash;unfraid now, more fearless than any other man that
had ever set foot in Lac Bain. And McDougall, with his arm touching
Elise's hair, felt the wild and throbbing pulse of her body. This
day&mdash;this hour&mdash;this minute in which she stood still,
inbreathing&mdash;had confirmed her belief in Reese Beaudin. As she had
dreamed, so had he risen. First of all the men in the world he stood
there now, just as he had been first in the days when she had loved his
dreams, his music, and his pictures. To her he was the old god, more
splendid,&mdash;for he had risen above fear, and he was facing Dupont
now with that strange quiet smile on his lips. And then, all at once,
her soul broke its fetters, and over the women's heads she reached out
her arms, and all there heard her voice in its triumph, its joy, its
fear.</p>

<p>"Reese! Reese&mdash;my sakeakun!"</p>

<p>Over the heads of all the forest people she called him beloved! Like
the fang of an adder the word stung Dupont's brain. And like fire
touched to powder, swiftly as lightning illumines the sky, the glory of
it blazed in Reese Beaudin's face. And all that were there heard him
clearly:</p>

<p>"I am Reese Beaudin. I am the Yellow-back. I have returned to meet a
man you all know&mdash;Jacques Dupont. He is a monkey-man&mdash;a
whipper of boys, a stealer of women, a cheat, a coward, a thing so foul
the crows will not touch him when he dies&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a roar. It was not the roar of a man, but of a
beast&mdash;and Jacques Dupont was on the platform!</p>

<p>Quick as Dupont's movement had been it was no swifter than that of
the closely-hooded stranger. He was as tall as Dupont, and about him
there was an air of authority and command.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said, and placed a hand on Dupont's heaving chest. His
smile was cold as ice. Never had Dupont seen eyes so like the pale blue
of steel.</p>

<p>"M'sieu Dupont, you are about to avenge a great insult. It must be
done fairly. If you have weapons, throw them away. I will search
this&mdash;this Reese Beaudin, as he calls himself! And if there is to
be a fight, let it be a good one. Strip yourself to that great garment
you have on, friend Dupont. See, our friend&mdash;this Reese
Beaudin&mdash;is already stripping!"</p>

<p>He was unbuttoning the giant's heavy Hudson's Bay coat. He pulled it
off, and drew Dupont's knife from its sheath. Paquette, like a stunned
cat that had recovered its ninth life, was scrambling from the
platform. The Indian was already gone. And Reese Beaudin had tossed his
coat to Joe Delesse, and with it his cap. His heavy shirt was closely
buttoned; and not only was it buttoned, Delesse observed, but also was
it carefully pinned. And even now, facing that monster who would soon
be at him, Reese Beaudin was smiling.</p>

<p>For a moment the closely hooded stranger stood between them, and
Jacques Dupont crouched himself for his vengeance. Never to the people
of Lac Bain had he looked more terrible. He was the gorilla-fighter,
the beast fighter, the fighter who fights as the wolf, the bear and the
cat&mdash;crushing out life, breaking bones, twisting, snapping,
inundating and destroying with his great weight and his monstrous
strength. He was a hundred pounds heavier than Reese Beaudin. On his
stooping shoulders he could carry a tree. With his giant hands he could
snap a two-inch sapling. With one hand alone he had set a bear-trap.
And with that mighty strength he fought as the cave-man fought. It was
his boast there was no trick of the Chippewan, the Cree, the Eskimo or
the forest man that he did not know. And yet Reese Beaudin stood
calmly, waiting for him, and smiling!</p>

<p>In another moment the hooded stranger was gone, and there was none
between them.</p>

<p>"A long time I have waited for this, m'sieu," said Reese, for
Dupont's ears alone. "Five years is a long time. And my Elise still
loves me."</p>

<p>Still more like a gorilla Jacques Dupont crept upon him. His face
was twisted by a rage to which he could no longer give voice. Hatred
and jealousy robbed his eyes of the last spark of the thing that was
human. His great hands were hooked, like an eagle's talons. His lips
were drawn back, like a beast's. Through his red beard yellow fangs
were bared.</p>

<p>And Reese Beaudin no longer smiled. He laughed!</p>

<p>"Until I went away and met real men, I never knew what a pig of a
man you were, M'sieu Dupont," he taunted amiably, as though speaking in
jest to a friend. "You remind me of an aged and over-fat porcupine with
his big paunch and crooked arms. What horror must it have been for my
Elise to have lived in sight of such a beast as you!"</p>

<p>With a bellow Dupont was at him. And swifter than eyes had ever seen
man move at Lac Bain before, Reese Beaudin was out of his way, and
behind him; and then, as the giant caught himself at the edge of the
platform, and turned, he received a blow that sounded like the
broadside of a paddle striking water. Reese Beaudin had struck him with
the flat of his unclenched hand!</p>

<p>A murmur of incredulity rose out of the crowd. To the forest man
such a blow was the deadliest of insults. It was calling him an
Iskwao&mdash;a woman&mdash;a weakling&mdash;a thing too contemptible to
harden one's fist against. But the murmur died in an instant. For Reese
Beaudin, making as if to step back, shot suddenly
forward&mdash;straight through the giant's crooked arms&mdash;and it
was his fist this time that landed squarely between the eyes of Dupont.
The monster's head went back, his great body wavered, and then suddenly
he plunged backward off the platform and fell with a crash to the
ground.</p>

<p>A yell went up from the hooded stranger. Joe Delesse split his
throat. The crowd drowned Reese Beaudin's voice. But above it all rose
a woman's voice shrieking forth a name.</p>

<p>And then Jacques Dupont was on the platform again. In the moments
that followed one could almost hear his neighbor's heart beat. Nearer
and still nearer to each other drew the two men. And now Dupont
crouched still more, and Joe Delesse held his breath. He noticed that
Reese Beaudin was standing almost on the tips of his toes&mdash;that
each instant he seemed prepared, like a runner, for sudden flight. Five
feet&mdash;four&mdash;and Dupont leapt in, his huge arms swinging like
the limb of a tree, and his weight following with crushing force behind
his blow. For an instant it seemed as though Reese Beaudin had stood to
meet that fatal rush, but in that same instant&mdash;so swiftly that
only the hooded stranger knew what had happened&mdash;he was out of the
way, and his left arm seemed to shoot downward, and then up, and then
his right straight out, and then again his left arm downward, and
up&mdash;and it was the third blow, all swift as lightning, that
brought a yell from the hooded stranger. For though none but the
stranger had seen it, Jacques Dupont's head snapped back&mdash;and all
saw the fourth blow that sent him reeling like a man struck by a
club.</p>

<p>There was no sound now. A mental and a vocal paralysis seized upon
the inhabitants of Lac Bain. Never had they seen fighting like this
fighting of Reese Beaudin. Until now had they lived to see the science
of the sawdust ring pitted against the brute force of Brobdingnagian,
of Antaeus and Goliath. For Reese Beaudin's fighting was a fighting
without tricks that they could see. He used his fists, and his fists
alone. He was like a dancing man. And suddenly, in the midst of the
miracle, they saw Jacques Dupont go down. And the second miracle was
that Reese Beaudin did not leap on him when he had fallen. He stood
back a little, balancing himself in that queer fashion on the balls and
toes of his feet. But no sooner was Dupont up than Reese Beaudin was in
again, with the swiftness of a cat, and they could hear the blows, like
solid shots, and Dupont's arms waved like tree-tops, and a second time
he was off the platform.</p>

<p>He was staggering when he rose. The blood ran in streams from his
mouth and nose. His beard dripped with it. His yellow teeth were caved
in.</p>

<p>This time he did not leap upon the platform&mdash;he clambered back
to it, and the hooded stranger gave him a lift which a few minutes
before Dupont would have resented as an insult.</p>

<p>"Ah, it has come," said the stranger to Delesse.</p>

<p>"He is the best close-in fighter in all&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish.</p>

<p>"I could kill you now&mdash;kill you with a single blow," said Reese
Beaudin in a moment when the giant stood swaying. "But there is a
greater punishment in store for you, and so I shall let you live!"</p>

<p>And now Reese Beaudin was facing that part of the crowd where the
woman he loved was standing. He was breathing deeply. But he was not
winded. His eyes were black as night, his hair wind-blown. He looked
straight over the heads between him and she whom Dupont had stolen from
him.</p>

<p>Reese Beaudin raised his arms, and where there had been a murmur of
voices there was now silence.</p>

<p>For the first time the stranger threw back his hood. He was
unbuttoning his heavy coat.</p>

<p>And Joe Delesse, looking up, saw that Reese Beaudin was making a
mighty effort to quiet a strange excitement within his breast. And then
there was a rending of cloth and of buttons and of pins as in one swift
movement he tore the shirt from his own breast&mdash;exposing to the
eyes of Lac Bain blood-red in the glow of the winter sun, the crimson
badge of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police!</p>

<p>And above the gasp that swept the multitude, above the strange cry
of the woman, his voice rose:</p>

<p>"I am Reese Beaudin, the Yellow-back. I am Reese Beaudin, who ran
away. I am Reese Beaudin,&mdash;Sergeant in His Majesty's Royal
Northwest Mounted Police, and in the name of the law I arrest Jacques
Dupont for the murder of Francois Bedore, who was killed on his
trap-line five years ago! Fitzgerald&mdash;"</p>

<p>The hooded stranger leaped upon the platform. His heavy coat fell
off. Tall and grim he stood in the scarlet jacket of the Police. Steel
clinked in his hands. And Jacques Dupont, terror in his heart, was
trying to see as he groped to his knees. The steel snapped over his
wrists.</p>

<p>And then he heard a voice close over him. It was the voice of Reese
Beaudin.</p>

<p>"And this is your final punishment, Jacques Dupont&mdash;to be
hanged by the neck until you are dead. For Bedore was not dead when
Elise's father left him after their fight on the trap-line. It was you
who saw the fight, and finished the killing, and laid the crime on
Elise's father. Mukoki, the Indian, saw you. It is my day, Dupont, and
I have waited long&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest Dupont did not hear. For up from the crowd there went a
mighty roar. And through it a woman was making her way with outreaching
arms&mdash;and behind her followed the factor of Lac Bain.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_4">THE FIDDLING MAN</a></h3>

<p>Breault's cough was not pleasant to hear. A cough possesses manifold
and almost unclassifiable diversities. But there is only one cough when
a man has a bullet through his lungs and is measuring his life by
minutes, perhaps seconds. Yet Breault, even as he coughed the red stain
from his lips, was not afraid. Many times he had found himself in the
presence of death, and long ago it had ceased to frighten him. Some day
he had expected to come under the black shadow of it himself&mdash;not
in a quiet and peaceful way, but all at once, with a shock. And the
time had come. He knew that he was dying; and he was calm. More than
that&mdash;in dying he was achieving a triumph. The red-hot death-sting
in his lung had given birth to a frightful thought in his sickening
brain. The day of his great opportunity was at hand. The hour&mdash;the
minute.</p>

<p>A last flush of the pale afternoon sun lighted up his black-bearded
face as his eyes turned, with their new inspiration, to his sledge. It
was a face that one would remember&mdash;not pleasantly, perhaps, but
as a fixture in a shifting memory of things; a face strong with a brute
strength, implacable in its hard lines, emotionless almost, and beyond
that, a mystery.</p>

<p>It was the best known face in all that part of the northland which
reaches up from Fort McMurray to Lake Athabasca and westward to Fond du
Lac and the Wholdais country. For ten years Breault had made that trip
twice a year with the northern mails. In all its reaches there was not
a cabin he did not know, a face he had not seen, or a name he could not
speak; yet there was not a man, woman, or child who welcomed him except
for what he brought. But the government had found its faith in him
justified. The police at their lonely outposts had come to regard his
comings and goings as dependable as day and night. They blessed him for
his punctuality, and not one of them missed him when he was gone. A
strange man was Breault.</p>

<p>With his back against a tree, where he had propped himself after the
first shock of the bullet in his lung, he took a last look at life with
a passionless imperturbability. If there was any emotion at all in his
face it was one of vindictiveness&mdash;an emotion roused by an intense
and terrible hatred that in this hour saw the fulfilment of its
vengeance. Few men nursed a hatred as Breault had nursed his. And it
gave him strength now, when another man would have died.</p>

<p>He measured the distance between himself and the sledge. It was,
perhaps, a dozen paces. The dogs were still standing, tangled a little
in their traces,&mdash;eight of them,&mdash;wide-chested, thin at the
groins, a wolfish horde, built for endurance and speed. On the sledge
was a quarter of a ton of his Majesty's mail. Toward this Breault began
to creep slowly and with great pain. A hand inside of him seemed
crushing the fiber of his lung, so that the blood oozed out of his
mouth. When he reached the sledge there were many red patches in the
snow behind him. He opened with considerable difficulty a small dunnage
sack, and after fumbling a bit took there-from a pencil attached to a
long red string, and a soiled envelope.</p>

<p>For the first time a change came upon his countenance&mdash;a
ghastly smile. And above his hissing breath, that gushed between his
lips with the sound of air pumped through the fine mesh of a colander,
there rose a still more ghastly croak of exultation and of triumph.
Laboriously he wrote. A few words, and the pencil dropped from his
stiffening fingers into the snow. Around his neck he wore a long red
scarf held together by a big brass pin, and to this pin he fastened
securely the envelope.</p>

<p>This much done,&mdash;the mystery of his death solved for those who
might some day find him,&mdash;the ordinary man would have contented
himself by yielding up life's struggle with as little more physical
difficulty as possible. Breault was not ordinary. He was, in his one
way, efficiency incarnate. He made space for himself on the sledge, and
laid himself out in that space with great care, first taking pains to
fasten about his thighs two babiche thongs that were employed at times
to steady his freight. Then he ran his left arm through one of the
loops of the stout mail-chest. By taking these precautions he was
fairly secure in the belief that after he was dead and frozen stiff no
amount of rough trailing by the dogs could roll him from the
sledge.</p>

<p>In this conjecture he was right. When the starved and exhausted
malamutes dragged their silent burden into the Northwest Mounted Police
outpost barracks at Crooked Bow twenty-four hours later, an ax and a
sapling bar were required to pry Francois Breault from his bier.
Previous to this process, however, Sergeant Fitzgerald, in charge at
the outpost, took possession of the soiled envelope pinned to Breault's
red scarf. The information it bore was simple, and yet exceedingly
definite. Few men in dying as Breault had died could have made the
matter easier for the police.</p>

<p>On the envelope he had written:</p>

<p>Jan Thoreau shot me and left me for dead. Have just strength to
write this&mdash;no more.</p>

<p>Francois Breault.</p>

<p>It was epic&mdash;a colossal monument to this man, thought Sergeant
Fitzgerald, as they pried the frozen body loose.</p>

<p>To Corporal Blake fell the unpleasant task of going after Jan
Thoreau. Unpleasant, because Breault's starved huskies and frozen body
brought with them the worst storm of the winter. In the face of this
storm Blake set out, with the Sergeant's last admonition in his
ears:</p>

<p>"Don't come back, Blake, until you've got him, dead or alive."</p>

<p>That is a simple and efficacious formula in the rank and file of the
Royal Northwest Mounted Police. It has made volumes of stirring
history, because it means a great deal and has been lived up to. Twice
before, the words had been uttered to Blake&mdash;in extreme cases. The
first time they had taken him for six months into the Barren Lands
between Hudson's Bay and the Great Slave&mdash;and he came back with
his man; the second time he was gone for nearly a year along the rim of
the Arctic&mdash;and from there also he came back with his man. Blake
was of that sort. A bull-dog, a Nemesis when he was once on the trail,
and&mdash;like most men of that kind&mdash;without a conscience. In the
Blue Books of the service he was credited with arduous patrols and
unusual exploits. "Put Blake on the trail" meant something, and "He is
one of our best men" was a firmly established conviction at
departmental headquarters.</p>

<p>Only one man knew Blake as Blake actually lived under his
skin&mdash;and that was Blake himself. He hunted men and ran them down
without mercy&mdash;not because he loved the law, but for the reason
that he had in him the inherited instincts of the hound. This
comparison, if quite true, is none the less unfair to the hound. A
hound is a good dog at heart.</p>

<p>In the January storm it may be that the vengeful spirit of Francois
Breault set out in company with Corporal Blake to witness the
consummation of his vengeance. That first night, as he sat close to his
fire in the shelter of a thick spruce timber, Blake felt the unusual
and disturbing sensation of a presence somewhere near him. The storm
was at its height. He had passed through many storms, but to-night
there seemed to be an uncannily concentrated fury in its beating and
wailing over the roofs of the forests.</p>

<p>He was physically comfortable. The spruce trees were so dense that
the storm did not reach him, and fortune favored him with a good fire
and plenty of fuel. But the sensation oppressed him. He could not keep
away from him his mental vision of Breault as he had helped to pry him
from the sledge&mdash;his frozen features, the stiffened fingers, the
curious twist of the icy lips that had been almost a grin.</p>

<p>Blake was not superstitious. He was too much a man of iron for that.
His soul had lost the plasticity of imagination. But he could not
forget Breault's lips as they had seemed to grin up at him. There was a
reason for it. On his last trip down, Breault had said to him, with
that same half-grin on his face:</p>

<p>"M'sieu, some day you may go after my murderer, and when you do,
Francois Breault will go with you."</p>

<p>That was three months ago. Blake measured the time back as he sucked
at his pipe, and at the same time he looked at the shadowy and
half-lost forms of his dogs, curled up for the night in the outer rim
of firelight.</p>

<p>Over the tree-tops a sudden blast of wind howled. It was like a
monster voice. Blake rose to his feet and rolled upon the fire the big
night log he had dragged in, and to this he added, with the woodman's
craft of long experience, lengths of green timber, so arranged that
they would hold fire until morning. Then he went into his silk service
tent and buried himself in his sleeping-bag.</p>

<p>For a long time he did not sleep. He listened to the crackle of the
fire. Again and again he heard that monster voice moaning and shrieking
over the forest. Never had the rage of storm filled him with the
uneasiness of to-night. At last the mystery of it was solved for him.
The wind came and went each time in a great moaning, half shrieking
sound: B-r-r-r-r&mdash;e-e-e-e&mdash;aw-w-w-w!</p>

<p>It was like a shock to him; and yet, he was not a superstitious man.
No, he was not that. He would have staked his life on it. But it was
not pleasant to hear a dead man's name shrieked over one's head by the
wind. Under the cover of his sleeping-bag flap Corporal Blake laughed.
Funny things were always happening, he tried to tell himself. And this
was a mighty good joke. Breault wasn't so slow, after all. He had given
his promise, and he was keeping it; for, if it wasn't really Breault's
voice up there in the wind, multiplied a thousand times, it was a good
imitation of it. Again Corporal Blake laughed&mdash;a laugh as
unpleasant as the cough that had come from Breault's bullet-punctured
lung. He fell asleep after a time; but even sleep could not drive from
him the clinging obsession of the thought that strange things were to
happen in this taking of Jan Thoreau.</p>

<p>With the gray dawn there was nothing to mark the passing of the
storm except freshly fallen snow, and Blake was on the trail before it
was light enough to see a hundred yards ahead. There was a defiance and
a contempt of last night in the crack of his long caribou-gut whip and
the halloo of his voice as he urged on his dogs. Breault's voice in the
wind? Bah! Only a fool would have thought that. Therefore he was a
fool. And Jan Thoreau&mdash;it would be like taking a child. There
would be no happenings to report&mdash;merely an arrest, a quick return
journey, an affair altogether too ordinary to be interesting. Perhaps
it was all on account of the hearty supper of caribou liver he had
eaten. He was fond of liver, and once or twice before it had played him
tricks.</p>

<p>He began to wonder if he would find Jan Thoreau at home. He
remembered Jan quite vividly. The Indians called him Kitoochikun
because he played a fiddle. Blake, the Iron Man, disliked him because
of that fiddle. Jan was never without it, on the trail or off. The
Fiddling Man, he called him contemptuously&mdash;a baby, a woman; not
fit for the big north. Tall and slim, with blond hair in spite of his
French blood and name, a quiet and unexcitable face, and an air that
Blake called "damned superiority." He wondered how the Fiddling Man had
ever screwed up nerve enough to kill Breault. Undoubtedly there had
been no fight. A quick and treacherous shot, no doubt. That was like a
man who played a fiddle. POOF! He had no more respect for him than if
he dressed in woman's clothing.</p>

<p>And he DID have a wife, this Jan Thoreau. They lived a good twenty
miles off the north-and-south trail, on an island in the middle of
Black Bear Lake. He had never seen the wife. A poor sort of woman, he
made up his mind, that would marry a fiddler. Probably a half-breed;
maybe an Indian. Anyway, he had no sympathy for her. Without a doubt,
it was the woman who did the trapping and cut the wood. Any man who
would tote a fiddle around on his back&mdash;</p>

<p>Corporal Blake traveled fast, and it was afternoon of the second day
when he came to the dense spruce forest that shut in Black Bear Lake.
Here something happened to change his plans somewhat. He met an Indian
he knew&mdash;an Indian who, for two or three good reasons that stuck
in the back of his head, dared not lie to him; and this tribesman,
coming straight from the Thoreau cabin, told him that Jan was not at
home, but had gone on a three-day trip to see the French missioner who
lived on one of the lower Wholdaia waterways.</p>

<p>Blake was keen on strategem. With him, man-hunting was like a game
of chess; and after he had questioned the Indian for a quarter of an
hour he saw his opportunity. Pastamoo, the Cree, was made a part of his
Majesty's service on the spot, with the promise of torture and speedy
execution if he proved himself a traitor.</p>

<p>Blake turned over to him his dogs and sledge, his provisions, and
his tent, and commanded him to camp in the heart of a cedar swamp a few
miles back, with the information that he would return for his outfit at
some time in the indefinite future. He might be gone a day or a week.
When he had seen Pastamoo off, he continued his journey toward the
cabin, in the hope that Jan Thoreau's wife was either an Indian or a
fool. He was too old a hand at his game to be taken in by the story
that had been told to the Cree.</p>

<p>Jan had not gone to the French missioner's. A murderer's trail would
not be given away like that. Of course the wife knew. And Corporal
Blake desired no better string to a criminal than the faith of a wife.
Wives were easy if handled right, and they had put the finishing touch
to more than one of his great successes.</p>

<p>At the edge of the lake he fell back on his old trick&mdash;hunger,
exhaustion, a sprained leg. It was not more than a quarter of a mile
across the snow-covered ice of the lake to the thin spiral of smoke
that he saw rising above the thick balsams on the island. Five times in
that distance he fell upon his face; he crawled like a man about to
die. He performed an arduous task, a devilish task, and when at last he
reached the balsams he cursed his luck until he was red in the face. No
one had seen him. That quarter-mile of labor was lost, its finesse a
failure. But he kept up the play, and staggered weakly through the
sheltering balsams to the cabin. His artifice had no shame, even when
played on women; and he fell heavily against the door, beat upon it
with his fist; and slipped down into the snow, where he lay with his
head bowed, as if his last strength was gone.</p>

<p>He heard movement inside, quick steps&mdash;and then the door
opened. He did not look up for a moment. That would have been crude.
When he did raise his head, it was very slowly, with a look of anguish
in his face. And then&mdash;he stared. His body all at once grew tense,
and the counterfeit pain in his eyes died out like a flash in this most
astounding moment of his life. Man of iron though he was, steeled to
the core against the weaknesses of sudden emotions, it was impossible
for him to restrain the gasp of amazement that rose to his lips.</p>

<p>In that stifled cry Jan Thoreau's wife heard the supplication of a
dying man. She did not catch, back of it, the note of a startled beast.
She was herself startled, frightened for a moment by the unexpectedness
of it all.</p>

<p>And Blake stared. This&mdash;the fiddler's wife! She was clutching
in her hand a brush with which she had been arranging her hair. The
hair, jet black, was wonderful. Her eyes were still more wonderful to
Blake. She was not an Indian&mdash;not a half-breed&mdash;and
beautiful. The loveliest face he had ever visioned, sleeping or awake,
was looking down at him.</p>

<p>With a second gasp, he remembered himself, and his body sagged, and
the amazed stare went out of his eyes as he allowed his head to fall a
little. In this movement his cap fell off. In another moment she was at
his side, kneeling in the snow and bending over him.</p>

<p>"You are hurt, m'sieu!"</p>

<p>Her hair fell upon him, smothering his neck and shoulders. The
perfume of it was like the delicate scent of a rare flower in his
nostrils. A strange thrill swept through him. He did not try to analyze
it in those few astonishing moments. It was beyond his comprehension,
even had he tried. He was ignorant of the finer fundamentals of life,
and of the great truth that the case-hardened nature of a man, like the
body of an athlete, crumbles fastest under sudden and unexpected change
and strain.</p>

<p>He regained his feet slowly and stupidly, assisted by Marie. They
climbed the one step to the door. As he sank back heavily on the cot,
in the room they entered, a thick tress of her hair fell softly upon
his face. He closed his eyes for a space. When he opened them, Marie
was bending over the stove.</p>

<p>And SHE was Thoreau's wife! The instant he had looked up into her
face, he had forgotten the fiddler; but he remembered him now as he
watched the woman, who stood with her back toward him. She was as slim
as a reed. Her hair fell to her hips. He drew a deep breath.
Unconsciously he clenched his hands. SHE&mdash;the fiddler's wife! The
thought repeated itself again and again. Jan Thoreau, MURDERER, and
this woman&mdash;HIS WIFE.</p>

<p>She returned in a moment with hot tea, and he drank with subtle
hypocrisy from the cup she held to his lips.</p>

<p>"Sprained my leg," he said then, remembering his old part, and
replying to the questioning anxiety in her eyes. "Dogs ran away and
left me, and I got here just by chance. A little more and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He smiled grimly, and as he sank back he gave a sharp cry. He had
practised that cry in more than one cabin, and along with it a
convulsion of his features to emphasize the impression he labored to
make.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid&mdash;I'll be a trouble to you," he apologized. "It's
not broken; but it's bad, and I won't be able to move&mdash;soon. Is
Jan at home?"</p>

<p>"No, m'sieu; he is away."</p>

<p>"Away," repeated Blake disappointedly. "Perhaps sometime he has told
you about me," he added with sudden hopefulness. "I am John Duval."</p>

<p>"M'sieu&mdash;DUVAL!"</p>

<p>Marie's eyes, looking down at him, became all at once great pools of
glowing light. Her lips parted. She leaned toward him, her slim hands
clasped suddenly to her breast.</p>

<p>"M'sieu Duval&mdash;who nursed him through the smallpox?" she cried,
her voice trembling. "M'sieu Duval&mdash;who saved my Jan's life!"</p>

<p>Blake had looked up his facts at headquarters. He knew what Duval,
the Barren Land trapper, had once upon a time done for Jan.</p>

<p>"Yes; I am John Duval," said. "And so&mdash;you see&mdash;I am sorry
that Jan is away."</p>

<p>"But he is coming back soon&mdash;in a few days," exclaimed Marie.
"You shall stay, m'sieu! You will wait for him? Yes?"</p>

<p>"This leg&mdash;" began Blake. He cut himself short with a grimace.
"Yes, I'll stay. I guess I'll have to."</p>

<p>Marie had changed at the mention of Duval's name. With the glow in
her eyes had come a flush into her cheeks, and Blake could see the
strange little quiver at her throat as she looked at him. But she did
not see Blake so much as what lay beyond him&mdash;Duval's lonely cabin
away up on the edge of the Great Barren, the hours of darkness and
agony through which Jan had passed, and the magnificent comradeship of
this man who had now dragged himself to their own cabin, half dead.</p>

<p>Many times Jan had told her the story of that terrible winter when
Duval had nursed him like a woman, and had almost given up his life as
a sacrifice. And this&mdash;THIS&mdash;was Duval? She bent over him
again as he lay on the cot, her eyes shining like stars in the growing
dusk. In that dusk she was unconscious of the fact that his fingers had
found a long tress of her hair and were clutching it passionately.
Remembering Duval as Jan had enshrined him in her heart, she said:</p>

<p>"I have prayed many times that the great God might thank you,
m'sieu."</p>

<p>He raised a hand. For an instant it touched her soft, warm cheek and
caressed her hair. Marie did not shrink&mdash;yes, that would have been
an insult. Even Jan would have said that. For was not this Duval, to
whom she owed all the happiness in her life&mdash;Duval, more than
brother to Jan Thoreau, her husband?</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;are Marie?" said Blake.</p>

<p>"Yes, m'sieu, I am Marie."</p>

<p>A joyous note trembled in her voice as she drew back from the cot.
He could hear her swiftly braiding her hair before she struck a match
to light the oil lamp hanging from the ceiling. After that, through
partly closed eyes, he watched her as she prepared their supper.
Occasionally, when she turned toward him as if to speak, he feigned a
desire to sleep. It was a catlike watchfulness, filled with his old
cunning. In his face there was no sign to betray its hideous
significance. Outwardly he had regained his iron-like impassiveness;
but in his body and his brain every nerve and fiber was consumed by a
monstrous desire&mdash;a desire for this woman, the murderer's wife. It
was as strange and as sudden as the death that had come to Francois
Breault.</p>

<p>The moment he had looked up into her face in the doorway, it had
overwhelmed him. And now even the sound of her footsteps on the floor
filled him with an exquisite exultation. It was more than exultation.
It was a feeling of POSSESSION.</p>

<p>In the hollow of his hand he&mdash;Blake, the man-hunter&mdash;held
the fate of this woman. She was the Fiddler's wife&mdash;and the
Fiddler was a murderer.</p>

<p>Marie heard the sudden deep breath that forced itself from his lips,
a gasp that would have been a cry of triumph if he had given it
voice.</p>

<p>"You are in pain, m'sieu," she exclaimed, turning toward him
quickly.</p>

<p>"A little," he said, smiling at her. "Will you help me to sit up,
Marie?"</p>

<p>He saw ahead of him another and more thrilling game than the
man-hunt now. And Marie, unsuspicious, put her arms about the shoulders
of the Pharisee and helped him to rise. They ate their supper with a
narrow table between them. If there had been a doubt in Blake's mind
before that, the half hour in which she sat facing him dispelled it
utterly. At first the amazing beauty of Thoreau's wife had impinged
itself upon his senses with something of a shock. But he was cool now.
He was again master of his old cunning. Pitilessly and without
conscience, he was marshaling the crafty forces of his brute nature for
this new and more thrilling fight&mdash;the fight for a woman.</p>

<p>That in representing the Law he was pledged to virtue as well as
order had never entered into his code of life. To him the Law was
force&mdash;power. It had exalted him. It had forged an iron mask over
the face of his savagery. And it was the savage that was dominant in
him now. He saw in Marie's dark eyes a great love&mdash;love for a
murderer.</p>

<p>It was not his thought that he might alienate that. For that look,
turned upon himself, he would have sacrificed his whole world as it had
previously existed. He was scheming beyond that impossibility,
measuring her even as he called himself Duval, counting&mdash;not his
chances of success, but the length of time it would take him to
succeed.</p>

<p>He had never failed. A man had never beaten him. A woman had never
tricked him. And he granted no possibility of failure now.
But&mdash;HOW? That was the question that writhed and twisted itself in
his brain even as he smiled at her over the table and told her of the
black days of Jan's sickness up on the edge of the Barren.</p>

<p>And then it came to him&mdash;all at once. Marie did not see. She
did not FEEL. She had no suspicion of this loyal friend of her
husband's.</p>

<p>Blake's heart pounded triumphant. He hobbled back to the cot,
leaning on Marie slim shoulder; and as he hobbled he told her how he
had helped Jan into his cabin in just this same way, and how at the end
Jan had collapsed&mdash;just as he collapsed when he came to the cot.
He pulled Marie down with him&mdash;accidentally. His lips touched her
head. He laughed.</p>

<p>For a few moments he was like a drunken man in his new joy.
Willingly he would have gambled his life on his chance of winning. But
confidence displaced none of his cunning. He rubbed his hands and
said:</p>

<p>"Gawd, but won't it be a surprise for Jan? I told him that some day
I'd come. I told him!"</p>

<p>It would be a tremendous joke&mdash;this surprise he had in store
for Jan. He chuckled over it again and again as Marie went about her
work; and Marie's face flushed and her eyes were bright and she laughed
softly at this great love which Duval betrayed for her husband. No;
even the loss of his dogs and his outfit couldn't spoil his pleasure!
Why should it? He could get other dogs and another outfit&mdash;but it
had been three years since he had seen Jan Thoreau! When Marie had
finished her work he put his hand suddenly to his eyes and said:</p>

<p>"Peste! but last night's storm must have hurt my eyes. The light
blinds them, ma cheri. Will you put it out, and sit down near me, so
that I can see you as you talk, and tell me all that has happened to
Jan Thoreau since that winter three years ago?"</p>

<p>She put out the light, and threw open the door of the box-stove. In
the dim firelight she sat on a stool beside Blake's cot. Her faith in
him was like that of a child. She was twenty-two. Blake was fifteen
years older. She felt the immense superiority of his age.</p>

<p>This man, you must understand, had been more than a brother to Jan.
He had been a father. He had risked his life. He had saved him from
death. And Marie, as she sat at his side, did not think of him as a
young man&mdash;thirty-seven. She talked to him as she might have
talked to an elder brother of Jan's, and with something like the same
reverence in her voice.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate&mdash;for her&mdash;that Jan had loved Duval, and
that he had never tired of telling her about him. And now, when Blake's
caution warned him to lie no more about the days of plague in Duval's
cabin, she told him&mdash;as he had asked her&mdash;about herself and
Jan; how they had lived during the last three years, the important
things that had happened to them, and what they were looking forward
to. He caught the low note of happiness that ran through her voice; and
with a laugh, a laugh that sounded real and wholesome, he put out his
hand in the darkness&mdash;for the fire had burned itself low&mdash;and
stroked her hair. She did not shrink from the caress. He was happy
because THEY were happy. That was her thought! And Blake did not go too
far.</p>

<p>She went on, telling Jan's life away, betraying him In her
happiness, crucifying him in her faith. Blake knew that she was telling
the truth. She did not know that Jan had killed Francois Breault, and
she believed that he would surely return&mdash;in three days. And the
way he had left her that morning! Yes, she confided even that to this
big brother of Jan, her cheeks flushing hotly in the darkness&mdash;how
he had hated to go, and held her a long time in his arms before he tore
himself away.</p>

<p>Had he taken his fiddle along with him? Yes&mdash;always that. Next
to herself he loved his violin. Oo-oo&mdash;no, no&mdash;she was not
jealous of the violin! Blake laughed&mdash;such a big, healthy, happy
laugh, with an odd tremble in it. He stroked her hair again, and his
fingers lay for an instant against her warm cheek.</p>

<p>And then, quite casually, he played his second big card.</p>

<p>"A man was found dead on the trail yesterday," he said. "Some one
killed him. He had a bullet through his lung. He was the mail-runner,
Francois Breault."</p>

<p>It was then, when he said that Breault had been murdered, that
Blake's hand touched Marie's cheek and fell to her shoulder. It was too
dark in the cabin to see. But under his hand he felt her grow suddenly
rigid, and for a moment or two she seemed to stop breathing. In the
gloom Blake's lips were smiling. He had struck, and he needed no light
to see the effect.</p>

<p>"Francois&mdash;Breault!" he heard her breathe at last, as if she
was fighting to keep something from choking her. "Francois
Breault&mdash;dead&mdash;killed by someone&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose slowly. His eyes followed her, a shadow in the gloom as she
moved toward the stove. He heard her strike a match, and when she
turned toward him again in the light of the oil-lamp, her face was pale
and her eyes were big and staring. He swung himself to the edge of the
cot, his pulse beating with the savage thrill of the inquisitor. Yet he
knew that it was not quite time for him to disclose himself&mdash;not
quite. He did not dread the moment when he would rise and tell her that
he was not injured, and that he was not M'sieu Duval, but Corporal
Blake of the Royal Mounted Police. He was eager for that moment. But he
waited&mdash;discreetly. When the trap was sprung there would be no
escape.</p>

<p>"You are sure&mdash;it was Francois Breault?" she said at last.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, the mail-runner. You knew him?"</p>

<p>She had moved to the table, and her hand was gripping the edge of
it. For a space she did not answer him, but seemed to be looking
somewhere through the cabin walls&mdash;a long way off. Ferret-like, he
was watching her, and saw his opportunity. How splendidly fate was
playing his way!</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and hobbled painfully to her, a splendid
hypocrite, a magnificent dissembler. He seized her hand and held it in
both his own. It was small and soft, but strangely cold.</p>

<p>"Ma cheri&mdash;my dear child&mdash;what makes you look like that?
What has the death of Francois Breault to do with you&mdash;you and
Jan?"</p>

<p>It was the voice of a friend, a brother, low, sympathetic, filled
just enough with anxiety. Only last winter, in just that way, it had
won the confidence and roused the hope of Pierrot's wife, over on the
Athabasca. In the summer that followed they hanged Pierrot. Gently
Blake spoke the words again. Marie's lips trembled. Her great eyes were
looking at him&mdash;straight into his soul, it seemed.</p>

<p>"You may tell me, ma cheri," he encouraged, barely above a whisper.
"I am Duval. And Jan&mdash;I love Jan."</p>

<p>He drew her back toward the cot, dragging his limb painfully, and
seated her again upon the stool. He sat beside her, still holding her
hand, patting it, encouraging her. The color was coming back into
Marie's cheeks. Her lips were growing full and red again, and suddenly
she gave a trembling little laugh as she looked up into Blake's face.
His presence began to dispel the terror that had possessed her all at
once.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Marie."</p>

<p>He saw the shudder that passed through her slim shoulders.</p>

<p>"They had a fight&mdash;here&mdash;in this cabin&mdash;three days
ago," she confessed. "It must have been&mdash;the day&mdash;he was
killed."</p>

<p>Blake knew the wild thought that was in her heart as she watched
him. The muscles of his jaws tightened. His shoulders grew tense. He
looked over her head as if he, too, saw something beyond the cabin
walls. It was Marie's hand that gripped his now, and her voice, panting
almost, was filled with an agonized protest.</p>

<p>"No, no, no&mdash;it was not Jan," she moaned. "It was not Jan who
killed him!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Blake.</p>

<p>He looked about him as if there was a chance that someone might hear
the fatal words she had spoken. It was a splendid bit of acting, almost
unconscious, and tremendously effective. The expression in his face
stabbed to her heart like a cold knife. Convulsively her fingers
clutched more tightly at his hands. He might as well have spoken the
words: "It was Jan, then, who killed Francois Breault!"</p>

<p>Instead of that he said:</p>

<p>"You must tell me everything, Marie. How did it happen? Why did they
fight? And why has Jan gone away so soon after the killing? For Jan's
sake, you must tell me&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>He waited. It seemed to him that he could hear the fighting struggle
in Marie's breast. Then she began, brokenly, a little at a time, now
and then barely whispering the story. It was a woman's story, and she
told it like a woman, from the beginning. Perhaps at one time the
rivalry between Jan Thoreau and Francois Breault, and their struggle
for her love, had made her heart beat faster and her cheeks flush warm
with a woman's pride of conquest, even though she had loved one and had
hated the other. None of that pride was in her voice now, except when
she spoke of Jan.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;like that&mdash;children together&mdash;we grew up," she
confided. "It was down there at Wollaston Post, in the heart of the big
forests, and when I was a baby it was Jan who carried me about on his
shoulders. Oui, even then he played the violin. I loved it. I loved
Jan&mdash;always. Later, when I was seventeen, Francois Breault
came."</p>

<p>She was trembling.</p>

<p>"Jan has told me a little about those days," lied Blake. "Tell me
the rest, Marie."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I knew I was going to be Jan's wife," she went on, the
hands she had withdrawn from his twisting nervously in her lap. "We
both knew. And yet&mdash;he had not spoken&mdash;he had not been
definite. Oo-oo, do you understand, M'sieu Duval? It was my fault at
the beginning! Francois Breault loved me. And so&mdash;I played with
him&mdash;only a little, m'sieu!&mdash;to frighten Jan into the thought
that he might lose me. I did not know what I was doing. No&mdash;no; I
didn't understand.</p>

<p>"Jan and I were married, and on the day Jan saw the
missioner&mdash;a week before we were made man and wife&mdash;Francois
Beault came in from the trail to see me, and I confessed to him, and
asked his forgiveness. We were alone. And he&mdash;Francois
Breault&mdash;was like a madman."</p>

<p>She was panting. Her hands were clenched. "If Jan hadn't heard my
cries, and come just in time&mdash;" she breathed.</p>

<p>Her blazing eyes looked up into Blake's face. He understood, and
nodded.</p>

<p>"And it was like that&mdash;again&mdash;three days ago," she
continued. "I hadn't seen Breault in two years&mdash;two years ago down
at Wollaston Post. And he was mad. Yes, he must have been mad when he
came three days ago. I don't know that he came so much for me as it was
to kill Jan, He said it was Jan. Ugh, and it was here&mdash;in the
cabin&mdash;that they fought!"</p>

<p>"And Jan&mdash;punished him," said Blake in a low voice.</p>

<p>Again the convulsive shudder swept through Marie's shoulders.</p>

<p>"It was strange&mdash;what happened, m'sieu. I was going to shoot.
Yes, I would have shot him when the chance came. But all at once
Francois Breault sprang back to the door, and he cried: 'Jan Thoreau, I
am mad&mdash;mad! Great God, what have I done?' Yes, he said that,
m'sieu, those very words&mdash;and then he was gone."</p>

<p>"And that same day&mdash;a little later&mdash;Jan went away from the
cabin, and was gone a long time," whispered Blake. "Was it not so,
Marie?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he went to his trap-line, m'sieu."</p>

<p>For the first time Blake made a movement. He took her face boldly
between his two hands, and turned it so that her staring eyes were
looking straight into his own. Every fiber in his body was trembling
with the thrill of his monstrous triumph. "My dear little girl, I must
tell you the truth," he said. "Your husband, Jan, did not go to his
trap-line three days ago. He followed Francois Breault, and killed him.
And I am not John Duval. I am Corporal Blake of the Mounted Police, and
I have come to get Jan, that he may be hanged by the neck until he is
dead for his crime. I came for that. But I have changed my mind. I have
seen you, and for you I would give even a murderer his life. Do you
understand? For YOU&mdash;YOU&mdash;YOU&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then came the grand finale, just as he had planned it. His words
had stupefied her. She made no movement, no sound&mdash;only her great
eyes seemed alive. And suddenly he swept her into his arms with the
wild passion of a beast. How long she lay against his breast, his arms
crushing her, his hot lips on her face, she did not know.</p>

<p>The world had grown suddenly dark. But in that darkness she heard
his voice; and what it was saying roused her at last from the
deadliness of her stupor. She strained against him, and with a wild cry
broke from his arms, and staggered across the cabin floor to the door
of her bedroom. Blake did not pursue her. He let the darkness of that
room shut her in. He had told her&mdash;and she understood.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders as he rose to his feet. Quite calmly, in
spite of the wild rush of blood through his body, he went to the cabin
door, opened it, and looked out into the night. It was full of stars,
and quiet.</p>

<p>It was quiet in that inner room, too&mdash;so quiet that one might
fancy he could hear the beating of a heart. Marie had flung herself in
the farthest corner, beyond the bed. And there her hand had touched
something. It was cold&mdash;the chill of steel. She could almost have
screamed, in the mighty reaction that swept through her like an
electric shock. But her lips were dumb and her hand clutched tighter at
the cold thing.</p>

<p>She drew it toward her inch by inch, and leveled it across the bed.
It was Jan's goose-gun, loaded with buck-shot. There was a single
metallic click as she drew the hammer back. In the doorway, looking at
the stars, Blake did not hear.</p>

<p>Marie waited. She was not reasoning things now, except that in the
outer room there was a serpent that she must kill. She would kill him
as he came between her and the light; then she would follow over Jan's
trail, overtake him somewhere, and they would flee together. Of that
much she thought ahead. But chiefly her mind, her eyes, her brain, her
whole being, were concentrated on the twelve-inch opening between the
bedroom door and the outer room. The serpent would soon appear there.
And then&mdash;</p>

<p>She heard the cabin door close, and Blake's footsteps approaching.
Her body did not tremble now. Her forefinger was steady on the trigger.
She held her breath&mdash;and waited. Blake came to the deadline and
stopped. She could see one arm and a part of his shoulder. But that was
not enough. Another half step&mdash;six inches&mdash;four even, and she
would fire. Her heart pounded like a tiny hammer in her breast.</p>

<p>And then the very life in her body seemed to stand still. The cabin
door had opened suddenly, and someone had entered. In that moment she
would have fired, for she knew that it must be Jan who had returned.
But Blake had moved. And now, with her finger on the trigger, she heard
his cry of amazement:</p>

<p>"Sergeant Fitzgerald!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Put up your gun, Corporal. Have you got Jan Thoreau?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;is gone."</p>

<p>"That is lucky for us." It was the stranger's voice, filled with a
great relief. "I have traveled fast to overtake you. Matao, the
half-breed, was stabbed in a quarrel soon after you left; and before he
died he confessed to killing Breault. The evidence is conclusive. Ugh,
but this fire is good! Anybody at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Blake slowly. "Mrs. Thoreau&mdash;is&mdash;at home."</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_5">L'ANGE</a></h3>

<p>She stood in the doorway of a log cabin that was overgrown with
woodvine and mellow with the dull red glow of the climbing bakneesh,
with the warmth of the late summer sun falling upon her bare head.
Cummins' shout had brought her to the door when we were still half a
rifle shot down the river; a second shout, close to shore, brought her
running down toward me. In that first view that I had of her, I called
her beautiful. It was chiefly, I believe, because of her splendid hair.
John Cummins' shout of homecoming had caught her with it undone, and
she greeted us with the dark and lustrous masses of it sweeping about
her shoulders and down to her hips. That is, she greeted Cummins, for
he had been gone for nearly a month. I busied myself with the canoe for
that first half minute or so.</p>

<p>Then it was that I received my introduction and for the first time
touched the hand of Melisse Cummins, the Florence Nightingale of
several thousand square miles of northern wilderness. I saw, then, that
what I had at first taken for our own hothouse variety of beauty was a
different thing entirely, a type that would have disappointed many
because of its strength and firmness. Her hair was a glory, brown and
soft. No woman could have criticized its loveliness. But the flush that
I had seen in her face, flower-like at a short distance, was a tan that
was almost a man's tan. Her eyes were of a deep blue and as clear as
the sky; but in them, too, there was a strength that was not altogether
feminine. There was strength in her face, strength in the poise of her
firm neck, strength in every movement of her limbs and body. When she
spoke, it was in a voice which, like her hair, was adorable. I had
never heard a sweeter voice, and her firm mouth was all at once not
only gentle and womanly, but almost girlishly pretty.</p>

<p>I could understand, now, why Melisse Cummins was the heroine of a
hundred true tales of the wilderness, and I could understand as well
why there was scarcely a cabin or an Indian hut in that ten thousand
square miles of wilderness in which she had not, at one time or
another, been spoken of as "L'ange Meleese." And yet, unlike that other
"angel" of flesh and blood, Florence Nightingale, the story of Melisse
Cummins and her work will live and die with her in that little cabin
two hundred miles straight north of civilization. No, that is wrong.
For the wilderness will remember. It will remember, as it has
remembered Father Duchene and the Missioner of Lac Bain and the heroic
days of the early voyageurs. A hundred "Meleeses" will bear her memory
in name&mdash;for all who speak her name call her "Meleese," and not
Melisse.</p>

<p>The wilderness itself may never forget, as it has never forgotten
beautiful Jeanne D'Arcambal, who lived and died on the shore of the
great bay more than one hundred and sixty years ago. It will never
forget the great heart this woman has given to her "people" from the
days of girlhood; it will not forget the thousand perils she faced to
seek out the sick, the plague-stricken and the starving; in old age
there will still be those who will remember the first prayers to the
real God that she taught them in childhood; and children still to come,
in cabin, tepee and hut, will live to bless the memory of L'ange
Meleese, who made possible for them a new birthright and who in the
wild places lived to the full measure and glory of the Golden Rule.</p>

<p>To find Meleese Cummins and her home in the wilderness, one must
start at Le Pas as the last outpost of civilization and strike
northward through the long Pelican Lake waterways to Reindeer Lake.
Nearly forty miles up the east shore of the lake, the adventurer will
come to the mouth of the Gray Loon&mdash;narrow and silent stream that
winds under overhanging forests&mdash;and after that a two-hours'
journey in a canoe will bring one to the Cummins' cabin.</p>

<p>It is set in a clearing, with the thick spruce and balsam and cedar
hemming it in, and a tall ridge capped with golden birch rising behind
it. In that clearing John Cummins raises a little fruit and a few
vegetables during the summer months; but it is chiefly given up to
three or four huge plots of scarlet moose-flowers, a garden of Labrador
tea, and wild flowering plants and vines of half a dozen varieties. And
where the radiant moose-flowers grow thickest, screened from the view
of the cabin by a few cedars and balsams, are the rough wooden slabs
that mark seven graves. Six of them are the graves of
children&mdash;little ones who died deep in the wilderness and whose
tiny bodies Meleese Cummins could not leave to the savage and pitiless
loneliness of the forests, but whom she has brought together that they
might have company in what she calls her, "Little Garden of God."</p>

<p>Those little graves tell the story of Meleese&mdash;the woman who,
all heart and soul, has buried her own one little babe in that garden
of flowers. One of the slabs marks the grave of an Indian baby, whose
little dead body Meleese Cummins carried to her cabin in her own strong
arms from twenty miles back in the forest, when the temperature was
fifty degrees below zero. Another of them, a baby boy, a French
half-breed and his wife brought down from fifty miles up the Reindeer
and begged "L'ange Meleese" to let it rest with the others, where "it
might not be lonely and would not be frightened by the howl of the
wolves." It was a wild and half Indian mother who said that!</p>

<p>It was almost twenty years ago that the romance began in the lives
of John and Meleese Cummins. Meleese was then ten years old; and she
still remembers as vividly as though they were but memories of
yesterday the fears and wild tales of that one terrible winter when the
"Red Terror"&mdash;the smallpox&mdash;swept in a pitiless plague of
death throughout the northern wilderness. It was then that there came
down from the north, one bitter cold day, a ragged and half-starved
boy, whose mother and father had died of the plague in a little cabin
fifty miles away, and who from the day he staggered into the home of
Henry Janesse, became Meleese's playmate and chum. This boy was John
Cummins.</p>

<p>When Janesse moved to Fort Churchill, where Meleese might learn more
in the way of reading and writing and books than her parents could
teach her, John Cummins went with her. He went with them to Nelson
House, and from there to Split Lake, where Janesse died. From that
time, at the age of eighteen, he became the head and support of the
home. When he was twenty and Meleese eighteen, the two were married by
a missioner from Nelson House. The following autumn the young wife's
mother died, and that winter Meleese began her remarkable work among
her "people."</p>

<p>In their little cabin on the Gray Loon, one will hear John Cummins
say but little about himself; but there is a glow in his eyes and a
flush in his cheeks as he tells of that first day he came home from a
three-days journey over a long trap line to find his home cold and
fireless, and a note written by Meleese telling him that she had gone
with a twelve-year-old boy who had brought her word through twenty
miles of forest that his mother was dying. That first "case" was more
terrible for John Cummins than for his wife, for it turned out to be
smallpox, and for six weeks Meleese would allow him to come no nearer
than the edge of the clearing' in which the pest-ridden cabin stood.
First the mother, and then the boy, she nursed back to life, locking
the door against the two husbands, who built themselves a shack in the
edge of the forest. Half a dozen times Meleese Cummins has gone through
ordeals like that unscathed. Once it was to nurse a young Indian mother
through the dread disease, and again she went into a French trapper's
cabin where husband, wife and daughter were all sick with the malady.
At these times, when the "call" came to Meleese from a far cabin or
tepee, John Cummins would give up the duties of his trap line to
accompany her, and would pitch his tent or make him a shack close by,
where he could watch over her, hunt food for the afflicted people and
keep up the stack of needed firewood and water.</p>

<p>But there were times when the "calls" came during the husband's
absence, and, if they were urgent, Meleese went alone, trusting to her
own splendid strength and courage. A half-breed woman came to her one
day, in the dead of winter, from twenty miles across the lake. Her
husband had frozen one of his feet, and the "frost malady" would kill
him, she said, unless he had help. Scarcely knowing what she could do
in such a case, Meleese left a note for her husband, and on snowshoes
the two heroic women set off across the wind-swept and unsheltered
lake, with the thermometer fifty degrees below zero. It was a terrible
venture, but the two won out. When Meleese saw the frozen man, she knew
that there was but one thing to do, and with all the courage of her
splendid heart she amputated his foot. The torture of that terrible
hour no one will ever know. But when John Cummins returned to his home
and, wild with fear, followed across the lake, he scarcely recognized
the Meleese who flung herself sobbing into his arms when he found her.
For two weeks after that Meleese herself was sick. Thus, through the
course of years, it came about that it was, indeed, a stranger in the
land who had not heard her name. During the summer months Meleese's
work, in place of duty, was a pleasure. With her husband she made canoe
journeys for fifty miles about her home, hearing with her the teachings
of cleanliness, of health and of God. She was the first to hold to her
own loving breast many little children who came into their wild and
desolate inheritance of life. She was the first to teach a hundred
childish lips to say "Now I lay me down to sleep," and more than one
woman she made to see the clear and starry way to brighter life.</p>

<p>Far up on Reindeer Lake, close to the shore, there is a towering
"lob-stick tree"&mdash;which is a tall spruce or cedar lopped of all
its branches to the very crest, which is trimmed in the form of a
plume. A tree thus shriven and trimmed is the Cree cenotaph to one held
in almost spiritual reverence, and the tree far up on Reindeer Lake is
one of the half dozen or more "lob-sticks" dedicated to Meleese. Six
weeks Meleese and John Cummins spent in an Indian camp at this point,
and when at last the two bade their primitive friends good-bye and left
for home, the little Indian children and the women followed their canoe
along the edge of a stream and flung handfuls of flowers after
them.</p>

<p>Of what Meleese Cummins and her husband know of the great outside
world, or of what they do not know, it is wisest to leave unsaid.
Details have often marred a picture. They are children of the
wilderness, born of that wilderness, bred of it, and life of it&mdash;a
beating and palpitating part of a world which few can understand. I
doubt if one or the other has ever heard of a William Shakespeare or a
Tennyson, for it has not been in my mind or desire to ask; but they do
know the human heart as it beats and throbs in a land that is
desolation and loneliness, where poetry runs not in lines and meters,
but in the bloom of the wild flower, the rush of the rapid, the thunder
of the waterfall and the murmuring of the wind in the spruce tops;
where drama exists not in the epic lines of literature, but in the hunt
cry of the wolf, the death dirges of the storms that wail down from the
Barrens, and in the strange cries that rise up out of the silent
forests, where for a half of each year life is that endless strife that
leaves behind only those whom we term the survival of the fittest.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_6">THE CASE OF BEAUVAIS</a></h3>

<p>Madness? Perhaps. And yet if it was madness. . . .</p>

<p>But strange things happen up there, gentlemen. I have found it
sometimes hard to define that word. There are so many kinds of madness,
so many ways in which the human brain may go wrong; and so often it
happens that what we call madness is both reasonable and just. It is
so. Yes. A little reason is good for us, a little more makes wise men
of some of us&mdash;but when our reason over-grows us and we reach too
far, something breaks and we go insane.</p>

<p>But I will tell you the story. That is what you want to hear, and
you expect that it will be prejudiced&mdash;that I will either
deliberately attempt to protect and prolong a human life, or shorten
and destroy it. I shall do neither, gentlemen of the Royal Mounted
Police. I have a faith in you that is in its way an unbounded as my
faith in God. I have looked up to you in all my life in the wilderness
as the heart of chivalry and the soul of honor and fairness to all men.
Pathfinders, men of iron, guardians of people and spaces of which
civilization knows but little, I have taught my children of the forests
to honor, obey and to trust you. And so I shall tell you the story
without prejudice, with the gratitude of a missioner who has lived his
life for forty years in the wilderness, gentlemen.</p>

<p>I am a Catholic. It is four hundred miles straight north by
dog-sledge or snowshoe to my cabin, and this is the first time in
nineteen years that I have been down to the edge of the big world which
I remember now as little more than a dream. But up there I knew that my
duty lay, just at the edge of the Big Barren. See! My hands are knotted
like the snarl of a tree. The glare of your lights hurts my eyes. I
traveled to-day in the middle of your street because my moccasined feet
stumbled on the smoothness of your walks. People stared, and some of
them laughed.</p>

<p>Forty years I have lived in another world. You&mdash;and especially
you gentlemen who have trailed in the Patrols of the north&mdash;know
what that world is. As it shapes different hands, as it trains
different feet, as it gives to us different eyes, so also it has bred
into my forest children hearts and souls that may be a little
different, and a code of right and wrong that too frequently has had no
court of law to guide it. So judge fairly, gentlemen of the Royal
Mounted Police! Understand, if you can.</p>

<p>It was a terrible winter&mdash;that winter of Le Mort Rouge. So far
down as men and children now living will remember, it will be called by
my people the winter of Famine and Red Death. Starvation,
gentlemen&mdash;and the smallpox. People died like&mdash;what shall I
say? It is not easy to describe a thing like that. They died in tepees.
They died in shacks. They died on the trail. From late December until
March I said my prayers over the dead. You are wondering what all this
has to do with my story; why it matters that the caribou had migrated
in vast herds to the westward, and there was no food; why it matters
that there were famine and plague in the great unknown land, and that
people were dying and our world going through a cataclysm. My backwoods
eyes can see your thought. What has all this to do with Joseph Brecht?
What has it to do with Andre Beauvais? Why does this little forest
priest take up so much time in telling so little? you ask. And because
it has its place&mdash;because it has its meaning&mdash;I ask you for
permission to tell my story in my own way. For these sufferings, this
hunger and pestilence and death, had a strange and terrible effect on
many human creatures that were left alive when spring came. It was like
a great storm that had swept through a forest of tall trees. A storm of
suffering that left heads bowed, shoulders bent, and minds gone. Yes,
GONE!</p>

<p>Since that winter of Le Mort Rouge I know of eyes into which the
life of laughter will never come again; I know of strong men who became
as little children; I have seen faces that were fair with youth shrivel
into age&mdash;and my people call it noot' akutawin keskwawin&mdash;the
cold and hungry madness. May God help Andre Beauvais!</p>

<p>I will tell the story now.</p>

<p>It was in June. The last of the mush-snows had gone early, nearly a
fortnight before, and the waters were free from ice, when word was
brought to me that Father Boget was dying at Old Fort Reliance. Father
Boget was twenty years older than I, and I called him mon pere. He was
a father to me in our earlier years. I made haste to reach him that I
might hold his hand before he died, if that was possible. And you,
Sergeant McVeigh, who have spent years in that country of the Great
Slave, know what a race with death from Christie Bay to Old Fort
Eeliance would be. To follow the broken and twisted waters of the Great
Slave would mean two hundred miles, while to cut straight across the
land by smaller streams and lakelets meant less than seventy. But on
your maps that space of seventy miles is a blank. You have in it no
streams and no larger waters. You know little of it. But I can tell
you, for I have been though it. It is a Lost Hell. It is a vast country
in which berry bushes grow abundantly, but on which there are no
berries, where there are forests and swamps, but not a living creature
to inhabit them; a country of water in which there are no fish, of air
in which there are no birds, of plants without flowers&mdash;a reeking,
stinking country of brimstone, a hell. In your Blue Books you have
called it the Sulphur Country. And this country, as you draw a line
from Christie Bay to Old Fort Reliance, is straight between. Mon pere
was dying, and my time was short. I decided to venture it&mdash;cut
across that Sulphur Country, and I sought for a man to accompany me. I
could find none. To the Indian it was the land of Wetikoo&mdash;the
Devil Country; to the Breeds it was filled with horror. Forty miles
distant there was a man I knew would go, a white man. But to reach him
would lose me three days, and I was about to set out alone when the
stranger came. He was, indeed, a strange man. When he came to what I
called my chateau, from nowhere, going nowhere, I hardly knew whether
to call him young or old. But I made my guess. That terrib le winter
had branded him. When I asked him his name, he said:</p>

<p>"I am a wanderer, and in wandering I have lost my name. Call me
M'sieu."</p>

<p>I found this was a long speech for him, that his tongue was tied by
a horrible silence. When I told him where I was going, and described
the country I was going through, and that I wanted a man, he merely
nodded that he would accompany me.</p>

<p>We started in a canoe, and I placed him ahead of me so that I could
make out, if I could, something of what he was. His hair was dark. His
beard was dark. His eyes were sunken but strangely clear. They puzzled
me. They were always questing. Always seeking. And always expecting, it
seemed to me. A man of unfathomable mystery, of unutterable tragedy, of
a silence that was almost inhuman. Was he mad? I ask you,
gentlemen&mdash;was he mad? And I leave the answer to you. To me he was
good. When I told him what mon pere had been to me, and that I wanted
to reach him before he died, he spoke no word of hope or
sympathy&mdash;but worked until his muscles cracked. We ate together,
we drank together, we slept side by side&mdash;and it was like eating
and drinking and sleeping with a sphinx which some strange miracle had
endowed with life.</p>

<p>The second day we entered the Sulphur Country. The stink of it was
in our nostrils that second night we camped. The moon rose, and we saw
it as if through the fumes of a yellow smoke. Far behind us we heard a
wolf howl, and it was the last sound of life. With the dawn we went on.
We passed through broad, low morasses out of which rose the sulphurous
fogs. In many places the water we touched with our hands was hot; in
other places the forests we paddled through were so dense they were
almost tropical. And lifeless. Still, with the stillness of death for
thousands and perhaps tens of thousands of years. The food we ate
seemed saturated with the vileness of sulphur; it seeped into our
water-bags; it turned us to the color of saffron; it was terrible,
frightening, inconceivable. And still we went on by compass, and M'sieu
showed no fear&mdash;even less, gentlemen, than did I.</p>

<p>And then, on the third day&mdash;in the heart of this diseased and
horrible region&mdash;we made a discovery that drew a strange cry even
from those mysteriously silent lips of M'sieu.</p>

<p>It was the print of a naked human foot in a bar of mud.</p>

<p>How it came there, why it was there, and why if was a naked foot I
suppose were the first thoughts that leaped into our startled minds.
What man could live in these infernal regions? WAS it a man, or was it
the footprint of some primeval ape, a monstrous survival of the
centuries?</p>

<p>The trail led through a steaming slough in which the mud and water
were tepid and which grew rank with yellow reeds and thick
grasses&mdash;grasses that were almost flesh-like, it seemed to me, as
if swollen and about to burst from some dreadful disease, Perhaps your
scientists can tell why sulphur has this effect on vegetation. It is
so; there was sulphur in the very wood we burned. Through those reeds
and grasses we soon found where a narrow trail was beaten, and then we
came to a rise of land sheltered in timber, a sort of hill in that flat
world, and on the crest of this hill we found a cabin.</p>

<p>Yes, a cabin; a cabin built roughly of logs, and it was yellow with
sulphur, as if painted. We went inside and we found there the man whom
you know as Joseph Brecht. I did not look at M'sieu when he first rose
before us, but I heard a great gasp from his throat behind me. And I
think I stood as if life had suddenly gone out of me. Joseph Brecht was
half naked. His feet were bare. He looked like a wild man, with his
uncut hair&mdash;a wild man except that his face was smooth. Curious
that a man would shave there! And not so odd, perhaps, when one knows
how a beard gathers sulphur. He had risen from a cot on which there was
a bed of boughs, and in the light that came in through the open door he
looked terribly emaciated, with the skin drawn tightly over his cheek
bones. It was he who spoke first.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have come," he said, his eyes staring wildly. "I
guess I am dying. Some water, please. There is a spring back of the
cabin."</p>

<p>Quite sanely he spoke, and yet the words were scarcely out of his
mouth when he fell back upon the cot, his eyes rolling in the top of
his head, his mouth agape, his breath coming in great panting gasps. It
was a strange sickness. I will not trouble you with all the details.
You are anxious for the story&mdash;the tragedy&mdash;which alone will
count with you gentlemen of the law. It came out in his fever, and in
the fits of sanity into which he at times succeeded in rousing himself.
His name, he said, was Joseph Brecht. For two years he had lived in
that sulphur hell. He had, by accident, found the spring of fresh,
sweet water trickling out of the hill&mdash;another miracle for which I
have not tried to account; he built his cabin; for two years he had
gone with his canoe to the shore of the great Slave, forty miles
distant, for the food he ate. But WHY was he here? That was the story
that came bit by bit, half in his fever, half in his sanity. I will
tell it in my own words. He was a Government man, mapping out the last
timber lines along the edge of the Great Barren, when he first met
Andre Beauvais and his wife, Marie. An accident took him to their
cabin, a sprained leg. Andre was a fox-hunter, and it was when he was
coming home from one of his trips that he found Joseph Brecht helpless
in the deep snow, and carried him on his shoulders to his cabin.</p>

<p>Ah, gentlemen, it was the old story&mdash;the story old as time. In
his sanity he told us about Marie, I hovering over him closely, M'sieu
sitting back in the shadows. She was like some wonderful wildflower,
French, a little Indian. He told us how her long black hair would
stream in a shining cascade, soft as the breast of a swan, to her knees
and below; how it would hang again in two great, lustrous braids, and
how her eyes were limpid pools that set his soul afire, and how her
slim, beautiful body filled him with a monstrous desire. She must have
been beautiful. And her husband, Andre Beauvais, worshipped her, and
the ground she trod on. And he had the faith in her that a mother has
in her child. It was a sublime love, and Joseph Brecht told us about it
as he lay there, dying, as he supposed. In that faith of his Andre went
unsuspectingly to his trap-lines and his poison-trails, and Marie and
Joseph were for many hours at a time alone, sometimes for a day,
sometimes for two days, and occasionally for three, for even after his
limb had regained its strength Joseph feigned that it was bad. It was a
hard fight, he said&mdash;a hard fight for him to win her; but win her
he did, utterly, absolutely, heart, body and soul. Remember, he was
from the South, with all its power of language, all its tricks of love,
all its furtiveness of argument, a strong man with a strong
mind&mdash;and she had lived all her life in the wilderness. She was no
match for him. She surrendered. He told us how, after that, he would
unbind her wonderful hair and pillow his face in it; how he lived in a
heaven of transport, how utterly she gave herself to him in those times
when Andre, was away.</p>

<p>Did he love her?</p>

<p>Yes, in that mad passion of the brute. But not as you and I might
love a woman, gentlemen. Not as Andre loved her. Whether she had a
heart or a soul it did not matter. His eyes were blind with an
insensate joy when he shrouded himself in her wonderful hair. To see
the wild color painting her face like a flower filled his veins with
fire. The beauty of her, the touch of her, the mad beat of her heart
against him made him like a drunken man in his triumph. Love? Yes, the
love of the brute! He prolonged his stay. He had no idea of taking her
with him. When the time came, he would go. Day after day, week after
week he put it off, feigning that the bone of his leg was affected, and
Andre Beauvais treated him like a brother. He told us all this as he
lay there in his cabin in that sulphur hell. I am a man of God, and I
do not lie.</p>

<p>Is there need to tell you that Andre discovered them? Yes, he found
them&mdash;and with that wonderful hair of hers so closely about them
that he was still bound in the tresses when the discovery came.</p>

<p>Andre had come in exhausted, and unexpectedly. There was a terrible
fight, and in spite of his exhaustion he would have killed Joseph
Brecht if at the last moment the latter had not drawn his revolver.
After all is said and done, gentlemen, can a woman love but once?
Joseph Brecht fired. In that infinitesimal moment between the leveling
of the gun and the firing of the shot Marie Beauvais found answer to
that question. Who was it she loved? She sprang to her husband's
breast, sheltering him with the body that had been disloyal to its
soul, and she died there&mdash;with a bullet through her heart.</p>

<p>Joseph Brecht told us how, in the horror of his work&mdash;and
possessed now by a terrible fear&mdash;he ran from the cabin and fled
for his life. And Andre Beauvais must have remained with his dead. For
it was many hours later before he took up the trail of the man whom he
made solemn oath to his God to kill. Like a hunted hare, Joseph Brecht
eluded him, and it was weeks before the fox-trapper came upon him.
Andre Beauvais scorned to kill him from ambush. He wanted to choke his
life out slowly, with his two hands, and he attacked him openly and
fairly.</p>

<p>And in that cabin&mdash;gasping for breath, dying as he thought,
Joseph Brecht said to us: "It was one or the other. He had the best of
me. I drew my revolver again&mdash;and killed him, killed Andre
Beauvais, as I had killed his wife, Marie!"</p>

<p>Here in the South Joseph Brecht might not have been a bad man,
gentlemen. In every man's heart there is a devil, but we do not know
the man as bad until the devil is roused. And passion, the mad passion
for a woman, had roused him. Now that it had made twice a murderer of
him the devil slunk back into his hiding, and the man who had once been
the clean-living, red-blooded Joseph Brecht was only a husk without a
heart, slinking from place to place in the evasion of justice. For you
men of the Royal Mounted Police were on his trail. You would have
caught him, but you did not think of seeking for him in the Sulphur
Hell. For two years he had lived there, and when he finished his story
he was sitting on the edge of the cot, quite sane, gentlemen.</p>

<p>And for the first time M'sieu, my comrade, spoke.</p>

<p>"Let us bring up the dunnage from the canoe, mon pere."</p>

<p>He led the way out of the cabin, and I followed. We were fifty steps
away when he stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "I have forgotten something. I will overtake
you."</p>

<p>He turned back to the cabin, and I went on to the canoe.</p>

<p>He did not join me. When I returned with my burden, M'sieu appeared
at the door. He amazed me, startled me, I will say, gentlemen. I could
not imagine such a change as I saw in him&mdash;that man of horrible
silence, of grim, dark mystery. He was smiling; his white teeth shone;
his voice was the voice of another man. He seemed to me ten years
younger as he stood there, and as I dropped my load and went in he was
laughing, and his hand was laid pleasantly on my shoulder.</p>

<p>Across the cot, with his head stretched down to the floor, his eyes
bulging and his jaws agape, lay Joseph Brecht. I sprang to him. He was
dead. And then I SAW Gentlemen, he had been choked to death!</p>

<p>"He made one leetle meestake, mon pere. Andre Beauvais did not die.
I am Andre Beauvais."</p>

<p>That is all, gentlemen of the Royal Mounted. May the Law have
mercy!</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_7">THE OTHER MAN'S WIFE</a></h3>

<p>Thornton wasn't the sort of man in whom you'd expect to find the
devil lurking. He was big, blond, and broad-shouldered. When I first
saw him I thought he was an Englishman. That was at the post at Lac la
Biche, six hundred miles north of civilization. Scotty and I had been
doing some exploration work for the government, and for more than six
months we hadn't seen a real white man who looked like home.</p>

<p>We came in late at night, and the factor gave us a room in his
house. When we looked out of our window in the morning, we saw a little
shack about a hundred feet away, and in front of that shack was
Thornton, only half dressed, stretching himself in the sun, and
LAUGHING. There wasn't anything to laugh at, but we could see his teeth
shining white, and he grinned every minute while he went through a sort
of setting-up exercise.</p>

<p>When you begin to analyze a man, there is always some one human
trait that rises above all others, and that laugh was Thornton's. Even
the wolfish sledge-dogs at the post would wag their tails when they
heard it.</p>

<p>We soon established friendly relations, but I could not get very far
beyond the laugh. Indeed, Thornton was a mystery. DeBar, the factor,
said that he had dropped into the post six months before, with a pack
on his back and a rifle over his shoulder. He had no business,
apparently. He was not a propectory and it was only now and then that
he used his rifle, and then only to shoot at marks.</p>

<p>One thing puzzled DeBar more than all else. Thornton worked like
three men about the post, cutting winter fire-wood, helping to catch
and clean the tons of whitefish which were stored away for the dogs in
the company's ice-houses, and doing other things without end. For this
he refused all payment except his rations.</p>

<p>Scotty continued eastward to Churchill, and for seven weeks I bunked
with Thornton in the shack. At the end of those seven weeks I knew
little more about Thornton than at the beginning. I never had a closer
or more congenial chum, and yet in his conversation he never got beyond
the big woods, the mountains, and the tangled swamps. He was educated
and a gentleman, and I knew that in spite of his brown face and arms,
his hard muscles and splendid health, he was three-quarters tenderfoot.
But he loved the wilderness.</p>

<p>"I never knew what life could hold for a man until I came up here,"
he said to me one day, his gray eyes dancing in the light of a glorious
sunset.</p>

<p>"I'm ten years younger than I was two years ago."</p>

<p>"You've been two years in the north?"</p>

<p>"A year and ten months," he replied.</p>

<p>Something brought to my lips the words that I had forced back a
score of times.</p>

<p>"What brought you up here, Thornton?"</p>

<p>"Two things," he said quietly, "a woman&mdash;and a scoundrel."</p>

<p>He said no more, and I did not press the matter. There was a strange
tremble in his voice, something that I took to be a note of sadness;
but when he turned from the sunset to me his eyes were filled with a
yet stranger joy, and his big boyish laugh rang out with such wholesome
infectiousness that I laughed with him, in spite of myself.</p>

<p>That night, in our shack, he produced a tightly bound bundle of
letters about six inches thick, scattered them out before him on the
table, and began reading them at random, while I sat bolstered back in
my bunk, smoking and watching him. He was a curious study. Every little
while I'd hear him chuckling and rumbling, his teeth agleam, and
between these times he'd grow serious. Once I saw tears rolling down
his cheeks.</p>

<p>He puzzled me; and the more he puzzled me, the better I liked him.
Every night for a week he spent an hour or two reading those letters
over and over again. I had a dozen opportunities to see that they were
a woman's letters: but he never offered a word of explanation.</p>

<p>With the approach of September, I made preparations to leave for the
south, by way of Moose Factory and the Albany.</p>

<p>"Why not go the shorter way&mdash;by the Reindeer Lake water route
to Prince Albert?" asked Thornton. "If you'll do that, I'll go with
you."</p>

<p>His proposition delighted me, and we began planning for our trip.
From that hour there came a curious change in Thornton. It was as if he
had come into contact with some mysterious dynamo that had charged him
with a strange nervous energy. We were two days in getting our stuff
ready, and the night between he did not go to bed at all, but sat up
reading the letters, smoking, and then reading over again what he had
read half a hundred times before.</p>

<p>I was pretty well hardened, but during the first week of our canoe
trip he nearly had me bushed a dozen times. He insisted on getting away
before dawn, laughing, singing, and talking, and urged on the pace
until sunset. I don't believe that he slept two hours a night. Often,
when I woke up, I'd see him walking back and forth in the moonlight,
humming softly to himself. There was almost a touch of madness in it
all; but I knew that Thornton was sane.</p>

<p>One night&mdash;our fourteenth down&mdash;I awoke a little after
midnight, and as usual looked about for Thornton. It was glorious
night. There was a full moon over us, and with the lake at our feet,
and the spruce and balsam forest on each side of us, the whole scene
struck me as one of the most beautiful I had ever looked upon.</p>

<p>When I came out of our tent, Thornton was not in sight. Away across
the lake I heard a moose calling. Back of me an owl hooted softly, and
from miles away I could hear faintly the howling of a wolf. The night
sounds were broken by my own startled cry as I felt a hand fall,
without warning, upon my shoulder. It was Thornton. I had never seen
his face as it looked just then.</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful&mdash;glorious?" he cried softly.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful!" I said. "You won't see this down there,
Thornton!"</p>

<p>"Nor hear those sounds," he replied, his hand tightening on my arm.
"We're pretty close to God up here, aren't we? She'll like
it&mdash;I'll bring her back!"</p>

<p>"She!" He looked at me, his teeth shining in that wonderful silent
laugh. "I'm going to tell you about it," he said. "I can't keep it in
any longer. Let's go down by the lake."</p>

<p>We walked down and seated ourselves on the edge of a big rock.</p>

<p>"I told you that I came up here because of a woman&mdash;and a man,"
continued Thornton. "Well, I did. The man and woman were husband and
wife, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted himself with one of his chuckling laughs. There was
something in it that made me shudder.</p>

<p>"No use to tell you that I loved her," he went on. "I worshipped
her. She was my life. And I believe she loved me as much. I might have
added that there was a third thing that drove me up here&mdash;what
remained of the rag end of a man's honor."</p>

<p>"I begin to understand," I said, as he paused. "You came up here to
get away from the woman. But this woman&mdash;her husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>For the first time since I had known him I saw a flash of anger leap
into Thornton's face. He struck his hand against the rock.</p>

<p>"Her husband was a scoundrel, a brute, who came home from his club
drunk, a cheap money-spender, a man who wasn't fit to wipe the mud from
her little feet, much less call her wife! He ought to have been shot. I
can see it, now; and&mdash;well, I might as well tell you. I'm going
back to her!"</p>

<p>"You are?" I cried. "Has she got a divorce? Is her husband still
living?"</p>

<p>"No, she hasn't got a divorce, and her husband is still living; but
for all that, we've arranged it. Those were her letters I've been
reading, and she'll be at Prince Albert waiting for me on the
15th&mdash;three days from now. We shall be a little late, and that's
why I'm hustling so. I've kept away from her for two years, but I can't
do it any longer&mdash;and she says that if I do she'll kill herself.
So there you have it. She's the sweetest, most beautiful girl in the
whole world&mdash;eyes the color of those blue flowers you have up
here, brown hair, and&mdash;but you've got to see her when we reach
Prince Albert. You won't blame me for doing all this, then!"</p>

<p>I had nothing to say. At my silence he turned toward me suddenly,
with that happy smile of his, and said again:</p>

<p>"I tell you that you won't blame me when you see her. You'll envy
me, and you'll call me a confounded fool for staying away so long. It
has been terribly hard for both of us. I'll wager that she's no
sleepier than I am to-night, just from knowing that I'm hurrying to
her."</p>

<p>"You're pretty confident," I could not help sneering. "I don't
believe I'd wager much on such a woman. To be frank with you, Thornton,
I don't care to meet her, so I'll decline your invitation. I've a
little wife of my own, as true as steel, and I'd rather keep out of an
affair like this. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Thornton, and there was not the slightest
ill-humor in his voice. "You&mdash;you think I am a cur?"</p>

<p>"If you have stolen another man's wife&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"And the woman?"</p>

<p>"If she is betraying her husband, she is no better than you."</p>

<p>Thornton rose and stretched his long arms above his head.</p>

<p>"Isn't the moon glorious?" he cried exultantly. "She has never seen
a moon like that. She has never seen a world like this. Do you know
what we're going to do? We'll come up here and build a cabin,
and&mdash;and she'll know what a real man is at last! She deserves it.
And we'll have you up to visit us&mdash;you and your wife&mdash;two
months out of each year. But then"&mdash;he turned and laughed squarely
into my face&mdash;"you probably won't want your wife to know her."</p>

<p>"Probably not," I said, not without embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I don't blame you," he exclaimed, and before I could draw back he
had caught my hand and was shaking it hard in his own. "Let's be
friends a little longer, old man," he went on. "I know you'll change
your mind about the little girl and me when we reach Prince
Albert."</p>

<p>I didn't go to sleep again that night; and the half-dozen days that
followed were unpleasant enough&mdash;for me, at least. In spite of my
own coolness toward him, there was absolutely no change in Thornton.
Not once did he make any further allusion to what he had told me.</p>

<p>As we drew near to our journey's end, his enthusiasm and good
spirits increased. He had the bow end of the canoe, and I had abundant
opportunity of watching him. It was impossible not to like him, even
after I knew his story.</p>

<p>We reached Prince Albert on a Sunday, after three days' travel in a
buckboard. When we drove up in front of the hotel, there was just one
person on the long veranda looking out over the Saskatchewan. It was a
woman, reading a book.</p>

<p>As he saw her, I heard a great breath heave up inside Thornton's
chest. The woman looked up, stared for a moment, and then dropped her
book with a welcoming cry such as I had never heard before in my life.
She sprang down the steps, and Thornton leaped from the wagon. They met
there a dozen paces from me, Thornton catching her in his arms, and the
woman clasping her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>I heard her sobbing, and I saw Thornton kissing her again and again,
and then the woman pulled his blond head down close to her face. It was
sickening, knowing what I did, and I began helping the driver to throw
off our dunnage.</p>

<p>In about two minutes I heard Thornton calling me.</p>

<p>I didn't turn my head. Then Thornton came to me, and as he
straightened me around by the shoulders I caught a glimpse of the
woman. He was right&mdash;she was very beautiful.</p>

<p>"I told you that her husband was a scoundrel and a rake," he said
gently. "Well, he was&mdash;and I was that scoundrel! I came up here
for a chance of redeeming myself, and your big, glorious North has made
a man of me. Will you come and meet my wife?"</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_8">THE STRENGTH OF MEN</a></h3>

<p>There was the scent of battle in the air. The whole of Porcupine
City knew that it was coming, and every man and woman in its two
hundred population held their breath in anticipation of the struggle
between two men for a fortune&mdash;and a girl. For in some mysterious
manner rumor of the girl had got abroad, passing from lip to lip, until
even the children knew that there was some other thing than gold that
would play a part in the fight between Clarry O'Grady and Jan Larose.
On the surface it was not scheduled to be a fight with fists or guns.
But in Porcupine City there were a few who knew the "inner
story"&mdash;the story of the girl, as well as the gold, and those
among them who feared the law would have arbitrated in a different
manner for the two men if it had been in their power. But law is law,
and the code was the code. There was no alternative. It was an unusual
situation, and yet apparently simple of solution. Eighty miles north,
as the canoe was driven, young Jan Larose had one day staked out a rich
"find" at the headwaters of Pelican Creek. The same day, but later,
Clarry O'Grady had driven his stakes beside Jan's. It had been a race
to the mining recorder's office, and they had come in neck and neck.
Popular sentiment favored Larose, the slim, quiet, dark-eyed half
Frenchman. But there was the law, which had no sentiment. The recorder
had sent an agent north to investigate. If there were two sets of
stakes there could be but one verdict. Both claims would be thrown out,
and then&mdash;</p>

<p>All knew what would happen, or thought that they knew. It would be a
magnificent race to see who could set out fresh stakes and return to
the recorder's office ahead of the other. It would be a fight of brawn
and brain, unless&mdash;and those few who knew the "inner story" spoke
softly among themselves.</p>

<p>An ox in strength, gigantic in build, with a face that for days had
worn a sneering smile of triumph, O'Grady was already picked as a
ten-to-one winner. He was a magnificent canoeman, no man in Porcupine
City could equal him for endurance, and for his bow paddle he had the
best Indian in the whole Reindeer Lake country. He stalked up and down
the one street of Porcupine City, treating to drinks, cracking rough
jokes, and offering wagers, while Jan Larose and his long-armed Cree
sat quietly in the shade of the recorder's office waiting for the final
moment to come.</p>

<p>There were a few of those who knew the "inner story" who saw
something besides resignation and despair in Jan's quiet aloofness, and
in the disconsolate droop of his head. His face turned a shade whiter
when O'Grady passed near, dropping insult and taunt, and looking
sidewise at him in a way that only HE could understand. But he made no
retort, though his dark eyes glowed with a fire that never quite
died&mdash;unless it was when, alone and unobserved, he took from his
pocket a bit of buckskin in which was a silken tress of curling brown
hair. Then his eyes shone with a light that was soft and luminous, and
one seeing him then would have known that it was not a dream of gold
that filled his heart, but of a brown-haired girl who had broken
it.</p>

<p>On this day, the forenoon of the sixth since the agent had departed
into the north, the end of the tense period of waiting was expected.
Porcupine City had almost ceased to carry on the daily monotony of
business. A score were lounging about the recorder's office. Women
looked forth at frequent intervals through the open doors of the
"city's" cabins, or gathered in two and threes to discuss this biggest
sporting event ever known in the history of the town. Not a minute but
scores of anxious eyes were turned searchingly up the river, down which
the returning agent's canoe would first appear. With the dawn of this
day O'Grady had refused to drink. He was stripped to the waist. His
laugh was louder. Hatred as well as triumph glittered in his eyes, for
to-day Jan Larose looked him coolly and squarely in the face, and
nodded whenever he passed. It was almost noon when Jan spoke a few low
words to his watchful Indian and walked to the top of the cedar-capped
ridge that sheltered Porcupine City from the north winds.</p>

<p>From this ridge he could look straight into the north&mdash;the
north where he was born. Only the Cree knew that for five nights he had
slept, or sat awake, on the top of this ridge, with his face turned
toward the polar star, and his heart breaking with loneliness and
grief. Up there, far beyond where the green-topped forests and the sky
seemed to meet, he could see a little cabin nestling under the
stars&mdash;and Marie. Always his mind traveled back to the beginning
of things, no matter how hard he tried to forget&mdash;even to the old
days of years and years ago when he had toted the little Marie around
on his back, and had crumpled her brown curls, and had revealed to her
one by one the marvelous mysteries of the wilderness, with never a
thought of the wonderful love that was to come. A half frozen little
outcast brought in from the deep snows one day by Marie's father, he
became first her playmate and brother&mdash;and after that lived in a
few swift years of paradise and dreams. For Marie he had made of
himself what he was. He had gone to Montreal. He had learned to read
and write, he worked for the Company, he came to know the outside
world, and at last the Government employed him. This was a triumph. He
could still see the glow of pride and love in Marie's beautiful eyes
when he came home after those two years in the great city. The
Government sent for him each autumn after that. Deep into the
wilderness he led the men who made the red and black lined maps. It was
he who blazed out the northern limit of Banksian pine, and his name was
in Government reports down in black and white&mdash;so that Marie and
all the world could read.</p>

<p>One day he came back&mdash;and he found Clarry O'Grady at the
Cummins' cabin. He had been there for a month with a broken leg.
Perhaps it was the dangerous knowledge of the power of her
beauty&mdash;the woman's instinct in her to tease with her prettiness,
that led to Marie's flirtation with O'Grady. But Jan could not
understand, and she played with fire&mdash;the fire of two hearts
instead of one. The world went to pieces under Jan after that. There
came the day when, in fair fight, he choked the taunting sneer from
O'Grady's face back in the woods. He fought like a tiger, a mad demon.
No one ever knew of that fight. And with the demon still raging in his
breast he faced the girl. He could never quite remember what he had
said. But it was terrible&mdash;and came straight from his soul. Then
he went out, leaving Marie standing there white and silent. He did not
go back. He had sworn never to do that, and during the weeks that
followed it spread about that Marie Cummins had turned down Jan Larose,
and that Clarry O'Grady was now the lucky man. It was one of the
unexplained tricks of fate that had brought them together, and had set
their discovery stakes side by side on Pelican Creek.</p>

<p>To-day, in spite of his smiling coolness, Jan's heart rankled with a
bitterness that seemed to be concentrated of all the dregs that had
ever entered into his life. It poisoned him, heart and soul. He was not
a coward. He was not afraid of O'Grady.</p>

<p>And yet he knew that fate had already played the cards against him.
He would lose. He was almost confident of that, even while he nerved
himself to fight. There was the drop of savage superstition in him, and
he told himself that something would happen to beat him out. O'Grady
had gone into the home that was almost his own and had robbed him of
Marie. In that fight in the forest he should have killed him. That
would have been justice, as he knew it. But he had relented, half for
Marie's sake, and half because he hated to take a human life, even
though it were O'Grady's. But this time there would be no relenting. He
had come alone to the top of the ridge to settle the last doubts with
himself. Whoever won out, there would be a fight. It would be a
magnificent fight, like that which his grandfather had fought and won
for the honor of a woman years and years ago. He was even glad that
O'Grady was trying to rob him of what he had searched for and found.
There would be twice the justice in killing him now. And it would be
done fairly, as his grandfather had done it.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a piercing shout from the direction of the
river, followed by a wild call for him through Jackpine's moose-horn.
He answered the Cree's signal with a yell and tore down through the
bush. When he reached the foot of the ridge at the edge of the clearing
he saw the men, women and children of Porcupine City running to the
river. In front of the recorder's office stood Jackpine, bellowing
through his horn. O'Grady and his Indian were already shoving their
canoe out into the stream, and even as he looked there came a break in
the line of excited spectators, and through it hurried the agent toward
the recorder's cabin.</p>

<p>Side by side, Jan and his Indian ran to their canoe. Jackpine was
stripped to the waist, like O'Grady and his Chippewayan. Jan threw off
only his caribou-skin coat. His dark woolen shirt was sleeveless, and
his long slim arms, as hard as ribbed steel, were free. Half the crowd
followed him. He smiled, and waved his hand, the dark pupils of his
eyes shining big and black. Their canoe shot out until it was within a
dozen yards of the other, and those ashore saw him laugh into O'Grady's
sullen, set face. He was cool. Between smiling lips his white teeth
gleamed, and the women stared with brighter eyes and flushed cheeks,
wondering how Marie Cummins could have given up this man for the giant
hulk and drink-reddened face of his rival. Those among the men who had
wagered heavily against him felt a misgiving. There was something in
Jan's smile that was more than coolness, and it was not bravado. Even
as he smiled ashore, and spoke in low Cree to Jackpine, he felt at the
belt that he had hidden under the caribou-skin coat. There were two
sheaths there, and two knives, exactly alike. It was thus that his
grandfather had set forth one summer day to avenge a wrong, nearly
seventy years before.</p>

<p>The agent had entered the cabin, and now he reappeared, wiping his
sweating face with a big red handkerchief. The recorder followed. He
paused at the edge of the stream and made a megaphone of his hands.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he cried raucously, "both claims have been thrown
out!"</p>

<p>A wild yell came from O'Grady. In a single flash four paddles struck
the water, and the two canoes shot bow and bow up the stream toward the
lake above the bend. The crowd ran even with them until the low swamp
at the lake's edge stopped them. In that distance neither had gained a
yard advantage. But there was a curious change of sentiment among those
who returned to Porcupine City. That night betting was no longer two
and three to one on O'Grady. It was even money.</p>

<p>For the last thing that the men of Porcupine City had seen was that
cold, quiet smile of Jan Larose, the gleam of his teeth, the something
in his eyes that is more to be feared among men than bluster and brute
strength. They laid it to confidence. None guessed that this race held
for Jan no thought of the gold at the end. None guessed that he was
following out the working of a code as old as the name of his race in
the north.</p>

<p>As the canoes entered the lake the smile left Jan's face. His lips
tightened until they were almost a straight line. His eyes grew darker,
his breath came more quickly. For a little while O'Grady's canoe drew
steadily ahead of them, and when Jackpine's strokes went deeper and
more powerful Jan spoke to him in Cree, and guided the canoe so that it
cut straight as an arrow in O'Grady's wake. There was an advantage in
that. It was small, but Jan counted on the cumulative results of good
generalship.</p>

<p>His eyes never for an instant left O'Grady's huge, naked back.
Between his knees lay his .303 rifle. He had figured on the fraction of
time it would take him to drop his paddle, pick up the gun, and fire.
This was his second point in generalship&mdash;getting the drop on
O'Grady.</p>

<p>Once or twice in the first half hour O'Grady glanced back over his
shoulder, and it was Jan who now laughed tauntingly at the other. There
was something in that laugh that sent a chill through O'Grady. It was
as hard as steel, a sort of madman's laugh.</p>

<p>It was seven miles to the first portage, and there were nine in the
eighty-mile stretch. O'Grady and his Chippewayan were a hundred yards
ahead when the prow of their canoe touched shore. They were a hundred
and fifty ahead when both canoes were once more in the water on the
other side of the portage, and O'Grady sent back a hoarse shout of
triumph. Jan hunched himself a little lower. He spoke to
Jackpine&mdash;and the race began. Swifter and swifter the canoes cut
through the water. From five miles an hour to six, from six to six and
a half&mdash;seven&mdash;seven and a quarter, and then the strain told.
A paddle snapped in O'Grady's hands with a sound like a pistol shot. A
dozen seconds were lost while he snatched up a new paddle and caught
the Chippewayan's stroke, and Jan swung close into their wake again. At
the end of the fifteenth mile, where the second portage began, O'Grady
was two hundred yards in the lead. He gained another twenty on the
portage and with a breath that was coming now in sobbing swiftness Jan
put every ounce of strength behind the thrust of his paddle. Slowly
they gained. Foot by foot, yard by yard, until for a third time they
cut into O'Grady's wake. A dull pain crept into Jan's back. He felt it
slowly creeping into his shoulders and to his arms. He looked at
Jackpine and saw that he was swinging his body more and more with the
motion of his arms. And then he saw that the terrific pace set by
O'Grady was beginning to tell on the occupants of the canoe ahead. The
speed grew less and less, until it was no more than seventy yards. In
spite of the pains that were eating at his strength like swimmer's
cramp, Jan could not restrain a low cry of exultation. O'Grady had
planned to beat him out in that first twenty-mile spurt. And he had
failed! His heart leaped with new hope even while his strokes were
growing weaker.</p>

<p>Ahead of them, at the far end of the lake, there loomed up the black
spruce timber which marked the beginning of the third portage, thirty
miles from Porcupine City. Jan knew that he would win there&mdash;that
he would gain an eighth of a mile in the half-mile carry. He knew of a
shorter cut than that of the regular trail. He had cleared it himself,
for he had spent a whole winter on that portage trapping lynx.</p>

<p>Marie lived only twelve miles beyond. More than once Marie had gone
with him over the old trap line. She had helped him to plan the little
log cabin he had built for himself on the edge of the big swamp, hidden
away from all but themselves. It was she who had put the red paper
curtains over the windows, and who, one day, had written on the corner
of one of them: "My beloved Jan." He forgot O'Grady as he thought of
Marie and those old days of happiness and hope. It was Jackpine who
recalled him at last to what was happening. In amazement he saw that
O'Grady and his Chippewayan had ceased paddling. They passed a dozen
yards abreast of them. O'Grady's great arms and shoulders were
glistening with perspiration. His face was purplish. In his eyes and on
his lips was the old taunting sneer. He was panting like a wind-broken
animal. As Jan passed he uttered no word.</p>

<p>An eighth of a mile ahead was the point where the regular portage
began, but Jan swung around this into a shallow inlet from which his
own secret trail was cut. Not until he was ashore did he look back.
O'Grady and his Indian were paddling in a leisurely manner toward the
head of the point. For a moment it looked as though they had given up
the race, and Jan's heart leaped exultantly. O'Grady saw him and waved
his hand. Then he jumped out to his knees in the water and the
Chippewayan followed him. He shouted to Jan, and pointed down at the
canoe. The next instant, with a powerful shove, he sent the empty
birchbark speeding far out into the open water.</p>

<p>Jan caught his breath. He heard Jackpine's cry of amazement behind
him. Then he saw the two men start on a swift run over the portage
trail, and with a fierce, terrible cry he sprang toward his rifle,
which he had leaned against a tree.</p>

<p>In that moment he would have fired, but O'Grady and the Indian had
disappeared into the timber. He understood&mdash;O'Grady had tricked
him, as he had tricked him in other ways. He had a second canoe waiting
for him at the end of the portage, and perhaps others farther on. It
was unfair. He could still hear O'Grady's taunting laughter as it had
rung out in Porcupine City, and the mystery of it was solved. His blood
grew hot&mdash;so hot that his eyes burned, and his breath seemed to
parch his lips. In that short space in which he stood paralyzed and
unable to act his brain blazed like a volcano. Who&mdash;was helping
O'Grady by having a canoe ready for him at the other side of the
portage? He knew that no man had gone North from Porcupine City during
those tense days of waiting. The code which all understood had
prohibited that. Who, then, could it be?&mdash;who but Marie herself!
In some way O'Grady had got word to her, and it was the Cummins' canoe
that was waiting for him!</p>

<p>With a strange cry Jan lifted the bow of the canoe to his shoulder
and led Jackpine in a run. His strength had returned. He did not feel
the whiplike sting of boughs that struck him across the face. He
scarcely looked at the little cabin of logs when they passed it. Deep
down in his heart he called upon the Virgin to curse those
two&mdash;Marie Cummins and Clarry O'Grady, the man and the girl who
had cheated him out of love, out of home, out of everything he had
possessed, and who were beating him now through perfidy and
trickery.</p>

<p>His face and his hands were scratched and bleeding when they came to
the narrow waterway, half lake and half river, which let into the Blind
Loon. Another minute and they were racing again through the water. From
the mouth of the channel he saw O'Grady and the Chippewayan a quarter
of a mile ahead. Five miles beyond them was the fourth portage. It was
hidden now by a thick pall of smoke rising slowly into the clear sky.
Neither Jan nor the Indian had caught the pungent odors of burning
forests in the air, and they knew that it was a fresh fire. Never in
the years that Jan could remember had that portage been afire, and he
wondered if this was another trick of O'Grady's. The fire spread
rapidly as they advanced. It burst forth in a dozen places along the
shore of the lake, sending up huge volumes of black smoke riven by
lurid tongues of flame. O'Grady and his canoe became less and less
distinct. Finally they disappeared entirely in the lowering clouds of
the conflagration. Jan's eyes searched the water as they approached
shore, and at last he saw what he had expected to find&mdash;O'Grady's
empty canoe drifting slowly away from the beach. O'Grady and the
Chippewayan were gone.</p>

<p>Over that half-mile portage Jan staggered with his eyes half closed
and his breath coming in gasps. The smoke blinded him, and at times the
heat of the fire scorched his face. In several places it had crossed
the trail, and the hot embers burned through their moccasins. Once
Jackpine uttered a cry of pain. But Jan's lips were set. Then, above
the roar of the flames sweeping down upon the right of them, he caught
the low thunder of Dead Man's Whirlpool and the cataract that had made
the portage necessary. From the heated earth their feet came to a
narrow ledge of rock, worn smooth by the furred and moccasined tread of
centuries, with the chasm on one side of them and a wall of rock on the
other. Along the crest of that wall, a hundred feet above them, the
fire swept in a tornado of flame and smoke. A tree crashed behind them,
a dozen seconds too late. Then the trail widened and sloped down into
the dip that ended the portage. For an instant Jan paused to get his
bearing, and behind him Jackpine shouted a warning.</p>

<p>Up out of the smoldering oven where O'Grady should have found his
canoe two men were rushing toward them. They were O'Grady and the
Chippewayan. He caught the gleam of a knife in the Indian's hand. In
O'Grady's there was something larger and darker&mdash;a club, and Jan
dropped his end of the canoe with a glad cry, and drew one of the
knives from his belt. Jackpine came to his side, with his hunting knife
in his hand, measuring with glittering eyes the oncoming foe of his
race&mdash;the Chippewayan.</p>

<p>And Jan laughed softly to himself, and his teeth gleamed again, for
at last fate was playing his game. The fire had burned O'Grady's canoe,
and it was to rob him of his own canoe that O'Grady was coming to
fight. A canoe! He laughed again, while the fire roared over his head
and the whirlpool thundered at his feet. O'Grady would fight for a
canoe&mdash;for gold&mdash;while he&mdash;HE&mdash;would fight for
something else, for the vengeance of a man whose soul and honor had
been sold. He cared nothing for the canoe. He cared nothing for the
gold. He told himself, in this one tense moment of waiting, that he
cared no longer for Marie. It was the fulfillment of the code.</p>

<p>He was still smiling when O'Grady was so near that he could see the
red glare in his eyes. There was no word, no shout, no sound of fury or
defiance as the two men stood for an instant just out of striking
distance. Jan heard the coming together of Jackpine and the
Chippewayan. He heard them straggling, but not the flicker of an
eyelash did his gaze leave O'Grady's face. Both men understood. This
time had to come. Both had expected it, even from that day of the fight
in the woods when fortune had favored Jan. The burned canoe had only
hastened the hour a little. Suddenly Jan's free hand reached behind him
to his belt. He drew forth the second knife and tossed it at O'Grady's
feet.</p>

<p>O'Grady made a movement to pick it up, and then, while Jan was
partly off his guard, came at him with a powerful swing of the club. It
was his catlike quickness, the quickness almost of the great northern
loon that evades a rifle ball, that had won for Jan in the forest
fight. It saved him now. The club cut through the air over his head,
and, carried by the momentum of his own blow, O'Grady lurched against
him with the full force of his two hundred pounds of muscle and bone.
Jan's knife swept in an upward flash and plunged to the hilt through
the flesh of his enemy's forearm. With a cry of pain O'Grady dropped
his club, and the two crashed to the stone floor of the trail. This was
the attack that Jan had feared and tried to foil, and with a
lightning-like squirming movement he swung himself half free, and on
his back, with O'Grady's huge hands linking at his throat, he drew back
his knife arm for the fatal plunge.</p>

<p>In this instant, so quick that he could scarcely have taken a breath
in the time, his eyes took in the other struggle between Jackpine and
the Chippewayan. The two Indians had locked themselves in a deadly
embrace. All thought of masters, of life or death, were forgotten in
the roused-up hatred that fired them now in their desire to kill. They
had drawn close to the edge of the chasm. Under them the thundering
roar of the whirlpool was unheard, their ears caught no sound of the
moaning surge of the flames far over their heads. Even as Jan stared
horror-stricken in that one moment, they locked at the edge of the
chasm. Above the tumult of the flood below and the fire above there
rose a wild yell, and the two plunged down into the abyss, locked and
fighting even as they fell in a twisting, formless shape to the death
below.</p>

<p>It happened in an instant&mdash;like the flash of a quick picture on
a screen&mdash;and even as Jan caught the last of Jackpine's terrible
face, his hand drove eight inches of steel toward O'Grady's body. The
blade struck something hard&mdash;something that was neither bone nor
flesh, and he drew back again to strike. He had struck the steel buckle
on O'Grady's belt. This time&mdash;</p>

<p>A sudden hissing roar filled the air. Jan knew that he did not
strike&mdash;but he scarcely knew more than that in the first shock of
the fiery avalanche that had dropped upon them from the rock wall of
the mountain. He was conscious of fighting desperately to drag himself
from under a weight that was not O'Grady's&mdash;a weight that stifled
the breath in his lungs, that crackled in his ears, that scorched his
face and his hands, and was burning out his eyes. A shriek rang in his
ears unlike any other cry of man he had ever heard, and he knew that it
was O'Grady's. He pulled himself out, foot by foot, until fresher air
struck his nostrils, and dragged himself nearer and nearer to the edge
of the chasm. He could not rise. His limbs were paralyzed. His knife
arm dragged at his side. He opened his eyes and found that he could
see. Where they had fought was the smoldering ruin of a great tree, and
standing out of the ruin of that tree, half naked, his hands tearing
wildly at his face, was O'Grady. Jan's fingers clutched at a small
rock. He called out, but there was no meaning to the sound he made.
Clarry O'Grady threw out his great arms.</p>

<p>"Jan&mdash;Jan Larose&mdash;" he cried. "My God, don't strike now!
I'm blind&mdash;blind&mdash;"</p>

<p>He staggered back, as if expecting a blow. "Don't strike!" he almost
shrieked. "Mother of Heaven&mdash;my eyes are burned out&mdash;I'm
blind&mdash;blind&mdash;"</p>

<p>He backed to the wall, his huge form crouched, his hands reaching
out as if to ward off the deathblow. Jan tried to move, and the effort
brought a groan of agony to his lips. A second crash filled his ears as
a second avalanche of fiery debris plunged down upon the trail farther
back. He stared straight up through the stifling smoke. Lurid tongues
of flame were leaping over the wall of the mountain where the edge of
the forest was enveloped in a sea of twisting and seething fire. It was
only a matter of minutes&mdash;perhaps seconds. Death had them both in
its grip.</p>

<p>He looked again at O'Grady, and there was no longer the desire for
the other's life in his heart. He could see that the giant was
unharmed, except for his eyes.</p>

<p>"Listen, O'Grady," he cried. "My legs are broken, I guess, and I
can't move. It's sure death to stay here another minute. You can get
away. Follow the wall&mdash;to your right. The slope is still free of
fire, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>O'Grady began to move, guiding himself slowly along the wall. Then,
suddenly, he stopped.</p>

<p>"Jan Larose&mdash;you say you can't move?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Slowly O'Grady turned and came gropingly toward the sound of Jan's
voice. Jan held tight to the rock that he had gripped in his left hand.
Was it possible that O'Grady would kill him now, stricken as he was? He
tried to drag himself to a new position, but his effort was futile.</p>

<p>"Jan! Jan Larose!" called O'Grady, stopping to listen.</p>

<p>Jan held his breath. Then the truth seemed to dawn upon O'Grady. He
laughed, differently than he had laughed before, and stretched out his
arms.</p>

<p>"My God, Jan," he cried, "you don't think I'm clean BEAST, do you?
The fight's over, man, an' I guess God A'mighty brought this on us to
show what fools we was. Where are y', Jan Larose? I'm goin' t' carry
you out!"</p>

<p>"I'm here!" called Jan.</p>

<p>He could see truth and fearlessness in O'Grady's sightless face, and
he guided him without fear. Their hands met. Then O'Grady lowered
himself and hoisted Jan to his shoulders as easily as he would have
lifted a boy. He straightened himself and drew a deep breath, broken by
a stabbing throb of pain.</p>

<p>"I'm blind an' I won't see any more," he said, "an' mebbe you won't
ever walk any more. But if we ever git to that gold I kin do the work
and you kin show me how. Now&mdash;p'int out the way, Jan Larose!"</p>

<p>With his arms clasped about O'Grady's naked shoulders, Jan's
smarting eyes searched through the thickening smother of fire and smoke
for a road that the other's feet might tread. He shouted
"Left"&mdash;"right"&mdash;"right"&mdash;"right"&mdash;"left" into this
blind companion's ears until they touched the wall. As the heat smote
them more fiercely, O'Grady bowed his great head upon his chest and
obeyed mutely the signals that rang in his ears. The bottoms of his
moccasins were burned from his feet, live embers ate at his flesh, his
broad chest was a fiery blister, and yet he strode on straight into the
face of still greater heat and greater torture, uttering no sound that
could be heard above the steady roar of the flames. And Jan, limp and
helpless on his back, felt then the throb and pulse of a giant life
under him, the straining of thick neck, of massive shoulders and the
grip of powerful arms whose strength told him that at last he had found
the comrade and the man in Clarry O'Grady.
"Right"&mdash;"left"&mdash;"left"&mdash;"right" he shouted, and then he
called for O'Grady to stop in a voice that was shrill with warning.</p>

<p>"There's fire ahead," he yelled. "We can't follow the wall any
longer. There's an open space close to the chasm. We can make that, but
there's only about a yard to spare. Take short steps&mdash;one step
each time I tell you.
Now&mdash;left&mdash;left&mdash;left&mdash;left&mdash;"</p>

<p>Like a soldier on drill, O'Grady kept time with his scorched feet
until Jan turned him again to face the storm of fire, while one of his
own broken legs dangled over the abyss into which Jackpine and the
Chippewayan had plunged to their death. Behind them, almost where they
had fought, there crashed down a third avalanche from the edge of the
mountain. Not a shiver ran through O'Grady's great body. Steadily and
unflinchingly&mdash;step&mdash;step&mdash;step&mdash;he went ahead,
while the last threads of his moccasins smoked and burned. Jan could no
longer see half a dozen yards in advance. A wall of black smoke rose in
their faces, and he pulled O'Grady's ear:</p>

<p>"We've got just one chance, Clarry. I can't see any more. Keep
straight ahead&mdash;and run for it, and may the good God help us
now!"</p>

<p>And Clarry O'Grady, drawing one great breath that was half fire into
his lungs, ran straight into the face of what looked like death to Jan
Larose. In that one moment Jan closed his eyes and waited for the
plunge over the cliff. But in place of death a sweep of air that seemed
almost cold struck his face, and he opened his eyes to find the clear
and uncharred slope leading before them down to the edge of the lake.
He shouted the news into O'Grady's ear, and then there arose from
O'Grady's chest a great sobbing cry, partly of joy, partly of pain, and
more than all else of that terrible grief which came of the knowledge
that back in the pit of death from which he had escaped he had left
forever the vision of life itself. He dropped Jan in the edge of the
water, and, plunging in to his waist, he threw handful after handful of
water into his own swollen face, and then stared upward, as though this
last experiment was also his last hope.</p>

<p>"My God, I'm blind&mdash;stone blind!"</p>

<p>Jan was staring hard into O'Grady's face. He called him nearer, took
the swollen and blackened face between his two hands, and his voice was
trembling with joy when he spoke.</p>

<p>"You're not blind&mdash;not for good&mdash;O'Grady," he said. "I've
seen men like you before&mdash;twice. You&mdash;you'll get well.
O'Grady&mdash;Clarry O'Grady&mdash;let's shake! I'm a brother to you
from this day on. And I'm glad&mdash;glad&mdash;that Marie loves a man
like you!"</p>

<p>O'Grady had gripped his hand, but he dropped it now as though it had
been one of the live brands that had hurtled down upon them from the
top of the mountain.</p>

<p>"Marie&mdash;man&mdash;why&mdash;she HATES me!" he cried. "It's
you&mdash;YOU&mdash;Jan Larose, that she loves! I went there with a
broken leg, an' I fell in love with her. But she wouldn't so much as
let me touch her hand, an' she talked of
you&mdash;always&mdash;always&mdash;until I had learned to hate you
before you came. I dunno why she did it&mdash;that other
thing&mdash;unless it was to make you jealous. I guess it was all f'r
fun, Jan. She didn't know. The day you went away she sent me after you.
But I hated you&mdash;hated you worse'n she hated me. It's
you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He clutched his hands at his sightless face again, and suddenly Jan
gave a wild shout. Creeping around the edge of a smoking headland, he
had caught sight of a man and a canoe.</p>

<p>"There's a man in a canoe!" he cried, "He sees us!
O'Grady&mdash;"</p>

<p>He tried to lift himself, but fell back with a groan. Then he
laughed, and, in spite of his agony, there was a quivering happiness in
his voice.</p>

<p>"He's coming, O'Grady. And it looks&mdash;it looks like a canoe we
both know. We'll go back to her cabin together, O'Grady. And when we're
on our legs again&mdash;well, I never wanted the gold. That's
yours&mdash;all of it."</p>

<p>A determined look had settled in O'Grady's face. He groped his way
to Jan's side, and their hands met in a clasp that told more than
either could have expressed of the brotherhood and strength of men.</p>

<p>"You can't throw me off like that, Jan Larose," he said. "We're
pardners!"</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_9">THE MATCH</a></h3>

<p>Sergeant Brokaw was hatchet-faced, with shifting pale blue eyes that
had a glint of cruelty in them. He was tall, and thin, and lithe as a
cat. He belonged to the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, and was one of
the best men on the trail that had ever gone into the North. His
business was man hunting. Ten years of seeking after human prey had
given to him many of the characteristics of a fox. For six of those ten
years he had represented law north of fifty-three. Now he had come to
the end of his last hunt, close up to the Arctic Circle. For one
hundred and eighty-seven days he had been following a man. The hunt had
begun in midsummer, and it was now midwinter. Billy Loring, who was
wanted for murder, had been a hard man to find. But he was caught at
last, and Brokaw was keenly exultant. It was his greatest achievement.
It would mean a great deal for him down at headquarters.</p>

<p>In the rough and dimly lighted cabin his man sat opposite him, on a
bench, his manacled hands crossed over his knees. He was a younger man
than Brokaw&mdash;thirty, or a little better. His hair was long,
reddish, and untrimmed. A stubble of reddish beard covered his face.
His eyes, too, were blue&mdash;of the deep, honest blue that one
remembers, and most frequently trusts. He did not look like a criminal.
There was something almost boyish in his face, a little hollowed by
long privation. He was the sort of man that other men liked. Even
Brokaw, who had a heart like flint in the face of crime, had melted a
little.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" he shivered. "Listen to that beastly wind! It means three
days of storm." Outside a gale was blowing straight down from the
Arctic. They could hear the steady moaning of it in the spruce tops
over the cabin, and now and then there came one of those raging blasts
that filled the night with strange shrieking sounds. Volleys of fine,
hard snow beat against the one window with a rattle like shot. In the
cabin it was comfortable. It was Billy's cabin. He had built it deep in
a swamp, where there were lynx and fisher cat to trap, and where he had
thought that no one could find him. The sheet-iron stove was glowing
hot. An oil lamp hung from the ceiling. Billy was sitting so that the
glow of this fell in his face. It scintillated on the rings of steel
about his wrists. Brokaw was a cautious man, as well as a clever one,
and he took no chances.</p>

<p>"I like storms&mdash;when you're inside, an' close to a stove,"
replied Billy. "Makes me feel sort of&mdash;safe." He smiled a little
grimly. Even at that it was not an unpleasant smile.</p>

<p>Brokaw's snow-reddened eyes gazed at the other.</p>

<p>"There's something in that," he said. "This storm will give you at
least three days more of life."</p>

<p>"Won't you drop that?" asked the prisoner, turning his face a
little, so that it was shaded from the light.</p>

<p>"You've got me now, an' I know what's coming as well as you do." His
voice was low and quiet, with the faintest trace of a broken note in
it, deep down in his throat. "We're alone, old man, and a long way from
anyone. I ain't blaming you for catching me. I haven't got anything
against you. So let's drop this other thing&mdash;what I'm going down
to&mdash;and talk something pleasant. I know I'm going to hang. That's
the law. It'll be pleasant enough when it comes, don't you think? Let's
talk about&mdash;about&mdash;home. Got any kids?"</p>

<p>Brokaw shook his head, and took his pipe from his mouth.</p>

<p>"Never married," he said shortly.</p>

<p>"Never married," mused Billy, regarding him with a curious softening
of his blue eyes. "You don't know what you've missed, Brokaw. Of
course, it's none of my business, but you've got a
home&mdash;somewhere&mdash;" Brokaw shook his head again.</p>

<p>"Been in the service ten years," he said. "I've got a mother living
with my brother somewhere down in York State. I've sort of lost track
of them. Haven't seen 'em in five years."</p>

<p>Billy was looking at him steadily. Slowly he rose to his feet,
lifted his manacled hands, and turned down the light.</p>

<p>"Hurts my eyes," he said, and he laughed frankly as he caught the
suspicious glint in Brokaw's eyes. He seated himself again, and leaned
over toward the other. "I haven't talked to a white man for three
months," he added, a little hesitatingly. "I've been
hiding&mdash;close. I had a dog for a time, and he died, an' I didn't
dare go hunting for another. I knew you fellows were pretty close after
me. But I wanted to get enough fur to take me to South America. Had it
all planned, an' SHE was going to join me there&mdash;with the kid.
Understand? If you'd kept away another month&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a husky break in his voice, and he coughed to clear
it.</p>

<p>"You don't mind if I talk, do you&mdash;about her, an' the kid? I've
got to do it, or bust, or go mad. I've got to
because&mdash;to-day&mdash;she was twenty-four&mdash;at ten o'clock in
the morning&mdash;an' it's our wedding day&mdash;"</p>

<p>The half gloom hid from Brokaw what was in the other's face. And
then Billy laughed almost joyously. "Say, but she's been a true little
pardner," he whispered proudly, as there came a lull in the storm. "She
was just born for me, an' everything seemed to happen on her birthday,
an' that's why I can't be downhearted even NOW. It's her birthday? you
see, an' this morning, before you came, I was just that happy that I
set a plate for her at the table, an' put her picture and a curl of her
hair beside it&mdash;set the picture up so it was looking at
me&mdash;an' we had breakfast together. Look here&mdash;"</p>

<p>He moved to the table, with Brokaw watching him like a cat, and
brought something back with him, wrapped in a soft piece of buckskin.
He unfolded the buckskin tenderly, and drew forth a long curl that
rippled a dull red and gold in the lamp-glow, and then he handed a
photograph to Brokaw.</p>

<p>"That's her!" he whispered.</p>

<p>Brokaw turned so that the light fell on the picture. A sweet,
girlish face smiled at him from out of a wealth of flowing, disheveled
curls.</p>

<p>"She had it taken that way just for me," explained Billy, with the
enthusiasm of a boy in his voice. "She's always wore her hair in
curls&mdash;an' a braid&mdash;for me, when we're home. I love it that
way. Guess I may be silly but I'll tell you why. THAT was down in York
State, too. She lived in a cottage, all grown over with honeysuckle an'
morning glory, with green hills and valleys all about it&mdash;and the
old apple orchard just behind. That day we were in the orchard, all red
an' white with bloom, and she dared me to a race. I let her beat me,
and when I came up she stood under one of the trees, her cheeks like
the pink blossoms, and her hair all tumbled about her like an armful of
gold, shaking the loose apple blossoms down on her head. I forgot
everything then, and I didn't stop until I had her in my arms,
an'&mdash;an' she's been my little pardner ever since. After the baby
came we moved up into Canada, where I had a good chance in a new mining
town. An' then&mdash;" A furious blast of the storm sent the
overhanging spruce tops smashing against the top of the cabin. Straight
overhead the wind shrieked almost like human voices, and the one window
rattled as though it were shaken by human hands. The lamp had been
burning lower and lower. It began to flicker now, the quick sputter of
the wick lost in the noise of the gale. Then it went out. Brokaw leaned
over and opened the door of the big box stove, and the red glow of the
fire took the place of the lamplight. He leaned back and relighted his
pipe, eyeing Billy. The sudden blast, the going out of the light, the
opening of the stove door, had all happened in a minute, but the
interval was long enough to bring a change in Billy's voice. It was
cold and hard when he continued. He leaned over toward Brokaw, and the
boyishness had gone from his face.</p>

<p>"Of course, I can't expect you to have any sympathy for this other
business, Brokaw," he went on. "Sympathy isn't in your line, an' you
wouldn't be the big man you are in the service if you had it. But I'd
like to know what YOU would have done. We were up there six months, and
we'd both grown to love the big woods, and she was growing prettier and
happier every day&mdash;when Thorne, the new superintendent, came up.
One day she told me that she didn't like Thorne, but I didn't pay much
attention to that, and laughed at her, and said he was a good fellow.
After that I could see that something was worrying her, and pretty soon
I couldn't help from seeing what it was, and everything came out. It
was Thorne. He was persecuting her. She hadn't told me, because she
knew it would make trouble and I'd lose my job. One afternoon I came
home earlier than usual, and found her crying. She put her arms round
my neck, and just cried it all out, with her face snuggled in my neck,
and kissin' me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Brokaw could see the cords in Billy's neck. His manacled hands were
clenched.</p>

<p>"What would you have done, Brokaw?" he asked huskily. "What if you
had a wife, an' she told you that another man had insulted her, and was
forcing his attentions on her, and she asked you to give up your job
and take her away? Would you have done it, Brokaw? No, you wouldn't.
You'd have hunted up the man. That's what I did. He had been
drinking&mdash;just enough to make him devilish, and he laughed at
me&mdash;I didn't mean to strike so hard.&mdash;But it happened. I
killed him. I got away. She and the baby are down in the little cottage
again&mdash;down in York State&mdash;an' I know she's awake this
minute&mdash;our wedding day&mdash;thinking of me, an' praying for me,
and counting the days between now and spring. We were going to South
America then."</p>

<p>Brokaw rose to his feet, and put fresh wood into the stove.</p>

<p>"I guess it must be pretty hard," he said, straightening himself.
"But the law up here doesn't take them things into account&mdash;not
very much. It may let you off with manslaugher&mdash;ten or fifteen
years. I hope it does. Let's turn in."</p>

<p>Billy stood up beside him. He went with Brokaw to a bunk built
against the wall, and the sergeant drew a fine steel chain from his
pocket. Billy lay down, his hands crossed over his breast, and Brokaw
deftly fastened the chain about his ankles.</p>

<p>"And I suppose you think THIS is hard, too," he added. "But I guess
you'd do it if you were me. Ten years of this sort of work learns you
not to take chances. If you want anything in the night just whistle."
It had been a hard day with Brokaw, and he slept soundly. For an hour
Billy lay awake, thinking of home, and listening to the wail of the
storm. Then he, too, fell into sleep&mdash;a restless, uneasy slumber
filled with troubled visions. For a time there had come a lull in the
storm, but now it broke over the cabin with increased fury. A hand
seemed slapping at the window, threatening to break it. The spruce
boughs moaned and twisted overhead, and a volley of wind and snow shot
suddenly down the chimney, forcing open the stove door, so that a shaft
of ruddy light cut like a red knife through the dense gloom of the
cabin. In varying ways the sounds played a part in Billy's dreams. In
all those dreams, and segments of dreams, the girl&mdash;his
wife&mdash;was present. Once they had gone for wild flowers and had
been caught in a thunderstorm, and had run to an old and disused barn
in the middle of a field for shelter. He was back in that barn again,
with HER&mdash;and he could feel her trembling against him, and he was
stroking her hair, as the thunder crashed over them and the lightning
filled her eyes with fear. After that there came to him a vision of the
early autumn nights when they had gone corn roasting, with other young
people. He had always been afflicted with a slight nasal trouble, and
smoke irritated him. It set him sneezing, and kept him dodging about
the fire, and she had always laughed when the smoke persisted in
following him about, like a young scamp of a boy bent on tormenting
him. The smoke was unusually persistent to-night. He tossed in his
bunk, and buried his face in the blanket that answered for a pillow.
The smoke reached him even there, and he sneezed chokingly. In that
instant the girl's face disappeared. He sneezed again&mdash;and
awoke.</p>

<p>A startled gasp broke from his lips, and the handcuffs about his
wrists clanked as he raised his hands to his face. In that moment his
dazed senses adjusted themselves. The cabin was full of smoke. It
partly blinded him, but through it he could see tongues of fire
shooting toward the ceiling. He could hear the crackling of burning
pitch, and he yelled wildly to Brokaw. In an instant the sergeant was
on his feet. He rushed to the table, where he had placed a pail of
water the evening before, and Billy heard the hissing of the water as
it struck the flaming wall.</p>

<p>"Never mind that," he shouted. "The shack's built of pitch cedar.
We've got to get out!" Brokaw groped his way to him through the smoke
and began fumbling at the chain about his ankles.</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;find&mdash;the key&mdash;" he gasped chokingly. "Here
grab hold of me!"</p>

<p>He caught Billy under the arms and dragged him to the door. As he
opened it the wind came in with a rush and behind them the whole cabin
burst into a furnace of flame. Twenty yards from the cabin he dropped
Billy in the snow, and ran back. In that seething room of smoke and
fire was everything on which their lives depended, food, blankets, even
their coats and caps and snowshoes. But he could go no farther than the
door. He returned to Billy, found the key in his pocket, and freed him
from the chain about his ankles. Billy stood up. As he looked at Brokaw
the glass in the window broke and a sea of flame sprouted through. It
lighted up their faces. The sergeant's jaw was set hard. His leathery
face was curiously white. He could not keep from shivering. There was a
strange smile on Billy's face, and a strange look in his eyes. Neither
of the two men had undressed for sleep, but their coats, and caps, and
heavy mittens were in the flames.</p>

<p>Billy rattled his handcuffs. Brokaw looked him squarely in the
eyes.</p>

<p>"You ought to know this country," he said. "What'll we do?"</p>

<p>"The nearest post is sixty miles from here," said Billy.</p>

<p>"I know that," replied Brokaw. "And I know that Thoreau's cabin is
only twenty miles from here. There must be some trapper or Indian shack
nearer than that. Is there?" In the red glare of the fire Billy smiled.
His teeth gleamed at Brokaw. It was a lull of the wind, and he went
close to Brokaw, and spoke quietly, his eyes shining more and more with
that strange light that had come into them.</p>

<p>"This is going to be a big sight easier than hanging, or going to
jail for half my life, Brokaw&mdash;an' you don't think I'm going to be
fool enough to miss the chance, do you? It ain't hard to die of cold.
I've almost been there once or twice. I told you last night why I
couldn't give up hope&mdash;that something good for me always came on
her birthday, or near to it. An' it's come. It's forty below, an' we
won't live the day out. We ain't got a mouthful of grub. We ain't got
clothes enough on to keep us from freezing inside the shanty, unless we
had a fire. Last night I saw you fill your match bottle and put it in
your coat pocket. Why, man, WE AIN'T EVEN GOT A MATCH!"</p>

<p>In his voice there was a thrill of triumph. Brokaw's hands were
clenched, as if some one had threatened to strike him.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Just this," interrupted Billy, and his voice was harder than
Brokaw's now. "The God you used to pray to when you was a kid has given
me a choice, Brokaw, an' I'm going to take it. If we stay by this fire,
an' keep it up, we won't die of cold, but of starvation. We'll be dead
before we get half way to Thoreau's. There's an Indian shack that we
could make, but you'll never find it&mdash;not unless you unlock these
irons and give me that revolver at your belt. Then I'll take you over
there as my prisoner. That'll give me another chance for South
America&mdash;an' the kid an' home." Brokaw was buttoning the thick
collar of his shirt close up about his neck. On his face, too, there
came for a moment a grim and determined smile.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said, "we'll make Thoreau's or die."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Billy, stepping quickly to his side. "I suppose I might
lie down in the snow, an' refuse to budge. I'd win my game then,
wouldn't I? But we'll play it&mdash;on the square. It's Thoreau's, or
die. And it's up to you to find Thoreau's."</p>

<p>He looked back over his shoulder at the burning cabin as they
entered the edge of the forest, and in the gray darkness that was
preceding dawn he smiled to himself. Two miles to the south, in a thick
swamp, was Indian Joe's cabin. They could have made it easily. On their
way to Thoreau's they would pass within a mile of it. But Brokaw would
never know. And they would never reach Thoreau's. Billy knew that. He
looked at the man hunter as he broke trail ahead of him&mdash;at the
pugnacious hunch of his shoulders, his long stride, the determined
clench of his hands, and wondered what the soul and the heart of a man
like this must be, who in such an hour would not trade life for life.
For almost three-quarters of an hour Brokaw did not utter a word. The
storm had broke. Above the spruce tops the sky began to clear. Day came
slowly. And it was growing steadily colder. The swing of Brokaw'a arms
and shoulders kept the blood in them circulating, while Billy's
manacled wrists held a part of his body almost rigid. He knew that his
hands were already frozen. His arms were numb, and when at last Brokaw
paused for a moment on the edge of a frozen stream Billy thrust out his
hands, and clanked the steel rings.</p>

<p>"It must be getting colder," he said. "Look at that."</p>

<p>The cold steel had seared his wrists like hot iron, and had pulled
off patches of skin and flesh. Brokaw looked, and hunched his
shoulders. His lips were blue. His cheeks, ears, and nose were
frost-bitten. There was a curious thickness in his voice when he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Thoreau lives on this creek," he said. "How much farther is
it?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen or sixteen miles," replied Billy. "You'll last just about
five, Brokaw. I won't last that long unless you take these things off
and give me the use of my arms."</p>

<p>"To knock out my brains when I ain't looking," growled Brokaw. "I
guess&mdash;before long&mdash;you'll be willing to tell where the
Indian's shack is." He kicked his way through a drift of snow to the
smoother surface of the stream. There was a breath of wind in their
faces, and Billy bowed his head to it. In the hours of his greatest
loneliness and despair Billy had kept up his fighting spirit by
thinking of pleasant things, and now, as he followed in Brokaw's trail,
he began to think of home. It was not hard for him to bring up visions
of the girl wife who would probably never know how he had died. He
forgot Brokaw. He followed in the trail mechanically, failing to notice
that his captor's pace was growing steadily slower, and that his own
feet were dragging more and more like leaden weights. He was back among
the old hills again, and the sun was shining, and he heard laughter and
song. He saw Jeanne standing at the gate in front of the little white
cottage, smiling at him, and waving Baby Jeanne's tiny hand at him as
he looked back over his shoulder from down the dusty road. His mind did
not often travel as far as the mining camp, and he had completely
forgotten it now. He no longer felt the sting and pain of the intense
cold. It was Brokaw who brought him back into the reality of things.
The sergeant stumbled and fell in a drift, and Billy fell over him. For
a moment the two men sat half buried in the snow, looking at each other
without speaking. Brokaw moved first. He rose to his feet with an
effort. Billy made an attempt to follow him. After three efforts he
gave it up, and blinked up into Brokaw's face with a queer laugh. The
laugh was almost soundless. There had come a change in Brokaw's face.
Its determination and confidence were gone. At last the iron mask of
the Law was broken, and there shone through it something of the
emotions and the brotherhood of man. He was fumbling in one of his
pockets, and drew out the key to the handcuffs. It was a small key, and
he held it between his stiffened fingers with diffic ulty. He knelt
down beside Billy. The keyhole was filled with snow. It took a long
time&mdash;ten minutes&mdash;before the key was fitted in and the lock
clicked. He helped to tear off the cuffs. Billy felt no sensation as
bits of skin and flesh came "with them. Brokaw gave him a hand, and
assisted him to rise. For the first time he spoke.</p>

<p>"Guess you've got me beat, Billy," he said.</p>

<p>"Where's the Indian's?"</p>

<p>He drew his revolver from its holster and tossed it in the
snowdrift. The shadow of a smile passed grimly over his face. Billy
looked about him. They had stopped where the frozen path of a smaller
stream joined the creek. He raised one of his stiffened arms and
pointed to it.</p>

<p>"Follow that creek&mdash;four miles&mdash;and you'll come to Indian
Joe's shack," he said.</p>

<p>"And a mile is just about our limit"</p>

<p>"Just about&mdash;your's," replied Billy. "I can't make another
half. If we had a fire&mdash;"</p>

<p>"IF&mdash;" wheezed Brokaw.</p>

<p>"If we had a fire," continued Billy. "We could warm ourselves, an'
make the Indian's shack easy, couldn't we?"</p>

<p>Brokaw did not answer. He had turned toward the creek when one of
Billy's pulseless hands fell heavily on his arm.</p>

<p>"Look here, Brokaw."</p>

<p>Brokaw turned. They looked into each other's eyes.</p>

<p>"I guess mebby you're a man, Brokaw," said Billy quietly. "You've
done what you thought was your duty. You've kept your word to th' law,
an' I believe you'll keep your word with me. If I say the word that'll
save us now will you go back to headquarters an' report me dead?" For a
full half minute their eyes did not waver.</p>

<p>Then Brokaw said:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Billy dropped his hand. It was Brokaw's hand that fell on his arm
now.</p>

<p>"I can't do that," he said. "In ten years I ain't run out the white
flag once. It's something that ain't known in the service. There ain't
a coward in it, or a man who's afraid to die. But I'll play you square.
I'll wait until we're both on our feet, again, and then I'll give you
twenty-four hours the start of me."</p>

<p>Billy was smiling now. His hand reached out. Brokaw's met it, and
the two joined in a grip that their numb fingers scarcely felt.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Billy softly, "there's been somethin' runnin' in
my head ever since we left the burning cabin. It's something my mother
taught me: 'Do unto others as you'd have others do unto you.' I'm a
d&mdash;- fool, ain't I? But I'm goin' to try the experiment, Brokaw,
an' see what comes of it. I could drop in a snowdrift an' let you go
on&mdash;to die. Then I could save myself. But I'm going to take your
word&mdash;an' do the other thing. I'VE GOT A MATCH."</p>

<p>"A MATCH!"</p>

<p>"Just one. I remember dropping it in my pants pocket yesterday when
I was out on the trail. It's in THIS pocket. Your hand is in better
shape than mine. Get it."</p>

<p>Life had leaped into Brokaw's face. He thrust his hand into Billy's
pocket, staring at him as he fumbled, as if fearing that he had lied.
When he drew his hand out the match was between his fingers.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he whispered excitedly.</p>

<p>"Don't get nervous," warned Billy. "It's the only one."</p>

<p>Brokaw's eyes were searching the low timber along the shore.
"There's a birch tree," he cried. "Hold it&mdash;while I gather a pile
of bark!"</p>

<p>He gave the match to Billy, and staggered through the snow to the
bank. Strip after strip of the loose bark he tore from the tree. Then
he gathered it in a heap in the shelter of a low-hanging spruce, and
added dry sticks, and still more bark, to it. When it was ready he
stood with his hands in his pockets, and looked at Billy.</p>

<p>"If we had a stone, an' a piece of paper&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>Billy thrust a hand that felt like lifeless lead inside his shirt,
and fumbled in a pocket he had made there. Brokaw watched him with red,
eager eyes. The hand reappeared, and in it was the buckskin wrapped
photograph he had seen the night before, Billy took off the buckskin.
About the picture there was a bit of tissue paper. He gave this and the
match to Brokaw.</p>

<p>"There's a little gun-file in the pocket the match came from," he
said. "I had it mending a trapchain. You can scratch the match on
that."</p>

<p>He turned so that Brokaw could reach into the pocket, and the man
hunter thrust in his hand. When he brought it forth he held the file.
There was a smile on Billy's frostbitten face as he held the picture
for a moment under Brokaw's eyes. Billy's own hands had ruffled up the
girl's shining curls an instant before the picture was taken, and she
was laughing at him when the camera clicked.</p>

<p>"It's all up to her, Brokaw," Billy said gently. "I told you that
last night. It was she who woke me up before the fire got us. If you
ever prayed&mdash;pray a little now. FOR SHE'S GOING TO STRIKE THAT
MATCH!"</p>

<p>He still looked at the picture as Brokaw knelt beside the pile he
had made. He heard the scratch of the match on the file, but his eyes
did not turn. The living, breathing face of the most beautiful thing in
the world was speaking to him from out of that picture. His mind was
dazed. He swayed a little. He heard a voice, low and sweet, and so
distant that it came to him like the faintest whisper. "I am
coming&mdash;I am coming,
Billy&mdash;coming&mdash;coming&mdash;coming&mdash;" A joyous cry
surged up from his soul, but it died on his lips in a strange gasp. A
louder cry brought him back to himself for a moment. It was from
Brokaw. The sergeant's face was terrible to behold. He rose to his
feet, swaying, his hands clutched at his breast. His voice was
thick&mdash;hopeless.</p>

<p>"The match&mdash;went&mdash;out&mdash;" He staggered up to Billy,
his eyes like a madman's. Billy swayed dizzily. He laughed, even as he
crumpled down in the snow. As if in a dream he saw Brokaw stagger off
on the frozen trail. He saw him disappear in his hopeless effort to
reach the Indian's shack. And then a strange darkness closed him in,
and in that darkness he heard still the sweet voice of his wife. It
spoke his name again and again, and it urged him to wake up&mdash;wake
up&mdash;WAKE UP! It seemed a long time before he could respond to it.
But at last he opened his eyes. He dragged himself to his knees, and
looked first to find Brokaw. But the man hunter had gone&mdash;forever.
The picture was still in his hand. Less distinctly than before he saw
the girl smiling at him. And then&mdash;at his back&mdash;he heard a
strange and new sound. With an effort he turned to discover what it
was.</p>

<p>The match had hidden an unseen spark from Brokaw's eyes. From out of
the pile of fuel was rising a pillar of smoke and flame.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_10">THE HONOR OF HER PEOPLE</a></h3>

<p>"It ees not so much&mdash;What you call heem?&mdash;leegend, thees
honor of the Beeg Snows!" said Jan softly.</p>

<p>He had risen to his feet and gazed placidly over the crackling
box-stove into the eyes of the red-faced Englishman.</p>

<p>"Leegend is lie! Thees is truth!"</p>

<p>There was no lack of luster in the black eyes that roved inquiringly
from the Englishman's bantering grin to the others in the room. Mukee,
the half Cree, was sitting with his elbows on his knees gazing with
stoic countenance at this new curiosity who had wandered four hundred
miles northward from civilization. Williams, the Hudson's Bay man who
claimed to be all white, was staring hard at the red side of the stove,
and the factor's son looked silently at Jan. He and the half-breed
noted the warm glow in the eyes that rested casually upon the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"It ees truth&mdash;thees honor of the Beeg Snows!" said Jan again,
and his moccasined feet fell in heavy, thumping tread to the door.</p>

<p>That was the first time he had spoken that evening, and not even the
half Cree, or Williams, or the factor's son guessed how the blood was
racing through his veins. Outside he stood with the pale, cold glow of
the Aurora Borealis shining upon him, and the limitless wilderness,
heavy in its burden of snow, reaching out into the ghost-gray fabric of
the night. The Englishman's laugh followed him, boisterous and grossly
thick, and Jan moved on,&mdash;wondering how much longer the half Cree
and Williams and the factor's son would listen to the things that this
man was saying of the most beautiful thing that had ever come into
their lives.</p>

<p>"It ees truth, I swear, by dam'&mdash;thees honor of what he calls
the 'Beeg Snows!'" persisted Jan to himself, and he set his back to the
factor's office and trudged through the snow.</p>

<p>When he came to the black ledge of the spruce and balsam forest he
stopped and looked back. It was an hour past bedtime at the post. The
Company's store loomed up silent and lightless. The few log cabins
betrayed no signs of life. Only in the factor's office, which was the
Company's haven for the men of the wilderness, was there a waste of
kerosene, and that was because of the Englishman whom Jan was beginning
to hate. He stared back at the one glowing window with a queer
thickening in his throat and a clenching of the hands in the pockets of
his caribou-skin coat. Then he looked long and wistfully at a little
cabin which stood apart from the rest, and to himself he whispered
again what he had said to the Englishman. Until to-night&mdash;or,
perhaps, until two weeks ago&mdash;Jan had been satisfied with his
world. It was a big, passionless world, mostly of snow and ice and
endless privation, but he loved it, and there was only a fast-fading
memory of another world in his brain. It was a world of big, honest
hearts kept warm within caribou skins, of moccasined men whom endless
solitude had taught to say little and do much&mdash;a world of "Big
Snows," as the Englishman had said, in which Jan and all his people had
come very close to the things which God created. Without the steely
gray flash of those mystery-lights over the Arctic pole Jan would have
been homesick; his soul would have withered and died in anything but
this wondrous land which he knew, with its billion dazzling stars by
night and its eye-blinding brilliancy by day. For Jan, in a way, was
fortunate. He had in him an infinitesimal measure of the Cree, which
made him understand what the winds sometimes whispered in the
pine-tops; and a part of him was French, which added jet to his eyes
and a twist to his tongue and made him susceptible to the beautiful,
and the rest was "just white"&mdash;the part of him that could be
stirred into such thoughts and visions as he was now thinking and
dreaming of the Englishman.</p>

<p>The "honor of the Beeg Snows" was a part of Jan's soul; it was his
religion, and the religion of those few others who lived with him four
hundred miles from a settlement, in a place where God's name could not
be spelled or written. It meant what civilization could not understand,
and the Englishman could not understand&mdash;freezing and slow
starvation rather than theft, and the living of the tenth commandment
above all other things. It came naturally and easily, this "honor of
the Beeg Snows." It was an unwritten law which no man cared or dared to
break, and to Jan, with his Cree and his French and his "just white"
blood, it was in full measure just what the good God meant it to
be.</p>

<p>He moved now toward the little isolated cabin, half hidden in its
drift of snow, keeping well in the deep shadows of the spruce and
balsam, and when he stopped again he saw faintly a gleam of light
falling in a wan streak through a big hole in a curtained window. Each
night, always when the twenty-odd souls of the post were deep in
slumber, Jan's heart would come near to bursting with joy at the sight
of this grow from the snow-smothered cabin, for it told him that the
most beautiful thing in the world was safe and well. He heard,
suddenly, the slamming of a door, and the young Englishman's whistle
sounded shrill and untuneful as he went to his room in the factor's
house. For a moment Jan straightened himself rigidly, and there was a
strange tenseness in the thin, dark face that he turned straight up to
where the Northern Lights were shivering in their midnight play. When
he looked again at the light in the little cabin the passion-blood was
rushing through his veins, and he fingered the hilt of the hunting
knife in his belt.</p>

<p>The most beautiful thing in the world had come into Jan's life, and
the other lives at the post, just two summers before. Cummins,
red-headed, lithe as a cat, big-souled as the eternal mountain of the
Crees and the best of the Company's hunters, had brought her up as his
bride. Seventeen rough hearts had welcomed them. They had assembled
about that little cabin in which the light was shining, speechless in
their adoration of this woman who had come among them, their caps in
their hands, faces shining, eyes shifting before the glorious ones that
looked at them and smiled at them as the woman shook their hands, one
by one. Perhaps she was not beautiful, as most people judge. But she
was beautiful here&mdash;four hundred miles beyond civilization. Mukee,
the half-Cree, had never seen a white woman, for even the factor's wife
was part Chippewayan, and no one of the others went down to the edge of
the southern wilderness more than once each twelve-month or so. Her
hair was brown and soft, and it shone with a sunny glory that reached
away back into their conception of things dreamed of but never seen,
her eyes were as blue as the early snowflowers that came after the
spring floods, and her voice was the sweetest sound that had ever
fallen upon their ears. So these men thought when Cummins first brought
home his wife, and the masterpiece which each had painted in his soul
and brain was never changed. Each week and month added to the
deep-toned value of that picture, as the passing of a century might add
to a Raphael or a Van Dyke. The woman became more human, and less an
angel, of course, but that only made her more real, and allowed them to
become acquainted with her, to talk with her, and to love her more.
There was no thought of wrong&mdash;until the Englishman came; for the
devotion of these men who lived alone, and mostly wifeless, was a great
passionless love unhinting of sin, and Cummins and his wife accepted
it, and added to it when they could, and were the happiest pair in all
that vast Northland.</p>

<p>The first year brought great changes. The girl&mdash;she was scarce
more than budding into womanhood&mdash;fell happily into the ways of
her new life. She did nothing that was elementally
unusual&mdash;nothing more than any pure woman reared in the love of a
God and home would have done. In her spare hours she began to teach the
half dozen wild little children about the post, and every Sunday told
them wonderful stories out of the Bible. She ministered to the sick,
for that was a part of her code of life. Everywhere she carried her
glad smile, her cheery greeting, her wistful earnestness to brighten
what seemed to her the sad and lonely lives of these silent, worshipful
men of the North. And she succeeded, not because she was unlike other
millions of her kind, but because of the difference between the
fortieth and the sixtieth degrees&mdash;the difference in the viewpoint
of men who fought themselves into moral shreds in the big game of life
and those who lived a thousand miles nearer to the dome of the earth.
At the end of this first year came the wonderful event in the history
of the Company's post, which had the Barren Lands at its back door. One
day a new life was born into the little cabin of Cummins and his
wife.</p>

<p>After this the silent, wordless worship of Jan and his people was
filled with something very near to pathos. Cummins' wife was a mother.
She was one of them now, a part of their indissoluble existence&mdash;a
part of it as truly as the strange lights forever hovering over the
Pole, as surely as the countless stars that never left the night skies,
as surely as the endless forests and the deep snows! There was an added
value to Cummins now. If there was a long and dangerous mission to
perform it was somehow arranged so that he was left behind. Only Jan
and one or two others knew why his traps made the best catch of fur,
for more than once he had slipped a mink of an ermine or a fox into one
of Cummins' traps, knowing that it would mean a luxury or two for the
woman and the baby. And when Cummins left the post, sometimes for a day
and sometimes longer, the mother and her child fell as a brief heritage
to those who remained. The keenest eyes would not have discovered that
this was so.</p>

<p>In the second year, with the beginning of trapping, fell the second
and third great events. Cummins disappeared. Then came the Englishman.
For a time the first of these two overshadowed everything else at the
post. Cummins had gone to prospect a new trap-line, and was to sleep
out the first night. The second night he was still gone. On the third
day came the "Beeg Snow." It began at dawn, thickened as the day went,
and continued to thicken until it became that soft, silent deluge of
white in which no man dared venture a thousand yards from his door. The
Aurora was hidden. There were no stars in the sky at night. Day was
weighted with a strange, noiseless gloom. In all that wilderness there
was not a creature that moved. Sixty hours later, when visible life was
resumed again, the caribou, the wolf and the fox dug themselves up out
of six feet of snow, and found the world changed.</p>

<p>It was at the beginning of the "Beeg Snow" that Jan went to the
woman's cabin. He tapped upon her door with the timidity of a child,
and when she opened it, her great eyes glowing at him in wild
questioning, her face white with a terrible fear, there was a chill at
his heart which choked back what he had come to say. He walked in
dumbly and stood with the snow falling off him in piles, and when
Cummins' wife saw neither hope nor foreboding in his dark, set face she
buried her face in her arms upon the little table and sobbed softly in
her despair. Jan strove to speak, but the Cree in him drove back what
was French and "just white," and he stood in mute, trembling torture.
"Ah, the Great God!" his soul was crying. "What can I do?"</p>

<p>Upon its little cot the woman's child was asleep. Beside the stove
there were a few sticks of wood. He stretched himself until his neck
creaked to see if there was water in the barrel near the door. Then he
looked again at the bowed head and the shivering form at the table. In
that moment Jan's resolution soared very near to the terrible.</p>

<p>"Mees Cummin, I go hunt for heem!" he cried. "I go hunt for
heem&mdash;an' fin' heem!"</p>

<p>He waited another moment, and then backed softly toward the
door.</p>

<p>"I hunt for heem!" he repeated, fearing that she had not heard.</p>

<p>She lifted her face, and the beating of Jan's heart sounded to him
like the distant thrumming of partridge wings. Ah, the Great
God&mdash;would he ever forget that look! She was coming to him, a new
glory in her eyes, her arms reaching out, her lips parted! Jan knew how
the Great Spirit had once appeared to Mukee, the half-Cree, and how a
white mist, like a snow veil, had come between the half-breed's eyes
and the wondrous thing he beheld. And that same snow veil drifted
between Jan and the woman. Like in a vision he saw her glorious face so
near to him that his blood was frightened into a strange, wonderful
sensation that it had never known before. He felt the touch of her
sweet breath, he heard her passionate prayer, he knew that one of his
rough hands was clasped in both her own&mdash;and he knew, too, that
their soft, thrilling warmth would remain with him until he died, and
still go into Paradise with him.</p>

<p>When he trudged back into the snow, knee-deep now, he sought Mukee,
the half-breed. Mukee had suffered a lynx bite that went deep into the
bone, and Cummins' wife had saved his hand. After that the savage in
him was enslaved to her like an invisible spirit, and when Jan slipped
on his snowshoes to set out into the deadly chaos of the "Beeg Storm"
Mukee was ready to follow. A trail through the spruce forest led them
to the lake across which Jan knew that Cummins had intended to go.
Beyond that, a matter of six miles or so, there was a deep and lonely
break between two mountainous ridges in which Cummins believed he might
find lynx. Indian instinct guided the two across the lake. There they
separated, Jan going as nearly as he could guess into the northwest,
Mukee trailing swiftly and hopelessly into the south, both inspired in
the face of death by the thought of a woman with sunny hair, and with
lips and eyes that had sent many a shaft of hope and gladness into
their desolate hearts.</p>

<p>It was no great sacrifice for Jan, this struggle with the "Beeg
Snows" for the woman's sake. What it was to Mukee, the half-Cree, no
man ever guessed or knew, for it was not until the late spring snows
had gone that they found what the foxes and the wolves had left of him,
far to the south.</p>

<p>A hand, soft and gentle, guided Jan. He felt the warmth of it and
the thrill of it, and neither the warmth nor the thrill grew less as
the hours passed and the snow fell deeper. His soul was burning with a
joy that it had never known. Beautiful visions danced in his brain, and
always he heard the woman's voice praying to him in the little cabin,
saw her eyes upon him through that white snow veil! Ah, what would he
not give if he could find the man, if he could take Cummins back to his
wife, and stand for one moment more with her hands clasping his, her
joy flooding him with a sweetness that would last for all time! He
plunged fearlessly into the white world beyond the lake, his wide
snowshoes sinking ankle-deep at every step. There was neither rock nor
tree to guide him, for everywhere was the heavy ghost-raiment of the
Indian God. The balsams were bending under it, the spruces were
breaking into hunchback forms, the whole world was twisted in noiseless
torture under its increasing weight, and out through the still terror
of it all Jan's voice went in wild echoing shouts. Now and then he
fired his rifle, and always he listened long and intently. The echoes
came back to him, laughing, taunting, and then each time fell the
mirthless silence of the storm. Night came, a little darker than the
day, and Jan stopped to build a fire and eat sparingly of his food, and
to sleep. It was still night when he aroused himself and stumbled on.
Never did he take the weight of his rifle from his right hand or
shoulder, for he knew this weight would shorten the distance traveled
at each step by his right foot, and would make him go in a circle that
would bring him back to the lake. But it was a long circle. The day
passed. A second night fell upon him, and his hope of finding Cummins
was gone. A chill crept in where his heart had been so warm, and
somehow that soft pressure of a woman's hand upon his seemed to become
less and less real to him. The woman's prayers were following him, her
heart was throbbing with its hope in him&mdash;and he had failed! On
the third day, when the storm was over, Jan staggered hopelessly into
the post. He went straight to the woman, disgraced, heartbroken. When
he came out of the little cabin he seemed to have gone mad. A
wondrously strange thing had happened. He had spoken not a word, but
his failure and his sufferings were written in his face, and when
Cummins' wife saw and understood she went as white as the underside of
a poplar leaf in a clouded sun. But that was not all. She came to him,
and clasped one of his half-frozen hands to her bosom, and he heard her
say, "God bless you forever, Jan! You have done the best you could!"
The Great God&mdash;was that not reward for the risking of a miserable,
worthless life such as his? He went to his shack and slept long, and
dreamed, sometimes of the woman, and of Cummins and Mukee, the
half-Cree.</p>

<p>On the first crust of the new snow came the Englishman up from Fort
Churchill, on Hudson's Bay. He came behind six dogs, and was driven by
an Indian, and he bore letters to the factor which proclaimed him
something of considerable importance at the home office of the Company,
in London. As such he was given the best bed in the factor's rude home.
On the second day he saw Cummins' wife at the Company's store, and very
soon learned the history of Cummins' disappearance.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of the real tragedy at the post. The
wilderness is a grim oppressor of life. To those who survive in it the
going out of life is but an incident, an irresistible and natural
thing, unpleasant but without horror. So it was with the passing of
Cummins. But the Englishman brought with him something new, as the
woman had brought something new, only in this instance it was an
element of life which Jan and his people could not understand, an
element which had never found a place, and never could, in the hearts
and souls of the post. On the other hand, it promised to be but an
incident to the Englishman, a passing adventure in pleasure common to
the high and glorious civilization from which he had come. Here again
was that difference of viewpoint, the eternity of difference between
the middle and the end of the earth. As the days passed, and the crust
grew deeper upon the "Beeg Snows," the tragedy progressed rapidly
toward finality. At first Jan did not understand. The others did not
understand. When the worm of the Englishman's sin revealed itself it
struck them with a dumb, terrible fear.</p>

<p>The Englishman came from among women. For months he had been in a
torment of desolation. Cummins' wife was to him like a flower suddenly
come to relieve the tantalizing barrenness of a desert, and with the
wiles and soft speech of his kind he sought to breathe its fragrance.
In the weeks that followed the flower seemed to come nearer to him, and
this was because Jan and his people had not as yet fully measured the
heart of the woman, and because the Englishman had not measured Jan and
his people he talked a great deal when enthused by the warmth of the
box stove and his thoughts. So human passions were set at play. Because
the woman knew nothing of what was said about the box stove she
continued in the even course of her pure life, neither resisting nor
encouraging the newcomer, yet ever tempting him with that sweetness
which she gave to all alike, and still praying in the still hours of
night that Cummins would return to her. As yet there was no suspicion
in her soul. She accepted the Englishman's friendship. His sympathy for
her won him a place in her recognition of things good and true. She did
not hear the false note, she saw no step that promised evil. Only Jan
and his people saw and understood the one-sided struggle, and shivered
at the monstrous evil of it. At least they thought they saw and
understood, which was enough. Like so many faithful beasts they were
ready to spring, to rend flesh, to tear life out of him who threatened
the desecration of all that was good and pure and beautiful to them,
and yet, dumb in their devotion and faith, they waited and watched for
a sign from the woman. The blue eyes of Cummins' wife, the words of her
gentle lips, the touch of her hands had made law at the post. She,
herself, had become the omniscience of all that was law to them, and if
she smiled upon the Englishman, and talked with him, and was pleased
with him, that was only one other law that she had made for them to
respect. So they were quiet, evaded the Englishman as much as possible,
and watched&mdash;always watch ed.</p>

<p>These were days when something worse than disease was eating at the
few big honest hearts that made up the life at the post. The search for
Cummins never ceased, and always the woman was receiving hope. Now it
was Williams who went far into the South, and brought back word that a
strange white man had been seen among the Indians; then it was Thoreau,
the Frenchman, who skirted the edge of the Barren Lands three days into
the West, and said that he had found the signs of strange campfires.
And always Jan was on the move, to the South, the North, the East and
the West. The days began to lengthen. It was dawn now at eight o'clock
instead of nine, the silvery white of the sun was turning day by day
more into the glow of fire, and for a few minutes at midday the snow
softened and water dripped from the roofs.</p>

<p>Jan knew what it meant. Very soon the thick crust of the "Beeg Snow"
would drop in, and they would find Cummins. They would bring what was
left of him back to the post. And then&mdash;what would happen
then?</p>

<p>Every day or two Jan found some pretext that took him to the little
log cabin. Now it was to convey to the woman a haunch of a caribou he
had slain. Again it was to bring her child a strange plaything from the
forest. More frequently it was to do the work that Cummins would have
done. He seldom went within the low door, but stood outside, speaking a
few words, while Cummins' wife talked to him. But one morning, when the
sun was shining down with the first promising warmth of spring, the
woman stepped hack from the door and asked him in.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you something, Jan," she said softly. "I have been
thinking about it for a long time. I must find some work to do. I must
do something&mdash;to earn&mdash;money."</p>

<p>Jan's eyes leaped straight to hers in sudden horror.</p>

<p>"Work!"</p>

<p>The word fell from him as if in its utterance there was something of
crime. Then he stood speechless, awed by the look in her eyes, the hard
gray pallor that came into her face.</p>

<p>"May God bless you for all you have done, Jan, and may God bless the
others! I want you to take that word to them from me. But he will never
come back, Jan&mdash;never. Tell the men that I love them as brothers,
and always shall love them, but now that I know he is dead I can no
longer live as a drone among them. I will do anything. I will make your
coats, do your washing and mend your moccasins. To-morrow I begin my
first work&mdash;for money."</p>

<p>He heard what she said after that as if in a dream. When he went out
into the day again, with her word to his people, he knew that in some
way which he could not understand this big, cold world had changed for
him. To-morrow Cummins' wife was to begin writing letters for the
Englishman! His eyes glittered, his hands clenched themselves upon his
breast, and all the blood in him submerged itself in one wild
resistless impulse. An hour later Jan and his four dogs were speeding
swiftly into the South.</p>

<p>The next day the Englishman went to the woman's cabin. He did not
return in the afternoon. And that same afternoon, when Cummins' wife
came into the Company's store, a quick flush shot into her cheeks and
the glitter of blue diamonds into her eyes when she saw the Englishman
standing there. The man's red face grew redder, and he shifted his
gaze. When Cummins' wife passed him she drew her skirt close to her,
and there was the poise of a queen in her head, the glory of mother and
wife and womanhood, the living, breathing essence of all that was
beautiful in Jan's "honor of the Beeg Snows." But Jan, twenty miles to
the south, did not know.</p>

<p>He returned on the fourth night and went quietly to his little shack
in the edge of the balsam forest. In the glow of the oil lamp which he
lighted he rolled up his treasure of winter-caught furs into a small
pack. Then he opened his door and walked straight and fearlessly toward
the cabin of Cummins' wife. It was a pale, glorious night, and Jan
lifted his face to its starry skies and filled his lungs near to
bursting with its pure air, and when he was within a few steps of the
woman's door he burst into a wild snatch of triumphant forest song. For
this was a new Jan who was returning to her, a man who had gone out
into the solitudes and fought a great battle with the elementary things
in him, and who, because of his triumph over these things, was filled
with the strength and courage to live a great lie. The woman heard his
voice, and recognized it. The door swung open, wide and brimful of
light, and in it stood Cummins' wife, her child hugged close in her
arms.</p>

<p>Jan crowed close up out of the starry gloom.</p>

<p>"I fin' heem, Mees Cummins&mdash;I fin' heem nint' miles back in
Cree wigwam&mdash;with broke leg. He come home soon&mdash;he sen' great
love&mdash;an' THESE!"</p>

<p>And he dropped his furs at the woman's feet....</p>

<p>"Ah, the Great God!" cried Jan's tortured soul when it was all over.
"At least she shall not work for the dirty Englishman."</p>

<p>First he awoke the factor, and told him what he had done. Then he
went to Williams, and after that, one by one, these three visited the
four other white and part white men at the post. They lived very near
to the earth, these seven, and the spirit of the golden rule was as
natural to their living as green sap to the trees. So they stood
shoulder to shoulder to Jan in a scheme that appalled them, and in the
very first day of this scheme they saw the woman blossoming forth in
her old beauty and joy, and at times fleeting visions of the old
happiness at the post came to these lonely men who were searing their
souls for her. But to Jan one vision came to destroy all others, and as
the old light returned to the woman's eyes, the glad smile to her lips,
the sweetness of thankfulness and faith into her voice, this vision
hurt him until he rolled and tossed in agony at night, and by day his
feet were never still. His search for Cummins now had something of
madness in it. It was his one hope&mdash;where to the other six there
was no hope. And one day this spark went out of him. The crust was
gone. The snow was settling. Beyond the lake he found the chasm between
the two mountains, and, miles of this chasm, robbed to the bones of
flesh, he found Cummins. The bones, and Cummins' gun, and all that was
left of him, he buried in a crevasse.</p>

<p>He waited until night to return to the post. Only one light was
burning when he came out into the clearing, and that was the light in
the woman's cabin. In the edge of the balsams he sat down to watch it,
as he had watched it a hundred nights before. Suddenly something came
between him and the light. Against the cabin he saw the shadow of a
human form, and as silently as the steely flash of the Aurora over his
head, as swiftly as a lean deer, he sped through the gloom of the
forest's edge and came up behind the home of the woman and her child.
With the caution of a lynx, his head close to the snow, he peered
around the end of the logs. It was the Englishman who stood looking
through the tear in the curtained window! Jan's moccasined feet made no
sound. His hand fell as gently as a child's upon the Englishman's
arm.</p>

<p>"Thees is not the honor of the Beeg Snows!" he whispered.
"Come."</p>

<p>A sickly pallor filled the Englishman's face. But Jan's voice was
soft and dispassionate, his touch was velvety in its hint, and he went
with the guiding hand away from the curtained window, smiling in a
companionable way. Jan's teeth gleamed back. The Englishman chuckled.
Then Jan's hands changed. They flew to the thick reddening throat of
the man from civilization, and without a sound the two sank together
upon the snow. It was many minutes before Jan rose to his feet. The
next day Williams set out for Fort Churchill with word for the
Company's home office that the Englishman had died in the "Beeg Snow,"
which was true.</p>

<p>The end was not far away now. Jan was expecting it day by day, hour
by hour. But it came in a way that he did not expect. A month had gone,
and Cummins had not come up from among the Crees. At times there was a
strange light in the woman's eyes as she questioned the men at the
post. Then, one day, the factor's son told Jan that she wanted to see
him in the little cabin at the other end of the clearing.</p>

<p>A shiver went through him as he came to the door. It was more than a
spirit of unrest in Jan to-day, more than suspicion, more than his old
dread of that final moment of the tragedy he was playing, which would
condemn him to everlasting perdition in the woman's eyes. It was pain,
poignant, terrible&mdash;something which he could not name, something
upon which he could place his hand, and yet which filled him with a
desire to throw himself upon his face in the snow and sob out his grief
as he had seen the little children do. It was not dread, but the
torment of reality, that gripped him now, and when he faced the woman
he knew why. There had come a terrible change, but a quiet change, in
Cummins' wife. The luster had gone from her eyes. There was a dead
whiteness in her face that went to the roots of her shimmering hair,
and as she spoke to Jan she clutched one hand upon her bosom, which
rose and fell as Jan had seen the breast of a mother lynx rise and fall
in the last torture of its death.</p>

<p>"Jan," she panted, "Jan&mdash;you have lied to me!"</p>

<p>Jan's head dropped. The worn caribou skin of his coat crumpled upon
his breast. His heart died. And yet he found voice, soft, low,
simple.</p>

<p>"Yes, me lie!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you lied to me!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;me&mdash;lie&mdash;"</p>

<p>His head dropped lower. He heard the sobbing breath of the woman,
and gently his arm crooked itself, and his fingers rose slowly, very
slowly, toward the hilt of his hunting knife.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Mees Cummins&mdash;me lie&mdash;"</p>

<p>There came a sudden swift, sobbing movement, and the woman was at
Jan's feet, clasping his hand to her bosom as she had clasped it once
before when he had gone out to face death for her. But this time the
snow veil was very thick before Jan's eyes, and he did not see her
face. Only he heard.</p>

<p>"Bless you, dear Jan, and may God bless you evermore! For you have
been good to me, Jan&mdash;so good&mdash;to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he went out into the day again a few moments later, leaving her
alone in her great grief, for Jan was a man in the wild and mannerless
ways of a savage world, and he knew not how to comfort in the fashion
of that other world which had other conceptions and another
understanding of what was to him the "honor of the Beeg Snows." A week
later the woman announced her intention of returning to her people, for
the dome of the earth had grown sad and lonely and desolate to her now
that Cummins was forever gone. Sometimes the death of a beloved friend
brings with it the sadness that spread like a pall over Jan and those
others who had lived very near to contentment and happiness for nearly
two years, only each knew that this grief of his would be as enduring
as life itself. For a brief space the sweetest of all God's things had
come among them, a pure woman who brought with her the gentleness and
beauty and hallowed thoughts of civilization in place of its
iniquities, and the pictures in their hearts were imperishable.</p>

<p>The parting was as simple and as quiet as when the woman had come.
They went to the little cabin where the sledge dogs stood harnessed.
Hatless, silent, crowding back their grief behind grim and lonely
countenances, they waited for Cummins' wife to say good-bye. The woman
did not speak. She held up her child for each man to kiss, and the baby
babbled meaningless things into the bearded faces that it had come to
know and love, and when it came to Williams' turn he whispered, "Be a
good baby, be a good baby." And when it was all over the woman crushed
the child to her breast and dropped sobbing upon the sledge, and Jan
cracked his whip and shouted hoarsely to the dogs, for it was Jan who
was to drive her to civilization. Long after they had disappeared
beyond the clearing those who remained stood looking at the cabin; and
then, with a dry, strange sob in his throat, Williams led the way
inside. When they came out Williams brought a hammer with him, and
nailed the door tight.</p>

<p>"Mebby she'll come back some day," he said.</p>

<p>That was all, but the others understood.</p>

<p>For nine days Jan raced his dogs into the South. On the tenth they
came to Le Pas. It was night when they stopped before the little log
hotel, and the gloom hid the twitching in Jan's face.</p>

<p>"You will stay here&mdash;to-night?" asked the woman.</p>

<p>"Me go back&mdash;now," said Jan.</p>

<p>Cummins' wife came very close to him. She did not urge, for she,
too, was suffering the torture of this last parting with the "honor of
the Beeg Snows." It was not the baby's face that came to Jan's now, but
the woman's. He felt the soft touch of her lips, and his soul burst
forth in a low, agonized cry.</p>

<p>"The good God bless you, and keep you, and care for you evermore,
Jan," she whispered. "Some day we will meet again."</p>

<p>And she kissed him again, and lifted the child to him, and Jan
turned his tired dogs back into the grim desolation of the North, where
the Aurora was lighting his way feebly, and beckoning to him, and
telling him that the old life of centuries and centuries ago was
waiting for him there.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_11">BUCKY SEVERN</a></h3>

<p>Father Brochet had come south from Fond du Lac, and Weyman, the
Hudson's Bay Company doctor, north through the Geikee River country.
They had met at Severn's cabin, on the Waterfound. Both had come on the
same mission&mdash;to see Severn; one to keep him from dying, if that
was possible, one to comfort him in the last hour, if death came.
Severn insisted on living. Bright-eyed, hollow-cheeked, with a racking
cough that reddened the gauze handkerchief the doctor had given him, he
sat bolstered up in his cot and looked out through the open door with
glad and hopeful gaze. Weyman had arrived only half an hour before.
Outside was the Indian canoeman who had helped to bring him up.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day, such as comes in its full beauty only in the
far northern spring, where the air enters the lungs like sharp, warm
wine, laden with the tang of spruce and balsam, and the sweetness of
the bursting poplar-buds.</p>

<p>"It was mighty good of you to come up," Severn was saying to the
doctor. "The company has always been the best friend I've ever
had&mdash;except one&mdash;and that's why I've hung to it all these
years, trailing the sledges first as a kid, you know, then trapping,
running, and&mdash;oh, Lord!"</p>

<p>He stopped to cough, and the little black-frocked missioner, looking
across at Weyman, saw him bite his lips.</p>

<p>"That cough hurts, but it's better," Severn apologized, smiling
weakly. "Funny, ain't it, a man like me coming down with a cough? Why,
I've slept in ice a thousand times, with snow for a pillow and the
thermometer down to fifty. But this last winter it was cold, seventy or
lower, an' I worked in it when I ought to have been inside, warming my
toes. But, you see, I wanted to get the cabin built, an' things all
cleared up about here, before SHE came. It's the cold that got me,
wasn't it, doc?"</p>

<p>"That's it," said Weyman, rolling and lighting a cigarette. Then he
laughed, as the sick man finished another coughing spell, and said:</p>

<p>"I never thought you'd have a love affair, Bucky!"</p>

<p>"Neither did I," chuckled Severn. "Ain't it a wonder, doc? Here I'm
thirty-eight, with a hide on me like leather, an' no thought of a woman
for twenty years, until I saw HER. I don't mean it's a wonder I fell in
love, doc&mdash;you'd 'a' done that if you'd met her first. The wonder
of it is that she fell in love with me." He laughed softly. "I'll bet
Father Brochet'll go in a heap himself when he marries us! It's goin'
to happen next month. Did you ever see her, father&mdash;Marie La
Corne, over at the post on Split Lake?"</p>

<p>Severn dropped his head to cough, but Weyman say the sudden look of
horror that leaped into the little priest's face.</p>

<p>"Marie La Corne!"</p>

<p>"Yes, at Split Lake."</p>

<p>Severn looked up again. He had missed what Weyman had seen.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've seen her."</p>

<p>Bucky Severn's eyes lit up with pleasure.</p>

<p>"She's&mdash;she's beautiful, ain't she?" he cried in hoarse
whisper. "Ain't it a wonder, father? I come up there with a canoe full
of supplies, last spring about this time, an'&mdash;an' at first I
hardly dast to look at her; but it came out all right. When I told her
I was coming over here to build us a home, she wanted me to bring her
along to help; but I wouldn't. I knew it was goin' to be hard this
winter, and she's never goin' to work&mdash;never so long as I live. I
ain't had much to do with women, but I've seen 'em and I've watched 'em
an' she's never goin' to drudge like the rest. If she'll let me, I'm
even goin' to do the cookin' an' the dish-washing and scrub the floors!
I've done it for twenty-five years, an' I'm tough. She ain't goin' to
do nothin' but sew for the kids when they come, an' sing, an' be happy.
When it comes to the work that there ain't no fun in, I'll do it. I've
planned it all out. We're goin' to have half an arpent square of
flowers, an' she'll love to work among 'em. I've got the ground
cleared&mdash;out there&mdash;you kin see it by twisting your head
through the door. An' she's goin' to have an organ. I've got the money
saved, an' it's coming to Churchill on the next ship. That's goin' to
be a surprise&mdash;'bout Christmas, when the snow is hard an' sledging
good. You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped again to cough. A hectic flush filled his hollow cheeks,
and there was a feverish glow in his eyes. As he bent his head, the
priest looked at Weyman. The doctor's lips were tense. His cigarette
was unlighted.</p>

<p>"I know what it means for a woman to die a workin'," Severn went on.
"My mother did that. I can remember it, though I was only a kid. She
was bent an' stoop-shouldered, an' her hands were rough and twisted. I
know now why she used to hug me up close and croon funny things over me
when father was away. When I first told my Marie what I was goin' to
do, she laughed at me; but when I told her 'bout my mother, an' how
work an' freezin' an' starvin' killed her when I needed her most, Marie
jest put her hand up to my face an' looked queer&mdash;an' then she
burst out crying like a baby. She understands, Marie does! She knows
what I'm goin' to do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mustn't talk any more, Bucky," warned the doctor, feeling his
pulse. "It'll hurt you."</p>

<p>"Hurt me!" Severn laughed hysterically, as If what the doctor had
said was a joke. "Hurt me? It's what's going to put me on my feet, doc.
I know it now, I been too much alone this last winter, with nothin' but
my dogs to talk to when night come. I ain't never been much of a
talker, but she got me out o' that. She used to tease me at first, an'
I'd get red in the face an' almost bust. An' then, one day, it come,
like a bung out of a hole, an' I've had a hankerin' to talk ever since.
Hurt me!"</p>

<p>He gave an incredulous chuckle, which ended in a cough.</p>

<p>"Do you know, I wish I could read better 'n I can!" he said
suddenly, leaning almost eagerly toward Father Brochet. "She knows I
ain't great shucks at that. She's goin' to have a school just as soon
as she comes, an' I'm goin' to be the scholar. She's got a packful of
books an' magazines an' I'm goin' to tote over a fresh load every
winter. I'd like to surprise her. Can't you help me to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Weyman pressed him back gently.</p>

<p>"See here, Bucky, you've got to lie down and keep quiet," he said.
"If you don't, it will take you a week longer to get well. Try and
sleep a little, while Father Brochet and I go outside and see what
you've done."</p>

<p>When they went out, Weyman closed the door after them. He spoke no
word as he turned and looked upon what Bucky Severn had done for the
coming of his bride. Father Brochet's hand touched the doctor's and it
was cold and trembling.</p>

<p>"How is he?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is the bad malady," said Weyman softly. "The frost has touched
his lungs. One does not feel the effect of that until spring comes.
Then&mdash;a cough&mdash;and the lungs begin literally to slough
away."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That there is no hope&mdash;absolutely none. He will die within two
days."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the little priest straightened himself and lifted his
hands as if about to pronounce a benediction.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he breathed. Then, as quickly, he caught himself. "No,
I don't mean that. God forgive me! But&mdash;it is best." Weyman stared
incredulously into his face.</p>

<p>"It is best," repeated the other, as gently as if speaking a prayer.
"How strangely the Creator sometimes works out His ends! I came
straight here from Split Lake. Marie La Corne died two weeks ago. It
was I who said the last prayer over her dead body!"</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_12">HIS FIRST PENITENT</a></h3>

<p>In a white wilderness of moaning storm, in a wilderness of miles and
miles of black pine-trees, the Transcontinental Flier lay buried in the
snow. In the first darkness of the wild December night, engine and
tender had rushed on ahead to division headquarters, to let the line
know that the flier had given up the fight, and needed assistance. They
had been gone two hours, and whiter and whiter grew the brilliantly
lighted coaches in the drifts and winnows of the whistling storm. From
the black edges of the forest, prowling eyes might have looked upon
scores of human faces staring anxiously out into the blackness from the
windows of the coaches.</p>

<p>In those coaches it was growing steadily colder. Men were putting on
their overcoats, and women snuggled deeper in their furs. Over it all,
the tops of the black pine-trees moaned and whistled in sounds that
seemed filled both with menace and with savage laughter.</p>

<p>In the smoking-compartment of the Pullman sat five men, gathered in
a group. Of these, one was Forsythe, the timber agent; two were
traveling men; the fourth a passenger homeward bound from a holiday
visit; and the fifth was Father Charles. The priest's pale, serious
face lit up in surprise or laughter with the others, but his lips had
not broken into a story of their own. He was a little man, dressed in
somber black, and there was that about him which told his companions
that within his tight-drawn coat of shiny black there were hidden tales
which would have gone well with the savage beat of the storm against
the lighted windows and the moaning tumult of the pine-trees.</p>

<p>Suddenly Forsythe shivered at a fiercer blast than the others, and
said:</p>

<p>"Father, have you a text that would fit this night&mdash;and the
situation?"</p>

<p>Slowly Father Charles blew out a spiral of smoke from between his
lips, and then he drew himself erect and leaned a little forward, with
the cigar between his slender white fingers.</p>

<p>"I had a text for this night," he said, "but I have none now,
gentlemen. I was to have married a couple a hundred miles down the
line. The guests have assembled. They are ready, but I am not there.
The wedding will not be to-night, and so my text is gone. But there
comes another to my mind which fits this situation&mdash;and a thousand
others&mdash;'He who sits in the heavens shall look down and decide.'
To-night I was to have married these young people. Three hours ago I
never dreamed of doubting that I should be on hand at the appointed
hour. But I shall not marry them. Fate has enjoined a hand. The Supreme
Arbiter says 'No,' and what may not be the consequences'?"</p>

<p>"They will probably be married to-morrow," said one of the traveling
men. "There will be a few hours' delay&mdash;nothing more."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied Father Charles, as quietly as before.
"And&mdash;perhaps not. Who can say what this little incident may not
mean in the lives of that young man and that young woman&mdash;and, it
may be, in my own? Three or four hours lost in a storm&mdash;what may
they not mean to more than one human heart on this train? The Supreme
Arbiter plays His hand, if you wish to call it that, with reason and
intent. To someone, somewhere, the most insignificant occurrence may
mean life or death. And to-night&mdash;this&mdash;means something."</p>

<p>A sudden blast drove the night screeching over our heads, and the
whining of the pines was almost like human voices. Forsythe sucked a
cigar that had gone out.</p>

<p>"Long ago," said Father Charles, "I knew a young man and a young
woman who were to be married. The man went West to win a fortune. Thus
fate separated them, and in the lapse of a year such terrible
misfortune came to the girl's parents that she was forced into a
marriage with wealth&mdash;a barter of her white body for an old man's
gold. When the young man returned from the West he found his sweetheart
married, and hell upon earth was their lot. But hope lingers in your
hearts. He waited four years; and then, discouraged, he married another
woman. Gentlemen, three days after the wedding his old sweetheart's
husband died, and she was released from bondage. Was not that the hand
of the Supreme Arbiter? If he had waited but three days more, the old
happiness might have lived.</p>

<p>"But wait! One month after that day the young man was arrested,
taken to a Western State, tried for murder, and hanged. Do you see the
point? In three days more the girl who had sold herself into slavery
for the salvation of those she loved would have been released from her
bondage only to marry a murderer!"</p>

<p>There was silence, in which all five listened to that wild moaning
of the storm. There seemed to be something in it now&mdash;something
more than the inarticulate sound of wind and trees. Forsythe scratched
a match and relighted his cigar.</p>

<p>"I never thought of such things in just that light," he said.</p>

<p>"Listen to the wind," said the little priest. "Hear the pine-trees
shriek out there! It recalls to me a night of years and years
ago&mdash;a night like this, when the storm moaned and twisted about my
little cabin, and when the Supreme Arbiter sent me my first penitent.
Gentlemen, it is something which will bring you nearer to an
understanding of the voice and the hand of God. It is a sermon on the
mighty significance of little things, this story of my first penitent.
If you wish, I will tell it to you."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Forsythe.</p>

<p>The traveling men drew nearer.</p>

<p>"It was a night like this," repeated Father Charles, "and it was in
a great wilderness like this, only miles and miles away. I had been
sent to establish a mission; and in my cabin, that wild night, alone
and with the storm shrieking about me, I was busy at work sketching out
my plans. After a time I grew nervous. I did not smoke then, and so I
had nothing to comfort me but my thoughts; and, in spite of my efforts
to make them otherwise, they were cheerless enough. The forest grew to
my door. In the fiercer blasts I could hear the lashing of the
pine-trees over my head, and now and then an arm of one of the moaning
trees would reach down and sweep across my cabin roof with a sound that
made me shudder and fear. This wilderness fear is an oppressive and
terrible thing when you are alone at night, and the world is twisting
and tearing itself outside. I have heard the pine-trees shriek like
dying women, I have heard them wailing like lost children, I have heard
them sobbing and moaning like human souls writhing in agony&mdash;"</p>

<p>Father Charles paused, to peer through the window out into the black
night, where the pine-trees were sobbing and moaning now. When he
turned, Forsythe, the timber agent, whose life was a wilderness life,
nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"And when they cry like that," went on Father Charles, "a living
voice would be lost among them as the splash of a pebble is lost in the
roaring sea. A hundred times that night I fancied that I heard human
voices; and a dozen times I went to my door, drew back the bolt, and
listened, "with the snow and the wind beating about my ears.</p>

<p>"As I sat shuddering before my fire, there came a thought to me of a
story which I had long ago read about the sea&mdash;a story of
impossible achievement and of impossible heroism. As vividly as if I
had read it only the day before, I recalled the description of a wild
and stormy night when the heroine placed a lighted lamp in the window
of her sea-bound cottage, to guide her lover home in safety. Gentlemen,
the reading of that book in my boyhood days was but a trivial thing. I
had read a thousand others, and of them all it was possibly the least
significant; but the Supreme Arbiter had not forgotten.</p>

<p>"The memory of that book brought me to my feet, and I placed a
lighted lamp close up against my cabin window. Fifteen minutes later I
heard a strange sound at the door, and when I opened it there fell in
upon the floor at my feet a young and beautiful woman. And after her,
dragging himself over the threshold on his hands and knees, there came
a man.</p>

<p>"I closed the door, after the man had crawled in and fallen face
downward upon the floor, and turned my attention first to the woman.
She was covered with snow. Her long, beautiful hair was loose and
disheveled, and had blown about her like a veil. Her big, dark eyes
looked at me pleadingly, and in them there was a terror such as I had
never beheld in human eyes before. I bent over her, intending to carry
her to my cot; but in another moment she had thrown herself upon the
prostrate form of the man, with her arms about his head, and there
burst from her lips the first sounds that she had uttered. They were
not much more intelligible than the wailing grief of the pine-trees out
in the night, but they told me plainly enough that the man on the floor
was dearer to her than life.</p>

<p>"I knelt beside him, and found that he was breathing in a quick,
panting sort of way, and that his wide-open eyes were looking at the
woman. Then I noticed for the first time that his face was cut and
bruised, and his lips were swollen. His coat was loose at the throat,
and I could see livid marks on his neck.</p>

<p>"'I'm all right,' he whispered, struggling for breath, and turning
his eyes to me. 'We should have died&mdash;in a few minutes
more&mdash;if it hadn't been for the light in your window!'</p>

<p>"The young woman bent down and kissed him, and then she allowed me
to help her to my cot. When I had attended to the young man, and he had
regained strength enough to stand upon his feet, she was asleep. The
man went to her, and dropped upon his knees beside the cot. Tenderly he
drew back the heavy masses of hair from about her face and shoulders.
For several minutes he remained with his face pressed close against
hers; then he rose, and faced me. The woman&mdash;his wife&mdash;knew
nothing of what passed between us during the next half-hour. During
that half-hour gentlemen, I received my first confession. The young man
was of my faith. He was my first penitent."</p>

<p>It was growing colder in the coach, and Father Charles stopped to
draw his thin black coat closer to him. Forsythe relighted his cigar
for the third time. The transient passenger gave a sudden start as a
gust of wind beat against the window like a threatening hand.</p>

<p>"A rough stool was my confessional, gentlemen," resumed Father
Charles. "He told me the story, kneeling at my feet&mdash;a story that
will live with me as long as I live, always reminding me that the
little things of life may be the greatest things, that by sending a
storm to hold up a coach the Supreme Arbiter may change the map of the
world. It is not a long story. It is not even an unusual story.</p>

<p>"He had come into the North about a year before, and had built for
himself and his wife a little home at a pleasant river spot ten miles
distant from my cabin. Their love was of the kind we do not often see,
and they were as happy as the birds that lived about them in the
wilderness. They had taken a timber claim. A few months more, and a new
life was to come into their little home; and the knowledge of this made
the girl an angel of beauty and joy. Their nearest neighbor was another
man, several miles distant. The two men became friends, and the other
came over to see them frequently. It was the old, old story. The
neighbor fell in love with the young settler's wife.</p>

<p>"As you shall see, this other man was a beast. On the day preceding
the night of the terrible storm, the woman's husband set out for the
settlement to bring back supplies. Hardly had he gone, when the beast
came to the cabin. He found himself alone with the woman.</p>

<p>"A mile from his cabin, the husband stopped to light his pipe. See,
gentlemen, how the Supreme Arbiter played His hand. The man attempted
to unscrew the stem, and the stem broke. In the wilderness you must
smoke. Smoke is your company. It is voice and companionship to you.
There were other pipes at the settlement, ten miles away; but there was
also another pipe at the cabin, one mile away. So the husband turned
back. He came up quietly to his door, thinking that he would surprise
his wife. He heard voices&mdash;a man's voice, a woman's cries. He
opened the door, and in the excitement of what was happening within
neither the man nor the woman saw nor heard him. They were struggling.
The woman was in the man's arms, her hair torn down, her small hands
beating him in the face, her breath coming in low, terrified cries.
Even as the husband stood there for the fraction of a second, taking in
the terrible scene, the other man caught the woman's face to him, and
kissed her. And then&mdash;it happened.</p>

<p>"It was a terrible fight; and when it was over the beast lay on the
floor, bleeding and dead. Gentlemen, the Supreme Arbiter BROKE A
PIPE-STEM, and sent the husband back in time!"</p>

<p>No one spoke as Father Charles drew his coat still closer about him.
Above the tumult of the storm another sound came to them&mdash;the
distant, piercing shriek of a whistle.</p>

<p>"The husband dug a grave through the snow and in the frozen earth,"
concluded Father Charles; "and late that afternoon they packed up a
bundle and set out together for the settlement. The storm overtook
them. They had dropped for the last time into the snow, about to die in
each other's arms, when I put my light in the window. That is all;
except that I knew them for several years afterward, and that the old
happiness returned to them&mdash;and more, for the child was born, a
miniature of its mother. Then they moved to another part of the
wilderness, and I to still another. So you see, gentlemen, what a
snow-bound train may mean, for if an old sea tale, a broken
pipe-stem&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door at the end of the smoking-room opened suddenly. Through it
there came a cold blast of the storm, a cloud of snow, and a man. He
was bundled in a great bearskin coat, and as he shook out its folds his
strong, ruddy face smiled cheerfully at those whom he had
interrupted.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, there came a change in his face. The merriment went
from it. He stared at Father Charles. The priest was rising, his face
more tense and whiter still, his hands reaching out to the
stranger.</p>

<p>In another moment the stranger had leaped to him&mdash;not to shake
his hands, but to clasp the priest in his great arms, shaking him, and
crying out a strange joy, while for the first time that night the pale
face of Father Charles was lighted up with a red and joyous glow.</p>

<p>After several minutes the newcomer released Father Charles, and
turned to the others with a great hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "you must pardon me for interrupting you like
this. You will understand when I tell you that Father Charles is an old
friend of mine, the dearest friend I have on earth, and that I haven't
seen him for years. I was his first penitent!"</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_13">PETER GOD</a></h3>

<p>Peter God was a trapper. He set his deadfalls and fox-baits along
the edge of that long, slim finger of the Great Barren, which reaches
out of the East well into the country of the Great Bear, far to the
West. The door of his sapling-built cabin opened to the dark and
chilling gray of the Arctic Circle; through its one window he could
watch the sputter and play of the Northern Lights; and the curious
hissing purr of the Aurora had grown to be a monotone in his ears.</p>

<p>Whence Peter God had come, and how it was that he bore the strange
name by which he went, no man had asked, for curiosity belongs to the
white man, and the nearest white men were up at Fort MacPherson, a
hundred or so miles away.</p>

<p>Six or seven years ago Peter God had come to the post for the first
time with his furs. He had given his name as Peter God, and the Company
had not questioned it, or wondered. Stranger names than Peter's were a
part of the Northland; stranger faces than his came in out of the white
wilderness trails; but none was more silent, or came in and went more
quickly. In the gray of the afternoon he drove in with his dogs and his
furs; night would see him on his way back to the Barrens, supplies for
another three months of loneliness on his sledge.</p>

<p>It would have been hard to judge his age&mdash;had one taken the
trouble to try. Perhaps he was thirty-eight. He surely was not French.
There was no Indian blood in him. His heavy beard was reddish, his long
thick hair distinctly blond, and his eyes were a bluish-gray.</p>

<p>For seven years, season after season, the Hudson's Bay Company's
clerk had written items something like the following in his
record-books:</p>

<p>Feb. 17. Peter God came in to-day with his furs. He leaves this
afternoon or to-night for his trapping grounds with fresh supplies.</p>

<p>The year before, in a momentary fit of curiosity, the clerk had
added:</p>

<p>Curious why Peter God never stays in Fort MacPherson overnight.</p>

<p>And more curious than this was the fact that Peter God never asked
for mail, and no letter ever came to Fort MacPherson for him.</p>

<p>The Great Barren enveloped him and his mystery. The yapping foxes
knew more of him than men. They knew him for a hundred miles up and
down that white finger of desolation; they knew the peril of his baits
and his deadfalls; they snarled and barked their hatred and defiance at
the glow of his lights on dark nights; they watched for him, sniffed
for signs of him, and walked into his clever deathpits.</p>

<p>The foxes and Peter God! That was what this white world was made up
of&mdash;foxes and Peter God. It was a world of strife between them.
Peter God was killing&mdash;but the foxes were winning. Slowly but
surely they were breaking him down&mdash;they and the terrible
loneliness. Loneliness Peter God might have stood for many more years.
But the foxes were driving him mad. More and more he had come to dread
their yapping at night. That was the deadly combination&mdash;night and
the yapping. In the day-time he laughed at himself for his fears;
nights he sweated, and sometimes wanted to scream. What manner of man
Peter God was or might have been, and of the strangeness of the life
that was lived in the maddening loneliness of that mystery-cabin in the
edge of the Barren, only one other man knew.</p>

<p>That was Philip Curtis.</p>

<p>Two thousand miles south, Philip Curtis sat at a small table in a
brilliantly lighted and fashionable cafe. It was early June, and Philip
had been down from the North scarcely a month, the deep tan was still
in his face, and tiny wind and snow lines crinkled at the corners of
his eyes. He exuded the life of the big outdoors as he sat opposite
pallid-cheeked and weak-chested Barrow, the Mica King, who would have
given his millions to possess the red blood in the other's veins.</p>

<p>Philip had made his "strike," away up on the Mackenzie. That day he
had sold out to Barrow for a hundred thousand. To-night he was filled
with the flush of joy and triumph.</p>

<p>Barrow's eyes shone with a new sort of enthusiasm as he listened to
this man's story of grim and fighting determination that had led to the
discovery of that mountain of mica away up on the Clearwater Bulge. He
looked upon the other's strength, his bronzed face and the glory of
achievement in his eyes, and a great and yearning hopelessness burned
like a dull fire in his heart. He was no older than the man who sat on
the other side of the table&mdash;perhaps thirty-five; yet what a vast
gulf lay between them! He with his millions; the other with that flood
of red blood coming and going in his body, and his wonderful fortune of
a hundred thousand! Barrow leaned a little over the table, and laughed.
It was the laugh of a man who had grown tired of life, in spite of his
millions. Day before yesterday a famous specialist had warned him that
the threads of his life were giving way, one by one. He told this to
Curtis. He confessed to him, with that strange glow in his
eyes,&mdash;a glow that was like making a last fight against total
extinguishment,&mdash;that he would give up his millions and all he had
won for the other's health and the mountain of mica.</p>

<p>"And if it came to a close bargain," he said, "I wouldn't hold out
for the mountain. I'm ready to quit&mdash;and it's too late."</p>

<p>Which, after a little, brought Philip Curtis to tell so much as he
knew of the story of Peter God. Philip's voice was tuned with the winds
and the forests. It rose above the low and monotonous hum about them.
People at the two or three adjoining tables might have heard his story,
if they had listened. Within the immaculateness of his evening dress,
Barrows shivered, fearing that Curtis' voice might attract undue
attention to them. But other people were absorbed in themselves. Philip
went on with his story, and at last, so clearly that it reached easily
to the other tables, he spoke the name of Peter God.</p>

<p>Then came the interruption, and with that interruption a strange and
sudden upheaval in the life of Philip Curtis that was to mean more to
him than the discovery of the mica mountain. His eyes swept over
Barrow's shoulder, and there he saw a woman. She was standing. A low,
stifled cry had broken from her almost simultaneously with his first
glimpse of her, and as he looked, Philip saw her lips form gaspingly
the name he had spoken&mdash;Peter God!</p>

<p>She was so near that Barrow could have turned and touched her. Her
eyes were like luminous fires as she stared at Philip. Her face was
strangely pale. He could see her quiver, and catch her breath. And she
was looking at him. For that one moment she had forgotten the presence
of others.</p>

<p>Then a hand touched her arm. It was the hand of her elderly escort,
in whose face were anxiety and wonder. The woman started and took her
eyes from Philip. With her escort she seated herself at a table a few
paces away, and for a few moments Philip could see she was fighting for
composure, and that it cost her a struggle to keep her eyes from
turning in his direction while she talked in a low voice to her
companion.</p>

<p>Philip's heart was pounding like an engine. He knew that she was
talking about him now, and he knew that she had cried out when he had
spoken Peter God's name. He forgot Barrow as he looked at her. She was
exquisite, even with that gray pallor that had come so suddenly into
her cheeks. She was not young, as the age of youth is measured. Perhaps
she was thirty, or thirty-two, or thirty-five. If some one had asked
Philip to describe her, he would have said simply that she was
glorious. Yet her entrance had caused no stir. Few had looked at her
until she had uttered that sharp cry. There were a score of women under
the brilliantly lighted chandeliers possessed of more spectacular
beauty, Barrow had partly turned in his seat, and now, with careful
breeding, he faced his companion again.</p>

<p>"Do you know her?" Philip asked.</p>

<p>Barrow shook his head.</p>

<p>"No." Then he added: "Did you see what made her cry out like
that?"</p>

<p>"I believe so," said Philip, and he turned purposely so that the
four people at the next table could hear him. "I think she twisted her
ankle. It's an occasional penance the women make for wearing these
high-heeled shoes, you know."</p>

<p>He looked at her again. Her form was bent toward the white-haired
man who was with her. The man was staring straight over at Philip, a
strange searching look in his face as he listened to what she was
saying. He seemed to question Philip through the short distance that
separated them. And then the woman turned her head slowly, and once
more Philip met her eyes squarely&mdash;deep, dark, glowing eyes that
thrilled him to the quick of his soul. He did not try to understand
what he saw in them. Before he turned his glance to Barrow he saw that
color had swept back into her face; her lips were parted; he knew that
she was struggling to suppress a tremendous emotion.</p>

<p>Barrow was looking at him curiously&mdash;and Philip went on with
his story of Peter God. He told it in a lower voice. Not until he had
finished did he look again in the direction of the other table. The
woman had changed her position slightly, so that he could not see her
face. The uptilt of her hat revealed to him the warm soft glow of
shining coils of brown hair. He was sure that her escort was keeping
watch of his movements.</p>

<p>Suddenly Barrow drew his attention to a man sitting alone a dozen
tables from them.</p>

<p>"There's DeVoe, one of the Amalgamated chiefs," he said. "He has
almost finished, and I want to speak to him before he leaves. Will you
excuse me a minute&mdash;or will you come along and meet him?"</p>

<p>"I'll wait," said Philip.</p>

<p>Ten seconds later, the woman's white-haired escort was on his feet.
He came to Philip's table, and seated himself casually in Barrow's
chair, as though Philip were an old friend with whom he had come to
chat for a moment.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for the imposition which I am laying upon you,"
he said in a low, quiet voice. "I am Colonel McCloud. The lady with me
is my daughter. And you, I believe, are a gentleman. If I were not sure
of that, I should not have taken advantage of your friend's temporary
absence. You heard my daughter cry out a few moments ago? You observed
that she was&mdash;disturbed?"</p>

<p>Philip nodded.</p>

<p>"I could not help it. I was facing her. And since then I have
thought that I&mdash;unconsciously&mdash;was the cause of her
perturbation. I am Philip Curtis, Colonel McCloud, from Fort
MacPherson, two thousand miles north of here, on the Mackenzie Kiver.
So you see, if it is a case of mistaken identity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;it is not that," interrupted the older man. "As
we were passing your table we&mdash;my daughter&mdash;heard you speak a
name. Perhaps she was mistaken. It was&mdash;Peter God."</p>

<p>"Yes. I know Peter God. He is a friend of mine."</p>

<p>Barrow was returning. The other saw him over Philip's shoulder, and
his voice trembled with a sudden and subdued excitement as he said
quickly:</p>

<p>"Your friend is coming' back. No one but you must know that my
daughter is interested in this man&mdash;Peter God. She trusts you. She
sent me to you. It is important that she should see you to-night and
talk with you alone. I will wait for you outside. I will have a taxicab
ready to take you to our apartments. Will you come?"</p>

<p>He had risen. Philip heard Barrow's footsteps behind him.</p>

<p>"I will come," he said.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Colonel McCloud and his daughter left the cafe.
The half-hour after that passed with leaden slowness to Philip. The
fortunate arrival of two or three friends of Barrow gave him an
opportunity to excuse himself on the plea of an important engagement,
and he bade the Mica King good-night. Colonel McCloud was waiting for
him outside the cafe, and as they entered a taxicab, he said:</p>

<p>"My daughter is quite unstrung to-night, and I sent her home. She is
waiting for us. Will you have a smoke, Mr. Curtis?"</p>

<p>With a feeling that this night had set stirring a brew of strange
and unforeseen events for him, Philip sat in a softly lighted and
richly furnished room and waited. The Colonel had been gone a full
quarter-hour. He had left a box half filled with cigars on a table at
Philip's elbow, pressing him to smoke. They were an English brand of
cigar, and on the box was stamped the name of the Montreal dealer from
whom they had been purchased.</p>

<p>"My daughter will come presently," Colonel McCloud had said.</p>

<p>A curious thrill shot through Philip as he heard her footsteps and
the soft swish of her skirt. Involuntarily he rose to his feet as she
entered the room. For fully ten seconds they stood facing each other
without speaking. She was dressed in filmy gray stuff. There was lace
at her throat. She had shifted the thick bright coils of her hair to
the crown of her head; a splendid glory of hair, he thought. Her cheeks
were flushed, and with her hands against her breast, she seemed
crushing back the strange excitement that glowed in her eyes. Once he
had seen a fawn's eyes that looked like hers. In them were suspense,
fear&mdash;a yearning that was almost pain. Suddenly she came to him,
her hands outstretched. Involuntarily, too, he took them. They were
warm and soft. They thrilled him&mdash;and they clung to him.</p>

<p>"I am Josephine McCloud," she said. "My father has explained to you?
You know&mdash;a man&mdash;who calls himself&mdash;God?"</p>

<p>Her fingers clung more tightly to his, and the sweetness of her
hair, her breath, her eyes were very close as she waited.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know a man who calls himself Peter God."</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;what he is like?" she whispered. "He is
tall&mdash;like you?"</p>

<p>"No. He is of medium height."</p>

<p>"And his hair? It is dark&mdash;dark like yours?"</p>

<p>"No. It is blond, and a little gray."</p>

<p>"And he is young&mdash;younger than you?"</p>

<p>"He is older."</p>

<p>"And his eyes&mdash;are dark?"</p>

<p>He felt rather than heard the throbbing of her heart as she waited
for him to reply. There was a reason why he would never forget Peter
God's eyes.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I thought they were blue, and sometimes gray," he said;
and at that she dropped his hands with a strange little cry, and stood
a step back from him, a joy which she made no effort to keep from him
flaming in her face.</p>

<p>It was a look which sent a sudden hopelessness through
Curtis&mdash;a stinging pang of jealousy. This night had set wild and
tumultous emotions aflame in his breast. He had come to Josephine
McCloud like one in a dream. In an hour he had placed her above all
other women in the world, and in that hour the little gods of fate had
brought him to his knees in the worship of a woman. The fact did not
seem unreal to him. Here was the woman, and he loved her. And his heart
sank like a heavily weighted thing when he saw the transfiguration of
joy that came into her face when he said that Peter God's eyes were not
dark, but were sometimes blue and sometimes gray.</p>

<p>"And this Peter God?" he said, straining to make his voice even.
"What is he to you?"</p>

<p>His question cut her like a knife. The wild color ebbed swiftly out
of her cheeks. Into her eyes swept a haunting fear which he was to see
and wonder at more than once. It was as if he had done something to
frighten her. "We&mdash;my father and I&mdash;are interested in him,"
she said. Her words cost her a visible effort. He noticed a quick
throbbing in her throat, just above the filmy lace. "Mr. Curtis, won't
you pardon this&mdash;this betrayal of excitement in myself? It must be
unaccountable to you. Perhaps a little later you will understand. We
are imposing on you by not confiding in you what this interest is, and
I beg you to forgive me. But there is a reason. Will you believe me?
There is a reason."</p>

<p>Her hands rested lightly on Philip's arm. Her eyes implored him.</p>

<p>"I will not ask for confidences which you are not free to give," he
said gently.</p>

<p>He was rewarded by a soft glow of thankfulness.</p>

<p>"I cannot make you understand how much that means to me," she cried
tremblingly. "And you will tell us about Peter God? Father&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned.</p>

<p>Colonel McCloud had reentered the room.</p>

<p>With the feeling of one who was not quite sure that he was awake,
Philip paused under a street lamp ten minutes after leaving the McCloud
apartments, and looked at his watch. It was a quarter of two o'clock. A
low whistle of surprise fell from his lips. For three hours he had been
with Colonel McCloud and his daughter. It had seemed like an hour. He
still felt the thrill of the warm, parting pressure of Josephine's
hand; he saw the gratitude in her eyes; he heard her voice, low and
tremulous, asking him to come again to-morrow evening. His brain was in
a strange whirl of excitement, and he laughed&mdash;laughed with
gladness which he had not felt before in all the days of his life.</p>

<p>He had told a great many things about Peter God that night; of the
man's life in the little cabin, his loneliness, his aloofness, and the
mystery of him. Philip had asked no questions of Josephine and her
father, and more than once he had caught that almost tender gratitude
in Josephine's eyes. And at least twice he had seen the swift, haunting
fear&mdash;the first time when he told of Peter God's coming and goings
at Port MacPherson, and again when he mentioned a patrol of the Royal
Northwest Mounted Police that had passed Peter God's cabin while Philip
was there, laid up during those weeks of darkness and storm with a
fractured leg.</p>

<p>Philip told how tenderly Peter God nursed him, and how their
acquaintance grew into brotherhood during the long gray nights when the
stars gleamed like pencil-points and the foxes yapped incessantly. He
had seen the dewy shimmer of tears in Josephine's eyes. He had noted
the tense lines in Colonel McCloud's face. But he had asked them no
questions, he had made no effort to unmask the secret which they so
evidently desired to keep from him.</p>

<p>Now, alone in the cool night, he asked himself a hundred questions,
and yet with a feeling that he understood a great deal of what they had
kept from him. Something had whispered to him then&mdash;and whispered
to him now&mdash;that Peter God was not Peter God's right name, and
that to Josephine McCloud and her father he was a brother and a son.
This thought, so long as he could think it without a doubt, filled his
cup of hope to overflowing. But the doubt persisted. It was like a
spark that refused to go out. Who was Peter God? What was Peter God,
the half-wild fox-hunter, to Josephine McCloud? Yes&mdash;he could be
but that one thing! A brother. A black sheep. A wanderer. A son who had
disappeared&mdash;and was now found. But if he was that, only that, why
would they not tell him? The doubt sputtered up again.</p>

<p>Philip did not go to bed. He was anxious for the day, and the
evening that was to follow. A woman had unsettled his world. His mica
mountain became an unimportant reality. Barrow's greatness no longer
loomed up for him. He walked until he was tired, and it was dawn when
he went to his hotel. He was like a boy living in the anticipation of a
great promise&mdash;restless, excited, even feverishly anxious all day.
He made inquiries about Colonel James McCloud at his hotel. No one knew
him, or had even heard of him. His name was not in the city directory
or the telephone directory. Philip made up his mind that Josephine and
her father were practically strangers in the city, and that they had
come from Canada&mdash;probably Montreal, for he remembered the stamp
on the box of cigars.</p>

<p>That night, when he saw Josephine again, he wanted to reach out his
arms to her. He wanted to make her understand how completely his
wonderful love possessed him, and how utterly lost he was without her.
She was dressed in simple white&mdash;again with that bank of filmy
lace at her throat. Her hair was done in those lustrous, shimmering
coils, so bright and soft that he would have given a tenth of his mica
mountain to touch them with his hands. And she was glad to see him. Her
eagerness shone in her eyes, in the warm flush of her cheeks, in the
joyous tremble of her voice.</p>

<p>That night, too, passed like a dream&mdash;a dream in paradise for
Philip. For a long time they sat alone, and Josephine herself brought
him the box of cigars, and urged him to smoke. They talked again about
the North, about Fort MacPherson&mdash;where it was, what it was, and
how one got to it through a thousand miles or so of wilderness. He told
her of his own adventures, how for many years he had sought for mineral
treasure and at last had found a mica mountain.</p>

<p>"It's close to Fort MacPherson," he explained.</p>

<p>"We can work it from the Mackenzie. I expect to start back some time
in August."</p>

<p>She leaned toward him, last night's strange excitement glowing for
the first time in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You are going back? You will see Peter God?"</p>

<p>In her eagerness she laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"I am going back. It would be possible to see Peter God."</p>

<p>The touch of her hand did not lighten the weight that was tugging
again at his heart.</p>

<p>"Peter God's cabin is a hundred miles from Fort MacPherson," he
added. "He will be hunting foxes by the time I get there."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;it will be winter."</p>

<p>"Yes. It is a long journey. And"&mdash;he was looking at her closely
as he spoke&mdash;"Peter God may not be there when I return. It is
possible he may have gone into another part of the wilderness."</p>

<p>He saw her quiver as she drew back.</p>

<p>"He has been there&mdash;for seven&mdash;years," she said, as if
speaking to herself. "He would not move&mdash;now!"</p>

<p>"No; I don't think he would move now."</p>

<p>His own voice was low, scarcely above a whisper, and she looked at
him quickly and strangely, a flush in her cheeks.</p>

<p>It was late when he bade her good-night. Again he felt the warm
thrill of her hand as it lay in his. The next afternoon he was to take
her driving.</p>

<p>The days and weeks that followed these first meetings with Josephine
McCloud were weighted with many things for Philip. Neither she nor her
father enlightened him about Peter God. Several times he believed that
Josephine was on the point of confiding in him, but each time there
came that strange fear in her eyes, and she caught herself.</p>

<p>Philip did not urge. He asked no questions that might be
embarrassing. He knew, after the third week had passed, that Josephine
could no longer be unconscious of his love, even though the mystery of
Peter God restrained him from making a declaration of it. There was not
a day in the week that they did not see each other. They rode together.
The three frequently dined together. And still more frequently they
passed the evenings in the McCloud apartments. Philip had been correct
in his guess&mdash;they were from Montreal. Beyond that fact he learned
little.</p>

<p>As their acquaintance became closer and as Josephine saw in Philip
more and more of that something which he had not spoken, a change
developed in her. At first it puzzled and then alarmed him. At times
she seemed almost frightened. One evening, when his love all but
trembled on his lips, she turned suddenly white.</p>

<p>It was the middle of July before the words came from him at last. In
two or three weeks he was starting for the North. It was evening, and
they were alone in the big room, with the cool breeze from the lake
drifting in upon them. He made no effort to touch her as he told her of
his love, but when he had done, she knew that a strong man had laid his
heart and his soul at her feet.</p>

<p>He had never seen her whiter. Her hands were clasped tightly in her
lap. There was a silence in which he did not breathe. Her answer came
so low that he leaned forward to hear.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she said. "It is my fault&mdash;that you love me. I
knew. And yet I let you come again and again. I have done wrong. It is
not fair&mdash;now&mdash;for me to tell you to go&mdash;without a
chance. You&mdash;would want me if I did not love you? You would marry
me if I did not love you?"</p>

<p>His heart pounded. He forgot everything but that he loved this woman
with a love beyond his power to reason.</p>

<p>"I don't think that I could live without you now, Josephine," he
cried in a low voice. "And I swear to make you love me. It must come.
It is inconceivable that I cannot make you love me&mdash;loving you as
I do."</p>

<p>She looked at him clearly now. She seemed suddenly to become tense
and vibrant with a new and wonderful strength.</p>

<p>"I must be fair with you," she said. "You are a man whose love most
women would be proud to possess. And yet&mdash;it is not in my power to
accept that love, or give myself to you. There is another to whom you
must go."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peter God!"</p>

<p>It was she who leaned forward now, her eyes burning, her bosom
rising and falling with the quickness of her breath.</p>

<p>"You must go to Peter God," she said. "You must take a letter to
him&mdash;from me. And it will be for him&mdash;for Peter God&mdash;to
say whether I am to be your wife. You are honorable. You will be fair
with me. You will take the letter to him. And I will be fair with you.
I will be your wife, I will try hard to care for you&mdash;if Peter
God&mdash;says&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice broke. She covered her face, and for a moment, too stunned
to speak, Philip looked at her while her slender form trembled with
sobs. She had bowed her head, and for the first time he reached out and
laid his hand upon the soft glory of her hair. Its touch set aflame
every fiber in him. Hope swept through him, crushing his fears like a
juggernaut. It would be a simple task to go to Peter God! He was
tempted to take her in his arms. A moment more, and he would have
caught her to him, but the weight of his hand on her head roused her,
and she raised her face, and drew back. His arms were reaching out. She
saw what was in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Not now," she said. "Not until you have gone to him. Nothing in the
world will be too great a reward for you if you are fair with me, for
you are taking a chance. In the end you may receive nothing. For if
Peter God says that I cannot be your wife, I cannot. He must be the
arbiter. On those conditions, will you go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will go," said Philip.</p>

<p>It was early in August when Philip reached Edmonton. From there he
took the new line of rail to Athabasca Landing; it was September when
he arrived at Fort McMurray and found Pierre Gravois, a half-breed, who
was to accompany him by canoe up to Fort MacPherson. Before leaving
this final outpost, whence the real journey into the North began,
Philip sent a long letter to Josephine.</p>

<p>Two days after he and Pierre had started down the Mackenzie, a
letter came to Fort McMurray for Philip. "Long" La Brie, a special
messenger, brought it from Athabasca Landing. He was too late, and he
had no instructions&mdash;and had not been paid&mdash;to go
farther.</p>

<p>Day after day Philip continued steadily northward. He carried
Josephine's letter to Peter God in his breast pocket, securely tied in
a little waterproof bag. It was a thick letter, and time and again he
held it in his hand, and wondered why it was that Josephine could have
so much to say to the lonely fox-hunter up on the edge of the
Barren.</p>

<p>One night, as he sat alone by their fire in the chill of September
darkness, he took the letter from its sack and saw that the contents of
the bulging envelope had sprung one end of the flap loose. Before he
went to bed Pierre had set a pail of water on the coals. A cloud of
steam was rising from it. Those two things&mdash;the steam and the
loosened flap&mdash;sent a thrill through Philip. What was in the
letter? What had Josephine McCloud written to Peter God?</p>

<p>He looked toward sleeping Pierre; the pail of water began to bubble
and sing&mdash;he drew a tense breath, and rose to his feet. In thirty
seconds the steam rising from the pail would free the rest of the flap.
He could read the letter, and reseal it.</p>

<p>And then, like a shock, came the thought of the few notes Josephine
had written to him. On each of them she had never failed to stamp her
seal in a lavender-colored wax. He had observed that Colonel McCloud
always used a seal, in bright red. On this letter to Peter God there
was no seal! She trusted him. Her faith was implicit. And this was her
proof of it. Under his breath he laughed, and his heart grew warm with
new happiness and hope. "I have faith in you," she had said, at
parting; and now, again, out of the letter her voice seemed to whisper
to him, "I have faith in you."</p>

<p>He replaced the letter in its sack, and crawled between his blankets
close to Pierre.</p>

<p>That night had seen the beginning of his struggle with himself. This
year, autumn and winter came early in the North country. It was to be a
winter of terrible cold, of deep snow, of famine and
pestilence&mdash;the winter of 1910. The first oppressive gloom of it
added to the fear and suspense that began to grow in Philip.</p>

<p>For days there was no sign of the sun. The clouds hung low. Bitter
winds came out of the North, and nights these winds wailed desolately
through the tops of the spruce under which they slept. And day after
day and night after night the temptation came upon him more strongly to
open the letter he was carrying to Peter God.</p>

<p>He was convinced now that the letter&mdash;and the letter
alone&mdash;held his fate, and that he was acting blindly. Was this
justice to himself? He wanted Josephine. He wanted her above all else
in the world. Then why should he not fight for her&mdash;in his own
way? And to do that he must read the letter. To know its contents would
mean&mdash;Josephine. If there was nothing in it that would stand
between them, he would have done no wrong, for he would still take it
on to Peter God. So he argued. But if the letter jeopardized his
chances of possessing her, his knowledge of what it contained would
give him an opportunity to win in another way. He could even answer it
himself and take back to her false word from Peter God, for seven
frost-biting years along the edge of the Barren had surely changed
Peter God's handwriting. His treachery, if it could be called that,
would never be discovered. And it would give him Josephine.</p>

<p>This was the temptation. The power that resisted it was the spirit
of that big, clean, fighting North which makes men out of a beginning
of flesh and bone. Ten years of that North had seeped into Philip's
being. He hung on. It was November when he reached Port MacPherson, and
he had not opened the letter.</p>

<p>Deep snows fell, and fierce blizzards shot like gunblasts from out
of the Arctic. Snow and wind were not what brought the deeper gloom and
fear to Fort MacPherson. La mort rouge, smallpox,&mdash;the "red
death,"&mdash;was galloping through the wilderness. Rumors were first
verified by facts from the Dog Eib Indians. A quarter of them were down
with the scourge of the Northland. From Hudson's Bay on the east to the
Great Bear on the west, the fur posts were sending out their runners,
and a hundred Paul Reveres of the forests were riding swiftly behind
their dogs to spread the warning. On the afternoon of the day Philip
left for the cabin of Peter God, a patrol of the Royal Mounted came in
on snowshoes from the South, and voluntarily went into quarantine.</p>

<p>Philip traveled slowly. For three days and nights the air was filled
with the "Arctic dust" snow that was hard as flint and stung like shot;
and it was so cold that he paused frequently and built small fires,
over which he filled his lungs with hot air and smoke. He knew what it
meant to have the lungs "touched"&mdash;sloughing away in the spring,
blood-spitting, and certain death.</p>

<p>On the fourth day the temperature began to rise; the fifth it was
clear, and thirty degrees warmer. His thermometer had gone to sixty
below zero. It was now thirty below.</p>

<p>It was the morning of the sixth day when he reached the thick fringe
of stunted spruce that sheltered Peter God's cabin. He was half
blinded. The snow-filled blizzards cut his face until it was swollen
and purple. Twenty paces from Peter God's cabin he stopped, and stared,
and rubbed his eyes&mdash;and rubbed them again&mdash;as though not
quite sure his vision was not playing him a trick.</p>

<p>A cry broke from his lips then. Over Peter God's door there was
nailed a slender sapling, and at the end of that sapling there floated
a tattered, windbeaten red rag. It was the signal. It was the one voice
common to all the wilderness&mdash;a warning to man, woman and child,
white or red, that had come down through the centuries. Peter God was
down with the smallpox!</p>

<p>For a few moments the discovery stunned him. Then he was filled with
a chill, creeping horror. Peter God was sick with the scourge. Perhaps
he was dying. It might be&mdash;that he was dead. In spite of the
terror of the thing ahead of him, he thought of Josephine. If Peter God
was dead&mdash;</p>

<p>Above the low moaning of the wind in the spruce tops he cursed
himself. He had thought a crime, and he clenched his mittened hands as
he stared at the one window of the cabin. His eyes shifted upward. In
the air was a filmy, floating gray. It was smoke coming from the
chimney. Peter God was not dead.</p>

<p>Something kept him from shouting Peter God's name, that the trapper
might come to the door. He went to the window, and looked in. For a few
moments he could see nothing. And then, dimly, he made out the cot
against the wall. And Peter God sat on the cot, hunched forward, his
head in his hands. With a quick breath Philip turned to the door,
opened it, and entered the cabin. Peter God staggered to his feet as
the door opened. His eyes were wild and filled with fever.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;Curtis!" he cried huskily. "My God, didn't you see the
flag?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Philip's half-frozen features were smiling, and now he was holding
out a hand from which he had drawn his mitten.</p>

<p>"Lucky I happened along just now, old man. You've got it, eh?"</p>

<p>Peter God shrank back from the other's outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"There's time," he cried, pointing to the door.</p>

<p>"Don't breathe this air. Get out. I'm not bad yet&mdash;but it's
smallpox, Curtis!"</p>

<p>"I know it," said Philip, beginning to throw off his hood and coat.
"I'm not afraid of it. I had a touch of it three years ago over on the
Gray Buzzard, so I guess I'm immune. Besides, I've come two thousand
miles to see you, Peter God&mdash;two thousand miles to bring you a
letter from Josephine McCloud."</p>

<p>For ten seconds Peter God stood tense and motionless. Then he swayed
forward.</p>

<p>"A letter&mdash;for Peter God&mdash;from Josephine McCloud?" he
gasped, and held out his hands.</p>

<p>An hour later they sat facing each other&mdash;Peter God and Curtis.
The beginning of the scourge betrayed itself in the red flush of Peter
God's face, and the fever in his eyes. But he was calm. For many
minutes he had spoken in a quiet, even voice, and Philip Curtis sat
with scarcely a breath and a heart that at times had risen in his
throat to choke him. In his hand Peter God held the pages of the letter
he had read.</p>

<p>Now he went on:</p>

<p>"So I'm going to tell it all to you, Curtis&mdash;because I know
that you are a man. Josephine has left nothing out. She has told me of
your love, and of the reward she has promised you&mdash;if Peter God
sends back a certain word. She says frankly that she does not love you,
but that she honors you above all men&mdash;except her father, and one
other. That other, Curtis, is myself. Years ago the woman you
love&mdash;was my wife."</p>

<p>Peter God put a hand to his head, as if to cool the fire that was
beginning to burn him up.</p>

<p>"Her name wasn't Mrs. Peter God," he went on, and a smile fought
grimly on his lips. "That's the one thing I won't tell you,
Curtis&mdash;my name. The story itself will be enough.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there were two other people in the world happier than we. I
doubt it. I got into politics. I made an enemy, a deadly enemy. He was
a blackmailer, a thief, the head of a political ring that lived on
graft. Through my efforts he was exposed, And then he laid for
me&mdash;and he got me.</p>

<p>"I must give him credit for doing it cleverly and completely. He set
a trap for me, and a woman helped him. I won't go into details. The
trap sprung, and it caught me. Even Josephine could not be made to
believe in my innocence; so cleverly was the trap set that my best
friends among the newspapers could find no excuse for me.</p>

<p>"I have never blamed Josephine for what she did after that. To all
the world, and most of all to her, I was caught red-handed. I knew that
she loved me even as she was divorcing me. On the day the divorce was
given to her, my brain went bad. The world turned red, and then black,
and then red again. And I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peter God paused again, with a hand to his head.</p>

<p>"You came up here," said Philip, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;until I had seen the man who ruined me," replied Peter
God quietly. "We were alone in his office. I gave him a fair chance to
redeem himself&mdash;to confess what he had done. He laughed at me,
exulted over my fall, taunted me. And so&mdash;I killed him."</p>

<p>He rose from his chair and stood swaying. He was not excited.</p>

<p>"In his office, with his dead body at my feet, I wrote a note to
Josephine," he finished. "I told her what I had done, and again I swore
my innocence. I wrote her that some day she might hear from me, but not
under my right name, as the law would always be watching for me. It was
ironic that on that human cobra's desk there lay an open Bible, open at
the Book of Peter, and involuntarily I wrote the words to
Josephine&mdash;PETER GOD. She has kept my secret, while the law has
hunted for me. And this&mdash;"</p>

<p>He held the pages of the letter out to Philip.</p>

<p>"Take the letter&mdash;go outside&mdash;and read what she has
written," he said. "Come back in half an hour. I want to think."</p>

<p>Back of the cabin, where Peter God had piled his winter's fuel,
Philip read the letter; and at times the soul within him seemed
smothered, and at times it quivered with a strange and joyous
emotion.</p>

<p>At last vindication had come for Peter God, and before he had read a
page of the letter Philip understood why it was that Josephine had sent
him with it into the North. For nearly seven years she had known of
Peter God's innocence of the thing for which she had divorced him. The
woman&mdash;the dead man's accomplice&mdash;had told her the whole
story, as Peter God a few minutes before had told it to Curtis; and
during those seven years she had traveled the world seeking for
him&mdash;the man who bore the name of Peter God.</p>

<p>Each night she had prayed God that the next day she might find him,
and now that her prayer had been answered, she begged that she might
come to him, and share with him for all time a life away from the world
they knew.</p>

<p>The woman breathed like life in the pages Philip read; yet with that
wonderful message to Peter God she pilloried herself for those red and
insane hours in which she had lost faith in him. She had no excuse for
herself, except her great love; she crucified herself, even as she held
out her arms to him across that thousand miles of desolation. Frankly
she had written of the great price she was offering for this one chance
of life and happiness. She told of Philip's love, and of the reward she
had offered him should Peter God find that in his heart love had died
for her. Which should it be?</p>

<p>Twice Philip read that wonderful message he had brought into the
North, and he envied Peter God the outlaw.</p>

<p>The thirty minutes were gone when he entered the cabin. Peter God
was waiting for him. He motioned him to a seat close to him.</p>

<p>"You have read it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Philip nodded. In these moments he did not trust himself to speak.
Peter God understood. The flush was deeper in his face; his eyes burned
brighter with the fever; but of the two he was the calmer, and his
voice was steady.</p>

<p>"I haven't much time, Curtis," he said, and he smiled faintly as he
folded the pages of the letter, "My head is cracking. But I've thought
it all out, and you've got to go back to her&mdash;and tell her that
Peter God is dead."</p>

<p>A gasp broke from Philip's lips. It was his only answer.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;best," continued Peter God, and he spoke more slowly,
but firmly. "I love her, Curtis. God knows that it's been only my
dreams of her that have kept me alive all these years. She wants to
come to me, but it's impossible. I'm an outlaw. The law won't excuse my
killing of the cobra. We'd have to hide. All our lives we'd have to
hide. And&mdash;some day&mdash;they might get me. There's just one
thing to do. Go back to her. Tell her Peter God is dead. And&mdash;make
her happy&mdash;if you can."</p>

<p>For the first time something rose and overwhelmed the love in
Philip's breast.</p>

<p>"She wants to come to you," he cried, and he leaned toward Peter
God, white-faced, clenching his hands. "She wants to come!" he
repeated. "And the law won't find you. It's been seven years&mdash;and
God knows no word will ever go from me. It won't find you. And if it
should, you can fight it together, you and Josephine."</p>

<p>Peter God held out his hands.</p>

<p>"Now I know I need have no fear in sending you back," he said
huskily. "You're a man. And you've got to go. She can't come to me,
Curtis. It would kill her&mdash;this life. Think of a winter
here&mdash;madness&mdash;the yapping of the foxes&mdash;"</p>

<p>He put a hand to his head, and swayed.</p>

<p>"You've got to go. Tell her Peter God is dead&mdash;"</p>

<p>Philip sprang forward as Peter God crumpled down on his bunk.</p>

<p>After that came the long dark hours of fever and delirium. They
crawled along into days, and day and night Philip fought to keep life
in the body of the man who had given the world to him, for as the fight
continued he began more and more to accept Josephine as his own. He had
come fairly. He had kept his pledge. And Peter God had spoken.</p>

<p>"You must go. You must tell her Peter God is dead."</p>

<p>And Philip began to accept this, not altogether as his joy, but as
his duty. He could not argue with Peter God when he rose from his sick
bed. He would go back to Josephine.</p>

<p>For many days he and Peter God fought with the "red death" in the
little cabin. It was a fight which he could never forget. One
afternoon&mdash;to strengthen himself for the terrible night that was
coming&mdash;he walked several miles back into the stunted spruce on
his snowshoes. It was mid-afternoon when he returned with a haunch of
caribou meat on his shoulder. Three hundred yards from the cabin
something stopped him like a shot. He listened. From ahead of him came
the whining and snarling of dogs, the crack of a whip, a shout which he
could not understand. He dropped his burden of meat and sped on. At the
southward edge of a level open he stopped again. Straight ahead of him
was the cabin. A hundred yards to the right of him was a dog team and a
driver. Between the team and the cabin a hooded and coated figure was
running in the direction of the danger signal on the sapling pole.</p>

<p>With a cry of warning Philip darted in pursuit. He overtook the
figure at the cabin door. His hand caught it by the arm. It
turned&mdash;and he stared into the white, terror-stricken face of
Josephine McCloud!</p>

<p>"Good God!" he cried, and that was all.</p>

<p>She gripped him with both hands. He had never heard her voice as it
was now. She answered the amazement and horror in his face.</p>

<p>"I sent you a letter," she cried pantingly, "and it didn't overtake
you. As soon as you were gone, I knew that I must come&mdash;that I
must follow&mdash;that I must speak with my own lips what I had
written. I tried to catch you. But you traveled faster. Will you
forgive me&mdash;you will forgive me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned to the door. He held her.</p>

<p>"It is the smallpox," he said, and his voice was dead.</p>

<p>"I know," she panted. "The man over there&mdash;told me what the
little flag means. And I'm glad&mdash;glad I came in time to go in to
him&mdash;as he is. And you&mdash;you&mdash;must forgive!"</p>

<p>She snatched herself free from his grasp. The door opened. It closed
behind her. A moment later he heard through the sapling door a strange
cry&mdash;a woman's cry&mdash;a man's cry&mdash;and he turned and
walked heavily back into the spruce forest.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_14">THE MOUSE</a></h3>

<p>"Why, you ornery little cuss," said Falkner, pausing with a forkful
of beans half way to his mouth. "Where in God A'mighty's name did YOU
come from?"</p>

<p>It was against all of Jim's crude but honest ethics of the big
wilderness to take the Lord's name in vain, and the words he uttered
were filled more with the softness of a prayer than the harshness of
profanity. He was big, and his hands were hard and knotted, and his
face was covered with a coarse red scrub of beard. But his hair was
blond, and his eyes were blue, and just now they were filled with
unbounded amazement. Slowly the fork loaded with beans descended to his
plate, and he said again, barely above a whisper:</p>

<p>"Where in God A'mighty's name DID you come from?"</p>

<p>There was nothing human in the one room of his wilderness cabin to
speak of. At the first glance there was nothing alive in the room, with
the exception of Jim Falkner himself. There was not even a dog, for Jim
had lost his one dog weeks before. And yet he spoke, and his eyes
glistened, and for a full minute after that he sat as motionless as a
rock. Then something moved&mdash;at the farther end of the rough board
table. It was a mouse&mdash;a soft, brown, bright-eyed little mouse,
not as large as his thumb. It was not like the mice Jim had been
accustomed to see in the North woods, the larger, sharp-nosed, rat-like
creatures which sprung his traps now and then, and he gave a sort of
gasp through his beard.</p>

<p>"I'm as crazy as a loon if it isn't a sure-enough down-home mouse,
just like we used to catch in the kitchen down in Ohio," he told
himself. And for the third time he asked. "Now where in God A'mighty's
name DID YOU come from?"</p>

<p>The mouse made no answer. It had humped itself up into a little
ball, and was eyeing Jim with the keenest of suspicion.</p>

<p>"You're a thousand miles from home, old man," Falkner addressed it,
still without a movement. "You're a clean thousand miles straight north
of the kind o' civilization you was born in, and I want to know how you
got here. By George&mdash;is it possible&mdash;you got mixed up in that
box of stuff SHE sent up? Did you come from HER?"</p>

<p>He made a sudden movement, as if he expected an answer, and in a
flash the mouse had scurried off the table and had disappeared under
his bunk.</p>

<p>"The little cuss!" said Falkner. "He's sure got his nerve!"</p>

<p>He went on eating his beans, and when he had done he lighted a lamp,
for the half Arctic darkness was falling early, and began to clear away
the dishes. When he had done he put a scrap of bannock and a few beans
on the corner of the table.</p>

<p>"I'll bet he's hungry, the little cuss," he said. "A thousand
miles&mdash;in that box!"</p>

<p>He sat down close to the sheet-iron box stove, which was glowing
red-hot, and filled his pipe. Kerosene was a precious commodity, and he
had turned down the lamp wick until he was mostly in gloom. Outside a
storm was wailing down across the Barrens from the North. He could hear
the swish of the spruce-boughs overhead, and those moaning,
half-shrieking sounds that always came with storm from out of the
North, and sometimes fooled even him into thinking they were human
cries. They had seemed more and more human to him during the past three
days, and he was growing afraid. Once or twice strange thoughts had
come into his head, and he had tried to fight them down. He had known
of men whom loneliness had driven mad&mdash;and he was terribly lonely.
He shivered as a piercing blast of wind filled with a mourning wail
swept over the cabin.</p>

<p>And that day, too, he had been taken with a touch of fever. It
burned more hotly in his blood to-night, and he knew that it was the
loneliness&mdash;the emptiness of the world about him, the despair and
black foreboding that came to him with the first early twilights of the
Long Night. For he was in the edge of that Long Night. For weeks he
would only now and then catch a glimpse of the sun. He shuddered.</p>

<p>A hundred and fifty miles to the south and east there was a Hudson's
Bay post. Eighty miles south was the nearest trapper's cabin he knew
of. Two months before he had gone down to the post, with a thick beard
to cover his face, and had brought back supplies&mdash;and the box. His
wife had sent up the box to him, only it had come to him as "John
Blake" instead of Jim Falkner, his right name. There were things in it
for him to wear, and pictures of the sweet-faced wife who was still
filled with prayer and hope for him, and of the kid, their boy. "He is
walking now," she had written to him, "and a dozen times a day he goes
to your picture and says 'Pa-pa&mdash;Pa-pa'&mdash;and every night we
talk about you before we go to bed, and pray God to send you back to us
soon."</p>

<p>"God bless 'em!" breathed Jim.</p>

<p>He had not lighted his pipe, and there was something in his eyes
that shimmered and glistened in the dull light. And then, as he sat
silent, his eyes clearing, he saw that the little mouse had climbed
back to the edge of the table. It did not eat the food he had placed
there for it, but humped itself up in a tiny ball again, and its tiny
shining eyes looked in his direction.</p>

<p>"You're not hungry," said Jim, and he spoke aloud. "YOU'RE lonely,
too&mdash;that's it!"</p>

<p>A strange thrill shot through him at the thought, and he wondered
again if he was mad at the longing that filled him&mdash;the desire to
reach out and snuggle the little creature in his hand, and hold it
close up to his bearded face, and TALK TO IT! He laughed, and drew his
stool a little more into the light. The mouse did not run. He edged
nearer and nearer, until his elbows rested on the table, and a curious
feeling of pleasure took the place of his loneliness when he saw that
the mouse was looking at him, and yet seemed unafraid.</p>

<p>"Don't be scairt," he said softly, speaking directly to it. "I won't
hurt you. No, siree, I'd&mdash;I'd cut off a hand before I'd do that. I
ain't had any company but you for two months. I ain't seen a human
face, or heard a human voice&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing but them
shrieks 'n' wails 'n' baby-cryings out there in the wind. I won't hurt
you&mdash;" His voice was almost pleading in its gentleness. And for
the tenth time that day he felt, with his fever, a sickening dizziness
in his head. For a moment or two his vision was blurred, but he could
still see the mouse&mdash;farther away, it seemed to him.</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose you've killed anyone&mdash;or anything," he said,
and his voice seemed thick and distant to him. "Mice don't kill, do
they? They live on&mdash;cheese. But I have&mdash;I've killed. I killed
a man. That's why I'm here."</p>

<p>His dizziness almost overcame him, and he leaned heavily against the
table. Still the little mouse did not move. Still he could see it
through the strange gauze veil before his eyes.</p>

<p>"I killed&mdash;a man," he repeated, and now he was wondering why
the mouse did not say something at that remarkable confession. "I
killed him, old man, an' you'd have done the same if you'd been in my
place. I didn't mean to. I struck too hard. But I found 'im in my
cabin, an' SHE was fighting&mdash;fighting him until her face was
scratched an' her clothes torn,&mdash;God bless her dear
heart!&mdash;fighting him to the last breath, an' I come just in time!
He didn't think I'd be back for a day&mdash;a black-hearted devil we'd
fed when he came to our door hungry. I killed him. And they've hunted
me ever since. They'll put a rope round my neck, an' choke me to death
if they catch me&mdash;because I came in time to save her! That's
law!</p>

<p>"But they won't find me. I've been up here a year now, and in the
spring I'm going down there &mdash;where you come from&mdash;back to
the Girl and the Kid. The policemen won't be looking for me then. An'
we're going to some other part of the world, an' live happy. She's
waitin' for me, she an' the kid, an' they know I'm coming in the
spring. Yessir, I killed a man. An' they want to kill me for it. That's
the law&mdash;Canadian law&mdash;the law that wants an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth, an' where there ain't no extenuatin'
circumstance. They call it murder. But it wasn't&mdash;was it?"</p>

<p>He waited for an answer. The mouse seemed going farther and farther
away from him. He leaned more heavily on the table.</p>

<p>"It wasn't&mdash;was it?" he persisted.</p>

<p>His arms reached out; his head dropped forward, and the little mouse
scurried to the floor. But Falkner did not know that it had gone.</p>

<p>"I killed him, an' I guess I'd do it again," he said, and his words
were only a whisper. "An' to-night they're prayin' for me down
there&mdash;she 'n the kid&mdash;an' he's sayin', 'Pa-pa&mdash;Pa-pa';
an' they sent you up&mdash;to keep me comp'ny&mdash;"</p>

<p>His head dropped wearily upon his arms. The red stove crackled, and
turned slowly black. In the cabin it grew darker, except where the dim
light burned on the table. Outside the storm wailed and screeched down
across the Barren. And after a time the mouse came back. It looked at
Jim Falkner. It came nearer, until it touched the unconscious man's
sleeve. More daringly it ran over his arm. It smelled of his
fingers.</p>

<p>Then the mouse returned to the corner of the table, and began eating
the food that Falkner had placed there for it.</p>

<p>The wick of the lamp had burned low when Falkner raised his head.
The stove was black and cold. Outside, the storm still raged, and it
was the shivering shriek of it over the cabin that Falkner first heard.
He felt terribly dizzy, and there was a sharp, knife-like pain just
back of his eyes. By the gray light that came through the one window he
knew that what was left of Arctic day had come. He rose to his feet,
and staggered about like a drunken man as he rebuilt the fire, and he
tried to laugh as the truth dawned upon him that he had been sick, and
that he had rested for hours with his head on the table. His back
seemed broken. His legs were numb, and hurt when he stepped on them. He
swung his arms a little to bring back circulation, and rubbed his hands
over the fire that began to crackle in the stove.</p>

<p>It was the sickness that had overcome him&mdash;he knew that. But
the thought of it did not appall him as it had yesterday, and the day
before. There seemed to be something in the cabin now that comforted
and soothed him, something that took away a part of the loneliness that
was driving him mad. Even as he searched about him, peering into the
dark corners and at the bare walls, a word formed on his lips, and he
half smiled. It was a woman's name&mdash;Hester. And a warmth entered
into him. The pain left his head. For the first time in weeks he felt
DIFFERENT. And slowly he began to realize what had wrought the change.
He was not alone. A message had come to him from the one who was
waiting for him miles away; something that lived, and breathed, and was
as lonely as himself. It was the little mouse.</p>

<p>He looked about eagerly, his eyes brightening, but the mouse was
gone. He could not hear it. There seemed nothing unusual to him in the
words he spoke aloud to himself.</p>

<p>"I'm going to call it after the Kid," he chuckled, "I'm goin' to
call it Little Jim. I wonder if it's a girl mouse&mdash;or a boy
mouse?"</p>

<p>He placed a pan of snow-water on the stove and began making his
simple preparations for breakfast. For the first time in many days he
felt actually hungry. And then all at once he stopped, and a low cry
that was half joy and half wonder broke from his lips. With tensely
gripped hands and eyes that shone with a strange light he stared
straight at the blank surface of the log wall&mdash;through
it&mdash;and a thousand miles away. He remembered THAT day&mdash;years
ago&mdash;the scenes of which came to him now as though they had been
but yesterday. It was afternoon, in the glorious summer, and he had
gone to Hester's home. Only the day before Hester had promised to be
his wife, and he remembered how fidgety and uneasy and yet wondrously
happy he was as he sat out on the big white veranda, waiting for her to
put on her pink muslin dress, which went go well with the gold of her
hair and the blue of her eyes. And as he sat there, Hester's maltese
pet came up the steps, bringing in its jaws a tiny, quivering brown
mouse. It was playing with the almost lifeless little creature when
Hester came through the door.</p>

<p>He heard again the low cry that came from her lips then. In an
instant she had snatched the tiny, limp thing from between the cat's
paws, and had faced him. He was laughing at her, but the glow in her
blue eyes sobered him. "I didn't think you&mdash;would take pleasure in
that, Jim," she said. "It's only a mouse, but it's alive, and I can
feel its poor little heart beating!"</p>

<p>They had saved it, and he, a little ashamed at the smallness of the
act, had gone with Hester to the barn and made a nest for it in the
hay. But the wonderful words that he remembered were these: "Perhaps
some day a little mouse will help you, Jim!" Hester had spoken
laughingly. And her words had come true!</p>

<p>All the time that Falkner was preparing and eating his breakfast he
watched for the mouse, but it did not appear. Then he went to the door.
It swung outward, and it took all his weight to force it open. On one
side of the cabin the snow was drifted almost to the roof. Ahead of him
he could barely make out the dark shadow of the scrub spruce forest
beyond the little clearing he had made. He could hear the spruce-tops
wailing and twisting in the storm, and the snow and wind stung his
face, and half blinded him.</p>

<p>It was dark&mdash;dark with that gray and maddening gloom that
yesterday would have driven him still nearer to the merge of madness.
But this morning he laughed as he listened to the wailings in the air
and stared out into the ghostly chaos. It was not the thought of his
loneliness that come to him now, but the thought that he was safe. The
Law could not reach him now, even if it knew where he was. And before
it began its hunt for him again in the spring he would be hiking
southward, to the Girl and the Baby, and it would still be hunting for
him when they three would be making a new home for themselves in some
other part of the world. For the first time in months he was almost
happy. He closed and bolted the door, and began to WHISTLE. He was
amazed at the change in himself, and wonderingly he stared at his
reflection in the cracked bit of mirror against the wall. He grinned,
and addressed himself aloud.</p>

<p>"You need a shave," he told himself. "You'd scare fits out of
anything alive! Now that we've got company we've got to spruce up, an'
look civilized."</p>

<p>It took him an hour to get rid of his heavy beard. His face looked
almost boyish again. He was inspecting himself in the mirror when he
heard a sound that turned him slowly toward the table. The little mouse
was nosing about his tin plate. For a few moments Falkner watched it,
fearing to move. Then he cautiously began to approach the table. "Hello
there, old chap," he said, trying to make his voice soft and
ingratiating. "Pretty late for breakfast, ain't you?"</p>

<p>At his approach the mouse humped itself into a motionless ball and
watched him. To Falkner's delight it did not run away when he reached
the table and sat down. He laughed softly.</p>

<p>"You ain't afraid, are you?" he asked. "We're goin' to be chums,
ain't we? Yessir, we're goin' to be chums!"</p>

<p>For a full minute the mouse and the man looked steadily at each
other. Then the mouse moved deliberately to a crumb of bannock and
began nibbling at its breakfast.</p>

<p>For ten days there was only an occasional lull in the storm that
came from out of the North. Before those ten days were half over, Jim
and the mouse understood each other. The little mouse itself solved the
problem of their nearer acquaintance by running up Falkner's leg one
morning while he was at breakfast, and coolly investigating him from
the strings of his moccasin to the collar of his blue shirt. After that
it showed no fear of him, and a few days later would nestle in the
hollow of his big hand and nibble fearlessly at the bannock which
Falkner would offer it. Then Jim took to carrying it about with him in
his coat pocket. That seemed to suit the mouse immensely, and when Jim
went to bed nights, or it grew too warm for him in the cabin, he would
hang the coat over his bunk, with the mouse still in it, so that it was
not long before the little creature made up its mind to take full
possession of the pocket. It intimated as much to Falkner on the tenth
and last day of the storm, when it began very business-like operations
of building a nest of paper and rabbits' fur in the coat pocket. Jim's
heart gave a big and sudden jump of delight when he saw the work going
on.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, I wonder if it's a girl mouse an' we're goin' to
have BABIES!" he gasped.</p>

<p>After that he did not wear the coat, through fear of disturbing the
nest. The two became more and more friendly, until finally the mouse
would sit on Jim's shoulder at meal time, and nibble at bannock. What
little trouble the mouse caused only added to Falkner's love for
it.</p>

<p>"He's a human little cuss," he told himself one day, as he watched
the mouse busy at work caching away scraps of food, which it carried
through a crack in the sapling floor. "He's that human I've got to put
all my grab in the tin cans or we'll go short before spring!" His chief
trouble was to keep his snowshoes out of his tiny companion's reach.
The mouse had developed an unholy passion for babiche, the caribou skin
thongs used in the webs of his shoes, and one of the webs was half
eaten away before Falkner discovered what was going on. At last he was
compelled to suspend the shoes from a nail driven in one of the
roof-beams.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the stove glowed hot, and a cotton wick
sputtered in a pan of caribou grease on the table, Falkner's chief
diversion was to tell the mouse all about his plans, and hopes, and
what had happened in the past. He took an almost boyish pleasure in
these one-sided entertainments&mdash;and yet, after all, they were not
entirely one-sided, for the mouse would keep its bright,
serious-looking little eyes on Falkner's face; it seemed to understand,
if it could not talk.</p>

<p>Falkner loved to tell the little fellow of the wonderful days of
four or five years ago away down in the sunny Ohio valley where he had
courted the Girl and where they lived before they moved to the farm in
Canada. He tried to impress upon Little Jim's mind what it meant for a
great big, unhandsome fellow like himself to be loved by a tender slip
of a girl whose hair was like gold and whose eyes were as blue as the
wood-violets. One evening he fumbled for a minute under his bunk and
came back to the table with a worn and finger-marked manila envelope,
from which he drew tenderly and with almost trembling care a long,
shining tress of golden hair.</p>

<p>"That HERS," he said proudly, placing it on the table close to the
mouse. "An' she's got so much of it you can't see her to the hips when
she takes it down; an' out in the sun it shines
like&mdash;like&mdash;glory!"</p>

<p>The stove door crashed open, and a number of coals fell out upon the
floor. For a few minutes Falkner was busy, and when he returned to the
table he gave a gasp of astonishment. The curl and the mouse were gone!
Little Jim had almost reached its nest with its lovely burden when
Falkner captured it.</p>

<p>"You little cuss!" he breathed revently. "Now I know you come from
her! I know it!"</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed the storm Falkner again followed his
trap-lines, and scattered poison-baits for the white foxes on the
Barren. Early in January the second great storm of that year came from
out of the North. It gave no warning, and Falkner was caught ten miles
from camp. He was making a struggle for life before he reached the
shack. He was exhausted, and half blinded. He could hardly stand on his
feet when he staggered up against his own door. He could see nothing
when he entered. He stumbled over a stool, and fell to the floor.
Before he could rise a strange weight was upon him. He made no
resistance, for the storm had driven the last ounce of strength from
his body.</p>

<p>"It's been a long chase, but I've got you now, Falkner," he heard a
triumphant voice say. And then came the dreaded formula, feared to the
uttermost limits of the great Northern wilderness: "I warn you! You are
my prisoner, in the name of His Majesty, the King!"</p>

<p>Corporal Carr, of the Royal Mounted of the Northwest, was a man
without human sympathies. He was thin faced, with a square, bony jaw,
and lips that formed a straight line. His eyes were greenish, like a
cat's, and were constantly shifting. He was a beast of prey, as much as
the wolf, the lynx, or the fox&mdash;and his prey was men. Only such a
man as Carr, alone would have braved the treacherous snows and the
intense cold of the Arctic winter to run him down. Falkner knew that,
as an hour later he looked over the roaring stove at his captor. About
Carr there was something of the unpleasant quickness, the sinuous
movement, of the little white ermine&mdash;the outlaw of the
wilderness. His eyes were as merciless. At times Falkner caught the
same red glint in them. And above his despair, the utter hopelessness
of his situation, there rose in him an intense hatred and loathing of
the man.</p>

<p>Falkner's hands were then securely tied behind him.</p>

<p>"I'd put the irons on you," Carr had explained a hard, emotionless
voice, "only I lost them somewhere back there."</p>

<p>Beyond that he had not said a dozen words. He had built up the fire,
thawed himself out, and helped himself to food. Now, for the first
time, he loosened up a bit.</p>

<p>"I've had a devil of a chase," he said bitterly, a cold glitter in
his eyes as he looked at Falkner. "I've been after you three months,
and now that I've got you this accursed storm is going to hold me up!
And I left my dogs and outfit a mile back in the scrub."</p>

<p>"Better go after 'em," replied Falkner. "If you don't there won't be
any dogs an' outfit by morning."</p>

<p>Corporal Carr rose to his feet and went to the window. In a moment
he turned.</p>

<p>"I'll do that," he said. "Stretch yourself out on the bunk. I'll
have to lace you down pretty tight to keep you from playing a trick on
me."</p>

<p>There was something so merciless and brutal in his eyes and voice
that Falkner felt like leaping upon him, even with his hands tied
behind his back.</p>

<p>He was glad, however, that Carr had decided to go. He was, filled
with an overwhelming desire to be rid of him, if only for an hour.</p>

<p>He went to the bunk and lay down. Corporal Carr approached, pulling
a roll of babiche cord from his pocket.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind you might tie my hands in front instead of
behind," suggested Falkner. "It's goin' to be mighty unpleasant to have
'em under me, if I've got to lay here for an hour or two."</p>

<p>"Not on your life I won't tie 'em in front!" snapped Carr, his
little eyes glittering. And then he gave a cackling laugh, and his eyes
were as green as a cat's. "An' it won't be half so unpleasant as having
something 'round your NECK!" he joked.</p>

<p>"I wish I was free," breathed Falkner, his chest heaving. "I wish we
could fight, man t' man. I'd be willing to hang then, just to have the
chance to break your neck. You ain't a man of the Law. You're a
devil."</p>

<p>Carr laughed the sort of laugh that sends a chill up one's back, and
drew the caribou-skin cord tight about Falkner's ankles.</p>

<p>"Can't blame me for being a little careful," he said in his
revolting way. "By your hanging I become a Sergeant. That's my reward
for running you down."</p>

<p>He lighted the lamp and filled the stove before he left the cabin.
From the door he looked back at Falkner, and his face was not like a
man's, but like that of some terrible death-spirit, ghostly, and thin,
and exultant in the dim glow of the lamp. As he opened the door the
roar of the blizzard and a gust of snow filled the cabin. Then it
closed, and a groaning curse fell from Falkner's lips. He strained
fiercely at the thongs that bound him, but after the first few minutes
he lay still breathing hard, knowing that every effort he made only
tightened the caribou-skin cord that bound him.</p>

<p>On his back, he listened to the storm. It was filled with the same
strange cries and moaning sound that had almost driven him to madness,
and now they sent through him a shivering chill that he had not felt
before, even in the darkest and most hopeless hours of his loneliness
and despair. A breath that was almost a sob broke from his lips as a
vision of the Girl and the Kid came to shut out from his ears the
moaning tumult of the wind. A few hours before he had been filled with
hope&mdash;almost happiness, and now he was lost. From such a man as
Carr there was no hope for mercy, or of escape. Flat on his back, he
closed his eyes, and tried to think&mdash;to scheme something that
might happen in his favor, to foresee an opportunity that might give
him one last chance. And then, suddenly, he heard a sound. It traveled
over the blanket that formed a pillow for his head. A cool, soft little
nose touched his ear, and then tiny feet ran swiftly over his shoulder,
and halted on his breast. He opened his eyes, and stared.</p>

<p>"You little cuss!" he breathed. A hundred times he had spoken those
words, and each time they were of increasing wonder and adoration. "You
little cuss!" he whispered again, and he chuckled aloud.</p>

<p>The mouse was humped on his breast in that curious little ball that
it made of itself, and was eyeing him, Jim thought, in a questioning
sort of way, "What's the matter with you?" it seemed to ask. "Where are
your hands?"</p>

<p>And Jim answered:</p>

<p>"They've got me, old man. Now what the dickens are we going to
do?"</p>

<p>The mouse began investigating. It examined his shoulder, the end of
his chin, and ran along his arm, as far as it could go.</p>

<p>"Now what do you think of that!" Falkner exclaimed softly. "The
little cuss is wondering where my hands are!" Gently he rolled over on
his side.</p>

<p>"There they are," he said, "hitched tighter 'n bark to a tree!"</p>

<p>He wiggled his fingers, and in a moment he felt the mouse. The
little creature ran across the opened palm of his hand to his wrist,
and then every muscle in Falkner's body grew tense, and one of the
strangest cries that ever fell from human lips came from his. The mouse
had found once more the dried hide-flesh of which the snowshoe webs
were made. It had found babiche. And it had begun TO GNAW!</p>

<p>In the minutes that followed Falkner scarcely breathed. He could
feel the mouse when it worked. Above the stifled beating of his heart
he could hear its tiny jaws. In those moments he knew that his last
hope of life hung in the balance. Five, ten minutes passed, and not
until then did he strain at the thongs that bound his wrists. Was that
the bed that had snapped? Or was it the breaking of one of the babiche
cords? He strained harder. The thongs were loosening; his wrists were
freer; with a cry that sent the mouse scurrying to the floor he doubled
himself half erect, and fought like a madman. Five minutes later and he
was free.</p>

<p>He staggered to his feet, and looked at his wrists. They were torn
and bleeding. His second thought was of Corporal Carr&mdash;and a
weapon. The man-hunter had taken the precaution to empty the chambers
of Falkner's revolver and rifle and throw his cartridges out in the
snow. But his skinning-knife was still in its sheath and belt, and he
buckled it about his waist. He had no thought of killing Carr, though
he hated the man almost to the point of murder. But his lips set in a
grim smile as he thought of what he WOULD do.</p>

<p>He knew that when Carr returned he would not enter at once into the
cabin. He was the sort of man who would never take an unnecessary
chance. He would go first to the little window&mdash;and look in.
Falkner turned the lamp-wick lower, and placed the lamp on the table
directly between the window and the bunk. Then he rolled his blankets
into something like a human form, and went to the window to see the
effect. The bunk was in deep shadow. From the window Corporal Carr
could not see beyond the lamp. Then Falkner waited, out of range of the
window, and close to the door.</p>

<p>It was not long before he heard something above the wailing of the
storm. It was the whine of a dog, and he knew that a moment later the
Corporal's ghostly face was peering in at the window. Then there came
the sudden, swift opening of the door, and Carr sprang in like a cat,
his hand on the butt of his revolver, still obeying that first
governing law of his merciless life&mdash;caution, Falkner was so near
that he could reach out and touch Carr, and in an instant he was at his
enemy's throat. Not a cry fell from Carr's lips. There was death in the
terrible grip of Falkner's hands, and like one whose neck had been
broken Carr sank to the floor. Falkner's grip tightened, and he did not
loosen it until Carr was black in the face and his jaw fell open. Then
Falkner bound him hand and foot with the babiche thongs, and dragged
him to the bunk.</p>

<p>Through the open door one of the sledge-dogs had thrust his head and
shoulders. It was a Barracks team, accustomed to warmth and shelter,
and Falkner had no difficulty in getting the leader and his three mates
inside. To make friends with them he fed them chunks of raw caribou
meat, and when Carr opened his eyes he was busy packing. He laughed
joyously when he saw that the man-hunter had regained consciousness,
and was staring at him with evident malice.</p>

<p>"Hello, Carr," he greeted affably. "Feeling better? Tables sort of
turned, ain't they?"</p>

<p>Carr made no answer. His white lips were set like thin bands of
steel.</p>

<p>"I'm getting ready to leave you," Falkner explained, as he rolled up
a blanket and shoved it into his rubber pack-pouch. "And you're going
to stay here&mdash;until spring. Do you get onto that? You've GOT to
stay. I'm going to leave you marooned, so to speak. You couldn't travel
a hundred yards out there without snowshoes, and I'm goin' to take your
snowshoes. And I'm goin' to take your guns, and burn your pack, your
coat, mittens, cap, an' moccasins. Catch on? I'm not goin' to kill you,
and I'm going to leave you enough grub to last until spring, but you
won't dare risk yourself out in the cold and snow. If you do, you'll
freeze off your tootsies, and make your lungs sick. Don't you feel sort
of pleasant&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;devil!"</p>

<p>Six hours later Falkner stood outside the cabin. The dogs were in
their traces, and the sledge was packed. The storm had blown itself
out, and a warmer temperature had followed in the path of the blizzard.
He wore his coat now, and gently he felt of the bulging pocket, and
laughed joyously as he faced the South.</p>

<p>"It's goin' to be a long hike, you little cuss," he said softly.
"It's goin' to be a darned long hike. But we'll make it. Yessir, we'll
make it. And won't they be s'prised when we fall in on 'em, six months
ahead of time?"</p>
