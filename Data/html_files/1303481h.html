  <h2><a id="art01"
     name="art01">THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS<br>
  AND THE FEDERATION OF MANKIND</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">22.9.1923</p>

  <p class="first">I AM one of those people who believe that if human affairs
  are to go on without decay and catastrophe, there must be an end to the
  organisation of war. I believe that the power to prepare for war and make war
  must be withdrawn from separate States, as already it has been withdrawn from
  separate cities and from districts and from private individuals, and that
  ultimately there must be a Confederation of all mankind to keep one peace
  throughout the world.</p>

  <p>The United States of America is but the first instance of a federating
  process which will, I believe, extend at last to the whole world. Since 1917
  I have given much more of my waking life to that vision of a confederated
  mankind than I have given to any other single interest or subject. And yet I
  am not a supporter of the League of Nations in its present form, and I do not
  think that the League of Nations at Geneva is ever likely to develop into an
  effective World Confederation. It is much more likely to develop into a
  serious obstacle to such a Confederation. The sooner now that it is scrapped
  and broken up the better, I think, for mankind. I am hostile to the present
  League of Nations because I desire the Confederation of Mankind.</p>

  <p>I do not think that the obstructive possibilities of the existing League
  of Nations are sufficiently understood by liberal-minded people throughout
  the world. I do not think they realise how effectively it may be used as a
  consumer and waster of the creative energy that would otherwise carry us
  forward toward World Confederation.</p>

  <p>The League of Nations that we saw in our visions in those distressful and
  yet creative years, 1917-18, was to have been a real step forward in human
  affairs. It was to have been a repetition on a gigantic scale of that
  magnificent turning-point in the history of America when it was decided that
  the conferring representatives of the liberated colonies should talk no
  longer of the people of Virginia, the people of Georgia, and the people of
  Massachusetts, but instead of the people of the United States. So in a wider
  stride we were to begin to forget the particular interests of the people of
  Germany and of the people of France and of the people of England in a new
  realisation of the common needs and dangers and sacrifices of the people of
  the world. So we hoped. So we still try to hope.</p>

  <p>But that was far too wide a stride for humanity to take all at once. The
  League we desired was to have been the first loose conference that would have
  ended in a federal government for the whole earth. It was to have controlled
  war establishments from the start, constricted or abolished all private
  armament firms, created and maintained a world standard of currency, of
  labour legislation, of health and education, watched the world production of
  staple articles for the common good, restricted malignant tariff hostilities,
  negotiated and regulated the migrations of populations, and made the ways of
  the world, the high seas, and the international land routes alike open and
  safe for all decent men. So we saw it as a new, brave assertion of human
  sanity and of the right of all men to a certain fullness of life, against old
  hates, old prejudices, old debts and claims and limitations.</p>

  <p>And there seemed to some of us to be sufficient will in the world then for
  so bold and great a beginning. I wonder&mdash;empty speculation though it is
  now&mdash;if we were indeed so wrong in thinking that&mdash;if some man or
  group of men of supreme genius might not have achieved a real world peace
  even in 1919. All over the world there were millions of people, prepared by
  immense sufferings and fears for so drastic a change. There were great masses
  of people everywhere mentally ready for that League. For many months
  President Wilson, simply because he had said "League of Nations" plainly and
  clearly, was the greatest man on earth. He overshadowed Kings and
  Emperors.</p>

  <p>Most of us can still recall that false dawn, that phase of hope. When the
  first great gathering to inaugurate the English League of Nations Union met
  in Westminster, people were turned away from the dangerously packed hall, not
  by the hundred but by the thousand. But it is easier to assemble crowds of
  enthusiastic people than to give them faithful leaders and capable Ministers.
  The First Crusade might have taught us that. The new movement had no leaders
  worth considering, and into the vacuum poured all the eager stuff of the old
  order. I remember how my heart sank that day when I saw the brightest bishops
  and the best-advertised Nonconformist leaders, politicians needing a new line
  of goods, the rising Bar and the social collectors, Mrs. Asquith and her set,
  all the much-photographed and the much-talked-about, swarming up upon the
  Westminster platform, pushing well into the limelight, nodding and
  gesticulating to each other, as gay as if they were at a fashionable wedding,
  before dear Lord Grey, that dignified image of British statesmanship, read
  out the platitudes he had prepared for the occasion. The common folk of the
  earth might want a new organisation of peace in the world, but these people
  of all people I realised would never give it them.</p>

  <p>Things come not so swiftly to suffering mankind. The order has indeed gone
  forth, men know their need, but the master artisan that will fulfil it has
  still to learn his business and make his tools. Perhaps he has still to be
  born. And, meanwhile, in the light of this false dawn, a League of Nations,
  that hardly pretended even to look like what we desired, was planned in Paris
  hurriedly and cheaply, and run up at Geneva. It has provided a job for Sir
  Eric Drummond, a British Foreign Office official unknown to the generality of
  mankind, and Lord Robert Cecil, hitherto prominent chiefly as the inveterate
  enemy of unsectarian education in England, secured political resuscitation as
  its leading advocate. With the permission of France and Great Britain this
  League has negotiated one or two minor settlements that were not too deeply
  entangled in the policy of these Great Powers, and it has afforded a number
  of Spanish-American politicians agreeable, if expensive, holidays in Europe.
  And whenever one wants to talk of the Confederation of Mankind now, it gets
  in the way.</p>

  <p>We had thought that the League of Nations would abolish diplomacy. We
  found it had merely added another piece, and a very ineffective piece at
  that, to the already crowded diplomatic game upon the European board.</p>

  <p>That great Confederation of Mankind that we desire, that great peace with
  variety round and about the earth, cannot arise out of such a beginning. This
  League of Nations at Geneva is not even the germ of such a thing. Rather it
  is the instinctive effort of the old European order to stifle this creative
  idea on its birth by encysting it in a tradition of futility and diplomatic
  methods. The way to human confederation is by a longer route, and the end is
  not to be attained by any such hasty constitution as that of the League. The
  Confederation of Man is a task for generations. Tens of thousands of leaderly
  men and women must serve that idea and live and die for it before it can
  approach realisation. Millions must respond to the service of their
  leadership. The idea must become the fundamental political idea of hundreds
  of millions, ousting kings and flags from men's imaginations. Then we can
  begin to get together an effective ruling body. A stupendous task, you say,
  but not an impossible one. A day will come, I believe, when this great dream
  will be realised, when all the paraphernalia of war or of national
  sovereignty&mdash;it is the same thing&mdash;will have followed the stone
  gods and human sacrifices to limbo, and when a new phase of human experience
  will begin.</p>

  <p>So far there has been no real civilisation of the world; civilisation is
  still only an occasional incident, a passing gleam of promise in the lives of
  a handful of people here and there. But civilisation will come at last for
  all. It is about that coming of a world confederation and of the world
  civilisation it will make possible, that I shall be writing chiefly in this
  series of weekly articles. Now and then I shall diverge to other topics, but
  that will be my main theme, the realisation of civilisation. I shall consider
  scientific progress, educational and social work, political happenings, and
  the general trend of current events, and almost always I shall consider them
  in direct relation to that new age that lies before mankind. I shall write
  about the signs of the times and about typical men and women just as they
  seem to be making or marring these creative hopes. I do not expect my readers
  to agree with me always. I shall write about contentious things, and my last
  thought will be of pleasing or propitiating. At times I shall certainly
  irritate. But I hope to interest. And some few of my younger readers, at
  least, I hope to infect with that same idea of creative service for the new
  civilisation which possesses my own life.</p>

  <h2><a id="art02"
     name="art02">THE BEAUTY OF FLYING</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">29.9.1923</p>

  <p class="first">THIS last summer I had a number of aeroplane journeys about
  Europe. I had flights in several of the big omnibus aeroplanes that fly on
  the more or less regular European services, and also I flew as the single
  passenger in smaller open machines. There is a delight and wonder in the
  latter sort of flying altogether lost in the boxed-in aeroplane.</p>

  <p>International jealousies, commercial rivalries, and the meanness of
  outlook universally prevalent in Europe at the present time are muddling away
  most of the possible freedom and happiness of air travel. I flew from London
  to Amsterdam, but I had to get my money back for the rest of the journey to
  Berlin, and take a night train, because of some hitch in the German
  arrangements, and similarly the Franco-Rumanian service from Vienna via
  Prague and Strassburg to Paris, so triumphantly inaugurated a little while
  ago, was in a state of dislocation, and I had to make that journey round by
  way of Holland to avoid the inconveniences and delays due to the fooleries of
  French "policy" upon the Rhine. But I flew, when there was a machine to fly
  in and no patriotic idiocy to prevent it, and I have renewed and strengthened
  my sense of the sweetness and beauty of air travel&mdash;in the small open
  machine.</p>

  <p>As I hung in the crystalline air above the mountains of Slovakia, far
  above the wooded hills and deep green gorges, with the culminating masses of
  the Little Carpathians heaped up to the right of me and the line of the White
  Carpathians away to the left, and ahead of me, still dim and distant, the
  striped fields and villages of the plain of Bratislava; and as I turned about
  and looked at the blue Moravian lands behind me, with every stream and pool
  picked out in molten silver by the afternoon sun, I was as near the summit of
  felicity as I have been in all my very pleasant life. Ever and again we
  overtook some little puff of cloud. There were little troops of bright white
  cloudlets that raced with us eastward, swift and noiseless; their shadows
  raced our own little shadow up the slopes and across the forest crests below,
  and their whiteness and their transitory cool embrace as we passed through
  them, enhanced by contrast the sunlit clearness and brightness of the
  outspread world.</p>

  <p>For the first part of my flight that day I was accompanied by three other
  Czech machines. They were fighting aeroplanes. They came up abreast of me in
  the liquid air, and their aviators signalled to me, and then, suddenly, they
  dived and swept over in a loop and fell down like dead leaves for a thousand
  feet or so and righted themselves and flew home again to Prague. I have seen
  such manoeuvres before from the ground, but they are far more graceful and
  lovely when one floats above them and watches the aeroplane drop down like a
  falling kite, almost, it seems, to the spires and tree-tops.</p>

  <p>At last we began to descend, and circled down to Nitra, a place I had
  never heard of before, a wonderfully beautiful and, I should think, a very
  prosperous town, with a great church and many spires, and from the aerodrome
  at Nitra I started again two days later to return to Prague. The weather was
  unsettled, and the most hopeful time for flying was the early morning. I left
  Topol'cany, where I had been staying, at dawn, therefore, with a full moon
  shining brightly in a rain-washed sky, and after a little misadventure and a
  cut head in a ditch, for automobiles are much less safe than aeroplanes, and
  the roads that morning were wet mire, reached Nitra at sunrise and rose with
  the red blaze of the sun above the hills.</p>

  <p>Sun and aeroplane seemed to soar up together. Never before had I been up
  in the air so early in the morning. All the little trees below were blobs and
  dots, but they cast shadows hundreds of feet long, and in the deep blue nooks
  and crannies of the gold-lit hills the white mists huddled.</p>

  <p>The wind rose against us as we returned and blew a gale. We took four
  hours to make a journey that the other way, before the wind, had taken little
  more than two. Between Brunn and Prague the aeroplane swayed and danced like
  a kite on its string, and ever and again found an air pocket and dropped a
  few score feet. But though I am but a moderate sailor, I do not get air-sick;
  and to sit loose and lax and unafraid, strapped into an open aeroplane,
  drenched in sweet air, is altogether different from being enclosed in an air
  omnibus. I had rather be four hours in an open aeroplane in a high wind than
  two in an automobile on a bad road or one in a Channel steamboat on a rough
  day.</p>

  <p>Those two flights in Slovakia are among the very happiest experiences I
  have ever had in my life. And it irks me to think that, because of the
  incoherent muddle of human affairs, things go so slowly that I shall probably
  never be able to go round the world in the same delightful fashion, and fly
  over the deserts of Arabia and the plains of India, and down the gorges of
  the Yang-tse-Kiang. All these things I might do in a saner world. The places
  exist, the discoveries have been made, but a magic net of rivalries,
  obstructions, and vile preoccupations, delays the consummation of these
  bright possibilities. A happier generation will have all these pleasures
  within its reach. Such an aeroplane as the one I flew in need not cost more
  than a Ford car, even now, and it is almost as easy to fly as it is to drive
  an automobile.</p>

  <p>But, of course, all such things must wait, and civilisation must wait,
  until M. Poincaré has collected the claims of France upon Germany or smashed
  up Europe. It is so much more important, you understand, to collect these
  legendary, impossible debts, that one little scrap of Europe has figured up
  against another little scrap of Europe, than to get on with living. The
  Germans must not be allowed to develop their air services; that would never
  do for the politicians; and, indeed, every European country must do all it
  can to restrain the air development of every other country. We must all get
  in each other's way; that is the "common sense" of national "policy." Why
  else are we all boxed up in little separate sovereign States? And so you and
  I, Dear Reader, will never get more than such brief samples and intimations
  of the happiness we might have in the air, and most people now alive in the
  world will never get to flying at all. They will die and never know. They
  will grub along the earth's surface and die with this great delight almost
  within their reach, taunting them by its humming passage across their
  sky.</p>

  <p class="cp">6.10.1923</p>

  <p class="first">THE long-spun-out passive resistance in the Ruhr is over,
  and the controlled, instructed, and disciplined French Press, and the more
  than French Press which serves the national interests of France in Great
  Britain and Holland and other European countries, is cock-a-hoop with the
  clamour of this empty victory. Let us consider what it means for civilisation
  and the world at large.</p>

  <p>Men's memories are short, and it may be well to remind them of the broad
  facts that have led up to this outrageous, pitiful struggle of the Ruhr. In
  November 1918 the German people, after an unexampled struggle of four years,
  surrendered to the Allied Powers arrayed against them. They surrendered on
  the promises held out to them by the Fourteen Points of President Wilson and
  by the British propaganda of Crewe House. They surrendered, and they were
  disarmed and placed in a position in which it was impossible for them to
  resume resistance. The Americans and British, at any rate, were bound in
  honour to see that the virtual pact of the surrender was observed, and they
  did not do so. A peace was put over the German peoples having no relation to
  the clear understanding of the virtual pact of the surrender, and the bill
  for damages and reparations was figured up against them utterly beyond their
  capacity to pay. The Germans signed the Peace Treaty only after the most
  strenuous protests and because they were then powerless to do anything else.
  The Treaty was not a bargain to which they agreed, it was a monstrous and
  impossible obligation rammed down their throats.</p>

  <p>There can be only two judgments about this overcharge. Either it was made
  out of sheer ignorance and levity, or it was made with the deliberate
  intention of keeping Germany henceforth in arrears and in the wrong, so that
  at any sign of economic or political revival she could be at once claimed
  against and stricken down again. Possibly ignorance and levity mingled with
  foreseeing malignity in the counsels at Versailles. But the temptations
  created by the situation have proved irresistible. Throughout the years
  immediately following this Treaty France has never faltered from her
  conception that the new peace was only the continuation and completion of her
  ages-long feud against Germany. She has been quietly and steadfastly
  strangling Germany in the name of her debt. At Washington she refused to
  discuss the question of land disarmament&mdash;some of us can still recall M.
  Briand's preposterous speech about the concealed arms and hidden armies of
  Germany&mdash;and across the amiable, foolish face of the Geneva League of
  Nations she has woven a net of armed alliances, heaping guns and dull and
  overwhelming expense upon the insolvent peasant States of Eastern Europe, and
  dissipating the money she owes to Britain and America upon fresh military
  adventures. She is now indisputably in military control of Europe. Great
  Britain has displayed no such fixity of intention as France, and,
  particularly since the downfall of Mr. Lloyd George, has just rolled about in
  an uneasy, protesting manner. America has withdrawn in a state of virtuous
  indignation from the mess she helped so carelessly and generously to
  make.</p>

  <p>Until the spring of this year Germany continued to make very considerable
  but insufficient payments to her conquerors. There seemed, indeed, a
  possibility that she might presently muddle back to a tolerable and
  honourable position in European affairs. France perceived that the hour had
  come for effective action; and Mr. Lloyd George being by that time out of her
  way, she occupied the Ruhr, the industrial heart of Germany. She occupied it
  without the consent of her Allies, and so illegally; and with an utter
  disregard of the interests of Britain, who came to her rescue when she was
  faint with terror in 1914. She occupied it with every circumstance of petty
  insolence. Most of us have seen photographs and cinema films of the French
  troops strutting through the disarmed, defenceless German towns, and the
  French officers hitting off the hats and smacking the faces of any bystanders
  who did not display sufficient reverence for their intrusive flag.</p>

  <p>I cannot imagine what black murder would not spring up in the hearts of an
  American or British population treated as the Germans were treated this
  spring. The behaviour of the Germans has indeed been amazingly patient. The
  rest of Germany has wrecked itself financially in a desperate attempt to
  sustain the Ruhr workers in an attitude of passive resistance, and now at
  last these overwhelming payments have to cease. For the better part of a year
  the trade and industry of Central Europe has been dislocated. A year of human
  life and human production has been frittered away in this struggle. The great
  economic machine of Western Germany is now like some complex piece of
  apparatus that has been fought for by infuriated children. How deep the
  physical and moral wounds inflicted on the war-exhausted, depleted being of
  Germany may be we can as yet only speculate.</p>

  <p>But France has achieved a great victory in this new war, for war it is,
  against an unarmed antagonist. She is victorious, and the tricolour triumphs
  over Europe. The passive resistance of the Ruhr has been abandoned and the
  German Government has been unable to get any conditions from France in
  exchange for this surrender. The debt looms as large as ever, the possibility
  of effective payments is much remoter than it has been before, and France is
  in a stronger position argumentatively than she has even been. She can still
  go on counting her steadily accumulating claim. She can proceed, whenever she
  wishes to do so, to fresh seizures, further occupations, and further
  humiliations for her defeated enemy. There is no boundary set, by anything
  that has happened, to the systematic disintegration of the great civilisation
  of Germany. Germans may be found vile enough and foolish enough to assist in
  the political fragmentation of their own people. Presently we may see Germany
  broken up into half a dozen nasty little retrogressive States, all played off
  against each other to their mutual enfeeblement by France.</p>

  <p>Then, except for an ambiguous Italy, there will be nothing left upon the
  Continent of Europe but a victorious France and her smashed and broken
  antagonists and her servile and uncertain allied peasant States, Europe
  Balkanised from the Rhine to the Black Sea. It will be a realisation of the
  great dreams of Napoleon I, a hundred and twenty years later. True, Russia
  will loom rather dark and rather neglected in the background of the French
  millennium, but the French think that from a military or political point of
  view Russia is to be counted out for the next fifty years. And, as the happy
  achievement of "security" in Europe becomes more certain, France will be able
  to turn her attention to her old rival and temporary ally across the Channel.
  French ideas of trade and economics have always been nationalist and
  monopolistic, and at last she will be in a position to apply to Britain with
  real effect that system of exclusion from the markets of Europe, the
  Continental system, which failed when Napoleon I first devised and tried it a
  century or more ago. Moreover, she will be at last able to reopen the
  discussion of the proper ownership of the vast natural resources of Central
  Africa, at present largely shared by the British. The victory of the Ruhr is
  a considerable victory, a great hungry victory, but it is only one in a
  sustained campaign in the realisation of a policy centuries old, the policy
  of French predominance in the European world. France has had revolutions and
  reverses, but her nationalism is the intensest of all nationalism, and her
  conception of international policy has been the same under Bourbon,
  Bonaparte, or Republic. She seems to be incapable of any such ideas as
  co-operation, coalescence, union, pooling, reconciliation, reconstruction on
  a broader basis, brotherhood of nations or the like. There is no stopping
  her. She will thrust her fluttering tricolour, her brave little men in
  horizon blue and steel helmets, her intrigues and her claims, farther and
  farther over a suffering, disorganised world&mdash;until she becomes by
  common consent impossible.</p>

  <p>The Ruhr is a great victory for France, and it has won her nothing. What
  next will she do after the Ruhr?</p>

  <h2><a id="art04"
     name="art04">THE SINGAPORE ARSENAL</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">13.10.1923</p>

  <p class="first">IT is proposed that Great Britain, which is too shabbily
  poor to give the mass of its own children more than half an elementary
  education, which cannot house its workers with comfort or decency, which has
  over a million unemployed, shall spend great sums of money upon a naval
  establishment at Singapore. This undertaking is just not within the positive
  prohibitions of the Washington Agreement. It is a few hundred miles west of
  the area involved in that Agreement. But it is flatly contrary to the spirit
  of the Washington gathering. It is a frank provocation to crippled and
  devastated Japan; it dominates the route of the French to Tonkin; it is a
  contemptuous gesture at any American notions about the "freedom of the
  seas."</p>

  <p>Provided cruisers and battleships are to play a part in the "next war," it
  is an admirably chosen position. Let the reader look it up in any atlas and
  see how its submarines will be able to radiate over the adjacent seas and how
  all India supports it. It is fairly well placed for air war also. On the
  supposition that the world is still to go on divided among aggressive
  sovereign States, with phases of war preparation called peace and acute
  phases of more and more destructive war, it is quite a good move in the game.
  On the supposition that the world is growing up to any age of reason and that
  a world civilisation is attainable, it is a monstrously stupid crime.</p>

  <p>When I was at the Washington Conference upon the Limitation of Armaments I
  denounced the French with what many people thought was an extreme bitterness
  for their reliance upon submarines and Senegalese troops. This British feat
  at Singapore deserves an equal denunciation. These preparations of the French
  and British are equally acts of war against the general peace of mankind. It
  is no good treating the French as though they alone were outraging the unity
  of mankind with their great armies and equipments. Great Britain, we now see
  by this crime at Singapore, is just as mischievously and criminally disposed.
  Both Powers are disturbers of the peace and destroyers of human hope.</p>

  <p>But when the thing is done by one's own country and by people we know, one
  sees more of it and more of the humanity of it than when it happens abroad;
  and I find a particular figure floating before my mind now whenever I hear or
  read the word Singapore. He will serve as my type specimen for this
  aggressive and troublesome British imperialism, and very probably the
  essential wickedness of French policy finds its embodiment in some quite
  similar personalities.</p>

  <p>In which case we are not up against wickedness, but against&mdash;what
  shall I say?&mdash;a retardation of mental development.</p>

  <p>My type specimen is the First Lord of the Admiralty in the present *
  British Government, Mr. Amery. He is a pleasantly smiling, short, thick-set
  lad of fifteen. He was born in 1873, but in 1889, when he should have become
  sixteen, he was living the life of an exceptionally clever boy at Harrow, and
  somehow just became fifteen again, and he has remained fifteen ever since.
  Every year his birthday comes round without the slightest effect upon him. He
  may be a little more substantial, but his bland, clean-shaven face is the
  same that confronted the Harrow masters. He has just the same smile. He went
  on to a brilliant career at Balliol College, Oxford, always famous for its
  retardation of adolescence, and emerged a devotee of the British Empire and
  of the games of Foreign Policy and War. Kipling was new to men then, and that
  generation was drunken with him. Cecil Rhodes was a great inspiration in the
  land. He could not have preached salvation by Anglo-Saxons more earnestly if
  he had been Mr. Lothrop Stoddard. Mr. Amery, under these influences and by a
  natural inclination, dedicated his life to the British Empire, any British
  Empire apparently and whatever it did, and he has been so busy serving it
  ever since that he has never had time to think what it is at all.</p>

  <p>He is one of a group of interesting youths of fifteen who focussed upon
  Balliol College. But most of the others have become portly or bald, or they
  have grown whiskers or such-like disguises; none of them still show their
  fifteen-ness as engagingly as Mr. Amery.</p>

  <p>Now the mind of a boy of fifteen is a very interesting sort of mind.
  Imagination is awake and lively, but it is still a narrow imagination. Many
  of the emotions and social devotions are still undeveloped. A boy of fifteen
  is still capable of making a volcano in the garden with all the available
  explosives; he likes mixing chemicals to see what will happen; he thinks the
  loveliest possession in the world is a gun. If you give him a toy railway
  system he will take great pains to arrange for a really smashing collision.
  Towards women he is a Spartan&mdash;a Red Indian. Something of fifteen still
  lingers in my own composition, though most of me is a little older, and
  before the war I used to play a great war-game on my barn floor with lead
  soldiers, realistic scenery and guns that hit, with other boys, actually and
  sometimes even chronologically fifteen. Unflinching fellows those lead
  soldiers were; they left no widows and orphans, and if one got disabled there
  was no pension. You melted him down.</p>

  <p>Now both Mr. Amery and I would like to play soldiers with the world. But
  while Mr. Amery has remained fifteen through and through, large parts of me
  have gone on growing older. This older section of me can see men as something
  more than lead soldiers, and realise war in terms of spilled human life and
  utter waste and as a stupid massacre of boys and young men. Even that
  war-game we used to play in our barn left the floor in a weary-looking
  muddle, and was a bore to put away. But the highest expression of Mr. Amery's
  being is, I perceive, to play soldiers and battleships with mankind.</p>

  <p>And the amazing thing is that we let him!</p>

  <p>We are disposed to let this man with the soul of a fifteen-year-old kid
  spend money for which our schools are being starved, upon this solemn
  childishness at Singapore. And there may be thousands of us doomed to wounds
  and blood and tears under the plump hands and knees of Mr. Amery and his
  little friends and their antagonists as they crawl about their game on the
  floor of the world.</p>

  <p>But if I can see Mr. Amery, not as a black devotee of blood-lust but as an
  innocent perennial juvenile, then I am bound if I can to see the same thing
  in France. Those people over there who are opening new boxes of African
  soldiers and setting them down in Germany, and who are so secret and busy
  with their submarines, are probably just such innocents as Mr.
  Amery&mdash;just as solemnly fifteen. They have not yet learnt to see the
  world in terms of life. And, if so, the cure for war is not so much for the
  world to grow better as for the world to grow up.</p>

  <p>Mr. Amery is not a bit terrible personally, but it is terrible that he
  should have any sort of control of the serious things of life. I think he
  ought to be kept out of mischief&mdash;just as I think another lad of the
  same age, Mr. Winston Churchill, ought to be kept out of mischief, in some
  sort of institution where he can play Kriegsspiel for the rest of his
  existence without endangering human life. And I ask reasonable adult men in
  France whether the time is not ripe for a similar segregation of puerility
  from their Foreign Office and War Office out of the reach of mischief.
  Perhaps the 1924 electors will do something in that direction. If these lads
  presently get a game of war going between France and England we shall have
  the whole fabric of civilisation so entirely in ruins before it is over that
  I doubt if it will be reconstructed for many centuries.</p>

  <h2><a id="art05"
     name="art05">THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS AGAIN</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">20.10.1923</p>

  <p class="first">I OPENED this series of articles with an attack on the
  existing League of Nations at Geneva. This attack provoked a very
  considerable correspondence in reply. Hardly anyone was disposed to defend
  the League as perfect or satisfactory, but it was urged that it was a
  beginning, a germ, a young thing that might accumulate power and prestige,
  that its intentions were admirable, that it embodied and sustained an ideal,
  and that if it were destroyed there would be nothing to stand between the
  nations at all. I was reproached because&mdash;after an advocacy of world
  unity for a quarter of a century&mdash;I refused to recognise this poor
  diplomatic changeling as the birth of my desires.</p>

  <p>It is perhaps desirable that I should answer these criticisms and state a
  little more explicitly why I think this affair at Geneva is worse than no
  league of mankind at all. I do not think it can ever develop into a
  serviceable organ for world civilisation, because I think that it was planned
  from the outset upon the wrong lines; and that it is as reasonable to support
  it in the hope of its growing to meet the world's needs as it would be to buy
  a broken-down perambulator in the hope that it would presently develop into a
  much needed automobile.</p>

  <p>The Geneva League of Nations is a start, I admit, but it is a start in the
  wrong direction; and before we can get upon the way to any real collective
  organisation of world affairs we have to retrace our steps to the starting-
  point before there was any League. The League is malformed in such a way that
  it can never hope to grow straight and strong.</p>

  <p>One primary fault in the structure of this existing League is its complete
  abandonment to the idea of national sovereignty in its intensest and most
  mischievous form. Any little bundle of human beings, however small,
  illiterate, and unimportant, provided only that it was a law unto itself and
  waved a flag about and insisted upon a cantankerous independence, was
  regarded as a possible unit by the pedants who devised the League. Any body
  of people, however numerous, intelligent, and significant in human affairs,
  provided it had grouped itself into any other larger political aggregation,
  ceased, on the other hand, to be anything but a merged participator in the
  League's affairs. So Abyssinia, in which there are probably not two hundred
  people capable of understanding the rudiments of world politics, could be
  considered seriously as a member of this absurd association, while Scotland,
  the best educated country in Europe, was not to appear except as a button or
  collar-stud, so to speak, upon the figure of the British representative.</p>

  <p>The manifest consequences of such a preposterous recognition of
  separatism, the inevitable feebleness and disingenuousness of a League based
  upon such ideas, were pointed out as early as May 1918 in a memorandum issued
  by the official propaganda organisation of the British Government at Crewe
  House. Crewe House was rather a thorn in the side of the dear old British
  Foreign Office; in 1918 it was asking for a definition of Allied war aims and
  all sorts of inconvenient, honest questions. The memorandum was treated
  according to the best diplomatic precedents. Although we v/ere making it the
  basis of extravagant promises to Germany, it was never communicated, as it
  should have been, to the French and Italians. At the end of the war the
  promises of Crewe House dropped out of the victorious picture. The reasoning
  and the warnings of this memorandum were entirely ignored by the hasty
  gentlemen at Versailles who threw together the Geneva League of Nations.</p>

  <p>These gentlemen seem to have been profoundly influenced by an infantile
  analogy between a sovereign State and an individual man. This is the age of
  democracy; and the League, most marvellous formula! was ''to make the world
  safe for democracy." Modern democracy is taken to mean so much political
  equality between adult and adult as may be achieved by giving each individual
  a vote.</p>

  <p>What more easy or&mdash;if you think it out&mdash;more fallacious than to
  transfer this idea to sovereign States and give each of them a vote in a
  wonderful congress of mankind? But one sovereign State is not like another
  sovereign State, as one individual man is like another; the difference
  between this sovereign State and that is far profounder even than the
  difference between animals of different classes. The difference in structure,
  complexity, function, and destiny, for example, between the organisation
  known as the United States of America and that known as Nicaragua is a
  difference as wide as that between the whole plant of a great industrial
  district and a small domestic mangle. But in the original Covenant of the
  League both were treated as individuals differing only a little in size and
  importance. Liberia, Belgium, France, Haiti, and the Hedjaz were all to
  be&mdash;and they are!&mdash;citizens in this marvellous republic of States.
  It is like treating a jar of pickles, an opera house, a battleship, a bundle
  of sugar-cane, and a small travelling bag as equivalent things. Any old thing
  with a flag on it&mdash;that is the rule.</p>

  <p>Can you expect the debates and divisions of a body so constituted to have
  any restraining influence upon the policies and practices of the Great
  Powers? It is treated with open contempt in France and Italy, and if there is
  a sort of support for it in Great Britain it is largely because there is a
  feeling that with Lord Balfour and Lord Robert Cecil to the fore and with its
  British Foreign Office Secretary and so forth its procedure can be
  manipulated in the interests of the&mdash;I won't say British, for that is
  too good a word to use&mdash;the "Anglican" Empire.</p>

  <p>Now my case is that this constitution of the League is for the reasons I
  have stated bad beyond all patching. There is, I hold, no need at all to base
  the thing we need upon a sham Parliament of a miscellany of sovereign States,
  big or little, civilised or savage. What civilisation needs are open,
  efficient, and authoritative controls of certain universal interests,
  controls representing the great mass of civilised people and their common
  world interests. For all practical ends it would be infinitely better to let
  Liberia, Haiti, the Hedjaz, and the like go hang. Such little, such parochial
  States ought to learn to combine up with kindred organisations&mdash;or' hold
  their peace in world affairs. Not one of them contains as many people
  educated up to ideas of world policy as, let us say, any outlying suburb of
  Amsterdam. If half a dozen of the bigger political systems of the world, or
  even two or three, could get together to sustain a common monetary standard,
  a common transport control, a common law court, a tariff union, a mutual
  defence system, and a common guarantee of disarmament, they would achieve
  something beyond the uttermost possibilities of this Geneva affair.</p>

  <p>So much political coalescence on the part&mdash;to take an example
  boldly&mdash;of the United States, the British system, Holland, and the
  Scandinavian countries would form a nucleus so large and influential that
  upon it the rest of the world, however fiercely nationalist at heart, would
  in the end be obliged to crystallise. I believe all these countries I have
  named, and Latin America and Spain and Portugal to boot, could pool their
  foreign policies&mdash;for that is what any genuine League of Nations
  means&mdash;without encountering insuperable difficulties. The worst barrier
  would be tariffs, but I do not believe that would be an invincible barrier.
  Such a club of civilised peoples would very speedily have all the rest of the
  world on its waiting list. And I do not see why its achievement should be any
  more difficult than, or indeed nearly as difficult as, bolstering up this
  ineffective pretence, the present League of Nations. I contend that instead
  of there being no alternative to the League of Nations the way would open
  quite naturally to such alternatives, directly it was cleared out of the way.
  It would, for instance&mdash;if only on account of the United States&mdash;be
  much easier to set up a great International Court of Justice with proper
  sanctions without the League than with it.</p>

  <p>It is not as though the present League had accumulated any honour or
  prestige during its four years of life in Geneva. In the case of the Polish
  attack on Russia, in the case of the Greek aggressions on Turkey, in regard
  to the occupation of the Ruhr, the murderous bombardment of Corfu, and the
  stealing of the Greek deposit by the Council of Ambassadors to bring the
  Italians to evacuate Corfu, it has shown itself trivial, useless, and
  ridiculous. It is either silent before such outrages or it speaks with a
  quavering voice and nobody listens. It is a blind alley for good intentions,
  it is a weedy dump for all the weaknesses of European liberalism. Its past is
  contemptible, and the briefer the future of its present constitution the
  better for mankind.</p>

  <h2><a id="art06"
     name="art06">THE AVIATION OF THE HALF-CIVILISED</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">27.10.1923</p>

  <p class="first">IT is probable that the first adequate and successful
  inauguration of air transport will be in North and South America, but it is
  in Europe that the needs and possibilities are greatest; and were it not for
  the short-sightedness and petty competitiveness of the Europeans it is in
  Europe that flying might first become the usual method of travel for
  distances of over three hundred miles. Europe is so cut up by channels,
  sands, bays, Zuyder Zees, Adriatics and Baltic Seas and the like, she has so
  clumsy and ill-planned a railway network, planned upon national lines to
  restrict too ready movements across frontiers, that she calls aloud for the
  aeroplane to soar over these wet obstacles and tangled confusions. But the
  chief intent and occupation of European administrators nowadays lies in
  spoiling the efforts of and making life insupportable for other Europeans,
  and naturally flying presents itself to them chiefly as a provocation to
  international sabotage. Most of the air services we hear about in Europe are
  hopelessly inadequate to the needs of civilised people who want to travel
  conveniently and beautifully. They are uncomfortable, unpunctual, dangerous,
  ridiculous, and&mdash;in view of what might be&mdash;pitiful.</p>

  <p>It is as absurd to think of an air tour of Western Europe as it would be
  to think of an automobile tour of the Balkans and Asia Minor. The countries
  concerned are not sufficiently civilised to allow of such methods of
  transport.</p>

  <p>Occasionally one sees maps in the newspapers showing the most wonderful
  network of air routes all over Europe: London to Moscow, Manchester to
  Constantinople, and the like. Any travel bureau will hand the credulous
  inquirer neat little handbills of air services, showing how he may breakfast
  in London and dine in Berlin, and so forth. Let the credulous inquirer try
  these services. He will find a few tired and badly overhauled machines run by
  companies with entirely insufficient supplies, plying in a mood of hectic
  uncertainty over some of these routes. On others the only thing he will find
  soaring will be soaring promises. And he will find very little hope in the
  future of any better services.</p>

  <p>I tried an air tour of Europe this summer. I did not warn any of the new
  companies concerned that I meant to write about them. I went as an ordinary
  passenger. Let me tell my experiences very briefly.</p>

  <p>I started with a ticket for Berlin from London, and my first flight was to
  Amsterdam. I started on a perfect day for flying. But as we approached the
  Channel it became evident that we were not going to cross the water, but that
  we were swerving round to Lympne. Something had gone wrong. We landed at
  Lympne. The aviator apologised; he had an oil leakage. Matters were patched
  up, and we got up again and flew to Amsterdam. There the oil leakage was
  worse than ever, and we could not have gone much farther. A head-wind or a
  sudden storm might have got us into serious trouble. We had been flying in a
  machine that had not been sedulously overhauled, an overworked machine.</p>

  <p>Next day I should have flown on to Berlin. When I went to the Amsterdam
  office to start, I learned that no aeroplane had come from Berlin for two
  days&mdash;though it was admirable flying weather&mdash;and the office could
  not tell me when a machine would be available. Apparently there had been some
  financial dislocation of the German service. I had to get round to various
  European towns I wanted to visit by means of the shabby, disheartened railway
  services of Central Europe. Returning, I did secure tickets for Paris from
  Prague by the Franco-Rumanian Air Company, which professes to run a swift and
  regular service from Bucharest to Paris. At the Prague aerodrome there is a
  vainglorious monument, an obelisk, to commemorate the foundation of this
  company. That and the office in Prague, where I got my money back, was as
  much as I saw of the Franco-Rumanian Company. Thanks to certain fortunate
  chances, which made me independent of private enterprise aeroplane companies,
  I had had some beautiful flying in Czecho-Slovakia. I made three delightful
  flights on three separate days, and on two of these days the French machines
  were not going to Strassburg "on account of the weather."</p>

  <p>The real trouble of that particular company, however, was not the weather,
  but a shortage of machines. The company has no understanding with the German
  Government, and its route lies over German territory from Czecho-Slovakia to
  Strassburg. Badly overhauled machines are never safe to get to their
  destination, and, I was told, eleven Franco-Rumanian aeroplanes, forced to
  descend on German territory, had been seized by the Germans.</p>

  <p>'Planes were coming to Prague from Warsaw and Vienna and depositing
  passengers there to get through to their destinations as well as they could,
  but there was nothing going on to Strassburg. I got to Paris from Prague by
  train via Amsterdam! That is the present route between these two places, and
  I suppose it will remain so until our great grandchildren, if any, see what
  is left of the French removed from what is left of the Ruhr Valley.</p>

  <p>From Paris I started by an English service for London. We started with an
  air of tremendous punctuality and efficiency from the Hotel Crillon at three
  in the afternoon. I reckoned we should be up by 3.30, and that I should dine
  in London at half-past seven or eight. But we muddled about at the aerodrome
  of Le Bourget until nearly five, booking luggage, fooling with passports,
  packing the all too big and clumsy omnibus machine. I sat in a seat with a
  lot of valises and hat boxes, tied precariously with string, swaying in front
  of my nose. The saloon had a worn and weary look; it was not nearly so pretty
  as it is in the advertisement pictures. We made a fairly good flight to the
  coast except that now and then the engine popped a little. We rose over the
  water, as usual, to about five thousand feet. Then as we came within distant
  sight of Dungeness, one engine began to miss badly. I noticed that we were
  dropping rapidly. However, we escaped a ducking. We crossed the coast-line
  while still at nearly two thousand feet and landed at Lympne. Apologies. The
  defective engine, we were told, was in a hopeless condition, and the company
  must send us passengers on in cars to a rural railway station and so by slow
  train to London, to arrive at heaven knows what hour. There was no attempt
  whatever to bring up a reserve aeroplane from Croydon; I presume because the
  company has no reserve aeroplanes available. I had the good luck to find a
  friend at Lympne who took me to his house for the night and turned my
  misfortune into pleasure, but my fellow-passengers were not so fortunate.</p>

  <p>Luckily I was not a passenger in the French Goliath which crashed at West
  Mailing in August last. I have flown successfully on one occasion from Paris
  to London in a French Goliath, and on another have started from London to
  Paris and had a forced landing at Lympne. These Goliaths are quite good
  machines, but they seem to be unlucky ones. That West Mailing disaster was
  only another such story of "private enterprise" flying as I have told, but
  carried to the pitch of tragedy. The unfortunate machine must have been in a
  shocking condition of maladjustment. It had already been down at Lympne for
  patching, and was going on to Croydon. The radiator of the port engine had
  been leaking. Then as it went on to Croydon the starboard engine failed
  completely. But we have always been told, perhaps untruthfully, that even if
  one engine of these double engine machines fails the other suffices to carry
  on to a safe landing. The port engine was still going. The aviator declared
  at first that there was a panic among the passengers, and that is why he
  crashed in a nut plantation. I doubt about the panic. But at any rate, here
  again was a machine in use in a condition quite unfit for passenger traffic,
  so that it needed only a momentary nervous failure to destroy it.</p>

  <p>The moral I draw here to-day is to repeat exactly what I maintained upon
  the British Civil Air Transport Commission in 1918. "Private enterprise"
  cannot run successful European air services. Moreover, it is impossible to
  control the air services of Europe on nationalist lines. You cannot have
  nearly forty sovereign countries each trying to wreck the air service of the
  other thirty-nine. Europe must be one area for air transport under one
  control, or there can be nothing but a few ferry services in operation. One
  comprehensive European air trust, with hundreds and presently thousands of
  aeroplanes in daily flight and two or three in reserve and under overhaul for
  every one in the air, would have in the end an enormously profitable
  organisation. But Europe to-day is as morally incapable of producing such an
  organisation as Central Africa. These risky trips in dud machines and these
  flowery prospectuses of defective services are as much organised public
  flying as this generation is likely to see in Europe.</p>

  <h2><a id="art07"
     name="art07">WILL GERMANY BREAK INTO PIECES?</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">3.11.1923</p>

  <p class="first">WILL GERMANY break into pieces and become a group of
  divergent and mutually hostile States?</p>

  <p>To some readers this will seem to be an entirely useless question. They
  will declare that the thing is happening. Germany is breaking up visibly,
  they will say. Germany has attempted a democratic republic and failed. The
  daily news is kaleidoscopic. It varies with the day and the political bias of
  one's paper. Sometimes Germany is breaking in this way and sometimes in that.
  But few people seem to have much faith in the final emergence of a united
  Germany from this sea of disaster and misery in Central Europe.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I believe too much in the things of the mind and imagination, in
  language and writing and literature as a link and a sustaining power in human
  affairs, but I do not share this belief in the break-up of Germany. I believe
  she will keep together as Russian-speaking Russia has kept together, and
  become again a great nation and a great people playing a leading part in the
  world's destinies.</p>

  <p>It is true that her new democratic institutions have worked feebly and
  disastrously. But just at present what we call democratic institutions, our
  old clumsy system of voting and representative government that is, are not
  working particularly well in any European country. One cannot congratulate
  either Great Britain or France or Italy upon its triumphant democracy just at
  the present time. The duly elected British Government is unable to carry out
  its obvious foreign policy effectively because it is shouted down by a
  millionaire newspaper-owner suffering from Napoleonic mania, and in France
  the expression of public opinion is not so much shouted down as battened down
  under a centralised and all-powerful Press combine. France behaves with the
  concentrated vigour of monomania, and Great Britain with the self-regardful
  evasiveness of the feebleminded, and the common citizen of neither country is
  really justified in an attitude of superiority towards the distraught and
  leaderless German.</p>

  <p>Distraught and leaderless the Germans are, and&mdash;which is perhaps the
  greatest misfortune that can happen to a people in the face of a steadfast
  enemy &mdash;without a leading idea to hold them together. We have to
  remember that this great people, the Germans, lost their way in 1848, and
  have still to recover it. At that tune there was a reasonable prospect of a
  Republican United States of Germany. It was wrecked by the habitual
  particularism of Germany, and by the self-seeking treason of the
  Hohenzollerns. Germany was unified later, but from above and not from below,
  by a crown and dynasty and not by education and an educated popular will, and
  Germany is still reaping the consequences of that misfortune.</p>

  <p>It is not the least among the endless inconveniences of monarchy that it
  substitutes an unreal symbol for real ideas of unity. Instead of a cult of
  brotherhood, instead of a pride in the achievements of one's own people in
  science and art and social progress and the service of mankind, there is
  substituted, more or less completely, an idiot adulation of the crowned head
  and his womankind and their offspring. The school children of a monarchist
  country are trained up to a worship of these glorified individuals; the flag
  becomes a carpet beneath the feet of their deities, and their attention is
  diverted from their own pride and honour as future members of a great
  community. Many people never grow up out of the obsessions of a royalist
  training, and so it is that the collapse of the Hohenzollern system has left
  great masses of the German people imaginatively bankrupt and utterly
  confused. Any people who had had the same training and the same experience
  would be equally at a loss and helpless. The idea of a great German republic,
  one and indivisible, has to be built up now in an atmosphere of unparalleled
  storm, confusion, and disaster.</p>

  <p>It cannot be built up all at once, and meanwhile anything superficial in
  the way of separations may happen to Germany. I will not attempt to discuss
  the bubblings of separatism and monarchist extremism that are going on. But
  one probability is very present in my mind. It is one of the paradoxes of the
  Russian situation that the Communist Government of Moscow survives there very
  largely because under the stress of foreign invasions and the foreign-
  subsidised devastations of White adventurers it became a patriotic
  Government. In Germany now, neither the big industrials, the old Junkers, nor
  the ruling classes generally seem to have the wit and generosity to think of
  their civilisation as a whole. The Communists do&mdash;after their fashion.
  At present the Communists are showing no overwhelming strength in German
  affairs, but a time may come when great numbers of the German people, trained
  in hardship, ruined and desperate, may turn to this one party which tells the
  same story in the Rhineland and Bavaria and Saxony and Prussia.</p>

  <p>We have, I think, to count it among the possibilities of the present
  situation that a Communist Government may presently be fighting for German
  integrity against foreign domination in Berlin, and that great masses of the
  German people, like the Russians, may prefer even Communism to the certain
  shames and indignities of separatism. In which case Monsieur Poincaré will, I
  suppose, beat up his armies of blacks and whites and march on Berlin. With an
  "extension" trip to Moscow to follow.</p>

  <p>Yet even after that Germany will survive. Twice before in her history
  Germany has arisen out of desolation and defeat. I believe she will rise
  again out of her present darkness and end at last the central and leading
  Power, the very keystone, it may be, of a reconstructed Europe. I believe in
  the German schoolmaster, the German student, in German persistency, and the
  patient strength of the German brain. I hated and hate that bastard imitative
  Byzantine-German Imperialism and German Junkerism, and I believe that our war
  to shatter these things was a necessary war. But I have never faltered in my
  belief in the greatness and soundness of the German people, and in my
  appreciation of all that we owe in intellectual, social, and industrial
  stimulus to Germany.</p>

  <p>Her present situation is unparalleled. Every attempt she makes to get to
  her feet is thwarted by her pitiless, senseless foe. Our English-speaking
  peoples, in our slow, oafish way, are looking on, are assisting, at an
  attempt to waste and torment to death a great community as civilised as our
  own. We never came into the war for any such objective, and I do not believe
  that we shall stand by to the end in the face of this iniquity.</p>

  <p>But anyhow, I believe that Germany will come back. Her common language and
  now her common miseries will keep her one. She has many enemies, but on her
  side now is the long reach and the long memory of the printed word. Bohemia,
  Czechoslovakia as we call it now, rose again after an almost complete
  extinction of three hundred years. Dark years are before Germany and a
  terrible winter, but in two years or ten years Germany will have found her
  Masaryk and her Benes and be on her way to recovery.</p>

  <p>I would not like to be a German separatist in the days to come.</p>

  <h2><a id="art08"
     name="art08">THE FUTURE OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp"><i>Empire Review</i>. October 1923</p>

  <p class="first">THE EMPIRE REVIEW has, I perceive, been born again and
  displays a constellation of gifted contributors writing about subjects of
  which their knowledge approaches saturation point. Commander Locker Lampson
  is alive to the need of variety, and for an incidental change he asks me to
  write upon a topic that he must feel is by no means my specialty. He wants my
  views about the British Empire. I more than suspect he counts upon my taking
  a Radical view of that great system. He selects me, an obscure supporter of
  the Labour Party, as a sample of what men are thinking on that side of the
  political arena. But I can write only as a man in that street. The official
  attitude of the party is to be found plainly and simply stated in the
  publications of the party headquarters.</p>

  <p>Yielding to the Editor's persuasiveness, I will set down a few notes and a
  few generalities that occur to me. They may offend some of those peculiar
  people who are all out for the British Empire, any old British Empire
  whatever it is and whatever it does, but I think that they may be of interest
  to many&mdash;what shall I call them?&mdash;Imperialists, and I take it most
  of the readers of the Empire Review are such, who are prepared for the idea
  that support of the British Empire may be a conditional support and not a
  fanaticism.</p>

  <p>Let me begin with something that is more than a mere verbal quibble. I
  wish that this political system could have some other name than Empire,
  because it is not properly an Empire at all. It is a complex association of
  at least three different types of territory, and the word "Empire" is
  endlessly misleading and mischievous in connection with it.</p>

  <p>In the last few years, for purposes that need not now concern us, I have
  had to study a certain amount of history and a number of historians. Many men
  of commanding intelligence have been historians, and I offer no comparison
  between the intellectual quality of historians and that of scientific men as
  such. But trained as I was in the clear, subtle and beautiful disciplines of
  comparative anatomy, I found myself amazed at the easy carelessness of the
  average historian's habitual terminology, his slovenly parallelisms and
  reckless assumptions. A large part of his work is the study of human
  communities and political associations. Yet I found him without any
  intelligible classification of political combinations, any real sense of
  grades and structural differences between one community and another. He slops
  the word "Empire" over the whole face of history; Athenian Empire and Aztec
  Empire, Shang Empire and Sung Empire, Empire of Alexander and Roman Empire,
  Mongol Empire and Hittite Empire, British Empire and Brazilian Empire; it's
  all the same to him. "Cats is dogs," as the porter said, "rabbits is poultry,
  but a parrot is a passenger." As a consequence, the historian argues from the
  most atrocious analogies. And, though there is a considerable and pretentious
  literature of political science, there does not yet exist in all political
  and historical literature any attempt at a clear analysis of the differences
  and affInities of all these various human complexes. Yet to make such an
  analysis would be a most attractive and fruitful task. Historical and
  political science has still to find its Linnaeus. History, until that
  happens, remains a slough of terminological confusion, and the ideas of the
  ordinary educated man drown in that mud.</p>

  <p>The word "Empire" came into the world with the expansion of the Roman
  Republic. The Roman Empire was a thing different in many fundamentals from
  the so-called "Empires" that preceded it, the "Shah-doms," if I may create a
  sort of temporary word, of Asia and the "Pharaoh-doms" of Egypt, for example.
  It differed from them at least as widely in its possibilities, structure and
  range as a species of Tertiary mammals differs from a species of Mesozoic
  reptiles. It was unprecedented in arising out of an aristocratic republic
  instead of a conquering monarchy, and in having a legal tradition of a
  strength and prestige unknown to any previous community. It was unprecedented
  in its disposition to extend its citizenship beyond its initial boundaries.
  Its expansion was concurrent with an increasing use of coined money and of
  credit based upon coined money; its economic and financial system had a quite
  novel facility and instability. The Empire was held together by a road-
  system that made the road-system of the Persians seem a mere preliminary
  experiment. Its extent was far greater than that of any preceding form of
  political administration. Reading and writing, already raised to new levels
  of simplicity and convenience by the Greeks and Hebrews, brought what we
  should think nowadays a small proportion, but which was in those days a quite
  unprecedented proportion, of the population into an intelligent participation
  in public affairs. Iron had become widespread for tools and implements as
  well as weapons, and the horse was now no longer a war-beast but, with its
  bastard child the mule, a universally available means of transport. All these
  things made the Roman Imperial System as new a thing in human experience as
  the United States of America or the present British "Empire," both of which,
  I hold, are new species, fresh beginnings without any true affinities in the
  past.</p>

  <p>There is in all history only one rough parallel to the Roman Empire, and
  that is its contemporary Chinese Empire. But I will restrain my encyclopaedic
  impulse and leave that out of our present discussion.</p>

  <p>Now as Gibbon's great history shows, the history of all Europe and Western
  Asia since that time is really the story of this unique thing, the Empire,
  the Roman Empire, and its struggle to exist, to remain one, and to restore
  itself, when broken, to complete existence. It was broken naturally by the
  Adriatic crack, running in towards that fatal wedge out of the great plains
  of the nomads, Hungary; it was broken by the general incapacity of the
  Italians for navigation, due perhaps to characteristics of the Italian coast;
  it was broken by the intellectual inadequacies of a plutocracy. But the
  Empires that sprang from it. West and East, were only the results of a
  fission that left the idea of reunion perpetually alive; the Holy Roman
  Empire, the Tzardom, the Imperialism of Napoleon, even the Austrian Empire
  and the Hohenzollern Empire, were all logically and legitimately the products
  of the original Empire, legitimately Empires in origin and intention,
  attempts to recover a universal sway; parts in a great dreary, futile
  European drama on which at last in these days the curtain falls.</p>

  <p>There has indeed only been one real Empire in the world, this that centred
  upon Rome and the Mediterranean. Britain played a certain part in this
  Empire; Henry VIII, for example, was Imperial candidate against Charles V and
  the King of France; but the role of Britain therein has generally been a
  marginal one. The importance of England to mankind began only when it turned
  its face from the Empire and from thoughts of the Empire to the ocean. What
  we call to-day the British Empire is a new thing and a different thing from
  the Roman Empire, created by new and greater forces, and deserving an
  entirely distinctive name.</p>

  <p>The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries saw the opening phases of a great
  process of change in human conditions that has been going on until the
  present time. From the point of view of one who discusses political or
  economic agglomerations, the most important thing in that great revolution
  has been the development of new means of communication between man and man.
  That revolution began with the appearance of the ocean-going sailing ship and
  of printed paper; it reaches its climax nowadays in wireless telegraphy and
  the aeroplane. It is now a commonplace, though for many historians and
  scholars it is quite a recent discovery, that any change in communications
  involves new economic, strategic and political adjustments. For a score of
  centuries the horse, the horse-drawn vehicle, the hand-made high-road, the
  parchment document, the public speaker and vocal teacher and a feeble coastal
  shipping had been the limiting conditions of all statecraft. Under these
  conditions the idea of the Empire had been the highest political idea in
  men's minds. Now, however, in that age of Renascence, the ocean which had
  been an ultimate barrier became almost suddenly a highway; and the printed
  book, and, presently, the newspaper quickened masses in the community,
  hitherto politically ineffective, into informed activity. The politics and
  statecraft of Europe, obsessed&mdash;still to this day obsessed&mdash;by the
  doomed Imperial tradition, began nevertheless a clumsy slow adaptation to
  this process of material change, unable to ignore its pressures and
  compulsions, but evidently indisposed to recognise its nature.</p>

  <p>I use this word "indisposed" deliberately. The political mind, like the
  legal mind to which it is so closely akin, looks backward habitually, prefers
  precedents to Utopias, clings to the old and is pushed along by the new.
  Europe clings still to the Imperial tradition four centuries after it became
  impracticable; its kindred peoples are divided and they destroy one another
  in the feuds of a dead issue. Frenchman and German waste Europe, as Asia
  Minor was wasted by Byzantine and Persian, in a futile search for a kind of
  supremacy that can never return to this world. They are like rivals who fight
  for a woman already dead and decayed.</p>

  <p>Continental Europe is being desolated and destroyed by imaginative
  incapacity, by the failure to recognise the obsolescence of its political
  ideas and traditions. But Europe is not the world, nor will its decline and
  fall be the end of the human story. In the United States of America, in this
  so-called British Empire, and now in the United States of Russia, we must
  recognise a breaking away from tradition as complete as when the Roman Empire
  broke away from the forms and traditions of any previous political synthesis.
  These new systems arise not to inherit, but to supersede.</p>

  <p>It is this conception of the history of the world during the last four
  centuries as being essentially, in its broadest aspects, a belated, forced,
  and largely unconscious process of political adaptation to changing
  conditions, of vast subconscious and unwilling trials and experiments in new
  and greater political associations to replace that formerly dominant Imperial
  idea, that I wish to put before the readers of the Empire Review. It carries
  us on to the further realisation that since the process of change in
  communications is only now approaching some sort of limiting completion, the
  new political systems that have appeared cannot be considered as anything but
  preliminary and transitory systems. The United States of America, the
  Spanish, Dutch and British colonial empires of the eighteenth century, the
  Russian Asiatic Empire and the second British Empire of the nineteenth
  century, the British Empire of the Empire Review and of this present
  discussion, must all from the angle of this conception be seen as things
  experimental and transient, destined to the most extensive coalescences,
  readjustments and modifications in a few score years. The form to which these
  synthetic material forces, this constant abolition of distance between State
  and State and man and man, are driving us all, even in spite of ourselves, is
  a common Pax Mundi, a World Commonweal, a federal suppression of armaments, a
  federal money system, a federal postal system, a federal control of the
  production and distribution of staple products, a federal direction of
  main-line sea and land transport and of the movements of population. To these
  things it seems to me human affairs trend now inexorably. The economic and
  financial world net grows tighter and closer; war becomes so intimate and
  inconclusive and destructive as to become impossible. The old ideas may hold
  our race in a bloody and wasteful subjection for two or three centuries yet;
  but the Pax Mundi waits at the end of the passage.</p>

  <p>A man holding these opinions must necessarily judge the present British
  Empire without any fanatical loyalty, critically as a possible half-way house
  or a possible obstacle to a more comprehensive and enduring synthesis. It is
  not really the same thing as the British "Empire" of 1823, which was a string
  of trading posts and areas of economic predominance about the world, plus
  John Company's fantastic acquisition of the derelict rule of the Great Mogul.
  The bulk of the present British "Empire" was created and held together by the
  steamship. This rendered possible the transfer of considerable masses of
  population to new territories and the importation of bulky staples, of such
  things as wheat and cattle, across great stretches of ocean. The Dominions
  were made by the steamship and the telegraphic cable, and they constitute the
  freshest, most peculiar feature of the present British Imperial system.
  Colonies the world has known before, but neither the Greek and Phoenician
  colonies of the old world nor the American colonies of the eighteenth century
  were linked closely and abundantly enough to the mother country to prevent a
  final estrangement and detachment. The British Dominions to-day are, on the
  contrary, kept in touch, and more and more effectively kept in touch, with
  each other and the mother country. Their mutual relationships are
  unprecedented. Their unity may be enduring.</p>

  <p>But when we turn to the relationship of Great Britain and these Dominions
  on the one hand, to India on the other, we find something entirely different,
  a new association also, but of absolutely different structure and different
  capabilities, something accidental and precarious and manifestly provisional.
  A London company running a system of trading stations, acquired almost
  inadvertently amidst a wild political welter in India, the heritage of the
  Great Mogul. Great Britain has taken over this company's possessions,
  enlarged them, given India peace and a certain unity, educated her people,
  but not widely nor sufficiently, developed her resources, but not very
  generously, and manifestly has but the vaguest ideas of her future. The
  educational and intellectual development of the British people has not kept
  pace with this rapid expansion of British responsibilities. Our world
  responsibilities have increased a hundredfold in the last century, but our
  educated class, our supply of potential rulers, directors and the like, our
  university organisations have not increased tenfold.</p>

  <p>It is an open question whether on the whole we have most hampered or
  benefited India. Or vice versa. But at any rate it must be clear that the
  association of the Indian system with the Dominion system is an accidental
  and transitory association. They both happen to be parts of the British
  system, but there is no necessary connection. The two move at different rates
  and in divergent directions. A man may be&mdash;I know Australians w^ho
  are&mdash;what I may call a Dominion-imperialist, but not an
  Indian-imperialist. He may believe, as I do, in the need for a sedulous
  preservation and intensification of the intellectual community of the
  English-speaking peoples, and in an attentive care for every possibility of
  understanding and sympathetic co-operation with the United States of America,
  and at the same time he may be as convinced as I am of our duty and
  obligation to educate and organise India as speedily as possible for
  separation, for a friendly independent existence within the world commonweal
  of peoples.</p>

  <p>We British have not sufficient natural moral and intellectual superiority
  to the Indian peoples, we have not a sufficiently organised educational
  system nor a sufficient surplus of highly educated men, to justify our
  continued usurpation of India's right to think out and work out its own role
  in the confederation of mankind. And we are different from these dusky
  peoples; we do not work with them easily; we hamper them and they hamper us
  intolerably. But released from our entanglement with a population six or
  seven times as numerous as our own, our entanglement with this great mix-up
  of temperamentally alien peoples, the British and the associated
  English-speaking communities scattered round the earth, extending their
  educational organisation and developing their still crude intellectual and
  political possibilities, may play a reasonable and yet leading part in the
  great synthesis which will ultimately give the world enduring peace.
  "Disentangle from India, draw near to America, come out of and keep out of
  ententes and alliances upon the continent of Europe;" these are the broad
  lines upon which I conceive the British system may best serve itself and
  mankind.</p>

  <p>So far I have considered the British Empire only from the point of view of
  the English-speaking Dominions and of India. I will leave Egypt and
  Palestine, as they ought to be left, outside the discussion. They are, I take
  it, relaxing protectorates. Nor will I say more than a word or so about
  purely strategic possessions, Malta, Gibraltar and so forth; they are part of
  our armament, and their destiny is dependent upon the possibility of a world
  association sufficiently convincing to make disarmament possible. But there
  still remain great areas that are neither populated by kindred communities
  nor subject civilisations, barbaric regions that have been taken over in
  order to exploit their natural resources and prevent their being monopolised
  and closed against us by some hostile power. The great overseas "Empire" of
  Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was of this type. Such areas
  of economic subjugation are a very ancient type of foreign possession. In
  such a spirit Carthage once held Corsica, Sardinia and a large part of Spain.
  In our own lives we have witnessed the sharing-out of tropical Africa among
  competing European powers. Behind such division and ownership lies the
  conception of bitterly competitive, monopolistic trading States as the
  supreme form of human association. That again is an obsolescent
  conception.</p>

  <p>The Americans decided a century and a half ago that one necessary
  condition of existence for a federal union of sovereign States was universal
  free trade. All interference with the free movement of another community's
  trade, all tariff barriers and the like, are a mild form of war. It must be
  plain to everyone that the present division of Africa is extremely unstable,
  and that if the system of competitive powers in Europe is to go on, it is
  only a question of how long it will take France to feel secure enough against
  Germany to set about fighting for the whole of raw-material Africa. The
  organised peace of the world, the coming world civilisation, demands not only
  a cessation of armaments, but a cessation of commercial discrimination and
  such-like material injuries.</p>

  <p>But these areas of undeveloped natural resources of unexploited forests
  and minerals and the like, sustaining only a sparse or undercivilised
  population, must have administration and development from without. If that is
  not to be the dangerous task and privilege of a single exploiting State it
  must be the task of some as yet non-existent body acting in the common
  interest. Until that federal body can be developed and equipped with forces
  and resources of its own&mdash;it is the most urgent of all necessary
  precautions against a future great war&mdash;there is nothing for us to do
  but to go on holding these possessions of the third order, without trading
  discrimination or settlement discrimination, against any other race or
  people.</p>

  <p>It is part of the fantastic nationalism that still plays so astonishing a
  role in the political life of the world, to hold that every definable region
  of the earth's surface belongs, from sky to centre, to the inhabitants it
  supports. But with ever increasing facilities of movement this becomes
  constantly more impossible. It would, for example, place the vast mineral
  wealth of Labrador at the disposal of a few hundred wandering Red Indians.
  The conception of a federated world system carries with it the idea that all
  the land and sea of the world, all the natural resources of the world,
  animal, vegetable or mineral, belong to all the people of the world, and that
  any assignation, reservation, mandate or monopolisation of this or that
  region is entirely a temporary arrangement to be superseded by that
  inevitable world control. The British "Empire" in respect to this class of
  possession is, therefore, in the position of a trustee for an unborn but
  inevitable heir. Any Federation of Peoples or League of Nations or whatnot
  that really undertakes the organisation of a world peace must, as a necessary
  function, inherit all the overseas and alien possessions that are not yet
  capable of an intelligent participation in world government, whether they are
  now "owned" by Great Britain or by any other State in the world.</p>

  <p>In any world federation that may arise in the course of the next century
  or so, the English-speaking communities, which already number over two
  hundred million people, must necessarily play a leading part. How far it will
  be the leading part, depends very much upon the educational and general
  creative energy of these communities during the years immediately before us
  and upon their power of casting aside crippling prejudices and outworn
  ideas.</p>

  <p>It needs no impossible effort to make the English language even now the
  lingua franca of India and China, and the creative imagination embodied in
  English literature a fertilising power throughout the earth. If I as a
  consistent republican find little joy in being a subject of a King-Emperor,
  and if I find much of our British Imperialism repulsively base, narrow,
  short-sighted and suicidal, that is rather because I overestimate than
  underestimate the share that our English language and civilisation and
  peoples may play in the future of mankind.</p>

  <h2><a id="art09"
     name="art09">WINSTON</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">10.11.1923</p>

  <p class="first">IN this tragic and confused world it has been my undeserved
  lot to lead an amused life. All sorts of bright and entertaining and likable
  things have been given me and paraded before me. And among others is my
  friend, Mr. Winston Churchill: not the American Winston but the British
  Winston. Our relations are relations of intermittent but I trust affectionate
  controversy. We had a great slanging match some years ago about Russia, and
  if I remember rightly Mr. Churchill took the count. That is my pleasant
  impression of the affair. His may be different, of course. Then, in a little
  book called Men Like Gods, one of the characters got out of my control and
  began to speak and act in a way so like Mr. Churchill's that even I could see
  the resemblance. I was shocked and alarmed. I had to stun that character and
  hustle it out of the way, but not before it had made a long characteristic
  speech and started a war....</p>

  <p>Now Mr. Churchill has taken the opportunity afforded by an article I wrote
  about the British Empire for the British Empire Review to open up a fight
  again. My article, more or less abbreviated, in some cases shorn of its chief
  arguments, and adorned with the unsolicited crossheads so dear to editors of
  spirit, has been extensively syndicated in America, and will no doubt be
  followed round the earth by flying fragments of his reply. It is a spirited
  and amusing reply. He calls me Citizen Hoopdriver, which is a fair return for
  the misbehaviour of my fictitious character, and he laments my discursiveness
  because I will not stick to my proper occupation of imaginative
  fiction&mdash;which from a gentleman much younger than myself who has danced
  in turn through Admiralty, War Office, Munitions Ministry, Air Ministry,
  Colonies and Board of Trade, who has been a brilliant cavalry officer and a
  still more brilliant newspaper correspondent, who has written eight or nine
  large but entertaining books and painted some excellent pictures, is pretty
  considerable cheek. But let that pass.</p>

  <p>My original article on the British Empire which appeared in the Empire
  Review pointed out things that are manifest to everyone but the most besotted
  Imperialist; that the present British Empire is a thing of yesterday, that it
  is excessively unstable, and that it is bound to undergo great changes and
  reconstructions in the near future. An Imperial Conference has been
  struggling in London with the most urgent aspects of these pressing changes.
  And I should have thought that anyone above the level of a patriotic
  schoolboy would have seen that any rational constructive change must be in
  the direction of knitting up the sprawling British system with its kindred
  civilisations, and especially with the United States of America, in some form
  of mutual support and co-operation. But Mr. Churchill, regardless of the
  article he is pretending to criticise, and of all my attacks on the present
  League of Nations, pretends that I want to put the British Empire forthwith
  under a world federation upon which Belgians, Chinese, Peruvians, Hottentots,
  and so forth are to be in a crushing majority. "In this sublime conception,"
  he writes in his caustic way, "the British inheritance accumulated by the
  thrift and effort of so many centuries would be liquidated and generously
  shared with all nations."</p>

  <p>Now this is the poorest of platform nonsense. It is not only nonsense
  about my proposals, but nonsense about the Empire. The sooner we clear our
  minds of such cant about thrift and age-long development the better. Putting
  it as gently as possible, the present British Empire is not an inheritance
  but a series of&mdash;shall we say acquisitions?&mdash;and mostly very recent
  acquisitions. What is the good of canting in the face of facts? We didn't
  save up India; Australia wasn't the reward of abstinence.</p>

  <p>The British Empire of a hundred years ago was a mere set of scattered
  trading-stations and a bit of the present Indian Empire. The present British
  Empire has been assembled by means of the oceangoing steamship and the
  railway in the last hundred years, and much of it in the last fifty. Beside
  the Dutch colonial empire it is a thing of yesterday. The steamship made it
  and maintains it. It is cemented by steamships. If the steamship is presently
  superseded by the air-liner the British Empire will become like a wall whose
  mortar has decayed. But Mr. Churchill will hear nothing of new buttresses and
  sounder binding for this adventitious band of States.</p>

  <p>He goes on to a denunciation of my republicanism. Ignoring steamships,
  banking, Imperial Preference, and a common language, he declares the only
  sure link of the Empire is "the golden circle of an ancient crown." I would
  hate to say anything in detraction of a devoted and indefatigable royal
  family, but I do not believe that there is any effective imperial binding
  force in the cult of snobbery and sentiment, of which its members are at once
  the divinities and the sacrificial victims. The healthy natural man is a
  republican, and has a stiff backbone. Nobody really loves or respects a
  courtier. One of the chief troubles in the Irish settlement has been the
  excessive distaste of many Irishmen for the forms of royalty. One of the
  chief barriers between the British and closer co-operation with America is
  this king-business. The true cement of our communities must be the sense of
  equal brotherhood and common aims.</p>

  <p>After that Mr. Churchill lapses into sheer naughtiness. There are times
  when the evil spirit comes upon him and when I can think of him only as a
  very intractable little boy, a mischievous, dangerous little boy, a
  knee-worthy little boy. Only by thinking of him in that way can one go on
  liking him. Suddenly he breaks out about Russia, and I am reminded that he
  has been one of the chief afflictions of that unfortunate country, that he
  was largely responsible for the waste of scores of million pounds of British
  money, in arming first one brigand chief and then another to attack and
  further devastate our war-exhausted ally.</p>

  <p>He is still unrepentant. He declares that I was a passionate and am now a
  disappointed pro-Bolshevik, although I have always been an austere critic and
  witness of Bolshevik incompetence and unpracticalness. But I have also borne
  my witness to the fact that the Bolshevik leaders are mainly honest men,
  fighting against stupendous difficulties and leading hard lives, and that the
  Russian people would far rather have them as its rulers than any of the
  vicious, plundering, pogromming White Hopes and Czarist reactionaries
  patronised by Mr. Churchill. These Russians have fought against tremendous
  difficulties against invading Japanese, Poles, Estonians, French-subsidised
  invaders and British-subsidised invaders, and against famine and a pitiless
  blockade, and against their own ignorance and the atrociously rough and cruel
  legacy of Czarism, and it seems as if after all they will pull through and
  lay the foundations of a renascent Russia.</p>

  <p>And this is the handful of mud this English statesman hurls at the
  struggling rulers of this great land with which we are at peace. "They are
  just a selfish, plundering crew of tyrants and parasites who descended upon
  an unhappy land and enslaved or slaughtered its people, soiled its honour,
  ruined its prosperity, devoured its substance, and enriched themselves and
  their female belongings."</p>

  <p>That about the "female belongings" isn't at all the little gentleman. It
  is not even honest abuse. He knows better. Indeed, we all know better, and
  why Mr. Churchill keeps up this sort of thing defeats my imagination. Russia
  is a strained and needy country to-day, but it is bleakly moral; for a time
  there was no prostitution at all there, and probably even to-day there is
  less prostitution in Russia than in any other country in the world; the age
  when getting rich and "feminine belongings" played a large part in its
  affairs ended with Rasputin and the Czardom. But Mr. Churchill has assumed
  this attitude of vehement hostility to the present Russian Government, and he
  persists in it with puerile obstinacy, while that great country passes slowly
  out of the shadows he helped to darken into the dawn of a new age.</p>

  <h2><a id="art10"
     name="art10">THE OTHER SIDE IN FRANCE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">17.11.1923</p>

  <p class="first">IN several recent articles I have been girding at France, at
  the destructive egotism of France, at the relentless political cruelty of
  France. Let me now look at France from another aspect.</p>

  <p>Many of us, I suspect, are excessively bitter with France just now because
  we love France. We are angry because we are jealous about her. She has seen
  fit to embody herself in the dull, relentless Poincaré; she has set her face
  like flint harshly and pitilessly against the recovery and peace of Europe,
  and it is more than we can endure.</p>

  <p>A few months ago I made a little tour in Europe, and outside the
  boundaries of France everywhere I found the name of France the name of
  division and mischief. The mark had not yet reached its final degradation,
  but I went about in a very miserable Germany. Every attempt that Germany made
  to get to her feet and breathe was met by a thrust that sent her back into
  the black waters that are drowning her. It was natural for Germany to be
  resentful. But in the farther countries, also, resentment smouldered; they
  were carrying great armies&mdash; the Czech Army is now greater than the
  British&mdash;they were subjected to a propaganda of an intense and dangerous
  nationalism, their future was dark with war possibilities, and it was all the
  work of France. I came back to France through a Europe dying of entangled
  nationalist policies, and my heart was very black against France.</p>

  <p>I went about Paris for some days astonished to see that it did not look
  consciously wicked. After all&mdash;much as I love my native London and much
  as I delight in the tall vigour of New York&mdash;Paris is the Queen of
  Cities, so gracious and so fine, so hospitably friendly and yet so little
  meretricious in her quality. I met French friends and talked with them
  abundantly. I went into Burgundy and into Touraine to meet old friends and
  new ones, and gradually my nightmare conception of France as an evil spider,
  stretching its poison claws all over Europe, was mitigated.</p>

  <p>That spider is there. It is the old spider of French foreign policy that
  has lived on through revolutions and empires since the days of the Grand
  Monarch, but within its limbs it holds so great a literary man as Anatole
  France, so modern and bold an adventurer in statecraft as Joseph Caillaux, so
  gentle and sincere a liberalism as that of the gatherings of the Abbaye de
  Pontigny, and, indeed, a whole inarticulate France of thought, doubt, and
  righteous intention. It is a France that may at any time thrust Poincaré
  aside and break through to speech and action and become the France. It is an
  essential and leading part of that world-wide republic of reasonable men
  which may yet save the world.</p>

  <p>I wanted very much to look at and talk to M. Joseph Caillaux. He has
  always interested me deeply. I had to make a four-hour automobile journey to
  see him. I went past Chartres Cathedral, and the roads were gay with blue
  flowers. He is living in his pleasant house and garden in a little brown and
  white and green provincial town, and there he is stifled and silenced. He may
  not go within a hundred kilometres of Paris, nor may he go abroad. What he
  has got to say is not reported in the Press. Only by way of the bookshop can
  he get anything through to the public. Imagine our British Foreign Office
  sending my Lord Rothermere into exile and original authorship at Llandrindod
  Wells or Matlock on account of his interference with its policy! Imagine Mr.
  Lloyd George or Lord Birkenhead restrained from excursions to America, and
  deprived altogether of reverberation!</p>

  <p>I lunched with M. and Madame Caillaux and some pleasant neighbours, and we
  talked of books and flowers and such-like agreeable topics. We exchanged
  telegraphic greetings with M. Anatole France, whom I had hoped to meet there.
  M. Caillaux, I learnt incidentally, can take walks and play tennis, but he
  may not go shooting. He is far too dangerous a man, the French Government
  thinks, to be entrusted with a shot-gun.</p>

  <p>Afterwards we two walked about the garden and talked about the state of
  Europe. M. Caillaux is neither Anglophile nor Anglophobe, but he thinks, as I
  do, that Western Europe can only do its full duty to the rest of the world
  when it is worked as a unity. Reconciliation of the Frenchman and the German
  has been the dominant idea of all his statecraft. We discussed the riddle why
  Big Business and the big industrialists are the fiercest, most mischievous of
  all patriots. We concluded it was due to the fact that they work for profits
  and not for service, and that a flag means a tariff and such an artificial
  enhancement of profits as no unified working could give. And finance which is
  international in outlook is by its nature not creative and revolutionary but
  watchful, statistical, and extractive. Then also I broached the question
  whether, if private capital in industry and finance could not give us peace,
  we must prepare for a harder road to internationalism through the social
  revolution. And so to other topics.</p>

  <p>He asked me not to be hard against France. "You think," he said, "that
  this fear of Germany coming back again is a false fear&mdash;an excuse for
  aggression. It isn't. It's in the blood of our people. Think! Here we are in
  the heart of France, and within a little more than a hundred years this
  countryside has heard the guns of an invader four times, in 1814, 1815, 1871,
  and again in 1914."</p>

  <p>M. Caillaux stood before his house and watched me get into the automobile
  that would take me to the Paris he may not visit, and waved his friendly
  "Good-bye." Next year, perhaps, they will let him return, he hopes&mdash;or
  the year after. But he is already sixty....</p>

  <p>But the most interesting man from my present point of view that I met in
  France was a man under no outward restraint at all. This was the late M.
  Philippe Millet, the editor of the <i>Petit Parisien</i>, one of the big
  official papers. We have been friends for many years, we saw a good deal of
  each other at the Washington Conference, and we had talked to each other very
  freely and frankly on many occasions about international relations. For long
  he had maintained an entirely civilised attitude towards the European
  settlement; he had supported various schemes of economic reconciliation, and
  he had opposed the occupation of the Ruhr very vigorously, I took him to task
  for his support of M. Poincaré.</p>

  <p>His apologetics went in this fashion, and I think they are typical of the
  attitude of a considerable section of Frenchmen. He admitted the Ruhr
  occupation was an outrage, but he argued that once it was done it closed the
  door on any possibility of an understanding with Germany. Germany had been so
  antagonised that there was now nothing left for a Frenchman but to go on
  destroying her. He was like a man on an omnibus that was running away
  downhill. You must do your best to get control of the thing, but&mdash;there
  is no going back to the top of the hill, France has got Germany by the
  throat, and such a level of hate and despair has been reached that she dares
  not let go.</p>

  <p>Of course, M. Poincaré does not want to let go. But I believe the middling
  mass of Frenchmen, of whom Philippe Millet was so typical, a mass which, with
  the parties of the Left, probably constitutes a majority of the French, would
  welcome any outside help that would enable them to discontinue the
  strangulation and dismemberment of Central Europe. An American Government and
  a British Government united enough, understanding enough, and tactful enough,
  to intervene wisely and generously could swing all that central mass away
  from Poincaré. A foolish intervention might very easily throw it into a
  passion of patriotic fear. Its incalculable behaviour is a riddle all Europe
  is guessing at. The hope of European civilisation rests largely on this
  central body of French opinion getting to some sort of effective expression
  before it is too late. The French elections in 1924 will be a very crucial
  time in human history.</p>

  <h2><a id="art11"
     name="art11">THE LAST OF THE VICTORIANS</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">24.11.1923</p>

  <p class="first">MR. ASQUITH is now, to use the phrase he coined for a
  contemporary, the last of the Victorian "giants." He is the leader of some
  sort of Liberal Party in England, the oldest and the ripest, I am told,
  though I confess I am quite unable to make head or tail of these various
  Liberal parties in England nowadays, and he is always trying to lead his
  little band back to the nineteenth century, when there were ever so many
  "giants" in the land, not to mention the Grand Old Man, and when political
  life made up for its complete want of seriousness by a pompous solemnity and
  vast personal enthusiasms. Prime Ministers in those days loomed vast; they
  were none of your little chaps who can hide behind bull-dog pipes and say
  muffin. Our Leaders, figures of Pantomimic size, filled the stage and
  said&mdash;floods. They were practically all that there was on the stage. The
  crumbling peace of Europe and the world, the conflict of labour and order
  with adventurous capital, were not staged in those days. At most one heard of
  these things in the Legislature as one sometimes catches a rumble of vans and
  cabs in a London theatre. In the House they dealt with only the thin shadows
  of great issues; with the Free Breakfast Table, Unsectarian Religious
  Teaching, Leasehold Enfranchisement, and the like.</p>

  <p>One of the most pleasing traits of the Victorian giants was their
  tremendous scholarly evasion of all complete statement. The vulgarity of a
  plain assignment of a thing to its broad roots and general principles was
  never committed. In such matters Mr. Asquith is finely representative of his
  period. He has to perfection that ability to deal with a part of an issue as
  if it were the whole which was characteristic of the great Victorian scholars
  and gentlemen. If Mr. Asquith were a mechanic, and you asked him to make you
  an automobile, he would presently produce two wheels, a clutch, and a
  radiator with so perfect and dignified a manner that you would hardly realise
  that you had not the complete car until you stepped through it. You would
  feel it ungracious to complain. When Mr. Asquith drew the sword and threw
  away the scabbard, he did it with so fine a gesture that you scarcely noted
  that most of the sword wasn't there. If Mr. Asquith were a domestic hen he
  would lay eggs consisting of about two-thirds of a shell and as much yolk as
  would cover a sixpence, but he would cluck so bravely that you would credit
  him with a complete omelette. I do not blame him, it was the style of his
  time; but his time has passed, and this is a world too urgent and dangerous
  for the ample deficiencies of those spaciously empty years.</p>

  <p>These remarks are provoked by the fact that Mr. Asquith and his associated
  and rival Liberal leaders&mdash;I can never tell which is which&mdash;are now
  engaged in unfurling the Banner of Free Trade in Great Britain. Encumbered
  with an immense and growing burden of unemployed workmen Britain is thinking
  of all sorts of eleventh-hour expedients. Schemes of preference within the
  Empire, leading towards an Empire <i>Zollverein</i>, are very much to the
  fore. And in reply this old Free Trade, which figured so largely in the
  political history of Victorian times, is to be brought out of the shed again,
  and furbished up and sent round the country to see what it will do for
  Liberalism.</p>

  <p>Now nothing could be more typical than Free Trade of this peculiar
  incompleteness of the political methods of the "giants" of the "heroic"
  Victorian Age to which I have already called attention. It is a one-wheeled,
  engineless, body-less Liberal automobile. It is a project to keep down one's
  natural frontier in respect to inward and outward trade, and it ignores all
  the correlated measures that should go with this most desirable abolition. It
  ignores the fact that nearly all the separate sovereign competitive States
  into which the world is divided are always actively engaged in mutual injury,
  sometimes frankly in open warfare but always by fiscal trickery, monetary
  tactics, diversion of trade, and the like amiable activities. True Free Trade
  must be mutual. One-sided Free Trade is like disarmament in the face of
  malignant military preparation. And if there is to be real Free Trade between
  any two countries then certain other things follow necessarily, though they
  never appear on the party programmes and banners.</p>

  <p>Production will tend to gravitate to the regions of maximum advantage, and
  so there must also be a free movement of population over the frontiers to the
  regions of most advantageous employment. If there is not such free movement,
  then one of the States may suffer from unemployment in this or that industry
  and social degeneration while the other is enjoying high wages. But movement
  of population and the shifting of many industries across frontiers will
  affect military efficiency, and so there can be no real Free Trade between
  any two countries unless they are ensured not only against mutual attack but
  by a mutual guarantee against attack.</p>

  <p>Free Trade is, in fact, only a practical proposal between countries
  prepared also for free movements of population between each other and for a
  pooling of their defensive resources and foreign policy. The way to permanent
  and satisfactory Free Trade lies in a steady extension of leagues between
  friendly peoples prepared for that much waiver of their sovereign
  independence. But only peoples near the same educational level and with
  closely similar standards of comfort and behaviour can contemplate so
  intimate a union as this. There might be such a league of the Latin-American
  States, or of the English-speaking and Scandinavian and other North-European
  States, but not of any much more extensive coalescences at present. So long
  as a State remains potentially at war with any other State, Free Trade
  between them is a dream.</p>

  <p>Great Britain in the Victorian period had a practical monopoly of modern
  industrial production and benefited by an open frontier that gave her workers
  cheap food and so kept labour cheap. That was a temporary and now vanished
  condition of affairs. So long as States insist on their sovereign
  independence they must be prepared to use tariffs just as they must be
  prepared to use armies. It is the price of the flag.</p>

  <p>Tariffs corrupt. That is true, just as war contracts do. But the way to
  escape from these diseases of conflict does not lie in the maintenance of
  fiscal non-resistance by this or that independent, irresponsible State, but
  in a creative foreign policy that seeks union and coalescence, and aims,
  openly and educationally, through coalescence in a broadening series, to
  reach at last world Free Trade, world freedom of movement, and an organised
  world peace.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Asquith will never tell us he means anything so intelligible as
  that. He will just wave the banner of Free Trade as though it meant anything
  the imagination of the voter might like. That was how the giants did their
  business in the grand old days, and he will never do his business in any
  other way. And it is because of these splendid old traditions of pompous
  vagueness that more and more of the liberal-minded people of Britain drift
  towards the Labour camp.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="art12"
     name="art12">POLITICS AS A PUBLIC NUISANCE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">1.12.1923</p>

  <p class="first">IN the United States of America they know when their
  elections are coming, and prepare for them; in Great Britain they come
  unheralded, like earthquakes and tidal waves. They may come and come again;
  there is no period of immunity.</p>

  <p>It is only yesterday that in Great Britain we were all speculating about
  this Mr. Baldwin, who had become Prime Minister. What was he? Where had he
  come from? Nobody knew. From the first he seemed to share our doubts about
  himself. He hid as much as possible behind a big, big, manly pipe, and made
  wise little speeches about nothing in particular at colleges and boys'
  schools. He claimed to be a cousin of Mr. Rudyard Kipling. Now he seems to
  have given way to panic at the conspicuousness of his position. The European
  situation is frightful, and the state of affairs at home is miserable; and I
  think he has plunged this country into all the expense and confusion of a
  General Election, in the hope of getting back to the old smoking-room at
  home, wherever it is, and tranquillity.</p>

  <p>Except in Tasmania and Ireland, where they have Proportional
  Representation and an approach to political sanity, all the elections of the
  English-speaking democracies are profoundly silly affairs. The common voter
  hasn't a dog's chance of expressing his real opinion of things. Some
  organisations or other put up a couple of candidates for his constituency,
  and he votes for the one associated with the political leaders he dislikes
  and distrusts least. When the issues are manifold, as they are in Britain
  now, the results may be preposterous. They may fail altogether to indicate
  the feeling of the country about any public question at all. The voter is
  generally in the case of a man who wants to go shooting, and is confronted
  with the choice of taking the family Bible and some cartridges, or a boiled
  fowl and a gun.</p>

  <p>The cardinal fact of the contest is that France is destroying the economic
  life of Central Europe, with which the prosperity of Great Britain is bound
  up. Great Britain is congested with unemployed, before whom there does not
  seem to be any prospect of employment. In the face of this Mr. Baldwin
  proposes tariffs to make food and everything dearer without increasing the
  purchasing power of any but the very rich; and Mr. Ramsay MacDonald proposes
  a levy on large fortunes. Mr. Asquith, to whom Mr. Churchill the
  anti-Bolshevik and Mr. Lloyd George have rallied, raises, as I have already
  noted in these articles, the banner of Free Trade&mdash;although Free Trade
  is already in operation in Great Britain without conspicuous success. And
  nobody says anything in particular about France.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances anything may happen. Exaggerated estimates of
  the effect of the tariff upon food prices will be used to scare the
  struggling voter, and particularly the women, against Protection, and
  ¦&mdash;as the Labour Party has no Press worth talking about&mdash;tremendous
  lies will be told about the Capital Levy. It will be represented as a raid
  upon the savings bank deposits of the servant girl and the children's
  money-boxes, although as a matter of fact it is not to touch any fortune
  under five thousand pounds, and only begins to press heavily upon twenty
  thousand and upward. The Labour leaders, being for the most part respectable
  but inaudible men, will never get that over to the public in time. And in the
  ensuing panic and scrimmage it is quite possible that that extraordinary old
  omnibus, the Liberal Party, with Mr. Asquith the elder statesman, Mr.
  Churchill the junker, Mr. Lloyd George the rather world- stained democrat,
  Sir John Simon, Mr. Asquith's once prospective successor, and a miscellany of
  other people, pledged really to no more than the negative policy of no
  Protection and no Capital Levy, will make quite a respectable run and get
  quite a large proportion of its four hundred odd passengers into Westminster.
  And what they will do there Heaven knows. Possibly fight among themselves,
  and have another dissolution.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as the struggle for the wheel goes on, the British ship of
  state will drift through the winter as it has drifted through the autumn, and
  M. Poincaré will continue to do what he likes with Europe.</p>

  <p>Now this is really too preposterous a way of running the affairs of a
  great people. It is bound to end in some great disaster. These spasmodic
  appeals to the country whenever a Prime Minister gets frightened by the
  aspect of the skies or whenever a quarrelsome group has to be reunited
  somehow, produce a terrible vacillation and ineffectiveness in the national
  conduct. It is time Great Britain came up to date with a triennial or
  quadrennial election of the Legislature, after the American and French
  fashion, and then stayed put. And it is time, too, that Great Britain went
  beyond, and gave a lead to America and most of the world by abandoning the
  present method of voting with a single vote in a limited constituency, which
  absolutely destroys any real choice of representation by the common man. The
  only civilised method of democracy is Proportional Representation; in large
  constituencies returning many members there is no other method which gives
  the individual voter a reasonable opportunity of expressing his real
  preference. It is the right way, and all other ways are wrong and bad. This
  present election in Great Britain is the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the
  current system. In the seething mass of British opinion there are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Out-and-out Protectionists hostile to Russia and France.</li>

    <li>Ditto friendly to Russia but hostile to France.</li>

    <li>Ditto hostile to Russia but abject to France.</li>

    <li>Protectionists for industry but not for food, hostile to France.</li>

    <li>Ditto, but "Hats off to France."</li>

    <li>Anti-Bolshevik Free Traders like Mr. Churchill.</li>

    <li>Free Traders friendly to Russia.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Any of the above may or may not be in frantic opposition to an imaginary
  Capital Levy upon everybody's savings.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Labourite Free Traders weak on the Capital Levy.</li>

    <li>Labourite Free Traders strong on the Capital Levy.</li>

    <li>Labourites strong on the Capital Levy, but weak on Free Trade.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All of the above may be weak or strong or hostile about the present League
  of Nations.</p>

  <p>All of the above may be strong for the new education, or they may be anti-
  educational.</p>

  <p>And the poor mutt of a voter in any particular constituency has to
  indicate his opinion of things by voting for one of three gentlemen or ladies
  selected by the three local political clubs. As candidates they will do as
  little as possible in the way of positive statements and pledges. They will
  engage chiefly in hostile noises against the other parties. We shall never
  get any clear indication from this election upon any issue of any importance
  at all. We shall get no clear mandate either to deal with France or submit to
  France. We shall get no clear indication of the feelings of the people about
  Protection or Free Trade. We shall have only a slight measure of the panic
  about the Capital Levy caused by its misrepresentation. The thing is silly.
  It is a monstrous foolery in the face of the needs and dangers of the present
  time. The new Parliament will be just as feeble and insecure as the old
  Parliament, just as uncertain of popular support, and just as incapable of
  taking a strong line in the tragic pass to which British affairs are
  coming.</p>

  <h2><a id="art13"
     name="art13">THE RE-EMERGENCE OF MR. LLOYD GEORGE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">8.12.1923</p>

  <p class="first">That muddle-headed process, the General Election, is over in
  Great Britain; the votes have been counted and the results are out&mdash;and
  everybody now is free to speculate what it was that the British Demos was
  trying to say to the world.</p>

  <p>The idiotic simplicity of the voting method employed leaves the
  intelligent observer entirely free to put whatever interpretation he likes
  upon these results, and the British and foreign Press are taking the fullest
  advantage of this freedom. Confronted by a complex of issues and two or three
  usually very unpalatable candidates, the poor voter has voted anyhow or
  abstained from voting. Poor Demos might just as well have stayed away from
  the polls altogether for any chance he has had of expressing himself about
  France or about Russia or about the Singapore dockyards or anything of
  positive importance in the outer world. The single nontransferable vote
  system which prevails in the British communities and in America is almost as
  good a political gag as the old Russian autocracy, and may in the end provoke
  as violent a reaction. One may conclude that a great number of women voters
  were scared by the thought of high prices under a Tariff, and that the
  Capital Levy is not the bogy it promised to be. We shall have no Tariff.
  Beyond that there are no clear indications of the Will of the People.</p>

  <p>So instructed, Parliament reassembles.</p>

  <p>The chief result of the convulsion is that Mr. Lloyd George is back in the
  middle of the limelight in his original role of a great Liberal leader.
  Gestures of reconciliation of an almost scandalous warmth have characterised
  all the chief Liberal gatherings, and it is a wonder to the rest of mankind
  that British Liberalism ever permitted even an appearance of dissension. And
  Mr. Lloyd George has completely and triumphantly come back. It is his victory
  as much as it is anybody's victory.</p>

  <p>Like nearly all Welshmen and many Englishmen, I have a strong but
  qualified affection for Mr. Lloyd George. How far that affection is due to
  Mr. Lloyd George's own merits, and how far it is due to the endearing
  caricatures of Low, I will not attempt to determine. But we like his go and
  we like his bounce and we like his smile. Unless he is caught vociferating a
  speech, all his photographs, even the most casual snapshots, show him smiling
  the most disarming of smiles. All Englishmen, except perhaps the Duke of
  Northumberland, are radicals, subverters, equalitarians, and revolutionaries,
  though very many of us restrain and conceal these qualities, and in some they
  are altogether subconscious. (I say "Englishmen" here, and I do not add
  "Englishwomen.") In Mr. Lloyd George&mdash;particularly when he smiles or
  makes a peer&mdash;we recognise our dearest suppressions. His creations
  roused the elder peerage at last to open revolt, and that amused us. Were it
  not for him and the new newspaper adventurers of the last quarter-century,
  Britain would still be ruled by the Cecils and Society.</p>

  <p>America, I suspect, feels much the same about him. In the United States
  they pick him out from among all other figures in British politics as theirs.
  He is much more in the American than the British tradition. Ever so many
  American statesmen began as provincial lawyers. The journey from that Welsh
  solicitor's office to Whitehall is the nearest parallel British political
  life has yet given to the Log Cabin to White House adventure.</p>

  <p>And Mr. Lloyd George has never had a classical education. He can quote
  Welsh but not Greek. A contempt for learning&mdash;that is to say, for
  classical learning&mdash;is another of the hidden things in the soul of every
  ordinary Englishman and every plain American. We know secretly that stuff is
  an imposture. But we never argue about it&mdash;even when Mr. President
  Coolidge betrays a belief that an ordinary classical education involves an
  understanding of human history. We know in our bones that it does not. It is
  not that we despise knowledge, but that we do not believe that a little Greek
  and Latin and a few worn quotations are knowledge. And on the whole Mr. Lloyd
  George is a very knowledgeable man.</p>

  <p>In no sense of the word, of course, is he an educated man. Lincoln was.
  Starting from an almost illiterate adolescence, Lincoln, by an industrious
  self-education, achieved wisdom, achieved a profound and comprehensive
  perception of world realities; his mind could handle at last anything the
  mind of a President of men ever had to handle with supreme mastery. But Mr.
  Lloyd George has never built up a strong and comprehensive body of ideas in
  that fashion. He has never realised the need. His mind has not the solid
  substance of Lincoln's mind. It is a quick feminine mind, with extremely
  rapid intuitions. His judgments are apt to be as just as they are quick, but
  he has never got them together into any system. They are immediate and
  superficial. He is mentally disconnected. He retains the prejudices and
  general ideas of his upbringing. He has no vision or sense of the world as a
  whole, no worked -out conception of the part he might play in the human
  story. So it was that opportunity caught him at Versailles and laid him
  bare.</p>

  <p>Within two years of the signing of that treaty, for which he was mainly
  responsible, he had learnt better and was trying in his quite feminine
  indirect way to mitigate and undo it. He will go on trying.</p>

  <p>He means well&mdash;always. And he was almost the first statesman of the
  Coalition Government to realise the folly of an inveterate quarrel with New
  Russia. In dealing with Russia he will be unhampered by that violent
  anti-Bolshevik, Mr. Winston Churchill, who is again among the "outs." His
  inconsistencies trouble the common British voter hardly at all. The logical
  Frenchman points to his broken pledges. This from the French point of view
  constitutes dishonesty. The Anglo-Saxon mind realises that to be honest one
  must be inconsistent. We have all made our mistakes, and muddled back out of
  them. Life is a puzzling thing full of surprises. The one thing the British
  will never understand is the tremendous persistence of M. Poincaré. It
  impresses them as invincible stupidity.</p>

  <p>Both Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Winston Churchill denounced Socialism, but
  while Mr. Churchill really meant Socialism by Socialism, Mr. Lloyd George
  only meant a tendency to vote for Labour instead of for Lloyd George. By
  nature and tradition Mr. Lloyd George is on the Left side in politics, and
  his experience of Tories and rich men during the last few years has probably
  restored his leftward tendencies to their primitive vigour. As his record in
  the Ministry of Munitions shows, he has no respect for money: he throws it
  about, he can be careless and rough with it, it is a means to an end, and he
  has probably accumulated very little. Returned to power and faced by a
  spectacle of economic debacle, he is capable of taxing, levying upon, and
  confiscating the property of the rich to an extent that would make Mr.
  Henderson white with terror and throw Mr. Ramsay MacDonald into convulsions
  of Scotch caution. (But mark you, it won't be Socialism. He is against
  Socialism.)</p>

  <p>So Mr. Lloyd George emerges again from his temporary eclipse seated on the
  back of a united Liberal Party and already leaning a little to the Left. As
  the world situation develops he will probably lean more and more to the Left.
  Until he leans right over the Socialist programme. He has with him the
  affectionate distrust of a great multitude of his countrymen. They like his
  smile, have a profound sympathy for his tendencies, and wish they knew more
  of his intentions. He is by far the most vigorous and popular personality in
  the new House. He may do anything. This election that has reunited the
  Liberal Party in his interest has cost the country over two million pounds.
  We trust him to give us a show for our money.</p>

  <h2><a id="art14"
     name="art14">SPAIN AND ITALY WHISPER TOGETHER</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">15.12.1923</p>

  <p class="first">The noise of the British General Election subsides, and we
  realise that a crisis of supreme insignificance to the world in general is
  over. The affair has had much the same importance as a wayside epileptic fit.
  The patient falls into convulsive movements, emits strange noises. Presently
  it is all over, and the patient seems very little the worse for it. Britain's
  herself again, and nobody can tell what it meant at all. One can only hope
  that there will not be another fit for some time. But there is no knowing.
  Great Britain is subject to these fits.</p>

  <p>The space and attention that long-established custom has directed to these
  manifestations has a little distracted attention from an event of much
  greater significance: the coming together of Spain and Italy.</p>

  <p>It became inevitable when President Poincaré made his speech about Black
  France, probably the most stupid speech ever made by a responsible statesman.
  There were Frenchmen who saw in his policy the certainty of a final isolation
  face to face with a Germany driven to desperation. He rebuked them for their
  fears. There were not forty million Frenchmen, he said, but a hundred
  million. He called in sixty million Africans to redress the balance of the
  population in Europe. He directed the attention of all the world to the
  steady progress of the Black French policy. For this the French were building
  their submarines, to protect their transports on their way from Africa to
  France. That was admitted even in 1921 at Washington. But now all Europe
  turns its eyes to the great railway developments of France in Africa, and
  sees the material confirmation of President Poincaré's threat. These railways
  are plainly not development railways; they are strategic railways. They are
  as surely strategic railways as the lines the German Imperialists made to the
  Belgian frontier.</p>

  <p>That White France that so many Americans and English love like a second
  motherland, the White France of the Great Revolution, of Lafayette and
  Mirabeau, of Voltaire and Pasteur and Anatole France, France the propagandist
  of liberty, equality, and fraternity throughout the world, France the
  guardian of art and of personal freedom and of the gracious life, passes into
  eclipse beneath this black shadow. Black France is ousting her from men's
  imaginations and sympathies.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Italy and Spain to see this scheme coming into
  reality under their eyes without an intense repulsion. Response on their part
  followed almost automatically. The French organisation of North Africa
  jostles both Italy and Spain intolerably. The fragmentation of Germany, the
  impoverishment of England, will leave both these countries, if they remain
  disunited, in a position of helplessness under the domination of what all
  Europe is coming to regard as the most egoistic of nations. Any reasonably
  intelligent boy of sixteen who had followed the course of events could have
  told President Poincaré that the necessary result of his Black French policy
  and his Black France speech would be an understanding between Italy and Spain
  for joint preparations to cut the umbilical cord between France in Europe and
  France in Africa whenever a due occasion might arise.</p>

  <p>A glance at a map of Europe will show how comparatively easy it would be
  to do that. The Balearic Isles of Spain are less than two hundred miles from
  Italian Sardinia. Across that line the transports bringing the Africans to
  Europe must go&mdash;four hundred miles of open sea. Confronted with the map
  that stream of transports pouring black troops into France is seen to be the
  most foolish dream that has ever corrupted the policy of a great nations.
  Neither Spain nor Italy nor Britain, nor, indeed, mankind at large, can allow
  it. They cannot afford to allow it.</p>

  <p>Yet it is upon this project, doomed beforehand, that the whole forward
  policy of France has rested and rests to-day. Two virtual dictators,
  Mussolini and General de Rivera, talk quietly together and look at it, and it
  begins to fade.</p>

  <p>That is the obvious significance of this recent visit of King Alfonso with
  his minister to Rome. But more than that one paramount question seems to have
  been discussed. Both Spain and Italy are still in form constitutional
  monarchies modelled or remodelled in the nineteenth century on the not very
  congenial British pattern&mdash;which in that time was the political fashion
  everywhere. Recent events have thrust the monarchs of both countries a little
  aside in favour of virtual dictators. Except for the persistence of the
  crown, both Italy and Spain have taken on a new resemblance to the republics
  of Latin America. Those countries seem to find their natural form of
  political expression neither in royal rule nor in parliamentary forms, but in
  some sort of dictator-president. The social and intellectual life and
  probably the political thought of Latin America may be in as close touch and
  may even be in closer touch with the European mother countries than is the
  case between Great Britain and her Dominions. There is a great Italian
  population in several South American States; and everywhere in Italy and the
  Spanish Peninsula one comes upon the houses of rich "Americanos"&mdash;from
  the Argentine and Brazil, and so forth. And it is quite easy to believe the
  rumours that the conversations in Rome went beyond the Mediterranean and
  considered the possibility of still greater alliances and understandings in
  support of the Latin idea, from which France, which is neither northern with
  the British and Germans nor Latin with the Italians, but half and half
  between them, and incurably and self-centredly France, may be excluded.</p>

  <p>I will not write here now of how an understanding of that sort might
  affect the relationship of its participants to the League of Nations, nor
  will I speculate how the United States and the Monroe doctrine would be
  touched by such a coalescence of old and new world Latinism. The first, most
  obvious reaction of this new move towards a higher unity is upon France. I do
  not know how far the newspaper consortium in France will allow the news of
  what has happened to reach the white population of France. For long the
  European French have been kept in profound ignorance of the gathering British
  distrust of their foreign policy, and in still pro-founder ignorance of the
  reasons for that distrust. I believe attempts are now being made in France to
  represent this coming together of Spain and Italy as an alliance to keep
  Britain out of the Mediterranean. It is nothing of the sort. It is an
  alliance to restrain French Africa. But there have been signs since King
  Alfonso's visit to Rome of a dim realisation even on the part of M. Poincaré
  of the circle of dismay and disapproval that is closing in slowly and
  steadily upon France.</p>

  <p>I wish Frenchmen travelled more. I wish they were more receptive of
  unflattering news. I wish they could realise the enormous distress with which
  civilised men everywhere, in New York and London as in Rome and Madrid, watch
  their fantastic dance over the broken body of Germany to absolute isolation
  in the world's affairs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="art15"
     name="art15">LATIN AMERICA AND THE LEAGUE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">22.12.1923</p>

  <p class="first">In my previous article I discussed the visit of King Alfonso
  to Rome, and the profound significance to France and the world in general of
  the conversations that must have taken place there between the Spanish and
  Italian dictators. Among other issues was the possibility of a Latin League,
  comprehending the two European peninsulas and Latin America. I return to this
  idea.</p>

  <p>At the least it is an imaginative gesture on the parts of General de
  Rivera and Signor Mussolini on a higher creative level than anything we have
  had from European statecraft for some time. At the best it may be an opening
  of a way towards a real league of peoples for the preservation of the world's
  peace.</p>

  <p>It is suggested that all these Latin peoples, who have so much in common,
  who are so admirably equipped for a common understanding and the achievement
  of a common destiny, should withdraw from that lamentable cul-de-sac of good
  intentions, the existing League of Nations, in order to group themselves
  together for collective action in the world's affairs. Now that is a very
  hopeful idea. Let us see just how it might be extended. Suppose the British
  Empire also presently came out of the League in order to be free for a
  parallel and still more potent grouping with the United States of the
  English-speaking communities. It seems to me that in these rearrangements we
  should have two great steps made towards a real conference of the peoples of
  the earth.</p>

  <p>The next step would be the entry of France into an association with these
  two groups. France, half northern and half Latin, would be free to relieve
  the world of its nightmare dream of La France Nègre, because it could find
  its security in a new Atlantic Association. It could deal with these two
  agglomerations as a necessary associate and link and intermediary; and Paris,
  so balanced, could remain a world centre instead of sinking to the level of a
  mere nationalist capital. That threefold grouping need have no fear of a
  Germany restored and a Russia reborn.</p>

  <p>It is of supreme importance, if we are to get on to any real and effective
  world confederation, that it should be a gathering of linguistic, racial, and
  cultural groups rather than of nationalist governments&mdash;trailing their
  infernal "foreign" policies into its deliberations. That is the most obvious
  defect of the Geneva situation; it is not a gathering of world
  representatives, but a bargain- and alliance-hunting place for diplomatists.
  One of the most obvious consequences of such larger aggregations of kindred
  peoples would be that in them the old nationalist and imperialist policies
  that still divide and afflict the world would be dissolved and lost. Spain
  and Italy linked up to Latin America would find little support for adventures
  in North Africa. Great Britain, tied a little closer to the United States,
  would be under a new restraint towards Mesopotamia or Asia Minor.</p>

  <p>This idea of a league of peoples into which the Powers of the world would
  come not as "national" sovereign States, but as great groups of States, each
  group with something like a common culture, is not a new one. It was
  suggested in the memorandum of 1918 upon which the British propaganda against
  Germany was based. But President Wilson and the British Foreign Office
  ignored that, and indeed most other documents and facts, when the existing
  League of Nations was brought into being&mdash;and so we have this
  preposterous body at Geneva, which is, and must be, I maintain, for any large
  and grave international occasions, a hopelessly useless body.</p>

  <p>I use the word "preposterous." That may seem a harsh, excessive epithet to
  many readers. They believe in this sham. They give it their love and
  enthusiasm. They burn indignantly at my criticisms and treat me as an enemy
  to Peace and mankind. But I would put before them, mainly in the words of Mr.
  H. Wilson Harris, a little story of what happened at Geneva this year, and I
  would ask them to remember that this is an assembly from which the sixty
  millions of Germany and the hundred odd millions of Russia are inexorably
  barred out&mdash;presumably as unfit for representation.</p>

  <p>Abyssinia is not barred out. Abyssinia is now taking its part with France,
  Sweden, Britain, and the other great nations of the world&mdash;in whatever
  the League of Nations is permitted to do. Here is the account of the coming
  of Abyssinia. It must surely fill the citizens of the United States with
  envious admiration. "The delegation consisted of two dark-skinned native
  representatives and a French adviser," Count Robert Linant de Bellefonds,
  bearing a letter of authorisation from "Her Majesty the Queen of the Kings of
  Ethiopia." A few minor questions had to be settled by telegram between the
  Queen's Court and Geneva. Ethiopia renounced the slave trade and one or two
  other little domestic oddities by cable, and on September 28,</p>

  <p>"amid resounding cheers, an impressive Ethiopian, clad in a black silk
  cape over a kind of surplice, and with white duck trousers gathered in at the
  ankles, slowly mounted the tribune, and, settling a pair of gold-rimmed
  glasses with much deliberation on his swarthy nose, proceeded to repeat an
  incomprehensible declaration in his native tongue"</p>

  <p>&mdash;of the best intentions in the world.</p>

  <p>The assembly presently proceeded to re-elect the non-permanent members of
  the Council. China was dropping out, and Poland, the closest ally of France
  in Europe, was put forward. Abyssinia, now a seasoned member of upward a
  week's standing, became a passionate supporter of Poland. Cablegrams suddenly
  appeared from the Queen of the Kings, "intimating that the Government of that
  distant and dusky realm was earnest in its support of Poland's candidature on
  account of the historic ties which bound the two countries to one
  another."</p>

  <p>I wish I could have heard Count Robert de Belle-fonds on these historic
  ties. I think that justifies my "preposterous" up to the hilt. I think, too,
  it justifies my reiterated assertion that the constitution of the League is
  so hopeless, so childish, so diplomatically conceived and useless, that
  nothing but reorganisation from the ground upward can give us a proper organ
  for the expression of the real need and desire for unity in the world.</p>

  <p>Of course, Count Robert Linant de Bellefonds has led this tame vote for
  France into the ring partly in emulation and partly in derision of the
  British troupe of young lions, and the absolutely domesticated Indian
  elephant. France scored a point against Britain. To this the League has come
  in four brief years. Anyone but a pedant could have foretold this sort of
  thing, as the necessary fruit of the principle of one sovereign State one
  vote.</p>

  <p>I hope the full significance of the Abyssinian turn has not been lost on
  the Latin American States. It may help them to realise why there should be
  this feeling in Spain and Italy against the League, and the excellent reasons
  there are for setting up some new association for the working out and
  expression of the will of the Latin civilisation as a whole in the world's
  affairs. It may help their decision towards a creative withdrawal. For the
  world is in urgent need of a real League of Nations and a real conference of
  peoples&mdash;this costume parade at Geneva is a mere mockery of its
  hopes.</p>

  <h2><a id="art16"
     name="art16">COSMOPOLITAN AND INTERNATIONAL</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">29.12.1923</p>

  <p class="first">Sometimes words for quite unaccountable reasons get down on
  their luck. They lose caste, they drop out of society, nobody will be seen
  about with them.</p>

  <p>A word for which I have the greatest sympathy is "Cosmopolitan." I want to
  see it restored to a respectable use. It is a fine word and it embodies a
  fine idea. But for more than half the English-speaking people who hear it, I
  suppose, it carries with it the quality of a shady, illicit individual with a
  bad complexion, a falsified passport and a police record. This creature to be
  typical should be mixed up with the drug traffic and a danger to the
  inexperienced and honest everywhere; Monte Carlo is the idea of heaven for
  such a Cosmopolitan, and Ellis Island the corresponding hell. I don't know
  how it has come about that this good word Cosmopolitan has got so firmly
  attached to the trunks of such gentry, for the proper term that should be
  there is surely "extreme individualist." Even "Internationalist" would be a
  better word for a man or woman who passes between country and country and
  belongs to none. But I do not see why we should punish a word because it has
  been stupidly misapplied.</p>

  <p>For what is Cosmopolis but the City of the World, and what can a
  Cosmopolitan be but a good citizen wherever he goes? That is what I want to
  be and not International&mdash;which seems to me an altogether homeless
  adjective. It means, I take it, "in between nations"&mdash;in between the
  substantial things of life. The only truly international thing is the ocean
  outside territorial waters. Trying to be International is like trying to walk
  about on the cracks between the boards, instead of walking on the floor; you
  could only do it if you had feet like skates, and I cannot understand why we
  tack this dismal adjective nowadays on to all our current attempts to get
  human brotherhood put upon a broader basis than parochial or national
  feeling. I am an Englishman and a Cosmopolitan, a good Englishman, and I hope
  a good Cosmopolitan; I do not see why I should repudiate my own original
  plank or any other planks because I want to go freely over all the floor.</p>

  <p>My emotional equipment as a faithful son of England I claim to be sound
  and complete. To the end of my days I shall think of England, the kindly
  England of the south-east, London and Essex, Kent and Sussex, as my own very
  particular region of the world. London is mine, as no other city can ever be;
  I have seen it grow and change and become ever more wonderful and beautiful
  and dear to me since first I came up to it, to the stupendous gloomy-vault of
  Cannon Street Station, half a century ago. But Paris also, open and elegant,
  with a delicate excitement in its air; New York, the towering and beautiful;
  many a prim South German town; Venice; Rome, as I remember it, before
  reviving prosperity and that vile monument to Victor Emmanuel vulgarised it
  so hopelessly; frosty and sullen Petersburg, have charmed me, and I want a
  share in their happiness and welfare, I want to possess them also and to care
  for them, and I am ready to barter the welcome of my London in exchange.
  Cosmopolis is all these cities and a thousand others, and I want to be free
  of them all.</p>

  <p>But the world is full of stupid people who will not let me be free of
  Cosmopolis. They make my England almost a gaol for me by inventing a thousand
  inconveniences if I want to go out of it. There are passport offices and
  tariff offices stuck across every path of travel and desire; there are
  differences in coinage and a multitude of petty restrictions to exasperate
  every attempt I make at holiday in my Europe, The streets of Cosmopolis are
  up and barricaded; I want to break down these barricades.</p>

  <p>There is not a reasonable and honest man in the world who does not want a
  uniform coinage about the earth. Only the greedy, cunning exchange
  speculator&mdash;and idiot collectors&mdash;want either varied coinages or a
  variety of stamps in this world. If the League of Nations at Geneva wasn't
  the dismal-lest sham on the earth, it would insist upon running the posts of
  Europe and having a mint of its own. Wherever one goes in Europe one finds
  oneself loaded up with foreign money that ceases to be current after a day's
  journey, and with useless postage stamps. And every silly little scrap of
  Europe is pretending to be a separate economic system&mdash;in mysterious
  conflict with other economic systems. Every hundred miles or so in Europe
  there is a fresh tariff barrier.</p>

  <p>Everybody, except for a few monopolists and officials, loses by tariffs.
  They are devices for gaining a little for some particular section of mankind
  at the cost of an infinitely greater loss to Cosmopolis. Mean and narrow in
  conception, they are abominable in action. It is an intolerable nuisance to
  be searched for tobacco and matches by some sedulous eater of garlic before
  one may enter France from England&mdash;they even turn out your pockets
  now&mdash;and to have one's portmanteau locks broken and one or two minor
  possessions stolen whenever one goes into Italy. At Dover they read the books
  you have with you to see if they are improper. The quays of New York again,
  after the arrival of a liner, are a grossly indecent spectacle. They go
  half-way back from civilisation to the barbecue of a foreign sailor by
  cannibal wreckers. Much as I like New York, I never miss a thrill of intense
  anger when the large hand of the Customs officer routs among my
  under-clothes.</p>

  <p>And these are only the minor inconveniences of not living in Cosmopolis;
  they are just the superficial indications that the world one moves about in
  is a thin crust hanging insecurely above the abyss of war. I do not believe
  that any mere Internationalism and League of Nations that leaves the coinages
  separate, and the Customs Houses on the frontiers, and the passport officials
  busy at their little wickets with their nasty rubber stamps, which leaves the
  mean profits of tariff manipulation possible for influential people, which
  denies by all these things our common ownership and common responsibility for
  all the world, can ever open the way to world peace.</p>

  <p>I am for world-control of production and of trade and transport, for a
  world coinage, and the confederation of mankind. I am for the super-State,
  and not for any League. Cosmopolis is my city, and I shall die cut off from
  it. When I die I shall have lived only a part of my possible life, a sort of
  life in a corner. And this is true of nearly all the rest of mankind alive at
  the present time. The world is a patchwork of various sized internment camps
  called Independent Sovereign States, and we are each caught in our bit of the
  patchwork and cannot find a way of escape. Because most of us have still to
  realise, as I do, a passionate desire to escape. But a day will come when
  Custom House officers will be as rare as highwaymen in Sussex, and when the
  only passports in the world will be found alongside of Aztec idols and
  instruments of torture and such-like relics of superstition in our historical
  museums.</p>

  <h2><a id="art17"
     name="art17">THE PARLIAMENTARY TRIANGLE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">5.1.1924</p>

  <p class="first">That profoundly absurd body the British Parliament will meet
  on January 8, and the recondite and fascinating game of party politics will
  be resumed under novel conditions with three parties, none of which have a
  majority, and with a Labour Party in sight, not of power, but of office.</p>

  <p>I call the British Parliament an absurd body with set and measured
  intention. It is twice as big as it ought to be for efficient government; it
  carries a load, a fatty encumbrance, of more than three hundred
  undistinguished and useless members; much of its procedure, its method of
  taking divisions for example, is idiotically wasteful of the nation's time;
  and it is elected by methods so childishly crude that it represents neither
  the will nor the energy nor the intelligence of the country. It dissipates
  and caricatures the national consciousness. Assembled, it will have nothing
  definite to say to France, Germany, Russia, America, or to the festering mass
  of British unemployed. From the Parliamentary point of view that sort of
  thing is subsidiary. Its party leaders will engage at once in the primary
  business of party leaders, which is, of course, to secure the sweets of
  office as speedily and securely as possible.</p>

  <p>The broad lines of the game to be played this year are now fairly evident.
  They raise a number of profoundly interesting questions. The Conservative
  Party is the strongest of the three, but the Government it supports can be
  and will be turned out of office by a vote of "no confidence," in which the
  Liberals, the smallest party of all, will support the Labour motion. The King
  will then send for Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, the leader of the Opposition, and
  ask him to form a Government. This Mr. MacDonald says he intends to do. He
  will have the qualified support of the Liberal Party. Almost immediately the
  Labour Party will have to produce its Budget.</p>

  <p>The prophets foretell two alternatives. The Labour Government will produce
  a weak, individualistic Budget, an apologetic, compromising, imitative
  affair; it will drop or reserve almost all its Socialistic ideas, and it will
  be permitted to continue in office under the distinguished
  patronage&mdash;gracefully and frequently reiterated&mdash;of Mr. Asquith, so
  long as its good behaviour continues. Everyone will praise Mr. Ramsay
  MacDonald's statesmanlike moderation, and when at last the Party has to face
  the constituencies. But it will have no face left for the constituencies. A
  mass of votes will drift back to Liberalism, which by that time will be seen
  to be just as good as Labour or better, and the crowd of unemployed, the
  poor, the disinherited, and all who are really weary and angry with the
  exploits and adventures of the untrammelled rich, will turn their faces away
  from the Labour Party and Parliamentary methods towards revolution. But the
  Liberal politicians will take little heed of the latter drift because it is
  outside the scope of Parliamentary procedure.</p>

  <p>Or secondly, the prophets think that Labour may produce very bold and far-
  reaching Socialist proposals. They may stick to the Capital Levy, and so
  forth. They may put up their entire election programme. Then the Liberal
  Party will withdraw its support. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald will be obliged to
  resign, and the clever little, brave little Liberal group will form a
  Government, and with the assistance of a large part of the Conservatives
  carry on and&mdash;with large benevolent gestures&mdash;"save the country" by
  doing nothing. So that on the second alternative also the Liberal Party
  stands to win.</p>

  <p>But then Mr. Ramsay MacDonald may advise the King to dissolve Parliament;
  he may ask the country to decide upon his Budget and legislative programme.
  And here comes the most delicate issue of all. The Liberal prophets tell us
  the King will refuse a dissolution. Will he in fact refuse to follow the
  advice of his Ministers, and become active instead of passive in party
  affairs? When Mr. Baldwin asked for a dissolution the King protested and
  granted it. Will he behave differently towards Mr. MacDonald? The Liberal
  prophets have most attractive arguments to show that such a course is
  constitutional. No doubt it is. Mr. Baldwin had a majority; Mr. MacDonald has
  not. Nevertheless, would such a refusal, from the point of view of the Court,
  be a wise thing? The common man in the country is not going to see the thing
  from the lawyer's standpoint. He is going to conclude that the King favours
  the Conservatives and Liberals against Labour. From the point of view of the
  monarchy that is a very undesirable conclusion, even if it is an unjust
  conclusion, to spread about the country in a period of unemployment and
  social stress.</p>

  <p>It is a polite convention in Great Britain that there is no Republican
  feeling in the land. That convention is not in accordance with the facts.
  There is much dormant Republicanism, but so long as the monarchy remains "the
  golden link of empire," so long as the conditions of a "crowned republic" are
  observed, Republicanism sleeps. But it sleeps much more lightly than many
  people suppose, and the crown cannot afford to make mistakes.</p>

  <p>When the other day the Duke of York allowed himself to be associated with
  what appears to be a British imitation of the Ku Klux Klan, the sleeping
  spirit stirred. It raised an eyebrow, even if it did not open an eye. It may
  prove a great misfortune for the British crown if presently it is led by the
  assurances of eager Liberals into even the appearance of hostility to the
  party of the workers. The now latent Republicanism of the British people,
  once roused to activity, may be very difficult to lull again. The Labour
  Party may become a Republican party. And since the British crown is
  manifestly wary and discreet, I am not so certain as the Liberal lawyers that
  that dissolution will be refused. I may be wrong, and so among other
  possibilities we may see a "safety" Liberal Government sitting on the
  safety-valve in Britain for some years.</p>

  <p>But do these alternatives exhaust the possibilities of the case? Suppose
  the coming Labour Government neither abandons nor carries out its Capital
  Levy, but refers it to a delaying committee of inquiry, and suppose it goes
  on in grim earnest to realise all of the fine promises of the Liberal
  programme. Where will the Liberals be then? Suppose, pending the decision of
  the committee upon the Capital Levy, it piles up the super-tax on large
  incomes, puts an almost confiscatory tax upon underdeveloped land and mineral
  resources, abolishes the game laws and rids England of the fox, cuts
  expenditure upon armaments and military and naval display
  ruthlessly&mdash;puts, for example, the Guards into reasonable and
  comfortable inexpensive uniforms&mdash;replaces doles by public employment,
  organises agricultural marketing, produces a comprehensive housing scheme,
  and quadruples the estimate for education and scientific research; what are
  the Liberals going to say to it?</p>

  <p>I know what the dinner parties will say about it, but the Liberal Party,
  if it is to go on existing, must save its face with the country. Perhaps a
  third of the Liberal Party might be genuinely disposed to back such a Labour
  programme; another third might feel constrained to do so. Mr. Lloyd George
  would move leftward, quite helpfully. And the Labour Government might
  struggle along insecurely and valiantly for much longer than most of the
  prophets suppose.</p>

  <p>And the party managers, of all three parties, will be scheming some new
  electoral law before the next election. None of them will hear of honest
  proportional representation with large constituencies and a smaller, more
  efficient House of Commons; but they will all be planning something that will
  look fair and honest, leave the party system intact, and advantage the
  Parliamentary party to which each belongs. In this matter the Labour Party is
  no more honest than any other. Its party organs discuss the question entirely
  from the party point of view, and are quite disposed to consider "the
  alternative vote" or any other shabby evasion of proper electoral methods. So
  that at the end of our vista we must reckon with an election faked perhaps in
  some novel way but just as absurd as the last one.</p>

  <p>And so Great Britain muddles through the years of destiny.</p>

  <h2><a id="art18"
     name="art18">MODERN GOVERNMENT: PARLIAMENT AND REAL ELECTORAL
     REFORM</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">22.1.1924</p>

  <p class="first">We are assured that a reform of the electoral system is now
  imminent in Great Britain. The oldest and most respectable of the world's
  democratic governments is declared to be in need of repair and
  reconstruction. It has produced three parties without a majority, and it
  threatens to jam. Immediate legislation is promised. This must needs be a
  matter of lively interest to every intelligent person from China to Peru.</p>

  <p>For the British Parliament is the Mother of Parliaments. This is the proud
  boast of the conventional teacher of British history (as distinguished from
  history), and&mdash;subject to a footnote by Mr. Belloc&mdash;it is
  reasonably true. The prevalent type of governing body in the world has been
  constructed more or less in imitation or as a variation of the respected
  British pattern; there is an Upper House whose members are supposed to be
  more select and genteel and important, and a Lower House which, generally
  speaking, wrangles more, is more representative of and more in the spirit of
  the common people, has taxing power, and is more conspicuously and fussily
  elected by the general population. The reasons commonly alleged for this
  double chamber system are pedantic and ridiculous, but the States that have
  been organised or modernised in the past three centuries have followed one
  another in the matter with all that unquestioning readiness which
  distinguishes man and the sheep and the processional caterpillar from most
  other of God's animated creatures.</p>

  <p>The members of one or both of these chambers or houses are elected, and
  the system of election remains so primitive and stupid as to leave a large
  minority, or even a majority, of the electors not even represented in the
  House. The procedure is infantile&mdash;in the British Parliament the members
  vote by sprinting past a teller and through a lobby and along passages and so
  forth back to their seats&mdash;and generally these Parliaments, Congresses,
  and Legislative Chambers are about as well fitted to serve the needs of our
  complicated modern communities as a battleship of Queen Elizabeth's navy is
  fitted to encounter modern artillery.</p>

  <p>But they are difficult to scrap and reconstruct because the only people
  legally capable of scrapping and reconstructing them are the politicians they
  have created, and who are completely adapted to their necessities. You cannot
  expect "Old Parliamentary Hands" and such-like gentry to modify or even to
  realise the disastrous inefficiency of the political devices by which they
  live and move and have their being. Most of the Latin communities, which are
  logical to the pitch of violence, have solved the problem of Parliamentary
  incompetence in their hasty way by accepting dictators who treat all elected
  representatives with a scarcely veiled contempt; and even the English, in the
  face of a supreme national crisis, acquiesced in Cromwell.... Of course,
  after I have written that last sentence nothing will prevent the world-wide
  society of the muddle-headed from running away with the idea that I advocate
  dictatorships, just as it was impossible to prevent them from declaring that
  I had "embraced Protection" after I had pointed out that tariffs, like war,
  follow naturally upon nationalism, and just as they would certainly have it
  that I want to promote typhoid fever if I were to write about the necessary
  consequences of insanitary conditions. But that is a digression.
  Dictatorships are evil consequences of democratic break-downs. They are the
  rough remedy for intolerable democracy. And except in the United States
  democracies are becoming very generally intolerable. The people of the United
  States, for the time the spoilt children of the human race, are so fortunate
  in their isolation and their vast unity that the efficiency of their
  Government is a matter of no immediate concern to them. They will perhaps get
  along with their unwieldy Congress and their dear two historical parties for
  a long time yet. The British behind their silver streak had something of the
  same immunity before the war. They were still in a phase of financial and
  economic good luck. It is over for them now. In Britain politics have become
  serious and vital, and under existing conditions the overstrained and
  impoverished community can no longer suffer the elaborate fooleries of party
  government.</p>

  <p>Great Britain is in urgent need of competent representative government,
  and the extent to which the Mother of Parliaments proves herself to be a
  recuperative phoenix or an incurable old goose in this affair is a matter of
  vital importance not only to the British Empire, but to the whole world.</p>

  <p>Nowadays we have fairly clear ideas of the nature of the supreme governing
  body that is needed for a great and various modern State. A single body seems
  to be all that is required; that a nation should squint at its problems with
  two divergent bodies does not seem id be imperative at all&mdash;though
  possibly a secondary body representing function, and not locality, may be a
  desirable auxiliary to the supreme assembly. About that supreme assembly we
  are now able to stipulate certain necessary conditions. It must not be too
  large a body, because that means an excess of inert and undistinguished
  members too numerous and obscure to be properly watched, such as we find
  encumbering affairs at Washington and Westminster, and at the same time it
  must be large enough to staff all its necessary committees, and to represent
  the chief varieties of opinion in the country. Something between two hundred
  and three hundred members seems to be the proper assembly; less may be
  unrepresentative, and more will develop crowd mentality. And the members must
  be elected by the method of proportional representation, and be sent up from
  twenty or thirty large constituencies&mdash;largely to eliminate mere local
  leaders&mdash;each constituency returning a dozen members or more. Only by
  this method of election can we kill that gag upon honest democracy, the party
  system, and replace the professional politician by a various gathering of
  typical and well-known men and women. Such a body would change only slowly in
  its character from election to election, and it would sustain a Government
  more real, steadfast, representative, assured and consistent than any the
  world has ever seen before.</p>

  <p>Throughout the world a great and gathering body of opinion is moving
  steadily towards such a conception of a modern Government. And because of its
  present needs it is Great Britain which is likely to be for a time the
  battleground between modern and eighteenth-century conceptions of a
  legislative assembly.</p>

  <p>It will be particularly interesting to watch the ingenuities of the
  politicians in the new Parliament in producing schemes that will look like
  electoral reform and yet leave the profession still active for mischief. They
  will fight desperately against large constituencies with numerous members.
  The one-member or two-member constituency is absolutely necessary to their
  party system. In such constituencies even proportional representation can be
  reduced to a farce. And also they will offer cheap but attractive substitutes
  like the second ballot and the alternative vote. And they will fake
  extraordinary arrangements by which the voter will vote not for an individual
  but for a ticket or bunch, and they will call these fakes this or that
  improved variety of "proportional representation." All the political parties
  in Britain are at present trying to work out the probable effects of this or
  that fake or cheap substitute for electoral honesty, upon the party
  prospects. In this matter the Labour Party is as bad as any other
  party&mdash;or worse. The discussion of electoral legislation in the Imperial
  Parliament throughout the next session, though it may make the angels weep,
  is certain to afford much entertainment to every mundane observer of human
  disingenuousness.</p>

  <h2><a id="art19"
     name="art19">SCRAPPING THE GOLD STANDARD</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">19.1.1924</p>

  <p class="first">Among recent events of conspicuous importance is the
  publication of a new book by Mr. J. M. Keynes, A Tract on Monetary Reform.
  Among the large trivial happenings of the time, revolutions, movements of
  crowned heads in and out of exile, new French alliances, and the antics of
  eminent politicians, it is refreshing to have something of real significance
  on which to make one's weekly comments, ii</p>

  <p>I incurred great odium a little while ago by saying that Mr. J. M. Keynes
  could claim to have achieved success while at the same time I excluded those
  popular heroes. Napoleon I and Mr. Lloyd George, from the list of true
  successes. But here is a fresh book from Mr. Keynes, simple, outspoken, well
  written, and making a definite step forward in our understanding of the
  world's problems. You might read all the speeches and orations of Napoleon or
  Mr. Lloyd George through and you will know no more about men and things than
  when you began; Mr. Keynes will leave you different&mdash;enlightened. Mr.
  Keynes thinks with scientific lucidity and says what he thinks exactly and
  skilfully. What he says stands and will necessarily affect the history of
  money in a real and permanent way. Did Napoleon ever say anything or has Mr.
  Lloyd George ever said anything except what seemed likely to impress or
  humbug people in general?</p>

  <p>It is a peculiarity of the mind of Mr. Keynes that it is at once
  penetrating and limited. He seems to think that the British Empire is a
  permanent instead of a manifestly transitory arrangement and that the United
  States of America and the Empire and the various States of the European
  patchwork are always going to retain their sovereign independence in
  financial and economic affairs. He assumes this much, and never questions it.
  But within the limits of this assumption, he writes with a lucidity and a
  frankness that are a liberal education for the reader.</p>

  <p>To write of currency is generally recognised as an objectionable, and
  indeed almost as an indecent, practice. Editors will implore a writer almost
  tearfully not to write about money. This is not because it is an
  uninteresting subject, but because it is, and always has been, a profoundly
  disturbing subject. The whole modern world has been brought up on cash and on
  credit reckoned in terms of money. Four or five generations of us have lived
  by the faith that a dollar was a dollar and a pound a pound, and that if you
  left them about they grew at so much per cent, per annum, and also increased
  in value. Most things became cheaper and cheaper throughout our young lives.
  That cheapening seemed in the nature of things. We worked for money; we saved
  the stuff, we looked forward to a comfortable old age. Now we live in a phase
  of fluctuating and on the whole mounting prices. Whosoever saveth his money
  shall lose it. Even the dollar buys two things where ten years ago it bought
  three. The pound sterling is in a worse case, and many of the other
  currencies have sunken to levels beyond the wildest fantasies of 1913.</p>

  <p>Now this, as Mr. Keynes points out, is a breach of the understanding
  between society and the common individual. In this system in which we and our
  predecessors have lived for a century and more, the system which Socialists
  will call the "Capitalist" system but which Mr. Keynes much more properly
  calls the "Private Capitalist" system, there has always been an implicit
  guarantee that the money we worked for and saved up and lent and invested in
  various ways was good. It was good for our needs whenever we chose to spend
  it again. This was the incentive to work; this was the driving force of the
  whole hundred years of industrial production from Waterloo to the Marne. And
  to a large extent the incentive has gone. Money is no longer good; it has
  become treacherous. Unless it can be restored this system of ours must break
  down and lead either to social chaos and human decadence or to a new and
  different system.</p>

  <p>Now Mr. Keynes is not a Socialist. He believes that the existing system of
  individual competition is "in accordance with human nature and has great
  advantages." But it cannot go on unless money is made trustworthy again. And
  his proposals to restore our confidence in money are very bold and remarkable
  indeed.</p>

  <p>The vice, the almost incurable vice, of cash and credit systems, since
  first the methods of money became dominant in the Roman Republic, has been
  its tendency to expand debt to impossible dimensions. Every country at the
  end of the war found itself owing preposterous sums to the creditor class or
  to foreign countries, and forced in various measure to tax the productive
  classes, to tax its creditor class either directly by income-tax and capital
  levy, or indirectly by currency inflation, and to bilk its foreign creditors.
  Every sovereign State in Europe had its own policy and set about the business
  on its own lines, with the result that to-day Europe is a museum of methods
  of economic collapse, from Britain, crushed by taxation and unemployment in
  an attempt to deflate back to the gold standard, to Germany, smashed into
  complete economic paralysis by extreme currency inflation. No country remains
  now with its currency based on a gold standard, not even the United States of
  America. True, you can exchange dollar bills for gold at Washington, but then
  you lose by the transaction. The United States has over-bought gold and is
  still accumulating and hoarding gold&mdash;at a loss. If all America's
  hoarded gold were minted and circulated, the value of the dollar would fall.
  The American dollar is the extreme case of deflation, as the exploded German
  mark was the extreme case of inflation.</p>

  <p>Now what Mr. Keynes wants the world to do is to scrap gold altogether as a
  monetary standard and to substitute a "managed" currency. For the present he
  would have two independent units in the world, the dollar and the pound,
  because he is sceptical of the Americans and British ever working together
  without friction&mdash;even in so vitally important a matter. In both the
  United States and Britain he would have the banks and Treasury co-operating
  to keep in circulation such an amount of currency as would maintain internal
  prices at a steady level. They would decrease currency if prices fell, and
  increase it if they rose. He would take the price of a "standard, composite
  commodity"&mdash;so much steel, so much wheat, so much rice, so much rubber,
  and so on&mdash;and he would make that the new standard of value. He believes
  that the other currencies in the world would finally steady down into fairly
  stable relations with the "managed" dollar and the "managed" pound. And then
  we would go on again with our "Private Capitalism," buying, selling, saving,
  investing, competing, as we did in the happy days before the war.</p>

  <p>But there are certain curious implications in this. Mr. Keynes seems to
  recognise them and yet not give them their full value. The underlying
  assumption of Private Capitalism is that human beings will work better for
  gain, will show more enterprise and industry for profit, than for any other
  motive. But here, at the heart of the system, Mr. Keynes proposes to
  establish a disinterested group of managers, bankers, and officials who are
  not to accumulate private fortunes, though they could do so very easily by
  playing with the fluctuations of prices, but with a single-hearted devotion
  are just to maintain them for the public good. He seems to realise the
  difficulty here. He insists at several points that a system of Private
  Capitalism cannot survive without moderation; that if private enterprise will
  insist upon gambling upon the exchanges and working for profits regardless of
  any other consideration, the whole system must collapse. But if we are to
  rely upon the spirit of service and not upon the incentive of gain in our
  banks and Treasury officials, why should we not rely upon it generally? If
  currency can be "managed" in the public interest by men working, not for
  profit, but for service, why not also the production of staples and land and
  sea transport? But a system of economics run on the motive of service is not
  individualism at all; it is Socialism.</p>

  <p>I think that in the long run Mr. Keynes will be forced to realise this. A
  "managed" currency is a long step towards a deliberately organised world. The
  gold standard was the standard of individual enterprise and go-as-you-please.
  The gold standard has failed and passes. Unless human society is to fail
  also, the age of scientific management is close at hand.</p>

  <h2><a id="art20"
     name="art20">THE HUB OF EUROPE:<br>
  CZECHO-SLOVAKIA AND FRANCE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">26.1.1924</p>

  <p class="first">Bohemia within its mountains is like a square citadel in the
  very centre of Europe. Czechoslovakia, the old Bohemian kingdom revived and
  extended, is the most orderly and successful of all the States created by the
  Treaty of Versailles. The republic understands the modern need of
  advertisement; the wandering writer finds a flattering welcome there, and
  what is done in Prague is heard of in the world.</p>

  <p>The new treaty with France brings Czecho-Slovakia still more prominently
  forward. Poor exhausted bankrupt Poland, that sucked orange, is thrust aside,
  and Czecho-Slovakia becomes the keystone of France's restless incessant
  rearrangement of alliances. But Czecho-Slovakia is a very different country
  from Poland; it is sturdier and less romantically inclined, its President and
  chief Minister are among the most level-headed and far-seeing of European
  statesmen; and it is likely to prove a sobering and restraining influence
  upon French activities. Bohemia is the projecting westward angle of the Slav
  world; its language is closely akin to Russian, Serbian, Polish and
  Bulgarian; within its boundaries there are more than three million Germans,
  and three-quarters of a million of Magyars, and its natural destiny seems to
  be that it should act as a region of exchange and interpretation between the
  Slavic world, Hungary and Turkey, and the world of Central and Western
  Europe. German speech encloses it upon three sides. In itself, with its
  thirteen million odd of heterogeneous population, largely engaged in
  agriculture, it cannot be a country of any great importance; its importance
  now, as in the past, lies in its position and its possible inter-racial
  functions.</p>

  <p>To these the President and his chief Minister and pupil, Mr. Benes, are
  acutely alive. They see in their country a meeting-place and reconciler of
  European interests. They are ambitious to make it a centre of trade, of
  intellectual interchange, and political unification. For this end they have
  worked steadfastly since their country emerged into renewed political
  existence in 1918. Theirs is a splendid and civilised dream.</p>

  <p>It has been stated in many quarters that this new alliance has been made
  hastily, and at the initiative of France, as a stepping-stone to an
  understanding with Russia. The possibility of a Labour Government in Great
  Britain, and of a complete British recognition of Russia, is supposed to have
  driven France into a hasty search for an intermediary who would help her to
  end her long feud with the Bolsheviks. But in reality the recent visit of
  President Masaryk to Paris and London was already arranged last summer. He
  was already discussing the problems of this understanding then. It is
  probably a Czech rather than a French initiative that has brought it
  about.</p>

  <p>There is something very attractive in these steadfast schemes to make
  Bohemia the centre of a Europe renewed. I think everyone who hopes to see a
  more noble and spacious civilisation emerging from the distresses of the
  present time must feel warmly sympathetic with these great ambitions. But it
  is impossible to ignore the enormous disadvantages against which the
  imaginations of President Masaryk and Mr. Benes and their colleagues are
  pitted. They make their creative effort in a tangle of long-accumulated
  difficulties and with some extraordinarily intractable material.</p>

  <p>One first difficulty lies in the fact that the European railway system was
  developed while Prague was merely a provincial capital. The railways of
  Central Europe radiate from Vienna and Berlin. The centres of banking and
  commercial exchange were in these cities. And the efforts of Prague to
  deflect the currents of trade and finance to herself have hitherto fallen far
  short of the political ambitions of her leaders. I remember my astonishment
  on my first journey from Eger to Prague in 1920 to discover that I was
  travelling to the capital on a single line of railway.</p>

  <p>In Prague at that time the great Sokol festival was going on, the festival
  of the patriotic societies, and there was little thought of Europe apparent
  and much of the three united peoples of Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia.
  National costumes made the streets gay; national music filled the air. But
  there was a great welcome at that time for the foreign visitor, and the
  bunting of all the Allies interwove with the national flag. French
  horizon-blue and the Stars and Stripes came into the picture with the chain
  and robes of the Lord Mayor of London, who was there in full regalia. And
  when one was in the presence of President Masaryk, with his sweeping views
  and his amazing knowledge of the contemporary intellectual activities of the
  English and French and German and Russian speaking worlds, the nationalist
  enthusiasm of Prague seemed no more than a picturesque and necessary
  background clamour.</p>

  <p>But I was there again this last summer, and the foreign flags and visitors
  had gone, and I realised more fully the sturdy and obstinate patriotism of
  the Bohemian people. I saw Prague not on show for the foreigner, but in its
  everyday clothes. And the effect was extremely provincial. My impression was
  that the friction between the German Bohemians&mdash;an absolutely necessary
  element&mdash;and the Czechs had increased. That may be the fault of the
  recalcitrant Germans; I will not venture to adjudicate on the rights and
  wrongs of that issue. The point is that that bad feeling has not been
  allayed. There was a more pronounced objection to the German language.
  Hitherto the Czechs have been a bilingual people, and it was in the double
  possession of a Teutonic and Slav language and culture that one of our chief
  hopes for their future lay. But they seem to be dropping German and learning
  no other language in its place. They are sinking back into a churlish
  monolingualism. The public notices of the town of Prague are in Czech, and in
  Czech only. For the westerner Czech is as difficult as Russian. Indeed, so
  far as he is concerned, they might as well be in Chinese. This is patriotic
  barbarism. How can Prague expect either pleasure visitors or business men to
  come to her if she will not speak to them in any intelligible tongue? How can
  she become a mart or meeting-place of the nations if she insists that no
  other speech than her own shall be used in her streets? In a little while all
  the currents of Central European life will be flowing back again to their
  former centres in polyglot Vienna and Berlin.</p>

  <p>Now these excesses of Czech patriotism make President Masaryk, to my mind,
  a very tragic figure. For this amazing man, this learned professor who was a
  village blacksmith's son, did more than anyone to revive the self-respect and
  national feeling of the Czechs. He restored the Czech nation. He believed,
  and still believes, that he restored a necessary and decisive councillor to
  the European board. It may be that he has done no more than produce a tough,
  rustic dwarf. The fine patriotism he evoked has been vulgarised and
  cheapened, and about him and behind him and Mr. Benes presses a loud and
  irreconcilable body of ultra-patriots. His Germans have been foolish and
  tiresome; egged on by the Austrian landowners, who are furious because of the
  Capital Levy and a liberal land policy, they will do nothing but rehearse
  grievances. In such German places as Marienbad you see them retaliating the
  insults of Prague by boycotting Czech. Yet a generous understanding between
  Czech and German is essential to any future beyond obscurity for Bohemia. A
  Czecho-Slovakia, pure Czech, with perhaps for political purposes a smattering
  of French, will be following in the way of Poland towards a vexed and
  vexatious insignificance in European affairs.</p>

  <h2><a id="art21"
     name="art21">THE MANDARINS AT THE GATE:<br>
  THE REVIVAL OF THE OLD LEARNING</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">2.2.1924</p>

  <p class="first">It would be near the truth of things to say that the only
  events of permanent importance in human affairs are educational events.
  Except in so far as they demonstrate and teach or interrupt teaching, wars
  and treaties, kings and laws, and all the standard material of history are
  but the by-products of the educator's work. Some day, when we have escaped
  from the trumpery dignity of classical history, a new Gibbon will trace for
  us the failure in understanding and co-operation that made the Roman Empire
  no more than a staggering pretension and left Europe and Western Asia a
  festering cluster of nationalisms to this day. No conqueror can make the
  multitude different from what it is, no statesman can carry the world's
  affairs beyond the ideas and capacity of the generation of adults with which
  he deals, but the teachers&mdash;I use the word in the widest sense&mdash;can
  do more than either conqueror or statesman; they can create a new vision and
  liberate latent powers in our kind. Or, if the perversity of their
  possibilities hold them, they can continue to put out the eyes of the
  children of men and let the world go on still under blind leaders of the
  blind.</p>

  <p>At no time in the world's experience has the need for a creative education
  been so manifest as it is to-day. This social and political system in which
  we live is ailing and divided against itself, failing to reconstitute even as
  much economic universalism as prevailed before the great war, involving
  itself in a hopeless muddle of debts. It is a system plainly doomed to a
  further series of wider and profounder disasters, unless amidst its
  distresses it can evolve a clearer realisation, not only in its ruling
  classes but generally, of the origins of our race and our civilisation, of
  the conditions under which our communities have grown, of the vital
  inter-relationships of our social order, and of the tremendous perils and the
  immense possibilities before mankind. A population with such a breadth of
  outlook, a population disciplined to creative constructive work, is not
  simply desirable to-day; it is imperatively demanded if civilisation is to
  avert a decay and a collapse as much greater than the Decline and Fall of the
  Roman Empire as a modern liner is greater than an Alexandrian galley.</p>

  <p>It is because of his realisation of the paramount need of a great
  educational effort as the first and supreme thing in human affairs to-day
  that every intelligent man must needs note with something between dismay and
  bitter derision the recent signs of a revival of "classical" teaching in the
  schools and colleges of the Atlantic peoples. The French, who so love the
  eighteenth century that in foreign and domestic policy they are always trying
  to get back to it, have led the way. Disturbing modern subjects which tend to
  betray the facts that the Mediterranean Sea is not the whole world, and that
  most great events of present importance to mankind occurred before or outside
  of or in revolt against the Latin civilisation, are to be kept out of the
  purview of French adolescence. More Greek will be taught, but not enough of
  it and not well enough for the young Frenchman to realise how feeble was the
  political, social, and economic reaction of Greece upon Rome. He will be
  trained to think that there was some sort of magnificent succession between
  the two, whereas Rome got little from Greece except slave pedagogues and
  pedants, misleading literary models which crippled her own sturdier
  initiative, articles de luxe, living and dead, architects, sculptors and
  painters, and cared so little for the clarifying Aristotle that she left his
  books about and lost them.</p>

  <p>The French, so largely German in race and mental quality, must however
  cherish their own Latin illusion in their own fashion; it comes nearer home
  to an English writer when he finds President Coolidge blessing the classical
  side. And still more dismaying is the truculent behaviour of the British
  Classical Association which has recently been meeting in the congenial
  atmosphere of Westminster School. Mr. Costley-White, the Headmaster, boasted
  of the increasing number of unfortunates in his school who were taking up the
  classical course, and made it clear that even those who were supposed to have
  a modern course in his school were really not given an honest modern course
  at all, but wasted their time with elementary classics before they were
  contemptuously "specialised" in science, modern history, mathematics, or
  modern languages. (What a classification!) And Mr. Herbert Fisher told coyly
  how even in a Coalition Government fragments of the Greek Anthology were not
  unfrequently translated into English verse during the duller Cabinet
  discussions&mdash;on contemporary education, one presumes. He further pointed
  out the power every headmaster had to direct the studies in his school, and
  in plain words to steal people's sons for the classics. It is clear that the
  classical headmasters of Great Britain, in a mood of self-complacent
  obstinacy, will spare no efforts to pith as many young intelligences as
  possible with their antiquated, deadening and antisocial disciplines. The
  classical tradition is still strongly entrenched in the educational world of
  the English-speaking peoples, and both in America and in the British Empire
  it will be over its dead body only that a modern education will be able to
  reach the finer minds of the new generation.</p>

  <p>Now it is a useless and dangerous civility to write flattering things
  about the classical education that still cripples the selected best of our
  youth. It robs us of a directive class of lively intelligences; it is the
  root cause of the pretentious sterility of contemporary statescraft. The
  uncritical cant it sustains about the peerless beauty of Greek art and Greek
  character, and the massive wisdom and integrity of Roman law and
  administration, has been and still is a blight upon the creative impulses of
  modern life. In schools and in colleges it is, and, considering the sort of
  man who will generally have to impart it, it must always be, a deadening
  grammatical grind. It consumes the scanty time of our youth, it eats up the
  time-table, so that any effectual broadening study of other things cannot
  co-exist with it. It presents the history of mankind grotesquely out of
  perspective; it saturates its victims with a pro-Hellenic, pro-Latin
  partisanship that perverts their judgment of all historical processes. Its
  material being languages and&mdash;in a lesser degree&mdash;literature, dead,
  pickled, and without any power of growth or fresh combination, it is, before
  anything else, a training in stereotyped expression and stereotyped forms of
  thought. At the present time, in the face of the world's present needs, it is
  impossible to regard a school or college presided over by a classical scholar
  and devoted to the classical tradition as anything but a dead and
  death-diffusing spot in our educational system. This new offensive against
  the proper education of our children, to which the British Classical
  Association gives such definite expression, is a thing essentially evil, a
  thing which any servant of creative civilisation must fight at any cost. We
  cannot afford to sacrifice our convictions to politeness and pretend that we
  think the classically trained mind anything better than a warped and
  restricted and mischievously infectious mind.</p>

  <p>We need a world-wide common education of which the history of life and the
  sciences of life and matter are the two main divisions, in which drawing,
  mathematics, and living languages are studied as tools and methods of
  expression and not as subjects in themselves, and in which music is properly
  utilised in the development of aesthetic perception. In such a modern
  education the dead languages and literature can play only a subordinate and
  illustrative and properly proportioned part.</p>

  <h2><a id="art22"
     name="art22">LENIN: PRIVATE CAPITALISM AGAINST COMMUNISM</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">9.2.1924</p>

  <p class="first">So Lenin is dead at last. He dies on the eve of the
  recognition of the Soviet Government by the Western Powers. For most
  practical purposes the work of Lenin was over before 1920. His death now or a
  little later will make only the smallest difference in the destinies of
  Russia.</p>

  <p>For the Communist Party which still controls Russia has this in common
  with the Catholic Church, that it is sustained by a system of dogmas,
  disciplines and, now, experiences and traditions so much stronger than any
  single individual, that individuals, though they may serve it more or less
  effectively, cannot control nor deflect it. They must move inside its
  limitations. Russia, under the Communist rule, is at the opposite pole to
  such a phase of affairs as would evoke a Caesarism. It is over the Western
  Latin democracies, subjected to the adventures and ravages of uncontrolled
  rich men, that the dictators arise. Lenin was never in reality a dictator as
  Mussolini is a dictator. He impressed one as being in the grip of forces
  quite beyond his control, albeit they are forces he had himself helped to
  develop and organise. Communism is definite, directive, compelling; Fascism
  is dramatic and empty, a puerile, vague, violent thing, a young ass to be
  ridden anywhere by a bold, competent rider. A score of Lenins might die and
  Communism would go on as though nothing had changed. Without Mussolini the
  Fascisti might do anything&mdash;fall into a torrent, get lost, destroy
  society, vanish.</p>

  <p>I saw Lenin in 1920 in the Kremlin. He was an extraordinarily fragile
  little thing, small hands clasped together upon the corner of his desk and
  little feet that dangled from his chair far off the ground. He was very bald.
  I learn now with astonishment that I was the older man. He put his amusing
  Mongoloid face a little on one side as we talked, with something of the wary
  expression of a fencer. When he found out I didn't want to score points for
  or against Communism, but to learn what they proposed to do next and
  particularly what they proposed to do about the peasants, he dropped any
  appearance of controversy and laid his views and plans before me very
  frankly.</p>

  <p>In return I tried to tell him things about England, but he seemed to have
  been stuffed up with a lot of nonsense about British conditions. He believed
  that a certain obscure paper called the <i>Dreadnought</i>, or the <i>Woman's
  Dreadnought</i>, or some such title, edited by Miss Sylvia Pankhurst,
  represented millions of insurgent British proletarians, and that the violent
  struggle then going on in Ireland was, in some slightly obscured form, a
  struggle between Capitalism and Communism. It was difficult to readjust his
  perspectives.</p>

  <p>His schemes for the reorganisation of Russia seemed to me to be
  right-minded, honestly conceived, and very, very artless. He had a scheme for
  the "Electrification of Russia" that struck my usually quite sufficiently
  imaginative mind as hopelessly impractical. It ignored distances, and Russia
  is a country consisting mostly of distances.</p>

  <p>I suppose no gambler who stakes his all upon a single throw against great
  odds and wins was ever so astonished as the Bolsheviks when they came into
  power in 1917. They went into Russia like good revolutionists to make trouble
  and die. They found themselves presently in scarcely disputed possession of a
  completely exhausted country. Even in 1920 they seemed still a little
  incredulous to find themselves still there. Never was there such rant and
  nonsense as the stuff Mr. Winston Churchill, for example, talks about the
  Bolsheviks seizing upon and ruining Russia. So far from seizing, there was
  nothing to oppose them but brigands and hopelessly incapable military
  adventurers, and so far from ruining, the ruin was already complete. In this
  chaos the Bolsheviks grasped power, according to all the accepted
  revolutionary examples. There was not so much an organised resistance to
  their seizure as a lawless disregard. They had to shoot. All revolutionists
  have to shoot. It is their privilege and their danger. But it is usually
  conceded that the Bolsheviks shot too much and went on shooting too long, and
  acquired almost a habit of shooting.</p>

  <p>It is not that they were bloodthirsty men, but that they were
  inexperienced and unprepared. They murdered in a fit of Russian nerves. And
  they were equally inexperienced and unprepared for the task of government,
  once their power was secure. They served Russia well in defending her from
  France, Poland, Churchill, Kolchak, Yudenich, Deniken, Wrangel, and all the
  evil horde that beset her from without, but they rebuilt within slowly and
  experimentally and wastefully. And they had the bad luck of two famine
  years.</p>

  <p>Still, they are on their feet now; they are making headway, and it is from
  the red root of Communist theory that the new Russian order will grow. It is
  manifestly destined to be a very great system, a United States in the Old
  World, stretching from the Baltic to the Pacific.</p>

  <p>It is very important to grasp the fact that the former Russian political
  and social order was bankrupt and collapsed of its own accord, because it is
  the lesson that the private adventurers of the West are most loath to learn.
  Communism is not a dragon that devours healthy States; it is rather the
  scavenger of the rotten and fallen. You cannot say, for example, that
  Communism is either very strong nor spreading very rapidly as an aggressive
  doctrine in Europe. And yet it may still come to prevail over great parts of
  Europe. Europe is sick and obstinately set against its own cure; the decay of
  its monetary system (without which, as Mr. Keynes has pointed out, private
  capitalism is a totally unworkable system) spreads, and the European
  community, saturated with ideas of eager private gain, destitute of a
  sufficiently strong sense of the collective good, and enslaved by narrow
  individualistic and partisan and patriotic obsessions, makes no effort
  sufficiently comprehensive and intelligent to attest the decay. The European
  system is not being seriously attacked from without at the present time, and
  least of all by Communism; the whole Communist propaganda in Western Europe
  does not amount to much more than the advertisement organisation of a
  typewriter seller or a patent medicine vendor. But the European system is
  being attacked from within by its own speculators and profit-makers, its
  tariffs and its combines for the restraint and deflection of trade. It has
  taught all its children competitive self-seeking, and it crumbles and
  collapses now for the lack of creative effort.</p>

  <p>I am not one of those who minimise and detract from the great achievements
  of the nineteenth century, and deep in my nature is a craving for
  irresponsible liberty. Temperamentally I dislike Communism. I am a
  collectivist but not a Communist. I have always clung and still cling to the
  belief that the sprawling social and economic life in which I have grown up
  might be progressively organised into a secure, generous, and scientific
  system without any abrupt and violent destructive change. But I must confess
  to a deepening and increasing doubt whether the present European system can
  right itself. The collapse continues so steadily and disconcertingly. The
  little nations sit within their boundaries scheming for small advantages,
  none heeding the general good. Germany follows Russia; her enemies without
  and her "big-business" fools within have prepared another great area in which
  the Communist may make his experiments. And the collapse shows no tendency to
  end at the Rhine. The Western exchanges totter.</p>

  <p>It may be that the hopes of such as I are excessive, that tinkering cannot
  save the European system now, that it is destined to profounder and more
  drastic changes than we are willing to admit as necessary. Perhaps the root
  is too rotten with self-seeking. Perhaps the Communist, with all his faults,
  his wastefulness and ugliness of method, has something vital to teach the
  world, if it is no more than discipline and devoted subordination to large
  ideas. Perhaps the whole European system, like Russia, may after all need to
  be regrafted upon this new strange root of Communism before it enters upon a
  fresh creative phase. I do not know. But it is plain to me that the years
  pass and the recovery of Europe does not begin.</p>

  <h2><a id="art23"
     name="art23">THE FANTASIES OF MR. BELLOC<br>
  AND THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">16.2.1924</p>

  <p class="first">Mr. Belloc has written a small imposing book about America
  and England, called The Contrast. Small it is in length and substance, but
  imposing in its English edition at least by reason of large print, vast
  margins, thick paper, and all that makes a book physically impressive. It is
  the sort of book that has the first sentence of Chapter I on page nine. To
  the student of current events it is a very noteworthy book indeed. It betrays
  the drift of a very complex group of forces at work in our educational,
  journalistic, and literary world, a group of forces desiring the separation
  of America from Europe, clamouring for the disengagement of America from
  participation in the development of a new phase of civilisation, and the
  arrest of that development.</p>

  <p>Mr. Belloc is too often treated by American and English critics as a
  merely comic figure. Comic figure no doubt this bulky, gesticulating
  Frenchman is, with his pretensions to an enormous bibulousness, with his
  affectation of a fastidious but non-existent scholarship, with the immense
  emphasis of his wild impromptu classifications and his magnificent caricature
  of a victorious dialectic. His prose style becomes more and more wonderfully
  suggestive of the after-dinner talker at his richest and joiliest. The sudden
  lapses into intense whispering italics; the abrupt glorification of some
  phrase by the thick loud enunciation of unexpected capitals! He is quick to
  imitate any form of dignity, even the dignity of the scientific exponent at
  his solemnest. Could anything be more sublimely funny, for instance, than
  this pseudo-illuminating experiment to illustrate the profound truth (in
  italics) that "intense individual contact and energy make for
  uniformity"?</p>

  <p>"Put a number of smooth, round balls upon a billiard table. Give them each
  a slow and slight movement, and you will see no general movement appearing.
  There will be little clatter, few and rare collisions. Impart to them each a
  very rapid motion, that is, an individual intensity, and while you raise very
  greatly the noise of the shocks (which is a superficial phenomenon), and
  while you increase even more the number and frequency of collisions (which is
  the cause of the noise), you also soon develop a resultant of all the
  directions. If the sharp speed of each be maintained you will soon perceive
  in the movement of the whole a general swing, and all that great mass of
  balls will be moving in a crowd. So it is with a human society."</p>

  <p>One likes to think of that rosy dinner party adjourned to the
  billiard-room and "put thesh soshial lawsh into practish" by imparting the
  motion as directed.</p>

  <p>But apart from the almost willfully preposterous side of Mr. Belloc there
  is much to interest us in him profoundly. He is vigorously expressive; he
  speaks for forces in our community that are more often silently active; he
  gives resistances animation. The least original of contemporary writers, he
  has retained the leading ideas of an upbringing that was essentially Catholic
  and Latin in a practically inflexible form. His world, after a few merely
  preparatory phases and with a polite gesture to the Greeks, begins and ends
  with Rome. His mind in this age of tumultuous growth is like a naughty and
  growing child refusing to be put into larger clothes. And yet he is not blind
  to the great volume of reality outside that narrow old-fashioned scheme of
  his. He is not a blind man; he has at once vision and an extreme obstinacy.
  He feels and denies the passing of mediaeval Europe, he struggles against his
  realisation of the coming of a new order in the world, which shall
  comprehend, for example, Siberia and China and America, and a world-wide
  culture into which Islam and Christendom, the wisdom of India and China and
  the science of Britain and Germany and America and France and North Italy and
  Russia and Japan shall alike fall and be fused. One probable factor in this
  synthesis will be the English language, the great political and scientific
  traditions it carries with it, and the band of English-speaking communities,
  still growing and still crude, which will bring those traditions into
  fruitful relationships with a thousand new conditions and a thousand new
  climatic conditions. Rome will have a scarcely more important place in an
  English-knitted world than Babylon.</p>

  <p>And so Mr. Belloc beats himself against the growing strength of this great
  net of civilised understandings. It does not exist. The languages diverge.
  The Americans are more foreign to the British than any Western Europeans. The
  British are a slightly detached part of some general Western European
  culture. A Frenchman can understand Keats and an American cannot. Americans
  are "egalitarian" and the British profoundly aristocratic. The decay of
  British aristocracy is the end of Britain, but there is always France to fall
  back upon. The American military mind is French in spirit. A Bellocian storm
  of such assertions swirls through the entire book, aggressive in manner,
  self-protective in motive. He emerges where he began. The Americans do not
  belong to "our" system&mdash;"our" meaning the intimate close brotherhood of
  British and French and Italians and Spanish and so forth, the British rather
  marginal to the Latin Catholic world. The Americans are a "New
  Thing"&mdash;capitals; they are a new culture outside the Western European
  culture. They are a "new race." They must follow their own destinies and "we"
  ours.</p>

  <p>Mr. Belloc is writing for American as much as for English readers, and he
  shows a care for their susceptibilities. But one or two possibilities gleam
  through, possibilities of a reassuring sort for his dear old Western European
  world. There may be biological forces at work; "a new race, the fate of
  which, to survive or to die, we know not." Or this great new world may
  presently fall into social disorder, division&mdash;and insignificance.</p>

  <p>This is the essence of Mr. Belloc's argument to estrange Americans and
  Europeans, and particularly the Americans and British. Is it sound? So far as
  the differences go one concedes the vividness of Mr. Belloc's vision. (His
  opening account of the different qualities of American and European scenery,
  by the way, is an amazingly good piece of writing.) But do the Americans
  present either a new race or even a new culture? I deny both these
  propositions. They are racially a still largely unfused mixture of Europeans,
  and the novel features of their social and cultural life merely mark a new
  phase into which the British and the European and the Slav cultures are all
  following America. That is to say, I do not believe that America is diverging
  upon a line of her own, but is simply ahead along a path that the other great
  constituents of the coming world community must all presently follow.</p>

  <p>Let us state the case briefly and simply. Nobody who knows anything of the
  facts of the case regards the citizens of the United States as a sort of
  transplanted Britisher; but with the exception of certain coloured millions
  and certain Red Indian survivals they are manifestly transplanted Europeans,
  whose political institutions were originally built up in reaction to the
  Hanoverian monarchy and as a development of and in close sympathy with
  European liberalism and British nonconformity. This community of transplanted
  Europeans had the good fortune to have no strong military neighbour, and it
  had an almost virgin continent into which to expand. This good fortune
  enabled the States to realise very swiftly the full social and political
  possibilities of steamboat, railway, and electric communication.</p>

  <p>They have developed a great State on the modern scale, with an
  unprecedented unity and uniformity of general ideas. A little too favoured by
  their immunities, they have not perhaps made so good a pace as they might
  have done with their general elementary education, but altogether their
  progress has been marvellous. The congested and entangled States of Western
  Europe&mdash;I leave out the Russian and British systems, which are neither
  of them truly European&mdash;are destined to achieve an ultimate unity under
  the same irresistible forces of transport that have expanded and held
  together the American United States. Their unification may be complicated or
  arrested by the unavoidable interweaving of the Slav and British systems with
  their destinies, and it is surely impossible for anyone outside the Belloc
  type of mentality to imagine either English-speaking or Latin-speaking
  America having neither voice nor share in the European part of this
  recrystallisation of the world's affairs.</p>

  <p>In this new order of life into which our kind is passing, Roman
  Christendom will become a local tradition and a province, just as Sumeria was
  swallowed up in Babylonia and just as the Empires of Babylon and Egypt became
  memories and provinces in the Empire of Rome. We are not developing new
  races, but merely mingling those we have, and our cultures do not so much
  differentiate as fuse, so we may reasonably hope to have at last one creative
  culture, with many aspects, replacing the partial civilisations of the
  past.</p>

  <p>Fate has imposed it upon Mr. Belloc that he should see these things and
  deny them. His lot, I think, might have been happier had he been born and
  settled in some rich little town in the South of France, and there sat in the
  cafe, drinking his good red wine and orating and denying, without the
  irritation of having seen and known. But it was decreed that he should go to
  America and come back to report a strange and terrible land where the
  mountains are not really mountains nor the rivers rivers, and where a strange
  race grows outside the pale.</p>

  <p>And, an exile in modern England, he has been forced, too, to turn his eyes
  into the depths of the past and see how life arose and how it has come to be
  man and will pass beyond man. And that also he denies, with much banging of
  the little round drum of a table on the <i>terrasse</i>. The American is a
  phantom and geology a lie; the only true world is Latin-made Europe, and if
  Heaven had not created it specially for jolly men, Mr. Belloc would; and in
  the warmth and congenial friendliness of it, Mr. Belloc will sit fighting
  reality with voice and gesture until the good red wine runs out and the sun
  goes down upon him for the last time.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="art24"
     name="art24">A CREATIVE EDUCATIONAL SCHEME FOR BRITAIN:<br>
  A TENTATIVE FORECAST</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">22.2.1924</p>

  <p class="first">The Labour Government of Great Britain starts its career
  with a conservative discretion that should reassure even the most excitable
  inmates of the Rothermere journalistic institutions. For this year at any
  rate we shall get little that we might not have had from a rather left-handed
  Liberal Cabinet. The Social Revolution is in no hurry to arrive.</p>

  <p>The recognition of Russia is all to the good; and the treatment of foreign
  politicians in office as though they were statesmen and the serious little
  visits and talks, are full of promise. If you treat a politician as a
  statesman sufficiently it is possible that he will become one. It is to be
  hoped that the economies upon military things will have a certain courage,
  and that we may see the last of costly Guards' uniforms and such-like gilt on
  the Royal gingerbread, this year. A democratic monarchy with a Labour Prime
  Minister should wear plain clothes. But these are minor matters. The
  immediate test of the Labour Government's quality will be its treatment of
  national education. There is no excuse for just carrying on. The British
  educational policy since the war has been mean and deadly. The children
  insist upon growing up, and at present most of them for all practical
  purposes achieve the status of unemployed adults or undertrained blacklegs at
  fourteen. Secondary and higher education is a dislocated muddle.</p>

  <p>I do not want to undervalue British education. Compared with other
  countries the common citizen of Britain is well educated and well informed.
  He is&mdash;though many Americans are loath to realise this&mdash;better
  educated and better informed than the average American common citizen. But
  compared with what is needed in a great modern State he is pitifully and
  dangerously under-educated. It is impossible for a Labour Government to
  realise its ideal of a highly organised community inspired not by
  profit-hunting but by the spirit of co-operative service, and working and
  producing abundantly for the common good, with the British population at the
  present level of education. To raise that level is a necessary condition to
  the successful extension of public service into economic life and the
  replacement of the money scramble by economic order.</p>

  <p>For this reason Mr. C. P. Trevelyan is for me the most interesting and
  hopeful of all the new Labour Ministers. With his family tradition of high
  scholarship and liberal innovation, and with the new ferment of modern
  creative ideas in his mind, we may hope for a very bold and broad handling of
  the problems of British education. To him is given the opportunity of welding
  the disconnected parts, some quite good and some extremely inadequate or
  defective, which make up the British educational resources of to-day, into
  what may be the first completely comprehensive modern educational system in
  the world.</p>

  <p>The first thing needed for the achievement of such a task is a complete
  and final recognition of the fact that such an education must go on at least
  to the age of sixteen, and that it must include a general knowledge of the
  history of the world and mankind, the elements of political and economic
  science, some knowledge of the methods and scope of biological and physical
  science, and a reasonable acquaintance with and use of at least one foreign
  language. The raising of the leaving age to sixteen was promised some years
  ago by Mr. Fisher, probably the feeblest statesman who has ever been
  overruled by his political associates. That promise was made when Britain was
  to become a land fit for heroes under the eloquent gestures of Mr. Lloyd
  George. It is for Mr. Trevelyan now to make that promise a reality.</p>

  <p>But it is not only upward that the school age should extend, but also
  downward. It should be possible for poor parents who cannot afford a nursery
  to send their children to the people's schools at a quite tender age. The
  children of prosperous people have a governess, or in towns go to some
  properly equipped infant school, by the time they are four or five. The
  children of the working -class woman knock about at home with a mother too
  busy to give them sufficient educational attention, and their only-open air
  is the street. They miss the beginnings of drawing and modelling and
  such-like play; they do not get sufficiently talked to; they get little or no
  music; they start with that much handicap. Vile attempts at economy in
  British education have meant a grave retrogression in this respect. The
  schools have to be reopened to infants, and the facilities for infant
  teaching restored and extended. The public infant school must be the
  day-nursery of the poor.</p>

  <p>Both these extensions of the school age will require more teachers. And
  even as it is, the British schools are scandalously understaffed. Not only is
  that so, but many of the existing staffs are under-trained and under-educated
  for their work. I cannot conceive of British education as a satisfactory
  system with less than quadruple the number of teachers at work than are now
  employed.</p>

  <p>Moreover they have to be better teachers. When British elementary
  education was organised in the 'seventies of the last century it was done in
  the shabbiest and cheapest way possible. Those were the days when
  Englishwomen of the prosperous classes would become half frantic with
  jealousy and hate and derision at the idea of a housemaid wearing a fringe or
  the cook going out in pretty clothes on a Sunday. That was the spirit of the
  time. It was intolerable to them that the poor man's "brats" should be taught
  by really educated persons. The prospective teachers of the general public,
  therefore, were not sent through the Universities and made a part of the
  general comity of educated men and women. They were put apart into mean,
  bleak, restricted training colleges of their own, and everything was done to
  establish and maintain a sense of social inferiority in their minds. They
  were intended to feel the superiority of the parson and the lordship of the
  manufacturer and the squire. Never has a profession risen to self-respect
  against such obstacles and disadvantages as the British elementary teachers.
  It is for Mr. Trevelyan to complete the expansion and liberalisation of these
  training colleges, to see that they get at last the staffs, libraries,
  laboratories, and facilities of interchange necessary to incorporate them
  completely in the university system of the land. Or else to hand them over to
  the local authorities as lunatic asylums or something of that sort or to
  reconstruct them to meet the housing shortage, or just simply to dynamite
  them and send the whole of the next generation of teachers through the
  Universities.</p>

  <p>Having secured an adequate supply of soundly trained and educated
  teachers, and with the whole youthful population&mdash;except those attending
  the many excellent private preparatory schools in Britain&mdash;going up to
  the age of sixteen, at least, to the publicly maintained schools, it will be
  possible for Mr. Trevelyan to give his mind to the very urgent problem of
  grading schools. The organisers of elementary education in Britain, like the
  American fathers, seem to have thought that a school was just a school. But
  children under the age of twelve require very different educational
  surroundings from those between twelve and sixteen. The Junior school may
  well be a mixed village school as close to mother as possible, a small
  school, bright and homelike. The Second school needs to be larger, and with a
  various staff; children are already differentiating after twelve, there must
  be a choice of studies, one child's education is another child's poison.
  Moreover, the equipment needed at the second stage is greater and more
  various. Educational centres are indicated here, and the automobile to
  collect the youngsters comes happily into the world at this stage to enable
  both Britain and America to meet the demands of an advancing civilisation
  upon rural youth.</p>

  <p>Over most of Britain the market towns lie at eight or ten miles apart; the
  roads converge upon them, they are the natural places for the Second schools.
  Here is a very pretty and, I should think, a very congenial task of
  reorganisation for Mr. Trevelyan. Like Edward VI of England, it may be his
  destiny to write his name upon England with a trail of new and reconstructed
  schools.</p>

  <p>But an educational system that secures merely a proper education for every
  British boy or girl up to the age of sixteen is only the broad foundation of
  a complete State education. The English "Public Schools," which are not
  really public at all, and which retain their boys in a state of loutish
  athleticism two years or more after they should be at college; the miscellany
  of "upper-class" girls' schools; the Universities, that are partly
  continuation colleges and partly Universities for real intellectual work and
  interchange, much incommoded by undergraduates' "rags," solemn athleticism,
  and a pervading adolescent clamour; the antiquated and boring legal and
  medical professional training; and, indeed, the whole tangle of
  class-conscious, middle-and upper-class educational institutions in Britain,
  would be enormously benefited, and I hope will be benefited, by a
  bold&mdash;even though it were at the time an entirely
  unsuccessful&mdash;attempt at reorganisation upon modern lines.</p>

  <p>Once people have been set thinking about these things they will never stop
  as they are. The mischief at present is that we take the most preposterous
  arrangements for granted because we are used to them. It will not be
  necessary to stir the venerable quiet, the tradition, and ripe usages of
  Oxford and Cambridge very greatly. Somewhere the fine traditions of classical
  scholarship and stylistic mathematics should be preserved, and these seem to
  be their appointed refuges. But there is now a constellation of other and
  more conveniently situated provincial Universities which are still miserably
  cramped and poor. For all that, several are doing quite first-class
  University work. And there exists now in London, in spite of neglect and
  misdirection, a great group of literary, artistic, scientific, and legal
  institutions which cry aloud to be grouped and correlated upon broad and
  congenial lines as the effective intellectual nucleus of the British Empire,
  and even perhaps of the English-speaking world. It is to the loosely
  co-ordinated institutions within and without the present so-called University
  of London that I hope Mr. Trevelyan will chiefly direct his attention as the
  apex of the pyramid I hope to see arising, based on the existing preparatory
  school, on the re-fashioned "Public School," relieved of its too mature
  seniors, and on the revised and strengthened free Junior and Second schools
  which should take the place of our existing elementary schools.</p>

  <h2><a id="art25"
     name="art25">PORTUGAL AND PROSPERITY:<br>
  THE BLESSEDNESS OF BEING A LITTLE NATION</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">1.3.1924</p>

  <p class="first">For several weeks just recently I was cut off from Britain
  and America and most of the things that interest me in the world by a postal
  strike in Portugal. It was an original sort of strike. The little dears went
  to their offices and so forth, and just did nothing until the Government kept
  a promise to raise salaries. Telegrams and letters coagulated in masses that
  are still incompletely dissolved. Some of the more humorous of the strikers
  mixed up the letters, and delivered considerable numbers at the wrong
  addresses, where many perished miserably. Meanwhile I read the Lisbon
  <i>Diario de Noticias</i>, which has about as much foreign news as the
  <i>West Sussex Gazette</i>, and meditated on Portugal. To which country I had
  come, by the by, because it was within three days' post of England and a most
  convenient cable centre.</p>

  <p>Portugal has a climate that is always interesting and generally
  delightful. It has its wild phases of sea-wind and passionate rain, and then
  the only thing to do here at Estoril&mdash;except work&mdash;is to go to the
  western headlands and see the green Atlantic waves hit the cliffs and explode
  into vast mountains of sunlit foam. And to get caught and drenched by a
  rainstorm, and so home. Or the north wind blows, and usually it is the north
  wind that blows, and then the air is as keen and sweet as Alpine air and the
  sky is blazing blue. The flowers are astonishing. There is purple iris in all
  the water courses; the banks are alive with periwinkle and tall spikes of
  antirrhinum; in the woods are endless scillas and rock roses. The other day I
  walked over a shrubby moorland and there I came upon a great multitude of
  upstanding clumps of a sort of white heather, rather big and round with the
  tips and shadows just tinged with pink, and everywhere among these clumps
  there crept a gentian-blue flower&mdash;lithospermum I think it is. And not a
  soul was there to appreciate this lavish loveliness except myself and another
  chance wanderer from the beaten track.</p>

  <p>Wet or fine, the air of Portugal has a natural happiness in it, and the
  people of the country should be as happy and prosperous as any people in the
  world. The country has a magnificent position, and great overseas
  possessions. Lisbon is the natural port of Europe for South America and West
  Africa. The olive and the orange and such-like things can be grown here under
  the best conditions. The very various and great, though largely undeveloped,
  mineral wealth includes radioactive deposits of worldwide importance. And so
  forth. There is indeed all the material here for great prosperity. As a
  matter of fact, I have never seen a less prosperous-looking nation. Great
  poverty prevails throughout this land. I have never seen anywhere, not even
  in Russia, working people so ill-clad, so patched and ragged, so manifestly
  neglected and under-nourished. And there is also a vast amount of preventable
  disease. The women are old at thirty, bearing children to die; the men are
  bent at fifty. The poorer houses are hovels, and half the population is
  illiterate. And yet it is not a low-grade population. It is varied in type
  and complexion, but there is a conspicuously high proportion of intelligent
  and interesting faces, and the manners of the people have much of that
  geniality of the air they breathe.</p>

  <p>Why is this country so conspicuously poor? Why are its roads so abominable
  that even between this prosperous pleasure resort of Estoril and Lisbon, a
  dozen miles away, an automobile journey is a dangerous adventure? Why are my
  letters and cables decaying in the Lisbon post-offIce, and why does everyone
  say that things are going from bad to worse, and hope for such violent
  remedies as a dictatorship? In no part of Europe is the riddle of European
  decay posed so plainly as it is here in this setting of windy sunshine and
  gay colour and natural wealth.</p>

  <p>The full answer to that riddle so far as it concerns Portugal would
  involve a long history. But certain broad operating causes may be noted. All
  Europe suffers from division, but it is in the smaller countries that the
  evils of division are most apparent. The smaller the country the nearer the
  Custom House and the more hampered the trade. Lisbon might be one of the
  greatest ports of Europe as Beira in Portuguese Africa might be the chief
  port of South Africa, but for this, that a little way behind each is a
  national frontier with a strangulating Custom House. No goods or passengers
  will endure the present railway journey through Spain and Portugal if they
  can find another way to the high seas. The railways are necessarily short
  little railways and they are ineffIcient. And every sort of transport, and
  indeed every concern depending upon organised labour, is further troubled by
  another consequence of the sub-division of Europe. The money is unstable.
  Portugal, like every proud little sovereign State, must, of course, have its
  own currency. Anything else would be unthinkable to the patriotic Portuguese.
  But the currency of so small a country is at the mercy of big speculative
  interests abroad. The recent postal strike turned entirely upon the
  readjustment of wages to rising prices. That is the common issue in nearly
  all European labour struggles now, but it produces its acutest conflicts in
  the weaker countries.</p>

  <p>The railways of Portugal are in a very bad condition and the roads are
  frightful. Everywhere there are the visible evidences of incompetent or
  corrupt administration. A little country like this, with an unstable
  currency; cannot keep its popular education up to date; there is not a
  sufficient reading public therefore to sustain an authoritative Press and
  literature of political criticism. Ministers are not sufficiently watched.
  And as to the things that happen in the overseas possessions of Portugal one
  can hardly learn anything at all from the Portuguese Press. No "public
  opinion" seems to be watching them at all. There is a distraction of interest
  to other centres. Portuguese who grow rich in the Portuguese possessions bank
  and invest their money abroad, chiefly in London; there is a perpetual
  outgoing of this tribute from the Portuguese empire to the stabler, greater
  States. Nowhere else in Europe has one so strong a feeling of a country in
  pawn to capital held abroad.</p>

  <p>It seems to me that the full exercise of national sovereignty in Portugal
  lies at the root of all its present troubles. It is a convenient specimen, so
  to speak, of the universal European disease: the attempt to treat what are
  now only parts of a system as though they were still complete wholes. Its
  absolute independence, instead of securing its people the full benefits of
  freedom and all the material possibilities of the land, is the very thing
  that keeps the country dependent upon big international financial and
  business interests. If Portugal, instead of standing alone with its colonies
  to fight the financial and economic forces of the world, were part of a
  combine of States, acting together politically, financially, and
  economically, it would be in a far better case than it is at the present
  time. I have no doubt in my own mind that if Portugal were a free State in a
  larger union in which sovereignty was sufficiently merged to ensure a common
  currency, a common inter-State traffic control, free trade at least within
  the union, common labour conditions, and a common front to the speculative
  forces that are destroying Europe, her outlook would be vastly different from
  what it is to-day. She would very speedily cease to be a land of slovenly and
  increasingly inaccessible loveliness, and her people would no longer be the
  most lamentably wasted nation in Europe.</p>

  <p>And I do not see that such a union is a very remote or improbable thing. A
  congress of Latin Pressmen has recently been held in Lisbon, and beneath a
  turbid flow of compliments and flatteries there were many signs of a real and
  practical recognition of the possibility of, and the enormous material
  advantages of, a federation of Latin Europe and Latin America. There seems to
  be a growing recognition in Portugal, Spain, Italy, France, and Latin America
  of the essential similarity of the Latin civilisation in all this wide
  patchwork of States. It may lead sooner than English-speaking people expect
  to practical political co-operation. From the point of view of world
  civilisation all such agglomerations of States, that will gradually relax the
  intensity of nationalist concentration, are desirable and welcome
  developments.</p>

  <h2><a id="art26"
     name="art26">RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS:<br>
  THE PRACTICAL PROBLEM</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">8.3.1924</p>

  <p class="first">If the world had suddenly become rational in November 1918,
  I suppose there would have been a conference of all the Powers of the world
  to atone for their common sins and restore their common welfare. But as the
  world is some thousands of years yet from rational collective conduct we have
  the treaty of the Victors, the Demi-League of Nations, and all the post-war
  disorder, waste, and misery that still unfold upon us. The League is
  unsoundly planned; it stands on rotten foundations; it is poisoned by the
  delusion that sovereign States are real enduring human things instead of
  being arrangements entirely provisional and largely hallucinatory, and it
  does not represent more than a portion of mankind. Still, there is talk of at
  last bringing in Russia and Germany, and it will be interesting to see how
  the people who have got hold of it will set about tinkering up an arrangement
  with the German people and the Russian Soviet States.</p>

  <p>In Britain and America there are considerable organisations for the
  glorification of the League of Nations. In Britain, in the countryside
  especially, the League of Nations Union has become a social feature, rather
  like a more liberal Primrose League; it has pleasant meetings, parties,
  bazaars, tennis tournaments, fêtes with sack races, and so forth, and no
  parliamentary candidate can afford to neglect it; but it has no ideas worth
  speaking about of how the problems of a world organisation are to be
  approached. It just glorifies, simply and loyally. At the beginning of the
  League of Nations Union a few of us made a desperate attempt to establish a
  Research Department in the organisation. We felt there were a lot of things
  we didn't know and that had to be known about the psychology of international
  co-operation, a lot of questions about scope and method that wanted hammering
  out, and that the time was short before action was thrust upon us. It was,
  however, impossible to get anything effective done. Few of our colleagues
  realised that there was anything in the business that could not be settled at
  once by anyone with a good heart and a clear, loud voice; that Research
  Department faded out in the platitudinous blaze of Lord Grey's great meeting
  in Westminster; and then Mr. and Mrs. Wilson came to Europe, and upon the
  wave of their coming this present League of Nations, such as it is, a
  ramshackle raft of political misconceptions, achieved its magnificent launch.
  Future generations will study its incredible constitution in a desperate
  attempt to realise the full mental slovenliness of our times. Personally, I
  am for a world conference to take it down and build something better, but
  that is because I have a simple, straightforward mind. What everyone will
  consider more practicable and more politic will be to alter it bit by bit and
  worry it round, tortuously and expensively, towards the form of a League of
  Mankind against Nations, that it ought to have been from the beginning.</p>

  <p>Now how are Germany and the Union of Soviet States coming into the League?
  Are they to come in as Boss States, like the British Empire, with a parcel of
  accessory faggot votes representing Dominions and Possessions, or are they to
  come in on a footing with Haiti, the Hedjaz, Abyssinia, and so forth? Will
  they come in as the equals of Abyssinia? I would like to know the ideas of
  the Prime Minister upon this question. I do not think the present
  constitution of the League of Nations allows them to come in on any tolerable
  terms at all. That being so, it follows that any attempt to bring in either
  or both of these great masses of people will involve a special conference to
  reconstruct the League; the League will have to liquidate and reconstruct
  itself. Both Germany and Russia, that land of new ideas, may have some bold
  proposals to make. In Britain we have had little but fulsome praise or angry
  exposure of the League since it was set up at Geneva. In America it has been
  talked about endlessly, but I do not know if it has been thought about at
  all.</p>

  <p>In France there are signs of an awakening to the needs of a reconstructed
  League. M. Bertrand, of the <i>Quotidien</i>, calls for a League that shall
  represent peoples and not Governments, and proclaims that the first article
  of the Republican Credo. The time is at hand when the League might be very
  beneficially altered, given a better balance, and made more serviceable to
  mankind.</p>

  <p>One cardinal evil could be attacked and at least minimised: the absurd
  pretence that anything with the legal status of a sovereign State is a
  nation, a people, a thing with a distinctive soul and an individuality,
  entitled to full and equal consideration in the counsels of mankind. It is to
  this we owe the intolerable absurdity that while such highly individualised
  people as the Scotch and Welsh have no voice as such in the world's affairs,
  a trumped-up State like the Hedjaz votes and speaks on an equality with
  Holland or Denmark, and that while one group of black barbarians is solemnly
  welcomed as Abyssinia (that age-long friend of Poland) the far better
  educated and altogether more civilised Zulu and Basuto peoples must be
  represented by a tenth of the coat-tails&mdash;it works out at about that, I
  believe&mdash;of Lord Cecil. If nations and races are all to be represented,
  then India is full of them, from the Veddahs upward; if sovereign
  independence is the standard, then India has no rightful place at Geneva. But
  if we recognise fully that the League we need is to serve the purposes not of
  nations but of mankind, then we shall cease to be embarrassed either
  logically or practically by political oddities or ethnological rarities.</p>

  <p>Let us consider in its crudest form a possible alternative. Should the
  League of Nations be put upon a population basis and should its members have
  a card vote after the pattern of a British Trade Union Congress, in which
  each representative has votes in proportion to the number of workers he
  represents? This would give an undesirably heavy voting power to the
  quasi-representatives of great barbaric illiterate populations. In world
  affairs an illiterate population can have no will because it can have no
  knowledge. But supposing voting power were given in proportion to the number
  of literates in a population or to the number of University students. Then we
  should at least get some sort of approximation to the relative intelligence
  and power of the various States. And suppose that subject to this definition
  of voting power every State sent just as few or just as many representatives
  to the Assembly and appointed them or selected them and distributed its votes
  among them as it thought fit. And suppose the council were appointed, not by
  nations, but indifferently by the vote of the Assembly. Then at Geneva we
  should really be getting towards something like a representation of the
  civilisation of the world or of the civilisation of as much of the world as
  took part in it. We really should have a body with authority behind it,
  capable of handling something more than the petty arbitrations and the
  necessary small arrangements of international affairs, of which the present
  propagandists of the League of Nations make such boasts.</p>

  <p>It is amazing how unable people seem to be to realise the full danger of
  an assembly entirely dominated by the idea of competitive nationalism, and
  the urgent necessity of getting away from that idea, however great the mental
  exertion required. For suppose presently Mr. MacDonald is successful in
  getting in Russia and Germany, and suppose the League begins to handle such
  larger questions as disarmament, European currency, tariffs, and so forth,
  then just as the interests involved become greater, so much the more
  nationalist will the spirit of the delegates and representatives become. The
  League gatherings under the present constitution will certainly become
  battlegrounds of great nationalist interests. The dear little smaller States
  will be drawn into groups and alliances about the greater States. They will
  not be able to help themselves. Their votes will be cowed and bullied or
  bribed votes. So long as the members go to Geneva to represent not mankind
  but national Governments they will go there in a diplomatic, bargaining, and
  competitive spirit. There will develop a pro-French or pro-British group, and
  an anti-French or anti-British group; the alliances and antagonisms of
  another great war may easily work themselves out upon the floor of the League
  gatherings. That all the nations of Europe and under European influence may
  have been got to meet in Geneva will in itself be no more a guarantee of
  peace than was the meeting of the United States Congress before the election
  of President Lincoln a guarantee of peace in America. It is a matter of
  supreme importance to the whole world that before it is too late this body
  which we now call the League of Nations should be denationalised and put upon
  a cosmopolitan basis.</p>

  <h2><a id="art27"
     name="art27">THE LABOUR PARTY ON TRIAL:<br>
  THE FOLLY OF THE FIVE CRUISERS</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">15.3.1924</p>

  <p class="first">I HAVE recently been watching British politics from a rather
  interesting angle; I have been seeing Britain through Latin eyes from the
  Portuguese corner of Europe. Events come to me generally in this order. First
  the Lisbon <i>Diario des Noticias</i> comes in with my coffee; next day the
  French <i>Quotidien</i> arrives before lunch and the Italian <i>Secolo</i> at
  dinner, and there is usually another twenty-four hours before a bundle of
  London papers comes to hand. The Paris <i>Daily Mail</i> or the <i>Action
  Française</i> may come in neck and neck with the <i>Quotidien</i>, but I
  don't go out of my way to see them. I get no American papers at all. In this
  perspective the death of Dr. Theophilo Braga, a sort of Frederic Harrison,
  who was the first President of the Portuguese Republic, and a congress of
  Latin Pressmen in Lisbon take on the importance of considerable international
  events, and all that looms largest in the London <i>Times</i> or the American
  Press undergoes a compression that amounts at times to complete effacement.
  That stupid outrage upon civilisation, the deportation of Miguel de Unamuno,
  the great rector of the University of Salamanca, to the Canary-Islands
  because of his disrespect for the Spanish monarchy and dictatorship gets a
  large Press in all these Latin countries. It matters to them. It ought to
  matter to every civilised man. The petroleum scandals in the United States
  get a rather muddled attention; every country has the oil scandals it
  deserves; and there were important articles upon the death of President
  Wilson. In its day the coming of the League of Nations was a great event.
  Otherwise there has been very little notice either of the United States or
  the overseas Empire of Britain. America means Brazil, and "overseas"
  Angola.</p>

  <p>The Latin mind has always inclined to be sceptical and cynical about the
  League of Nations. Was it Anglo-Saxon practicality or Anglo-Saxon hypocrisy
  behind this new thing? Did the Americans and British mean what the League
  seemed to mean, or was it just another of their deep inexplicable manoeuvres?
  The doubts have long since carried the day. The Paris <i>Quotidien</i>
  supports the League, indeed, but it concerns itself very little about the
  criticism or creative reconstruction of the League, as it would do if it
  regarded the concern as a working reality. It treats the whole business as a
  sort of ethical deep breathing&mdash;good chiefly for the soul. When it
  refers to it, a note of piety comes into its style.</p>

  <p>The arrival of a Labour Government in Britain was a matter for lively
  attention in all these Latin lands. Liberal thinkers everywhere welcomed it
  with a hopefulness that was only very faintly tainted by suspicion. Here,
  perhaps, was a new thing, a break in the age-long British tradition of heavy
  national selfishness and overbearing self-righteousness. Bits of election
  addresses, Labour manifestos, and so forth, had filled up columns and carried
  headlines in every paper from Oporto to Fiume and from Mexico to Buenos
  Aires. This Labour stood for a reconstituted League of Nations, with wider
  powers; it stood for a generous treatment of Russia and Germany; it stood for
  disarmament; it stood for a universal retrenchment of military and naval
  expenditure and a surcease of grabbing and exploitation. Once again, just as
  with the League of Nations, the Latin Press betrayed the peculiar power which
  the great English-speaking community might and could exercise, of putting
  over broad political ideas to the world at large. There is a natural
  reciprocity between the mind of the Latin community and ours; it is far more
  delicately critical and far less rudely creative. We can do much to sustain
  or destroy its faith. It can do much to clarify our ideas.</p>

  <p>The first utterances of the new Government were scanned with exceptional
  closeness; the gestures of Mr. Ramsay MacDonald were watched with ten times
  the attention that was ever given to Mr. Baldwin's. The prompt recognition of
  Russia was widely approved of; the rather empty politenesses towards M.
  Poincaré were taken as evidence of an essential goodness of heart and a
  desire to give him a fair chance&mdash;and then came this business of the
  cruisers. It would be hard to exaggerate its evil effect. The first I saw of
  it was in the Lisbon morning paper. The paragraph was headed "Signor
  MacDonald, Militarist," and the statement was made without any qualification
  that the Labour Government was to lay down the keels of five new cruisers
  forthwith. It seemed incredible. Followed the French and Italian papers. The
  Italians were derisive at this footnote to the disarmament conference at
  Rome, and the French clamoured for six cruisers in reply to the British
  "challenge." The <i>Quotidien</i> was disappointed but not surprised. The
  caricaturists, who do so much in the Latin countries to personify the
  character of nations and peoples, got to work, and are still at work, rubbing
  in this last revelation of the British soul. One discerned the sensitive, the
  irritable Latin mind sick with disgust and bitterly ashamed of itself for its
  folly in supposing for a moment that the Labour programme was anything more
  than electioneering flummery. "Labour" was just a fine name for a group of
  British politicians as dishonest, as basely "patriotic," as dangerous to the
  welfare of Europe as any other group.</p>

  <p>Never has there been so gross, so stupid and needless a sacrifice of moral
  capital in international relations. I do not see how Mr. Ramsay MacDonald can
  ever restore the provisional credit the liberal thought of the Latin States
  had accorded him. The guns of those five cruisers, though not one of them
  ever materialise and though they will certainly prove obsolete weapons before
  they can ever be finished, will have blown the prestige of the British Labour
  Government as a possible European peacemaker to smithereens.</p>

  <p>I will confess I shared this immense disillusionment. As one who had
  written and spoken to the text of the Labour programme at the last general
  election, as one who had explained that the Labour Party at least would have
  the courage for disarmament and a better use for the taxpayers' money than
  battleship building, I did my best to suspend my judgment until the London
  newspapers came to hand with Mr. Ramsay MacDonald's speech upon this issue.
  It seemed impossible that he could have gone the complete Amery he has done.
  I could not believe that he would not have realised that this thing his
  Government has done was not a mere parochial extravagance but an act of
  intense international significance. I expected to find some explanations,
  some palliations, some apology, that could be put before the foreign
  observer. I found a speech&mdash;the rottenest Old Parliamentary Hand could
  not have made a more parliamentary speech. It was in two parts: the first
  part was an ingenious quibble about these ships being merely the replacement
  of "wastage"&mdash;as though the naval equipment of a country was a constant
  thing that had to be kept up to a standard mark instead of being an
  incessantly variable thing&mdash;and the second was a scarcely veiled
  admission that the building of these unnecessary and provocative ships was a
  bribe to the labour in the dockyard constituencies. There was not a word to
  anticipate the inevitable interpretation of the act abroad; there was not an
  indication on the part of this astonishing Foreign Minister that the affair
  would even be observed abroad.</p>

  <p>One does not buy a weapon without an enemy in view, and I am altogether at
  a loss to see what enemy Mr. MacDonald has in view&mdash;unless it is the
  Conservative candidates in the shipbuilding constituencies. Does he think he
  may have to fight France or Italy or Japan or the United States? Those five
  cruisers will be no good in a war with France; we should have to tuck them
  away somewhere and put patrols of submarine chasers to take care of them. In
  a war between France and Britain the mutual suicide, so to speak, would be
  achieved through the air. The cruisers would hardly be of more use against
  Italy. It is Italy, however, which is likely to be most estranged by the
  thought of them. Italy or Japan. Is there a ghost of a chance of a war with
  either the United States or Japan? It is our excellent custom to defer to the
  United States, and we always shall. This leaves Japan.</p>

  <p>Can anything but the blackest folly bring us into a conflict with Japan
  except on some issue which would put the United States on our side?</p>

  <p>These cruisers are to cost five million pounds&mdash;or more if, failing
  the Capital Levy, Britain is forced to inflation&mdash;and they are to give
  employment to some few thousands of men. Meanwhile I gather that the
  educational clauses of that magniflcent Labour programme which was to have
  kept the next generation at school (and off the crowded labour market) until
  it reached the age of sixteen are to be crippled&mdash;a la Fisher&mdash;for
  want of funds.</p>

  <p>The more Parliament changes, I perceive, the more it is the same thing. It
  is organised for politicians by politicians; it is elected so stupidly that
  the statesman wilts into the politician so soon as he breathes its air. He
  ceases to see beyond the division lobby and the dockyard vote. If laying down
  cruisers is the chief business of government and the chief end of taxation, I
  would rather, on the whole, see Mr. Amery spending my money than Mr.
  Ammon.</p>

  <h2><a id="art28"
     name="art28">DICTATORS OR POLITICIANS?<br>
  THE DILEMMA OF CIVILISATION</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">22.3.1924</p>

  <p class="first">The drift towards dictatorships in many of the European
  countries has been very marked in the last few years. The mental distress and
  physical discomforts arising out of the steady process of financial, social,
  and economic decay in the tangle of nationalist States in Europe, have
  liberated a lively and widespread discontent with the methods of
  representative government. The legal way and the parliamentary way has seemed
  too long, tedious, and disingenuous for the urgent needs of the times. In
  Italy and Spain, in Hungary and Germany, we have had the complete
  dictatorship; the shadow of a dictatorship has fallen upon the French
  outlook. There has been an outbreak of bosses, strong men, tyrants after the
  Greek pattern, statesmen with special powers, suspensions of the constitution
  and so forth, across the entire European stage.</p>

  <p>To a certain small extent this may be due to a rebellion of ordinary
  common-sense people against the absurdity of committees doing one-man jobs.
  In America the disposition to give great powers to mayors and prominent
  public servants&mdash;a disposition which Mr. Belloc calls, absurdly enough,
  a disposition to "monarchy," and makes out to be a fundamental difference
  between Americans and Europeans&mdash;is probably due mainly to the
  perception of the need for a single head and a free hand in many complicated
  jobs. But the job is defined, and the term of power is defined. That
  concentration of ad hoc powers in a single competent responsible person is of
  course a legitimate and most hopeful development of democratic method. It is
  no more "monarchy" than the power of a judge is monarchy. But the drift in
  Europe, in Germany, and the Latin countries generally is to a general and not
  to a specific free hand. The man is there not to do this or that specified
  thing but to take the whole power of the State out of the hands of the
  politicians. Russia is a special case; the dictator there is the ghost of
  Karl Marx acting through the Communist Party. But Russia is as far from
  parliamentary democracy as any country in the world. Parliamentary democracy
  did for a brief interval appear in Russia, but it was as suitable wear for
  that country at its present phase of education as a silk hat for a whale.</p>

  <p>Why have all these dictatorships sprung up? Why has there been this
  decline of faith throughout the world in the Anglo-Saxon device of
  parliamentary government? Every intelligent person must know that this is a
  world of men and not supermen, and every lapse to a dictatorship implies a
  belief in a superman. Every year of a dictatorship diminishes the autonomous
  vitality of a community, no dictatorship is proof against the degeneration of
  the dictator through impunity and presumption, and no dictator has ever
  provided an eJ05cient successor. Yet we find the peoples of important
  European countries acquiescing in Mussolinis, Riveras, and the like, and
  powerful minorities in almost every European State asking for similar
  dictatorships. It is not that they are blind to the defects of dictatorships,
  but that they dislike parliamentary government more. A dictator may carry on
  a Government roughly and dangerously, but in many cases Parliaments have
  failed to carry on government at all.</p>

  <p>English-speaking peoples are beginning to realise that what they call
  "democracy" may not be a universal panacea, and that Parliamentary and
  Congressional government as it flourished in the nineteenth century with two
  parties and a choice for the elector limited to two party hacks, instead of
  being a method of universal validity and altogether perfect, was a
  temporarily convenient method of government for a fairly homogeneous dominant
  middle class living under apparently stable conditions. Social developments
  in Western Europe evolved this class throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth
  centuries, and a national mentality was evolved concurrently. Transferred to
  alien soils, parliamentary institutions wilt or become weedy. And it is
  extremely doubtful whether in Britain, that mother of Parliaments, it is
  possible for the parliamentary machine to work now except in a very hectic
  and unsatisfactory way, unless it undergoes extensive adaptations to meet the
  great financial, economic, and social stresses that have still to try the
  British community. In a previous paper I have discussed the electoral reforms
  whereby Parliament or Congress could be made really representative of the
  national mind, would cease to be an arena for a stupid and boring party
  conflict, and would become a smaller assembly, a working council, alive
  throughout, appointing and criticising the various Ministries. But a reform
  of representative methods is not in itself a sufficient solution to our
  problem. A graver and profounder weakness both of the American and British
  community at the present time is the incoherence and diffuseness of public
  opinion. Great changes in the range and material of economic life during the
  last quarter of a century and the financial earthquakes that have followed
  the war have shattered the old homogeneous and dominant middle-class stratum
  on both sides of the Atlantic. That was the reservoir of public opinion, and
  there is nothing equivalent on the new scale to replace it. There have been
  bold extensions of the franchise in Britain to great classes of inexperienced
  and inattentive voters; Mr. Adamson's Bill has brought us within sight of
  universal suffrage for every man and woman over twenty-one; but there has
  been no development of political education upon the same scale. Probably a
  third of the British voting mass after these additions&mdash;seven millions,
  say&mdash;will be too indifferent to political issues to vote at all. A half,
  another ten or eleven millions, will vote for trivial or silly reasons, and
  will certainly never take the slightest trouble to sustain the Parliament it
  has elected. Politically they will accept anything they get. They have still
  to learn to consider politics seriously. There remains about a sixth of the
  British electorate; less than five millions, a miscellany of every sort of
  opinion and drawn from every class, with this much in common, that it cares
  enough about politics to fight about them if necessary. But it is not this
  sixth but the half that the vote-hunting politician need consider. And it is
  not the half but some sections of the sixth which may presently resort to
  illegal methods to achieve its ends.</p>

  <p>Are we so remote and secure from the violent phase in Britain as people
  are apt to suppose? Can Britain go on indefinitely with a crazy electoral
  method that leaves masses of people thwarted and masses indifferent, and that
  leaves the mandate of any Government ambiguous? The present Government picks
  its precarious way amidst issues of the most inflammatory sort. The financial
  difficulty is not tackled; the Capital Levy is shelved for the time, and we
  do not know whether the method of taxing and more or less expropriating large
  bulks of property only, or the method of taxing every creditor, great or
  small, down to the penny of credit in the beggar woman's hand, is to be
  followed. One or other it must be. The first course will evoke the prompt
  resistance of the Fascist element in the Tory Party. Since the great days of
  the gun-running by Carson and F.E. in Ulster and the Curragh Pronunciamento,
  the Tories have been infected with dreams of reactionary illegalities. Army
  people and so forth are drenched with such stuff. They lost Ireland by it,
  but they are quite capable of setting about to lose England by the same
  methods. But though the Tory elements in British life might easily attempt
  forcible resistance to parliamentary socialisation, they are far too
  unintelligent to face the alternative of inflation, which will certainly
  produce just such conditions as will promote a drift towards revolution from
  the Communist end.... Violence from either side means ultimately dictatorship
  and the opening phase of a process of disorder and collapse for the entire
  British system. Between the horns of this dilemma the existing British system
  has still a few years left in which to modernise, enlarge, and clean its
  parliamentary methods and to educate its masses to political efficiency.</p>

  <h2><a id="art29"
     name="art29">YOUTH AND THE VOTE:<br>
  THE REJUVENESCENCE OF THE WORLD</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">29.3.1924</p>

  <p class="first">The recent discussion of the extension of the British
  parliamentary suffrage has been an amusing and instructive display. The finer
  parts of the debate upon Mr. Adamson's Bill were a little overshadowed in the
  Press by the Duchess of Atholl's possibly exaggerated objection to the
  proposed enfranchisement of several hundred travelling tinkers, and her
  nightmare of all the women in the country voting down all the men in the
  country upon some unexpected issue. I must confess that I am not very much
  interested by the question whether there are to be slight traces of tinker in
  the next election or not, and the end of the world by collision with some
  other planet seems a far less remote possibility to me than the lining up of
  the two separate sexes in flat opposition to each other. But what did
  interest me was to note that everyone seemed to have caught up his or her
  opinion just anyhow, and worn it much as people wear false noses at a
  carnival, and that in the whole ridiculous fray there was no apparent
  perception of any general reason why some people should vote and not others.
  I could not find any evidence that a single member had asked himself why
  people had to vote at all, whether it was a privilege or a duty to vote, and
  what were the proper qualifications or just claims of a voter.</p>

  <p>Mostly, I don't think they had ever asked themselves any such questions.
  Members of Parliament don't think about questions of that kind. They seem to
  think very little about anything of importance in the world, so much of their
  time is spent in division lobbies and loafing and gossiping about the House
  of Commons; but what attention they do give to franchise and electoral method
  is usually given in close consultation with a parliamentary agent, who is far
  from the spirit of scientific truth.</p>

  <p>Let us try and put the question on rather broader foundations than the
  House succeeded in doing. And, to begin with, let us consider whether the age
  of twenty-one is a sensible age at which to graduate a citizen as voter. Sir
  Sydney Russell-Wells and Sir Martin Conway, two University members, very
  properly declared it was not. With that we can well agree. Twenty-one marks
  no natural epoch in the mental and moral life of either man or woman. It is
  too old for adolescence and too young for any other phase. Twenty-one is a
  magic compound of seven and three, but nowadays we do not believe very much
  in the magic of numbers. The reasons why twenty-one was made the
  "coming-of-age" are lost in the mists of antiquity. But why these two
  gentlemen should propose therefore to make five-and-twenty the minimum age
  for a voter of either sex is not very clear. Sir Martin Conway, indeed,
  warmed up to a luscious eloquence about "woman's great flowering time." The
  young woman between twenty-one and twenty-five "should have her eye upon the
  glory of life," and so forth. Even if this were so, it is a little hard to
  understand the application of the limit to men. Apparently the young man is
  to undergo a sort of political "couvade" during these rich years, and think
  sympathetically about babies. As a matter of fact, lots of women far over
  twenty-five have not yet reached these preoccupations; it would, indeed, be
  highly improper for most of these below that limit to engage their minds in
  this fashion, since the majority do not marry until close upon twenty-five,
  and many much later. The twenty-fifth birthday is, indeed, no more a natural
  epoch for woman or man than the twenty-first, and Sir Martin Conway's
  argument was just a sample of the careless nonsense people talk on these
  important questions.</p>

  <p>But if neither twenty-five nor twenty-one is a real natural division line
  between the human being capable of citizenship and the junior, the natural
  minor, where shall we draw that line? I would suggest that we draw it at the
  age when the individual's education comes to an end. Education, we are
  assured, is to prepare the individual for citizenship. When a State turns its
  young people out of its schools into the streets to seek employment and toil
  for the community, it tacitly declares that their preparation for citizenship
  is at an end. If they are not prepared for citizenship they should not be
  turned out. If they are, then they ought to go on at once to the most
  stimulating exercise of the rights of citizenship, and vote before they
  forget their lessons in history and geography and economics and so forth. Why
  should they have to wait for years, forgetting nearly every general idea they
  have learnt before the vote comes to rouse them? But the reader will object
  that this means giving the vote to children of fourteen or indeed in some
  American States to children even younger. I submit that is no disproof of the
  principle I have laid down, but only a disqualification of the shocking
  inefficiency of the educational systems of the English-speaking world. We
  have no right to cheat our young people out of their votes because we are
  defrauding them of the best part of their education.</p>

  <p>I am one of those people who believe that the minimum age at which
  whole-time general education should cease is sixteen, and that for at least
  two years more education in some form, a technical or industrial training at
  least, associated perhaps with productive employment, and a continuation of
  the general intellectual work should be given. That would make eighteen the
  boundary between tutelage and complete responsible citizenship. And to that
  age I am willing and anxious to see the franchise extended. Education and the
  franchise are correlated questions, and I do not believe a community can be
  in a sound state of political organisation until education has moved up and
  the vote moved down the scale of age to this meeting-point.</p>

  <p>Let us consider first the justice of this. Think what we thrust upon the
  youth of eighteen in our communities. We voters, a good third of us above
  military age, will treat him as citizen enough to undergo the utmost fatigues
  and horrors of war, and to be maimed and to die for us, and the girl of
  fourteen (is it?) may marry, and the girl of sixteen may commit herself to
  dishonour, and either man or girl may toil in factory or foundry. All that we
  put upon them. We force them by need and circumstance to forgo the better
  part of their education, to subdue all the wide and wonderful imaginations of
  these opening years, and we oblige them to contribute to the wealth of the
  State in unattractive work. But they may have no voice in matters in general
  until they are thoroughly broken in. I can see a sort of expediency in
  disenfranchising unsuccessful people after forty or so, they are dull and
  cowed by that time and will bring little to the polls but their fears and
  inferiorities. But why gag the young for three of their most vivid years?</p>

  <p>And next there is to be considered the benefit to the individual citizen
  of stepping straight from learning to responsibility. He will be brought into
  conscious and effective relationship with political and industrial
  institutions at the same time; he will face them as two aspects of one thing
  just when the spirit of inquiry is strongest in him. And such of the younger
  women who are waking up to what Sir Martin Conway calls the "glory of life"
  will realise that childbearing is a thing of issues wider than the fireside;
  they will be called upon to think of war and education and the whole future
  in the very time when the continuity of life is brought most effectively
  before their minds. What sort of a world, what sort of political process can
  Sir Martin be thinking about when he suggests that a vision of the glory of
  life ought to disqualify a voter?</p>

  <p>And finally let us consider the benefit to the country and the world at
  large of a more youthful electorate. To bring in voters in their nineteenth,
  twentieth, and twenty-first years will be to bring in three million and more
  fresh minds, all unsettled as yet, all facing the world adventurously. They
  will be a wholesome counterweight to the grudging ratepayer, the small
  shopkeeper, the rentier, the anxious and hopeless and fearful multitude of
  the unsuccessful and defensive middle-aged, the great supporters of
  "Anti-Waste" campaigns, "safety" armaments, policies of "security," and all
  sorts of patriotic cowardice. These elder folk think of the next quarter day
  or the next year; it is all that interests them; they will be dead soon and
  they want to shuffle along as comfortably and with as little troublesome
  novelty as possible until then. The interests of the youth of eighteen reach
  forward half a century and they may work with a reasonable hope of a better
  world for themselves as well as their children. They may have the more wisdom
  for the very reason that they have acquired less worldly discretion. And for
  all of us who believe that education is already touched by a new spirit and
  that it is surely being made better, the younger the age of enfranchisement
  the greater our hopes of an early effect of the new education upon the
  affairs of mankind.</p>

  <p>"Universal education up to eighteen, universal enfranchisement at
  eighteen"; along that line lies our path to a real civilisation. Along that
  path we shall go as the breath of a new generation blows into Congress and
  Parliament and these assemblies cease to be the gatherings of political
  botchers and tinkers representing the broken spirit and curtailed desires of
  a forty-year-old electorate. For round about forty must be the average age of
  the present-day British elector.</p>

  <h2><a id="art30"
     name="art30">OLIVE BRANCHES OF STEEL:<br>
  SHOULD THE ANGELS OF PEACE CARRY BOMBS?</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">5.4.1924</p>

  <p class="first">The will for peace is futile without the courage to disarm.
  I would like to have that proposition printed in large letters and put up at
  all the meetings of the British League of Nations Union, just to see what the
  worthy practitioners in easy optimism who fill these gatherings would make of
  it. I doubt if half the kindly idealists who support the League of Nations in
  Britain and America are prepared for any effectual disarmament of their own
  countries. For others&mdash;yes; but not for their own dear land.</p>

  <p>Since the refusal of France even to discuss land disarmament or the
  question of submarines at Washington I have kept up a pretty steady fire of
  disagreeable allusions to France. I have sung and sung again, with variations
  and amplifications, my little refrain about Senegalese and Submarines
  in&mdash;quite a number of journals. But France has her excuses, the next
  election may release her from the Bloc National and the Armament firms to the
  free exercise of international virtue, and after all virtue should begin at
  home. Are not both the United States and the British Empire, considered in
  the role of peace-seeking States, overarmed? The general will of all the
  English-speaking communities is, we all know and say and repeat, for an
  enduring world peace. But even a savage understands that he must drop and
  leave his weapons and hold up innocent hands before he can get to honest
  peace talk.</p>

  <p>Consider a crude form of the issue. Suppose the United States and the
  British Empire got together and disarmed completely, suppose they retained
  the merest police force and placed all the rest of their joint navies at the
  disposal of an international council, on which they would have an adequate
  representation of course, what would happen? There would be an immediate
  reduction of public expenditure and so much relief of economic life from
  taxation. Would anything else happen? Would Japan suddenly fling herself upon
  California, Italy seize Malta and Egypt, the Red Army pour down into India,
  or France destroy London? Does anyone&mdash;unless it be my dear old friends
  Mr. Henry Arthur Jones and Mr. Leo Maxse&mdash;believe any of these things
  would happen? Or anything of the sort?</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact we have France now, at the present time, so much more
  powerfully equipped in the air than Britain and with the British
  anti-aircraft establishment so reduced, that she could, if she wished to do
  so and dared to do so, smash up London and put most of the English naval and
  commercial ports out of action before any really effective counterstroke
  could be made. There has been a powerful Press campaign in France against
  Britain, and there is plenty of hostile feeling there. Led by a propagandist
  Press a great multitude of Frenchmen really believe that the favourite
  occupation of the English-speaking peoples is buying francs at one price in
  order to sell them at a lower one. Nevertheless, that attack doesn't come and
  it never will come. The temporary satisfaction would be so poor that it would
  not balance the disagreeable anticipation of an ultimate revenge. Moreover,
  the immediate financial and economic collapse both of France and Britain
  would manifestly ensue. Air warfare and poison gas have so enhanced the
  destructiveness of war and made it so inconclusive, and France and Britain
  are so close together now and so accessible one to the other, that they have
  to face the fact&mdash;an annoying fact for every true patriot&mdash;that
  they can no longer regard war as a means of settling even their worst
  differences. As well think of settling a dispute between two next-door
  neighbours by burning both their houses and massacring all the inmates. It
  really does not matter now which of the two Powers is the stronger on land or
  sea. It is a consideration of no practical value whatever between them.</p>

  <p>And just as an attack of France upon Britain is unthinkable at the present
  time, although all the military advantage lies at present with France, so,
  too, any attack upon the vast joint territories of the United States and the
  British Empire, though they neither of them had a battleship in commission
  nor a ton of explosive ready, would be an absurd proposition. There is no
  other Power on earth that could do it to any profit at all, and without the
  ultimate certainty of a crushing rearmament and revenge. It would be like a
  tiger-cat trying to kill and eat an elephant. In all the world now there are
  only four countries capable of starting-in at complete first-class modern
  warfare: Britain, France, Japan, and the United States. Italy has neither the
  coal nor the ore necessary for so heavy an enterprise; the hairiest, loudest
  Fascisti in the world will not make up for that; and Russia has not the
  industrial plant for the necessary munitions of aggression. She has vast
  resisting power, as ever, but no attacking power. All the other countries of
  the world, if they fight nowadays, must fight with the munitions and loans
  the four possible belligerents grant them. These four countries therefore, of
  themselves, could inaugurate a world peace; and the interests of their
  peoples, as distinguished from the armament interests, urgently demand a
  secure world peace. The difficulty is to begin. The Press of each of the
  armament-capable four is closely interwoven with the armament profiteers, and
  the Press of either country will begin a campaign of panic about what the
  other three are doing directly there is any serious possibility of relaxed
  armament anywhere. Since the United States and Britain are easily first in
  preaching peace and arbitration to the world, I suggest that it is for them
  to set the example and begin. But at the first intimations of a serious
  abandonment of "preparedness" Lord Rothermere and his American
  equivalents&mdash;if there are equivalents of Lord Rothermere in
  America&mdash;will see to it that the nervous householder dreams of
  aeroplanes coming down the chimney and submarines coming up the sink, and
  wakes gibbering of "security" like a <i>Matin</i>-soaked French patriot.</p>

  <p>And most of the tremendous outfit we English-speaking peoples carry isn't
  even good for war. It is like a battle-axe in a tramcar, a terrifying
  offensive affair, but not really effective in a fight at close quarters. The
  time when war was a generalised thing is past. You can no longer have an army
  or navy that goes anywhere and does everything. For Britain to fight France,
  or Japan, or the United States, or Russia, or Italy, demands in each case a
  different sort of warfare, with different methods and different appliances.
  British battleships camouflaged as cruisers and docks for them half-way round
  the earth would be no good against Russia or Italy, and very little use
  against France. Against Japan they would be good for her submarines to chase
  and blockade while our submarines chased and blockaded the Japanese warships.
  A big air force, again, would be little use against the United States or
  Japan, Considered in relation to any possible specific war they may have to
  wage, the present war establishments of the great belligerent Powers, the
  miscellaneous elaborate material that the armament people and their
  unimaginative army traditions have induced them to buy are as likely to be
  efficient as the equipment of the White Knight in Alice in Wonderland. The
  methods and objectives and so forth of any next war that may surprise the
  politicians (just as children are surprised by fires when they play with
  matches), conducted by the sort of soldiers we possess and with the stuff
  they will handle as ''equipment," will certainly be more discursive and silly
  and ineffective even than those great pushes and counter-attacks and raids
  and bombings and so forth of the last great war, and in their inconclusive
  way infinitely more destructive.</p>

  <p>But if these preposterous armaments are unlikely to be conclusive in
  warfare, they do at any rate block the way very effectively to any
  reorganisation of the world for peace. You can't make love in armour. All
  this lumpish preparedness keeps the atmosphere of human life unwholesome; it
  prevents the settlement by any frank concerted action of the tariff
  conflicts, financial squabbles, currency annoyance, and mutual economic
  injuries that are rapidly destroying the present social system. Every big
  nation comes into such discussions an implicit bully. The nations have to
  learn the same lessons that individuals learnt in the middle ages, they have
  to learn not to bear arms even in the company of those who do. In the middle
  ages, when the loving-cup went round, one's neighbour stood as one drank to
  protect one's back from the assassin's knife. At last some reckless souls
  took heart to sit and drink and trust their fellow men. Other desperate
  spirits left their weapons at home&mdash;and survived. But the nations are
  still half-way back to barbarism. Our cartoonists draw Uncle Sam and John
  Bull as decent peaceable everyday citizens. They flatter our countries.
  Really the Great Powers should be drawn as completely canned warriors with
  their wary eyes and noses just peeping out of their preparedness. And this in
  spite of the fact that the only serious danger to either is that the weight
  and clumsiness of this silly equipment and of the worldwide distrust it
  produces will undermine his business and his national health altogether.</p>

  <h2><a id="art31"
     name="art31">THE CASE OF UNAMUNO:<br>
  THE FEEBLE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">12.4.1924</p>

  <p class="first">There is nothing greater in the world of men than thought.
  Science, literature, and art; what other glories has man? And yet the company
  of men of science and letters and art forms but the feeblest of republic
  throughout the world, is insignificant socially and politically, and wins
  only posthumous respect.</p>

  <p>A time may come when men will have a better sense of the values of things,
  and when the creative experimenter and writer and artist will be accorded
  something of the respect and something of the immunity we now give to
  royalties with the urbanity of second-rate waiters or the pluck of
  second-rate jockeys, and to those casual possessors of disproportionate
  spending power or disproportionate impudence, our social leaders. But that
  day when the philosopher, or the discoverer, or the great artist will be
  King, when there will be no recognised nobility but the nobility of the mind,
  is still far away. Perhaps it will never come. Perhaps there is a permanent
  necessity in our natures, requiring us to exalt the common qualities we share
  and understand and to contemn rare gifts. King Carnival, with his vast nose
  and goggling eyes, is the most real, most natural of all human kings, because
  he is frankly grotesque, a common creature raised up and magnified. Such
  kings and princes, such popular heroes and fashionable leaders as we have,
  assist us in our self-protective struggle against the insupportable suspicion
  that we lack distinctive quality. We can tell ourselves that they are in no
  way different from us except that they are luckier. But it tortures our
  self-esteem to honour those who have qualities we cannot pretend to possess.
  That is why we love to think of the man of science as a foolish,
  absent-minded thing with spectacles and a butterfly-net, and listen so
  greedily to rumours of vice and wickedness in men of genius. There may be a
  profound instinctive reasonableness in this acceptance of the gift and this
  rejection of the giver. Ingratitude is better for the common man than
  servility. If we did not distrust and restrain the exceptional people in the
  world, they might run away from us or run away with us, until we became no
  more than animals under direction and control. A king is the surest
  protection against regal personalities and an aristocracy against any rule of
  the best.</p>

  <p>The exceptional men&mdash;because they are exceptional men&mdash;have no
  flock instinct to hold them together for mutual protection against the crowd
  and its leaders. Nearly all men of distinctive gifts are jealous. They are
  driven by an inner necessity to assert their own special quality against the
  aggressive special qualities of their fellows. There is little generosity
  when men of science or literary and artistic men talk of one another. Their
  mission is to do the thing they have to do and not be good fellows with one
  another. When one considers this, one may be reconciled to much egoism and
  lack of gregariousness in the man of intellectual gifts and yet at times one
  may be startled by some reminder of the extreme moral disintegration which is
  the normal state of the ''republics" of science and art and letters. I recall
  my own amazement at the sudden outbreak of nationalism on the part of the men
  of science of all countries at the beginning of the war, and still more so at
  the reluctance with which they came together after the armistice, when they
  had had four years to think it over. When I went to the secretary of the
  Royal Society in 1920 and told him of the poverty of such great men as Pavlov
  in Petersburg and of the urgent need of the Russian men of science for
  Western publications and for instruments and material kept out by our
  blockade, I thought the society would take up the matter forthwith as a
  simple obvious duty. It did nothing of the sort. It was argued that Pavlov
  and the others ought to have come out of Russia as white refugees, and that a
  body adorned with all the dukes and royal princes of Great Britain had other
  things to consider than mere protection of research in the world. The Royal
  Society was indeed, I found, not so much a society for the promotion and
  exaltation of science, as a society of scientific men for mutual
  restraint.</p>

  <p>And now in the scandalous case of Don Miguel Unamuno comes a fresh
  instance of the lack of any feeling of solidarity among the world's
  intellectuals. Here is a great writer and professor, the ex-Rector of the
  University of Salamanca, a man of undisputed pre-eminence. He is a professor
  of classical learning: not one of the scientific or sociological fellows. He
  utters some lucid and deserved reproofs to the King of Spain. As all the
  world knows, the King of Spain has consented to, and possibly connived at,
  the illegal usurpation of his Government by a military junta with a dictator
  of straw, a sham Mussolini, Primo de Rivera. It is a dull, bad Government,
  chiefly concerned with the suppression of opinion and the entirely
  incompetent maintenance of an endless war with the Moors. For if Spanish
  generals have at times to display the backs of their brilliant uniforms to
  the Moors, they can at least keep a brave overbearing front towards Spain. No
  country was ever in such need of drastic public criticism as Spain at the
  present time. But so soon as Don Unamuno speaks plainly, he is seized and
  sent without trial to the Canary Islands, away from his books, his students,
  and all contact with the current activities of mankind. It is a purely
  arbitrary act. There is not even an appeal to some pseudo-academic court. It
  is done on the authority of the dull imitation who is failing to be the
  Spanish Mussolini. An oaf in uniform has struck a great teacher on the mouth
  and silenced him. In recent times in Europe there has never been so plain and
  violent a challenge to the freedom and honour of the intellectual world.</p>

  <p>What protest has there been from that world? One might have expected
  vigorous outcries on behalf of Salamanca from Oxford and Cambridge, from
  London and the British Academy, from Harvard and Yale and Chicago, and the
  hundred and one universities and colleges of North and South America, an
  immense outbreak of indignation. I have heard of scarcely any. From the
  University of Paris there has been a fairly representative protest, and
  Lisbon has spoken. I have seen a few paragraphs in the highbrow weeklies of
  Britain and America. But the intellectual workers of our English-speaking
  world seem as a whole to have been as little affected by this particular
  exploit of the King of Spain's Dictator as a flock of grazing sheep by the
  death of one of its number. So far as they are concerned he may shut up all
  the Universities of Spain and maroon their entire staffs. Their sense of any
  community of interests among the Universities of the world seems to be almost
  completely lacking. The ordinary miner or transport worker has much to teach
  the university professor in the matter of occupational self-respect.</p>

  <p>Of course, both in England and America in the last dozen years or so there
  have been rather similar cases to this crowning outrage of vulgar force upon
  mind. There was the case of Mr. Bertrand Russell, for example, during the
  war, and in America it is inadvisable for professors of economics and social
  science to lean too visibly towards collectivism. And Mr. William Jennings
  Bryan knows all about creation and incites backward States to dismiss
  teachers of biology who teach contrary to the beliefs of this favoured
  confidant of the Deity. Perhaps an uneasy consciousness of such facts has
  hampered the English-speaking communities in this affair. Meanwhile Don
  Miguel Unamuno studies the seascapes of the Canary Islands, and, so far as
  his opinion of King Alfonso goes, he is restricted to conversation with the
  islanders.</p>

  <p>And if by any chance King Alfonso should visit England and go to Oxford or
  Cambridge, all the dons and deans and heads would put on their fullest
  plumage to bow and scrape to him.</p>

  You are eighty years old, and yet it seemed to me a little time ago, when I

  and deserving, to tell you of your place in the hearts and minds of the
  English-speaking world. All of us who can do so read you in your inimitable
  French, but it may not be amiss to say a word or two of the readers you have
  outside the community of French readers, outside that great cosmopolitan
  France of the mind. You have been, I think, almost completely translated into
  English, and in England and America there are scores of thousands who know
  you only in your English guise. All translations are made at a loss, but most
  of your translators have served you honestly and some have served you well,
  and you are so rich that you can pay the high tariff between our languages
  and still carry over enough to entrance and win fine minds. All the cultured
  and successful people of the world know you by necessity, and send homage to
  you. But I think I understand you well enough to be assured that even more
  than such salutations you will value the fact that there are miner lads in
  Scotland, railway workers in England, London clerks, and provincial shopmen,
  who know no more than a few hundred words of French, and yet whose faces
  flush and brighten at your name, workers struggling against a thousand
  disadvantages to possess their souls, to whom you have brought the priceless
  gifts of happiness and release and inspiration. I wish I could steal and send
  you a well-thumbed copy of an English translation of <i>Thaïs</i> or <i>L'Île
  des Pingouins</i> from the shelves of some English public library in evidence
  of this outer empire of your mind.</p>

  <p>As spokesman for your English-speaking readers, it is natural for me to
  dwell upon the ease with which you wear an English costume. In many respects
  you are intensely French: French after the manner of the greatness of France,
  the France of liberty, equality, and world fraternity. But you transcend all
  narrow and nationalist limitations. In the past, before the great wars of the
  Napoleonic period, the English and French had not that sense of difference,
  that disposition to antagonistic contrasts, too frequently evident to-day.
  Intellectually our communities were more closely interwoven. Men remembered
  then how the Normans linked us; how Burgundian and Englishman were sturdy
  allies; how Briton and Breton had a common past, and how close were Frank and
  Fleming to the Anglo-Saxon stock. We Normans and Saxons and Franks and
  Flemings and Scots and Burgundians and Gascons and Angevins built our Gothic
  cathedrals in brotherly competition, and our knights and bowmen and princes
  and bishops bickered and went to and fro. Our literatures sprang from common
  roots and intertwined, and were continually grafted and re-grafted one upon
  the other. No Englishman finds anything essentially foreign in Rabelais and
  Montaigne; they are in the same company as Swift and Sterne, as to-day
  Voltaire almost lives again in Shaw. Such contemporary English writers as
  Belloc and Chesterton would be seen plainly for Frenchmen if they wrote in
  French. And we do not find in you anything foreign to our spirit and our
  humour. Our response to you is a kindred response. You probably have far more
  imitators in Britain and America than you have in all the Latin countries of
  the world. Some of the most promising of the newer American writers are
  clearly indebted to you. There are many of us writers of English&mdash;and
  some of these not the least among us&mdash;to whom it would be the sweetest
  praise to be likened to Anatole France. In the end it may be found that you
  have exerted an influence upon our English literature even greater than that
  influence upon your own. We are not intruders, therefore, not foreign
  admirers and outsiders, at these birthday celebrations. We English writers
  are here of right, and because we are akin to you and within the realm of
  your thought and power.</p>

  <h2><a id="art33"
     name="art33">THE EUROPEAN KALEIDOSCOPE:<br>
  THE GERMAN WILL IN DEFAULT</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">23.4.1924</p>

  <p class="first">I WAS in Paris the other day when M. Poincaré reconstructed
  his Government, and I heard him make his declaration of policy to the Chamber
  of Deputies. I had never seen him before. It was a dramatic and amusing
  occasion, and I conceived for M. Poincaré the same sort of warm and hostile
  affection that I have for Mr. Winston Churchill and Mr. Lloyd George. He is
  an entirely delightful personality; he has all the charm&mdash;and much of
  the appearance&mdash;of a wiry-haired terrier. He even barks.</p>

  <p>The Chamber of Deputies is in a semi-circle like a Roman theatre; there is
  none of the waste and confusion of effect one gets in the Gothic oblong at
  Westminster. The public was present by ticket; it sat in a semi-circle of
  little boxes within nodding distance of the deputies&mdash;and mostly it was
  ladies and very well dressed. High up over it all and facing it all sat M.
  François Arago, like a finite and protesting deity, with his recording angels
  behind him and a large bell convenient for his hand. Beneath him was the
  rostrum from which one addresses the house, and then a lower rank of
  reporters. But there was no beam of limelight. The political world has still
  to discover limelight. It is extraordinary how slow all legislative
  assemblies are in adopting modern conveniences. A beam of limelight would be
  excellent at Westminster to indicate the direction of the Speaker's eye.</p>

  <p>M. Poincaré read out his intentions in a hard, very audible voice. His
  opening sentences went to much applause and interruption. The chief scene
  came when, enumerating the ways in which France proposed to restore and
  preserve her solvency, he referred to an intensive exploitation of her
  colonies. "Our colonial policy," said he. "Sarraut!" cried the Left&mdash;a
  fine, wolf-like sound. "Our colonial policy!" said M. Poincaré with
  increasing firmness. "Sar-raut!" "Our colonial policy," M. Poincaré repeated,
  in small capitals, so to speak. "Sarraut!" much louder&mdash;the Left
  enjoying itself. M. Poincaré brought up unexpected vocal resources. After
  five&mdash;or was it six?&mdash;repetitions, honour was satisfied and the
  statement went on.</p>

  <p>In the horrible language of English political discussion, M. Poincaré is
  attempting to "dish" the Left. He was trying to make his policy look as
  "Left" as possible, while still remaining the same inflexible person as ever.
  He had thrown over various associates from the Right and brought in
  reasonable men from the Left Centre to liberalise the effect of his
  reconstituted Government. He was prepared to be generous to Germany provided
  she paid the uttermost farthing. He was prepared to seem to come out of the
  Ruhr, while in reality sticking there. He spoke hopefully and brightly and
  emptily of the League of Nations.</p>

  <p>That is the quality of the new phase. M. Poincaré is talking as liberally
  as he can. He exchanges compliments and large liberal gestures with Mr.
  Ramsay MacDonald; neither of them meaning anything whatever, except a desire
  to pass the time and be in the fashion. It is the change in the fashion that
  should interest the student of affairs. M. Poincaré is getting ready for the
  elections in May, and his proceedings betray his consciousness of the deep
  strong movement of French thought and intention leftward, away from adventure
  and nationalism and militarism, towards&mdash;sanity. In spite of a
  systematically perverted news service and many provocations and natural
  fears, the mind of France is becoming powerfully reasonable. It thinks less
  and less of glory and more and more of solvency. It is more open to-day to
  ideas of reconciliation, disarmament, and organised international
  co-operation than it has been at any time since the war.</p>

  <p>M. Poincaré has been superficially dexterous, his majority is beautifully
  restored, but France and all the world know him for an honest obdurate man. I
  doubt if he will come back after the elections. M. Millerand has seemed to
  threaten a dictatorship if the Poincaré policy is defeated. Is France so
  Latin as to stand that? I think M. Millerand will be better advised to try a
  resignation. For the recent credit given to France to support the franc is
  probably the end of French borrowing power, and a defeat of the Left by fraud
  or violence&mdash;a cessation of the movement towards reason and
  disarmament&mdash;means a withdrawal of foreign confidence and a swift and
  sure financial collapse.</p>

  <p>Now unhappily it is just at this phase of French affairs, with the peace-
  intending reconciling forces of France and Britain coming rapidly into accord
  and ascendancy, that Germany begins to manifest her least agreeable traits.
  The recent Munich trials, the acquittal of that foolish old monarchist
  blusterer, Ludendorff, the ridiculous mitigated sentences of Hitler and the
  other conspirators against the German Republic, and, above all, the public
  demonstrations of sympathy with these second-rate nationalist reactionaries,
  come as a real shock to our hopes of an approaching European reconstruction.
  Like that supremely silly incident, the neglect to lower the German flag in
  Washington on the occasion of President Wilson's death, it is ugly; it
  betrays the bad heart. One may recognise the stream of injustices and
  disappointments that have been inflicted on Germany in the last five years,
  one may be willing to concede the right of Germans to a considerable
  resentment, and yet one may find it hard to forgive these sentimental
  dangerous reversions towards monarchism in uniform, and, above all, that
  petty and provocative folly at Washington.</p>

  <p>It has been a great disappointment and discouragement to those who have
  worked, and who are now drawing near to the accomplishment of their work, for
  a reconciled Europe, to note how feeble has been the collateral movement in
  Germany, Where is liberal and intelligent Germany to-day? It is begging its
  bread; but I do not see why it should concentrate all its energies upon
  begging its bread. When one goes into Germany one encounters plenty of
  residual swash-buckler spirit; the old heroism of the expanded chest and the
  high voice; and one encounters a vast amount of abject sob-stuff; but it is
  very hard indeed to find any Germans who seem to be steadily busy upon the
  reconstruction of Europe upon broad modern lines. Germany seems to be divided
  anatomically between the right and left. The Monarchists have the backbone
  and no brains; the Liberals have the brain and no backbone. When a German
  displays will he does something stupid and violent, and when he displays
  intelligence he does nothing at all. In Berlin last summer everybody I sought
  out and questioned talked in terms of crisis. Germany was sinking. England
  must do something for Germany at once. America must do something for Germany
  at once. The one thing they would not recognise was the necessity of Germany
  doing something for Germany at once.</p>

  <p>And no party has arisen, no newspapers have arisen, no leader or group of
  men stands out yet to embody a new Germany in a new Europe. The time of
  opportunity draws near and Germany, one fears, may remain too sick and
  beaten, too witless and unteachable, to make any use of this year of opening
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>I write without any profound knowledge of things German. I may be too much
  impressed by the reactionary crowd in the streets of Munich. There may be
  deeper currents in German life which find no adequate expression in the
  German Press, and of which I know nothing. But with the French elections
  drawing near, it is time that the good Europeans in Germany, if there are
  good Europeans in Germany, should make themselves heard and felt. The
  impression I have of an unhelpful and uncreative and irresponsive Germany,
  cheated, it is true, and disappointed, but lapsing far too readily towards a
  sullen unhelpfulness, is a very general impression in France and Britain.
  France is under an urgent necessity of retrenchment and ready to abandon her
  futile aggressiveness; Britain was never less imperialist than she is to-day.
  Is there no German initiative to meet this new occasion?</p>

  <h2><a id="art34"
     name="art34">CHINA: THE LAND OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">26.4.1924</p>

  <p class="first">China has been out of the limelight of the newspapers
  lately. It is the tradition of the Atlantic civilisations to think about
  China as little as possible. We ignore the enormous importance of its gifts
  to us in the past, and we do our utmost to disregard its immediate share in
  the world's future.</p>

  <p>China drove the Huns westward to relieve Europe from the decaying
  stagnation of the western Roman Empire. She gave the world paper, which made
  the printed book and newspaper possible, which made general education and the
  publication of scientific work possible, which indeed laid the foundation of
  the modern world. She taught the Mongols and Turks the organisation and
  military methods that ended the dying Greek impulse of the eastern Roman
  Empire, nearly conquered Europe, and drove the reluctant European seamen to
  discover South Africa and America. She numbers to-day more than a fifth part
  of the human race; has four times as many civilised citizens as the United
  States, and nearly as many as all continental Europe put together. When we
  discuss the struggles of a world civilisation to exist it is well now and
  then to give China a thought.</p>

  <p>For China must be a pillar of that world civilisation equivalent to the
  whole English-speaking world. Two or three facts of some importance are not
  perhaps so actively present in the general consciousness as they might be.
  There is a Chinese Republic with a President in Pekin, who rules more or less
  in most of China proper, though Canton and several other provinces get along
  in a state of provisional independence. But besides the President there is
  also a young Emperor in Pekin with a large official income&mdash;in
  arrears&mdash;and a remarkable English tutor. The Emperor, we are told, is
  quite Anglicised, he is being taught constitutional history, and presently,
  if the British people do not wake up to the dangers of the position, there
  may be an attempt, open or furtive, with British assistance, to restore the
  Chinese monarchy. Moreover, although I understood at the Washington
  Conference that Wei-hai-wei was to be given up, the British are still
  there&mdash;waiting for something to turn up. The British never had much
  right to be in Wei-hai-wei; their excuse for being there collapsed with the
  collapse of Russian imperialism; and probably not one British voter in the
  hundred is prepared for the possibly expensive and humiliating consequences
  of keeping there too long. The abandonment of the Singapore dock enlargement
  implied a policy of general withdrawal from forcible adventures in Eastern
  Asia. But in the untidy way of the British, the shreds and patches of some
  old dream of a military and political predominance in China are left to brew
  misunderstandings and trouble in the future.</p>

  <p>It is not that Britain has not a profound interest in the future
  development of China. All the English-speaking peoples, all the other peoples
  in the world, have a great and increasing interest in Chinese affairs. As the
  world is drawn together into a political unity, the Chinaman becomes the most
  important neighbour of everyone. But the method of expressing an interest by
  grabbing and fortifying settlements, threatening coasts with warships,
  levying tribute and imposing iniquitous trade arrangements, is now manifestly
  old-fashioned and barbaric, and a new line of activities has to replace these
  outworn puerilities.</p>

  <p>The English-speaking communities have to work out, and do seem to be
  beginning to work out, a common conception of a world order, and of their
  common share in it. Regarded as a point of departure, as a new turn in
  international thought, the League of Nations movement marks an epoch in world
  history. That sort of thought is still most extensively carried by the
  English language; shallow and weak to-day, it may become deeper and more
  effective as time goes on. It is in the character of the English-speaking
  communities. It is manifestly of primary importance that so far as possible
  this thinking-out of the organised peace of the world by the English
  -speaking communities should go on parallel with, and in touch with, the
  similar thinking-out of the other great communities of the world. And with no
  other great community is it more possible and desirable to develop a joint
  system of ideas and a common political and social aim, than with the great
  Chinese mass. It is possible, because China is to an extraordinary extent
  renascent and blank and ready to consider and accept points of view and
  constructive conceptions. China is remaking her education from the
  foundation. The four hundred million mass of China is at present
  intellectually far more plastic than the forty million mass of France, and
  the thirty million mass of Italy, And it is desirable as well as possible,
  because a successful effort to bring modern Chinese and American and British
  thought about the world's affairs into co-operative understanding would add
  the weight of four hundred million to the five hundred million of the
  American and British systems.</p>

  <p>In America, China, and Britain alike there is a recognition&mdash;weak and
  partial though it is&mdash;of this great opportunity. The return of the Boxer
  indemnity, already partially repaid by America, and soon to be repaid by
  Britain, ear-marked for educational purposes, is an unprecedented and most
  significant thing in international relationships. Part of the American money
  has gone to educate Chinese students in English and so prepare them to become
  students in the American Universities. The rest is to be devoted to the
  development of a modern library in Pekin University. The British money is not
  yet apportioned, but Dr. Tsai, the Chancellor of the National University at
  Pekin, has recently been in London to urge the paramount need of a museum and
  a properly equipped system of scientific laboratories in China.</p>

  <p>I saw Dr. Tsai giving an address to the China Society in the London School
  of Oriental Studies upon these new developments of Chinese education. It was
  one of the most reassuring things I have witnessed for some time, that little
  gathering of Chinese students and of a few interested English friends, in the
  steep little lecture theatre in Finsbury Circus, to discuss the making-over
  of the Chinese mind that is now in progress. We are still in the day of
  comparatively small things; sums like ten million pounds are dwarfed by such
  figures as four hundred million people; yet they are not too small to be
  perceptible and significant. A growing number of Chinese are making
  themselves thoroughly well acquainted with all the West has to teach them;
  they are not simply learning and accepting, they are criticising. The
  perennial vigour and originality of the Chinese mind is manifested by a
  prompt repercussion to British and American ideas.</p>

  <p>I have before me as I write, for example, a memorandum on Chinese Politics
  and Professionalism, by Mr. S. C. Chang, which is one of the ablest
  criticisms of the Anglo-American panacea of "democracy" that I have ever
  read. It is one of remarkable and admirable things about China that in a time
  of great political confusion whole provinces, almost without government, go
  on in an orderly fashion and that arts flourish and reading and teaching
  spread. The nucleus of the mental organisation of a new China, in close touch
  and sympathy with the Atlantic peoples, appears. Before a generation has
  passed it may have gathered sufficient power to undertake the general
  education of the whole Chinese people. It already inspires a considerable
  Press.</p>

  <p>These new relationships of study and discussion between the
  English-speaking and Chinese worlds will, I hope, increase, intensify, and
  develop. At present it is a very extraordinary thing that, while the young
  Chinese students in Britain and America can be counted by hundreds, there is
  still no system of sending English and American students, by way of
  scholarships, to study Chinese life and literature in China.</p>

  <p>The Chinese are more conscious than the English-speaking peoples of
  deficient knowledge, and of the need of new inspiration. Our phase is,
  comparatively, a phase of self-satisfaction. The Chinese will know what we
  think, and know long before we have realised how much we have to learn from
  them, and what a wholesome thing it is for us to get their point of view. For
  Chinese schools multiply and teaching spreads, and where there are schools
  and teaching there the future grows.</p>

  <h2><a id="art35"
     name="art35">AIR ARMAMENT: THE SUPREMACY OF QUALITY</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">3.5.1924</p>

  <p class="first">Bankrupt France and out-of-work England are developing a
  sort of armament race in air equipment. It has not quite the vigour of the
  old naval armament race; it is not so expensive, and the chances for
  financial and industrial loot are less. But it goes on, and at present, on
  paper at least, France leads handsomely. On paper France is ascendant over
  Britain in the air, capable of inflicting vast injuries, while sustaining
  small reprisals, and the matter is one of great concern to many anxious
  souls. They have visions of London stark and stiff and twisted under poison
  gas and all the British ports and docks destroyed.</p>

  <p>The vagueness of our knowledge does on the whole enhance our terrors. But
  it is well to remember that our knowledge is vague. It is particularly vague
  about the things that aeroplanes can carry and drop. Chemists and science
  students generally find an innocent pleasure in inventing wonderful rays,
  explosives, and lethal gases for the benefit of the ingenuous newspaper man.
  They invent them rather than make them. In practice the normal limitations
  and insufficiencies of this earthly life apply with peculiar force to
  explosives and lethal gases. Only in the world of scientific romance can they
  be made out of nothing and instantaneously. In this sordid world of everyday
  they demand ingredients that are difficult and expensive to produce and
  limited in amount, and they require apparatus and skill and often
  considerable courage for their preparation. And in order to produce any
  serious effect on an enemy they must be delivered in huge consignments upon
  that enemy, and that requires a large number of aeroplanes of sufficient size
  to carry bulky material. Mr. Galsworthy was recently writing to the Times in
  grave alarm about the exposure of Britain to French air attack. He saw all
  her ports destroyed, no wharf for any food ship, England starved. I doubt if
  he had ever attempted to figure out how many tons of high
  explosive&mdash;allowing for the inevitable misses&mdash;would have to be
  conveyed from France to Southampton, for example, to smash up that one port
  alone to any decisive extent.</p>

  <p>Before the heavy transport aeroplane can be safely used its mechanics must
  be insured against attack from fighting aeroplanes in the hands of highly
  skilled men. And this brings us to the essential objection to any panic
  creation of air forces. In the air quality is of supreme importance, and
  quality is rare. Given equal machines a good man can almost always put down a
  mediocre man; a man of exceptional gifts can keep on putting down ordinary
  men. The star air fighters in the war were men who had accounted for scores
  of enemy machines. Given a few exceptional men and the best machines, an air
  force of a few score units is capable of accounting for hundreds of inferior
  squadrons. God, we are told, is on the side of the biggest battalions, but
  this arithmetical preference, if it continues at all at the present time, is
  certainly restricted only to land fighting. In the air God is now manifestly
  on the side of intelligence, quickness, and courage. For a mastery of the air
  over and around one's country there is needed therefore, before all other
  things, a War Office capable of finding and using first-class men, aviators,
  mechanics and inventors. Inventors and innovators most of all. After that, it
  must have money for the best material. But the money and the bulk of the
  product is a secondary matter. It is only after the air war is won that the
  big omnibuses full of bombs can come into play for more than incidental
  raids.</p>

  <p>Now it is doubtful if any War Office exists or can exist capable of
  carrying on a skilled air warfare. There is something subtly stupid and
  unscientific about this war business, and you will never find first-class
  imaginations giving themselves freely and continuously to war organisation.
  Great men like Cromwell or Mr. Trotsky may do miracles of war organisation
  under necessity, but it is only puerile types like Mr. Amery who can go on
  planning war in peace time. The soldier is, has been, and always will be a
  rather limited and usually a rather thickheaded person. It follows therefore
  that if ever there should be a real, fully-prepared-for war in the world
  again&mdash;a thing which, as the unrepentant author of the phrase "The War
  to End War," I am naturally disposed to doubt&mdash;then probably the air
  warfare which will dominate it will be a warfare conducted with machines far
  below the quality of the best contemporary knowledge, and by men below the
  highest attainable standard. It may be, therefore, a clumsy war, as
  needlessly destructive as the great war; and the lumbering big aeroplane,
  with its tons of explosive, in search for targets of military significance,
  will incidentally smash up all sorts of precious things. But the less clumsy
  air-warfare is the less it will do that. It is a paradoxical-looking but
  quite valid proposition that the less we develop special skill and invention
  in air-warfare the more prolonged and destructive air-warfare is likely to
  be. A brilliantly clever and trained and equipped air force might even be
  capable of purely defensive warfare. A clumsy, abundant air force, incapable
  of encountering and outflying its antagonists, could only work by the cruel
  and de-civilising method of reprisal raids.</p>

  <p>For these reasons I think it almost as regrettable that Mr. Ramsay
  MacDonald should talk so readily of a sort of Washington Conference for
  Europe upon air disarmament as that he should have consented to the
  replacement building of the five cruisers. Nothing will ever restrain nations
  at war from making a belligerent use of the air; and the alternative to a
  specialised scientifically developed air fighting force will be a
  mobilisation of civil transport air planes for offensive use. This will not
  be a diminution but an aggravation of the horrors of air attack so far as the
  ordinary civilised man on the ground is concerned.</p>

  <p>A number of people seem to consider civil air transport as the natural
  reserve for war aviator and machines. The British have recently subsidised
  the various commercial concerns which run the poor, partial, under-equipped
  air services between Britain and the Continent, to the extent of a million
  pounds, no doubt with some such fancy about air reserves in mind. The
  consolidation of the British air companies was followed at once by a
  reduction of the salaries of the pilots, and a defensive strike on their
  part. The ideal pilot of the companies seems to be a higher sort of omnibus
  driver, hardly better paid. So far there has been no visible increase in
  equipment. Nothing could have brought out more plainly the essential conflict
  between profit-making and public service. The need of civilisation in respect
  to peace and war ends alike is to work out the possibilities of flying to
  their utmost extent and at any cost to attract exceptionally capable men to
  every branch of the service. The natural aim of a consolidated group of
  companies seeking profit is to stabilise conditions at the nearest possible
  profitable level, regardless of the future and the public welfare. In no
  branch of human activity is private enterprise for gain more mischievous than
  in transport, and in no field of transport has private enterprise shown
  itself more wasteful and futile than in air transport. During the war flying
  was everywhere a State enterprise, and enormous progress was made in every
  development of air science. Since the war progress has slowed down to
  negligible proportions under the magic touch of the modern business man. His
  method is to standardise; he is the enemy of distinctive quality wherever it
  is to be found.</p>

  <h2><a id="art36"
     name="art36">LABOUR POLITICIANS:<br>
  THE EVAPORATION OF THE INTELLIGENZIA</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">10.5.1924</p>

  <p class="first">At the last General Election the British Labour Party was
  supported with the most whole-hearted enthusiasm by a great cloud of artistic
  and intellectual workers. It had the Intelligenzia solidly for it. It had all
  the higher and better theatrical and artistic workers on its side: such great
  literary names as Bernard Shaw and Bertrand Russell, such men of science as
  Soddy. They supported it for a variety of very understandable reasons. They
  were revolted by the mean and sterile dullness of the two historical but
  disintegrating parties. They were bored to death by Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd
  George, Mr. Baldwin, Lord Birkenhead, their endless differences, and their
  essential resemblance. They were attracted by the brave hopefulness and the
  constructive programme of the new party. They were even allowed to dot the
  i's and cross the t's of its ample promises. No doubt they helped at the
  election, though Heaven knows to what extent. They certainly brought in
  youth, ever in love with ideas, to canvass and toil for the party; they
  brought in clever journalists and able controversialists.</p>

  <p>But all that was six months ago. Now Labour has been tarnished by office I
  doubt whether it will exercise the same compelling magic upon intellectually
  adventurous people. There is all the difference in the world between
  encouraging a Labour Party which promises everything glorious, and bolstering
  up a Labour Government which does nothing amusing. I doubt if the
  Intelligenzia is likely to be very energetic when the next election
  comes.</p>

  <p>It is not in the nature of an Intelligenzia to support a political party
  in office. Its function in the community is to criticise actuality, and to
  startle and enlarge people's aesthetic, scientific, political, and social
  perceptions. It is always against the thing that is, and it is always in
  advance of the thing that can practically be. And what it is saying of the
  Labour Government now is that it is just as dull and just as shifty and just
  as futile as a Left Liberal Government would have been. Mr. C. P. Trevelyan
  seems to have some meritorious intentions about education, and there has been
  a recognition of Russia&mdash;which the Liberals would have given us just as
  well. Apart from that, what have the Intelligenzia got for all their support
  of Labour?</p>

  <p>In Mr. Ramsay MacDonald we have one of the ablest of living public
  speakers, a Prime Minister of unparalleled piety and gentility, but that is
  insufficient to console the Intelligenzia for their general disappointment.
  The more brightly the personality of Mr. Ramsay MacDonald shines, the less
  visible are the creative ideas for which their advanced spirits followed him.
  Instead of some genuine effort toward disarmament there has been the most
  foolish treatment possible of the business of the five cruisers. There has
  not even been a gesture towards the nationalisation of transport, mines, and
  the production of staple commodities. At least the Labour Ministers might
  have availed themselves of official files and opportunities, to prepare
  reports, digest facts and set inquiries afoot that would open a way to future
  nationalisation. The Capital Levy has gone behind a screen. There has been a
  muddle over housing and a resort to Liberal assistance. These Labour leaders
  over whom the Intelligenzia waved its banners of constructive Socialism and
  of a world remade, so bravely, turn out to be for the most part just ordinary
  politicians abjectly afraid to stop anything or start anything that may
  affect votes.</p>

  <p>There is the utmost symbolical value in the behaviour of the new Labour
  Ministers towards Court affairs. Great Britain is a monarchy and the
  Ministers must go to Court, but there was no law and no necessity to require
  a Labour representative in a Labour Ministry to dress up in an expensive and
  unsuitable livery. The neat blue serge suit in which such a man would attend
  a Labour Congress or pay his respects to his God in church or chapel was
  surely good enough for a Court visit. A red tie, perhaps, in suitable cases
  could have emphasised the note of Socialism. But no! These men the
  Intelligenzia worked for and elected as the representatives of a new age must
  needs set out at once to beg, borrow, or steal the uniform of the old. As the
  newspaper photographs witness, most of them wear it with little grace or
  dignity. They have the self-conscious solemnity of a new local mayor in his
  robes. As a rule it matters little what a man wears, but these liveries
  betrayed stupendous acquiescences. It was unfortunate for the good relations
  of the Intelligenzia with the Labour Party that two police spies were found
  under the platform of a private meeting of the Communist Party the other day.
  The Intelligenzia will always have a very tolerant corner in its heart for
  the Communist Party in Britain and America. The party gets hold of a lot of
  the best of the young people and does them a lot of good. It is extremist,
  and you cannot have a healthy mental life in a community in which extremist
  opinions and intentions are not fairly stated. Prohibition of opinions is an
  insult to adult citizens. In Great Britain at least the Communist Party is a
  perfectly legal organisation. It has as much right to hold a private meeting
  as the Liberal or Tory Party. It is the business of the police and Government
  to respect and protect its privacy. Mr. Henderson ought to know a lot about
  the Communists. They supply a healthy criticism and irritant on the Left wing
  of his party. He ought to have known this police annoyance was going on, and
  he ought to have stopped it as soon as he came into office. Either he knew
  this meeting was going to be spied upon or he did not. If he did he does not
  understand freedom, and if he did not his officials are lacking in respect
  for him.</p>

  <p>In a large number of quite symptomatic affairs the Labour Government
  either through ignorance or through other preoccupations has failed to take
  advantage of its opportunities, and each one of these failures estranges some
  new group of intelligent people. For example, everyone with a vision a little
  wider than the politician's realises the importance of China to the future of
  mankind. In the long run, even the question of the mishandling of the five
  cruisers may prove less serious than negligence on the part of our Government
  toward the China Boxer indemnity money. The Chinese ask for a directive voice
  in that matter. Dr. Tsai is the Chancellor of Pekin University; he represents
  the best educational influences in China. He comes to London, but he finds
  most of the Ministers he wants to see too busy trying on their breeches and
  stockings to see him. He is given a nice talk with a permanent official, and
  told in the best official style that all his suggestions will be most
  carefully considered by the "Committee." The Committee which is to be set up
  may be just the sort of Committee that destroys the confidence of progressive
  Chinamen in British good faith. As it was first planned it represented
  material interests strongly; it had only one member who could be called an
  educationist; and there was no representative of New China upon it at all.
  There has been much coming and going since then, and the situation may be to
  a large extent saved, but if so it will be in spite of rather than thanks to
  any creative comprehension on the part of the Foreign Secretary or any member
  of the Labour Government.</p>

  <p>One could multiply instances of this sort of wasted opportunity, in which
  the Labour Government has displayed itself as obtuse and blind as any
  Government could have been. Mr. Smillie, the other day, rejecting "all
  understandings with Liberals," declares that the Labour Party is "out to deal
  with root causes." But this Labour Government has never dared to be caught
  looking at a "root cause" yet. Take the question of birth-control. England is
  over-populated; it has a million unemployed; it cannot house its population
  decently, and it cannot educate its numerous progeny above a miserably low
  standard. But the Roman Catholic vote is organised against birth-control, and
  the Labour politicians dare not offend the Roman Catholic vote. Yet the
  housing problem, the unemployment problem, the organisation of education, the
  relations of the British Empire with other countries, the question of the
  necessity of war, all become absolutely different according to whether the
  population of the country is considered as being stationary or expansive. But
  this present Labour Government does not know whether it is for birth-control
  or against it. It does not know anything of that sort about itself. It does
  not know whether it is shaping the future for a restrained or overflowing
  population. The Intelligenzia, in the enthusiasm of its plunge into politics,
  thought that the Labour Party&mdash;as distinguished from all other
  parties&mdash;did. And generally they are coming to realise how greatly they
  overrated the creative power and the creative will of Labour.</p>

  <p>As the exhilaration consequent upon being allowed <i>carte blanche</i> to
  write promises for the Labour Party evaporates, the Intelligenzia will revert
  to its normal and proper aloofness from politicians. The Intelligenzia are
  the rain and the wind and sunshine of the political field, but not the
  field-workers of politics. To have the Intelligenzia in a party is like an
  elemental being married to a mortal. Elementals have magic gifts, but they
  are not always comfortable to live with. The Labour politicians will feel
  more and more masters in their own house&mdash;at least until the next
  election&mdash;as the critical, exacting Intelligenzia evaporate from the
  party.</p>

  <h2><a id="art37"
     name="art37">CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS AND<br>
  THEIR RELATION TO CURRENT POLITICS</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">17.5.1924</p>

  <p class="first">Mr. Smillie, a little while ago, was talking of the peculiar
  mental virtues of the Labour Party. It was "out to deal with root causes" and
  so forth. There was to be no parleying with Liberals. This was immediately
  before Mr. Snowden produced the greatest Liberal Budget in history; something
  off something for everybody and no Socialist confiscation. I was moved at the
  time of Mr. Smillie's speech to point out that the Labour Government had not
  been caught looking at the root cause of anything whatever since it came into
  office. It had put on its Court livery like little gentlemen, and done as it
  was told. That "root cause" delusion was created in the mind of Mr. Smillie
  by reading the election addresses of his associates.</p>

  <p>For a time, until it got into office, the Labour Party was a magnificent
  hoarding for the constructive Radical. At bottom it is a party of feelings
  rather than ideas. It became boldly, outspokenly Socialist. It was declared
  to stand for a broad collective handling of our common interests, for
  scientific method. It wasn't afraid of bankers or landowners or
  Protection-seeking trade monopolists. It stood for the free, high
  constructive future against the injustice and mean limitations of the
  present. It was the New Age struggling to be. But really it wasn't for all
  those things because it was so at heart, but because it had to say something
  different from all other parties, and the creative Intelligenzia prompted it.
  So long as it was out of office active constructive minds could do its public
  thinking for it. But now that the Labour Party has taken office it has come
  of age and become an adult political party; it has lost the wild freshness
  and promise of youth, and begun to act for itself. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, with
  his piety and his political dexterity, is extremely like a Scotch, instead of
  a Welsh, Lloyd George, and the array of his colleagues is revealed as the
  very twin brothers of the Tory and Liberal knights, local councillors,
  provincial mayors, and so forth we have always known. The Labour Party
  brought down from the cloudland of promise to performance is seen to be
  little more than another of the numerous Liberal parties that have appeared
  in the vast inchoate world of British Liberalism. It has appeared and
  struggled to office because Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Asquith were tiresome,
  obstinate egotists without an up-to-date idea between them, and because the
  complexity of self-conscious interests in Great Britain is too great any
  longer for the magnificent simplicity and "loyalties" of the old two-party
  system.</p>

  <p>All this is perfectly natural and necessary. All political parties must
  represent the present, existing interests, existing social fears and
  jealousies, current delusions. No political party can represent the future,
  as Mr. Smillie would have us believe the Labour Party does. But it was the
  delusion of Karl Marx that the expropriated masses of mankind, living at a
  disadvantage, would necessarily realise the desirability of a more highly
  organised Socialist State and evolve a collective will to bring it about.
  This idea, through the devoted repetition of the Marxists, has infected the
  greater part of Socialist thought. It had manifestly infected Mr. Smillie. In
  so far as modern social inequalities and injustices, illuminated by modern
  educational influences, have brought out a steadily increasing hostility
  between the masses and the classes with an advantage, Marx was right, but in
  so far as that has involved the development of any capacity whatever to
  achieve a new and better order, he was wrong. The uncomfortable masses seek
  uncritically for some expression of their antagonism to the lucky, the
  dexterous, the unscrupulous, and the far-sighted who enjoy the advantages of
  the existing social and economic tangle, and their suffrages and passion will
  go to support the particular lucky, dexterous, unscrupulous, or far-sighted
  politicians who seem most in harmony with the hates and hopes of the stinted,
  hampered, and oppressed multitude. But the antagonisms and discords of the
  present system are as much a part of the present as its order and its
  success. The Labour Party as a Labour Party is no more inherently
  reconstructive than the Banking Interest or the Shipping Interest. Like them,
  it merely wants an excessive and inconsiderate share of present power and
  satisfactions.</p>

  <p>I suppose if we could set aside the entangling influences of social
  position and traditions we should find that men and women fell into a series
  between two extremes of temperamental type; the Conservatives at one end, who
  like things to go on very much as they are going, only to be just a little
  richer and sounder and sunnier, and at the other end the disturbers who like
  fresh things to happen and who make fresh things happen. And of the
  disturbers there seem to be two main types: the personal adventurers who want
  a series of vivid events centring upon themselves, and do not care very much
  how much disorder is caused by their careers, and the innovators with an
  instinct or a mental habit of creative service&mdash;the scientific worker,
  the educationist, the innovating artist, the men with a passion for
  industrial and financial and social organisation, who will ultimately remake
  the world. These types mingle in most of us, we are all something of each,
  but in such prominent British figures as Lord Birkenhead, Mr. Winston
  Churchill, or Lord Beaverbrook we seem to have almost pure adventurers, and
  in Mr. Sidney Webb or Mr. C.P. Trevelyan almost pure creative service
  innovators. But the great financial adventurers are not in politics. They are
  behind politics. The unco-ordinated, inexplicit world of to-day is all for
  the bold acquisitive egoist; he causes wars and prevents peace, the
  industrialist is in his financial net, he does things to the exchange and the
  money in our pockets becomes worthless counters, he controls the news in our
  newspapers, and buys the house over our heads and the ground under our feet.
  He turns up in all parties as they suit him, and his eternal antagonist, the
  creative service innovator, must use all parties as he can against him.</p>

  <p>No party has a monopoly of creative ideals; the Labour Party little more
  than the Conservative. For consider what the great constructive ideas before
  the world at the present time are. There is the rescue of civilisation from
  the destructive pressure of unregulated births through the extension of the
  necessary knowledge for efficient birth-control. There is the reorganisation
  of educational method throughout the world to develop the habits of service
  and co-operation upon the lines so admirably demonstrated by Sanderson and
  the re-orientation of educational aims and material by making universal
  history the basis of the conception of a universal citizenship. There is the
  rescue of democracy from its hopeless suffocation under the party system, by
  the reduction in the size of representative bodies to efficient proportions,
  and the adoption of the method of proportional representation in large
  constituencies. Only in that way can the ordinary citizen be released from
  his slavery to party managers and brought into a direct personal relationship
  to the member his vote elects. There is the liberation of the economic life
  of the world from restrictive and destructive financial manipulations by the
  creation of a world authority for a regulated currency and the clearing of
  the world debt jungle. There is the lifting of the waste and weight of
  private profiteering and nationalist sabotage, from shipping and world
  transport and the staple productions of the world, through the creation of a
  group of world authorities for these ends. Everybody of intelligence knows
  that these are just possible achievements for mankind, and that the outlook
  for mankind is dangerous and on the whole dingy until they are attained and
  secured. But there is no political party in the world that dare do more in
  office than fumble and prevaricate about any of them.</p>

  <h2><a id="art38"
     name="art38">THE WEMBLEY EMPIRE:<br>
  AN EXHIBITION OF LOST OPPORTUNITIES</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">24.5.1924</p>

  <p class="first">The preparation of a great exhibition of the glories of the
  British Empire at Wembley profoundly deranged the order of nature. The skies
  wept copiously; the English spring showed every sign of distress. The
  builders struck at the eleventh hour, and were only allayed by a patriotic
  speech by Mr. Thomas. The show opened in a state of entirely British
  unpreparedness, and the ceremony went chiefly to demonstrate that the
  development of building in concrete was a much more imposing fact in human
  life than the continued existence of the British Empire.</p>

  <p>Under the circumstances it was unfortunate that the King should have
  reminded the assembled company of the Great Exhibition of 1851. That was
  opened in sunshine, and in a sunshine of hope and great ideas. It was
  international in design and spirit; the first of a great series of such
  displays. Its guiding spirit was the Prince Consort, one of the most
  intelligent and creative princes who have ever stood near the British throne.
  Heaven alone knows how deep Britain would not be wallowing in ignorance and
  vain delusions if it had not been for his initiatives. He stirred the
  self-satisfied lethargy of Oxford and Cambridge, so ^hat they have never
  really slept in peace since, and to this day the Commissioners of his
  Exhibition administer great funds for scientific and artistic education. The
  most stimulating things in that Exhibition were the displays of foreign
  products. They woke up England to the fact that she was falling behind
  technically and artistically; they caused heart-searchings and effort. But
  this show is a show of Empire products, "just among ourselves." We no longer
  want to know what the world is thinking and doing outside the ring fence of
  Empire. If the foreigner is being cleverer than we are in any department we
  do not propose to hear of it.</p>

  <p>The King said that the aim of the Exhibition was more "modest" than that
  of the great show of seventy-three years ago. Was "modest" the word to use?
  Or "base"? Is this fiat bragging that follows really modesty? It is the tune
  to which the whole thing goes. The London show of 1851 was Tennysonian, and
  Tennyson sang of the confederation of the world; Wembley in 1924 is
  Kiplingesque or nothing, and this is Mr. Kipling's "modest" cry to the
  Dominions. To set the rhyme going, and without any particular geographical
  reference, he informs the Dominions "the pathways are broad":</p>

  <p class="poem">"In thy house and my house is half the world's hoard; In thy
  house and my house hangs all the world's fate; On thy house and my house lies
  half the world's hate."</p>

  <p>What a combination of the spirit of grab and the spirit of panic is here!
  Not thus did the Hyde Park crystal palace reflect God's sunlight. Is it true
  of the British Empire, is it just to the British Empire, that the rhyming of
  this hysterical boy scout should be accepted as the expression of its deepest
  realities? It is at Wembley. At Wembley the British people do seem to be
  represented to the world in perfect good faith as the scared favourites of
  good fortune, keenly aware of a richly merited unpopularity, but reluctant to
  disgorge. So they are all g-g-going to h-hold together and not be afraid. The
  Exhibition, apart from a large area devoted to Coney Island amusements, where
  the Imperial citizen can for a time forget his imperial anxieties in vehement
  motion and noise, is a display of scenery and merchandise. There are, of
  course, one or two unclassifiable exhibits&mdash;the Queen's delightful
  Dolls' House, for example&mdash;but these are in the nature of irrelevances,
  and a small extra admission fee emphasises the fact. The core, the reality of
  Wembley, is a show of natural resources and manufactured goods, for which
  preferential consideration is demanded on the score of a common jealousy,
  fear and hatred of foreign peoples.</p>

  <p>A small pavilion does remind us, it is true, of the League of Nations to
  which the Empire as a whole and also in pieces belongs, but the League of
  Nations is far less pervasive than Australian wool or New Zealand mutton. It
  peeps like a little man in the back row at a football match; the salesman's
  shoutings drown its voice.</p>

  <p>Now I know I am not supposed to be a very perfect patriot, but I protest
  that this meretricious shop-window at Wembley does no justice to the real
  greatness of the British people in the world's affairs. The New Zealand
  pavilion, for example&mdash;I quote an advertisement&mdash;"displays in the
  most picturesque and attractive way the wonderful charms and remarkable
  industrial development of this important Dominion. New Zealand is the
  greatest supplier to Great Britain of Dairy Produce, Mutton and Lamb, and
  Cross-Bred Wool&mdash;industries which have impressive representation. Her
  export and import trade is the greatest per capita in the world. New Zealand
  has the finest Mountain, Forest, Lake, and River scenery, and deer-stalking,
  trout and salmon fishing equal to the best in the world," and so on. But New
  Zealand does not exhibit Professor Gilbert Murray nor Mr. Harold Williams nor
  a score of other brilliant sons and daughters she has given back to the
  world's affairs. There is a great display of the rich and picturesque side of
  Indian life again, but no satisfactory representation of the very
  considerable work of education that must have been done in India. The British
  have founded Universities at Khartoum and in Mesopotamia; one looks in vain
  for models or schemes of them here. You may go about the Exhibition, and find
  butter and tallow and hides at every turn, but you will find no reproductions
  of the fine new public schoolhouses these rich young Dominions must possess,
  the colleges and research institutions they must have set going, and their
  magnificent arrangements for the interchange of students and ideas with India
  and the Homeland and the world generally.</p>

  <p>We British cannot be such fools as to have neglected these things. But I
  cannot find the exhibits. Nor is there any display of the scientific and
  intellectual irrigation of the Press, nor of the machinery of
  book-publication and distribution that sustains the mental unity of the
  Dominions....</p>

  <p>But I find my mind slipping away from the Wembley that is, to the dream of
  the Wembley that might have been. I drift off into a vision of the exhibits
  of work and achievement from the eighteen or twenty great Universities we
  have surely set up in India; the studies and reports of the two thousand
  students we send annually to that great land; the display of intellectual
  interchanges between the four or five splendid Australian Universities and
  Japan and China, Burma and Siam; the achievements of the great schools of
  Polynesian ethnology at Sidney and Adelaide and Brisbane; the splendid
  educational work of Canada in China, rivalling the American effort: the joint
  exhibit of the United States and Canada of the scientific exploration of the
  Arctic and the Pacific; the vast pavilion giving a comparative treatment of
  the efforts of South Africa, Jamaica, and the United States to deal with the
  civilisation and assimilation of "colour"; the Capetown to Cairo school of
  African history, ethnology and economic geography. Surely these things have
  been seen to! We are so rich.</p>

  <p class="poem">"In thy house and my house is half the world's hoard."</p>

  <p>But what are we doing with it? Are we just hoarding it? I thought the
  White Man's Burthen was a magnificent task, not a bundle of loot that he
  stood upon to brag about. I must have taken the wrong turning when I went to
  Wembley. I must go there again. I must go right on and find the turning
  beyond the ones that lead to these magnificent displays of machinery and
  metal and wool and grease.</p>

  <h2><a id="art39"
     name="art39">THE EXTINCTION OF PARTY GOVERNMENT</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">31.5.1924</p>

  <p class="first">The politicians of Great Britain, under the pressure of
  various accidental and some fundamental necessities, are being forced towards
  an honest democracy and efficient government. But they resist with great
  activity and ingenuity.</p>

  <p>A Bill for what is called Proportional Representation, but which is really
  sane voting, has recently been rejected by the House of Commons by a majority
  of 238 to 144. It had the official support of the Liberal Party. Previously
  the Liberal hacks were all against it, but they have been chastened by the
  last two elections. The Bill went very far towards honest representative
  government, but in one respect it went no distance at all towards a great
  revolution in political method. When the time comes for its re-introduction
  it will be necessary to extend it or supplement it by another reducing the
  numbers of the representative assembly.</p>

  <p>The urgencies of the British situation have put Great Britain far in
  advance of the United States in this matter. There is a very respectable
  movement for Proportional Representation in the United States of America, but
  it has still to be realised as practical politics and a serious need by the
  American public. In America every citizen is born either a little Republican
  or else a little Democrat; it does not matter what the Republican or
  Democratic platform is or what sort of man is put up for him in his division,
  he has to vote for his party. Or else go through a crisis almost like
  disowning his father and mother and vote for the other party. There is
  nothing else in the world for him to do in politics, just as there was
  nothing else but being ''either a little Liberal or else a little
  Conservative" in the great days of Gilbert and Sullivan in London. The United
  States is young, prosperous, and at a great advantage to the rest of the
  world; it may be able to afford its present travesty of democracy for a long
  time yet. Britain cannot. The party system has always been more rigidly
  organised in America than in England. In Britain on the Left side, counting
  Liberal, Labour, and Communist together, there are eight or ten distinct
  schools of political thought and intention; on the Right side there are five
  or six. The British voter grows more and more erratic and uncertain under the
  present idiotic system, and the results of General Elections more and more
  silly and incalculable.</p>

  <p>The idea of Proportional Representation is now nearly a century old. It is
  due to a clear-headed man named Hare. He proposed that a number of candidates
  should stand for the whole country as one constituency. The voter would vote
  for the man he liked and trusted best. If that man were so widely liked and
  trusted that he got more votes than were needed to return him, he would take
  as large a fraction of every vote as he needed, and if the voter had
  indicated a second choice on his paper, the rest of his vote would go to the
  candidate next on his list. Whatever happened, some or all of the voter's
  support would go to the man he had chosen. That man would be his man par
  excellence. There could be no more direct relationship between voter and
  representative. But if that man were a very great and desirable man, the
  voter could also congratulate himself on the partial possession of a second
  or even a third, more personal representative. There are people who profess
  to find great diffIculty in understanding Proportional Representation; mostly
  this is a purely wilful and subjective befuddlement. The filling up of the
  voting papers is perfectly simple and the counting and fractionation of the
  votes offers no difficulty to any properly instructed educated person.</p>

  <p>For trivial reasons Hare's voting method, which would give us an almost
  pure representative democracy, has been modified in all the practical
  proposals made by the division of the country into large constituencies
  instead of leaving it one whole, and the assignation of a limited but still
  large number of members to each. But its virtue of comparative veracity in
  representation still to a large extent remains. Mr. Rendall's recent Bill
  proposed constituencies returning not less than three and not more than seven
  members. This is much too small for a real representation of British opinion,
  but it was as much as the party wire-pullers would allow. When the question
  is reopened this maximum should be increased.</p>

  <p>Of course the systems called Proportional Representation in use in France
  and Italy are scoundrelly caricatures of the idea. Under them the voters vote
  not for men but for party gangs, and the whole object of Proportional
  Representation is to release men from servitude to party manipulation.</p>

  <p>The objections to the measure made in the debate upon the rejected Bill
  were mostly very trivial or based on positive misconceptions. The question
  was indeed not discussed. Most of the opponents from the Labour side
  contented themselves with twitting the Liberal politicians with change of
  heart upon the question. They behaved just as the Liberal Party hacks did in
  1918 because they are exactly the same sort of men. The mentality of the
  party hack, Liberal, Labour, or Conservative, is very much on a level in this
  matter. Most of the big men in all parties are for Proportional
  Representation, because they know they are outstanding enough to survive its
  establishment. The party hack knows he lives through and by his party: the
  voter does not choose him but suffers him, and at the first clear opportunity
  the voter will push him out of the way and choose a more interesting
  non-party man. About seventy Labour men who have at one time or another
  professed approval of Proportional Representation did not vote.</p>

  <p>The struggle against Proportional Representation is really the life
  struggle of the professional party politician. Under Proportional
  Representation the legislative assembly, instead of being elected by a small
  majority, or even a minority of the voters in the country, will be
  representative of nearly the whole country. In a constituency electing ten
  members, for instance, there will probably be less than a tenth of that
  constituency not actually represented by members returned. This wipes out
  every hope of a bilateral political system, because it will fill the assembly
  with free members, responsible only to the voters who have returned them, and
  practically independent of organised party support. They will necessarily be
  very various in their opinions.</p>

  <p>It is not yet sufficiently realised, even by the supporters of
  Proportional Representation, that a country which returns men because they
  are distinctive and significant to its Legislature&mdash;and that is what the
  adoption of Proportional Representation means&mdash;will need an assembly of
  a different size and type from the present clumsy crowd of notables and
  nobodies at Westminster. There are too many members of Parliament at
  Westminster for efficiency, just as there are too many Congressmen at
  Washington. They loaf about. They do mischief in obscurity.</p>

  <p>They make trouble in order to realise their own existence. They are to
  public affairs what excessive fat is to the body of a man. These big
  legislative bodies date from a time when group psychology was not thought of.
  It is even possible that a big legislative body elected by Proportional
  Representation would be a worse evil even than the party house. Released from
  the party ties that control them, bunched into fluctuating groups, the scores
  and hundreds of unnecessary members would obstruct and confuse every
  legislative proposal. Proportional Representation must mean not only the
  suppression of the hack politician, but also the suppression of the
  commonplace member. For efficient government we want a Legislature no larger
  than is fairly representative of the broad varieties of public opinion. At
  the largest we need only from two hundred to three hundred members, a grand
  committee of the nation, appointing Ministers severally, assigning tasks to
  sub-committees, and expressing the general ideas of the country. We shall
  certainly be able to dispense with the rotation of the "ins and outs" and
  possibly with the organised Cabinet in such a Legislature. The adoption of
  Proportional Representation will be a much profounder and more revolutionary
  change than a mere change in voting procedure. It will necessitate an
  entirely new type of representative government. In that lies its importance
  in the world's affairs and its fascination and desirability for most
  intelligent people.</p>

  <h2><a id="art40"
     name="art40">THE SERFDOM OF IGNORANCE:<br>
  THE RIGHT OF WOMEN TO KNOWLEDGE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">7.6.24 The British Labour movement is being agitated at present
  by one of the most important questions in the world, the question whether a
  woman has a right to clear and complete knowledge about her own body and the
  fundamental facts of her life. It is a searching and dividing question that
  may very well split the party into two discordant sections. The old-fashioned
  politicians who haven't yet observed that women have now got votes, consider
  the question ought to be left outside politics. It is too real a question for
  the old parliamentary game. What would the grand Old Man have said about it?
  The Elder Spinsters of the Labour movement also rally to the protection of
  Mr. Ramsay MacDonald's gentility, his fine old-fashioned statesmanlike
  evasiveness. But the Labour Women's Conference carried a resolution against
  the blushingly tactful Elder Spinsters. These younger women believe that
  women really are responsible citizens, that democracy does mean treating
  adults with respect instead of concealing anything that matters most to them
  from them; that women ought to know what marriage means for them and how
  motherhood may be undertaken or declined before diseases and children and
  such-like intense and overwhelming things blot out their youth and
  health.</p>

  <p>The demand the younger, more intelligent women in the Labour movement are
  making is that knowledge should be freely, easily, and honourably accessible
  to all British women. It is well to get this precisely clear. No one purposes
  to force this knowledge upon anyone. That typical political artful dodger,
  Mr. Wheatley, the Labour Minister of Health, pretends obstinately that that
  is so. But no woman who likes to be coyly ignorant, and to be overtaken by
  illness and offspring before she understands anything about them, need seek
  such knowledge. All that the innovators ask is that it should be there
  available for those women who want to know what they may do and what they can
  do with their lives, who want to go into motherhood or refuse or delay going
  into motherhood with their e3''es open. Personally, I think that innocence is
  a charm confined to immaturity, and that every adult of eighteen ought to
  know clearly all that is of vital importance to conduct in married life
  before marriage, but in this I go far beyond the modest ambitions of the
  advanced section of the Labour Party. They want this knowledge to be
  available only to the married. They want the medical men engaged at such
  public institutions as child-welfare centres and the like to be
  free&mdash;subject only to their interpretation of their professional
  honour&mdash;to give such information as may be asked for upon these matters.
  They want doctors in receipt of public money to have the same liberty of
  advice that every doctor feed by an upper-class woman has. They do not want
  poor women living in crowded homes to be obliged to bear offspring just as
  cows bear offspring, whether they want to or not, out of sheer ignorance and
  helplessness.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wheatley says, as his excuse for refusing this liberation of
  knowledge, that Roman Catholic voters will object to paying rates and taxes
  if this sort of use is made of public money. The Roman Catholic is to decide
  what the poor Protestant woman shall know and do. This is a pretty impudent
  claim for a religion that was formerly disenfranchised. But the whole Labour
  Party in Parliament cringes at the thought of the Roman Catholic vote. As a
  matter of fact, there is nothing in sound Roman Catholic teaching to forbid
  the diffusion of physiological knowledge. There is nothing, indeed, in proper
  Roman Catholic teaching to prohibit the practice of birth-control under any
  circumstances. At any time the Vatican might commend birth-control; it is not
  committed in the least in that respect. But a great number of priests, like
  our Labour Elder Spinsters, betray an extreme excitability and malignity at
  the thought of any sexual life that is not mainly frustrated desire. They
  commit the extreme sin of presumption, they invent teachings quite
  unsanctioned by the Church to excuse the impulses of their own troubled and
  unhappy thoughts. And it is of the back-street priest and not of the eternal
  Church that Mr. Wheatley and his Labour colleagues as pushing politicians
  have chiefly to think.</p>

  <p>Now let the reader note that in this paper I have said not a word for or
  against the practices known as birth-control nor about anticipatory sexual
  hygiene. I have my own very definite opinions on these matters, but the
  question under discussion here is not what should or may be done, but about
  what may be known. It is the far profounder question of whether common poor
  people are to be treated as worthy of understanding and knowing about the
  things that concern their most intimate lives, or whether in the interests of
  cheap labour, the Roman Catholic, population statistics, army recruiting,
  racial jealousy, or out of regard to the unpleasant feelings and imaginations
  of priests and elderly spinsters, they are to be left and imprisoned in black
  ignorance even when they want to know. Here I find in myself a streak of
  surprisingly passionate democracy. I hold that every man and woman should be
  the conscious and instructed master of his or her own fate. It is amazing, it
  is dismaying, to find a Labour Minister as ready to consider the common
  people a breeding herd of human beasts and as ready to keep them helplessly
  in the dark as the extremist Tory could be. I am convinced that even as a
  politician he has blundered. When women fought for votes they fought for a
  symbol; the reality was the possession of themselves. And that is impossible
  without this, if not forbidden, at least impeded knowledge.</p>

  <p>Most politicians have still to learn the significance of the women's vote.
  Because one or two pretty ladies on the Labour side have lost their heads,
  adorned themselves in trains and ostrich feathers, given themselves over to
  the photographers and interviewers and succumbed to the delightful temptation
  of patronising the Queen, it does not follow that the mass of Labour women
  are not intensely sane and realist. Sexual questions are coming into
  politics, and they are coming to stay. Before the next election every
  parliamentary candidate will have to make up his mind whether he stands for
  knowledge or ignorance in this matter.</p>

  <h2><a id="art41"
     name="art41">BLINKERS FOR FREE YOUTH:<br>
  YOUNG AMERICA ASKS TO HEAR AND SEE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">14.6.1924</p>

  <p class="first">A SURE way to madden Americans is to make comparisons
  between education in the United States and in Western Europe. Even if the
  comparison is flattering it leaves them mad. Apparently belief in the
  superior education of the American citizen is becoming as sacred as belief in
  the American constitution. Doubt is prohibited. Visitors to the United States
  may presently have to sign a form about it.</p>

  <p>Hitherto with an extraordinary discretion I have avoided, or at least
  skirted, this sensitive point. I propose to continue to skirt it. There has
  been one exception. I touched upon the sore place a little while ago in a
  book called The Dream, and my mail from America came for some weeks bristling
  with an unwonted and distressing hostility. I gave an account of the
  elementary school teaching of England ¦&mdash;it is much the same stuff, more
  or less, in most civilised countries&mdash;as I think it will appear to an
  observer a few centuries ahead. I added casually that on the whole the
  American rural school was worse than the English one I described. To the best
  of my knowledge and belief it is worse. In many parts of the United States
  the elementary education is far below the Western European level, the
  consequent illiteracy is shocking, and I should not be doing my duty as a
  writer for the English-speaking public if I did not say so. I was not
  thinking so much of new districts inhabited by fresh immigrants, but of old,
  native-born American regions, like Kentucky. The United States is abnormally
  slack about its elementary education, and needs plain, stimulating speech in
  the matter. But the Americans are in a state of irritable self-satisfaction
  about their schools. They are refusing almost violently to know that their
  general education has not kept pace with their enormous increase in wealth
  and material civilisation. Morally, if not legally, I am as much a citizen of
  the United States of America as of the British Empire; mentally the American
  and British worlds are two hemispheres of one brain; I cannot think of them
  functioning independently, and it is just as much my business to discuss this
  American slackness as it is to reprove the frightful negligences of the
  British in respect to Indian education.</p>

  <p>This, however, is in parenthesis. It is merely to emphasise the fact that
  in this article I am instituting no comparisons at all. I am taking a text
  from an American instance; that is all. There has been a little tiff between
  the undergraduates and the authorities of Harvard, and I find it extremely
  suggestive. The brighter of the Harvard undergraduates, represented on the
  governing board of the Harvard Union by Mr. Corliss Lamont, want to hear
  about Radicalism and Communism at first hand from people like Mr. Debs and
  Mr. W. Z. Foster, and the authorities are suppressing these youthful
  aspirations. They want the young men who will presently sway American affairs
  to be fed their knowledge of radical and revolutionary ideas by orthodox and
  respectable persons who have pre-digested it for them and removed all
  disturbing elements. The young men want the real stuff and to deal with it
  themselves. I confess myself heart and soul for these young men.</p>

  <p>There has recently been a controversy between Mr. Bertrand Russell and
  President Lowell about the relative mental freedom of American and British
  Universities. As Mr. Bertrand Russell was turned down for pacifism from
  Cambridge during the war, he started in that controversy with a handicap. It
  seems to me that such a dispute is bound to be ineffectual. There are cases
  of mental restriction and suppression from both sides of the Atlantic, and
  there are no scales invented yet to weigh this case against that. The real
  conflict here is not between American and European conditions, but between
  two types of men. It is a conflict that rages throughout the entire world.
  Everywhere one finds the managing, directive, limiting type of mind with a
  craving to get on to governing bodies, the industry to get on governing
  bodies, and a consequent tendency to get on governing bodies. Everywhere we
  find also a less abundant supply of critical, sceptical, creative, restless
  minds producing innovations and stimulating ideas and with an equal tendency
  to get thrown out of organisations and governing bodies. They are the seed,
  the ferment, the living factor in the human mind. In Dr. Nicholas Murray
  Butler America has produced the perfect specimen of the former class, just as
  in the late William James and in James Harvey Robinson she has produced
  excellent samples of the second. It is loudly boasted in British intellectual
  circles that Britain could not have produced Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, but
  so far as I am able to judge there is as much Nicholas Murray Butler-ism in
  Britain as in America, as much large empty active influential
  pretentiousness, though it may be more diffused, and it is at least as
  resolute to sit upon and addle intellectual institutions.</p>

  <p>For the peculiar evil of the governing body type is its failure to
  understand its lack of finality. It has no sense of the unknown, no sense of
  the provisional nature of all mundane things. It wants to fix knowledge in
  its own image, to make subsidiary and to apportion and departmentalise the
  work of the gifted exceptional and disturbing men. It seeks to set up
  classics, to perpetuate existing institutions, to inaugurate ancestor
  worship. Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler is to be the American Confucius and
  stereotype this perfect world of 1924; the last of the Founders. The coming
  generation will learn that at this point the world congealed. The thing this
  dominating type dreads supremely is revolutionary suggestion and the
  possibility of the young getting away with new ideas. Its educational ideal
  is blinkers and an obedient youth looking neither to the right nor the left,
  but pursuing the one right path.</p>

  <p>But the sustaining factor of life is death. Happily, most happily.
  Founders die, and their codes and constitutions, their classical utterances,
  die and pass away. Even the inspired addresses and deliverances of Dr.
  Nicholas Murray Butler, so beautifully printed and so relentlessly
  distributed, will some day shrivel and pass, and be no more heeded. So that
  life may go on. Without death there could be no birth. The most fundamental
  fact about youth is its disrespect for its elders and the past. That is what
  it is for. A generation that wanted to repeat the preceding generation would
  not be birth, it would be life stuttering. And the one thing youth does most
  need and want and fight to get, as its supreme instinctive duty, is and
  always will be every sort of destructive criticism of existing authorities,
  of the existing order, and of established institutions. Young America at
  Harvard probably has no illusions about Mr. Debs or Mr. Foster; it calls
  them, I am reasonably certain, "Old Debs" and ''Old Foster." But it means to
  hear them, it will hear them, and the college authorities had better help it
  to hear without any attempts whatever to jam the message Old Debs and Old
  Foster have to deliver against the old system young Harvard has been born to
  alter&mdash;and has been born for no other apparent end that I can see.</p>

  <p>Schools and Universities are surely the most paradoxical things in the
  whole preposterous spectacle of human life. They exist to prepare youth for a
  world of enormous changes, and their chief activity seems to be, at Oxford
  and Cambridge quite as much as at Harvard and Yale, to get youth apart from
  the world and conceal the forces of change from its curious and intelligent
  eyes. The youth of the Universities in particular should be the living eggs
  of the good new things of the days to come. The efforts of the governing
  bodies everywhere seem to be directed chiefly to getting them hard-boiled. My
  congratulations to Mr. Corliss Lamont for having so far escaped the culinary
  process. Nowadays there are Corliss Lamonts from China to Peru. The matter
  and the forms change but the spirit is the same. In Moscow they have to fight
  as hard as anywhere else; there it is to escape being made into hard-boiled
  Communists. By virtue of the rebellious vitality in our youth this world of
  mankind lives on and does not die and freeze into a monument to its
  Founders.</p>

  <h2><a id="art42"
     name="art42">THE LAWLESSNESS OF AMERICA AND THE WAY TO ORDER</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">21.6.1924</p>

  <p class="first">Miss Rebecca West, that acute and brilliant observer, has
  recently been in America, and she has been writing her impressions of the
  American scene. She has been lecturing and hand-shaking, but with commendable
  restraint she says little of her audiences, her hotels, and her railway
  journeys. She has looked over the heads of her hearers and out of the
  carriage windows. She has looked at the great spectacle as a whole, and she
  generalises about it broadly and bravely.</p>

  <p>The lack of civil order is the thing that strikes her most, and she
  illustrates her perception of it by a vivid and illuminating discussion of
  the necessity for prohibition and its consequent evils, and of the colour
  trouble in the South. Various previous British visitors have noted that lack
  in other terms, have remarked upon the want of a sense of the State in
  American thought, and of the reaction upon humanity of the fierce, untutored
  naturalness, the wide deserts, the undisciplined rivers, and spontaneous
  tangled forest growths of the New World.</p>

  <p>But when she looks for the forces that will presently bring order and
  graciousness into this characteristically splendid display of energy at large
  she calls rather startlingly for peasants. She thinks, in a phrase that might
  have come straight from something by Chesterton, that "nameless men who
  plough furrows that are straight and deep," peasants in bulk and multitude,
  are needed to establish a permanent social order, an enduring and developing
  civilisation.</p>

  <p>America has not enough peasants. This is an interesting development, or
  perhaps I had better say an interesting lapse, in the ideas of a woman we had
  come to regard, perhaps rashly, as a boldly progressive spirit. This is
  turning back to the earthy romanticism of Belloc and Chesterton, and I think
  it shows the profoundest misapprehension of the fundamentals of the American
  situation. America has not developed a peasant population&mdash;for it is
  sheer perversity of Miss West to write as she does of Abraham Lincoln as a
  peasant's son, as a traditional plough-driver, instead of an axe-wielder from
  the East. America, with machines to plough straighter and deeper than any
  clodhopper can ever do, has no need of peasants for any purpose at all,
  except perhaps as negro cotton-growers in the South. America is not
  developing a peasantry and probably never will. At present the drift to the
  towns is continuous, and rural depopulation is as present a problem in the
  United States as in Great Britain.</p>

  <p>That Miss West should associate civil order with a peasantry shows an odd
  forgetfulness of European conditions. England, which has had practically no
  peasantry for two centuries, but only wage-earning labourers, displays the
  greatest social order and security in the world; Russia, which is practically
  all peasantry, can, and could before the war, show a lawlessness, an
  indiscipline and social insecurity far exceeding anything of which Miss West
  complains in America. I would as soon accept Zola's valuation of the peasant
  in La Terre as Miss West's discovery of him as the soil from which all the
  social virtues spring.</p>

  <p>It is in quite another quarter that I should look for the forces that will
  ultimately adjust and bring together into a law-abiding social harmony all
  the loose and conflicting elements of the American State, and that is in a
  great development of schools and colleges. It is from the head and centre and
  not from the base that the modern community must be unified. It is a point
  that Miss West seems to ignore altogether, that the United States is, in
  spite of the aggregatory form of its constitution, the first instance of a
  new type of community altogether, the type that steam railways, electrical
  communications, and power machinery have made possible. It may have much
  trouble and darkness in its destiny, but nothing but complete disaster can
  ever lead to another repetition of that levelling down and earthing up of the
  human spirit in peasant life that underlies the old-world civilisations. The
  chief faults and merits of American life are alike the characteristics of a
  released population that has escaped from that intimate servitude to
  pedestrian locality, to the dungheap, the patch, the hovel, and the bitter
  narrow outlook, for ever.</p>

  <p>The reconstruction of human society in the great frame of these coming
  modern communities is the fascinating reality of political life behind the
  dullness and violence and unreality of personal rivalries and party issues.
  Its cardinal process is the establishment of a new education in terms of the
  common history and the common aim and a new training of everyone in service
  to scientifically conceived human purposes. It is an education that should
  not only occupy the first sixteen years of life altogether, but which should
  continue its informing and stimulating work throughout life. Only a few
  people, but it is a rapidly growing number, are beginning to realise the
  scale and equipment needed for this new nexus of education that will replace
  the old-world peasants' grubby priest by the new teachers of mankind. The
  educational effort that lies before the world, and more immediately before
  the United States as the pioneer of communal life upon a new scale, must
  needs be a vast and elaborate one&mdash;it is useless for the American to be
  content with schools about as good as European schools, or a little better,
  or not quite so good; they have to be reconceived in relation to the coming
  modern community, they have to be better and more effective, they have to be
  wider in range, if he is not to be thwarted of his immense opportunities of
  leadership in the present advance of our race towards new conditions of
  living. But the forces of educational development in a country work
  obscurely, the new beginnings are difficult to come at, the living seed lies
  below the surface. It is easy enough to go to America and be entertained and
  astonished by the bootlegger and the "snow" dealer, to feel the chromatic
  emotions of "colour," and note the drug store flaring at every street corner.
  These things signify about as much as the vivid spots that will sometimes
  appear on the face and shoulders of growing youth. But the research for
  educational developments is a subtle task, and it yields less florid
  pictures. We are badly in need of some stocktaking, English or American, of
  educational conditions in America.</p>

  <h2><a id="art43"
     name="art43">THE SHABBY SCHOOLS OF THE PIOUS:<br>
  DRAINS AND THE ODOUR OF SANCTITY</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">28.6.1924</p>

  <p class="first">One of the numerous questions which the Labour Government
  has to avoid most sedulously in its official egg dance is the question of the
  denominational school. Many of the denomination schools of England are in an
  advanced state of decay, most of them fall short of modern educational
  requirements, and the Labour Party made the amplest promises of educational
  progress in the electoral campaign that led it to office. Something drastic
  ought to be done about these denominational schools. But the present voting
  system, which gives the power of political decision to well-organised
  minorities, puts the Labour Party at the mercy of the Roman Catholic vote in
  a number of constituencies, the Roman Catholic community is particularly
  hostile to educational development, and so nothing is done. The decay of
  these schools proceeds.</p>

  <p>The compromise under which these denominational schools exist was made in
  1902. It was a characteristic British patch-up, and one of the most active
  figures in the making of it was the present Lord Cecil. Under it the schools
  of the various religious denominations were incorporated in the national
  education scheme, and the common public was to pay the running expenses of
  these schools and control the general instruction. The managers appointed by
  the religious body concerned were, however, to appoint all the teachers and
  control the religious instruction, and in return for these privileges they
  were to provide the school buildings and keep them in good repair. If, for
  instance, a particular school belonged to the Mumbo Jumbo sect, which
  believes that the earth was created flat and has never been more than
  slightly bent since, that it is wrong to regard bread as nutritious and
  improper for men and women to speak together in public places, then the
  managers were empowered to discover and appoint teachers of geography,
  physiology, and social history whose teachings would not disturb the children
  in their peculiar beliefs and practices, over the heads of more efficient and
  less orthodox candidates. A Mumbo Jumbo "atmosphere" would be created within
  the school, the sexes would be segregated, bread never mentioned or mentioned
  with a proper horror, and all terrestrial and celestial globes, maps of the
  world in hemispheres, busts or portraits of Columbus, Magellan, and the like
  excluded. In return for these supremely important religious privileges the
  sect of the Mumbo-Jumboites was to pay for the upkeep of the schools and keep
  them up to date in their appointments.</p>

  <p>Now it is a melancholy fact that parents belonging to the various British
  religious bodies concerned, parents we understood to be so passionately eager
  to see their children taught only their own tested and certified brand of
  truth that this compromise was made, have shown themselves indisposed to make
  any effort to pay even honestly, far less generously, for the spiritual
  advantages secured to them. A recent inquiry has directed attention to a very
  alarming state of affairs in these schools&mdash;of which altogether there
  are about twelve thousand in England and Wales&mdash;claiming to educate a
  million and a third children. A large proportion of them, we discover, have
  become badly decayed. They are described as "ill-ventilated, ill-lighted,
  with insufficient or worn-out sanitary, cloakroom, and lavatory
  accommodation." "A number of schools"&mdash;I quote the Leslie
  report&mdash;"are noted as having been condemned by the Board of Education
  before the war, but as being still in full use. The complaint is made that
  the Board's inspectors have ceased to mention the condition of these schools
  in their reports, presumably on instructions from headquarters, in the
  supposed interests of economy."</p>

  <p>"'Action would have to be taken with regard to playgrounds, sanitary
  arrangements, etc.,' says one authority, 'had there been any prospect of the
  requirements being carried out,' and many others say the same in different
  words. In one case there has been a sinkage of ground resulting in the
  breakage of drain-pipes, with the result that the soil is being polluted, but
  the managers will do nothing. In another case the authority says that 'both
  teachers and children are suffering physically and educationally, but the
  only possible alternative would be new buildings, and the managers have no
  funds.'"</p>

  <p>"General complaint is made as to the condition of the playgrounds, usually
  as being too small and inconvenient to begin with, and many either unusable
  or dangerous for want of repair. One of the counties, replying, says that out
  of 131 playgrounds attached to its Voluntary Schools 95 per cent, are in bad
  condition."</p>

  <p>There is no need to extend these quotations. Enough has been cited to show
  the peculiar quality of a problem which sooner or later will have to be faced
  by the British people. The fact is now beyond dispute that the Anglican,
  Roman Catholic, and such other denominations as maintain these spiritually
  ear-marked schools, though they can be stirred indeed to energetic action at
  election times in defence of their grip upon local teaching, are far too
  indifferent to the health or education of their children to keep their
  buildings in a good and going state. It would seem as though they cared less
  about having a school than about preventing the invasion of their lives by an
  open and vigorous and efficient school. They hate a clean and impartial
  education far more than they care for one upon their own lines. They are
  anti-educational far more than they are religious. One might fancy the
  fortunate Mumbo-Jumboites rejoicing in the special opportunities they have
  had in the last twenty years and still possess, and saying: "Now, under the
  happiest conditions possible, let us demonstrate and fix and establish for
  ever the delightful proofs of our great doctrines. Let us show the flatness
  of the earth and the inedible qualities of bread by bright and exquisite
  diagrams and models. Let us irradiate the place with all the happiness that
  the sedulous avoidance of the other sex in public can give. Let us make our
  schools an example to all schools with splendid buildings with new and
  abundant equipment, and with such teachers as only Mumbo-Jumboism can
  inspire." But there is not a hint of that spirit in these dismal places in
  which their religion has had a free hand. For two and twenty years religious
  denominations in England have had these twelve thousand schools upon which to
  demonstrate their qualities, and they have demonstrated that shabbiness,
  stuffiness, meanness, and low standards of performance follow upon doctrinal
  exclusiveness as surely as twilight leads into the night.</p>

  <h2><a id="art44"
     name="art44">THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF INDIA:<br>
  DIVORCE OR LEGAL SEPARATION</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">5.7.1924</p>

  <p class="first">Is the Anglo-Saxon fit to govern any other race? He sprawls
  across the earth. He rules hundreds of millions of brown and black and buff
  peoples; he dominates and "protects" an even larger number than he actually
  governs. And there are moments when one is struck by a sense of his immense
  ineptitude. In many respects he is unquestionably a fine figure, but with
  regard to other races he is overbearing, he is unsympathetic, he is obtuse.
  Possibly he is exceptionally so. But it is more probable that no race is fit
  to have the upper hand over any other race; the possession of the upper hand
  leads at best to an inconsiderate self-righteousness, and at the worst to an
  extreme contempt, injustice, and cruelty. There are very few instances in the
  world of an even moderately satisfactory alien rule.</p>

  <p>The Jesuits in South America seem to have done well in a kindly
  unprogressive way; the British rule in Nigeria and some of the West Indies is
  a comparatively bright spot in the history of racial interaction, the Maoris
  and the Basutos seem to be well-treated peoples, and the Dutch are credited
  with a fairly happy and prosperous Java. Until the last few years the British
  Empire seems to have dealt justly with its old allies, the Six Nations in
  Canada. These are outstanding exceptions. The general rule for peace between
  two races seems to be mix or get away; the darkest tragedy comes when, as in
  the southern United States, they can neither mix nor disentangle.</p>

  <p>In the great elaborately educated State of the future towards which human
  affairs are moving, everyone and every community will be most sedulously
  educated and trained in inter-racial good manners. Our world at present has
  scarcely such a thing yet as good manners in anyone or a fully educated man.
  All the more reason, then, for maintaining the separation of peoples unfit to
  associate generously and peacefully with each other, and for releasing those
  who are not already separated.</p>

  <p>The recent libel case brought by Sir Michael O'Dwyer against Sir Sankaran
  Nair has brought out very vividly the tremendous failure of the British
  Imperial system, after a century of opportunity, to produce any working
  tradition of interaction between the British people, the British garrison,
  and the Indian population. It has demonstrated the impossibility of any very
  long continuation of British rule in the peninsula.</p>

  <p>After one has looked into the particulars of the case, one has just the
  same depressing realisation of a hopeless incompatibility that one has in
  some matrimonial cases. It is not so much that this or that has been done or
  not done; it is that the two peoples are unequally yoked in temperament and
  intelligence; that they do not get on together; that they never will get on
  together while they are closely associated. The British are not good enough
  nor wise enough for the job; the Indians are not great enough nor patient
  enough. It is a case for a separation, as friendly and speedy a separation as
  possible, if there is not presently to be a tragic divorce.</p>

  <p>I must confess that I cannot conjure up any very profound indignation
  against General Dyer. He was, I think, stupid, spasmodically violent, and
  unnecessarily bloody. I do not believe that the shooting at Amritsar was
  inevitable, and he certainly went on shooting too long. But the sort of
  stupid and spasmodic violence he displayed is very characteristic of many
  English and many Americans. I find it in myself. I have not, luckily for
  myself, had General Dyer's opportunities, but it is not necessary to kill
  people to discover that one may be harsh and cruel when one is thwarted by
  mental processes one does not understand.</p>

  <p>I had a Dyer phase, for example, as a young, eager, and untrained
  schoolmaster, whipping-in the difficult stragglers for class work against
  which they rebelled. The whole story of the Punjab troubles is really a very
  pitiful story not only for the native population but for the British
  administrators. It is the story of a conflict of resentments. One begins with
  an officialdom eager for "volunteers" for the Great War, unable to understand
  that the Great War meant nothing and should have meant nothing to any
  reasonable Indian person. How could it matter to them? One goes on to a story
  of ''pressure" increasing in its ugly details until we come to thrashings,
  deep indignities, and tortures to stimulate the cheerful 'Volunteer."
  Pressure passes from chief to subordinate and degenerates towards cruelty at
  every transition; it is hard to fix responsibility at any point. It rouses
  resistance. The pestered and tormented populace begin to hold meetings, make
  vague gestures of counter violence. The irritable ass in the Anglo-Saxon
  make-up responds with "firmness." The firmness loads the rifles and prepares
  aeroplane bombs to disperse "dangerous assemblies."</p>

  <p>There is a mood of scared obstinacy in which the Anglo-Saxon becomes
  capable of almost any swift atrocity. He is rarely deliberately cruel, but he
  is easily clumsily and hotly cruel. In the twilight the highly strung
  creature will shoot or lynch at very slight provocation indeed. Confronted
  with the dead body, his self-respect demands an adequate reason for the
  murder he has done. So soon as the Amritsar gardens were littered with dead
  and dying people, it became clear to General Dyer that a very dangerous
  rebellion, a second Indian Mutiny, had been heroically nipped in the bud.</p>

  <p>His military superiors did not think so. He was rebuked and punished, very
  properly, very necessarily. Some amends were made to smitten and outraged
  India in that treatment of General Dyer, and the wretched incident of
  Amritsar would have passed into the receding perspectives of history if it
  had not been for the litigious enterprise of Sir Michael O'Dwyer. Sir C.
  Sankaran Nair, in a book that was extensively used by the British Government
  for propaganda purposes in India, wrote phrases that certainly put an
  unjustifiable blame upon Sir Michael O'Dwyer for the Punjab outrages. Sir
  Michael brought his action and reopened the question.</p>

  <p>Now the alarming and disconcerting thing is that the Court of King's Bench
  showed itself far less intelligent, far less alive to the realities of the
  Indian situation, than General Dyer's military superiors in India. It is
  impossible to read the reports of the case without realising that the mutual
  irritation of English and Indian, the profound temperamental incompatibility
  of the two worlds, was manifested in that Court in an exaggerated degree. The
  case transcended its proper limits and became a wrangle on the whole Punjab
  question. Mr. Justice McCardie took upon himself to inform the world at large
  and the people of India in particular, with all the weight and prestige of
  the High Court upon him, "speaking with due deliberation," that in his view
  General Dyer had been wrongly punished by the Secretary of State for
  India.</p>

  <p>The case of General Dyer was not before the Court. This announcement was a
  lawless outbreak on the part of Justice McCardie. How much due deliberation
  there was in Justice McCardie's utterance and how much instinctive passion
  may be judged by the fact that General Dyer does not seem to have been
  punished by the Secretary of State for India at all; his case did not come up
  to the Secretary of State for India; he was punished for his hasty excessive
  violence by his own proper military superiors in India. Internal dissension
  restrained the jury from inflicting excessive and exemplary damages upon Sir
  C. Sankaran Nair for his careless libel; the damages awarded amounted to five
  hundred pounds, but it will be very difficult, it will be impossible, to
  persuade the sore and sensitive, quick and resentful mind of India that
  Britain has not gone back upon even such clumsy and insufficient apologies
  and atonements as she had made for Amritsar and its associated sins.</p>

  <p>There comes a time in the relationships of nations and peoples, as in the
  relationships of partners and lovers and married couples, when offences
  become irrevocable. The breaking point seemed to have been reached by the
  British in India. The argument is practically over, the negotiations at an
  end. When in the opening stages of the Great War Ireland was bilked of Home
  Rule there remained nothing for it, between Britain and Ireland, but a
  practical separation. Englishmen like myself, who regard the present
  detachment of Ireland and England as excessive and regrettable, were
  entangled, in spite of themselves, in that offence; and we were helpless to
  avert its just and logical consequences. So now with India. It is a sort of
  treachery to Indians to go on talking liberally to them, to seek their
  friendship, to attempt co-operations, with Dyer's impenitent rifles reloaded
  and our Justice McCardies ready and eager to tear up our poor attempts to
  make amends.</p>

  <h2><a id="art45"
     name="art45">THE SPIRIT OF FASCISM:<br>
  IS THERE ANY GOOD IN IT AT ALL?</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">12.7.1924</p>

  <p class="first">During the last few weeks an extraordinary fuss has been
  made over the brutal murder of one of Signor Mussolini's most able and
  honourable opponents. Fascism has been put upon its defence. Weak but
  distinct sounds of disapproval have come from the more respectable sections
  of the Italian public. Even the London <i>Times</i> has published leading
  articles that seem to hint at a faint reluctant perception that the Italian
  dictator is remotely connected with the bloody and filthy terrorism on which
  his power rests.</p>

  <p>It is, I say, an extraordinary fuss, a remarkable and almost unaccountable
  outbreak of the public conscience of Europe. Because it is surely a matter of
  common knowledge that hundreds of people have been beaten and tortured to
  death by the Fascisti, that innumerable outrages of a peculiarly dirty kind
  have been committed, that arson, wreckage, and threats are the normal
  expedients of Italian political life, and that the power of Mussolini has
  been built up upon the organisation of such violence. These things have been
  going on for some years in Italy. Ambitious imitators have arisen in France
  and Germany and Britain. British "Crusaders" have gathered for the blessing
  of the Duke of York and strange young men in Oxford and Cambridge have braved
  misunderstanding by wearing badges bearing the challenging initials B. F.
  Young Italians in black shirts have even been allowed to insult the decent
  British dead by cocking snooks&mdash;or performing whatever the Fascist
  salutation is&mdash;holding out an arm and twiddling the fingers or something
  of that sort&mdash;at the Westminster Cenotaph. In America, however, there
  does not seem to be much of a Fascist movement. There has been no temptation
  for America, with the Ku Klux Klan in active operation and a long tradition
  of lynch law, to adopt the Italian model. But there have been many American
  expressions of sympathy with Fascism. And then in the full tide of sunny
  approval just one more little murder occurs&mdash;a murder not esentially
  different from many other Fascist murders&mdash;and the world wakes up to the
  infernal vileness of a thing that has been plainly before its eyes for
  years.</p>

  <p>There never was so remarkable a case of the camel bearing itself bravely
  up to the very moment of the last straw.</p>

  <p>To me this break back from Fascism is astonishing. I am inclined to think
  that Signor Mussolini found it so too. His prompt repudiation of the crime,
  his eager search for the body of his butchered antagonist, his sacrifice of
  valued cronies and close associates seem to show that his rich, emotional,
  rhetorical nature was very considerably scared. Nitti's house had been burnt
  and Nitti driven abroad. No one had protested, except perhaps Nitti. No
  apology to Nitti has been made by Mussolini, and no apology, no reparation
  for the stupid, malicious violence shown him, is likely to be made. And now,
  simply because Matteotti had been more difficult to handle and had got
  himself rather nastily killed, this uproar! It may be some time before the
  dictator is really comfortable again about the matter.</p>

  <p>I do not propose to speculate here whether the storm will blow itself out
  and leave Signor Mussolini still on his blood-stained pedestal doing his
  solemn gestures of good government before the world, or whether we are in
  sight of the beginning of the end of Fascism. What interests me most is the
  complex of motives that drives behind Fascism, Ku Klux Klanism, the British
  Crusaders, and all these romantic attempts to organise ultra-legal tyrannies.
  The destructive instinct that gives us all a pleasure in smashing plates is
  plainly there, the natural malice against the unlike or the disturbing is
  very powerfully present, and the craving to exercise power. The stuff is in
  all of us, almost ineradicably so. (It betrays itself in this article.) We
  repress these impulses to a very large extent largely out of a fear of our
  fellow creatures' reprisals. But by joining a great society with high and
  disinterested professions of purpose we can conspire with a certain number of
  our fellows for a common indulgence of this malignant drive, and we can get
  some protection from the consequences and establish a real sense of moral
  justification. Many of us who would never dare to stab a negro in the street
  because of his offensive contrast with ourselves, or even to push him off the
  sidewalk if we encountered him alone, can respond to the call for his
  lynching with a tremulous reassurance. Many an Italian employer who would not
  dare to face his workers in a crisis about wages will help burn up a Labour
  Party office with a stout heart.</p>

  <p>But it is claimed in the case of all these societies for intimidation and
  cruelty that the main motive is something higher and better than this. A
  state of danger, social indiscipline, and slackness is alleged; a failure of
  the normal processes of law and police. The cruelties and filthy outrages
  that are the normal activities of these organisations are declared to be the
  acts of strong men resolute to restore peace, justice, and confidence to a
  disordered world.</p>

  <p>There is something in this plea. It is not to be too lightly dismissed.
  The condition of Italy before the Fascista movement crystallised out was
  certainly very bad. The lawlessness of Italian life existed before the
  Fascists and will outlive them. After the war it expressed itself in terms of
  Communism; robbing took the name of expropriation, and the natural resentment
  of human beings at uninteresting and inferior work expressed itself in
  entirely-mischievous strikes. The manifest injustices of the social system
  were made the plea for a multitude of outrages that did nothing to remedy
  them. There have been Communist murders and Communist outrages in Italy,
  though nothing to parallel the extensive systematic terrorism of the Fascista
  regime. The difference between Communist and Fascist is mainly this, that one
  conspires and does mischief and cruelty to bring about a state of order and
  justice that cannot exist, and the other to defend and sustain one that
  exists only in his imagination.</p>

  <p>Moscow and Rome are alike in this, that they embody the rule of a minority
  conceited enough to believe that they have a clue to the tangled
  incoherencies of human life, and need only sufficiently terrorise criticism
  and opposition to achieve a general happiness. Violent revolution and violent
  reaction are two aspects of one asinine thing, violent uncritical conviction.
  Neither recognises the enormously tentative quality of human institutions,
  and the tangled and scarcely explored difficulties in the path of social
  reconstruction. But they feel these things they will not recognise, these
  tangles and possible complications, as perverse opposition, and their
  impatient souls rebel. Your party Communist, like your Fascist, is neither
  hero nor criminal; he is an ignorant, immodest, impatient fool who wants to
  grab the glory of inaugurating an epoch that cannot yet possibly begin. The
  great future of our race will owe little to either of these current
  nuisances. The maker of that future is the unconvenanted scientific man who
  works on without hurry and without delay, dissolving problem after problem in
  the solvent of clear knowledge, insisting on plain speech and free
  publication, refusing concealment, refusing to conspire and compel,
  respecting himself completely in his infinite respect for his fellow-men.</p>

  <p>At the present level of education in the world, progress is like pushing
  one's way through a riot. The underlying fact in all these matters is that
  the common uneducated man is a violent fool in social and public affairs. He
  can work in no way better than his quality. He has not sufficient
  understanding to work in any other way. If there were no Fascism there would
  be something else of the same sort. The hope of the world lies in a broader
  and altogether more powerful organisation of education. Only as that develops
  will the vehement self-righteous and malignant ass abate his mischief in the
  world.</p>

  <h2><a id="art46"
     name="art46">THE RACE CONFLICT:<br>
  IS IT UNAVOIDABLE?</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">19.7.1924</p>

  <p class="first">The action of the United States in setting aside its
  gentlemanly understanding with Japan in the matter of immigration and
  excluding the Japanese altogether has greatly exercised the British mind. At
  this distance it strikes us as an altogether uncivilised thing to do. We
  believe that for all practical purposes the peace of the Pacific rests on the
  tripod, America, Britain, Japan; we attached immense importance to the
  Washington Agreement and the feeling of concord it developed; we abandoned
  the Anglo-Japanese alliance to American feeling and, after a struggle at
  home, the threat of the Singapore developments was withdrawn. Our dominant
  idea was the collaboration, mutual trust, and mutual forbearance of three
  great civilised Powers. Then, apparently as a move in the dismal party game
  that still rules American political life, in order to secure California for
  the Republican Party, Japan is smacked on the face good and hard, and most of
  this difficult and elaborate work of reassurance is undone.</p>

  <p>It is not a question of excluding cheap labour or alien mass immigration;
  that has been fairly well done for some time. It is an intolerable assertion
  that individual educated Japanese are unfitted by-race and culture for
  helpful participation in the high civilisation of the Pacific Coast. It
  implies that Japanese and Americans are for ever incompatible, are for ever
  two peoples; that for ever on this little planet their destinies are to be
  worked out parallel or apart&mdash;or to mingle only in a bitter conflict for
  exclusive survival.</p>

  <p>These are immensely dangerous implications. It is impossible to believe
  that they express the real intelligence of the American public in this
  matter. But they do express a very widely diffused feeling, prevailing
  especially on the Pacific slope. That same reckless levity of the party
  politician, which in Britain in the "great days" of Gladstone and Disraeli,
  made the relations of Russia to Britain a mere party counter, has appealed to
  that feeling. We are forced to recognise that a great multitude of people in
  California and elsewhere are at a mental level from which it is possible to
  contemplate a future of pent-up races and cultures, each living in its own
  bit of the little planet and forcibly restrained from wandering or expanding
  beyond its boundaries.</p>

  <p>Is such a future possible for mankind? It was, one must admit, a dominant
  idea in the past. More's Utopia and most of the old Utopias were closed
  countries. Japan itself was a completely closed country for several
  centuries, and no one went into or came out of it. It was Americans who
  forced the closed door of Japan; they of all peoples have the least reason to
  complain of the Japanese spill-over into their world. But no country yet
  tolerates the free movement of peoples. Yet the secular force of human
  inventiveness fights against this system of pen and barrier.</p>

  <p>Our States, our boundaries become intolerably small to the new methods of
  communication, to the broadening general intelligence. Our economic lives, in
  spite of tariffs and the most strenuous resistance, spread out to the ends of
  the earth. Financially the world is one. No peoples on the earth travel and
  migrate more widely, or would suffer more acutely in mind and spirit from the
  complete restriction of international movement than the British and
  Americans&mdash;the Americans even more now than the British. But we cannot
  go thrusting our white faces into the markets of Timbuctoo, the bazaars of
  Central Asia, and the temples of Osaka, if we refuse to see brown and black
  and yellow in the street cars of Chicago and London. There is a plain
  antagonism of ideals here, between a venerable parochial and a new planetary
  mind. Is it not time for us to sort out our ideas in these matters a little
  more exactly?</p>

  <p>Opinion lies between the absolute exclusionist and the free mixer. Most of
  us find ourselves somewhere intermediate between these extremes. The case of
  the exclusionists is based on just these increasing facilities of
  communication which make others think that at any cost the world must become
  one united system. This quicker and closer intercourse is intensifying racial
  clash. It was all very well when only a few foreigners could travel with
  difficulty to one's country, but now they come in multitudes, they come to
  settle, they congest in lumps too solid for assimilation. It is necessary,
  says the exclusionist, to make the barriers higher and stronger. Yet is this
  more than a temporary arrest of racial conflict in a world where finance is
  world-wide and every people has a need, a necessity for the produce of lands
  unacceptable to it? In a world, too, of increasing hygienic knowledge, in
  which populations tend to increase and overflow? Is it anything more than the
  opening phase of a development of an antagonism whose natural end is war?</p>

  <p>It seems to me that the forces that make for material world unification,
  the forces of invention and enlightenment, are now so great, various and
  subtle that they cannot be defeated. They may be delayed, but in the end they
  will be stronger than any exclusionist localism. The practical question
  before mankind is how w^e are to react to these forces; and the practical
  alternatives are either a vast cycle of wars and race conflicts, race riots,
  tyrannies of secret societies, struggles for ascendancy ending perhaps after
  many centuries of tragedy and wasted opportunity in the complete triumph of
  some specific culture, or a deliberate attempt to minimise race hostility,
  devise fair methods of co-operation and work out a mixed and various world
  society with a code of mutual tolerance and service for the common good.</p>

  <p>This is not to be done by ignoring race and racial differences; the
  natural thought forms, and dispositions and instinctive reactions of northern
  Europeans and Jews, negroes and whites, Indians and Chinese, vary subtly and
  profoundly; you can no more ignore differences of race than differences of
  sex. They are things greatly intensified and supplemented by differences of
  tradition, training, and conditions, but when all such modifications are
  eliminated, essential differences remain. Intermarriage provides no remedy
  but rather a multiplication of types. But a well-directed education can at
  least restrain a passionate exaggeration of these differences and prevent the
  antagonisms that arise out of their recognition. Man is by nature a fierce
  resentful being of excessive desires and facile prejudices, and no society
  has ever existed or could ever exist without some sort of educational
  adaptation of this natural savage, some schooling and toning down of his
  hostile impulses. But the educational necessities of the small and limited
  past are as nothing to the educational necessities of the present time. If
  races are to be brought together, and not merely jumbled together or still
  more dangerously held apart, an educational effort has to be made on an
  altogether unprecedented scale.</p>

  <p>An educational effort on an altogether unprecedented scale; that, I take
  it, is the only way of escape from the chancy, disorderly, restricted, and
  tragic life men are living now. The question of race, like every other great
  question in human affairs so soon as we follow it up, leads us to the
  school&mdash;no! it does not bring us to the school as we know it, but to the
  site of the school, the crying blank for a school that has yet to be. Get on
  with a school and college system commensurate with the enormous needs and
  dangers of this new age of world communication, or blunder and suffer. Teach
  everyone born into the world the history of mankind, the significance of
  racial differences, expand every individual imagination to the conception of
  the racial life as a great adventure, and to some sense of what it may
  achieve in the days to come. Replace the suspicious conservatism of ignorance
  by the curiosity and generosity of wide vision. These are enormous demands.
  No community has yet spread more than the thinnest veneer of teaching over
  its whole population. But the alternative to doing so is to have the
  machinery and methods of the new age used to arm and intensify the passions
  of the old. A world no better educated than this will never be very much
  better than this; it will be a world of race mobs and lynchings, of pogroms
  and race brigandage, of furious struggles for disputed territories, and wars
  and wars and wars. If they continue upon the present lines of narrow
  patriotism, of race pressure and race exclusion, I do not see how a war
  between Japan and the United States can be avoided for very many years. And
  until they have made a great educational effort I do not see how they can get
  away from their present lines of action.</p>

  <h2><a id="art47"
     name="art47">THE SCHOOLS OF A NEW AGE: A FORECAST</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">26.7.1924</p>

  <p class="first">In these articles I have been harping continuously on the
  vast disorder, the uncertainty and waste of the world spectacle to-day; and I
  have been clamouring for more education, for much more education, for a more
  strenuous and devoted educational effort.</p>

  <p>Comments and replies, a quite copious correspondence, have brought home to
  me two things very plainly. One is the deep resentment aroused in many minds
  by the statement of what is to me an obvious fact, the littleness,
  imperfection and unsatisfactoriness and transitoriness of all contemporary
  life. Manifestly, they think Fifth Avenue in a state of traffic congestion.
  Ascot week, charity balls, Pahn Beach, the opening of Parliament, the movie
  industry, and an American Presidential election are all right. Or at least
  right enough to live with pleasantly.</p>

  <p>They think me a dismal and cantankerous hunks for wanting, as I seem to
  them to do, to shatter and reconstruct a world which sustains such delightful
  things. They do not realise that this world is being shattered anyhow, and
  will not be reconstructed by any automatic process. They want this world left
  as it is and not "messed about with" by innovating people. They have a will
  to be satisfied, an obstinate will for contentment. Mixed up with that, and
  probably fundamental to it, is a profound disbelief in the power of men
  willfully to alter their conditions and determine their collective fate.</p>

  <p>Now if I have any claim to distinction among journalists it is that I do
  not share that widespread scepticism and fatalism. I do not let the fact that
  some of us, myself included, are having an undeservedly good time hide the
  fact that the system, such as it is, is wasteful, that it cripples the
  possibilities of nearly everyone, and is, to millions of people, actively
  distressful and cruel.</p>

  <p>I belong to a small but growing minority which believes that man has come
  to such a phase of knowledge and power that he is already able and may very
  soon be willing to put a bit between the teeth of the monster of wild change
  that is now trampling this world. We believe that human society could be and
  presently will be deliberately reconstructed more boldly, more elaborately,
  and with more definite intention, upon a scale commensurate with the
  greatness of modern mechanism and to an extent that will enable it to
  anticipate and discipline what are now the incalculable forces of change. And
  our faith is that the way to this expansion of life, this release from
  chance, lies through Universities and schools, through a universal education
  of the entire population of the world and through a universal and sustained
  thought process keeping pace with ever-changing necessities.</p>

  <p>We are all democratic Socialists in so far as we regard it as the general
  concern to maintain order and law, to secure the common needs of everyone by
  carrying on the exploitation of natural wealth and the production and
  distribution of staple necessities for the universal and not for particular
  profit, and to provide education and health services for all; but we are
  aristocratic individualists in demanding world-wide freedom of movement for
  all, the utmost scope for self-realisation, and the freest utterance and
  hearing for every creative and innovating spirit&mdash;for everyone indeed
  who may possibly be creative. We see, as the only way to the sort of human
  life we desire, an immense development of the reorganisation of every sort of
  research and of the whole educational system of the world,</p>

  <p>A rough parallelism of things mechanical and things mental will put the
  case as we see it. In the last two centuries the means of transport has
  developed from the stage coach and sailing ship to the automobile, express
  train, great liner, and aeroplane; there has been much more than a tenfold
  increase in speed and a corresponding increase in security, versatility, and
  comfort. Our mechanical power and mechanical productivity have increased in
  far greater proportion. There has been an educational advance also, but it
  has not kept pace with this.</p>

  <p>More people in the country are educated now, certain elements of
  education, reading and writing, have been spread very widely, but the
  education of a fully educated man is not conspicuously better than it was two
  hundred years ago, and education has not spread, as railways and factories
  have spread from the Atlantic countries, all over the earth.</p>

  <p>We believe that we are now in the dawn of a phase of educational thrust,
  corresponding to the mechanical thrust of a century ago. That former thrust
  redistributed the population of every country it affected, created new towns,
  altered the build and lay-out of every town it touched, created new suburban
  systems, and revolutionised the visible aspect of life. The new thrust will
  reconstruct the scattered and confused mental life of the age, will create
  mental nuclei everywhere, link up the whole countryside to new and more
  powerful mental centres. I doubt whether at present, apart from school
  children, one person in a hundred in either Europe or America could be
  described as a mental worker; we foretell a time when something like one in
  eight or one in five will be definitely employed in work that is primarily
  mental, either as student, as teacher, as scientific investigator, as artist
  or writer.</p>

  <p>In every village there will be a school, a reading-room, a theatre,
  closely associated with the health service and recreation of the place. It
  will be the central architectural fact of the place, the group of buildings
  about which the homes will cluster. In every town there will be the district
  schools and the great high school, the art studios, the theatres, the
  laboratories. Every considerable town will have a University as its chief
  expression and its crowning glory. The agricultural and industrial life of
  the land will be closely linked to the technical research of the colleges;
  they will go thither for advice and direction. The business and financial
  system will no longer be secret and private, a system of competitive
  conspiracies, but it will be working in close touch with the general
  scientific life; the banker will be a professor of economics, the iron-
  master will be a metallurgist. That is the order of the world we desire, and
  which we foresee through our hopes. That is the world that will replace the
  system of stampedes, scrambles, riots, and traffic jams in which we live to-
  day.</p>

  <h2><a id="art48"
     name="art48">THE IMPUDENCE OF FLAGS:<br>
  OUR POWER RESOURCES AND<br>
  MY ELEPHANTS, WHALES, AND GORILLAS</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">2.8.1924</p>

  <p class="first">The British Empire Exhibition at Wembley is open to all
  sorts of criticism, and is occasionally quite absurd, but it contrives to be
  entertaining. Many of us dislike the Kipling quality and the strong,
  unpleasant flavour of Imperial Preference that hang about it. I have reviled
  its commercialism; its relative disregard of educational duties and
  responsibilities; its suggestion of imperial self-sufficiency. But all sorts
  of conferences are meeting at Wembley, and occasionally a strong breath of
  human common sense dispels for a time the stuffy, foggy conceit of our recent
  and transitory Empire. Wembley, in spite of itself, becomes international and
  contributes to the project of a new world.</p>

  <p>The British Electrical and Associated Trades have been holding a most
  enlightening and hopeful conference on the power resources of the
  world&mdash;not of the Empire, be it noted, but of the world. Prominent among
  the speakers at the opening were the secretary of the United States Federal
  Power Commission, the president of the Italian Electrical Committee, and
  other "outsiders." A real attempt to see the world as one economic whole has
  been made. A frank admission of the need for organised world unity and world
  co-operation underlies the activities of this particular gathering.</p>

  <p>The President of the Conference was the Prince of Wales. lie made a very
  remarkable speech. Three or four years ago I made a number of people
  extremely indignant by criticising the world tour of the Prince. I complained
  that his speeches and proceedings seemed to ignore the world situation and to
  intensify the imperialist egotism of the narrower sort of English throughout
  the world. He did seem to me then to be behaving as so many Army and Indian
  Civil Service people and so forth still behave, as if the British Empire was
  a clique of Anglican communities aloof from the common interests of
  mankind.</p>

  <p>Quite a number of worthy persons seemed to think that a typical common
  Englishman like myself had no right to pass a judgment upon a young man, a
  quarter of a century his junior, simply because that young man happened to be
  the Heir Apparent. They wanted him to be treated as divine, above politics.
  But that sort of thing is not in the English tradition. The British Royal
  Family is not divine; it cannot keep out of politics if it is to function at
  all, because it has constantly to speak and act for the Empire as a whole;
  and it is a matter of very great importance that the Prince should show
  himself as he has now shown himself, growing in political wisdom and sensible
  of the wider vision of human unity that opens before mankind. Here, for
  example, is a sentence from his speech in which he sinks the Prince
  altogether, lost in that much nobler thing, the creative citizen of the
  world:</p>

  <p>"Finance, science and research are universal, but the utilisation of the
  results derived from these activities is not universal, and in this disparity
  lies one of the greatest obstacles to progress."</p>

  <p>And again: "You have before you. in the reports submitted to the World
  Power Conference, the raw material for a survey of the power resources of the
  world; you can now explore many countries which have hitherto been veiled in
  mystery, and assess at their true value the possibilities of an immense
  industrial development in many of them; you may, from this material, erect
  the structure which will go beyond the confines of one country, or group of
  countries, and include all those parts of the world where man can hope to
  prosper. International cooperation may emerge from the realm of the ideal
  into the realm of practical utilisation as the result of your deliberations,
  and I sincerely trust that full success will attend them."</p>

  <p>I doubt if any royal personage has ever so distinctly repudiated that
  narrow particularism to the realm, to which royalty is supposed to be
  distinctly pledged. This is hoisting the flag of the world-State over all the
  Imperial flags that wave from the Wembley buildings as plainly and frankly
  as, considering all things, it can be done&mdash;at Wembley.</p>

  <p>In very many ways the last half-year has been a year of mental and moral
  recovery in Europe. A year ago, when one wrote of nationalism as a dangerous
  and dividing sentiment, of national sovereignty as a nuisance, of the pre-
  emption of this or that area of the world's surface and of this or that
  supply of necessary national material in the interests of the exploiters
  under this or that flag as a method of crippling and wasting the whole
  economic life of mankind, one felt that one was writing and thinking in an
  almost hopeless minority. All the world seemed to have gone nationalist and
  exclusive. One felt one shouted to an entirely inattentive preoccupied crowd
  under a stormy sky against which nothing was bright but the national and
  Imperial flags. Flags were supreme. Now it is as if the sun of reason shone
  everywhere, and the sundering flags visibly droop in that sunlight.</p>

  <p>There are moments when it would seem that after all man is a reasonable
  creature. The accumulation of considerations that is now plainly driving men,
  in spite of ancient traditions and prejudices, towards an organised
  cosmopolitanism is very great. These considerations come in on us from all
  sides. While one is refusing to be anything but an isolated patriot on this
  count, one is being undermined almost unawares upon another. Many of us who
  will hear of no super-Government to save us from war, nor of any properly
  equipped and provided super-Court to settle international disputes, find
  ourselves presently confronted by the problem of epidemics and consenting to
  the idea of supernational controls from the health point of view. The postal
  union, which the Great War strained but has not destroyed, is after all only
  the thin framework of a much more comprehensive union of communications. When
  I read the speech of the Prince of Wales at the World Power Conference I was
  at once reminded of the preachings and efforts of that wonderful old man,
  David Lubin, the Israelite who set up the International Institute of
  Agriculture. The chief objective of this "Institute" was a contemporary
  survey with a view to a proper distribution of the world's staple
  productions. Shortages were to be anticipated and headed off; over-production
  was to be restrained. And arising out of this main idea was Lubin's secondary
  project, the placing of all the shipping of the world and all the great
  international railway lines&mdash;he lived before air transport seemed a
  probability&mdash;under one world authority which would fix freights as we
  fix postal charges. This Power Conference has been talking pure Lubinism
  about the world distribution of power.</p>

  <p>I suppose it is because I had a biological training that I find one of the
  most attractive arguments for world unity, and the suppression of
  flag-worship, in the need of protecting whales from ourselves and ourselves
  from bacteria. The dwindling world fauna of this planet is in urgent need of
  international game laws and a supernational game-keeper. Species of whales
  are being exterminated because the ocean is no man's land, and if one State
  restrains its whalers from excessive wasteful slaughter they can shelter
  their activities beneath some less scrupulous flag. Diseases cannot be
  stamped out of the world by systematic sanitation while one affected Power
  sees fit to exercise its sovereign right to remain filthy. And any species of
  birds or beasts that lives under a careless flag may be exterminated by the
  sportsman and on one have a right to protest. The gorilla, they say, is going
  fast, and the African elephant. These marvels of life, these strange and
  wonderful beings of whose vitality and unpulses we know so little, are being
  killed because they are insufficiently protected. Their chief slaughterers
  are patriotic collectors, and the fewer the survivors the hotter is the
  competition for specimens to adorn their beastly national collections. Yet
  the gorilla belongs not to the flag that claims its habitat but to all
  mankind. It belongs to me, to any man in Canada or in Texas, as much as it
  does to any West African or any Belgian. But there is no world control to
  protect these grotesque and marvellous creatures for us and for our
  children's children. They will go&mdash;one more vivid item in the vast
  wastage of animal, vegetable and mineral wealth that the scrambling
  insufficiency of mere flag rule involves. For them and for a thousand vital
  treasures the world government may come too late. Yet that it is coming
  rapidly and surely, the words and the spirit of the discourse of the Prince
  of Wales, in that very temple of British Imperial exclusiveness, the Wembley
  Empire Exhibition, bear witness. Wembley was to have inaugurated Imperial
  Preference, but it is really Imperial Preference lying in state. I wonder how
  many years it will be before we have a World Exhibition to bring home to us
  the need for free trade, free speech, and free movement everywhere under
  unified world controls.</p>

  <h2><a id="art49"
     name="art49">HAS COMMUNISM A FUTURE?<br>
  THE POSSIBILITY OF A SOCIALIST RENASCENCE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">9.8.1924</p>

  <p class="first">I HAVE a real affection for Communists&mdash;and a temperate
  admiration. It is the sort of love that leaps forward to chasten. In a world
  of oafish self-complacencies set in a morass of dull submission to the
  chances of life it is a consolation and refreshment to find any people who
  realise the self- destructiveness of the present system and, however vaguely,
  the possibility of remaking human society upon richer and happier lines. The
  value of the Communist Party as an organised ferment is very high. I should
  like to see a properly accredited representative of the party free to air his
  opinions in every high school and college&mdash;particularly in the United
  States. Everybody in the place would be the brighter and better for his
  beneficent irritation.</p>

  <p>The House of Lords entertains its leisure by passing Bills to suppress
  Communist Sunday Schools, and the Archbishop of Canterbury speaks in tones of
  horror of the teachings in these establishments. Nothing could witness more
  effectively to the wholesome mental stir these schools create. Most of the
  teaching in Anglican Sunday Schools is equally repulsive to me, but so long
  as they do not raid the public funds for their support I do not see why they
  should not teach what they like. I am English, not Anglican. My blood and
  traditions incline me to the utmost free speech and free teaching and free
  propaganda for everyone. No one is obliged to send his children to a
  Communist School, and I do not see why the half truth of Anglicanism should
  not have to face the half truth of Communism. The founder of Christianity
  talked a lot of Communism, but I cannot recall a solitary phrase of His to
  justify the existence of the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

  <p>Yet at the same time I am doubtful whether there is much of a future for
  the Communist Party. I doubt whether in twenty-five years' time there will be
  many Communists, under that name, below middle-age. A few nice, fierce old
  gentlemen will survive in smoking-rooms and cafes. The Communist movement is
  a part of the present world, it is a shadow cast by existing economic
  absurdities, it is a current reaction. In five-and-twenty years' time the
  projects of a scientific Socialism will have converted and absorbed most of
  the youthful enthusiasm and resentful energy that now finds its expression in
  Communism. Communism is a phase, a bitter and sterile experiment, in the
  development of the Socialist idea. Socialism is its parent and its heir. The
  movement for the organised exploitation of the whole world in the collective
  interest existed before the Communist Party, and will be going on long after
  that party is a quaint tradition.</p>

  <p>At present the Communist Party still dominates the government of Russia.
  But it does so at the sacrifice of all its constructive claims. In seven
  years the Russian experiment has demonstrated the intellectual sterility of
  the movement beyond any further dispute.</p>

  <p>The Bolshevik Government came to power in a state of ignorant confidence,
  treating criticisms as a blasphemous reflection on its omniscience, insulting
  and persecuting every sort of Socialist outside its trained and disciplined
  ranks. The Government took over factories, uncertain whether it meant to run
  them under a quasi-military discipline or on guild lines as free communities
  of workers; it "smashed" money, and discovered it had no other way of
  computing the mutual services and obligations of men. It was touching to see
  Lenin in the Kremlin in 1920 struggling with childish projects for the
  "electrification of Russia" and unable to explain what sort of town centre,
  if any, his Communist Russia would possess. He had no working ideas that were
  worth a rap about this very obvious matter. I left him, sympathetic with him
  in the face of his stupendous task, but a little amazed at his extreme
  unpreparedness. However, if one may trust a virulent article by Trotsky that
  has just been published in English, he lost his temper in true Communist
  fashion at being asked awkward questions and resorted to Trotsky for comfort.
  "Ugh!" said Lenin. "What a perfect petit bourgeois!" and so restored the
  mental calmity entirely respectful scepticism had ruffled. For in Communist
  circles if you can call anyone or anything "bourgeois," the question is
  settled and discussion is at an end.</p>

  <p>The emptiness of plan, the extreme assurance, which distinguishes modern
  Communism is the secret alike of its attractiveness in times of social
  trouble and its futility in constructive effort. It does not worry the
  oppressed, the discontented, and the unhappy with difficult projects for
  human readjustment. It lumps together the complex and various disorders of
  social life, the muddle of human prejudices and impulses, as one malignant
  thing, the "Capitalist system." Destroy this legendary monster and the
  Millennium will ensue. Instead of overcoming the fool in Everyman, you must
  obstruct, waste, sabotage all the current services of the community. Having
  convinced the world that nothing else will work, the dictatorship of the
  party will ensue. There could be no teaching more successful in a mass
  meeting and less useful in a bureau. It gives all the excitement and release
  of a revolution with none of its tiresome responsibilities.</p>

  <p>It was Marx who created modern Communism. It is the sterile mule of
  Socialism and a scientific ambition. Socialism from the days of Robert Owen
  onward was a thing of schemes and projects. It was perpetually seeking better
  arrangements. Its methods were Utopian. But Marx was bitten by an ambition to
  rival Darwin; he was to be the Darwin of social and political science, with
  none of Darwin's modesty or Darwin's intellectual patience. He had the mind
  of a theologian with the pretension of a scientific inquirer, and he had the
  dull man's hatred and contempt for the human imagination. His movement was to
  be "scientific" with all the magic that word carried half a century ago.
  There was to be nothing imaginative and no confounded ideals. It was all to
  be fatalistic. It was never going to plan what would happen because it was
  going to know what would happen. He and his associates produced a very sound
  and ample analysis of the processes of decay in the business life of the
  time, but with such ambitions and such repudiations they could produce no
  scheme of any replacement system. They have no scheme to this day. Even
  Russia has not taught the Communist the practical need of Utopias.</p>

  <p>At a certain level of intelligence party Communism is a very attractive
  teaching indeed. Its self-assurance is very reassuring. Any human being not
  absolutely stupid hates to be robbed of freedom and educational opportunity
  before thirteen or fourteen and thrust into uncongenial and hopeless toil.
  Most employment is bitter for young people. At the same time people whose
  education is truncated so soon usually fail to develop sufficient
  intellectual power to understand complex industrial and financial processes.
  They develop an inferiority complex about such things that clamours in them
  for comfort.</p>

  <p>Communism embodies that hate and provides that comfort. It points to the
  "Capitalist" as the oppressor and claims to furnish in a few phrases all that
  needs to be known. In a social system that educated everyone to sixteen or
  eighteen and then gave a fair wide choice of public service there would be
  none of that hate and that defensive aggressiveness, that suppressed
  suspicion of ignorance and inefficiency that makes Communist controversy so
  loud and rude, which has made Mr. Trotsky so loud and rude. The marshes in
  which the cantankerous spirit of Communism grows would be drained and
  evaporated. By the theory of Marx it was in the highly developed industrial
  system of Western Europe, and particularly in Great Britain, that the
  Communist Revolution would first occur. The disconcerting fact for Communists
  is that it occurred in Russia, where the industrial organisation was at a low
  level and there were eighty per cent, of illiterates. In Great Britain nobody
  except the enterprising people who want to raise money from imbecile dukes
  and rich old ladies even pretends to be afraid of a Communist Revolution.</p>

  <p>There is a considerable dread of Communist activities in America. That is
  very largely due to an uneasy conscience, aware of a great mass of
  unassimilated immigrant labour very unfairly treated and very inadequately
  educated. There may be some grounds for such apprehensions; I will confess I
  do not think the present schools and colleges of America good enough and
  strong enough for the constructive work they ought to do. There may be a
  future for Communism there, and there will probably be a big movement towards
  Communism in the industrial centres of India and China and Japan. But in
  Europe I think that the Communist drive has passed its maximum and that the
  popular mind is moving onward to a more constructive and hopeful type of
  Socialism.</p>

  <p>Just as art in a phase of extreme sterility escaped by going back behind
  Raphael and starting afresh from the Pre-Raphaelite phase, so I think
  Socialism will soon be getting behind the unfortunate misdirection of Marx
  and Engels to become once more Utopian and fruitful.</p>

  <h2><a id="art50"
     name="art50">THE LITTLE HOUSE:<br>
  AS IT WAS, IS NOW, AND APPARENTLY EVER WILL BE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">16.8.1924</p>

  <p class="first">What a very odd spectacle the British Parliament face to
  face with the housing problem is! On the strength of that issue alone I
  should imagine that any really civilised judgment would condemn the poor old
  institution at once and set about a revolutionary search for a better
  constructed instrument of government.</p>

  <p>There is a shortage of housing accommodation in Great Britain; the
  picturesque, creeper-clad country cottage is too often a cramped,
  decivilising, insanitary fraud, and most of the industrial population lives
  in slums worse than the corresponding slums in America and little better than
  those on the Continent of Europe. You cannot get a house or flat in which a
  civilised family can live for much less than a hundred pounds a year rent,
  and most of those available at that price are stereotyped and dull-looking,
  and sometimes detestably ugly. Below that level comes a descending series of
  inconvenient, unsound, and unpleasant lodgments for the mass of the
  population. The Labour Ministry of Health has been making large encouraging
  gestures of help, it has projected big and complicated bargains with the
  building trades and the building trades unions that may&mdash;if all goes
  well&mdash;provide at an immense cost on a quasi-charity basis, at the public
  expense, a sufficiency of houses for the poorer sort of people of fifty years
  hence, according to the ideas of comfort and decency prevailing fifty years
  ago.</p>

  <p>The Government and the local authorities are to pay about half the cost of
  building a multitude of houses, the assistance being given on the sole
  condition that they fall below a certain standard of size and comfort, and
  the industrial employer will be able to pay low wages in proportion to the
  cheapness attained. In other words, the Labour Government is doing a deal
  with the building trade in the interest of the low-grade employer and is
  putting British industry "on the rates." They are returning by a circuitous
  route to the condition of things in England before the New Poor Law, when
  farmers grew rich by employing labour in receipt of outdoor relief, at
  otherwise impossibly low wages.</p>

  <p>The most striking thing about these housing proposals is the tacit
  acceptance by all parties in Parliament that the population of the coming
  years must be put away, each family in a little separate house of its own. If
  anything was needed to prove that the Socialism of the Labour Party was
  merely skin deep and its creative intentions an electioneering bid, it would
  be this. If one thing is clearer than another in the outlook of the modern
  community, it is the impossibility of the small separate house. It is a cage
  of needless toil for women; it is a place of deprivation and hardship for
  children. The whole drift of things is in favour of the highly organised
  block building containing a great number of houses. In this there can be
  electric light, radiators, a supply of hot and cold water, efficient sanitary
  accommodation, group wash-houses, adequate cupboards, and convenient shopping
  facilities, all provided at a less cost than is needed for the same number of
  scattered low-grade homes, each under its separate roof, with lamps to clean,
  fires to light, water to boil, and every possible demand for feminine
  drudgery and servitude.</p>

  <p>In their dreams people think of Mr. Wheatley's projected houses as little
  flower-girdled cottages, each with a bright little garden and a drying-ground
  and an uncontrolled multitude of children playing in the sun; in reality we
  shall get rows and rows of mean little boxes on the outskirts of our towns,
  jammed together into slums, each fouling the air with a separate chimney, and
  remote from every modern amenity.</p>

  <p>At present a large part of the population of East London lives in small
  houses of two stories, or two stories and a basement. Idiotic foreign
  visitors surveying this from train windows remark on the Englishman's superb
  individualism, so that every man's house is his castle. In the East End no
  man's house is his castle; every floor, and often every room, is a separate
  household, and sometimes these households entertain lodgers. This state of
  affairs the new Labour legislation will extend and perpetuate. Yet plans have
  been made that show beyond dispute that the whole population of industrial
  London could be rehoused in fine and handsome apartment buildings, with night
  and day lifts, roof-gardens, and nearly all the light, air. and conveniences
  to be found in a Kensington flat, at hardly greater cost than would be needed
  to choke all the ways out of London with a corresponding spread of Wheatley
  hovels, and so great an amount of space could be saved by doing so that half
  that area of London could be made into a playground and garden.</p>

  <p>But even to entertain schemes of that sort requires imagination, and the
  new Labour Government has shown itself the least imaginative of Governments.
  It has excreted or suppressed all its creative elements. It is a
  class-Government, and it embodies the subdued mind of the common
  wages-earner. Whatever is, it accepts, from Court costume to slums. Its idea
  of life is the life of the back street in which it has always lived, and it
  wants more back streets and cheaper back streets to live in, with an
  occasional treat in the garden of Buckingham Palace. In dealing with housing,
  just as in dealing with mines or with transport, it shows itself incapable of
  any breadth or power of initiative.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable aspects of this housing legislation is the
  ineffectiveness of the women. When women were struggling for the vote the
  world was given to understand that their success would be an end to "man-made
  laws" and "man-made" ways of living. There was to be an astonishing release
  of the sensible, practical feminine mind. Well, here is a question that
  concerns women primarily. A very large proportion of the girls and women of
  to-day, before their lives are out, will have to live either in the slums
  that the Labour Government is failing to reorganise, or in the rows and
  clumps of boxes of brick or timber that are to be spread out over the
  outskirts of every centre of population. There was nothing to prevent the
  distinguished women of the Labour Party from giving these men who are
  framing-up these schemes to build pauper houses and endow the building trade
  at the public expense a lead towards better things. These houses of the
  Wheatley project mean an effectual subjugation of great multitudes of women
  to dingy drudgery for scores of years to come; they mean the growth of a new
  generation of children with miserable standards of comfort and freedom. But
  so far we have had no guidance from intelligent women at all, but only
  speeches from such mere party supporters as Dr. Marion Phillips sustaining
  the preposterous pretensions of Mr. Wheatley. The Women's Housing Councils'
  National Federation, with its resolutions for the glorification of Mr.
  Wheatley's building ramp, does no more than emphasise the general feminine
  apathy. Generally, the women of the country seem not to be awake to the
  manner in which this business concerns them.</p>

  <p>Only one exception occurs to me at the present moment in the widespread
  indifference of intelligent and influential women to the comfort and outlook
  of the mass of their sex, and that is Mrs. Leonora Eyles, the novelist. Her
  book, The Woman in the Little House, is a most intelligent, sympathetic, and
  illuminating account of what it means to live in just such little houses as
  Mr. Wheatley and his friends, the employers and employed of the building
  trade, are conspiring to stereotype. She describes not slum life but the life
  of an ordinary working man's wife in London, without exaggeration and without
  extenuation. It is a picture of extreme dinginess and meanness, relieved only
  by the pluck and devotion and hopefulness and cheerful humour that enable
  these people to hang on and hope for better things. It is this sort of life
  the Wheatley legislation proposes to extend and perpetuate, because in
  Britain, as everywhere in the world, political life is divorced from the
  creative imagination, and because the mass of common men and women in the
  world do not know how much they may reasonably ask for from those who have
  access to the science and control of the resources of the world.</p>

  <h2><a id="art51"
     name="art51">THE TRIVIALITY OF DEMOCRACY<br>
  AND THE FEMININE INFLUENCE IN POLITICS</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">23.8.1924</p>

  <p class="first">The other day I was discussing the political outlook in
  Great Britain with a very close and shrewd observer of political motives. I
  live very much in a dream of a saner world and he lives in active reaction to
  the passing hour, but we both knew most of the leading figures in public
  affairs and we were surveying the present extraordinary fragmentation of
  parties in Parliament&mdash;for even the Labour Party now is hardly on
  speaking terms with itself and has nothing but office to hold it together.
  His thoughts ran much more on personalities than mine did. Was Mr. Asquith
  played out? Would Lloyd George "come back"? What was the future of Lord
  Birkenhead? Would Mr. Baldwin ever be brighter and better? Was Mr. Masterman
  the resuscitated hope of the Liberal Party? Was there anyone of any promise
  at all in the Labour Party? And so on.</p>

  <p>Unlike my friend, I do not go about culling incompatible posies of
  politicians. I have no interest in gathering together a marketable bunch. The
  failure of party government, the dissolution of all British parties, cheers
  and pleases me. Great Britain, I said, would have to lead the way to a new
  stage of democratic government and get itself a Legislature of a more
  manageable size, elected by Proportional Representation.</p>

  <p>"They won't," said my friend, meaning by "they" our bright-eyed millions
  of voters. "They can't grasp ideas like that&mdash;new, difficult ideas. It
  takes ten minutes' attention to understand Proportional Representation. You
  can't go to the country with a thing like that."</p>

  <p>"But unless we get a more efficient Legislature, how can we tackle our
  difficulties with money, with Europe, with India?"</p>

  <p>"We don't tackle difficulties," said my friend; "Parliaments can't."</p>

  <p>"Most of the Labour Party promised to support Proportional Representation
  at the last election."</p>

  <p>"And ran away from it. There was a tuppenny-ha'penny advantage in cheating
  on that, so of course they cheated. They'll run away from everything except
  office. They're just a lot of poor things who've spent too much money on
  Court clothes and in dressing up their wives and daughters fit and proper for
  the Garden Parties, and they want to get the wear out of it all before they
  go back into the shadows. Nobody in Parliament who isn't conspicuous is going
  to let Parliament be altered so that it excludes second-rate people. It's
  against nature. You might as soon expect Congress to scrap the American
  Constitution. You'll never live to see a General Election in England or
  America that isn't fought on thoroughly silly lines&mdash;on the old
  electoral method."</p>

  <p>"But think of the tasks that lie before the world!" "What's the good of
  thinking of them?" asked my friend. "It only worries you."</p>

  <p>"There has to be an organisation of international affairs to prevent war,
  there has to be disarmament with security, world transport at standard
  charges, the re-establishment of a workable world currency, the development
  of education throughout the world "</p>

  <p>"Things like that aren't going to be done by Parliament," said my friend.
  "They may be done behind the backs of the politicians&mdash;if there are
  interests and intelligences big enough to want them and organise them, but
  have you ever met the average voter?"</p>

  <p>"I know, I suppose, as many people as you do."</p>

  <p>"But your head's in the clouds...."</p>

  <p>My friend paused, and then remarked with malignant satisfaction, "The next
  big question for England is Prohibition."</p>

  <p>"But it's such a secondary matter!" "Exactly. That's why it's going to be
  primary. It's trivial enough for a democracy to be really earnest about it.
  Take international settlements and war possibilities; these are infinitely
  more important things, I grant you. But what does the average voter know
  about them? There are possibilities of enslavement, of blood and death, of
  millions of the silly rabbits being scared and starved and mutilated and
  killed in international conflicts. But these voters of yours can't grasp the
  complexity of that. They want peace, of course, but they don't know what
  makes peace. So everybody puts peace on the party platform, peace and the
  League of Nations, or peace and conscription, *be prepared,' or peace and
  isolation, peace and the dear old flag. It doesn't matter. The poor mutts
  can't grasp it at all. Talk of that kind of thing, argument about that kind
  of thing, only confuses and wearies them. It doesn't count in politics. And
  then there's currency and finance. Even the bankers don't understand
  that&mdash;and most of them don't want to. Prices go up and down and credit
  expands and contracts and the rabbits get suddenly well off and full of
  conceit, or they get out-of-work and starved and driven to suicide, but it's
  all quite beyond them how it happens, and it gives them a headache and a
  vicious temper even to try to understand. Obviously they don't know and
  obviously therefore they ought to be concerned for knowledge, but what is
  obvious to you or me isn't obvious to them. What is the vote-catching value
  of spending money on scientific and social and political research? What is
  the vote-catching value of raising the school age to sixteen? That only makes
  the grown-up voter jealous of the next generation.</p>

  <p>"But Prohibition, shutting the public-house round the corner, every man
  and woman understands that, and the women will vote for it anyhow, blind to
  every other consideration. That is something they can understand, and the
  peace of the world, the volume of trade, and economic justice may go hang so
  long as son and husband can be shut and barred from the drink. Interference
  with the personal habits of other people is innate in women; they acquire it
  as sisters, wives, and mothers. The enfranchisement of women was the last
  step in the devotion of democracy to futility. It ended the last
  possibilities of constructive legislation and inaugurated the age of
  restraint."</p>

  <p>He went on to sketch the growth of the Prohibition movement in England;
  the drift of politicians towards a defined attitude in the matter; the way in
  which the question could be used to thrust aside wider and more abstract
  issues. "Watch the speeches of Lloyd George," he said. "Watch the speeches of
  the pushing young men. They are nearer to it than you are. They know."
  So-and-so said this yesterday, and So-and-so said that last week.</p>

  <p>He produced an effect of being detestably right about his facts. He said
  that making Prohibition a part of the American Constitution was the silliest
  thing in history; one might hold the extremest temperance views and still
  understand that a matter of personal health and conduct should have no part
  in the fundamental laws of a State. But the American citizen had lost any
  idea of what a constitution was. Presently the American woman might put a
  morning bath in the constitution, or the weekly weighing of babies or the
  universal use of toothbrushes. Or they might require every married man and
  woman to carry his or her marriage lines conspicuously displayed upon the
  person, like the bright little licence on an English motor-car. These were
  the things they held important. England was going the same way, following a
  few years behind America, because it was a country of more deeply established
  disciplines and diffidences, but I might rest assured it would get to the
  same end. In twenty years' time there would be no politics left in Parliament
  but the politics of scandal and minor moralities, and the big things of human
  life would be managed in some other fashion.</p>

  <p>Thus my friend, and I found it very difficult to gainsay him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="art52"
     name="art52">SEX ANTAGONISM:<br>
  AN UNAVOIDABLE AND INCREASING FACTOR IN MODERN LIFE</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">30.8.1924</p>

  <p class="first">I HAVE been reading a book called <i>Ancilla's Share</i>; it
  professes to be an indictment of Sex Antagonism, but indeed it is an artless
  demonstration of it. It was first published as anonymous, but then came
  paragraphs ascribing it to Miss Elizabeth Robins. Now I gather she admits her
  authorship. I find little of her fine gloomy talent in it. Possibly she is
  only partly responsible.</p>

  <p>It is under a confusing number of heads a tirade against the hostility of
  man to woman. Instances from all the ages jostle one another. Men do not even
  give women fair literary criticism, and this point is rather stressed. Mr.
  Birrell disliked the work of Hannah More; Mr. Max Beerbohm, in a delightful
  and probably untruthful sketch, says he cut up and burnt a work by some woman
  novelist unnamed. But I doubt if strong sexual feeling underlay either
  offence. It happened to be a woman novelist. But Mr. Max Beerbohm has been
  distinctly unflattering to various men contemporaries, and I doubt if Mr.
  Birrell would wallow in praise of Herbert Spencer. It happens that I have
  annotated several of the works of Professor Nicholas Murray Butler in a
  disparaging spirit; marginal illustrations are my weakness; and I have been
  at great pains to destroy by fire a large nobly printed card, very thick and
  strong and stylish, exhibiting one of his aphorisms. It was sent me by some
  American admirer we evidently share between us; it was probably intended to
  dominate my bedroom or study; and it found a useful role at last, charred but
  invincible&mdash;for fire recoiled from it&mdash;as packing for a picture. I
  suppose these facts would win me a place side by side with Mr. Birrell and
  Mr. Max Beerbohm in a revised edition of Ancilla's Share. As it is they
  merely prove that we all have our literary dislikes. I don't think Jane
  Austen has any case against men for lack of appreciation. I don't think that
  any writing woman of Miss Robins's generation can complain of anything in her
  reception by male critics, except perhaps a too eager welcome.</p>

  <p>But I will not embark upon any detailed treatment of the confused riot of
  assertions against men in this book. Need one even pretend to take seriously
  Miss Robins's proposition that women would have managed the world better than
  men have done, that they would have prevented the world war and arrested the
  financial disorganisation of Europe? This talk of Ancilla's tremendous
  nobility in the political field is sheer nonsense. So far the enfranchisement
  of women in Britain and America has had a confusing and belittling influence
  upon politics. It was the women's influence in politics which achieved the
  crowning silliness of making Prohibition a part of the constitution of the
  United States, and in England women have done nothing to save the face of the
  countryside from Mr. Wheatley's dismal women-enslaving house pustules. The
  drive for better education is no stronger than it was before our sisters had
  the vote; the drive for more scientific research is perceptibly feebler.
  Disarmament is manifestly a question of minor importance to women.
  Nevertheless this book proves by its temper what it fails to prove by its
  arguments, that sex antagonism is a fact of very great and increasing
  importance in our world.</p>

  <p>Miss Robins thinks she is at war with men; she is really at war with sex.
  She wants to have men restrained, reproached, and incessantly scolded for
  things for which they are no more responsible than girls in a nunnery. Women
  dress extravagantly, paint their faces, brighten their eyes, wear high heels,
  disregard serious for trivial effective interests. It is the men, she says,
  who make them do it. It is not. It is the presence of men in the world which
  leads to these exaggerations and intensifications of sexual attraction; but
  that is a different matter altogether. If all men were reduced to a helot
  class, there would still be magnificent dresses and extreme physical display
  by women. And men do not welcome women as a sort of neutral competitors in
  their fields of work, because sex imposes a different attitude upon them. Sex
  is mentally as important, if not more important, to a normal man than it is
  to a normal woman. I am not writing of what ought to be, but of what is. Sex
  is an enormous physiological burthen for a woman, but not, it would seem, in
  most cases, such a mental burthen, and it does not last out her lifetime as
  it does a man's. But for a normally constituted man woman is the natural
  symbol of life, and he cannot live fully and happily without her
  companionship and reassurance. She has a material need of his strength and
  his greater power over resources, but he is dependent upon her for gifts of
  peace and encouragement that cannot be covenanted for.</p>

  <p>Nature's way has always been a paradoxical way, and it is a fundamental
  fact in this connection that as human life struggles up from the instinctive
  level we find no prepared adjustment of woman's mind to man's. There is no
  feminine mind different from and reciprocal to a man's mind. They are both,
  man's mind and woman's mind alike, in the form of pure egotism. As the life
  of man becomes more civilised and mental, his need for an adequate helpmeet
  increases. He can no longer get along with a woman bought or captured and set
  to her special business in the harem. But while his need for a free and
  willing helpmeet increases and his demands upon her expand, we find no
  corresponding disposition in able women to co-operate with men. They seem to
  want to drop their sex and set up as imitations of all the successful male
  types. They become a new sex of little aggressive pseudo-men. They want to
  wear the wig of the judge and carry the mace in just the same spirit that
  makes the dressmaker adapt soldiers' uniforms and turn the djibba of a
  dervish into a coquettish garment. They want to substitute Great Women for
  Great Men in our histories and turn out Buddha and Mahomet and Christ in
  favour of feminine equivalents. They will presently want a Lady God in a
  world in which the male will be a fading memory. It will be a parallel and
  parodied world. That is what makes this tumultuous eager book so significant
  and so dismaying. It is an incoherent silly sort of book, but it is written
  in deadly earnest. It is probably widely representative. It expresses very
  typically a vast movement towards non-co-operation which will involve the
  profoundest changes in our social life. But it would take up far beyond the
  limitations set to newspaper articles to discuss the possible treaty that may
  at last end this profound instinctive breach.</p>

  <h2><a id="art53"
     name="art53">LIVING THROUGH:<br>
  THE TRUTH ABOUT AN INTERVIEW</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">6.9.1924</p>

  <p class="first">It is a foolish thing for a writer to see an interviewer.
  Other men may want an intermediary to tell the world of their thoughts and
  intentions, but a writer should be able to do his own telling. Yet I am
  always falling again into this folly.</p>

  <p>They come along with such nice introductions. They are so young and
  respectful and reassuring. They do not make it clear that they mean to turn
  your unguarded civilities into an article until quite at the end of the
  encounter.</p>

  <p>And then arrives the interview, with one's casual suggestions made into
  oracular statements, clothed in uncongenial and sometimes horrible phrases,
  and mixed up with one's visitor's ideas and&mdash;amplifications. And
  everybody takes notice of it and judges one by it. One's writings may be as
  copious as the Nile in flood, but nobody ever seems to get concerned about
  what one says in them. But let loose an interview, and people quote your
  alleged utterances as though they were your most polished thoughts, write
  articles rubbing in the young gentleman's choicest phrases, preach sermons
  reproving your unwonted expressions. They seem to feel that at last they have
  really got you.</p>

  <p>I write with one occasion fresh in my mind. A little while ago an
  interviewer told the world that I said the next few years will be an age of
  fun&mdash;the world was tired of tragedy. For my own part I was to write
  funny books ´ henceforth.... I shall probably never hear the last of
  that.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough I do not remember that particular interviewer at all
  distinctly, nor what friend's introduction it was let him in on me. I
  shouldn't know him again. But I do remember the conversation to which he gave
  this astonishing twist. I remember my train of thought because it is one that
  has been rather frequently with me nowadays.</p>

  <p>He had tried to get me talking of the extravagant horrors of the Next
  Great War. I suppose he thought I should talk impossible rubbish about bombs
  as big as houses and whole cities destroyed by poison gas and so forth, and
  he would be able to retail this monstrous stuff half jeeringly and half
  credulously. At any rate, I found myself talking of the improbability of
  there ever being a war in Europe even so mechanically destructive as the last
  war. The Great War had been the explosion of a vast accumulation of energy,
  moral and social as well as material. Europe might, and probably would,
  bicker, murder, bomb, massacre, and starve, but for another generation at
  least she would not have either the spirit or the discipline or the material
  to produce such munitions and such wide-sweeping concerted action as
  devastated her in the Great War. She is morally and physically bankrupt and
  prostrate. She may go on sinking, as Asia Minor sank, back even to barbarism.
  Even if she does not do so, it will take forty or fifty years to reassemble
  energy for another such world-wide outbreak.</p>

  <p>I went on to talk of the disappointment of the peace. Which had failed us
  most, intelligence or moral force? Both had failed us. For four years now
  Europe had been disintegrating. This poor League of Nations at Geneva,
  snubbed and browbeaten by the French and Italians, who belonged to it and did
  not believe in it, and distrusted and hated by the excluded Russians and
  Germans, seemed to confirm the futility of any constructive effort. Things
  grew worse instead of better. Tariffs, currency manipulation, the cost of
  armaments, were destroying urban and industrial life under our eyes. The
  parasitic speculator flourished; the peasant in his self-centred way held on;
  the rest faded out. If one did not foresee another Great War one foresaw the
  certainty of endless little ones.</p>

  <p>And so talking, and perhaps a little forgetful of my hearer, sitting
  almost knee to knee, intent to translate whatever he could catch of my talk
  and hand it out in his own phrases and colouring, I recalled a conversation I
  had had quite recently in Paris with my friend Philippe Millet, who is now
  dead. We were old friends. We had talked about the affairs of the world in
  Paris both before the war and during the war and at Washington during the
  Conference; and even in 1921 at Washington we could still believe that the
  Western world in which we were born and by which we lived might yet make an
  effort sufficiently creative and generous to save itself and develop a new
  and greater phase of civilisation. I was then publicly denouncing the French
  for their trust in submarines and Senegalese, but that made no difference in
  our mutual good will. He understood the spirit that moved me. But this last
  summer, when we met for the last time, Millet was an ailing and disillusioned
  man.</p>

  <p>"My dear Wells," he said, "you expect too much of this world. In the early
  part of the war there was splendid heroism and devotion&mdash;especially
  among the young. And they died. That was tragedy. But there is no tragedy
  now. There is nothing left great enough in Europe now for tragedy. It is a
  comedy now, a grotesque comedy of haggling and bargaining while the ship
  sinks. The sinking makes no difference. Absurd and preposterous people will
  still remain absurd and preposterous, even when they are running about on a
  sinking ship that they will not even observe to be sinking." It was a point
  of view I had been approaching, but which it needed the push of his assertion
  for me to reach. It is a seizing and desolating point of view.</p>

  <p>Suppose it is true that this system in which we live in Europe, the system
  of national sovereignty reacting upon an economic system of privately owned,
  profit-seeking capital, is entirely unteach-able and inadaptable. Suppose its
  competitions are incurably destructive. Suppose there is indeed nothing
  sufficient to arrest this decay. Suppose that in consequence all Europe has
  to go on breaking down as Russia has broken down, as Germany breaks down, as
  Poland and Hungary will probably soon break down, with no sufficient attempt
  at transition or reconstruction, then what are we to do&mdash;we who have
  some vision of what is happening? How are we going to live through it? Whole
  generations may have to live through it.</p>

  <p>I think that we are justified in saving ourselves as far as possible. I
  think we are bound to do whatever we can to salvage science and art and
  social experience against the days when the breakdown reaches its final phase
  and a real rebuilding is possible. I think we have to do all we can to
  maintain and extend an educational process and educational methods that will
  lay the foundations of a new order, a civilisation of service. And to do such
  things at all effectively we must keep our minds as sweet as we can and press
  our purposes as good-temperedly as possible.</p>

  <p>"Grotesque comedy"!&mdash;in a world of that quality we must not simply
  "live dangerously," but humorously. With aggressive wealth and canting
  patriotism floundering destructively about us, in an atmosphere of catchwords
  and wild misconceptions, with masses of people angry, distressed, and
  misinformed, and with worse to follow, the straight path to martyrdom is a
  mere evasion of our responsibilities. You cannot make a new world in gaols
  and exile; you must make it in schools and books, in Legislatures and
  business affairs, humorously, obstinately, and incessantly. This monstrous,
  distressful, pathetic, but preposterous social disarticulation is too
  intricate and complicated for any simple act or any simple formula to avail.
  We must all do what we can, but our best efforts may, after all, be not so
  much right as right-hh. It would be hard enough to struggle in a world in
  which other people did not understand, but in which we at least were sure we
  were right; it is infinitely harder to struggle, as many of us are doing now,
  with a realisation that our own understanding is limited and faulty.</p>

  <p>In such circumstances a jest, laughter, may come as relief, as
  illumination. Of all men of modern times, I am inclined to think Lincoln was
  the greatest. He held on; he, more than anyone, saved the unity of the New
  World. And throughout the worst of that dark and weary struggle against
  disruption he joked, he told stories. Nobody has ever attempted yet to make
  an anthology of those extraordinary stories. But they were of infinite
  benefit to him and the world. They kept him supple. They saved him from the
  rigor of a pose.</p>

  <p>And now, in still darker and more perplexing times, our need for the
  flexible reconciliations of humour is still greater....</p>

  <p>To this effect I thought aloud in the presence of the bright young man who
  had come to make an interview out of me. He thanked me profusely, won my
  foolish permission to write something about our "most inspiring" talk, and
  went out to report to the world that the notorious prophet foretold an age of
  fun, and was, so to speak, painting his nose for the festival.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="art54"
     name="art54">THE CREATIVE PASSION</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">13.9.1924</p>

  <p class="first">Do men and women generally want a better world than
  this?</p>

  <p>Do they want a world free from war, general economic security&mdash;a
  higher level of general health, long life, freedom and hope for everyone,
  beauty as the common quality of their daily lives?</p>

  <p>The conventional answer to that question, especially if you put it to a
  public meeting with the appropriate gestures, is "Of course they do."</p>

  <p>But the true answer is, "Not much!"</p>

  <p>They may do so when they read an inspiring book by the fireside or hear a
  rousing speech, but they do not do so all round the twenty-four hours, or,
  indeed, at any time when there is any possibility of helping to realise such
  generous desires. "They," I write, but I should write "we." For we all are
  much of the same quality; the tallest man in the world is not much more than
  twice the height of the shortest, and the crime for which the murderer dies
  is just the concrete realisation of the saint's flash of anger. We are all
  but very little above egotism; our passions are warm only when they are
  immediate. I do not believe there has ever been a man who has lived
  steadfastly, continuously, and completely in pursuit of great ends. We are
  all vain, amenable to flattery, stirred by physical impulses, by the
  competitive instinct and jealousy, by anger at opposition, liable to fatigue,
  irritation, and uncontrollable and sometimes quite unaccountable fluctuations
  of motive.</p>

  <p>Simple people like to believe there are Great Men in the world who are
  altogether above this tangle of drive and impulse. But indeed there are no
  such divinities.</p>

  <p>What do we all find in our hearts? An immense self-love, a tremendous
  concentration of our attention upon our personal drama, physical cravings
  bare and physical cravings disguised and sublimated, desire to possess,
  desire for securities, and such-like fear-begotten desires, a desire for
  praise and approval and an instinctive dread of the disapproval and hostility
  of our fellow-men, an aggressive pride and self-assertion so soon as fear is
  allayed. We find, too, imitative impulses, competitive
  impulses&mdash;jealousy. In most cases there is also an extension of our
  egotism to cover our offspring, our dear ones, our friends and near kin. It
  is an extension of our egotism rather than a suppression of it. Is not that
  the drive and quality of most of our living?</p>

  <p>How much of that complex of motives can be used to bind men together into
  a civilised state? One can no doubt play upon their fears, represent the
  dangers of conquest and cruelty by hostile peoples so vividly as to make them
  fight and compel others to fight for them in great wars, rally them to the
  flag in a state of panic, fill them with that frantic distrust and hate of
  strangers which is the basis of vulgar "Patriotism." With a little coercion
  one may even get them to pay national taxes under the influence of these same
  mass-fears. The human animal is a semi-social animal, and though you cannot
  stampede it, as the American bison used to be stampeded, to rush over cliffs
  in a heaped herd-suicide, or like the Russian lemming to swarm into the sea
  and be drowned; yet it can be got moving in masses for collective ends,
  either good ends or bad ends, in an only very slightly rational manner.</p>

  <p>But though these human motives I have cited so far do serve to keep us
  human beings together in smaller and larger communities with a sort of mutual
  restraint and help and tolerance, they supply no real force for any
  progressive betterment of human relations, and still less do they supply any
  driving force to organise and maintain a higher order of civilisation
  throughout the world.</p>

  <p>As soon as the mass urgency subsides we tend to relapse into our own
  little personal lives of eating, drinking, and "having a good time," of
  "getting on," of posing to ourselves and others, of thinking and talking
  ourselves into agreeable states of self-approval, of doing pleasantly
  spiteful things to people we dislike. And if there is nothing more in our
  human composition than these common impulses of the everyday life, this
  coarse stuff of our common humanity, then all our talk and writing about a
  world peace and a higher civilisation is just dream stuff and nonsense. If
  that is all we are then we have no more chance of escaping more wars, more
  famines and disorders, cruelties, and diseases than a trainload of hogs bound
  for Chicago has of escaping the stockyard. None of the hogs may like the
  journey to the stockyard, or their experiences when they get there; that does
  not help them in the slightest degree to escape their destiny.</p>

  <p>But there is something more in humanity than this, and it is this
  something more that transfuses all our life, our politics, our business and
  social organisation, with the colour of romance and the quality of a great
  adventure. Let me take two common incidents to show the kind of "something
  more" that I mean&mdash;the something more in which all our hopes reside.</p>

  <p>It is night on the embankment of a river that flows through a great city,
  and a commonplace youngster leans over the parapet watching and thinking.
  Great warehouses, tall buildings, a tower or so, three or four graceful
  bridges, one beyond the other, set with bright lights and bearing a luminous
  traffic, drop their images into the stream, and each light they bear makes a
  long, slightly wavering reflection upon the smooth black water. A little
  steam-launch, just blackness and a red head-lamp, fusses by. As it passes it
  tears through these tranquil banks of lamp reflections, drags a trail of
  startled and trembling shreds of light behind it, flings them apart,
  elongates them, re-unites them, weaves them into a dancing pattern that
  changes every moment into a fresh intricacy. Splash, splash, splash, comes
  the impact of the little boat's wash against the embankment. The youngster,
  struck with a strange wonder of beauty, watches these changes, tries to
  follow them, tries to detect the law of their dexterous, wonderful
  rearrangements. All the heat and egotism of his personal life are forgotten.
  He is lifted outside all our everyday scheme of motives. He is possessed by
  the desire to know and understand.</p>

  <p>Every one of us has had such moments of pure mental desire. For most of us
  they pass; we are too busy and preoccupied. Some few of us they seize upon
  and make into those devotees of inquiry, men of science.</p>

  <p>Now take my second instance, a row of yards behind a row of mean houses in
  the same great city. Scarcely one of these yards is neglected or purely
  utilitarian. In more than half of them are evidences of effort to make some
  sort of garden or arbour or such-like pleasant and orderly arrangement. You
  rarely see people playing in these yards or resting in them; they are
  overlooked by a railway and very noisy. But nevertheless there you have the
  plainest evidence of an impulse to order and make, the rudiment of the
  garden-making, house-building impulse.</p>

  <p>In most of these yards it has been an unprofitable, useless, and perhaps
  disappointing effort, but it has been at work there. In nearly every man and
  woman there is something of this same garden-making, arbour-building impulse.
  Here again is a second impersonal motive to which we can turn from the
  personal and jealous passions that commonly possess us. It is an ennobling
  motive; witness the face of a skilful painter or carpenter intent upon his
  work.</p>

  <p>Now this desire for knowledge and the impulse to make are the really
  hopeful creative forces in human life. They are the something more and the
  something different, on which I base all my hopes. Submerged and undeveloped,
  overridden by competition, fear, jealousy, vanity, they are yet to be found
  in nearly all of us. The aim of true education is to release them, nourish
  them, give them power and the possibility of co-operation. In this
  possibility lies our sole hope that the ultimate fate of mankind, now packed
  in its nationalist trucks upon the railroad of nationalism, warfare, and
  economic selfishness, will not be the same as that of those hogs upon their
  way to Chicago.</p>

  <h2><a id="art55"
     name="art55">AFTER A YEAR OF JOURNALISM:<br>
  AN OUTBREAK OF AUTO-OBITUARY</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">20.9.1924</p>

  <p class="first">Fifty-four articles have I written in the past twelve months
  and this will be the fifty-fifth and last. I desist. I turn over the book
  into which my secretary with a relentless regularity has pasted them all.
  Some I like; most seem to be saying something quite acceptable to me, but
  imperfectly in a rather ill-fitting form; some are just bad. My admiration
  for the masters of journalism has grown to immense proportions after these
  efforts. Their confidence! Their unstrained directness! Their amazing
  certainty of their length! And their unfaltering quality!</p>

  <p>I had never realised before the tremendous hardship of periodicity. Every
  week or every day the writer must chew the cud of events and deliver his
  punctual copy. Every day, wet or fine, the newspaper sheet must be filled:
  filled, but not congested. But it is only now and then that the phase is good
  for really happy writing. Sometimes everything is germinating, but nothing
  seems to happen; at others a dozen issues compete for attention. Now one does
  not want to write because there is nothing to stimulate one to utterance; now
  because one wants time to consider some dominating event. But the columns
  stand waiting. Henceforth for my poor irregular brain there shall be no more
  periodicity.</p>

  <p>I look over these articles and suddenly there joins on to my sense of them
  the fact that on my table are lying the proofs of a collected edition of my
  writings; eight and twenty fat volumes they will make. I perceive I have
  already lived a long, industrious life. I celebrate my death as a periodic
  journalist&mdash;and these proofs extend the obituary sense beyond the scope
  of that event. If I am not actually tucked up in my literary death-bed I am
  at least sitting on it. Possibly I may yet take a few more airings before I
  send for the clergyman and the heirs and turn in for good and start blessing
  and forgiving people from my pillow, but the longer part is finished. What
  does it all amount to, that mass of written matter?</p>

  <p>The gist of it is an extraordinarily sustained and elaborated adverse
  criticism of the world as it is, a persistent refusal to believe that this is
  the best or even the most interesting of all possible worlds. There is a
  developing attempt culminating in the Outline of History to show that the
  world of men is only temporarily what it is, and might be altered to an
  enormous extent. There is a search through every sort of revolutionary
  project and effort for the material for conclusive alteration. The total
  effect of these articles and these books of mine on my mind, is of a creature
  trying to find its way out of a prison into which it has fallen.</p>

  <p>I recall how that in my boyhood I made a little prison of paper and
  cardboard for a beetle, and how I heard the poor perplexed beast incessantly
  crawling and scratching and fluttering inside. I forget what became of it.
  Perhaps I gave it its freedom; perhaps it pressed and worried at the corners
  where the light came through, and made an enlarged hole and worried its own
  way out. But I remember the dirty scratches and traces of its explorations on
  the unfolded paper cage. To a larger mind these books and articles of mine
  will seem very like those markings.</p>

  <p>Implicit behind and beyond all these writings there is faith in a great
  "outside." I do believe there is a better life for such creatures as we are,
  and betterment for our race and an escape from the meanness, the dullness,
  the petty doomed life of this time. So far as I can go beyond my untrained
  feelings and my unsolved limitations I give myself to the attack upon our
  common prison walls of ignorance and effortless submission. In all these
  articles and books there is the thrust of the natural and conscious and
  convinced revolutionary. I am against the clothes we wear and the food we
  eat, the houses we live in, the schools we have, our amusements, our money,
  our ways of trading, our ways of making, our compromises and agreements and
  laws, our articles of political association, the British Empire, the American
  Constitution. I think most of the clothes ugly and dirty, most of the food
  bad, the houses wretched, the schools starved and feeble, the amusements
  dull, the monetary methods silly, our ways of trading base and wasteful, our
  methods of production piecemeal and wasteful, our political arrangements
  solemnly idiotic. Most of my activities have been to get my soul and
  something of my body out of the customs, outlook, boredoms, and
  contaminations of the current phase of life.</p>

  <p>I am not so very exceptional in this. Endless people find the present
  world&mdash;in spite of storms of natural beauty, in spite of the irregular
  delightful revelations of human possibility&mdash;almost intolerable. Indeed
  I do not know how far the occasional intense loveliness of nature and the
  rare gleams of human dearness and greatness, do not exacerbate their general
  discontent. They struggle to get away from it. Drink&mdash;"the shortest way
  out of Manchester," as someone called it&mdash;a vicious pursuit of
  excitement, opiates and religious devotion, a widespread indulgence of
  reverie, are all forms of escape from the cruel flatness of uninspired days.
  But none of them, unless it be the religious excitement, give more than a
  temporary respite. When the orgy is over comes the awakening still in the
  cage. But in the idea of revolution which does not forget the cage, but
  realises its impermanence, there is an enduring support for the spirit.</p>

  <p>My imagination takes refuge from the slums of to-day in a world like a
  great garden, various, orderly, lovingly cared-for, dangerous still but no
  longer dismal, secure from dull and base necessities. I have come to believe
  in the complete possibility of such a world, and to realise the broad lines
  upon which we can work for its attainment through a great extension of the
  scientific spirit to the mental field, and through a deliberate
  reconstruction of social and economic life upon the framework of a new,
  far-reaching educational organisation. By projecting my mind forward to that
  greater civilisation I do succeed in throwing a veil of unreality over the
  solemn ineptitude of to-day and the complete identification of myself and my
  insufficiencies and disappointments with the quality of common things. By
  insisting that I can be a creative revolutionary I escape from acquiescence
  in what I am and what things are. To live under the rule of King George or
  President Coolidge and under the sway of current customs, habits and usages,
  can be made tolerable by the recognition of their essential transitoriness
  and their ultimate insignificance. And in no other way can it be made
  tolerable to anyone with a sense of beauty and a passion for real living.</p>

  <p>This is what I have been saying in these eight and twenty volumes of
  collected works and in this yearful of newspaper articles, and after a rest
  it is quite possible I shall go on saying it some more. But after these
  reflections upon my literary death-bed I think I shall take a
  holiday&mdash;at least from journalism&mdash;for a time. If there is anything
  worse in this way than periodic journalism it must be preaching and having to
  go into a pulpit with half an hour's supply of uplift fresh and punctual
  every Sunday.</p>
