<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>A SURVEY BY WAY OF PREFACE</h2>

<p class="pin35">Bed in the bush, with stars to see,<br>
Bread I dip in the river&mdash;<br>
There's the life...!<br>
<br>
&mdash;R.L.S.</p>

<p>Man took to walking when he became upright. And still he walks,
despite the "many inventions" he has found to keep his foot from
the good green earth and his body from health. Once he tramped
because he must; now he usually does so for pleasure. The devil
called Speed possesses him at times, but in his saner moods he
confesses a value and a charm in pedestrianism that nothing else
yields. The train, the car, the buggy, the bicycle are excellent
means of getting from place to place; none of them gives him
leisure to note what lies between. That is peculiarly the walker's
gain. It is then that he gathers the harvest of the quiet eye, .and
he sees not only the widespread landscape, but also the details of
Nature's plan. The great mountains raise their heads for others as
for him, but for him only does the ground-lark betray her nest and
the tiny flower shine in the grass. Alike to him are the high-road
and the "little vagrant woodland way, grey-ribboned through the
green." He may go where no vehicle may follow, and at night, with
twenty clean bush miles behind him, he can know what rest really
means as he takes his ease at his inn, or, stretched by his camp
fire on a quiet hill-top, seem so removed from the troubled world
as to feel that he owns the sunset, and that the whole round earth
and its fulness are his.</p>

<p>Never has walking had a greater vogue than it enjoys to-day. A
few years ago an epidemic of walking-races raged like a disease,
and everyone took off his coat and did ridiculous things in fast
time on suburban roads. It was essentially a class
craze&mdash;stockbroker competed against stockbroker, butcher
against butcher. Even telegraph messengers were affected. But all
that was a form of what is technically known as track walking, and
it has little connection with the walking with which this book is
concerned. So distinctive, indeed, is the action of the expert who
can do his mile in seven minutes or less that the cognoscenti,
feeling it was neither natural walking nor yet running, coined a
special name for it. They called it "gaiting." Some interest
attaches to the fact that Australia was the first country in the
world to supply a reasonably satisfactory definition of walking and
make laws for its control as a sport. Possibly few people realise
the exact difference between running and walking. The former is a
series of leaps from one foot to the other, and the runner is in
the air most of the way; in walking there is constant contact with
the earth. The back foot must not leave the ground until the front
one has made connection.</p>

<p>Mercifully, definitions do not trouble the stroller in woodland
ways. He has more attractive stuff to think about. He may walk fast
or he may walk slow, as his age or his inclination suggest, or as
time and distance dictate. It is a game for all ages and both
sexes. Young lads are showing an increasing desire nowadays to test
the back-country tracks, and one of the most devoted followers of
the footpath way is a citizen of Melbourne who confesses that he
has passed his seventieth birthday. He will go alone rather than
lose a holiday or a week-end in the bush, and with his sleeping-bag
on his shoulder he meets philosophically all that chances, sure at
least of his bed for the night and buoyed by the knowledge that
every trip means renewed health. Women and girls, too, have taken
kindly to the open road, and yearly their excursions grow bolder.
At first, one found them exclusively in such places as Lorne and
Healesville, with one day as the limit of their outing from hotel
or boardinghouse. Gradually the horizon has widened. Now they "dare
do all that may become a man." Three feminine walks within the
writer's knowledge in recent years were Warrnambool to Queenscliff;
Lilydale to Warburton, Wood's Point, Darling-ford, Buxton,
Marysville, Healesville and Melbourne; and, more greatly daring,
Bright-Harrietville-Feathertop-Omeo-Ensay-Buchan-Cunninghame. On
the Wood's Point excursion a caravan conveyed the food and bedding,
but they disdained a lift for themselves.</p>

<p>Walking means most, perhaps, to the middle-aged. A man grows
definitely old as soon as he gives up exercise, and it is not
everyone who plays well enough to be welcome at golf, bowls,
tennis, or the other pastimes commonly sought by those who have
"come to forty year." But in this most natural of all the sports
all are on an equal footing, and an agreeable lone hand may be
played in the unlikely contingency of there being no partner
available. Several associations exist in Melbourne for the very
purpose of providing the walker with company to his liking. One of
the oldest established is the well-known Wallaby Club, which
attracts largely the professional man, who finds in the week-end
stroll and the good fellowship relief from the woes of his clients
or his patients. Another, which has reached the respectable age of
over 30 years, is the Melbourne Amateur Walking and Touring Club.
Its main intention, in the beginning, was the cultivation of speed
walking, and for many years it supplied the men who won Victorian
and Australasian championships and put up records. Now the tail
wags the dog, for touring is the sole activity of the club. Racing
is left to a body of younger men, who style themselves the
Victorian Walking and Field Games' Club. The Young Men's Christian
Association used to encourage a rambler's section before the war,
and there are many smaller organisations which are doing good
work.</p>

<p>All of these bodies protest their willingness to make available
such knowledge as they have recorded, but the means of giving it
publicity has been lacking. The problem for the would-be tourist is
ever where to go. In this volume that question will be answered to
a certain extent. Some of the most attractive of the Victorian
walks are here described and the best way to accomplish them made
clear, while hints are given regarding equipment, accommodation,
camping places, care of the feet, and other matters of moment to
the walker.</p>

<h2>CITY STROLLS</h2>

<h3><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>COLLINS STREET</h3>

<p class="pin35">Melbourne, on her cleansing river,<br>
Offers thanks to God, the Giver,<br>
For frank, wide streets and sunny ways,<br>
For parks with golden blooms ablaze,<br>
And, bending low her folk to greet,<br>
The cool, green trees of Collins Street.<br>
<br>
&mdash;R.H.C.</p>

<p>Of all Melbourne's thoroughfares I like Collins Street best. In
its measured mile it provides at least as much variety as any of
our highways, and a certain quality at one end gives the whole a
distinction possessed by no other street that I know.</p>

<p>Time was when, as a wit remarked, this thoroughfare resembled an
insolvent's account book&mdash;it was Dr. Dr. all the way. It is
still the right thing for doctors, especially of medicine, to show
a name plate somewhere between Russell Street and Spring Street,
but the old exclusive possession has departed.</p>

<p>One by one the shops are stealing into the sacred preserve, and
the wrecker is busy on more of the ancient Victorian buildings,
destroying to give their fronts the modern touch. Three or four
porches have been permitted, but the scandal of a verandah has so
far been avoided, and the trees stand as a living monument, so much
more beautiful and effective than anything carved by man, to those
wise burghers who thought to plant them for a later generation to
admire.</p>

<p>The Victorian who is proud of his capital city, and would show
it to advantage, should take his visitor at sunset to a point a
little east of Russell Street, where he may have the two church
towers (particularly Shirlow's "Gothic Spire"&mdash;that capital
piece of work, both in reality and in the etching), rising high
from the crown of the hill and the western sky glowing for a
background. Then he should walk to the intersection of Russell
Street, and, standing where the Burke and Wills monument once
dominated the rise, look down the stretch of Collins Street, which
ends with Spencer Street clock tower. He will see much there to
please his sense of fitness and beauty. Finally, as the light
fades, let him follow Enid Derham's advice ("O city, look the
Eastward way!") and turn to see the shadows trooping to their homes
in the green trees, and the attractive lamps, which civic authority
has recently placed beneath them, opening like flowers to add a new
charm to the scene.</p>

<p>Eastward, too, are some of the finest specimens of the city's
architecture, notably the cool sandstone front of the Old Treasury,
with its numerous windows reflecting the last of the daylight.
There is an air of cultured reserve about this building. It
suggests a wise old man, quiet, introspective, with thoughtful
eyes. Near by broods the bronze figure of Chinese Gordon, one of
the better statues of a city with a few good examples (and some
pretty bad ones, too), of that medium in art. Immediately behind is
the famous Stanford fountain, so much admired for its chaste lines
and so romantic in its history. Is it generally known that it was
designed and carved by a prisoner in Pentridge? He was a man of
quite unusual talent, and the monument may be regarded as the price
of his liberty. He was paid nothing for it, but was released from
gaol with six years still to serve. The material is bluestone from
the Pentridge quarries, and the design took four years to execute.
Stanford's death, it is said, was hastened by the work. His lungs
became affected by the dust inhaled while he chiselled the
stone.</p>

<p>"Why, Melbourne is not flat!" exclaimed a Sydney visitor
recently. She was surveying the rapid fall of Collins Street from
Russell Street down to Swanston Street. The effect is the greater
since the tall buildings have gone up on the south side. But for
its width they would make a canyon of this part. Its steep
footpaths repel the tide of traffic that surges along "the block"
on the level stretch from Swanston Street, the south side so
substantially built, the other with such an irregular sky-line. But
the tide persists beyond Elizabeth Street, changing in character
from that of the idler to that of the busy professional man (and
woman), for here is the country of the banker, the insurance clerk,
and the lawyer.</p>

<p>Again is a mingling of the old and the new in architecture, good
examples of the parvenu Age of Reinforced Concrete in the
distinguished company of chaste creations like the Bank of New
South Wales. The foot traffic thins out; no one comes shopping down
here. That quaint break in the regular formation, Market Street,
tops the rise where, just a short block away, the city's founder,
John Batman, built his home some ninety years ago.</p>

<p>A measured mile of wealth, with much beauty added, this street
should be preserved by civic pride from desecration in any form.
What a specially glorious thing it would be, a joy for ever, could
the planes and elms of the east end be extended the full length.
Never have those trees been more beautiful than in this present
spring. Collins Street is a great street and they are its crowning
glory.</p>

<h3><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>THE OPEN GARDEN</h3>

<p class="pin30">Art is but Nature to advantage drest:<br>
Look well on Nature&mdash;and you'll know the rest.<br>
<br>
&mdash;(Pope&mdash;adapted.)</p>

<p>Our Botanic Gardens have been acclaimed one of the three finest
in the world. No Melburnian with an eye for beauty fails to
recognise their great charm. But Sir Frank Clarke's book (surely
the most delightful thing of its kind published in Australia), has
said the last word about this beautiful collection and arrangement
of plant life, so I shall pass it by, assuming that all Victorians
know and are proud of it.</p>

<p>The Fitzroy Gardens are quite another matter. They seem to be
all too little known to the man in the street. Yet they lie in the
very bosom of the city, and are lovely both by art and by nature.
Traffic roars past in all the nerve-racking tumult of the modern
street, and they dream on, undisturbed, an oasis of peace in a
desert of noise.</p>

<p>They are a testimonial to Melbourne's good citizenship, these
Gardens. Like most of the cultivated reserves, they are now
fenceless, their lawns are open and inviting to all, and the
freedom is not abused. The result of this removal of restraint
suggests that that wise old humorist, Mark Twain, was right when he
thought Adam ate the apple solely because it was forbidden. "The
obvious mistake," he added, "was in not forbidding him to eat the
serpent."</p>

<p>From the city the way is short and agreeable. Only the width of
the Treasury Gardens separates the Fitzroy reserve from the top of
Collins Street. Enter the Treasury Gardens at the Clarke Memorial
and you are at once in the dappled shade of a varied avenue of
oaks, elms, palms, pines, Moreton Bay figs, a white poplar, a
willow, and others. Below, on the right, is the enclosed lakelet
(now bright with water lilies), with its ring of special plants.
This is known as the Japanese garden. It is told that a party of
Japanese visitors were taken to it. "Garden," said their guide.
"Yes," replied the taciturn visitors, after due consideration.
"Japanese," added the guide. "No!" came the prompt reply, with
emphasis.</p>

<p>The glory of the Fitzroy Gardens is their avenues, and in these
they excel their Botanic brother. A tunnel of green coolness is
created by the great elm avenue which runs as far east as the
central creek, branching off there in several directions. Just now
the stem of every tree is decorated with the nymph cases of
cicadas, and the air vibrates, each warm day, with their strident
song, while birds "wax fat and kick" (like Jeshurun) as they dine
sumptuously on the soft green bodies.</p>

<p>There's a bewilderment of choice in the paths. All are good, and
all lead to the central core, a choice portion which, mistakenly, I
think, actually has a fence. Within its bounds is a minor heaven,
if heaven be a place of peace and beauty. Here poetry might be
born, here youth dream dreams and old men see visions. The green
lawn is hedged about by tall trees, goldfish nose the banks of a
papyrus-edged pool, a little fountain splashes coolness, and narrow
paths, emerald lanes formed of soft-foliaged bamboos and other
evergreens, wind about and lose themselves in the most entrancing
fashion. A reminder of ancient days is the butt of a giant gum
tree, brought from its native hills in sections and set up here to
waken in a new generation thoughts of what our country was like</p>

<p class="pin30">"When wild in woods the noble savage ran."</p>

<p>One of the unusual avenues is that of Himalayan cedars (the
Deodar which gives the title to an early book of Kipling's),
shielding the two ribbons of garden that rise towards East
Melbourne. Another good double row of trees meets over the plane
tree walk, and there are lines of Lombardy poplars (tall, stately
chaps with their cloaks held tightly round them), American maples,
flowering chestnuts, Queensland silky oaks (covered at present with
their honeycomb-like bloom), lindens and araucarias. Individual
trees stand out, such as the Queensland Kauri near the
south-eastern corner, a paper-bark on a western lawn, some redwoods
(the giant tree of California) also on the western side, and a
Moreton Bay fig near a noble jacaranda. Finest of all is the slim,
graceful lemon-scented gum at the back of the deodars. She is
always a delight, and never more so than when, obviously conscious
in early summer of her new, close-fitting dress of silver bark.</p>

<p>The population of the Gardens is varied and numerous. Birds
abound. The Kookaburra may be seen (and heard) constantly,
thrushes, blackbirds, minahs, doves and blue wrens treat the grass
plots as their own. Two pairs of the white-shafted fantail built
last season in bushes in the main walk, and the sacred Kingfisher
nests not far away, for the mother was seen the other day feeding a
hungry young one. One morning I noted a land rail at the creek, and
a rabbit nibbled at the grass close by. Possums are plentiful, as
anyone who strolls through by night can testify.</p>

<p>Reluctantly one leaves these Gardens. Pan, outcast from a
war-smitten world overseas, might well be hiding here. The statues,
showing in glimpses clown the leafy aisles, encourage the
thought.</p>

<p>Memory brings away pictures of sunny lawns, shady groves, peace
and beauty.</p>

<h3><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>THE NEW AND THE OLD</h3>

<p class="pin30">A stately city&mdash;mark her lofty towers,<br>
Her league-long streets with myriad lights agleam;<br>
Here wealth and pride exhibit all their powers&mdash;<br>
Is this the "village" of John Batman's dream?<br>
<br>
&mdash;R.H.C.</p>

<p>For all its spreading acres how young Melbourne is! A
native-born friend could tell me yesterday (and he is hale and
hearty and good for many years yet) that his mother used to do the
family washing in a tiny creek. That is the creek which runs
through the centre of the present Fitzroy Gardens. It was then a
pleasant burbling little stream, with its source near where the
Presbyterian Ladies' College stands.</p>

<p>There was but small settlement in the neighborhood in those
times. Later my friend and some other youngsters discovered a
delightful playground which kept them in games for many a day. It
was the foundations of the Public Offices, known to their
generation as O'Shanassy's Folly. But O'Shanassy builded better
than his critics knew; the huge pile is more than fully occupied,
and the situation is one of the very best for its
purpose&mdash;completely in the city, yet cut off from its
noises.</p>

<p>Have you ever asked Young Australia what he thinks of a place?
He has one superlative: "It's not bad!" Well, the view from the
corner of Spring and Finders Streets, just below the Public
Offices, is "not bad." That corner might well serve as a starting
place for a little "walk-about," with an eye open for things of
interest.</p>

<p>The first is certainly the outlook over the sunken railway lines
which edge Flinders Street on the south. By the way, the advent of
electric trains has pretty well removed the old name of "Cinders
Street," which used to be applied to this part. Beyond is the
Domain (where sometime, it seems imperative, our National Art
Gallery must be), the outstanding point being Federal Government
House on the crest of the rise. The slopes can look particularly
attractive from here, especially in the Spring, when the long line
of trees in Alexandra Avenue is breaking into soft bud. Even the
raw redness of the railway structures in the middle distance is not
without its value at certain times, as when a winter sun, about to
set, catches it "in a noose of light."</p>

<p>The tall radio mast, lifting its head over the hill, has long
been noticeable from this point, and now, midway between it and the
outstanding bulk of the Victoria Barracks, a new note is struck by
the fluttering flag which marks where the Great War memorial is to
stand.</p>

<p>The eye travels comfortably along the green line of St. Kilda
Road until arrested by the dome of Flinders, Street station.
Sundown is the time to see it from here; then you will realise why
that keen recorder of Melbourne's picturesque points, John Shirlow,
has so frequently etched this dome. Against the background of a
brilliant sunset, or outlined on a pile of cumulus, the effect is
striking. Well down the street shows the more formal tower of the
Fish Market, which recalls the fact that the dome of Flinders
Street station covers the site of an older Fish Market still.</p>

<p>It is good to stroll on, noting in passing that St. Paul's
spires are assuming definite shape, and that Flinders Street is
rapidly being rebuilt. Resist for the present the fascination of
the wharves, just a couple of blocks along, but pause long enough
to reflect that it was probably about the Queen's Bridge (earlier
titled the Falls Bridge) that John Batman, on June 8, 1835, wrote
in his diary: "This will be the place for a village."</p>

<p>Then it was unbroken wilderness; to-day there are nearly a
million people in the "village." And this has all happened within
three generations. Turn up Elizabeth Street and mark the busyness
of this thoroughfare&mdash;which runs all the way to Sydney. Note
the huge buildings, so large that even the Post Office tower is
hidden. Yet here was a watercourse a very few years ago. In my own
time the digging of the street to lay foundations for the cable
trams revealed a stretch of redgum corduroy which our fathers had
found it necessary to put down to keep the street from swallowing
travellers completely in wet weather.</p>

<p>The land rises on either side of Elizabeth Street as in a
veritable stream. Come up to Queen Street, on the ridge, and stroll
north a few blocks. The enclosure where Franklin Street crosses is
the site of the Old Cemetery. The remains of the pioneers who slept
here, and all their memorials, were recently removed to Fawkner to
make way for municipal markets. An exception is the monument to
John Batman, now re-erected at the corner of the Amateur Sports
Ground (the old Friendly Societies' Reserve), in Batman Avenue.</p>

<p>But there is an older cemetery still, for the beautiful little
Flagstaff Gardens, within a stone's throw of where we now stand,
was once called Burial Hill, because of a few very early graves
within it.</p>

<p>Times are changed indeed! This Flagstaff Hill was the centre of
the social life of Melbourne in those early years, when Mr.
Superintendent Latrobe controlled the destinies of the Port Phillip
Settlement, and he might be seen taking the air here of a fine
Sunday afternoon. In the memory of veterans like Mr. E. C. O.
Howard and the late George Gordon McCrae it was one of the really
charming spots of the locality. Its grassy surface was lawn-like
and pleasant, and from its base stretched a beautiful blue
lake&mdash;a real lake, nearly oval, and full of the clearest salt
water. "Only man is vile"&mdash;the "improvements" of civilisation
have not only obliterated the lake, but have supplied its place
with a rubbish tip.</p>

<p>Another great attraction for our forefathers was the notice
board with the latest shipping news, for the height of the hill
(now apparently so much reduced) commanded a view of Hobson's Bay,
and here stood the flagstaff which signalled the arrival and
departure of the shipping. That was the link, almost the only one,
with the world which these pioneers had left so far behind them.
Isolated as they were, news was news indeed. It is easy to imagine
their interest in this spot.</p>

<p>How much may be packed into '90 years! And in an hour we have
walked across that period into an age differing tremendously from
our own, for then there were no mechanical aids to work and play,
and, as Blamire Young once pictured it:</p>

<p class="pin30">"Men wore curly hats and funny clobber."</p>

<h2>ONE DAY WALKS</h2>

<h3><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>ST. HELENA</h3>

<p class="pin10">Give me the clear blue sky over my head, and the
green turf beneath my feet, a winding road before me, and a three
hours' march to dinner&mdash;and then to thinking!<br>
<br>
&mdash;Hazlitt.</p>

<p>Here is one of the many little walks, full of interest, which
Melbourne folk may enjoy in the compass of a Saturday afternoon or
a Sunday. It is essentially a meditative outing, one which may be
taken alone without disadvantage. The distance is just right for
the time, or, what is equally good, may be made so. The views are
excellent, the road as winding as even Hazlitt would have it, and
at one point the walker may pass at a stride through the whole
period of Victoria's history and find himself contemplating what to
us constitutes antiquity.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Way.</p>

<p>Whether you go by the afternoon train on Saturday or by one of
the Sunday morning trains, alight at Greensborough. The question of
lunch on Sunday can best be answered by taking some with you. There
are, however, hotels both at Greensborough and Eltham, and the two
townships are only three miles apart. The train journey through
Ivanhoe and Heidelberg, two of the most picturesque of our suburbs,
is an attractive prelude to the run which follows across the open
park-like country, in which still stand numbers of fine old
redgums. Greensborough is a revelation. You suddenly find that you
are looking down into a valley of orchards and gardens, with the
Plenty River making long loops and curves at their feet. It must
strike most people as odd that this creek is ever and always
dignified by the name "river." It rises somewhere about Mount
Disappointment, at the back of Whittlesea, and its whole course,
down past Tooroorong and the Yan Yean and on to its junction with
the Yarra near Templestowe, is but a trifling distance, but neither
that nor its insignificant width has succeeded in correcting its
original classification. On leaving the Greensborough station, turn
back, cross the line and join the Heidelberg road. Follow down to
the bridge, below which the Plenty is murmuring peacefully and
looking most inviting, cross the bridge, and within a hundred yards
or so a three-armed signpost will arrest you at a sharp turn to the
right. Pointing back along the road you have come, one arm
indicates that Heidelberg is five miles and Melbourne 13 miles
away; to the left the indicator gives "Diamond Creek 31M." The
right-hand track is yours. It is labelled "St. Helena 2M., Eltham 3M."</p>

<p class="cpb">Pleasant Going.</p>

<p>You at once begin to climb Boyle's Hill. A cutting at the top
has eased the grade, but on a warm day this will be found a
pleasant pore-opener. The way is prettily edged with green slopes
holding some good timber. As you start the ascent note on your left
a little cottage made picturesque by that Dodo of the vehicular
world, an omnibus. What a change from the city streets and their
roar to this quiet oasis. It has made its last trip, the last
customer has paid the final fare, and in its old age it is
doubtless glad enough to exchange the turmoil of its early life for
the peace of this "bee-loud glade."</p>

<p>The road winds and gives you views and opportunities to vary the
going by taking to the paddocks across corners. At one of the bends
a road goes off to the right for Eltham; avoid it at present, but
note it. A finger-post removes all doubt. You now start the ascent
of Lannon's Hill, and at the top is a gate marked St. Helena. It is
just past a house and almost opposite another. A thing to ponder
over is a startling change in the nature of the soil, which will be
noticed as you look across the hill crest to the north-west and
west. You have been walking on a whitish ground which looks
alluvial; at a line on the St. Helena estate it alters abruptly to
the rich black soil of a lava flow. The outlook from here eastwards
is fine. Low, wooded hills compose the foreground, the middle
distance has for conspicuous landmarks such well-known points as
Garden Hill at Kangaroo Ground, and the pine-covered rise to the
north of Ringwood station, while the background displays those blue
ranges, of which St. Leonard, Monda, Juliet and Donna Buang are the
most conspicuous peaks. It was not only the rich belt of soil and
the neighbourhood of the river that made the early settler build
his home here; it was also an appreciation of beauty.</p>

<p class="cpb">"The Paths of Glory."</p>

<p>Go across the small reserve, open a second gate, and you will
find yourself in a graveyard surrounding a church. The tablet
outside tells you it is St. Katherine's, and a place of public
worship; but you shall soon gather that it was originally designed
for the use of a single family, the private chapel of a patriarchal
system. Major Anthony Beale, who had been paymaster to the East
India Company's forces, arrived from the island of St. Helena in
1839. The Port Phillip Settlement was then four years old, and
Melbourne had escaped the indignity of being named Bearbrass. He
records in his diary that he consulted several agents (he refers to
them in no complimentary terms), including John Pascoe Fawkner, and
eventually decided on this piece of land on the Plenty, then
hopelessly out in the bush. He mentions that he became lost on one
occasion about where Collingwood has replaced the trees with
streets. The original house he built, of imported weatherboards,
still stands with its chimneys of narrow, hand-made bricks, the
only important change being the recent substitution of iron for the
ancient shingle roofing. A feature of the living room is the great
fireplace, with a stone seat built in at each end, so that man and
wife might face one another across the cheerful blaze. Napoleonic
relics hang on the walls. The family was large, and grandson and
great grandson live in the old home to-day.</p>

<p>Beside the house is the church, a substantial building with
Gothic windows, some of them in stained glass to commemorate
departed relatives. The leadlights behind the altar are inscribed
with references to the founder and his wife; at the other end are
two tablets, one bearing the dedication of the chapel, the other
recording the death of Onesiphorus Beale, the eldest son, who was
drowned in the Tamar in August, 1839, as the family came through
Tasmania on its way to Port Phillip. The churchyard has its portion
sacred to the Beale family and its connections. In this plot lies
Charles Symons Wingrove, who died in 1905, after 46 years as
secretary of the Shire of Eltham. Of the original settlers it is
recorded that Anthony Beale was born in 1790 and died in 1865, and
that Katherine Rose, his wife, was born in 1795 and died in 1856.
Four cypresses and a pine sigh over them and the lines of their
descendants.</p>

<p>In the public portion lies the body of Walter Withers, an
artist, who loved this picturesque countryside, but no stone bears
his name. The monument to Graham Webster, one time Police
Magistrate, carries an interesting inscription. He was born in
Essex in 1830, and died in Greensborough in 1903. It reads thus:
"Here lies Graham Webster, the last of his race, who descended in
one unbroken line from father to son for a period of 779 years." It
suggests Gray's line, "The paths of glory lead but to the
grave."</p>

<p class="cpb">Eltham.</p>

<p>Stroll quietly back to where you saw the Eltham road turn off.
It will take you along some agreeable stretches under good gums,
and inside of two miles you will have crossed the Diamond Creek,
with its many wattles, and emerged through a cutting into the long
and straggly street of Eltham. Down to the right (roughly south) is
a good picnic ground, half a mile on your left is the railway
station.</p>

<h3><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>SOUTH MORANG TO HURSTBRIDGE</h3>

<p class="pin10">Some also have wished that the next way to their
Father's house were here, that they might be troubled no more with
either hills or mountains to go over, but the way is the way, and
there is an end.<br>
<br>
&mdash;John Bunyan.</p>

<p>When winter is fairly with us, from every hill giving an
easterly outlook snow may be seen whitening the mountains from St.
Leonard to Monda, and from Juliet to Donna Huang. Such a storm of
hail as sometimes comes over from the west is a reminder of the
possibilities of even the brightest days of July. So the
excursionist will be well advised to see that his boots are stout,
and to carry a waterproof, if he prefers his outings in cool
weather.</p>

<p class="cpb">South Morang.</p>

<p>A delightful walk, suitable for a Sunday or holiday, may be had
by going to South Morang, about an hour's train journey, and making
for Hurstbridge, some ten miles away by the road about to be
described. On leaving the station, turn south along the Whittlesea
road until you reach the South Morang Hotel on a corner. Then swing
to the left and follow a flat way, which runs between ploughed
fields with some good redgums still standing. There is nothing to
prepare you for the dramatic picture which you are to see at the
end of half a mile, and perhaps its unexpectedness gives value to
the view.</p>

<p>The rich soil is evidently the product of volcanic action. At a
high point on the road a cutting has been made, and between its
black, rocky sides you look through to a sudden valley of
considerable depth, at the bottom of which the Plenty River twists
and winds. The near side, down which the road curves, is overhung
with mounds and pillars of rock of basaltic type, the other wall of
the valley is alluvial in character. Apparently the stream is
following the edge of the lava flow. The whole result is
picturesque in the extreme. Near the bridge are many nooks where
you may shelter from every wind, and bask in any sunlight that the
day affords, and here, if anywhere, is the place for the al fresco
lunch.</p>

<p class="cpb">Good Views.</p>

<p>It is a steady climb to reach again the general level of the
land. Gum scrub and saplings cover the hillside, and grevilleas and
heathy plants decorate whatever open spaces there are. A twist to
the left brings you almost to the summit and presently your track
bends to the right to end in a north and south road. This is on its
way to Heidelberg from a little village whose name's Doreen. Now
you must face north and very soon you will come to the State School
of Tanck's Corner&mdash;a very pretty corner, too, where a road
makes off on the right for Diamond Creek.</p>

<p>Resist its seductions and keep straight on down the hill and up
the opposing slope, admiring as you go the prospect of blue ranges
ahead and on your right front. Rather more than half a mile from
the school there is a junction and you take the road to the right.
It is bordered by orchards, decorated with cherry plums and apples.
They probably form the attraction for the flocks of rosellas which
rise noisily as you pass. Rapidly the cultivated land is left and
you walk down aisles of eucalypts with the branches almost meeting
overhead. It is a typical country track, and as it hugs the ridge
it gives appetising glimpses, through the timber, of long slopes
dropping to crop-green flats, varied by patches of bush, and rising
finally to form the everlasting hills. Mount Disappointment is
there, and the Sugarloaf and the high lands of Kinglake and a
generous panorama that takes in most of the northerly and eastern
mountains near to Melbourne.</p>

<p class="cpb">To Hurstbridge.</p>

<p>There are nearly three miles of this thoroughfare before you
reach the turn-off for Hurst's Bridge. It makes so sharp a set-back
on your right that it might easily be overlooked. An orchard marks
one corner, and in the same paddock is a house, some 200 yards away
on the road you are to go. It is a good road, and downhill for the
whole of its two or two and a half miles. At half a mile it
branches; take the left fork. All the way there is good green
timber, and a profusion of beautiful wattles, whose display of
flower-buds in June and July proves, despite the temperature, that
"the hounds of Spring are on Winter's traces." At the foot of the
descent you meet, and cross, Diamond Creek, and just above it is
the railway station.</p>

<h3><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>HURSTBRIDGE TO PANTON HILL AND
ELTHAM</h3>

<p class="pin35">I leave the lonely city street,<br>
The awful silence of the crowd;<br>
The rhythm of the roads I beat,<br>
My blood leaps up, I shout aloud,<br>
My heart keeps measure with my feet.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Arthur Symons.</p>

<p>I don't know that the poets always practise exactly what they
preach. I have never met one on a country road "shouting aloud,"
for instance. But the mood, and the necessity for the expression of
it, are easily understandable in brisk, hearty weather and on such
breezy, high-stepping roads as those which lead to Panton Hill.
They make good walking in most seasons, and never better than in
winter. They have a way, too, of seeking the ridges which may be
purely utilitarian in origin, but serves the excellent secondary
purpose of providing the traveller with extensive views. The whole
of this countryside is eminently "paintable," and one need not be
an artist to see pictures in the wooded slopes, broken by the
lighter greens of cultivation or the contrasting tones of
newly-ploughed earth, and backed by distant ranges of many shades
of blue.</p>

<p class="cpb">Hurstbridge.</p>

<p>Probably the best approach is by way of the rail to Hurstbridge.
A trip on foot from there to embrace much of the best of the
scenery need not involve you in more than 12 miles. If you have no
other day you can make it on a Sunday between the arrival of the
train at Hurstbridge at noon and the departure of one of the
evening trains which leave Eltham between 6 and 7.30. Hurstbridge
is capable of giving you lunch, if you prefer not to carry it, and
so is Panton Hill, while tea is obtainable at Eltham.</p>

<p>The train journey is attractive with its picturesque glimpses of
Ivanhoe, Heidelberg and Greensborough. Eltham has long been a home
for the painters of the metropolis. From there the valley of the
Diamond Creek is followed, the line running close to the creek edge
in places, near enough to show the budding promise of spring on the
wattles. The little township which derives its name from the creek
is prettily placed against a bank west of the railway. There has
been debate from time to time as to whether mistletoe in Australia
grows on other than eucalypts; here it may be seen in profusion on
the silver wattles. When it is blooming you must look closely to
distinguish the dull red flowers hanging among the drooping
leaves.</p>

<p>Hurstbridge has ever to me a watchful look, half of welcome and
half of suspicion. The visitor is esteemed, but there is still the
memory of those days, not so far back, when the sleepy village woke
to find itself made famous by proclamation as the desirable spot to
visit on Wattle Day, and all suburbia, with his wife and children,
raided the paddocks.</p>

<p class="cpb">Hilly Roads.</p>

<p>Turn to the left as you leave the station. Follow the main road
through the long-drawn-out township until the houses end. It is
pleasant going. The shops and dwellings are all on the right hand;
on the left are orchards sloping to the foot of a low range of
hills which combines what Stevenson said every river should
possess&mdash;"continuity and change." In half a mile you pick up a
branch to the right. A finger-post advises you that you may reach
Panton Hill this way in three miles, and that the other road makes
for Queenstown. At once you plunge into a beautiful bit of forest
road, specially delightful in its lights and shadows when the sun
is out, the trees almost meeting overhead. Evidences of old time
alluvial workings are abundant along the bed and slopes of a creek,
but as you cross it you lose these and the road rises into more
open country. There are many harmonious thrushes in the edge of the
timber, and magpies are numerous on the cleared land. The latter
sing cheerfully, and the windier the day the more they carol. The
thrush in Winter seems to have no more than a single note, very
unlike his usual melody. He compares unfavourably then with the
English thrush, which is vociferously vocal in city gardens as soon
as the first Autumn rains arrive.</p>

<p>Steadily the highway justifies the title by seeking greater
heights. You see it curling away to right or left ahead of you, and
all the time it is rising. Distant mountains increase in number,
orchards alternate with patches of the original bush, and
well-placed houses peep out from the timber on the tops of hills.
Walking this ridge, and seeing the land fall on either side, gives
an impression that there is no flat country at all.</p>

<p class="cpb">Panton Hill.</p>

<p>In an easy hour you will come to a junction where a
notice-board, with as many arms as a Hindu god, gives you so much
information that it almost amounts to literature. You learn, inter
alia, that you have come 3¼ miles and have still a quarter of a
mile to do before you reach Panton Hill, that Queenstown is three
miles down the new, well-made road you have just entered upon, and
that if you take the first turning on the left, along Alma Road,
you will gain Watson's Creek.</p>

<p>Go on the quarter-mile, and see the village of Panton Hill. It
is nicely placed for outlook, and it contains two useful things to
a hungry man&mdash;an hotel and a tearoom. Presumably the hill was
named after the old Police Magistrate, the late Mr. J. A. Panton,
who, by the-way, was responsible for the naming of Donna Buang.
Retrace your steps as far as the signpost just referred to, and
from there head for Kangaroo Ground.</p>

<p>The road is here a siding with a southerly and easterly aspect,
which includes a very fine view of the Dandenongs. Further on you
get the full line of high hills which runs from Mount St. Leonard,
at Toolangi, to Donna Buang and Ben Cairn, overlooking Warburton.
Back of them again are some huge bulks which may be Baw Baw and its
neighbours. The road rises and falls, and changes direction so
frequently that the outlook is constantly varied. A cross-road,
near a small store and just at the beginning of a thick belt of
forest, leads on the one hand to Diamond Creek, and on the other to
Watson's Creek and Yarra Glen.</p>

<p class="cpb">Kangaroo Ground.</p>

<p>A striking change of soil heralds Kangaroo Ground. (It would be
interesting, by the way, to learn when the last kangaroo was seen
here). It is first noticeable where a hill, in Lafcadio Hearn's
phrase, "rises softly as a prayer," bearing in its season a vivid
green crop, often edged with a black strip where the plough is at
work. The change from the grey alluvial-looking soil to this
deep-toned volcanic flow is dramatic in its suddenness. The track
skirts the flow, crosses it, turns a corner, and almost at once you
are passing an hotel on the top of the rise. A long, steep descent
follows, on the slopes of which stand the principal buildings of
Kangaroo Ground. The pull out of the valley is a stiff one. At a
brick building which was once an hotel, you turn sharply to the
right, and, as you do so, the Dandenongs, which have been gradually
assuming a normal aspect, swing into their old familiar place on
the eastern horizon.</p>

<p class="cpb">Research&mdash;Eltham.</p>

<p>A windy siding, with a northerly slope, follows, but</p>

<p class="pin10">"Better than mortar, brick and putty,<br>
Is God's house on a blowing day."</p>

<p>With more trees there comes shelter from the breeze. The road
splits, but it is safe to pursue either the well-used thoroughfare
or the telegraph poles. From the old road here branches off a bush
track for Warrandyte. On the down slope a belt of pines marks where
the aqueduct swings across one hillside and back along the other.
It is just above Research, a township whose name suggests mining,
but whose appearance is purely horticultural. At the foot of the
hill is a tiny creek, which uses the road as a bank to lean against
for some distance. The going becomes more level, and where there is
a bend to the left the railway line will be observed. Follow it for
half a mile, and Eltham station will terminate an outing packed
full of good things.</p>

<h3><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>BOX HILL TO DONCASTER AND
HEIDELBERG</h3>

<p class="pin30">The roads are the great things; they never come to
an end.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Lady Gregory.</p>

<p>Sydney folk have a playful habit of referring to Melbourne's
cable trams as relics of the stone age, and of implying that their
city holds the original patent for electric cars. Most of them are
unaware that in this form of traction Brisbane led them by some
years, and probably none of them suspects the fact that Melbourne
was still earlier in the field than Brisbane. How many Victorians,
even, recall the electric tram from Box Hill to Doncaster? "The
dead go quickly," says the French proverb, and with its death it
went out of remembrance. Walking that quiet country road to-day,
and reflecting that thirty years ago (was it as much as that? I
have no means of telling) the population of these parts must have
been sparse indeed, one marvels that it could have been selected
for such an enterprise. But "the boom" made all things seem
possible.</p>

<p class="cpb">Box Hill.</p>

<p>Box Hill is still sufficiently a country town to hold a typical
country market. There is no mistaking the appointed day: horses are
"hung up" in long lines on the fences of the reserves, and one of
the divisions of that broad thoroughfare, the White Horse Road, is
full of farmers' vehicles, which range these times from hay waggons
to motors.</p>

<p>If you would have a pleasant road walk, turn north as you leave
the Box Hill station, cross White Horse Road, with its market to
the left and its soldiers' memorial in the centre, and follow the
plane-lined way called Station Street. It heads for Doncaster, once
marked conspicuously by its tower, stow merely the highest ridge of
the orchard-covered slopes. This is the route of the ancient tram.
No sign of it exists, unless certain weathered poles, which stand
idle here and there, and certainly look old enough, are the
standards that were used. The outlook north and west becomes good
at once. Mount Macedon is a prominent object on the sky line,
closing the view across long stretches of undulating country.
Beyond the new State school, which is built on the left side of
Station Street, the land falls gradually, to rise as gently again
to the Mont Albert ridge, on which shows out conspicuously another
fine State school. The town straggles with you for a while, but
gradually it drops behind, and you find yourself among open fields
and orchards.</p>

<p class="cpb">"Hark, Hark, the Lark!"</p>

<p>Where the road is narrowed down by fences to cross the first
branch of the Koonung Koonung Creek, there is a fine plantation of
clean, healthy-looking silver wattles. It is evidently appreciated
by the birds. Many, including magpies, were calling there when I
passed recently. It was there, too, that I observed what I believe
is an unusual thing&mdash;a skylark singing from the ground. In New
Zealand I have seen these birds on a few occasions whistling as
they sat on fences, but generally they have fulfilled the poet's
description: "Singing still doth soar, and soaring ever singeth."
The larks are numerous, and a protracted Autumn, with its sunny
skies, provokes them to as much song as if the Spring were at
hand.</p>

<p>The creek is not much more than a deep gutter here, but it gives
you a rise to climb on the other side. Dropping down from that to
the more important branch, you get the orchards ahead of you in
mass, yielding often some charming effects. There are broad washes
of green, representing grass, superimposed upon which are splashes
of the crimson and gold of fruit-tree leaves. Ploughed fields are
shown as chocolate smudges. The whole is divided up, and framed as
separate panels, by hedges of varied tones. Among the roadside
growths a solitary Bursaria of good stature is noticeable. It
evidently made a brave display of its white bloom last season, for
it now rattles a large number of the little seed-purses from which
it derives its name. Immediately opposite is a golden wattle aching
to break into blossom.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Ridge.</p>

<p>An impression of the creek in passing is that it contains
everything but water. Gum trees there are, and Bursaria and
tea-tree and wattles, and even grass, but evidently the true
business of a creek is attended to when there is rain, and at no
other time. Long is the slope which follows. Here you get the
orchards in detail, and may find that the leaves are falling fast,
the more hardy specimens fluttering in the wind like the gay
ribbons of a Highland regiment. Robins are flashing their scarlet
breasts in staccato flights, and every hedge is musical with
goldfinches. Half-way up the hill is a right-hand branch to be
avoided. Your immediate objective is a two-story store on the
corner of Doncaster's main street, known earlier in its career as
the Bulleen road. It comes in on the west from Kew, and passes on
easterly, to reach Mitcham, Vermont and the Dandenongs after many
twists and turns. A few hundred yards up is the hotel where the
"Doncaster tower" stood for so many years. The elevation of the
ridge is about 350 feet, so the extra height supplied by the tower
commanded a wonderful outlook. Even from the ground level the Bay
is plainly visible, with the You Yangs indicating its limits on the
one side, and Arthur's Seat standing sentry on the other. Macedon,
with its Hump, is much in evidence, and the turrets of the Kew
Asylum mark the middle distance. Looking back over the short 2L
miles you have come from Box Hill, every detail seems under review.
Walking on north, as you should, good easterly and northerly views
are had of bush country, dipping to the bed of the Yarra, and
rising everywhere again to blue ranges. So practically the whole
circle of the horizon is completed.</p>

<p class="cpb">Into Heidelberg.</p>

<p>Doncaster lives on fruit. As you resume your walk you are sure
to hear the asthmatic cough which all cool stores seem to suffer
from. There may be still mushrooms on the road edges where the
capeweed, making ready for its early spring change from green to
gold, is battling with that other, equally hardy, alien, the onion
grass. A local poet has written a sonnet in praise of the onion
grass, but I fear her admiration of this weed of much seed and
little succulence is not shared by the agriculturist. At half a
mile the road splits. Take the left-hand track, labelled Manningham
Road. It points straight at Macedon. The other branch, like all the
cross ways you are to encounter, leads to Templestowe, and so to
Warrandyte. The elevation is still high, and you are opening out
much picturesque country to the south as your direction becomes
more and more westerly. With the start of the down grade the
orchards dwindle and cereal crops give vivid color to the paddocks.
A very striking redgum, unusually tall for this kind of tree, has
been left in one paddock as a hint of what this country looked like
before the white man altered it to suit himself. The newly ploughed
soil here is exactly the tone you see in the gills of a
well-ripened mushroom&mdash;chocolate with a hint of pink.</p>

<p>At the next cross road you must turn to the right, and just as
decidedly to the left, all in 100 yards. The drop is now more
marked, and ahead are clearly the heights of Heidelberg. A line of
timber, largely willows and wattles, marks the course of the Yarra.
One kind of willow at present contrives to suggest a soft, but
warm, pink; the other is an Irish mixture of yellow and green. The
road angles to the right to join still another route to
Templestowe. Turn to your left at the first road coming in, and in
200 yards you will find the bridge which gives crossing to the
Heidelberg traffic. There is much promise of good wattle bloom
about it. Keep on until you reach the old city road, still with a
milestone showing Melbourne VIII. miles; go along it as far as the
historic Old England Hotel, turn up to the left there, and in half
a mile you reach Heidelberg railway station, surely one of the most
beautifully placed for views in the whole of Australia. In all you
have covered on foot no more than eight miles.</p>

<h3><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>THE LONG PADDOCK</h3>

<p class="pin30">Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open
road!<br>
Healthy, free, the world before me,<br>
The long brown path before me, leading wherever I choose!<br>
<br>
&mdash;Walt Whitman.</p>

<p>When the farmer of the back country is threatened with a
shortage of grass, he turns his bunch of poddies into what he calls
the long paddock, in other words, the road. In its miles of length
and its one, two, or three chains of width, broken only by a few
wheel-marks, they gain as much of that "fine confused feeding" as
the Scotsman discovered in the sheep's head of famous memory. There
are delightful pickings on all sides, and the feast is a constant
progress. Thus does the "long paddock" appeal to many humans,
though the banquet they find in it is the feast of reason.</p>

<p>Of the many attractive bush roads within easy reach of Melbourne
there is none more charming than the Canterbury Road. It has charm
even when it drops its country ways and becomes a staid suburban
street, for the suburbs through which it marches are all
picturesque. Properly it may be said to originate in the town. In
that case its birthplace is the corner of Burke Road, Camberwell,
at which spot it takes over business from Rathmines Road, Auburn.
It makes almost due east, to end by merging into a north and south
road connecting Bayswater and Ringwood. That gives a length of not
more than 11 miles, but the walker may cut the distance up to suit
his requirements, for the road runs parallel with a railway line,
though well out of sight of it, and there is a fair train service
and several stations.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Canterbury Pilgrimage.</p>

<p>It adds a little to start at Bayswater (most inappropriately
named of townships), but not enough to make the walk difficult.
Ringwood is the alternative. If no other day is available the
Sunday morning train to Ferntree Gully will drop you at Bayswater
by 11.30 a.m. Turn back toward town and cross the railway line at
the first road. There is a fine grove of native timber on your left
and a little winding path through it which cannot be resisted.
Otherwise you must follow the road easterly for about 200 yards (it
would take you to Sassafras if you gave way to it), and at an old
hotel turn sharply to the left, i.e., north, along the Croydon
Road. All waters here run to the Dandenong Creek. At once you cross
one of its numerous small tributaries, and almost immediately the
way is bridged for another. If you have taken the track through the
timber you come out on the highway at about this point, after a
scramble down and up the pretty banks of the creek. On your right
shoulder are the blue spurs of the Dandenongs; ahead is much
bush-land; on either side, for a time, are clearings and a few
small houses.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Junction.</p>

<p>Half a mile on, the road becomes three. To go straight ahead
would land you at Croydon in about three miles, and to alter your
direction to the right (along Norwich Road) would mean Montrose, at
the foot of Mount Dandenong, in about five. Paradoxically, the left
is the right road; it heads for Ringwood. Good trees, mostly
stringybark, shade it; here and there is a spike of heath with the
flower-buds strung along the tall shoot like beads, or with the
bloom just breaking through sufficiently to catch the eye as a note
of white or pink. Wherever a young tree has sprung up, or a stump
has put out tender branches, the gum tips are harmonies of many
tones. One understands Victor Daley's likening of young gum shoots
to "woodland altar flames." Two creeklets hint at lunch, which, it
is well to carry on this excursion. Then the track makes upwards
until you have risen 400 feet, and you find orchards all around
you. Here is the end of Canterbury Road&mdash;the beginning of it,
so far as you are concerned. It takes off to the left, at the crest
of the rise, between two houses deep in fruit trees and directly
opposite another dwelling with the name Wombalano on the gate. Here
again is a good place to lunch, if you have held out so far, for
the views are delightful.</p>

<p class="cpb">"Go West, Young Man."</p>

<p>Now you are heading for the sunset. You are on a ridge with an
altitude of 450 feet, which yields an excellent outlook on every
side. At your back is much timber and an orchard or two; on your
right side and front are rolling lands, also rich with orchards;
long slopes fall away to the left and cease only at the belt of
ranges which hide Ferntree Gully. Everywhere is the suggestion of
fruit, and in the next few miles you shall be astonished, if you do
not know this stretch of country, at the immense acreage under
orchard. In the autumn apricot leaves are pure gold, the cherry's
are reddening, other species range from green to scarlet&mdash;mass
them all before a dark background of gums or pines, with the blue
of the ranges just showing over their tops, and you have a
wonderful picture, but one common enough along this beautiful road.
Jonathans still hang like lanterns on many of the trees, and the
garden of the Hesperides was not more wonderful, with its golden
harvest, than some of the wayside orchards with quinces. The land
drops steadily&mdash;sloping (like Orion) to the west. At the
bottom of the valley is a little creek hidden in a dense growth of
the soft foliaged swamp tea tree. This might be between Nowa Nowa
and Buchan, so little does it suggest the city. Rising from it is
the steep pinch on top of which the church and school and store,
which constitute Vermont, are perched. The road surface has been
soft to this point, ready to leap into the air at the touch of a
motor. Fortunately drivers do not use this highway much, preferring
better-metalled ways.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Commination.</p>

<p>Here let me rest long enough to utter a malediction upon all
motor-driven vehicles. The motor should either be forbidden the
country roads or forced to consume its own smoke and dust. It is
the Beast foretold of Revelations. All undesirable adjuncts are its
peculiar property; noise and stench and dirt claim it for their
own. It seeks only to arrive, never to know what lies between. The
fury of its haste is heard afar off, frightening all innocent
things; the odors of the pit accompany it. It takes the road in its
hand and flings it in the face of the countryside, turning the
sweet, still evening air into a choking fog until the particles
settle on hedge and roadside garden to dim the glory of the flowers
and oppress the breathing of the gardener. Every briar berry, its
scarlet turned to ashen grey, is a silent protest. The motorist is
the only person unaffected; he hears no noise, he smells no odor,
he leaves his dust behind him. Let him beware, or hereafter he may
drive for ever and ever through the Shades, never arriving, his
speed indicator showing 80 miles an hour, the asbestos milestone at
his wheel never receding, dust enveloping him&mdash;red soil, black
soil, grey soil, the reek of burning oil constant in his nostrils.
And his car shall rattle and be insufferably noisy down the
unending aeons of Eternity. Well has the humorist said: "A
motor-car is not fit to be out of."</p>

<p class="cpb">Vermont&mdash;Home.</p>

<p>Better and better grow the views. Vermont must be nearly 500
feet high, Its outlook toward the north and west is full of charm.
It seems the home of the orchards. They slope from the road to the
flat bottom of the valley and rise in a flood up the opposing
hillside; they occupy alike the intimate and the distant prospect,
and all in their season are rich in colour. A ridge far ahead shows
the road laid against it like a ladder; in the evening light it
looks vertical. Crossing Vermont is the L.L. road, named after the
late Dr. L. L. Smith. It runs on to Mitcham railway station, a mile
and a half away. In a little over a mile further along the
Canterbury Road you reach Spring Vale Road, and within the next two
miles are tracks leading respectively to Blackburn and Box Hill. It
is worth while continuing west to see the last of the sun from the
ridge at the Surrey Hills reservoir, one, of the highest points
within 10 miles of Melbourne, and to glance back over the country
through which you have come. Then it is all downhill to Canterbury
station.</p>

<h3><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>THE DANDENONGS</h3>

<p class="pin10">I sing of the sweetness of gravel, good, sharp
quartz-grit. Many a human gizzard would be cured of half its ills
by a suitable daily allowance of it. It spurs to action. The foot
tastes it and henceforth rests not.<br>
<br>
&mdash;John Burroughs.</p>

<p>The Dandenongs should be a national park. Melbourne's fairy
godmother would have made a million peole a gift of incalculable
value had she endowed the city with the freedom of that blue range
lying only 20 miles away on the eastern horizon. The portion from
Mount Dandenong (known to the old maps as Mount Corhanwarabul) to
Ferntree Gully would do, for it embraces the best of the hills and
a large proportion of the good gullies and creeks. It is true that
Victoria already has a National Park, and one of no mean acreage or
attraction. But it is formed of Wilson's Promontory, and might be
in another State, so difficult is it of access. Its charming bays
with their gently shelving beaches of firm sand up which the
breakers race to provide as good surf-bathing as anything on the
Sydney side, its lofty hills and bold headlands, the clear creeks
in which the tidal processions of the fish may be daily witnessed,
its wide moorlands and rocky knobs, its forests where 10,000 native
bears are, believably, said to live&mdash;these things are unknown
to practically all the owners, and may remain so for many a year.
The Dandenongs, on the other hand, are at our doors. Settlement has
made it much too late to hope that the reservation at the One Tree
Hill end shall ever be materially added to; one must draw what
consolation he may from the fact that so much of that settlement is
designed to bring the city man out of doors and make him at least
"week-end" in the healthful bush. With a hut on one of the numerous
creeks the walker has an almost unlimited range of fine outings.
And, thanks to a fair train service, the townsman with no local
habitation can also enjoy this good country and be at home at
nightfall, if a single day is his limit.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Natural Gateway.</p>

<p>He who would see the Dandenongs must avoid Dandenong. That
pleasant little township is completely out of the picture. It finds
no place on the locality map issued by the Tourist Bureau (an
excellent map, by the way, and one that every walker should
possess) because it is altogether away from the main range whose
name it shares. Mount Dandenong itself is as far removed from the
town of Dandenong as it can be and yet remain part of the
Dandenongs. The natural gateways are Croydon and Mooroolbark, on
the Healesville line, Bayswater and Upper Ferntree Gully on the
Ferntree Gully branch. They are all easy enough to enter. Fifty-one
years ago James Hingston wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ferntree Gully&mdash;but twenty miles from Melbourne, and so
little known! All these pretty waterfalls constantly on view and
none to admire them. The route can be found by going along the St.
Kilda Road to the Junction, then turn to the left and along the
Dandenong Road to Oakleigh, and there take the road which branches
to the left at the turnpike gate. Nine miles of this track brings
you to the foot of the gully."</p>

<p>He added, in a cautionary note, that it would be well to make
sure you were on the right track by inquiring at The Cheshire
Cheese en route. Like Moliere's doctor, "We have changed all that."
Roads and trains between them carry thousands of people every fine
Sunday and holiday to the Gully and other picturesque points.</p>

<p class="cpb">Croydon to Ferntree Gully.</p>

<p>If you desire an outing which will serve to sample these hills
and will indubitably whet your appetite for more, devote a day to
the road from Croydon to "the Gully." The reverse order is equally
good, but you gain daylight, owing to the railway arrangements, by
starting at the Croydon end. The 19 miles may be reduced, so far as
walking is concerned, by taking the motor (at the cost of about a
shilling) over the flat three miles to Montrose. That brings you to
the foot of Mount Dandenong, which has beckoned all the way, a
lovely sight on a fair day, and now towers right above you. There
is a short stretch of level going under the trees, and then the old
road starts to zig-zag, aiming at the Devil's Elbow, 1500 feet up.
The gradient is not distressing. Variety may be gained by taking
one of the short cuts which will be seen going off to the right,
but the climb along any of these is much stiffer. If you have stuck
to the road follow the curve of the Elbow round to the right, and
you are in the Gap. This yields pleasant views, and is worth
pausing over, even if you are not breathless. At this point joins
in the new (the main motor) road, which, at Montrose, flings its
leisurely loops round the northern and eastern curves of the hill.
The junction is known as Five Ways; the little settlement has
recently changed its name from Mount Dandenong North to Kalorama.
Do not take the left hand track near the church, nor yet the next
road on the same side, but cling to the vehicle road which steers
most to the right. It brings you nearest to the Observatory (2077
feet), by which name the top of Mount Dandenong is popularly known.
Keep a close watch, and you will find, a little over a mile from
the Gap, at least two signs indicating tracks to the top. That is
only a few hundred yards away to the west, and the view should not
be missed. Provision in the way of water and a shelter shed has
been made, so lunch may be had in comfort while contemplating the
distant panorama of the Bay, of Mount Macedon, of all the
undulating country in between, and of the bigger ranges about
Healesville and Warburton. You have done eight miles from
Croydon.</p>

<p class="cpb">Loveliness at Large.</p>

<p>Even better views of the high peaks from St. Leonard to Donna
Buang present themselves from the track as the walk is resumed.
Indeed, this is one of the loveliest outlooks that I know. Some old
trees indicate what a regiment of giants stood here before
settlement. Presently the slope is westward, and very beautiful are
the glimpses of cultivated valleys and closely timbered hillsides.
Soon a road comes in from the left, and a slight rise brings Olinda
(3 miles) into sight. There is an hotel here (or just a little way
out) and innumerable boarding-houses. Avoid the deviation that
takes off to the east, and make for Sassafras, nearly two miles
away, another place where accommodation is easy to get. The going
is admirable, altogether too good in one way, for on a fine Sunday
every mile has its motor. Petrol does not improve the scents of the
bushland. He is hard to please who cannot find keen enjoyment in
the valley views as the sidings bring him above Sassafras Creek and
later feed his eye with placid pictures of the distant bay. The
headland by Frankston, the blunt rise of Mount Martha beyond
Mornington, and the still greater mass of Dromana's guardian peak,
Arthur's Seat, are clearly outlined and much coastal detail may be
picked out. From certain points Westernport is also plainly
visible.</p>

<p>Favour still the right-hand ways (unless they take a sharp
westerly turn) and you will find yourself presently on the top of
One Tree Hill, where there are a couple of refreshment rooms and a
rest house. A few hundred yards away is a look-out tower, which
must now be ascended. The prospect it commands is magnificent. Tea
could be had here or at the township down below for you are now at
the head of the famous gully, and not more than two miles from the
station. It is idle to attempt a description of the Gully itself. I
shall only say that, despite its extreme popularity, it is still
worth visiting.</p>

<p class="cpb">Side Issues.</p>

<p>All the way there have been little or big tracks meandering off
into the forest or down distracting gullies, each looking over its
shoulder at you as it disappears, and tempting you to follow. Every
last least one of them is worth following. But don't take my word
for it; try it for yourself&mdash;as the American said when he
quoted "Honesty is the best policy." Whether you trail the tourist
track from Sassafras to Paradise, or take the longer road from
Olinda through Nathania Springs and Monbulk to Emerald, or explore
the Sherbrooke Falls (where with the most ordinary luck you shall
hear a lyre-bird) and entrain at Belgrave, or reach Sassafras by
way of Bayswater or do any one of the many other trips of this
locality you will find it good.</p>

<h3><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>SHERBROOKE</h3>

<p class="pin40">There is a river in the range<br>
I love to think about...<br>
<br>
&mdash;Kendall.</p>

<p>Autumn is often very good to us with a long succession of sunny,
windless days, and that absence of rain which makes many walks
still possible along paths that winter turns into gutters and
creeklets. The consideration that the weather is probably too dry
and "summery" for the general good need not stop us from making the
best of it.</p>

<p>In autumn particularly, but indeed at most times, it will be
found delightful to take such an outing as that from Belgrave to
Sherbrooke Falls, and across to One Tree Hill above Ferntree Gully.
It can be done quietly, on a Sunday, between the arrival of the
train at Belgrave, about half an hour after noon, and the departure
of one homeward from "the Gully" at 6.35 p.m. Altogether, the
distance need not exceed nine miles, though it may be made as much
more as one chooses, for there are many side paths worth
exploring.</p>

<p class="cpb">"The Glory of the Garden."</p>

<p>The Lilliputian train into which you change at the Gully fusses
along the sidings through a welter of green timber until it is high
above the valley. It chases its tail, "like a cat at play," round
numberless curves, to rest at last, "pleased and panting," at a
little station to which you must step down, for there is no
platform in the ordinary sense. The size of the station is no index
of the population, least of all at a week-end. The bush here is
full of cottages; they peep out from clearings everywhere, and many
of them add to the picturesqueness of the scene. But it is safe to
predict that, with land selling at £11 a foot, the dwellings will
soon be elbowing each other and the glory gone.</p>

<p>At present the place is a garden and, fortunately, you pass
through the best of it. On the hillside above the station
Belgrave's extraordinary main street ties itself into knots, its
origin possibly suggested in Chesterton's</p>

<p class="pin10">Before the Roman crossed the Wye or o'er the
Severn strode,<br>
The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road.</p>

<p>Follow it round to the north-east and north, and from the bend
you will look right over some roofs, tucked away in native greens,
down in the busy little Monbulk Creek. Well up the slope across the
creek a plantation of deciduous trees makes a brave show, its
colours ranging from the palest of pale gold to the most
distinctive scarlet.</p>

<p>On your left rises the hill, cut and terraced, and gay with
gardens; straight ahead two old-time gums mark the edge of the
highway. At a corner there is a wonderful mixture of native and
exotic trees. Some fine blackwoods jostle an equally well-grown
oak, the vividly-toned berries of a rowan tree, and the even
brighter leaves of a sumach, neighbour a fine tree fern and some
gully musks, and a blanketwood lifts its Rackham-like branches
toward a shapely tulip-tree. Handsome houses perch here and there
on the slopes. While convention has dictated most of the names, it
is refreshing to notice, "Kookaburra" on one gate.</p>

<p class="cpb">Artists' Scenery.</p>

<p>Monbulk Creek supplies the falls you are on your way to visit.
You cross it in the valley, and almost at once shake off the
township, for you are now on the edge of a State forest. The road
winds, there are thick banks of undergrowth on each side, and
towering gums help to make the kind of picture many of our artists
are fond of. There is one stretch which strongly suggests John Ford
Paterson. At a mile from the station take a left-hand track, marked
"Sherbrooke Falls, two miles," and you are in a new world
immediately. Gone are the metalled road and the open sky; your
going is now the soft earth in which the landcrabs love to burrow;
overhead is a roof of wattle and hazel, mintbush and musk.</p>

<p>The ubiquitous creek welcomes a tributary at this point, and you
cross it. Within a hundred yards is a prepared picnic ground, with
rustic tables and seats. I have heard lyre-birds calling near here
many times. The track moves upward between green walls, made firm
in places by tough wire grass. If you think, misled by the
stillness, that there are no birds awake, keep still for five
minutes. A few big trees stand sentinel by the way or give vistas
along their stems as they lie dead in the scrub. A melodious little
spring is crossed, its voice, like the blue wren's, out of all
proportion to its size. Just beyond is a notice-board inviting you
to visit the Fern Bower, but there will be time enough for that
when lunch is over. That may soon be had, for fireplaces and other
conveniences are close at hand. It has been an easy hour's walk to
this spot, at the head of the falls. Around and above you, as you
sit, are tall gums and wattles; a lyrebird is, almost certain to be
singing, smaller birds will play Lazarus to your Dives, and the
running water will furnish its soft accompaniment&mdash;"the beauty
born of murmuring sound."</p>

<p class="cpb">Contemporary of Noah.</p>

<p>The falls are near the crest of the hill, some 1600 feet above
sea level. They are not wonderful in themselves, but their setting
is beautiful, and well-kept paths afford opportunity to see
everything. The tree ferns are particularly lovely, and many other
handsome growths flourish luxuriantly in this place of continual
moisture. An interesting snail, presumably a native, may be met
with. Never was a more highly polished ebony shell, and the
creature itself is a striking object, its back being a deep black
and its edges and underside a gay pink. Much time may be spent
here, but presently you must depart. Still with the ripple of the
water at your side, make for what is known as the Giant Tree. A
finger post will set you right. After about a mile of varied and
interesting tracks, the tree will be found lying, as it has lain
since when the memory of man (in the legal phrase) runneth not to
the contrary. It is indeed a huge specimen, worthy to stand even
among those famous Sequoias of which California is so proud. I have
heard no calculation of its age. A layman, awed by its bulk,
suggested that it possibly sprang from a seed left by Noah's flood.
Standing on the tree, you can hear the motors purring on a main
thoroughfare, and, following a shaded track, you soon come out on
the Sassafras Road, near Ferny Creek.</p>

<p>Heading now for Ferntree Gully, the old road, higher up the
hill, will be found even more attractive than the new one, and you
have the advantage of losing the motor dust. When it has passed the
Ferny Creek post-office, it dips and joins the up-to-date road for
a few hundred yards. Rounding a curve, you will notice a red-clay
cart track making up a slope to the right. It brings you to the top
of the ridge, and keeps you there till the summit of One Tree Hill
appears before you, and there is only the length of the famous
gully, still well worth seeing, between you and the railway
station.</p>

<h3><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>EVELYN TO BELGRAVE</h3>

<p class="pin30">Mountains are the beginning and the end of all
natural scenery.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Ruskin.</p>

<p>Whether you agree or not with Ruskin's characteristically
dogmatic assertion, there is no denying the charm of mountain
scenery. Never can it be monotonous, for it holds always the
element of surprise. No range of hills was ever what it seemed from
a distance; to pluck out the heart of its mystery you must become
intimate, a friend or a lover. As you approach the seemingly solid
mass, it usually resolves itself into a series of separate ranges,
with foothills leading up to them. "Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps
on Alps arise," as Pope has it. And when you essay to put them
underfoot you find a confusion of gullies and spurs and saddles and
peaks that keeps your mind alert and tests thoroughly your physical
condition.</p>

<p>To the tourist, using the track surveyed and beaten for him, the
crossing naturally presents no especial difficulties, and
consequently suggests none. But let him attempt a direct passage
which scorns all existing paths, and he will speak with respect for
evermore of the men who made the earliest highway in the hills and
with absolute reverence for those first men of all&mdash;the
pioneers.</p>

<p class="cpb">East and South-East.</p>

<p>You shall look in vain now for the name Evelyn in the railway
guide. Contrary to all railway practice, the title has been
enlarged, and the pretty little station is now labelled Mount
Evelyn. Presumably this is because of its 738 feet of elevation
above the sea level, an elevation which seems more important than
it is because most of it is gained in the last few miles. What
constitutes a hill and what a mountain is as debatable as the vexed
question (a recurring decimal in library circles) of where a
pamphlet ends and a book begins. If Evelyn is entitled to "Mount,"
what should be prefaced to the name of Glen Innes railway station,
in New South Wales, which takes the air at 3500 feet? It is all
purely relative. Just as among the blind the one-eyed is king, so
in flat country an ant-hill may pass for a pyramid.</p>

<p>There are many good walks with Evelyn as a "jumping-off place."
One which yields great variety is that to Belgrave by way of Olinda
Falls and the Lookout Rock. In it you may sample main roads, bush
roads and tourist tracks and indulge the eye with views as wide as
the horizon or as circumscribed as the narrow limits of a fern
gully. Should the weather prove wet you may keep altogether to the
high road and still arrive.</p>

<p>As you leave Mount Evelyn station keep along the road past the
store, cross the line, and turn to your right. You are aiming at
South Wandin, otherwise known as Silvan. The road is broad and well
made. Within half a mile it forks into two. The left branch makes
for Wandin, Seville, and eventually Warburton; it is the right hand
you must follow. Almost at once you pass the State school. The fall
of the land is to the north and north-east, and as your general
direction is, for a time, south-easterly, you get good views of the
ranges that divide the valley of the Watts from that of the Yarra.
Although there is no natural indication of the fact, you are
walking parallel with the course of Olinda Creek, but you are
travelling up-stream. A notice-board at one point bears the
alluring sign: "To Honeymoon Island."</p>

<p class="cpb">A Sharp Turn.</p>

<p>At a little over three miles, and just after passing Queen's
road (which takes off on the left for Wandin), you leave the main
road by a buggy track doubling back sharply to the right. If you
have any doubt, inquire at the Silvan post-office, which stands
near the corner. It is good forest country and a downhill grade as
you start upon this westerly track. Stony Ford bridge spans a
branch of the Olinda, where there is a junction of two tributaries,
and the site is such a delightful one that, if the hour prove
suitable, here is the very spot for lunch. Possibly you will find
that rich bottom a trifle muddy at certain times of the year. Stout
boots are advised, with a pair of socks in the knapsack, to put on
when Belgrave is reached.</p>

<p>There is often a patch of autumn colouring in a deserted garden
near here that shows in the green of the bush like a burst of
sunlight. Several small watercourses feeding the main creek are
crossed, and there are a good many small tracks coming in. Keep to
the obvious way until two bridges break the road in quick
succession, and, just past the second one, look for a narrow path
going up the creek side.</p>

<p class="cpb">Fern and Musk.</p>

<p>At once there is a hint of that gully scent which is so subtle
and so characteristic. It would make an Australian who knows his
bush lift a questing nose anywhere.</p>

<p class="pin10">Scents are stronger than sounds or sights<br>
To make your heart-strings crack,</p>

<p>sang Rudyard Kipling of our wattle, and the odour of the gullies
strikes me as even more peculiarly our especial property. It seems
compounded mainly of musk and Christmas bush, and about July that
lovely winter bloomer, the sassafras, will add its wealth of
sweetness to the general stock. When, in the short days, you get a
stronger scent than usual in the shades of the creek bed, search
first for creamy bells on the ground, then look up to where they
hang under the leaves of the sassafras, hiding so carefully that
few people seem to know that this handsome tree flowers at all. By
this token you shall know, too, that the lyre-bird is nesting, for
our great singer, and mocker of other birds, considers the season
of short days and cold wet nights a suitable time to commence
housekeeping.</p>

<p>The track, never very wide and occasionally rather slippery,
winds with the stream under ferns and blackwood and other growths,
through which tower huge eucalypts. It is a well-kept path with
seats placed at points of vantage. A mile of this and the
unimposing but attractive Olinda Falls may be viewed. A westerly
track from here would take you to Mount Dandenong in a couple of
miles; another, making south, climbs a ridge, dips into a couple of
gullies, and by a ferny siding brings you to the foot of the
Lookout Rock. This commands the Yarra Valley and the great bulk of
Donna Buang, and all her attendant peaks and spurs. The outlook
would be better were there fewer trees in the immediate
foreground.</p>

<p class="cpb">Olinda&mdash;Belgrave.</p>

<p>From the Rock it is only a few hundred yards to the Mernda Road
and the heart of Olinda. Turn to your left as you strike the main
thoroughfare, and keep to the ridge. A track branches off very
soon, still further to the left, but it is no affair of yours
to-day. At slightly over a mile you will be rewarded for any
exertion you have put into this outing by a view which I have no
hesitation in pronouncing the most charming within 50 miles of
Melbourne. You stand on the edge of a descent which faces north and
east. Below you are the tiny squares of many colours marking out
the farm lands of The Patch and Monbulk. Belts of timber and green
fields succeed each other until blue masses of mountain, in
infinite variety, close the prospect. Wonderful at any hour, this
scene is perhaps best in late afternoon, when the level light from
the west shines full upon the mountain slopes. Tear yourself away
and watch now for a steep cart-track going off to the right. It is
little better than a horse pad, but is about half a chain wide.
Turn to the left when it touches a similar track near a creek, and
you will find yourself at Begley's Bridge, three miles by a good
road from Belgrave station. At the outside, your distance for the
day has been 15 miles.</p>

<h3><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>BERWICK TO BELGRAVE</h3>

<p class="pin40">Hark in the city, street on street,<br>
A roaring reach of death and life,<br>
Of vortices that clash and fleet<br>
And ruin in appointed strife.<br>
Hark to it calling, calling clear,<br>
Calling until you cannot stay<br>
From dearer things than your own most dear<br>
Over the hills and far away.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Henley.</p>

<p>Travelling on railway lines, and on railway lines only, breeds
some strange geographical ideas if the traveller has no local
knowledge and fails to study the map. Take a ticket to Berwick, and
you find yourself breaking free from the other systems at Caulfield
and launched on "the Gippsland line." You have your day and return,
and it is almost a certainty that there has not once been a hint of
the existence of such places as Ferntree Gully and the stations
along the line to Gembrook. When, later, you run out to one of
those popular resorts, there is nothing to remind you of your other
trip. It is a fair chance that, as you regard the two in
retrospect, they seem no more connected than, say, Whittlesea and
Mordialloc. The fact that you took' a different train to each is
quite enough to separate them.</p>

<p>So the proposal to walk across from one line to the other in the
short limits of a Sunday afternoon generally has in it a dash of
surprise. The usual question "How far?" conceals some apprehension
if the inquirer knows his friends to be of that bustling type which
scorns distance and adopts as its motto "We'll get through
somehow." The answer may increase the surprise, for the distance is
really very short. If one could go as the black swan flies he would
find it no more than 10 miles. Even following the crooked ways of
man one can get from Berwick to Aura or Paradise in something
approximating that distance, to Belgrave in about a dozen miles,
and to Ferntree Gully in a very little more.</p>

<p class="cpb">Train Times Uncertain.</p>

<p>To quote the railway time-table is risky. Get the latest
information the day before. To give a general idea of how the time
cuts out it may be mentioned that the Sunday train for Berwick
leaves the city about 11, arriving an hour and a half later, and
that the homeward trains run on the Fern-tree Gully line up to,
roughly, 8 o'clock. While the times given are approximate only,
there is one thing definite: at least seven hours are available for
the walk. Taken on the long days they are seven hours of daylight.
If you carry a small billy, skilfully camouflaged with brown paper
to avoid hurting the feelings of such Sabbatarians as you may
encounter, lunch may very agreeably be had out of doors, or, if
that is too much trouble to prepare, a good meal may be obtained at
a local hotel before the road is taken from Berwick. About the same
amount of time will go to either.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Lovely Lane.</p>

<p>It will probably be 2 o'clock when you leave the dining-room, if
you have lunched indoors. Let us assume (as the schoolmaster says)
that Belgrave is your objective. The road leads out due north; keep
it until at, roughly, three miles another goes off westerly. This
takes you, in rather better than a mile, to a house called
"Tyrone," at Old Narre Warren. Some very fine bluegums distinguish
the road here. Make a northerly turn (that is, to the right) along
a lane with high hawthorn hedges, which present a magnificent sight
in the spring, for they are veritable banks of bloom, and they grow
without restraint. At the foot of the lane is a creek rich in
wattles and the soft-foliaged swamp tea-tree, and in their season
orchids and other wild flowers are plentiful. Altogether a choice
corner, and particularly so in September and October. The land has
been undulating all the way, some of the hills, though all of the
lesser degree, yielding pleasant and fairly extensive views.</p>

<p class="cpb">Leave the Road.</p>

<p>Now there is a pull-up bearing north-westerly towards a house.
It is as well to leave the road here and go north across the
paddocks for a mile, then up a private road that runs by a house on
the hill. Go down the hill and over a flat, on which grow rushes
and tea-tree, and climb still another hill on which there are some
large granite boulders, as well as a house. At the back is a road
leading north to a junction with another road. Pursuing the more
elusive "pad," go through the slip panels at this point and aim
northeasterly through the scrub at a house set about, as so many
are in this district, with pine trees. This place is three miles
from Belgrave station. Continue past the house, and by a foot-track
north-easterly to the main road, which follow. Presently a good
running stream (probably the Monbulk Creek, which helps to supply
the Dandenong reservoir) is crossed, and naturally suggests a camp
for tea.</p>

<p class="cpb">In To Belgrave.</p>

<p>Past the bridge Mount Morton is seen to the left, and the
reservoir just referred to is on your right. By half-past six or
thereabouts, supposing that you did not stay at the creek for tea,
you will have finished a pleasant little pilgrimage, accomplished
without haste. You will probably have an hour in which to get a
meal before the train appears.</p>

<h3><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>PAKENHAM AND BEACONSFIELD</h3>

<p class="pin30">The highway marches sturdily to market town and
mill,<br>
But I would find a little road that loiters up a hill,&mdash;<br>
A little vagrant woodland road, gray-ribboned through the
green,<br>
Where berry brambles bar the way and orchard elders lean.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Margaret Lee Ashley.</p>

<p>The Sunday train to Pakenham gives glimpses of several
interesting places in its two hours' journey from the city. It
leaves Flinders Street at 11.5 a.m. (again let me stress the
importance of checking all train times quoted) and drops you at
Pakenham at a nice hour for lunch. As Caulfield is passed through,
the racecourse takes the eye to revive memories, more or less
pleasant, of Cups and cross-country championships, to say nothing
of the skylarks which sing overhead there on the crisp spring days.
Building has changed this countryside vastly in the last few years,
and cne looks in vain now for any trace of the old sugar works
which used to stand out prominently to the east. The name of the
founder was rightly applied to the settlement, and the railway
station was also known as Rosstown, but a new generation arose
which knew not Joseph, and the place has become Carnegie.</p>

<p>There is still plenty of open land a little further on, always
with a patch of the glorious yellow of the gorse showing,
regardless of season. "When the gorse is not in bloom, kissing is
out of fashion," says an old proverb. Directly Oakleigh is passed,
the train plunges into the bush, the solid market township of
Dandenong is passed through in a few miles, and at one o'clock you
are in Pakenham, which is capable of providing a meal if you have
not brought it with you.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Highway.</p>

<p>You have, at the outside, 15 miles to go, and you have six and a
half hours in which to do them. Keep on the north side of the
railway line and walk through the township in, roughly, a westerly
direction, along the Gippsland Road. It is of the generous width
our forefathers loved to give main roads in the early days. A
metalled highway in the centre provides a good surface for
vehicles; the rest is soft earth or grass, in which the succulent
mushroom shines in its season. The flats all about are rich in
mushrooms at their appointed time, and a taste for the vagabond
life may be made profitable by camping out and gathering them.
Walking through this district in March, I found a comfortable camp
on a little creek, a horse munching his feed near by, and the two
owners engaged in grading mushrooms to send to Melbourne by the
next "up" train. They had a covered cart, in which they moved up
and down the roads, and which served them as bedroom on rough
nights.</p>

<p>About a mile out of Pakenham a road goes off to the right to
Gembrook. Just beyond it is Bourke's hotel on the corner of the
Toomuc Valley Road, also branching off at a sharp angle to the
north. The creek is pleasant here, and there is a grassy flat and
some trees. If you have materials for an al fresco lunch, this is
the place to have it.</p>

<p class="cpb">Toomuc Valley.</p>

<p>It must be an excellent valley, if only (like the curate's egg)
in parts. Onions and potatoes were plentiful in certain cleared
portions earlier in the autumn, and one puzzling crop proved to be
millet. Bushland, on the whole, predominates. Occasionally a road
goes off, some of them well-used, but your way is that of the
obvious main road. Presently you will be aware of a clear metallic
"tink" from the bushes, and then another and another, until by and
by there is a full orchestra going, and you will realise that you
are listening to the bell-bird. He is an olive-green little fellow,
about the size of a sparrow, and so much in harmony with his
surroundings that he is difficult to see. When once you pick him
out you will find, most likely, that he is busy eating scale off
the gum leaves. A substantial orchard on your left is full of
ooloured leaves at present, but it is possible there is young fruit
also in this "Indian summer," when the blackberries at the wayside
are showing at once fresh flower, matured fruit, and the stained
leaves of autumn, and a hedge has a nice crop of baby
cherry-plums.</p>

<p>More bush and scrub, and then the Toomuc Valley Orchard comes
into view. It is rather a wonderful place, and when the apples are
on the trees the sight is very beautiful. It is well to inquire
here for a track which passes through the orchard, and for
permission to use it.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Vagrant Woodland Way.</p>

<p>If it is autumn there cannot be much fruit on the trees under
which you pass, and you will be reminded of Shelley's</p>

<p class="pin10">And the leaves, brown, yellow and gray and
red,<br>
And white with the whiteness of what is dead,<br>
Like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed.</p>

<p>The orderly line of trees follow you up a hill, from which you
get extensive views. At the top is a house with pines about it.
Keep it on the left, go through a fence, and pursue a narrow path
up a further slope. The tendency is to bear round to the left, and
this persists for a considerable distance, the track being rather
poorly defined in places, and often splitting up. Toomuc Valley
Orchard is some five miles from Pakenham, and Upper Beaconsfield,
at which you are now aiming, is by this route about 4½ miles from
the Orchard. This part is famous for its heath, coming to the
fulness of its bloom about May. The characteristic summits of the
Beaconsfield district now show their gardens and tufts of pines.
Some of the latter have recently fallen victim to the demand for
timber, and it is no uncommon sight to see a row of stumps, like
ugly teeth, marking the spot where formerly stood a line of
graceful trees. Your westering track comes out on a broad
thoroughfare opposite the site of an old house where the pines have
been so treated.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Downhill Finish.</p>

<p>Turn to the left, and after some rising and falling the road
will take you past the Split Rock and up a final pinch into Upper
Beaconsfield. It is a reposeful village, made picturesque by
position and the judicious planting of timber trees. Pass along its
principal street until the post-office is seen. Near it a good road
turns off to the left, making down hill to the flat whereon the
train runs. The gradient is excellent, and if you come to a split
in the way there is no need to worry, for the division is healed
later on. Probably the least interesting portion of the walk is
from the foot of the descent to the Beaconsfield Station, for you
are now on the level, and it seems flat, in a double sense, after
so much hill work. The train for the city leaves about half-past
seven, and reaches Melbourne about 9 p.m.</p>

<h3><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>A STRIP OF BEACH</h3>

<p class="pin35">Blue water, ruffled by the breeze,<br>
And merging towards an azure sky,<br>
Flanked by red cliffs, dark draped with trees,<br>
That darker spots of shade supply.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Geoffrey Wall.</p>

<p>If you have a liking for wide views from the level, the kind of
view that you get on the great Riverina plains, but with the
difference that this field is mainly water, a mirror on a day of
perfect stillness, an everchanging picture when a wind is abroad,
then find time for a stroll from Carrum to Beaumaris. Standing at
the mouth of Carrum Creek and looking northerly, you gain the
impression of being on the shore of a bay within the Bay, so
pronounced is the inward curve of the sandy beach and so marked the
swing round to Rickett's Point. The latter stands right across the
view, hiding Hobson's Bay completely, and making, with its line of
dark, tree-covered cliffs, a sharp contrast with the flat stretches
of snowy sand which lead towards it. It is a short walk, for Carrum
station is about eight miles from the Beaumaris Hotel, but it
yields fair variety and has the advantage of being possible in any
weather. Should more be desired, an additional two and a half miles
of pleasant cliff walking will take you to the electric tram
terminus at Black Rock.</p>

<p class="cpb">Outward.</p>

<p>There are many trains to Carrum. The 1.10 p.m. from the city on
Saturday, arriving at 2.18, leaves ample daylight, even on the
shortening days, to get through, but none to linger on. The Sunday
10.40 a.m. yields a more generous allowance. Without certain
knowledge, I am of the opinion that fires are now forbidden on the
beach, so a thermos flask filled with tea may be found a useful
adjunct to the knapsack lunch. There are many tea-rooms, however,
in the first five miles. It is only necessary to walk a few yards
off the beach to reach one.</p>

<p>Of the country passed through in the train, the general
impression, after Glen Huntly, is that of vegetable gardens.
Orderly acres of onions, blue-green in the mass, the deep-red tones
of beet, and innumerable cabbages and cauliflowers showing just now
the tender green of the young leaf, make an agreeable blend. Here
and there is a patch of the original scrub and tea-tree, as near
Highett; and just beyond Cheltenham there is a delightful paddock
of low-spreading eucalypts on the east of the line. All along this
flat country good views of the Dandenongs may be obtained.</p>

<p>The sea is close at hand after Mentone, only a narrow belt of
coastal timber dividing it from the railway. At Mordialloc it comes
boldly into the picture, a flash of sky-blue water and white sand
as the bridge is crossed. The outstanding need of our beaches is
shade, and the astounding growth of settlement between Mordialloc
and Carrum threatens seriously the fine tea-tree tract that edges
this perfect beach. Carrum comes with another sudden glimpse
seaward at the creek mouth, and you may begin your walk.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Perfect Path.</p>

<p>Turn back along the main street, for you must re-cross the creek
before seeking the sea edge. As with most of our southern streams,
the water is dammed back by a sand-bar and forms a placid little
lake of some length, but no great breadth. It serves to shelter a
few boats. You may observe here the original of the Shirlow etching
known as Carrum Bridge. Keep the waterside to the beach and, given
a bright day, you will assuredly be pleased by the prospect. On
your left the creek "runs somewhere safe to sea" over the far edge
of the sandbank; from it the eye is carried on by long miles of
shelving sand, bounded on one side by pale-green shallows, and on
the other by a dark line of timber, until the rising lands of
Frankston, their outlines made wonderful by the autumn haze, curve
round to Schnapper Point, with the more distant elevations of
Arthur's Seat standing above it.</p>

<p>Look out to sea. The shallows hold many beautiful tones, the
deeper water provides at once a beauty of its own and a contrast in
its dark purple blues. Anglers are out after flathead, and their
boats dot the horizon. Swing round to your right and you will be
facing the way you are to go. Whistler would have painted the scene
at your back and called it by some such title as A Symphony or
Mother of Pearl. The glamor is not so great ahead, but it is
attractive enough, and the going on the fine well-packed sand is
very good. The low sandhills on your right, and the growths on
them, keep the houses from being intrusive.</p>

<p class="cpb">Small Things.</p>

<p>Ruskin has remarked somewhere&mdash;"By the wisdom of Nature it
has been appointed that more pleasure may be taken in small things
than in great." This beach is not rich in flotsam or jetsam, but
there are "small things" in plenty to take the eye and arouse
speculation. One larger than most is the remains of an old vessel
almost buried in the sand. I remember it years ago as a prominent
object; now some rusty bolts hold together a few stout timbers just
above the general level. Large oyster shells occur fairly
frequently, recalling the little-known fact that these bivalves
were once plentiful in the Bay, so plentiful that portions of the
St. Kilda foreshore, it is said, were granted as oyster leases in
the early days. It is likely that beds of the mud oyster still
exist and only await dredging.</p>

<p>Two kinds of jelly fish are common among the stranded objects. A
small variety, sausage-shaped, but suggesting, in its clear beauty,
the rare confection of some cunning cook, is not as numerous as the
big umbrella-shaped creatures with the fringe of snaky-looking
tentacles recalling the locks of the Gorgon Medusa. Their green and
blue circles shine from the sand everywhere. A notice warning you
not to destroy the marram grass, which has been planted here,
"gives you furiously to think" for a few minutes: one does not
expect to find himself within the boundaries of the Shire of
Dandenong. A few shells have come ashore, a piece of a gleaming
scarlet substance like coral in appearance, but soft as sponge, one
or two sharks' eggs, their spirals looking like coarse seaweed, and
numberless specimens of those smooth, sandy structures which
resemble the half of a bottomless cup are present. A bee is lying
on his back in the damp, waving feeble legs in the air; small
winged things, of the type of the house fly, rise ahead of you,
await your next step, and repeat the process endlessly.</p>

<p class="cpb">Cliff Walking.</p>

<p>All the time the cliffs are coming nearer. You pass at the rear
of Chelsea and Aspendale, where the scrub is so full of houses that
the general effect is that of a maze; but the only sign of their
presence from the sea is the long row of bathing boxes and boat
houses. The sand here is much cut up and disturbed, mainly by the
idle industry of children. Immediately ahead is Mordialloc pier,
and as the creek flows in beside that structure you go up some two
or three hundred yards to the bridge on the main road. The name
Mordialloc is said to be a union of two native words, Mordi and
Yallock, meaning short creek, but Saxton, in his "Victorian Place
Names," gives the significance as "near the little sea." Once past
it, turn to the left and you will find the sandy beach is giving
out, to be replaced gradually by shingle. The walking there is
consequently not so good, but the going will be found excellent in
the narrow reserve, where, by the way, the Council or local
residents should certainly plant some tea-tree, sheoaks and
honeysuckle for shade purposes.</p>

<p>Cliffs are now forming, and as they increase in height the
growths improve. Our most beautiful coastal shrub, the tea-tree, is
seen to advantage, and under it are grassy spaces with small mauve
daisies and patches of red-tipped pigface.</p>

<p>Fifty feet below, the beach is sandy again, a broad clean sweep
that gives a very gradual approach into the water. A mud island or
two, of the same composition as the cliff, suggest that these soft
walls are receding before the action of wind and tide. This portion
of the walk is particularly delightful, both for the charm of the
tracks which wind through the scrub, and the attractive outlook.
The height increases, you dip down past the entrance to a pier and
up again, and you find you are in the angle from which springs the
headland where Beaumaris stands and which has Rickett's Point as
its apex. The view back embraces the line of red and gold cliffs, a
white pier breaking the two blues of the ocean, the long fringe of
clean sand stretching on to Frankston, and the hazy hills
beyond.</p>

<p>A marked change occurs here in the character of the cliffs. They
seem of sterner stuff and the sea washes their stony bases, leaving
no room for beaches. Rickett's Point is a mass of ironstone, and
the geologists tell us that that is why it stands to-day where it
does, while the softer coast on either side has been fretted
away.</p>

<p>From the Beaumaris Hotel corner a conveyance will carry you to
Sandringham or Cheltenham, or you may catch the electric tram at
Black Rock at the end of another short stage.</p>

<h2>TWO OR THREE DAY WALKS</h2>

<h3><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>THE ROCK (BEN CAIRN) AND DONNA
BUANG</h3>

<p class="pin40">My heart turns to high places...<br>
<br>
&mdash;Dorothea Mackellar.</p>

<p>The first generation of our native-born not only "learnt from
their wistful mothers to call old England 'Home,'" but many of them
gathered from over-patriotic fathers the conviction that everything
was immeasurably greater or finer in the British Isles than
anything Nature could produce here. The mavis and the lark sang
across the years songs that were sweeter by far than those which
the magpie and the harmonious thrush were pouring forth so
liberally, the scent of the violet was richer, at least in
remembrance, than that of the wattle or boronia. Particularly were
the prominent features of the landscape slighted: there was no
creek to compare with the English brooks and the Scottish burns,
while the hills which had towered so high to their childish eyes
seemed in retrospect to overtop with ease the mountains of this new
land.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Brother of Ben Nevis.</p>

<p>Thus many a young Australian realises with surprise that there
is at least one peak within fifty miles of Melbourne which is
higher than anything in the United Kingdom, with the solitary
exception of Ben Nevis. Donna Buang is 4080 feet, so the Scottish
mountain can give it but 400 feet at the outside. The late Mr. J.
A. Panton is said to have discovered it in 1865, and he is held
responsible for the name. It stands very little higher than the
huge huddle of hills of which it forms a part, and it has no
striking features to mark it out on the skyline. But it gives a
magnificent outlook. About five miles away to the west is Ben Cairn
(better known as The Rock), also a place of noble views, and these
two high points form a natural pair for the walker to visit who has
a week-end at his disposal.</p>

<p>There are several ways of attacking them, the one thing common
to all being a long pull up. On most of these the walker will be
the happier if he has had sprigs or nails put in his bootsoles to
give him grip, and he should not neglect his leggings. The
conventional mode of reaching the top of Donna Buang is to drive
from Warburton to the horseshoe bend on Cement Creek, and walk
along the well-graded track which ends on the summit, in all about
12 miles. As a winter trip, with snow on the ground, this is fairly
severe, but the long days and dry tracks of summer make it easy
enough. A more direct route is up the timber tracks from Warburton.
They may be readily found by local inquiry. They cut the distance
down to five or six miles, but they can be recommended to the young
and sturdy only. The walk could continue across to Ben Cairn (five
or six miles), down to Millgrove (four miles), and "so home," as
Mr. Pepys used to say.</p>

<p>That would make a very full day, but the excellent tourist road
which now connects the two peaks provides quite good going.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a name="image-3" id=

</p>

<p class="caption">Timber Track Near Warburton</p>

<p class="cpb">Swag and Sleeping Bag.</p>

<p>In reverse order the trip just outlined could be comfortably
accomplished if one cared to carry a swag or sleeping bag. Sleeping
bags were difficult to obtain during the period of the war, but now
that things are back to normal the shopkeepers will no doubt stock
them again. With a swag of some kind and tucker enough for three
meals, Ben Cairn may be climbed from Millgrove on a Saturday
afternoon, a camp made just at the back of the big rocky outcrop
which distinguishes this peak, and on Sunday Donna Buang may be
crossed and Warburton reached in time for the evening train. Night
on the top of the Rock, in good weather, is an experience worth all
the trouble of reaching there. Above are the stars, very bright at
this altitude of over 3000 feet, and beneath is another heavenfull,
for the great basin of the Yarra, walled on both sides by
mountains, is directly below, and is sprinkled with little
townships, each township holding a handful of lamps, many of them
electrically lighted.</p>

<p class="cpb">Other Approaches.</p>

<p>Coming from Launching Place the Don Valley road gives good
approach to a well-cut track that goes off easterly at Panton's Gap
and ends at the Rock. But better still, in the writer's opinion, is
the walk from Healesville which takes in portion of this route. It
provides two pleasant strolls, and there is no need to camp out.
The afternoon train on Saturday is early enough to permit of
leaving the township by 3 o'clock. The Don Road, which must be
followed, is not uninteresting at any point, and as it dips to the
Badger Creek it is beautiful. Some very fine samples of Christmas
bush mark the rise on the far side, and, about a mile on, there is
a short cut which is worth taking. It turns to the left near a
house. Its steepness is modified by the outlook it gives, and it
saves some very long bends in the coach road. A little further on a
finger post directs to Malleson's Look-out, commanding a prospect
of much charm, and soon the guest house of this hillside (really
Mount Tooleybewong) comes into view. It is known as "Nyora," and is
about nine miles from Healesville.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Paddock Track.</p>

<p>Next morning there are more views to admire before the paddock
track is sought. This should be inquired for. It meanders along
hillsides, until it drops suddenly to the Launching Place Road near
a large signboard bearing directions regarding Ben Cairn and Donna
Buang. This is Panton's Gap, with Panton's old house still standing
in a grove of walnut and chestnut trees. Long sidings over the
Badger Valley succeed until the crossing of a saddle changes the
slope to a southerly one. Excellent valley peeps are obtained. At a
convenient time the Don races under the track in a corner where
there is a sharpish turn. Later this bustling stream may be seen
again by going a few hundred yards off the beaten way. Some
Aberdeenshire man was evidently in this part of the country when
names were being given, for the three main streams of the locality
are the Dee, the Don and the Ythan. The growths are more striking
as the way ascends, and in the proper season may be seen, in all
their native beauty, the fine blooms of the Eriostemon and the
mintbush, both now well-established garden favorites. Little
runnels make a pleasant coolness, and at the last of these the
billy should be filled, for there is no spring on the summit. There
is water, however, within ten minutes, in a line directly behind
the Rock.</p>

<p class="cpb">Timber Slide and Tram Track.</p>

<p>To continue on to Millgrove from the top of Ben Cairn, one must
follow the Donna Buang pad northwards to where it first divides.
The branch to the right, turning sharply back and running under the
Rock, is the correct one. When I was last there it was badly
overgrown, and probably it still needs clearing. Its general
inclination is to the right, until it slips down a short timber
slide on to an old tram track by a creek. The tram track makes fair
walking, and it may be kept as far as the aqueduct. By turning to
the left along the bank of this channel excellent going will be
found. It joins a road which crosses the Yarra at its junction with
the Dee, close to Millgrove, which has a railway station. An
alternative is to continue along the Donna Buang Road till, just
past a beech grove, a saw mill winch is visible. To follow the mill
tracks down is to go direct to Millgrove.</p>

<p>Still another pleasant way from Healesville calls for the use of
a swag, and for the strength to do a strenuous day on foot. Make
the Badger Creek on Saturday afternoon, camp the night there, and,
just above the bridge, pick up the boundary track of the
Metropolitan Board's reserve. It is small and may not be
well-defined, but after it has reached the top of the divide by a
breathless zig-zag there are no severe pinches. When it reaches
Donna Buang the final stage may be completed on the main road from
Warburton. En route Ben Cairn could be visited. To do this trip one
must keep going. It would be more pleasant on a week-end, with a
Monday holiday. A night could then be spent on the Badger, and
another on the Rock, and there would be ample time to admire the
scenery and listen to the lyre-birds, for which these particular
mountain-tops are famous.</p>

<h3><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>OUR BEAUTIFUL BAY</h3>

<p class="pin30">Give me a long, white road, and the grey, wide
path of the sea,<br>
And the wind' will, and the bird's will.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Arthur Symons.</p>

<p>It is the fashion to be bored by Port Phillip, but no one who
really knows our Bay, and particularly its eastern shore, will deny
it a rare beauty at certain times and seasons. In the early
morning, with light mists thinly veiling it, you shall have a
mirror wholly composed of mother-of-pearl; at nightfall it may
become an opal, shot with changing lights that know every tone of
grey and blue and gold and scarlet. From the heights of Arthur's
Seat and Mount Martha, and once from Rickett's Point, I have seen
the wide expanse lose its flatness on a calm day, and lie as a huge
shield of burnished silver, so plainly raised to a centre that one
looked for the point that would be on a buckler. The inevitable
challenge from Sydney really means nothing. Port Jackson is one of
the very beautiful things of the world, with its rocky walls, its
deep water right up to the land, and its perpetual surprises in
little winding bays; Port Phillip has its own sufficient charm,
denied to Port Jackson, of long, deep beaches of firm sand, of the
loveliest of pale green shallows, of miles of tea-tree and banksia
groves.</p>

<p class="cpb">Three the Golden Number.</p>

<p>If I held with Stevenson that, to be properly enjoyed, a walking
tour should be undertaken alone, I should recommend the coast from
Point Nepean to (say) Point Ormond, as the very place for an
individual ramble. But I do not agree with the cheerful R. L. S. in
this matter. Congenial company (though the emphasis may be upon
congenial), is a thing to say grace for in any circumstances; it
generally doubles the pleasure of an outing. It is then that the
meal lacks nothing, that the views are at their best, and more than
ever has the camp-fire charm. Moreover, in solitary Walking there
is a definite menace which it would be as foolish to ignore as to
over-stress. The author of "Travels with a Donkey" was not so
likely to know it in his well-ordered Europe as is the pedestrian
who leaves the beaten track here to explore a lonely bush pad. His
is the form of travel least liable to chance of accident, but as a
man may sprain his ankle in his own backyard or know a sunstroke in
Collins Street, so he is not immune from trouble on the country
ways, and he might lie a long time on some of them before being
picked up. The ideal party is three. That is not too many to walk
abreast on the highway or keep in touch on the narrow bridle track,
it permits of sufficient variety of disposition to make monotony
impossible, and it is ample to give that friction of intellect
which is the basis of all good conversation. Three, too, is the
minimum number to cope adequately with accident, for one can stay
with the injured person and one go for assistance.</p>

<p>However, there are short walks on which a crowd is not too many,
and everyone knows occasions when solitude is the best thing in the
universe. The eastern side of the Bay is designed for the large
party, the small party, and the walker who feels that he must go
alone. The former need not fear shortage of food or accommodation
(always the bush risk with a big number), and the other can have
solitude and to spare without losing complete touch with his
fellows.</p>

<p class="cpb">Sorrento to Rye.</p>

<p>Sorrento makes a good jumping-off place for a week-end walk,
because most of the Bay boats call there. It is not uninteresting
to recall that Lieutenant-Colonel Collins did his best to establish
a convict settlement near there in 1803. He failed after a three
months' trial. Buckley, the wild white man, was one of the
prisoners. He escaped, and it must stir a walker's imagination to
reflect that, when he was found again, he was at Indented Head, on
the far side of the bay. A good walk&mdash;but he had had 32 years
in which to do it! One wonders where and how he crossed the
Yarra.</p>

<p>The Saturday afternoon boat arrives about 5 o'clock. By turning
to the left on leaving the pier, the Melbourne road is joined at
once. Nearly three miles behind, towards Point Nepean, is Portsea,
beyond which nothing exists at present for the tourist, owing to
quarantine and military restrictions. Ahead are several villages,
at one of which accommodation must be found for the night unless
the swag is carried. It is not possible to miss the way; there is
no major turn-off until, at 81 miles, the Flinders and Cape Schanck
Road opens out to the right. Before that, at 5½ miles, is the
little village of Rye, which boasts a hotel and a boarding-house.
The beach has been very close all the time, and offers a choice of
going. Preferably the road should be kept to here, and, if the
walker has had enough for a day which began so late, he could stop
now for the night. Let him not miss being at the water's edge as
the light begins to fail. If he has chosen his weather well, and
the sea is calm, any doubts he may have had about the beauty of our
bay will depart forever.</p>

<p class="cpb">Rye to Mornington.</p>

<p>Morning repeats the miracle. The traveller should be early up
and swimming in that lake of light, then he may choose whether he
will take the beach or the road. The road is certainly easier to
walk, but the other is worth while for the young morning effects on
the shallows. The belt of timber in between also repays sampling.
There was once a very unusual settlement here. A small colony of
Maoris established itself for a time in the sixties, but gradually
died out. One of the women, who was said to hold high native rank,
was taken back to New Zealand by a deputation sent expressly for
her. Rosebud, with its South Channel lighthouse standing well
inshore, nestles pleasantly at the foot of a range which forms part
of the backbone of Arthur's Seat. It has stores and several
boardinghouses. As it is not more than twelve miles from Sorrento,
an active walker could have put in the night here. Three miles
further on is Dromana, and in between comes a spur of the mountain
which almost pushes the road into the sea. Arthur's Seat was named
by Murray in 1802 from its likeness to the Edinburgh Hill. A couple
of hours would take one to the top of its 1000 feet and back again,
but that can be so readily done from Dromana that it may wait
another occasion. It is well now to complete the nine miles (from
Rye) into Dromana, get some lunch there, or fill up a billy of
water for use later. The beach is to be taken from here. There is
something like 11 miles to be walked by this route before the
evening train leaves Mornington. Mount Martha is straight ahead.
There is plenty of driftwood at the foot if lunch is desired al
fresco. The creek is easily crossed. The hill is climbable, and
near its seafront will be found a made road which gives most
satisfactory views. It leads past Mount Martha Hotel and right into
Mornington, where, usually, there is boat as well as train.</p>

<p class="cpb">Shorter Outings.</p>

<p>Do not think that that has skimmed all the cream off the coastal
outings. Beautiful and varied are the 10 miles of curving sandy
bays and well-wooded rocky points between Mornington and Frankston,
making a delightful Sunday trip. The walker can leave town by the
10 to 11 train, lunch in Mornington at 1 o'clock, and have six
hours in which to "loaf and invite his soul" before he catches the
8.5 home from Frankston. Numberless are these shorter walks.
Especially good is the foreshore, with its fine masses of tea-tree,
between Sandringham and Mentone, and so are those wonderful sandy
beaches (somewhat spoiled by popularity) connecting Mordialloc,
Aspendale, Chelsea, and Carrum. These may be done on a Saturday
afternoon.</p>

<p>I shall return to this coast and the Mornington Peninsula in
another article.</p>

<h3><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>MOUNT MARTHA</h3>

<p class="pin40">The high hills are haughty,<br>
They stand against the blue<br>
And count themselves a cut above<br>
The likes of me and you.<br>
But the little hills lean down to us<br>
And pass the time o' day,<br>
And tell the gossip of the tracks,<br>
And give their views away.<br>
<br>
&mdash;R.H.C.</p>

<p>Anyone who desires a week-end outing without fatigue will be
pleasantly suited by Mount Martha. And, if a day or two extra be
available, as at Easter, there is much to engage him there for the
extra time. He can gain most from the excursion by taking a swag
and settling down in a quiet nook, but accommodation is available
on the early slopes of the mount, should the more conventional life
be preferred. For a week-end he should catch the afternoon train on
Saturday, arriving at Mornington two hours later. Opportunity will
probably present itself to have the swag sent out to the
post-office, four miles ahead, leaving the walker free to enjoy
thoroughly the pleasant way along the cliff road to Balcombe's
Creek. Just beyond this is the post-office.</p>

<p class="cpb">An Upland Camp.</p>

<p>Two miles further on are numbers of attractive stopping places
where that desirable thing, a daylight camp, may be had. Although
the sea is close by, it is necessary to keep to the uplands to
camp, for Mount Martha's shores are rocky, with never a sandy beach
between Balcombe's Creek and the Kangerong Flat on the Dromana
side. Thick clumps of tea-tree still survive and make a good green
shelter. Thanks to the constant sea breezes and full exposure to
the sun, the western slopes are warm and dry, and the surface is
not too hard to prevent the digging of the camper's comfort&mdash;a
good hip hole. It is fine to wake in this place before the sun
takes up the fresh humidity of the night, and while the shadow of
the mount is still far out on the bay, now coming to its blueness.
Lie in the warmth of the sleeping bag for a while, and hear the day
come in. What is the first bird call? Once it was certain to be a
sleepy twitter from that superb warbler, the blue wren, or the more
forceful note of the "yah-hoo" or catbird. Now probably it will be
a blackbird's scolding outburst, or his more melodious fluting.
This English bird is spreading fast through the bush, and, though
his song is wonderful, one may be forgiven a feeling of regret that
our native favourites are being pushed to the background.</p>

<p class="cpb">"In Pleasant Places."</p>

<p>The camper may cast his lines in pleasant places if he has
brought along the necessary material for fishing, and a little
squid for bait. In the evening, or the very early morning, by
throwing far out, he may hook a schnapper. In the pools at his feet
there are parrot fish and leather-jackets. Mussels may be gathered
by wading in where it is shallowest. Whether there is "anything
doing" or not, so far as catching is concerned, there is great
pleasure to be obtained from pottering about at the water's edge
with the wavelets slapping up against the rocks. At the south-west
corner a creek comes in, and here is an excellent bathing place.
Flat rocks give comfortable access to the water, and a swim may be
had in the dock-like mouth and the deeper sea beyond, but not too
far, for fear of sharks. The fish which has been boiling or
grilling for breakfast will now be thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p class="cpb">Beating the Bounds.</p>

<p>Assuming that this is a week-end trip, and all that is to be
seen must be seen to-day, "plant" the swag and set out on the track
towards Dromana. It would be possible to go to that village and to
Arthur's Seat, at its back, but the time can be more profitably
spent in climbing about the mount. The "trig" station on the summit
is 600 feet above sea-level and it yields some charming views,
rivalling even the panorama from the top of the one thousand feet
of Arthur's Seat. From the fall toward Dromana a pleasant picture
is obtained of blue sea edged by white beach and the little
township nestling at the foot of dark green wooded slopes. A still
more brilliant piece of colouring will be seen later on as the
return is being made to Mornington. Through the roadside trees,
past the north-west corner, is visible a long reach of shoaling
water in varied tints of blue and green. Under an afternoon sun
shines a great stretch of white sand at the foot of cliffs whose
bright pigments are deeply set in foliage. That view is worth a
trip in itself.</p>

<p class="cpb">Some History.</p>

<p>While still on the top it may be interesting to recall that
Governor La Trobe had 130 acres reserved here for a marine
residence for the Governors of Victoria. That was a considerable
time past, seeing that La Trobe retired in 1854. The project of
building came to nothing. About 50 years ago, the Mount Martha
Estate, some 4000 acres, was known as Hearne's Paddock (a
fair-sized paddock!) and Hearne's Bridge still exists. But
Professor Hearne built his house on the slope of Arthur's Seat. It
is now the country home of Mr. Justice Higgins. The firm of Stout
and Isaacs next endeavoured to establish a wood-cutting business on
Mount Martha, even building a jetty for the craft to lie at when
loading wood for Melbourne. They erected a store for the benefit of
their employees, who numbered over 50. The enterprise was not a
success. Years afterwards the Mount passed to Mr. Robert Watson, a
retired cloth manufacturer from Glasgow, who built a fine granite
house, with two stone lodges, and for a long time these were the
only houses on the hill. The scrub grew wild and dense, and amongst
it shone, as it shines to-day, some exceptionally fine epacris. At
a later period considerable planting was done about the northern
top, but rabbits and fire have been destructive. Some good trees
remain, however, notably a few fine palms which were planted by the
well-known journalist, Mr. Joseph Harris, who still resides in
Mornington. Originally it was difficult work to force a way through
the thick masses of native shrubs on the sea face, but now a good
track has been cut and has developed into a motor road.</p>

<p class="cpb">"And So Home."</p>

<p>Any heat and dust acquired on the return walk to Mornington may
be got rid of at Fisherman's Beach, close to the township, where
there are dressing sheds. So a bathing suit forms a useful part of
the outfit. The train on Sunday leaves for Melbourne about 6
o'clock. Alternatively, the return could be made by way of Dromana,
where a boat is sometimes available or a motor could be caught. The
trip is best made in November or at Easter, for the rains will then
have set the springs running. Otherwise water may have to be
carried for a couple of miles.</p>

<h3><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>"BUSHRANGERS' BAY"</h3>

<p class="pin30">I like my landscape, as I like my whisky, with a
dash of water in it.<br>
<br>
&mdash;R.H.C.</p>

<p>Far more people know Bushrangers' Bay than know it by that
title. I cannot say that the name was ever on the map, but it
persists in tradition to record the feat of certain convicts who
are said to have landed there many years ago after having escaped
from Van Diemen's Land. It is an unlikely place for any one, save
desperate men, to attempt to beach a boat. The sea smashes fiercely
on the rocky headland which forms the outer side of the bay, and
the high cliffs on the right look down on a ceaseless series of
breakers. The sandy delta of Main Creek offers the only chance of
making the shore, and the risks (to a landsman, anyway) look
tremendous. Most of that piece of coast which takes the rollers of
Bass Strait from Flinders to Cape Schanck has the combination of
qualities so commonly found together&mdash;it is stern, forbidding,
and picturesque.</p>

<p>This is a walk for a week-end with a Monday holiday attached to
it. It could suitably be done in the week in January in which
Foundation Day falls, or to include Eight Hours Day. A sleeping
bag, or swag of some sort, must be taken; there is no accommodation
to be had. And tucker for two days must be carried.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Sorrento Road.</p>

<p>The Bay is about seven miles towards Cape Schanck from Flinders,
it is fifteen miles from Dromana, and eighteen or nineteen from
Sorrento by the main road. I prefer the Dromana approach, because
cars run conveniently to Dromana on Saturday afternoons. In short,
it is more readily accessible than Flinders, and not so far as
Sorrento. Two hours' walk will bring you to the most suitable place
to camp, which is near the junction of this highway with the road
to Cape Schanck. And here a word of general advice: If you want
comfort, always camp before dark. The flanks of Arthur's Seat are
skirted where they almost push the road into the sea, and at 3¼
miles comes the little village of Rosebud. There is no mistaking
the way; push on towards the sunset and admire the fine bank of
honeysuckle, tea-tree and other growths that runs all the way along
on the right between you and the tide. At 5½ miles from Dromana (2¼
from Rosebud), the Schanck road will be seen branching off sharply
to the left. There is a signpost on the corner if the Cockney
sportsmen who delight in disfiguring useful things have refrained
from shooting it down. The lettering had a couple of charges of
shot in it when last I passed.</p>

<p class="cpb">Camp Here.</p>

<p>A tiny track winds through the scrub to the beach at this point.
Take your swag down it and pick a camp on the sand under one of the
fine banksias. In a small clearing nearby is a spring, but it is
advisable to go to the house which stands a few hundred yards up
the Schanck Road and get a couple of billies full of water there.
Then make your fire, put the water on to boil and have a dip. If
the weather is good, and particularly if the evening be still, that
will be one of the most memorable happenings of the trip, for the
sea will be full of reflected light and colour. It will be like
bathing in a rainbow. A meal round the fire, and you do not deserve
your luck if you are not well content. Look up to see a wonderful
sight. The banksia leaves are white on the underside and the
firelight has changed the whole tree to a mass of silver. Not so
much later, you crawl into your sleeping bag. On a quiet night
there may come to you the noise of a steamer inward or outward
bound along the South Channel. She passes out of hearing and out of
mind, but long afterwards there comes a message from her in the
shape of a wave, and then another, which suddenly break the silence
by racing up the shingle and lap-lapping there.</p>

<p class="cpb">Ten Miles to Go.</p>

<p>An early start is invariably a good thing. Make it on this
occasion to secure a reasonable amount of time at Bushrangers' Bay.
Leave the Sorrento Road and head for Cape Schanck. The route is
obvious and the going good. Hereabouts is the old "Tootgarook" (I
believe that is still the parish name) to which the young bloods of
Melbourne used to ride in the sixties and seventies to hunt the
kangaroo. Eight miles of road, all on the up grade, and you are at
Blacks' Camp, where there was formerly a kitchen midden with the
remains of countless shellfish, no doubt carried by the gins from
the shore to feast their sable lords "when wild in woods the noble
savage ran." The elevation shows the peninsula lying below you like
a relief map. Here goes off a sandy road to the right, ending at
the Schanck lighthouse in 21 miles. Avoid it and follow the
Flinders Road (running easterly) until you cross a shallow creek.
Then take to the paddocks and make for the ocean, lying due south.
In less than two miles you are on the wooded edge of a cliff
overlooking your objective, and you will note with approval the
good water-course (Main Creek), the pleasant stretch of sheltered
sandy beach, and the bold and picturesque headlands.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a name="image-4" id=
"image-4"></a><img alt="" src="1402821h-images/openroad-4.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">Point Barker, Bushrangers' Bay</p>

<p class="cpb">The Burrobang.</p>

<p>Bushrangers' Bay is more often referred to as "The Burro-bang,"
for a beautiful little creek, rejoicing in that name, comes dancing
in on the north side to supply the camper with fresh water. Main
Creek, which is responsible for the good beach, is a far more
important stream, but it is brackish for some distance. The
Burrobang can never be affected by the tides, owing to the fact
that its approach to the salt water is a series of cascades. Main
Creek runs between the Burrobang and the sandy beach, and has to be
crossed whenever fresh water is wanted. There is no difficulty in
crossing. Good camping can be had on the sand under and alongside a
patch of low-growing shrubs. To the sleeper on the ground a thick
low bush is often a greater comfort than overhead shelter. It keeps
the wind off. Hang up your food, for the scrub is alive with bush
rats. An afternoon can be spent very happily clambering over the
headlands, fishing in the deep rock pools or the surf or the creek,
and bathing.</p>

<p class="cpb">Cape Schanck.</p>

<p>Cape Schanck is good for an article in itself, with its bold
wedge splitting the southern rollers and its delightful plateau on
which the lighthouse stands. But it must be taken on this occasion
as a mere incident of the trip. If you left camp early yesterday
morning for convenience sake, leave it early to-day, because you
must if you are to get home. Climb the cliff where the Burrobang
has cut it into terraces for you, and follow the edge until you
reach the lighthouse grounds in about two miles. It is not smooth
going, but it may easily be done before breakfast. See what you may
of the light, the lookout, and the great telescope, bearing in mind
that you have about 16 miles of rather tough walking to do before
the steamer leaves Sorrento at 4 o'clock. (Check all times when
leaving town.) Ignore the road (it leads out to the north), and
continue along the top of the cliff. There is a track of a kind.
Presently some springs, guarded from animal pollution by a fence,
will be noticed on and over the cliff edge. Fill up the billies
here; a dry stretch is ahead.</p>

<p class="cpb">"As I Came Through the Desert."</p>

<p>The high cliff walls begin to fall away to sand hummocks, which
are at first well clothed with scrub (a kangaroo hopped out of it
in front of me one day), and later as bare as the sea itself. It is
easy to drop down to the water's edge. If your luck is in, the tide
is out. If the tide is in, your luck is out. It is difficult to
estimate the distance across the stretch of sand, known as "the
desert," that is now ahead of you, but, whatever it is, it seems
longer. At a guess it may be eight or nine miles before you again
reach a rocky point and a firm footing. The belt stretches inland
for some distance, and it is really an interesting experience, if
you are in good form, to move along its sea margin. Always there
are majestic waves rolling in at your left, often with wild hair
streaming back from a land breeze, then there is the strip of moist
sand on which you walk, firm enough at low tide, and from it slope
up the seemingly unending ridges of the desert. The surface is a
crisp, thin cover of hardened sand, through which the foot breaks.
In many places a dwarf forest of lime-encrusted objects produces an
extraordinary landscape. Along the high-water line wreckage of the
most varied kind suggests romance and treasure trove. A party of
walkers found a well-secured case labelled Dry Gin. It was full of
missionary hymn-books.</p>

<p class="cpb">Into Sorrento.</p>

<p>Somewhere at the back of Rye the cliffs recommence, and some
four miles out of Sorrento tracks will be found winding through the
tea-tree and styphelia scrub to houses where water may be obtained,
and eventually to the township. The going is very heavy, for the
surface is of the softest, and the pace is slowed accordingly. On a
hot day, too, these sheltered cuts in the green vegetation can be
very oppressive. It is well to keep such facts in mind, seeing that
your time is limited. Given enough, you may enjoy a refreshing dip
in the front beach baths&mdash;the final thing required to make the
homeward journey on the steamer thoroughly enjoyable.</p>

<h3><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>"TOOLANGI ON THE RISE"</h3>

<p class="pin20">So he journeyed to Toolangi, where the mountain
ash yearns skyward,<br>
And the messmate and the blue-gum grow to quite abnormal size.<br>
<br>
&mdash;C. J. Dennis.</p>

<p>Toolangi is "on the rise," in a slang, as well as a literal
sense just now, for the Main Roads Board has lent a merciful ear to
its well-sustained wails, and has given the secluded little
mountain settlement a fine new road. It originates in Healesville,
which is certainly Toolangi's natural outlet, despite the fact that
the coach and the mails so long travelled to and from Yarra Glen.
Toolangi will soon be easily accessible all the year, and tourists
may look forward to extended trips, embracing much beautiful
country.</p>

<p class="cpb">Tall Timber.</p>

<p>It is the home of tall timber, a land of rich soil and abundant
water. Spring is its season if you would explore its beech bowers,
share its wealth of wattle gold, look up in wonderment to where the
giant peppermints send out their first branches, or know the
scented shade of its musk gullies. Winter is not the time for them,
but it is in the crisp, fresh weather that a pedestrian, with a
Saturday afternoon and Sunday at his disposal, a pair of stout
boots on his feet, and a mackintosh and a change of socks in his
knapsack, may find real enjoyment in the walk to Toolangi, and back
again. With due regard to short days, he should select one of the
easier routes. Let him abandon any thought of starting from Yarra
Glen until a season of greater daylight, for that way means 14
miles. He can alternatively be in Healesville by 3 o'clock on a
Saturday afternoon, and will then have only 10 miles to walk if he
choose the Chum track, and 11 miles if he prefer the Meyer's Creek
road. There is a marked difference between these two routes, a
difference all in favour of the latter, but, if he share the common
prejudice against coming back the way he went, the traveller may
take the Chum track going, when he has least time to spare, and the
Meyer as he returns.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Chum Road.</p>

<p>Leaving the Healesville station, turn back along the line to the
first crossing. On the north side follow the road until, just after
it bends west, there is a sharp turn to the right. That is your
way, and though, at times, rather muddy, the going is generally
fair. It is fenced on either hand, and there is an occasional house
with a bit of orchard; otherwise the seemingly untouched bush has
control. A steady rise is the father of a sharp descent, across the
side of which is cut the aqueduct that carries the Maroondah waters
to our ever-thirsty city. There is no straight monotony about this
road at any point, and least of all here, for it twists and curves,
incidentally yielding some agreeable views of wooded ridges with
St. Leonard looking over them. Just before the Chum Creek becomes a
visible presence on your right, a likely-looking road will try to
lure you up the hill to the left. Ignore it or you will find
yourself at a dead end in less than a mile. Variety may be had by
following a timber-track (a tram line), which crosses the road. It
winds along green lanes cut through thick undergrowth under
spreading wattles, and across many a little watercourse and one or
two creeks, the bridging of which compels admiration of the skill
of the bush worker. If you keep to the tramway you will come to the
sawmill, perched above a creek, its machinery-shed and the men's
hut hiding well in the timber. Make sure here of your track, and
keep going so that you may get clear of the bush before nightfall.
There are short cuts ahead, but it is impossible to indicate them
on paper, for lack of recognisable landmarks. You will be well
advised to keep to the obvious way. Then you will eventually come
out into what may be called Toolangi's main street, between the
post office, to your left, and the hotel, to your right. There are
several boarding houses offering a choice of accommodation for the
night.</p>

<p class="cpb">Tangled Tracks.</p>

<p>Here let me sound a note of warning. I have walked many hundreds
of miles through the Victorian bush, but I know of no place where
the tracks are so confusing to a stranger as are Toolangi's.
Obviously, they were in the mind of the author of "The Glugs of
Gosh" (whose home is in Toolangi) when he wrote:</p>

<p class="pin10">Follow the river and cross the ford,<br>
Follow again to the wobbly bridge,<br>
Turn to the left at the notice board,<br>
Climbing the cow-track over the ridge...</p>

<p>It is to be observed that he refers to "the" notice-board; he
could not use the plural in that connection. The moral is: Do not
omit any opportunity of inquiring your way, particularly toward the
end of the journey. One of the advantages of the Meyer track is
that it is single-minded in its endeavour to reach Toolangi, and,
unlike the Chum, it does not flirt with half a dozen cross trails
before leading you to a place where you may lodge. The newly
constructed Chum Creek Road, however, makes it now impossible to
deviate from its well-graded way. The caution suggested is needed
only about the township itself or if "short cuts" are
attempted.</p>

<p class="cpb">Meyer's Creek.</p>

<p>Next morning you may gain appetite for lunch by visiting the
nearer of the local lions. If there has been no rain the Yea River,
locally (and libellously) known as "the Muddy," may be viewed by
following it along the tourist track which has been cut. Leave by 2
o'clock and you will have five hours in which to do your 11 miles.
That gives nice time for looking about and may reasonably include
afternoon tea, which is obtainable on the way. Almost at once the
forest closes in, topped by a number of great trees which have
escaped the sawmiller, and brightened in one spot by clumps of tree
ferns. You lose all sight of settlement, all touch, apparently,
with "the crowded, slippery, coach-loving world."</p>

<p>The going is, in the main, uphill for about two miles. At the
crest of the rise you are close to Mount St. Leonard, whose 3000
feet can look imposing in some lights and do look beautiful under
most conditions. The head-waters of Meyer's Creek are at your right
side; now the way is wholly downhill, for it follows the course of
the stream. From here into Healesville is the pick of the walk. A
portion of the road near Kay's, which may be muddy after rain, may
be avoided by taking for a few hundred yards a tram track on the
hillside above it.</p>

<p>A tributary coming into Meyer's is crossed, and shortly
afterward a mill will be seen across the creek. About it, and
particularly on the roadside, is a great natural garden of
mint-bush and Christmas-bush. No one who has not seen this place in
the spring can realise what a wonder of purple bloom it is. It is
dazzling to look at the flower masses with the sun on them. An
interesting exotic near by is sweet lavender, a great quantity of
which is growing wild in a certain corner, giving off its
characteristic scent strongly in the flowering season. Continuing
along the road, you may cross from the east to the west bank and at
the bridge, which is about five miles from Healesville,
refreshments may be had.</p>

<p>The track is now a siding well above the water, but not so far
that you cannot view Meyer's Falls as you pass. Once at the foot of
the hill the creek becomes an intimate thing again and you see much
of it, and something of others, before you turn in to the Congdon's
Gully Road, a long straight stretch which eventually joins the
Fernshaw Road. There you turn to the right through the township
until you see the railway station ahead with your train dreaming
and enjoying a smoke before starting out for the city.</p>

<p>By the kindness of my friend, Mr. C. J. Dennis, I am able to
print here the following verses, which have not hitherto been
published:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">To linger in Toolangi when the winds o' Winter
blow<br>
Is to get an aftertaste of what old Noah used to know,<br>
And to loiter in Toolangi when the suns o' Summer bake<br>
Is to suffer from a plethora of bullock whip and snake;<br>
But your heart is full of gladness, and it makes your spirit
sing<br>
Just to linger in Toolangi, in Toolangi in the Spring.<br>
Then the whipbirds wake the gullies where the wattles tell their
gold,<br>
And trilling thrushes sing again, as poets sang of old,<br>
Of the glory of the bushland and the glamour of the scrub,<br>
While the early-rising robin scoffs the festive homing grub.<br>
Loud laugh the Jacks, while wombats strive to sing in divers
keys:<br>
(Even wombats want to warble when the bloom is on the
trees)&mdash;<br>
Then if you'd know the joy o' life that Austral poets sing<br>
O come ye to Toolangi, to Toolangi in the Spring.</p>

<h3><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>WHITTLESEA, FLOWERDALE,
BROADFORD</h3>

<p class="pin20">It is good to be out on the road and going one
knows not where&mdash;<br>
Going through meadow and village, one knows not whither nor
why;<br>
Through the grey light drift of the dust, in the thin cool rush of
the air,<br>
Under the flying white clouds and the broad blue lift of the
sky.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Masefield.</p>

<p>It will be easier to agree with the poet if the year has not too
rapidly advanced into the autumn, making it rather desirable to
know where one is going and that there is a roof to cover him at
the day's end. A fine two-day trip, in which a Monday holiday may
be utilised, is that from Whittle-sea, by way of Tommy's Hut and
Flowerdale, to Broadford. Its one disadvantage is that the Sunday
train is too late in starting and too slow to be of any use, so it
is necessary to go to Whittlesea by Saturday evening's "express"
(it takes over an hour and a half to do 26 miles), and stay the
night there. There is abundant accommodation. Your compensation is
the pleasantly early start that is possible next morning.</p>

<p class="cpb">Good Going.</p>

<p>A good metal road leads east past the Coffee Palace, and so out
of Whittlesea. It is flat going, but ahead is an attractive scheme
of hills that look worth climbing, and which you will later find
yourself attacking. You cross the Plenty River almost at once. It
is in so many divisions that one seems to get a clue to the origin
of its name. The show-ground on the left is the next local lion,
and, coming in from the same side, the aqueduct crosses the road on
its way to the Yan Yean. Its source is the picturesque little
Tooroorong Reservoir, lying among the wooded ranges like an
old-world tarn, and fed in its turn by the waters of Jack's Creek.
Some other day you may take a stroll that far, having duly obtained
permission from the Metropolitan Board of Works, and perhaps visit
the cascades and reach the Wallaby Creek weir. Meanwhile you are
nearing a junction where you shall have a choice of roads, and
incidentally enjoying the songs of the innumerable magpies which
favour this open, park-like country. The excellent metal ends at
about two and a half miles, but the road remains satisfactory for
walking. Just beyond is the junction at a house (on the right) with
pines. A finger-post, standing like the parson who "pointed, but
did not go, the way," directs you to the right-hand road if you
wish to go to Scrubby Creek. You do, so you take it, crossing a
north and south road immediately.</p>

<p class="cpb">"Over the Range."</p>

<p>Some orchards and vineyards show in the paddocks to the right,
ahead is a State school on a small rise. As it is Sunday, you will
hear no hum of scholars as you pass below the enclosure. A house or
two on the left and a genial little stream, bridged for the road,
call your attention to the fact that you have reached Scrubby
Creek. Immediately the track begins to lift. Back at the junction
you have left the old road, which is now somewhere in the hills to
your left. This is a new deviation (known to the country folk, or
some of them, as the "derivation") improving the grade considerably
but adding a good bit to the mileage as it curves and bends about
the spurs. So little in a hurry is it to get over the range that it
gives the impression of strolling about with its hands in its
pockets. The views are often delightful, one at a clearing about
six miles from Whittlesea being particularly comprehensive. At 7½
miles it is possible to get a cup of tea at the Horse Shoe Chalet,
tucked away in a bend of the road. There is no other refreshment
room until Flowerdale is reached, and that is fifteen miles away,
so make the most of the opportunity if you have not carried lunch
and a billy with you. Your altitude here is 1100 feet, and you rise
a little more in the two miles to Tommy's Hut (Kinglake West).
There is a store at this point and the road branches. Take that
going to the left; the other leads to Kinglake East.</p>

<p class="cpb">Forest Ways.</p>

<p>It is now downhill, a delightful woodland way through a forest
of messmate, which has lately known a bush fire. That should have
ruined its beauty, but has only enhanced it. The trunks are a rich
black, and the tops have gained new tones, while the road is spread
with leaves more thickly than any autumn glade in Vallombrosa. The
King Parrot Creek begins to murmur on your left and will keep you
company for the rest of to-day and part of to-morrow. It is a
substantial stream and good both to look upon and to drink. A
sawmill, pretty well hidden in the undergrowth, a couple of
bridges, and you come out to a broader portion of the valley.
Steep, bare hills define it and every now and then you find the
river has wandered across as if to see how you are getting on. At
22 miles the hotel at Flowerdale will come into the picture and you
will be in the condition to appreciate a night's rest.</p>

<p class="cpb">Murchison Hill.</p>

<p>You have 20 miles to go and a full day to do it in, so there's
no hurry. Carry some lunch unless you start late enough to arrive
at Strath Creek at the conventional time for it. The hotel there is
the only place of accommodation between Flowerdale and Broadford.
Leaving Flowerdale you find a fingerpost at a quarter of a mile. It
beckons to tempt you to Break-o-Day, but turn your shoulder on that
alluring track and make for Strath Creek, once more following the
King Parrot. Birds are numerous along this stretch, and your luck
will be out if you do not see a fine eagle or two (Audax the bold)
soaring above you. Flowerdale sheep station presents an attractive
picture at five miles, its red roofs shining through masses of
green, "like a good deed in a naughty world." Opposite is a hill of
voices. With no breeze blowing on the slope, the trees of this hill
are often full of murmurings. Less interesting country follows; you
pass through Strath Creek township, and in a little over two miles
begin the ascent of Murchison Hill. It should be Murchison's Hill,
for it was named after a Murchison who had Kerrisdale station in
the early days. Then the road went across it much as the bird
flies, and teamsters found it wise to travel in pairs and use both
teams for each waggon in negotiating this stiff pinch. Coming down
the east side, it was the custom to attach trees behind the waggons
to steady them, and a pretty collection of timber had to be removed
from the foot when the present well-graded road was begun. The view
is one in a thousand. Strange, conical peaks, such as you expect to
find contain volcanic craters, rise smoothly in admired disorder
from the King Parrot Valley, and the course of that stream is
visible for many miles. Distant mountains close the prospect with a
blue frieze. The old road will be found a short cut, if a somewhat
rough one.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Last Lap.</p>

<p>If you made an early start you will be ready for lunch by the
time you reach Tyaak (14 miles), where there are several houses and
a State school, one of which will supply a billy of water. It was a
pretty compliment to the children (and the teacher) that when
lunching outside the school ground there lately a family of nine
white-winged choughs and a harmonious thrush gathered round and
accepted without fear the crumbs thrown to them. Reedy Creek, the
banks still scarred from old mining days, is crossed immediately,
and a fair pull up follows. Three miles on, the way crosses the
brow of Sheoak Hill, giving a fine panorama westward. The Tallarook
Ranges are on the right, in front is low country, with Broadford,
your objective, showing plainly in the middle distance, and Mount
Piper (the Sugarloaf) standing like a monument at the rear of the
town. An hour later you can be in Broadford. The evening train will
bring you back to the city.</p>

<h2>EXTENDED TOURS</h2>

<h3><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>THE GRAMPIANS</h3>

<p class="pin35">Have you ever been down to my countree<br>
Where the trees are green and tall?<br>
<br>
&mdash;John Shaw Neilson.</p>

<p>The accepted way to the Grampians is via Stawell. As early as
1868 a writer (Henry Waterfield) advised excursionists to coach the
170 miles from Melbourne to Stawell if they wished to see "one of
the most varied and beautiful landscapes in the world." His
reference was to the distant view of the Grampians from the
goldfields town. That was in a remarkably well-produced little
volume called "Outs: An Excursionist's Handbook," to which the late
Sir John Madden, J. L. Purves, James Hingston, and several others
destined to become very well known in Victoria, contributed the
articles. Stawell was then in transition from where the crowded
alluvial "rushes" had been on Pleasant Creek, and the population
had almost wholly moved to the Quartz Reefs, a little over a mile
to the east. "We can see plenty of inland townships through the
colony, but there is only one place par excellence, and it is
called the Quartz Reefs." So Waterfield judged. The Reefs have long
since taken the name of Stawell, and from there still sets out the
main highway to the blue hills which close the western outlook.</p>

<p>These hills form a beautiful range, whether viewed from a
distance, as from the Big Hill in Stawell, or more intimately when
rambling over them. I have seen much of picturesque Victoria: to
stand on the Big Hill on a fresh spring morning, with a golden tide
of wattle breaking high up on three sides, the town lying just
below, beyond it the sober greens of the bush leading up to the
living azure of the mountains&mdash;this challenges almost any view
I know. The morning light, level and clear, outlines the contours
till all the seeming flatness of distance disappears and the whole
long line, from Mount William to Mount Zero, is seen in relief.</p>

<p>Hall's Gap is the main objective of the tourist. It is about 16
miles from Stawell's railway station, about an hour's motor run
along a road which will soon be classed among the good roads of the
State. The pleasant little creek known as the Mokepilly is crossed
en route. As the mountains come closer the wonder is how they are
to be crossed or entered, for they present a seemingly unbroken
wall. But a natural gateway opens, and through a bower of shrubs,
including much heath and the popular Thryptomene, the road curves
in to a long valley at the rear of the first line of ramparts. This
is the famous Hall's Gap. Fyan's Creek, which has helped to carve
it out, and which is now an important part of an extensive water
scheme for the Mallee, is passed over on a bridge which has been
rebuilt many times within my recollection. Look back, and it is
hard to see how the valley has been penetrated. Almost directly
above the traveller hangs the second, and more imposing, range,
and, as the road runs on towards the Borough Huts, the great
sandstone crags become striking indeed. The valley is a long basin
with high mountains for walls.</p>

<p>This countryside is my "native heath." Here as a boy I formed my
first camp in the bush, and I may perhaps be forgiven for holding a
special brief for the Grampians as a pleasure resort. The place is
a paradise for walkers. There is unending variety in its scenery,
its botany, its zoology, its geology, and access is made very easy
in these days of motors.</p>

<p>It is little use attempting to set out the various walks on
paper. The tracks are excellent, and are, in the main, carried on
gradients possible to every pedestrian. They are well marked. With
the Tourist Bureau map in his possession, no one need be at a loss
as to what outing to choose, and once his feet are set on the way,
the direction signs will do the rest. There are many houses of
accommodation in the Gap and good camping places are numerous, for
it is a well-watered region.</p>

<p>Some day, perhaps, a great artist in words will do justice to
the glory of this natural garden, a garden which produces its own
peculiar flowers, for the Grampians are notable in having a flora
of their own. It should be possible, too, to picture such physical
features as Wonderland and the Silent Street, and other remarkable
rock formations, so that the attention of Australians generally
might be drawn to a spot which combines in a remarkable degree
beauty with mystery.</p>

<h3><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>THE ACHERON VALLEY AND
MARYSVILLE<br>
* An Easter Outing *</h3>

<p class="pin30">I am a good horse to travel, but not by choice a
roadster.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Thoreau.</p>

<p>Why this jolly mountain creek should have suggested to anyone
the melancholy stream of the underworld from which it derives its
name is a mystery. Perhaps the explanation if that each is a place
of shades. The upper reaches of our Acheron are certainly shady
enough, but the shades are those of gracious timbers, and the
sunlight is not wholly barred. It is only the upper reaches which
concern us on this trip, an ideal outing for the five holidays of a
fine Easter. The portion is from Narbethong up to practically the
river's source in the hills which divide the Goulburn waters from
those of the Yarra. In such a rich and well-watered country the
tracks are soon obliterated if not looked after. Neglect has spoilt
altogether what is known as the Edgar track, which runs from the
hairpin bend at Cement Creek, near Warburton, over the mountains to
Marysville. As portion of this track must be followed on the
present excursion, none but the sturdy should attempt it.</p>

<p class="cpb">Jump Off at Healesville.</p>

<p>Carry a sleeping bag and a couple of days' food to the
Healesville train on Thursday evening, the Thursday before Good
Friday. It may be 8 or 9 o'clock when you reach Healesville, not
too late to drive the 14 miles to Narbethong if you wish to
conserve time. A specially chartered conveyance will not cost much
individually if there is a party. Alternatively spend the night in
Healesville (there are plenty of good camps and plenty of other
accommodation), or leave town on Good Friday morning. I shall
assume that you start your walk from Healesville on the Friday
morning. First arrange for your swags to go on the coach to
Narbethong, keeping out a billy and enough food for the mid-day
meal. You have 14 miles of picturesque road to cover before you
turn from the broad highway and court the shyer and more seductive
bushland track. En route you can lunch where the Watts crosses the
road, and a fine linden and some other deciduous trees mark the
site of the old-time Fernshaw, seven miles from Healesville.
Immediately you find the famous Blacks' Spur rising before you. It
is worth a trip in itself. Were the hill twice as long, and the
grade twice as bad, you must still admire. And along the top and
going down the other side are equally good. There is an hotel at
Narbethong, so you have the choice of sleeping indoors or of making
a camp under the shelter of the trees near the little creek.</p>

<p class="cpb">Up the Acheron.</p>

<p>As you face towards Marysville a paling splitter's track goes
off to the right at a cutting not far past the hotel. Take it for
half a mile, then follow a turnoff again to the right, keeping the
top of the ridge for about three miles. The track drops abruptly
there, and is merged in a dray road, to which you must keep for the
whole length of the valley. It will introduce you to many beautiful
things. Very dense is the bush through which it winds, and it
crosses the Acheron charmingly several times. Despite the
timber-getters whose road you are using, many noble trees remain.
One big fellow, standing on three buttresses, has a girth of 50
feet. If, as is likely, these gums are in flower, their waving
branches will be alive with wattle-birds and other honey-eaters,
chasing one another and shouting and calling. You cannot miss the
way, the only tracks coming in being little pads made by the "small
deer" of the bush on their way to the water. All the while you have
been rising gently. At 12 miles you strike a very steep timber
slide, up which you must climb to about half way to get to the
splitters' hut, where your day ends. The hut is off to the right
some 200 yards. A small flat there makes a handy camp; the water is
just below in a bed of tangled fern, musk, mintbush, hazel, and
dogwood. From the slope above rise numberless clean-stemmed giants
with never a branch for 100 feet or more. Presently their tops will
be full' of stars, and you will lie and watch the eternal
procession until sleep blots out all material things.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Edgar Track.</p>

<p>There is a longer journey before you to-day (Sunday), so make an
early start. It is not that the mileage is so great (it is probably
20 miles into Marysville), but the way is more difficult. You have
a choice of routes in the beginning. One is to go back on your
tracks for a mile, where you turn to your left and follow up the
Warburton pad (about south) until it strikes another going east or
north-east at a junction where are several signposts. That is the
Edgar track making for Marysville. The alternative is to follow up
the creek, which has been singing all night below your camp (it is
slow going with the tangle of scrub and the decaying logs which
break beneath your feet) until in a long mile you find the
Splitters' Falls busy in a sort of green twilight. They are
pleasant, but do not call for much notice. Work east, by compass,
up the slope above them, and you will soon cut the Edgar track. The
chances are that you will find it in a very bad state of neglect,
almost completely blocked in places. Turn along it to the left. The
height gives you good views down the Acheron Valley, full of green
timber, and presently you will observe that you have got amongst
the Woollybutts (Eucalyptus Delegatensis), a sure sign of
elevation, for they mark the last stage before the snow-gum. You
cross an attractive saddle, rounding the end of the Poley Range
(4250 feet) as you do so. Now your outlook is east to some distant
ranges, and the heads of numerous small creeks are passed, each
making for the O'Shannassy River and so to the Yarra. The way
becomes closely walled with bush, and if you go quietly you may see
one of the lyrebirds that are calling from it. You skirt Mount
Strickland's 4000 feet, and just before reaching Mount Bismarck the
track divides. That to the right heads for Paradise Plains; take
the left-hand way, ascend to Keppell's Lookout when you come to the
notice board, and by steady dropping you will be in Marysville by
nightfall. There are camping places in abundance, as well as
boarding houses and an hotel. Stores may be renewed here.</p>

<p class="cpb">Homeward.</p>

<p>Monday morning could be devoted to visiting the Steavenson Falls
and returning in time to make the eight miles of road to
Narbethong, where the night could be spent, leaving an easy stroll
over the Spur for Tuesday. Or a full day could be put in along the
Taggerty River, up through the Forest of Arden to the Meeting of
the Waters and Keppeli's Falls, a seven-mile walk, and the night
passed in Marysville. In that case the swags could he left for the
Tuesday's coach, and flying light, the 23 miles to Healesville
would not be difficult. I cannot, at this stage, dwell upon the
attractions of Maryville, a beautiful little township at any time,
but especially so in the autumn, when the old-world trees in the
street are changing colour. It may be possible later to give
details of some of the best of the outings.</p>

<h3><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>THE BAW BAW TRACK<br>
* Usually an Easter Outing *</h3>

<p class="pin40">O nurse of many happy streams,<br>
And mother of our infant Yarra.</p>

<p>This is the track on which so many novices metaphorically lay
their bones. For some reason it has caught the popular fancy, with
the result that the budding walker, in all the discomfort of
improper equipment, frequently makes it his first, and last, essay
with the swag. He brings back a tale of trying tracks, of steep
gradients, and bleak uplands, often in curious contrast with the
accounts of more seasoned trampers. The truth is that few of the 50
miles between Walsh's Creek (McVeigh's) on the Upper Yarra and the
railhead at Walhalla&mdash;the 50 miles which constitute the
so-called "Baw Baw Track"&mdash;are easy miles, but they are well
within the compass of any pedestrian who is capable of carrying a
30-pound pack up a fairly graded hill, or has the means to hire a
packhorse to do it for him. In other words, the way is open to all
who are young, and to any whose maturity has really benefited by
experience of such outings. It is time, indeed, that someone spoke
plainly regarding the nonsense so commonly printed that the swag is
a destroyer of all pleasure on a country tour. I bear fardels as
unwillingly as the next man, and I recognise the obvious fact that
it is easier and more enjoyable to walk free than loaded, but I
protest that the pains of carrying one's bed and board are a very
small charge (in this world where everything has its price) for the
perfect liberty so gained, and that no one need divorce himself
from pleasure in doing so.</p>

<p>The Baw Baw track is so named because at its most picturesque
stage it traverses the Baw Baw plateau and gives easy access, by a
side walk of about a mile and a quarter, to the 5130 feet summit of
Mount Baw Baw itself. Three natural divisions mark the route, the
first being the stage up the Yarra Valley&mdash;a long, slow rise,
the next the irregular, but relatively level going of the uplands,
the third the rapid descent into Walhalla. With the commencement of
the bridle track at McVeigh's the way is truly the walker's. For
nearly 16 miles it is a sidling pad winding just above and always
within sight, or at least sound, of the Yarra, here a babbling
stream running at the foot of a steadily deepening valley. Higher
and higher grow the hills, well clothed, particularly on the right
bank, with tall timber and luxuriant shrubs. The slopes above the
river look primeval and un-trodden. But the trail is an old one, as
old as the early mining rushes, and doubtless those resolute
pioneers, the diggers, left little even of this hilly country
unexplored in their search for gold. A reminder of the period is
the unusual blaze on the timber&mdash;a T, to signify the Tanjil
track. Just before the 15-mile post, shown in red on a tree, two
huts come into the picture. Each is of iron, and each is well
constructed to meet the needs of tourists, it being understood that
these bring their own food and bedding. The newer structure has a
cement chimney and cement floor, a couple of large windows, a
table, a form, and some boxes for seats, half a dozen billies, a
frying-pan, a bucket, an axe, a broom, four stretchers, with spring
mattresses (and there are as many more in the neighbouring hut) and
about a dozen mugs and plates. There are two rooms available for
visitors, the space over all being about 50 feet by 15 feet. The
old hut is much smaller, but is weatherproof, and at least a
shelter in rough weather.</p>

<p>On Falls Creek, which joins the main stream at this point, six
picturesque waterfalls occur within a mile and a half of the
camping ground. They are readily accessible, the track to the main
fall (the first) being in good order and of an easy grade. The
other five take a little more climbing to see. The second stage of
the onward journey opens badly with a determined zig-zag, which
joins on to the lower end of a mile-long spur. As you climb, the
Yarra Valley recedes on your left flank; below, on the right, are
glimpses of the Falls Creek. The timber is large, mountain ash in
the main, mingled with fine samples of silvertop, and later,
woollybutt. In the season long lanes of Christmas bush are
flowering here. Some groves of beech through which the track winds,
suggest a stage setting of Fairyland in their still beauty. The
variety is endless, now a group of giant gums, now beech or wattle
groves, now a young forest, here a marshy spot, there a sparkling
stream with its sands aglitter with "new chum gold," always and
ever something to attract and hold the attention. Fourteen miles of
this, including the first crossing of the Thomson River, and the
hut on Mount White-law is in sight. The usual supplies of billies,
mugs, plates and stretchers are here. On a cold and threatening
evening this situation repels, for the outlook is over stunted
snowbush, mostly dead, and is limited by a ring of undistinguished
hills. Water is handy, and this hut marks a definite stage on the
journey.</p>

<p>The fact that the next hut, that on the Talbot Peak of Mount
Erica, is only eight miles away should be appreciated for two
reasons. The negative one is that there is much morass to cross,
which means slow progress; the positive and important one is that
there is so much to see. A day is all too short in which to do
justice to this section and the surroundings of Mount Erica. Some
three miles from White-law a notice-board points out the diversion
to the crest of Baw Baw, and time off could well be taken for this
side excursion. Over St. Phillack's 5140 feet the pad winds,
through snowgums or across moorlands with baby lakes reflecting the
sky, now up, now down, high hills such as Baw Baw, Mueller, and
Tyers rising on the one hand, and on the other St. Gwinear and
Kernot. Unlucky is the tourist who now walks into cloud or mist,
for the views soon become horizon-wide. The charm of interesting
detail gives place to the appeal of great mountains spread as far
as sight will carry. That is what one gains from the windows of
Talbot Hut, for this last and smallest of all the shelter houses is
perched on the edge of a great declivity which drops swiftly some
four thousand feet. Across the gulf rise endless mountain chains,
their scoring valleys clearly indicated in the evening light. Hours
may be spent picking out Feathertop and Wellington, Ben Cruachan,
and other giants, and speculating over those more difficult of
identification, while all the time there sinks into the
consciousness the wonderful blues of the high places, the play of
light and shadow over unending miles of broken country, the
grandeur of lofty peaks and the amazing deeps below them. Speaking
as one who has looked from many of the high hills of the State, I
find this view very difficult to excel.</p>

<p>Now comes the drop to lower levels. The famous descent to
Avernus is not swifter than the first three miles when the track
begins to dip, which it does directly the point of Erica is passed.
In that one league there is a fall of 3500 feet, and in wet weather
that can be a true and continuous test of balance. Remarkable rocks
are seen, a mill is heard screaming in the forest at the foot of
the slide, and a bush track leads one by pleasant ways over the 111
miles into Walhalla, a place well worth visiting in itself, and
apparently soon to be numbered with the departed townships. Unless
the present ventures revive the gold mining, Walhalla in five years
may be no more than a blackberry wilderness. Throughout there is no
difficulty in following the tracks. They are clearly marked and
kept wonderfully free of fallen timber. The department in whose
charge they are certainly does its work well.</p>

<h3><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>PHILLIP ISLAND<br>
* An Easter Outing *</h3>

<p class="pin30">Then longen folk to gon on pilgrimages,<br>
And palmeres for to seken strange strandes.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Chaucer.</p>

<p>Numbers of people are free from the Thursday night to the
Wednesday morning of Easter, and others "take occasion by the hand"
to secure a spell that embraces the remainder of the week. To both
these classes Phillip Island can be recommended. Particularly must
it appeal to the holidaymaker who is a walker with a leaning
towards natural history. Wild life is abundant, and those
interesting creatures, the penguins and the mutton birds, are on
exhibition in their dug-outs in countless thousands. The baby
mutton-bird, by the way, may turn up as a grill, and, properly
browned, he is not to be despised. But he is far more delightful
alive and well and protesting lustily as he is hauled out of his
burrow for examination. He would make a good advertisement for
Somebody's Patent Food&mdash;never was a fatter infant. The
coastline of the island varies in character from the smoothest of
tree-edged sandy beaches on the north to the rocky cliffs of the
southern edge and the fine uplift of that noble headland, Cape
Wollamai. Inland a couple of unusual industries may intrigue the
curious. Phillip Island grows chicory, a blue-flowered plant with a
root like a parsnip, and prepares it for the market; while mustard,
whose yellow flower forms a striking colour scheme in the season,
is another product of the "Isle of Wight of Victoria."</p>

<p class="cpb">Easter Weather.</p>

<p>Easter weather is generally very bad or very good. On it turns
the question of sleeping in or sleeping out. The swag is much the
best for the island, but a note of caution must be struck, for
there is little fun in camping out if "the rain it raineth every
day," as was the case two Easters ago. On the other hand, residence
in Cowes makes a couple of the best walks a bit difficult for a
single day, Wollamai being 14 miles away, and Point Grant, the
nearest approach to the Nobbies, some 11 miles. There is so much
advantage in a swag that I should say risk it if the forecast is at
all reasonable. But, to be on the safe side, carry a waterproof
sheet big enough to use as a ground-sheet and a cover, too.</p>

<p>Alternatively it can be turned into a low tent by hanging it
over a cord tied to a couple of trees so that the edges just reach
the ground. A log or a few stones will keep them in place.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Nobbies.</p>

<p>If the usual practice is not departed from, the s.s. Genista
will run a special trip to Cowes on the Thursday night before Good
Friday, leaving after the arrival at Stony Point of the 5.8 p.m.
train from Melbourne. On stepping ashore, fill up a billy and turn
along the beach a little way to the left for a camp. There is
plenty of tea tree and other shelter. It would save you trouble if
you have written to one of the local storekeepers ordering the
tucker you will need and stating that you will call for it on the
Friday morning. If you follow the route about to be suggested, you
will need two days' provisions with you, and a supply for another
two days, ready to be picked up somewhere on the road. Ask the
storekeeper to send the latter lot on Saturday to the care of
Forrests, about seven miles out on the Newhaven Road. You can call
for it there on the Saturday night. There is a good road to The
Nobbies, likewise an excellent beach, which is a bit longer than
the road, but more interesting. It takes in McHaffie's Reef and Cat
Bay. Near the latter is Swan Lake, and a little beyond the lake is
a house (Phelan's), where drinking water may be had. You have come
about a dozen miles, so there is ample time to choose a suitable
camp and to see what one may of The Nobbies and the Seal Rocks,
lying further out, before night falls.</p>

<p class="cpb">Among the Mutton Birds.</p>

<p>You may have another easy day on Saturday, say 12 miles, to the
hospitable house of Forrest, where it should be reasonably certain
that your second supply of stores is waiting. You have turned back
along the outer beach, where the rollers of Bass Strait have carved
out some striking rock scenery, and you are heading towards Cape
Wollamai. The going is good enough, sometimes on the sea edge, and
sometimes on the cliff. Kitty Miller's is a pleasant little bay
that calls for attention, and, a couple of miles further on,
Pyramid Rock (familiar to all observers of the photographs in
suburban trains) is readily identifiable. The rolling downs at the
back of the cliffs are about 100 feet high and the outlook is
attractive all the time. There is a water hole on the smaller cape
of which the Pyramid once formed a portion, and after another three
miles a couple of swampy places, inland from Sutherland's Bluff,
generally have running water enough for the cooking purposes of the
mid-day meal. Some striking sand hummocks, topped with tea-tree,
come in, and from these it will be seen that the island has
suddenly narrowed to less than a mile wide, and that Forrest's
house is nearby. At the foot of the hummocks, on the land side, is
a spring, which has formed some decent pools. A close-growing
creeper, of the mesembryanthemum type, gives good cover, and the
bags may be spread in anticipation of a comfortable sleep on the
soft sand. The hillside is honeycombed with mutton-bird burrows and
a weird effect is produced by the noises that come from them in the
stillness of the night. It is then that papa and mamma mutton-bird
return with food, and apparently the gossip of the seven seas, for
their expectant offspring. You are lying looking at the starry
night, when a piece of the darkness becomes detached and resolves
itself into a bird, which dives at the nearest hole in the sand and
disappears. Then, beneath you, begins a quaint duet as the parent
regurgitates food and news and the infant complains of the
youngster next door. That's what it sounds like. Coming from the
bowels of the earth as they do, the voices are strange and
wonderful, and no one unacquainted with it would ever guess their
origin.</p>

<p class="cpb">Wollamai the Sea Horse.</p>

<p>Bass named this great granite cape Wollamai because its shape
suggested that of the "Wollamai" or seahorse of Port Jackson. Swags
could be left at the Saturday night's camp, and the billies and
tucker taken for a day's excursion to the headland. There is
running water, a tiny stream which takes a little finding, on the
cliff edge at the east side of the head of the cape. Your camp is
only four miles away. There is a fair approach along the west beach
until the sand ends. On top of the ridge the soil is pitted with
mutton-bird and penguin hollows, and it gradually slopes up till
you are 300 feet above the sea level. San Remo can be seen across
the narrows, and the roofs of Wonthaggi show plainly further east.
Beautiful pinnacles of coloured rock, fretted by wind and tide into
fantastic forms, guard the cape on one side. On the other, near its
neck, is the quarry of magnificent stone, of which so much of the
Equitable Building in Collins Street was built. Altogether,
Wollamai is worthy of a longer visit, and it offers many
temptations to the walker to stay at least one night. Here and
there are some barbed-wire fences, and it is pathetic to see the
number of mutton-birds which have struck them in the darkness and
been killed. It seems a pity that a form of fencing so destructive
of life should be permitted. In leaving Wollamai keep on the
backbone of the land for some interesting experience of sand-hills
before the Newhaven Road is joined. If you have carried the swags
along you could put in the night at Newhaven; if not, return to
your yesterday's lodging.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Choice of Routes.</p>

<p>For your final day on the island, if you are of the many who
resume work on Wednesday, you may go back over part of yesterday's
ground and reach Newhaven in slightly over four miles, or a coastal
road may be taken to Rhyll, which is nearer Cowes, or both places
may be visited if you are feeling in good fettle. The last-named
excursion would mean 18 or 19 miles for the day. Newhaven, on the
island, is less than half a mile from San Remo on the mainland, and
it is there that the telegraph cable connects the two. Formerly the
wire stood on enormously high poles above the water; now it is on
the bottom. The tide that races through this narrow channel is like
a great river in spate, so swift and turbulent is it. Rhyll,
further back in Westernport, claims to be the first place in
Victoria where a settlement was made by white people. A flagpole,
which stood until a very few years ago on a rise in view of the
beach, was said to mark the earliest cultivation. The shoreline on
this side is inclined to be muddy, and is not good going. Variety
may be had by taking one of the inland roads. A camp just outside
Cowes on Monday night will place the party in a good strategic
position to catch the homeward boat at 10 o'clock on Tuesday
morning. Finally, what should have been said in the beginning,
there is an excellent map issued by the Defence Department, and
obtainable from most booksellers at a cost of one shilling, which
shows clearly every detail of the island. It is called the Military
Survey Map of Westernport.</p>

<h3><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>THE BACK COUNTRY<br>
* A Christmas Outing *</h3>

<p class="pin30">The Devil never yet asked his victims to take a
walk with him.<br>
<br>
&mdash;John Burroughs.</p>

<p>Much earlier in the year has the house-father arranged for the
family's Christmas vacation, that is, if he is wise, for never has
there been greater demand than at present upon the hotel and
boarding-house accommodation of the seaside and mountain resorts.
Now the time is ripe for the more adventurous, the younger fry, to
look to their equipment for walk or camp, and to inquire what
routes are open and which will yield the best return. "Many are
called, but few are chosen"&mdash;as usual a relatively small
number of well-known spots will be crowded, and the others, mainly
for want of knowledge, will be rejected. It is to supply that want
that these sketches are offered.</p>

<p class="cpb">Infinite Variety.</p>

<p>There is almost unlimited variety to choose from. I am concerned
altogether with the walker, as distinguished from the camper, who
settles in one spot for the period of his holiday; and I must
assume that he is a pedestrian who is willing to carry a swag. Only
by that means can he penetrate the real "back country," unless, of
course, he takes a pack horse to bear the burden. In any case he
must be willing to sleep out and to prepare his own food. A party
of active people may do much in the ten days following Christmas
Day. They could cross Bogong, the highest peak in Victoria; they
could explore the Bogong High Plains (a distinct trip, and one of
the best in the State); they could see the wild country of Mount
Howitt and the Wonnangatta, and traverse the Dargo High Plains;
they could visit Cobbler the Hunchback, climb the hindquarters of
the Buffalo, and return by way of Porepunkah or Bright; they could
know the sharp ridges of Feathertop, and go by way of Omeo to
Buchan and Bairnsdale; they could stand on the edge of that little
lake which our Gippsland Mount Wellington so jealously hides; they
could fish and bathe, and enjoy the beauties of bold headland and
sandy beach, as they come along the well-watered coast from the
Otway to Split Point; they could concentrate the wonders of many
miles of seashore and mountain range by visiting Wilson's
Promontory. Any one of those outings is possible within the time
stated, and there are many more, equally worthy.</p>

<p class="cpb">Bogong High Plains.</p>

<p>The Plains themselves form only a portion of the outing, which
starts at Bright and ends at Tallangatta. Mount Bogong's 6508 feet
of craggy sides and bare, rounded summit, are not impinged upon by
this route. It swings you almost completely round the mighty
mountain, yielding as it does some glorious views down the deep
ravines which isolate his majesty.</p>

<p>As a preliminary it would be well to write the hotelkeeper at
Tawonga to have stores and a packhorse ready for you. That is
because you must necessarily be several days out of touch with
means of renewing your food supplies. Preferably a man should go
along to bring the packhorse back when you start your descent into
Glen Wills. Tawonga is made in 15 miles from Bright, the road
turning up German Creek to the head of Tawonga Gap. From there the
outlook is extensive, across the Kiewa Valley to the high mountains
beyond. The river, to be harnessed some day in a hydroelectric
scheme, is a typical mountain stream, generally in a hurry, but
often knowing "the comfort of a pool." The track goes up stream
past Tawonga for three miles, crosses on a log bridge, makes a
hurried ascent of some foothills and becomes a siding over another
branch of the Kiewa. Directly opposite, and towering high above
you, is the tremendous bulk of Bogong.</p>

<p class="cpb">Fainter.</p>

<p>Mount Fainter (6160 feet) is the immediate objective. It is only
15 miles from Tawonga, but so steep is the climb, and so trying the
track, that you may be glad to camp for the night at a soak known
as "The Springs," a bare 10 miles for the day. The spell must be
either here or on Fainter; otherwise you may be without water. Two
miles further on, a natural clearing yields a fascinating picture
of the whole length of the Buffalo Range, with the Chalet showing
like a swallow's nest near the skyline. Mounts Buller, Cobbler,
Howitt and many other giants stand up boldly to the west and
south-west. If no other evidence were available, the vegetation
would prove that you are still rising. The mess-mates and their
like have long given way to the woollybutts, to be in their turn
superseded by the gnarled and twisted snowgums. These now vanish
except in sheltered hollows, and short, heathy plants, mingled with
white and mauve daisies, and a beautiful variety of Christmas bush,
take their place. The final slope to Fainter's twin peaks is a
gentle gradient. Faint and far on the skyline you may see
Kosciusko; immediately across the gulf is Feathertop. A good spring
rises near a little grove of snowgums.</p>

<p class="cpb">The High Plains.</p>

<p>Well are they distinguished by the word "high." Their general
level must be well over 5000 feet. They are entered on directly
after leaving Fainter, and they extend for a good many miles. A
well-watered country, the pastures of snow-grass form a fine summer
feeding ground for the valley cattle. Tawonga hut, built by the
cattle-men, is 12 miles from "the Springs," and makes a good point
to camp at, for a creek is handy. From its door the plains roll
away in soft undulations, green and full of charm. Two miles
further is the edge of Pretty Valley, a placid, well-grassed basin
of enormous extent, watered by the sources of the Kiewa. At six
miles Mount Cope will be observed as a gentle rise on the right. It
is really 6015 feet above sea level. A cairn stands on the crest. A
hut, known as Wallace's, is 9½ miles from Tawonga hut, and six
miles further is Fitzgerald's hut. Superb views are visible all the
way, the strangest being down into Rocky Valley, with its quaint
outcrops.</p>

<p class="cpb">Downward.</p>

<p>At Fitzgerald's hut the plains may be said to end. A cattle pad
here enters the timber on a downward grade, and drops you rapidly
through the changing growths to the Big River (the head waters of
the Mitta). Following along the river, the little settlement of
Glen Valley is first reached&mdash;roughly, 10 miles from
Fitzgerald's hut&mdash;and four miles more will land you in the
fast-decaying township of Glen Wills. Above it, and on your way, is
Sunnyside, clinging desperately to a mountain ridge at an altitude
of 3900 feet. It is well to note that the water at Christmas Creek,
four miles further on, is the last for eight miles.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Mitta Valley.</p>

<p>You rise almost over the crest of Mount Wills at this stage. The
well-graded road begins then to drop, for a long distance through a
wonderful forest of woollybutt, until at 20 miles from Sunnyside it
reaches the hospitable Austral Alps Hotel, at Lightning Creek, just
where it joins the Snowy. Trout are plentiful in both streams.
Snowy Creek township (otherwise Granite Flat) brings you once more
into touch with civilisation, for a coach runs here from
Tallangatta. The hotel at Snowy Creek is nine miles from Lightning
Creek. Another six miles, and you are in sleepy little Mitta Mitta,
and so you proceed by way of Eskdale, Tallandoon, and Noorongong
along the river to Tallangatta. The whole distance does not exceed
160 miles, and for varied interest the trip can hardly be surpassed
in Victoria.</p>

<h3><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>OUR NATIONAL PARK</h3>

<p class="pin30">Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures<br>
Whilst the landscape round it measures.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Milton.</p>

<p>It may seem a strange thing to liken Wilson's Promontory to
Venice. The one is an untamed wilderness, practically uninhabited,
the other an ancient city, proud of its civilisation. But if
Venice, in approach, is the dream city the poets and the artists
would have us believe, the thing of faery and glamour they sing and
paint, then our Promontory may claim kinship. Each rises from the
ocean, and I have seen Wilson's Promontory on a blue morning, when
the mists of Corner Inlet only intensified the colour of sea and
sky, seemingly afloat on the surface of the quiet water, too
beautiful to be real. That view was from the deck of a boat
travelling from South-West Corner to Port Franklin, and the month
was January. There are 75,000 acres in this national park of
Victoria, including several mountains over 2000 feet high, many
lovely bays and a number of good streams, so, when I recommend the
place for an Easter holiday, it is implied that it is even better
for a longer spell than the usual Easter vacation affords.</p>

<p class="cpb">How to Go.</p>

<p>There are three or four approved ways of reaching "the Prom.,"
as it is familiarly called. A little steamer may call at the
lighthouse on her trips to the Gippsland Lakes, and provide an easy
and inexpensive method of arriving in the very heart of the good
scenery. No better means could be desired for a party with only the
five holidays (Good Friday to Easter Tuesday) at their disposal,
provided, of course, that the boat sails on the Thursday night or
Good Friday morning. The Promontory is 140 miles from Melbourne by
sea. Assume that you land at the lighthouse by Friday evening; you
could take a leisurely walk on Saturday to Oberon Bay (10 miles),
and camp the night there; come next day to the Darby River, another
10 miles; cross the neck on Monday to South-West Corner, about
seven miles; and, having arranged with a fisherman at Port Franklin
to take you off early next morning, you could catch the afternoon
train at Bennison, and be in Melbournee Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Another way is to drive from Fish Creek (28 miles) or Foster (30
miles) to the Darby River, but coming and going by that route
occupy too much time if the holiday is a short one. A third choice
is open to the same objection, but it is varied and interesting. It
is to make the journey by traitotc Bennison, by fishing boat to
South-West Corner, and on foot to the lighthouse, returning either
by the same course or, if the matter can be so arranged, by the
little steamer. The place is so full of attractions that a couple
of clays at least should be added to the vacation, should that be
possible, if only to permit of going twice over the ground between
South-West Corner and the Lighthouse.</p>

<p>The east coast may also be approached by fishing boat from Port
Welshpool or Port Albert, and landing made at Sealers' Cove (from
which a track goes out to the Lighthouse and the Darby) or Refuge
Cove (lonely and secluded) or at Waterloo Bay.</p>

<p class="cpb">Bear in Mind.</p>

<p>There are several things to be kept in mind. The whole place is
a reserve, and it is necessary to have a permit to camp there. That
may be obtained from Mr. Kershaw, of the National Museum, Russell
Street, Melbourne. It is also a sanctuary for wild life, and no
shooting is allowed. Fishing is, I believe, sanctioned under
certain conditions. There are two good rest-houses, each with water
handy, and each provided with a fireplace, a table, and four bunks.
One of these is at South-West Corner, the other at the Darby. Near
the latter the caretaker resides, and he might be able to provide a
packhorse if it is needed. Everything required in the way of food
and bedding must be taken with you. In the event of a long stay,
the stores could be packed to the house at the Darby, which would
make a comfortable headquarters, and excursions, flying light,
could be taken from there. A house of accommodation, providing good
board and residence, is now established at the Darby. It is known
as the Chalet.</p>

<p class="cpb">Port Franklin to Darby River.</p>

<p>It is idle to attempt a full description of the Promontory
within the limits of one article. The most generally travelled
route will serve to suggest some of the attractions. A train which
leaves the city at 6.30 a.m. reaches Bennison at 1 o'olock, and a
diminutive fish-tram completes the journey to Port Franklin. Tides
have often to be waited for, but, with ordinary luck, the motor
boat you have ordered from the fishermen will soon have you down
the river and well out on the picturesque waters of Corner Inlet.
Swans fly before the boat like a fairy escort, their long necks
outstretched and the white feathers of their wings flashing. Ahead
rise the mountains of your objective, purple and deep blue in the
proper light, astonishingly exalted by their nearness to the sea.
Doughboy Island is passed, and before dark you should be cooking a
meal in the resthouse at South-West Corner. There is another side
to the picture, of course. One such trip was marked by a violent
storm, and the landing had to be made in a darkness like that of
the chaos of Hans Sachs, which was so black, it may be remembered,
that even the cats ran against each other. We crawled into an
invisible "flattie," pulled invisible oars, and presently ran on to
an invisible something which held us firmly. It was a mangrove, and
our boat was in the top branches!</p>

<p>With daylight it will be seen that the view of the Inlet from
the house is very fine, and that at the back is a truly magnificent
forest of banksias. The great vermin-proof fence that cuts the
promontory off from the mainland begins here, and is followed for a
time on the way to the Darby. Gum-forest, moorland, and rolling
downs succeed one another, with the higher hills of the Vereker
Range always to the left, until the open ocean shows, and you drop
down to the dark waters of the Darby, cross the bridge, and find
the second rest-house in a secluded hollow behind the hummocks.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Darby to Oberon Bay.</p>

<p>The ranger will prevent you from trying the beach, which looks
the obvious track to the lighthouse. Instead, you rise some two to
three hundred feet out of the Darby Valley to a ridge from which
you get delightful views of bold headlands separated by curving
sandy bays, while out in the ocean lie the islands which look like
stepping stones to Tasmania. Follow the track to the beach at
Leonard Bay; the sand makes good going and gives out a musical note
at each footstep. Climb over Pillar Point and down to where the
pleasant little Tidal River acts as a highway for the fish. They
come and go in the clear water all day long, an unending
procession. That is in the near corner of Norman Bay. From its far
corner you start on what is known as "the bad saddle." It
thoroughly deserves its name. For 900 feet the gradient is very
severe. It is really a portion of Mount Oberon, and once across it
you drop down first to Whiskey Creek, then to Growler's Creek, and
finally to a good camping ground on Oberon Bay. Splendid sandy
beaches mark this fine bay, and it is a wonderful place for
wreckage and the odds and ends that fall overboard from ships and
get washed ashore. Fraser's Creek on the further side should
provide water.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Bear Garden.</p>

<p>Whether you are usually interested or not in the wild life of
the bush, you cannot fail to observe the native bears in the trees
at the back of Oberon Bay. You leave your camp by a track along the
Fraser. It is not well defined, but it keeps on the north bank and
easterly for 21 miles to the telephone line. Most of that is
through a gum forest, beautiful in itself, but made doubly
attractive by its colony of bears. Every tree had its bear when
last I went that way; some had as many as four. Often they were as
high as they could get; sometimes they were low enough to handle
(with discretion). Numbers had babies clinging tightly to their
backs, either nuzzling nose-in close to their mother's fur or
glancing down with comical gravity at the party. The trustees
estimated in those days that the bear population of the park was
about 10,000. It may be that bush fires have since thinned it out.
At intervals the quaint little creatures are seen from here on
right through to the lighthouse. Even there they were in evidence;
one was found in possession of the barometer box. (I regret to say
that, since the foregoing was written, the forest has been largely
destroyed, and the bears have vanished with the timber.)</p>

<p>From Fraser's Creek the track climbs Martin's Hill and winds
across a high plain covered with grass-tree and button-grass scrub.
Mount Boulder's 1700 feet show conspicuously. It is appropriately
named. On the plain are three big rocks, known as Adam and Eve and
Mother Seigel. Three fine rushing mountain streams (Roaring Meg,
Picnic Creek and Fern Creek) intersect the track. At a clearing you
find yourself well above the lighthouse, which surmounts a bare,
rocky hill, pushed well out from the coast. Many islands are
visible, and in calm weather the shipping comes in between them and
the mainland, along "Little Bourke Street," so near that all the
sounds of shipboard rise up clearly to the tower above. The welcome
at the lighthouse may be taken for granted; "the most hospitable
people in existence," is a fair summary of lightkeepers and their
families.</p>

<h3><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>MANSFIELD TO WALHALLA</h3>

<p class="pin10">There is an inn in the town of Piacenza into which
I once walked while I was still full of immortality.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Hilaire Belloc.</p>

<p>The old mining townships hold much of the romance of Australia.
They link up the present generation, to which the special
significance of such a word as "rush" is quite unknown, with a time
when any reference to gold was a magic strong enough to empty a
city or drive men round the world. Many, very many, of the
once-bustling towns of the goldfields have vanished altogether and
Nature is busy on their sites at her customary work of repairing
damages. Grant, still figuring on the maps as in existence on the
edge of the Dargo High Plains, is a typical example. In its prime
it supported 26 officially-recognised hotels; to-day the wallaby
and wombat keep the courts where diggers gloried and drank deep.
There is now only one building standing, and not one inhabitant
remains.</p>

<p>To walk from Mansfield to Walhalla is to travel through country
rich in everything that pertains to the digging days, except the
gold that created them. Apart from the pleasures of good scenery,
the walk holds a liberal education for the curious in such matters,
and it is a stimulus to imagination. The age-old occupation may
still be seen in being alongside evidences of a past prosperity
pathetic in its decline. A much decayed township on the route is
Woods' Point, and the terminus of the journey, Walhalla, bids fair
to be soon as silent as the place of shades its name recalls.
Fortunately the hotels remain along the track, or enough of them to
ensure accommodation at comfortable stages. The walker has
therefore to carry no more than the changes of clothing he
requires; he need not take a sleeping bag. With a light knapsack
and a waterproof cape he may stride along even in the autumn days
without troubling about the weather, secure that every night shall
bring its inn and that there will be what some may consider the
best part of the tour&mdash;a cheery fire, a satisfying meal, eaten
with the sauce of appetite, and a soft bed to charm away all
physical weariness. Incidentally much may be learnt of what
constitutes the quiet life, and what the "roaring days" meant to
these present backwaters of existence.</p>

<p>The trip is becoming increasingly popular. It has been set out
in close detail by some members of the Melbourne Walking Club, to
whose former honorary secretary, Mr. P. D. Flower, I am indebted
for the following circumstantial account. It is an outing
particularly suitable for Easter if that holiday can be extended to
embrace the remainder of the week.</p>

<p class="cpb">Out of Mansfield.</p>

<p>The main coach road from Mansfield is fairly flat for eight
miles to Devil's River; good place for lunch and a swim (carry
lunch from Mansfield). After the river the route is over hilly
ground. Morgan's Gap (Blue Range), and down to hotel on Howqua
River, 15 miles. Two miles after leaving Howqua is the junction of
the road coming from Alexandra and Darlingford and in another three
miles the Goulburn River is reached. Continue up the river for half
a mile to deserted house on right side of the road. Another two and
a half miles on is Jamieson. Lunch at hotel. In the afternoon the
walk to Ten Mile is good. It follows the Goulburn River through
Kevington. Stick to the main road, which is the prettiest track. At
Ten Mile there is good hotel accommodation. 17 miles.</p>

<p class="cpb">Over the Flourbag.</p>

<p>About three miles beyond Ten Mile the old road (which telephone
wire follows) turns up to the right. Go uphill over the Flourbag,
which is interesting, and shorter than along the river. It is about
10 miles from Ten Mile to the hotel at Knockwood, a good place for
lunch, leaving an easy stroll into Gaffney's Creek. Good hotel
accommodation at Gaffney's Creek. 15 miles.</p>

<p>About three miles beyond Gaffney's is the Al mine, and about two
miles farther on is Raspberry Creek, which is the last water for
some distance. Fill billy for lunch, and carry on. The road is
fairly steep up French's Hill for three miles. Camp for lunch on
saddle. Carry lunch from Gaffney's Creek. A little below the saddle
and on the present coach road is a sawmill. The coach road runs
directly down into Woods' Point, but follow the old coach road,
which opens up some splendid views of the ranges. Therefore, at the
saddle take the left-hand road running up along the top of the
hill; the telephone wire follows it. Branch off to the left
occasionally, and have a look over the ranges to the north and
east. It is pretty rugged going down part of the way towards Woods'
Point, but stick to the old road. Good accommodation at hotel. 14
miles. (If you should have half a day to spare follow Goulburn
River down past the hospital, and out to the old deserted
settlement of Graball&mdash;Gooley's Creek&mdash;or get an order if
possible, and see the Star of the East mine.)</p>

<p class="cpb">Jericho on the Jordan.</p>

<p>There is a main road (41 miles) up to Jericho, but you can
follow up the west branch of the Goulburn past the Star of the East
mine, and to the old battery of the All Nations mine (deserted) at
the head of the creek; and from there pull straight up the hill
southerly to Matlock. Lunch there. From Matlock do not follow the
coach road to Jericho, but the road going down the B.B. Creek past
the Loch Fyne Mine. Just as the road is turning round to the
battery of the mine is a small horsepad keeping on down the creek.
Follow this pad, and have a pleasant afternoon walk down to Jericho
(Jordan). There is an hotel at Jericho. Dip in the Jordan (seven
times). 12 miles.</p>

<p>Two miles from Jericho is the old Red Jacket Hotel. It is closed
now; and about three miles on from Red Jacket you pass a hut on the
left, and later on another hut in an enclosure, then watch
carefully for a turn down to the left to the Thompson River, near
the ruins of an old house and remains of an orchard, and cross
river on a substantial bridge. Lunch here. Bring lunch from
Jericho. The track follows a bit round to the left on the east side
of the river, and then comes a long climb but good grade, which
brings you to the hotel at Aberfeldy. 15 miles.</p>

<p class="cpb">Ichabod!</p>

<p>Aberfeldy people go to Walhalla by road past Sam Beardmore's old
hotel (closed for a long time, but now reopened), it being the
half-way house. Variety may be had, if you are prepared to camp out
one night, by walking via Toombon to Donnelly's Creek one day, and
the next day from Donnelly's Creek into Walhalla. The road is well
defined. At Toombon have a look at the old hotel, hall, etc., which
are quite deserted. About three miles after Toombon the road dips
to Donnelly's Creek. The bridge is broken. Lunch here, bringing
lunch from Aberfeldy. The track then follows upstream&mdash;a
pleasant walk. Small grassy flats, with white gum trees. There was
an hotel at Donnelly's Creek (20 miles), but it is now closed.</p>

<p>Leave Donnelly's Creek early on track up the hill opposite the
hotel&mdash;a stiff 'un. (But we never know what pleasure is until
we've tasted woe!) Then follow to the left a well-defined track,
which, after four or five miles, drops quickly down into Fulton's
Creek. Lunch there, bringing lunch from Donnelly's Creek. A long
zig-zag track leads up to top of range again; eventually it merges
into waggon track, and finally follows down Stringer's Creek into
Walhalla, 22 miles. If any spare time walk down to Thomson Bridge
and catch the train there, or on into Moe.</p>

<h3><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>OMEO AND OUT AGAIN<br>
* A Christmas Outing *</h3>

<p class="pin40">As I came over Livingstone<br>
The day was like a flame,<br>
But suddenly I saw below,<br>
Far and far and far below,<br>
The shining roofs of Omeo,<br>
And said its singing name.<br>
<br>
&mdash;R.H.C.</p>

<p>How many Victorians know snow as other than a distant whiteness,
a milk stain on the blue side of a mountain? How many, in their
native State, have enjoyed the delicious freshness of a snowbank on
a summer day? Yet it quite commonly happens at Christmas time, when
most people have opportunity to make a trip, that the citizen who
leaves Melbourne early one morning may lunch next day at the edge
of a dazzling drift some acres in extent, and within sight of
numberless others. Put in another way, Harrietville may be reached
in 12 hours, and the crest of Feathertop in four more.</p>

<p>But it is not merely the novelty of summer snow that such an
excursion offers. You are in the Victorian Alps, and the scenery is
on a magnificent scale&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">Alps on Alps in clusters swelling,<br>
Mighty, and pure, and fit to make<br></p>

<p>The ramparts of a Godhead's dwelling.</p>

<p>Charm of detail is also present. Insect and bird and flower,
creek and river and winding road, something of interest is never
wanting.</p>

<p class="cpb">Feathertop.</p>

<p>You have reached Bright by train. To save a valuable day for
even better material, arrange to be driven to Harrietville, 16
miles up the Ovens Valley. It is a delightful valley, but how long
it will stay delightful is problematical, for the dredges are
rumbling and roaring along the creek, and in their hunger for gold
they are eating up the fertile soil as a caterpillar strips a
succulent leaf. Ahead, you will suddenly see a distinctive peak,
beckoning like a giant finger, and the driver will say
"Feathertop." Truly it is a beautiful mountain; I know of no other
whose aspect is so alluring. There is ample accommodation in
Harrietville, or, if the open is preferred, a camp may be made by a
little stream which hurries down alongside the track from the
summit. Arrangements could readily be made locally to have the
swags and tucker taken up to the Bungalow (5050 feet).</p>

<p>It is not a particularly stiff climb to the crest of
Feather-top's 6306 feet, for the track is fairly graded. From the
ultimate ridge the outlook is wonderful. Everywhere are mountains,
cut into deeply by gorges which shelter invisible rivers. Across
the immediate gulf rises Fainter, and you know that far below runs
a branch of the Kiewa. Beyond Fainter's double peak stands the
mighty bulk of Bogong, Victoria's highest hill. Mount Cobbler and
the Buffalo, Mount Cope, Mount Wills, and most of the outstanding
features of the Bogong High Plains are readily identified. It is
worth spending the night here to observe the sunset and
sunrise.</p>

<p>Retreat is best made next morning by way of the well-named
Razorback, a ridge about eight miles long, at times a mere
knife-edge of outcrop, at others a succession of rounded tops with
snowgum in the sheltered spots. Snow may be in evidence; flowers
will certainly be. Asters and violets, grevilleas, boronias,
buttercups, and many another beautiful bloom brighten every patch
of soil. The Diamantina Springs, on the slope of Mount Hotham,
provide a good lunching place.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Highroad.</p>

<p>It is literally a highroad which you now join. It is a
oontinuation of the road from Bright which you left at
Harrietville. Instead of crossing Feathertop you could have
followed its curvings for 14 miles up St. Bernard, and spent a
night at, or near, the famous hospice. In any case you will arrive
at the point where you now stand, and find yourself presently
looking down on the world from an elevation of 6100 feet&mdash;the
highest altitude attained by a coach road in Victoria. Vehicular
traffic ceases in the winter, owing to the snow. The gradient is
now easy, water may be had at intervals, and sometimes the way
forgets that it is an important artery of commerce, and masquerades
as a country lane winding through groves of mottled gums and sweet
with the scent of flowering clover. At 22 miles from Feathertop
stands Rundell's accommodation house, empty for a long time but now
with hospitable doors for the traveller. Between the Hospice and it
stands a hut (at the head of the Diamantina Springs) and the Hotham
Heights House, both owned by the Country Roads Board.</p>

<p class="cpb">Into Omeo.</p>

<p>Omeo is 25 miles away. A downward grade makes the first ten
miles easy going, and the pleasant sight of a good stream (the
Victoria River) running briskly below a bridge, and marked by a
rest-house, at which accommodation may be obtained, comes
opportunely into the picture about lunch time. This is
Cobungra.</p>

<p>In undulations the road rises and falls until it meets the slope
of Mount Livingstone. I cheerfully concede that engineers know
their own business best, but there seems some mystery as to why the
highway must climb the tallest peak in the countryside. Long
curves, picturesque, and ever making for the valley, mark the far
side, and Omeo shows from time to time, at first very remote
indeed, a Lilliputian village set out on a clearing, later growing
to a scattered township with some notable public buildings. Mining
gave it birth, and on every hand are signs of old workings, many of
them dating back to that</p>

<p class="pin10">Long ago,<br>
When half the world, with hearts aglow,<br>
Came seeking gold at Omeo.</p>

<p class="cpb">Out Again.</p>

<p>Several possibilities now present themselves. You may turn
towards Glen Wills and pass by way of Sunnyside and Lightning Creek
into the Mitta Valley, and so to Tallangatta; you may make
Bairnsdale through Cassilis and Bulumwaal, or over the Tongio Gap,
and through Bruthen; all worth doing. A pleasant variant is to take
in the Buchan Caves, and so to Lakes Entrance, more particularly as
that route provides some unusual bush walking. Leaving Omeo for
Tongio Gap, the milestone gives it as 74 miles to Bairns-dale. From
the Gap the prospect is of the Tambo Valley, with some tall peaks
gracing the background. A new and well-graded road is hardly to be
recommended; its long curves must add miles to the distance. Bindi,
"where the fragrant pastures are," is seen in the distance as the
route turns down the river to Swift's Creek. This last would make a
suitable camp, and stores may be renewed here next day. Four miles
further on is Doctor's Flat, where you cross the Tambo and make for
Ensay.</p>

<p class="cpb">Buchan.</p>

<p>Ensay also has a store. Beyond is Reedy Flat, where inquiry
should be made for the track, and careful note made of the result,
for, although it is well blazed, it is difficult to follow. It
crosses many ridges and saddles in wild unsettled country, fords
the Timbarra River, winds about in a forest of much charm, where
bell-birds are always singing, and finally descends into Buchan,
"where the caves come from." A day here is well spent. Under the
great willows on the river is a beautiful camping ground, there are
stores from which to draw supplies, and, best of all, there are the
caves to visit.</p>

<p class="caption">Lake Tarli Karng</p>

<p class="cpb">The Lakes.</p>

<p>Buchan to Nowa Nowa is a good forest road 18 miles long, with
Canni Creek breaking it at 10 miles. A launch will carry you down
picturesque Lake Tyers to within six miles of Lakes Entrance
(Cunninghame), or you may catch the homeward train at Nowa Nowa.
Should you go on to the Entrance, boat can be taken to Sale or
Bairnsdale. The whole trip can be done in 10 days, but would be
much more comfortable in twelve. It includes 159 miles on foot, 324
by rail and coach, 83 by steamer.</p>

<h3><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>WELLINGTON AND TARLI KARNG<br>
* A Christmas Outing *</h3>

<p class="pin35">Where forlorn sunsets flare and fade,<br>
On desolate sea and lonely sand,<br>
Out of the silence and the shade<br>
What is the voice of strange command<br>
Calling you still, as friend calls friend,<br>
With love that cannot brook delay,<br>
To rise and follow the ways that wend<br>
Over the hills and far away?<br>
<br>
&mdash;Henley.</p>

<p>Mystery is the very heart of romance, the spur to action, the
incentive to probe and search. Man cannot rest content in face of
the unknown, though to rend the veil may only be to make him
unhappy. Sometimes his reward is worthy of his efforts, as when he
traced the black man's rumor of a "big fellow waterhole" on our
Victorian Mount Wellington and found the placid waters of Lake
Tarli Karng sparkling at the bottom of a basin 2000 feet deep. To
do so he had forced his way up the scrub-covered river valleys or
along the stony beds of the water-courses, had climbed the
razorback of many a long ridge, and had risen well over 5000 feet.
That was a good many years ago, but the way is still difficult, and
the number of people who have visited the summit of Wellington and
seen the lake is still but small.</p>

<p class="cpb">Up the Avon.</p>

<p>The way is difficult, but it is possible, and with a little care
and attention to local direction, or, still better, local guidance,
no one should be at fault. A pack-horse is advisable, for you must
be out of touch with civilisation, if you would do the thing well,
for about a week. Mr. Henry Miller, of Upper Maffra West, is an
authority, and an enthusiast, upon the subject of Wellington and
its tarn, and he has been good enough on several occasions to lead
parties to view them. In the beginning the way, commencing at Upper
Maffra West, is a country road, which later loses its width and
becomes a cattle pad of the most meandering type. Roughly, it keeps
a course up the Avon River, takes the imposing bulk of Ben Cruachan
in its stride, and provides a length of mixed climbing, which
finishes on the top of the Gable End, the most southerly point of
the range, 43 miles from your starting place.</p>

<p class="cpb">Nap-Nap-Marra.</p>

<p>The summit of Wellington (or Nap-Nap-Marra) provides a surprise.
It is a huge, uneven plateau with a good deal of forest, some stony
outcrops, and in the open spaces an abundance of snowgrass on which
the cattle from the valleys fatten in the summer. From the Gable
End to the highest point, where there stands a trigonometrical
cairn, is not less than five miles. On a clear day the outlook is
superb. Southward, on the plains that stretch until they merge into
the skyline, you may see the blue of the Gippsland Lakes; nearer
rise the ranges with Cruachan for sentinel. In the opposite
direction the Buffalo lifts its hump and horn, and Feathertop's
wedge is a conspicuous object; Howitt, Buller and many another of
the giants of our Alps break the skyline at about an even distance;
and for immediate neighbors are the Snowy Bluff, Kent, and the
blunt mass of Tamboritha.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Lake.</p>

<p>A cattleman's hut stands in a sheltered spot, and makes a good
camping place. It is some 2000 feet above the surface of Tarli
Karng. From only one or two points, by the way, is the lake
visible; the top of the mountain might be crossed a hundred times
without revealing the secret. Legend has it that a native hunting a
wombat down the gully was the first to discover the banked-up
waters. It cannot be said that there is now a track to their edge,
but there are a couple of accepted routes, along sidings, over
fallen timber, and through fairly dense bush, which serve the
purpose. By following the creek which rushes past the hut you would
also succeed, but that (I have not tried it) looks a precipitous
and tangled path. The water is in sight as the final descent is
commenced, a steep slope of loose shingle where it is not thickly
covered with scrub. You slip and slide and pull up all standing in
some nice green shrubs which you thank your stars are not prickly,
and the process is repeated ad lib until you finally land on the
stones which pass for a beach. The tiny delta of sand brought down
by a small creek on the north side is worth looking for. Level
ground is scarce, and there you may pitch a camp. Do not leave
without spending a night in this solitude; the experience is
remarkable. And on no account miss a swim in this wonderful
basin.</p>

<p>The surface area is about 23 acres. Soundings made by some
scientists a few years ago gave a then depth of 150 feet. Those
same scientists, three in number, disagreed sadly about its origin.
One put forward the theory that the barrier of rocks which dams the
water back had been dropped by a glacier in those long-departed
ages when Victoria produced huge crops of useless ice. Another held
that a landslip of appalling magnitude was responsible; while the
third could not find sufficient evidence to concur with either of
his colleagues. Certain it is that the valley is choked at its
narrowest by immense boulders which form a barrier there, and
extend clown the gorge in scattered masses. Through the chinks of
the embankment escapes enough water to form a branch of the
Wellington River, later joining the Macallister, and finally
reaching Lake Wellington. Into the eastern end of Tarli Karng pours
a lively creek; probably the lake washes over its natural retaining
wall in times of heavy intake. The waters swarm with a miniature
trout, which is said to be found nowhere else. It is inadvisable to
rely upon these fish as food; their average length appeared to be
about an inch. Bird life is abundant, and nowhere have I seen so
many snakes to the acre as on the sloping sides of this lake.</p>

<p class="cpb">Up and Down.</p>

<p>You climbed 5363 feet to reach the summit, and dropped a couple
of thousand to the water. You have now to rise nearly two thousand
again to emerge from the basin, and to descend about five thousand
to arrive at that ground floor on which most of us live. A long
ridge gives fairly open going, with a dip most of the way to the
Wellington River. Rather poor blazing marks the track, but as it
adheres to the course of the stream, when once that is joined, it
is not difficult to find. For a party in a hurry this route, coming
by way of Heyfield and Glenmaggie, would probably be the better.
Anyone who takes it must be prepared for wet feet. Between the foot
of the range and the settlement of Licola, where a main road takes
up the white man's burden, the river must be crossed at least 45
times, and there is never a bridge. Generally it means no more than
wading to the knees, but occasionally one's coat-tails are in
danger. It is a beautiful valley, with its bold bluffs, on which
the rock wallabies may be seen leaping, and its green flats, where
the water lizards feed and play. A striking gorge is cut at one
point through a barrier of hills; it is worth a special trip in
itself. Soon afterwards, the Wellington becomes obsorbed into the
Macallister, and you join an excellent road, quite fit for
motoring, which leads you past Glen Falloch station and Glenmaggie
to the railway at Heyfield. The whole distance of the tour
described amounts to about 120 miles. Ten days are ample to see
everything in comfort. Provisions for the whole period must be
taken to the top; none is obtainable until Glenmaggie is reached.
From the summit the pack-horses could be sent back, provided you
are willing to be your own beast of burden for the final three
days.</p>

<p class="caption">The 32nd Crossing, Wellington River</p>

<p>Another approach to Wellington is by way of the Dargo Road, as
far as the turn-off to Talbotville, over the range from that tiny
township to the Wongungarra River, across the next ridge to the
Wonnangatta, and up that river to where the Moroka comes in as a
tributary from Wellington itself. The old Tamboritha mining track
is followed up the Moroka to a spot where a very obscure turn-off
takes you, if you are lucky enough to find it, across Knock Up and
Pretty Boy, and so to the Long Plain, just beyond the far end of
which is Miller's Hut, a convenient centre from which to visit the
lake or from which to start for home, clown either the Avon track
(over the Gable End) or the ridge which leads to the Macallister
River and Licola.</p>

<h3><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>THE HUNCHBACK<br>
* A Christmas Outing *</h3>

<p class="pin30">Give me a road that winds among the hills,<br>
Some mountain myrtles in a cloudy sky,<br>
And be not niggardly with mountain rills,<br>
And cool retreats for all things moist and shy,<br>
And let me hear the lyre-bird's luscious notes,<br>
Thieving the ballads from his neighbors' throats.<br>
<br>
&mdash;R. H. Long.</p>

<p>Cobbler is not the greatest peak of our Alpine system, but it is
one of the most remarkable and probably the most easily identified.
A range like the Serra, in the Western District, with its saw-edge
fretting the evening sky; the aggressive thrust of Feathertop's
great wedge into the blue; hump and horn of the Buffalo from
whichever point you view that plateau of wonders; the hunchback of
Cobbler&mdash;these are natural features which make for
remembrance. In Cobbler's case the distinctive note is struck by a
massive projection, like the horn of a rhinoceros, which is almost
cut off from the main hill and towers well above it. It breaks the
orderly outline of the mount, as seen from below, and gives it
character. There can be no confusing it with any other peak, so it
serves a useful purpose when you are surveying that rugged
landscape and "placing" the points of interest. From it, or near
it, spring the waters of three pleasant rivers, the Buffalo, the
Rose, and that last, whose name is like "the mellow lin-lan-lone of
evening bells"&mdash;the Dandongadale. All three may be included in
a Christmas trip to Cobbler.</p>

<p class="cpb">Typo.</p>

<p>Go to Wangaratta one evening by train, and next morning take the
narrow gauge to Whitfield. If you have written to Mr. Victor
Tiernan, of Typo, you will be met by a conveyance which will carry
you and your swags and provisions over Gentle Annie and the 20
miles of hill country which lie between Whitfield and his
hospitable homestead. He will also supply you with pack-horses.
They are necessary if you would stay long enough to do it justice.
Seven miles of good, open forest country lead you past Mount Typo,
a sequence of bare rocky knobs, and in its shadow you will find the
Rose River. There is a well-defined track across Button's Flat and
up the river till, as the reward for a stiffish climb, you reach a
saddle known as Wild Horse Gap, and find the Dandongadale Valley
below you and Cobbler breaking the skyline in the distance. At 12
miles from Tiernan's the Dandongadale is crossed where a rocky ford
shallows the current below a pool which is obviously designed for
bathing.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Dry Stretch.</p>

<p>There may be water somewhere in the next 15 miles, but, if so,
it is so skilfully hidden as to be unfindable. So carry enough to
wet your mouth occasionally. The track must be carefully watched
for. Generally it is on the backbone of a long ridge, and sometimes
there are blazes to help you, but these latter are frequently
missing at the difficult spots, as, for example, when your ridge
ends and you must choose which saddle is to carry you on. The spurs
are well wooded, but open enough to yield fair going and some good
downward views. Lang before you put foot on the actual body of
Cobbler, you will see him just across the valley to the right, and
get tantalising glimpses of one of the finest waterfalls in
Victoria. It plunges over the centre of an ampitheatre of rock
which it has apparently been the principal agent in forming, and
the first of its successive leaps is many hundreds of feet in sheer
descent. Above that fall is your camping ground. The track rises
and dips and rises again, becomes a siding through bracken, and
ends on a flat by a swamp which mothers a cheery little stream.
Unload the packs and select your beds; you will find no better
place than this on the mountain&mdash;or, perhaps, anywhere else.
Big trees shade it, there is good snowgrass to lie on, water is
handy, and you have but to move a hundred yards to realise you are
5000 feet above the common level of earth.</p>

<p class="cpb">"Good Hunting."</p>

<p>All about you is a fine confusion of attractions, sufficient to
keep you interested for many days. You may follow the small stream
over the edge and work cautiously down and down, opening out
strange views until the great fall is immediately above you, and
you find it wise to return. Even better is it to cross the upland
to where the main stream has carved out a marvellous valley from
the conglomerate. Here are pools so deep that they shine like green
jade. Over the smooth warm rocks they spill their cool waters,
sometimes down long narrow gutters into holes man-deep and but
little wider, sometimes across ledges which turn the rush into
falls and rapids, always between high banks crowned with
timber.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a name="image-7" id=
"image-7"></a><img alt="" src="1402821h-images/openroad-7.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">The Crest Of Cobbler: 5349 Feet</p>

<p>This is the infant Dandongadale, soon to seek its better-known
bed many thousands of feet below, by the heroic method of leaping
from the cliff top. Three miles further, and you may ascend a
gentle slope to the extreme crest of Cobbler, 5349 feet. Very
extensive is the outlook over mountain ranges, intersected by deep
river valleys. Given a fine day, this alone would justify the trip.
Beyond the sheer edge rises the curious second peak. It is
connected with the principal mass by a strip of rock such as one
reads of in the romances of Rider Haggard. But it is not hard to
scramble over and climb the semi-detached monarch. Many other
excursions are possible, for the summit of Cobbler is a huge
place.</p>

<p class="cpb">Down the Rose.</p>

<p>Returning by the same route you must come again to Typo. The 27
miles from the summit make a very full day indeed, and it may be
found well to split the journey into two. From Tiernan's turn clown
the Rose River, a beautiful track which follows the stream's
windings among the lesser hills, now across a flat, again by way of
a siding, until at nine miles the Dandongadale is crossed for the
last time, and at about 11 miles the junction of the Rose and the
Buffalo is reached. You are carrying tucker all the while, having
renewed supplies from the stock originally taken to Tiernan's. The
Buffalo Range towers above you, the Horn the nearest of the
prominent objects. The road is a main one, heading for Myrtleford.
It hangs pretty closely to the course of the Buffalo River, which
is a considerable stream since it absorbed the Rose and
Dandongadale. Half a day's tramp ahead is Macaulay's, where it is
advisable to make certain of the warrigal of a track you must take
if you would climb the Buffalo from this side. No royal road lifts
you by easy gradients here; the ordinary tourist would not
recognise his popular resort.</p>

<p class="cpb">"Over the Top."</p>

<p>You are on one of the numerous spurs which the range pushes out
into the valley, and you must stick to it, always mounting, for a
whole day. As is usual on these ridges, water is wanting. There are
a few places, however, where it occurs, and by leaving the track
and working down the slope below, where Mount Signal lifts his
handsome head, you may reach a good stream, one of the numberless
Sandy Creeks of Victoria. If you must camp before the summit, this
is the spot. The mountain-side is well clothed, and fields of wild
hops are not uncommon, most difficult stuff to follow a trail
through. As you near the top some baby snow-plains are met with,
each possessing its tiny creek, often running crystal clear over
granite sands. You eventually find the level of the main plateau
near Mount Dunn, roughly halfway between the Horn and the Chalet.
The natural order of things is to work back to the Horn, then
forward to the Gorge, taking in most of the noteworthy sights en
route. It is idle to attempt a description of this much-described
wonderland. It is, indeed, a beautiful place, worthy of all the
praise which has been lavished upon it.</p>

<p>The railway at Porepunkah or Bright is a day's march away. You
have choice of the great, well-graded road or several rougher, but
shorter, bridle tracks to reach the flats. Whichever you take you
will find it full of charm.</p>

<p>A walk is not over when it is finished. The leisurely progress
of the pedestrian makes for remembrance, and the man who has once
tasted the "glorious feast" of liberty which the swag and the billy
ensure will often find himself travelling over the ground again at
the bidding of a sight, a scent, or a sound, and that without
moving from his desk or his suburban garden. He may even enjoy the
outing in retrospect more than he did in reality, for the
hardships, if any, are softened in the passing of the years, and
serve only to brighten the rest by force of contrast.</p>

<p>And how good the rest is! The memory could not hold in detail
all the fine things that may be gathered in a week in our back
country, or, indeed, almost any part of our bush, but every mind
will select the items which most appeal to it and hang them, like
proofs signed by Nature, in its galleries. A shining river bend,
seen from a height, looking</p>

<p class="pin10">"...as if Diana in her dreams<br>
Had dropped her silver bow<br>
Upon the landscape low;"</p>

<p>a craggy hillside of fantastic shape; the scarlet of a tiny
fungus at a tree root; a wattle in flower above a still pool; night
and the camp fire, a mopoke calling, and vivid stars tangled in the
tops of tall green trees; a lyre-bird surprised at his dancing
mound; groups of half-wild cattle, all agaze, on the open spaces of
the snow plains; a track vanishing over a rise; clouds beneath your
feet, more seeming-solid than mother earth, a world which blots out
a world; the incredible bulk of a huge mountain, and on its
terrifying crest the bathos and the pathos of a small bird's
nest&mdash;these are what stay with you.</p>

<p class="cpb">No Better River.</p>

<p>A judicious blend of river and mountain, of lonely out-station,
and little mining township, of the unknown track and the tourist
highway, may be had by going from Mansfield across Mount Howitt's
5715 feet to the Wonnangatta River, then to Talbotville and the
deserted township of Grant, and by way of the Dargo High Plains to
Mount St. Bernard, Harrietville, and Bright. Much of it is cattle
country; some depends, or used to depend, on mining; all of it is
full of interest. The fly in the ointment is the need for carrying
tucker, but this may be obviated by using a pack-horse. There is no
store between Merrijig and Talbotville, say, a five days' journey
on foot. A flying start could be achieved by driving, with your
supplies, over the 12 miles from Mansfield to the Howqua Hills,
where the really picturesque country begins. Soon after you start
to walk you reach the Howqua River, and pass the shell which was
once the Howqua Hills Hotel. A water-wheel marks a long-abandoned
enterprise.</p>

<p>The stream is now your guide. Surely none more attractive ever
existed. To paraphrase the saying of the Bishop with regard to the
strawberry: Doubtless God could have made a better river, but
doubtless He never did. The water is tonic in its freshness, and
there is that cheeriness about it which ever distinguishes the
mountain creek. It will rush and ripple over shallows, to swirl in
deep basins whose banks are draped with native plants and flowers,
and whose depths shelter trout with jewelled sides. A well-defined
cattle-pad affords very fair going until it takes to crossing the
river bed, which means wet feet every few miles. There are about
thirty crossings, and never a bridge.</p>

<p class="cpb">Snow Poles.</p>

<p>A zig-zag path, rather poorly blazed just here, leaves the river
for the ascent of Mount Howitt, glimpses of which you have had
occasionally coming up the valley. A woollybutt forest indicates
that you have risen considerably, and you will begin to notice the
Alpine flowers coming in, including three varieties of violet, and
daisies (or asters) of white and heliotrope and purple. An
outstanding bluff, with snow-gums, at the west end of the mountain,
overhangs you and gives an illusive promise of being the top; you
must pass on and upward for a long way yet. As the outlook expands,
the scenery grows grander, until, from the summit, you find
yourself surveying a wonderful panorama of great peaks, and valleys
whose deeps are down among the shadows. Mount Magdala is a
conspicuous figure across the gulf to the south.</p>

<p>The head of Howitt is a plain, used, as all the high plains are,
by the cattleman for summer feed for his stock. Cattle and horses
stop feeding to regard you curiously, or they pack about you, at
once bold and shy, in the hope of salt. A line of snow poles
indicates the way you must go. They cross the width of the mount.
Water is not exactly plentiful, so you must keep a lookout for a
spring (really the headwaters of a branch of the Macallister
River), whose source is a narrow ledge on the route. This makes a
fair camping place.</p>

<p class="cpb">Wonnangatta.</p>

<p>The name Wonnangatta is now associated with a murder committed a
few years ago, the perpetrators of which are still at large. It was
really a double murder, for the body of the station cook was found
shortly after the manager was shot. One of the district theories is
that the crime was committed by cattle duffers. It illustrates the
real remoteness of this belt of hill country from civilisation, a
remoteness not to be measured by distance, for it is, after all,
only 150 miles in a direct line from Melbourne. As you leave Mount
Howitt's crest, not long after passing a basaltic outcrop, the
descent is very steep. You join Basalt Creek, and eventually come
into a green pasture land, where the view is like a welcoming
smile. You are now in the Wonnangatta Valley, and a couple of miles
ahead of you is the station, once owned and occupied by the
hospitable family of Bryce. Never was a surer welcome than in this
lonely homestead&mdash;a self-contained community with but little
contact with the outside world. No wheeled vehicle has yet come
into that valley, for there is no bridge across the rivers, and the
only tracks are cattle-pads winding and twisting around the steep
hillsides, and splashing through the fords. Cattle are the be-all
and the end-all of this life, and the packhorse the means by which
all commodities are brought in.</p>

<p class="cpb">Moving Out.</p>

<p>Twenty miles away, down stream, is the nearest neighbour, a
solitary settler, who has led a bachelor existence here for many
years. You have passed en route the spot where the Moroka pours its
waters from Mount Wellington into the Wonnangatta, and presently
you wade the latter river for the last time and climb a long ridge
to reach the valley of the Wongungarra. Here you shall behold a
bridge again. Still another stiff pull and you are above the course
of the Crooked River, with Talbotville seen far below you like a
toy village. A gradually ascending seven miles from there brings
you to the plateau where stand the remains of the ancient mining
township of Grant. There are still buildings to suggest the days
when 26 hotels were not too many to supply the needs of the
thousands who gathered here to dig gold, but not a. single
inhabitant remains.</p>

<p>You are near the edge of the Dargo High Plains, and to gain them
you must turn east along a cart track until you reach "the springs"
(an old notice board stood here, marked "To Bousteads"), then north
across the shoulder of Mount Ewen. Despite the fact that the map
names Twelve Mile Creek and Eighteen Mile Creek as crossing the
track, the water is uncertain in the hot weather. Gow's old hotel,
one time the Dargo High Plains post office, is merely a collection
of empty buildings, but there are two good wells here. Treasure's
Homestead is next seen, and you pass up Lankey's Pinch to the
plain. An astonishingly good road is eventually picked up. This
leads out over Freezeout to the Hospice on Mount St. Bernard. A
long but easy drop follows to Harrietville, and you are then only
16 miles from the railway at Bright. The distance in all is about
160 miles. For variety and interest the trip can hardly be excelled
in Victoria, and it provides a liberal education in the life of the
people who have pioneered our bush.</p>

<h3><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>"DOWN THE ROAD TO LORNE"<br>
* A Christmas Outing *</h3>

<p class="pin30">West away from Melbourne dust, holidays
begin&mdash;<br>
They that mock at Paradise woo at Cora Lynn&mdash;<br>
Through the great South Otway gums sings the great South Main,<br>
Take the flower and turn the hour and kiss your love again!<br>
<br>
&mdash;Kipling.</p>

<p>A completely satisfactory definition of beauty is still to seek.
Like so many other things, it can be more easily illustrated than
explained, but even then one cannot expect complete agreement.
There are some who, quite honestly, cannot comprehend the charm of
the Laughing Rembrandt; there are many who are left cold by the
loveliness of our Bush. Few, however, could take the track which
follows the coast line from Cape Otway to Lorne without admiring
that country of constant streams and tall timber, of bold capes and
rounded headlands, of cosy bays whose sands slip smoothly into
deep-blue seas or shake beneath the tumult of the surf. I know no
stretch of the Victorian coast which is more attractive than that
connecting Apollo Bay and Lorne, and perhaps the cream is the cliff
portion between Apollo Bay and Cape Patten. That ideal combination,
continuity and change, is afforded throughout the whole trip. The
Christmas vacation is an excellent time to make it, for (with
reasonable care) there is excellent bathing, and the nights are
mild enough to enjoy the sleeping out. There are sufficient
townships to solve the prosaic problem of tucker, and rockfish and
crayfish may be had from the sea, and mullet from the river mouths,
to vary the menu.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Approach.</p>

<p>There are many ways of approaching the Otway. Rail to Beech
Forest will give an attractive jumping-off place, which then offers
a choice of two routes. The more strenuous is begun by crossing the
Aire River, and making, by tracks which require local guidance,
almost straight for the lighthouse. It is a picturesque way, but
has many disadvantages. It is not easy to follow, and I have seen
it, even in summer, with long stretches of knee-deep mud. A famous
tree on this route is known as Cape Horn, mainly, I believe,
because of the stormy passage the track yields just there. The food
supply, too, is a burden. Sufficient must be carried from Beech
Forest for at least three days, for, although lighthouse people are
the most hospitable of folk, it cannot be assumed that they are
always in a position, so far from towns, to supply your wants.</p>

<p>Better is it to spend the first day travelling the 17 miles of
vehicular track into Apollo Bay, in itself a delightful walk, which
illustrates well the great Otway Forest. There you may sleep for
the night on a sandy beach, so long, so wide, and so firm that it
serves occasionally as a racecourse&mdash;one of the few courses in
the world, I should imagine, with a mile straight.</p>

<p>Alternatively, Apollo Bay could be reached by walking from
Forrest railway station over Mount Sabine, across Koorangie (Mount
Anna) and by way of Skene's Creek. The view from Sabine is
extensive indeed. Peaks as far away as Mount Rouse (near Hamilton),
Mount Cole (near Ararat), Mounts Buninyong and Warrenheip (near
Ballarat), Mount Elephant, Mount Leura, the Warrion Hills, and
others, stand out like sentinels above the plains, and the great
sheets of Lake Colac, Lake Corangamite, and similar waters flash
back the sun.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Otway.</p>

<p>It is fifteen miles from Apollo Bay to Cape Otway, so you must
carry food for two days. With time to spare, a few days could be
profitably spent at Blanket Bay, where the "Lady Loch" lands the
lighthouse stores, five miles this side of the Cape. A local
storekeeper would pack supplies to the spot. As you leave Apollo
Bay the Barham River is crossed near its mouth, and an upward
gradient gives an outlook worth turning to see. The Elliott River
marks the forest proper. It is not advisable here to attempt "short
cuts," seductive as some of the timber tracks look. A charming
little stream, the Cleary, will be found at this season gay with
the profuse blooms of the Christmas Bush, shining in a tangle of
blackwood, leatherwood, and wild mulberry, above which tower huge
gums. It is a veritable paradise for small birds, which "maken
melodie" on every hand. The track is not bad for walkers. Just past
Jack's Hut Creek are the so-called Grass-tree Plains, and the
turn-down to Blanket Bay succeeds them. As the lighthouse is
neared, the country becomes more open. The tower, with its cluster
of dwellings, tops a cliff of some height, but much less imposing
than many another headland on the saine coast. In returning,
Blanket Bay could be visited. Leaving there, little pad at the back
of the boat-shed will be found a genuine short cut, saving a couple
of miles.</p>

<p class="cpb">Cape Patten.</p>

<p>Refill the tucker bags in Apollo Bay for a two days' march,
about 27 miles, to Lorne. You have been on the cliff-tops up to the
present, now it is possible to get some beach walking. When the
sand gives out, a road lifts you naturally until it becomes a
siding which commands the coast line for many miles. Now it dips to
a bridge, now curves round a height, and all the while beneath it
the ocean's blue is edged with a changing fringe of white foam, and
always there beats upon the ear the murmur of the surf. Ahead, the
view is closed by the great bulk of Cape Patten, with the sea
breaking at its base. It is nine miles from "the Bay." By making a
detour of a mile here the Carisbrooke Falls may be seen. The Cape
is a smooth, grassy spur that curves so swiftly that it is a grisly
business crossing its face. Much better to climb over the top.
Speaking from memory, the height is about 800 feet. Caves penetrate
this seemingly solid headland, and may easily be reached by
ascending from the water's edge. But they have not been developed,
and do not repay the trouble of a visit.</p>

<p>Again you descend to the beach. The going is sometimes rock,
sometimes sand. Fresh water streams are plentiful. The Kennett and
the Wye Rivers are succeeded, at nine miles from Patten, by the
Jamieson&mdash;a good camping ground. Forward are some big
headlands, and you know that behind one of them is Lorne.</p>

<p class="cpb">"Where the Erskine Leaps."</p>

<p>Lorne dominates this trip as it dominates the whole coast from
the Otway to the Barwon Heads. It is the real Mecca of the
pilgrimage, even though it be not the terminating point.
Wonderfully sheltered by its backbone of wooded hills, fortunate in
the easterly aspect of its bay, it deserves its popularity. It has
been well said that while other places may have a better beach,
better rivers, better hills, better bush walks, none has such a
wonderful combination of these as Lorne. To reach heaven it is held
by many that purgatory must be passed through. You get your
purgatory on some two miles of broken rock between the Wye and the
Cumberland Rivers. From the rocky gorge that marks the Cumberland
mouth a five-mile track winds picturesquely above the sea into
Lorne, crossing the St. George en route. On the other side of the
township you will find the best known of the rivers, the Erskine,
with the road bridging its mouth.</p>

<h3><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>A TENT ON BUFFALO</h3>

<p>A lyre-bird generally opened the morning for us. Of course, the
kookaburras and the magpies had been at it long before, but they
became like the sunrise and many another fine thing&mdash;too much
a matter of course to be specially noted. It took the lyre-bird to
chase sleep away definitely. There was something fresh and
compelling in his call, as though Pan blew his pipes on a mad day
of spring. Youth and the spirit of the untamed bush were in the
vibrant notes; the pulse quickened, and instincts stirred which
were a part of man when the morning stars sang together for joy at
the creation. Visions were born; we saw blue dawns with the smoke
rising straight through the frosty air, and stern nights full of
the rush of stormy winds. We heard the melody of mountain creeks,
the still, small voice of those tiny streams that thread the snow
plains, the songs of other birds, the multitudinous harmonies of
the wild. More wakeful, we were less impressionable, but then the
music stopped. The tent stood across a little gully which sloped to
the north. From its doorway we had a glimpse of Lake Catani, no
more than a hundred yards away, sparkling through the trees, and
behind it the dark wooded wall that carries the Monolith on its
shoulder. The lyre-bird's call came invariably from across the
water, apparently out of the edge of that interesting flat known as
the Long Plain. He seemed solitary, and, indeed, we found occasion
to wonder that he should stay on the plateau at all. After the fat
hillsides of the Dandenongs, and those richly soiled ranges between
Healesville and Warburton, which we usually associate with this
species, the granite sands of the Buffalo slopes and creek bottoms
look barren places from which to scratch a living. We heard a
couple more of the birds later on, one on Lyrebird Hill (he was
whistling, by the way, after the dark had fallen, an unusual
happening in my experience), and still another was seen near the
Chalet. That was the total for ten days. The evidence may be
altogether too slight, but I should say that lyre-birds are neither
numerous nor prosperous in this popular holiday resort.</p>

<p>And how do they live, they and the other ground-scratching
animals, when the snow comes? It lies deep some winters. Do they
move "downstairs," in a restricted migration that lasts but a few
months, or do they endure, more or less philosophically, what must
be, at times, a hard fight with starvation?</p>

<p>The rabbit, numerous as he is in the Buckland and the Ovens
Valleys, has not yet climbed the hillsides, and it is said that the
fox is a rare visitor. Dingoes there were, and probably still are;
it was almost certainly one that we saw on the bank of the new
reservoir this Christmas time. He did not wait to be
identified&mdash;just a glimpse and a movement in the scrub, and he
had vanished. The rocky caves and shelters should appeal to the
wild dogs in the mating season. They would, presumably, come to
these heights, as the blacks did, on special occasions, and leave
when the rigours of winter made living there uncomfortable. At the
foot of the Horn I found a cutting-stone, a stone altogether
different from the rocks of the locality, sharpened for use by some
patient aboriginal artificer, and dropped there (how long ago?) on
a tribal visit, possibly to feast on the Bogong moth.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Place of Wonders.</p>

<p>The Horn is a place of wonders, and not the least of them is the
series of crannies which hide the Bogong moths from the glare of
day. Pause in one of these semi-caves, and you will be aware, first
of all, of a heavy, dusty odour, and then that you are standing on
something which crushes softly beneath your feet. Narrowing your
eyes in the gloom, you find the rock walls are covered thickly with
a dark scale, a scabrous-looking excrescence which might be a
coarse lichen bred of the want of sunlight. Pass a stick over it,
and the mass pours down to your feet, a living cataract of moths.
Only an odd one attempts to fly; the others seem asleep. The floor
is already covered with wings and desiccated bodies; they form the
carpet you have been treading on. Probe with your stick farther
into the recesses, and the amazing volume of falling insects
increases until the cave is full of the dry rustle of their
descent, a thin, obscene dust rises and chokes your breathing, and
you are glad to step again into the clean outside air. Look back
and you will see the earth as a yeasty ferment of dark-grey matter,
twisting and tormented, as the creatures, hardly discernible as
individuals, crawl over and between the living and dead bodies of
their fellows. From this, one by one, they begin to climb slowly up
the rock again to the more shadowed crevices. More and more and
more join this slow race, until the wall is seemingly alive, for
its whole surface is moving. As evening falls they stream out to
fly to and fro in the apparently aimless questing of their tribe. I
have seen these moths in millions on the summit of Mount Bogong
itself, and on several other big peaks of our Alps. When one
remembers that they are the "cutworm" or "take-all-grub" in its
winged form, one wonders, not that the farmer is sometimes eaten
out of house and home by these creatures, but that he ever reaps a
crop at all! It is said that the natives used to collect them in
great numbers, singe off their wings, and pound the bodies into a
(more or less) savoury paste for food purposes. Doubtless birds,
too, would take heavy toll of them. But the blacks are gone, and
the nocturnal habits of the moth must protect it from numerous
enemies.</p>

<p class="cpb">Tame Birds.</p>

<p>Birds may be found in greater numbers in many places, but surely
nowhere are they tamer than they showed themselves on the Buffalo.
Every morning before we were astir, a pair of bell magpies brought
a hoarse-voiced youngster to help clean up the camp of food scraps
we had deliberately left out for them and any other feathered
visitors who cared to call. From boyhood memories we dug up many
names for these handsome birds. "Peter Kling" was one ancient
combination based on the clear call that is their commonest note.
"Grey magpie" was another, and "grey jay" a third. "Strepera" was
the contribution of a more learned member of the party. Big,
sedate, quiet birds these two were, and their solitary child,
though young enough to still demand feeding, was little short of
them in stature and plumage. They would stalk unconcernedly within
a few feet of the open door of the tent, pause to gaze fearlessly
back at their observers, and continue their stroll. As either
father or mother discovered a piece of bread or other camp refuse,
the ever-hungry youngster would hasten towards them, drooping his
wings and uttering his appeal in a voice like that of a young
magpie with a bad cold. So helpless did he profess to be that if a
portion of the food fell from his beak he waited for the parent to
retrieve it and offer it again. We were to see his discomfiture,
however; really, his start in life as an independent bird. One
morning he hobbled across (he affected a queer, stiff-legged run
when acting the part of a helpless baby) to where his father stood,
not more than five feet from me, with a newly-found morsel in his
beak. With open mouth he paused before his parent, quite certain
that the scrap was his. But dad had other views; it was time
Johnnie did something for himself. In one movement he had swallowed
the food and thrown himself on his offspring, who squawked with
terror as he was hustled off the premises. Then father resumed his
stately march, and Johnnie, after a few petulant squeaks, began to
forage for himself. More aggressive were two fine magpies, also
with one child, who likewise acted as camp-clearers. They made
short work of the others when in the mood for battle, and in the
absence of the adults the youthful magpie would often attack his
much bigger cousin. There would be a rush of wings, a snap of
beaks, a sound of helpless flopping amongst the branches, and then
the utter rout of grey by black and white. The cake of soap in its
tin dish on the stump sorely tempted both these families. I watched
father Grey examining it closely one morning while the infant
waited the verdict. Father's energetic beak shake said vulgarly and
emphatically, "Nothing doing."</p>

<p>A red-wattle bird sat on its nest close by the camp, and two
well-grown young ones foraged at our feet one day, working the low
scrub for insects so close to us that every detail of their plumage
could be noted, and it was quite possible to touch them. Blackcaps,
too, those charming honey-eaters, were feeding their infants
everywhere, and paid no regard whatever to our presence in their
dining-room. Mother and father were kept busy in some seeding
growths near the lake, the little voices ever calling, the yellow
mouths always open for more. The singing honey-eater and the
spinebill were also much in evidence, and gave plenty of proof that
they do not restrict themselves to a diet of honey. I saw one of
the singers take a dragon-fly (heard him, too, for he took it at my
very ear) and carry it off to where I suspect he had a nest full of
babies.</p>

<p class="cpb">Lake Catani.</p>

<p>This is no attempt to catalogue the Buffalo birds. Three more,
however, must be named. As we lunched at the foot of the Horn a
sudden scurry of crows filled the air. One moment there was no sign
of a crow, the next they were coming from everywhere. The rocks and
snow-gums gave them up, more and more, till there was a noisy flock
of some hundreds, cawing and twisting about in the air in a state
of the wildest excitement. It was not easy at first to account for
this volcanic outburst. Then, high above them, we saw Audax the
Bold, the great wedge-tailed eagle, sailing his wide circles with
calm wings. His presence was probably the cause of the disorder,
but he gave no sign. Not the least notice did he take of the noisy
mob, which gradually melted away as its members returned to cover.
At least one brood of young ducks made long ripples on the waters
of the new weir, and there were always a few adult specimens on
Lake Catani. It blew a gale one night as I went for a bucket of
water. A rock made a good dipping place. On its lee side rose a
tuft of rushes, and nestled in the shelter they gave was a sleeping
duck. Had I been a fox it was mine. The wind drowned the noise of
my approach, and I was actually leaning over the biotheren we
discovered each ether. He squawked with terror as he dived, and I'm
not sure that I didn't squawk, too. It seemed, for a moment, that a
piece of the solid rock had come to life.</p>

<p>Daily the picturesque cavaattendanthe coach and its attend-apt
donkeys passed us ooccasion-ollythe Horn, and occasionally a
visitor from the Chalet came along on foot. Otherwise, we had all
the solitude anyone could desire. The whole of this upland world
seemed ours, and it was all good. Wild flowers shone
everywhere&mdash;gold and white everlastings, violets nodding on
long stems above the softest of beds, mint Lushes with blooms
ranging in tone through white and heliotrope and emerald, that gay
scarlet Grevillea which Von Mueller named after Queen Victoria (the
last of its bright petals were just falling), orchids of several
kinds, daisies, and asters, and how many more. Fish jumped in the
lake, the air was tonic, and just to be alive and well up there was
"very heaven." What did it matter that every weather known to
science, including a snowstorm, made us wonder at the "summer"? It
only served to add a further charm of variety to the attractions of
the place.</p>

<h3><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>KOSCIUSKO, THE TOP OF
AUSTRALIA<br>
* A Christmas Outing *</h3>

<p>The highest portion of Australia, as seen in the summer, is a
conical hill, grey-green on its steep slopes, where the young
snow-grass is just pushing through the dead remains of last year's
crop, mottled all over with granite boulders, splashed here and
there with snowfields, and crowned with a final outcrop of bare
rock. A well-built trigonometrical cairn completes the picture.
This is Mt. Kosciusko, 7328 feet high, and two miles north stands
another giant, Mt. Townsend, 7260 feet, while all around are
elevations dwarfing most of the peaks we are accustomed to in
Victoria. Everything is on a huge scale, and for a time it is hard
to estimate size and distance.</p>

<p>Kosciusko is in New South Wales, but a bare 16 miles from the
Victorian border. A motor road leads to its summit on the Sydney
side, but there is no easy route for those who would conquer it
from the south. One year a party from the Melbourne Walking Club
did the trip by way of Corryong, returning via Bunroy; the
following Christmas saw another party from the Club start out with
much the same objective. The trip lasted from the afternoon of
Saturday, December 24, to the night of Wednesday, January 4. In
all, 125 miles were walked.</p>

<p class="cpb">A Tumbling Torrent.</p>

<p>Train was taken to Tallangatta, and Cunningham Bros. motored the
party first to Corryong, where the stores were picked up, and then
to Bringenbrong Bridge, on the border, where the Murray River is
formed by the junction of the Swampy Plains River and the Indi.
Here seven local boys joined the camp, so the cavalcade which set
out next morning (Monday, December 26) was a large one, consisting
of thirteen horses (five of them with packs), and eighteen men and
boys. Mr. Charles M. Findlay, of Corryong, had charge of the
horses, and acted as guide, and no more capable or obliging guide
could be desired.</p>

<p>The rich flats of Bringenbrong and Khancoban took all the
morning to cross, then a bush pad was followed up long slopes to
the top of a sheer ridge known as the Gehi Wall, down the far side
of which it fell 825 feet in 350 yards. A tumbling, rushing
torrent, the Gehi River, had then to be crossed four times, the
horses having to be used for the purpose. Camp on the Gehi was
pitched almost on top of a five foot black snake. Rain fell, but
did no harm. Eighteen miles for the day. Magnificent views of
Kosciusko closed the outlook next morning as the track was taken up
the Gehi. Scrubby Creek (seven miles), reached through a tunnel of
Christmas bush in flower, made a delightful lunching place, and Tom
Groggin's Crossing, on the Murray, supplied the night's camp.
Sixteen miles for the day. Groggin's is the spot where Riley, "the
man from Snowy River," of Banjo Paterson's poem, lived and died. A
grove of Kentish cherry trees, laden with fruit, proved very
inviting, and the well-grassed river flat provided such a
comfortable resting place that no move was made on the Wednesday
till after lunch.</p>

<p class="cpb">Strenuous Afternoon.</p>

<p>There were only seven miles to go to Leatherbarrel Creek, where
the night was spent, but they were all uphill until the creek was
reached, and it proved a strenuous afternoon. To reach the
Leatherbarrel water there is a very steep drop from the ridge of
some hundreds of feet. Looking up from the camp fireside at the
high walls of the hills rising on every side, it seemed that there
could be no way out. It proved a very comfortable, secluded camp,
but the pull-out next day (Thursday) was a test of both wind and
limb. Up and up went the track, rising by way of the Monaro Gap
(6000 feet) some 4000 feet in nine miles. With the crest well in
sight, lunch was had just above Lake Cootapatamba. By 3 o'clock all
were assembled at the cairn and enjoying the wonderful prospect of
high hills and deep valleys (both of Victoria and New South Wales),
which lay clearly defined in the bright sunshine. Alongside the
cairn is the site of the hut once occupied by Mr. Wragge, the
meteorologist, but a fire had destroyea the building utterly.
Winding round the snow-splashed hillsides came the road from the
Hotel Kosciusko, some 17 miles away, and the party saw the first
motor of the season shovel a way through the snow and reach the
summit. Being well above the timber line, the party had to retreat
to a sheltered valley, some two miles away, where wood could be had
for the camp fire. There a pleasant night was spent. Eleven miles
for the day.</p>

<p class="cpb">Summit Again Scaled.</p>

<p>At 8.30 next morning (Friday) the summit was again scaled, and
some of the more adventurous moved on to Mt. Townsend, a still
bolder peak and much more difficult on account of its final rocky
outcrop. Then the Blue Lake (seven miles from Kosciusko) was sought
in an all-enveloping fog, which kindly lifted to give views of the
most beautiful sheet cf water any of the party had ever seen. It is
40 acres in extent, is 75 feet deep, and is set in a basin of sheer
cliffs, draped in snow, from which come shouting waterfalls. It is
6150 feet above sea level. Lunch was had on its margin. In leaving,
the Crummer Range was climbed and, steering by compass, a course
was laid along huge ridges and by sidings over tremendous valleys
to find Dicky Cooper's camp. Night came on, the clouds lowered,
rain fell, and at last camp had to be pitched and the elements
fought till morning. The experience may best be summed up in the
title given to that spot&mdash;"Camp Misery." Twenty-one miles for
the day.</p>

<p class="cpb">Where New Year's Eve Was Spent.</p>

<p>No one was any the worse on Saturday. The sun came out, and,
after much beawasul scenery Dicky Cooper's was reached in time for
lunch (six miles). Ahead was the New South Wales Mount Bogong, and
in a windy hollow known as the Bogong Plain the party put in the
last night of 1921. Thirteen miles for the day. On January 1 Pretty
Plain was crossed, and many fine streams (the most notable
characteristic of the whole of this country was the water supply)
were waded, the Toolong Range was topped, revealing distant
glimpses of the Murray, and a sharp descent brought the party to
Khancoban Creek, at one of the fords of which the night was spent.
Fourteen miles. Monday brought civilisation into the picture again,
and at the end of a comfortable walk of 12 miles the old camp at
Bringenbrong Bridge was again occupied. By motor next day the
railhead at Cudgewa was reached, and Wednesday, January 4, was
devoted to travelling back to the city by train.</p>

<p>One word of warning: <b>Take a guide.</b> The track from Tom
Groggin's to Leatherbarrel Creek is very difficult to find.</p>

<h3><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>BOGONG THE MIGHTY: A RHAPSODY</h3>

<p class="pin30">"...Lifts blue in air,<br>
As though man's passionate mind had never suffered there."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Masefield.</p>

<p>He is the great and wise one, solitary and remote, sitting
serenely above the clouds, unmoved by the screaming winds of the
high places as by dogma or creed, or the other vain breaths of man.
A symbol of the hopes and fears of humanity, his roots explore the
darkness of the nether world; about his knees are the habitable
slopes clothed in gracious vegetation, and giving birth to the
living waters; his crest is with the stars. Endlessly he broods
upon matter and spirit&mdash;protean matter, that is yet
indestructible, the spirit that informs alike the atom and the
angel. Most of all does he consider the ultimate purpose of the God
of whom all things are but manifestations.</p>

<p>From his height he looks across the mountain billows, rolling
wave upon wave, to where Kosciusko, greatest of all, has
established his place. He watches the unceasing procession of the
seasons as they colour the valleys, strive with the barren ridges,
and pass away over the heights, ever moving from the warm north,
mother of all, to lose themselves in the eternal winters of the
south.</p>

<p>Spring has danced down the waterways, and decorated the plains
with the finest of her favours; she has poured the "wattle river"
full spate along the courses of the Murray, and the Goulburn, and
the Yarra; and it is flowing even in distant Tasmania long before
she dare put a timid hand upon Bogong's snow-crowned head. Slowly
she has mounted the steep slopes, winning her way with soft rains
and bursts of quickening sun. She has lingered where the forests
are, and, as she passes, the streams roar louder behind their banks
of fern and hazel, flowers unfold, the gum-tips take a lovelier
iris, the birds mate and sing. Tangled undergrowth at the foot of
tall, clean-stemmed eucalypts gives place to the rarer shrubs that
love the shelter of the woolly-butts; they in turn are left behind,
and through a vista of the smooth, mottled-green trunks of the
alpine gums appear the ultimate heights. At her smile, the snows
run sparkling in joyous cascades, and the brown earth shows again,
save where a sheltered hollow guards jealously a lapful of
white.</p>

<p>With alternate shower and shine, the spring goes on her gusty
way, and summer lazily woos the land. To win her favour, the
snow-grass puts forth a tender green from the dead remnants of its
last year's abundance, dwarf prostantheras and a few hardy plants
stretch themselves doubtfully to the stature permitted by the
tyrant winds, and all hasten to have done with the perilous
business of flowering and perpetuating their species. Giant
daisies&mdash;white and pink and heliotrope&mdash;and buttercups of
the yellowest shine, like many-coloured stars in an inverted heaven
of emerald. Overhead floats the eagle on unfaltering wings; from
the edge of the girdle of snow-gum rise the grating call of the
gang-gang and the note of the flame-breasted robin; a ground-lark
runs and halts, runs and halts, in the open spaces; and, on the
skyline, there is a constant traffic and calling of crows.</p>

<p>But even hot-hearted summer holds no absolute sovereignty here.
Her fires may come on the wings of the northerly, and strip the
snow-gum of its sparse foliage, leaving the toughened branches to
weather to the dazzling whiteness of a sun-bleached bone; the emu
feasting on the cranberries, the wallaby crashing through the
scrub, the lyre-bird whistling in the gullies, may fall victim to
the smoke and fury; but night on the summit is ever the pledge that
winter will return. Even at its stillest, a wandering breath of
thin air creeps stealthily along the ground, so slight as scarcely
to merit the name of movement, so keen and insidious that nothing
excludes its searching fingers.</p>

<p>The mountain is coming to his own again with autumn in the land.
The sterner seasons are his; he welcomes the frost and the snow,
the gale and the tempest, and they may stay with him through much
of the changing year. When the lowlands begin to send up the smokes
of autumn, and, along the windings of the Kiewa and the Mitta and
their numberless feeding streams, all of them children of the
heights, rise soft vapours morning and evening; when the days are
still, and a mellowness as of a universal ripening is over the
land; then does the winter rime gather on Bogong's huge crown, to
defy the sun more stoutly each shortening day. The plants have
ripened and cast their seed; the birds seek safe coverts in the
lowest gullies; the giant worms, the great and incredibly active
spiders, and all that lesser life that hunted in the jungles of the
snow-grass now bury themselves, each after his kind; the million
millions of the Bogong moth, noiseless messengers sent forth each
summer night to flicker ghost-like through space, and collect the
news of other worlds&mdash;that wonderful multitude vanishes, for a
time at least, as surely as have vanished the native tribes so long
wont to gather to the delicious feast of singed wings and crushed
brown bodies.</p>

<p>Up the toilsome gradients of the three great buttresses that
alone give approach to the summit come a few horsemen, no more than
inch-high in the scale, to gather the handful of cattle that feed
here for the brief period of the warm days. From the highest point,
they look down and along an undulating plain that stretches
north-easterly for a mile, and easterly and southerly for some four
miles in a gradual curve, and on every side falls sharply away into
profound abysses, for they stand on the crest of Victoria, and
Bogong, in his majesty, brooks no intimate neighbours. He throws
out no ridge of welcome to other peaks; the never-resting waters,
at once his creator and his offspring, have cut deep the ravines
that compass him about, and their streams foam unceasingly between
him and the nearest ranges. Closely the horsemen watch for the
menace of cloud and wind, and soon they, too, withdraw, and the
dreamer is left to his stars.</p>

<p>Still is autumn the lord of all the lower lands; still does he
bask in the noontide warmth of sunny days which have slowly emerged
from misty dawns, and which will end in crisp and wholesome nights;
still do the apples shine like lanterns on the trees when winter
strides with certain foot to his ancient throne on the pinnacles.
Frost first; then, in the sigh of gathering winds, masses of cloud
veil the majestic face of the mountain, and envelop him in a
mystery from which he reappears, "clothed in white samite,"
transformed and wonderful.</p>

<p>The drenching storms that blot out the valleys and flood the
waterways but add to his covering of purity. The gales of winter
come shouting from their caves, and roar with the thunder as it
rolls from peak to lofty peak. Monstrous winds flap their violent
wings across the high places, and smaller vagrant airs, their
venturesome spawn, riot down the steep inclines, and lose their
way, and die sobbing in the tangles of the gullies. Deeper and
deeper grows the snow, and the brooding monarch is well content. In
the night-watches, his mighty brother Feathertop, keeping guard to
the south, speaks to him with the voice of silence that is as "The
hawk's wide circle in the blue&mdash;the very ghost of sound!" and
Fainter, hardly less great, and Baldy and Hotham, and Cope, and
Cobbler the Hunchback, and Howitt, and Kent, and the distant
Buffalo lean to hear the wisdom of the ancients, or thrill to the
marching song of the spheres, age-old when the morning stars sang
together for joy at the creation.</p>

<p>In his mantle of ermine, the Bogong is king and judge. "Brother,
what of man, the builder and destroyer, by whose might the rocks
are blasted, and the forests made desolate, who kills and spares
not, who digs his pits in our groaning sides, whose roads scar the
heights, whose self-applauding monuments disfigure the land, who
claims sole kinship with the great Author of all?" And the deep
voice answers: "So many forms of life...and but one life! Man
builds but as the bird, his burrowings are the wombat's, his
killings those of the dingo, the roads he cuts are but as the paths
of the ants, he clears the forest as the lyre-bird scratches clean
a dancing space, his towers and pyramids endure no more than the
mounds of the termites, his soul is a fragment of the universal
soul that lives in the stones and the grass and all created things.
He passes, even as they pass, even as we in turn shall pass."</p>

<p>Vast as the clouded landscape of a dream, aloof and inscrutable
as the mind of a god, Bogong to-day lifts his ice-crowned head in
unapproachable grandeur. But the spring shall come again and the
snowdrifts race to the ocean, and, on that awe-inspiring height,
the pipit, humblest of birds, shall run and halt, run and halt, and
make herself a nesting place.</p>

<h2><a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>SOME MAPS AND PLANS</h2>

<p class="pin20">I am told there are people who do not care for
maps, and I find it hard to believe.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p>Consciously or unconsciously, the walker is ever a map-maker.
When first he hears of new country, probably long before he sets
out to visit it, he pictures it in his mind with its mountains, its
rivers, and its sea coast. And later, when reality has painted out
the original vision, and he is back again at his ordinary vocation,
his clay dreams are largely engaged with the reconstruction, piece
by piece, of the actual landscape. It is at such a time that he
thinks in terms of the ancient jingle:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">If I could be where I would be,<br>
Then would I be where I am not,</p>

<p>and he goes home to pull out one or other of his old maps and
ponder over the details of the land which he feels he owns because
he has tramped across it. Then, when he has feasted full of
reminiscence, he turns to the still unconquered spaces, and the
process begins all over again.</p>

<p class="cpb">An Ancient Art.</p>

<p>Map-making was an early practice of mankind. Egypt tried its
prentice hand some 1300 years before the birth of Christ, and the
ancient Chinese were also more or less expert cartographers. The
Greeks and others made creditable attempts in this direction at a
very early period. Anaximander (600 B.C.) is credited with having
designed the first map of the world.</p>

<p>Some maps, produced when Europe knew little of this round Earth,
are very quaint records of the state of learning and the popular
beliefs of the day. It was the custom to fill up the blanks with
representations of the natural, and unnatural, features which
imagination suggested should be there. Swift said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">Geographers, in Afric maps,<br>
With savage pictures fill their gaps,<br>
And o'er unhabitable downs<br>
Place elephants for want of towns.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the extension of knowledge has robbed the
map of some of its charm. No longer may we expect to meet "the
Anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders."
But we have gained something in that we can actually find our way
by modern maps and plans. Cook's charts of the eastern portion of
the Australian coast line are said to be remarkably accurate, and
since his day the gaps have been filled.</p>

<p class="cpb">Locality Plans.</p>

<p>When you are travelling in the back country, and desire a
direction, it is a million to a gooseberry that the information, if
it cannot be simply given, will take the form of a plan. I have
many recollections of stooping with a serious-faced bushman while
he traced such a plan on the ground with a stick. That is the kind
of map which is about as easy to take along with you as a
Babylonian romance written on bricks. The safest way is to copy it
on paper; then you will have no difficulty. Word of mouth
directions to carry you over a distance are prone to error either
in statement or in memory, even if they are not as delightfully
vague as Stevenson's instructions to J. M. Barrie, when the latter
was invited to come from Scotland to Samoa: "You take the boat to
San Francisco, and then my place is the second to the left."</p>

<p>It is a very small thing indeed at times which mars the full
usefulness of a map. "The little more, and how much it is; the
little less, and what worlds away." That really excellent series
issued by our local Tourist Bureau suffers badly from the omission
of a scale. Certainly each map bears an inscription: "One mile to
an inch," "Two miles to an inch," or whatever it may be; but there
is nothing on it by which you can measure an inch. Every map should
be self-contained in this matter. You should not have to carry a
foot-rule as part of your travelling equipment. With a printed
line, marked in inches, the difficulty vanishes: a stick, a piece
of string, a scrap of paper&mdash;anything at all, will give you
your distances. In this connection it may be of interest to note
that a half-penny is exactly an inch across.</p>

<p class="cpb">Useful Details.</p>

<p>We are well supplied in Victoria with useful maps, and if the
Defence Department persists with the military survey of Australia
the whole of our continent will one day be set out in almost
microscopic detail. Already portions of Sydney and Adelaide have
been dealt with, while this State is represented so far by nine
maps. They are remarkable publications for two reasons&mdash;the
amount of information they display and the fact that in these days
of high prices they can be had for 1/- each. They omit nothing. No
walkers through the localities they deal with can afford to be
without them.</p>

<p>The first thing probably to strike the pedestrian who has done
much back-country travelling is that all water is marked, whether
it be a creek, a swamp, a marsh or merely a water-hole, while the
ever-running creek is distinguished from the non-perennial. Roads
and railway lines one expects to find figured, and not only are
they there, but each bridge, culvert, crossing, embankment and
telegraph line is shown, and it is made clear whether a road is
metalled, formed without metal, or unformed. Tracks appear, and so
do telephone routes, with P.O. to mark each post office and a T. to
notify the traveller where a telegram may be sent from. The very
sign-posts are indicated, and so are all the schools, hotels,
blacksmith shops, churches, mills, factories, windmills,
cemeteries, and even the dwelling houses, except in very much
congested areas. Timber has its own peculiar symbol, and so has
scrub, while a triangle and a set of figures are used for each
trig. station and its altitude. Not the least valuable and
interesting of the many fine features are the contour lines. At
first blush these appear confusing, but five minutes' study will
reveal an orderly scheme of a very helpful kind. They record the
general outline of the group of hills, and each inner circle
proclaims a rise of 50 feet until the summit is reached. Where the
lines are close together the hillside is at its steepest, where
they widen out, the slope is gradual.</p>

<p>I have said that nine military survey maps have so far been
published relating to Victoria. The week-end walker who resides
anywhere near Melbourne should get the Ringwood map to begin with.
Its western, edge is a line running through Northcote, Burnley,
Prahran, Caulfield and the Bay beyond Beaumaris; easterly it
extends to Seville, Macclesfield and Cockatoo; on the north it
includes Heidelberg, Templestowe, Lilydale and Killara; and down
south it takes in Mentone, Dandenong, Harkaway and the hill country
about Beaconsfield. The other eight maps connect up with this one.
They are known as Cranbourne, Western Port and Woolamai, Sorrento,
Portarlington, Geelong, Anglesea, Corangamite, and Ballan, the
last-named embracing the famous Werribee Gorge.</p>

<p>(Most regretfully must I announce that the Defence Department
has now withdrawn these useful maps from sale.)</p>

<p class="cpb">Out Back.</p>

<p>Broadbent's road maps are reliable and kept as much up to date
as such printed records can be. For it must be borne in mind that
the country is always changing. New roads are opened, and old ones
are obliterated by Nature, who is ever busy at that kind of work.
Houses of accommodation close, as on the Bright-Omeo track, where
Rundell's and Cobungra both ceased for a time, though again open,
and whole townships vanish with the disappearance of the gold which
supported them. No outback journey on foot should be undertaken, if
it involves departure from the beaten way, until all available
information is obtained. The county plans of the Lands Department
are sometimes of great use in extended tours, and there is at least
one production of the Mines Department which should not be
overlooked. It is a map of the eastern portion of Victoria showing
the mining tracks cut by the Department. Apart from its utility, it
is full of romance. The red lines climb the wild hills or wind
along their wooded sides, dipping to cross a river with never a
bridge in a hundred miles, or ascending to where the sole guide is
a line of snowpoles on the upland plains. These tracks present the
only routes through some of the back country, and many of them are
kept open by the passage of cattle and stockmen. Others again are
overgrown, their usefulness having departed. No one should commit
himself to any of them without preliminary inquiry.</p>

<p>Maps serve a pleasant purpose on the high peaks. Find the north
with your compass, and you may identify every mountain and river in
sight. From the top of Mount Cope on the Bogong High Plains, or
Bogong itself, or Cobbler the Hunchback, or Fainter, or Feathertop,
or any of our Alpine giants, all of them yielding wide outlooks,
the interest of the view is added to enormously when each natural
feature can with certainty be named. Then you may, as Pope put it
of quite another matter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">Expatiate free o'er all this scene of man;<br>
A mighty maze! but not without a plan.</p>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>EQUIPMENT AND OBJECTIVES</h2>

<p>Walking is the most natural of all exercises, yet it is one of
the hardest of sports in which to become really proficient. A
champion of champions told me once that it took him five years of
solid training to get into the first flight, and the strain was
cruel in the beginning. But his reward has been great. It is years
since he was last on the track, and he knows more about motors now
than walking shoes, but he still has an upright carriage and a
springy step, earned in those strenuous days, which compel
admiration. His strings of medals and his record certificates count
for little compared with the greater prize, health and strength,
which he won at the game. Why proficiency is so difficult to attain
is largely because the gait which carries a man over a mile in
anything under seven minutes is not the gait in general use, but a
highly specialised action directed solely at speed. So it demands
special training. No one who has tackled this systematically will
forget the peculiar and agonising ache that grips him along the
shinbone and will not let go until he stops. Milton is responsible
for the statement that Satan found Hell bearable after a
while&mdash;"his torments became his elements"; so let the tyro at
walking console himself with the thought that if he sticks to it
long enough he will be quite at home on the track. In time he will
not only conquer the shin-ache, but he will pluck out the heart of
those mysteries&mdash;the way to swing the arms so that they become
an important aid to pace, the trick of overcoming the natural
tendency to lean forward when hurrying, and, most important of all,
how to pick up each foot with lightning speed yet never have both
feet off the ground at once.</p>

<p class="cpb">An Electric Tell-tale.</p>

<p>Constant contact with the track is the essence of the walking
laws of the Amateur Athletic Union of Australasia. But the human
eye is not quick enough to record definitely whether a pair of feet
which are taking over 100 strides a minute are hitting the ground
correctly every time, so judging is necessarily anything but an
exact science. Mr. A. O. Barrett, formerly Australasian champion
and record-holder, worked long at a tell-tale to be carried by the
walker, but it was never perfected. The appliance contained an
electric battery which was to ring a bell whenever the bearer lost
contact with the earth. A good principle, undoubtedly, and it may
some day be practically applied. It would place speed walking among
the competitions which any official may judge.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Knapsack Way.</p>

<p>Youth makes the pace, and, later, wonders how he did it. It is
about then that he dons the knapsack and takes to "the old road,
the bold road, the road that leads from town." He has been sampling
this saner recreation from time to time between racing and
training. Now he definitely commits himself to it, never afterwards
to look back. He buys a knapsack; and even in these days of
impossible prices a handy one may be got for 12/6. The shape varies
from a square bag, opening with a buckled flap and carried straight
across the shoulders, to a deeper sack, which settles well along
the line of the backbone. This form usually closes with a cord run
through eyelets. Straps to go over both shoulders are common to all
the types. This is a comfortable way of carrying the necessaries
for a road trip. It leaves the hands free to hold stick or billy,
and it is capable of containing all that may be required on any
outing, whether of one day or ten, on which sleeping accommodation
is available each night. Possibly the waterproof cape will not go
in; it can be strapped outside. For a week-end tour&mdash;say, the
walk from Healesville to Toolangi on a Saturday afternoon,
returning Sunday&mdash;the equipment varies in degree, but not in
kind, from what must be taken on such a tramp as Mansfield to
Walhalla, which occupies eight days. On both of these it is
possible to sleep indoors.</p>

<p>Assume that you are off for a week-end. A typical equipment
would be:&mdash;Stout boots, comfortable socks, oldish clothes, a
soft shirt with soft collar, a hat with a reasonable brim, and a
fly veil. Leggings or putties should be worn&mdash;the only
disadvantage of the latter being their tendency to pick up grass
seeds&mdash;and in the knapsack should be at least one change of
socks, some handkerchiefs, another soft collar, pyjamas, small
towel, soap, toothbrush, hairbrush, and shaving tackle. Don't
forget a snake-bite outfit, some string, a knife and matches (above
all, matches). The lot can go in your pockets. Strap a waterproof
cape to the pack if the weather justifies it, and take along a
little billy, with some tea, sugar, a pannikin, a spoon, and a
sandwich in it if you want al fresco refreshment. A comforting
addition to the load, if you can get it in, is a pair of light
slippers for evening use. For the longer knapsack walk, multiply
the number of handkerchiefs, collars and socks to suit. I have
named the bare essentials; there are many more things which cry out
to be taken. Space is the dictator. It is a full knapsack that will
not hold a book of some kind.</p>

<p class="cpb">Sleeping Out.</p>

<p>There is only one way of getting off the beaten track&mdash;take
a swag. Victoria is full of possibilities for the walker willing to
"waltz Matilda." The western coast line is specially seductive, and
the far east must not be thought lacking in attraction because of
its long stretches of sand. Inland our Alpine system calls
constantly, offering endless variety, even to snowdrifts in summer,
and there is an abundance of tours handy to Melbourne which amply
justify the use of the swag. Only one objection can be seriously
urged against "Matilda"; she has to be carried. To lift to one's
shoulder a load of from fifteen to thirty pounds and walk with it
all day long is a proposition that has made many a would-be swaggie
pause. It is really the price of liberty, and a small price, too,
for such "a glorious feast." Up to the limit of your capacity to
carry bed and food, say, for three days, you may revert to the
primitive and know a world that Nature can still claim as her own.
I say three days, because, on a long trip, that means a swag of
thirty pounds (twenty pounds of bed and clothing and ten pounds of
tucker), and experience has proved that to be quite sufficient
weight to shoulder. More means real discomfort. At the end of the
three days you should be in a place where supplies can be
renewed&mdash;itself probably lonely enough&mdash;and the process
is repeated.</p>

<p>What makes the best swag? Emphatically the sleeping bag. It is a
canvas sack, lined with light blanketing, and should weigh not more
than six or seven pounds. From the feet to the waist it is
completely closed, a flap with buttons opens from the waist to the
neck, and a hood, supported on springy wires, protects the head,
yet leaves the face open to the air. The hood can be pulled right
over the face if necessary. It is no spring mattress, and the
ground is pretty hard to lie on with only one thickness of blanket
between, so the novice may be grateful for the following hints:
Keep your head high, for that eases your shoulder from the earth (a
stone or log padded with some spare clothing makes a good pillow);
dig a hole for your hip; wherever possible make a bed of bracken or
leaves. Another point: don't sleep under a tree with dead limbs on
it.</p>

<p class="cpb">The Vanishing Swaggie.</p>

<p>Is the swagman disappearing? Occasionally he is seen in the
suburbs, but on well over a thousand miles of back country roads I
have only encountered one in recent years. The swag is best carried
in the fashion of the profession. Make up in a neat roll about
three feet long (rather less than more), strap it round the middle
and at each extremity, and carry it by slipping your right arm
through a piece of girthing which is secured to the two end straps.
Bring the loose end of the top strap over your left shoulder, and
buckle it on to a "nose-bag," in which you will carry your food.
There you have an outfit which will not slip off, which leaves both
hands free, and which can be carried with the minimum of
effort.</p>

<p>Useful adjuncts are an "American leather" bag, say, 2 feet 6
inches by 18 inches, which is easily made, and can be used at night
for one's spare clothes and as a pillow; and a waterproof sheet,
about 7 feet by 5 feet, to go on the ground and completely cover
the sleeping bag in wet weather. It may alternatively be rigged up
as a tent. It must be light.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a name="image-8" id=
"image-8"></a><img alt="" src="1402821h-images/openroad-8.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">Packhorses&mdash;loading Up</p>

<p>Get the requisite amount of balloon silk (so called because it
has nothing to do with a balloon and it is not silk) from a
tent-maker, and purchase half a pound of paraffin wax at an
ironmonger's; fold the sheet a couple of times, slice the wax on to
the sheet, and work it in with a hot flat-iron. This will make the
sheet waterproof. Cut a hole in the centre just big enough to let
your head through, have some press-studs sewn on, and your ground
sheet is also a poncho, which will cover you and your swag as you
walk. A small, one-man tent, light and easy to carry, is now
popular with the Melbourne Walking Club. It is familiarly known as
a "pup." It can be highly recommended.</p>

<p class="cpb">Equine Assistance.</p>

<p>It is only when the way is long and there is no chance of
refilling the nose-bags for some days, that the pack-horse need be
hired. He can be an uncomfortable beast if he likes or until you
get to know his mannerisms. He will tread on your heels as you lead
him, or rub you against a hillside or a tree when you forget you've
got him in tow and pause to admire the view. I recall, too, a bare
mountain top, falling away to deep gullies, and, in between, the
air full of swags and billies, as a bolting pack-horse kicked his
heels for the far horizon. But mostly he is a good sort, whose only
vice is a desire to assure you at night that he is still with you.
He does this by ringing his neck-bell it your ear as he browses. He
is a great convenience, and he will go up practically any track you
can follow yourself, steering skilfully round rocks and trees and
stepping over logs as delicately as Agag. It is in mountainous
country that he is most serviceable. See that he gets a drink, and,
as a rule, he will attend to his tucker for himself.</p>

<p class="cpb">Mind Your Feet.</p>

<p>A walker's Achilles' heel is his whole foot. Hurt him there and
he is done. He cannot pay too much attention to his feet and what
covers them. For all touring solid, stout-soled boots are strongly
advised. They save the feet from bruising on a rough track and from
scorching on a hot, dusty road. The additional weight is very
little, and a few days in the garden with them will accustom one to
it. For long bush walks, especially those involving mountain
climbing, I find it good to buy a pair of military boots (they cost
from fifteen shillings to a guinea) and break them in by occasional
use. Before the original sole is broken, the bootmaker puts on a
clump sole and adorns it with about a dozen headless nails which
project slightly. A rubber heel is also useful. After polishing,
the boots are treated thoroughly with dubbin, sole and upper, and
particularly where the two join. Socks are next in importance.
Personally I get the best results from those known as lamb's wool.
They are soft and fairly thick. But no general law can be laid down
in this matter. As a runner will discard socks altogether, even in
cross-country work, while another must have his feet comfortably
padded, so walkers vary in their preferences. Some like thick socks
and some thin. Whichever you may adopt, see that you are supplied
with changes enough, for a change of socks is both restful on the
journey and a valuable safeguard of health when you step into the
train for the homeward trip.</p>

<p>Much has been written about chafing and blisters and their
prevention and cure. Soaping the socks is advocated by some, the
use of various powders by others. Soaping is undoubtedly a relief,
and some of the powders are soothing, but their effect is temporary
at the best and the blisters come in the end. Most effective is a
good rubber sticking plaster, tins of which, an inch wide, may be
had for nine-pence. As soon as a chafe is felt, put on a piece of
the plaster and it will take the friction and save the foot. If the
blister has formed, prick it and cover well with plaster, and you
will have little more trouble.</p>

<p class="cpb">Equipment and Food.</p>

<p>The golden rule of the walker in regard to equipment is that
which Mark Twain applied to the adjective: When in doubt, leave
out!</p>

<p>It is surprising the number of things you do not need. Every
ounce counts when you have to carry it, and there are limits, even
to the capacity of a pack-horse. The requirements of a short trip
have been particularised. These items embrace the actual essentials
for an out-back excursion: Sleeping bag (or blanket and rug) and
its straps and girthing, waterproof sheeting, American-leather bag
(optional, but advised), changes of socks, handkerchiefs and light
underclothing, woollen sweater, spare shirt (remember, washing can
be done en route), a towel and soap, shaving kit, shoes (optional),
knife, fork, spoon, mug, tin plate, tin-opener-cum-corkscrew,
candle, matches, string, needle and thread, comb or brush,
tooth-brush, fly-veil, mosquito net, leggings, a few fish-hooks and
a line, a snakebite outfit, a small flask of brandy, a bandage, a
locality map, and what an old-time physician, who was also a
walker, called peristaltic persuaders, e.g., Epsom salts. A small
axe could be carried, but is generally not worth the trouble. For
cooking purposes place your faith in the billies, of which there
should be at least three, fitting into each other. A bit of fencing
wire makes a good grid; use the clean coals if no wire is
handy.</p>

<p>The military ration of food is 3 lbs. per man per day, made up
of bread 1 lb., biscuits 4 ozs., fresh meat 1 lb., butter 4 oz.,
jam 2 oz., sugar 2 oz., tea 2 oz., coffee 2 oz., pepper one-eighth
of an ounce, salt one-sixteenth of an ounce. Variations suggested
by walking experience are 1½ lbs. of bread, 3 ozs. of rice in place
of the biscuits, the reduction of the quantity of meat to ¾lb., and
the substitution of oatmeal or some other farinaceous food, an
increase of one ounce on the sugar allowance and a cutting down of
the amount of tea&mdash;one ounce will make enough tea for half a
dozen men. Bacon or ham (cut into thin rashers), dried fruits and
dried or condensed milk could be included with advantage. Cheese,
German sausage and tinned stuff, both meat and fish, carry well.
With a pack-horse the list can be enlarged to include potatoes,
onions, flour and baking powder, curry powder, soup powders and
other tasty things.</p>

<p class="cpb">What Profits It?</p>

<p>The return is health and strength and a gallery of mental
pictures painted by the greatest of all artists. A trip is not done
with when it is over. The whole system is toned, the body is
stronger, the mind enriched. Every day brings its diversion, and at
night there is the camp fire and the quiet stars. You smoke your
pipe,</p>

<p>"And it's then good-night and to bed, and if heels or heart
ache, Well, it's sound sleep and long sleep..."</p>

<p>&mdash;but not too deep to wake.</p>

<h2><a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>VALE!</h2>

<p>In a final word let me emphasise what has been implied
throughout the whole of this series of articles&mdash;that there is
no need to go out of Victoria, or, indeed, far from Melbourne, for
natural beauty of a high order. We are citizens of no mean city,
yet within its suburban radius, as defined by the railway guide,
there is bush into which you may plunge and lose all sense of a
near-by civilisation, so virgin does it seem; creeks as limpid as
when new-created, their banks clothed with ferns and native shrubs;
mountains on whose sides stand giant gums which saw, still as huge
trees, the coming of the white man, and whose gullies ring with the
voice of that marvellous mimic, the lyre-bird. And further afield,
for the more adventurous, are our Alpine peaks, yielding the
novelty of summer snow and revealing a wonderland of high plains to
the climber who gains their tops. Or, should "the long wash of
Australasian seas" have more attraction, there is an unending
variety of beach to choose from. No one who has walked the heathy
summit of Moonlight Head, or come by way of Apollo Bay and Lorne
from Cape Otway to Airey's Inlet, is likely to forget the creeks
and headlands of that beautiful countryside. And even the long and
arid stretches of sand, broken by bar-bound rivers, their waters
salt as the sea, that reaches from Cape Everard to Cunninghame and
beyond, draws again the walker who has once known its strange
fascination. Truly, it may be said of our country, to quote the
words of a well-known enthusiast, "It is all good when you're out
in it!"</p>
