  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">THE sun was gone below the hot horizon, but its light still
  lingered, a curious red glow that lay heavily in the long canyon of Fourth
  Avenue and combined with a strange, breath-bated hush to make the July dusk
  somehow ominous.</p>

  <p>Midway in one crimson-tinged block, Ford Duane stroked the back of a
  tattered volume with long, sensitive fingers. Tall and gaunt&mdash;studiously
  stooped over the bargain trays outside his dingy bookshop&mdash;his ascetic
  features veiled by their habitual drowsy calm, his eyelids sleepily
  half-closed, Duane appeared utterly withdrawn from the turmoil of a workaday
  world, utterly at peace. At peace? <i>For this man death was a constant,
  grisly companion, the fear of death was in his every breath!</i></p>

  <p>From far up the deserted, somnolent street, a raucous call
  sounded&mdash;unintelligible yet filled with an odd, disquieting excitement.
  Duane half-turned to the cry. To a watcher, if watcher there had been, the movement was
  indolent, meaningless. But at the corners of his thin nostrils, white spots
  showed, deepened. Hidden behind his slitted eyelids, tiny lights crawled like
  minuscule worms.</p>

  <p>The lonely figure of a white-shirted newsboy, hurrying toward Duane down
  the darkening, empty vista, took on a fantastic, unreal aspect. His hoarse
  call seemed pregnant with dreadful meaning. <i>"Papers! Final papers!"</i>
  The bookseller's skin tightened and a grisly, unacknowledged dread prickled
  his spine.</p>

  <p>The urchin reached him, twisted to him and stood spraddle-legged in front
  of him.</p>

  <p>"Paper? Any these?"</p>

  <p>Momentarily, Ford Duane stared uncomprehendingly at the youth who was
  thrusting a folded sheet fairly into his face. "Post and Telegram. Which one,
  mister?" Then understanding exploded suddenly in the man's brain. Carelessly,
  almost mechanically, he took the proffered newspaper and fumblingly paid for
  it. But behind his drowsy mask, his every nerve&mdash;every brain
  cell&mdash;was suddenly quiveringly alive.</p>

  <p>"Final papers. Joinal! Telegram!" The youngster's shouts faded into the
  lamplit darkness. Duane stuffed his purchase into a sagging side-pocket of
  his gray alpaca coat, started on the nightly routine of dragging the bargain
  boxes within the pamphlet-hung door of his store. <i>"P</i>aper." The boy had
  said. <i>"A</i>ny <i>t</i>hese?" And then, <i>"P</i>ost <i>a</i>nd
  <i>T</i>elegram." It was no accident that the phrases had been so oddly
  twisted, no accident <i>that the initial letters of the first three words had
  been identical.</i> P! A! T!</p><br>

  <p class="first">P.A.T. In many and various forms, those three letters had
  come to Duane; in a huckster's shout, in an old man's quavering offer of an
  ancient folio, in a beggar's plea. Each time, inevitably, men had died in the
  night. Now again, the mysterious signal had come, and muscles bunched along
  the gaunt jaw of the dealer in dusty antique books, and in very blue eyes
  veiled by drowsy lids an eager light glowed.</p>

  <p>Ford Duane locked the store door from within, wheeled to face the dim,
  mysterious gloom of the crowded bookstacks inside. His gaze warily probed the
  black pools of shadow between them, through which he slowly waded. He was
  like a taut wire, vibrant for any hint of danger. Even here, even in his own
  small store&mdash;<i>above all in his own store</i>&mdash;he must be
  infinitely on the alert.</p>

  <p>At the rear of the shop, grime-encrusted curtains rustled, parted and
  swung shut. Duane's hand found a familiar switch. It clicked and yellow light
  spilled from a pendant bulb to edge with harshness a touseled iron cot, a
  bare wooden table, a rickety chair. A steel shutter was tightly clamped over
  the single window, held there by a bar queerly too new, too thick for the
  stock of old books it ostensibly guarded...</p><br>

  <p class="first">DUANE jerked the newly-bought newspaper from his pocket,
  spread it on the table. Standing, he thumbed through page after page of the
  voluminous sheet. His feverish glance scanned each broadside, rejected it.
  Then, suddenly, breath hissed sharply from between his clenched teeth and the
  furious search was at an end.</p>

  <p>It was an advertisement at which the bookseller stared! Crudely drawn, a
  tailor squatted crosslegged on a ship's bridge and sewed a patch on a limp
  pair of trousers. And beneath was the caption, black against wiggly waves on
  which the pictured craft rode:</p>

  <p><i>P</i>INCUS: <i>A</i>BLE <i>T</i>AILOR</p>

  <p>Once more the fateful initials P-A-T! Once more! But below them was a
  hodge-podge of selling talk, a conglomerate of forced alliteration and mixed
  metaphor. What meaning could there be in this claptrap for Duane?</p>

  <p>Yes. Able Tailor, not Able Seaman. If you want to safely sail the
  suspicious seas of style, men, whatever your nationality or politics you will
  not resort to artisans whose skill is unknown but will select the famous Abe
  Pincus captain of your sartorial ship. Wherever well-dressed men are
  observed, there his navy blue serge suits are seen, made from material
  guaranteed all wool and a yard wide. Investigate his values...</p>

  <p>Duane's examination of the advertisement was brief. He shoved the paper
  aside, clearing the top of the table. White-scrubbed, the expanse of
  pine-wood was exactly the same as that of a thousand other cheap kitchen tables
  worn by long use. Exactly? Some manipulation of the man's fingers at the edge
  of that top, too fast to be clearly seen, and a thin, rectangular panel of
  wood lifted at the very center, as if pushed from beneath. Ford pried at it
  with quivering finger-nails, it hinged upward like a lid, and a shallow
  recess was revealed beneath.</p>

  <p>The man bent over the table, staring into that secret pocket. There was
  only one thing in the depression, something outré as the mode of concealment
  itself. Extricated, it was revealed as a flat piece of gray paper, thick and
  stiff. It might almost have been half of a shirtboard, except that it was
  pierced by a number of rectangular holes, each an eighth of an inch wide and
  about a half-inch long. These perforations, though parallel, were placed
  apparently at random&mdash;made no appreciable pattern.</p>

  <p>Duane slapped down the lid of the hiding place and it sank level with the
  rest of the tabletop. The line of separation was altogether invisible. The
  next instant, the place where the mysterious receptacle had been was once
  more covered by the news sheet, the ad that so poinantly intrigued Duane's
  attention uppermost.</p>

  <p>The bookseller picked up the perforated cardboard, laid it over that
  advertisement. Some lines in the illustration seemed to match faint traces,
  on the gray stencil and these Ford matched up meticulously. Words stared
  through the holes. The man's lips tightened to a straight, grim line as he
  read:</p>

  <p>&mdash;suspicious&mdash;men&mdash;nationality&mdash;unknown&mdash;observed&mdash;navy&mdash;yard&mdash;Investigate&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>"All right, mister!"</i> A suave voice was velvety behind Duane.
  <i>"You're covered!"</i></p>

  <p>The bookseller froze. Only his hands were alive, tightening on the
  table-edge.</p>

  <p>For an infinite moment in the little chamber there was an appalled silence
  as panic and despair gripped Duane's soul. They had tracked him down at
  last&mdash;his implacable enemies. His sanctuary was violated, his masquerade
  discovered. The long game was at an end, finally&mdash;irretrievably at its
  inevitable end!</p>

  <p>"Good evening!" Duane's voice was low-pitched, steady. But he stared
  straight ahead of him as he spoke. His slightest movement, he knew, would
  bring a bullet crashing into his spine and these last few instants of life
  were somehow too sweet to lose.</p>

  <p><i>"Keep your hands way out from your sides and turn around. Slowly.</i>"
  There was excitement in the intruder's tones and gloating triumph. Half the
  Chancelleries of Europe had laid a price upon the head of Ford Duane. The
  American ace in the underground war that eternally is waged between spy and
  counterspy, <i>saboteur</i> and secret agent&mdash;his slayer would gain at
  one stroke honor, and wealth. <i>"Turn around, I say!"</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">HIS arms angling out stiffly, Duane obeyed. At one side of
  the cubicle he called home, the narrow wall had apparently slid aside to
  disclose a dark, shelf-lined niche beyond. Within this crouched a weazened,
  bent creature. In a taloned, grimy hand, a blue-barreled automatic snouted at
  Ford. Beady eyes peered at him from beneath a shock of unkempt, shaggy black
  hair. The fellow's shabby clothing was dust-smeared; there was a streak of
  soot across one sunken cheek. Something of a rat's vileness clung to him, and
  all a rat's cruel savagery.</p>

  <p>Duane's mouth twitched wryly. "Feodor Dvatich," he exclaimed, softly. His
  last hope was gone that this might be an ordinary stickup&mdash;and with it
  the last need for pretence. "Evidently I was too trusting the night I
  recovered the chart of the M-6 mobilization plan from you and trusted your
  promise to leave America forever."</p>

  <p>Dvatich's lips curled back from yellow, pointed teeth in an evil leer.
  "Fifty thousand dollars a certain power would have paid me for those plans.
  You robbed me of that. But now your death will give me many times that,
  hein?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Of a certainty. Feodor Dvatich would otherwise have not wasted his time
  spying on other spies for the sole purpose of watching for you to appear so
  that he might track you down."</p>

  <p>Reluctant admiration sounded in Duane's tones. "So that is how..."</p>

  <p>"That is how I discovered your lair and the secret entrance to it." Yellow
  teeth showed again in a vainglorious smile. "Yes. That is how I succeeded
  where others have failed." He broke off, the muzzle of his pistol jutted
  toward the American. "But enough. If you believe in prayer, pray now, mister,
  because I fire when I count three. One&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>Incredible how swift thought can be when only seconds remain in which to
  think! There was nothing to regret. In his few short years, Duane had packed
  excitement enough for a centenarian, had had innumerable narrow escapes. His
  luck had run out, that was all.</p>

  <p>"Two&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>He would like just once to have had his country know what it was he had
  done for it&mdash;just once to have been praised publicly, publicly rewarded.
  This working in the dark, receiving disguised messages&mdash;Good Lord! There
  was one on his table now! If he kicked out now, it might be days before the
  little gray man in Washington knew it. Meantime...</p>

  <p><i>Half the Atlantic fleet was in the Navy Yard basin! Were they in
  danger! Danger he was being sent to avert?</i></p>

  <p>"Thr&mdash;!" Duane's long leg lashed out, a released spring, caught a
  rung of the cane-bottomed chair, flung it in an explosive arc to crash
  against Dvatich's chest. Gun-bark blazed orange flame, something zizzed past
  the tall man's cheek, and he had flung himself after that chair. His flailing
  fist splashed a yellow-toothed face into bloody pulp. The smoking automatic
  blazed once more, once only. Agony squealed in that hidden room&mdash;the
  sound was hardly human. The sudden flurry of action was over. A broken,
  unmoving body lay crumpled on the bloodstained floor.</p>

  <p>Ford Duane's eyes were hard, expressionless as agate, his face carved
  marble as he came erect, lifting the limp corpse of the would-be assassin and
  throwing it over one shoulder. The drowsy dealer in second-hand books was
  completely obliterated, replaced by a grim-featured, tight-jawed robot who
  stalked into the niche whence the killer had appeared. With his free hand,
  Duane tugged at one of the shelves within, it moved toward him, the wall to
  which it was attached came with it. Behind, wooden stairs, slick with greasy
  damp, dipped down into darkness. The tall man and his grisly burden went
  slowly down into that darkness.</p>

  <p>A half-hour later, Ford Duane was once more stooped over the gray
  cardboard stencil, once more reading the words outlined. There was no sign of
  what had so recently occurred in this back-room space&mdash;no stain on the
  linoleum-covered floor. No change, except that a picture had been
  moved&mdash;was it to conceal a bullet-hole?</p>

  <p>To one side of the advertisement that Duane studied, inconspicuous
  headlines topped a shipnews item buried inconspicuously on an inside page of
  the newspaper:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">ALL EUROPE AN ARMED ENCAMPMENT&mdash;<br>
  PROPAGANDA HERE WORSE THAN 1914!</p>

  <p class="headline">Returning Ambassador Says<br>
  Only American Neutrality Prevents War!</p><br>

  <p class="first">A SINGLE light burned high up in the archway of the Brooklyn
  Navy Yard's Sand Street gate. Within the sharp-cut cone of its glare a
  stalwart marine stood stiffly erect, rifle aslant across a shoulder brightly
  blue. Lithe, young and strong in body he was, this soldier of the sea, but
  the outlines of his broad-planed features were somehow blurred where they
  should have been sharp and clean. Paint pouches showed under his troubled
  eyes and a faint hint of looseness touched&mdash;just touched&mdash;his
  thick-lipped mouth.</p>

  <p>Darkness invested the sleazy dwellings facing the yard's high wall; a
  darkness and a silence that were yet somehow creepily, foully alive. The
  marine's glance slid across to them. It singled out one drab tenement, and
  his lips twisted with bitterness and distaste.</p>

  <p>His hand tightened on his rifle's butt. The shadows in the unlit vestibule
  of that draggled house had suddenly seemed to move. They were moving! The
  darkness there split; an inky blot detached itself, was gliding across the
  cobbles. It disappeared in the deeper blackness of the nearer wall, but a
  hiss of sound told of movement there. The scrape of fabric sliding against
  brick came nearer, stopped.</p>

  <p>"Johnee!" The voice from just beyond the gateway lamp's illumination was
  low-pitched, guarded, but there was a lilting feminine sweetness in it that
  willy-nilly thrilled in the young soldier's veins. "Johnee! Come here!"</p>

  <p>The marine was a motionless, graven image, save that in his right temple,
  a pulse thumped, thumped. "Johnee!" the voice came again, demanding&mdash;and
  seductive. "Just one leetle meenute!"</p>

  <p>There was promise in the dulcet accents, promise, and obscurely,
  threat.</p>

  <p>Private John Boles seemed to fight a force from outside himself, to fight
  unavailingly. His feet shuffled as it turned him toward the summons, as it
  jerked him out of the glare into blinding lightlessness.</p>

  <p>"Johnee, heart of my heart!" A warm body was close against him, warm lips
  were reaching for his. Redolence of woman's hair, of a woman infinitely
  desirable, was dizzyingly in his nostrils. His free arm was tight around a
  soft, palpitant form...</p>

  <p>And swung it, almost roughly then, away from him. "Lola! Damn it! I told
  yuh to stay away from here! Want to get me court-martialed?"</p>

  <p>The girl squirmed in his hold, sobbed. "Oh Johnee! You deed not theenk of
  courtmartials biffore, whan you tell me you luf me. Deed you lie?"</p>

  <p>"No!" The word was a groan, wrested from his light throat. "I didn't lie.
  I was nuts about yuh..."</p>

  <p>"Then whyee...?"</p>

  <p>"Till yuh propositioned me las' night to let some guy slip through the
  gate. I shoulda turned yuh in, Lola."</p>

  <p>"But Johnee! Eet was the money I was theenking of, the money he would pay.
  Just theenk, you could buy your deescharge an' we could be married. Wance
  more I beg you..."</p>

  <p>"Yuh&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>Still low-pitched, almost inaudible, still the marine's expletive rammed
  Lola's whispered words down her throat. "If you pull that once more,
  I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>Thud!</i> The impact of the sandbag against the back of Private John
  Boles' skull was almost soundless. He crumpled, like a ripped flour sack, and
  as he slid slowly to the unseen ground, a hand came over his shoulder to
  grasp his rifle so that it would not clatter an alarm on the concrete.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you've keeled...!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, fool, or you'll give the show away!" This new voice was gruff,
  even in undertone, and vibrant with urgency. "Help me with his clothes,
  quick. We have only five minutes till his relief is due!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">FIVE minutes later, to the dot, the huge portal opened for
  the Sergeant of the Guard and the marine who was to take Private Boles'
  place. The waiting sentry was not quite in his proper position, so that the
  shadows of the gate's embrasure fell across his features. But he presented
  arms punctiliously, about-faced smartly at the Sergeant's "Dismiss!" and
  strode off into the yard's obscurity.</p>

  <p>The Sergeant yawned sleepily. This guard-post business was just red-tape
  in peace time, he thought. Just an excuse to keep a man up nights.</p>

  <p>Huge cranes, mountainous derricks, were interlaced against a leaden,
  overcast sky. Between towering workshop structures impenetrable darkness
  weltered, hiding the now stealthy progress of the man who wore John Boles'
  uniform. The marine barracks were far behind him now. What business could he
  have in this portion of the yard? What business had those others here, for
  that matter, those two furtive figures that suddenly joined him, as though
  spawned by the tar-barrel murk? A low chuckle sounded from one of the
  skulking trio.</p>

  <p>"That was too easy. If you had had a half-hour more, you could have let an
  army in and no one the wiser for it."</p>

  <p>"We are enough," the low-voiced reply came. "That which you carry makes us
  more powerful than any army."</p>

  <p>The row of tall buildings between which they had been hurrying fell away.
  A dim nimbus of light encompassed them. The gray glow of the city reflected
  from the overarching cloud dome. They were in an open space...</p>

  <p>"Careful," the apparent leader said sharply. "Watch your feet."</p>

  <p>That halted the prowlers&mdash;on the edge of what seemed a cliff dropping
  down and down in terraced descent. Far below there was a tiny glint of water.
  Vision cleared, and it became evident that they were standing on the brink of
  a gigantic, man-built basin. Ahead, a vast gray bulk loomed, like some
  unbelievably enormous prehistoric monster asleep in the depression.</p>

  <p>"The <i>Missitucky</i> gentlemen!" the putative marine announced. "Pride
  of the American navy!" There was something obscene in the way he lipped the
  words, something suggestive of a gourmet about to devour a Lucullan feast. A
  murmur came from his companions, the smacking of lips that drooled lewd
  anticipation.</p>

  <p>A chaos of long timbers jutted out from the sides of the drydock, holding
  the dreadnaught erect in its ways. From a few paces to the left, a spiderly
  gangplank soared out over vacancy to reach the battleship's deck. Somehow in
  the drab dimness over there, the measured thump of pacing feet sounded. The
  shadowy figure of a lonely deck watch appeared from around a turret, pounded
  slowly aft.</p>

  <p>"All right, G-X, take him." The leader's snapped command was scarcely
  audible, but one of the others dropped to his knees. His arms lifted. He was
  aiming a squat, grotesquely thick gun. The sound it made was only the dull
  <i>ffft</i> of an air rifle, but aboard the <i>Missitucky,</i> the solitary
  sailor pitched forward, pudded down, asprawl.</p>

  <p>"Quick! Before anyone sees him!" Three silhouettes flitted across the
  gangplank stark against a leaden sky. They clotted momentarily about that
  pathetic blotch on the vessel's deck. Then they were out of sight from the
  dockside and nothing broke the wide, faintly luminous expanse of steel...</p>

  <p>For minutes there was no sign of a living presence there. Then, once more
  the measured thump of pacing feet sounded and from behind the forward turret,
  the dim-described figure of a sailor appeared to pound slowly aft in the
  appointed round of the dreadnaught's deck watch...</p><br>

  <p class="first">DOWN through the silent, deserted hold of the battleship,
  two stealthy skulkers descended, their steps almost inaudible on the steel
  companionways. He who was garbed as a marine led the way, his whole frame
  vibrant as a poisonous bushmaster snake tracking its prey. The other, more
  timorous in his progress, was shapeless in the voluminous topcoat he wore
  despite the heat. He was carrying something, a large box&mdash;carrying it
  gingerly as though he were in a deathly fear of it.</p>

  <p>"Here we are!" the fake marine breathed. In the dim reaches of the
  lowermost hold, illuminated by a single pendant light, the vast loom of the
  vessel's engine-room stretched away. "Get busy!"</p>

  <p>The other man lurched past him, deposited his mysterious burden close
  against the base of a gigantic Diesel engine, did something with shaking
  hands. A sharp metallic click splintered the silence, was repeated, became a
  ticking.</p>

  <p>"All set, H-T?" he asked. "You're sure?"</p>

  <p>His vis-à-vis turned. "Sure. In twenty minutes there will be no more
  <i>Missitucky.</i>"</p>

  <p>"And the explosion that destroys it will set the world aflame. Look here!"
  He held out the strange metallic fragment. "When they find this in the
  wreckage, they will be sure they know which nation inspired the deed." With
  the muzzle of his revolver he pointed out words stamped into the metal:
  "Creusot Frères et Cie."</p>

  <p>The other chuckled. "I'll say they will be! What price 'no entangling
  alliances' then?"</p>

  <p>"A hundred for a pfennig!" The supposed marine bent swiftly to place that
  lying piece of evidence on the floor. "These aloof Americans will be begging
  us to ally ourselves with them, and we will&mdash;on our own terms. But we'd
  better get out of here in a hurry. Come!" He turned to the hatchway behind
  him...</p>

  <p>And he did not take the pace he had intended! A tall, unearthly figure was
  advancing out of its darkness, as though spawned by deathly night.</p>

  <p>But that which froze the <i>saboteurs</i> into fear-struck rigidity was
  the one, black-gloved hand that was visible, clutching a wide barreled, queer
  weapon. Not the weapon itself. These prowlers of the dark were, after all,
  brave men. But it was the finger that curled about the trigger, the
  <i>scarlet</i> finger that told them who it was that had tracked them down.
  The dread name dripped from the spy leader's white lips:</p>

  <p><i>"Red Finger! Gott im Himmel! Es ist der rote Finger!"</i></p>

  <p>Yes, they were brave men. No cowards take part in the secret war. But to
  see before them the avatar of their trade&mdash;to be caught in <i>flagrante
  delicto</i> by HIM was enough to break nerves of the stoutest villain, enough
  to make the hottest blood turn to water in gelid veins.</p>

  <p>"Red Finger!" The planter of the infernal machine whispered it. "God have
  mercy!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">THEN silence, through which cut the tick, tick, tick of the
  bomb. Silence for a long, accusing minute, while Red Finger stood statuesque,
  ominous, and the destroyers cringed spineless before him. Silence, till a
  husky, intonationless voice dripped from behind the gray mask:</p>

  <p>"Yes, Adolf Mauerer. Red Finger. You did not really hope to escape me, did
  you?"</p>

  <p>The American's strange gun was rock-steady, jutting pointblank at the
  others. "Shut off that machine, Mauerer. Shut it off." His command thudded,
  word by slow word, into an atmosphere somehow unnaturally thick.</p>

  <p>H-T started to move, but somehow Mauerer's shoulder was in his way,
  halting him. "Impossible, Red Finger," the latter responded, in a dead, flat
  voice. <i>"Once started, the bomb cannot again be stopped!"</i></p>

  <p>Tick. Tick. Tick. It was as if Death's heels clicked, approaching slowly,
  inexorably. Tick. Tick. Tick.</p>

  <p>"No?" There was no emotion in the masked man's tones. "Then we stay here,
  we three, till it explodes."</p>

  <p>Tick. Tick. Tick.</p>

  <p>Mauerer was immovable, indomitable as the implacable enemy who faced him.
  Tickticktick. But his companion's frame was taken by an ague, by a shiver,
  imperceptible at first, that grew more and more violent, until...</p>

  <p><i>"No,"</i> a wild, thin shriek rang out. "No! I will not die! Ach Gott!
  I will not die <i>like dot!</i>" He twisted, Mauerer struck at him viciously.
  The blow staggered him, he plunged to the floor. A soft hiss sounded from Red
  Finger's gun, a jet of fine mist spat from it, sprayed Mauerer's face. The
  spy-leader lurched away, clawing at his throat. Crumpled. H-T was crawling
  across the deck, writhing toward the mechanism that ticked Death's approach.
  He reached it, scrabbled at it...</p>

  <p>Red Finger whirled to the pound of a footfall on a steel companionway. A
  sailor was coming down the stairs, a sailor from beneath whose canted cap
  blonde lair strayed. The American's tension relaxed, he started to turn
  away.</p>

  <p>"Fritz," the man at the infernal machine squealed. "Get him! Kill
  him!"</p>

  <p>A knife flashed into the sailor's hand and he launched from the stairs in
  a wild leap at Red Finger, the lethal steel arcking. Red Finger's gun spat
  mist again.</p>

  <p>The sailor stumbled, slid lifelessly to lie in a crumpled heap over the
  body of his leader. Red Finger jerked around to the last of the trio. "Shut
  it off!" he barked. "Or we'll all go up."</p>

  <p>The man's shaking hand tugged at the apparatus. "It's stuck," he
  whimpered. "I cannot push the lever over!"</p>

  <p>He popped to his feet, his mouth aslaver, his eyes utterly insane. "Let me
  out," he squealed. "Let me out!" He hurtled toward the hatchway, his face
  twisted to a semblance of ratlike ferocity, hurtled past Red Finger. The
  American let him go, dropped to his knees before the ticking bomb. There were
  seconds left, perhaps he could yet get it stopped. He had seen what the other
  had been trying to do...</p>

  <p>The retreating footsteps of the man whom fear had driven mad resounded
  loudly up the steel stairway, but it did not drown out the awful tickticktick
  of the infernal machine. Red Finger tore at the switches, ripped his gloves.
  His fingers dripped blood. Tickticktick...</p>

  <p>"Halt!" A sharp challenge, distance-muffled, rang out. The counterspy was
  conscious of the pound of many feet, far above. Good Lord! There were men on
  board now, they were coming down here, they would be caught in the explosion.
  He had to&mdash;get this damn' thing&mdash;stopped.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Suddenly it was done. The obdurate lever slid over, the ticking was
  stilled. A warrant-officer pounded into the engine room, revolver in hand.
  Red Finger rose to meet him, hands above his head. "Keep those others out,"
  he snapped, "till I have a chance to talk with you."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE morning sun burned down into the canyon that is Fourth
  Avenue. Ford Duane sat in a broken-backed swivel chair in the doorway of his
  second-hand bookshop, and yawned. Then he continued his languid perusal of
  the morning newspaper. One item seemed to arrest his attention
  momentarily.</p>

  <p>"Early this morning," it said, "the harbor police found the bodies of
  three men floating in the Bay. The bodies were clothed only in underwear.
  There were no marks of violence or any other indication of how they had died
  or who they were."</p>

  <p>Duane yawned again. It was lucky that the commandant of the Navy Yard had
  listened to reason. A trial, even a military trial, would inevitably have
  involved the name of Mauerer's nation. Skilled propagandists would have
  ferreted out the truth, published it...</p>

  <p>It was peaceful here in the hot sun...</p>
