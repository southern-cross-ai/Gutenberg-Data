<h2>THE SPIKE</h2>

<p>It was late-afternoon. Forty-nine of us, forty-eight men and one
woman, lay on the green waiting for the spike to open. We were too
tired to talk much. We just sprawled about exhaustedly, with
home-made cigarettes sticking out of our scrubby faces. Overhead
the chestnut branches were covered with blossom, and beyond that
great woolly clouds floated almost motionless in a clear sky.
Littered on the grass, we seemed dingy, urban riff-raff. We defiled
the scene, like sardine-tins and paper bags on the seashore.</p>

<p>What talk there was ran on the Tramp Major of this spike. He was
a devil, everyone agreed, a tartar, a tyrant, a bawling,
blasphemous, uncharitable dog. You couldn't call your soul your own
when he was about, and many a tramp had he kicked out in the middle
of the night for giving a back answer. When You, came to be
searched, he fair held you upside down and shook you. If you were
caught with tobacco there was bell to. Pay, and if you went in with
money (which is against the law) God help you.</p>

<p>I had eightpence on me. 'For the love of Christ, mate,' the old
hands advised me, 'don't you take it in. You'd get seven days for
going into the spike with eightpence!'</p>

<p>So I buried my money in a hole under the hedge, marking the spot
with a lump of flint. Then we set about smuggling our matches and
tobacco, for it is forbidden to take these into nearly all spikes,
and one is supposed to surrender them at the gate. We hid them in
our socks, except for the twenty or so per cent who had no socks,
and had to carry the tobacco in their boots, even under their very
toes. We stuffed our ankles with contraband until anyone seeing us
might have imagined an outbreak of elephantiasis. But is an
unwritten law that even the sternest Tramp Majors do not search
below the knee, and in the end only one man was caught. This was
Scotty, a little hairy tramp with a bastard accent sired by cockney
out of Glasgow. His tin of cigarette ends fell out of his sock at
the wrong moment, and was impounded.</p>

<p>At six, the gates swung open and we shuffled in. An official at
the gate entered our names and other particulars in the register
and took our bundles away from us. The woman was sent off to the
workhouse, and we others into the spike. It was a gloomy, chilly,
limewashed place, consisting only of a bathroom and dining-room and
about a hundred narrow stone cells. The terrible Tramp Major met us
at the door and herded us into the bathroom to be stripped and
searched. He was a gruff, soldierly man of forty, who gave the
tramps no more ceremony than sheep at the dipping-pond, shoving
them this way and that and shouting oaths in their faces. But when
he came to myself, he looked hard at me, and said:</p>

<p>'You are a gentleman?'</p>

<p>'I suppose so,' I said.</p>

<p>He gave me another long look. 'Well, that's bloody bad luck,
guv'nor,' he said, 'that's bloody bad luck, that is.' And
thereafter he took it into his head to treat me with compassion,
even with a kind of respect.</p>

<p>It was a disgusting sight, that bathroom. All the indecent
secrets of our underwear were exposed; the grime, the rents and
patches, the bits of string doing duty for buttons, the layers upon
layers of fragmentary garments, some of them mere collections of
holes, held together by dirt. The room became a press of steaming
nudity, the sweaty odours of the tramps competing with the sickly,
sub-faecal stench native to the spike. Some of the men refused the
bath, and washed only their 'toe-rags', the horrid, greasy little
clouts which tramps bind round their feet. Each of us had three
minutes in which to bathe himself. Six greasy, slippery roller
towels had to serve for the lot of us.</p>

<p>When we had bathed our own clothes were taken away from us, and
we were dressed in the workhouse shirts, grey cotton things like
nightshirts, reaching to the middle of the thigh. Then we were sent
into the dining-room, where supper was set out on the deal tables.
It was the invariable spike meal, always the same, whether
breakfast, dinner or supper&mdash;half a pound of bread, a bit of
margarine, and a pint of so-called tea. It took us five minutes to
gulp down the cheap, noxious food. Then the Tramp Major served us
with three cotton blankets each, and drove us off to our cells for
the night. The doors were locked on the outside a little before
seven in the evening, and would stay locked for the next twelve
hours.</p>

<p>The cells measured eight feet by five, and, had no lighting
apparatus except a tiny, barred window high up in the wall, and a
spyhole in the door. There were no bugs, and we had bedsteads and
straw palliasses, rare luxuries both. In many spikes one sleeps on
a wooden shelf, and in some on the bare floor, with a rolled-up
coat for pillow. With a cell to myself, and a bed, I was hoping for
a sound night's rest. But I did not get it, for there is always
something wrong in the spike, and the peculiar shortcoming here, as
I discovered immediately, was the cold. May had begun, and in
honour of the season&mdash;a little sacrifice to the gods of
spring, perhaps&mdash;the authorities had cut off the steam from
the hot pipes. The cotton blankets were almost useless. One spent
the night in turning from side to side, falling asleep for ten
minutes and waking half frozen, and watching for dawn.</p>

<p>As always happens in the spike, I had at last managed to fall
comfortably asleep when it was time to get up. The Tramp. Major
came marching down the passage with his heavy tread, unlocking the
doors and yelling to us to show a leg. Promptly the passage was
full of squalid shirt-clad figures rushing for the bathroom, for
there was Only One tub full of water between us all in the morning,
and it was first come first served. When I arrived twenty tramps
had already washed their faces. I gave one glance at the black scum
on top of the water, and decided to go dirty for the day.</p>

<p>We hurried into our clothes, and then went to the dining-room to
bolt our breakfast. The bread was much worse than usual, because
the military-minded idiot of a Tramp Major had cut it into slices
overnight, so that it was as hard as ship's biscuit. But we were
glad of our tea after the cold, restless night. I do not know what
tramps would do without tea, or rather the stuff they miscall tea.
It is their food, their medicine, their panacea for all evils.
Without the half goon or so of it that they suck down a day, I
truly believe they could not face their existence.</p>

<p>After breakfast we had to undress again for the medical
inspection, which is a precaution against smallpox. It was three
quarters of an hour before the doctor arrived, and one had time now
to look about him and see what manner of men we were. It was an
instructive sight. We stood shivering naked to the waist in two
long ranks in the passage. The filtered light, bluish and cold,
lighted us up with unmerciful clarity. No one can imagine, unless
he has seen such a thing, what pot-bellied, degenerate curs we
looked. Shock heads, hairy, crumpled faces, hollow chests, flat
feet, sagging muscles&mdash;every kind of malformation and physical
rottenness were there. All were flabby and discoloured, as all
tramps are under their deceptive sunburn. Two or three figures wen
there stay ineradicably in my mind. Old 'Daddy', aged seventy-four,
with his truss, and his red, watering eyes, a herring-gutted
starveling with sparse beard and sunken cheeks, looking like the
corpse of Lazarus in some primitive picture: an imbecile, wandering
hither and thither with vague giggles, coyly pleased because his
trousers constantly slipped down and left him nude. But few of us
were greatly better than these; there were not ten decently built
men among us, and half, I believe, should have been in
hospital.</p>

<p>This being Sunday, we were to be kept in the spike over the
week-end. As soon as the doctor had gone we were herded back to the
dining-room, and its door shut upon us. It was a lime-washed,
stone-floored room, unspeakably dreary with its furniture of deal
boards and benches, and its prison smell. The windows were so high
up that one could not look outside, and the sole ornament was a set
of Rules threatening dire penalties to any casual who misconducted
himself. We packed the room so tight that one could not move an
elbow without jostling somebody. Already, at eight o'clock in the
morning, we were bored with our captivity. There was nothing to
talk about except the petty gossip of the road, the good and bad
spikes, the charitable and uncharitable counties, the iniquities of
the police and the Salvation Army. Tramps hardly ever get away from
these subjects; they talk, as it were, nothing but shop. They have
nothing worthy to be called conversation, bemuse emptiness of belly
leaves no speculation in their souls. The world is too much with
them. Their next meal is never quite secure, and so they cannot
think of anything except the next meal.</p>

<p>Two hours dragged by. Old Daddy, witless with age, sat silent,
his back bent like a bow and his inflamed eyes dripping slowly on
to the floor. George, a dirty old tramp notorious for the queer
habit of sleeping in his hat, grumbled about a parcel of tommy that
he had lost on the toad. Bill the moocher, the best built man of us
all, a Herculean sturdy beggar who smelt of beer even after twelve
hours in the spike, told tales of mooching, of pints stood him in
the boozers, and of a parson who had peached to the police and got
him seven days. William and, Fred, two young, ex-fishermen from
Norfolk, sang a sad song about Unhappy Bella, who was betrayed and
died in the snow. The imbecile drivelled, about an imaginary toff,
who had once given him two hundred and fifty-seven golden
sovereigns. So the time passed, with dun talk and dull obscenities.
Everyone was smoking, except Scotty, whose tobacco had been seized,
and he was so miserable in his smokeless state that I stood him the
makings of a cigarette. We smoked furtively, hiding our cigarettes
like schoolboys when we heard the Tramp Major's step, for smoking
though connived at, was officially forbidden.</p>

<p>Most of the tramps spent ten consecutive hours in this dreary
room. It is hard to imagine how they put up with 11. I have come to
think that boredom is the worst of all a tramp's evils, worse than
hunger and discomfort, worse even than the constant feeling of
being socially disgraced. It is a silly piece of cruelty to confine
an ignorant man all day with nothing to do; it is like chaining a
dog in a barrel, only an educated man, who has consolations within
himself, can endure confinement. Tramps, unlettered types as nearly
all of them are, face their poverty with blank, resourceless minds.
Fixed for ten hours on a comfortless bench, they know no way of
occupying themselves, and if they think at all it is to whimper
about hard luck and pine for work. They have not the stuff in them
to endure the horrors of idleness. And so, since so much of their
lives is spent in doing nothing, they suffer agonies from
boredom.</p>

<p>I was much luckier than the others, because at ten o'clock the
Tramp Major picked me out for the most coveted of all jobs in the
spike, the job of helping in the workhouse kitchen. There was not
really any work to be done there, and I was able to make off and
hide in a shed used for storing potatoes, together with some
workhouse paupers who were skulking to avoid the Sunday-morning
service. There was a stove burning there, and comfortable packing
cases to sit on, and back numbers of the <i>Family Herald</i>, and
even a copy of <i>Raffles</i> from the workhouse library. It was
paradise after the spike.</p>

<p>Also, I had my dinner from the workhouse table, and it was one
of the biggest meals I have ever eaten. A tramp does not see such a
meal twice in the year, in the spike or out of it. The paupers told
me that they always gorged to the bursting point on Sundays, and
went hungry six days of the week. When the meal was over the cook
set me to do the washing-up, and told me to throw away the food
that remained. The wastage was astonishing; great dishes of beef,
and bucketfuls of broad and vegetables, were pitched away like
rubbish, and then defiled with tea-leaves. I filled five dustbins
to overflowing with good food. And while I did so my follow tramps
were sitting two hundred yards away in the spike, their bellies
half filled with the spike dinner of the everlasting bread and tea,
and perhaps two cold boiled potatoes each in honour of Sunday. It
appeared that the food was thrown away from deliberate policy,
rather than that it should be given to the tramps.</p>

<p>At three I left the workhouse kitchen and went back to the
spike. The, boredom in that crowded, comfortless room was now
unbearable. Even smoking had ceased, for a tramp's only tobacco is
picked-up cigarette ends, and, like a browsing beast, he starves if
he is long away from the pavement-pasture. To occupy the time I
talked with a rather superior tramp, a young carpenter who wore a
collar and tie, and was on the road, he said, for lack of a set of
tools. He kept a little aloof from the other tramps, and held
himself more like a free man than a casual. He had literary tastes,
too, and carried one of Scott's novels on all his wanderings. He
told me he never entered a spike unless driven there by hunger,
sleeping under hedges and behind ricks in preference. Along the
south coast he had begged by day and slept in bathing-machines for
weeks at a time.</p>

<p>We talked of life on the road. He criticized the system which
makes a tramp spend fourteen hours a day in the spike, and the
other ten in walking and dodging the police. He spoke of his own
case&mdash;six months at the public charge for want of three
pounds' worth of tools. It was idiotic, he said.</p>

<p>Then I told him about the wastage of food in the workhouse
kitchen, and what I thought of it. And at that he changed his tune
immediately. I saw that I had awakened the pew-renter who sleeps in
every English workman. Though he had been famished, along with the
rest, he at once saw reasons why the food should have been thrown
away rather than given to the tramps. He admonished me quite
severely.</p>

<p>'They have to do it,' he said. 'If they made these places too
pleasant you'd have all the scum of the country flocking into them.
It's only the bad food as keeps all that scum away. These tramps
are too lazy to work, that's all that's wrong with them. You don't
want to go encouraging of them. They're scum.'</p>

<p>I produced arguments to prove him wrong, but he would not
listen. He kept repeating:</p>

<p>'You don't want to have any pity on these tramps&mdash;scum,
they are. You don't want to judge them by the same standards as men
like you and me. They're scum, just scum.'</p>

<p>It was interesting to see how subtly he disassociated himself
from his fellow tramps. He has been on the road six months, but in
the sight of God, he seemed to imply, he was not a tramp. His body
might be in the spike, but his spirit soared far away, in the pure
aether of the middle classes.</p>

<p>The clock's hands crept round with excruciating slowness. We
were too bored even to talk now, the only sound was of oaths and
reverberating yawns. One would force his eyes away from the clock
for what seemed an age, and then look back again to see that the
hands had advanced three minutes. Ennui clogged our souls like cold
mutton fat. Our bones ached because of it. The clock's hands stood
at four, and supper was not till six, and there was nothing left
remarkable beneath the visiting moon.</p>

<p>At last six o'clock did come, and the Tramp Major and his
assistant arrived with supper. The yawning tramps brisked up like
lions at feeding-time. But the meal was a dismal disappointment.
The bread, bad enough in the morning, was now positively uneatable;
it was so hard that even the strongest jaws could make little
impression on it. The older men went almost supperless, and not a
man could finish his portion, hungry though most of us were. When
we had finished, the blankets were served out immediately, and we
were hustled off once more to the bare, chilly cells.</p>

<p>Thirteen hours went by. At seven we were awakened, and rushed
forth to squabble over the water in the bathroom, and bolt our
ration of bread and tea. Our time in the spike was up, but we could
riot go until the doctor had examined us again, for the authorities
have a terror of smallpox and its distribution by tramps. The
doctor kept us waiting two hours this time, and it was ten o'clock
before we finally escaped.</p>

<p>At last it was time to go, and we were let out into the yard.
How bright everything looked, and how sweet the winds did blow,
after the gloomy, reeking spike! The Tramp Major handed each man
his bundle of confiscated possessions, and a hunk of bread and
cheese for midday dinner, and then we took the road, hastening to
get out of sight of the spike and its discipline, This was our
interim of freedom. After a day and two nights of wasted time we
had eight hours or so to take our recreation, to scour the roads
for cigarette ends, to beg, and to look for work. Also, we had to
make our ten, fifteen, or it might be twenty miles to the next
spike, where the game would begin anew.</p>

<p>I disinterred my eightpence and took the road with Nobby, a
respectable, downhearted tramp who carried a spare pair of boots
and visited all the Labour Exchanges. Our late companions were
scattering north, south, cast and west, like bugs into a mattress.
Only the imbecile loitered at the spike gates, until the Tramp
Major had to chase him away.</p>

<p>Nobby and I set out for Croydon. It was a quiet road, there were
no cars passing, the blossom covered the chestnut trees like great
wax candles. Everything was so quiet and smelt so clean, it was
hard to realize that only a few minutes ago we had been packed with
that band of prisoners in a stench of drains and soft soap. The
others had all disappeared; we two seemed to be the only tramps on
the road.</p>

<p>Then I heard a hurried step behind me, and felt a tap on my arm.
It was little Scotty, who had run panting after us. He pulled a
rusty tin box from his pocket. He wore a friendly smile, like a man
who is repaying an obligation.</p>

<p>'Here y'are, mate,' he said cordially. 'I owe you some fag ends.
You stood me a smoke yesterday. The Tramp Major give me back my box
of fag ends when we come out this morning. One good turn deserves
another&mdash;here y'are.'</p>

<p>And he put four sodden, debauched, loathly cigarette ends into
my hand.</p>

<p><a name="part2" id="part2"></a>
</p>

<h2>A HANGING (1931)</h2>

<p>It was in Burma, a sodden morning of the rains. A sickly light,
like yellow tinfoil, was slanting over the high walls into the jail
yard. We were waiting outside the condemned cells, a row of sheds
fronted with double bars, like small animal cages. Each cell
measured about ten feet by ten and was quite bare within except for
a plank bed and a pot of drinking water. In some of them brown
silent men were squatting at the inner bars, with their blankets
draped round them. These were the condemned men, due to be hanged
within the next week or two.</p>

<p>One prisoner had been brought out of his cell. He was a Hindu, a
puny wisp of a man, with a shaven head and vague liquid eyes. He
had a thick, sprouting moustache, absurdly too big for his body,
rather like the moustache of a comic man on the films. Six tall
Indian warders were guarding him and getting him ready for the
gallows. Two of them stood by with rifles and fixed bayonets, while
the others handcuffed him, passed a chain through his handcuffs and
fixed it to their belts, and lashed his arms tight to his sides.
They crowded very close about him, with their hands always on him
in a careful, caressing grip, as though all the while feeling him
to make sure he was there. It was like men handling a fish which is
still alive and may jump back into the water. But he stood quite
unresisting, yielding his arms limply to the ropes, as though he
hardly noticed what was happening.</p>

<p>Eight o'clock struck and a bugle call, desolately thin in the
wet air, floated from the distant barracks. The superintendent of
the jail, who was standing apart from the rest of us, moodily
prodding the gravel with his stick, raised his head at the sound.
He was an army doctor, with a grey toothbrush moustache and a gruff
voice. "For God's sake hurry up, Francis," he said irritably. "The
man ought to have been dead by this time. Aren't you ready
yet?"</p>

<p>Francis, the head jailer, a fat Dravidian in a white drill suit
and gold spectacles, waved his black hand. "Yes sir, yes sir," he
bubbled. "All iss satisfactorily prepared. The hangman iss waiting.
We shall proceed."</p>

<p>"Well, quick march, then. The prisoners can't get their
breakfast till this job's over."</p>

<p>We set out for the gallows. Two warders marched on either side
of the prisoner, with their rifles at the slope; two others marched
close against him, gripping him by arm and shoulder, as though at
once pushing and supporting him. The rest of us, magistrates and
the like, followed behind. Suddenly, when we had gone ten yards,
the procession stopped short without any order or warning. A
dreadful thing had happened&mdash;a dog, come goodness knows
whence, had appeared in the yard. It came bounding among us with a
loud volley of barks, and leapt round us wagging its whole body,
wild with glee at finding so many human beings together. It was a
large woolly dog, half Airedale, half pariah. For a moment it
pranced round us, and then, before anyone could stop it, it had
made a dash for the prisoner, and jumping up tried to lick his
face. Everyone stood aghast, too taken aback even to grab at the
dog.</p>

<p>"Who let that bloody brute in here?" said the superintendent
angrily. "Catch it, someone!"</p>

<p>A warder, detached from the escort, charged clumsily after the
dog, but it danced and gambolled just out of his reach, taking
everything as part of the game. A young Eurasian jailer picked up a
handful of gravel and tried to stone the dog away, but it dodged
the stones and came after us again. Its yaps echoed from the jail
wails. The prisoner, in the grasp of the two warders, looked on
incuriously, as though this was another formality of the hanging.
It was several minutes before someone managed to catch the dog.
Then we put my handkerchief through its collar and moved off once
more, with the dog still straining and whimpering.</p>

<p>It was about forty yards to the gallows. I watched the bare
brown back of the prisoner marching in front of me. He walked
clumsily with his bound arms, but quite steadily, with that bobbing
gait of the Indian who never straightens his knees. At each step
his muscles slid neatly into place, the lock of hair on his scalp
danced up and down, his feet printed themselves on the wet gravel.
And once, in spite of the men who gripped him by each shoulder, he
stepped slightly aside to avoid a puddle on the path.</p>

<p>It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it
means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner
step aside to avoid the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable
wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide. This
man was not dying, he was alive just as we were alive. All the
organs of his body were working&mdash;bowels digesting food, skin
renewing itself, nails growing, tissues forming&mdash;all toiling
away in solemn foolery. His nails would still be growing when he
stood on the drop, when he was falling through the air with a tenth
of a second to live. His eyes saw the yellow gravel and the grey
walls, and his brain still remembered, foresaw,
reasoned&mdash;reasoned even about puddles. He and we were a party
of men walking together, seeing, hearing, feeling, understanding
the same world; and in two minutes, with a sudden snap, one of us
would be gone&mdash;one mind less, one world less.</p>

<p>The gallows stood in a small yard, separate from the main
grounds of the prison, and overgrown with tall prickly weeds. It
was a brick erection like three sides of a shed, with planking on
top, and above that two beams and a crossbar with the rope
dangling. The hangman, a grey-haired convict in the white uniform
of the prison, was waiting beside his machine. He greeted us with a
servile crouch as we entered. At a word from Francis the two
warders, gripping the prisoner more closely than ever, half led,
half pushed him to the gallows and helped him clumsily up the
ladder. Then the hangman climbed up and fixed the rope round the
prisoner's neck.</p>

<p>We stood waiting, five yards away. The warders had formed in a
rough circle round the gallows. And then, when the noose was fixed,
the prisoner began crying out on his god. It was a high, reiterated
cry of "Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!", not urgent and fearful like a prayer
or a cry for help, but steady, rhythmical, almost like the tolling
of a bell. The dog answered the sound with a whine. The hangman,
still standing on the gallows, produced a small cotton bag like a
flour bag and drew it down over the prisoner's face. But the sound,
muffled by the cloth, still persisted, over and over again: "Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!"</p>

<p>The hangman climbed down and stood ready, holding the lever.
Minutes seemed to pass. The steady, muffled crying from the
prisoner went on and on, "Ram! Ram! Ram!" never faltering for an
instant. The superintendent, his head on his chest, was slowly
poking the ground with his stick; perhaps he was counting the
cries, allowing the prisoner a fixed number&mdash;fifty, perhaps,
or a hundred. Everyone had changed colour. The Indians had gone
grey like bad coffee, and one or two of the bayonets were wavering.
We looked at the lashed, hooded man on the drop, and listened to
his cries&mdash;each cry another second of life; the same thought
was in all our minds: oh, kill him quickly, get it over, stop that
abominable noise!</p>

<p>Suddenly the superintendent made up his mind. Throwing up his
head he made a swift motion with his stick. "Chalo!" he shouted
almost fiercely.</p>

<p>There was a clanking noise, and then dead silence. The prisoner
had vanished, and the rope was twisting on itself. I let go of the
dog, and it galloped immediately to the back of the gallows; but
when it got there it stopped short, barked, and then retreated into
a corner of the yard, where it stood among the weeds, looking
timorously out at us. We went round the gallows to inspect the
prisoner's body. He was dangling with his toes pointed straight
downwards, very slowly revolving, as dead as a stone.</p>

<p>The superintendent reached out with his stick and poked the bare
body; it oscillated, slightly. "<i>He's</i> all right," said the
superintendent. He backed out from under the gallows, and blew out
a deep breath. The moody look had gone out of his face quite
suddenly. He glanced at his wrist-watch. "Eight minutes past eight.
Well, that's all for this morning, thank God."</p>

<p>The warders unfixed bayonets and marched away. The dog, sobered
and conscious of having misbehaved itself, slipped after them. We
walked out of the gallows yard, past the condemned cells with their
waiting prisoners, into the big central yard of the prison. The
convicts, under the command of warders armed with lathis, were
already receiving their breakfast. They squatted in long rows, each
man holding a tin pannikin, while two warders with buckets marched
round ladling out rice; it seemed quite a homely, jolly scene,
after the hanging. An enormous relief had come upon us now that the
job was done. One felt an impulse to sing, to break into a run, to
snigger. All at once everyone began chattering gaily.</p>

<p>The Eurasian boy walking beside me nodded towards the way we had
come, with a knowing smile: "Do you know, sir, our friend (he meant
the dead man), when he heard his appeal had been dismissed, he
pissed on the floor of his cell. From fright.&mdash;Kindly take one
of my cigarettes, sir. Do you not admire my new silver case, sir?
From the boxwallah, two rupees eight annas. Classy European
style."</p>

<p>Several people laughed&mdash;at what, nobody seemed certain.</p>

<p>Francis was walking by the superintendent, talking garrulously.
"Well, sir, all hass passed off with the utmost satisfactoriness.
It wass all finished&mdash;flick! like that. It iss not always
so&mdash;oah, no! I have known cases where the doctor wass obliged
to go beneath the gallows and pull the prisoner's legs to ensure
decease. Most disagreeable!"</p>

<p>"Wriggling about, eh? That's bad," said the superintendent.</p>

<p>"Ach, sir, it iss worse when they become refractory! One man, I
recall, clung to the bars of hiss cage when we went to take him
out. You will scarcely credit, sir, that it took six warders to
dislodge him, three pulling at each leg. We reasoned with him. 'My
dear fellow,' we said, 'think of all the pain and trouble you are
causing to us!' But no, he would not listen! Ach, he wass very
troublesome!"</p>

<p>I found that I was laughing quite loudly. Everyone was laughing.
Even the superintendent grinned in a tolerant way. "You'd better
all come out and have a drink," he said quite genially. "I've got a
bottle of whisky in the car. We could do with it."</p>

<p>We went through the big double gates of the prison, into the
road. "Pulling at his legs!" exclaimed a Burmese magistrate
suddenly, and burst into a loud chuckling. We all began laughing
again. At that moment Francis's anecdote seemed extraordinarily
funny. We all had a drink together, native and European alike,
quite amicably. The dead man was a hundred yards away.</p>

<h2>BOOKSHOP MEMORIES (1936)</h2>

<p>When I worked in a second-hand bookshop&mdash;so easily
pictured, if you don't work in one, as a kind of paradise where
charming old gentlemen browse eternally among calf-bound
folios&mdash;the thing that chiefly struck me was the rarity of
really bookish people. Our shop had an exceptionally interesting
stock, yet I doubt whether ten per cent of our customers knew a
good book from a bad one. First edition snobs were much commoner
than lovers of literature, but oriental students haggling over
cheap textbooks were commoner still, and vague-minded women looking
for birthday presents for their nephews were commonest of all.</p>

<p>Many of the people who came to us were of the kind who would be
a nuisance anywhere but have special opportunities in a bookshop.
For example, the dear old lady who 'wants a book for an invalid' (a
very common demand, that), and the other dear old lady who read
such a nice book in 1897 and wonders whether you can find her a
copy. Unfortunately she doesn't remember the title or the author's
name or what the book was about, but she does remember that it had
a red cover. But apart from these there are two well-known types of
pest by whom every second-hand bookshop is haunted. One is the
decayed person smelling of old bread-crusts who comes every day,
sometimes several times a day, and tries to sell you worthless
books. The other is the person who orders large quantities of books
for which he has not the smallest intention of paying. In our shop
we sold nothing on credit, but we would put books aside, or order
them if necessary, for people who arranged to fetch them away
later. Scarcely half the people who ordered books from us ever came
back. It used to puzzle me at first. What made them do it? They
would come in and demand some rare and expensive book, would make
us promise over and over again to keep it for them, and then would
vanish never to return. But many of them, of course, were
unmistakable paranoiacs. They used to talk in a grandiose manner
about themselves and tell the most ingenious stories to explain how
they had happened to come out of doors without any
money&mdash;stories which, in many cases, I am sure they themselves
believed. In a town like London there are always plenty of not
quite certifiable lunatics walking the streets, and they tend to
gravitate towards bookshops, because a bookshop is one of the few
places where you can hang about for a long time without spending
any money. In the end one gets to know these people almost at a
glance. For all their big talk there is something moth-eaten and
aimless about them. Very often, when we were dealing with an
obvious paranoiac, we would put aside the books he asked for and
then put them back on the shelves the moment he had gone. None of
them, I noticed, ever attempted to take books away without paying
for them; merely to order them was enough&mdash;it gave them, I
suppose, the illusion that they were spending real money.</p>

<p>Like most second-hand bookshops we had various sidelines. We
sold second-hand typewriters, for instance, and also
stamps&mdash;used stamps, I mean. Stamp-collectors are a strange,
silent, fish-like breed, of all ages, but only of the male sex;
women, apparently, fail to see the peculiar charm of gumming bits
of coloured paper into albums. We also sold sixpenny horoscopes
compiled by somebody who claimed to have foretold the Japanese
earthquake. They were in sealed envelopes and I never opened one of
them myself, but the people who bought them often came back and
told us how 'true' their horoscopes had been. (Doubtless any
horoscope seems 'true' if it tells you that you are highly
attractive to the opposite sex and your worst fault is generosity.)
We did a good deal of business in children's books, chiefly
'remainders'. Modern books for children are rather horrible things,
especially when you see them in the mass. Personally I would sooner
give a child a copy of Petronius Arbiter than <i>Peter Pan</i>, but
even Barrie seems manly and wholesome compared with some of his
later imitators. At Christmas time we spent a feverish ten days
struggling with Christmas cards and calendars, which are tiresome
things to sell but good business while the season lasts. It used to
interest me to see the brutal cynicism with which Christian
sentiment is exploited. The touts from the Christmas card firms
used to come round with their catalogues as early as June. A phrase
from one of their invoices sticks in my memory. It was: '2 doz.
Infant Jesus with rabbits'.</p>

<p>But our principal sideline was a lending library&mdash;the usual
'twopenny no-deposit' library of five or six hundred volumes, all
fiction. How the book thieves must love those libraries! It is the
easiest crime in the world to borrow a book at one shop for
twopence, remove the label and sell it at another shop for a
shilling. Nevertheless booksellers generally find that it pays them
better to have a certain number of books stolen (we used to lose
about a dozen a month) than to frighten customers away by demanding
a deposit.</p>

<p>Our shop stood exactly on the frontier between Hampstead and
Camden Town, and we were frequented by all types from baronets to
bus-conductors. Probably our library subscribers were a fair
cross-section of London's reading public. It is therefore worth
noting that of all the authors in our library the one who 'went
out' the best was&mdash;Priestley? Hemingway? Walpole? Wodehouse?
No, Ethel M. Dell, with Warwick Deeping a good second and Jeffrey
Farnol, I should say, third. Dell's novels, of course, are read
solely by women, but by women of all kinds and ages and not, as one
might expect, merely by wistful spinsters and the fat wives of
tobacconists. It is not true that men don't read novels, but it is
true that there are whole branches of fiction that they avoid.
Roughly speaking, what one might call the <i>average</i>
novel&mdash;the ordinary, good-bad, Galsworthy-and-water stuff
which is the norm of the English novel&mdash;seems to exist only
for women. Men read either the novels it is possible to respect, or
detective stories. But their consumption of detective stories is
terrific. One of our subscribers to my knowledge read four or five
detective stories every week for over a year, besides others which
he got from another library. What chiefly surprised me was that he
never read the same book twice. Apparently the whole of that
frightful torrent of trash (the pages read every year would, I
calculated, cover nearly three quarters of an acre) was stored for
ever in his memory. He took no notice of titles or author's names,
but he could tell by merely glancing into a book whether be had
'had it already'.</p>

<p>In a lending library you see people's real tastes, not their
pretended ones, and one thing that strikes you is how completely
the 'classical' English novelists have dropped out of favour. It is
simply useless to put Dickens, Thackeray, Jane Austen, Trollope,
etc. into the ordinary lending library; nobody takes them out. At
the mere sight of a nineteenth-century novel people say, 'Oh, but
that's <i>old!</i>' and shy away immediately. Yet it is always
fairly easy to <i>sell</i> Dickens, just as it is always easy to
sell Shakespeare. Dickens is one of those authors whom people are
'always meaning to' read, and, like the Bible, he is widely known
at second hand. People know by hearsay that Bill Sikes was a
burglar and that Mr Micawber had a bald head, just as they know by
hearsay that Moses was found in a basket of bulrushes and saw the
'back parts' of the Lord. Another thing that is very noticeable is
the growing unpopularity of American books. And another&mdash;the
publishers get into a stew about this every two or three
years&mdash;is the unpopularity of short stories. The kind of
person who asks the librarian to choose a book for him nearly
always starts by saying 'I don't want short stories', or 'I do not
desire little stories', as a German customer of ours used to put
it. If you ask them why, they sometimes explain that it is too much
fag to get used to a new set of characters with every story; they
like to 'get into' a novel which demands no further thought after
the first chapter. I believe, though, that the writers are more to
blame here than the readers. Most modern short stories, English and
American, are utterly lifeless and worthless, far more so than most
novels. The short stories which are stories are popular enough,
<i>vide</i> D. H. Lawrence, whose short stories are as popular as
his novels.</p>

<p>Would I like to be a bookseller <i>de métier</i>? On the
whole&mdash;in spite of my employer's kindness to me, and some
happy days I spent in the shop&mdash;no.</p>

<p>Given a good pitch and the right amount of capital, any educated
person ought to be able to make a small secure living out of a
bookshop. Unless one goes in for 'rare' books it is not a difficult
trade to learn, and you start at a great advantage if you know
anything about the insides of books. (Most booksellers don't. You
can get their measure by having a look at the trade papers where
they advertise their wants. If you don't see an ad. for Boswell's
<i>Decline and Fall</i> you are pretty sure to see one for <i>The
Mill on the Floss</i> by T. S. Eliot.) Also it is a humane trade
which is not capable of being vulgarized beyond a certain point.
The combines can never squeeze the small independent bookseller out
of existence as they have squeezed the grocer and the milkman. But
the hours of work are very long&mdash;I was only a part-time
employee, but my employer put in a seventy-hour week, apart from
constant expeditions out of hours to buy books&mdash;and it is an
unhealthy life. As a rule a bookshop is horribly cold in winter,
because if it is too warm the windows get misted over, and a
bookseller lives on his windows. And books give off more and
nastier dust than any other class of objects yet invented, and the
top of a book is the place where every bluebottle prefers to
die.</p>

<p>But the real reason why I should not like to be in the book
trade for life is that while I was in it I lost my love of books. A
bookseller has to tell lies about books, and that gives him a
distaste for them; still worse is the fact that he is constantly
dusting them and hauling them to and fro. There was a time when I
really did love books&mdash;loved the sight and smell and feel of
them, I mean, at least if they were fifty or more years old.
Nothing pleased me quite so much as to buy a job lot of them for a
shilling at a country auction. There is a peculiar flavour about
the battered unexpected books you pick up in that kind of
collection: minor eighteenth-century poets, out-of-date gazeteers,
odd volumes of forgotten novels, bound numbers of ladies' magazines
of the sixties. For casual reading&mdash;in your bath, for
instance, or late at night when you are too tired to go to bed, or
in the odd quarter of an hour before lunch&mdash;there is nothing
to touch a back number of the Girl's Own Paper. But as soon as I
went to work in the bookshop I stopped buying books. Seen in the
mass, five or ten thousand at a time, books were boring and even
slightly sickening. Nowadays I do buy one occasionally, but only if
it is a book that I want to read and can't borrow, and I never buy
junk. The sweet smell of decaying paper appeals to me no longer. It
is too closely associated in my mind with paranoiac customers and
dead bluebottles.</p>

<h2>SHOOTING AN ELEPHANT (1936)</h2>

<p>In Moulmein, in lower Burma, I was hated by large numbers of
people&mdash;the only time in my life that I have been important
enough for this to happen to me. I was sub-divisional police
officer of the town, and in an aimless, petty kind of way
anti-European feeling was very bitter. No one had the guts to raise
a riot, but if a European woman went through the bazaars alone
somebody would probably spit betel juice over her dress. As a
police officer I was an obvious target and was baited whenever it
seemed safe to do so. When a nimble Burman tripped me up on the
football field and the referee (another Burman) looked the other
way, the crowd yelled with hideous laughter. This happened more
than once. In the end the sneering yellow faces of young men that
met me everywhere, the insults hooted after me when I was at a safe
distance, got badly on my nerves. The young Buddhist priests were
the worst of all. There were several thousands of them in the town
and none of them seemed to have anything to do except stand on
street corners and jeer at Europeans.</p>

<p>All this was perplexing and upsetting. For at that time I had
already made up my mind that imperialism was an evil thing and the
sooner I chucked up my job and got out of it the better.
Theoretically&mdash;and secretly, of course&mdash;I was all for the
Burmese and all against their oppressors, the British. As for the
job I was doing, I hated it more bitterly than I can perhaps make
clear. In a job like that you see the dirty work of Empire at close
quarters. The wretched prisoners huddling in the stinking cages of
the lock-ups, the grey, cowed faces of the long-term convicts, the
scarred buttocks of the men who had been Bogged with
bamboos&mdash;all these oppressed me with an intolerable sense of
guilt. But I could get nothing into perspective. I was young and
ill-educated and I had had to think out my problems in the utter
silence that is imposed on every Englishman in the East. I did not
even know that the British Empire is dying, still less did I know
that it is a great deal better than the younger empires that are
going to supplant it. All I knew was that I was stuck between my
hatred of the empire I served and my rage against the evil-spirited
little beasts who tried to make my job impossible. With one part of
my mind I thought of the British Raj as an unbreakable tyranny, as
something clamped down, <i>in saecula saeculorum</i>, upon the will
of prostrate peoples; with another part I thought that the greatest
joy in the world would be to drive a bayonet into a Buddhist
priest's guts. Feelings like these are the normal by-products of
imperialism; ask any Anglo-Indian official, if you can catch him
off duty.</p>

<p>One day something happened which in a roundabout way was
enlightening. It was a tiny incident in itself, but it gave me a
better glimpse than I had had before of the real nature of
imperialism&mdash;the real motives for which despotic governments
act. Early one morning the sub-inspector at a police station the
other end of the town rang me up on the phone and said that an
elephant was ravaging the bazaar. Would I please come and do
something about it? I did not know what I could do, but I wanted to
see what was happening and I got on to a pony and started out. I
took my rifle, an old .44 Winchester and much too small to kill an
elephant, but I thought the noise might be useful <i>in
terrorem</i>. Various Burmans stopped me on the way and told me
about the elephant's doings. It was not, of course, a wild
elephant, but a tame one which had gone "must." It had been chained
up, as tame elephants always are when their attack of "must" is
due, but on the previous night it had broken its chain and escaped.
Its mahout, the only person who could manage it when it was in that
state, had set out in pursuit, but had taken the wrong direction
and was now twelve hours' journey away, and in the morning the
elephant had suddenly reappeared in the town. The Burmese
population had no weapons and were quite helpless against it. It
had already destroyed somebody's bamboo hut, killed a cow and
raided some fruit-stalls and devoured the stock; also it had met
the municipal rubbish van and, when the driver jumped out and took
to his heels, had turned the van over and inflicted violences upon
it.</p>

<p>The Burmese sub-inspector and some Indian constables were
waiting for me in the quarter where the elephant had been seen. It
was a very poor quarter, a labyrinth of squalid bamboo huts,
thatched with palm-leaf, winding all over a steep hillside. I
remember that it was a cloudy, stuffy morning at the beginning of
the rains. We began questioning the people as to where the elephant
had gone and, as usual, failed to get any definite information.
That is invariably the case in the East; a story always sounds
clear enough at a distance, but the nearer you get to the scene of
events the vaguer it becomes. Some of the people said that the
elephant had gone in one direction, some said that he had gone in
another, some professed not even to have heard of any elephant. I
had almost made up my mind that the whole story was a pack of lies,
when we heard yells a little distance away. There was a loud,
scandalized cry of "Go away, child! Go away this instant!" and an
old woman with a switch in her hand came round the corner of a hut,
violently shooing away a crowd of naked children. Some more women
followed, clicking their tongues and exclaiming; evidently there
was something that the children ought not to have seen. I rounded
the hut and saw a man's dead body sprawling in the mud. He was an
Indian, a black Dravidian coolie, almost naked, and he could not
have been dead many minutes. The people said that the elephant had
come suddenly upon him round the corner of the hut, caught him with
its trunk, put its foot on his back and ground him into the earth.
This was the rainy season and the ground was soft, and his face had
scored a trench a foot deep and a couple of yards long. He was
lying on his belly with arms crucified and head sharply twisted to
one side. His face was coated with mud, the eyes wide open, the
teeth bared and grinning with an expression of unendurable agony.
(Never tell me, by the way, that the dead look peaceful. Most of
the corpses I have seen looked devilish.) The friction of the great
beast's foot had stripped the skin from his back as neatly as one
skins a rabbit. As soon as I saw the dead man I sent an orderly to
a friend's house nearby to borrow an elephant rifle. I had already
sent back the pony, not wanting it to go mad with fright and throw
me if it smelt the elephant.</p>

<p>The orderly came back in a few minutes with a rifle and five
cartridges, and meanwhile some Burmans had arrived and told us that
the elephant was in the paddy fields below, only a few hundred
yards away. As I started forward practically the whole population
of the quarter flocked out of the houses and followed me. They had
seen the rifle and were all shouting excitedly that I was going to
shoot the elephant. They had not shown much interest in the
elephant when he was merely ravaging their homes, but it was
different now that he was going to be shot. It was a bit of fun to
them, as it would be to an English crowd; besides they wanted the
meat. It made me vaguely uneasy. I had no intention of shooting the
elephant&mdash;I had merely sent for the rifle to defend myself if
necessary&mdash;and it is always unnerving to have a crowd
following you. I marched down the hill, looking and feeling a fool,
with the rifle over my shoulder and an ever-growing army of people
jostling at my heels. At the bottom, when you got away from the
huts, there was a metalled road and beyond that a miry waste of
paddy fields a thousand yards across, not yet ploughed but soggy
from the first rains and dotted with coarse grass. The elephant was
standing eight yards from the road, his left side towards us. He
took not the slightest notice of the crowd's approach. He was
tearing up bunches of grass, beating them against his knees to
clean them and stuffing them into his mouth.</p>

<p>I had halted on the road. As soon as I saw the elephant I knew
with perfect certainty that I ought not to shoot him. It is a
serious matter to shoot a working elephant&mdash;it is comparable
to destroying a huge and costly piece of machinery&mdash;and
obviously one ought not to do it if it can possibly be avoided. And
at that distance, peacefully eating, the elephant looked no more
dangerous than a cow. I thought then and I think now that his
attack of "must" was already passing off; in which case he would
merely wander harmlessly about until the mahout came back and
caught him. Moreover, I did not in the least want to shoot him. I
decided that I would watch him for a little while to make sure that
he did not turn savage again, and then go home.</p>

<p>But at that moment I glanced round at the crowd that had
followed me. It was an immense crowd, two thousand at the least and
growing every minute. It blocked the road for a long distance on
either side. I looked at the sea of yellow faces above the garish
clothes-faces all happy and excited over this bit of fun, all
certain that the elephant was going to be shot. They were watching
me as they would watch a conjurer about to perform a trick. They
did not like me, but with the magical rifle in my hands I was
momentarily worth watching. And suddenly I realized that I should
have to shoot the elephant after all. The people expected it of me
and I had got to do it; I could feel their two thousand wills
pressing me forward, irresistibly. And it was at this moment, as I
stood there with the rifle in my hands, that I first grasped the
hollowness, the futility of the white man's dominion in the East.
Here was I, the white man with his gun, standing in front of the
unarmed native crowd&mdash;seemingly the leading actor of the
piece; but in reality I was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro
by the will of those yellow faces behind. I perceived in this
moment that when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom
that he destroys. He becomes a sort of hollow, posing dummy, the
conventionalized figure of a sahib. For it is the condition of his
rule that he shall spend his life in trying to impress the
"natives," and so in every crisis he has got to do what the
"natives" expect of him. He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit
it. I had got to shoot the elephant. I had committed myself to
doing it when I sent for the rifle. A sahib has got to act like a
sahib; he has got to appear resolute, to know his own mind and do
definite things. To come all that way, rifle in hand, with two
thousand people marching at my heels, and then to trail feebly
away, having done nothing&mdash;no, that was impossible. The crowd
would laugh at me. And my whole life, every white man's life in the
East, was one long struggle not to be laughed at.</p>

<p>But I did not want to shoot the elephant. I watched him beating
his bunch of grass against his knees, with that preoccupied
grandmotherly air that elephants have. It seemed to me that it
would be murder to shoot him. At that age I was not squeamish about
killing animals, but I had never shot an elephant and never wanted
to. (Somehow it always seems worse to kill a <i>large</i> animal.)
Besides, there was the beast's owner to be considered. Alive, the
elephant was worth at least a hundred pounds; dead, he would only
be worth the value of his tusks, five pounds, possibly. But I had
got to act quickly. I turned to some experienced-looking Burmans
who had been there when we arrived, and asked them how the elephant
had been behaving. They all said the same thing: he took no notice
of you if you left him alone, but he might charge if you went too
close to him.</p>

<p>It was perfectly clear to me what I ought to do. I ought to walk
up to within, say, twenty-five yards of the elephant and test his
behavior. If he charged, I could shoot; if he took no notice of me,
it would be safe to leave him until the mahout came back. But also
I knew that I was going to do no such thing. I was a poor shot with
a rifle and the ground was soft mud into which one would sink at
every step. If the elephant charged and I missed him, I should have
about as much chance as a toad under a steam-roller. But even then
I was not thinking particularly of my own skin, only of the
watchful yellow faces behind. For at that moment, with the crowd
watching me, I was not afraid in the ordinary sense, as I would
have been if I had been alone. A white man mustn't be frightened in
front of "natives"; and so, in general, he isn't frightened. The
sole thought in my mind was that if anything went wrong those two
thousand Burmans would see me pursued, caught, trampled on and
reduced to a grinning corpse like that Indian up the hill. And if
that happened it was quite probable that some of them would laugh.
That would never do.</p>

<p>There was only one alternative. I shoved the cartridges into the
magazine and lay down on the road to get a better aim. The crowd
grew very still, and a deep, low, happy sigh, as of people who see
the theatre curtain go up at last, breathed from innumerable
throats. They were going to have their bit of fun after all. The
rifle was a beautiful German thing with cross-hair sights. I did
not then know that in shooting an elephant one would shoot to cut
an imaginary bar running from ear-hole to ear-hole. I ought,
therefore, as the elephant was sideways on, to have aimed straight
at his ear-hole, actually I aimed several inches in front of this,
thinking the brain would be further forward.</p>

<p>When I pulled the trigger I did not hear the bang or feel the
kick&mdash;one never does when a shot goes home&mdash;but I heard
the devilish roar of glee that went up from the crowd. In that
instant, in too short a time, one would have thought, even for the
bullet to get there, a mysterious, terrible change had come over
the elephant. He neither stirred nor fell, but every line of his
body had altered. He looked suddenly stricken, shrunken, immensely
old, as though the frightful impact of the bullet had paralysed him
without knocking him down. At last, after what seemed a long
time&mdash;it might have been five seconds, I dare say&mdash;he
sagged flabbily to his knees. His mouth slobbered. An enormous
senility seemed to have settled upon him. One could have imagined
him thousands of years old. I fired again into the same spot. At
the second shot he did not collapse but climbed with desperate
slowness to his feet and stood weakly upright, with legs sagging
and head drooping. I fired a third time. That was the shot that did
for him. You could see the agony of it jolt his whole body and
knock the last remnant of strength from his legs. But in falling he
seemed for a moment to rise, for as his hind legs collapsed beneath
him he seemed to tower upward like a huge rock toppling, his trunk
reaching skyward like a tree. He trumpeted, for the first and only
time. And then down he came, his belly towards me, with a crash
that seemed to shake the ground even where I lay.</p>

<p>I got up. The Burmans were already racing past me across the
mud. It was obvious that the elephant would never rise again, but
he was not dead. He was breathing very rhythmically with long
rattling gasps, his great mound of a side painfully rising and
falling. His mouth was wide open&mdash;I could see far down into
caverns of pale pink throat. I waited a long time for him to die,
but his breathing did not weaken. Finally I fired my two remaining
shots into the spot where I thought his heart must be. The thick
blood welled out of him like red velvet, but still he did not die.
His body did not even jerk when the shots hit him, the tortured
breathing continued without a pause. He was dying, very slowly and
in great agony, but in some world remote from me where not even a
bullet could damage him further. I felt that I had got to put an
end to that dreadful noise. It seemed dreadful to see the great
beast Lying there, powerless to move and yet powerless to die, and
not even to be able to finish him. I sent back for my small rifle
and poured shot after shot into his heart and down his throat. They
seemed to make no impression. The tortured gasps continued as
steadily as the ticking of a clock.</p>

<p>In the end I could not stand it any longer and went away. I
heard later that it took him half an hour to die. Burmans were
bringing dahs and baskets even before I left, and I was told they
had stripped his body almost to the bones by the afternoon.</p>

<p>Afterwards, of course, there were endless discussions about the
shooting of the elephant. The owner was furious, but he was only an
Indian and could do nothing. Besides, legally I had done the right
thing, for a mad elephant has to be killed, like a mad dog, if its
owner fails to control it. Among the Europeans opinion was divided.
The older men said I was right, the younger men said it was a damn
shame to shoot an elephant for killing a coolie, because an
elephant was worth more than any damn Coringhee coolie. And
afterwards I was very glad that the coolie had been killed; it put
me legally in the right and it gave me a sufficient pretext for
shooting the elephant. I often wondered whether any of the others
grasped that I had done it solely to avoid looking a fool.</p>

<h2>DOWN THE MINE (1937) (FROM "THE ROAD TO WIGAN PIER")</h2>

<p>Our civilization, pace Chesterton, is founded on coal, more
completely than one realizes until one stops to think about it. The
machines that keep us alive, and the machines that make machines,
are all directly or indirectly dependent upon coal. In the
metabolism of the Western world the coal-miner is second in
importance only to the man who ploughs the soil. He is a sort of
caryatid upon whose shoulders nearly everything that is not grimy
is supported. For this reason the actual process by which coal is
extracted is well worth watching, if you get the chance and are
willing to take the trouble.</p>

<p>When you go down a coal-mine it is important to try and get to
the coal face when the 'fillers' are at work. This is not easy,
because when the mine is working visitors are a nuisance and are
not encouraged, but if you go at any other time, it is possible to
come away with a totally wrong impression. On a Sunday, for
instance, a mine seems almost peaceful. The time to go there is
when the machines are roaring and the air is black with coal dust,
and when you can actually see what the miners have to do. At those
times the place is like hell, or at any rate like my own mental
picture of hell. Most of the things one imagines in hell are if
there&mdash;heat, noise, confusion, darkness, foul air, and, above
all, unbearably cramped space. Everything except the fire, for
there is no fire down there except the feeble beams of Davy lamps
and electric torches which scarcely penetrate the clouds of coal
dust.</p>

<p>When you have finally got there&mdash;and getting there is a in
itself: I will explain that in a moment&mdash;you crawl through the
last line of pit props and see opposite you a shiny black wall
three or four feet high. This is the coal face. Overhead is the
smooth ceiling made by the rock from which the coal has been cut;
underneath is the rock again, so that the gallery you are in is
only as high as the ledge of coal itself, probably not much more
than a yard. The first impression of all, overmastering everything
else for a while, is the frightful, deafening din from the conveyor
belt which carries the coal away. You cannot see very far, because
the fog of coal dust throws back the beam of your lamp, but you can
see on either side of you the line of half-naked kneeling men, one
to every four or five yards, driving their shovels under the fallen
coal and flinging it swiftly over their left shoulders. They are
feeding it on to the conveyor belt, a moving rubber, belt a couple
of feet wide which runs a yard or two behind them. Down this belt a
glittering river of coal races constantly. In a big mine it is
carrying away several tons of coal every minute. It bears it off to
some place in the main roads where it is shot into tubs holding
half a tun, and thence dragged to the cages and hoisted to the
outer air.</p>

<p>It is impossible to watch the 'fillers' at work without feeling
a pang of envy for their toughness. It is a dreadful job that they
do, an almost superhuman job by the standard of an ordinary person.
For they are not only shifting monstrous quantities of coal, they
are also doing, it in a position that doubles or trebles the work.
They have got to remain kneeling all the while&mdash;they could
hardly rise from their knees without hitting the ceiling&mdash;and
you can easily see by trying it what a tremendous effort this
means. Shovelling is comparatively easy when you are standing up,
because you can use your knee and thigh to drive the shovel along;
kneeling down, the whole of the strain is thrown upon your arm and
belly muscles. And the other conditions do not exactly make things
easier. There is the heat&mdash;it varies, but in some mines it is
suffocating&mdash;and the coal dust that stuffs up your throat and
nostrils and collects along your eyelids, and the unending rattle
of the conveyor belt, which in that confined space is rather like
the rattle of a machine gun. But the fillers look and work as
though they were made of iron. They really do look like iron
hammered iron statues&mdash;under the smooth coat of coal dust
which clings to them from head to foot. It is only when you see
miners down the mine and naked that you realize what splendid men,
they are. Most of them are small (big men are at a disadvantage in
that job) but nearly all of them have the most noble bodies; wide
shoulders tapering to slender supple waists, and small pronounced
buttocks and sinewy thighs, with not an ounce of waste flesh
anywhere. In the hotter mines they wear only a pair of thin
drawers, clogs and knee-pads; in the hottest mines of all, only the
clogs and knee-pads. You can hardly tell by the look of them
whether they are young or old. They may be any age up to sixty or
even sixty-five, but when they are black and naked they all look
alike. No one could do their work who had not a young man's body,
and a figure fit for a guardsman at that, just a few pounds of
extra flesh on the waist-line, and the constant bending would be
impossible. You can never forget that spectacle once you have seen
it&mdash;the line of bowed, kneeling figures, sooty black all over,
driving their, huge shovels under the coal with stupendous force
and speed. They are on the job for seven and a half hours,
theoretically without a break, for there is no time 'off'. Actually
they, snatch a quarter of an hour or so at some time during the
shift to eat the food they have brought with them, usually a hunk
of bread and dripping and a bottle of cold tea. The first time I
was watching the 'fillers' at work I put my hand upon some dreadful
slimy thing among the coal dust. It was a chewed quid of tobacco.
Nearly all the miners chew tobacco, which is said to be good
against thirst.</p>

<p>Probably you have to go down several coal-mines before you can
get much grasp of the processes that are going on round you. This
is chiefly because the mere effort of getting from place to place;
makes it difficult to notice anything else, In some ways it is even
disappointing, or at least is unlike what you have, expected. You
get into the cage, which is a steel box about as wide as a
telephone box and two or three times as long. It holds ten men, but
they pack it like pilchards in a tin, and a tall man cannot stand
upright in it. The steel door shuts upon you, and somebody working
the winding gear above drops you into the void. You have the usual
momentary qualm in your belly and a bursting sensation in the cars,
but not much sensation of movement till you get near the bottom,
when the cage slows down so abruptly that you could swear it is
going upwards again. In the middle of the run the cage probably
touches sixty miles an hour; in some of the deeper mines it touches
even more. When you crawl out at the bottom you are perhaps four
hundred yards underground. That is to say you have a
tolerable-sized mountain on top of you; hundreds of yards of solid
rock, bones of extinct beasts, subsoil, flints, roots of growing
things, green grass and cows grazing on it&mdash;all this suspended
over your head and held back only by wooden props as thick as the
calf of your leg. But because of the speed at which the cage has
brought you down, and the complete blackness through which you have
travelled, you hardly feel yourself deeper down than you would at
the bottom of the Piccadilly tube.</p>

<p>What is surprising, on the other hand, is the immense horizontal
distances that have to be travelled underground. Before I had been
down a mine I had vaguely imagined the miner stepping out of the
cage and getting to work on a ledge of coal a few yards away. I had
not realized that before he even gets to work he may have had to
creep along passages as long as from London Bridge to Oxford
Circus. In the beginning, of course, a mine shaft is sunk somewhere
near a seam of coal; But as that seam is worked out and fresh seams
are followed up, the workings get further and further from the pit
bottom. If it is a mile from the pit bottom to the coal face, that
is probably an average distance; three miles is a fairly normal
one; there are even said to be a few mines where it is as much as
five miles. But these distances bear no relation to distances above
ground. For in all that mile or three miles as it may be, there is
hardly anywhere outside the main road, and not many places even
there, where a man can stand upright.</p>

<p>You do not notice the effect of this till you have gone a few
hundred yards. You start off, stooping slightly, down the dim-lit
gallery, eight or ten feet wide and about five high, with the walls
built up with slabs of shale, like the stone walls in Derbyshire.
Every yard or two there are wooden props holding up the beams and
girders; some of the girders have buckled into fantastic curves
under which you have to duck. Usually it is bad going
underfoot&mdash;thick dust or jagged chunks of shale, and in some
mines where there is water it is as mucky as a farm-yard. Also
there is the track for the coal tubs, like a miniature railway
track with sleepers a foot or two apart, which is tiresome to walk
on. Everything is grey with shale dust; there is a dusty fiery
smell which seems to be the same in all mines. You see mysterious
machines of which you never learn the purpose, and bundles of tools
slung together on wires, and sometimes mice darting away from the
beam of the lamps. They are surprisingly common, especially in
mines where there are or have been horses. It would be interesting
to know how they got there in the first place; possibly by falling
down the shaft&mdash;for they say a mouse can fall any distance
uninjured, owing to its surface area being so large relative to its
weight. You press yourself against the wall to make way for lines
of tubs jolting slowly towards the shaft, drawn by an endless steel
cable operated from the surface. You creep through sacking curtains
and thick wooden doors which, when they are opened, let out fierce
blasts of air. These doors are an important part of the ventilation
system. The exhausted air is sucked out of one shaft by means of
fans, and the fresh air enters the other of its own accord. But if
left to itself the air will take the shortest way round, leaving
the deeper workings unventilated; so all the short cuts have to be
partitioned off.</p>

<p>At the start to walk stooping is rather a joke, but it is a joke
that soon wears off. I am handicapped by being exceptionally tall,
but when the roof falls to four feet or less it is a tough job for
anybody except a dwarf or a child. You not only have to bend
double, you have also got to keep your head up all the while so as
to see the beams and girders and dodge them when they come. You
have, therefore, a constant crick in the neck, but this is nothing
to the pain in your knees and thighs. After half a mile it becomes
(I am not exaggerating) an unbearable agony. You begin to wonder
whether you will ever get to the end&mdash;still more, how on earth
you are going to get back. Your pace grows slower and slower. You
come to a stretch of a couple of hundred yards where it is all
exceptionally low and you have to work yourself along in a
squatting position. Then suddenly the roof opens out to a
mysterious height&mdash;scene of and old fall of rock,
probably&mdash;and for twenty whole yards you can stand upright.
The relief is overwhelming. But after this there is another low
stretch of a hundred yards and then a succession of beams which you
have to crawl under. You go down on all fours; even this is a
relief after the squatting business. But when you come to the end
of the beams and try to get up again, you find that your knees have
temporarily struck work and refuse to lift you. You call a halt,
ignominiously, and say that you would like to rest for a minute or
two. Your guide (a miner) is sympathetic. He knows that your
muscles are not the same as his. 'Only another four hundred yards,'
he says encouragingly; you feel that he might as well say another
four hundred miles. But finally you do somehow creep as far as the
coal face. You have gone a mile and taken the best part of an hour;
a miner would do it in not much more than twenty minutes. Having
got there, you have to sprawl in the coal dust and get your
strength back for several minutes before you can even watch the
work in progress with any kind of intelligence.</p>

<p>Coming back is worse than going, not only because you are
already tired out but because the journey back to the shaft is
slightly uphill. You get through the low places at the speed of a
tortoise, and you have no shame now about calling a halt when your
knees give way. Even the lamp you are carrying becomes a nuisance
and probably when you stumble you drop it; whereupon, if it is a
Davy lamp, it goes out. Ducking the beams becomes more and more of
an effort, and sometimes you forget to duck. You try walking head
down as the miners do, and then you bang your backbone. Even the
miners bang their backbones fairly often. This is the reason why in
very hot mines, where it is necessary to go about half naked, most
of the miners have what they call 'buttons down the
back'&mdash;that is, a permanent scab on each vertebra. When the
track is down hill the miners sometimes fit their clogs, which are
hollow under-neath, on to the trolley rails and slide down. In
mines where the 'travelling' is very bad all the miners carry
sticks about two and a half feet long, hollowed out below the
handle. In normal places you keep your hand on top of the stick and
in the low places you slide your hand down into the hollow. These
sticks are a great help, and the wooden crash-helmets&mdash;a
comparatively recent invention&mdash;are a godsend. They look like
a French or Italian steel helmet, but they are made of some kind of
pith and very light, and so strong, that you can take a violent
blow on the head without feeling it. When finally you get back to
the surface you have been perhaps three hours underground and
travelled two miles, and you, are more exhausted than you would be
by a twenty-five-mile walk above ground. For a week afterwards your
thighs are so stiff that coming downstairs is quite a difficult
feat; you have to work your way down in a peculiar sidelong manner,
without bending the knees. Your miner friends notice the stiffness
of your walk and chaff you about it. ('How'd ta like to work down
pit, eh?' etc.) Yet even a miner who has been long away front
work&mdash;from illness, for instance&mdash;when he comes back to
the pit, suffers badly for the first few days.</p>

<p>It may seem that I am exaggerating, though no one who has been
down an old-fashioned pit (most of the pits in England are
old-fashioned) and actually gone as far as the coal face, is likely
to say so. But what I want to emphasize is this. Here is this
frightful business of crawling to and fro, which to any normal
person is a hard day's work in itself; and it is not part of the
miner's work at all, it is merely an extra, like the City man's
daily ride in the Tube. The miner does that journey to and fro, and
sandwiched in between there are seven and a half hours of savage
work. I have never travelled much more than a mile to the coal
face; but often it is three miles, in which case I and most people
other than coal-miners would never get there at all. This is the
kind of point that one is always liable to miss. When you think of
the coal-mine you think of depth, heat, darkness, blackened figures
hacking at walls of coal; you don't think, necessarily, of those
miles of creeping to and fro. There is the question of time, also.
A miner's working shift of seven and a half hours does not sound
very long, but one has got to add on to it at least an hour a day
for 'travelling', more often two hours and sometimes three. Of
course, the 'travelling' is not technically work and the miner is
not paid for it; but it is as like work as makes no difference. It
is easy to say that miners don't mind all this. Certainly, it is
not the same for them as it would be for you or me. They have done
it since childhood, they have the right muscles hardened, and they
can move to and fro underground with a startling and rather
horrible agility. A miner puts his head down and runs, with a long
swinging stride, through places where I can only stagger. At the
workings you see them on all fours, skipping round the pit props
almost like dogs. But it is quite a mistake to think that they
enjoy it. I have talked about this to scores of miners and they all
admit that the 'travelling' is hard work; in any case when you hear
them discussing a pit among themselves the 'travelling' is always
one of the things they discuss. It is said that a shift always
returns from work faster than it goes; nevertheless the miners all
say that it is the coming away after a hard day's work, that is
especially irksome. It is part of their work and they are equal to
it, but certainly it is an effort. It is comparable, perhaps, to
climbing a smallish mountain before and after your day's work.</p>

<p>When you have been down in two or three pits you begin to get
some grasp of the processes that are going on underground. (I ought
to say, by the way, that I know nothing whatever about the
technical side of mining: I am merely describing what I have seen.)
Coal lies in thin seams between enormous layers of rock, so that
essentially the process of getting it out is like scooping the
central layer from a Neapolitan ice. In the old days the miners
used to cut straight into the coal with pick and crowbar&mdash;a
very slow job because coal, when lying in its virgin state, is
almost as hard as rock. Nowadays the preliminary work is done by an
electrically-driven coal-cutter, which in principle is an immensely
tough and powerful band-saw, running horizontally instead of
vertically, with teeth a couple of inches long and half an inch or
an inch thick. It can move backwards or forwards on its own power,
and the men operating it can rotate it this way or that.
Incidentally it makes one of the most awful noises I have ever
heard, and sends forth clouds of coal dust which make it impossible
to see more than two to three feet and almost impossible to
breathe. The machine travels along the coal face cutting into the
base of the coal and undermining it to the depth of five feet or
five feet and a half; after this it is comparatively easy to
extract the coal to the depth to which it has been undermined.
Where it is 'difficult getting', however, it has also to be
loosened with explosives. A man with an electric drill, like a
rather small version of the drills used in street-mending, bores
holes at intervals in the coal, inserts blasting powder, plugs it
with clay, goes round the corner if there is one handy (he is
supposed to retire to twenty-five yards distance) and touches off
the charge with an electric current. This is not intended to bring
the coal out, only to loosen it. Occasionally, of course, the
charge is too powerful, and then it not only brings the coal out
but brings the roof down as well.</p>

<p>After the blasting has been done the 'fillers' can tumble the
coal out, break it up and shovel it on to the conveyor belt. It
comes out first in monstrous boulders which may weigh anything up
to twenty tons. The conveyor belt shoots it on to tubs, and the
tubs are shoved into the main road and hitched on to an endlessly
revolving steel cable which drags them to the cage. Then they are
hoisted, and at the surface the coal is sorted by being run over
screens, and if necessary is washed as well. As far as possible the
'dirt'&mdash;the shale, that is&mdash;is used for making the roads
below. All what cannot be used is sent to the surface and dumped;
hence the monstrous 'dirt-heaps', like hideous grey mountains,
which are the characteristic scenery of the coal areas. When the
coal has been extracted to the depth to which the machine has cut,
the coal face has advanced by five feet. Fresh props are put in to
hold up the newly exposed roof, and during the next shift the
conveyor belt is taken to pieces, moved five feet forward and
re-assembled. As far as possible the three operations of cutting,
blasting and extraction are done in three separate shifts, the
cutting in the afternoon, the blasting at night (there is a law,
not always kept, that forbids its being done when other men are
working near by), and the 'filling' in the morning shift, which
lasts from six in the morning until half past one.</p>

<p>Even when you watch the process of coal-extraction you probably
only watch it for a short time, and it is not until you begin
making a few calculations that you realize what a stupendous task
the 'fillers' are performing. Normally each o man has to clear a
space four or five yards wide. The cutter has undermined the coal
to the depth of five feet, so that if the seam of coal is three or
four feet high, each man has to cut out, break up and load on to
the belt something between seven and twelve cubic yards of coal.
This is to say, taking a cubic yard as weighing twenty-seven
hundred-weight, that each man is shifting coal at a speed
approaching two tons an hour. I have just enough experience of pick
and shovel work to be able to grasp what this means. When I am
digging trenches in my garden, if I shift two tons of earth during
the afternoon, I feel that I have earned my tea. But earth is
tractable stuff compared with coal, and I don't have to work
kneeling down, a thousand feet underground, in suffocating heat and
swallowing coal dust with every breath I take; nor do I have to
walk a mile bent double before I begin. The miner's job would be as
much beyond my power as it would be to perform on a flying trapeze
or to win the Grand National. I am not a manual labourer and please
God I never shall be one, but there are some kinds of manual work
that I could do if I had to. At a pitch I could be a tolerable
road-sweeper or an inefficient gardener or even a tenth-rate farm
hand. But by no conceivable amount of effort or training could I
become a coal-miner, the work would kill me in a few weeks.</p>

<p>Watching coal-miners at work, you realize momentarily what
different universes people inhabit. Down there where coal is dug is
a sort of world apart which one can quite easily go through life
without ever hearing about. Probably majority of people would even
prefer not to hear about it. Yet it is the absolutely necessary
counterpart of our world above. Practically everything we do, from
eating an ice to crossing the Atlantic, and from baking a loaf to
writing a novel, involves the use of coal, directly or indirectly.
For all the arts of peace coal is needed; if war breaks out it is
needed all the more. In time of revolution the miner must go on
working or the revolution must stop, for revolution as much as
reaction needs coal. Whatever may be happening on the surface, the
hacking and shovelling have got to continue without a pause, or at
any rate without pausing for more than a few weeks at the most. In
order that Hitler may march the goose-step, that the Pope may
denounce Bolshevism, that the cricket crowds may assemble at Lords,
that the poets may scratch one another's backs, coal has got to be
forthcoming. But on the whole we are not aware of it; we all know
that we 'must have coal', but we seldom or never remember what
coal-getting involves. Here am I sitting writing in front of my
comfortable coal fire. It is April but I still need a fire. Once a
fortnight the coal cart drives up to the door and men in leather
jerkins carry the coal indoors in stout sacks smelling of tar and
shoot it clanking into the coal-hole under the stairs. It is only
very rarely, when I make a definite mental-effort, that I connect
this coal with that far-off labour in the mines. It is just
'coal'&mdash;something that I have got to have; black stuff that
arrives mysteriously from nowhere in particular, like manna except
that you have to pay for it. You could quite easily drive a car
right across the north of England and never once remember that
hundreds of feet below the road you are on the miners are hacking
at the coal. Yet in a sense it is the miners who are driving your
car forward. Their lamp-lit world down there is as necessary to the
daylight world above as the root is to the flower.</p>

<p>It is not long since conditions in the mines were worse than
they are now. There are still living a few very old women who in
their youth have worked underground, with the harness round their
waists, and a chain that passed between their legs, crawling on all
fours and dragging tubs of coal. They used to go on doing this even
when they were pregnant. And even now, if coal could not be
produced without pregnant women dragging it to and fro, I fancy we
should let them do it rather than deprive ourselves of coal.
But-most of the time, of course, we should prefer to forget that
they were doing it. It is so with all types of manual work; it
keeps us alive, and we are oblivious of its existence. More than
anyone else, perhaps, the miner can stand as the type of the manual
worker, not only because his work is so exaggeratedly awful, but
also because it is so vitally necessary and yet so remote from our
experience, so invisible, as it were, that we are capable of
forgetting it as we forget the blood in our veins. In a way it is
even humiliating to watch coal-miners working. It raises in you a
momentary doubt about your own status as an 'intellectual' and a
superior person generally. For it is brought home to you, at least
while you are watching, that it is only because miners sweat their
guts out that superior persons can remain superior. You and I and
the editor of the Times Lit. Supp., and the poets and the
Archbishop of Canterbury and Comrade X, author of Marxism for
Infants&mdash;all of us really owe the comparative decency of our
lives to poor drudges underground, blackened to the eyes, with
their throats full of coal dust, driving their shovels forward with
arms and belly muscles of steel.</p>

<h2>NORTH AND SOUTH (FROM "THE ROAD TO WIGAN PIER") (1937)</h2>

<p>As you travel northward your eye, accustomed to the South or
East, does not notice much difference until you are beyond
Birmingham. In Coventry you might as well be in Finsbury Park, and
the Bull Ring in Birmingham is not unlike Norwich Market, and
between all the towns of the Midlands there stretches a
villa-civilization indistinguishable from that of the South. It is
only when you get a little further north, to the pottery towns and
beyond, that you begin to encounter the real ugliness of
industrialism&mdash;an ugliness so frightful and so arresting that
you are obliged, as it were, to come to terms with it.</p>

<p>A slag-heap is at best a hideous thing, because it is so
planless and functionless. It is something just dumped on the
earth, like the emptying of a giant's dust-bin. On the outskirts of
the mining towns there are frightful landscapes where your horizon
is ringed completely round by jagged grey mountains, and underfoot
is mud and ashes and over-head the steel cables where tubs of dirt
travel slowly across miles of country. Often the slag-heaps are on
fire, and at night you can see the red rivulets of fire winding
this way and that, and also the slow-moving blue flames of sulphur,
which always seem on the point of expiring and always spring out
again. Even when a slag-heap sinks, as it does ultimately, only an
evil brown grass grows on it, and it retains its hummocky surface.
One in the slums of Wigan, used as a playground, looks like a
choppy sea suddenly frozen; 'the flock mattress', it is called
locally. Even centuries hence when the plough drives over the
places where coal was once mined, the sites of ancient slag-heaps
will still be distinguishable from an aeroplane.</p>

<p>I remember a winter afternoon in the dreadful environs of Wigan.
All round was the lunar landscape of slag-heaps, and to the north,
through the passes, as it were, between the mountains of slag, you
could see the factory chimneys sending out their plumes of smoke.
The canal path was a mixture of cinders and frozen mud,
criss-crossed by the imprints of innumerable clogs, and all round,
as far as the slag-heaps in the distance, stretched the
'flashes'&mdash;pools of stagnant water that had seeped into the
hollows caused by the subsidence of ancient pits. It was horribly
cold. The 'flashes' were covered with ice the colour of raw umber,
the bargemen were muffled to the eyes in sacks, the lock gates wore
beards of ice. It seemed a world from which vegetation had been
banished; nothing existed except smoke, shale, ice, mud, ashes, and
foul water. But even Wigan is beautiful compared with Sheffield.
Sheffield, I suppose, could justly claim to be called the ugliest
town in the Old World: its inhabitants, who want it to be
pre-eminent in everything, very likely do make that claim for it.
It has a population of half a million and it contains fewer decent
buildings than the average East Anglian village of five hundred.
And the stench! If at rare moments you stop smelling sulphur it is
because you have begun smelling gas. Even the shallow river that
runs through the town is-usually bright yellow with some chemical
or other. Once I halted in the street and counted the factory
chimneys I could see; there were thirty-three of them, but there
would have been far more if the air had not been obscured by smoke.
One scene especially lingers in my mind. A frightful patch of waste
ground (somehow, up there, a patch of waste ground attains a
squalor that would be impossible even in London) trampled bare of
grass and littered with newspapers and old saucepans. To the right
an isolated row of gaunt four-roomed houses, dark red, blackened by
smoke. To the left an interminable vista of factory chimneys,
chimney beyond chimney, fading away into a dim blackish haze.
Behind me a railway embankment made of the slag from furnaces. In
front, across the patch of waste ground, a cubical building of red
and yellow brick, with the sign 'Thomas Grocock, Haulage
Contractor'.</p>

<p>At night, when you cannot see the hideous shapes of the houses
and the blackness of everything, a town like Sheffield assumes a
kind of sinister magnificence. Sometimes the drifts of smoke are
rosy with sulphur, and serrated flames, like circular saws, squeeze
themselves out from beneath the cowls of the foundry chimneys.
Through the open doors of foundries you see fiery serpents of iron
being hauled to and fro by redlit boys, and you hear the whizz and
thump of steam hammers and the scream of the iron under the blow.
The pottery towns are almost equally ugly in a pettier way. Right
in among the rows of tiny blackened houses, part of the street as
it were, are the 'pot banks'&mdash;conical brick chimneys like
gigantic burgundy bottles buried in the soil and belching their
smoke almost in your face. You come upon monstrous clay chasms
hundreds of feet across and almost as deep, with little rusty tubs
creeping on chain railways up one side, and on the other workmen
clinging like samphire-gatherers and cutting into the face of the
cliff with their picks. I passed that way in snowy weather, and
even the snow was black. The best thing one can say for the pottery
towns is that they are fairly small and stop abruptly. Less than
ten miles away you can stand in un-defiled country, on the almost
naked hills, and the pottery towns are only a smudge in the
distance.</p>

<p>When you contemplate such ugliness as this, there are two
questions that strike you. First, is it inevitable? Secondly, does
it matter?</p>

<p>I do not believe that there is anything inherently and
unavoidably ugly about industrialism. A factory or even a gasworks
is not obliged of its own nature to be ugly, any more than a palace
or a dog-kennel or a cathedral. It all depends on the architectural
tradition of the period. The industrial towns of the North are ugly
because they happen to have been built at a time when modern
methods of steel-construction and smoke-abatement were unknown, and
when everyone was too busy making money to think about anything
else. They go on being ugly largely because the Northerners have
got used to that kind of thing and do not notice it. Many of the
people in Sheffield or Manchester, if they smelled the air along
the Cornish cliffs, would probably declare that it had no taste in
it. But since the war, industry has tended to shift southward and
in doing so has grown almost comely. The typical post-war factory
is not a gaunt barrack or an awful chaos of blackness and belching
chimneys; it is a glittering white structure of concrete, glass,
and steel, surrounded by green lawns and beds of tulips. Look at
the factories you pass as you travel out of London on the G.W.R.;
they may not be aesthetic triumphs but certainly they are not ugly
in the same way as the Sheffield gasworks. But in any case, though
the ugliness of industrialism is the most obvious thing about it
and the thing every newcomer exclaims against, I doubt whether it
is centrally important. And perhaps it is not even desirable,
industrialism being what it is, that it should learn to disguise
itself as something else. As Mr Aldous Huxley has truly remarked, a
dark Satanic mill ought to look like a dark Satanic mill and not
like the temple of mysterious and splendid gods. Moreover, even in
the worst of the industrial towns one sees a great deal that is not
ugly in the narrow aesthetic sense. A belching chimney or a
stinking slum is repulsive chiefly because it implies warped lives
and ailing children. Look at it from a purely aesthetic standpoint
and it may, have a certain macabre appeal. I find that anything
outrageously strange generally ends by fascinating me even when I
abominate it. The landscapes of Burma, which, when I was among
them, so appalled me as to assume the qualities of nightmare,
afterwards stayed so hauntingly in my mind that I was obliged to
write a novel about them to get rid of them. (In all novels about
the East the scenery is the real subject-matter.) It would probably
be quite easy to extract a sort of beauty, as Arnold Bennett did,
from the blackness of the industrial towns; one can easily imagine
Baudelaire, for instance, writing a poem about a slag-heap. But the
beauty or ugliness of industrialism hardly matters. Its real evil
lies far deeper and is quite uneradicable. It is important to
remember this, because there is always a temptation to think that
industrialism is harmless so long as it is clean and orderly.</p>

<p>But when you go to the industrial North you are conscious, quite
apart from the unfamiliar scenery, of entering a strange country.
This is partly because of certain real differences which do exist,
but still more because of the North-South antithesis which has been
rubbed into us for such a long time past. There exists in England a
curious cult of Northernness, sort of Northern snobbishness. A
Yorkshireman in the South will always take care to let you know
that he regards you as an inferior. If you ask him why, he will
explain that it is only in the North that life is 'real' life, that
the industrial work done in the North is the only 'real' work, that
the North is inhabited by 'real' people, the South merely by
rentiers and their parasites. The Northerner has 'grit', he is
grim, 'dour', plucky, warm-hearted, and democratic; the Southerner
is snobbish, effeminate, and lazy&mdash;that at any rate is the
theory. Hence the Southerner goes north, at any rate for the first
time, with the vague inferiority-complex of a civilized man
venturing among savages, while the Yorkshireman, like the
Scotchman, comes to London in the spirit of a barbarian out for
loot. And feelings of this kind, which are the result of tradition,
are not affected by visible facts. Just as an Englishman five feet
four inches high and twenty-nine inches round the chest feels that
as an Englishman he is the physical superior of Camera (Camera
being a Dago), so also with the Northerner and the Southerner. I
remember a weedy little Yorkshireman, who would almost certainly
have run away if a fox-terrier had snapped at him, telling me that
in the South of England he felt 'like a wild invader'. But the cult
is often adopted by people who are not by birth Northerners
themselves. A year or two ago a friend of mine, brought up in the
South but now living in the North, was driving me through Suffolk
in a car. We passed through a rather beautiful village. He glanced
disapprovingly at the cottages and said:</p>

<p>'Of course most of the villages in Yorkshire are hideous; but
the Yorkshiremen are splendid chaps. Down here it's just the other
way about&mdash;beautiful villages and rotten people. All the
people in those cottages there are worthless, absolutely
worthless.'</p>

<p>I could not help inquiring whether he happened to know anybody
in that village. No, he did not know them; but because this was
East Anglia they were obviously worthless. Another friend of mine,
again a Southerner by birth, loses no opportunity of praising the
North to the detriment of the South. Here is an extract from one of
his letters to me:</p>

<p>I am in Clitheroe, Lanes...I think running water is much more
attractive in moor and mountain country than in the fat and
sluggish South. 'The smug and silver Trent,' Shakespeare says; and
the South&mdash;er the smugger, I say.</p>

<p>Here you have an interesting example of the Northern cult. Not
only are you and I and everyone else in the South of England
written off as 'fat and sluggish', but even water when it gets
north of a certain latitude, ceases to be H2O and becomes something
mystically superior. But the interest of this passage is that its
writer is an extremely intelligent man of 'advanced' opinions who
would have nothing but con-tempt for nationalism in its ordinary
form. Put to him some such proposition as 'One Britisher is worth
three foreigners', and he would repudiate it with horror. But when
it is a question of North versus South, he is quite ready to
generalize. All nationalistic distinctions&mdash;all claims to be
better than somebody else because you have a different-shaped skull
or speak a different dialect&mdash;are entirely spurious, but they
are important so long as people believe in them. There is no doubt
about the Englishman's inbred conviction that those who live to the
south of him are his inferiors; even our foreign policy is governed
by it to some extent. I think, therefore, that it is worth pointing
out when and why it came into being.</p>

<p>When nationalism first became a religion, the English looked at
the map, and, noticing that their island lay very high in the
Northern Hemisphere, evolved the pleasing theory that the further
north you live the more virtuous you become. The histories I was
given when I was a little boy generally started off by explaining
in the naivest way that a cold climate made people energetic while
a hot one made them lazy, and hence the defeat of the Spanish
Armada. This nonsense about the superior energy of the English
(actually the laziest people in Europe) has been current for at
least a hundred years. 'Better is it for us', writes a Quarterly
Reviewer of 1827, 'to be condemned to labour for our country's good
than to luxuriate amid olives, vines, and vices.' 'Olives, vines,
and vices' sums up the normal English attitude towards the Latin
races. In the mythology of Garlyle, Creasey, etc., the Northerner
('Teutonic', later 'Nordic') is pictured as a hefty, vigorous chap
with blond moustaches and pure morals, while the Southerner is sly,
cowardly, and licentious. This theory was never pushed to its
logical end, which would have meant assuming that the finest people
in the world were the Eskimos, but it did involve admitting that
the people who lived to the north of us were superior to ourselves.
Hence, partly, the cult of Scotland and of Scotch things which has
so deeply marked English life during the past fifty years. But it
was the industrialization of the North that gave the North-South
antithesis its peculiar slant. Until comparatively recently the
northern part of England was the backward and feudal part, and such
industry as existed was concentrated in London and the South-East.
In the Civil War for instance, roughly speaking a war of money
versus feudalism, the North and West were for the King and the
South and East for the Parliament. But with the increasing use of
coal industry passed to the North, and there grew up a new type of
man, the self-made Northern business man&mdash;the Mr Rouncewell
and Mr Bounderby of Dickens. The Northern business man, with his
hateful 'get on or get out' philosophy, was the dominant figure of
the nineteenth century, and as a sort of tyrannical corpse he rules
us still. This is the type edified by Arnold Bennett&mdash;the type
who starts off with half a crown and ends up with fifty thousand
pounds, and whose chief pride is to be an even greater boor after
he has made his money than before. On analysis his sole virtue
turns out to be a talent for making money. We were bidden to admire
him because though he might be narrow-minded, sordid, ignorant,
grasping, and uncouth, he had 'grit', he 'got on'; in other words,
he knew how to make money.</p>

<p>This kind of cant is nowadays a pure anachronism, for the
Northern business man is no longer prosperous. But traditions are
not killed by facts, and the tradition of Northern' grit' lingers.
It is still dimly felt that a Northerner will 'get on', i.e. make
money, where a Southerner will fail. At the back of the mind of
every Yorkshireman and every Scotchman who comes to London is a
sort of Dick Whittington picture of himself as the boy who starts
off by selling newspapers and ends up as Lord Mayor. And that,
really, is at the bottom of his bumptiousness. But where one can
make a great mistake is in imagining that this feeling extends to
the genuine working class. When I first went to Yorkshire, some
years ago, I imagined that I was going to a country of boors. I was
used to the London Yorkshireman with his interminable harangues and
his pride in the sup-posed raciness of his dialect (' "A stitch in
time saves nine", as we say in the West Riding'), and I expected to
meet with a good deal of rudeness. But I met with nothing of the
kind, and least of all among the miners. Indeed the Lancashire and
Yorkshire miners treated me with a kindness and courtesy that were
even embarrassing; for if there is one type of man to whom I do
feel myself inferior, it is a coal-miner. Certainly no one showed
any sign of despising me for coming from a different part of the
country. This has its importance when one remembers that the
English regional snobberies are nationalism in miniature; for it
suggests that place-snobbery is not a working-class
characteristic.</p>

<p>There is nevertheless a real difference between North and South,
and there is at least a tinge of truth in that picture of Southern
England as one enormous Brighton inhabited by lounge-lizards. For
climatic reasons the parasitic dividend-drawing class tend to
settle in the South. In a Lancashire cotton-town you could probably
go for months on end without once hearing an 'educated' accent,
whereas there can hardly be a town in the South of England where
you could throw a brick without hitting the niece of a bishop.
Consequently, with no petty gentry to set the pace, the
bourgeoisification of the working class, though it is taking place
in the North, is taking place more slowly. All the Northern
accents, for instance, persist strongly, while the Southern ones
are collapsing before the movies and the B.B.C. Hence your
'educated' accent stamps you rather as a foreigner than as a chunk
of the petty gentry; and this is an immense advantage, for it makes
it much easier to get into contact with the working class.</p>

<p>But is it ever possible to be really intimate with the working
class? I shall have to discuss that later; I will only say here
that I do not think it is possible. But undoubtedly it is easier in
the North than it would be in the South to meet working-class
people on approximately equal terms. It is fairly easy to live in a
miner's house and be accepted as one of the family; with, say, a
farm labourer in the Southern counties it probably would be
impossible. I have seen just enough of the working class to avoid
idealizing them, but I do know that you can learn a great deal in a
working-class home, if only you can get there. The essential point
is that your middle-class ideals and prejudices are tested by
contact with others which are not necessarily better but are
certainly different.</p>

<p>Take for instance the different attitude towards the family. A
working-class family hangs together as a middle-class one does, but
the relationship is far less tyrannical. A working man has not that
deadly weight of family prestige hanging round his neck like a
millstone. I have pointed out earlier that a middle-class person
goes utterly to pieces under the influence of poverty; and this is
generally due to the behaviour of his family&mdash;to the fact that
he has scores of relations nagging and badgering him night and day
for failing to 'get on'. The fact that the working class know how
to combine and the middle class don't is probably due to their
different conceptions of family loyalty. You cannot have an
effective trade union of middle-class workers, be-cause in times of
strikes almost every middle-class wife would be egging her husband
on to blackleg and get the other fellow's job. Another
working-class characteristic, disconcerting at first, is their
plain-spokenness towards anyone they regard as an equal. If you
offer a working man something he doesn't want, he tells you that he
doesn't want it; a middle-class person would accept it to avoid
giving offence. And again, take the working-class attitude towards
'education'. How different it is from ours, and how immensely
sounder! Working people often have a vague reverence for learning
in others, but where 'education' touches their own lives they see
through it and reject it by a healthy instinct. The time was when I
used to lament over quite imaginary pictures of lads of fourteen
dragged protesting from their lessons and set to work at dismal
jobs. It seemed to me dreadful that the doom of a 'job' should
descend upon anyone at fourteen. Of course I know now that there is
not one working-class boy in a thousand who does not pine for the
day when he will leave school. He wants to be doing real work, not
wasting his time on ridiculous rubbish like history and geography.
To the working class, the notion of staying at school till you are
nearly grown-up seems merely contemptible and unmanly. The idea of
a great big boy of eighteen, who ought to be bringing a pound a
week home to his parents, going to school in a ridiculous uniform
and even being caned for not doing his lessons! Just fancy a
working-class boy of eighteen allowing himself to be caned! He is a
man when the other is still a baby. Ernest Pontifex, in Samuel
Butler's Way of All Flesh, after he had had a few glimpses of real
life, looked back on his public school and university education and
found it a 'sickly, debilitating debauch'. There is much in
middle-class life that looks sickly and debilitating when you see
it from a working-class angle.</p>

<p>In a working-class home&mdash;I am not thinking at the moment of
the unemployed, but of comparatively prosperous homes&mdash;you
breathe a warm, decent, deeply human atmosphere which it is not so
easy to find elsewhere. I should say that a manual worker, if he is
in steady work and drawing good wages&mdash;an 'if which gets
bigger and bigger&mdash;has a better chance of being happy than an
'educated' man. His home life seems to fall more naturally into a
sane and comely shape. I have often been struck by the peculiar
easy completeness, the perfect symmetry as it were, of a
working-class interior at its best. Especially on winter evenings
after tea, when the fire glows in the open range and dances
mirrored in the steel fender, when Father, in shirt-sleeves, sits
in the rocking chair at one side of the fire reading the racing
finals, and Mother sits on the other with her sewing, and the
children are happy with a pennorth of mint humbugs, and the dog
lolls roasting himself on the rag mat&mdash;it is a good place to
be in, provided that you can be not only in it but sufficiently of
it to be taken for granted.</p>

<p>This scene is still reduplicated in a majority of English homes,
though not in so many as before the war. Its happiness depends
mainly upon one question&mdash;whether Father is in work. But
notice that the picture I have called up, of a working-class family
sitting round the coal fire after kippers and strong tea, belongs
only to our own moment of time and could not belong either to the
future or the past. Skip forward two hundred years into the Utopian
future, and the scene is totally different. Hardly one of the
things I have imagined will still be there. In that age when there
is no manual labour and everyone is 'educated', it is hardly likely
that Father will still be a rough man with enlarged hands who likes
to sit in shirt-sleeves and says 'Ah wur coomin' oop street'. And
there won't be a coal fire in the grate, only some kind of
invisible heater. The furniture will be made of rubber, glass, and
steel. If there are still such things as evening papers there will
certainly be no racing news in them, for gambling will be
meaningless in a world where there is no poverty and the horse will
have vanished from the face of the earth. Dogs, too, will have been
suppressed on grounds of hygiene. And there won't be so many
children, either, if the birth-controllers have their way. But move
backwards into the Middle Ages and you are in a world almost
equally foreign. A windowless hut, a wood fire which smokes in your
face because there is no chimney, mouldy bread, 'Poor John', lice,
scurvy, a yearly child-birth and a yearly child-death, and the
priest terrifying you with tales of Hell.</p>

<p>Curiously enough it is not the triumphs of modern engineering,
nor the radio, nor the cinematograph, nor the five thousand novels
which are published yearly, nor the crowds at Ascot and the Eton
and Harrow match, but the memory of working-class
interiors&mdash;especially as I sometimes saw them in my childhood
before the war, when England was still prosperous&mdash;that
reminds me that our age has not been altogether a bad one to live
in.</p>

<h2>SPILLING THE SPANISH BEANS (1937)</h2>

<p>The Spanish war has probably produced a richer crop of lies than
any event since the Great War of 1914-18, but I honestly doubt, in
spite of all those hecatombs of nuns who have been raped and
crucified before the eyes of <i>Daily Mail</i> reporters, whether
it is the pro-Fascist newspapers that have done the most harm. It
is the left-wing papers, the <i>News Chronicle</i> and the <i>Daily
Worker</i>, with their far subtler methods of distortion, that have
prevented the British public from grasping the real nature of the
struggle.</p>

<p>The fact which these papers have so carefully obscured is that
the Spanish Government (including the semi-autonomous Catalan
Government) is far more afraid of the revolution than of the
Fascists. It is now almost certain that the war will end with some
kind of compromise, and there is even reason to doubt whether the
Government, which let Bilbao fail without raising a finger, wishes
to be too victorious; but there is no doubt whatever about the
thoroughness with which it is crushing its own revolutionaries. For
some time past a reign of terror&mdash;forcible suppression of
political parties, a stifling censorship of the press, ceaseless
espionage and mass imprisonment without trial&mdash;has been in
progress. When I left Barcelona in late June the jails were
bulging; indeed, the regular jails had long since overflowed and
the prisoners were being huddled into empty shops and any other
temporary dump that could be found for them. But the point to
notice is that the people who are in prison now are not Fascists
but revolutionaries; they are there not because their opinions are
too much to the Right, but because they are too much to the Left.
And the people responsible for putting them there are those
dreadful revolutionaries at whose very name Garvin quakes in his
galoshes&mdash;the Communists.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the war against Franco continues, but, except for the
poor devils in the front-line trenches, nobody in Government Spain
thinks of it as the real war. The real struggle is between
revolution and counter-revolution; between the workers who are
vainly trying to hold on to a little of what they won in 1936, and
the Liberal-Communist bloc who are so successfully taking it away
from them. It is unfortunate that so few people in England have yet
caught up with the fact that Communism is now a
counter-revolutionary force; that Communists everywhere are in
alliance with bourgeois reformism and using the whole of their
powerful machinery to crush or discredit any party that shows signs
of revolutionary tendencies. Hence the grotesque spectacle of
Communists assailed as wicked 'Reds' by right-wing intellectuals
who are in essential agreement with them. Mr Wyndham Lewis, for
instance, ought to love the Communists, at least temporarily. In
Spain the Communist-Liberal alliance has been almost completely
victorious. Of all that the Spanish workers won for themselves in
1936 nothing solid remains, except for a few collective farms and a
certain amount of land seized by the peasants last year; and
presumably even the peasants will be sacrificed later, when there
is no longer any need to placate them. To see how the present
situation arose, one has got to look back to the origins of the
civil war.</p>

<p>Franco's bid for power differed from those of Hitler and
Mussolini in that it was a military insurrection, comparable to a
foreign invasion, and therefore had not much mass backing, though
Franco has since been trying to acquire one. Its chief supporters,
apart from certain sections of Big Business, were the land-owning
aristocracy and the huge, parasitic Church. Obviously a rising of
this kind will array against it various forces which are not in
agreement on any other point. The peasant and the worker hate
feudalism and clericalism; but so does the 'liberal' bourgeois, who
is not in the least opposed to a more modern version of Fascism, at
least so long as it isn't called Fascism. The 'liberal' bourgeois
is genuinely liberal up to the point where his own interests stop.
He stands for the degree of progress implied in the phrase 'la
carri&egrave;re ouverte aux talents'. For clearly he has no chance
to develop in a feudal society where the worker and the peasant are
too poor to buy goods, where industry is burdened with huge taxes
to pay for bishops' vestments, and where every lucrative job is
given as a matter of course to the friend of the catamite of the
duke's illegitimate son. Hence, in the face of such a blatant
reactionary as Franco, you get for a while a situation in which the
worker and the bourgeois, in reality deadly enemies, are fighting
side by side. This uneasy alliance is known as the Popular Front
(or, in the Communist press, to give it a spuriously democratic
appeal, People's Front). It is a combination with about as much
vitality, and about as much right to exist, as a pig with two heads
or some other Barnum and Bailey monstrosity.</p>

<p>In any serious emergency the contradiction implied in the
Popular Front is bound to make itself felt. For even when the
worker and the bourgeois are both fighting against Fascism, they
are not fighting for the same things; the bourgeois is fighting for
bourgeois democracy, i.e. capitalism, the worker, in so far as he
understands the issue, for Socialism. And in the early days of the
revolution the Spanish workers understood the issue very well. In
the areas where Fascism was defeated they did not content
themselves with driving the rebellious troops out of the towns;
they also took the opportunity of seizing land and factories and
setting up the rough beginnings of a workers' government by means
of local committees, workers' militias, police forces, and so
forth. They made the mistake, however (possibly because most of the
active revolutionaries were Anarchists with a mistrust of all
parliaments), of leaving the Republican Government in nominal
control. And, in spite of various changes in personnel, every
subsequent Government had been of approximately the same
bourgeois-reformist character. At the beginning this seemed not to
matter, because the Government, especially in Catalonia, was almost
powerless and the bourgeoisie had to lie low or even (this was
still happening when I reached Spain in December) to disguise
themselves as workers. Later, as power slipped from the hands of
the Anarchists into the hands of the Communists and right-wing
Socialists, the Government was able to reassert itself, the
bourgeoisie came out of hiding and the old division of society into
rich and poor reappeared, not much modified. Henceforward every
move, except a few dictated by military emergency, was directed
towards undoing the work of the first few months of revolution. Out
of the many illustrations I could choose, I will cite only one, the
breaking-up of the old workers' militias, which were organized on a
genuinely democratic system, with officers and men receiving the
same pay and mingling on terms of complete equality, and the
substitution of the Popular Army (once again, in Communist jargon,
'People's Army'), modelled as far as possible on an ordinary
bourgeois army, with a privileged officer-caste, immense
differences of pay, etc. etc. Needless to say, this is given out as
a military necessity, and almost certainly it does make for
military efficiency, at least for a short period. But the undoubted
purpose of the change was to strike a blow at equalitarianism. In
every department the same policy has been followed, with the result
that only a year after the outbreak of war and revolution you get
what is in effect an ordinary bourgeois State, with, in addition, a
reign of terror to preserve the status quo.</p>

<p>This process would probably have gone less far if the struggle
could have taken place without foreign interference. But the
military weakness of the Government made this impossible. In the
face of France's foreign mercenaries they were obliged to turn to
Russia for help, and though the quantity of arms sup&mdash;plied by
Russia has been greatly exaggerated (in my first three months in
Spain I saw only one Russian weapon, a solitary machine-gun), the
mere fact of their arrival brought the Communists into power. To
begin with, the Russian aeroplanes and guns, and the good military
qualities of the international Brigades (not necessarily Communist
but under Communist control), immensely raised the Communist
prestige. But, more important, since Russia and Mexico were the
only countries openly supplying arms, the Russians were able not
only to get money for their weapons, but to extort terms as well.
Put in their crudest form, the terms were: 'Crush the revolution or
you get no more arms.' The reason usually given for the Russian
attitude is that if Russia appeared to be abetting the revolution,
the Franco-Soviet pact (and the hoped-for alliance with Great
Britain) would be imperilled; it may be, also, that the spectacle
of a genuine revolution in Spain would rouse unwanted echoes in
Russia. The Communists, of course, deny that any direct pressure
has been exerted by the Russian Government. But this, even if true,
is hardly relevant, for the Communist Parties of all countries can
be taken as carrying out Russian policy; and it is certain that the
Spanish Communist Party, plus the right-wing Socialists whom they
control, plus the Communist press of the whole world, have used all
their immense and ever-increasing influence upon the side of
counter-revolution.</p>

<p>In the first half of this article I suggested that the real
struggle in Spain, on the Government side, has been between
revolution and counter-revolution; that the Government, though
anxious enough to avoid being beaten by Franco, has been even more
anxious to undo the revolutionary changes with which the outbreak
of war was accompanied.</p>

<p>Any Communist would reject this suggestion as mistaken or
wilfully dishonest. He would tell you that it is nonsense to talk
of the Spanish Government crushing the revolution, because the
revolution never happened; and that our job at present is to defeat
Fascism and defend democracy. And in this connexion it is most
important to see just how the Communist anti-revolutionary
propaganda works. It is a mistake to think that this has no
relevance in England, where the Communist Party is small and
comparatively weak. We shall see its relevance quickly enough if
England enters into an alliance with the U.S.S.R.; or perhaps even
earlier, for the influence of the Communist Party is bound to
increase&mdash;visibly is increasing&mdash;as more and more of the
capitalist class realize that latter-day Communism is playing their
game.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, Communist propaganda depends upon terrifying
people with the (quite real) horrors of Fascism. It also involves
pretending&mdash;not in so many words, but by
implication&mdash;that Fascism has nothing to do with capitalism.
Fascism is just a kind of meaningless wickedness, an aberration,
'mass sadism', the sort of thing that would happen if you suddenly
let loose an asylumful of homicidal maniacs. Present Fascism in
this form, and you can mobilize public opinion against it, at any
rate for a while, without provoking any revolutionary movement. You
can oppose Fascism by bourgeois 'democracy, meaning capitalism. But
meanwhile you have got to get rid of the troublesome person who
points out that Fascism and bourgeois 'democracy' are Tweedledum
and Tweedledee. You do it at the beginning by calling him an
impracticable visionary. You tell him that he is confusing the
issue, that he is splitting the anti-Fascist forces, that this is
not the moment for revolutionary phrase-mongering, that for the
moment we have got to fight against Fascism without inquiring too
closely what we are fighting for. Later, if he still refuses to
shut up, you change your tune and call him a traitor. More exactly,
you call him a Trotskyist.</p>

<p>And what is a Trotskyist? This terrible word&mdash;in Spain at
this moment you can be thrown into jail and kept there
indefinitely, without trial, on the mere rumour that you are a
Trotskyist&mdash;is only beginning to be bandied to and fro in
England. We shall be hearing more of it later. The word
'Trotskyist' (or 'Trotsky-Fascist') is generally used to mean a
disguised Fascist who poses as an ultra-revolutionary in order to
split the left-wing forces. But it derives its peculiar power from
the fact that it means three separate things. It can mean one who,
like Trotsky, wished for world revolution; or a member of the
actual organization of which Trotsky is head (the only legitimate
use of the word); or the disguised Fascist already mentioned. The
three meanings can be telescoped one into the other at will.
Meaning No. 1 may or may not carry with it meaning No. 2, and
meaning No. 2 almost invariably carries with it meaning No. 3.
Thus: 'XY has been heard to speak favourably of world revolution;
therefore he is a Trotskyist; therefore he is a Fascist.' In Spain,
to some extent even in England, <i>anyone</i> professing
revolutionary Socialism (i.e. professing the things the Communist
Party professed until a few years ago) is under suspicion of being
a Trotskyist in the pay of Franco or Hitler.</p>

<p>The accusation is a very subtle one, because in any given case,
unless one happened to know the contrary, it might be true. A
Fascist spy probably <i>would</i> disguise himself as a
revolutionary. In Spain, everyone whose opinions are to the Left of
those of the Communist Party is sooner or later discovered to be a
Trotskyist or, at least, a traitor. At the beginning of the war the
POUM, an opposition Communist party roughly corresponding to the
English ILP., was an accepted party and supplied a minister to the
Catalan Government, later it was expelled from the Government; then
it was denounced as Trotskyist; then it was suppressed, every
member that the police could lay their hands on being flung into
jail.</p>

<p>Until a few months ago the Anarcho-Syndicalists were described
as 'working loyally' beside the Communists. Then the
Anarcho-Syndicalists were levered out of the Government; then it
appeared that they were not working so loyally; now they are in the
process of becoming traitors. After that will come the turn of the
left-wing Socialists. Caballero, the left-wing Socialist
ex-premier, until May 1937 the idol of the Communist press, is
already in outer darkness, a Trotskyist and 'enemy of the people'.
And so the game continues. The logical end is a régime in which
every opposition party and newspaper is suppressed and every
dissentient of any importance is in jail. Of course, such a régime
will be Fascism. It will not be the same as the fascism Franco
would impose, it will even be better than Franco's fascism to the
extent of being worth fighting for, but it will be Fascism. Only,
being operated by Communists and Liberals, it will be called
something different.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, can the war be won? The Communist influence has been
against revolutionary chaos and has therefore, apart from the
Russian aid, tended to produce greater military efficiency. If the
Anarchists saved the Government from August to October 1936, the
Communists have saved it from October onwards. But in organizing
the defence they have succeeded in killing enthusiasm (inside
Spain, not outside). They made a militarized conscript army
possible, but they also made it necessary. It is significant that
as early as January of this year voluntary recruiting had
practically ceased. A revolutionary army can sometimes win by
enthusiasm, but a conscript army has got to win with weapons, and
it is unlikely that the Government will ever have a large
preponderance of arms unless France intervenes or unless Germany
and Italy decide to make off with the Spanish colonies and leave
Franco in the lurch. On the whole, a deadlock seems the likeliest
thing.</p>

<p>And does the Government seriously intend to win? It does not
intend to lose, that is certain. On the other hand, an outright
victory, with Franco in flight and the Germans and Italians driven
into the sea, would raise difficult problems, some of them too
obvious to need mentioning. There is no real evidence and one can
only judge by the event, but I suspect that what the Government is
playing for is a compromise that would leave the war situation
essentially in being. All prophecies are wrong, therefore this one
will be wrong, but I will take a chance and say that though the war
may end quite soon or may drag on for years, it will end with Spain
divided up, either by actual frontiers or into economic zones. Of
course, such a compromise might be claimed as a victory by either
side, or by both.</p>

<p>All that I have said in this article would seem entirely
commonplace in Spain, or even in France. Yet in England, in spite
of the intense interest the Spanish war has aroused, there are very
few people who have even heard of the enormous struggle that is
going on behind the Government lines. Of course, this is no
accident. There has been a quite deliberate conspiracy (I could
give detailed instances) to prevent the Spanish situation from
being understood. People who ought to know better have lent
themselves to the deception on the ground that if you tell the
truth about Spain it will be used as Fascist propaganda.</p>

<p>It is easy to see where such cowardice leads. If the British
public had been given a truthful account of the Spanish war they
would have had an opportunity of learning what Fascism is and how
it can be combated. As it is, the News Chronicle version of Fascism
as a kind of homicidal mania peculiar to Colonel Blimps bombinating
in the economic void has been established more firmly than ever.
And thus we are one step nearer to the great war 'against Fascism'
(cf. 1914, 'against militarism') which will allow Fascism, British
variety, to be slipped over our necks during the first week.</p>

<h2>MARRAKECH (1939)</h2>

<p>As the corpse went past the flies left the restaurant table in a
cloud and rushed after it, but they came back a few minutes
later.</p>

<p>The little crowd of mourners-all men and boys, no
women&mdash;threaded their way across the market-place between the
piles of pomegranates and the taxis and the camels, wailing a short
chant over and over again. What really appeals to the flies is that
the corpses here are never put into coffins, they are merely
wrapped in a piece of rag and carried on a rough wooden bier on the
shoulders of four friends. When the friends get to the
burying-ground they hack an oblong hole a foot or two deep, dump
the body in it and fling over it a little of the dried-up, lumpy
earth, which is like broken brick. No gravestone, no name, no
identifying mark of any kind. The burying-ground is merely a huge
waste of hummocky earth, like a derelict building-lot. After a
month or two no one can even be certain where his own relatives are
buried.</p>

<p>When you walk through a town like this&mdash;two hundred
thousand inhabitants, of whom at least twenty thousand own
literally nothing except the rags they stand up in&mdash;when you
see how the people live, and still more how easily they die, it is
always difficult to believe that you are walking among human
beings. All colonial empires are in reality founded upon that fact.
The people have brown faces&mdash;besides, there are so many of
them! Are they really the same flesh as yourself? Do they even have
names? Or are they merely a kind of undifferentiated brown stuff,
about as individual as bees or coral insects? They rise out of the
earth, they sweat and starve for a few years, and then they sink
back into the nameless mounds of the graveyard and nobody notices
that they are gone. And even the graves themselves soon fade back
into the soil. Sometimes, out for a walk, as you break your way
through the prickly pear, you notice that it is rather bumpy
underfoot, and only a certain regularity in the bumps tells you
that you are walking over skeletons.</p>

<p>I was feeding one of the gazelles in the public gardens.</p>

<p>Gazelles are almost the only animals that look good to eat when
they are still alive, in fact, one can hardly look at their
hindquarters without thinking of mint sauce. The gazelle I was
feeding seemed to know that this thought was in my mind, for though
it took the piece of bread I was holding out it obviously did not
like me. It nibbled rapidly at the bread, then lowered its head and
tried to butt me, then took another nibble and then butted again.
Probably its idea was that if it could drive me away the bread
would somehow remain hanging in mid-air.</p>

<p>An Arab navvy working on the path nearby lowered his heavy hoe
and sidled towards us. He looked from the gazelle to the bread and
from the bread to the gazelle, with a sort of quiet amazement, as
though he had never seen anything quite like this before. Finally
he said shyly in French:</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> could eat some of that bread."</p>

<p>I tore off a piece and he stowed it gratefully in some secret
place under his rags. This man is an employee of the
Municipality.</p>

<p>When you go through the Jewish quarters you gather some idea of
what the medieval ghettoes were probably like. Under their Moorish
rulers the Jews were only allowed to own land in certain restricted
areas, and after centuries of this kind of treatment they have
ceased to bother about overcrowding. Many of the streets are a good
deal less than six feet wide, the houses are completely windowless,
and sore-eyed children cluster everywhere in unbelievable numbers,
like clouds of flies. Down the centre of the street there is
generally running a little river of urine.</p>

<p>In the bazaar huge families of Jews, all dressed in the long
black robe and little black skull-cap, are working in dark
fly-infested booths that look like caves. A carpenter sits
cross-legged at a prehistoric lathe, turning chair-legs at
lightning speed. He works the lathe with a bow in his right hand
and guides the chisel with his left foot, and thanks to a lifetime
of sitting in this position his left leg is warped out of shape. At
his side his grandson, aged six, is already starting on the simpler
parts of the job.</p>

<p>I was just passing the coppersmiths' booths when somebody
noticed that I was lighting a cigarette. Instantly, from the dark
holes all round, there was a frenzied rush of Jews, many of them
old grandfathers with flowing grey beards, all clamouring for a
cigarette. Even a blind man somewhere at the back of one of the
booths heard a rumour of cigarettes and came crawling out, groping
in the air with his hand. In about a minute I had used up the whole
packet. None of these people, I suppose, works less than twelve
hours a day, and every one of them looks on a cigarette as a more
or less impossible luxury.</p>

<p>As the Jews live in self-contained communities they follow the
same trades as the Arabs, except for agriculture. Fruit-sellers,
potters, silversmiths, blacksmiths, butchers, leather-workers,
tailors, water-carriers, beggars, porters&mdash;whichever way you
look you see nothing but Jews. As a matter of fact there are
thirteen thousand of them, all living in the space of a few acres.
A good job Hitler isn't here. Perhaps he is on his way, however.
You hear the usual dark rumours about the Jews, not only from the
Arabs but from the poorer Europeans.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>mon vieux</i>, they took my job away from me and gave
it to a Jew. The Jews! They're the real rulers of this country, you
know. They've got all the money. They control the banks,
finance&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>"But," I said, "isn't it a fact that the average Jew is a
labourer working for about a penny an hour?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's only for show! They're all money-lenders really.
They're cunning, the Jews."</p>

<p>In just the same way, a couple of hundred years ago, poor old
women used to be burned for witchcraft when they could not even
work enough magic to get themselves a square meal.</p>

<p>All people who work with their hands are partly invisible, and
the more important the work they do, the less visible they are.
Still, a white skin is always fairly conspicuous. In northern
Europe, when you see a labourer ploughing a field, you probably
give him a second glance. In a hot country, anywhere south of
Gibraltar or east of Suez, the chances are that you don't even see
him. I have noticed this again and again. In a tropical landscape
one's eye takes in everything except the human beings. It takes in
the dried-up soil, the prickly pear, the palm-tree and the distant
mountain, but it always misses the peasant hoeing at his patch. He
is the same colour as the earth, and a great deal less interesting
to look at.</p>

<p>It is only because of this that the starved countries of Asia
and Africa are accepted as tourist resorts. No one would think of
running cheap trips to the Distressed Areas. But where the human
beings have brown skins their poverty is simply not noticed. What
does Morocco mean to a Frenchman? An orange-grove or a job in
government service. Or to an Englishman? Camels, castles,
palm-trees, Foreign Legionnaires, brass trays and bandits. One
could probably live here for years without noticing that for
nine-tenths of the people the reality of life is an endless,
back-breaking struggle to wring a little food out of an eroded
soil.</p>

<p>Most of Morocco is so desolate that no wild animal bigger than a
hare can live on it. Huge areas which were once covered with forest
have turned into a treeless waste where the soil is exactly like
broken-up brick. Nevertheless a good deal of it is cultivated, with
frightful labour. Everything is done by hand. Long lines of women,
bent double like inverted capital Ls, work their way slowly across
the fields, tearing up the prickly weeds with their hands, and the
peasant gathering lucerne for fodder pulls it up stalk by stalk
instead of reaping it, thus saving an inch or two on each stalk.
The plough is a wretched wooden thing, so frail that one can easily
carry it on one's shoulder, and fitted underneath with a rough iron
spike which stirs the soil to a depth of about four inches. This is
as much as the strength of the animals is equal to. It is usual to
plough with a cow and a donkey yoked together. Two donkeys would
not be quite strong enough, but on the other hand two cows would
cost a little more to feed. The peasants possess no harrows, they
merely plough the soil several times over in different directions,
finally leaving it in rough furrows, after which the whole field
has to be shaped with hoes into small oblong patches, to conserve
water. Except for a day or two after the rare rainstorms there is
never enough water. Along the edges of the fields channels are
hacked out to a depth of thirty or forty feet to get at the tiny
trickles which run through the subsoil.</p>

<p>Every afternoon a file of very old women passes down the road
outside my house, each carrying a load of firewood. All of them are
mummified with age and the sun, and all of them are tiny. It seems
to be generally the case in primitive communities that the women,
when they get beyond a certain age, shrink to the size of children.
One day a poor old creature who could not have been more than four
feet tall crept past me under a vast load of wood. I stopped her
and put a five-sou piece (a little more than a farthing) into her
hand. She answered with a shrill wail, almost a scream, which was
partly gratitude but mainly surprise. I suppose that from her point
of view, by taking any notice of her, I seemed almost to be
violating a law of nature. She accepted her status as an old woman,
that is to say as a beast of burden. When a family is travelling it
is quite usual to see a father and a grown-up son riding ahead on
donkeys, and an old woman following on foot, carrying the
baggage.</p>

<p>But what is strange about these people is their invisibility.
For several weeks, always at about the same time of day, the file
of old women had hobbled past the house with their firewood, and
though they had registered themselves on my eyeballs I cannot truly
say that I had seen them. Firewood was passing&mdash;that was how I
saw it. It was only that one day I happened to be walking behind
them, and the curious up-and-down motion of a load of wood drew my
attention to the human being underneath it. Then for the first time
I noticed the poor old earth-coloured bodies, bodies reduced to
bones and leathery skin, bent double under the crushing weight. Yet
I suppose I had not been five minutes on Moroccan soil before I
noticed the overloading of the donkeys and was infuriated by it.
There is no question that the donkeys are damnably treated. The
Moroccan donkey is hardly bigger than a St Bernard dog, it carries
a load which in the British army would be considered too much for a
fifteen-hands mule, and very often its pack-saddle is not taken off
its back for weeks together. But what is peculiarly pitiful is that
it is the most willing creature on earth, it follows its master
like a dog and does not need either bridle or halter. After a dozen
years of devoted work it suddenly drops dead, whereupon its master
tips it into the ditch and the village dogs have torn its guts out
before it is cold.</p>

<p>This kind of thing makes one's blood boil, whereas&mdash;on the
whole&mdash;the plight of the human beings does not. I am not
commenting, merely pointing to a fact. People with brown skins are
next door to invisible. Anyone can be sorry for the donkey with its
galled back, but it is generally owing to some kind of accident if
one even notices the old woman under her load of sticks.</p>

<p>As the storks flew northward the Negroes were marching
southward&mdash;a long, dusty column, infantry, screw-gun batteries
and then more infantry, four or five thousand men in all, winding
up the road with a clumping of boots and a clatter of iron
wheels.</p>

<p>They were Senegalese, the blackest Negroes in Africa, so black
that sometimes it is difficult to see whereabouts on their necks
the hair begins. Their splendid bodies were hidden in reach-me-down
khaki uniforms, their feet squashed into boots that looked like
blocks of wood, and every tin hat seemed to be a couple of sizes
too small. It was very hot and the men had marched a long way. They
slumped under the weight of their packs and the curiously sensitive
black faces were glistening with sweat.</p>

<p>As they went past a tall, very young Negro turned and caught my
eye. But the look he gave me was not in the least the kind of look
you might expect. Not hostile, not contemptuous, not sullen, not
even inquisitive. It was the shy, wide-eyed Negro look, which
actually is a look of profound respect. I saw how it was. This
wretched boy, who is a French citizen and has therefore been
dragged from the forest to scrub floors and catch syphilis in
garrison towns, actually has feelings of reverence before a white
skin. He has been taught that the white race are his masters, and
he still believes it.</p>

<p>But there is one thought which every white man (and in this
connection it doesn't matter twopence if he calls himself a
Socialist) thinks when he sees a black army marching past. "How
much longer can we go on kidding these people? How long before they
turn their guns in the other direction?"</p>

<p>It was curious, really. Every white man there has this thought
stowed somewhere or other in his mind. I had it, so had the other
onlookers, so had the officers on their sweating chargers and the
white NCOs marching in the ranks. It was a kind of secret which we
all knew and were too clever to tell; only the Negroes didn't know
it. And really it was almost like watching a flock of cattle to see
the long column, a mile or two miles of armed men, flowing
peacefully up the road, while the great white birds drifted over
them in the opposite direction, glittering like scraps of
paper.</p>

<h2>BOYS' WEEKLIES AND FRANK RICHARDS'S REPLY (1940)</h2>

<p>You never walk far through any poor quarter in any big town
without coming upon a small newsagent's shop. The general
appearance of these shops is always very much the same: a few
posters for the <i>Daily Mail</i> and the <i>News of the World</i>
outside, a poky little window with sweet-bottles and packets of
Players, and a dark interior smelling of liquorice allsorts and
festooned from floor to ceiling with vilely printed twopenny
papers, most of them with lurid cover-illustrations in three
colours.</p>

<p>Except for the daily and evening papers, the stock of these
shops hardly overlaps at all with that of the big news-agents.
Their main selling line is the twopenny weekly, and the number and
variety of these are almost unbelievable. Every hobby and
pastime&mdash;cage-birds, fretwork, carpentering, bees,
carrier-pigeons, home conjuring, philately, chess&mdash;has at
least one paper devoted to it, and generally several. Gardening and
livestock-keeping must have at least a score between them. Then
there are the sporting papers, the radio papers, the children's
comics, the various snippet papers such as <i>tit-bits</i>, the
large range of papers devoted to the movies and all more or less
exploiting women's legs, the various trade papers, the women's
story-papers (the <i>Oracle, Secrets, Peg's Paper</i>, etc. etc.),
the needlework papers&mdash;these so numerous that a display of
them alone will often fill an entire window&mdash;and in addition
the long series of 'Yank Mags' (<i>fight stories, action stories,
western short stories</i>, etc.), which are imported shop-soiled
from America and sold at twopence halfpenny or threepence. And the
periodical proper shades off into the fourpenny novelette, the
<i>Aldine boxing novels</i>, the <i>Boys' Friend Library</i>, the
<i>Schoolgirls' Own Library</i> and many others.</p>

<p>Probably the contents of these shops is the best available
indication of what the mass of the English people really feels and
thinks. Certainly nothing half so revealing exists in documentary
form. Best-seller novels, for instance, tell one a great deal, but
the novel is aimed almost exclusively at people above the
&pound;4-a-week level. The movies are probably a very unsafe guide
to popular taste, because the film industry is virtually a
monopoly, which means that it is not obliged to study its public at
all closely. The same applies to some extent to the daily papers,
and most of all to the radio. But it does not apply to the weekly
paper with a smallish circulation and specialized subject-matter.
Papers like the <i>Exchange</i> and <i>Mart</i>, for instance, or
<i>Cage-Birds</i>, or the <i>Oracle</i>, or the <i>Prediction</i>,
or the <i>Matrimonial Times</i>, only exist because there is a
definite demand for them, and they reflect the minds of their
readers as a great national daily with a circulation of millions
cannot possibly do.</p>

<p>Here I am only dealing with a single series of papers, the boys'
twopenny weeklies, often inaccurately described as 'penny
dreadfuls'. Falling strictly within this class there are at present
ten papers, the <i>Gem, Magnet, Modern Boy, Triumph</i> and
<i>Champion</i>, all owned by the Amalgamated Press, and the
<i>Wizard, Rover, Skipper, Hotspur</i> and <i>Adventure</i>, all
owned by D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. What the circulations of these
papers are, I do not know. The editors and proprietors refuse to
name any figures, and in any case the circulation of a paper
carrying serial stories is bound to fluctuate widely. But there is
no question that the combined public of the ten papers is a very
large one. They are on sale in every town in England, and nearly
every boy who reads at all goes through a phase of reading one or
more of them. The <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, which are much the
oldest of these papers, are of rather different type from the rest,
and they have evidently lost some of their popularity during the
past few years. A good many boys now regard them as old fashioned
and 'slow'. Nevertheless I want to discuss them first, because they
are more interesting psychologically than the others, and also
because the mere survival of such papers into the nineteen-thirties
is a rather startling phenomenon.</p>

<p>The <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> are sister-papers (characters
out of one paper frequently appear in the other), and were both
started more than thirty years ago. At that time, together with
Chums and the old B[oy's] O[wn] P[aper], they were the leading
papers for boys, and they remained dominant till quite recently.
Each of them carries every week a fifteen&mdash;or
twenty-thousand-word school story, complete in itself, but usually
more or less connected with the story of the week before. The Gem
in addition to its school story carries one or more adventure
serial. Otherwise the two papers are so much alike that they can be
treated as one, though the <i>Magnet</i> has always been the better
known of the two, probably because it possesses a really first-rate
character in the fat boy. Billy Bunter.</p>

<p>The stories are stories of what purports to be public-school
life, and the schools (Greyfriars in the <i>Magnet</i> and St Jim's
in the <i>Gem</i>) are represented as ancient and fashionable
foundations of the type of Eton or Winchester. All the leading
characters are fourth-form boys aged fourteen or fifteen, older or
younger boys only appearing in very minor parts. Like Sexton Blake
and Nelson Lee, these boys continue week after week and year after
year, never growing any older. Very occasionally a new boy arrives
or a minor character drops out, but in at any rate the last
twenty-five years the personnel has barely altered. All the
principal characters in both papers&mdash;Bob Cherry, Tom Merry,
Harry Wharton, Johnny Bull, Billy Bunter and the rest of
them&mdash;were at Greyfriars or St Jim's long before the Great
War, exactly the same age as at present, having much the same kind
of adventures and talking almost exactly the same dialect. And not
only the characters but the whole atmosphere of both Gem and Magnet
has been preserved unchanged, partly by means of very elaborate
stylization. The stories in the Magnet are signed 'Frank Richards'
and those in the <i>Gem</i>, 'Martin Clifford', but a series
lasting thirty years could hardly be the work of the same person
every week. Consequently they have to be written in a style that is
easily imitated&mdash;an extraordinary, artificial, repetitive
style, quite different from anything else now existing in English
literature. A couple of extracts will do as illustrations. Here is
one from the <i>Magnet:</i></p>

<p>Groan!</p>

<p>'Shut up, Bunter!'</p>

<p>Groan!</p>

<p>Shutting up was not really in Billy Bunter's line. He seldom
shut up, though often requested to do so. On the present awful
occasion the fat Owl of Greyfriars was less inclined than ever to
shut up. And he did not shut up! He groaned, and groaned, and went
on groaning.</p>

<p>Even groaning did not fully express Bunter's feelings. His
feelings, in fact, were inexpressible.</p>

<p>There were six of them in the soup! Only one of the six uttered
sounds of woe and lamentation. But that one, William George Bunter,
uttered enough for the whole party and a little over.</p>

<p>Harry Wharton &amp; Go. stood in a wrathy and worried group.
They were landed and stranded, diddled, dished and done! etc.,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>Here is one from the Gem:</p>

<p>'Oh cwumbs!'</p>

<p>'Oh gum!'</p>

<p>'Oooogh!'</p>

<p>'Urrggh!'</p>

<p>Arthur Augustus sat up dizzily. He grabbed his handkerchief and
pressed it to his damaged nose. Tom Merry sat up, gasping for
breath. They looked at one another.</p>

<p>'Bai Jove! This is a go, deah boy!' gurgled Arthur Augustus. 'I
have been thwown into quite a fluttah! Oogh! The wottahs! The
wuffians! The feahful outsidahs! Wow!' etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>Both of these extracts are entirely typical: you would find
something like them in almost every chapter of every number, to-day
or twenty-five years ago. The first thing that anyone would notice
is the extraordinary amount of tautology (the first of these two
passages contains a hundred and twenty-five words and could be
compressed into about thirty), seemingly designed to spin out the
story, but actually playing its part in creating the atmosphere.
For the same reason various facetious expressions are repeated over
and over again; 'wrathy', for instance, is a great favourite, and
so is 'diddled, dished and done'. 'Oooogh!', 'Grooo!' and 'Yaroo!'
(stylized cries of pain) recur constantly, and so does 'Ha! ha!
ha!', always given a line to itself, so that sometimes a quarter of
a column or thereabouts consists of 'Ha! ha! ha!' The slang ('Go
and cat coke!', 'What the thump!', 'You frabjous ass!', etc. etc.)
has never been altered, so that the boys are now using slang which
is at least thirty years out of date. In addition, the various
nicknames are rubbed in on every possible occasion. Every few lines
we are reminded that Harry Wharton &amp; Co. are 'the Famous Five',
Bunter is always 'the fat Owl' or 'the Owl of the Remove',
Vernon-Smith is always 'the Bounder of Greyfriars', Gussy (the
Honourable Arthur Augustus D'Arcy) is always 'the swell of St
Jim's', and so on and so forth. There is a constant, untiring
effort to keep the atmosphere intact and to make sure that every
new reader learns immediately who is who. The result has been to
make Greyfriars and St Jim's into an extraordinary little world of
their own, a world which cannot be taken seriously by anyone over
fifteen, but which at any rate is not easily forgotten. By a
debasement of the Dickens technique a series of stereotyped
'characters' has been built up, in several cases very successfully.
Billy Bunter, for instance, must be one of the best-known figures
in English fiction; for the mere number of people who know him he
ranks with Sexton Blake, Tarzan, Sherlock Holmes and a handful of
characters in Dickens.</p>

<p>Needless to say, these stories are fantastically unlike life at
a real public school. They run in cycles of rather differing types,
but in general they are the clean-fun, knock-about type of story,
with interest centring round horseplay, practical jokes, ragging
roasters, fights, canings, football, cricket and food. A constantly
recurring story is one in which a boy is accused of some misdeed
committed by another and is too much of a sportsman to reveal the
truth. The 'good' boys are 'good' in the clean-living Englishman
tradition&mdash;they keep in hard training, wash behind their ears,
never hit below the belt etc., etc.,&mdash;and by way of contrast
there is a series of 'bad' boys, Racke, Crooke, Loder and others,
whose badness consists in betting, smoking cigarettes and
frequenting public-houses. All these boys are constantly on the
verge of expulsion, but as it would mean a change of personnel if
any boy were actually expelled, no one is ever caught out in any
really serious offence. Stealing, for instance, barely enters as a
motif. Sex is completely taboo, especially in the form in which it
actually arises at public schools. Occasionally girls enter into
the stories, and very rarely there is something approaching a mild
flirtation, but it is entirely in the spirit of clean fun. A boy
and a girl enjoy going for bicycle rides together&mdash;that is all
it ever amounts to. Kissing, for instance, would be regarded as
'soppy'. Even the bad boys are presumed to be completely sexless.
When the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> were started, it is probable
that there was a deliberate intention to get away from the guilty
sex-ridden atmosphere that pervaded so much of the earlier
literature for boys. In the nineties the <i>Boys' Own Paper</i>,
for instance, used to have its correspondence columns full of
terrifying warnings against masturbation, and books like <i>St
Winifred's</i> and <i>Tom Brown's School-days</i> were heavy with
homosexual feeling, though no doubt the authors were not fully
aware of it. In the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> sex simply does
not exist as a problem. Religion is also taboo; in the whole thirty
years' issue of the two papers the word 'God' probably does not
occur, except in 'God save the King'. On the other hand, there has
always been a very strong 'temperance' strain. Drinking and, by
association, smoking are regarded as rather disgraceful even in an
adult ('shady' is the usual word), but at the same time as
something irresistibly fascinating, a sort of substitute for sex.
In their moral atmosphere the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> have a
great deal in common with the Boy Scout movement, which started at
about the same time.</p>

<p>All literature of this kind is partly plagiarism. Sexton Blake,
for instance, started off quite frankly as an imitation of Sherlock
Holmes, and still resembles him fairly strongly; he has hawk-like
features, lives in Baker Street, smokes enormously and puts on a
dressing-gown when he wants to think. The <i>Gem</i> and
<i>Magnet</i> probably owe something to the old school-story
writers who were flourishing when they began, Gunby Hadath, Desmond
Coke and the rest, but they owe more to nineteenth-century models.
In so far as Greyfriars and St Jim's are like real schools at all,
they are much more like Tom Brown's Rugby than a modern public
school. Neither school has an O.T.G., for instance, games are not
compulsory, and the boys are even allowed to wear what clothes they
like. But without doubt the main origin of these papers is
<i>Stalky &amp; Co</i>. This book has had an immense influence on
boys' literature, and it is one of those books which have a sort of
traditional reputation among people who have never even seen a copy
of it. More than once in boys' weekly papers I have come across a
reference to <i>Stalky &amp; Co.</i> in which the word was spelt
'Storky'. Even the name of the chief comic among the Greyfriars
masters, Mr Prout, is taken from <i>Stalky &amp; Co.</i>, and so is
much of the slang; 'jape', 'merry','giddy', 'bizney' (business),
'frabjous', 'don't' for 'doesn't'&mdash;all of them out of date
even when <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> started. There are also
traces of earlier origins. The name 'Greyfriars' is probably taken
from Thackeray, and Gosling, the school porter in the
<i>Magnet</i>, talks in an imitation of Dickens's dialect.</p>

<p>With all this, the supposed 'glamour' of public-school life is
played for all it is worth. There is all the usual
paraphernalia&mdash;lock-up, roll-call, house matches, fagging,
prefects, cosy teas round the study fire, etc. etc.&mdash;and
constant reference to the 'old school', the 'old grey stones' (both
schools were founded in the early sixteenth century), the 'team
spirit' of the 'Greyfriars men'. As for the snob-appeal, it is
completely shameless. Each school has a titled boy or two whose
titles are constantly thrust in the reader's face; other boys have
the names of well-known aristocratic families, Talbot, Manners,
Lowther. We are for ever being reminded that Gussy is the
Honourable Arthur A. D'Arcy, son of Lord Eastwood, that Jack Blake
is heir to 'broad acres', that Hurree Jamset Ram Singh (nicknamed
Inky) is the Nabob of Bhanipur, that Vernon-Smith's father is a
millionaire. Till recently the illustrations in both papers always
depicted the boys in clothes imitated from those of Eton; in the
last few years Greyfriars has changed over to blazers and flannel
trousers, but St Jim's still sticks to the Eton jacket, and Gussy
sticks to his top-hat. In the school magazine which appears every
week as part of the <i>Magnet</i>, Harry Wharton writes an article
discussing the pocket-money received by the 'fellows in the
Remove', and reveals that some of them get as much as five pounds a
week! This kind of thing is a perfectly deliberate incitement to
wealth-fantasy. And here it is worth noticing a rather curious
fact, and that is that the school story is a thing peculiar to
England. So far as I know, there are extremely few school stories
in foreign languages. The reason, obviously, is that in England
education is mainly a matter of status. The most definite dividing
line between the petite-bourgeoisie and the working class is that
the former pay for their education, and within the bourgeoisie
there is another unbridgeable gulf between the 'public' school and
the 'private' school. It is quite clear that there are tens and
scores of thousands of people to whom every detail of life at a
'posh' public school is wildly thrilling and romantic. They happen
to be outside that mystic world of quadrangles and house-colours,
but they can yearn after it, day-dream about it, live mentally in
it for hours at a stretch. The question is, Who are these people?
Who reads the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet?</i></p>

<p>Obviously one can never be quite certain about this kind of
thing. All I can say from my own observation is this. Boys who are
likely to go to public schools themselves generally read the
<i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, but they nearly always stop reading
them when they are about twelve; they may continue for another year
from force of habit, but by that time they have ceased to take them
seriously. On the other hand, the boys at very cheap private
schools, the schools that are designed for people who can't afford
a public school but consider the Council schools 'common', continue
reading the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> for several years longer.
A few years ago I was a teacher at two of these schools myself. I
found that not only did virtually all the boys read the <i>Gem</i>
and <i>Magnet</i>, but that they were still taking them fairly
seriously when they were fifteen or even sixteen. These boys were
the sons of shopkeepers, office employees and small business and
professional men, and obviously it is this class that the
<i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> are aimed at. But they are certainly
read by working-class boys as well. They are generally on sale in
the poorest quarters of big towns, and I have known them to be read
by boys whom one might expect to be completely immune from
public-school 'glamour'. I have seen a young coal miner, for
instance, a lad who had already worked a year or two underground,
eagerly reading the <i>Gem</i>. Recently I offered a batch of
English papers to some British legionaries of the French Foreign
Legion in North Africa; they picked out the <i>Gem</i> and
<i>Magnet</i> first. Both papers are much read by girls, and the
Pen Pals department of the <i>Gem</i> shows that it is read in
every corner of the British Empire, by Australians, Canadians,
Palestine Jews, Malays, Arabs, Straits Chinese, etc., etc. The
editors evidently expect their readers to be aged round about
fourteen, and the advertisements (milk chocolate, postage stamps,
water pistols, blushing cured, home conjuring tricks, itching
powder, the Phine Phun Ring which runs a needle into your friend's
hand, etc., etc.) indicate roughly the same age; there are also the
Admiralty advertisements, however, which call for youths between
seventeen and twenty-two. And there is no question that these
papers are also read by adults. It is quite common for people to
write to the editor and say that they have read every number of the
<i>Gem</i> or <i>Magnet</i> for the past thirty years. Here, for
instance, is a letter from a lady in Salisbury:</p>

<p>I can say of your splendid yams of Harry Wharton &amp; Co. of
Greyfriars, that they never fail to reach a high standard. Without
doubt they are the finest stories of their type on the market
to-day, which is saying a good deal. They seem to bring you face to
face with Nature. I have taken the Magnet from the start, and have
followed the adventures of Harry Wharton &amp; Co. with rapt
interest. I have no sons, but two daughters, and there's always a
rush to be the first to read the grand old paper. My husband, too,
was a staunch reader of the Magnet until he was suddenly taken away
from us.</p>

<p>It is well worth getting hold of some copies of the <i>Gem</i>
and <i>Magnet</i>, especially the <i>Gem</i>, simply to have a look
at the correspondence columns. What is truly startling is the
intense interest with which the pettiest details of life at
Greyfriars and St Jim's are followed up. Here, for instance, are a
few of the questions sent in by readers:</p>

<p>What age is Dick Roylance?' 'How old is St Jim's?' 'Can you give
me a list of the Shell and their studies?' 'How much did D'Arcy's
monocle cost?' 'How is it that fellows like Crooke are in the Shell
and decent fellows like yourself are only in the Fourth?' 'What are
the Form captain's three chief duties?' 'Who is the chemistry
master at St Jim's?' (From a girl) 'Where is St Jim's situated?
<i>Could</i> you tell me how to get there, as I would love to sec
the building? Are you boys just "phoneys", as I think you are?'</p>

<p>It is clear that many of the boys and girls who write these
letters are living a complete fantasy-life. Sometimes a boy will
write, for instance, giving his age, height, weight, chest and
bicep measurements and asking which member of the Shell or Fourth
Form he most exactly resembles. The demand for a list of the
studies on the Shell passage, with an exact account of who lives in
each, is a very common one. The editors, of course, do everything
in their power to keep up the illusion. In the <i>Gem</i> Jack
Blake is supposed to write answers to correspondents, and in the
<i>Magnet</i> a couple of pages is always given up to the school
magazine (the <i>Greyfriars Herald</i>, edited by Harry Wharton),
and there is another page in which one or other character is
written up each week. The stories run in cycles, two or three
characters being kept in the foreground for several weeks at a
time. First there will be a series of rollicking adventure stories,
featuring the Famous Five and Billy Bunter; then a run of stories
turning on mistaken identity, with Wibley (the make-up wizard) in
the star part; then a run of more serious stories in which
Vernon-Smith is trembling on the verge of expulsion. And here one
comes upon the real secret of the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> and
the probable reason why they continue to be read in spite of their
obvious out-of-dateness.</p>

<p>It is that the characters are so carefully graded as to give
almost every type of reader a character he can identify himself
with. Most boys' papers aim at doing this, hence the boy-assistant
(Sexton Blake's Tinker, Nelson Lee's Nipper, etc.) who usually
accompanies the explorer, detective or what-not on his adventures.
But in these cases there is only one boy, and usually it is much
the same type of boy. In the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> there is
a model for very nearly everybody. There is the normal athletic,
high-spirited boy (Tom Merry, Jack Blake, Frank Nugent), a slightly
rowdier version of this type (Bob Cherry), a more aristocratic
version (Talbot, Manners), a quieter, more serious version (Harry
Wharton), and a stolid, 'bulldog' version (Johnny Bull). Then there
is the reckless, dare-devil type of boy (Vernon-Smith), the
definitely 'clever', studious boy (Mark Linley, Dick Penfold), and
the eccentric boy who is not good at games but possesses some
special talent (Skinner Wibley). And there is the scholarship-boy
(Tom Redwing), an important figure in this class of story because
he makes it possible for boys from very poor homes to project
themselves into the public-school atmosphere. In addition there are
Australian, Irish, Welsh, Manx, Yorkshire and Lancashire boys to
play upon local patriotism. But the subtlety of characterization
goes deeper than this. If one studies the correspondence columns
one sees that there is probably <i>no</i> character in the
<i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> whom some or other reader does not
identify with, except the out-and-out comics, Coker, Billy Bunter,
Fisher T. Fish (the money-grabbing American boy) and, of course,
the masters. Bunter, though in his origin he probably owed
something to the fat boy in <i>Pickwick</i>, is a real creation.
His tight trousers against which boots and canes are constantly
thudding, his astuteness in search of food, his postal order which
never turns up, have made him famous wherever the Union Jack waves.
But he is not a subject for day-dreams. On the other hand, another
seeming figure of fun, Gussy (the Honourable Arthur A. D'Arcy, 'the
swell of St Jim's'), is evidently much admired. Like everything
else in the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, Gussy is at least thirty
years out of date. He is the 'knut' of the early twentieth century
or even the 'masher' of the nineties ('Bai Jove, deah boy!' and
'Weally, I shall be obliged to give you a feahful thwashin'!'), the
monocled idiot who made good on the fields of Mons and Le Gateau.
And his evident popularity goes to show how deep the snob-appeal of
this type is. English people are extremely fond of the titled ass
(cf. Lord Peter Whimsey) who always turns up trumps in the moment
of emergency. Here is a letter from one of Gussy's girl
admirers;</p>

<p>I think you're too hard on Gussy. I wonder he's still In
existence, the way you treat him. He's my hero. Did you know I
write lyrics? How's this&mdash;to the tune of 'Goody Goody'?</p>

<pre>
Gonna get my gas-mask, join the ARP.
'Cos I'm wise to all those bombs you drop on me.
Gonna dig myself a trench
Inside the garden fence;
Gonna seal my windows up with tin
So the tear gas can't get in;
Gonna park my cannon right outside the kerb
With a note to Adolf Hitler: 'Don't disturb!'
And if I never fall in Nazi hands
That's soon enough for me
Gonna get my gas-mask, join the ARP.
</pre>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Do you get on well with girls?</p>

<p>I quote this in full because (dated April 1939) it is
interesting as being probably the earliest mention of Hitler in the
<i>Gem</i>. In the <i>Gem</i> there is also a heroic fat boy. Fatty
Wynn, as a set-off against Bunter. Vernon-Smith, 'the Bounder of
the Remove', a Byronic character, always on the verge of the sack,
is another great favourite. And even some of the cads probably have
their following. Loder, for instance, 'the rotter of the Sixth', is
a cad, but he is also a highbrow and given to saying sarcastic
things about football and the team spirit. The boys of the Remove
only think him all the more of a cad for this, but a certain type
of boy would probably identify with him. Even Racke, Grooke &amp;
Co. are probably admired by small boys who think it diabolically
wicked to smoke cigarettes. (A frequent question in the
correspondence column; 'What brand of cigarettes does Racke
smoke?')</p>

<p>Naturally the politics of the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> are
Conservative, but in a completely pre-1914 style, with no Fascist
tinge. In reality their basic political assumptions are two:
nothing ever changes, and foreigners are funny. In the <i>Gem</i>
of 1939 Frenchmen are still Froggies and Italians are still Dagoes.
Mossoo, the French master at Greyfriars, is the usual comic-paper
Frog, with pointed beard, pegtop trousers, etc. Inky, the Indian
boy, though a rajah, and therefore possessing snob-appeal, is also
the comic babu of the <i>Punch</i> tradition. ("The rowfulness is
not the proper caper, my esteemed Bob," said Inky. "Let dogs
delight in the barkfulness and bitefulness, but the soft answer is
the cracked pitcher that goes longest to a bird in the bush, as the
English proverb remarks.") Fisher T. Fish is the old-style stage
Yankee ("Waal, I guess", etc.) dating from a peroid of
Anglo-American jealousy. Wun Lung, the Chinese boy (he has rather
faded out of late, no doubt because some of the <i>Magnet</i>'S
readers are Straits Chinese), is the nineteenth-century pantomime
Chinaman, with saucer-shaped hat, pigtail and pidgin-English. The
assumption all along is not only that foreigners are comics who are
put there for us to laugh at, but that they can be classified in
much the same way as insects. That is why in all boys' papers, not
only the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, a Chinese is invariably
portrayed with a pigtail. It is the thing you recognize him by,
like the Frenchman's beard or the Italian's barrel-organ. In papers
of this kind it occasionally happens that when the setting of a
story is in a foreign country some attempt is made to describe the
natives as individual human beings, but as a rule it is assumed
that foreigners of any one race are all alike and will conform more
or less exactly to the following patterns:</p>

<pre>
FRENCHMAN: Excitable. Wears beard, gesticulates wildly.
SPANIARD, Mexican, etc.: Sinister, treacherous.
ARAB, Afghan, etc.: Sinister, treacherous.
CHINESE: Sinister, treacherous. Wears pigtail.
ITALIAN: Excitable. Grinds barrel-organ or carries stiletto.
SWEDE, Dane, etc.: Kind-hearted, stupid.
NEGRO: Comic, very faithful.
</pre>

<p>The working classes only enter into the <i>Gem</i> and
<i>Magnet</i> as comics or semi-villains (race-course touts, etc.).
As for class-friction, trade unionism, strikes, slumps,
unemployment, Fascism and civil war&mdash;not a mention. Somewhere
or other in the thirty years' issue of the two papers you might
perhaps find the word 'Socialism', but you would have to look a
long time for it. If the Russian Revolution is anywhere referred
to, it will be indirectly, in the word 'Bolshy' (meaning a person
of violent disagreeable habits). Hitler and the Nazis are just
beginning to make their appearance, in the sort of reference I
quoted above. The war-crisis of September 1938 made just enough
impression to produce a story in which Mr Vernon-Smith, the
Bounder's millionaire father, cashed in on the general panic by
buying up country houses in order to sell them to 'crisis
scuttlers'. But that is probably as near to noticing the European
situation as the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> will come, until the
war actually starts. That does not mean that these papers are
unpatriotic&mdash;quite the contrary! Throughout the Great War the
<i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> were perhaps the most consistently and
cheerfully patriotic papers in England. Almost every week the boys
caught a spy or pushed a conchy into the army, and during the
rationing period 'EAT LESS BREAD' was printed in large type on
every page. But their patriotism has nothing whatever to do with
power-politics or 'ideological' warfare. It is more akin to family
loyalty, and actually it gives one a valuable clue to the attitude
of ordinary people, especially the huge untouched block of the
middle class and the better-off working class. These people are
patriotic to the middle of their bones, but they do not feel that
what happens in foreign countries is any of their business. When
England is in danger they rally to its defence as a matter of
course, but in between-times they are not interested. After all,
England is always in the right and England always wins, so why
worry? It is an attitude that has been shaken during the past
twenty years, but not so deeply as is sometimes supposed. Failure
to understand it is one of the reasons why Left Wing political
parties are seldom able to produce an acceptable foreign
policy.</p>

<p>The mental world of the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, therefore,
is something like this:</p>

<p>The year is 1910&mdash;or 1940, but it is all the same. You are
at Greyfriars, a rosy-cheeked boy of fourteen in posh tailor-made
clothes, sitting down to tea in your study on the Remove passage
after an exciting game of football which was won by an odd goal in
the last half-minute. There is a cosy fire in the study, and
outside the wind is whistling. The ivy clusters thickly round the
old grey stones. The King is on his throne and the pound is worth a
pound. Over in Europe the comic foreigners are jabbering and
gesticulating, but the grim grey battleships of the British Fleet
are steaming up the Channel and at the outposts of Empire the
monocled Englishmen are holding the niggers at bay. Lord Mauleverer
has just got another fiver and we are all settling down to a
tremendous tea of sausages, sardines, crumpets, potted meat, jam
and doughnuts. After tea we shall sit round the study fire having a
good laugh at Billy Bunter and discussing the team for next week's
match against Rook-wood. Everything is safe, solid and
unquestionable. Everything will be the same for ever and ever. That
approximately is the atmosphere.</p>

<p>But now turn from the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> to the more
up-to-date papers which have appeared since the Great War. The
truly significant thing is that they have more points of
resemblance to the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> than points of
difference. But it is better to consider the differences first.</p>

<p>There are eight of these newer papers, the <i>Modern Boy,
Triumph, Champion, Wizard, Rover, Skipper, Hotspur</i> and
<i>Adventure</i>. All of these have appeared since the Great War,
but except for the <i>Modern Boy</i> none of them is less than five
years old. Two papers which ought also to be mentioned briefly
here; though they are not strictly in the same class as the rest,
are the <i>Detective Weekly</i> and the <i>Thriller</i>, both owned
by the Amalgamated Press. The <i>Detective Weekly</i> has taken
over Sexton Blake. Both of these papers admit a certain amount of
sex-interest into their stories, and though certainly read by boys;
they are not aimed at them exclusively. All the others are boys'
papers pure and simple, and they are sufficiently alike to be
considered together. There does not seem to be any notable
difference between Thomson's publications and those of the
Amalgamated Press.</p>

<p>As soon as one looks at these papers one sees their technical
superiority to the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>. To begin with,
they have the great advantage of not being written entirely by one
person. Instead of one long complete story, a number of the
<i>Wizard</i> or <i>Hotspur</i> consists of half a dozen or more
serials, none of which goes on for ever. Consequently there is far
more variety and far less padding, and none of the tiresome
stylization and facetiousness of the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>.
Look at these two extracts, for example:</p>

<p>Billy Bunter groaned.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour had elapsed out of the two hours that
Bunter was booked for extra French.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour there were only fifteen minutes! But
every one of those minutes seemed inordinately long to Bunter. They
seemed to crawl by like tired snails.</p>

<p>Looking at the clock in Classroom No. 10 the fat Owl could
hardly believe that only fifteen minutes had passed. It seemed more
like fifteen hours, if not fifteen days!</p>

<p>Other fellows were in extra French as well as Bunter. They did
not matter. Bunter did! (The Magnet)</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>After a terrible climb, hacking out handholds in the smooth ice
every step of the way up. Sergeant Lionheart Logan of the Mounties
was now clinging like a human fly to the face of an icy cliff, as
smooth and treacherous as a giant pane of glass.</p>

<p>An Arctic blizzard, in all its fury, was buffeting his body,
driving the blinding snow into his face, seeking to tear his
fingers loose from their handholds and dash him to death on the
jagged boulders which lay at the foot of the cliff a hundred feet
below.</p>

<p>Crouching among those boulders were eleven villainous trappers
who had done their best to shoot down Lionheart and his companion,
Constable Jim Rogers&mdash;until the blizzard had blotted the two
Mounties out of sight from below. (The Wizard)</p>

<p>The second extract gets you some distance with the story, the
first takes a hundred words to tell you that Bunter is in the
detention class. Moreover, by not concentrating on school stories
(in point of numbers the school story slightly predominates in all
these papers, except the <i>Thriller</i> and <i>Detective
Weekly</i>), the <i>Wizard, Hotspur</i>, etc., have far greater
opportunities for sensationalism. Merely looking at the cover
illustrations of the papers which I have on the table in front of
me, here are some of the things I see. On one a cowboy is clinging
by his toes to the wing of an aeroplane in mid-air and shooting
down another aeroplane with his revolver. On another a Chinese is
swimming for his life down a sewer with a swarm of ravenous-looking
rats swimming after him. On another an engineer is lighting a stick
of dynamite while a steel robot feels for him with its claws. On
another a man in airman's costume is fighting barehanded against a
rat somewhat larger than a donkey. On another a nearly naked man of
terrific muscular development has just seized a lion by the tail
and flung it thirty yards over the wall of an arena, with the
words, 'Take back your blooming lion!' Clearly no school story can
compete with this kind of thing. From time to time the school
buildings may catch fire or the French master may turn out to be
the head of an international anarchist gang, but in a general way
the interest must centre round cricket, school rivalries, practical
jokes, etc. There is not much room for bombs, death-rays,
sub-machine guns, aeroplanes, mustangs, octopuses, grizzly bears or
gangsters.</p>

<p>Examination of a large number of these papers shows that,
putting aside school stories, the favourite subjects are Wild West,
Frozen North, Foreign Legion, crime (always from the detective's
angle), the Great War (Air Force or Secret Service, not the
infantry), the Tarzan motif in varying forms, professional
football, tropical exploration, historical romance (Robin Hood,
Cavaliers and Round-heads, etc.) and scientific invention. The Wild
West still leads, at any rate as a setting, though the Red Indian
seems to be fading out. The one theme that is really new is the
scientific one. Death-rays, Martians, invisible men, robots,
helicopters and interplanetary rockets figure largely: here and
there there are even far-off rumours of psychotherapy and ductless
glands. Whereas the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> derive from
Dickens and Kipling, the <i>Wizard, Champion, Modern Boy</i>, etc.,
owe a great deal to H. G. Wells, who, rather than Jules Verne, is
the father of 'Scientifiction'. Naturally it is the magical Martian
aspect of science that is most exploited, but one or two papers
include serious articles on scientific subjects, besides quantities
of informative snippets. (Examples: 'A Kauri tree in Queensland,
Australia, is over 12,000 years old'; 'Nearly 50,000 thunderstorms
occur every day'; 'Helium gas costs &pound;1 per 1000 cubic feet';
'There are over 500 varieties of spiders in Great Britain'; 'London
firemen use 14,000,000 gallons of water annually', etc., etc.)
There is a marked advance in intellectual curiosity and, on the
whole, in the demand made on the reader's attention. In practice
the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> and the post-war papers are read
by much the same public, but the mental age aimed at seems to have
risen by a year or two years&mdash;an improvement probably
corresponding to the improvement in elementary education since
1909.</p>

<p>The other thing that has emerged in the post-war boys' papers,
though not to anything like the extent one would expect, is
bully-worship and the cult of violence.</p>

<p>If one compares the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> with a
genuinely modern paper, the thing that immediately strikes one is
the absence of the leader-principle. There is no central dominating
character; instead there are fifteen or twenty characters, all more
or less on an equality, with whom readers of different types can
identify. In the more modern papers this is not usually the case.
Instead of identifying with a schoolboy of more or less his own
age, the reader of the <i>Skipper, Hotspur</i>, etc., is led to
identify with a G-man, with a Foreign Legionary, with some variant
of Tarzan, with an air ace, a master spy, an explorer, a
pugilist&mdash;at any rate with some single all-powerful character
who dominates everyone about him and whose usual method of solving
any problem is a sock on the jaw. This character is intended as a
superman, and as physical strength is the form of power that boys
can best understand, he is usually a sort of human gorilla; in the
Tarzan type of story he is sometimes actually a giant, eight or ten
feet high. At the same time the scenes of violence in nearly all
these stories are remarkably harmless and unconvincing. There is a
great difference in tone between even the most bloodthirsty English
paper and the threepenny Yank Mags, <i>Fight Stories, Action
Stories</i>, etc. (not strictly boys' papers, but largely read by
boys). In the Yank Mags you get real blood-lust, really gory
descriptions of the all-in, jump-on-his-testicles style fighting,
written in a jargon that has been perfected by people who brood
endlessly on violence. A paper like <i>Fight Stories</i>, for
instance, would have very little appeal except to sadists and
masochists. You can see the comparative gentleness of the English
civilization by the amateurish way in which prize-fighting is
always described in the boys' weeklies. There is no specialized
vocabulary. Look at these four extracts, two English, two
American;</p>

<p>When the gong sounded, both men were breathing heavily and each
had great red marks on his chest. Bill's chin was bleeding, and Ben
had a cut over his right eye.</p>

<p>Into their corners they sank, but when the gong clanged again
they were up swiftly, and they went like tigers at each other.
(<i>Rover</i>)</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>He walked in stolidly and smashed a clublike right to my face.
Blood spattered and I went back on my heels, but surged in and
ripped my right under the heart. Another right smashed full on
Ben's already battered mouth, and, spitting out the fragments of a
tooth, he crashed a flailing left to my body. (<i>Fight
Stories</i>)</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>It was amazing to watch the Black Panther at work. His muscles
rippled and slid under his dark skin. There was all the power and
grace of a giant cat in his swift and terrible onslaught.</p>

<p>He volleyed blows with a bewildering speed for so huge a fellow.
In a moment Ben was simply blocking with his gloves as well as he
could. Ben was really a past-master of defence. He had many fine
victories behind him. But the Negro's rights and lefts crashed
through openings that hardly any other fighter could have found.
(<i>Wizard</i>)</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Haymakers which packed the bludgeoning weight of forest monarchs
crashing down under the ax hurled into the bodies of the two
heavies as they swapped punches. (<i>Fight Stories</i>)</p>

<p>Notice how much more knowledgeable the American extracts sound.
They are written for devotees of the prize-ring, the others are
not. Also, it ought to be emphasized that on its level the moral
code of the English boys' papers is a decent one. Crime and
dishonesty are never held up to admiration, there is none of the
cynicism and corruption of the American gangster story. The huge
sale of the Yank Mags in England shows that there is a demand for
that kind of thing, but very few English writers seem able to
produce it. When hatred of Hitler became a major emotion in
America, it was interesting to see how promptly 'anti-Fascism' was
adapted to pornographic purposes by the editors of the Yank Mags.
One magazine which I have in front of me is given up to a long,
complete story, 'When Hell Game to America', in which the agents of
a 'blood-maddened European dictator' are trying to conquer the
U.S.A. with death-rays and invisible aeroplanes. There is the
frankest appeal to sadism, scenes in which the Nazis tie bombs to
women's backs and fling them off heights to watch them blown to
pieces in mid-air, others in which they tie naked girls together by
their hair and prod them with knives to make them dance, etc., etc.
The editor comments solemnly on all this, and uses it as a plea for
tightening up restrictions against immigrants. On another page of
the same paper: '<i>Lives of the Hotcha Chorus Girls</i>. Reveals
all the intimate secrets and fascinating pastimes of the famous
Broadway Hotcha girls. <i>Nothing is omitted</i>. Price 10c.'
'<i>How to Love</i>. 10c.' '<i>French Photo Ring</i>. 25c.'
'<i>Naughty Nudies Transfers</i>. From the outside of the glass you
see a beautiful girl, innocently dressed. Turn it around and look
through the glass and oh! what a difference! Set of 3 transfers
25c.,' etc., etc., etc. There is nothing at all like this in any
English paper likely to be read by boys. But the process of
Americanization is going on all the same. The American ideal, the
'he-man', the 'tough guy', the gorilla who puts everything right by
socking everybody on the jaw, now figures in probably a majority of
boys' papers. In one serial now running in the <i>Skipper</i> he is
always portrayed ominously enough, swinging a rubber truncheon.</p>

<p>The development of the <i>Wizard, Hotspur</i>, etc., as against
the earlier boys' papers, boils down to this: better technique,
more scientific interest, more bloodshed, more leader-worship. But,
after all, it is the <i>lack</i> of development that is the really
striking thing.</p>

<p>To begin with, there is no political development whatever. The
world of the <i>Skipper</i> and the <i>Champion</i> is still the
pre-1914 world of the <i>Magnet</i> and the <i>Gem</i>. The Wild
West story, for instance, with its cattle-rustlers, lynch-law and
other paraphernalia belonging to the eighties, is a curiously
archaic thing. It is worth noticing that in papers of this type it
is always taken for granted that adventures only happen at the ends
of the earth, in tropical forests, in Arctic wastes, in African
deserts, on Western prairies, in Chinese opium
dens&mdash;everywhere in fact, except the places where things
really <i>do</i> happen. That is a belief dating from thirty or
forty years ago, when the new continents were in process of being
opened up. Nowadays, of course, if you really want adventure, the
place to look for it is in Europe. But apart from the picturesque
side of the Great War, contemporary history is carefully excluded.
And except that Americans are now admired instead of being laughed
at, foreigners are exactly the same figures of fun that they always
were. If a Chinese character appears, he is still the sinister
pigtailed opium-smuggler of Sax Rohmer; no indication that things
have been happening in China since 1912&mdash;no indication that a
war is going on there, for instance. If a Spaniard appears, he is
still a 'dago' or 'greaser' who rolls cigarettes and stabs people
in the back; no indication that things have been happening in
Spain. Hitler and the Nazis have not yet appeared, or are barely
making their appearance. There will be plenty about them in a
little while, but it will be from a strictly patriotic angle
(Britain versus Germany), with the real meaning of the struggle
kept out of sight as much as possible. As for the Russian
Revolution, it is extremely difficult to find any reference to it
in any of these papers. When Russia is mentioned at all it is
usually in an information snippet (example: 'There are 29,000
centenarians in the USSR.'), and any reference to the Revolution is
indirect and twenty years out of date. In one story in the
<i>Rover</i>, for instance, somebody has a tame bear, and as it is
a Russian bear, it is nicknamed Trotsky&mdash;obviously an echo of
the 1917-23 period and not of recent controversies. The clock has
stopped at 1910. Britannia rules the waves, and no one has heard of
slumps, booms, unemployment, dictatorships, purges or concentration
camps.</p>

<p>And in social outlook there is hardly any advance. The
snobbishness is somewhat less open than in the <i>Gem</i> and
<i>Magnet</i>&mdash;that is the most one can possibly say. To begin
with, the school story, always partly dependent on snob-appeal, is
by no means eliminated. Every number of a boys' paper includes at
least one school story, these stories slightly outnumbering the
Wild Westerns. The very elaborate fantasy-life of the <i>Gem</i>
and <i>Magnet</i> is not imitated and there is more emphasis on
extraneous adventure, but the social atmosphere (old grey stones)
is much the same. When a new school is introduced at the beginning
of a story we are often told in just those words that 'it was a
very posh school'. From time to time a story appears which is
ostensibly directed <i>against</i> snobbery. The scholarship-boy
(cf. Tom Redwing in the <i>Magnet</i>) makes fairly frequent
appearances, and what is essentially the same theme is sometimes
presented in this form: there is great rivalry between two schools,
one of which considers itself more 'posh' than the other, and there
are fights, practical jokes, football matches, etc., always ending
in the discomfiture of the snobs. If one glances very superficially
at some of these stories it is possible to imagine that a
democratic spirit has crept into the boys' weeklies, but when one
looks more closely one sees that they merely reflect the bitter
jealousies that exist within the white-collar class. Their real
function is to allow the boy who goes to a cheap private school
(<i>not</i> a Council school) to feel that his school is just as
'posh' in the sight of God as Winchester or Eton. The sentiment of
school loyalty ('We're better than the fellows down the road'), a
thing almost unknown to the real working class, is still kept up.
As these stories are written by many different hands, they do, of
course, vary a good deal in tone. Some are reasonably free from
snobbishness, in others money and pedigree are exploited even more
shamelessly than in the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>. In one that I
came across an actual <i>majority</i> of the boys mentioned were
titled.</p>

<p>Where working-class characters appear, it is usually either as
comics (jokes about tramps, convicts, etc.), or as prize-fighters,
acrobats, cowboys, professional footballers and Foreign
Legionaries&mdash;in other words, as adventurers. There is no
facing of the facts about working-class life, or, indeed, about
<i>working</i> life of any description. Very occasionally one may
come across a realistic description of, say, work in a coal-mine,
but in all probability it will only be there as the background of
some lurid adventure. In any case the central character is not
likely to be a coal-miner. Nearly all the time the boy who reads
these papers&mdash;in nine cases out often a boy who is going to
spend his life working in a shop, in a factory or in some
subordinate job in an office&mdash;is led to identify with people
in positions of command, above all with people who are never
troubled by shortage of money. The Lord Peter Wimsey figure, the
seeming idiot who drawls and wears a monocle but is always to the
fore in moments of danger, turns up over and over again. (This
character is a great favourite in Secret Service stories.) And, as
usual, the heroic characters all have to talk B.B.C.; they may talk
Scottish or Irish or American, but no one in a star part is ever
permitted to drop an aitch. Here it is worth comparing the social
atmosphere of the boys' weeklies with that of the women's weeklies,
the <i>Oracle</i>, the <i>Family Star, Peg's Paper</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The women's papers are aimed at an older public and are read for
the most part by girls who are working for a living. Consequently
they are on the surface much more realistic. It is taken for
granted, for example, that nearly everyone has to live in a big
town and work at a more or less dull job. Sex, so far from being
taboo, is <i>the</i> subject. The short, complete stories, the
special feature of these papers, are generally of the 'came the
dawn' type: the heroine narrowly escapes losing her 'boy' to a
designing rival, or the 'boy' loses his job and has to postpone
marriage, but presently gets a better job. The changeling-fantasy
(a girl brought up in a poor home is 'really' the child of rich
parents) is another favourite. Where sensationalism comes in,
usually in the serials, it arises out of the more domestic type of
crime, such as bigamy, forgery or sometimes murder; no Martians,
death-rays or international anarchist gangs. These papers are at
any rate aiming at credibility, and they have a link with real life
in their correspondence columns, where genuine problems are being
discussed. Ruby M. Ayres's column of advice in the <i>Oracle</i>,
for instance, is extremely sensible and well written. And yet the
world of the <i>Oracle</i> and <i>Peg's Paper</i> is a pure
fantasy-world. It is the same fantasy all the time; pretending to
be richer than you are. The chief impression that one carries away
from almost every story in these papers is of a frightful,
overwhelming 'refinement'. Ostensibly the characters are
working-class people, but their habits, the interiors of their
houses, their clothes, their outlook and, above all, their speech
are entirely middle class. They are all living at several pounds a
week above their income. And needless to say, that is just the
impression that is intended. The idea is to give the bored
factory-girl or worn-out mother of five a dream-life in which she
pictures herself&mdash;not actually as a duchess (that convention
has gone out) but as, say, the wife of a bank-manager. Not only is
a five-to-six-pound-a-week standard of life set up as the ideal,
but it is tacitly assumed that that is how working-class people
really <i>do</i> live. The major facts are simply not faced. It is
admitted, for instance, that people sometimes lose their jobs; but
then the dark clouds roll away and they get better jobs instead. No
mention of un-employment as something permanent and inevitable, no
mention of the dole, no mention of trade unionism. No suggestion
anywhere that there can be anything wrong with the system <i>as a
system</i>; there are only individual misfortunes, which are
generally due to somebody's wickedness and can in any case be put
right in the last chapter. Always the dark clouds roll away, the
kind employer raises Alfred's wages, and there are jobs for
everybody except the drunks. It is still the world of the
<i>Wizard</i> and the <i>Gem</i>, except that there are
orange-blossoms instead of machine-guns.</p>

<p>The outlook inculcated by all these papers is that of a rather
exceptionally stupid member of the Navy League in the year 1910.
Yes, it may be said, but what does it matter? And in any case, what
else do you expect?</p>

<p>Of course no one in his senses would want to turn the so-called
penny dreadful into a realistic novel or a Socialist tract. An
adventure story must of its nature be more or less remote from real
life. But, as I have tried to make clear, the unreality of the
<i>Wizard</i> and the <i>Gem</i> is not so artless as it looks.
These papers exist because of a specialized demand, because boys at
certain ages find it necessary to read about Martians, death-rays,
grizzly bears and gangsters. They get what they are looking for,
but they get it wrapped up in the illusions which their future
employers think suitable for them. To what extent people draw their
ideas from fiction is disputable. Personally I believe that most
people are influenced far more than they would care to admit by
novels, serial stories, films and so forth, and that from this
point of view the worst books are often the most important, because
they are usually the ones that are read earliest in life. It is
probable that many people who would consider themselves extremely
sophisticated and 'advanced' are actually carrying through life an
imaginative background which they acquired in childhood from (for
instance) Sapper and Ian Hay. If that is so, the boys' twopenny
weeklies are of the deepest importance. Here is the stuff that is
read somewhere between the ages of twelve and eighteen by a very
large proportion, perhaps an actual majority, of English boys,
including many who will never read anything else except newspapers;
and along with it they are absorbing a set of beliefs which would
be regarded as hopelessly out of date in the Central Office of the
Conservative Party. All the better because it is done indirectly,
there is being pumped into them the conviction that the major
problems of our time do not exist, that there is nothing wrong with
<i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism, that foreigners are un-important
comics and that the British Empire is a sort of charity-concern
which will last for ever. Considering who owns these papers, it is
difficult to believe that this is un-intentional. Of the twelve
papers I have been discussing (i.e. twelve including the
<i>Thriller</i> and <i>Detective Weekly</i>) seven are the property
of the Amalgamated Press, which is one of the biggest
press-combines in the world and controls more than a hundred
different papers. The <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, therefore, are
closely linked up with the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and the
<i>Financial Times</i>. This in itself would be enough to rouse
certain suspicions, even if it were not obvious that the stories in
the boys' weeklies are politically vetted. So it appears that if
you feel the need of a fantasy-life in which you travel to Mars and
fight lions bare-handed (and what boy doesn't?), you can only have
it by delivering yourself over, mentally, to people like Lord
Camrose. For there is no competition. Throughout the whole of this
run of papers the differences are negligible, and on this level no
others exist. This raises the question, why is there no such thing
as a left-wing boys' paper?</p>

<p>At first glance such an idea merely makes one slightly sick. It
is so horribly easy to imagine what a left-wing boys' paper would
be like, if it existed. I remember in 1920 or 1921 some optimistic
person handing round Communist tracts among a crowd of
public-school boys. The tract I received was of the
question-and-answer kind:</p>

<pre>
Q. 'Can a Boy Communist be a Boy Scout, Comrade?'
A. 'No, Comrade.'
Q. 'Why, Comrade?'
A. 'Because, Comrade, a Boy Scout must salute the Union Jack, which is
    the symbol of tyranny and oppression,' etc., etc.
</pre>

<p>Now suppose that at this moment somebody started a left-wing
paper deliberately aimed at boys of twelve or fourteen. I do not
suggest that the whole of its contents would be exactly like the
tract I have quoted above, but does anyone doubt that they would be
<i>something</i> like it? Inevitably such a paper would either
consist of dreary up-lift or it would be under Communist influence
and given over to adulation of Soviet Russia; in either case no
normal boy would ever look at it. Highbrow literature apart, the
whole of the existing left-wing Press, in so far as it is at all
vigorously 'left', is one long tract. The one Socialist paper in
England which could live a week on its merits <i>as a paper</i> is
the <i>Daily Herald</i>: and how much Socialism is there in the
<i>Daily Herald</i>? At this moment, therefore, a paper with a
'left' slant and at the same time likely to have an appeal to
ordinary boys in their teens is something almost beyond hoping
for.</p>

<p>But it does not follow that it is impossible. There is no clear
reason why every adventure story should necessarily be mixed up
with snobbishness and gutter patriotism. For, after all, the
stories in the <i>Hotspur</i> and the <i>Modern Boy</i> are not
Conservative tracts; they are merely adventure stories with a
Conservative bias. It is fairly easy to imagine the process being
reversed. It is possible, for instance, to imagine a paper as
thrilling and lively as the <i>Hotspur</i>, but with subject-matter
and 'ideology' a little more up to date. It is even possible
(though this raises other difficulties) to imagine a women's paper
at the same literary level as the <i>Oracle</i>, dealing in
approximately the same kind of story, but taking rather more
account of the realities of working-class life. Such things have
been done before, though not in England. In the last years of the
Spanish monarchy there was a large output in Spain of left-wing
novelettes, some of them evidently of anarchist origin.
Unfortunately at the time when they were appearing I did not see
their social significance, and I lost the collection of them that I
had, but no doubt copies would still be procurable. In get-up and
style of story they were very similar to the English fourpenny
novelette, except that their inspiration was 'left'. If, for
instance, a story described police pursuing anarchists through the
mountains, it would be from the point of view of the anarchist and
not of the police. An example nearer to hand is the Soviet film
<i>Chapaiev</i>, which has been shown a number of times in London.
Technically, by the standards of the time when it was made,
<i>Chapaiev</i> is a first-rate film, but mentally, in spite of the
unfamiliar Russian background, it is not so very remote from
Hollywood. The one thing that lifts it out of the ordinary is the
remarkable performance by the actor who takes the part of the White
officer (the fat one)&mdash;a performance which looks very like an
inspired piece of gagging. Otherwise the atmosphere is familiar.
All the usual paraphernalia is there&mdash;heroic fight against
odds, escape at the last moment, shots of galloping horses, love
interest, comic relief. The film is in fact a fairly ordinary one,
except that its tendency is 'left'. In a Hollywood film of the
Russian Civil War the Whites would probably be angels and the Reds
demons. In the Russian version the Reds are angels and the Whites
demons. That is also a lie, but, taking the long view, it is a less
pernicious lie than the other.</p>

<p>Here several difficult problems present themselves. Their
general nature is obvious enough, and I do not want to discuss
them. I am merely pointing to the fact that, in England, popular
imaginative literature is a field that left-wing thought has never
begun to enter. <i>All</i> fiction from the novels in the mushroom
libraries downwards is censored in the interests of the ruling
class. And boys' fiction above all, the blood-and-thunder stuff
which nearly every boy devours at some time or other, is sodden in
the worst illusions of 1910. The fact is only unimportant if one
believes that what is read in childhood leaves no impression
behind. Lord Camrose and his colleagues evidently believe nothing
of the kind, and, after all, Lord Camrose ought to know.</p>

</p>

<h2>CHARLES DICKENS (1940)</h2>

<p><b>I</b>
</p>

<p>Dickens is one of those writers who are well worth stealing.
Even the burial of his body in Westminster Abbey was a species of
theft, if you come to think of it.</p>

<p>When Chesterton wrote his introductions to the Everyman Edition
of Dickens's works, it seemed quite natural to him to credit
Dickens with his own highly individual brand of medievalism, and
more recently a Marxist writer, Mr. T. A. Jackson, has made
spirited efforts to turn Dickens into a blood-thirsty
revolutionary. The Marxist claims him as 'almost' a Marxist, the
Catholic claims him as 'almost' a Catholic, and both claim him as a
champion of the proletariat (or 'the poor', as Chesterton would
have put it). On the other hand, Nadezhda Krupskaya, in her little
book on Lenin, relates that towards the end of his life Lenin went
to see a dramatized version of <i>The Cricket on the Hearth</i>,
and found Dickens's 'middle-class sentimentality' so intolerable
that he walked out in the middle of a scene.</p>

<p>Taking 'middle-class' to mean what Krupskaya might be expected
to mean by it, this was probably a truer judgement than those of
Chesterton and Jackson. But it is worth noticing that the dislike
of Dickens implied in this remark is something unusual. Plenty of
people have found him unreadable, but very few seem to have felt
any hostility towards the general spirit of his work. Some years
later Mr. Bechhofer Roberts published a full-length attack on
Dickens in the form of a novel (<i>This Side Idolatry</i>), but it
was a merely personal attack, concerned for the most part with
Dickens's treatment of his wife. It dealt with incidents which not
one in a thousand of Dickens's readers would ever hear about, and
which no more invalidates his work than the second-best bed
invalidates <i>Hamlet</i>. All that the book really demonstrated
was that a writer's literary personality has little or nothing to
do with his private character. It is quite possible that in private
life Dickens was just the kind of insensitive egoist that Mr.
Bechhofer Roberts makes him appear. But in his published work there
is implied a personality quite different from this, a personality
which has won him far more friends than enemies. It might well have
been otherwise, for even if Dickens was a bourgeois, he was
certainly a subversive writer, a radical, one might truthfully say
a rebel. Everyone who has read widely in his work has felt this.
Gissing, for instance, the best of the writers on Dickens, was
anything but a radical himself, and he disapproved of this strain
in Dickens and wished it were not there, but it never occurred to
him to deny it. In <i>Oliver Twist, Hard Times, Bleak House, Little
Dorrit</i>, Dickens attacked English institutions with a ferocity
that has never since been approached. Yet he managed to do it
without making himself hated, and, more than this, the very people
he attacked have swallowed him so completely that he has become a
national institution himself. In its attitude towards Dickens the
English public has always been a little like the elephant which
feels a blow with a walking-stick as a delightful tickling. Before
I was ten years old I was having Dickens ladled down my throat by
schoolmasters in whom even at that age I could see a strong
resemblance to Mr. Creakle, and one knows without needing to be
told that lawyers delight in Sergeant Buzfuz and that <i>Little
Dorrit</i> is a favourite in the Home Office. Dickens seems to have
succeeded in attacking everybody and antagonizing nobody. Naturally
this makes one wonder whether after all there was something unreal
in his attack upon society. Where exactly does he stand, socially,
morally, and politically? As usual, one can define his position
more easily if one starts by deciding what he was <i>not</i>.</p>

<p>In the first place he was <i>not</i>, as Messrs. Chesterton and
Jackson seem to imply, a 'proletarian' writer. To begin with, he
does not write about the proletariat, in which he merely resembles
the overwhelming majority of novelists, past and present. If you
look for the working classes in fiction, and especially English
fiction, all you find is a hole. This statement needs qualifying,
perhaps. For reasons that are easy enough to see, the agricultural
labourer (in England a proletarian) gets a fairly good showing in
fiction, and a great deal has been written about criminals,
derelicts and, more recently, the working-class intelligentsia. But
the ordinary town proletariat, the people who make the wheels go
round, have always been ignored by novelists. When they do find
their way between the covers of a book, it is nearly always as
objects of pity or as comic relief. The central action of Dickens's
stories almost invariably takes place in middle-class surroundings.
If one examines his novels in detail one finds that his real
subject-matter is the London commercial bourgeoisie and their
hangers-on&mdash;lawyers, clerks, tradesmen, innkeepers, small
craftsmen, and servants. He has no portrait of an agricultural
worker, and only one (Stephen Blackpool in <i>Hard Times</i>) of an
industrial worker. The Plornishes in <i>Little Dorrit</i> are
probably his best picture of a working-class family&mdash;the
Peggottys, for instance, hardly belong to the working
class&mdash;but on the whole he is not successful with this type of
character. If you ask any ordinary reader which of Dickens's
proletarian characters he can remember, the three he is almost
certain to mention are Bill Sykes, Sam Weller, and Mrs. Gamp. A
burglar, a valet, and a drunken midwife&mdash;not exactly a
representative cross-section of the English working class.</p>

<p>Secondly, in the ordinarily accepted sense of the word, Dickens
is not a 'revolutionary' writer. But his position here needs some
defining.</p>

<p>Whatever else Dickens may have been, he was not a
hole-and-corner soul-saver, the kind of well-meaning idiot who
thinks that the world will be perfect if you amend a few bylaws and
abolish a few anomalies. It is worth comparing him with Charles
Reade, for instance. Reade was a much better-informed man than
Dickens, and in some ways more public-spirited. He really hated the
abuses he could understand, he showed them up in a series of novels
which for all their absurdity are extremely readable, and he
probably helped to alter public opinion on a few minor but
important points. But it was quite beyond him to grasp that, given
the existing form of society, certain evils <i>cannot</i> be
remedied. Fasten upon this or that minor abuse, expose it, drag it
into the open, bring it before a British jury, and all will be well
that is how he sees it. Dickens at any rate never imagined that you
can cure pimples by cutting them off. In every page of his work one
can see a consciousness that society is wrong somewhere at the
root. It is when one asks 'Which root?' that one begins to grasp
his position.</p>

<p>The truth is that Dickens's criticism of society is almost
exclusively moral. Hence the utter lack of any constructive
suggestion anywhere in his work. He attacks the law, parliamentary
government, the educational system and so forth, without ever
clearly suggesting what he would put in their places. Of course it
is not necessarily the business of a novelist, or a satirist, to
make constructive suggestions, but the point is that Dickens's
attitude is at bottom not even destructive. There is no clear sign
that he wants the existing order to be overthrown, or that he
believes it would make very much difference if it <i>were</i>
overthrown. For in reality his target is not so much society as
'human nature'. It would be difficult to point anywhere in his
books to a passage suggesting that the economic system is wrong
<i>as a system</i>. Nowhere, for instance, does he make any attack
on private enterprise or private property. Even in a book like
<i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, which turns on the power of corpses to
interfere with living people by means of idiotic wills, it does not
occur to him to suggest that individuals ought not to have this
irresponsible power. Of course one can draw this inference for
oneself, and one can draw it again from the remarks about
Bounderby's will at the end of <i>Hard Times</i>, and indeed from
the whole of Dickens's work one can infer the evil of
<i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism; but Dickens makes no such
inference himself. It is said that Macaulay refused to review
<i>Hard Times</i> because he disapproved of its 'sullen Socialism'.
Obviously Macaulay is here using the word 'Socialism' in the same
sense in which, twenty years ago, a vegetarian meal or a Cubist
picture used to be referred to as 'Bolshevism'. There is not a line
in the book that can properly be called Socialistic; indeed, its
tendency if anything is pro-capitalist, because its whole moral is
that capitalists ought to be kind, not that workers ought to be
rebellious. Bounder by is a bullying windbag and Gradgrind has been
morally blinded, but if they were better men, the system would work
well enough that, all through, is the implication. And so far as
social criticism goes, one can never extract much more from Dickens
than this, unless one deliberately reads meanings into him. His
whole 'message' is one that at first glance looks like an enormous
platitude: If men would behave decently the world would be
decent.</p>

<p>Naturally this calls for a few characters who are in positions
of authority and who <i>do</i> behave decently. Hence that
recurrent Dickens figure, the good rich man. This character belongs
especially to Dickens's early optimistic period. He is usually a
'merchant' (we are not necessarily told what merchandise he deals
in), and he is always a superhumanly kind-hearted old gentleman who
'trots' to and fro, raising his employees' wages, patting children
on the head, getting debtors out of jail and in general, acting the
fairy godmother. Of course he is a pure dream figure, much further
from real life than, say, Squeers or Micawber. Even Dickens must
have reflected occasionally that anyone who was so anxious to give
his money away would never have acquired it in the first place. Mr.
Pickwick, for instance, had 'been in the city', but it is difficult
to imagine him making a fortune there. Nevertheless this character
runs like a connecting thread through most of the earlier books.
Pickwick, the Cheerybles, old Chuzzlewit, Scrooge&mdash;it is the
same figure over and over again, the good rich man, handing out
guineas. Dickens does however show signs of development here. In
the books of the middle period the good rich man fades out to some
extent. There is no one who plays this part in <i>A Tale Of Two
Cities</i>, nor in <i>Great Expectations</i>&mdash;<i>Great
Expectations</i> is, in fact, definitely an attack on
patronage&mdash;and in <i>Hard Times</i> it is only very doubtfully
played by Gradgrind after his reformation. The character reappears
in a rather different form as Meagles in <i>Little Dorrit</i> and
John Jarndyce in <i>Bleak House</i>&mdash;one might perhaps add
Betsy Trotwood in <i>David Copperfield</i>. But in these books the
good rich man has dwindled from a 'merchant' to a <i>rentier</i>.
This is significant. A <i>rentier</i> is part of the possessing
class, he can and, almost without knowing it, does make other
people work for him, but he has very little direct power. Unlike
Scrooge or the Cheerybles, he cannot put everything right by
raising everybody's wages. The seeming inference from the rather
despondent books that Dickens wrote in the fifties is that by that
time he had grasped the helplessness of well-meaning individuals in
a corrupt society. Nevertheless in the last completed novel, <i>Our
Mutual Friend</i> (published 1864-5), the good rich man comes back
in full glory in the person of Boffin. Boffin is a proletarian by
origin and only rich by inheritance, but he is the usual <i>deus ex
machina</i>, solving everybody's problems by showering money in all
directions. He even 'trots', like the Cheerybles. In several ways
<i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is a return to the earlier manner, and not
an unsuccessful return either. Dickens's thoughts seem to have come
full circle. Once again, individual kindliness is the remedy for
everything.</p>

<p>One crying evil of his time that Dickens says very little about
is child labour. There are plenty of pictures of suffering children
in his books, but usually they are suffering in schools rather than
in factories. The one detailed account of child labour that he
gives is the description in <i>David Copperfield</i> of little
David washing bottles in Murdstone &amp; Grinby's warehouse. This,
of course, is autobiography. Dickens himself, at the age of ten,
had worked in Warren's blacking factory in the Strand, very much as
he describes it here. It was a terribly bitter memory to him,
partly because he felt the whole incident to be discreditable to
his parents, and he even concealed it from his wife till long after
they were married. Looking back on this period, he says in <i>David
Copperfield</i>:</p>

<p>It is a matter of some surprise to me, even now, that I can have
been so easily thrown away at such an age. A child of excellent
abilities and with strong powers of observation, quick, eager,
delicate, and soon hurt bodily or mentally, it seems wonderful to
me that nobody should have made any sign in my behalf. But none was
made; and I became, at ten years old, a little labouring hind in
the service of Murdstone &amp; Grinby.</p>

<p>And again, having described the rough boys among whom he
worked:</p>

<p>No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into
this companionship...and felt my hopes of growing up to be a
learned and distinguished man crushed in my bosom.</p>

<p>Obviously it is not David Copperfield who is speaking, it is
Dickens himself. He uses almost the same words in the autobiography
that he began and abandoned a few months earlier. Of course Dickens
is right in saying that a gifted child ought not to work ten hours
a day pasting labels on bottles, but what he does not say is that
<i>no</i> child ought to be condemned to such a fate, and there is
no reason for inferring that he thinks it. David escapes from the
warehouse, but Mick Walker and Mealy Potatoes and the others are
still there, and there is no sign that this troubles Dickens
particularly. As usual, he displays no consciousness that the
<i>structure</i> of society can be changed. He despises politics,
does not believe that any good can come out of Parliament&mdash;he
had been a Parliamentary shorthand writer, which was no doubt a
disillusioning experience&mdash;and he is slightly hostile to the
most hopeful movement of his day, trade unionism. In <i>Hard
Times</i> trade unionism is represented as something not much
better than a racket, something that happens because employers are
not sufficiently paternal. Stephen Blackpool's refusal to join the
union is rather a virtue in Dickens's eyes. Also, as Mr. Jackson
has pointed out, the apprentices' association in <i>Barnaby
Rudge</i>, to which Sim Tappertit belongs, is probably a hit at the
illegal or barely legal unions of Dickens's own day, with their
secret assemblies, passwords and so forth. Obviously he wants the
workers to be decently treated, but there is no sign that he wants
them to take their destiny into their own hands, least of all by
open violence.</p>

<p>As it happens, Dickens deals with revolution in the narrower
sense in two novels, <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> and <i>A Tale of Two
Cities</i>. In <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> it is a case of rioting rather
than revolution. The Gordon Riots of 1780, though they had
religious bigotry as a pretext, seem to have been little more than
a pointless outburst of looting. Dickens's attitude to this kind of
thing is sufficiently indicated by the fact that his first idea was
to make the ringleaders of the riots three lunatics escaped from an
asylum. He was dissuaded from this, but the principal figure of the
book is in fact a village idiot. In the chapters dealing with the
riots Dickens shows a most profound horror of mob violence. He
delights in describing scenes in which the 'dregs' of the
population behave with atrocious bestiality. These chapters are of
great psychological interest, because they show how deeply he had
brooded on this subject. The things he describes can only have come
out of his imagination, for no riots on anything like the same
scale had happened in his lifetime. Here is one of his
descriptions, for instance:</p>

<p>If Bedlam gates had been flung open wide, there would not have
issued forth such maniacs as the frenzy of that night had made.
There were men there who danced and trampled on the beds of flowers
as though they trod down human enemies, and wrenched them from
their stalks, like savages who twisted human necks. There were men
who cast their lighted torches in the air, and suffered them to
fall upon their heads and faces, blistering the skin with deep
unseemly burns. There were men who rushed up to the fire, and
paddled in it with their hands as if in water; and others who were
restrained by force from plunging in, to gratify their deadly
longing. On the skull of one drunken lad&mdash;not twenty, by his
looks&mdash;who lay upon the ground with a bottle to his mouth, the
lead from the roof came streaming down in a shower of liquid fire,
white hot, melting his head like wax...But of all the howling
throng not one learnt mercy from, or sickened at, these sights; nor
was the fierce, besotted, senseless rage of one man glutted.</p>

<p>You might almost think you were reading a description of 'Red'
Spain by a partisan of General Franco. One ought, of course, to
remember that when Dickens was writing, the London 'mob' still
existed. (Nowadays there is no mob, only a flock.) Low wages and
the growth and shift of population had brought into existence a
huge, dangerous slum-proletariat, and until the early middle of the
nineteenth century there was hardly such a thing as a police force.
When the brickbats began to fly there was nothing between
shuttering your windows and ordering the troops to open fire. In
<i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> he is dealing with a revolution which
was really about something, and Dickens's attitude is different,
but not entirely different. As a matter of fact, <i>A Tale of Two
Cities</i> is a book which tends to leave a false impression
behind, especially after a lapse of time.</p>

<p>The one thing that everyone who has read <i>A Tale of Two
Cities</i> remembers is the Reign of Terror. The whole book is
dominated by the guillotine&mdash;tumbrils thundering to and fro,
bloody knives, heads bouncing into the basket, and sinister old
women knitting as they watch. Actually these scenes only occupy a
few chapters, but they are written with terrible intensity, and the
rest of the book is rather slow going. But <i>A Tale of Two
Cities</i> is not a companion volume to <i>The Scarlet
Pimpernel</i>. Dickens sees clearly enough that the French
Revolution was bound to happen and that many of the people who were
executed deserved what they got. If, he says, you behave as the
French aristocracy had behaved, vengeance will follow. He repeats
this over and over again. We are constantly being reminded that
while 'my lord' is lolling in bed, with four liveried footmen
serving his chocolate and the peasants starving outside, somewhere
in the forest a tree is growing which will presently be sawn into
planks for the platform of the guillotine, etc., etc., etc. The
inevitability of the Terror, given its causes, is insisted upon in
the clearest terms:</p>

<p>It was too much the way...to talk of this terrible Revolution as
if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not
been sown&mdash;as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be
done, that had led to it&mdash;as if observers of the wretched
millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that
should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably
coming, years before, and had not in plain terms recorded what they
saw.</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>All the devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since
imagination could record itself, are fused in the one realization,
Guillotine. And yet there is not in France, with its rich variety
of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a spring, a
peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more
certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush humanity
out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist
itself into the same tortured forms.</p>

<p>In other words, the French aristocracy had dug their own graves.
But there is no perception here of what is now called historic
necessity. Dickens sees that the results are inevitable, given the
causes, but he thinks that the causes might have been avoided. The
Revolution is something that happens because centuries of
oppression have made the French peasantry sub-human. If the wicked
nobleman could somehow have turned over a new leaf, like Scrooge,
there would have been no Revolution, no <i>Jacquerie</i>, no
guillotine&mdash;and so much the better. This is the opposite of
the 'revolutionary' attitude. From the 'revolutionary' point of
view the class-struggle is the main source of progress, and
therefore the nobleman who robs the peasant and goads him to revolt
is playing a necessary part, just as much as the Jacobin who
guillotines the nobleman. Dickens never writes anywhere a line that
can be interpreted as meaning this. Revolution as he sees it is
merely a monster that is begotten by tyranny and always ends by
devouring its own instruments. In Sydney Carton's vision at the
foot of the guillotine, he foresees Defarge and the other leading
spirits of the Terror all perishing under the same
knife&mdash;which, in fact, was approximately what happened.</p>

<p>And Dickens is very sure that revolution is a monster. That is
why everyone remembers the revolutionary scenes in <i>A Tale of Two
Cities</i>; they have the quality of nightmare, and it is Dickens's
own nightmare. Again and again he insists upon the meaningless
horrors of revolution&mdash;the mass-butcheries, the injustice, the
ever-present terror of spies, the frightful blood-lust of the mob.
The descriptions of the Paris mob&mdash;the description, for
instance, of the crowd of murderers struggling round the grindstone
to sharpen their weapons before butchering the prisoners in the
September massacres&mdash;outdo anything in <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>.
The revolutionaries appear to him simply as degraded
savages&mdash;in fact, as lunatics. He broods over their frenzies
with a curious imaginative intensity. He describes them dancing the
'Carmagnole', for instance:</p>

<p>There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and they were
dancing like five thousand demons...They danced to the popular
Revolution song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing
of teeth in unison... They advanced, retreated, struck at one
another's hands, clutched at one another's heads, spun round alone,
caught one another, and spun around in pairs, until many of them
dropped...Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time
afresh, forming into lines the width of the public way, and, with
their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped screaming
off. No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance. It
was so emphatically a fallen sport&mdash;a something, once
innocent, delivered over to all devilry.</p>

<p>He even credits some of these wretches with a taste for
guillotining children. The passage I have abridged above ought to
be read in full. It and others like it show how deep was Dickens's
horror of revolutionary hysteria. Notice, for instance that touch,
'with their heads low down and their hands high up', etc., and the
evil vision it conveys. Madame Defarge is a truly dreadful figure,
certainly Dickens's most successful attempt at a <i>malignant</i>
character. Defarge and others are simply 'the new oppressors who
have risen in the destruction of the old', the revolutionary courts
are presided over by 'the lowest, cruellest and worst populace',
and so on and so forth. All the way through Dickens insists upon
the nightmare insecurity of a revolutionary period, and in this he
shows a great deal of prescience. 'A law of the suspected, which
struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over
any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons
gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain
no hearing'&mdash;it would apply pretty accurately to several
countries today.</p>

<p>The apologists of any revolution generally try to minimize its
horrors; Dickens's impulse is to exaggerate them&mdash;and from a
historical point of view he has certainly exaggerated. Even the
Reign of Terror was a much smaller thing than he makes it appear.
Though he quotes no figures, he gives the impression of a frenzied
massacre lasting for years, whereas in reality the whole of the
Terror, so far as the number of deaths goes, was a joke compared
with one of Napoleon's battles. But the bloody knives and the
tumbrils rolling to and fro create in his mind a special sinister
vision which he has succeeded in passing on to generations of
readers. Thanks to Dickens, the very word 'tumbril' has a murderous
sound; one forgets that a tumbril is only a sort of farm-cart. To
this day, to the average Englishman, the French Revolution means no
more than a pyramid of severed heads. It is a strange thing that
Dickens, much more in sympathy with the ideas of the Revolution
than most Englishmen of his time, should have played a part in
creating this impression.</p>

<p>If you hate violence and don't believe in politics, the only
remedy remaining is education. Perhaps society is past praying for,
but there is always hope for the individual human being, if you can
catch him young enough. This belief partly accounts for Dickens's
preoccupation with childhood.</p>

<p>No one, at any rate no English writer, has written better about
childhood than Dickens. In spite of all the knowledge that has
accumulated since, in spite of the fact that children are now
comparatively sanely treated, no novelist has shown the same power
of entering into the child's point of view. I must have been about
nine years old when I first read <i>David Copperfield</i>. The
mental atmosphere of the opening chapters was so immediately
intelligible to me that I vaguely imagined they had been written
<i>by a child</i>. And yet when one re-reads the book as an adult
and sees the Murdstones, for instance, dwindle from gigantic
figures of doom into semi-comic monsters, these passages lose
nothing. Dickens has been able to stand both inside and outside the
child's mind, in such a way that the same scene can be wild
burlesque or sinister reality, according to the age at which one
reads it. Look, for instance, at the scene in which David
Copperfield is unjustly suspected of eating the mutton chops; or
the scene in which Pip, in <i>Great Expectations</i>, coming back
from Miss Havisham's house and finding himself completely unable to
describe what he has seen, takes refuge in a series of outrageous
lies&mdash;which, of course, are eagerly believed. All the
isolation of childhood is there. And how accurately he has recorded
the mechanisms of the child's mind, its visualizing tendency, its
sensitiveness to certain kinds of impression. Pip relates how in
his childhood his ideas about his dead parents were derived from
their tombstones:</p>

<p>The shape of the letters on my father's, gave me an odd idea
that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From
the character and turn of the inscription, 'ALSO GEORGIANA, WIFE OF
THE ABOVE', I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was
freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a
foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside
their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers
of mine...I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that
they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their
trouser-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of
existence.</p>

<p>There is a similar passage in <i>David Copperfield</i>. After
biting Mr. Murdstone's hand, David is sent away to school and
obliged to wear on his back a placard saying, 'Take care of him. He
bites.' He looks at the door in the playground where the boys have
carved their names, and from the appearance of each name he seems
to know in just what tone of voice the boy will read out the
placard:</p>

<p>There was one boy&mdash;a certain J. Steerforth&mdash;who cut
his name very deep and very often, who, I conceived, would read it
in a rather strong voice, and afterwards pull my hair. There was
another boy, one Tommy Traddles, who I dreaded would make game of
it, and pretend to be dreadfully frightened of me. There was a
third, George Demple, who I fancied would sing it.</p>

<p>When I read this passage as a child, it seemed to me that those
were exactly the pictures that those particular names would call
up. The reason, of course, is the sound-associations of the words
(Demple&mdash;'temple'; Traddles&mdash;probably 'skedaddle'). But
how many people, before Dickens, had ever noticed such things? A
sympathetic attitude towards children was a much rarer thing in
Dickens's day than it is now. The early nineteenth century was not
a good time to be a child. In Dickens's youth children were still
being 'solemnly tried at a criminal bar, where they were held up to
be seen', and it was not so long since boys of thirteen had been
hanged for petty theft. The doctrine of 'breaking the child's
spirit' was in full vigour, and <i>The Fairchild Family</i> was a
standard book for children till late into the century. This evil
book is now issued in pretty-pretty expurgated editions, but it is
well worth reading in the original version. It gives one some idea
of the lengths to which child-discipline was sometimes carried. Mr.
Fairchild, for instance, when he catches his children quarrelling,
first thrashes them, reciting Dr. Watts's 'Let dogs delight to bark
and bite' between blows of the cane, and then takes them to spend
the afternoon beneath a gibbet where the rotting corpse of a
murderer is hanging. In the earlier part of the century scores of
thousands of children, aged sometimes as young as six, were
literally worked to death in the mines or cotton mills, and even at
the fashionable public schools boys were flogged till they ran with
blood for a mistake in their Latin verses. One thing which Dickens
seems to have recognized, and which most of his contemporaries did
not, is the sadistic sexual element in flogging. I think this can
be inferred from <i>David Copperfield</i> and <i>Nicholas
Nickleby</i>. But mental cruelty to a child infuriates him as much
as physical, and though there is a fair number of exceptions, his
schoolmasters are generally scoundrels.</p>

<p>Except for the universities and the big public schools, every
kind of education then existing in England gets a mauling at
Dickens's hands. There is Doctor Blimber's Academy, where little
boys are blown up with Greek until they burst, and the revolting
charity schools of the period, which produced specimens like Noah
Claypole and Uriah Heep, and Salem House, and Dotheboys Hall, and
the disgraceful little dame-school kept by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt.
Some of what Dickens says remains true even today. Salem House is
the ancestor of the modern 'prep school', which still has a good
deal of resemblance to it; and as for Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, some
old fraud of much the same stamp is carrying on at this moment in
nearly every small town in England. But, as usual, Dickens's
criticism is neither creative nor destructive. He sees the idiocy
of an educational system founded on the Greek lexicon and the
wax-ended cane; on the other hand, he has no use for the new kind
of school that is coming up in the fifties and sixties, the
'modern' school, with its gritty insistence on 'facts'. What, then,
<i>does</i> he want? As always, what he appears to want is a
moralized version of the existing thing&mdash;the old type of
school, but with no caning, no bullying or underfeeding, and not
quite so much Greek. Doctor Strong's school, to which David
Copperfield goes after he escapes from Murdstone &amp; Grinby's, is
simply Salem House with the vices left out and a good deal of 'old
grey stones' atmosphere thrown in:</p>

<p>Doctor Strong's was an excellent school, as different from Mr.
Creakle's as good is from evil. It was very gravely and decorously
ordered, and on a sound system; with an appeal, in everything, to
the honour and good faith of the boys...which worked wonders. We
all felt that we had a part in the management of the place, and in
sustaining its character and dignity. Hence, we soon became warmly
attached to it&mdash;I am sure I did for one, and I never knew, in
all my time, of any boy being otherwise&mdash;and learnt with a
good will, desiring to do it credit. We had noble games out of
hours, and plenty of liberty; but even then, as I remember, we were
well spoken of in the town, and rarely did any disgrace, by our
appearance or manner, to the reputation of Doctor Strong and Doctor
Strong's boys.</p>

<p>In the woolly vagueness of this passage one can see Dickens's
utter lack of any educational theory. He can imagine the
<i>moral</i> atmosphere of a good school, but nothing further. The
boys 'learnt with a good will', but what did they learn? No doubt
it was Doctor Blimber's curriculum, a little watered down.
Considering the attitude to society that is everywhere implied in
Dickens's novels, it comes as rather a shock to learn that he sent
his eldest son to Eton and sent all his children through the
ordinary educational mill. Gissing seems to think that he may have
done this because he was painfully conscious of being
under-educated himself. Here perhaps Gissing is influenced by his
own love of classical learning. Dickens had had little or no formal
education, but he lost nothing by missing it, and on the whole he
seems to have been aware of this. If he was unable to imagine a
better school than Doctor Strong's, or, in real life, than Eton, it
was probably due to an intellectual deficiency rather different
from the one Gissing suggests.</p>

<p>It seems that in every attack Dickens makes upon society he is
always pointing to a change of spirit rather than a change of
structure. It is hopeless to try and pin him down to any definite
remedy, still more to any political doctrine. His approach is
always along the moral plane, and his attitude is sufficiently
summed up in that remark about Strong's school being as different
from Creakle's 'as good is from evil'. Two things can be very much
alike and yet abysmally different. Heaven and Hell are in the same
place. Useless to change institutions without a 'change of
heart'&mdash;that, essentially, is what he is always saying.</p>

<p>If that were all, he might be no more than a cheer-up writer, a
reactionary humbug. A 'change of heart' is in fact <i>the</i> alibi
of people who do not wish to endanger the <i>status quo</i>. But
Dickens is not a humbug, except in minor matters, and the strongest
single impression one carries away from his books is that of a
hatred of tyranny. I said earlier that Dickens is not <i>in the
accepted sense</i> a revolutionary writer. But it is not at all
certain that a merely moral criticism of society may not be just as
'revolutionary'&mdash;and revolution, after all, means turning
things upside down&mdash;as the politico-economic criticism which
is fashionable at this moment. Blake was not a politician, but
there is more understanding of the nature of capitalist society in
a poem like 'I wander through each charted street' than in
three-quarters of Socialist literature. Progress is not an
illusion, it happens, but it is slow and invariably disappointing.
There is always a new tyrant waiting to take over from the
old&mdash;generally not quite so bad, but still a tyrant.
Consequently two viewpoints are always tenable. The one, how can
you improve human nature until you have changed the system? The
other, what is the use of changing the system before you have
improved human nature? They appeal to different individuals, and
they probably show a tendency to alternate in point of time. The
moralist and the revolutionary are constantly undermining one
another. Marx exploded a hundred tons of dynamite beneath the
moralist position, and we are still living in the echo of that
tremendous crash. But already, somewhere or other, the sappers are
at work and fresh dynamite is being tamped in place to blow Marx at
the moon. Then Marx, or somebody like him, will come back with yet
more dynamite, and so the process continues, to an end we cannot
yet foresee. The central problem&mdash;how to prevent power from
being abused&mdash;remains unsolved. Dickens, who had not the
vision to see that private property is an obstructive nuisance, had
the vision to see that. 'If men would behave decently the world
would be decent' is not such a platitude as it sounds.</p>

<p><b>II</b>
</p>

<p>More completely than most writers, perhaps, Dickens can be
explained in terms of his social origin, though actually his family
history was not quite what one would infer from his novels. His
father was a clerk in government service, and through his mother's
family he had connexions with both the Army and the Navy. But from
the age of nine onwards he was brought up in London in commercial
surroundings, and generally in an atmosphere of struggling poverty.
Mentally he belongs to the small urban bourgeoisie, and he happens
to be an exceptionally fine specimen of this class, with all the
'points', as it were, very highly developed. That is partly what
makes him so interesting. If one wants a modern equivalent, the
nearest would be H. G. Wells, who has had a rather similar history
and who obviously owes something to Dickens as novelist. Arnold
Bennett was essentially of the same type, but, unlike the other
two, he was a midlander, with an industrial and noncomformist
rather than commercial and Anglican background.</p>

<p>The great disadvantage, and advantage, of the small urban
bourgeois is his limited outlook. He sees the world as a
middle-class world, and everything outside these limits is either
laughable or slightly wicked. On the one hand, he has no contact
with industry or the soil; on the other, no contact with the
governing classes. Anyone who has studied Wells's novels in detail
will have noticed that though he hates the aristocrat like poison,
he has no particular objection to the plutocrat, and no enthusiasm
for the proletarian. His most hated types, the people he believes
to be responsible for all human ills, are kings, landowners,
priests, nationalists, soldiers, scholars and peasants. At first
sight a list beginning with kings and ending with peasants looks
like a mere omnium gatherum, but in reality all these people have a
common factor. All of them are archaic types, people who are
governed by tradition and whose eyes are turned towards the
past&mdash;the opposite, therefore, of the rising bourgeois who has
put his money on the future and sees the past simply as a dead
hand.</p>

<p>Actually, although Dickens lived in a period when the
bourgeoisie was really a rising class, he displays this
characteristic less strongly than Wells. He is almost unconscious
of the future and has a rather sloppy love of the picturesque (the
'quaint old church', etc.). Nevertheless his list of most hated
types is like enough to Wells's for the similarity to be striking.
He is vaguely on the side of the working class&mdash;has a sort of
generalized sympathy with them because they are oppressed&mdash;but
he does not in reality know much about them; they come into his
books chiefly as servants, and comic servants at that. At the other
end of the scale he loathes the aristocrat and&mdash;going one
better than Wells in this loathes the big bourgeois as well. His
real sympathies are bounded by Mr. Pickwick on the upper side and
Mr. Barkis on the lower. But the term 'aristocrat', for the type
Dickens hates, is vague and needs defining.</p>

<p>Actually Dickens's target is not so much the great aristocracy,
who hardly enter into his books, as their petty offshoots, the
cadging dowagers who live up mews in Mayfair, and the bureaucrats
and professional soldiers. All through his books there are countess
hostile sketches of these people, and hardly any that are friendly.
There are practically no friendly pictures of the landowning class,
for instance. One might make a doubtful exception of Sir Leicester
Dedlock; otherwise there is only Mr. Wardle (who is a stock figure
the 'good old squire') and Haredale in <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, who
has Dickens's sympathy because he is a persecuted Catholic. There
are no friendly pictures of soldiers (i.e. officers), and none at
all of naval men. As for his bureaucrats, judges and magistrates,
most of them would feel quite at home in the Circumlocution Office.
The only officials whom Dickens handles with any kind of
friendliness are, significantly enough, policemen.</p>

<p>Dickens's attitude is easily intelligible to an Englishman,
because it is part of the English puritan tradition, which is not
dead even at this day. The class Dickens belonged to, at least by
adoption, was growing suddenly rich after a couple of centuries of
obscurity. It had grown up mainly in the big towns, out of contact
with agriculture, and politically impotent; government, in its
experience, was something which either interfered or persecuted.
Consequently it was a class with no tradition of public service and
not much tradition of usefulness. What now strikes us as remarkable
about the new moneyed class of the nineteenth century is their
complete irresponsibility; they see everything in terms of
individual success, with hardly any consciousness that the
community exists. On the other hand, a Tite Barnacle, even when he
was neglecting his duties, would have some vague notion of what
duties he was neglecting. Dickens's attitude is never
irresponsible, still less does he take the money-grubbing Smilesian
line; but at the back of his mind there is usually a half-belief
that the whole apparatus of government is unnecessary. Parliament
is simply Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle, the Empire is simply
Major Bagstock and his Indian servant, the Army is simply Colonel
Chowser and Doctor Slammer, the public services are simply Bumble
and the Circumlocution Office&mdash;and so on and so forth. What he
does not see, or only intermittently sees, is that Coodle and
Doodle and all the other corpses left over from the eighteenth
century <i>are</i> performing a function which neither Pickwick nor
Boffin would ever bother about.</p>

<p>And of course this narrowness of vision is in one way a great
advantage to him, because it is fatal for a caricaturist to see too
much. From Dickens's point of view 'good' society is simply a
collection of village idiots. What a crew! Lady Tippins! Mrs.
Gowan! Lord Verisopht! The Honourable Bob Stables! Mrs. Sparsit
(whose husband was a Powler)! The Tite Barnacles! Nupkins! It is
practically a case-book in lunacy. But at the same time his
remoteness from the landowning-military-bureaucratic class
incapacitates him for full-length satire. He only succeeds with
this class when he depicts them as mental defectives. The
accusation which used to be made against Dickens in his lifetime,
that he 'could not paint a gentleman', was an absurdity, but it is
true in this sense, that what he says against the 'gentleman' class
is seldom very damaging. Sir Mulberry Hawk, for instance, is a
wretched attempt at the wicked-baronet type. Harthouse in <i>Hard
Times</i> is better, but he would be only an ordinary achievement
for Trollope or Thackeray. Trollope's thoughts hardly move outside
the 'gentleman' class, but Thackeray has the great advantage of
having a foot in two moral camps. In some ways his outlook is very
similar to Dickens's. Like Dickens, he identifies with the
puritanical moneyed class against the card-playing, debt-bilking
aristocracy. The eighteenth century, as he sees it, is sticking out
into the nineteenth in the person of the wicked Lord Steyne.
<i>Vanity Fair</i> is a full-length version of what Dickens did for
a few chapters in <i>Little Dorrit</i>. But by origins and
upbringing Thackeray happens to be somewhat nearer to the class he
is satirizing. Consequently he can produce such comparatively
subtle types as, for instance, Major Pendennis and Rawdon Crawley.
Major Pendennis is a shallow old snob, and Rawdon Crawley is a
thick-headed ruffian who sees nothing wrong in living for years by
swindling tradesmen; but what Thackery realizes is that according
to their tortuous code they are neither of them bad men. Major
Pendennis would not sign a dud cheque, for instance; Rawdon
certainly would, but on the other hand he would not desert a friend
in a tight corner. Both of them would behave well on the field of
battle&mdash;a thing that would not particularly appeal to Dickens.
The result is that at the end one is left with a kind of amused
tolerance for Major Pendennis and with something approaching
respect for Rawdon; and yet one sees, better than any diatribe
could make one, the utter rottenness of that kind of cadging,
toadying life on the fringes of smart society. Dickens would be
quite incapable of this. In his hands both Rawdon and the Major
would dwindle to traditional caricatures. And, on the whole, his
attacks on 'good' society are rather perfunctory. The aristocracy
and the big bourgeoisie exist in his books chiefly as a kind of
'noises off', a haw-hawing chorus somewhere in the wings, like
Podsnap's dinner-parties. When he produces a really subtle and
damaging portrait, like John Dorrit or Harold Skimpole, it is
generally of some rather middling, unimportant person.</p>

<p>One very striking thing about Dickens, especially considering
the time he lived in, is his lack of vulgar nationalism. All
peoples who have reached the point of becoming nations tend to
despise foreigners, but there is not much doubt that the
English-speaking races are the worst offenders. One can see this
from the fact that as soon as they become fully aware of any
foreign race they invent an insulting nickname for it. Wop, Dago,
Froggy, Squarehead, Kike, Sheeny, Nigger, Wog, Chink, Greaser,
Yellowbelly&mdash;these are merely a selection. Any time before
1870 the list would have been shorter, because the map of the world
was different from what it is now, and there were only three or
four foreign races that had fully entered into the English
consciousness. But towards these, and especially towards France,
the nearest and best-hated nation, the English attitude of
patronage was so intolerable that English 'arrogance' and
'xenophobia' are still a legend. And of course they are not a
completely untrue legend even now. Till very recently nearly all
English children were brought up to despise the southern European
races, and history as taught in schools was mainly a list of
battles won by England. But one has got to read, say, the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> of the thirties to know what boasting
really is. Those were the days when the English built up their
legend of themselves as 'sturdy islanders' and 'stubborn hearts of
oak' and when it was accepted as a kind of scientific fact that one
Englishman was the equal of three foreigners. All through
nineteenth-century novels and comic papers there runs the
traditional figure of the 'Froggy'&mdash;a small ridiculous man
with a tiny beard and a pointed top-hat, always jabbering and
gesticulating, vain, frivolous and fond of boasting of his martial
exploits, but generally taking to flight when real danger appears.
Over against him was John Bull, the 'sturdy English yeoman', or (a
more public-school version) the 'strong, silent Englishman' of
Charles Kingsley, Tom Hughes and others.</p>

<p>Thackeray, for instance, has this outlook very strongly, though
there are moments when he sees through it and laughs at it. The one
historical fact that is firmly fixed in his mind is that the
English won the battle of Waterloo. One never reads far in his
books without coming upon some reference to it. The English, as he
sees it, are invincible because of their tremendous physical
strength, due mainly to living on beef. Like most Englishmen of his
time, he has the curious illusion that the English are larger than
other people (Thackeray, as it happened, was larger than most
people), and therefore he is capable of writing passages like
this:</p>

<p>I say to you that you are better than a Frenchman. I would lay
even money that you who are reading this are more than five feet
seven in height, and weigh eleven stone; while a Frenchman is five
feet four and does not weigh nine. The Frenchman has after his soup
a dish of vegetables, where you have one of meat. You are a
different and superior animal&mdash;a French-beating animal (the
history of hundreds of years has shown you to be so), etc. etc.</p>

<p>There are similar passages scattered all through Thackeray's
works. Dickens would never be guilty of anything of that kind. It
would be an exaggeration to say that he nowhere pokes fun at
foreigners, and of course like nearly all nineteenth-century
Englishmen, he is untouched by European culture. But never anywhere
does he indulge in the typical English boasting, the 'island race',
'bulldog breed', 'right little, tight little island' style of talk.
In the whole of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> there is not a line
that could be taken as meaning, 'Look how these wicked Frenchmen
behave!' The only place where he seems to display a normal hatred
of foreigners is in the American chapters of <i>Martin
Chuzzlewit</i>. This, however, is simply the reaction of a generous
mind against cant. If Dickens were alive today he would make a trip
to Soviet Russia and come back to the book rather like Gide's
<i>Retour de L'urss</i>. But he is remarkably free from the idiocy
of regarding nations as individuals. He seldom even makes jokes
turning on nationality. He does not exploit the comic Irishman and
the comic Welshman, for instance, and not because he objects to
stock characters and ready-made jokes, which obviously he does not.
It is perhaps more significant that he shows no prejudice against
Jews. It is true that he takes it for granted (<i>Oliver Twist</i>
and <i>Great Expectations</i>) that a receiver of stolen goods will
be a Jew, which at the time was probably justified. But the 'Jew
joke', endemic in English literature until the rise of Hitler, does
not appear in his books, and in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> he makes a
pious though not very convincing attempt to stand up for the
Jews.</p>

<p>Dickens's lack of vulgar nationalism is in part the mark of a
real largeness of mind, and in part results from his negative,
rather unhelpful political attitude. He is very much an Englishman
but he is hardly aware of it&mdash;certainly the thought of being
an Englishman does not thrill him. He has no imperialist feelings,
no discernible views on foreign politics, and is untouched by the
military tradition. Temperamentally he is much nearer to the small
noncomformist tradesman who looks down on the 'redcoats', and
thinks that war is wicked&mdash;a one-eyed view, but after all, war
is wicked. It is noticeable that Dickens hardly writes of war, even
to denounce it. With all his marvellous powers of description, and
of describing things he had never seen, he never describes a
battle, unless one counts the attack on the Bastille in <i>A Tale
of Two Cities</i>. Probably the subject would not strike him as
interesting, and in any case he would not regard a battlefield as a
place where anything worth settling could be settled. It is one up
to the lower-middle-class, puritan mentality.</p>

<p><b>III</b>
</p>

<p>Dickens had grown up near enough to poverty to be terrified of
it, and in spite of his generosity of mind, he is not free from the
special prejudices of the shabby-genteel. It is usual to claim him
as a 'popular' writer, a champion of the 'oppressed masses'. So he
is, so long as he thinks of them as oppressed; but there are two
things that condition his attitude. In the first place, he is a
south-of-England man, and a Cockney at that, and therefore out of
touch with the bulk of the real oppressed masses, the industrial
and agricultural labourers. It is interesting to see how
Chesterton, another Cockney, always presents Dickens as the
spokesman of 'the poor', without showing much awareness of who 'the
poor' really are. To Chesterton 'the poor' means small shopkeepers
and servants. Sam Weller, he says, 'is the great symbol in English
literature of the populace peculiar to England'; and Sam Weller is
a valet! The other point is that Dickens's early experiences have
given him a horror of proletarian roughness. He shows this
unmistakably whenever he writes of the very poorest of the poor,
the slum-dwellers. His descriptions of the London slums are always
full of undisguised repulsion:</p>

<p>The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched;
and people half naked, drunken, slipshod and ugly. Alleys and
archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of
smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the
whole quarter reeked with crime, and filth, and misery, etc.
etc.</p>

<p>There are many similar passages in Dickens. From them one gets
the impression of whole submerged populations whom he regards as
being beyond the pale. In rather the same way the modern
doctrinaire Socialist contemptuously writes off a large block of
the population as 'lumpenproletariat'.</p>

<p>Dickens also shows less understanding of criminals than one
would expect of him. Although he is well aware of the social and
economic causes of crime, he often seems to feel that when a man
has once broken the law he has put himself outside human society.
There is a chapter at the end of <i>David Copperfield</i> in which
David visits the prison where Latimer and Uriah Heep are serving
their sentences. Dickens actually seems to regard the horrible
'model' prisons, against which Charles Reade delivered his
memorable attack in <i>It Is Never Too Late To Mend</i>, as too
humane. He complains that the food is too good! As soon as he comes
up against crime or the worst depths of poverty, he shows traces of
the 'I've always kept myself respectable' habit of mind. The
attitude of Pip (obviously the attitude of Dickens himself) towards
Magwitch in <i>Great Expectations</i> is extremely interesting. Pip
is conscious all along of his ingratitude towards Joe, but far less
so of his ingratitude towards Magwitch. When he discovers that the
person who has loaded him with benefits for years is actually a
transported convict, he falls into frenzies of disgust. 'The
abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the
repugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been
exceeded if he had been some terrible beast', etc. etc. So far as
one can discover from the text, this is not because when Pip was a
child he had been terrorized by Magwitch in the churchyard; it is
because Magwitch is a criminal and a convict. There is an even more
'kept-myself-respectable' touch in the fact that Pip feels as a
matter of course that he cannot take Magwitch's money. The money is
not the product of a crime, it has been honestly acquired; but it
is an ex-convict's money and therefore 'tainted'. There is nothing
psychologically false in this, either. Psychologically the latter
part of <i>Great Expectations</i> is about the best thing Dickens
ever did; throughout this part of the book one feels 'Yes, that is
just how Pip would have behaved.' But the point is that in the
matter of Magwitch, Dickens identifies with Pip, and his attitude
is at bottom snobbish. The result is that Magwitch belongs to the
same queer class of characters as Falstaff and, probably, Don
Quixote&mdash;characters who are more pathetic than the author
intended.</p>

<p>When it is a question of the non-criminal poor, the ordinary,
decent, labouring poor, there is of course nothing contemptuous in
Dickens's attitude. He has the sincerest admiration for people like
the Peggottys and the Plornishes. But it is questionable whether he
really regards them as equals. It is of the greatest interest to
read Chapter XI of <i>David Copperfield</i> and side by side with
it the autobiographical fragments (parts of this are given in
Forster's <i>Life</i>), in which Dickens expresses his feelings
about the blacking-factory episode a great deal more strongly than
in the novel. For more than twenty years afterwards the memory was
so painful to him that he would go out of his way to avoid that
part of the Strand. He says that to pass that way 'made me cry,
after my eldest child could speak.' The text makes it quite clear
that what hurt him most of all, then and in retrospect, was the
enforced contact with 'low' associates:</p>

<p>No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into
this companionship; compared these everyday associates with those
of my happier childhood. But I held some station at the blacking
warehouse too...I soon became at least as expeditious and as
skilful with my hands as either of the other boys. Though perfectly
familiar with them, my conduct and manners were different enough
from theirs to place a space between us. They, and the men, always
spoke of me as 'the young gentleman'. A certain man...used to call
me 'Charles' sometimes in speaking to me; but I think it was mostly
when we were very confidential...Poll Green uprose once, and
rebelled against the 'young-gentleman' usage; but Bob Fagin settled
him speedily.</p>

<p>It was as well that there should be 'a space between us', you
see. However much Dickens may admire the working classes, he does
not wish to resemble them. Given his origins, and the time he lived
in, it could hardly be otherwise. In the early nineteenth century
class animosities may have been no sharper than they are now, but
the surface differences between class and class were enormously
greater. The 'gentleman' and the 'common man' must have seemed like
different species of animal. Dickens is quite genuinely on the side
of the poor against the rich, but it would be next door to
impossible for him not to think of a working-class exterior as a
stigma. In one of Tolstoy's fables the peasants of a certain
village judge every stranger who arrives from the state of his
hands. If his palms are hard from work, they let him in; if his
palms are soft, out he goes. This would be hardly intelligible to
Dickens; all his heroes have soft hands. His younger
heroes&mdash;Nicholas Nickleby, Martin Chuzzlewit, Edward Chester,
David Copperfield, John Harmon&mdash;are usually of the type known
as 'walking gentlemen'. He likes a bourgeois exterior and a
bourgeois (not aristocratic) accent. One curious symptom of this is
that he will not allow anyone who is to play a heroic part to speak
like a working man. A comic hero like Sam Weller, or a merely
pathetic figure like Stephen Blackpool, can speak with a broad
accent, but the <i>jeune premier</i> always speaks the equivalent
of B.B.C. This is so, even when it involves absurdities. Little
Pip, for instance, is brought up by people speaking broad Essex,
but talks upper-class English from his earliest childhood; actually
he would have talked the same dialect as Joe, or at least as Mrs.
Gargery. So also with Biddy Wopsle, Lizzie Hexam, Sissie Jupe,
Oliver Twist&mdash;one ought perhaps to add Little Dorrit. Even
Rachel in <i>Hard Times</i> has barely a trace of Lancashire
accent, an impossibility in her case.</p>

<p>One thing that often gives the clue to a novelist's real
feelings on the class question is the attitude he takes up when
class collides with sex. This is a thing too painful to be lied
about, and consequently it is one of the points at which the
'I'm-not-a-snob' pose tends to break down.</p>

<p>One sees that at its most obvious where a class-distinction is
also a colour-distinction. And something resembling the colonial
attitude ('native' women are fair game, white women are sacrosanct)
exists in a veiled form in all-white communities, causing bitter
resentment on both sides. When this issue arises, novelists often
revert to crude class-feelings which they might disclaim at other
times. A good example of 'class-conscious' reaction is a rather
forgotten novel, <i>The People of Clopton</i>, by Andrew Barton.
The author's moral code is quite clearly mixed up with
class-hatred. He feels the seduction of a poor girl by a rich man
to be something atrocious, a kind of defilement, something quite
different from her seduction by a man in her own walk of life.
Trollope deals with this theme twice (<i>The Three Clerks</i> and
<i>The Small House at Allington</i>) and, as one might expect,
entirely from the upper-class angle. As he sees it, an affair with
a barmaid or a landlady's daughter is simply an 'entanglement' to
be escaped from. Trollope's moral standards are strict, and he does
not allow the seduction actually to happen, but the implication is
always that a working-class girl's feelings do not greatly matter.
In <i>The Three Clerks</i> he even gives the typical class-reaction
by noting that the girl 'smells'. Meredith (<i>Rhoda Fleming</i>)
takes more the 'class-conscious' viewpoint. Thackeray, as often,
seems to hesitate. In <i>Pendennis</i> (Fanny Bolton) his attitude
is much the same as Trollope's; in <i>A Shabby Genteel Story</i> it
is nearer to Meredith's.</p>

<p>One could divine a great deal about Trollope's social origin, or
Meredith's, or Barton's, merely from their handling of the
class-sex theme. So one can with Dickens, but what emerges, as
usual, is that he is more inclined to identify himself with the
middle class than with the proletariat. The one incident that seems
to contradict this is the tale of the young peasant-girl in Doctor
Manette's manuscript in <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. This, however,
is merely a costume-piece put in to explain the implacable hatred
of Madame Defarge, which Dickens does not pretend to approve of. In
<i>David Copperfield</i>, where he is dealing with a typical
nineteenth-century seduction, the class-issue does not seem to
strike him as paramount. It is a law of Victorian novels that
sexual misdeeds must not go unpunished, and so Steerforth is
drowned on Yarmouth sands, but neither Dickens, nor old Peggotty,
nor even Ham, seems to feel that Steerforth has added to his
offence by being the son of rich parents. The Steerforths are moved
by class-motives, but the Peggottys are not&mdash;not even in the
scene between Mrs. Steerforth and old Peggotty; if they were, of
course, they would probably turn against David as well as against
Steerforth.</p>

<p>In <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> Dickens treats the episode of Eugene
Wrayburn and Lizzie Hexam very realistically and with no appearance
of class bias. According to the 'Unhand me, monster!' tradition,
Lizzie ought either to 'spurn' Eugene or to be ruined by him and
throw herself off Waterloo Bridge: Eugene ought to be either a
heartless betrayer or a hero resolved upon defying society. Neither
behaves in the least like this. Lizzie is frightened by Eugene's
advances and actually runs away from him, but hardly pretends to
dislike them; Eugene is attracted by her, has too much decency to
attempt seducing her and dare not marry her because of his family.
Finally they are married and no one is any the worse, except Mrs.
Twemlow, who will lose a few dinner engagements. It is all very
much as it might have happened in real life. But a
'class-conscious' novelist would have given her to Bradley
Headstone.</p>

<p>But when it is the other way about&mdash;when it is a case of a
poor man aspiring to some woman who is 'above' him Dickens
instantly retreats into the middle-class attitude. He is rather
fond of the Victorian notion of a woman (woman with a capital W)
being 'above' a man. Pip feels that Estella is 'above' him, Esther
Summerson is 'above' Guppy, Little Dorrit is 'above' John Chivery,
Lucy Manette is 'above' Sydney Carton. In some of these the
'above'-ness is merely moral, but in others it is social. There is
a scarcely mistakable class-reaction when David Copperfield
discovers that Uriah Heep is plotting to marry Agnes Wickfield. The
disgusting Uriah suddenly announces that he is in love with
her:</p>

<p>'Oh, Master Copperfield, with what a pure affection do I love
the ground my Agnes walks on.'</p>

<p>I believe I had the delirious idea of seizing the red-hot poker
out of the fire, and running him through with it. It went from me
with a shock, like a ball fired from a rifle: but the image of
Agnes, outraged by so much as a thought of this red-headed
animal's, remained in my mind (when I looked at him, sitting all
awry as if his mean soul griped his body) and made me giddy...'I
believe Agnes Wickfield to be as far above you (David says later
on), and as far removed from all your aspirations, as the moon
herself.'</p>

<p>Considering how Heep's general lowness&mdash;his servile
manners, dropped aitches and so forth&mdash;has been rubbed in
throughout the book, there is not much doubt about the nature of
Dickens's feelings. Heep, of course, is playing a villainous part,
but even villains have sexual lives; it is the thought of the
'pure' Agnes in bed with a man who drops his aitches that really
revolts Dickens. But his usual tendency is to treat a man in love
with a woman who is 'above' him as a joke. It is one of the stock
jokes of English literature, from Malvolio onwards. Guppy in
<i>Bleak House</i> is an example, John Chivery is another, and
there is a rather ill-natured treatment of this theme in the
'swarry' in <i>Pickwick Papers</i>. Here Dickens describes the Bath
footmen as living a kind of fantasy-life, holding dinner-parties in
imitation of their 'betters' and deluding themselves that their
young mistresses are in love with them. This evidently strikes him
as very comic. So it is in a way, though one might question whether
it is not better for a footman even to have delusions of this kind
than simply to accept his status in the spirit of the
catechism.</p>

<p>In his attitude towards servants Dickens is not ahead of his
age. In the nineteenth century the revolt against domestic service
was just beginning, to the great annoyance of everyone with over
&pound;500 a year. An enormous number of the jokes in
nineteenth-century comic papers deals with the uppishness of
servants. For years <i>Punch</i> ran a series of jokes called
'Servant Gal-isms', all turning on the then astonishing fact that a
servant is a human being. Dickens is sometimes guilty of this kind
of thing himself. His books abound with the ordinary comic
servants; they are dishonest (<i>Great Expectations</i>),
incompetent (<i>David Copperfield</i>), turn up their noses at good
food (<i>Pickwick Papers</i>), etc. etc.&mdash;all rather in the
spirit of the suburban housewife with one downtrodden cook-general.
But what is curious, in a nineteenth-century radical, is that when
he wants to draw a sympathetic picture of a servant, he creates
what is recognizably a feudal type. Sam Weller, Mark Tapley, Clara
Peggotty are all of them feudal figures. They belong to the genre
of the 'old family retainer'; they identify themselves with their
master's family and are at once doggishly faithful and completely
familiar. No doubt Mark Tapley and Sam Weller are derived to some
extent from Smollett, and hence from Cervantes; but it is
interesting that Dickens should have been attracted by such a type.
Sam Weller's attitude is definitely medieval. He gets himself
arrested in order to follow Mr. Pickwick into the Fleet, and
afterwards refuses to get married because he feels that Mr.
Pickwick still needs his services. There is a characteristic scene
between them:</p>

<p>'Vages or no vages, board or no board, lodgin' or no lodgin',
Sam Veller, as you took from the old inn in the Borough, sticks by
you, come what may...'</p>

<p>'My good fellow', said Mr. Pickwick, when Mr. Weller had sat
down again, rather abashed at his own enthusiasm, 'you are bound to
consider the young woman also.'</p>

<p>'I do consider the young 'ooman, sir', said Sam. 'I have
considered the young 'ooman. I've spoke to her. I've told her how
I'm sitivated; she's ready to vait till I'm ready, and I believe
she vill. If she don't, she's not the young 'ooman I take her for,
and I give up with readiness.'</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine what the young woman would have said to
this in real life. But notice the feudal atmosphere. Sam Weller is
ready as a matter of course to sacrifice years of his life to his
master, and he can also sit down in his master's presence. A modern
manservant would never think of doing either. Dickens's views on
the servant question do not get much beyond wishing that master and
servant would love one another. Sloppy in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>,
though a wretched failure as a character, represents the same kind
of loyalty as Sam Weller. Such loyalty, of course, is natural,
human, and likeable; but so was feudalism.</p>

<p>What Dickens seems to be doing, as usual, is to reach out for an
idealized version of the existing thing. He was writing at a time
when domestic service must have seemed a completely inevitable
evil. There were no labour-saving devices, and there was huge
inequality of wealth. It was an age of enormous families,
pretentious meals and inconvenient houses, when the slavey drudging
fourteen hours a day in the basement kitchen was something too
normal to be noticed. And given the <i>fact</i> of servitude, the
feudal relationship is the only tolerable one. Sam Weller and Mark
Tapley are dream figures, no less than the Cheerybles. If there
have got to be masters and servants, how much better that the
master should be Mr. Pickwick and the servant should be Sam Weller.
Better still, of course, if servants did not exist at all&mdash;but
this Dickens is probably unable to imagine. Without a high level of
mechanical development, human equality is not practically possible;
Dickens goes to show that it is not imaginable either.</p>

<p><b>IV</b>
</p>

<p>It is not merely a coincidence that Dickens never writes about
agriculture and writes endlessly about food. He was a Cockney, and
London is the centre of the earth in rather the same sense that the
belly is the centre of the body. It is a city of consumers, of
people who are deeply civilized but not primarily useful. A thing
that strikes one when one looks below the surface of Dickens's
books is that, as nineteenth-century novelists go, he is rather
ignorant. He knows very little about the way things really happen.
At first sight this statement looks flatly untrue and it needs some
qualification.</p>

<p>Dickens had had vivid glimpses of 'low life'&mdash;life in a
debtor's prison, for example&mdash;and he was also a popular
novelist and able to write about ordinary people. So were all the
characteristic English novelists of the nineteenth century. They
felt at home in the world they lived in, whereas a writer nowadays
is so hopelessly isolated that the typical modern novel is a novel
about a novelist. Even when Joyce, for instance, spends a decade or
so in patient efforts to make contact with the 'common man', his
'common man' finally turns out to be a Jew, and a bit of a highbrow
at that. Dickens at least does not suffer from this kind of thing.
He has no difficulty in introducing the common motives, love,
ambition, avarice, vengeance and so forth. What he does not
noticeably write about, however, is work.</p>

<p>In Dickens's novels anything in the nature of work happens
off-stage. The only one of his heroes who has a plausible
profession is David Copperfield, who is first a shorthand writer
and then a novelist, like Dickens himself. With most of the others,
the way they earn their living is very much in the background. Pip,
for instance, 'goes into business' in Egypt; we are not told what
business, and Pip's working life occupies about half a page of the
book. Clennam has been in some unspecified business in China, and
later goes into another barely specified business with Doyce;
Martin Chuzzlewit is an architect, but does not seem to get much
time for practising. In no case do their adventures spring directly
out of their work. Here the contrast between Dickens and, say,
Trollope is startling. And one reason for this is undoubtedly that
Dickens knows very little about the professions his characters are
supposed to follow. What exactly went on in Gradgrind's factories?
How did Podsnap make his money? How did Merdle work his swindles?
One knows that Dickens could never follow up the details of
Parliamentary elections and Stock Exchange rackets as Trollope
could. As soon as he has to deal with trade, finance, industry or
politics he takes refuge in vagueness, or in satire. This is the
case even with legal processes, about which actually he must have
known a good deal. Compare any lawsuit in Dickens with the lawsuit
in <i>Orley Farm</i>, for instance.</p>

<p>And this partly accounts for the needless ramifications of
Dickens's novels, the awful Victorian 'plot'. It is true that not
all his novels are alike in this. <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> is a
very good and fairly simple story, and so in its different ways is
<i>Hard Times</i>; but these are just the two which are always
rejected as 'not like Dickens'&mdash;and incidentally they were not
published in monthly numbers. The two first-person novels are also
good stories, apart from their subplots. But the typical Dickens
novel, <i>Nicholas Nickleby, Oliver Twist, Martin Chuzzlewit, Our
Mutual Friend</i>, always exists round a framework of melodrama.
The last thing anyone ever remembers about the books is their
central story. On the other hand, I suppose no one has ever read
them without carrying the memory of individual pages to the day of
his death. Dickens sees human beings with the most intense
vividness, but sees them always in private life, as 'characters',
not as functional members of society; that is to say, he sees them
statically. Consequently his greatest success is The <i>Pickwick
Papers</i>, which is not a story at all, merely a series of
sketches; there is little attempt at development&mdash;the
characters simply go on and on, behaving like idiots, in a kind of
eternity. As soon as he tries to bring his characters into action,
the melodrama begins. He cannot make the action revolve round their
ordinary occupations; hence the crossword puzzle of coincidences,
intrigues, murders, disguises, buried wills, long-lost brothers,
etc. etc. In the end even people like Squeers and Micawber get
sucked into the machinery.</p>

<p>Of course it would be absurd to say that Dickens is a vague or
merely melodramatic writer. Much that he wrote is extremely
factual, and in the power of evoking visual images he has probably
never been equalled. When Dickens has once described something you
see it for the rest of your life. But in a way the concreteness of
his vision is a sign of what he is missing. For, after all, that is
what the merely casual onlooker always sees&mdash;the outward
appearance, the non-functional, the surfaces of things. No one who
is really involved in the landscape ever sees the landscape.
Wonderfully as he can describe an <i>appearance</i>, Dickens does
not often describe a process. The vivid pictures that he succeeds
in leaving in one's memory are nearly always the pictures of things
seen in leisure moments, in the coffee-rooms of country inns or
through the windows of a stage-coach; the kind of things he notices
are inn-signs, brass door-knockers, painted jugs, the interiors of
shops and private houses, clothes, faces and, above all, food.
Everything is seen from the consumer-angle. When he writes about
Cokestown he manages to evoke, in just a few paragraphs, the
atmosphere of a Lancashire town as a slightly disgusted southern
visitor would see it. 'It had a black canal in it, and a river that
ran purple with evil-smelling dye, and vast piles of buildings full
of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long,
where the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and
down, like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy
madness.'</p>

<p>That is as near as Dickens ever gets to the machinery of the
mills. An engineer or a cotton-broker would see it differently; but
then neither of them would be capable of that impressionistic touch
about the heads of the elephants.</p>

<p>In a rather different sense his attitude to life is extremely
unphysical. He is a man who lives through his eyes and ears rather
than through his hands and muscles. Actually his habits were not so
sedentary as this seems to imply. In spite of rather poor health
and physique, he was active to the point of restlessness;
throughout his life he was a remarkable walker, and he could at any
rate carpenter well enough to put up stage scenery. But he was not
one of those people who feel a need to use their hands. It is
difficult to imagine him digging at a cabbage-patch, for instance.
He gives no evidence of knowing anything about agriculture, and
obviously knows nothing about any kind of game or sport. He has no
interest in pugilism, for instance. Considering the age in which he
was writing, it is astonishing how little physical brutality there
is in Dickens's novels. Martin Chuzzlewit and Mark Tapley, for
instance, behave with the most remarkable mildness towards the
Americans who are constantly menacing them with revolvers and
bowie-knives. The average English or American novelist would have
had them handing out socks on the jaw and exchanging pistol-shots
in all directions. Dickens is too decent for that; he sees the
stupidity of violence, and he also belongs to a cautious urban
class which does not deal in socks on the jaw, even in theory. And
his attitude towards sport is mixed up with social feelings. In
England, for mainly geographical reasons, sport, especially
field-sports, and snobbery are inextricably mingled. English
Socialists are often flatly incredulous when told that Lenin, for
instance, was devoted to shooting. In their eyes, shooting,
hunting, etc., are simply snobbish observances of the landed
gentry; they forget that these things might appear differently in a
huge virgin country like Russia. From Dickens's point of view
almost any kind of sport is at best a subject for satire.
Consequently one side of nineteenth-century life&mdash;the boxing,
racing, cock-fighting, badger-digging, poaching, rat-catching side
of life, so wonderfully embalmed in Leech's illustrations to
Surtees&mdash;is outside his scope.</p>

<p>What is more striking, in a seemingly 'progressive' radical, is
that he is not mechanically minded. He shows no interest either in
the details of machinery or in the things machinery can do. As
Gissing remarks, Dickens nowhere describes a railway journey with
anything like the enthusiasm he shows in describing journeys by
stage-coach. In nearly all of his books one has a curious feeling
that one is living in the first quarter of the nineteenth century,
and in fact, he does tend to return to this period. <i>Little
Dorrit</i>, written in the middle fifties, deals with the late
twenties; <i>Great Expectations</i> (1861) is not dated, but
evidently deals with the twenties and thirties. Several of the
inventions and discoveries which have made the modern world
possible (the electric telegraph, the breech-loading gun,
India-rubber, coal gas, wood-pulp paper) first appeared in
Dickens's lifetime, but he scarcely notes them in his books.
Nothing is queerer than the vagueness with which he speaks of
Doyce's 'invention' in <i>Little Dorrit</i>. It is represented as
something extremely ingenious and revolutionary, 'of great
importance to his country and his fellow-creatures', and it is also
an important minor link in the book; yet we are never told what the
'invention' is! On the other hand, Doyce's physical appearance is
hit off with the typical Dickens touch; he has a peculiar way of
moving his thumb, a way characteristic of engineers. After that,
Doyce is firmly anchored in one's memory; but, as usual, Dickens
has done it by fastening on something external.</p>

<p>There are people (Tennyson is an example) who lack the
mechanical faculty but can see the social possibilities of
machinery. Dickens has not this stamp of mind. He shows very little
consciousness of the future. When he speaks of human progress it is
usually in terms of <i>moral</i> progress&mdash;men growing better;
probably he would never admit that men are only as good as their
technical development allows them to be. At this point the gap
between Dickens and his modern analogue, H.G. Wells, is at its
widest. Wells wears the future round his neck like a mill-stone,
but Dickens's unscientific cast of mind is just as damaging in a
different way. What it does is to make any <i>positive</i> attitude
more difficult for him. He is hostile to the feudal, agricultural
past and not in real touch with the industrial present. Well, then,
all that remains is the future (meaning Science, 'progress', and so
forth), which hardly enters into his thoughts. Therefore, while
attacking everything in sight, he has no definable standard of
comparison. As I have pointed out already, he attacks the current
educational system with perfect justice, and yet, after all, he has
no remedy to offer except kindlier schoolmasters. Why did he not
indicate what a school <i>might</i> have been? Why did he not have
his own sons educated according to some plan of his own, instead of
sending them to public schools to be stuffed with Greek? Because he
lacked that kind of imagination. He has an infallible moral sense,
but very little intellectual curiosity. And here one comes upon
something which really is an enormous deficiency in Dickens,
something, that really does make the nineteenth century seem remote
from us&mdash;that he has no idea of work.</p>

<p>With the doubtful exception of David Copperfield (merely Dickens
himself), one cannot point to a single one of his central
characters who is primarily interested in his job. His heroes work
in order to make a living and to marry the heroine, not because
they feel a passionate interest in one particular subject. Martin
Chuzzlewit, for instance, is not burning with zeal to be an
architect; he might just as well be a doctor or a barrister. In any
case, in the typical Dickens novel, the <i>deus ex machina</i>
enters with a bag of gold in the last chapter and the hero is
absolved from further struggle. The feeling 'This is what I came
into the world to do. Everything else is uninteresting. I will do
this even if it means starvation', which turns men of differing
temperaments into scientists, inventors, artists, priests,
explorers and revolutionaries&mdash;this motif is almost entirely
absent from Dickens's books. He himself, as is well known, worked
like a slave and believed in his work as few novelists have ever
done. But there seems to be no calling except novel-writing (and
perhaps acting) towards which he can imagine this kind of devotion.
And, after all, it is natural enough, considering his rather
negative attitude towards society. In the last resort there is
nothing he admires except common decency. Science is uninteresting
and machinery is cruel and ugly (the heads of the elephants).
Business is only for ruffians like Bounderby. As for
politics&mdash;leave that to the Tite Barnacles. Really there is no
objective except to marry the heroine, settle down, live solvently
and be kind. And you can do that much better in private life.</p>

<p>Here, perhaps, one gets a glimpse of Dickens's secret
imaginative background. What did he think of as the most desirable
way to live? When Martin Chuzzlewit had made it up with his uncle,
when Nicholas Nickleby had married money, when John Harman had been
enriched by Boffin what did they <i>do</i>?</p>

<p>The answer evidently is that they did nothing. Nicholas Nickleby
invested his wife's money with the Cheerybles and 'became a rich
and prosperous merchant', but as he immediately retired into
Devonshire, we can assume that he did not work very hard. Mr. and
Mrs. Snodgrass 'purchased and cultivated a small farm, more for
occupation than profit.' That is the spirit in which most of
Dickens's books end&mdash;a sort of radiant idleness. Where he
appears to disapprove of young men who do not work (Harthouse,
Harry Gowan, Richard Carstone, Wrayburn before his reformation) it
is because they are cynical and immoral or because they are a
burden on somebody else; if you are 'good', and also
self-supporting, there is no reason why you should not spend fifty
years in simply drawing your dividends. Home life is always enough.
And, after all, it was the general assumption of his age. The
'genteel sufficiency', the 'competence', the 'gentleman of
independent means' (or 'in easy circumstances')&mdash;the very
phrases tell one all about the strange, empty dream of the
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century middle bourgeoisie. It was a
dream of <i>complete idleness</i>. Charles Reade conveys its spirit
perfectly in the ending of <i>Hard Cash</i>. Alfred Hardie, hero of
<i>Hard Cash</i>, is the typical nineteenth-century novel-hero
(public-school style), with gifts which Reade describes as
amounting to 'genius'. He is an old Etonian and a scholar of
Oxford, he knows most of the Greek and Latin classics by heart, he
can box with prizefighters and win the Diamond Sculls at Henley. He
goes through incredible adventures in which, of course, he behaves
with faultless heroism, and then, at the age of twenty-five, he
inherits a fortune, marries his Julia Dodd and settles down in the
suburbs of Liverpool, in the same house as his parents-in-law:</p>

<p>They all lived together at Albion Villa, thanks to Alfred...Oh,
you happy little villa! You were as like Paradise as any mortal
dwelling can be. A day came, however, when your walls could no
longer hold all the happy inmates. Julia presented Alfred with a
lovely boy; enter two nurses and the villa showed symptoms of
bursting. Two months more, and Alfred and his wife overflowed into
the next villa. It was but twenty yards off; and there was a double
reason for the migration. As often happens after a long separation,
Heaven bestowed on Captain and Mrs. Dodd another infant to play
about their knees, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>This is the type of the Victorian happy ending&mdash;a vision of
a huge, loving family of three or four generations, all crammed
together in the same house and constantly multiplying, like a bed
of oysters. What is striking about it is the utterly soft,
sheltered, effortless life that it implies. It is not even a
violent idleness, like Squire Western's.</p>

<p>That is the significance of Dickens's urban background and his
non interest in the blackguardly-sporting military side of life.
His heroes, once they had come into money and 'settled down', would
not only do no work; they would not even ride, hunt, shoot, fight
duels, elope with actresses or lose money at the races. They would
simply live at home in feather-bed respectability, and preferably
next door to a blood-relation living exactly the same life:</p>

<p>The first act of Nicholas, when he became a rich and prosperous
merchant, was to buy his father's old house. As time crept on, and
there came gradually about him a group of lovely children, it was
altered and enlarged; but none of the old rooms were ever pulled
down, no old tree was ever rooted up, nothing with which there was
any association of bygone times was ever removed or changed.</p>

<p>Within a stone's-throw was another retreat enlivened by
children's pleasant voices too; and here was Kate...the same true,
gentle creature, the same fond sister, the same in the love of all
about her, as in her girlish days.</p>

<p>It is the same incestuous atmosphere as in the passage quoted
from Reade. And evidently this is Dickens's ideal ending. It is
perfectly attained in <i>Nicholas Nickleby, Martin Chuzzlewit</i>
and <i>Pickwick</i>, and it is approximated to in varying degrees
in almost all the others. The exceptions are <i>Hard Times</i> and
<i>Great Expectations</i>&mdash;the latter actually has a 'happy
ending', but it contradicts the general tendency of the book, and
it was put in at the request of Bulwer Lytton.</p>

<p>The ideal to be striven after, then, appears to be something
like this: a hundred thousand pounds, a quaint old house with
plenty of ivy on it, a sweetly womanly wife, a horde of children,
and no work. Everything is safe, soft, peaceful and, above all,
domestic. In the moss-grown churchyard down the road are the graves
of the loved ones who passed away before the happy ending happened.
The servants are comic and feudal, the children prattle round your
feet, the old friends sit at your fireside, talking of past days,
there is the endless succession of enormous meals, the cold punch
and sherry negus, the feather beds and warming-pans, the Christmas
parties with charades and blind man's buff; but nothing ever
happens, except the yearly childbirth. The curious thing is that it
is a genuinely happy picture, or so Dickens is able to make it
appear. The thought of that kind of existence is satisfying to him.
This alone would be enough to tell one that more than a hundred
years have passed since Dickens's first book was written. No modern
man could combine such purposelessness with so much vitality.</p>

<p><b>V</b>
</p>

<p>By this time anyone who is a lover of Dickens, and who has read
as far as this, will probably be angry with me.</p>

<p>I have been discussing Dickens simply in terms of his 'message',
and almost ignoring his literary qualities. But every writer,
especially every novelist, <i>has</i> a 'message', whether he
admits it or not, and the minutest details of his work are
influenced by it. All art is propaganda. Neither Dickens himself
nor the majority of Victorian novelists would have thought of
denying this. On the other hand, not all propaganda is art. As I
said earlier, Dickens is one of those writers who are felt to be
worth stealing. He has been stolen by Marxists, by Catholics and,
above all, by Conservatives. The question is, What is there to
steal? Why does anyone care about Dickens? Why do I care about
Dickens?</p>

<p>That kind of question is never easy to answer. As a rule, an
aesthetic preference is either something inexplicable or it is so
corrupted by non-aesthetic motives as to make one wonder whether
the whole of literary criticism is not a huge network of humbug. In
Dickens's case the complicating factor is his familiarity. He
happens to be one of those 'great authors' who are ladled down
everyone's throat in childhood. At the time this causes rebellion
and vomiting, but it may have different after-effects in later
life. For instance, nearly everyone feels a sneaking affection for
the patriotic poems that he learned by heart as a child, 'Ye
Mariners of England', the 'Charge of the Light Brigade' and so
forth. What one enjoys is not so much the poems themselves as the
memories they call up. And with Dickens the same forces of
association are at work. Probably there are copies of one or two of
his books lying about in an actual majority of English homes. Many
children begin to know his characters by sight before they can even
read, for on the whole Dickens was lucky in his illustrators. A
thing that is absorbed as early as that does not come up against
any critical judgement. And when one thinks of this, one thinks of
all that is bad and silly in Dickens&mdash;the cast-iron 'plots',
the characters who don't come off, the longueurs, the paragraphs in
blank verse, the awful pages of 'pathos'. And then the thought
arises, when I say I like Dickens, do I simply mean that I like
thinking about my childhood? Is Dickens merely an institution?</p>

<p>If so, he is an institution that there is no getting away from.
How often one really thinks about any writer, even a writer one
cares for, is a difficult thing to decide; but I should doubt
whether anyone who has actually read Dickens can go a week without
remembering him in one context or another. Whether you approve of
him or not, he is <i>there</i>, like the Nelson Column. At any
moment some scene or character, which may come from some book you
cannot even remember the name of, is liable to drop into your mind.
Micawber's letters! Winkle in the witness-box! Mrs. Gamp! Mrs.
Wititterly and Sir Tumley Snuffim! Todgers's! (George Gissing said
that when he passed the Monument it was never of the Fire of London
that he thought, always of Todgers's.) Mrs. Leo Hunter! Squeers!
Silas Wegg and the Decline and Fall-off of the Russian Empire! Miss
Mills and the Desert of Sahara! Wopsle acting Hamlet! Mrs. Jellyby!
Mantalini, Jerry Cruncher, Barkis, Pumblechook, Tracy Tupman,
Skimpole, Joe Gargery, Pecksniff&mdash;and so it goes on and on. It
is not so much a series of books, it is more like a world. And not
a purely comic world either, for part of what one remembers in
Dickens is his Victorian morbidness and necrophilia and the
blood-and-thunder scenes&mdash;the death of Sykes, Krook's
spontaneous combustion, Fagin in the condemned cell, the women
knitting round the guillotine. To a surprising extent all this has
entered even into the minds of people who do not care about it. A
music-hall comedian can (or at any rate could quite recently) go on
the stage and impersonate Micawber or Mrs. Gamp with a fair
certainty of being understood, although not one in twenty of the
audience had ever read a book of Dickens's right through. Even
people who affect to despise him quote him unconsciously.</p>

<p>Dickens is a writer who can be imitated, up to a certain point.
In genuinely popular literature&mdash;for instance, the Elephant
and Castle version of <i>Sweeny Todd</i>&mdash;he has been
plagiarized quite shamelessly. What has been imitated, however, is
simply a tradition that Dickens himself took from earlier novelists
and developed, the cult of 'character', i.e. eccentricity. The
thing that cannot be imitated is his fertility of invention, which
is invention not so much of characters, still less of 'situations',
as of turns of phrase and concrete details. The outstanding,
unmistakable mark of Dickens's writing is the <i>unnecessary
detail</i>. Here is an example of what I mean. The story given
below is not particularly funny, but there is one phrase in it that
is as individual as a fingerprint. Mr. Jack Hopkins, at Bob
Sawyer's party, is telling the story of the child who swallowed its
sister's necklace:</p>

<p>Next day, child swallowed two beads; the day after that, he
treated himself to three, and so on, till in a week's time he had
got through the necklace&mdash;five-and-twenty beads in all. The
sister, who was an industrious girl and seldom treated herself to a
bit of finery, cried her eyes out at the loss of the necklace;
looked high and low for it; but I needn't say, didn't find it. A
few days afterwards, the family were at dinner&mdash;baked shoulder
of mutton and potatoes under it&mdash;the child, who wasn't hungry,
was playing about the room, when suddenly there was the devil of a
noise, like a small hailstorm. 'Don't do that, my boy', says the
father. 'I ain't a-doin' nothing', said the child. 'Well, don't do
it again', said the father. There was a short silence, and then the
noise began again, worse than ever. 'If you don't mind what I say,
my boy', said the father, 'you'll find yourself in bed, in
something less than a pig's whisper.' He gave the child a shake to
make him obedient, and such a rattling ensued as nobody ever heard
before. 'Why dam' me, it's <i>in</i> the child', said the father;
'he's got the croup in the wrong place!' 'No, I haven't, father',
said the child, beginning to cry, 'it's the necklace; I swallowed
it, father.' The father caught the child up, and ran with him to
the hospital, the beads in the boy's stomach rattling all the way
with the jolting; and the people looking up in the air, and down in
the cellars, to see where the unusual sound came from. 'He's in the
hospital now', said Jack Hopkins, 'and he makes such a devil of a
noise when he walks about, that they're obliged to muffle him in a
watchman's coat, for fear he should wake the patients.'</p>

<p>As a whole, this story might come out of any nineteenth-century
comic paper. But the unmistakable Dickens touch, the thing that
nobody else would have thought of, is the baked shoulder of mutton
and potatoes under it. How does this advance the story? The answer
is that it doesn't. It is something totally unnecessary, a florid
little squiggle on the edge of the page; only, it is by just these
squiggles that the special Dickens atmosphere is created. The other
thing one would notice here is that Dickens's way of telling a
story takes a long time. An interesting example, too long to quote,
is Sam Weller's story of the obstinate patient in Chapter XLIV of
<i>The Pickwick Papers</i>. As it happens, we have a standard of
comparison here, because Dickens is plagiarizing, consciously or
unconsciously. The story is also told by some ancient Greek writer.
I cannot now find the passage, but I read it years ago as a boy at
school, and it runs more or less like this:</p>

<p>A certain Thracian, renowned for his obstinacy, was warned by
his physician that if he drank a flagon of wine it would kill him.
The Thracian thereupon drank the flagon of wine and immediately
jumped off the house-top and perished. 'For', said he, 'in this way
I shall prove that the wine did not kill me.'</p>

<p>As the Greek tells it, that is the whole story&mdash;about six
lines. As Sam Weller tells it, it takes round about a thousand
words. Long before getting to the point we have been told all about
the patient's clothes, his meals, his manners, even the newspapers
he reads, and about the peculiar construction of the doctor's
carriage, which conceals the fact that the coachman's trousers do
not match his coat. Then there is the dialogue between the doctor
and the patient. ''Crumpets is wholesome, sir,' said the patient.
'Crumpets is <i>not</i> wholesome, sir,' says the doctor, wery
fierce,' etc., etc. In the end the original story had been buried
under the details. And in all of Dickens's most characteristic
passages it is the same. His imagination overwhelms everything,
like a kind of weed. Squeers stands up to address his boys, and
immediately we are hearing about Bolder's father who was two pounds
ten short, and Mobbs's stepmother who took to her bed on hearing
that Mobbs wouldn't eat fat and hoped Mr. Squeers would flog him
into a happier state of mind. Mrs. Leo Hunter writes a poem,
'Expiring Frog'; two full stanzas are given. Boffin takes a fancy
to pose as a miser, and instantly we are down among the squalid
biographies of eighteenth-century misers, with names like Vulture
Hopkins and the Rev. Blewberry Jones, and chapter headings like
'The Story of the Mutton Pies' and 'The Treasures of a Dunghill'.
Mrs. Harris, who does not even exist, has more detail piled on to
her than any three characters in an ordinary novel. Merely in the
middle of a sentence we learn, for instance, that her infant nephew
has been seen in a bottle at Greenwich Fair, along with the
pink-eyed lady, the Prussian dwarf and the living skeleton. Joe
Gargery describes how the robbers broke into the house of
Pumblechook, the corn and seed merchant&mdash;'and they took his
till, and they took his cashbox, and they drinked his wine, and
they partook of his wittles, and they slapped his face, and they
pulled his nose, and they tied him up to his bedpost, and they give
him a dozen, and they stuffed his mouth full of flowering annuals
to prevent his crying out.' Once again the unmistakable Dickens
touch, the flowering annuals; but any other novelist would only
have mentioned about half of these outrages. Everything is piled up
and up, detail on detail, embroidery on embroidery. It is futile to
object that this kind of thing is rococo&mdash;one might as well
make the same objection to a wedding-cake. Either you like it or
you do not like it. Other nineteenth-century writers, Surtees,
Barham, Thackeray, even Marryat, have something of Dickens's
profuse, overflowing quality, but none of them on anything like the
same scale. The appeal of all these writers now depends partly on
period-flavour and though Marryat is still officially a 'boy's
writer' and Surtees has a sort of legendary fame among hunting men,
it is probable that they are read mostly by bookish people.</p>

<p>Significantly, Dickens's most successful books (not his
<i>best</i> books) are <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, which is not a
novel, and <i>Hard Times</i> and <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, which
are not funny. As a novelist his natural fertility greatly hampers
him, because the burlesque which he is never able to resist, is
constantly breaking into what ought to be serious situations. There
is a good example of this in the opening chapter of <i>Great
Expectations</i>. The escaped convict, Magwitch, has just captured
the six-year-old Pip in the churchyard. The scene starts
terrifyingly enough, from Pip's point of view. The convict,
smothered in mud and with his chain trailing from his leg, suddenly
starts up among the tombs, grabs the child, turns him upside down
and robs his pockets. Then he begins terrorizing him into bringing
foal and a file:</p>

<p>He held me by the arms in an upright position on the top of the
stone, and went on in these fearful terms:</p>

<p>'You bring me, tomorrow morning early, that file and them
wittles. You bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder.
You do it and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign
concerning your having seen such a person as me, or any person
sumever, and you shall be let to live. You fail, or you go from my
words in any partickler, no matter how small it is, and your heart
and liver shall be tore out, roasted and ate. Now, I ain't alone,
as you may think I am. There's a young man hid with me, in
comparison with which young man I am a Angel. That young man hears
the words I speak. That young man has a secret way pecooliar to
himself, of getting at a boy, and at his heart, and at his liver.
It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young
man. A boy may lock his doors, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself
up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think himself
comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep his way
to him and tear him open. I am keeping that young man from harming
you at the present moment, but with great difficulty. I find it
wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what do
you say?'</p>

<p>Here Dickens has simply yielded to temptation. To begin with, no
starving and hunted man would speak in the least like that.
Moreover, although the speech shows a remarkable knowledge of the
way in which a child's mind works, its actual words are quite out
of tune with what is to follow. It turns Magwitch into a sort of
pantomime wicked uncle, or, if one sees him through the child's
eyes, into an appalling monster. Later in the book he is to be
represented as neither, and his exaggerated gratitude, on which the
plot turns, is to be incredible because of just this speech. As
usual, Dickens's imagination has overwhelmed him. The picturesque
details were too good to be left out. Even with characters who are
more of a piece than Magwitch he is liable to be tripped up by some
seductive phrase. Mr. Murdstone, for instance, is in the habit of
ending David Copperfield's lessons every morning with a dreadful
sum in arithmetic. 'If I go into a cheesemonger's shop, and buy
four thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence halfpenny
each, present payment', it always begins. Once again the typical
Dickens detail, the double-Gloucester cheeses. But it is far too
human a touch for Murdstone; he would have made it five thousand
cashboxes. Every time this note is struck, the unity of the novel
suffers. Not that it matters very much, because Dickens is
obviously a writer whose parts are greater than his wholes. He is
all fragments, all details&mdash;rotten architecture, but wonderful
gargoyles&mdash;and never better than when he is building up some
character who will later on be forced to act inconsistently.</p>

<p>Of course it is not usual to urge against Dickens that he makes
his characters behave inconsistently. Generally he is accused of
doing just the opposite. His characters are supposed to be mere
'types', each crudely representing some single trait and fitted
with a kind of label by which you recognize him. Dickens is 'only a
caricaturist'&mdash;that is the usual accusation, and it does him
both more and less than justice. To begin with, he did not think of
himself as a caricaturist, and was constantly setting into action
characters who ought to have been purely static. Squeers, Micawber,
Miss Mowcher,[Note, below] Wegg, Skimpole, Pecksniff and many
others are finally involved in 'plots' where they are out of place
and where they behave quite incredibly. They start off as
magic-lantern slides and they end by getting mixed up in a
third-rate movie. Sometimes one can put one's finger on a single
sentence in which the original illusion is destroyed. There is such
a sentence in <i>David Copperfield</i>. After the famous
dinner-party (the one where the leg of mutton was underdone), David
is showing his guests out. He stops Traddles at the top of the
stairs:</p>

<p>[Note: Dickens turned Miss Mowcher into a sort of heroine
because the real woman whom he had caricatured had read the earlier
chapters and was bitterly hurt. He had previously meant her to play
a villainous part. But <i>any</i> action by such a character would
seem incongruous. (Author's footnote)]</p>

<p>'Traddles', said I, 'Mr. Micawber don't mean any harm, poor
fellow: but if I were you I wouldn't lend him anything.'</p>

<p>'My dear Copperfield', returned Traddles, smiling, 'I haven't
got anything to lend.'</p>

<p>'You have got a name, you know,' I said.</p>

<p>At the place where one reads it this remark jars a little though
something of the kind was inevitable sooner or later. The story is
a fairly realistic one, and David is growing up; ultimately he is
bound to see Mr. Micawber for what he is, a cadging scoundrel.
Afterwards, of course, Dickens's sentimentality overcomes him and
Micawber is made to turn over a new leaf. But from then on, the
original Micawber is never quite recaptured, in spite of desperate
efforts. As a rule, the 'plot' in which Dickens's characters get
entangled is not particularly credible, but at least it makes some
pretence at reality, whereas the world to which they belong is a
never-never land, a kind of eternity. But just here one sees that
'only a caricaturist' is not really a condemnation. The fact that
Dickens is always thought of as a caricaturist, although he was
constantly trying to be something else, is perhaps the surest mark
of his genius. The monstrosities that he created are still
remembered as monstrosities, in spite of getting mixed up in
would-be probable melodramas. Their first impact is so vivid that
nothing that comes afterwards effaces it. As with the people one
knew in childhood, one seems always to remember them in one
particular attitude, doing one particular thing. Mrs. Squeers is
always ladling out brimstone and treacle, Mrs. Gummidge is always
weeping, Mrs. Gargery is always banging her husband's head against
the wall, Mrs. Jellyby is always scribbling tracts while her
children fall into the area&mdash;and there they all are, fixed up
for ever like little twinkling miniatures painted on snuffbox lids,
completely fantastic and incredible, and yet somehow more solid and
infinitely more memorable than the efforts of serious novelists.
Even by the standards of his time Dickens was an exceptionally
artificial writer. As Ruskin said, he 'chose to work in a circle of
stage fire.' His characters are even more distorted and simplified
than Smollett's. But there are no rules in novel-writing, and for
any work of art there is only one test worth bothering
about&mdash;survival. By this test Dickens's characters have
succeeded, even if the people who remember them hardly think of
them as human beings. They are monsters, but at any rate they
exist.</p>

<p>But all the same there is a disadvantage in writing about
monsters. It amounts to this, that it is only certain moods that
Dickens can speak to. There are large areas of the human mind that
he never touches. There is no poetic feeling anywhere in his books,
and no genuine tragedy, and even sexual love is almost outside his
scope. Actually his books are not so sexless as they are sometimes
declared to be, and considering the time in which he was writing,
he is reasonably frank. But there is not a trace in him of the
feeling that one finds in <i>Manon Lescaut, Salammb&ocirc;, Carmen,
Wuthering Heights</i>. According to Aldous Huxley, D.H. Lawrence
once said that Balzac was 'a gigantic dwarf', and in a sense the
same is true of Dickens. There are whole worlds which he either
knows nothing about or does not wish to mention. Except in a rather
roundabout way, one cannot learn very much from Dickens. And to say
this is to think almost immediately of the great Russian novelists
of the nineteenth century. Why is it that Tolstoy's grasp seems to
be so much larger than Dickens's&mdash;why is it that he seems able
to tell you so much more <i>about yourself</i>? It is not that he
is more gifted, or even, in the last analysis, more intelligent. It
is because he is writing about people who are growing. His
characters are struggling to make their souls, whereas Dickens's
are already finished and perfect. In my own mind Dickens's people
are present far more often and far more vividly than Tolstoy's, but
always in a single unchangeable attitude, like pictures or pieces
of furniture. You cannot hold an imaginary conversation with a
Dickens character as you can with, say, Peter Bezoukhov. And this
is not merely because of Tolstoy's greater seriousness, for there
are also comic characters that you can imagine yourself talking
to&mdash;Bloom, for instance, or Pecuchet, or even Wells's Mr.
Polly. It is because Dickens's characters have no mental life. They
say perfectly the thing that they have to say, but they cannot be
conceived as talking about anything else. They never learn, never
speculate. Perhaps the most meditative of his characters is Paul
Dombey, and his thoughts are mush. Does this mean that Tolstoy's
novels are 'better' than Dickens's? The truth is that it is absurd
to make such comparisons in terms of 'better' and 'worse'. If I
were forced to compare Tolstoy with Dickens, I should say that
Tolstoy's appeal will probably be wider in the long run, because
Dickens is scarcely intelligible outside the English-speaking
culture; on the other hand, Dickens is able to reach simple people,
which Tolstoy is not. Tolstoy's characters can cross a frontier,
Dickens can be portrayed on a cigarette-card. But one is no more
obliged to choose between them than between a sausage and a rose.
Their purposes barely intersect.</p>

<p><b>VI</b>
</p>

<p>If Dickens had been merely a comic writer, the chances are that
no one would now remember his name. Or at best a few of his books
would survive in rather the same way as books like <i>Frank
Fairleigh, Mr. Verdant Green</i> and <i>Mrs. Caudle's Curtain
Lectures</i>, as a sort of hangover of the Victorian atmosphere, a
pleasant little whiff of oysters and brown stout. Who has not felt
sometimes that it was 'a pity' that Dickens ever deserted the vein
of <i>Pickwick</i> for things like <i>Little Dorrit</i> and <i>Hard
Times</i>? What people always demand of a popular novelist is that
he shall write the same book over and over again, forgetting that a
man who would write the same book twice could not even write it
once. Any writer who is not utterly lifeless moves upon a kind of
parabola, and the downward curve is implied in the upper one. Joyce
has to start with the frigid competence of <i>Dubliners</i> and end
with the dream-language of <i>Finnegan's Wake</i>, but
<i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Portrait of the Artist</i> are part of the
trajectory. The thing that drove Dickens forward into a form of art
for which he was not really suited, and at the same time caused us
to remember him, was simply the fact that he was a moralist, the
consciousness of 'having something to say'. He is always preaching
a sermon, and that is the final secret of his inventiveness. For
you can only create if you can <i>care</i>. Types like Squeers and
Micawber could not have been produced by a hack writer looking for
something to be funny about. A joke worth laughing at always has an
idea behind it, and usually a subversive idea. Dickens is able to
go on being funny because he is in revolt against authority, and
authority is always there to be laughed at. There is always room
for one more custard pie.</p>

<p>His radicalism is of the vaguest kind, and yet one always knows
that it is there. That is the difference between being a moralist
and a politician. He has no constructive suggestions, not even a
clear grasp of the nature of the society he is attacking, only an
emotional perception that something is wrong, all he can finally
say is, 'Behave decently', which, as I suggested earlier, is not
necessarily so shallow as it sounds. Most revolutionaries are
potential Tories, because they imagine that everything can be put
right by altering the <i>shape</i> of society; once that change is
effected, as it sometimes is, they see no need for any other.
Dickens has not this kind of mental coarseness. The vagueness of
his discontent is the mark of its permanence. What he is out
against is not this or that institution, but, as Chesterton put it,
'an expression on the human face.' Roughly speaking, his morality
is the Christian morality, but in spite of his Anglican upbringing
he was essentially a Bible-Christian, as he took care to make plain
when writing his will. In any case he cannot properly be described
as a religious man. He 'believed', undoubtedly, but religion in the
devotional sense does not seem to have entered much into his
thoughts [Note, below]. Where he is Christian is in his
quasi-instinctive siding with the oppressed against the oppressors.
As a matter of course he is on the side of the underdog, always and
everywhere. To carry this to its logical conclusion one has got to
change sides when the underdog becomes an upper-dog, and in fact
Dickens does tend to do so. He loathes the Catholic Church, for
instance, but as soon as the Catholics are persecuted (<i>Barnaby
Rudge</i>) he is on their side. He loathes the aristocratic class
even more, but as soon as they are really overthrown (the
revolutionary chapters in <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>) his
sympathies swing round. Whenever he departs from this emotional
attitude he goes astray. A well-known example is at the ending of
<i>David Copperfield</i>, in which everyone who reads it feels that
something has gone wrong. What is wrong is that the closing
chapters are pervaded, faintly but not noticeably, by the cult of
success. It is the gospel according to Smiles, instead of the
gospel according to Dickens. The attractive, out-at-elbow
characters are got rid of, Micawber makes a fortune, Heep gets into
prison&mdash;both of these events are flagrantly
impossible&mdash;and even Dora is killed off to make way for Agnes.
If you like, you can read Dora as Dickens's wife and Agnes as his
sister-in-law, but the essential point is that Dickens has 'turned
respectable' and done violence to his own nature. Perhaps that is
why Agnes is the most disagreeable of his heroines, the real
legless angel of Victorian romance, almost as bad as Thackeray's
Laura.</p>

<p>[Note: From a letter to his youngest son (in 1868): 'You will
remember that you have never at home been harassed about religious
observances, or mere formalities. I have always been anxious not to
weary my children with such things, before they are old enough to
form opinions respecting them. You will therefore understand the
better that I now most solemnly impress upon you the truth and
beauty of the Christian Religion, as it came from Christ Himself,
and the impossibility of your going far wrong if you humbly but
heartily respect it...Never abandon the wholesome practice of
saying your own private prayers, night and morning. I have never
abandoned it myself, and I know the comfort of it.' (Author's
footnote)]</p>

<p>No grown-up person can read Dickens without feeling his
limitations, and yet there does remain his native generosity of
mind, which acts as a kind of anchor and nearly always keeps him
where he belongs. It is probably the central secret of his
popularity. A good-tempered antinomianism rather of Dickens's type
is one of the marks of Western popular culture. One sees it in
folk-stories and comic songs, in dream-figures like Mickey Mouse
and Pop-eye the Sailor (both of them variants of Jack the
Giant-killer), in the history of working-class Socialism, in the
popular protests (always ineffective but not always a sham) against
imperialism, in the impulse that makes a jury award excessive
damages when a rich man's car runs over a poor man; it is the
feeling that one is always on the wrong side of the underdog, on
the side of the weak against the strong. In one sense it is a
feeling that is fifty years out of date. The common man is still
living in the mental world of Dickens, but nearly every modern
intellectual has gone over to some or other form of
totalitarianism. From the Marxist or Fascist point of view, nearly
all that Dickens stands for can be written off as 'bourgeois
morality'. But in moral outlook no one could be more 'bourgeois'
than the English working classes. The ordinary people in the
Western countries have never entered, mentally, into the world of
'realism' and power-politics. They may do so before long, in which
case Dickens will be as out of date as the cab-horse. But in his
own age and ours he has been popular chiefly because he was able to
express in a comic, simplified and therefore memorable form the
native decency of the common man. And it is important that from
this point of view people of very different types can be described
as 'common'. In a country like England, in spite of its
class-structure, there does exist a certain cultural unity. All
through the Christian ages, and especially since the French
Revolution, the Western world has been haunted by the idea of
freedom and equality; it is only an <i>idea</i>, but it has
penetrated to all ranks of society. The most atrocious injustices,
cruelties, lies, snobberies exist everywhere, but there are not
many people who can regard these things with the same indifference
as, say, a Roman slave-owner. Even the millionaire suffers from a
vague sense of guilt, like a dog eating a stolen leg of mutton.
Nearly everyone, whatever his actual conduct may be, responds
emotionally to the idea of human brotherhood. Dickens voiced a code
which was and on the whole still is believed in, even by people who
violate it. It is difficult otherwise to explain why he could be
both read by working people (a thing that has happened to no other
novelist of his stature) and buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>When one reads any strongly individual piece of writing, one has
the impression of seeing a face somewhere behind the page. It is
not necessarily the actual face of the writer. I feel this very
strongly with Swift, with Defoe, with Fielding, Stendhal,
Thackeray, Flaubert, though in several cases I do not know what
these people looked like and do not want to know. What one sees is
the face that the writer <i>ought</i> to have. Well, in the case of
Dickens I see a face that is not quite the face of Dickens's
photographs, though it resembles it. It is the face of a man of
about forty, with a small beard and a high colour. He is laughing,
with a touch of anger in his laughter, but no triumph, no
malignity. It is the face of a man who is always fighting against
something, but who fights in the open and is not frightened, the
face of a man who is <i>generously angry</i>&mdash;in other words,
of a nineteenth-century liberal, a free intelligence, a type hated
with equal hatred by all the smelly little orthodoxies which are
now contending for our souls.</p>

<h2>CHARLES READE (1940)</h2>

<p>Since Charles Reade's books are published in cheap editions one
can assume that he still has his following, but it is unusual to
meet anyone who has voluntarily read him. In most people his name
seems to evoke, at most, a vague memory of 'doing' <i>The Cloister
and the Hearth</i> as a school holiday task. It is his bad luck to
be remembered by this particular book, rather as Mark Twain, thanks
to the films, is chiefly remembered by <i>A Connecticut Yankee in
King Arthur's Court</i>. Reade wrote several dull books, and <i>The
Cloister and The Hearth</i> is one of them. But he also wrote three
novels which I personally would back to outlive the entire works of
Meredith and George Eliot, besides some brilliant long-short
stories such as <i>A Jack of all Trades</i> and <i>The
Autobiography of a Thief</i>.</p>

<p>What is the attraction of Reade? At bottom it is the same charm
as one finds in R. Austin Freeman's detective stories or
Lieutenant-Commander Gould's collections of curiosities&mdash;the
charm of useless knowledge. Reade was a man of what one might call
penny-encyclopaedic learning. He possessed vast stocks of
disconnected information which a lively narrative gift allowed him
to cram into books which would at any rate pass as novels. If you
have the sort of mind that takes a pleasure in dates, lists,
catalogues, concrete details, descriptions of processes, junk-shop
windows and back numbers of the <i>Exchange and Mart</i>, the sort
of mind that likes knowing exactly how a medieval catapult worked
or just what objects a prison cell of the eighteen-forties
contained, then you can hardly help enjoying Reade. He himself, of
course, did not see his work in quite this light. He prided himself
on his accuracy and compiled his books largely from newspaper
cuttings, but the strange facts which he collected were subsidiary
to what he would have regarded as his 'purpose'. For he was a
social reformer in a fragmentary way, and made vigorous attacks on
such diverse evils as blood-letting, the treadmill, private
asylums, clerical celibacy and tight-lacing.</p>

<p>My own favourite has always been <i>Foul Play</i>, which as it
happens is not an attack on anything in particular. Like most
nineteenth-century novels <i>Foul Play</i> is too complicated to be
summarized, but its central story is that of a young clergyman,
Robert Penfold, who is unjustly convicted of forgery, is
transported to Australia, absconds in disguise, and is wrecked on a
desert island together with the heroine. Here, of course, Reade is
in his element. Of all men who ever lived, he was the best fitted
to write a desert-island story. Some desert-island stories, of
course, are worse than others, but none is altogether bad when it
sticks to the actual concrete details of the struggle to keep
alive. A list of the objects in a shipwrecked man's possession is
probably the surest winner in fiction, surer even than a trial
scene. Nearly thirty years after reading the book I can still
remember more or less exactly what things the three heroes of
Ballantyne's <i>Coral Island</i> possessed between them. (A
telescope, six yards of whipcord, a penknife, a brass ring and a
piece of hoop iron.) Even a dismal book like <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>, so unreadable as a whole that few people even know that
the second part exists, becomes interesting when it describes
Crusoe's efforts to make a table, glaze earthenware and grow a
patch of wheat. Reade, however, was an expert on desert islands, or
at any rate he was very well up in the geography textbooks of the
time. Moreover he was the kind of man who would have been at home
on a desert island himself. He would never, like Crusoe, have been
stumped by such an easy problem as that of leavening bread and,
unlike Ballantyne, he knew that civilized men cannot make fire by
rubbing sticks together.</p>

<p>The hero of <i>Foul Play</i>, like most of Reade's heroes, is a
kind of superman. He is hero, saint, scholar, gentleman, athlete,
pugilist, navigator, physiologist, botanist, blacksmith and
carpenter all rolled into one, the sort of compendium of all the
talents that Reade honestly imagined to be the normal product of an
English university. Needless to say, it is only a month or two
before this wonderful clergyman has got the desert island running
like a West End hotel. Even before reaching the island, when the
last survivors of the wrecked ship are dying of thirst in an open
boat, he has shown his ingenuity by constructing a distilling
apparatus with a jar, a hot-water bottle and a piece of tubing. But
his best stroke of all is the way in which he contrives to leave
the island. He himself, with a price on his head, would be glad
enough to remain, but the heroine, Helen Rollestone, who has no
idea that he is a convict, is naturally anxious to escape. She asks
Robert to turn his 'great mind' to this problem. The first
difficulty, of course, is to discover exactly where the island is.
Luckily, however, Helen is still wearing her watch, which is still
keeping Sydney time. By fixing a stick in the ground and watching
its shadow Robert notes the exact moment of noon, after which it is
a simple matter to work out the longitude&mdash;for naturally a man
of his calibre would know the longitude of Sydney. It is equally
natural that he can determine the latitude within a degree or two
by the nature of the vegetation. But the next difficulty is to send
a message to the outside world. After some thought Robert writes a
series of messages on pieces of parchment made from seals'
bladders, with ink obtained from cochineal insects. He has noticed
that migrant birds often use the island as a stopping-place, and he
fixes on ducks as the likeliest messengers, because every duck is
liable to be shot sooner or later. By a stratagem often used in
India he captures a number of ducks, ties a message to each of
their legs and lets them go. Finally, of course, one of the ducks
takes refuge on a ship, and the couple are rescued, but even then
the story is barely half finished. There follow enormous
ramifications, plots and counterplots, intrigues, triumphs and
disasters, ending with the vindication of Robert, and wedding
bells.</p>

<p>In any of Reade's three best books, <i>Foul Play, Hard Cash</i>
and <i>It is Never too Late to Mend</i>, it is not fair to say that
the sole interest is in the technical detail. His power of
descriptive writing, especially of describing violent action, is
also very striking, and on a serial-story level he is a wonderful
contriver of plots. Simply as a novelist it is impossible to take
him seriously, because he has no sense whatever of character or of
probability, but he himself had the advantage of believing in even
the absurdest details of his own stories. He wrote of life as he
saw it, and many Victorians saw it in the same way: that is, as a
series of tremendous melodramas, with virtue triumphant every time.
Of all the nineteenth-century novelists who have remained readable,
he is perhaps the only one who is completely in tune with his own
age. For all his unconventionality, his 'purpose', his eagerness to
expose abuses, he never makes a fundamental criticism. Save for a
few surface evils he sees nothing wrong in an acquisitive society,
with its equation of money and virtue, its pious millionaires and
erastian clergymen. Perhaps nothing gives one his measure better
than the fact that in introducing Robert Penfold, at the beginning
of <i>Foul Play</i>, he mentions that he is a scholar and a
cricketer and only thirdly and almost casually adds that he is a
priest.</p>

<p>That is not to say that Reade's social conscience was not sound
so far as it went, and in several minor ways he probably helped to
educate public opinion. His attack on the prison system in <i>It is
Never too Late to Mend</i> is relevant to this day, or was so till
very recently, and in his medical theories he is said to have been
a long way ahead of his time. What he lacked was any notion that
the early railway age, with the special scheme of values
appropriate to it, was not going to last for ever. This is a little
surprising when one remembers that he was the brother of Winwood
Reade. However hastily and unbalanced Winwood Reade's <i>Martyrdom
of Man</i> may seem now, it is a book that shows an astonishing
width of vision, and it is probably the unacknowledged grandparent
of the 'outlines' so popular today. Charles Reade might have
written an 'outline' of phrenology, cabinet-making or the habits of
whales, but not of human history. He was simply a middle-class
gentleman with a little more conscience than most, a scholar who
happened to prefer popular science to the classics. Just for that
reason he is one of the best 'escape' novelists we have. <i>Foul
Play</i> and <i>Hard Cash</i> would be good books to send to a
soldier enduring the miseries of trench warfare, for instance.
There are no problems in them, no genuine 'messages', merely the
fascination of a gifted mind functioning within very narrow limits,
and offering as complete a detachment from real life as a game of
chess or a jigsaw puzzle.</p>

<h2>INSIDE THE WHALE (1940)</h2>

<p><b>I</b>
</p>

<p>When Henry Miller's novel, <i>Tropic of Cancer</i>, appeared in
1935, it was greeted with rather cautious praise, obviously
conditioned in some cases by a fear of seeming to enjoy
pornography. Among the people who praised it were T. S. Eliot,
Herbert Read, Aldous Huxley, John dos Passes, Ezra Pound&mdash;on
the whole, not the writers who are in fashion at this moment. And
in fact the subject matter of the book, and to a certain extent its
mental atmosphere, belong to the twenties rather than to the
thirties.</p>

<p><i>Tropic of Cancer</i> is a novel in the first person, or
autobiography in the form of a novel, whichever way you like to
look at it. Miller himself insists that it is straight
autobiography, but the tempo and method of telling the story are
those of a novel. It is a story of the American Paris, but not
along quite the usual lines, because the Americans who figure in it
happen to be people without money. During the boom years, when
dollars were plentiful and the exchange-value of the franc was low,
Paris was invaded by such a swarm of artists, writers, students,
dilettanti, sight-seers, debauchees, and plain idlers as the world
has probably never seen. In some quarters of the town the so-called
artists must actually have outnumbered the working
population&mdash;indeed, it has been reckoned that in the late
twenties there were as many as 30,000 painters in Paris, most of
them impostors. The populace had grown so hardened to artists that
gruff-voiced lesbians in corduroy breeches and young men in Grecian
or medieval costume could walk the streets without attracting a
glance, and along the Seine banks at Notre Dame it was almost
impossible to pick one's way between the sketching-stools. It was
the age of dark horses and neglected genii; the phrase on
everybody's lips was 'quand je serai lancé'. As it turned out,
nobody was 'lancé', the slump descended like another Ice Age, the
cosmopolitan mob of artists vanished, and the huge Montparnasse
cafés which only ten years ago were filled till the small hours by
hordes of shrieking poseurs have turned into darkened tombs in
which there are not even any ghosts. It is this
world&mdash;described in, among other novels, Wyndham Lewis's
<i>Tarr</i>&mdash;that Miller is writing about, but he is dealing
only with the under side of it, the lumpen-proletarian fringe which
has been able to survive the slump because it is composed partly of
genuine artists and partly of genuine scoundrels. The neglected
genii, the paranoiacs who are always 'going to' write the novel
that will knock Proust into a cocked hat, are there, but they are
only genii in the rather rare moments when they are not scouting
about for the next meal. For the most part it is a story of
bug-ridden rooms in working-men's hotels, of fights, drinking
bouts, cheap brothels, Russian refugees, cadging, swindling, and
temporary jobs. And the whole atmosphere of the poor quarters of
Paris as a foreigner sees them&mdash;the cobbled alleys, the sour
reek of refuse, the bistros with their greasy zinc counters and
worn brick floors, the green waters of the Seine, the blue cloaks
of the Republican Guard, the crumbling iron urinals, the peculiar
sweetish smell of the Metro stations, the cigarettes that come to
pieces, the pigeons in the Luxembourg Gardens&mdash;it is all
there, or at any rate the feeling of it is there.</p>

<p>On the face of it no material could be less promising. When
<i>Tropic of Cancer</i> was published the Italians were marching
into Abyssinia and Hitler's concentration camps were already
bulging. The intellectual foci of the world were Rome, Moscow, and
Berlin. It did not seem to be a moment at which a novel of
outstanding value was likely to be written about American
dead-beats cadging drinks in the Latin Quarter. Of course a
novelist is not obliged to write directly about contemporary
history, but a novelist who simply disregards the major public
events of the moment is generally either a footler or a plain
idiot. From a mere account of the subject matter of <i>Tropic of
Cancer</i> most people would probably assume it to be no more than
a bit of naughty-naughty left over from the twenties. Actually,
nearly everyone who read it saw at once that it was nothing of the
kind, but a very remarkable book. How or why remarkable? That
question is never easy to answer. It is better to begin by
describing the impression that <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> has left on
my own mind.</p>

<p>When I first opened <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> and saw that it was
full of unprintable words, my immediate reaction was a refusal to
be impressed. Most people's would be the same, I believe.
Nevertheless, after a lapse of time the atmosphere of the book,
besides innumerable details, seemed to linger in my memory in a
peculiar way. A year later Miller's second book, <i>Black
Spring</i>, was published. By this time? <i>Tropic of Cancer</i>
was much more vividly present in my mind than it had been when I
first read it. My first feeling about <i>Black Spring</i> was that
it showed a falling-off, and it is a fact that it has not the same
unity as the other book. Yet after another year there were many
passages in <i>Black Spring</i> that had also rooted themselves in
my memory. Evidently these books are of the sort to leave a flavour
behind them&mdash;books that 'create a world of their own', as the
saying goes. The books that do this are not necessarily good books,
they may be good bad books like <i>Raffles</i> or the <i>Sherlock
Holmes</i> stories, or perverse and morbid books like <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> or <i>The House with the Green Shutters</i>. But now
and again there appears a novel which opens up a new world not by
revealing what is strange, but by revealing what is familiar. The
truly remarkable thing about <i>Ulysses</i>, for instance, is the
commonplaceness of its material. Of course there is much more in
<i>Ulysses</i> than this, because Joyce is a kind of poet and also
an elephantine pedant, but his real achievement has been to get the
familiar on to paper. He dared&mdash;for it is a matter of daring
just as much as of technique&mdash;to expose the imbecilities of
the inner mind, and in doing so he discovered an America which was
under everybody's nose. Here is a whole world of stuff which you
supposed to be of its nature incommunicable, and somebody has
managed to communicate it. The effect is to break down, at any rate
momentarily, the solitude in which the human being lives. When you
read certain passages in <i>Ulysses</i> you feel that Joyce's mind
and your mind are one, that he knows all about you though he has
never heard your name, that there some world outside time and space
in which you and he are together. And though he does not resemble
Joyce in other ways, there is a touch of this quality in Henry
Miller. Not everywhere, because his work is very uneven, and
sometimes, especially in <i>Black Spring</i>, tends to slide away
into mere verbiage or into the squashy universe of the surrealists.
But read him for five pages, ten pages, and you feel the peculiar
relief that comes not so much from understanding as from being
<i>understood</i>. 'He knows all about me,' you feel; 'he wrote
this specially for me'. It is as though you could hear a voice
speaking to you, a friendly American voice, with no humbug in it,
no moral purpose, merely an implicit assumption that we are all
alike. For the moment you have got away from the lies and
simplifications, the stylized, marionette-like quality of ordinary
fiction, even quite good fiction, and are dealing with the
recognizable experiences of human beings.</p>

<p>But what kind of experience? What kind of human beings? Miller
is writing about the man in the street, and it is incidentally
rather a pity that it should be a street full of brothers. That is
the penalty of leaving your native land. It means transferring your
roots into shallower soil. Exile is probably more damaging to a
novelist than to a painter or even a poet, because its effect is to
take him out of contact with working life and narrow down his range
to the street, the café, the church, the brothel and the studio. On
the whole, in Miller's books you are reading about people living
the expatriate life, people drinking, talking, meditating, and
fornicating, not about people working, marrying, and bringing up
children; a pity, because he would have described the one set of
activities as well as the other. In <i>Black Spring</i> there is a
wonderful flashback of New York, the swarming Irish-infested New
York of the O. Henry period, but the Paris scenes are the best,
and, granted their utter worthlessness as social types, the drunks
and dead-beats of the cafés are handled with a feeling for
character and a mastery of technique that are unapproached in any
at all recent novel. All of them are not only credible but
completely familiar; you have the feeling that all their adventures
have happened to yourself. Not that they are anything very
startling in the way of adventures. Henry gets a job with a
melancholy Indian student, gets another job at a dreadful French
school during a cold snap when the lavatories are frozen solid,
goes on drinking bouts in Le Havre with his friend Collins, the sea
captain, goes to the brothels where there are wonderful Negresses,
talks with his friend Van Norden, the novelist, who has got the
great novel of the world in his head but can never bring himself to
begin writing it. His friend Karl, on the verge of starvation, is
picked up by a wealthy widow who wishes to marry him. There are
interminable Hamlet-like conversations in which Karl tries to
decide which is worse, being hungry or sleeping with an old woman.
In great detail he describes his visits to the widow, how he went
to the hotel dressed in his best, how before going in he neglected
to urinate, so that the whole evening was one long crescendo of
torment etc., etc. And after all, none of it is true, the widow
doesn't even exist&mdash;Karl has simply invented her in order to
make himself seem important. The whole book is in this vein, more
or less. Why is it that these monstrous trivialities are so
engrossing? Simply because the whole atmosphere is deeply familiar,
because you have all the while the feeling that these things are
happening to <i>you</i>. And you have this feeling because somebody
has chosen to drop the Geneva language of the ordinary novel and
drag the <i>real-politik</i> of the inner mind into the open. In
Miller's case it is not so much a question of exploring the
mechanisms of the mind as of owning up to everyday facts and
everyday emotions. For the truth is that many ordinary people,
perhaps an actual majority, do speak and behave in just the way
that is recorded here. The callous coarseness with which the
characters in <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> talk is very rare in fiction,
but it is extremely common in real life; again and again I have
heard just such conversations from people who were not even aware
that they were talking coarsely. It is worth noticing that
<i>Tropic Of Cancer</i> is not a young man's book. Miller was in
his forties when it was published, and though since then he has
produced three or four others, it is obvious that this first book
had been lived with for years. It is one of those books that are
slowly matured in poverty and obscurity, by people who know what
they have got to do and therefore are able to wait. The prose is
astonishing, and in parts of <i>Black Spring</i> is even better.
Unfortunately I cannot quote; unprintable words occur almost
everywhere. But get hold of <i>Tropic of Cancer</i>, get hold of
<i>Black Spring</i> and read especially the first hundred pages.
They give you an idea of what can still be done, even at this late
date, with English prose. In them, English is treated as a spoken
language, but spoken <i>without fear</i>, i.e. without fear of
rhetoric or of the unusual or poetical word. The adjective has come
back, after its ten years' exile. It is a flowing, swelling prose,
a prose with rhythms in it, something quite different from the flat
cautious statements and snack-bar dialects that are now in
fashion.</p>

<p>When a book like <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> appears, it is only
natural that the first thing people notice should be its obscenity.
Given our current notions of literary decency, it is not at all
easy to approach an unprintable book with detachment. Either one is
shocked and disgusted, or one is morbidly thrilled, or one is
determined above all else not to be impressed. The last is probably
the commonest reaction, with the result that unprintable books
often get less attention than they deserve. It is rather the
fashion to say that nothing is easier than to write an obscene
book, that people only do it in order to get themselves talked
about and make money, etc., etc. What makes it obvious that this is
not the case is that books which are obscene in the police-court
sense are distinctly uncommon. If there were easy money to be made
out of dirty words, a lot more people would be making it. But,
because 'obscene' books do not appear very frequently, there is a
tendency to lump them together, as a rule quite unjustifiably.
<i>Tropic of Cancer</i> has been vaguely associated with two other
books, <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Voyage au bout de la nuit</i>, but in
neither case is there much resemblance. What Miller has in common
with Joyce is a willingness to mention the inane, squalid facts of
everyday life. Putting aside differences of technique, the funeral
scene in <i>Ulysses</i>, for instance, would fit into <i>Tropic of
Cancer</i>; the whole chapter is a sort of confession, an exposé of
the frightful inner callousness of the human being. But there the
resemblance ends. As a novel, <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> is far
inferior to <i>Ulysses</i>. Joyce is an artist, in a sense in which
Miller is not and probably would not wish to be, and in any case he
is attempting much more. He is exploring different states of
consciousness, dream, reverie (the 'bronze-by-gold' chapter),
drunkenness, etc., and dovetailing them all into a huge complex
pattern, almost like a Victorian 'plot'. Miller is simply a
hard-boiled person talking about life, an ordinary American
businessman with intellectual courage and a gift for words. It is
perhaps significant that he looks exactly like everyone's idea of
an American businessman. As for the comparison with <i>Voyage au
bout de la nuit</i>, it is even further from the point. Both books,
use unprintable words, both are in some sense autobiographical, but
that is all. <i>Voyage au bout de la nuit</i> is a
book-with-a-purpose, and its purpose is to protest against the
horror and meaninglessness of modern life&mdash;actually, indeed,
of <i>life</i>. It is a cry of unbearable disgust, a voice from the
cesspool. <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> is almost exactly the opposite.
The thing has become so unusual as to seem almost anomalous, but it
is the book of a man who is happy. So is <i>Black Spring</i>,
though slightly less so, because tinged in places with nostalgia.
With years of lumpenproletarian life behind him, hunger,
vagabondage, dirt, failure, nights in the open, battles with
immigration officers, endless struggles for a bit of cash, Miller
finds that he is enjoying himself. Exactly the aspects of life that
fill Céline with horror are the ones that appeal to him. So far
from protesting, he is <i>accepting</i>. And the very word
'acceptance' calls up his real affinity, another American, Walt
Whitman.</p>

<p>But there is something rather curious in being Whitman in the
nineteen-thirties. It is not certain that if Whitman himself were
alive at the moment he would write anything in the least degree
resembling <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. For what he is saying, after
all, is 'I accept', and there is a radical difference between
acceptance now and acceptance then. Whitman was writing in a time
of unexampled prosperity, but more than that, he was writing in a
country where freedom was something more than a word. The
democracy, equality, and comradeship that he is always talking
about are not remote ideals, but something that existed in front of
his eyes. In mid-nineteenth-century America men felt themselves
free and equal, <i>were</i> free and equal, so far as that is
possible outside a society of pure communism. There was poverty and
there were even class distinctions, but except for the Negroes
there was no permanently submerged class. Everyone had inside him,
like a kind of core, the knowledge that he could earn a decent
living, and earn it without bootlicking. When you read about Mark
Twain's Mississippi raftsmen and pilots, or Bret Harte's Western
gold-miners, they seem more remote than the cannibals of the Stone
Age. The reason is simply that they are free human beings. But it
is the same even with the peaceful domesticated America of the
Eastern states, the America of the <i>Little Women</i>, <i>Helen's
Babies</i>, and <i>Riding Down from Bangor</i>. Life has a buoyant,
carefree quality that you can feel as you read, like a physical
sensation in your belly. It is this that Whitman is celebrating,
though actually he does it very badly, because he is one of those
writers who tell you what you ought to feel instead of making you
feel it. Luckily for his beliefs, perhaps, he died too early to see
the deterioration in American life that came with the rise of
large-scale industry and the exploiting of cheap immigrant
labour.</p>

<p>Miller's outlook is deeply akin to that of Whitman, and nearly
everyone who has read him has remarked on this. <i>Tropic of
Cancer</i> ends with an especially Whitmanesque passage, in which,
after the lecheries, the swindles, the fights, the drinking bouts,
and the imbecilities, he simply sits down and watches the Seine
flowing past, in a sort of mystical acceptance of thing-as-it-is.
Only, what is he accepting? In the first place, not America, but
the ancient bone-heap of Europe, where every grain of soil has
passed through innumerable human bodies. Secondly, not an epoch of
expansion and liberty, but an epoch of fear, tyranny, and
regimentation. To say 'I accept' in an age like our own is to say
that you accept concentration camps, rubber truncheons, Hitler,
Stalin, bombs, aeroplanes, tinned food, machine guns, putsches,
purges, slogans, Bedaux belts, gas masks, submarines, spies,
<i>provocateurs</i>, press censorship, secret prisons, aspirins,
Hollywood films, and political murders. Not only those things, of
course, but those things among others. And on the whole this is
Henry Miller's attitude. Not quite always, because at moments he
shows signs of a fairly ordinary kind of literary nostalgia. There
is a long passage in the earlier part of <i>Black Spring</i>, in
praise of the Middle Ages, which as prose must be one of the most
remarkable pieces of writing in recent years, but which displays an
attitude not very different from that of Chesterton. In <i>Max and
the White Phagocytes</i> there is an attack on modern American
civilization (breakfast cereals, cellophane, etc.) from the usual
angle of the literary man who hates industrialism. But in general
the attitude is 'Let's swallow it whole'. And hence the seeming
preoccupation with indecency and with the dirty-handkerchief side
of life. It is only seeming, for the truth is that ordinary
everyday life consists far more largely of horrors than writers of
fiction usually care to admit. Whitman himself 'accepted' a great
deal that his contemporaries found unmentionable. For he is not
only writing of the prairie, he also wanders through the city and
notes the shattered skull of the suicide, the 'grey sick faces of
onanists', etc, etc. But unquestionably our own age, at any rate in
Western Europe, is less healthy and less hopeful than the age in
which Whitman was writing. Unlike Whitman, we live in a
<i>shrinking</i> world. The 'democratic vistas' have ended in
barbed wire. There is less feeling of creation and growth, less and
less emphasis on the cradle, endlessly rocking, more and more
emphasis on the teapot, endlessly stewing. To accept civilization
as it is practically means accepting decay. It has ceased to be a
strenuous attitude and become a passive attitude&mdash;even
'decadent', if that word means anything.</p>

<p>But precisely because, in one sense, he is passive to
experience, Miller is able to get nearer to the ordinary man than
is possible to more purposive writers. For the ordinary man is also
passive. Within a narrow circle (home life, and perhaps the trade
union or local politics) he feels himself master of his fate, but
against major events he is as helpless as against the elements. So
far from endeavouring to influence the future, he simply lies down
and lets things happen to him. During the past ten years literature
has involved itself more and more deeply in politics, with the
result that there is now less room in it for the ordinary man than
at any time during the past two centuries. One can see the change
in the prevailing literary attitude by comparing the books written
about the Spanish civil war with those written about the war of
1914-18. The immediately striking thing about the Spanish war
books, at any rate those written in English, is their shocking
dullness and badness. But what is more significant is that almost
all of them, right-wing or left-wing, are written from a political
angle, by cocksure partisans telling you what to think, whereas the
books about the Great War were written by common soldiers or junior
officers who did not even pretend to understand what the whole
thing was about. Books like <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>,
<i>Le Feu</i>, <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>, <i>Death of a Hero</i>,
<i>Good-bye to all That</i>, <i>Memoirs of an Infantry Officer</i>,
and <i>A Subaltern on the Somme</i> were written not by
propagandists but by <i>victims</i>. They are saying, in effect,
'What the hell is all this about? God knows. All we can do is to
endure.' And though he is not writing about war, nor, on the whole,
about unhappiness, this is nearer to Miller's attitude than the
omniscience which is now fashionable. The <i>Booster</i>, a
short-lived periodical of which he was part-editor, used to
describe itself in its advertisements as 'non-political,
non-educational, non-progressive, non-co-operative, non-ethical,
non-literary, non-consistent, non-contemporary,' and Miller's own
work could be described in nearly the same terms. It is a voice
from the crowd, from the underling, from the third-class carriage,
from the ordinary, non-political, non-moral, passive man.</p>

<p>I have been using the phrase 'ordinary man' rather loosely, and
I have taken it for granted that the 'ordinary man' exists, a thing
now denied by some people. I do not mean that the people Miller is
writing about constitute a majority, still less that he is writing
about proletarians. No English or American novelist has as yet
seriously attempted that. And again, the people in <i>Tropic of
Cancer</i> fall short of being ordinary to the extent that they are
idle, disreputable, and more or less 'artistic.' As I have said
already, this a pity, but it is the necessary result of
expatriation. Miller's 'ordinary man' is neither the manual worker
nor the suburban householder, but the derelict, the
<i>déclassé</i>, the adventurer, the American intellectual without
roots and without money. Still, the experiences even of this type
overlap fairly widely with those of more normal people. Miller has
been able to get the most out of his rather limited material
because he has had the courage to identify with it. The ordinary
man, the 'average sensual man,' has been given the power of speech,
like Balaam's ass.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this is something out of date, or at any
rate out of fashion. The average sensual man is out of fashion.
Preoccupation with sex and truthfulness about the inner life are
out of fashion. American Paris is out of fashion. A book like
<i>Tropic of Cancer</i>, published at such a time, must be either a
tedious preciosity or something unusual, and I think a majority of
the people who have read it would agree that it is not the first.
It is worth trying to discover just what this escape from the
current literary fashion means. But to do that one has got to see
it against its background&mdash;that is, against the general
development of English literature in the twenty years since the
Great War.</p>

<p><b>II</b>
</p>

<p>When one says that a writer is fashionable one practically
always means that he is admired by people under thirty. At the
beginning of the period I am speaking of, the years during and
immediately after the war, the writer who had the deepest hold upon
the thinking young was almost certainly Housman. Among people who
were adolescent in the years 1910-25, Housman had an influence
which was enormous and is now not at all easy to understand. In
1920, when I was about seventeen, I probably knew the whole of the
<i>Shropshire Lad</i> by heart. I wonder how much impression the
<i>Shropshire Lad</i> makes at this moment on a boy of the same age
and more or less the same cast of mind? No doubt he has heard of it
and even glanced into it; it might strike him as cheaply
clever&mdash;probably that would be about all. Yet these are the
poems that I and my contemporaries used to recite to ourselves,
over and over, in a kind of ecstasy, just as earlier generations
had recited Meredith's 'Love in a Valley,' Swinburne's 'Garden of
Proserpine' etc., etc.</p>

<pre>
With rue my heart is laden
For golden friends I had,
For many a roselipt maiden
And many a lightfoot lad.

By brooks too broad for leaping
The lightfoot boys are laid;
The roselipt girls are sleeping
In fields where roses fade.
</pre>

<p>It just tinkles. But it did not seem to tinkle in 1920. Why does
the bubble always burst? To answer that question one has to take
account of the <i>external</i> conditions that make certain writers
popular at certain times. Housman's poems had not attracted much
notice when they were first published. What was there in them that
appealed so deeply to a single generation, the generation born
round about 1900?</p>

<p>In the first place, Housman is a 'country' poet. His poems are
full of the charm of buried villages, the nostalgia of place-names,
Clunton and Clunbury, Knighton, Ludlow, 'on Wenlock Edge', 'in
summer time on Bredon,' thatched roofs and the jingle of smithies,
the wild jonquils in the pastures, the 'blue, remembered hills.'
War poems apart, English verse of the 1910-25 period is mostly
'country.' The reason no doubt was that the
<i>rentier</i>-professional class was ceasing once and for all to
have any real relationship with the soil; but at any rate there
prevailed then, far more than now, a kind of snobbism of belonging
to the country and despising the town. England at that time was
hardly more an agricultural country than it is now, but before the
light industries began to spread themselves it was easier to think
of it as one. Most middle-class boys grew up within sight of a
farm, and naturally it was the picturesque side of farm life that
appealed to them&mdash;the ploughing, harvesting, stack-thrashing
and so forth. Unless he has to do it himself a boy is not likely to
notice the horrible drudgery of hoeing turnip, milking cows with
chapped teats at four o'clock in the morning, etc., etc. Just
before, just after, and for that matter, during the war was the
great age of the 'Nature poet,' the heyday of Richard Jefferies and
W. H. Hudson. Rupert Brooke's 'Grantchester,' the star poem of
1913, is nothing but an enormous gush of 'country' sentiment, a
sort of accumulated vomit from a stomach stuffed with place-names.
Considered as a poem 'Grantchester' is something worse than
worthless, but as an illustration of what the thinking middle-class
young of that period <i>felt</i> it is a valuable document.</p>

<p>Housman, however, did not enthuse over the rambler roses in the
week-ending spirit of Brooke and the others. The 'country' motif is
there all the time, but mainly as a background. Most of the poems
have a quasi-human subject, a kind of idealized rustic, in reality
Strephon or Corydon brought up to date. This in itself had a deep
appeal. Experience shows that overcivilized people enjoy reading
about rustics (key-phrase, 'close to the soil') because they
imagine them to be more primitive and passionate than themselves.
Hence the 'dark earth' novel of Sheila Kaye-Smith, etc. And at that
time a middle-class boy, with his 'country' bias, would identify
with an agricultural worker as he would never have done with a town
worker. Most boys had in their minds a vision of an idealized
ploughman, gipsy, poacher, or gamekeeper, always pictured as a
wild, free, roving blade, living a life of rabbit-snaring,
cockfighting, horses, beer, and women. Masefield's 'Everlasting
Mercy,' another valuable period-piece, immensely popular with boys
round about the war years, gives you this vision in a very crude
form. But Housman's Maurices and Terences could be taken seriously
where Masefield's Saul Kane could not; on this side of him, Housman
was Masefield with a dash of Theocritus. Moreover all his themes
are adolescent&mdash;murder, suicide, unhappy love, early death.
They deal with the simple, intelligible disasters that give you the
feeling of being up against the 'bedrock facts' of life:</p>

<pre>
The sun burns on the half-mown hill,
By now the blood has dried;
And Maurice among the hay lies still
And my knife is in his side.
</pre>

<p>And again:</p>

<pre>
They hand us now in Shrewsbury jail
And whistles blow forlorn,
And trains all night groan on the rail
To men who die at morn.
</pre>

<p>It is all more or less in the same tune. Everything comes
unstuck. 'Ned lies long in the churchyard and Tom lies long in
jail'. And notice also the exquisite self-pity&mdash;the 'nobody
loves me' feeling:</p>

<pre>
The diamond drops adorning
The low mound on the lea,
These are the tears of morning,
That weeps, but not for thee.
</pre>

<p>Hard cheese, old chap! Such poems might have been written
expressly for adolescents. And the unvarying sexual pessimism (the
girl always dies or marries somebody else) seemed like wisdom to
boys who were herded together in public schools and were
half-inclined to think of women as something unattainable. Whether
Housman ever had the same appeal for girls I doubt. In his poems
the woman's point of view is not considered, she is merely the
nymph, the siren, the treacherous half-human creature who leads you
a little distance and then gives you the slip.</p>

<p>But Housman would not have appealed so deeply to the people who
were young in 1920 if it had not been for another strain in him,
and that was his blasphemous, antinomian, 'cynical' strain. The
fight that always occurs between the generations was exceptionally
bitter at the end of the Great War; this was partly due to the war
itself, and partly it was an indirect result of the Russian
Revolution, but an intellectual struggle was in any case due at
about that date. Owing probably to the ease and security of life in
England, which even the war hardly disturbed, many people whose
ideas were formed in the eighties or earlier had carried them quite
unmodified into the nineteen-twenties. Meanwhile, so far as the
younger generation was concerned, the official beliefs were
dissolving like sand-castles. The slump in religious belief, for
instance, was spectacular. For several years the old-young
antagonism took on a quality of real hatred. What was left of the
war generation had crept out of the massacre to find their elders
still bellowing the slogans of 1914, and a slightly younger
generation of boys were writhing under dirty-minded celibate
schoolmasters. It was to these that Housman appealed, with his
implied sexual revolt and his personal grievance against God. He
was patriotic, it was true, but in a harmless old-fashioned way, to
the tune of red coats and 'God save the Queen' rather than steel
helmets and 'Hang the Kaiser'. And he was satisfyingly
anti-Christian&mdash;he stood for a kind of bitter, defiant
paganism, the conviction that life is short and the gods are
against you, which exactly fitted the prevailing mood of the young;
and all in charming fragile verse that was composed almost entirely
of words of one syllable.</p>

<p>It will be seen that I have discussed Housman as though he were
merely a propagandist, an utterer of maxims and quotable 'bits'.
Obviously he was more than that. There is no need to under-rate him
now because he was over-rated a few years ago. Although one gets
into trouble nowadays for saying so, there are a number of his
poems ('Into my heart an air that kills', for instance, and 'Is my
team ploughing?') that are not likely to remain long out of favour.
But at bottom it is always a writer's tendency, his 'purpose', his
'message', that makes him liked or disliked. The proof of this is
the extreme difficulty of seeing any literary merit in a book that
seriously damages your deepest beliefs. And no book is ever truly
neutral. Some or other tendency is always discernible, in verse as
much as in prose, even if it does no more than determine the form
and the choice of imagery. But poets who attain wide popularity,
like Housman, are as a rule definitely gnomic writers.</p>

<p>After the war, after Housman and the Nature poets, there appears
a group of writers of completely different tendency&mdash;Joyce,
Eliot, Pound, Lawrence, Wyndham, Lewis, Aldous Huxley, Lytton
Strachey. So far as the middle and late twenties go, these are 'the
movement', as surely as the Auden-Spender group have been 'the
movement' during the past few years. It is true that not all of the
gifted writers of the period can be fitted into the pattern. E. M.
Forster, for instance, though he wrote his best book in 1923 or
thereabouts, was essentially, pre-war, and Yeats does not seem in
either of his phases to belong to the twenties. Others who were
still living, Moore, Conrad, Bennett, Wells, Norman Douglas, had
shot their bolt before the war ever happened. On the other hand, a
writer who should be added to the group, though in the narrowly
literary sense he hardly 'belongs', is Somerset Maugham. Of course
the dates do not fit exactly; most of these writers had already
published books before the war, but they can be classified as
post-war in the same sense that the younger men now writing are
post-slump. Equally, of course, you could read through most of the
literary papers of the time without grasping that these people are
'the movement'. Even more then than at most times the big shots of
literary journalism were busy pretending that the age-before-last
had not come to an end. Squire ruled the <i>London Mercury</i>
Gibbs and Walpole were the gods of the lending libraries, there was
a cult of cheeriness and manliness, beer and cricket, briar pipes
and monogamy, and it was at all times possible to earn a few
guineas by writing an article denouncing 'high-brows'. But all the
same it was the despised highbrows who had captured the young. The
wind was blowing from Europe, and long before 1930 it had blown the
beer-and-cricket school naked, except for their knighthoods.</p>

<p>But the first thing one would notice about the group of writers
I have named above is that they do not look like a group. Moreover
several of them would strongly object to being coupled with several
of the others. Lawrence and Eliot were in reality antipathetic,
Huxley worshipped Lawrence but was repelled by Joyce, most of the
others would have looked down on Huxley, Strachey, and Maugham, and
Lewis attacked everyone in turn; indeed, his reputation as a writer
rests largely on these attacks. And yet there is a certain
temperamental similarity, evident enough now, though it would not
have been so a dozen years ago. What it amounts to is <i>pessimism
of outlook</i>. But it is necessary to make clear what is meant by
pessimism.</p>

<p>If the keynote of the Georgian poets was 'beauty of Nature', the
keynote of the post-war writers would be 'tragic sense of life'.
The spirit behind Housman's poems for instance, is not tragic,
merely querulous; it is hedonism disappointed. The same is true of
Hardy, though one ought to make an exception of <i>The Dynasts</i>.
But the Joyce-Eliot group come later in time, puritanism is not
their main adversary, they are able from the start to 'see through'
most of the things that their predecessors had fought for. All of
them are temperamentally hostile to the notion of 'progress'; it is
felt that progress not only doesn't happen, but <i>ought</i> not to
happen. Given this general similarity, there are, of course,
differences of approach between the writers I have named as well as
different degrees of talent. Eliot's pessimism is partly the
Christian pessimism, which implies a certain indifference to human
misery, partly a lament over the decadence of Western civilization
('We are the hollow men, we are the stuffed men', etc., etc.), a
sort of twilight-of-the-gods feeling, which finally leads him, in
Sweeney Agonistes for instance, to achieve the difficult feat of
making modern life out to be worse than it is. With Strachey it is
merely a polite eighteenth-century scepticism mixed up with a taste
for debunking. With Maugham it is a kind of stoical resignation,
the stiff upper lip of the pukka sahib somewhere east of Suez,
carrying on with his job without believing in it, like an Antonine
Emperor. Lawrence at first sight does not seem to be a pessimistic
writer, because, like Dickens, he is a 'change-of-heart' man and
constantly insisting that life here and now would be all right if
only you looked at it a little differently. But what he is
demanding is a movement away from our mechanized civilization,
which is not going to happen. Therefore his exasperation with the
present turns once more into idealization of the past, this time a
safely mythical past, the Bronze Age. When Lawrence prefers the
Etruscans (his Etruscans) to ourselves it is difficult not to agree
with him, and yet, after all, it is a species of defeatism, because
that is not the direction in which the world is moving. The kind of
life that he is always pointing to, a life centring round the
simple mysteries&mdash;sex, earth, fire, water, blood&mdash;is
merely a lost cause. All he has been able to produce, therefore, is
a wish that things would happen in a way in which they are
manifestly not going to happen. 'A wave of generosity or a wave of
death', he says, but it is obvious that there are no waves of
generosity this side of the horizon. So he flees to Mexico, and
then dies at forty-five, a few years before the wave of death gets
going. It will be seen that once again I am speaking of these
people as though they were not artists, as though they were merely
propagandists putting a 'message' across. And once again it is
obvious that all of them are more than that. It would be absurd,
for instance, to look on <i>Ulysses</i> as <i>merely</i> a show-up
of the horror of modern life, the 'dirty <i>Daily Mail</i> era', as
Pound put it. Joyce actually is more of a 'pure artist' than most
writers. But <i>Ulysses</i> could not have been written by someone
who was merely dabbling with word-patterns; it is the product of a
special vision of life, the vision of a Catholic who has lost his
faith. What Joyce is saying is 'Here is life without God. Just look
at it!' and his technical innovations, important though they are,
are primarily to serve this purpose.</p>

<p>But what is noticeable about all these writers is that what
'purpose' they have is very much up in the air. There is no
attention to the urgent problems of the moment, above all no
politics in the narrower sense. Our eyes are directed to Rome, to
Byzantium, to Montparnasse, to Mexico, to the Etruscans, to the
Subconscious, to the solar plexus&mdash;to everywhere except the
places where things are actually happening. When one looks back at
the twenties, nothing is queerer than the way in which every
important event in Europe escaped the notice of the English
intelligentsia. The Russian Revolution, for instance, all but
vanishes from the English consciousness between the death of Lenin
and the Ukraine famine&mdash;about ten years. Throughout those
years Russia means Tolstoy, Dostoievsky, and exiled counts driving
taxi-cabs. Italy means picture-galleries, ruins, churches, and
museums&mdash;but not Black-shirts. Germany means films, nudism,
and psychoanalysis&mdash;but not Hitler, of whom hardly anyone had
heard till 1931. In 'cultured' circles art-for-art's-saking
extended practically to a worship of the meaningless. Literature
was supposed to consist solely in the manipulation of words. To
judge a book by its subject matter was the unforgivable sin, and
even to be aware of its subject matter was looked on as a lapse of
a taste. About 1928, in one of the three genuinely funny jokes that
<i>Punch</i> has produced since the Great War, an intolerable youth
is pictured informing his aunt that he intends to 'write'. 'And
what are you going to write about, dear?' asks the aunt. 'My dear
aunt,' says the youth crushingly, 'one doesn't write <i>about</i>
anything, one just <i>writes</i>.' The best writers of the twenties
did not subscribe to this doctrine, their 'purpose' is in most
cases fairly overt, but it is usually 'purpose' along
moral-religious-cultural lines. Also, when translatable into
political terms, it is in no case 'left'. In one way or another the
tendency of all the writers in this group is conservative. Lewis,
for instance, spent years in frenzied witch-smellings after
'Bolshevism', which he was able to detect in very unlikely places.
Recently he has changed some of his views, perhaps influenced by
Hitler's treatment of artists, but it is safe to bet that he will
not go very far leftward. Pound seems to have plumped definitely
for Fascism, at any rate the Italian variety. Eliot has remained
aloof, but if forced at the pistol's point to choose between
Fascism and some more democratic form of socialism, would probably
choose Fascism. Huxley starts off with the usual despair-of-life,
then, under the influence of Lawrence's 'dark abdomen', tries
something called Life-Worship, and finally arrives at
pacifism&mdash;a tenable position, and at this moment an honourable
one, but probably in the long run involving rejection of socialism.
It is also noticeable that most of the writers in this group have a
certain tenderness for the Catholic Church, though not usually of a
kind that an orthodox Catholic would accept.</p>

<p>The mental connexion between pessimism and a reactionary outlook
is no doubt obvious enough. What is perhaps less obvious is just
<i>why</i> the leading writers of the twenties were predominantly
pessimistic. Why always the sense of decadence, the skulls and
cactuses, the yearning after lost faith and impossible
civilizations? Was it not, after all, <i>because</i> these people
were writing in an exceptionally comfortable epoch? It is just in
such times that 'cosmic despair' can flourish. People with empty
bellies never despair of the universe, nor even think about the
universe, for that matter. The whole period 1910-30 was a
prosperous one, and even the war years were physically tolerable if
one happened to be a non-combatant in one of the Allied countries.
As for the twenties, they were the golden age of the
<i>rentie</i>R-intellectual, a period of irresponsibility such as
the world had never before seen. The war was over, the new
totalitarian states had not arisen, moral and religious taboos of
all descriptions had vanished, and the cash was rolling in.
'Disillusionment' was all the fashion. Everyone with a safe
&pound;500 a year turned highbrow and began training himself in
<i>taedium vitae</i>. It was an age of eagles and of crumpets,
facile despairs, backyard Hamlets, cheap return tickets to the end
of the night. In some of the minor characteristic novels of the
period, books like <i>Told by an Idiot</i>, the despair-of-life
reaches a Turkish-bath atmosphere of self-pity. And even the best
writers of the time can be convicted of a too Olympian attitude, a
too great readiness to wash their hands of the immediate practical
problem. They see life very comprehensively, much more so than
those who come immediately before or after them, but they see it
through the wrong end of the telescope. Not that that invalidates
their books, as books. The first test of any work of art is
survival, and it is a fact that a great deal that was written in
the period 1910-30 has survived and looks like continuing to
survive. One has only to think of <i>Ulysses</i>, <i>Of Human
Bondage</i>, most of Lawrence's early work, especially his short
stories, and virtually the whole of Eliot's poems up to about 1930,
to wonder what is now being written that will wear so well.</p>

<p>But quite Suddenly, in the years 1930-5, something happens. The
literary climate changes. A new group of writers, Auden and Spender
and the rest of them, has made its appearance, and although
technically these writers owe something to their predecessors,
their 'tendency' is entirely different. Suddenly we have got out of
the twilight of the gods into a sort of Boy Scout atmosphere of
bare knees and community singing. The typical literary man ceases
to be a cultured expatriate with a leaning towards the Church, and
becomes an eager-minded schoolboy with a leaning towards Communism.
If the keynote of the writers of the twenties is 'tragic sense of
life', the keynote of the new writers is 'serious purpose'.</p>

<p>The differences between the two schools are discussed at some
length in Mr Louis MacNeice's book <i>Modern Poetry</i>. This book
is, of course, written entirely from the angle of the younger group
and takes the superiority of their standards for granted. According
to Mr MacNeice:</p>

<p>The poets of <i>New Signatures</i>*, unlike Yeats and Eliot, are
emotionally partisan. Yeats proposed to turn his back on desire and
hatred; Eliot sat back and watched other people's emotions with
ennui and an ironical self-pity...The whole poetry, on the other
hand, of Auden, Spender, and Day Lewis implies that they have
desires and hatreds of their own and, further, that they think some
things ought to be desired and others hated.</p>

<p>[* Note: Published in 1932.(Author's footnote)]</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>The poets of <i>New Signatures</i> have swung back...to the
Greek preference for information or statement. Then first
requirement is to have something to say, and after that you must
say it as well as you can.</p>

<p>In other words, 'purpose' has come back, the younger writers
have 'gone into politics'. As I have pointed out already, Eliot
&amp; Co. are not really so non-partisan as Mr MacNeice seems to
suggest. Still, it is broadly true that in the twenties the
literary emphasis was more on technique and less on subject matter
than it is now.</p>

<p>The leading figures in this group are Auden, Spender, Day Lewis,
MacNeice, and there is a long string of writers of more or less the
same tendency, Isherwood, John Lehmann, Arthur Calder-Marshall,
Edward Upward, Alee Brown, Philip Henderson, and many others. As
before, I am lumping them together simply according to tendency.
Obviously there are very great variations in talent. But when one
compares these writers with the Joyce-Eliot generation, the
immediately striking thing is how much easier it is to form them
into a group. Technically they are closer together, politically
they are almost indistinguishable, and their criticisms of one
another's work have always been (to put it mildly) good-natured.
The outstanding writers of the twenties were of very varied
origins, few of them had passed through the ordinary English
educational mill (incidentally, the best of them, barring Lawrence,
were not Englishmen), and most of them had had at some time to
struggle against poverty, neglect, and even downright persecution.
On the other hand, nearly all the younger writers fit easily into
the public-school-university-Bloomsbury pattern. The few who are of
proletarian origin are of the kind that is declassed early in life,
first by means of scholarships and then by the bleaching-tub of
London 'culture'. It is significant that several of the writers in
this group have been not only boys but, subsequently, masters at
public schools. Some years ago I described Auden as 'a sort of
gutless Kipling'. As criticism this was quite unworthy, indeed it
was merely a spiteful remark, but it is a fact that in Auden's
work, especially his earlier work, an atmosphere of
uplift&mdash;something rather like Kipling's If or Newbolt's Play
up, Play up, and Play the Game!&mdash;never seems to be very far
away. Take, for instance, a poem like 'You're leaving now, and it's
up to you boys'. It is pure scoutmaster, the exact note of the
ten-minutes' straight talk on the dangers of self-abuse. No doubt
there is an element of parody that he intends, but there is also a
deeper resemblance that he does not intend. And of course the
rather priggish note that is common to most of these writers is a
symptom, of release. By throwing 'pure art' overboard they have
freed themselves from the fear of being laughed at and vastly
enlarged their scope. The prophetic side of Marxism, for example,
is new material for poetry and has great possibilities.</p>

<pre>
We are nothing
We have fallen
Into the dark and shall be destroyed.
Think though, that in this darkness
We hold the secret hub of an idea
Whose living sunlit wheel revolves in future years outside.

(Spender, <i>Trial Of A Judge</i>)
</pre>

<p>But at the same time, by being Marxized literature has moved no
nearer to the masses. Even allowing for the time-lag, Auden and
Spender are somewhat farther from being popular writers than Joyce
and Eliot, let alone Lawrence. As before, there are many
contemporary writers who are outside the current, but there is not
much doubt about what is the current. For the middle and late
thirties, Auden Spender &amp; Co. <i>are</i> 'the movement', just
as Joyce, Eliot &amp; Co. were for the twenties. And the movement
is in the direction of some rather ill-defined thing called
Communism. As early as 1934 or 1935 it was considered eccentric in
literary circles not to be more or less 'left', and in another year
or two there had grown up a left-wing orthodoxy that made a certain
set of opinions absolutely <i>de rigueur</i> on certain subjects,
The idea had begun to gain ground (<i>vide</i> Edward Upward and
others) that a writer must either be actively 'left' or write
badly. Between 1935 and 1939 the Communist Party had an almost
irresistible fascination for any writer under forty. It became as
normal to hear that so-and-so had 'joined' as it had been a few
years earlier, when Roman Catholicism was fashionable, to hear that
So-and-so had 'been received'. For about three years, in fact, the
central stream of English literature was more or less directly
under Communist control. How was it possible for such a thing to
happen? And at the same time, what is meant by 'Communism'? It is
better to answer the second question first.</p>

<p>The Communist movement in Western Europe began, as a movement
for the violent overthrow of capitalism, and degenerated within a
few years into an instrument of Russian foreign policy. This was
probably inevitable when this revolutionary ferment that followed
the Great War had died down. So far as I know, the only
comprehensive history of this subject in English is Franz
Borkenau's book, <i>The Communist International</i>. What
Borkenau's facts even more than his deductions make clear is that
Communism could never have developed along its present lines if any
revolutionary feeling had existed in the industrialized countries.
In England, for instance, it is obvious that no such feeling has
existed for years past. The pathetic membership figures of all
extremist parties show this clearly. It is, only natural,
therefore, that the English Communist movement should be controlled
by people who are mentally subservient to Russia and have no real
aim except to manipulate British foreign policy in the Russian
interest. Of course such an aim cannot be openly admitted, and it
is this fact that gives the Communist Party its very peculiar
character. The more vocal kind of Communist is in effect a Russian
publicity agent posing as an international socialist. It is a pose
that is easily kept up at normal times, but becomes difficult in
moments of crisis, because of the fact that the U.S.S.R. is no more
scrupulous in its foreign policy than the rest of the Great Powers.
Alliances, changes of front etc., which only make sense as part of
the game of power politics have to be explained and justified in
terms of international socialism. Every time Stalin swaps partners,
'Marxism' has to be hammered into a new shape. This entails sudden
and violent changes of 'line', purges, denunciations, systematic
destruction of party literature, etc., etc. Every Communist is in
fact liable at any moment to have to alter his most fundamental
convictions, or leave the party. The unquestionable dogma of Monday
may become the damnable heresy of Tuesday, and so on. This has
happened at least three times during the past ten years. It follows
that in any Western country a Communist Party is always unstable
and usually very small. Its long-term membership really consists of
an inner ring of intellectuals who have identified with the Russian
bureaucracy, and a slightly larger body of working-class people who
feel a loyalty towards Soviet Russia without necessarily
understanding its policies. Otherwise there is only a shifting
membership, one lot coming and another going with each change of
'line'.</p>

<p>In 1930 the English Communist Party was a tiny, barely legal
organization whose main activity was libelling the Labour Party.
But by 1935 the face of Europe had changed, and left-wing politics
changed with it. Hitler had risen to power and begun to rearm, the
Russian five-year plans had succeeded, Russia had reappeared as a
great military power. As Hitler's three targets of attack were, to
all appearances, Great Britain, France, and the U.S.S.R., the three
countries were forced into a sort of uneasy <i>rapprochement</i>.
This meant that the English or French Communist was obliged to
become a good patriot and imperialist&mdash;that is, to defend the
very things he had been attacking for the past fifteen years. The
Comintern slogans suddenly faded from red to pink. 'World
revolution' and 'Social-Fascism' gave way to 'Defence of democracy'
and 'Stop Hitler'. The years 1935-9 were the period of anti-Fascism
and the Popular Front, the heyday of the Left Book Club, when red
Duchesses and 'broadminded' deans toured the battlefields of the
Spanish war and Winston Churchill was the blue-eyed boy of the
<i>Daily Worker</i>. Since then, of course, there has been yet
another change of 'line'. But what is important for my purpose is
that it was during the 'anti-Fascist' phase that the younger
English writers gravitated towards Communism.</p>

<p>The Fascism-democracy dogfight was no doubt an attraction in
itself, but in any case their conversion was due at about that
date. It was obvious that <i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism was
finished and that there had got to be some kind of reconstruction;
in the world of 1935 it was hardly possible to remain politically
indifferent. But why did these young men turn towards anything so
alien as Russian Communism? Why should <i>writers</i> be attracted
by a form of socialism that makes mental honesty impossible? The
explanation really lies in something that had already made itself
felt before the slump and before Hitler: middle-class
unemployment.</p>

<p>Unemployment is not merely a matter of not having a job. Most
people can get a job of sorts, even at the worst of times. The
trouble was that by about 1930 there was no activity, except
perhaps scientific research, the arts, and left-wing politics, that
a thinking person could believe in. The debunking of Western
civilization had reached its Climax and 'disillusionment' was
immensely widespread. Who now could take it for granted to go
through life in the ordinary middle-class way, as a soldier, a
clergyman, a stockbroker, an Indian Civil Servant, or what-not? And
how many of the values by which our grandfathers lived could not be
taken seriously? Patriotism, religion, the Empire, the family, the
sanctity of marriage, the Old School Tie, birth, breeding, honour,
discipline&mdash;anyone of ordinary education could turn the whole
lot of them inside out in three minutes. But what do you achieve,
after all, by getting rid of such primal things as patriotism and
religion? You have not necessarily got rid of the need for
<i>something to believe in</i>. There had been a sort of false dawn
a few years earlier when numbers of young intellectuals, including
several quite gifted writers (Evelyn Waugh, Christopher Hollis, and
others), had fled into the Catholic Church. It is significant that
these people went almost invariably to the Roman Church and not,
for instance, to the C. of E., the Greek Church, or the Protestants
sects. They went, that is, to the Church with a world-wide
organization, the one with a rigid discipline, the one with power
and prestige behind it. Perhaps it is even worth noticing that the
only latter-day convert of really first-rate gifts, Eliot, has
embraced not Romanism but Anglo-Catholicism, the ecclesiastical
equivalent of Trotskyism. But I do not think one need look farther
than this for the reason why the young writers of the thirties
flocked into or towards the Communist Party. If was simply
something to believe in. Here was a Church, an army, an orthodoxy,
a discipline. Here was a Fatherland and&mdash;at any rate since
1935 or thereabouts&mdash;a Fuehrer. All the loyalties and
superstitions that the intellect had seemingly banished could come
rushing back under the thinnest of disguises. Patriotism, religion,
empire, military glory&mdash;all in one word, Russia. Father, king,
leader, hero, saviour&mdash;all in one word, Stalin.
God&mdash;Stalin. The devil&mdash;Hitler. Heaven&mdash;Moscow.
Hell&mdash;Berlin. All the gaps were filled up. So, after all, the
'Communism' of the English intellectual is something explicable
enough. It is the patriotism of the deracinated.</p>

<p>But there is one other thing that undoubtedly contributed to the
cult of Russia among the English intelligentsia during these years,
and that is the softness and security of life in England itself.
With all its injustices, England is still the land of habeas
corpus, and the over-whelming majority of English people have no
experience of violence or illegality. If you have grown up in that
sort of atmosphere it is not at all easy to imagine what a despotic
régime is like. Nearly all the dominant writers of the thirties
belonged to the soft-boiled emancipated middle class and were too
young to have effective memories of the Great War. To people of
that kind such things as purges, secret police, summary executions,
imprisonment without trial etc., etc., are too remote to be
terrifying. They can swallow totalitarianism <i>because</i> they
have no experience of anything except liberalism. Look, for
instance, at this extract from Mr Auden's poem 'Spain'
(incidentally this poem is one of the few decent things that have
been written about the Spanish war):</p>

<pre>
To-morrow for the young, the poets exploding like bombs,
The walks by the lake, the weeks of perfect communion;
To-morrow the bicycle races
Through the suburbs on summer evenings. But to-day the struggle.

To-day the deliberate increase in the chances of death,
The conscious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder;
To-day the expending of powers
On the flat ephemeral pamphlet and the boring meeting.
</pre>

<p>The second stanza is intended as a sort of thumb-nail sketch of
a day in the life of a 'good party man'. In the-morning a couple of
political murders, a ten-minutes' interlude to stifle 'bourgeois'
remorse, and then a hurried luncheon and a busy afternoon and
evening chalking walls and distributing leaflets. All very
edifying. But notice the phrase 'necessary murder'. It could only
be written by a person to whom murder is at most a <i>word</i>.
Personally I would not speak so lightly of murder. It so happens
that I have seen the bodies of numbers of murdered men&mdash;I
don't mean killed in battle, I mean murdered. Therefore I have some
conception of what murder means&mdash;the terror, the hatred, the
howling relatives, the post-mortems, the blood, the smells. To me,
murder is something to be avoided. So it is to any ordinary person.
The Hitlers and Stalins find murder necessary, but they don't
advertise their callousness, and they don't speak of it as murder;
it is 'liquidation', 'elimination', or some other soothing phrase.
Mr Auden's brand of amoralism is only possible, if you are the kind
of person who is always somewhere else when the trigger is pulled.
So much of left-wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by
people who don't even know that fire is hot. The warmongering to
which the English intelligentsia gave themselves up in the period
1935-9 was largely based on a sense of personal immunity. The
attitude was very different in France, where the military service
is hard to dodge and even literary men know the weight of a
pack.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Mr Cyril Connolly's recent book, <i>Enemies
of Promise</i>, there occurs an interesting and revealing passage.
The first part of the book, is, more or less, an evaluation of
present-day literature. Mr Connolly belongs exactly to the
generation of the writers of 'the movement', and with not many
reservations their values are his values. It is interesting to
notice that among prose-writers her admires chiefly those
specialising in violence&mdash;the would-be tough American school,
Hemingway, etc. The latter part of the book, however, is
autobiographical and consists of an account, fascinatingly
accurate, of life at a preparatory school and Eton in the years
1910-20. Mr Connolly ends by remarking:</p>

<p>Were I to deduce anything from my feelings on leaving Eton, it
might be called <i>the theory of permanent adolescence</i>. It is
the theory that the experiences undergone by boys at the great
public schools are so intense as to dominate their lives and to
arrest their development.</p>

<p>When you read the second sentence in this passage, your natural
impulse is to look for the misprint. Presumably there is a 'not'
left out, or something. But no, not a bit of it! He means it! And
what is more, he is merely speaking the truth, in an inverted
fashion. 'Cultured' middle-class life has reached a depth of
softness at which a public-school education&mdash;five years in a
lukewarm bath of snobbery&mdash;can actually be looked back upon as
an eventful period. To nearly all the writers who have counted
during the thirties, what more has ever happened than Mr Connolly
records in <i>Enemies Of Promise</i>? It is the same pattern all
the time; public school, university, a few trips abroad, then
London. Hunger, hardship, solitude, exile, war, prison,
persecution, manual labour&mdash;hardly even words. No wonder that
the huge tribe known as 'the right left people' found it so easy to
condone the purge-and-trap side of the Russian régime and the
horrors of the first Five-Year Plan. They were so gloriously
incapable of understanding what it all meant.</p>

<p>By 1937 the whole of the intelligentsia was mentally at war.
Left-wing thought had narrowed down to 'anti-Fascism', i.e. to a
negative, and a torrent of hate-literature directed against Germany
and the politicians supposedly friendly to Germany was pouring from
the Press. The thing that, to me, was truly frightening about the
war in Spain was not such violence as I witnessed, nor even the
party feuds behind the lines, but the immediate reappearance in
left-wing circles of the mental atmosphere of the Great War. The
very people who for twenty years had sniggered over their own
superiority to war hysteria were the ones who rushed straight back
into the mental slum of 1915. All the familiar wartime idiocies,
spy-hunting, orthodoxy-sniffing (Sniff, sniff. Are you a good
anti-Fascist?), the retailing of atrocity stories, came back into
vogue as though the intervening years had never happened. Before
the end of the Spanish war, and even before Munich, some of the
better of the left-wing writers were beginning to squirm. Neither
Auden nor, on the whole, Spender wrote about the Spanish war in
quite the vein that was expected of them. Since then there has been
a change of feeling and much dismay and confusion, because the
actual course of events has made nonsense of the left-wing
orthodoxy of the last few years. But then it did not need very
great acuteness to see that much of it was nonsense from the start.
There is no certainty, therefore, that the next orthodoxy to emerge
will be any better than the last.</p>

<p>On the whole the literary history of the thirties seems to
justify the opinion that a writer does well to keep out of
politics. For any writer who accepts or partially accepts the
discipline of a political party is sooner or later faced with the
alternative: toe the line, or shut up. It is, of course, possible
to toe the line and go on writing&mdash;after a fashion. Any
Marxist can demonstrate with the greatest of ease that 'bourgeois'
liberty of thought is an illusion. But when he has finished his
demonstration there remains the psychological <i>fact</i> that
without this 'bourgeois' liberty the creative powers wither away.
In the future a totalitarian literature may arise, but it will be
quite different from anything we can now imagine. Literature as we
know it is an individual thing, demanding mental honesty and a
minimum of censorship. And this is even truer of prose than of
verse. It is probably not a coincidence that the best writers of
the thirties have been poets. The atmosphere of orthodoxy is always
damaging to prose, and above all it is completely ruinous to the
novel, the most anarchical of all forms of literature. How many
Roman Catholics have been good novelists? Even the handful one
could name have usually been bad Catholics. The novel is
practically a Protestant form of art; it is a product of the free
mind, of the autonomous individual. No decade in the past hundred
and fifty years has been so barren of imaginative prose as the
nineteen-thirties. There have been good poems, good sociological
works, brilliant pamphlets, but practically no fiction of any value
at all. From 1933 onwards the mental climate was increasingly
against it. Anyone sensitive enough to be touched by the
<i>Zeitgeist</i> was also involved in politics. Not everyone, of
course, was definitely in the political racket, but practically
everyone was on its periphery and more or less mixed up in
propaganda campaigns and squalid controversies. Communists and
near-Communists had a disproportionately large influence in the
literary reviews. It was a time of labels, slogans, and evasions.
At the worst moments you were expected to lock yourself up in a
constipating little cage of lies; at the best a sort of voluntary
censorship ('Ought I to say this? Is it pro-Fascist?') was at work
in nearly everyone's mind. It is almost inconceivable that good
novels should be written in such an atmosphere. 'Good novels are
not written by by orthodoxy-sniffers, nor by people who are
conscience-stricken about their own unorthodoxy. Good novels are
written by people who are <i>not frightened</i>. This brings me
back to Henry Miller.</p>

<p><b>III</b>
</p>

<p>If this were a likely, moment for the launching of 'schools'
literature, Henry Miller might be the starting-point of a new
'school'. He does at any rate mark an unexpected swing of the
pendulum. In his books one gets right away from the 'political
animal' and back to a viewpoint not only individualistic but
completely passive&mdash;the view-point of a man who believes the
world-process to be outside his control and who in any case hardly
wishes to control it.</p>

<p>I first met Miller at the end of 1936, when I was passing
through Paris on my way to Spain. What most intrigued me about him
was to find that he felt no interest in the Spanish war whatever.
He merely told me in forcible terms that to go to Spain at that
moment was the act of an idiot. He could understand anyone going
there from purely selfish motives, out of curiosity, for instance,
but to mix oneself up in such things <i>from a sense obligation</i>
was sheer stupidity. In any case my Ideas about combating Fascism,
defending democracy, etc., etc., were all baloney. Our civilization
was destined to be swept away and replaced by something so
different that we should scarcely regard it as human&mdash;a
prospect that did not bother him, he said. And some such outlook is
implicit throughout his work. Everywhere there is the sense of the
approaching cataclysm, and almost everywhere the implied belief
that it doesn't matter. The only political declaration which, so
far as I know, he has ever made in print is a purely negative one.
A year or so ago an American magazine, the <i>Marxist
Quarterly</i>, sent out a questionnaire to various American writers
asking them to define their attitude on the subject of war. Miller
replied in terms of extreme pacifism, an individual refusal to
fight, with no apparent wish to convert others to the same
opinion&mdash;practically, in fact, a declaration of
irresponsibility.</p>

<p>However, there is more than one kind of irresponsibility. As a
rule, writers who do not wish to identify themselves with the
historical process at the moment either ignore it or fight against
if. If they can ignore it, they are probably fools. If they can
understand it well enough to want to fight against it, they
probably have enough vision to realize that they cannot win. Look,
for instance, at a poem like 'The Scholar Gipsy', with its railing
against the 'strange disease of modern life' and its magnificent
defeatist simile is the final stanza. It expresses one of the
normal literary attitudes, perhaps actually the prevailing attitude
during the last hundred years. And on the other hand there are the
'progressives', the yea-sayers, the Shaw-Wells type, always leaping
forward to embrace the ego-projections which they mistake for the
future. On the whole the writers of the twenties took the first
line and the writers of the thirties the second. And at any given
moment, of course, there is a huge tribe of Barries and Deepings
and Dells who simply don't notice what is happening. Where Miller's
work is symptomatically important is in its avoidance of any of
these attitudes. He is neither pushing the world-process forward
nor trying to drag it back, but on the other hand he is by no means
ignoring it. I should say that he believes in the impending ruin of
Western Civilization much more firmly than the majority of
'revolutionary' writers; only he does not feel called upon to do
anything about it. He is fiddling While Rome is burning, and,
unlike the enormous majority of people who do this, fiddling with
his face towards the flames.</p>

<p>In <i>Max and the White Phagocytes</i> there is one of those
revealing passages in which a writer tells you a great deal about
himself while talking about somebody else. The book includes a long
essay on the diaries of Anais Nin, which I have never read, except
for a few fragments, and which I believe have not been published.
Miller claims that they are the only true feminine writing that has
ever appeared, whatever that may mean. But the interesting passage
is one in which he compares Anais Nin&mdash;evidently a completely
subjective, introverted writer&mdash;to Jonah in the whale's belly.
In passing he refers to an essay that Aldous Huxley wrote some
years ago about El Greco's picture, The Dream of Philip the Second.
Huxley remarks that the people in El Greco's pictures always look
as though they were in the bellies of whales, and professes to find
something peculiarly horrible in the idea of being in a 'visceral
prison'. Miller retorts that, on the contrary, there are many worse
things than being swallowed by whales, and the passage makes it
dear that he himself finds the idea rather attractive. Here he is
touching upon what is probably a very widespread fantasy. It is
perhaps worth noticing that everyone, at least every
English-speaking person, invariably speaks of Jonah and the
<i>whale</i>. Of course the creature that swallowed Jonah was a
fish, and was so described in the Bible (Jonah i. 17), but children
naturally confuse it with a whale, and this fragment of baby-talk
is habitually carried into later life&mdash;a sign, perhaps, of the
hold that the Jonah myth has upon our imaginations. For the fact is
that being inside a whale is a very comfortable, cosy, homelike
thought. The historical Jonah, if he can be so called, was glad
enough to escape, but in imagination, in day-dream, countless
people have envied him. It is, of course, quite obvious why. The
whale's belly is simply a womb big enough for an adult. There you
are, in the dark, cushioned space that exactly fits you, with yards
of blubber between yourself and reality, able to keep up an
attitude of the completest indifference, no matter what
<i>happens</i>. A storm that would sink all the battleships in the
world would hardly reach you as an echo. Even the whale's own
movements would probably be imperceptible to you. He might be
wallowing among the surface waves or shooting down into the
blackness of the middle seas (a mile deep, according to Herman
Melville), but you would never notice the difference. Short of
being dead, it is the final, unsurpassable stage of
irresponsibility. And however it may be with Anais Nin, there is no
question that Miller himself is inside the whale. All his best and
most characteristic passages are written from the angle of Jonah, a
willing Jonah. Not that he is especially introverted&mdash;quite
the contrary. In his case the whale happens to be transparent. Only
he feels no impulse to alter or control the process that he is
undergoing. He has performed the essential Jonah act of allowing
himself to be swallowed, remaining passive, <i>accepting</i>.</p>

<p>It will be seen what this amounts to. It is a species of
quietism, implying either complete unbelief or else a degree of
belief amounting to mysticism. The attitude is '<i>je m'en
fous</i>' or 'Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him',
whichever way you like to look at it; for practical purposes both
are identical, the moral in either case being 'Sit on your bum'.
But in a time like ours, is this a defensible attitude? Notice that
it is almost impossible to refrain from asking this question. At
the moment of writing, we are still in a period in which it is
taken for granted that books ought always to be positive, serious,
and 'constructive'. A dozen years ago this idea would have been
greeted with titters. ('My dear aunt, one doesn't write about
anything, one just <i>writes</i>.') Then the pendulum swung away
from the frivolous notion that art is merely technique, but it
swung a very long distance, to the point of asserting that a book
can only be 'good' if it is founded on a 'true' vision of life.
Naturally the people who believe this also believe that they are in
possession of the truth themselves. Catholic critics, for instance,
tend to claim that books are only 'good' when they are of Catholic
tendency. Marxist critics make the same claim more boldly for
Marxist books. For instance, Mr Edward Upward ('A Marxist
Interpretation of Literature,' in the <i>Mind In Chains</i>):</p>

<p>Literary criticism which aims at being Marxist must...proclaim
that no book written at the present time can be 'good' unless it is
written from a Marxist or near-Marxist viewpoint.</p>

<p>Various other writers have made similar or comparable
statements. Mr Upward italicizes 'at the present time' because, he
realizes that you cannot, for instance, dismiss <i>Hamlet</i> on
the ground that Shakespeare was not a Marxist. Nevertheless his
interesting essay only glances very shortly at this difficulty.
Much of the literature that comes to us out of the past is
permeated by and in fact founded on beliefs (the belief in the
immortality of the soul, for example) which now seem to us false
and in some cases contemptibly silly. Yet if is 'good' literature,
if survival is any test. Mr Upward would no doubt answer that a
belief which was appropriate several centuries ago might be
inappropriate and therefore stultifying now. But this does not get
one much farther, because it assumes that in any age there will be
<i>one</i> body of belief which is the current approximation to
truth, and that the best literature of the time will be more or
less in harmony with it. Actually no such uniformity has ever
existed. In seventeenth-century England, for instance, there was a
religious and political cleavage which distinctly resembled the
left-right antagonism of to-day. Looking back, most modern people
would feel that the bourgeois-Puritan viewpoint was a better
approximation to truth than the Catholic-feudal one. But it is
certainly not the case that all or even a majority of the best
writers of the time were puritans. And more than this, there exist
'good' writers whose world-view would in any age be recognized
false and silly. Edgar Allan Poe is an example. Poe's outlook is at
best a wild romanticism and at worst is not far from being insane
in the literal clinical sense. Why is it, then that stories like
The Black Cat, The Tell-tale Heart, The Fall of the House of Usher
and so forth, which might very nearly have been written by a
lunatic, do not convey a feeling of falsity? Because they are true
within a certain framework, they keep the rules of their own
peculiar world, like a Japanese picture. But it appears that to
write successfully about such a world you have got to believe in
it. One sees the difference immediately if one compares Poe's
<i>Tales</i> with what is, in my opinion, an insincere attempt to
work up a similar atmosphere, Julian Green's <i>Minuit</i>. The
thing that immediately strikes one about <i>Minuit</i> is that
there is no reason why any of the events in it should happen.
Everything is completely arbitrary; there is no emotional sequence.
But this is exactly what one does <i>not</i> feel with Poe's
stories. Their maniacal logic, in its own setting, is quite
convincing. When, for instance, the drunkard seizes the black cat
and cuts its eye out with his penknife, one knows exactly
<i>why</i> he did it, even to the point of feeling that one would
have done the same oneself. It seems therefore that for a creative
writer possession of the 'truth' is less important than emotional
sincerity. Even Mr Upward would not claim that a writer needs
nothing beyond a Marxist training. He also needs a talent. But
talent, apparently, is a matter of being able to care, of really
<i>believing</i> in your beliefs, whether they are true or false.
The difference between, for instance, Céline and Evelyn Waugh is a
difference of emotional intensity. It is the difference between
genuine despair and a despair that is at least partly a pretence.
And with this there goes another consideration which is perhaps
less obvious: that there are occasions when an 'untrue' belief is
more likely to be sincerely held than a 'true' one.</p>

<p>If one looks at the books of personal reminiscence written about
the war of 1914-18, one notices that nearly all that have remained
readable after a lapse of time are written from a passive, negative
angle. They are the records of something completely meaningless, a
nightmare happening in a void. That was not actually the truth
about the war, but it was the truth about the individual reaction.
The soldier advancing into a machine-gun barrage or standing
waist-deep in a flooded trench knew only that here was an appalling
experience in which he was all but helpless. He was likelier to
make a good book out of his helplessness and his ignorance than out
of a pretended power to see the whole thing in perspective. As for
the books that were written during the war itself, the best of them
were nearly all the work of people who simply turned their backs
and tried not to notice that the war was happening. Mr E. M.
Forster has described how in 1917 he read Prufrock and other of
Eliot's early poems, and how it heartened him at such a time to get
hold of poems that were 'innocent of public-spiritedness':</p>

<p>They sang of private disgust and diffidence, and of people who
seemed genuine because they were unattractive or weak...Here was a
protest, and a feeble one, and the more congenial for being o
feeble...He who could turn aside to complain of ladies and drawing
rooms preserved a tiny drop of our self-respect, he carried on the
human heritage.</p>

<p>That is very well said. Mr MacNeice, in the book I have referred
to already, quotes this passage and somewhat smugly adds:</p>

<p>Ten years later less feeble protests were to be made by poets
and the human heritage carried on rather differently...The
contemplation of a world of fragments becomes boring and Eliot's
successors are more interested in tidying it up.</p>

<p>Similar remarks are scattered throughout Mr MacNeice's book.
What he wishes us to believe is that Eliot's 'successors' (meaning
Mr MacNeice and his friends) have in some way 'protested' more
effectively than Eliot did by publishing Prufrock at the moment
when the Allied armies were assaulting the Hindenburg Line. Just
where these 'protests' are to be found I do not know. But in the
contrast between Mr Forster's comment and Mr MacNeice's lies all
the difference between a man who knows what the 1914-18 war was
like and a man who barely remembers it. The truth is that in 1917
there was nothing that a thinking and a sensitive person could do,
except to remain human, if possible. And a gesture of helplessness,
even of frivolity, might be the best way of doing that. If I had
been a soldier fighting in the Great War, I would sooner have got
hold of <i>Prufrock</i> than <i>The First Hundred Thousand</i> or
Horatio Bottomley's <i>Letters to the Boys in the Trenches</i>. I
should have felt, like Mr Forster, that by simply standing aloof
and keeping touch with pre-war emotions, Eliot was carrying on the
human heritage. What a relief it would have been at such a time, to
read about the hesitations of a middle-aged highbrow with a bald
spot! So different from bayonet-drill! After the bombs and the
food-queues and the recruiting-posters, a human voice! What a
relief!</p>

<p>But, after all, the war of 1914-18 was only a heightened moment
in an almost continuous crisis. At this date it hardly even needs a
war to bring home to us the disintegration of our society and the
increasing helplessness of all, decent people. It is for this
reason that I think that the passive, non-co-operative attitude
implied in Henry Miller's work is justified. Whether or not it is
an expression of what people <i>ought</i> to feel, it probably
comes somewhere near to expressing what they <i>do</i> feel. Once
again it is the human voice among the bomb-explosions, a friendly
American voice, 'innocent of public-spiritedness'. No sermons,
merely the subjective truth. And along those lines, apparently, it
is still possible for a good novel to be written. Not necessarily
an edifying novel, but a novel worth reading and likely to be
remembered after it is read.</p>

<p>While I have been writing this essay another European war has
broken out. It will either last several years and tear Western
civilization to pieces, or it will end inconclusively and prepare
the way for yet another war which will do the job once and for all.
But war is only 'peace intensified'. What is quite obviously
happening, war or no war, is the break-up of <i>laissez-faire</i>
capitalism and of the liberal-Christian culture. Until recently the
full implications of this were not foreseen, because it was
generally imagined that socialism could preserve and even enlarge
the atmosphere of liberalism. It is now beginning to be realized
how false this idea was. Almost certainly we are moving into an age
of totalitarian dictatorships&mdash;an age in which freedom of
thought will be at first a deadly sin and later on a meaningless
abstraction. The autonomous individual is going to be stamped out
of existence. But this means that literature, in the form in which
we know it, must suffer at least a temporary death. The literature
of liberalism is coming to an end and the literature of
totalitarianism has not yet appeared and is barely imaginable. As
for the writer, he is sitting on a melting iceberg; he is merely an
anachronism, a hangover from the bourgeois age, as surely doomed as
the hippopotamus. Miller seems to me a man out of the common
because he saw and proclaimed this fact a long while before most of
his contemporaries&mdash;at a time, indeed, when many of them were
actually burbling about a renaissance of literature. Wyndham Lewis
had said years earlier that the major history of the English
language was finished, but he was basing this on different and
rather trivial reasons. But from now onwards the all-important fact
for the creative writers going to be that this is not a writer's
world. That does not mean that he cannot help to bring the new
society into being, but he can take no part in the process <i>as a
writer</i>. For <i>as a writer</i> he is a liberal, and what is
happening is the destruction of liberalism. It seems likely,
therefore, that in the remaining years of free speech any novel
worth reading will follow more or less along the lines that Miller
has followed&mdash;I do not mean in technique or subject matter,
but in implied outlook. The passive attitude will come back, and it
will be more consciously passive than before. Progress and reaction
have both turned out to be swindles. Seemingly there is nothing
left but quietism&mdash;robbing reality of its terrors by simply
submitting to it. Get inside the whale&mdash;or rather, admit you
are inside the whale (for you <i>are</i>, of course). Give yourself
over to the world-process, stop fighting against it or pretending
that you control it; simply accept it, endure it, record it. That
seems to be the formula, that any sensitive novelist is now likely
to adopt. A novel on more positive, 'constructive' lines, and not
emotionally spurious, is at present very difficult to imagine.</p>

<p>But do I mean by this that Miller is a 'great author', a new
hope for English prose? Nothing of the kind. Miller himself would
be the last to claim or want any such thing. No doubt he will go on
writing&mdash;anybody who has once started always goes on
writing&mdash;and associated with him there are a number of writers
of approximately the same tendency, Lawrence Durrell, Michael
Fraenkel and others, almost amounting to a 'school'. But he himself
seems to me essentially a man of one book. Sooner or later I should
expect him to descend into unintelligibility, or into charlatanism:
there are signs of both in his later work. His last book, <i>Tropic
Of Capricorn</i>, I have not even read. This was not because I did
not want to read it, but because the police and Customs authorities
have so far managed to prevent me from getting hold of it. But it
would surprise me if it came anywhere near <i>Tropic of Cancer</i>
or the opening chapters of <i>Black Spring</i>. Like certain other
autobiographical novelists, he had it in him to do just one thing
perfectly, and he did it. Considering what the fiction of the
nineteen-thirties has been like, that is something.</p>

<p>Miller's books are published by the Obelisk Press in Paris. What
will happen to the Obelisk Press, now that war has broken out and
Jack Kathane, the publisher, is dead, I do not know, but at any
rate the books are still procurable. I earnestly counsel anyone who
has not done so to read at least <i>Tropic of Cancer</i>. With a
little ingenuity, or by paying a little over the published price,
you can get hold of it, and even if parts of it disgust you, it
will stick in your memory. It is also an 'important' book, in a
sense different from the sense in which that word is generally
used. As a rule novels are spoken of as 'important' when they are
either a 'terrible indictment' of something or other or when they
introduce some technical innovation. Neither of these applies to
<i>Tropic Of Cancer</i>. Its importance is merely symptomatic.
Here, in my opinion, is the only imaginative prose-writer of the
slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races
for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an
overstatement, it will probably be admitted that Miller is a writer
out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after
all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a
mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the
corpses. Symptomatically, that is more significant than the mere
fact that five thousand novels are published in England every year
and four thousand nine hundred of them are tripe. It is a
demonstration of the impossibility of any major literature until
the world has shaken itself into its new shape.</p>

<h2>THE ART OF DONALD MCGILL (1941)</h2>

<p>Who does not know the 'comics' of the cheap stationers' windows,
the penny or twopenny coloured post cards with their endless
succession of fat women in tight bathing-dresses and their crude
drawing and unbearable colours, chiefly hedge-sparrow's-egg tint
and Post Office red?</p>

<p>This question ought to be rhetorical, but it is curious fact
that many people seem to be unaware of the existence of these
things, or else to have a vague notion that they are something to
be found only at the seaside, like nigger minstrels or peppermint
rock. Actually they are on sale everywhere&mdash;they can be bought
at nearly any Woolworth's, for example&mdash;and they are evidently
produced in enormous numbers, new series constantly appearing. They
are not to be confused with the various other types of comic
illustrated post card, such as the sentimental ones dealing with
puppies and kittens or the Wendyish, sub-pornographic ones which
exploit the love affairs of children. They are a genre of their
own, specializing in very 'low' humour, the mother-in-law,
baby's-nappy, policemen's-boot type of joke, and distinguishable
from all the other kinds by having no artistic pretensions. Some
half-dozen publishing houses issue them, though the people who draw
them seem not to be numerous at any one time.</p>

<p>I have associated them especially with the name of Donald McGill
because he is not only the most prolific and by far the best of
contemporary post card artists, but also the most representative,
the most perfect in the tradition. Who Donald McGill is, I do not
know. He is apparently a trade name, for at least one series of
post cards is issued simply as 'The Donald McGill Comics', but he
is also unquestionable a real person with a style of drawing which
is recognizable at a glance. Anyone who examines his post cards in
bulk will notice that many of them are not despicable even as
drawings, but it would be mere dilettantism to pretend that they
have any direct aesthetic value. A comic post card is simply an
illustration to a joke, invariably a 'low' joke, and it stands or
falls by its ability to raise a laugh. Beyond that it has only
'ideological' interest. McGill is a clever draughtsman with a real
caricaturist's touch in the drawing of faces, but the special value
of his post cards is that they are so completely typical. They
represent, as it were, the norm of the comic post card. Without
being in the least imitative, they are exactly what comic post
cards have been any time these last forty years, and from them the
meaning and purpose of the whole genre can be inferred.</p>

<p>Get hold of a dozen of these things, preferably
McGill's&mdash;if you pick out from a pile the ones that seem to
you funniest, you will probably find that most of them are
McGill's&mdash;and spread them out on a table. What do you see?</p>

<p>Your first impression is of overpowering vulgarity. This is
quite apart from the ever-present obscenity, and apart also from
the hideousness of the colours. They have an utter low-ness of
mental atmosphere which comes out not only in the nature of the
jokes but, even more, in the grotesque, staring, blatant quality of
the drawings. The designs, like those of a child, are full of heavy
lines and empty spaces, and all the figures in them, every gesture
and attitude, are deliberately ugly, the faces grinning and
vacuous, the women monstrously parodied, with bottoms like
Hottentots. Your second impression, however, is of indefinable
familiarity. What do these things remind you of? What are they so
like? In the first place, of course, they remind you of the barely
different post cards which you probably gazed at in your childhood.
But more than this, what you are really looking at is something as
traditional as Greek tragedy, a sort of sub-world of smacked
bottoms and scrawny mothers-in-law which is a part of Western
European consciousness. Not that the jokes, taken one by one, are
necessarily stale. Not being debarred from smuttiness, comic post
cards repeat themselves less often than the joke columns in
reputable magazines, but their basic subject-matter, the
<i>kind</i> of joke they are aiming at, never varies. A few are
genuinely witty, in a Max Millerish style. Examples:</p>

<p>'I like seeing experienced girls home.'<br>
'But I'm not experienced!'<br>
'You're not home yet!'</p>

<p>'I've been struggling for years to get a fur coat. How did you
get yours?'<br>
'I left off struggling.'</p>

<p>JUDGE: 'You are prevaricating, sir. Did you or did you not sleep
with this woman?'<br>
Co-respondent: 'Not a wink, my lord!'</p>

<p>In general, however, they are not witty, but humorous, and it
must be said for McGill's post cards, in particular, that the
drawing is often a good deal funnier than the joke beneath it.
Obviously the outstanding characteristic of comic cards is their
obscenity, and I must discuss that more fully later. But I give
here a rough analysis of their habitual subject-matter, with such
explanatory remarks as seem to be needed:</p>

<p>SEX.&mdash;More than half, perhaps three-quarters, of the jokes
are sex jokes, ranging from the harmless to the all but
unprintable. First favourite is probably the illegitimate baby.
Typical captions: 'Could you exchange this lucky charm for a baby's
feeding-bottle?' 'She didn't ask me to the christening, so I'm not
going to the wedding.' Also newlyweds, old maids, nude statues and
women in bathing-dresses. All of these are <i>ipso facto</i> funny,
mere mention of them being enough to raise a laugh. The cuckoldry
joke is seldom exploited, and there are no references to
homosexuality.</p>

<p>Conventions of the sex joke:</p>

<p>(i) Marriage only benefits women. Every man is plotting
seduction and every woman is plotting marriage. No woman ever
remained unmarried voluntarily.</p>

<p>(ii) Sex-appeal vanishes at about the age of twenty-five.
Well-preserved and good-looking people beyond their first youth are
never represented. The amorous honeymooning couple reappear as the
grim-visaged wife and shapeless, moustachioed, red-nosed husband,
no intermediate stage being allowed for.</p>

<p>HOME LIFE&mdash;Next to sex, the henpecked husband is the
favourite joke. Typical caption: 'Did they get an X-ray of your
wife's jaw at the hospital?'&mdash;'No, they got a moving picture
instead.'</p>

<p>Conventions:</p>

<p>(i) There is no such thing as a happy marriage.</p>

<p>(ii) No man ever gets the better of a woman in argument.
Drunkenness&mdash;Both drunkenness and teetotalism are ipso facto
funny.</p>

<p>Conventions:</p>

<p>(i) All drunken men have optical illusions.</p>

<p>(ii) Drunkenness is something peculiar to middle-aged men.
Drunken youths or women are never represented.</p>

<p>W.C. JOKES&mdash;There is not a large number of these. Chamber
pots are ipso facto funny, and so are public lavatories. A typical
post card captioned 'A Friend in Need', shows a man's hat blown off
his head and disappearing down the steps of a ladies' lavatory.</p>

<p>INTER-WORKING-CLASS SNOBBERY&mdash;Much in these post cards
suggests that they are aimed at the better-off working class and
poorer middle class. There are many jokes turning on malapropisms,
illiteracy, dropped aitches and the rough manners of slum dwellers.
Countless post cards show draggled hags of the stage-charwoman type
exchanging 'unladylike' abuse. Typical repartee: 'I wish you were a
statue and I was a pigeon!' A certain number produced since the war
treat evacuation from the anti-evacuee angle. There are the usual
jokes about tramps, beggars and criminals, and the comic
maidservant appears fairly frequently. Also the comic navvy,
bargee, etc.; but there are no anti-Trade-Union jokes. Broadly
speaking, everyone with much over or much under &pound;5 a week is
regarded as laughable. The 'swell' is almost as automatically a
figure of fun as the slum-dweller.</p>

<p>STOCK FIGURES&mdash;Foreigners seldom or never appear. The chief
locality joke is the Scotsman, who is almost inexhaustible. The
lawyer is always a swindler, the clergyman always a nervous idiot
who says the wrong thing. The 'knut' or 'masher' still appears,
almost as in Edwardian days, in out-of-date looking evening-clothes
and an opera hat, or even spats and a knobby cane. Another survival
is the Suffragette, one of the big jokes of the pre-1914 period and
too valuable to be relinquished. She has reappeared, unchanged in
physical appearance, as the Feminist lecturer or Temperance
fanatic. A feature of the last few years is the complete absence of
anti-Jew post cards. The 'Jew joke', always somewhat more
ill-natured than the 'Scotch joke', disappeared abruptly soon after
the rise of Hitler.</p>

<p>POLITICS&mdash;Any contemporary event, cult or activity which
has comic possibilities (for example, 'free love', feminism,
A.R.P., nudism) rapidly finds its way into the picture post cards,
but their general atmosphere is extremely old-fashioned. The
implied political outlook is a Radicalism appropriate to about the
year 1900. At normal times they are not only not patriotic, but go
in for a mild guying of patriotism, with jokes about 'God save the
King', the Union Jack, etc. The European situation only began to
reflect itself in them at some time in 1939, and first did so
through the comic aspects of A.R.P. Even at this date few post
cards mention the war except in A.R.P. jokes (fat woman stuck in
the mouth of Anderson shelter: wardens neglecting their duty while
young woman undresses at window she has forgotten to black out,
etc., etc.) A few express anti-Hitler sentiments of a not very
vindictive kind. One, not McGill's, shows Hitler with the usual
hypertrophied backside, bending down to pick a flower. Caption;
'What would you do, chums?' This is about as high a flight of
patriotism as any post card is likely to attain. Unlike the
twopenny weekly papers, comic post cards are not the product of any
great monopoly company, and evidently they are not regarded as
having any importance in forming public opinion. There is no sign
in them of any attempt to induce an outlook acceptable to the
ruling class.</p>

<p>Here one comes back to the outstanding, all-important feature of
comic post cards&mdash;their obscenity. It is by this that everyone
remembers them, and it is also central to their purpose, though not
in a way that is immediately obvious.</p>

<p>A recurrent, almost dominant motif in comic post cards is the
woman with the stuck-out behind. In perhaps half of them, or more
than half, even when the point of the joke has nothing to do with
sex, the same female figure appears, a plump 'voluptuous' figure
with the dress clinging to it as tightly as another skin and with
breasts or buttocks grossly over-emphasized according to which way
it is turned. There can be no doubt that these pictures lift the
lid off a very widespread repression, natural enough in a country
whose women when young tend to be slim to the point of skimpiness.
But at the same time the McGill post card&mdash;and this applies to
all other post cards in this genre&mdash;is not intended as
pornography but, a subtler thing, as a skit on pornography. The
Hottentot figures of the women are caricatures of the Englishman's
secret ideal, not portraits of it. When one examines McGill's post
cards more closely, one notices that his brand of humour only has a
meaning in relation to a fairly strict moral code. Whereas in
papers like <i>Esquire</i>, for instance, or <i>La Vie
Parisienne</i>, the imaginary background of the jokes is always
promiscuity, the utter breakdown of all standards, the background
of the McGill post card is marriage. The four leading jokes are
nakedness, illegitimate babies, old maids and newly married
couples, none of which would seem funny in a really dissolute or
even 'sophisticated' society. The post cards dealing with honeymoon
couples always have the enthusiastic indecency of those village
weddings where it is still considered screamingly funny to sew
bells to the bridal bed. In one, for example, a young bridegroom is
shown getting out of bed the morning after his wedding night. 'The
first morning in our own little home, darling!' he is saying; 'I'll
go and get the milk and paper and bring you up a cup of tea.' Inset
is a picture of the front doorstep; on it are four newspapers and
four bottles of milk. This is obscene, if you like, but it is not
immoral. Its implication&mdash;and this is just the implication the
<i>Esquire</i> or the <i>New Yorker</i> would avoid at all
costs&mdash;is that marriage is something profoundly exciting and
important, the biggest event in the average human being's life.</p>

<p>So also with jokes about nagging wives and tyrannous
mothers-in-law. They do at least imply a stable society in which
marriage is indissoluble and family loyalty taken for granted. And
bound up with this is something I noted earlier, the fact there are
no pictures, or hardly any, of good-looking people beyond their
first youth. There is the 'spooning' couple and the middle-aged,
cat-and-dog couple, but nothing in between. The liaison, the
illicit but more or less decorous love-affair which used to be the
stock joke of French comic papers, is not a post card subject. And
this reflects, on a comic level, the working-class outlook which
takes it as a matter of course that youth and
adventure&mdash;almost, indeed, individual life&mdash;end with
marriage. One of the few authentic class-differences, as opposed to
class-distinctions, still existing in England is that the working
classes age very much earlier. They do not live less long, provided
that they survive their childhood, nor do they lose their physical
activity earlier, but they do lose very early their youthful
appearance. This fact is observable everywhere, but can be most
easily verified by watching one of the higher age groups
registering for military service; the middle&mdash;and upper-class
members look, on average, ten years younger than the others. It is
usual to attribute this to the harder lives that the working
classes have to live, but it is doubtful whether any such
difference now exists as would account for it. More probably the
truth is that the working classes reach middle age earlier because
they accept it earlier. For to look young after, say, thirty is
largely a matter of wanting to do so. This generalization is less
true of the better-paid workers, especially those who live in
council houses and labour-saving flats, but it is true enough even
of them to point to a difference of outlook. And in this, as usual,
they are more traditional, more in accord with the Christian past
than the well-to-do women who try to stay young at forty by means
of physical-jerks, cosmetics and avoidance of child-bearing. The
impulse to cling to youth at all costs, to attempt to preserve your
sexual attraction, to see even in middle age a future for yourself
and not merely for your children, is a thing of recent growth and
has only precariously established itself. It will probably
disappear again when our standard of living drops and our
birth-rate rises. 'Youth's a stuff will not endure' expresses the
normal, traditional attitude. It is this ancient wisdom that McGill
and his colleagues are reflecting, no doubt unconsciously, when
they allow for no transition stage between the honeymoon couple and
those glamourless figures, Mum and Dad.</p>

<p>I have said that at least half of McGill's post cards are sex
jokes, and a proportion, perhaps ten per cent, are far more obscene
than anything else that is now printed in England. Newsagents are
occasionally prosecuted for selling them, and there would be many
more prosecutions if the broadest jokes were not invariably
protected by double meanings. A single example will be enough to
show how this is done. In one post card, captioned 'They didn't
believe her', a young woman is demonstrating, with her hands held
apart, something about two feet long to a couple of open-mouthed
acquaintances. Behind her on the wall is a stuffed fish in a glass
case, and beside that is a photograph of a nearly naked athlete.
Obviously it is not the fish that she is referring to, but this
could never be proved. Now, it is doubtful whether there is any
paper in England that would print a joke of this kind, and
certainly there is no paper that does so habitually. There is an
immense amount of pornography of a mild sort, countless illustrated
papers cashing in on women's legs, but there is no popular
literature specializing in the 'vulgar', farcical aspect of sex. On
the other hand, jokes exactly like McGill's are the ordinary small
change of the revue and music-hall stage, and are also to be heard
on the radio, at moments when the censor happens to be nodding. In
England the gap between what can be said and what can be printed is
rather exceptionally wide. Remarks and gestures which hardly anyone
objects to on the stage would raise a public outcry if any attempt
were made to reproduce them on paper. (Compare Max Miller's stage
patter with his weekly column in the <i>Sunday Dispatch</i>) The
comic post cards are the only existing exception to this rule, the
only medium in which really 'low' humour is considered to be
printable. Only in post cards and on the variety stage can the
stuck-out behind, dog and lamp-post, baby's nappy type of joke be
freely exploited. Remembering that, one sees what function these
post cards, in their humble way, are performing.</p>

<p>What they are doing is to give expression to the Sancho Panza
view of life, the attitude to life that Miss Rebecca West once
summed up as 'extracting as much fun as possible from smacking
behinds in basement kitchens'. The Don Quixote-Sancho Panza
combination, which of course is simply the ancient dualism of body
and soul in fiction form, recurs more frequently in the literature
of the last four hundred years than can be explained by mere
imitation. It comes up again and again, in endless variations,
Bouvard and Pécuchet, Jeeves and Wooster, Bloom and Dedalus, Holmes
and Watson (the Holmes-Watson variant is an exceptionally subtle
one, because the usual physical characteristics of two partners
have been transposed). Evidently it corresponds to something
enduring in our civilization, not in the sense that either
character is to be found in a 'pure' state in real life, but in the
sense that the two principles, noble folly and base wisdom, exist
side by side in nearly every human being. If you look into your own
mind, which are you, Don Quixote or Sancho Panza? Almost certainly
you are both. There is one part of you that wishes to be a hero or
a saint, but another part of you is a little fat man who sees very
clearly the advantages of staying alive with a whole skin. He is
your unofficial self, the voice of the belly protesting against the
soul. His tastes lie towards safety, soft beds, no work, pots of
beer and women with 'voluptuous' figures. He it is who punctures
your fine attitudes and urges you to look after Number One, to be
unfaithful to your wife, to bilk your debts, and so on and so
forth. Whether you allow yourself to be influenced by him is a
different question. But it is simply a lie to say that he is not
part of you, just as it is a lie to say that Don Quixote is not
part of you either, though most of what is said and written
consists of one lie or the other, usually the first.</p>

<p>But though in varying forms he is one of the stock figures of
literature, in real life, especially in the way society is ordered,
his point of view never gets a fair hearing. There is a constant
world-wide conspiracy to pretend that he is not there, or at least
that he doesn't matter. Codes of law and morals, or religious
systems, never have much room in them for a humorous view of life.
Whatever is funny is subversive, every joke is ultimately a custard
pie, and the reason why so large a proportion of jokes centre round
obscenity is simply that all societies, as the price of survival,
have to insist on a fairly high standard of sexual morality. A
dirty joke is not, of course, a serious attack upon morality, but
it is a sort of mental rebellion, a momentary wish that things were
otherwise. So also with all other jokes, which always centre round
cowardice, laziness, dishonesty or some other quality which society
cannot afford to encourage. Society has always to demand a little
more from human beings than it will get in practice. It has to
demand faultless discipline and self-sacrifice, it must expect its
subjects to work hard, pay their taxes, and be faithful to their
wives, it must assume that men think it glorious to die on the
battlefield and women want wear themselves out with child-bearing.
The whole of what one may call official literature is founded on
such assumptions. I never read the proclamations of generals before
battle, the speeches of F&uuml;hrers and prime ministers, the
solidarity songs of public schools and left-wing political parties,
national anthems, Temperance tracts, papal encyclicals and sermons
against gambling and contraception, without seeming to hear in the
background a chorus of raspberries from all the millions of common
men to whom these high sentiments make no appeal. Nevertheless the
high sentiments always win in the end, leaders who offer blood,
toil, tears and sweat always get more out of their followers than
those who offer safety and a good time. When it comes to the pinch,
human beings are heroic. Women face childbed and the scrubbing
brush, revolutionaries keep their mouths shut in the torture
chamber, battleships go down with their guns still firing when
their decks are awash. It is only that the other element in man,
the lazy, cowardly, debt-bilking adulterer who is inside all of us,
can never be suppressed altogether and needs a hearing
occasionally.</p>

<p>The comic post cards are one expression of his point of view, a
humble one, less important than the music halls, but still worthy
of attention. In a society which is still basically Christian they
naturally concentrate on sex jokes; in a totalitarian society, if
they had any freedom of expression at all, they would probably
concentrate on laziness or cowardice, but at any rate on the
unheroic in one form or another. It will not do to condemn them on
the ground that they are vulgar and ugly. That is exactly what they
are meant to be. Their whole meaning and virtue is in their
unredeemed low-ness, not only in the sense of obscenity, but
lowness of outlook in every direction whatever. The slightest hint
of 'higher' influences would ruin them utterly. They stand for the
worm's-eye view of life, for the music-hall world where marriage is
a dirty joke or a comic disaster, where the rent is always behind
and the clothes are always up the spout, where the lawyer is always
a crook and the Scotsman always a miser, where the newly-weds make
fools of themselves on the hideous beds of seaside lodging-houses
and the drunken, red-nosed husbands roll home at four in the
morning to meet the linen-nightgowned wives who wait for them
behind the front door, poker in hand. Their existence, the fact
that people want them, is symptomatically important. Like the music
halls, they are a sort of saturnalia, a harmless rebellion against
virtue. They express only one tendency in the human mind, but a
tendency which is always there and will find its own outlet, like
water. On the whole, human beings want to be good, but not too
good, and not quite all the time. For:</p>

<p>there is a just man that perished in his righteousness, and
there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.
Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself over wise; why
shouldst thou destroy thyself? Be not overmuch wicked, neither be
thou foolish: why shouldst thou die before thy time?</p>

<p>In the past the mood of the comic post card could enter into the
central stream of literature, and jokes barely different from
McGill's could casually be uttered between the murders in
Shakespeare's tragedies. That is no longer possible, and a whole
category of humour, integral to our literature till 1800 or
thereabouts, has dwindled down to these ill-drawn post cards,
leading a barely legal existence in cheap stationers' windows. The
corner of the human heart that they speak for might easily manifest
itself in worse forms, and I for one should be sorry to see them
vanish.</p>

<h2>THE LION AND THE UNICORN: SOCIALISM AND THE ENGLISH GENIUS
(1941)</h2>

<p>Part I</p>

<p>England Your England</p>

<p><b>i.</b>
</p>

<p>As I write, highly civilized human beings are flying overhead,
trying to kill me.</p>

<p>They do not feel any enmity against me as an individual, nor I
against them. They are 'only doing their duty', as the saying goes.
Most of them, I have no doubt, are kind-hearted law-abiding men who
would never dream of committing murder in private life. On the
other hand, if one of them succeeds in blowing me to pieces with a
well-placed bomb, he will never sleep any the worse for it. He is
serving his country, which has the power to absolve him from
evil.</p>

<p>One cannot see the modern world as it is unless one recognizes
the overwhelming strength of patriotism, national loyalty. In
certain circumstances it can break down, at certain levels of
civilization it does not exist, but as a <i>positive</i> force
there is nothing to set beside it. Christianity and international
Socialism are as weak as straw in comparison with it. Hitler and
Mussolini rose to power in their own countries very largely because
they could grasp this fact and their opponents could not.</p>

<p>Also, one must admit that the divisions between nation and
nation are founded on real differences of outlook. Till recently it
was thought proper to pretend that all human beings are very much
alike, but in fact anyone able to use his eyes knows that the
average of human behaviour differs enormously from country to
country. Things that could happen in one country could not happen
in another. Hitler's June purge, for instance, could not have
happened in England. And, as western peoples go, the English are
very highly differentiated. There is a sort of back-handed
admission of this in the dislike which nearly all foreigners feel
for our national way of life. Few Europeans can endure living in
England, and even Americans often feel more at home in Europe.</p>

<p>When you come back to England from any foreign country, you have
immediately the sensation of breathing a different air. Even in the
first few minutes dozens of small things conspire to give you this
feeling. The beer is bitterer, the coins are heavier, the grass is
greener, the advertisements are more blatant. The crowds in the big
towns, with their mild knobby faces, their bad teeth and gentle
manners, are different from a European crowd. Then the vastness of
England swallows you up, and you lose for a while your feeling that
the whole nation has a single identifiable character. Are there
really such things as nations? Are we not forty-six million
individuals, all different? And the diversity of it, the chaos! The
clatter of clogs in the Lancashire mill towns, the to-and-fro of
the lorries on the Great North Road, the queues outside the Labour
Exchanges, the rattle of pin-tables in the Soho pubs, the old maids
hiking to Holy Communion through the mists of the autumn
morning&mdash;all these are not only fragments, but
<i>characteristic</i> fragments, of the English scene. How can one
make a pattern out of this muddle?</p>

<p>But talk to foreigners, read foreign books or newspapers, and
you are brought back to the same thought. Yes, there is something
distinctive and recognizable in English civilization. It is a
culture as individual as that of Spain. It is somehow bound up with
solid breakfasts and gloomy Sundays, smoky towns and winding roads,
green fields and red pillar-boxes. It has a flavour of its own.
Moreover it is continuous, it stretches into the future and the
past, there is something in it that persists, as in a living
creature. What can the England of 1940 have in common with the
England of 1840? But then, what have you in common with the child
of five whose photograph your mother keeps on the mantelpiece?
Nothing, except that you happen to be the same person.</p>

<p>And above all, it is <i>your</i> civilization, it is you.
However much you hate it or laugh at it, you will never be happy
away from it for any length of time. The suet puddings and the red
pillar-boxes have entered into your soul. Good or evil, it is
yours, you belong to it, and this side the grave you will never get
away from the marks that it has given you.</p>

<p>Meanwhile England, together with the rest of the world, is
changing. And like everything else it can change only in certain
directions, which up to a point can be foreseen. That is not to say
that the future is fixed, merely that certain alternatives are
possible and others not. A seed may grow or not grow, but at any
rate a turnip seed never grows into a parsnip. It is therefore of
the deepest importance to try and determine what England <i>is</i>,
before guessing what part England <i>can play</i> in the huge
events that are happening.</p>

<p><b>ii.</b>
</p>

<p>National characteristics are not easy to pin down, and when
pinned down they often turn out to be trivialities or seem to have
no connexion with one another. Spaniards are cruel to animals,
Italians can do nothing without making a deafening noise, the
Chinese are addicted to gambling. Obviously such things don't
matter in themselves. Nevertheless, nothing is causeless, and even
the fact that Englishmen have bad teeth can tell something about
the realities of English life.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of generalizations about England that would be
accepted by almost all observers. One is that the English are not
gifted artistically. They are not as musical as the Germans or
Italians, painting and sculpture have never flourished in England
as they have in France. Another is that, as Europeans go, the
English are not intellectual. They have a horror of abstract
thought, they feel no need for any philosophy or systematic
'world-view'. Nor is this because they are 'practical', as they are
so fond of claiming for themselves. One has only to look at their
methods of town planning and water supply, their obstinate clinging
to everything that is out of date and a nuisance, a spelling system
that defies analysis, and a system of weights and measures that is
intelligible only to the compilers of arithmetic books, to see how
little they care about mere efficiency. But they have a certain
power of acting without taking thought. Their world-famed
hypocrisy&mdash;their double-faced attitude towards the Empire, for
instance&mdash;is bound up with this. Also, in moments of supreme
crisis the whole nation can suddenly draw together and act upon a
species of instinct, really a code of conduct which is understood
by almost everyone, though never formulated. The phrase that Hitler
coined for the Germans, 'a sleep-walking people', would have been
better applied to the English. Not that there is anything to be
proud of in being called a sleep-walker.</p>

<p>But here it is worth noting a minor English trait which is
extremely well marked though not often commented on, and that is a
love of flowers. This is one of the first things that one notices
when one reaches England from abroad, especially if one is coming
from southern Europe. Does it not contradict the English
indifference to the arts? Not really, because it is found in people
who have no aesthetic feelings whatever. What it does link up with,
however, is another English characteristic which is so much a part
of us that we barely notice it, and that is the addiction to
hobbies and spare-time occupations, the <i>privateness</i> of
English life. We are a nation of flower-lovers, but also a nation
of stamp-collectors, pigeon-fanciers, amateur carpenters,
coupon-snippers, darts-players, crossword-puzzle fans. All the
culture that is most truly native centres round things which even
when they are communal are not official&mdash;the pub, the football
match, the back garden, the fireside and the 'nice cup of tea'. The
liberty of the individual is still believed in, almost as in the
nineteenth century. But this has nothing to do with economic
liberty, the right to exploit others for profit. It is the liberty
to have a home of your own, to do what you like in your spare time,
to choose your own amusements instead of having them chosen for you
from above. The most hateful of all names in an English ear is
Nosey Parker. It is obvious, of course, that even this purely
private liberty is a lost cause. Like all other modern people, the
English are in process of being numbered, labelled, conscripted,
'co-ordinated'. But the pull of their impulses is in the other
direction, and the kind of regimentation that can be imposed on
them will be modified in consequence. No party rallies, no Youth
Movements, no coloured shirts, no Jew-baiting or 'spontaneous'
demonstrations. No Gestapo either, in all probability.</p>

<p>But in all societies the common people must live to some extent
<i>against</i> the existing order. The genuinely popular culture of
England is something that goes on beneath the surface, unofficially
and more or less frowned on by the authorities. One thing one
notices if one looks directly at the common people, especially in
the big towns, is that they are not puritanical. They are
inveterate gamblers, drink as much beer as their wages will permit,
are devoted to bawdy jokes, and use probably the foulest language
in the world. They have to satisfy these tastes in the face of
astonishing, hypocritical laws (licensing laws, lottery acts, etc.
etc.) which are designed to interfere with everybody but in
practice allow everything to happen. Also, the common people are
without definite religious belief, and have been so for centuries.
The Anglican Church never had a real hold on them, it was simply a
preserve of the landed gentry, and the Nonconformist sects only
influenced minorities. And yet they have retained a deep tinge of
Christian feeling, while almost forgetting the name of Christ. The
power-worship which is the new religion of Europe, and which has
infected the English intelligentsia, has never touched the common
people. They have never caught up with power politics. The
'realism' which is preached in Japanese and Italian newspapers
would horrify them. One can learn a good deal about the spirit of
England from the comic coloured postcards that you see in the
windows of cheap stationers' shops. These things are a sort of
diary upon which the English people have unconsciously recorded
themselves. Their old-fashioned outlook, their graded snobberies,
their mixture of bawdiness and hypocrisy, their extreme gentleness,
their deeply moral attitude to life, are all mirrored there.</p>

<p>The gentleness of the English civilization is perhaps its most
marked characteristic. You notice it the instant you set foot on
English soil. It is a land where the bus conductors are
good-tempered and the policemen carry no revolvers. In no country
inhabited by white men is it easier to shove people off the
pavement. And with this goes something that is always written off
by European observers as 'decadence' or hypocrisy, the English
hatred of war and militarism. It is rooted deep in history, and it
is strong in the lower-middle class as well as the working class.
Successive wars have shaken it but not destroyed it. Well within
living memory it was common for 'the redcoats' to be booed at in
the streets and for the landlords of respectable public houses to
refuse to allow soldiers on the premises. In peace time, even when
there are two million unemployed, it is difficult to fill the ranks
of the tiny standing army, which is officered by the country gentry
and a specialized stratum of the middle class, and manned by farm
labourers and slum proletarians. The mass of the people are without
military knowledge or tradition, and their attitude towards war is
invariably defensive. No politician could rise to power by
promising them conquests or military 'glory', no Hymn of Hate has
ever made any appeal to them. In the last war the songs which the
soldiers made up and sang of their own accord were not vengeful but
humorous and mock-defeatist [Note, below]. The only enemy they ever
named was the sergeant-major.</p>

<p>[Note: For example:</p>

<pre>
'I don't want to join the bloody Army,
I don't want to go unto the war;
I want no more to roam,
I'd rather stay at home,
Living on the earnings of a whore.
</pre>

<p>But it was not in that spirit that they fought. (Author's
footnote.)]</p>

<p>In England all the boasting and flag-wagging, the 'Rule
Britannia' stuff, is done by small minorities. The patriotism of
the common people is not vocal or even conscious. They do not
retain among their historical memories the name of a single
military victory. English literature, like other literatures, is
full of battle-poems, but it is worth noticing that the ones that
have won for themselves a kind of popularity are always a tale of
disasters and retreats. There is no popular poem about Trafalgar or
Waterloo, for instance. Sir John Moore's army at Corunna, fighting
a desperate rearguard action before escaping overseas (just like
Dunkirk!) has more appeal than a brilliant victory. The most
stirring battle-poem in English is about a brigade of cavalry which
charged in the wrong direction. And of the last war, the four names
which have really engraved themselves on the popular memory are
Mons, Ypres, Gallipoli and Passchendaele, every time a disaster.
The names of the great battles that finally broke the German armies
are simply unknown to the general public.</p>

<p>The reason why the English anti-militarism disgusts foreign
observers is that it ignores the existence of the British Empire.
It looks like sheer hypocrisy. After all, the English have absorbed
a quarter of the earth and held on to it by means of a huge navy.
How dare they then turn round and say that war is wicked?</p>

<p>It is quite true that the English are hypocritical about their
Empire. In the working class this hypocrisy takes the form of not
knowing that the Empire exists. But their dislike of standing
armies is a perfectly sound instinct. A navy employs comparatively
few people, and it is an external weapon which cannot affect home
politics directly. Military dictatorships exist everywhere, but
there is no such thing as a naval dictatorship. What English people
of nearly all classes loathe from the bottom of their hearts is the
swaggering officer type, the jingle of spurs and the crash of
boots. Decades before Hitler was ever heard of, the word 'Prussian'
had much the same significance in England as 'Nazi' has today. So
deep does this feeling go that for a hundred years past the
officers of the British army, in peace time, have always worn
civilian clothes when off duty.</p>

<p>One rapid but fairly sure guide to the social atmosphere of a
country is the parade-step of its army. A military parade is really
a kind of ritual dance, something like a ballet, expressing a
certain philosophy of life. The goose-step, for instance, is one of
the most horrible sights in the world, far more terrifying than a
dive-bomber. It is simply an affirmation of naked power; contained
in it, quite consciously and intentionally, is the vision of a boot
crashing down on a face. Its ugliness is part of its essence, for
what it is saying is 'Yes, I am <i>ugly</i>, and you daren't laugh
at me', like the bully who makes faces at his victim. Why is the
goose-step not used in England? There are, heaven knows, plenty of
army officers who would be only too glad to introduce some such
thing. It is not used because the people in the street would laugh.
Beyond a certain point, military display is only possible in
countries where the common people dare not laugh at the army. The
Italians adopted the goose-step at about the time when Italy passed
definitely under German control, and, as one would expect, they do
it less well than the Germans. The Vichy government, if it
survives, is bound to introduce a stiffer parade-ground discipline
into what is left of the French army. In the British army the drill
is rigid and complicated, full of memories of the eighteenth
century, but without definite swagger; the march is merely a
formalized walk. It belongs to a society which is ruled by the
sword, no doubt, but a sword which must never be taken out of the
scabbard.</p>

<p>And yet the gentleness of English civilization is mixed up with
barbarities and anachronisms. Our criminal law is as out-of-date as
the muskets in the Tower. Over against the Nazi Storm Trooper you
have got to set that typically English figure, the hanging judge,
some gouty old bully with his mind rooted in the nineteenth
century, handing out savage sentences. In England people are still
hanged by the neck and flogged with the cat o' nine tails. Both of
these punishments are obscene as well as cruel, but there has never
been any genuinely popular outcry against them. People accept them
(and Dartmoor, and Borstal) almost as they accept the weather. They
are part of 'the law', which is assumed to be unalterable.</p>

<p>Here one comes upon an all-important English trait: the respect
for constitutionalism and legality, the belief in 'the law' as
something above the State and above the individual, something which
is cruel and stupid, of course, but at any rate
<i>incorruptible</i>.</p>

<p>It is not that anyone imagines the law to be just. Everyone
knows that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.
But no one accepts the implications of this, everyone takes it for
granted that the law, such as it is, will be respected, and feels a
sense of outrage when it is not. Remarks like 'They can't run me
in; I haven't done anything wrong', or 'They can't do that; it's
against the law', are part of the atmosphere of England. The
professed enemies of society have this feeling as strongly as
anyone else. One sees it in prison-books like Wilfred Macartney's
<i>Walls Have Mouths</i> or Jim Phelan's <i>Jail Journey</i>, in
the solemn idiocies that take place at the trials of conscientious
objectors, in letters to the papers from eminent Marxist
professors, pointing out that this or that is a 'miscarriage of
British justice'. Everyone believes in his heart that the law can
be, ought to be, and, on the whole, will be impartially
administered. The totalitarian idea that there is no such thing as
law, there is only power, has never taken root. Even the
intelligentsia have only accepted it in theory.</p>

<p>An illusion can become a half-truth, a mask can alter the
expression of a face. The familiar arguments to the effect that
democracy is 'just the same as' or 'just as bad as' totalitarianism
never take account of this fact. All such arguments boil down to
saying that half a loaf is the same as no bread. In England such
concepts as justice, liberty and objective truth are still believed
in. They may be illusions, but they are very powerful illusions.
The belief in them influences conduct, national life is different
because of them. In proof of which, look about you. Where are the
rubber truncheons, where is the castor oil? The sword is still in
the scabbard, and while it stays there corruption cannot go beyond
a certain point. The English electoral system, for instance, is an
all but open fraud. In a dozen obvious ways it is gerrymandered in
the interest of the moneyed class. But until some deep change has
occurred in the public mind, it cannot become <i>completely</i>
corrupt. You do not arrive at the polling booth to find men with
revolvers telling you which way to vote, nor are the votes
miscounted, nor is there any direct bribery. Even hypocrisy is a
powerful safeguard. The hanging judge, that evil old man in scarlet
robe and horse-hair wig, whom nothing short of dynamite will ever
teach what century he is living in, but who will at any rate
interpret the law according to the books and will in no
circumstances take a money bribe, is one of the symbolic figures of
England. He is a symbol of the strange mixture of reality and
illusion, democracy and privilege, humbug and decency, the subtle
network of compromises, by which the nation keeps itself in its
familiar shape.</p>

<p><b>iii.</b>
</p>

<p>I have spoken all the while of 'the nation', 'England',
'Britain', as though forty-five million souls could somehow be
treated as a unit. But is not England notoriously two nations, the
rich and the poor? Dare one pretend that there is anything in
common between people with &pound;100,000 a year and people with
&pound;1 a week? And even Welsh and Scottish readers are likely to
have been offended because I have used the word 'England' oftener
than 'Britain', as though the whole population dwelt in London and
the Home Counties and neither north nor west possessed a culture of
its own.</p>

<p>One gets a better view of this question if one considers the
minor point first. It is quite true that the so-called races of
Britain feel themselves to be very different from one another. A
Scotsman, for instance, does not thank you if you call him an
Englishman. You can see the hesitation we feel on this point by the
fact that we call our islands by no less than six different names,
England, Britain, Great Britain, the British Isles, the United
Kingdom and, in very exalted moments, Albion. Even the differences
between north and south England loom large in our own eyes. But
somehow these differences fade away the moment that any two Britons
are confronted by a European. It is very rare to meet a foreigner,
other than an American, who can distinguish between English and
Scots or even English and Irish. To a Frenchman, the Breton and the
Auvergnat seem very different beings, and the accent of Marseilles
is a stock joke in Paris. Yet we speak of 'France' and 'the
French', recognizing France as an entity, a single civilization,
which in fact it is. So also with ourselves. Looked at from the
outsider even the cockney and the Yorkshireman have a strong family
resemblance.</p>

<p>And even the distinction between rich and poor dwindles somewhat
when one regards the nation from the outside. There is no question
about the inequality of wealth in England. It is grosser than in
any European country, and you have only to look down the nearest
street to see it. Economically, England is certainly two nations,
if not three or four. But at the same time the vast majority of the
people <i>feel</i> themselves to be a single nation and are
conscious of resembling one another more than they resemble
foreigners. Patriotism is usually stronger than class-hatred, and
always stronger than any kind of internationalism. Except for a
brief moment in 1920 (the 'Hands off Russia' movement) the British
working class have never thought or acted internationally. For two
and a half years they watched their comrades in Spain slowly
strangled, and never aided them by even a single strike [Note,
below]. But when their own country (the country of Lord Nuffield
and Mr Montagu Norman) was in danger, their attitude was very
different. At the moment when it seemed likely that England might
be invaded, Anthony Eden appealed over the radio for Local Defence
Volunteers. He got a quarter of a million men in the first
twenty-four hours, and another million in the subsequent month. One
has only to compare these figures with, for instance, the number of
conscientious objectors to see how vast is the strength of
traditional loyalties compared with new ones.</p>

<p>[Note: It is true that they aided them to a certain extent with
money. Still, the sums raised for the various aid-Spain funds would
not equal five per cent of the turnover of the football pools
during the same period. (Author's footnote.)]</p>

<p>In England patriotism takes different forms in different
classes, but it runs like a connecting thread through nearly all of
them. Only the Europeanized intelligentsia are really immune to it.
As a positive emotion it is stronger in the middle class than in
the upper class&mdash;the cheap public schools, for instance, are
more given to patriotic demonstrations than the expensive
ones&mdash;but the number of definitely treacherous rich men, the
Laval-Quisling type, is probably very small. In the working class
patriotism is profound, but it is unconscious. The working man's
heart does not leap when he sees a Union Jack. But the famous
'insularity' and 'xenophobia' of the English is far stronger in the
working class than in the bourgeoisie. In all countries the poor
are more national than the rich, but the English working class are
outstanding in their abhorrence of foreign habits. Even when they
are obliged to live abroad for years they refuse either to accustom
themselves to foreign food or to learn foreign languages. Nearly
every Englishman of working-class origin considers it effeminate to
pronounce a foreign word correctly. During the war of 1914-18 the
English working class were in contact with foreigners to an extent
that is rarely possible. The sole result was that they brought back
a hatred of all Europeans, except the Germans, whose courage they
admired. In four years on French soil they did not even acquire a
liking for wine. The insularity of the English, their refusal to
take foreigners seriously, is a folly that has to be paid for very
heavily from time to time. But it plays its part in the English
mystique, and the intellectuals who have tried to break it down
have generally done more harm than good. At bottom it is the same
quality in the English character that repels the tourist and keeps
out the invader.</p>

<p>Here one comes back to two English characteristics that I
pointed out, seemingly at random, at the beginning of the last
chapter. One is the lack of artistic ability. This is perhaps
another way of saying that the English are outside the European
culture. For there is one art in which they have shown plenty of
talent, namely literature. But this is also the only art that
cannot cross frontiers. Literature, especially poetry, and lyric
poetry most of all, is a kind of family joke, with little or no
value outside its own language-group. Except for Shakespeare, the
best English poets are barely known in Europe, even as names. The
only poets who are widely read are Byron, who is admired for the
wrong reasons, and Oscar Wilde, who is pitied as a victim of
English hypocrisy. And linked up with this, though not very
obviously, is the lack of philosophical faculty, the absence in
nearly all Englishmen of any need for an ordered system of thought
or even for the use of logic.</p>

<p>Up to a point, the sense of national unity is a substitute for a
'world-view'. Just because patriotism is all but universal and not
even the rich are uninfluenced by it, there can be moments when the
whole nation suddenly swings together and does the same thing, like
a herd of cattle facing a wolf. There was such a moment,
unmistakably, at the time of the disaster in France. After eight
months of vaguely wondering what the war was about, the people
suddenly knew what they had got to do: first, to get the army away
from Dunkirk, and secondly to prevent invasion. It was like the
awakening of a giant. Quick! Danger! The Philistines be upon thee,
Samson! And then the swift unanimous action&mdash;and, then, alas,
the prompt relapse into sleep. In a divided nation that would have
been exactly the moment for a big peace movement to arise. But does
this mean that the instinct of the English will always tell them to
do the right thing? Not at all, merely that it will tell them to do
the same thing. In the 1931 General Election, for instance, we all
did the wrong thing in perfect unison. We were as single-minded as
the Gadarene swine. But I honestly doubt whether we can say that we
were shoved down the slope against our will.</p>

<p>It follows that British democracy is less of a fraud than it
sometimes appears. A foreign observer sees only the huge inequality
of wealth, the unfair electoral system, the governing-class control
over the press, the radio and education, and concludes that
democracy is simply a polite name for dictatorship. But this
ignores the considerable agreement that does unfortunately exist
between the leaders and the led. However much one may hate to admit
it, it is almost certain that between 1931 and 1940 the National
Government represented the will of the mass of the people. It
tolerated slums, unemployment and a cowardly foreign policy. Yes,
but so did public opinion. It was a stagnant period, and its
natural leaders were mediocrities.</p>

<p>In spite of the campaigns of a few thousand left-wingers, it is
fairly certain that the bulk of the English people were behind
Chamberlain's foreign policy. More, it is fairly certain that the
same struggle was going on in Chamberlain's mind as in the minds of
ordinary people. His opponents professed to see in him a dark and
wily schemer, plotting to sell England to Hitler, but it is far
likelier that he was merely a stupid old man doing his best
according to his very dim lights. It is difficult otherwise to
explain the contradictions of his policy, his failure to grasp any
of the courses that were open to him. Like the mass of the people,
he did not want to pay the price either of peace or of war. And
public opinion was behind him all the while, in policies that were
completely incompatible with one another. It was behind him when he
went to Munich, when he tried to come to an understanding with
Russia, when he gave the guarantee to Poland, when he honoured it,
and when he prosecuted the war half-heartedly. Only when the
results of his policy became apparent did it turn against him;
which is to say that it turned against its own lethargy of the past
seven years. Thereupon the people picked a leader nearer to their
mood, Churchill, who was at any rate able to grasp that wars are
not won without fighting. Later, perhaps, they will pick another
leader who can grasp that only Socialist nations can fight
effectively.</p>

<p>Do I mean by all this that England is a genuine democracy? No,
not even a reader of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> could quite swallow
that.</p>

<p>England is the most class-ridden country under the sun. It is a
land of snobbery and privilege, ruled largely by the old and silly.
But in any calculation about it one has got to take into account
its emotional unity, the tendency of nearly all its inhabitants to
feel alike and act together in moments of supreme crisis. It is the
only great country in Europe that is not obliged to drive hundreds
of thousands of its nationals into exile or the concentration camp.
At this moment, after a year of war, newspapers and pamphlets
abusing the Government, praising the enemy and clamouring for
surrender are being sold on the streets, almost without
interference. And this is less from a respect for freedom of speech
than from a simple perception that these things don't matter. It is
safe to let a paper like <i>Peace News</i> be sold, because it is
certain that ninety-five per cent of the population will never want
to read it. The nation is bound together by an invisible chain. At
any normal time the ruling class will rob, mismanage, sabotage,
lead us into the muck; but let popular opinion really make itself
heard, let them get a tug from below that they cannot avoid
feeling, and it is difficult for them not to respond. The left-wing
writers who denounce the whole of the ruling class as 'pro-Fascist'
are grossly over-simplifying. Even among the inner clique of
politicians who brought us to our present pass, it is doubtful
whether there were any <i>conscious</i> traitors. The corruption
that happens in England is seldom of that kind. Nearly always it is
more in the nature of self-deception, of the right hand not knowing
what the left hand doeth. And being unconscious, it is limited. One
sees this at its most obvious in the English press. Is the English
press honest or dishonest? At normal times it is deeply dishonest.
All the papers that matter live off their advertisements, and the
advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over news. Yet I do not
suppose there is one paper in England that can be straightforwardly
bribed with hard cash. In the France of the Third Republic all but
a very few of the newspapers could notoriously be bought over the
counter like so many pounds of cheese. Public life in England has
never been <i>openly</i> scandalous. It has not reached the pitch
of disintegration at which humbug can be dropped.</p>

<p>England is not the jewelled isle of Shakespeare's much-quoted
message, nor is it the inferno depicted by Dr Goebbels. More than
either it resembles a family, a rather stuffy Victorian family,
with not many black sheep in it but with all its cupboards bursting
with skeletons. It has rich relations who have to be kow-towed to
and poor relations who are horribly sat upon, and there is a deep
conspiracy of silence about the source of the family income. It is
a family in which the young are generally thwarted and most of the
power is in the hands of irresponsible uncles and bedridden aunts.
Still, it is a family. It has its private language and its common
memories, and at the approach of an enemy it closes its ranks. A
family with the wrong members in control&mdash;that, perhaps, is as
near as one can come to describing England in a phrase.</p>

<p><b>iv.</b>
</p>

<p>Probably the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of
Eton, but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost
there. One of the dominant facts in English life during the past
three quarters of a century has been the decay of ability in the
ruling class.</p>

<p>In the years between 1920 and 1940 it was happening with the
speed of a chemical reaction. Yet at the moment of writing it is
still possible to speak of a ruling class. Like the knife which has
had two new blades and three new handles, the upper fringe of
English society is still almost what it was in the mid nineteenth
century. After 1832 the old land-owning aristocracy steadily lost
power, but instead of disappearing or becoming a fossil they simply
intermarried with the merchants, manufacturers and financiers who
had replaced them, and soon turned them into accurate copies of
themselves. The wealthy ship owner or cotton-miller set up for
himself an alibi as a country gentleman, while his sons learned the
right mannerisms at public schools which had been designed for just
that purpose. England was ruled by an aristocracy constantly
recruited from parvenus. And considering what energy the self-made
men possessed, and considering that they were buying their way into
a class which at any rate had a tradition of public service, one
might have expected that able rulers could be produced in some such
way.</p>

<p>And yet somehow the ruling class decayed, lost its ability, its
daring, finally even its ruthlessness, until a time came when
stuffed shirts like Eden or Halifax could stand out as men of
exceptional talent. As for Baldwin, one could not even dignify him
with the name of stuffed shirt. He was simply a hole in the air.
The mishandling of England's domestic problems during the
nineteen-twenties had been bad enough, but British foreign policy
between 1931 and 1939 is one of the wonders of the world. Why? What
had happened? What was it that at every decisive moment made every
British statesman do the wrong thing with so unerring an
instinct?</p>

<p>The underlying fact was that the whole position of the moneyed
class had long ceased to be justifiable. There they sat, at the
centre of a vast empire and a world-wide financial network, drawing
interest and profits and spending them&mdash;on what? It was fair
to say that life within the British Empire was in many ways better
than life outside it. Still, the Empire was underdeveloped, India
slept in the Middle Ages, the Dominions lay empty, with foreigners
jealously barred out, and even England was full of slums and
unemployment. Only half a million people, the people in the country
houses, definitely benefited from the existing system. Moreover,
the tendency of small businesses to merge together into large ones
robbed more and more of the moneyed class of their function and
turned them into mere owners, their work being done for them by
salaried managers and technicians. For long past there had been in
England an entirely functionless class, living on money that was
invested they hardly knew where, the 'idle rich', the people whose
photographs you can look at in the <i>Tatler</i> and the
<i>Bystander</i>, always supposing that you want to. The existence
of these people was by any standard unjustifiable. They were simply
parasites, less useful to society than his fleas are to a dog.</p>

<p>By 1920 there were many people who were aware of all this. By
1930 millions were aware of it. But the British ruling class
obviously could not admit to themselves that their usefulness was
at an end. Had they done that they would have had to abdicate. For
it was not possible for them to turn themselves into mere bandits,
like the American millionaires, consciously clinging to unjust
privileges and beating down opposition by bribery and tear-gas
bombs. After all, they belonged to a class with a certain
tradition, they had been to public schools where the duty of dying
for your country, if necessary, is laid down as the first and
greatest of the Commandments. They had to <i>feel</i> themselves
true patriots, even while they plundered their countrymen. Clearly
there was only one escape for them&mdash;into stupidity. They could
keep society in its existing shape only by being <i>unable</i> to
grasp that any improvement was possible. Difficult though this was,
they achieved it, largely by fixing their eyes on the past and
refusing to notice the changes that were going on round them.</p>

<p>There is much in England that this explains. It explains the
decay of country life, due to the keeping-up of a sham feudalism
which drives the more spirited workers off the land. It explains
the immobility of the public schools, which have barely altered
since the eighties of the last century. It explains the military
incompetence which has again and again startled the world. Since
the fifties every war in which England has engaged has started off
with a series of disasters, after which the situation has been
saved by people comparatively low in the social scale. The higher
commanders, drawn from the aristocracy, could never prepare for
modern war, because in order to do so they would have had to admit
to themselves that the world was changing. They have always clung
to obsolete methods and weapons, because they inevitably saw each
war as a repetition of the last. Before the Boer War they prepared
for the Zulu War, before the 1914 for the Boer War, and before the
present war for 1914. Even at this moment hundreds of thousands of
men in England are being trained with the bayonet, a weapon
entirely useless except for opening tins. It is worth noticing that
the navy and, latterly, the air force, have always been more
efficient than the regular army. But the navy is only partially,
and the air force hardly at all, within the ruling-class orbit.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that so long as things were peaceful the
methods of the British ruling class served them well enough. Their
own people manifestly tolerated them. However unjustly England
might be organized, it was at any rate not torn by class warfare or
haunted by secret police. The Empire was peaceful as no area of
comparable size has ever been. Throughout its vast extent, nearly a
quarter of the earth, there were fewer armed men than would be
found necessary by a minor Balkan state. As people to live under,
and looking at them merely from a liberal, <i>negative</i>
standpoint, the British ruling class had their points. They were
preferable to the truly modern men, the Nazis and Fascists. But it
had long been obvious that they would be helpless against any
serious attack from the outside.</p>

<p>They could not struggle against Nazism or Fascism, because they
could not understand them. Neither could they have struggled
against Communism, if Communism had been a serious force in western
Europe. To understand Fascism they would have had to study the
theory of Socialism, which would have forced them to realize that
the economic system by which they lived was unjust, inefficient and
out-of-date. But it was exactly this fact that they had trained
themselves never to face. They dealt with Fascism as the cavalry
generals of 1914 dealt with the machine-guns&mdash;by ignoring it.
After years of aggression and massacres, they had grasped only one
fact, that Hitler and Mussolini were hostile to Communism.
Therefore, it was argued, they <i>must</i> be friendly to the
British dividend-drawer. Hence the truly frightening spectacle of
Conservative M.P.s wildly cheering the news that British ships,
bringing food to the Spanish Republican government, had been bombed
by Italian aeroplanes. Even when they had begun to grasp that
Fascism was dangerous, its essentially revolutionary nature, the
huge military effort it was capable of making, the sort of tactics
it would use, were quite beyond their comprehension. At the time of
the Spanish Civil War, anyone with as much political knowledge as
can be acquired from a sixpenny pamphlet on Socialism knew that, if
Franco won, the result would be strategically disastrous for
England; and yet generals and admirals who had given their lives to
the study of war were unable to grasp this fact. This vein of
political ignorance runs right through English official life,
through Cabinet ministers, ambassadors, consuls, judges,
magistrates, policemen. The policeman who arrests the 'red' does
not understand the theories the 'red' is preaching; if he did his
own position as bodyguard of the moneyed class might seem less
pleasant to him. There is reason to think that even military
espionage is hopelessly hampered by ignorance of the new economic
doctrines and the ramifications of the underground parties.</p>

<p>The British ruling class were not altogether wrong in thinking
that Fascism was on their side. It is a fact that any rich man,
unless he is a Jew, has less to fear from Fascism than from either
Communism or democratic Socialism. One ought never to forget this,
for nearly the whole of German and Italian propaganda is designed
to cover it up. The natural instinct of men like Simon, Hoare,
Chamberlain etc. was to come to an agreement with Hitler.
But&mdash;and here the peculiar feature of English life that I have
spoken of, the deep sense of national solidarity, comes
in&mdash;they could only do so by breaking up the Empire and
selling their own people into semi-slavery. A truly corrupt class
would have done this without hesitation, as in France. But things
had not gone that distance in England. Politicians who would make
cringing speeches about 'the duty of loyalty to our conquerors' are
hardly to be found in English public life. Tossed to and fro
between their incomes and their principles, it was impossible that
men like Chamberlain should do anything but make the worst of both
worlds.</p>

<p>One thing that has always shown that the English ruling class
are <i>morally</i> fairly sound, is that in time of war they are
ready enough to get themselves killed. Several dukes, earls and
what nots were killed in the recent campaign in Flanders. That
could not happen if these people were the cynical scoundrels that
they are sometimes declared to be. It is important not to
misunderstand their motives, or one cannot predict their actions.
What is to be expected of them is not treachery, or physical
cowardice, but stupidity, unconscious sabotage, an infallible
instinct for doing the wrong thing. They are not wicked, or not
altogether wicked; they are merely unteachable. Only when their
money and power are gone will the younger among them begin to grasp
what century they are living in.</p>

<p><b>v.</b>
</p>

<p>The stagnation of the Empire in the between-war years affected
everyone in England, but it had an especially direct effect upon
two important sub-sections of the middle class. One was the
military and imperialist middle class, generally nicknamed the
Blimps, and the other the left-wing intelligentsia. These two
seemingly hostile types, symbolic opposites&mdash;the half-pay
colonel with his bull neck and diminutive brain, like a dinosaur,
the highbrow with his domed forehead and stalk-like neck&mdash;are
mentally linked together and constantly interact upon one another;
in any case they are born to a considerable extent into the same
families.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago the Blimp class was already losing its
vitality. The middle-class families celebrated by Kipling, the
prolific lowbrow families whose sons officered the army and navy
and swarmed over all the waste places of the earth from the Yukon
to the Irrawaddy, were dwindling before 1914. The thing that had
killed them was the telegraph. In a narrowing world, more and more
governed from Whitehall, there was every year less room for
individual initiative. Men like Clive, Nelson, Nicholson, Gordon
would find no place for themselves in the modern British Empire. By
1920 nearly every inch of the colonial empire was in the grip of
Whitehall. Well-meaning, over-civilized men, in dark suits and
black felt hats, with neatly rolled umbrellas crooked over the left
forearm, were imposing their constipated view of life on Malaya and
Nigeria, Mombasa and Mandalay. The one-time empire builders were
reduced to the status of clerks, buried deeper and deeper under
mounds of paper and red tape. In the early twenties one could see,
all over the Empire, the older officials, who had known more
spacious days, writhing impotently under the changes that were
happening. From that time onwards it has been next door to
impossible to induce young men of spirit to take any part in
imperial administration. And what was true of the official world
was true also of the commercial. The great monopoly companies
swallowed up hosts of petty traders. Instead of going out to trade
adventurously in the Indies one went to an office stool in Bombay
or Singapore. And life in Bombay or Singapore was actually duller
and safer than life in London. Imperialist sentiment remained
strong in the middle class, chiefly owing to family tradition, but
the job of administering the Empire had ceased to appeal. Few able
men went east of Suez if there was any way of avoiding it.</p>

<p>But the general weakening of imperialism, and to some extent of
the whole British morale, that took place during the
nineteen-thirties, was partly the work of the left-wing
intelligentsia, itself a kind of growth that had sprouted from the
stagnation of the Empire.</p>

<p>It should be noted that there is now no intelligentsia that is
not in some sense 'left'. Perhaps the last right-wing intellectual
was T. E. Lawrence. Since about 1930 everyone describable as an
'intellectual' has lived in a state of chronic discontent with the
existing order. Necessarily so, because society as it was
constituted had no room for him. In an Empire that was simply
stagnant, neither being developed nor falling to pieces, and in an
England ruled by people whose chief asset was their stupidity, to
be 'clever' was to be suspect. If you had the kind of brain that
could understand the poems of T. S. Eliot or the theories of Karl
Marx, the higher-ups would see to it that you were kept out of any
important job. The intellectuals could find a function for
themselves only in the literary reviews and the left-wing political
parties.</p>

<p>The mentality of the English left-wing intelligentsia can be
studied in half a dozen weekly and monthly papers. The immediately
striking thing about all these papers is their generally negative,
querulous attitude, their complete lack at all times of any
constructive suggestion. There is little in them except the
irresponsible carping of people who have never been and never
expect to be in a position of power. Another marked characteristic
is the emotional shallowness of people who live in a world of ideas
and have little contact with physical reality. Many intellectuals
of the Left were flabbily pacifist up to 1935, shrieked for war
against Germany in the years 1935-9, and then promptly cooled off
when the war started. It is broadly though not precisely true that
the people who were most 'anti-Fascist' during the Spanish Civil
War are most defeatist now. And underlying this is the really
important fact about so many of the English
intelligentsia&mdash;their severance from the common culture of the
country.</p>

<p>In intention, at any rate, the English intelligentsia are
Europeanized. They take their cookery from Paris and their opinions
from Moscow. In the general patriotism of the country they form a
sort of island of dissident thought. England is perhaps the only
great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own
nationality. In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is
something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it
is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse
racing to suet puddings. It is a strange fact, but it is
unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel
more ashamed of standing to attention during 'God save the King'
than of stealing from a poor box. All through the critical years
many left-wingers were chipping away at English morale, trying to
spread an outlook that was sometimes squashily pacifist, sometimes
violently pro-Russian, but always anti-British. It is questionable
how much effect this had, but it certainly had some. If the English
people suffered for several years a real weakening of morale, so
that the Fascist nations judged that they were 'decadent' and that
it was safe to plunge into war, the intellectual sabotage from the
Left was partly responsible. Both the <i>New Statesman</i> and the
<i>News Chronicle</i> cried out against the Munich settlement, but
even they had done something to make it possible. Ten years of
systematic Blimp-baiting affected even the Blimps themselves and
made it harder than it had been before to get intelligent young men
to enter the armed forces. Given the stagnation of the Empire, the
military middle class must have decayed in any case, but the spread
of a shallow Leftism hastened the process.</p>

<p>It is clear that the special position of the English
intellectuals during the past ten years, as purely <i>negative</i>
creatures, mere anti-Blimps, was a by-product of ruling-class
stupidity. Society could not use them, and they had not got it in
them to see that devotion to one's country implies 'for better, for
worse'. Both Blimps and highbrows took for granted, as though it
were a law of nature, the divorce between patriotism and
intelligence. If you were a patriot you read <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i> and publicly thanked God that you were 'not brainy'.
If you were an intellectual you sniggered at the Union Jack and
regarded physical courage as barbarous. It is obvious that this
preposterous convention cannot continue. The Bloomsbury highbrow,
with his mechanical snigger, is as out-of-date as the cavalry
colonel. A modern nation cannot afford either of them. Patriotism
and intelligence will have to come together again. It is the fact
that we are fighting a war, and a very peculiar kind of war, that
may make this possible.</p>

<p><b>vi.</b>
</p>

<p>One of the most important developments in England during the
past twenty years has been the upward and downward extension of the
middle class. It has happened on such a scale as to make the old
classification of society into capitalists, proletarians and petit
bourgeois (small property-owners) almost obsolete.</p>

<p>England is a country in which property and financial power are
concentrated in very few hands. Few people in modern England
<i>own</i> anything at all, except clothes, furniture and possibly
a house. The peasantry have long since disappeared, the independent
shopkeeper is being destroyed, the small businessman is diminishing
in numbers. But at the same time modern industry is so complicated
that it cannot get along without great numbers of managers,
salesmen, engineers, chemists and technicians of all kinds, drawing
fairly large salaries. And these in turn call into being a
professional class of doctors, lawyers, teachers, artists, etc.
etc. The tendency of advanced capitalism has therefore been to
enlarge the middle class and not to wipe it out as it once seemed
likely to do.</p>

<p>But much more important than this is the spread of middle-class
ideas and habits among the working class. The British working class
are now better off in almost all ways than they were thirty years
ago. This is partly due to the efforts of the trade unions, but
partly to the mere advance of physical science. It is not always
realized that within rather narrow limits the standard of life of a
country can rise without a corresponding rise in real wages. Up to
a point, civilization can lift itself up by its boot-tags. However
unjustly society is organized, certain technical advances are bound
to benefit the whole community, because certain kinds of goods are
necessarily held in common. A millionaire cannot, for example,
light the streets for himself while darkening them for other
people. Nearly all citizens of civilized countries now enjoy the
use of good roads, germ-free water, police protection, free
libraries and probably free education of a kind. Public education
in England has been meanly starved of money, but it has
nevertheless improved, largely owing to the devoted efforts of the
teachers, and the habit of reading has become enormously more
widespread. To an increasing extent the rich and the poor read the
same books, and they also see the same films and listen to the same
radio programmes. And the differences in their way of life have
been diminished by the mass-production of cheap clothes and
improvements in housing. So far as outward appearance goes, the
clothes of rich and poor, especially in the case of women, differ
far less than they did thirty or even fifteen years ago. As to
housing, England still has slums which are a blot on civilization,
but much building has been done during the past ten years, largely
by the local authorities. The modern council house, with its
bathroom and electric light, is smaller than the stockbroker's
villa, but it is recognizably the same kind of house, which the
farm labourer's cottage is not. A person who has grown up in a
council housing estate is likely to be&mdash;indeed, visibly
is&mdash;more middle class in outlook than a person who has grown
up in a slum.</p>

<p>The effect of all this is a general softening of manners. It is
enhanced by the fact that modern industrial methods tend always to
demand less muscular effort and therefore to leave people with more
energy when their day's work is done. Many workers in the light
industries are less truly manual labourers than is a doctor or a
grocer. In tastes, habits, manners and outlook the working class
and the middle class are drawing together. The unjust distinctions
remain, but the real differences diminish. The old-style
'proletarian'&mdash;collarless, unshaven and with muscles warped by
heavy labour&mdash;still exists, but he is constantly decreasing in
numbers; he only predominates in the heavy-industry areas of the
north of England.</p>

<p>After 1918 there began to appear something that had never
existed in England before: people of indeterminate social class. In
1910 every human being in these islands could be 'placed' in an
instant by his clothes, manners and accent. That is no longer the
case. Above all, it is not the case in the new townships that have
developed as a result of cheap motor cars and the southward shift
of industry. The place to look for the germs of the future England
is in light-industry areas and along the arterial roads. In Slough,
Dagenham, Barnet, Letchworth, Hayes&mdash;everywhere, indeed, on
the outskirts of great towns&mdash;the old pattern is gradually
changing into something new. In those vast new wildernesses of
glass and brick the sharp distinctions of the older kind of town,
with its slums and mansions, or of the country, with its
manor-houses and squalid cottages, no longer exist. There are wide
gradations of income, but it is the same kind of life that is being
lived at different levels, in labour-saving flats or council
houses, along the concrete roads and in the naked democracy of the
swimming-pools. It is a rather restless, cultureless life, centring
round tinned food, <i>Picture Post</i>, the radio and the internal
combustion engine. It is a civilization in which children grow up
with an intimate knowledge of magnetoes and in complete ignorance
of the Bible. To that civilization belong the people who are most
at home in and most definitely <i>of</i> the modern world, the
technicians and the higher-paid skilled workers, the airmen and
their mechanics, the radio experts, film producers, popular
journalists and industrial chemists. They are the indeterminate
stratum at which the older class distinctions are beginning to
break down.</p>

<p>This war, unless we are defeated, will wipe out most of the
existing class privileges. There are every day fewer people who
wish them to continue. Nor need we fear that as the pattern changes
life in England will lose its peculiar flavour. The new red cities
of Greater London are crude enough, but these things are only the
rash that accompanies a change. In whatever shape England emerges
from the war it will be deeply tinged with the characteristics that
I have spoken of earlier. The intellectuals who hope to see it
Russianized or Germanized will be disappointed. The gentleness, the
hypocrisy, the thoughtlessness, the reverence for law and the
hatred of uniforms will remain, along with the suet puddings and
the misty skies. It needs some very great disaster, such as
prolonged subjugation by a foreign enemy, to destroy a national
culture. The Stock Exchange will be pulled down, the horse plough
will give way to the tractor, the country houses will be turned
into children's holiday camps, the Eton and Harrow match will be
forgotten, but England will still be England, an everlasting animal
stretching into the future and the past, and, like all living
things, having the power to change out of recognition and yet
remain the same.</p>

<p>Part II</p>

<p>Shopkeepers at War</p>

<p><b>i.</b>
</p>

<p>I began this book to the tune of German bombs, and I begin this
second chapter in the added racket of the barrage. The yellow gun
flashes are lighting the sky, the splinters are rattling on the
housetops, and London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling
down. Anyone able to read a map knows that we are in deadly danger.
I do not mean that we are beaten or need be beaten. Almost
certainly the outcome depends on our own will. But at this moment
we are in the soup, full fathom five, and we have been brought
there by follies which we are still committing and which will drown
us altogether if we do not mend our ways quickly.</p>

<p>What this war has demonstrated is that private capitalism, that
is, an economic system in which land, factories, mines and
transport are owned privately and operated solely for
profit&mdash;<i>does not work</i>. It cannot deliver the goods.
This fact had been known to millions of people for years past, but
nothing ever came of it, because there was no real urge from below
to alter the system, and those at the top had trained themselves to
be impenetrably stupid on just this point. Argument and propaganda
got one nowhere. The lords of property simply sat on their bottoms
and proclaimed that all was for the best. Hitler's conquest of
Europe, however, was a <i>physical</i> debunking of capitalism.
War, for all its evil, is at any rate an unanswerable test of
strength, like a try-your-grip machine. Great strength returns the
penny, and there is no way of faking the result.</p>

<p>When the nautical screw was first invented, there was a
controversy that lasted for years as to whether screw-steamers or
paddle-steamers were better. The paddle-steamers, like all obsolete
things, had their champions, who supported them by ingenious
arguments. Finally, however, a distinguished admiral tied a
screw-steamer and a paddle steamer of equal horse-power stern to
stern and set their engines running. That settled the question once
and for all. And it was something similar that happened on the
fields of Norway and of Flanders. Once and for all it was proved
that a planned economy is stronger than a planless one. But it is
necessary here to give some kind of definition to those much-abused
words, Socialism and Fascism.</p>

<p>Socialism is usually defined as "common ownership of the means
of production". Crudely: the State, representing the whole nation,
owns everything, and everyone is a State employee. This does
<i>not</i> mean that people are stripped of private possessions
such as clothes and furniture, but it <i>does</i> mean that all
productive goods, such as land, mines, ships and machinery, are the
property of the State. The State is the sole large-scale producer.
It is not certain that Socialism is in all ways superior to
capitalism, but it is certain that, unlike capitalism, it can solve
the problems of production and consumption. At normal times a
capitalist economy can never consume all that it produces, so that
there is always a wasted surplus (wheat burned in furnaces,
herrings dumped back into the sea etc etc) and always unemployment.
In time of war, on the other hand, it has difficulty in producing
all that it needs, because nothing is produced unless someone sees
his way to making a profit out of it. In a Socialist economy these
problems do not exist. The State simply calculates what goods will
be needed and does its best to produce them. Production is only
limited by the amount of labour and raw materials. Money, for
internal purposes, ceases to be a mysterious all-powerful thing and
becomes a sort of coupon or ration-ticket, issued in sufficient
quantities to buy up such consumption goods as may be available at
the moment.</p>

<p>However, it has become clear in the last few years that "common
ownership of the means of production" is not in itself a sufficient
definition of Socialism. One must also add the following:
approximate equality of incomes (it need be no more than
approximate), political democracy, and abolition of all hereditary
privilege, especially in education. These are simply the necessary
safeguards against the reappearance of a class system. Centralised
ownership has very little meaning unless the mass of the people are
living roughly upon an equal level, and have some kind of control
over the government. "The State" may come to mean no more than a
self-elected political party, and oligarchy and privilege can
return, based on power rather than on money.</p>

<p>But what then is Fascism?</p>

<p>Fascism, at any rate the German version, is a form of capitalism
that borrows from Socialism just such features as will make it
efficient for war purposes. Internally, Germany has a good deal in
common with a Socialist state. Ownership has never been abolished,
there are still capitalists and workers, and&mdash;this is the
important point, and the real reason why rich men all over the
world tend to sympathise with Fascism&mdash;generally speaking the
same people are capitalists and the same people workers as before
the Nazi revolution. But at the same time the State, which is
simply the Nazi Party, is in control of everything. It controls
investment, raw materials, rates of interest, working hours, wages.
The factory owner still owns his factory, but he is for practical
purposes reduced to the status of a manager. Everyone is in effect
a State employee, though the salaries vary very greatly. The mere
<i>efficiency</i> of such a system, the elimination of waste and
obstruction, is obvious. In seven years it has built up the most
powerful war machine the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>But the idea underlying Fascism is irreconcilably different from
that which underlies Socialism. Socialism aims, ultimately, at a
world-state of free and equal human beings. It takes the equality
of human rights for granted. Nazism assumes just the opposite. The
driving force behind the Nazi movement is the belief in human
<i>inequality</i>, the superiority of Germans to all other races,
the right of Germany to rule the world. Outside the German Reich it
does not recognise any obligations. Eminent Nazi professors have
"proved" over and over again that only Nordic man is fully human,
have even mooted the idea that non Nordic peoples (such as
ourselves) can interbreed with gorillas! Therefore, while a species
of war-Socialism exists within the German state, its attitude
towards conquered nations is frankly that of an exploiter. The
function of the Czechs, Poles, French, etc is simply to produce
such goods as Germany may need, and get in return just as little as
will keep them from open rebellion. If we are conquered, our job
will probably be to manufacture weapons for Hitler's forthcoming
wars with Russia and America. The Nazis aim, in effect, at setting
up a kind of caste system, with four main castes corresponding
rather closely to those of the Hindu religion. At the top comes the
Nazi party, second come the mass of the German people, third come
the conquered European populations. Fourth and last are to come the
coloured peoples, the "semi-apes" as Hitler calls them, who are to
be reduced quite openly to slavery.</p>

<p>However horrible this system may seem to us, <i>it works</i>. It
works because it is a planned system geared to a definite purpose,
world conquest, and not allowing any private interest, either of
capitalist or worker, to stand in its way. British capitalism does
not work, because it is a competitive system in which private
profit is and must be the main objective. It is a system in which
all the forces are pulling in opposite directions and the interests
of the individual are as often as not totally opposed to those of
the State.</p>

<p>All through the critical years British capitalism, with its
immense industrial plant and its unrivalled supply of skilled
labour, was unequal to the strain of preparing for war. To prepare
for war on the modern scale you have got to divert the greater part
of your national income to armaments, which means cutting down on
consumption goods. A bombing plane, for instance, is equivalent in
price to fifty small motor cars, or eighty thousand pairs of silk
stockings, or a million loaves of bread. Clearly you can't have
<i>many</i> bombing planes without lowering the national standard
of life. It is guns or butter, as Marshal Goering remarked. But in
Chamberlain's England the transition could not be made. The rich
would not face the necessary taxation, and while the rich are still
visibly rich it is not possible to tax the poor very heavily
either. Moreover, so long as <i>profit</i> was the main object the
manufacturer had no incentive to change over from consumption goods
to armaments. A businessman's first duty is to his shareholders.
Perhaps England needs tanks, but perhaps it pays better to
manufacture motor cars. To prevent war material from reaching the
enemy is common sense, but to sell in the highest market is a
business duty. Right at the end of August 1939 the British dealers
were tumbling over one another in their eagerness to sell Germany
tin, rubber, copper and shellac-and this in the clear, certain
knowledge that war was going to break out in a week or two. It was
about as sensible as selling somebody a razor to cut your throat
with. But it was "good business".</p>

<p>And now look at the results. After 1934 it was known that
Germany was rearming. After 1936 everyone with eyes in his head
knew that war was coming. After Munich it was merely a question of
how soon the war would begin. In September 1939 war broke out.
<i>Eight months later</i> it was discovered that, so far as
equipment went, the British army was barely beyond the standard of
1918. We saw our soldiers fighting their way desperately to the
coast, with one aeroplane against three, with rifles against tanks,
with bayonets against tommy-guns. There were not even enough
revolvers to supply all the officers. After a year of war the
regular army was still short of 300,000 tin hats. There had even,
previously, been a shortage of uniforms&mdash;this in one of the
greatest woollen-goods producing countries in the world!</p>

<p>What had happened was that the whole moneyed class, unwilling to
face a change in their way of life, had shut their eyes to the
nature of Fascism and modern war. And false optimism was fed to the
general public by the gutter press, which lives on its
advertisements and is therefore interested in keeping trade
conditions normal. Year after year the Beaverbrook press assured us
in huge headlines that <i>there will be no war</i>, and as late as
the beginning of 1939 Lord Rothermere was describing Hitler as "a
great gentleman". And while England in the moment of disaster
proved to be short of every war material except ships, it is not
recorded that there was any shortage of motor cars, fur coats,
gramophones, lipstick, chocolates or silk stockings. And dare
anyone pretend that the same tug-of-war between private profit and
public necessity is not still continuing? England fights for her
life, but business must fight for profits. You can hardly open a
newspaper without seeing the two contradictory processes happening
side by side. On the very same page you will find the Government
urging you to save and the seller of some useless luxury urging you
to spend. Lend to Defend, but Guinness is Good for You. Buy a
Spitfire, but also buy Haig and Haig, Pond's Face Cream and Black
Magic Chocolates.</p>

<p>But one thing gives hope&mdash;the visible swing in public
opinion. If we can survive this war, the defeat in Flanders will
turn out to have been one of the great turning-points in English
history. In that spectacular disaster the working class, the middle
class and even a section of the business community could see the
utter rottenness of private capitalism. Before that the case
against capitalism had never been <i>proved</i>. Russia, the only
definitely Socialist country, was backward and far away. All
criticism broke itself against the rat-trap faces of bankers and
the brassy laughter of stockbrokers. Socialism? Ha! ha! ha! Where's
the money to come from? Ha! ha! ha! The lords of property were firm
in their seats, and they knew it. But after the French collapse
there came something that could not be laughed away, something that
neither chequebooks nor policemen were any use against the bombing.
Zweee&mdash;<i>boom</i>! What's that? Oh, only a bomb on the Stock
Exchange. Zweee&mdash;<i>boom</i>! Another acre of somebody's
valuable slum-property gone west. Hitler will at any rate go down
in history as the man who made the City of London laugh on the
wrong side of its face. For the first time in their lives the
comfortable were uncomfortable, the professional optimists had to
admit that there was something wrong. It was a great step forward.
From that time onwards the ghastly job of trying to convince
artificially stupefied people that a planned economy might be
better than a free-for-all in which the worst man wins-that job
will never be quite so ghastly again.</p>

<p><b>ii.</b>
</p>

<p>The difference between Socialism and capitalism is not primarily
a difference of technique. One cannot simply change from one system
to the other as one might install a new piece of machinery in a
factory, and then carry on as before, with the same people in
positions of control. Obviously there is also needed a complete
shift of power. New blood, new men, new ideas&mdash;in the true
sense of the word, a revolution.</p>

<p>I have spoken earlier of the soundness and homogeneity of
England, the patriotism that runs like a connecting thread through
almost all classes. After Dunkirk anyone who had eyes in his head
could see this. But it is absurd to pretend that the promise of
that moment has been fulfilled. Almost certainly the mass of the
people are now ready for the vast changes that are necessary; but
those changes have not even begun to happen.</p>

<p>England is a family with the wrong members in control. Almost
entirely we are governed by the rich, and by people who step into
positions of command by right of birth. Few if any of these people
are consciously treacherous, some of them are not even fools, but
as a class they are quite incapable of leading us to victory. They
could not do it, even if their material interests did not
constantly trip them up. As I pointed out earlier, they have been
artificially stupefied. Quite apart from anything else, the rule of
money sees to it that we shall be governed largely by the
old&mdash;that is, by people utterly unable to grasp what age they
are living in or what enemy they are fighting. Nothing was more
desolating at the beginning of this war than the way in which the
whole of the older generation conspired to pretend that it was the
war of 1914-18 over again. All the old duds were back on the job,
twenty years older, with the skull plainer in their faces. Ian Hay
was cheering up the troops, Belloc was writing articles on
strategy, Maurois doing broadcasts, Bairnsfather drawing cartoons.
It was like a tea-party of ghosts. And that state of affairs has
barely altered. The shock of disaster brought a few able men like
Bevin to the front, but in general we are still commanded by people
who managed to live through the years 1931-9 without even
discovering that Hitler was dangerous. A generation of the
unteachable is hanging upon us like a necklace of corpses.</p>

<p>As soon as one considers any problem of this war&mdash;and it
does not matter whether it is the widest aspect of strategy or the
tiniest detail of home organisation&mdash;one sees that the
necessary moves cannot be made while the social structure of
England remains what it is. Inevitably, because of their position
and upbringing, the ruling class are fighting for their own
privileges, which cannot possibly be reconciled with the public
interest. It is a mistake to imagine that war aims, strategy,
propaganda and industrial organisation exist in watertight
compartments. All are interconnected. Every strategic plan, every
tactical method, even every weapon will bear the stamp of the
social system that produced it. The British ruling class are
fighting against Hitler, whom they have always regarded and whom
some of them still regard as their protector against Bolshevism.
That does not mean that they will deliberately sell out; but it
does mean that at every decisive moment they are likely to falter,
pull their punches, do the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Until the Churchill Government called some sort of halt to the
process, they have done the wrong thing with an unerring instinct
ever since 1931. They helped Franco to overthrow the Spanish
Government, although anyone not an imbecile could have told them
that a Fascist Spain would be hostile to England. They fed Italy
with war materials all through the winter of 1939-40, although it
was obvious to the whole world that the Italians were going to
attack us in the spring. For the sake of a few hundred thousand
dividend drawers they are turning India from an ally into an enemy.
Moreover, so long as the moneyed classes remain in control, we
cannot develop any but a <i>defensive</i> strategy. Every victory
means a change in the <i>status quo</i>. How can we drive the
Italians out of Abyssinia without rousing echoes among the coloured
peoples of our own Empire? How can we even smash Hitler without the
risk of bringing the German Socialists and Communists into power?
The left-wingers who wail that "this is a capitalist war" and that
"British Imperialism" is fighting for loot have got their heads
screwed on backwards. The last thing the British moneyed class wish
for is to acquire fresh territory. It would simply be an
embarrassment. Their war aim (both unattainable and unmentionable)
is simply to hang on to what they have got.</p>

<p>Internally, England is still the rich man's Paradise. All talk
of "equality of sacrifice" is nonsense. At the same time as factory
workers are asked to put up with longer hours, advertisements for
"Butler. One in family, eight in staff" are appearing in the press.
The bombed-out populations of the East End go hungry and homeless
while wealthier victims simply step into their cars and flee to
comfortable country houses. The Home Guard swells to a million men
in a few weeks, and is deliberately organised from above in such a
way that only people with private incomes can hold positions of
command. Even the rationing system is so arranged that it hits the
poor all the time, while people with over &pound;2,000 a year are
practically unaffected by it. Everywhere privilege is squandering
good will. In such circumstances even propaganda becomes almost
impossible. As attempts to stir up patriotic feeling, the red
posters issued by the Chamberlain Government at the beginning of
the war broke all depth-records. Yet they could not have been much
other than they were, for how could Chamberlain and his followers
take the risk of rousing strong popular feeling <i>against
fascism</i>? Anyone who was genuinely hostile to Fascism must also
be opposed to Chamberlain himself and to all the others who had
helped Hitler into power. So also with external propaganda. In all
Lord Halifax's speeches there is not one concrete proposal for
which a single inhabitant of Europe would risk the top joint of his
little finger. For what war-aim can Halifax, or anyone like him,
conceivably have, except to put the clock back to 1933?</p>

<p>It is only by revolution that the native genius of the English
people can be set free. Revolution does not mean red flags and
street fighting, it means a fundamental shift of power. Whether it
happens with or without bloodshed is largely an accident of time
and place. Nor does it mean the dictatorship of a single class. The
people in England who grasp what changes are needed and are capable
of carrying them through are not confined to any one class, though
it is true that very few people with over &pound;2,000 a year are
among them. What is wanted is a conscious open revolt by ordinary
people against inefficiency, class privilege and the rule of the
old. It is not primarily a question of change of government.
British governments do, broadly speaking, represent the will of the
people, and if we alter our structure from below we shall get the
government we need. Ambassadors, generals, officials and colonial
administrators who are senile or pro-Fascist are more dangerous
than Cabinet ministers whose follies have to be committed in
public. Right through our national life we have got to fight
against privilege, against the notion that a half-witted
public-schoolboy is better fitted for command than an intelligent
mechanic. Although there are gifted and honest <i>individuals</i>
among them, we have got to break the grip of the moneyed class as a
whole. England has got to assume its real shape. The England that
is only just beneath the surface, in the factories and the
newspaper offices, in the aeroplanes and the submarines, has got to
take charge of its own destiny.</p>

<p>In the short run, equality of sacrifice, "war-Communism", is
even more important than radical economic changes. It is very
necessary that industry should be nationalised, but it is more
urgently necessary that such monstrosities as butlers and "private
incomes" should disappear forthwith. Almost certainly the main
reason why the Spanish Republic could keep up the fight for two and
a half years against impossible odds was that there were no gross
contrasts of wealth. The people suffered horribly, but they all
suffered alike. When the private soldier had not a cigarette, the
general had not one either. Given equality of sacrifice, the morale
of a country like England would probably be unbreakable. But at
present we have nothing to appeal to except traditional patriotism,
which is deeper here than elsewhere, but is not necessarily
bottomless. At some point or another you have got to deal with the
man who says "I should be no worse off under Hitler". But what
answer can you give him&mdash;that is, what answer that you can
expect him to listen to&mdash;while common soldiers risk their
lives for two and sixpence a day, and fat women ride about in
Rolls-Royce cars, nursing pekineses?</p>

<p>It is quite likely that this war will last three years. It will
mean cruel overwork, cold dull winters, uninteresting food, lack of
amusements, prolonged bombing. It cannot but lower the general
standard of living, because the essential act of war is to
manufacture armaments instead of consumable goods. The working
class will have to suffer terrible things. And they <i>will</i>
suffer them, almost indefinitely, provided that they know what they
are fighting for. They are not cowards, and they are not even
internationally minded. They can stand all that the Spanish workers
stood, and more. But they will want some kind of proof that a
better life is ahead for themselves and their children. The one
sure earnest of that is that when they are taxed and overworked
they shall see that the rich are being hit even harder. And if the
rich squeal audibly, so much the better.</p>

<p>We can bring these things about, if we really want to. It is not
true that public opinion has no power in England. It never makes
itself heard without achieving something; it has been responsible
for most of the changes for the better during the past six months.
But we have moved with glacier-like slowness, and we have learned
only from disasters. It took the fall of Paris to get rid of
Chamberlain and the unnecessary suffering of scores of thousands of
people in the East End to get rid or partially rid of Sir John
Anderson. It is not worth losing a battle in order to bury a
corpse. For we are fighting against swift evil intelligences, and
time presses, and:</p>

<p>history to the defeated May say Alas! but cannot alter or
pardon.</p>

<p><b>iii.</b>
</p>

<p>During the last six months there has been much talk of "the
Fifth Column". From time to time obscure lunatics have been jailed
for making speeches in favour of Hitler, and large numbers of
German refugees have been interned, a thing which has almost
certainly done us great harm in Europe. It is of course obvious
that the idea of a large, organised army of Fifth Columnists
suddenly appearing on the streets with weapons in their hands, as
in Holland and Belgium, is ridiculous. Nevertheless a Fifth Column
danger does exist. One can only consider it if one also considers
in what way England might be defeated.</p>

<p>It does not seem probable that air bombing can settle a major
war. England might well be invaded and conquered, but the invasion
would be a dangerous gamble, and if it happened and failed it would
probably leave us more united and less Blimp-ridden than before.
Moreover, if England were overrun by foreign troops the English
people would know that they had been beaten and would continue the
struggle. It is doubtful whether they could be held down
permanently, or whether Hitler wishes to keep an army of a million
men stationed in these islands. A government of
&mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; (you can fill in
the names) would suit him better. The English can probably not be
bullied into surrender, but they might quite easily be bored,
cajoled or cheated into it, provided that, as at Munich, they did
not know that they were surrendering. It could happen most easily
when the war seemed to be going well rather than badly. The
threatening tone of so much of the German and Italian propaganda is
a psychological mistake. It only gets home on intellectuals. With
the general public the proper approach would be "Let's call it a
draw". It is when a peace-offer along <i>those</i> lines is made
that the pro-Fascists will raise their voices.</p>

<p>But who are the pro-Fascists? The idea of a Hitler victory
appeals to the very rich, to the Communists, to Mosley's followers,
to the pacifists, and to certain sections among the Catholics.
Also, if things went badly enough on the Home Front, the whole of
the poorer section of the working class might swing round to a
position that was defeatist though not actively pro-Hitler.</p>

<p>In this motley list one can see the daring of German propaganda,
its willingness to offer everything to everybody. But the various
pro-Fascist forces are not consciously acting together, and they
operate in different ways.</p>

<p>The Communists must certainly be regarded as pro-Hitler, and are
bound to remain so unless Russian policy changes, but they have not
very much influence. Mosley's Blackshirts, though now lying very
low, are a more serious danger, because of the footing they
probably possess in the armed forces. Still, even in its palmiest
days Mosley's following can hardly have numbered 50,000. Pacifism
is a psychological curiosity rather than a political movement. Some
of the extremer pacifists, starting out with a complete
renunciation of violence, have ended by warmly championing Hitler
and even toying with Antisemitism. This is interesting, but it is
not important. "Pure" pacifism, which is a by-product of naval
power, can only appeal to people in very sheltered positions.
Moreover, being negative and irresponsible, it does not inspire
much devotion. Of the membership of the Peace Pledge Union, less
than 15 per cent even pay their annual subscriptions. None of these
bodies of people, pacifists, Communists or Blackshirts, could bring
a large scale stop-the-war movement into being by their own
efforts. But they might help to make things very much easier for a
treacherous government negotiating surrender. Like the French
Communists, they might become the half-conscious agents of
millionaires.</p>

<p>The real danger is from above. One ought not to pay any
attention to Hitler's recent line of talk about being the friend of
the poor man, the enemy of plutocracy, etc etc. Hitler's real self
is in <i>Mein Kampf</i>, and in his actions. He has never
persecuted the rich, except when they were Jews or when they tried
actively to oppose him. He stands for a centralised economy which
robs the capitalist of most of his power but leaves the structure
of society much as before. The State controls industry, but there
are still rich and poor, masters and men. Therefore, as against
genuine Socialism, the moneyed class have always been on his side.
This was crystal clear at the time of the Spanish civil war, and
clear again at the time when France surrendered. Hitler's puppet
government are not working men, but a gang of bankers, gaga
generals and corrupt right wing politicians.</p>

<p>That kind of spectacular, <i>conscious</i> treachery is less
likely to succeed in England, indeed is far less likely even to be
tried. Nevertheless, to many payers of supertax this war is simply
an insane family squabble which ought to be stopped at all costs.
One need not doubt that a "peace" movement is on foot somewhere in
high places; probably a shadow Cabinet has already been formed.
These people will get their chance not in the moment of defeat but
in some stagnant period when boredom is reinforced by discontent.
They will not talk about surrender, only about peace; and doubtless
they will persuade themselves, and perhaps other people, that they
are acting for the best. An army of unemployed led by millionaires
quoting the Sermon on the Mount&mdash;that is our danger. But it
cannot arise when we have once introduced a reasonable degree of
social justice. The lady in the Rolls-Royce car is more damaging to
morale than a fleet of Goering's bombing planes.</p>

<p>PART III: THE ENGLISH REVOLUTION</p>

<p><b>i.</b>
</p>

<p>The English revolution started several years ago, and it began
to gather momentum when the troops came back from Dunkirk. Like all
else in England, it happens in a sleepy, unwilling way, but it is
happening. The war has speeded it up, but it has also increased,
and desperately, the necessity for speed.</p>

<p>Progress and reaction are ceasing to have anything to do with
party labels. If one wishes to name a particular moment, one can
say that the old distinction between Right and Left broke down when
<i>Picture Post</i> was first published. What are the politics of
<i>Picture Post</i>? Or of <i>Cavalcade</i>, or Priestley's
broadcasts, or the leading articles in the <i>Evening Standard</i>?
None of the old classifications will fit them. They merely point to
the existence of multitudes of unlabelled people who have grasped
within the last year or two that something is wrong. But since a
classless, ownerless society is generally spoken of as "Socialism",
we can give that name to the society towards which we are now
moving. The war and the revolution are inseparable. We cannot
establish anything that a western nation would regard as Socialism
without defeating Hitler; on the other hand we cannot defeat Hitler
while we remain economically and socially in the nineteenth
century. The past is fighting the future and we have two years, a
year, possibly only a few months, to see to it that the future
wins.</p>

<p>We cannot look to this or to any similar government to put
through the necessary changes of its own accord. The initiative
will have to come from below. That means that there will have to
arise something that has never existed in England, a Socialist
movement that actually has the mass of the people behind it. But
one must start by recognising why it is that English Socialism has
failed.</p>

<p>In England there is only one Socialist party that has ever
seriously mattered, the Labour Party. It has never been able to
achieve any major change, because except in purely domestic matters
it has never possessed a genuinely independent policy. It was and
is primarily a party of the trade unions, devoted to raising wages
and improving working conditions. This meant that all through the
critical years it was directly interested in the prosperity of
British capitalism. In particular it was interested in the
maintenance of the British Empire, for the wealth of England was
drawn largely from Asia and Africa. The standard of living of the
trade union workers, whom the Labour Party represented, depended
indirectly on the sweating of Indian coolies. At the same time the
Labour Party was a Socialist party, using Socialist phraseology,
thinking in terms of an old-fashioned anti-imperialism and more or
less pledged to make restitution to the coloured races. It had to
stand for the "independence" of India, just as it had to stand for
disarmament and "progress" generally. Nevertheless everyone was
aware that this was nonsense. In the age of the tank and the
bombing plane, backward agricultural countries like India and the
African colonies can no more be independent than can a cat or a
dog. Had any Labour government come into office with a clear
majority and then proceeded to grant India anything that could
truly be called independence, India would simply have been absorbed
by Japan, or divided between Japan and Russia.</p>

<p>To a Labour government in power, three imperial policies would
have been open. One was to continue administering the Empire
exactly as before, which meant dropping all pretensions to
Socialism. Another was to set the subject peoples "free", which
meant in practice handing them over to Japan, Italy and other
predatory powers, and incidentally causing a catastrophic drop in
the British standard of living. The third was to develop a
<i>positive</i> imperial policy, and aim at transforming the Empire
into a federation of Socialist states, like a looser and freer
version of the Union of Soviet Republics. But the Labour Party's
history and background made this impossible. It was a party of the
trade unions, hopelessly parochial in outlook, with little interest
in imperial affairs and no contacts among the men who actually held
the Empire together. It would have had to hand the administration
of India and Africa and the whole job of imperial defence to men
drawn from a different class and traditionally hostile to
Socialism. Overshadowing everything was the doubt whether a Labour
government which meant business could make itself obeyed. For all
the size of its following, the Labour Party had no footing in the
navy, little or none in the army or air force, none whatever in the
Colonial Services, and not even a sure footing in the Home Civil
Service. In England its position was strong but not
unchallengeable, and outside England all the key points were in the
hands of its enemies. Once in power, the same dilemma would always
have faced it: carry out your promises, and risk revolt, or
continue with the same policy as the Conservatives, and stop
talking about Socialism. The Labour leaders never found a solution,
and from 1935 onwards it was very doubtful whether they had any
wish to take office. They had degenerated into a Permanent
Opposition.</p>

<p>Outside the Labour Party there existed several extremist
parties, of whom the Communists were the strongest. The Communists
had considerable influence in the Labour Party in the years 1920-6
and 1935-9. Their chief importance, and that of the whole left wing
of the Labour movement, was the part they played in alienating the
middle classes from Socialism.</p>

<p>The history of the past seven years has made it perfectly clear
that Communism has no chance in western Europe. The appeal of
Fascism is enormously greater. In one country after another the
Communists have been rooted out by their more up-to-date enemies,
the Nazis. In the English-speaking countries they never had a
serious footing. The creed they were spreading could appeal only to
a rather rare type of person, found chiefly in the middle-class
intelligentsia, the type who has ceased to love his own country but
still feels the need of patriotism, and therefore develops
patriotic sentiments towards Russia. By 1940, after working for
twenty years and spending a great deal of money, the British
Communists had barely 20,000 members, actually a smaller number
than they had started out with in 1920. The other Marxist parties
were of even less importance. They had not the Russian money and
prestige behind them, and even more than the Communists they were
tied to the nineteenth-century doctrine of the class war. They
continued year after year to preach this out-of-date gospel, and
never drew any inference from the fact that it got them no
followers.</p>

<p>Nor did any strong native Fascist movement grow up. Material
conditions were not bad enough, and no leader who could be taken
seriously was forthcoming. One would have had to look a long time
to find a man more barren of ideas than Sir Oswald Mosley. He was
as hollow as a jug. Even the elementary fact that Fascism must not
offend national sentiment had escaped him. His entire movement was
imitated slavishly from abroad, the uniform and the party programme
from Italy and the salute from Germany, with the Jew baiting tacked
on as an afterthought, Mosley having actually started his movement
with Jews among his most prominent followers. A man of the stamp of
Bottomley or Lloyd George could perhaps have brought a real British
Fascist movement into existence. But such leaders only appear when
the psychological need for them exists.</p>

<p>After twenty years of stagnation and unemployment, the entire
English Socialist movement was unable to produce a version of
Socialism which the mass of the people could even find desirable.
The Labour Party stood for a timid reformism, the Marxists were
looking at the modern world through nineteenth-century spectacles.
Both ignored agriculture and imperial problems, and both
antagonised the middle classes. The suffocating stupidity of
left-wing propaganda had frightened away whole classes of necessary
people, factory managers, airmen, naval officers, farmers,
white-collar workers, shopkeepers, policemen. All of these people
had been taught to think of Socialism as something which menaced
their livelihood, or as something seditious, alien, "anti-British"
as they would have called it. Only the intellectuals, the least
useful section of the middle class, gravitated towards the
movement.</p>

<p>A Socialist Party which genuinely wished to achieve anything
would have started by facing several facts which to this day are
considered unmentionable in left-wing circles. It would have
recognised that England is more united than most countries, that
the British workers have a great deal to lose besides their chains,
and that the differences in outlook and habits between class and
class are rapidly diminishing. In general, it would have recognised
that the old-fashioned "proletarian revolution" is an
impossibility. But all through the between-war years no Socialist
programme that was both revolutionary and workable ever appeared;
basically, no doubt, because no one genuinely wanted any major
change to happen. The Labour leaders wanted to go on and on,
drawing their salaries and periodically swapping jobs with the
Conservatives. The Communists wanted to go on and on, suffering a
comfortable martyrdom, meeting with endless defeats and afterwards
putting the blame on other people. The left-wing intelligentsia
wanted to go on and on, sniggering at the Blimps, sapping away at
middle-class morale, but still keeping their favoured position as
hangers-on of the dividend-drawers. Labour Party politics had
become a variant of Conservatism, "revolutionary" politics had
become a game of make-believe.</p>

<p>Now, however, the circumstances have changed, the drowsy years
have ended. Being a Socialist no longer means kicking theoretically
against a system which in practice you are fairly well satisfied
with. This time our predicament is real. It is "the Philistines be
upon thee, Samson". We have got to make our words take physical
shape, or perish. We know very well that with its present social
structure England cannot survive, and we have got to make other
people see that fact and act upon it. We cannot win the war without
introducing Socialism, nor establish Socialism without winning the
war. At such a time it is possible, as it was not in the peaceful
years, to be both revolutionary and realistic. A Socialist movement
which can swing the mass of the people behind it, drive the
pro-Fascists out of positions of control, wipe out the grosser
injustices and let the working class see that they have something
to fight for, win over the middle classes instead of antagonising
them, produce a workable imperial policy instead of a mixture of
humbug and Utopianism, bring patriotism and intelligence into
partnership&mdash;for the first time, a movement of such a kind
becomes possible.</p>

<p><b>ii.</b>
</p>

<p>The fact that we are at war has turned Socialism from a textbook
word into a realisable policy.</p>

<p>The inefficiency of private capitalism has been proved all over
Europe. Its injustice has been proved in the East End of London.
Patriotism, against which the Socialists fought so long, has become
a tremendous lever in their hands. People who at any other time
would cling like glue to their miserable scraps of privilege, will
surrender them fast enough when their country is in danger. War is
the greatest of all agents of change. It speeds up all processes,
wipes out minor distinctions, brings realities to the surface.
Above all, war brings it home to the individual that he is not
altogether an individual. It is only because they are aware of this
that men will die on the field of battle. At this moment it is not
so much a question of surrendering life as of surrendering leisure,
comfort, economic liberty, social prestige. There are very few
people in England who really want to see their country conquered by
Germany. If it can be made clear that defeating Hitler means wiping
out class privilege, the great mass of middling people, the
&pound;6 a week to &pound;2,000 a year class, will probably be on
our side. These people are quite indispensable, because they
include most of the technical experts. Obviously the snobbishness
and political ignorance of people like airmen and naval officers
will be a very great difficulty. But without those airmen,
destroyer commanders, etc etc we could not survive for a week. The
only approach to them is through their patriotism. An intelligent
Socialist movement will use their patriotism, instead of merely
insulting it, as hitherto.</p>

<p>But do I mean that there will be no opposition? Of course not.
It would be childish to expect anything of the kind.</p>

<p>There will be a bitter political struggle, and there will be
unconscious and half-conscious sabotage everywhere. At some point
or other it may be necessary to use violence. It is easy to imagine
a pro-Fascist rebellion breaking out in, for instance, India. We
shall have to fight against bribery, ignorance and snobbery. The
bankers and the larger businessmen, the landowners and
dividend-drawers, the officials with their prehensile bottoms, will
obstruct for all they are worth. Even the middle classes will
writhe when their accustomed way of life is menaced. But just
because the English sense of national unity has never
disintegrated, because patriotism is finally stronger than
class-hatred, the chances are that the will of the majority will
prevail. It is no use imagining that one can make fundamental
changes without causing a split in the nation; but the treacherous
minority will be far smaller in time of war than it would be at any
other time.</p>

<p>The swing of opinion is visibly happening, but it cannot be
counted on to happen fast enough of its own accord. This war is a
race between the consolidation of Hitler's empire and the growth of
democratic consciousness. Everywhere in England you can see a
ding-dong battle ranging to and fro&mdash;in Parliament and in the
Government, in the factories and the armed forces, in the pubs and
the air-raid shelters, in the newspapers and on the radio. Every
day there are tiny defeats, tiny victories. Morrison for Home
Security&mdash;a few yards forward. Priestley shoved off the
air&mdash;a few yards back. It is a struggle between the groping
and the unteachable, between the young and the old, between the
living and the dead. But it is very necessary that the discontent
which undoubtedly exists should take a purposeful and not merely
obstructive form. It is time for <i>the people</i> to define their
war-aims. What is wanted is a simple, concrete programme of action,
which can be given all possible publicity, and round which public
opinion can group itself.</p>

<p>I suggest that the following six-point programme is the kind of
thing we need. The first three points deal with England's internal
policy, the other three with the Empire and the world:</p>

<p>1. Nationalisation of land, mines, railways, banks and major
industries.</p>

<p>2. Limitation of incomes, on such a scale that the highest tax
free income in Britain does not exceed the lowest by more than ten
to one.</p>

<p>3. Reform of the educational system along democratic lines.</p>

<p>4. Immediate Dominion status for India, with power to secede
when the war is over.</p>

<p>5. Formation of an Imperial General Council, in which the
coloured peoples are to be represented.</p>

<p>6. Declaration of formal alliance with China, Abyssinia and all
other victims of the Fascist powers.</p>

<p>The general tendency of this programme is unmistakable. It aims
quite frankly at turning this war into a revolutionary war and
England into a Socialist democracy. I have deliberately included in
it nothing that the simplest person could not understand and see
the reason for. In the form in which I have put it, it could be
printed on the front page of the <i>Daily Mirror</i>. But for the
purposes of this book a certain amount of amplification is
needed.</p>

<p>1. NATIONALISATION. One can "nationalise" industry by the stroke
of a pen, but the actual process is slow and complicated. What is
needed is that the ownership of all major industry shall be
formally vested in the State, representing the common people. Once
that is done it becomes possible to eliminate the class of mere
<i>owners</i> who live not by virtue of anything they produce but
by the possession of title-deeds and share certificates.
State-ownership implies, therefore, that nobody shall live without
working. How sudden a change in the conduct of industry it implies
is less certain. In a country like England we cannot rip down the
whole structure and build again from the bottom, least of all in
time of war. Inevitably the majority of industrial concerns will
continue with much the same personnel as before, the one-time
owners or managing directors carrying on with their jobs as State
employees. There is reason to think that many of the smaller
capitalists would actually welcome some such arrangement. The
resistance will come from the big capitalists, the bankers, the
landlords and the idle rich, roughly speaking the class with over
&pound;2,000 a year&mdash;and even if one counts in all their
dependants there are not more than half a million of these people
in England. Nationalisation of agricultural land implies cutting
out the landlord and the tithe drawer, but not necessarily
interfering with the farmer. It is difficult to imagine any
reorganisation of English agriculture that would not retain most of
the existing farms as units, at any rate at the beginning. The
farmer, when he is competent, will continue as a salaried manager.
He is virtually that already, with the added disadvantage of having
to make a profit and being permanently in debt to the bank. With
certain kinds of petty trading, and even the small-scale ownership
of land, the State will probably not interfere at all. It would be
a great mistake to start by victimising the smallholder class, for
instance. These people are necessary, on the whole they are
competent, and the amount of work they do depends on the feeling
that they are "their own masters". But the State will certainly
impose an upward limit to the ownership of land (probably fifteen
acres at the very most), and will never permit any ownership of
land in town areas.</p>

<p>From the moment that all productive goods have been declared the
property of the State, the common people will feel, as they cannot
feel now, that the State is <i>themselves</i>. They will be ready
then to endure the sacrifices that are ahead of us, war or no war.
And even if the face of England hardly seems to change, on the day
that our main industries are formally nationalised the dominance of
a single class will have been broken. From then onwards the
emphasis will be shifted from ownership to management, from
privilege to competence. It is quite possible that State-ownership
will in itself bring about less social change than will be forced
upon us by the common hardships of war. But it is the necessary
first step without which any <i>real</i> reconstruction is
impossible.</p>

<p>2. INCOMES. Limitation of incomes implies the fixing of a
minimum wage, which implies a managed internal currency based
simply on the amount of consumption goods available. And this again
implies a stricter rationing scheme than is now in operation. It is
no use at this stage of the world's history to suggest that all
human beings should have <i>exactly</i> equal incomes. It has been
shown over and over again that without some kind of money reward
there is no incentive to undertake certain jobs. On the other hand
the money reward need not be very large. In practice it is
impossible that earnings should be limited quite as rigidly as I
have suggested. There will always be anomalies and evasions. But
there is no reason why ten to one should not be the maximum normal
variation. And within those limits some sense of equality is
possible. A man with &pound;3 a week and a man with &pound;1,500 a
year can feel themselves fellow creatures, which the Duke of
Westminster and the sleepers on the Embankment benches cannot.</p>

<p>3. EDUCATION. In wartime, educational reform must necessarily be
promise rather than performance. At the moment we are not in a
position to raise the school-leaving age or increase the teaching
staffs of the elementary schools. But there are certain immediate
steps that we could take towards a democratic educational system.
We could start by abolishing the autonomy of the public schools and
the older universities and flooding them with State-aided pupils
chosen simply on grounds of ability. At present, public-school
education is partly a training in class prejudice and partly a sort
of tax that the middle classes pay to the upper class in return for
the right to enter certain professions. It is true that that state
of affairs is altering. The middle classes have begun to rebel
against the expensiveness of education, and the war will bankrupt
the majority of the public schools if it continues for another year
or two. The evacuation is also producing certain minor changes. But
there is a danger that some of the older schools, which will be
able to weather the financial storm longest, will survive in some
form or another as festering centres of snobbery. As for the 10,000
"private" schools that England possesses, the vast majority of them
deserve nothing except suppression. They are simply commercial
undertakings, and in many cases their educational level is actually
lower than that of the elementary schools. They merely exist
because of a widespread idea that there is something disgraceful in
being educated by the public authorities. The State could quell
this idea by declaring itself responsible for all education, even
if at the start this were no more than a gesture. We need gestures
as well as actions. It is all too obvious that our talk of
"defending democracy" is nonsense while it is a mere accident of
birth that decides whether a gifted child shall or shall not get
the education it deserves.</p>

<p>4. INDIA. What we must offer India is not "freedom", which, as I
have said earlier, is impossible, but alliance, partnership-in a
word, equality. But we must also tell the Indians that they are
free to secede, if they want to. Without that there can be no
equality of partnership, and our claim to be defending the coloured
peoples against Fascism will never be believed. But it is a mistake
to imagine that if the Indians were free to cut themselves adrift
they would immediately do so. When a British government
<i>offers</i> them unconditional independence, they will refuse it.
For as soon as they have the power to secede the chief reasons for
doing so will have disappeared.</p>

<p>A complete severance of the two countries would be a disaster
for India no less than for England. Intelligent Indians know this.
As things are at present, India not only cannot defend itself, it
is hardly even capable of feeding itself. The whole administration
of the country depends on a framework of experts (engineers, forest
officers, railwaymen, soldiers, doctors) who are predominantly
English and could not be replaced within five or ten years.
Moreover, English is the chief lingua franca and nearly the whole
of the Indian intelligentsia is deeply Anglicised. Any transference
to foreign rule&mdash;for if the British marched out of India the
Japanese and other powers would immediately march in&mdash;would
mean an immense dislocation. Neither the Japanese, the Russians,
the Germans nor the Italians would be capable of administering
India even at the low level of efficiency that is attained by the
British. They do not possess the necessary supplies of technical
experts or the knowledge of languages and local conditions, and
they probably could not win the confidence of indispensable
go-betweens such as the Eurasians. If India were simply
"liberated", i.e. deprived of British military protection, the
first result would be a fresh foreign conquest, and the second a
series of enormous famines which would kill millions of people
within a few years.</p>

<p>What India needs is the power to work out its own constitution
without British interference, but in some kind of partnership that
ensures its military protection and technical advice. This is
unthinkable until there is a Socialist government in England. For
at least eighty years England has artificially prevented the
development of India, partly from fear of trade competition if
Indian industries were too highly developed, partly because
backward peoples are more easily governed than civilised ones. It
is a commonplace that the average Indian suffers far more from his
own countrymen than from the British. The petty Indian capitalist
exploits the town worker with the utmost ruthlessness, the peasant
lives from birth to death in the grip of the money-lender. But all
this is an indirect result of the British rule, which aims
half-consciously at keeping India as backward as possible. The
classes most loyal to Britain are the princes, the landowners and
the business community&mdash;in general, the reactionary classes
who are doing fairly well out of the <i>status quo.</i>. The moment
that England ceased to stand towards India in the relation of an
exploiter, the balance of forces would be altered. No need then for
the British to flatter the ridiculous Indian princes, with their
gilded elephants and cardboard armies, to prevent the growth of the
Indian trade unions, to play off Moslem against Hindu, to protect
the worthless life of the money-lender, to receive the salaams of
toadying minor officials, to prefer the half-barbarous Gurkha to
the educated Bengali. Once check that stream of dividends that
flows from the bodies of Indian coolies to the banking accounts of
old ladies in Cheltenham, and the whole sahib-native nexus, with
its haughty ignorance on one side and envy and servility on the
other, can come to an end. Englishmen and Indians can work side by
side for the development of India, and for the training of Indians
in all the arts which, so far, they have been systematically
prevented from learning. How many of the existing British personnel
in India, commercial or official, would fall in with such an
arrangement&mdash;which would mean ceasing once and for all to be
"sahibs"&mdash;is a different question. But, broadly speaking, more
is to be hoped from the younger men and from those officials (civil
engineers, forestry and agricultural experts, doctors,
educationists) who have been scientifically educated. The higher
officials, the provincial governors, commissioners, judges, etc are
hopeless; but they are also the most easily replaceable.</p>

<p>That, roughly, is what would be meant by Dominion status if it
were offered to India by a Socialist government. It is an offer of
partnership on equal terms until such time as the world has ceased
to be ruled by bombing planes. But we must add to it the
unconditional right to secede. It is the only way of proving that
we mean what we say. And what applies to India applies, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, to Burma, Malaya and most of our African
possessions.</p>

<p>5 and 6 explain themselves. They are the necessary preliminary
to any claim that we are fighting this war for the protection of
peaceful peoples against Fascist aggression.</p>

<p>Is it impossibly hopeful to think that such a policy as this
could get a following in England? A year ago, even six months ago,
it would have been, but not now. Moreover-and this is the peculiar
opportunity of this moment&mdash;it could be given the necessary
publicity. There is now a considerable weekly press, with a
circulation of millions, which would be ready to
popularise&mdash;if not <i>exactly</i> the programme I have
sketched above, at any rate <i>some</i> policy along those lines.
There are even three or four daily papers which would be prepared
to give it a sympathetic hearing. That is the distance we have
travelled in the last six months.</p>

<p>But is such a policy realisable? That depends entirely on
ourselves.</p>

<p>Some of the points I have suggested are of the kind that could
be carried out immediately, others would take years or decades and
even then would not be perfectly achieved. No political programme
is ever carried out in its entirety. But what matters is that that
or something like it should be our declared policy. It is always
the <i>direction</i> that counts. It is of course quite hopeless to
expect the present Government to pledge itself to any policy that
implies turning this war into a revolutionary war. It is at best a
government of compromise, with Churchill riding two horses like a
circus acrobat. Before such measures as limitation of incomes
become even thinkable, there will have to be a complete shift of
power away from the old ruling class. If during this winter the war
settles into another stagnant period, we ought in my opinion to
agitate for a General Election, a thing which the Tory Party
machine will make frantic efforts to prevent. But even without an
election we can get the government we want, provided that we want
it urgently enough. A real shove from below will accomplish it. As
to who will be in that government when it comes, I make no guess. I
only know that the right men will be there when the people really
want them, for it is movements that make leaders and not leaders
movements.</p>

<p>Within a year, perhaps even within six months, if we are still
unconquered, we shall see the rise of something that has never
existed before, a specifically <i>English</i> Socialist movement.
Hitherto there has been only the Labour Party, which was the
creation of the working class but did not aim at any fundamental
change, and Marxism, which was a German theory interpreted by
Russians and unsuccessfully transplanted to England. There was
nothing that really touched the heart of the English people.
Throughout its entire history the English Socialist movement has
never produced a song with a catchy tune&mdash;nothing like <i>La
Marseillaise</i> or <i>La Cucuracha</i>, for instance. When a
Socialist movement native to England appears, the Marxists, like
all others with a vested interest in the past, will be its bitter
enemies. Inevitably they will denounce it as "Fascism". Already it
is customary among the more soft-boiled intellectuals of the Left
to declare that if we fight against the Nazis we shall "go Nazi"
ourselves. They might almost equally well say that if we fight
against Negroes we shall turn black. To "go Nazi" we should have to
have the history of Germany behind us. Nations do not escape from
their past merely by making a revolution. An English Socialist
government will transform the nation from top to bottom, but it
will still bear all over it the unmistakable marks of our own
civilisation, the peculiar civilisation which I discussed earlier
in this book.</p>

<p>It will not be doctrinaire, nor even logical. It will abolish
the House of Lords, but quite probably will not abolish the
Monarchy. It will leave anachronisms and loose ends everywhere, the
judge in his ridiculous horsehair wig and the lion and the unicorn
on the soldier's cap-buttons. It will not set up any explicit class
dictatorship. It will group itself round the old Labour Party and
its mass following will be in the trade unions, but it will draw
into it most of the middle class and many of the younger sons of
the bourgeoisie. Most of its directing brains will come from the
new indeterminate class of skilled workers, technical experts,
airmen, scientists, architects and journalists, the people who feel
at home in the radio and ferro-concrete age. But it will never lose
touch with the tradition of compromise and the belief in a law that
is above the State. It will shoot traitors, but it will give them a
solemn trial beforehand and occasionally it will acquit them. It
will crush any open revolt promptly and cruelly, but it will
interfere very little with the spoken and written word. Political
parties with different names will still exist, revolutionary sects
will still be publishing their newspapers and making as little
impression as ever. It will disestablish the Church, but will not
persecute religion. It will retain a vague reverence for the
Christian moral code, and from time to time will refer to England
as "a Christian country". The Catholic Church will war against it,
but the Nonconformist sects and the bulk of the Anglican Church
will be able to come to terms with it. It will show a power of
assimilating the past which will shock foreign observers and
sometimes make them doubt whether any revolution has happened.</p>

<p>But all the same it will have done the essential thing. It will
have nationalised industry, scaled down incomes, set up a classless
educational system. Its real nature will be apparent from the
hatred which the surviving rich men of the world will feel for it.
It will aim not at disintegrating the Empire but at turning it into
a federation of Socialist states, freed not so much from the
British flag as from the money-lender, the dividend-drawer and the
woodenheaded British official. Its war strategy will be totally
different from that of any property-ruled state, because it will
not be afraid of the revolutionary after-effects when any existing
régime is brought down. It will not have the smallest scruple about
attacking hostile neutrals or stirring up native rebellion in enemy
colonies. It will fight in such a way that even if it is beaten its
memory will be dangerous to the victor, as the memory of the French
Revolution was dangerous to Metternich's Europe. The dictators will
fear it as they could not fear the existing British régime, even if
its military strength were ten times what it is.</p>

<p>But at this moment, when the drowsy life of England has barely
altered, and the offensive contrast of wealth and poverty still
exists everywhere, even amid the bombs, why do I dare to say that
all these things "will" happen?</p>

<p>Because the time has come when one can predict the future in
terms of an "either&mdash;or". Either we turn this war into a
revolutionary war (I do not say that our policy will be
<i>exactly</i> what I have indicated above&mdash;merely that it
will be along those general lines) or we lose it, and much more
besides. Quite soon it will be possible to say definitely that our
feet are set upon one path or the other. But at any rate it is
certain that with our present social structure we cannot win. Our
real forces, physical, moral or intellectual, cannot be
mobilised.</p>

<p><b>iii.</b>
</p>

<p>Patriotism has nothing to do with Conservatism. It is actually
the opposite of Conservatism, since it is a devotion to something
that is always changing and yet is felt to be mystically the same.
It is the bridge between the future and the past. No real
revolutionary has ever been an internationalist.</p>

<p>During the past twenty years the negative, <i>fainéant</i>
outlook which has been fashionable among English left-wingers, the
sniggering of the intellectuals at patriotism and physical courage,
the persistent effort to chip away English morale and spread a
hedonistic, what-do-I-get-out-of-it attitude to life, has done
nothing but harm. It would have been harmful even if we had been
living in the squashy League of Nations universe that these people
imagined. In an age of Fuehrers and bombing planes it was a
disaster. However little we may like it, toughness is the price of
survival. A nation trained to think hedonistically cannot survive
amid peoples who work like slaves and breed like rabbits, and whose
chief national industry is war. English Socialists of nearly all
colours have wanted to make a stand against Fascism, but at the
same time they have aimed at making their own countrymen unwarlike.
They have failed, because in England traditional loyalties are
stronger than new ones. But in spite of all the "anti-Fascist"
heroics of the left-wing press, what chance should we have stood
when the real struggle with Fascism came, if the average Englishman
had been the kind of creature that the <i>New Statesman</i>, the
<i>Daily Worker</i> or even the <i>News Chronicle</i> wished to
make him?</p>

<p>Up to 1935 virtually all English left-wingers were vaguely
pacifist. After 1935 the more vocal of them flung themselves
eagerly into the Popular Front movement, which was simply an
evasion of the whole problem posed by Fascism. It set out to be
"anti-Fascist" in a purely negative way&mdash;"against" Fascism
without being "for" any discoverable policy-and underneath it lay
the flabby idea that when the time came the Russians would do our
fighting for us. It is astonishing how this illusion fails to die.
Every week sees its spate of letters to the press, pointing out
that if we had a government with no Tories in it the Russians could
hardly avoid coming round to our side. Or we are to publish
high-sounding war-aims (<i>vide</i> books like <i>Unser Kampf</i>,
<i>A Hundred Million Allies</i>, <i>If We Choose</i>, etc),
whereupon the European populations will infallibly rise on our
behalf. It is the same idea all the time-look abroad for your
inspiration, get someone else to do your fighting for you.
Underneath it lies the frightful inferiority complex of the English
intellectual, the belief that the English are no longer a martial
race, no longer capable of enduring.</p>

<p>In truth there is no reason to think that anyone will do our
fighting for us yet awhile, except the Chinese, who have been doing
it for three years already. [Note: Written before the outbreak of
the war in Greece. (Author's footnote.)] The Russians may be driven
to fight on our side by the fact of a direct attack, but they have
made it clear enough that they will not stand up to the German army
if there is any way of avoiding it. In any case they are not likely
to be attracted by the spectacle of a left-wing government in
England. The present Russian régime must almost certainly be
hostile to any revolution in the West. The subject peoples of
Europe will rebel when Hitler begins to totter, but not earlier.
Our potential allies are not the Europeans but on the one hand the
Americans, who will need a year to mobilise their resources even if
Big Business can be brought to heel, and on the other hand the
coloured peoples, who cannot be even sentimentally on our side till
our own revolution has started. For a long time, a year, two years,
possibly three years, England has got to be the shock-absorber of
the world. We have got to face bombing, hunger, overwork,
influenza, boredom and treacherous peace offers. Manifestly it is a
time to stiffen morale, not to weaken it. Instead of taking the
mechanically anti-British attitude which is usual on the Left, it
is better to consider what the world would really be like if the
English-speaking culture perished. For it is childish to suppose
that the other English-speaking countries, even the USA, will be
unaffected if Britain is conquered.</p>

<p>Lord Halifax, and all his tribe, believe that when the war is
over things will be exactly as they were before. Back to the crazy
pavement of Versailles, back to "democracy", i.e. capitalism, back
to dole queues and the Rolls-Royce cars, back to the grey top hats
and the sponge-bag trousers, <i>in saecula saeculorum</i>. It is of
course obvious that nothing of the kind is going to happen. A
feeble imitation of it might just possibly happen in the case of a
negotiated peace, but only for a short while. <i>laissez-faire</i>
capitalism is dead. [Note, below] The choice lies between the kind
of collective society that Hitler will set up and the kind that can
arise if he is defeated.</p>

<p>[Note: It is interesting to notice that Mr Kennedy, USA
Ambassador in London, remarked on his return to New York in October
1940 that as a result of the war "democracy is finished". By
"democracy", of course, he meant private capitalism. (Author's
footnote.)]</p>

<p>If Hitler wins this war he will consolidate his rule over
Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and if his armies have not been
too greatly exhausted beforehand, he will wrench vast territories
from Soviet Russia. He will set up a graded caste-society in which
the German <i>Herrenvolk</i> ("master race" or "aristocratic race")
will rule over Slavs and other lesser peoples whose job it will be
to produce low-priced agricultural products. He will reduce the
coloured peoples once and for all to outright slavery. The real
quarrel of the Fascist powers with British imperialism is that they
know that it is disintegrating. Another twenty years along the
present line of development, and India will be a peasant republic
linked with England only by voluntary alliance. The "semi-apes" of
whom Hitler speaks with such loathing will be flying aeroplanes and
manufacturing machine-guns. The Fascist dream of a slave empire
will be at an end. On the other hand, if we are defeated we simply
hand over our own victims to new masters who come fresh to the job
and have not developed any scruples.</p>

<p>But more is involved than the fate of the coloured peoples. Two
incompatible visions of life are fighting one another. "Between
democracy and totalitarianism," says Mussolini, "there can be no
compromise." The two creeds cannot even, for any length of time,
live side by side. So long as democracy exists, even in its very
imperfect English form, totalitarianism is in deadly danger. The
whole English-speaking world is haunted by the idea of human
equality, and though it would be simply a lie to say that either we
or the Americans have ever acted up to our professions, still, the
<i>idea</i> is there, and it is capable of one day becoming a
reality. From the English-speaking culture, if it does not perish,
a society of free and equal human beings will ultimately arise. But
it is precisely the idea of human equality&mdash;the "Jewish" or
"Judaeo-Christian" idea of equality&mdash;that Hitler came into the
world to destroy. He has, heaven knows, said so often enough. The
thought of a world in which black men would be as good as white men
and Jews treated as human beings brings him the same horror and
despair as the thought of endless slavery brings to us.</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind how irreconcilable these two
viewpoints are. Some time within the next year a pro-Hitler
reaction within the left-wing intelligentsia is likely enough.
There are premonitory signs of it already. Hitler's positive
achievement appeals to the emptiness of these people, and, in the
case of those with pacifist leanings, to their masochism. One knows
in advance more or less what they will say. They will start by
refusing to admit that British capitalism is evolving into
something different, or that the defeat of Hitler can mean any more
than a victory for the British and American millionaires. And from
that they will proceed to argue that, after all, democracy is "just
the same as" or "just as bad as" totalitarianism. There is <i>not
much</i> freedom of speech in England; therefore there is <i>no
more</i> than exists in Germany. To be on the dole is a horrible
experience; therefore it is <i>no worse</i> to be in the
torture-chambers of the Gestapo. In general, two blacks make a
white, half a loaf is the same as no bread.</p>

<p>But in reality, whatever may be true about democracy and
totalitarianism, it is not true that they are the same. It would
not be true, even if British democracy were incapable of evolving
beyond its present stage. The whole conception of the militarised
continental state, with its secret police, its censored literature
and its conscript labour, is utterly different from that of the
loose maritime democracy, with its slums and unemployment, its
strikes and party politics. It is the difference between land power
and sea power, between cruelty and inefficiency, between lying and
self-deception, between the SS man and the rent-collector. And in
choosing between them one chooses not so much on the strength of
what they now are as of what they are capable of becoming. But in a
sense it is irrelevant whether democracy, at its higher or at its
lowest, is "better" than totalitarianism. To decide that one would
have to have access to absolute standards. The only question that
matters is where one's real sympathies will lie when the pinch
comes. The intellectuals who are so fond of balancing democracy
against totalitarianism and "proving" that one is as bad as the
other are simply frivolous people who have never been shoved up
against realities. They show the same shallow misunderstanding of
Fascism now, when they are beginning to flirt with it, as a year or
two ago, when they were squealing against it. The question is not,
"Can you make out a debating-society 'case' in favour of Hitler?"
The question is, "Do you genuinely accept that case? Are you
willing to submit to Hitler's rule? Do you want to see England
conquered, or don't you?" It would be better to be sure on that
point before frivolously siding with the enemy. For there is no
such thing as neutrality in war; in practice one must help one side
or the other.</p>

<p>When the pinch comes, no one bred in the western tradition can
accept the Fascist vision of life. It is important to realise that
now, and to grasp what it entails. With all its sloth, hypocrisy
and injustice, the English speaking civilisation is the only large
obstacle in Hitler's path. It is a living contradiction of all the
"infallible" dogmas of Fascism. That is why all Fascist writers for
years past have agreed that England's power must be destroyed.
England must be "exterminated", must be "annihilated", must "cease
to exist". Strategically it would be possible for this war to end
with Hitler in secure possession of Europe, and with the British
Empire intact and British sea-power barely affected. But
ideologically it is not possible; were Hitler to make an offer
along those lines, it could only be treacherously, with a view to
conquering England indirectly or renewing the attack at some more
favourable moment. England cannot possibly be allowed to remain as
a sort of funnel through which deadly ideas from beyond the
Atlantic flow into the police states of Europe. And turning it
round to our own point of view, we see the vastness of the issue
before us, the all-importance of preserving our democracy more or
less as we have known it. But to <i>preserve</i> is always to
<i>extend</i>. The choice before us is not so much between victory
and defeat as between revolution and apathy. If the thing we are
fighting for is altogether destroyed, it will have been destroyed
partly by our own act.</p>

<p>It could happen that England could introduce the beginnings of
Socialism, turn this war into a revolutionary war, and still be
defeated. That is at any rate thinkable. But, terrible as it would
be for anyone who is now adult, it would be far less deadly than
the "compromise peace" which a few rich men and their hired liars
are hoping for. The final ruin of England could only be
accomplished by an English government acting under orders from
Berlin. But that cannot happen if England has awakened beforehand.
For in that case the defeat would be unmistakable, the struggle
would continue, the <i>idea</i> would survive. The difference
between going down fighting, and surrendering without a fight, is
by no means a question of "honour" and schoolboy heroics. Hitler
said once that to <i>accept</i> defeat destroys the soul of a
nation. This sounds like a piece of claptrap, but it is strictly
true. The defeat of 1870 did not lessen the world-influence of
France. The Third Republic had more influence, intellectually, than
the France of Napoleon III. But the sort of peace that Petain,
Laval and Co have accepted can only be purchased by deliberately
wiping out the national culture. The Vichy Government will enjoy a
spurious independence only on condition that it destroys the
distinctive marks of French culture: republicanism, secularism,
respect for the intellect, absence of colour prejudice. We cannot
be <i>utterly</i> defeated if we have made our revolution
beforehand. We may see German troops marching down Whitehall, but
another process, ultimately deadly to the German power-dream, will
have been started. The Spanish people were defeated, but the things
they learned during those two and a half memorable years will one
day come back upon the Spanish Fascists like a boomerang.</p>

<p>A piece of Shakespearean bombast was much quoted at the
beginning of the war. Even Mr Chamberlain quoted it once, if my
memory does not deceive me:</p>

<pre>
Come the four corners of the world in arms
And we shall shock them: naught shall make us rue
If England to herself do rest but true.
</pre>

<p>It is right enough, if you interpret it rightly. But England has
got to be true to herself. She is not being true to herself while
the refugees who have sought our shores are penned up in
concentration camps, and company directors work out subtle schemes
to dodge their Excess Profits Tax. It is goodbye to the
<i>Tatler</i> and the <i>Bystander</i>, and farewell to the lady in
the Rolls-Royce car. The heirs of Nelson and of Cromwell are not in
the House of Lords. They are in the fields and the streets, in the
factories and the armed forces, in the four-ale bar and the
suburban back garden; and at present they are still kept under by a
generation of ghosts. Compared with the task of bringing the real
England to the surface, even the winning of the war, necessary
though it is, is secondary. By revolution we become more ourselves,
not less. There is no question of stopping short, striking a
compromise, salvaging "democracy", standing still. Nothing ever
stands still. We must add to our heritage or lose it, we must grow
greater or grow less, we must go forward or backward. I believe in
England, and I believe that we shall go forward.</p>

<h2>WELLS, HITLER AND THE WORLD STATE (1941)</h2>

<p>"In March or April, say the wiseacres, there is to be a
stupendous knockout blow at Britain...What Hitler has to do it
with, I cannot imagine. His ebbing and dispersed military resources
are now probably not so very much greater than the Italians' before
they were put to the test in Greece and Africa."</p>

<p>"The German air power has been largely spent. It is behind the
times and its first-rate men are mostly dead or disheartened or
worn out."</p>

<p>"In 1914 the Hohenzollern army was the best in the world. Behind
that screaming little defective in Berlin there is nothing of the
sort...Yet our military 'experts' discuss the waiting phantom. In
their imaginations it is perfect in its equipment and invincible in
discipline. Sometimes it is to strike a decisive 'blow' through
Spain and North Africa and on, or march through the Balkans, march
from the Danube to Ankara, to Persia, to India, or 'crush Russia',
or 'pour' over the Brenner into Italy. The weeks pass and the
phantom does none of these things&mdash;for one excellent reason.
It does not exist to that extent. Most of such inadequate guns and
munitions as it possessed must have been taken away from it and
fooled away in Hitler's silly feints to invade Britain. And its raw
jerry-built discipline is wilting under the creeping realisation
that the Blitzkrieg is spent, and the war is coming home to
roost."</p>

<p>These quotations are not taken from the <i>Cavalry Quarterly</i>
but from a series of newspaper articles by Mr H.G. Wells, written
at the beginning of this year and now reprinted in a book entitled
<i>Guide to the New World</i>. Since they were written, the German
army has overrun the Balkans and reconquered Cyrenaica, it can
march through Turkey or Spain at such time as may suit it, and it
has undertaken the invasion of Russia. How that campaign will turn
out I do not know, but it is worth noticing that the German general
staff, whose opinion is probably worth something, would not have
begun it if they had not felt fairly certain of finishing it within
three months. So much for the idea that the German army is a bogey,
its equipment inadequate, its morale breaking down, etc etc.</p>

<p>What has Wells to set against the "screaming little defective in
Berlin"? The usual rigmarole about a World State, plus the Sankey
Declaration, which is an attempted definition of fundamental human
rights, of anti-totalitarian tendency. Except that he is now
especially concerned with federal world control of air power, it is
the same gospel as he has been preaching almost without
interruption for the past forty years, always with an air of angry
surprise at the human beings who can fail to grasp anything so
obvious.</p>

<p>What is the use of saying that we need federal world control of
the air? The whole question is how we are to get it. What is the
use of pointing out that a World State is desirable? What matters
is that not one of the five great military powers would think of
submitting to such a thing. All sensible men for decades past have
been substantially in agreement with what Mr Wells says; but the
sensible men have no power and, in too many cases, no disposition
to sacrifice themselves. Hitler is a criminal lunatic, and Hitler
has an army of millions of men, aeroplanes in thousands, tanks in
tens of thousands. For his sake a great nation has been willing to
overwork itself for six years and then to fight for two years more,
whereas for the commonsense, essentially hedonistic world-view
which Mr Wells puts forward, hardly a human creature is willing to
shed a pint of blood. Before you can even talk of world
reconstruction, or even of peace, you have got to eliminate Hitler,
which means bringing into being a dynamic not necessarily the same
as that of the Nazis, but probably quite as unacceptable to
"enlightened" and hedonistic people. What has kept England on its
feet during the past year? In part, no doubt, some vague idea about
a better future, but chiefly the atavistic emotion of patriotism,
the ingrained feeling of the English-speaking peoples that they are
superior to foreigners. For the last twenty years the main object
of English left-wing intellectuals has been to break this feeling
down, and if they had succeeded, we might be watching the SS men
patrolling the London streets at this moment. Similarly, why are
the Russians fighting like tigers against the German invasion? In
part, perhaps, for some half-remembered ideal of Utopian Socialism,
but chiefly in defence of Holy Russia (the "sacred soil of the
Fatherland", etc etc), which Stalin has revived in an only slightly
altered form. The energy that actually shapes the world springs
from emotions&mdash;racial pride, leader-worship, religious belief,
love of war&mdash;which liberal intellectuals mechanically write
off as anachronisms, and which they have usually destroyed so
completely in themselves as to have lost all power of action.</p>

<p>The people who say that Hitler is Antichrist, or alternatively,
the Holy Ghost, are nearer an understanding of the truth than the
intellectuals who for ten dreadful years have kept it up that he is
merely a figure out of comic opera, not worth taking seriously. All
that this idea really reflects is the sheltered conditions of
English life. The Left Book Club was at bottom a product of
Scotland Yard, just as the Peace Pledge Union is a product of the
navy. One development of the last ten years has been the appearance
of the "political book", a sort of enlarged pamphlet combining
history with political criticism, as an important literary form.
But the best writers in this line&mdash;Trotsky, Rauschning,
Rosenberg, Silone, Borkenau, Koestler and others&mdash;have none of
them been Englishmen, and nearly all of them have been renegades
from one or other extremist party, who have seen totalitarianism at
close quarters and known the meaning of exile and persecution. Only
in the English-speaking countries was it fashionable to believe,
right up to the outbreak of war, that Hitler was an unimportant
lunatic and the German tanks made of cardboard. Mr Wells, it will
be seen from the quotations I have given above, believes something
of the kind still. I do not suppose that either the bombs or the
German campaign in Greece have altered his opinion. A lifelong
habit of thought stands between him and an understanding of
Hitler's power.</p>

<p>Mr Wells, like Dickens, belongs to the non-military middle
class. The thunder of guns, the jingle of spurs, the catch in the
throat when the old flag goes by, leave him manifestly cold. He has
an invincible hatred of the fighting, hunting, swashbuckling side
of life, symbolised in all his early books by a violent propaganda
against horses. The principal villain of his <i>Outline of
History</i> is the military adventurer, Napoleon. If one looks
through nearly any book that he has written in the last forty years
one finds the same idea constantly recurring: the supposed
antithesis between the man of science who is working towards a
planned World State and the reactionary who is trying to restore a
disorderly past. In novels, Utopias, essays, films, pamphlets, the
antithesis crops up, always more or less the same. On the one side
science, order, progress, internationalism, aeroplanes, steel,
concrete, hygiene: on the other side war, nationalism, religion,
monarchy, peasants, Greek professors, poets, horses. History as he
sees it is a series of victories won by the scientific man over the
romantic man. Now, he is probably right in assuming that a
"reasonable", planned form of society, with scientists rather than
witch-doctors in control, will prevail sooner or later, but that is
a different matter from assuming that it is just round the corner.
There survives somewhere or other an interesting controversy which
took place between Wells and Churchill at the time of the Russian
Revolution. Wells accuses Churchill of not really believing his own
propaganda about the Bolsheviks being monsters dripping with blood
etc, but of merely fearing that they were going to introduce an era
of common sense and scientific control, in which flag-wavers like
Churchill himself would have no place. Churchill's estimate of the
Bolsheviks, however, was nearer the mark than Wells's. The early
Bolsheviks may have been angels or demons, according as one chooses
to regard them, but at any rate they were not sensible men. They
were not introducing a Wellsian Utopia but a Rule of the Saints,
which, like the English Rule of the Saints, was a military
despotism enlivened by witchcraft trials. The same misconception
reappears in an inverted form in Wells's attitude to the Nazis.
Hitler is all the war-lords and witch doctors in history rolled
into one. Therefore, argues Wells, he is an absurdity, a ghost from
the past, a creature doomed to disappear almost immediately. But
unfortunately the equation of science with common sense does not
really hold good. The aeroplane, which was looked forward to as a
civilising influence but in practice has hardly been used except
for dropping bombs, is the symbol of that fact. Modern Germany is
far more scientific than England, and far more barbarous. Much of
what Wells has imagined and worked for is physically there in Nazi
Germany. The order, the planning, the State encouragement of
science, the steel, the concrete, the aeroplanes, are all there,
but all in the service of ideas appropriate to the Stone Age.
Science is fighting on the side of superstition. But obviously it
is impossible for Wells to accept this. It would contradict the
world-view on which his own works are based. The war-lords and the
witch-doctors <i>must</i> fail, the common-sense World State, as
seen by a nineteenth-century liberal whose heart does not leap at
the sound of bugles, <i>must</i> triumph. Treachery and defeatism
apart, Hitler <i>cannot</i> be a danger. That he should finally win
would be an impossible reversal of history, like a Jacobite
restoration.</p>

<p>But is it not a sort of parricide for a person of my age
(thirty-eight) to find fault with H.G. Wells? Thinking people who
were born about the beginning of this century are in some sense
Wells's own creation. How much influence any mere writer has, and
especially a "popular" writer whose work takes effect quickly, is
questionable, but I doubt whether anyone who was writing books
between 1900 and 1920, at any rate in the English language,
influenced the young so much. The minds of all of us, and therefore
the physical world, would be perceptibly different if Wells had
never existed. Only, just the singleness of mind, the one-sided
imagination that made him seem like an inspired prophet in the
Edwardian age, make him a shallow, inadequate thinker now. When
Wells was young, the antithesis between science and reaction was
not false. Society was ruled by narrow-minded, profoundly incurious
people, predatory businessmen, dull squires, bishops, politicians
who could quote Horace but had never heard of algebra. Science was
faintly disreputable and religious belief obligatory.
Traditionalism, stupidity, snobbishness, patriotism, superstition
and love of war seemed to be all on the same side; there was need
of someone who could state the opposite point of view. Back in the
nineteen-hundreds it was a wonderful experience for a boy to
discover H.G. Wells. There you were, in a world of pedants,
clergymen and golfers, with your future employers exhorting you to
"get on or get out", your parents systematically warping your
sexual life, and your dull-witted schoolmasters sniggering over
their Latin tags; and here was this wonderful man who could tell
you about the inhabitants of the planets and the bottom of the sea,
and who knew that the future was not going to be what respectable
people imagined. A decade or so before aeroplanes were technically
feasible Wells knew that within a little while men would be able to
fly. He knew that because he himself wanted to be able to fly, and
therefore felt sure that research in that direction would continue.
On the other hand, even when I was a little boy, at a time when the
Wright brothers had actually lifted their machine off the ground
for fifty-nine seconds, the generally accepted opinion was that if
God had meant us to fly He would have given us wings. Up to 1914
Wells was in the main a true prophet. In physical details his
vision of the new world has been fulfilled to a surprising
extent.</p>

<p>But because he belonged to the nineteenth century and to a
non-military nation and class, he could not grasp the tremendous
strength of the old world which was symbolised in his mind by
fox-hunting Tories. He was, and still is, quite incapable of
understanding that nationalism, religious bigotry and feudal
loyalty are far more powerful forces than what he himself would
describe as sanity. Creatures out of the Dark Ages have come
marching into the present, and if they are ghosts they are at any
rate ghosts which need a strong magic to lay them. The people who
have shown the best understanding of Fascism are either those who
have suffered under it or those who have a Fascist streak in
themselves. A crude book like <i>The Iron Heel</i>, written nearly
thirty years ago, is a truer prophecy of the future than either
<i>Brave New World</i> or <i>The Shape Of Things To Come</i>. If
one had to choose among Wells's own contemporaries a writer who
could stand towards him as a corrective, one might choose Kipling,
who was not deaf to the evil voices of power and military "glory".
Kipling would have understood the appeal of Hitler, or for that
matter of Stalin, whatever his attitude towards them might be.
Wells is too sane to understand the modern world. The succession of
lower-middle-class novels which are his greatest achievement
stopped short at the other war and never really began again, and
since 1920 he has squandered his talents in slaying paper dragons.
But how much it is, after all, to have any talents to squander.</p>

</p>

<h2>LOOKING BACK ON THE SPANISH WAR (1942)</h2>

<p><b>1.</b>
</p>

<p>First of all the physical memories, the sounds, the smells and
the surfaces of things.</p>

<p>It is curious that more vividly than anything that came
afterwards in the Spanish war I remember the week of so-called
training that we received before being sent to the front&mdash;the
huge cavalry barracks in Barcelona with its draughty stables and
cobbled yards, the icy cold of the pump where one washed, the
filthy meals made tolerable by pannikins of wine, the Trousered
militia-women chopping firewood, and the roll-call in the early
mornings where my prosaic English name made a sort of comic
interlude among the resounding Spanish ones, Manuel Gonzalez, Pedro
Aguilar, Ramon Fenellosa, Roque Ballaster, Jaime Domenech,
Sebastian Viltron, Ramon Nuvo Bosch. I name those particular men
because I remember the faces of all of them. Except for two who
were mere riff-raff and have doubtless become good Falangists by
this time, it is probable that all of them are dead. Two of them I
know to be dead. The eldest would have been about twenty-five, the
youngest sixteen.</p>

<p>One of the essential experiences of war is never being able to
escape from disgusting smells of human origin. Latrines are an
overworked subject in war literature, and I would not mention them
if it were not that the latrine in our barracks did its necessary
bit towards puncturing my own illusions about the Spanish civil
war. The Latin type of latrine, at which you have to squat, is bad
enough at its best, but these were made of some kind of polished
stone so slippery that it was all you could do to keep on your
feet. In addition they were always blocked. Now I have plenty of
other disgusting things in my memory, but I believe it was these
latrines that first brought home to me the thought, so often to
recur: 'Here we are, soldiers of a revolutionary army, defending
Democracy against Fascism, fighting a war which is <i>about</i>
something, and the detail of our lives is just as sordid and
degrading as it could be in prison, let alone in a bourgeois army.'
Many other things reinforced this impression later; for instance,
the boredom and animal hunger of trench life, the squalid intrigues
over scraps of food, the mean, nagging quarrels which people
exhausted by lack of sleep indulge in.</p>

<p>The essential horror of army life (whoever has been a soldier
will know what I mean by the essential horror of army life) is
barely affected by the nature of the war you happen to be fighting
in. Discipline, for instance, is ultimately the same in all armies.
Orders have to be obeyed and enforced by punishment if necessary,
the relationship of officer and man has to be the relationship of
superior and inferior. The picture of war set forth in books like
<i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> is substantially true.
Bullets hurt, corpses stink, men under fire are often so frightened
that they wet their trousers. It is true that the social background
from which an army springs will colour its training, tactics and
general efficiency, and also that the consciousness of being in the
right can bolster up morale, though this affects the civilian
population more than the troops. (People forget that a soldier
anywhere near the front line is usually too hungry, or frightened,
or cold, or, above all, too tired to bother about the political
origins of the war.) But the laws of nature are not suspended for a
'red' army any more than for a 'white' one. A louse is a louse and
a bomb is a bomb, even though the cause you are fighting for
happens to be just.</p>

<p>Why is it worth while to point out anything so obvious? Because
the bulk of the British and American intelligentsia were manifestly
unaware of it then, and are now. Our memories are short nowadays,
but look back a bit, dig out the files of <i>New Masses</i> or the
<i>Daily Worker</i>, and just have a look at the romantic
warmongering muck that our left-wingers were spilling at that time.
All the stale old phrases! And the unimaginative callousness of it!
The sang-froid with which London faced the bombing of Madrid! Here
I am not bothering about the counter-propagandists of the Right,
the Lunns, Garvins <i>et hoc genus</i>; they go without saying. But
here were the very people who for twenty years had hooted and
jeered at the 'glory' of war, at atrocity stories, at patriotism,
even at physical courage, coming out with stuff that with the
alteration of a few names would have fitted into the <i>Daily
Mail</i> of 1918. If there was one thing that the British
intelligentsia were committed to, it was the debunking version of
war, the theory that war is all corpses and latrines and never
leads to any good result. Well, the same people who in 1933
sniggered pityingly if you said that in certain circumstances you
would fight for your country, in 1937 were denouncing you as a
Trotsky-Fascist if you suggested that the stories in <i>New
Masses</i> about freshly wounded men clamouring to get back into
the fighting might be exaggerated. And the Left intelligentsia made
their swing-over from 'War is hell' to 'War is glorious' not only
with no sense of incongruity but almost without any intervening
stage. Later the bulk of them were to make other transitions
equally violent. There must be a quite large number of people, a
sort of central core of the intelligentsia, who approved the 'King
and Country' declaration in 1935, shouted for a' firm line against
Germany' in 1937, supported the People's Convention in 1940, and
are demanding a Second Front now.</p>

<p>As far as the mass of the people go, the extraordinary swings of
opinion which occur nowadays, the emotions which can be turned on
and off like a tap, are the result of newspaper and radio hypnosis.
In the intelligentsia I should say they result rather from money
and mere physical safety. At a given moment they may be 'pro-war'
or 'anti-war', but in either case they have no realistic picture of
war in their minds. When they enthused over the Spanish war they
knew, of course, that people were being killed and that to be
killed is unpleasant, but they did feel that for a soldier in the
Spanish Republican army the experience of war was somehow not
degrading. Somehow the latrines stank less, discipline was less
irksome. You have only to glance at the <i>New Statesman</i> to see
that they believed that; exactly similar blah is being written
about the Red Army at this moment. We have become too civilized to
grasp the obvious. For the truth is very simple. To survive you
often have to fight, and to fight you have to dirty yourself. War
is evil, and it is often the lesser evil. Those who take the sword
perish by the sword, and those who don't take the sword perish by
smelly diseases. The fact that such a platitude is worth writing
down shows what the years of <i>rentier</i> capitalism have done to
us.</p>

<p><b>2.</b>
</p>

<p>In connexion with what I have just said, a footnote, on
atrocities.</p>

<p>I have little direct evidence about the atrocities in the
Spanish civil war. I know that some were committed by the
Republicans, and far more (they are still continuing) by the
Fascists. But what impressed me then, and has impressed me ever
since, is that atrocities are believed in or disbelieved in solely
on grounds of political predilection. Everyone believes in the
atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side,
without ever bothering to examine the evidence. Recently I drew up
a table of atrocities during the period between 1918 and the
present; there was never a year when atrocities were not occurring
somewhere or other, and there was hardly a single case when the
Left and the Right believed in the same stories simultaneously. And
stranger yet, at any moment the situation can suddenly reverse
itself and yesterday's proved-to-the-hilt atrocity story can become
a ridiculous lie, merely because the political landscape has
changed.</p>

<p>In the present war we are in the curious situation that our
'atrocity campaign' was done largely before the war started, and
done mostly by the Left, the people who normally pride themselves
on their incredulity. In the same period the Right, the
atrocity-mongers of 1914-18, were gazing at Nazi Germany and flatly
refusing to see any evil in it. Then as soon as war broke out it
was the pro-Nazis of yesterday who were repeating horror stories,
while the anti-Nazis suddenly found themselves doubting whether the
Gestapo really existed. Nor was this solely the result of the
Russo-German Pact. It was partly because before the war the Left
had wrongly believed that Britain and Germany would never fight and
were therefore able to be anti-German and anti-British
simultaneously; partly also because official war-propaganda, with
its disgusting hypocrisy and self-righteousness, always tends to
make thinking people sympathize with the enemy. Part of the price
we paid for the systematic lying of 1914-17 was the exaggerated
pro-German reaction which followed. During the years 1918-33 you
were hooted at in left-wing circles if you suggested that Germany
bore even a fraction of responsibility for the war. In all the
denunciations of Versailles I listened to during those years I
don't think I ever once heard the question, 'What would have
happened if Germany had won?' even mentioned, let alone discussed.
So also with atrocities. The truth, it is felt, becomes untruth
when your enemy utters it. Recently I noticed that the very people
who swallowed any and every horror story about the Japanese in
Nanking in 1937 refused to believe exactly the same stories about
Hong Kong in 1942. There was even a tendency to feel that the
Nanking atrocities had become, as it were, retrospectively untrue
because the British Government now drew attention to them.</p>

<p>But unfortunately the truth about atrocities is far worse than
that they are lied about and made into propaganda. The truth is
that they happen. The fact often adduced as a reason for
scepticism&mdash;that the same horror stories come up in war after
war&mdash;merely makes it rather more likely that these stories are
true. Evidently they are widespread fantasies, and war provides an
opportunity of putting them into practice. Also, although it has
ceased to be fashionable to say so, there is little question that
what one may roughly call the 'whites' commit far more and worse
atrocities than the 'reds'. There is not the slightest doubt, for
instance, about the behaviour of the Japanese in China. Nor is
there much doubt about the long tale of Fascist outrages during the
last ten years in Europe. The volume of testimony is enormous, and
a respectable proportion of it comes from the German press and
radio. These things really happened, that is the thing to keep
one's eye on. They happened even though Lord Halifax said they
happened. The raping and butchering in Chinese cities, the tortures
in the cellars of the Gestapo, the elderly Jewish professors flung
into cesspools, the machine-gunning of refugees along the Spanish
roads&mdash;they all happened, and they did not happen any the less
because the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> has suddenly found out about
them when it is five years too late.</p>

<p><b>3.</b>
</p>

<p>Two memories, the first not proving anything in particular, the
second, I think, giving one a certain insight into the atmosphere
of a revolutionary period:</p>

<p>Early one morning another man and I had gone out to snipe at the
Fascists in the trenches outside Huesca. Their line and ours here
lay three hundred yards apart, at which range our aged rifles would
not shoot accurately, but by sneaking out to a spot about a hundred
yards from the Fascist trench you might, if you were lucky, get a
shot at someone through a gap in the parapet. Unfortunately the
ground between was a flat beet field with no cover except a few
ditches, and it was necessary to go out while it was still-dark and
return soon after dawn, before the light became too good. This time
no Fascists appeared, and we stayed too long and were caught by the
dawn. We were in a ditch, but behind us were two hundred yards of
flat ground with hardly enough cover for a rabbit. We were still
trying to nerve ourselves to make a dash for it when there was an
uproar and a blowing of whistles in the Fascist trench. Some of our
aeroplanes were coming over. At this moment, a man presumably
carrying a message to an officer, jumped out of the trench and ran
along the top of the parapet in full view. He was half-dressed and
was holding up his trousers with both hands as he ran. I refrained
from shooting at him. It is true that I am a poor shot and unlikely
to hit a running man at a hundred yards, and also that I was
thinking chiefly about getting back to our trench while the
Fascists had their attention fixed on the aeroplanes. Still, I did
not shoot partly because of that detail about the trousers. I had
come here to shoot at 'Fascists'; but a man who is holding up his
trousers isn't a 'Fascist', he is visibly a fellow-creature,
similar to yourself, and you don't feel like shooting at him.</p>

<p>What does this incident demonstrate? Nothing very much, because
it is the kind of thing that happens all the time in all wars. The
other is different. I don't suppose that in telling it I can make
it moving to you who read it, but I ask you to believe that it is
moving to me, as an incident characteristic of the moral atmosphere
of a particular moment in time.</p>

<p>One of the recruits who joined us while I was at the barracks
was a wild-looking boy from the back streets of Barcelona. He was
ragged and barefooted. He was also extremely dark (Arab blood, I
dare say), and made gestures you do not usually see a European
make; one in particular&mdash;the arm outstretched, the palm
vertical&mdash;was a gesture characteristic of Indians. One day a
bundle of cigars, which you could still buy dirt cheap at that
time, was stolen out of my bunk. Rather foolishly I reported this
to the officer, and one of the scallywags I have already mentioned
promptly came forward and said quite untruly that twenty-five
pesetas had been stolen from his bunk. For some reason the officer
instantly decided that the brown-faced boy must be the thief. They
were very hard on stealing in the militia, and in theory people
could be shot for it. The wretched boy allowed himself to be led
off to the guardroom to be searched. What most struck me was that
he barely attempted to protest his innocence. In the fatalism of
his attitude you could see the desperate poverty in which he had
been bred. The officer ordered him to take his clothes off. With a
humility which was horrible to me he stripped himself naked, and
his clothes were searched. Of course neither the cigars nor the
money were there; in fact he had not stolen them. What was most
painful of all was that he seemed no less ashamed after his
innocence had been established. That night I took him to the
pictures and gave him brandy and chocolate. But that too was
horrible&mdash;I mean the attempt to wipe out an injury with money.
For a few minutes I had half believed him to be a thief, and that
could not be wiped out.</p>

<p>Well, a few weeks later at the front I had trouble with one of
the men in my section. By this time I was a 'cabo', or corporal, in
command of twelve men. It was static warfare, horribly cold, and
the chief job was getting sentries to stay awake at their posts.
One day a man suddenly refused to go to a certain post, which he
said quite truly was exposed to enemy fire. He was a feeble
creature, and I seized hold of him and began to drag him towards
his post. This roused the feelings of the others against me, for
Spaniards, I think, resent being touched more than we do. Instantly
I was surrounded by a ring of shouting men:' Fascist! Fascist! Let
that man go! This isn't a bourgeois army. Fascist!' etc., etc. As
best I could in my bad Spanish I shouted back that orders had got
to be obeyed, and the row developed into one of those enormous
arguments by means of which discipline is gradually hammered out in
revolutionary armies. Some said I was right, others said I was
wrong. But the point is that the one who took my side the most
warmly of all was the brown-faced boy. As soon as he saw what was
happening he sprang into the ring and began passionately defending
me. With his strange, wild, Indian gesture he kept exclaiming,
'He's the best corporal we've got!' (<i>No hay cabo como el</i>!)
Later on he applied for leave to exchange into my section.</p>

<p>Why is this incident touching to me? Because in any normal
circumstances it would have been impossible for good feelings ever
to be re-established between this boy and myself. The implied
accusation of theft would not have been made any better, probably
somewhat worse, by my efforts to make amends. One of the effects of
safe and civilized life is an immense oversensitiveness which makes
all the primary emotions seem somewhat disgusting. Generosity is as
painful as meanness, gratitude as hateful as ingratitude. But in
Spain in 1936 we were not living in a normal time. It was a time
when generous feelings and gestures were easier than they
ordinarily are. I could relate a dozen similar incidents, not
really communicable but bound up in my own mind with the special
atmosphere of the time, the shabby clothes and the gay-coloured
revolutionary posters, the universal use of the word 'comrade', the
anti-Fascist ballads printed on flimsy paper and sold for a penny,
the phrases like 'international proletarian solidarty',
pathetically repeated by ignorant men who believed them to mean
something. Could you feel friendly towards somebody, and stick up
for him in a quarrel, after you had been ignominiously searched in
his presence for property you were supposed to have stolen from
him? No, you couldn't; but you might if you had both been through
some emotionally widening experience. That is one of the
by-products of revolution, though in this case it was only the
beginnings of a revolution, and obviously foredoomed to
failure.</p>

<p><b>4.</b>
</p>

<p>The struggle for power between the Spanish Republican parties is
an unhappy, far-off thing which I have no wish to revive at this
date. I only mention it in order to say: believe nothing, or next
to nothing, of what you read about internal affairs on the
Government side. It is all, from whatever source, party
propaganda&mdash;that is to say, lies. The broad truth about the
war is simple enough. The Spanish bourgeoisie saw their chance of
crushing the labour movement, and took it, aided by the Nazis and
by the forces of reaction all over the world. It is doubtful
whether more than that will ever be established.</p>

<p>I remember saying once to Arthur Koestler, 'History stopped in
1936', at which he nodded in immediate understanding. We were both
thinking of totalitarianism in general, but more particularly of
the Spanish civil war. Early in life I have noticed that no event
is ever correctly reported in a newspaper, but in Spain, for the
first time, I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation
to the facts, not even the relationship which is implied in an
ordinary lie. I saw great battles reported where there had been no
fighting, and complete silence where hundreds of men had been
killed. I saw troops who had fought bravely denounced as cowards
and traitors, and others who had never seen a shot fired hailed as
the heroes of imaginary victories; and I saw newspapers in London
retailing these lies and eager intellectuals building emotional
superstructures over events that had never happened. I saw, in
fact, history being written not in terms of what happened but of
what ought to have happened according to various 'party lines'. Yet
in a way, horrible as all this was, it was unimportant. It
concerned secondary issues&mdash;namely, the struggle for power
between the Comintern and the Spanish left-wing parties, and the
efforts of the Russian Government to prevent revolution in Spain.
But the broad picture of the war which the Spanish Government
presented to the world was not untruthful. The main issues were
what it said they were. But as for the Fascists and their backers,
how could they come even as near to the truth as that? How could
they possibly mention their real aims? Their version of the war was
pure fantasy, and in the circumstances it could not have been
otherwise.</p>

<p>The only propaganda line open to the Nazis and Fascists was to
represent themselves as Christian patriots saving Spain from a
Russian dictatorship. This involved pretending that life in
Government Spain was just one long massacre (<i>vide</i> the
<i>Catholic Herald</i> or the <i>Daily Mail</i>&mdash;but these
were child's play compared with the Continental Fascist press), and
it involved immensely exaggerating the scale of Russian
intervention. Out of the huge pyramid of lies which the Catholic
and reactionary press all over the world built up, let me take just
one point&mdash;the presence in Spain of a Russian army. Devout
Franco partisans all believed in this; estimates of its strength
went as high as half a million. Now, there was no Russian army in
Spain. There may have been a handful of airmen and other
technicians, a few hundred at the most, but an army there was not.
Some thousands of foreigners who fought in Spain, not to mention
millions of Spaniards, were witnesses of this. Well, their
testimony made no impression at all upon the Franco propagandists,
not one of whom had set foot in Government Spain. Simultaneously
these people refused utterly to admit the fact of German or Italian
intervention at the same time as the Germany and Italian press were
openly boasting about the exploits of their' legionaries'. I have
chosen to mention only one point, but in fact the whole of Fascist
propaganda about the war was on this level.</p>

<p>This kind of thing is frightening to me, because it often gives
me the feeling that the very concept of objective truth is fading
out of the world. After all, the chances are that those lies, or at
any rate similar lies, will pass into history. How will the history
of the Spanish war be written? If Franco remains in power his
nominees will write the history books, and (to stick to my chosen
point) that Russian army which never existed will become historical
fact, and schoolchildren will learn about it generations hence. But
suppose Fascism is finally defeated and some kind of democratic
government restored in Spain in the fairly near future; even then,
how is the history of the war to be written? What kind of records
will Franco have left behind him? Suppose even that the records
kept on the Government side are recoverable&mdash;even so, how is a
true history of the war to be written? For, as I have pointed out
already, the Government, also dealt extensively in lies. From the
anti-Fascist angle one could write a broadly truthful history of
the war, but it would be a partisan history, unreliable on every
minor point. Yet, after all, some kind of history will be written,
and after those who actually remember the war are dead, it will be
universally accepted. So for all practical purposes the lie will
have become truth.</p>

<p>I know it is the fashion to say that most of recorded history is
lies anyway. I am willing to believe that history is for the most
part inaccurate and biased, but what is peculiar to our own age is
the abandonment of the idea that history <i>could</i> be truthfully
written. In the past people deliberately lied, or they
unconsciously coloured what they wrote, or they struggled after the
truth, well knowing that they must make many mistakes; but in each
case they believed that 'facts' existed and were more or less
discoverable. And in practice there was always a considerable body
of fact which would have been agreed to by almost everyone. If you
look up the history of the last war in, for instance, the
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, you will find that a respectable
amount of the material is drawn from German sources. A British and
a German historian would disagree deeply on many things, even on
fundamentals, but there would still be that body of, as it were,
neutral fact on which neither would seriously challenge the other.
It is just this common basis of agreement, with its implication
that human beings are all one species of animal, that
totalitarianism destroys. Nazi theory indeed specifically denies
that such a thing as 'the truth' exists. There is, for instance, no
such thing as 'Science'. There is only 'German Science', 'Jewish
Science', etc. The implied objective of this line of thought is a
nightmare world in which the Leader, or some ruling clique,
controls not only the future but <i>the past</i>. If the Leader
says of such and such an event, 'It never happened'&mdash;well, it
never happened. If he says that two and two are five&mdash;well,
two and two are five. This prospect frightens me much more than
bombs&mdash;and after our experiences of the last few years that is
not a frivolous statement.</p>

<p>But is it perhaps childish or morbid to terrify oneself with
visions of a totalitarian future? Before writing off the
totalitarian world as a nightmare that can't come true, just
remember that in 1925 the world of today would have seemed a
nightmare that couldn't come true. Against that shifting
phantasmagoric world in which black may be white tomorrow and
yesterday's weather can be changed by decree, there are in reality
only two safeguards. One is that however much you deny the truth,
the truth goes on existing, as it were, behind your back, and you
consequently can't violate it in ways that impair military
efficiency. The other is that so long as some parts of the earth
remain unconquered, the liberal tradition can be kept alive. Let
Fascism, or possibly even a combination of several Fascisms,
conquer the whole world, and those two conditions no longer exist.
We in England underrate the danger of this kind of thing, because
our traditions and our past security have given us a sentimental
belief that it all comes right in the end and the thing you most
fear never really happens. Nourished for hundreds of years on a
literature in which Right invariably triumphs in the last chapter,
we believe half-instinctively that evil always defeats itself in
the long run. Pacifism, for instance, is founded largely on this
belief. Don't resist evil, and it will somehow destroy itself. But
why should it? What evidence is there that it does? And what
instance is there of a modern industrialized state collapsing
unless conquered from the outside by military force?</p>

<p>Consider for instance the re-institution of slavery. Who could
have imagined twenty years ago that slavery would return to Europe?
Well, slavery has been restored under our noses. The forced-labour
camps all over Europe and North Africa where Poles, Russians, Jews
and political prisoners of every race toil at road-making or
swamp-draining for their bare rations, are simple chattel slavery.
The most one can say is that the buying and selling of slaves by
individuals is not yet permitted. In other ways&mdash;the
breaking-up of families, for instance&mdash;the conditions are
probably worse than they were on the American cotton plantations.
There is no reason for thinking that this state of affairs will
change while any totalitarian domination endures. We don't grasp
its full implications, because in our mystical way we feel that a
régime founded on slavery <i>must</i> collapse. But it is worth
comparing the duration of the slave empires of antiquity with that
of any modern state. Civilizations founded on slavery have lasted
for such periods as four thousand years.</p>

<p>When I think of antiquity, the detail that frightens me is that
those hundreds of millions of slaves on whose backs civilization
rested generation after generation have left behind them no record
whatever. We do not even know their names. In the whole of Greek
and Roman history, how many slaves' names are known to you? I can
think of two, or possibly three. One is Spartacus and the other is
Epictetus. Also, in the Roman room at the British Museum there is a
glass jar with the maker's name inscribed on the bottom, '<i>felix
fecit</i>'. I have a mental picture of poor Felix (a Gaul with red
hair and a metal collar round his neck), but in fact he may not
have been a slave; so there are only two slaves whose names I
definitely know, and probably few people can remember more. The
rest have gone down into utter silence.</p>

<p><b>5.</b>
</p>

<p>The backbone of the resistance against Franco was the Spanish
working class, especially the urban trade union members. In the
long run&mdash;it is important to remember that it is only in the
long run&mdash;the working class remains the most reliable enemy of
Fascism, simply because the working-class stands to gain most by a
decent reconstruction of society. Unlike other classes or
categories, it can't be permanently bribed.</p>

<p>To say this is not to idealize the working class. In the long
struggle that has followed the Russian Revolution it is the manual
workers who have been defeated, and it is impossible not to feel
that it was their own fault. Time after time, in country after
country, the organized working-class movements have been crushed by
open, illegal violence, and their comrades abroad, linked to them
in theoretical solidarity, have simply looked on and done nothing;
and underneath this, secret cause of many betrayals, has lain the
fact that between white and coloured workers there is not even
lip-service to solidarity. Who can believe in the class-conscious
international proletariat after the events of the past ten years?
To the British working class the massacre of their comrades in
Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, or wherever it might be seemed less
interesting and less important than yesterday's football match. Yet
this does not alter the fact that the working class will go on
struggling against Fascism after the others have caved in. One
feature of the Nazi conquest of France was the astonishing
defections among the intelligentsia, including some of the
left-wing political intelligentsia. The intelligentsia are the
people who squeal loudest against Fascism, and yet a respectable
proportion of them collapse into defeatism when the pinch comes.
They are far-sighted enough to see the odds against them, and
moreover they can be bribed&mdash;for it is evident that the Nazis
think it worth while to bribe intellectuals. With the working class
it is the other way about. Too ignorant to see through the trick
that is being played on them, they easily swallow the promises of
Fascism, yet sooner or later they always take up the struggle
again. They must do so, because in their own bodies they always
discover that the promises of Fascism cannot be fulfilled. To win
over the working class permanently, the Fascists would have to
raise the general standard of living, which they are unable and
probably unwilling to do. The struggle of the working class is like
the growth of a plant. The plant is blind and stupid, but it knows
enough to keep pushing upwards towards the light, and it will do
this in the face of endless discouragements. What are the workers
struggling for? Simply for the decent life which they are more and
more aware is now technically possible. Their consciousness of this
aim ebbs and flows. In Spain, for a while, people were acting
consciously, moving towards a goal which they wanted to reach and
believed they could reach. It accounted for the curiously buoyant
feeling that life in Government Spain had during the early months
of the war. The common people knew in their bones that the Republic
was their friend and Franco was their enemy. They knew that they
were in the right, because they were fighting for something which
the world owed them and was able to give them.</p>

<p>One has to remember this to see the Spanish war in its true
perspective. When one thinks of the cruelty, squalor, and futility
of War&mdash;and in this particular case of the intrigues, the
persecutions, the lies and the misunderstandings&mdash;there is
always the temptation to say: 'One side is as bad as the other. I
am neutral'. In practice, however, one cannot be neutral, and there
is hardly such a thing as a war in which it makes no difference who
wins. Nearly always one stands more or less for progress, the other
side more or less for reaction. The hatred which the Spanish
Republic excited in millionaires, dukes, cardinals, play-boys,
Blimps, and what-not would in itself be enough to show one how the
land lay. In essence it was a class war. If it had been won, the
cause of the common people everywhere would have been strengthened.
It was lost, and the dividend-drawers all over the world rubbed
their hands. That was the real issue; all else was froth on its
surface.</p>

<p><b>6.</b>
</p>

<p>The outcome of the Spanish war was settled in London, Paris,
Rome, Berlin&mdash;at any rate not in Spain. After the summer of
1937 those with eyes in their heads realized that the Government
could not win the war unless there were some profound change in the
international set-up, and in deciding to fight on Negrin and the
others may have been partly influenced by the expectation that the
world war which actually broke out in 1939 was coming in 1938. The
much-publicized disunity on the Government side was not a main
cause of defeat. The Government militias were hurriedly raised,
ill-armed and unimaginative in their military outlook, but they
would have been the same if complete political agreement had
existed from the start. At the outbreak of war the average Spanish
factory-worker did not even know how to fire a rifle (there had
never been universal conscription in Spain), and the traditional
pacifism of the Left was a great handicap. The thousands of
foreigners who served in Spain made good infantry, but there were
very few experts of any kind among them. The Trotskyist thesis that
the war could have been won if the revolution had not been
sabotaged was probably false. To nationalize factories, demolish
churches, and issue revolutionary manifestoes would not have made
the armies more efficient. The Fascists won because they were the
stronger; they had modern arms and the others hadn't. No political
strategy could offset that.</p>

<p>The most baffling thing in the Spanish war was the behaviour of
the great powers. The war was actually won for Franco by the
Germans and Italians, whose motives were obvious enough. The
motives of France and Britain are less easy to understand. In 1936
it was clear to everyone that if Britain would only help the
Spanish Government, even to the extent of a few million pounds'
worth of arms, Franco would collapse and German strategy would be
severely dislocated. By that time one did not need to be a
clairvoyant to foresee that war between Britain and Germany was
coming; one could even foretell within a year or two when it would
come. Yet in the most mean, cowardly, hypocritical way the British
ruling class did all they could to hand Spain over to Franco and
the Nazis. Why? Because they were pro-Fascist, was the obvious
answer. Undoubtedly they were, and yet when it came to the final
showdown they chose to Stand up to Germany. It is still very
uncertain what plan they acted on in backing Franco, and they may
have had no clear plan at all. Whether the British ruling class are
wicked or merely stupid is one of the most difficult questions of
our time, and at certain moments a very important question. As to
the Russians, their motives in the Spanish war are completely
inscrutable. Did they, as the pinks believed, intervene in Spain in
order to defend Democracy and thwart the Nazis? Then why did they
intervene on such a niggardly scale and finally leave Spain in the
lurch? Or did they, as the Catholics maintained, intervene in order
to foster revolution in Spain? Then why did they do all in their
power to crush the Spanish revolutionary movements, defend private
property and hand power to the middle class as against the working
class? Or did they, as the Trotskyists suggested, intervene simply
in order to <i>prevent</i> a Spanish revolution? Then why not have
backed Franco? Indeed, their actions are most easily explained if
one assumes that they were acting on several contradictory motives.
I believe that in the future we shall come to feel that Stalin's
foreign policy, instead of being so diabolically clever as it is
claimed to be, has been merely opportunistic and stupid. But at any
rate, the Spanish civil war demonstrated that the Nazis knew what
they were doing and their opponents did not. The war was fought at
a low technical level and its major strategy was very simple. That
side which had arms would win. The Nazis and the Italians gave arms
to the Spanish Fascist friends, and the western democracies and the
Russians didn't give arms to those who should have been their
friends. So the Spanish Republic perished, having' gained what no
republic missed'.</p>

<p>Whether it was right, as all left-wingers in other countries
undoubtedly did, to encourage the Spaniards to go on fighting when
they could not win is a question hard to answer. I myself think it
was right, because I believe that it is better even from the point
of view of survival to fight and be conquered than to surrender
without fighting. The effects on the grand strategy of the struggle
against Fascism cannot be assessed yet. The ragged, weaponless
armies of the Republic held out for two and a half years, which was
undoubtedly longer than their enemies expected. But whether that
dislocated the Fascist timetable, or whether, on the other hand, it
merely postponed the major war and gave the Nazis extra time to get
their war machine into trim, is still uncertain.</p>

<p><b>7.</b>
</p>

<p>I never think of the Spanish war without two memories coming
into my mind. One is of the hospital ward at Lerida and the rather
sad voices of the wounded militiamen singing some song with a
refrain that ended&mdash;</p>

<p>Una resolucion,<br>
Luchar hast' al fin!</p>

<p>Well, they fought to the end all right. For the last eighteen
months of the war the Republican armies must have been fighting
almost without cigarettes, and with precious little food. Even when
I left Spain in the middle of 1937, meat and bread were scarce,
tobacco a rarity, coffee and sugar almost unobtainable.</p>

<p>The other memory is of the Italian militiaman who shook my hand
in the guardroom, the day I joined the militia. I wrote about this
man at the beginning of my book on the Spanish war [Homage to
Catalonia], and do not want to repeat what I said there. When I
remember&mdash;oh, how vividly!&mdash;his shabby uniform and
fierce, pathetic, innocent face, the complex side-issues of the war
seem to fade away and I see clearly that there was at any rate no
doubt as to who was in the right. In spite of power politics and
journalistic lying, the central issue of the war was the attempt of
people like this to win the decent life which they knew to be their
birthright. It is difficult to think of this particular man's
probable end without several kinds of bitterness. Since I met him
in the Lenin Barracks he was probably a Trotskyist or an Anarchist,
and in the peculiar conditions of our time, when people of that
sort are not killed by the Gestapo they are usually killed by the
G.P.U. But that does not affect the long-term issues. This man's
face, which I saw only for a minute or two, remains with me as a
sort of visual reminder of what the war was really about. He
symbolizes for me the flower of the European working class, harried
by the police of all countries, the people who fill the mass graves
of the Spanish battlefields and are now, to the tune of several
millions, rotting in forced-labour camps.</p>

<p>When one thinks of all the people who support or have supported
Fascism, one stands amazed at their diversity. What a crew! Think
of a programme which at any rate for a while could bring Hitler,
Petain, Montagu Norman, Pavelitch, William Randolph Hearst,
Streicher, Buchman, Ezra Pound, Juan March, Cocteau, Thyssen,
Father Coughlin, the Mufti of Jerusalem, Arnold Lunn, Antonescu,
Spengler, Beverley Nichols, Lady Houston, and Marinetti all into
the same boat! But the clue is really very simple. They are all
people with something to lose, or people who long for a
hierarchical society and dread the prospect of a world of free and
equal human beings. Behind all the ballyhoo that is talked about
'godless' Russia and the 'materialism' of the working class lies
the simple intention of those with money or privileges to cling to
them. Ditto, though it contains a partial truth, with all the talk
about the worthlessness of social reconstruction not accompanied by
a 'change of heart'. The pious ones, from the Pope to the yogis of
California, are great on the' change of heart', much more
reassuring from their point of view than a change in the economic
system. Petain attributes the fall of France to the common people's
'love of pleasure'. One sees this in its right perspective if one
stops to wonder how much pleasure the ordinary French peasant's or
working-man's life would contain compared with Pétain's own. The
damned impertinence of these politicians, priests, literary men,
and what-not who lecture the working-class socialist for his
'materialism'! All that the working man demands is what these
others would consider the indispensable minimum without which human
life cannot be lived at all. Enough to eat, freedom from the
haunting terror of unemployment, the knowledge that your children
will get a fair chance, a bath once a day, clean linen reasonably
often, a roof that doesn't leak, and short enough working hours to
leave you with a little energy when the day is done. Not one of
those who preach against 'materialism' would consider life livable
without these things. And how easily that minimum could be attained
if we chose to set our minds to it for only twenty years! To raise
the standard of living of the whole world to that of Britain would
not be a greater undertaking than the war we have just fought. I
don't claim, and I don't know who does, that that wouldn't solve
anything in itself. It is merely that privation and brute labour
have to be abolished before the real problems of humanity can be
tackled. The major problem of our time is the decay of the belief
in personal immortality, and it cannot be dealt with while the
average human being is either drudging like an ox or shivering in
fear of the secret police. How right the working classes are in
their 'materialism'! How right they are to realize that the belly
comes before the soul, not in the scale of values but in point of
time! Understand that, and the long horror that we are enduring
becomes at least intelligible. All the considerations are likely to
make one falter&mdash;the siren voices of a Pétain or of a Gandhi,
the inescapable fact that in order to fight one has to degrade
oneself, the equivocal moral position of Britain, with its
democratic phrases and its coolie empire, the sinister development
of Soviet Russia, the squalid farce of left-wing politics&mdash;all
this fades away and one sees only the struggle of the gradually
awakening common people against the lords of property and their
hired liars and bumsuckers. The question is very simple. Shall
people like that Italian soldier be allowed to live the decent,
fully human life which is now technically achievable, or shan't
they? Shall the common man be pushed back into the mud, or shall he
not? I myself believe, perhaps on insufficient grounds, that the
common man will win his fight sooner or later, but I want it to be
sooner and not later&mdash;some time within the next hundred years,
say, and not some time within the next ten thousand years. That was
the real issue of the Spanish war, and of the last war, and perhaps
of other wars yet to come.</p>

<p>I never saw the Italian militiaman again, nor did I ever learn
his name. It can be taken as quite certain that he is dead. Nearly
two years later, when the war was visibly lost, I wrote these
verses in his memory:</p>

<pre>
The Italian soldier shook my hand
Beside the guard-room table;
The strong hand and the subtle hand
Whose palms are only able

To meet within the sound of guns,
But oh! what peace I knew then
In gazing on his battered face
Purer than any woman's!

For the flyblown words that make me spew
Still in his ears were holy,
And he was born knowing what I had learned
Out of books and slowly.
</pre>
The treacherous guns had told their tale And we both had bought it,
But my gold brick was made of gold&mdash;Oh! who ever would have
thought it?

<pre>
Good luck go with you, Italian soldier!
But luck is not for the brave;
What would the world give back to you?
Always less than you gave.

Between the shadow and the ghost,
Between the white and the red,
Between the bullet and the lie,
Where would you hide your head?

For where is Manuel Gonzalez,
And where is Pedro Aguilar,
And where is Ramon Fenellosa?
The earthworms know where they are.

Your name and your deeds were forgotten
Before your bones were dry,
And the lie that slew you is buried
Under a deeper lie;

But the thing that I saw in your face
No power can disinherit:
No bomb that ever burst
Shatters the crystal spirit.

<h2>RUDYARD KIPLING (1942)</h2>

<p>It was a pity that Mr. Eliot should be so much on the defensive
in the long essay with which he prefaces this selection of
Kipling's poetry, but it was not to be avoided, because before one
can even speak about Kipling one has to clear away a legend that
has been created by two sets of people who have not read his works.
Kipling is in the peculiar position of having been a byword for
fifty years. During five literary generations every enlightened
person has despised him, and at the end of that time nine-tenths of
those enlightened persons are forgotten and Kipling is in some
sense still there. Mr. Eliot never satisfactorily explains this
fact, because in answering the shallow and familiar charge that
Kipling is a 'Fascist', he falls into the opposite error of
defending him where he is not defensible. It is no use pretending
that Kipling's view of life, as a whole, can be accepted or even
forgiven by any civilized person. It is no use claiming, for
instance, that when Kipling describes a British soldier beating a
'nigger' with a cleaning rod in order to get money out of him, he
is acting merely as a reporter and does not necessarily approve
what he describes. There is not the slightest sign anywhere in
Kipling's work that he disapproves of that kind of conduct&mdash;on
the contrary, there is a definite strain of sadism in him, over and
above the brutality which a writer of that type has to have.
Kipling is a jingo imperialist, he is morally insensitive and
aesthetically disgusting. It is better to start by admitting that,
and then to try to find out why it is that he survives while the
refined people who have sniggered at him seem to wear so badly.</p>

<p>And yet the 'Fascist' charge has to be answered, because the
first clue to any understanding of Kipling, morally or politically,
is the fact that he was <i>not</i> a Fascist. He was further from
being one than the most humane or the most 'progressive' person is
able to be nowadays. An interesting instance of the way in which
quotations are parroted to and fro without any attempt to look up
their context or discover their meaning is the line from
'Recessional', 'Lesser breeds without the Law'. This line is always
good for a snigger in pansy-left circles. It is assumed as a matter
of course that the 'lesser breeds' are 'natives', and a mental
picture is called up of some pukka sahib in a pith helmet kicking a
coolie. In its context the sense of the line is almost the exact
opposite of this. The phrase 'lesser breeds' refers almost
certainly to the Germans, and especially the pan-German writers,
who are 'without the Law' in the sense of being lawless, not in the
sense of being powerless. The whole poem, conventionally thought of
as an orgy of boasting, is a denunciation of power politics,
British as well as German. Two stanzas are worth quoting (I am
quoting this as politics, not as poetry):</p>

<pre>
If, drunk with sight of power, we loose
Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,
Such boastings as the Gentiles use,
Or lesser breeds without the Law&mdash;Lord God of hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget&mdash;lest we forget!

For heathen heart that puts her trust
In reeking tube and iron shard,
All valiant dust that builds on dust,
And guarding, calls not Thee to guard,
For frantic boast and foolish word&mdash;Thy mercy on Thy People, Lord!
</pre>

<p>Much of Kipling's phraseology is taken from the Bible, and no
doubt in the second stanza he had in mind the text from Psalm
CXXVII: 'Except the lord build the house, they labour in vain that
build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in
vain.' It is not a text that makes much impression on the
post-Hitler mind. No one, in our time, believes in any sanction
greater than military power; no one believes that it is possible to
overcome force except by greater force. There is no 'Law', there is
only power. I am not saying that that is a true belief, merely that
it is the belief which all modern men do actually hold. Those who
pretend otherwise are either intellectual cowards, or
power-worshippers under a thin disguise, or have simply not caught
up with the age they are living in. Kipling's outlook is
pre-fascist. He still believes that pride comes before a fall and
that the gods punish <i>hubris</i>. He does not foresee the tank,
the bombing plane, the radio and the secret police, or their
psychological results.</p>

<p>But in saying this, does not one unsay what I said above about
Kipling's jingoism and brutality? No, one is merely saying that the
nineteenth-century imperialist outlook and the modern gangster
outlook are two different things. Kipling belongs very definitely
to the period 1885-1902. The Great War and its aftermath embittered
him, but he shows little sign of having learned anything from any
event later than the Boer War. He was the prophet of British
Imperialism in its expansionist phase (even more than his poems,
his solitary novel, <i>The Light that Failed</i>, gives you the
atmosphere of that time) and also the unofficial historian of the
British Army, the old mercenary army which began to change its
shape in 1914. All his confidence, his bouncing vulgar vitality,
sprang out of limitations which no Fascist or near-Fascist
shares.</p>

<p>Kipling spent the later part of his life in sulking, and no
doubt it was political disappointment rather than literary vanity
that account for this. Somehow history had not gone according to
plan. After the greatest victory she had ever known, Britain was a
lesser world power than before, and Kipling was quite acute enough
to see this. The virtue had gone out of the classes he idealized,
the young were hedonistic or disaffected, the desire to paint the
map red had evaporated. He could not understand what was happening,
because he had never had any grasp of the economic forces
underlying imperial expansion. It is notable that Kipling does not
seem to realize, any more than the average soldier or colonial
administrator, that an empire is primarily a money-making concern.
Imperialism as he sees it is a sort of forcible evangelizing. You
turn a Gatling gun on a mob of unarmed 'natives', and then you
establish 'the Law', which includes roads, railways and a
court-house. He could not foresee, therefore, that the same motives
which brought the Empire into existence would end by destroying it.
It was the same motive, for example, that caused the Malayan
jungles to be cleared for rubber estates, and which now causes
those estates to be handed over intact to the Japanese. The modern
totalitarians know what they are doing, and the nineteenth-century
English did not know what they were doing. Both attitudes have
their advantages, but Kipling was never able to move forward from
one into the other. His outlook, allowing for the fact that after
all he was an artist, was that of the salaried bureaucrat who
despises the 'box-wallah' and often lives a lifetime without
realizing that the 'box-wallah' calls the tune.</p>

<p>But because he identifies himself with the official class, he
does possess one thing which 'enlightened' people seldom or never
possess, and that is a sense of responsibility. The middle-class
Left hate him for this quite as much as for his cruelty and
vulgarity. All left-wing parties in the highly industrialized
countries are at bottom a sham, because they make it their business
to fight against something which they do not really wish to
destroy. They have internationalist aims, and at the same time they
struggle to keep up a standard of life with which those aims are
incompatible. We all live by robbing Asiatic coolies, and those of
us who are 'enlightened' all maintain that those coolies ought to
be set free; but our standard of living, and hence our
'enlightenment', demands that the robbery shall continue. A
humanitarian is always a hypocrite, and Kipling's understanding of
this is perhaps the central secret of his power to create telling
phrases. It would be difficult to hit off the one-eyed pacifism of
the English in fewer words than in the phrase, 'making mock of
uniforms that guard you while you sleep'. It is true that Kipling
does not understand the economic aspect of the relationship between
the highbrow and the blimp. He does not see that the map is painted
red chiefly in order that the coolie may be exploited. Instead of
the coolie he sees the Indian Civil Servant; but even on that plane
his grasp of function, of who protects whom, is very sound. He sees
clearly that men can only be highly civilized while other men,
inevitably less civilized, are there to guard and feed them.</p>

<p>How far does Kipling really identify himself with the
administrators, soldiers and engineers whose praises he sings? Not
so completely as is sometimes assumed. He had travelled very widely
while he was still a young man, he had grown up with a brilliant
mind in mainly philistine surroundings, and some streak in him that
may have been partly neurotic led him to prefer the active man to
the sensitive man. The nineteenth-century Anglo-Indians, to name
the least sympathetic of his idols, were at any rate people who did
things. It may be that all that they did was evil, but they changed
the face of the earth (it is instructive to look at a map of Asia
and compare the railway system of India with that of the
surrounding countries), whereas they could have achieved nothing,
could not have maintained themselves in power for a single week, if
the normal Anglo-Indian outlook had been that of, say, E.M.
Forster. Tawdry and shallow though it is, Kipling's is the only
literary picture that we possess of nineteenth-century Anglo-India,
and he could only make it because he was just coarse enough to be
able to exist and keep his mouth shut in clubs and regimental
messes. But he did not greatly resemble the people he admired. I
know from several private sources that many of the Anglo-Indians
who were Kipling's contemporaries did not like or approve of him.
They said, no doubt truly, that he knew nothing about India, and on
the other hand, he was from their point of view too much of a
highbrow. While in India he tended to mix with 'the wrong' people,
and because of his dark complexion he was wrongly suspected of
having a streak of Asiatic blood. Much in his development is
traceable to his having been born in India and having left school
early. With a slightly different background he might have been a
good novelist or a superlative writer of music-hall songs. But how
true is it that he was a vulgar flag-waver, a sort of publicity
agent for Cecil Rhodes? It is true, but it is not true that he was
a yes-man or a time-server. After his early days, if then, he never
courted public opinion. Mr. Eliot says that what is held against
him is that he expressed unpopular views in a popular style. This
narrows the issue by assuming that 'unpopular' means unpopular with
the intelligentsia, but it is a fact that Kipling's 'message' was
one that the big public did not want, and, indeed, has never
accepted. The mass of the people, in the nineties as now, were
anti-militarist, bored by the Empire, and only unconsciously
patriotic. Kipling's official admirers are and were the 'service'
middle class, the people who read <i>Blackwood's</i>. In the stupid
early years of this century, the blimps, having at last discovered
someone who could be called a poet and who was on their side, set
Kipling on a pedestal, and some of his more sententious poems, such
as 'If', were given almost biblical status. But it is doubtful
whether the blimps have ever read him with attention, any more than
they have read the Bible. Much of what he says they could not
possibly approve. Few people who have criticized England from the
inside have said bitterer things about her than this gutter
patriot. As a rule it is the British working class that he is
attacking, but not always. That phrase about 'the flannelled fools
at the wicket and the muddied oafs at the goal' sticks like an
arrow to this day, and it is aimed at the Eton and Harrow match as
well as the Cup-Tie Final. Some of the verses he wrote about the
Boer War have a curiously modern ring, so far as their
subject-matter goes. 'Stellenbosch', which must have been written
about 1902, sums up what every intelligent infantry officer was
saying in 1918, or is saying now, for that matter.</p>

<p>Kipling's romantic ideas about England and the Empire might not
have mattered if he could have held them without having the
class-prejudices which at that time went with them. If one examines
his best and most representative work, his soldier poems,
especially <i>Barrack-Room Ballads</i>, one notices that what more
than anything else spoils them is an underlying air of patronage.
Kipling idealizes the army officer, especially the junior officer,
and that to an idiotic extent, but the private soldier, though
lovable and romantic, has to be a comic. He is always made to speak
in a sort of stylized Cockney, not very broad but with all the
aitches and final "g's" carefully omitted. Very often the result is
as embarrassing as the humorous recitation at a church social. And
this accounts for the curious fact that one can often improve
Kipling's poems, make them less facetious and less blatant, by
simply going through them and transplanting them from Cockney into
standard speech. This is especially true of his refrains, which
often have a truly lyrical quality. Two examples will do (one is
about a funeral and the other about a wedding):</p>

<pre>
So it's knock out your pipes and follow me!
And it's finish up your swipes and follow me!
Oh, hark to the big drum calling,
Follow me&mdash;follow me home!
</pre>

<p>and again:</p>

<pre>
Cheer for the Sergeant's wedding&mdash;Give them one cheer more!
Grey gun-horses in the lando,
And a rogue is married to a whore!
</pre>

<p>Here I have restored the aitches, etc. Kipling ought to have
known better. He ought to have seen that the two closing lines of
the first of these stanzas are very beautiful lines, and that ought
to have overriden his impulse to make fun of a working-man's
accent. In the ancient ballads the lord and the peasant speak the
same language. This is impossible to Kipling, who is looking down a
distorting class-perspective, and by a piece of poetic justice one
of his best lines is spoiled&mdash;for 'follow me 'ome' is much
uglier than 'follow me home'. But even where it makes no difference
musically the facetiousness of his stage Cockney dialect is
irritating. However, he is more often quoted aloud than read on the
printed page, and most people instinctively make the necessary
alterations when they quote him.</p>

<p>Can one imagine any private soldier, in the nineties or now,
reading <i>Barrack-Room Ballads</i> and feeling that here was a
writer who spoke for him? It is very hard to do so. Any soldier
capable of reading a book of verse would notice at once that
Kipling is almost unconscious of the class war that goes on in an
army as much as elsewhere. It is not only that he thinks the
soldier comic, but that he thinks him patriotic, feudal, a ready
admirer of his officers and proud to be a soldier of the Queen. Of
course that is partly true, or battles could not be fought, but
'What have I done for thee, England, my England?' is essentially a
middle-class query. Almost any working man would follow it up
immediately with 'What has England done for me?' In so far as
Kipling grasps this, he simply sets it down to 'the intense
selfishness of the lower classes' (his own phrase). When he is
writing not of British but of 'loyal' Indians he carries the
'Salaam, sahib' motif to sometimes disgusting lengths. Yet it
remains true that he has far more interest in the common soldier,
far more anxiety that he shall get a fair deal, than most of the
'liberals' of his day or our own. He sees that the soldier is
neglected, meanly underpaid and hypocritically despised by the
people whose incomes he safeguards. 'I came to realize', he says in
his posthumous memoirs, 'the bare horrors of the private's life,
and the unnecessary torments he endured'. He is accused of
glorifying war, and perhaps he does so, but not in the usual
manner, by pretending that war is a sort of football match. Like
most people capable of writing battle poetry, Kipling had never
been in battle, but his vision of war is realistic. He knows that
bullets hurt, that under fire everyone is terrified, that the
ordinary soldier never knows what the war is about or what is
happening except in his own corner of the battlefield, and that
British troops, like other troops, frequently run away:</p>

<pre>
I 'eard the knives be'ind me, but I dursn't face my man,
Nor I don't know where I went to, 'cause I didn't stop to see,
Till I 'eard a beggar squealin' out for quarter as 'e ran,
An' I thought I knew the voice an'&mdash;it was me!
</pre>

<p>Modernize the style of this, and it might have come out of one
of the debunking war books of the nineteen-twenties. Or again:</p>

<pre>
An' now the hugly bullets come peckin' through the dust,
An' no one wants to face 'em, but every beggar must;
So, like a man in irons, which isn't glad to go,
They moves 'em off by companies uncommon stiff an' slow.
</pre>

<p>Compare this with:</p>

<pre>
Forward the Light Brigade!
Was there a man dismayed?
No! though the soldier knew
Someone had blundered.
</pre>

<p>If anything, Kipling overdoes the horrors, for the wars of his
youth were hardly wars at all by our standards. Perhaps that is due
to the neurotic strain in him, the hunger for cruelty. But at least
he knows that men ordered to attack impossible objectives
<i>are</i> dismayed, and also that fourpence a day is not a
generous pension.</p>

<p>How complete or truthful a picture has Kipling left us of the
long-service, mercenary army of the late nineteenth century? One
must say of this, as of what Kipling wrote about nineteenth-century
Anglo-India, that it is not only the best but almost the only
literary picture we have. He has put on record an immense amount of
stuff that one could otherwise only gather from verbal tradition or
from unreadable regimental histories. Perhaps his picture of army
life seems fuller and more accurate than it is because any
middle-class English person is likely to know enough to fill up the
gaps. At any rate, reading the essay on Kipling that Mr. Edmund
Wilson has just published or is just about to publish [Note,
below], I was struck by the number of things that are boringly
familiar to us and seem to be barely intelligible to an American.
But from the body of Kipling's early work there does seem to emerge
a vivid and not seriously misleading picture of the old
pre-machine-gun army&mdash;the sweltering barracks in Gibraltar or
Lucknow, the red coats, the pipeclayed belts and the pillbox hats,
the beer, the fights, the floggings, hangings and crucifixions, the
bugle-calls, the smell of oats and horsepiss, the bellowing
sergeants with foot-long moustaches, the bloody skirmishes,
invariably mismanaged, the crowded troopships, the cholera-stricken
camps, the 'native' concubines, the ultimate death in the
workhouse. It is a crude, vulgar picture, in which a patriotic
music-hall turn seems to have got mixed up with one of Zola's
gorier passages, but from it future generations will be able to
gather some idea of what a long-term volunteer army was like. On
about the same level they will be able to learn something of
British India in the days when motor-cars and refrigerators were
unheard of. It is an error to imagine that we might have had better
books on these subjects if, for example, George Moore, or Gissing,
or Thomas Hardy, had had Kipling's opportunities. That is the kind
of accident that cannot happen. It was not possible that
nineteenth-century England should produce a book like <i>War And
Peace</i>, or like Tolstoy's minor stories of army life, such as
<i>Sebastopol</i> or <i>The Cossacks</i>, not because the talent
was necessarily lacking but because no one with sufficient
sensitiveness to write such books would ever have made the
appropriate contacts. Tolstoy lived in a great military empire in
which it seemed natural for almost any young man of family to spend
a few years in the army, whereas the British Empire was and still
is demilitarized to a degree which continental observers find
almost incredible. Civilized men do not readily move away from the
centres of civilization, and in most languages there is a great
dearth of what one might call colonial literature. It took a very
improbable combination of circumstances to produce Kipling's gaudy
tableau, in which Private Ortheris and Mrs. Hauksbee pose against a
background of palm trees to the sound of temple bells, and one
necessary circumstance was that Kipling himself was only half
civilized.</p>

<p>[Note: Published in a volume of Collected Essays, <i>The Wound
and the Bow</i>. Author's footnote 1945]</p>

<p>Kipling is the only English writer of our time who has added
phrases to the language. The phrases and neologisms which we take
over and use without remembering their origin do not always come
from writers we admire. It is strange, for instance, to hear the
Nazi broadcasters referring to the Russian soldiers as 'robots',
thus unconsciously borrowing a word from a Czech democrat whom they
would have killed if they could have laid hands on him. Here are
half a dozen phrases coined by Kipling which one sees quoted in
leaderettes in the gutter press or overhears in saloon bars from
people who have barely heard his name. It will be seen that they
all have a certain characteristic in common:</p>

<pre>
East is East, and West is West.
The white man's burden.
What do they know of England who only England know?
The female of the species is more deadly than the male.
Somewhere East of Suez.
Paying the Dane-geld.
</pre>

<p>There are various others, including some that have outlived
their context by many years. The phrase 'killing Kruger with your
mouth', for instance, was current till very recently. It is also
possible that it was Kipling who first let loose the use of the
word 'Huns' for Germans; at any rate he began using it as soon as
the guns opened fire in 1914. But what the phrases I have listed
above have in common is that they are all of them phrases which one
utters semi-derisively (as it might be 'For I'm to be Queen o' the
May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May'), but which one is bound
to make use of sooner or later. Nothing could exceed the contempt
of the <i>New Statesman</i>, for instance, for Kipling, but how
many times during the Munich period did the <i>New Statesman</i>
find itself quoting that phrase about paying the Dane-geld? [Note,
below.] The fact is that Kipling, apart from his snack-bar wisdom
and his gift for packing much cheap picturesqueness into a few
words ('palm and pine'&mdash;'east of Suez'&mdash;'the road to
Mandalay'), is generally talking about things that are of urgent
interest. It does not matter, from this point of view, that
thinking and decent people generally find themselves on the other
side of the fence from him. 'White man's burden' instantly conjures
up a real problem, even if one feels that it ought to be altered to
'black man's burden'. One may disagree to the middle of one's bones
with the political attitude implied in 'The Islanders', but one
cannot say that it is a frivolous attitude. Kipling deals in
thoughts which are both vulgar and permanent. This raises the
question of his special status as a poet, or verse-writer.</p>

<p>[Note: On the first page of his recent book, <i>Adam and
Eve</i>, Mr. Middleton Murry quotes the well-known lines:</p>

<pre>
There are nine and sixty ways
Of constructing tribal lays,
And every single one of them is right.
</pre>

<p>He attributes these lines to Thackeray. This is probably what is
known as a 'Freudian error.' A civilized person would prefer not to
quote Kipling&mdash;i.e. would prefer not to feel that it was
Kipling who had expressed his thought for him. (Author's footnote
1945.)]</p>

<p>Mr. Eliot describes Kipling's metrical work as 'verse' and not
'poetry', but adds that it is '<i>great</i> verse', and further
qualifies this by saying that a writer can only be described as a
'great verse-writer' if there is some of his work 'of which we
cannot say whether it is verse or poetry'. Apparently Kipling was a
versifier who occasionally wrote poems, in which case it was a pity
that Mr. Eliot did not specify these poems by name. The trouble is
that whenever an aesthetic judgement on Kipling's work seems to be
called for, Mr. Eliot is too much on the defensive to be able to
speak plainly. What he does not say, and what I think one ought to
start by saying in any discussion of Kipling, is that most of
Kipling's verse is so horribly vulgar that it gives one the same
sensation as one gets from watching a third-rate music-hall
performer recite 'The Pigtail of Wu Fang Fu' with the purple
limelight on his face, and yet there is much of it that is capable
of giving pleasure to people who know what poetry means. At his
worst, and also his most vital, in poems like 'Gunga Din' or 'Danny
Deever', Kipling is almost a shameful pleasure, like the taste for
cheap sweets that some people secretly carry into middle life. But
even with his best passages one has the same sense of being seduced
by something spurious, and yet unquestionably seduced. Unless one
is merely a snob and a liar it is impossible to say that no one who
cares for poetry could get any pleasure out of such lines as:</p>

<pre>
For the wind is in the palm trees, and the temple bells they say,
'Come you back, you British soldier, come you back to Mandalay!'
</pre>

<p>and yet those lines are not poetry in the same sense as 'Felix
Randal' or 'When icicles hang by the wall' are poetry. One can,
perhaps, place Kipling more satisfactorily than by juggling with
the words 'verse' and 'poetry', if one describes him simply as a
good bad poet. He is as a poet what Harriet Beecher Stowe was as a
novelist. And the mere existence of work of this kind, which is
perceived by generation after generation to be vulgar and yet goes
on being read, tells one something about the age we live in.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of good bad poetry in English, all of it,
I should say, subsequent to 1790. Examples of good bad
poems&mdash;I am deliberately choosing diverse ones&mdash;are 'The
Bridge of Sighs', 'When all the world is young, lad', 'The Charge
of the Light Brigade', Bret Harte's 'Dickens in Camp', 'The Burial
of Sir John Moore', 'Jenny Kissed Me', 'Keith of Ravelston',
'Casabianca'. All of these reek of sentimentality, and
yet&mdash;not these particular poems, perhaps, but poems of this
kind, are capable of giving true pleasure to people who can see
clearly what is wrong with them. One could fill a fair-sized
anthology with good bad poems, if it were not for the significant
fact that good bad poetry is usually too well known to be worth
reprinting.</p>

<p>It is no use pretending that in an age like our own, 'good'
poetry can have any genuine popularity. It is, and must be, the
cult of a very few people, the least tolerated of the arts. Perhaps
that statement needs a certain amount of qualification. True poetry
can sometimes be acceptable to the mass of the people when it
disguises itself as something else. One can see an example of this
in the folk-poetry that England still possesses, certain nursery
rhymes and mnemonic rhymes, for instance, and the songs that
soldiers make up, including the words that go to some of the
bugle-calls. But in general ours is a civilization in which the
very word 'poetry' evokes a hostile snigger or, at best, the sort
of frozen disgust that most people feel when they hear the word
'God'. If you are good at playing the concertina you could probably
go into the nearest public bar and get yourself an appreciative
audience within five minutes. But what would be the attitude of
that same audience if you suggested reading them Shakespeare's
sonnets, for instance? Good bad poetry, however, can get across to
the most unpromising audiences if the right atmosphere has been
worked up beforehand. Some months back Churchill produced a great
effect by quoting Clough's 'Endeavour' in one of his broadcast
speeches. I listened to this speech among people who could
certainly not be accused of caring for poetry, and I am convinced
that the lapse into verse impressed them and did not embarrass
them. But not even Churchill could have got away with it if he had
quoted anything much better than this.</p>

<p>In so far as a writer of verse can be popular, Kipling has been
and probably still is popular. In his own lifetime some of his
poems travelled far beyond the bounds of the reading public, beyond
the world of school prize-days, Boy Scout sing-songs, limp-leather
editions, poker-work and calendars, and out into the yet vaster
world of the music halls. Nevertheless, Mr. Eliot thinks it worth
while to edit him, thus confessing to a taste which others share
but are not always honest enough to mention. The fact that such a
thing as good bad poetry can exist is a sign of the emotional
overlap between the intellectual and the ordinary man. The
intellectual is different from the ordinary man, but only in
certain sections of his personality, and even then not all the
time. But what is the peculiarity of a good bad poem? A good bad
poem is a graceful monument to the obvious. It records in memorable
form&mdash;for verse is a mnemonic device, among other
things&mdash;some emotion which very nearly every human being can
share. The merit of a poem like 'When all the world is young, lad'
is that, however sentimental it may be, its sentiment is 'true'
sentiment in the sense that you are bound to find yourself thinking
the thought it expresses sooner or later; and then, if you happen
to know the poem, it will come back into your mind and seem better
than it did before. Such poems are a kind of rhyming proverb, and
it is a fact that definitely popular poetry is usually gnomic or
sententious. One example from Kipling will do:</p>

<pre>
White hands cling to the bridle rein,
Slipping the spur from the booted heel;
Tenderest voices cry 'Turn again!'
Red lips tarnish the scabbarded steel:
Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne,
He travels the fastest who travels alone.
</pre>

<p>There is a vulgar thought vigorously expressed. It may not be
true, but at any rate it is a thought that everyone thinks. Sooner
or later you will have occasion to feel that he travels the fastest
who travels alone, and there the thought is, ready made and, as it
were, waiting for you. So the chances are that, having once heard
this line, you will remember it.</p>

<p>One reason for Kipling's power as a good bad poet I have already
suggested&mdash;his sense of responsibility, which made it possible
for him to have a world-view, even though it happened to be a false
one. Although he had no direct connexion with any political party,
Kipling was a Conservative, a thing that does not exist nowadays.
Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals,
Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists. He identified himself with
the ruling power and not with the opposition. In a gifted writer
this seems to us strange and even disgusting, but it did have the
advantage of giving Kipling a certain grip on reality. The ruling
power is always faced with the question, 'In such and such
circumstances, what would you <i>do</i>?', whereas the opposition
is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions.
Where it is a permanent and pensioned opposition, as in England,
the quality of its thought deteriorates accordingly. Moreover,
anyone who starts out with a pessimistic, reactionary view of life
tends to be justified by events, for Utopia never arrives and 'the
gods of the copybook headings', as Kipling himself put it, always
return. Kipling sold out to the British governing class, not
financially but emotionally. This warped his political judgement,
for the British ruling class were not what he imagined, and it led
him into abysses of folly and snobbery, but he gained a
corresponding advantage from having at least tried to imagine what
action and responsibility are like. It is a great thing in his
favour that he is not witty, not 'daring', has no wish to <i>épater
les bourgeois</i>. He dealt largely in platitudes, and since we
live in a world of platitudes, much of what he said sticks. Even
his worst follies seem less shallow and less irritating than the
'enlightened' utterances of the same period, such as Wilde's
epigrams or the collection of cracker-mottoes at the end of <i>Man
and Superman</i>.</p>

<h2>MARK TWAIN&mdash;THE LICENSED JESTER (1943)</h2>

<p>Mark Twain has crashed the lofty gates of the Everyman library,
but only with <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>,
already fairly well known under the guise of 'children's books'
(which they are not). His best and most characteristic books,
<i>Roughing It, The Innocents at Home,</i> and even <i>Life on the
Mississippi</i>, are little remembered in this country, though no
doubt in America the patriotism which is everywhere mixed up with
literary judgement keeps them alive.</p>

<p>Although Mark Twain produced a surprising variety of books,
ranging from a namby-pamby 'life' of Joan of Arc to a pamphlet so
obscene that it has never been publicly printed, all that is best
in his work centres about the Mississippi river and the wild mining
towns of the West. Born in 1835 (he came of a Southern family, a
family just rich enough to own one or perhaps two slaves), he had
had his youth and early manhood in the golden age of America, the
period when the great plains were opened up, when wealth and
opportunity seemed limitless, and human beings felt free, indeed
were free, as they had never been before and may not be again for
centuries. <i>Life On The Mississippi</i> and the two other books
that I have mentioned are a ragbag of anecdotes, scenic
descriptions and social history both serious and burlesque, but
they have a central theme which could perhaps be put into these
words: 'This is how human beings behave when they are not
frightened of the sack.' In writing these books Mark Twain is not
consciously writing a hymn to liberty. Primarily he is interested
in 'character', in the fantastic, almost lunatic variations which
human nature is capable of when economic pressure and tradition are
both removed from it. The raftsmen, Mississippi pilots, miners and
bandits whom he describes are probably not much exaggerated, but
they are as different from modern men, and from one another, as the
gargoyles of a medieval cathedral. They could develop their strange
and sometimes sinister individuality because of the lack of any
outside pressure. The State hardly existed, the churches were weak
and spoke with many voices, and land was to be had for the taking.
If you disliked your job you simply hit the boss in the eye and
moved further west; and moreover, money was so plentiful that the
smallest coin in circulation was worth a shilling. The American
pioneers were not supermen, and they were not especially
courageous. Whole towns of hardy gold miners let themselves be
terrorized by bandits whom they lacked the public spirit to put
down. They were not even free from class distinctions. The
desperado who stalked through the streets of the mining settlement,
with a Derringer pistol in his waistcoat pocket and twenty corpses
to his credit, was dressed in a frock coat and shiny top-hat,
described himself firmly as a 'gentleman' and was meticulous about
table manners. But at least it was <i>not</i> the case that a man's
destiny was settled from his birth. The 'log cabin to White House'
myth was true while the free land lasted. In a way, it was for this
that the Paris mob had stormed the Bastille, and when one reads
Mark Twain, Bret Harte and Whitman it is hard to feel that their
effort was wasted.</p>

<p>However, Mark Twain aimed at being something more than a
chronicler of the Mississippi and the Gold Rush. In his own day he
was famous all over the world as a humorist and comic lecturer. In
New York, London, Berlin, Vienna, Melbourne and Calcutta vast
audiences rocked with laughter over jokes which have now, almost
without exception, ceased to be funny. (It is worth noticing that
Mark Twain's lectures were only a success with Anglo-Saxon and
German audiences. The relatively grown-up Latin races&mdash;whose
own humour, he complained, always centred round sex and
politics&mdash;never cared for them.) But in addition, Mark Twain
had some pretensions to being a social critic, even a species of
philosopher. He had in him an iconoclastic, even revolutionary vein
which he obviously wanted to follow up and yet somehow never did
follow up. He might have been a destroyer of humbugs and a prophet
of democracy more valuable than Whitman, because healthier and more
humorous. Instead he became that dubious thing a 'public figure',
flattered by passport officials and entertained by royalty, and his
career reflects the deterioration in American life that set in
after the Civil War.</p>

<p>Mark Twain has sometimes been compared with his contemporary,
Anatole France. This comparison is not so pointless as it may
sound. Both men were the spiritual children of Voltaire, both had
an ironical, sceptical view of life, and a native pessimism
overlaid by gaiety; both knew that the existing social order is a
swindle and its cherished beliefs mostly delusions. Both were
bigoted atheists and convinced (in Mark Twain's case this was
Darwin's doing) of the unbearable cruelty of the universe. But
there the resemblance ends. Not only is the Frenchman enormously
more learned, more civilized, more alive aesthetically, but he is
also more courageous. He does attack the things he disbelieves in;
he does not, like Mark swain, always take refuge behind the amiable
mask of the 'public figure' and the licensed jester. He is ready to
risk the anger of the Church and to take the unpopular side in a
controversy&mdash;in the Dreyfus case, for example. Mark Twain,
except perhaps in one short essay 'What is Man?', never attacks
established beliefs in a way that is likely to get him into
trouble. Nor could he ever wean himself from the notion, which is
perhaps especially an American notion, that success and virtue are
the same thing.</p>

<p>In <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> there is a queer little
illustration of the central weakness of Mark Twain's character. In
the earlier part of this mainly autobiographical book the dates
have been altered. Mark Twain describes his adventures as a
Mississippi pilot as though he had been a boy of about seventeen at
the time, whereas in fact he was a young man of nearly thirty.
There is a reason for this. The same part of the book describes his
exploits in the Civil War, which were distinctly inglorious.
Moreover, Mark Twain started by fighting, if he can be said to have
fought, on the Southern side, and then changed his allegiance
before the war was over. This kind of behaviour is more excusable
in a boy than in a man, whence the adjustment of the dates. It is
also clear enough, however, that he changed sides because he saw
that the North was going to win; and this tendency to side with the
stronger whenever possible, to believe that might must be right, is
apparent throughout his career. In <i>Roughing It</i> there is an
interesting account of a bandit named Slade, who, among countless
other outrages, had committed twenty-eight murders. It is perfectly
clear that Mark Twain admires this disgusting scoundrel. Slade was
successful; therefore he was admirable. This outlook, no less
common today, is summed up in the significant American expression
'to <i>Make Good.</i>'</p>

<p>In the money-grubbing period that followed the Civil War it was
hard for anyone of Mark Twain's temperament to refuse to be a
success. The old, simple, stump-whittling, tobacco-chewing
democracy which Abraham Lincoln typified was perishing: it was now
the age of cheap immigrant labour and the growth of Big Business.
Mark Twain mildly satirized his contemporaries in The <i>Gilded
Age</i>, but he also gave himself up to the prevailing fever, and
made and lost vast sums of money. He even for a period of years
deserted writing for business; and he squandered his time on
buffooneries, not merely lecture tours and public banquets, but,
for instance, the writing of a book like <i>A Connecticut Yankee in
King Arthur's Court</i>, which is a deliberate flattery of all that
is worst and most vulgar in American life. The man who might have
been a kind of rustic Voltaire became the world's leading
after-dinner speaker, charming alike for his anecdotes and his
power to make businessmen feel themselves public benefactors.</p>

<p>It is usual to blame Mark Twain's wife for his failure to write
the books he ought to have written, and it is evident that she did
tyrannize over him pretty thoroughly. Each morning, Mark Twain
would show her what he had written the day before, and Mrs. Clemens
(Mark Twain's real name was Samuel Clemens) would go over it with
the blue pencil, cutting out everything that she thought
unsuitable. She seems to have been a drastic blue-penciller even by
nineteenth-century standards. There is an account in W.D. Howells's
book <i>My Mark Twain</i> of the fuss that occurred over a terrible
expletive that had crept into <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>. Mark Twain
appealed to Howells, who admitted that it was 'just what Huck would
have said', but agreed with Mrs. Clemens that the word could not
possibly be printed. The word was 'hell'. Nevertheless, no writer
is really the intellectual slave of his wife. Mrs. Clemens could
not have stopped Mark Twain writing any book he really wanted to
write. She may have made his surrender to society easier, but the
surrender happened because of that flaw in his own nature, his
inability to despise success.</p>

<p>Several of Mark Twain's books are bound to survive, because they
contain invaluable social history. His life covered the great
period of American expansion. When he was a child it was a normal
day's outing to go with a picnic lunch and watch the hanging of an
Abolitionist, and when he died the aeroplane was ceasing to be a
novelty. This period in America produced relatively little
literature, and but for Mark Twain our picture of a Mississippi
paddle-steamer, or a stage-coach crossing the plains, would be much
dimmer than it is. But most people who have studied his work have
come away with a feeling that he might have done something more. He
gives all the while a strange impression of being about to say
something and then funking it, so that <i>Life on the
Mississippi</i> and the rest of them seem to be haunted by the
ghost of a greater and much more coherent book. Significantly, he
starts his autobiography by remarking that a man's inner life is
indescribable. We do not know what he would have said&mdash;it is
just possible that the unprocurable pamphlet, 1601, would supply a
clue but we may guess that it would have wrecked his reputation and
reduced his income to reasonable proportions.</p>

<h2>POETRY AND THE MICROPHONE (1943)</h2>

<p>About a year ago I and a number of others were engaged in
broadcasting literary programmes to India, and among other things
we broadcast a good deal of verse by contemporary and
near-contemporary English writers&mdash;for example, Eliot, Herbert
Read, Auden, Spender, Dylan Thomas, Henry Treece, Alex Comfort,
Robert Bridges, Edmund Blunden, D.H. Lawrence. Whenever it was
possible we had poems broadcast by the people who wrote them. Just
why these particular programmes (a small and remote out-flanking
movement in the radio war) were instituted there is no need to
explain here, but I should add that the fact that we were
broadcasting to an Indian audience dictated our technique to some
extent. The essential point was that our literary broadcasts were
aimed at the Indian university students, a small and hostile
audience, unapproachable by anything that could be described as
British propaganda. It was known in advance that we could not hope
for more than a few thousand listeners at the most, and this gave
us an excuse to be more "highbrow" than is generally possible on
the air.</p>

<p>If you are broadcasting poetry to people who know your language
but don't share your cultural background, a certain amount of
comment and explanation is unavoidable, and the formula we usually
followed was to broadcast what purported to be a monthly literary
magazine. The editorial staff were supposedly sitting in their
office, discussing what to put into the next number. Somebody
suggested one poem, someone else suggested another, there was a
short discussion and then came the poem itself, read in a different
voice, preferably the author's own. This poem naturally called up
another, and so the programme continued, usually with at least half
a minute of discussion between any two items. For a half-hour
programme, six voices seemed to be the best number. A programme of
this sort was necessarily somewhat shapeless, but it could be given
a certain appearance of unity by making it revolve round a single
central theme. For example, one number of our imaginary magazine
was devoted to the subject of war. It included two poems by Edmund
Blunden, Auden's "September 1941 ", extracts from a long poem by
G.S. Fraser ("A Letter to Anne Ridler"), Byron's "Isles of Greece"
and an extract from T.E. Lawrence's <i>Revolt in the Desert</i>.
These half-dozen items, with the arguments that preceded and
followed them, covered reasonably well the possible attitudes
towards war. The poems and the prose extract took about twenty
minutes to broadcast, the arguments about eight minutes.</p>

<p>This formula may seem slightly ridiculous and also rather
patronising, but its advantage is that the element of mere
instruction, the textbook motif, which is quite unavoidable if one
is going to broadcast serious and sometimes "difficult" verse,
becomes a lot less forbidding when it appears as an informal
discussion. The various speakers can ostensibly say to one another
what they are in reality saying to the audience. Also, by such an
approach you at least give a poem a context, which is just what
poetry lacks from the average man's point of view. But of course
there are other methods. One which we frequently used was to set a
poem in music. It is announced that in a few minutes' time such and
such a poem will be broadcast; then the music plays for perhaps a
minute, then fades out into the poem, which follows without any
title or announcement, then the music is faded again and plays up
for another minute or two&mdash;the whole thing taking perhaps five
minutes. It is necessary to choose appropriate music, but needless
to say, the real purpose of the music is to insulate the poem from
the rest of the programme. By this method you can have, say, a
Shakespeare sonnet within three minutes of a news bulletin without,
at any rate to my ear, any gross incongruity.</p>

<p>These programmes that I have been speaking of were of no great
value in themselves, but I have mentioned them because of the ideas
they aroused in myself and some others about the possibilities of
the radio as a means of popularising poetry. I was early struck by
the fact that the broadcasting of a poem by the person who wrote it
does not merely produce an effect upon the audience, if any, but
also on the poet himself. One must remember that extremely little
in the way of broadcasting poetry has been done in England, and
that many people who write verse have never even considered the
idea of reading it aloud. By being set down at a microphone,
especially if this happens at all regularly, the poet is brought
into a new relationship with his work, not otherwise attainable in
our time and country. It is a commonplace that in modern
times&mdash;the last two hundred years, say&mdash;poetry has come
to have less and less connection either with music or with the
spoken word. It needs print in order to exist at all, and it is no
more expected that a poet, as such, will know how to sing or even
to declaim than it is expected that an architect will know how to
plaster a ceiling. Lyrical and rhetorical poetry have almost ceased
to be written, and a hostility towards poetry on the part of the
common man has come to be taken for granted in any country where
everyone can read. And where such a breach exists it is always
inclined to widen, because the concept of poetry as primarily
something printed, and something intelligible only to a minority,
encourages obscurity and "cleverness". How many people do not feel
quasi-instinctively that there must be something wrong with any
poem whose meaning can be taken in at a single glance? It seems
unlikely that these tendencies will be checked unless it again
becomes normal to read verse aloud, and it is difficult to see how
this can be brought about except by using the radio as a medium.
But the special advantage of the radio, its power to select the
right audience, and to do away with stage-fright and embarrassment,
ought here to be noticed.</p>

<p>In broadcasting your audience is conjectural, but it is an
audience of <i>one</i>. Millions may be listening, but each is
listening alone, or as a member of a small group, and each has (or
ought to have) the feeling that you are speaking to him
individually. More than this, it is reasonable to assume that your
audience is sympathetic, or at least interested, for anyone who is
bored can promptly switch you off by turning a knob. But though
presumably sympathetic, the audience <i>has no power over you</i>.
It is just here that a broadcast differs from a speech or a
lecture. On the platform, as anyone used to public speaking knows,
it is almost impossible not to take your tone from the audience. It
is always obvious within a few minutes what they will respond to
and what they will not, and in practice you are almost compelled to
speak for the benefit of what you estimate as the stupidest person
present, and also to ingratiate yourself by means of the ballyhoo
known as "personality". If you don't do so, the result is always an
atmosphere of frigid embarrassment. That grisly thing, a "poetry
reading", is what it is because there will always be some among the
audience who are bored or all but frankly hostile and who can't
remove themselves by the simple act of turning a knob. And it is at
bottom the same difficulty&mdash;the fact that a theatre audience
is not a selected one&mdash;that makes it impossible to get a
decent performance of Shakespeare in England. On the air these
conditions do not exist. The poet <i>feels</i> that he is
addressing people to whom poetry means something, and it is a fact
that poets who are used to broadcasting can read into the
microphone with a virtuosity they would not equal if they had a
visible audience in front of them. The element of make-believe that
enters here does not greatly matter. The point is that in the only
way now possible the poet has been brought into a situation in
which reading verse aloud seems a natural unembarrassing thing, a
normal exchange between man and man: also he has been led to think
of his work as <i>sound</i> rather than as a pattern on paper. By
that much the reconciliation between poetry and the common man is
nearer. It already exists at the poet's end of the aether-waves,
whatever may be happening at the other end.</p>

<p>However, what is happening at the other end cannot be
disregarded. It will be seen that I have been speaking as though
the whole subject of poetry were embarrassing, almost indecent, as
though popularising poetry were essentially a strategic manoeuvre,
like getting a dose of medicine down a child's throat or
establishing tolerance for a persecuted sect. But unfortunately
that or something like it is the case. There can be no doubt that
in our civilisation poetry is by far the most discredited of the
arts, the only art, indeed, in which the average man refuses to
discern any value. Arnold Bennett was hardly exaggerating when he
said that in the English-speaking countries the word "poetry" would
disperse a crowd quicker than a fire-hose. And as I have pointed
out, a breach of this kind tends to widen simply because of its
existence, the common man becoming more and more anti-poetry, the
poet more and more arrogant and unintelligible, until the divorce
between poetry and popular culture is accepted as a sort of law of
nature, although in fact it belongs only to our own time and to a
comparatively small area of the earth. We live in an age in which
the average human being in the highly civilised countries is
aesthetically inferior to the lowest savage. This state of affairs
is generally looked upon as being incurable by any <i>conscious</i>
act, and on the other hand is expected to right itself of its own
accord as soon as society takes a comelier shape. With slight
variations the Marxist, the Anarchist and the religious believer
will all tell you this, and in broad terms it is undoubtedly true.
The ugliness amid which we live has spiritual and economic causes
and is not to be explained by the mere going-astray of tradition at
some point or other. But it does not follow that no improvement is
possible within our present framework, nor that an aesthetic
improvement is not a necessary part of the general redemption of
society. It is worth stopping to wonder, therefore, whether it
would not be possible even now to rescue poetry from its special
position as the most hated of the arts and win for it at least the
same degree of toleration as exists for music. But one has to start
by asking, in what way and to what extent is poetry unpopular?</p>

<p>On the face of it, the unpopularity of poetry is as complete as
it could be. But on second thoughts, this has to be qualified in a
rather peculiar way. To begin with, there is still an appreciable
amount of folk poetry (nursery rhymes etc) which is universally
known and quoted and forms part of the background of everyone's
mind. There is also a handful of ancient songs and ballads which
have never gone out of favour. In addition there is the popularity,
or at least the toleration, of "good bad" poetry, generally of a
patriotic or sentimental kind. This might seem beside the point if
it were not that "good bad" poetry has all the characteristics
which, ostensibly, make the average man dislike true poetry. It is
in verse, it rhymes, it deals in lofty sentiments and unusual
language&mdash;all this to a very marked degree, for it is almost
axiomatic that bad poetry is more "poetical" than good poetry. Yet
if not actively liked it is at least tolerated. For example, just
before writing this I have been listening to a couple of BBC
comedians doing their usual turn before the 9 o'clock news. In the
last three minutes one of the two comedians suddenly announces that
he "wants to be serious for a moment" and proceeds to recite a
piece of patriotic balderdash entitled "A Fine Old English
Gentleman", in praise of His Majesty the King. Now, what is the
reaction of the audience to this sudden lapse into the worst sort
of rhyming heroics? It cannot be very violently negative, or there
would be a sufficient volume of indignant letters to stop the BBC
doing this kind of thing. One must conclude that though the big
public is hostile to <i>poetry</i>, it is not strongly hostile to
<i>verse</i>. After all, if rhyme and metre were disliked for their
own sakes, neither songs nor dirty limericks could be popular.
Poetry is disliked because it is associated with untelligibility,
intellectual pretentiousness and a general feeling of
Sunday-on-a-weekday. Its name creates in advance the same sort of
bad impression as the word "God", or a parson's dog-collar. To a
certain extent, popularising poetry is a question of breaking down
an acquired inhibition. It is a question of getting people to
listen instead of uttering a mechanical raspberry. If true poetry
could be introduced to the big public in such a way as to make it
seem <i>normal</i>, as that piece of rubbish I have just listened
to presumably seemed normal, then part of the prejudice against it
might be overcome.</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe that poetry can ever be popularised
again without some deliberate effort at the education of public
taste, involving strategy and perhaps even subterfuge. T.S. Eliot
once suggested that poetry, particularly dramatic poetry, might be
brought back into the consciousness of ordinary people through the
medium of the music hall; he might have added the pantomime, whose
vast possibilities do not seem ever to have been completely
explored. "Sweeney Agonistes" was perhaps written with some such
idea in mind, and it would in fact be conceivable as a music-hall
turn, or at least as a scene in a revue. I have suggested the radio
as a more hopeful medium, and I have pointed out its technical
advantages, particularly from the point of view of the poet. The
reason why such a suggestion sounds hopeless at first hearing is
that few people are able to imagine the radio being used for the
dissemination of anything except tripe. People listen to the stuff
that does actually dribble from the loud-speakers of the world, and
conclude that it is for that and nothing else that the wireless
exists. Indeed the very word "wireless" calls up a picture either
of roaring dictators or of genteel throaty voices announcing that
three of our aircraft have failed to return. Poetry on the air
sounds like the Muses in striped trousers. Nevertheless one ought
not to confuse the capabilities of an instrument with the use it is
actually put to. Broadcasting is what it is, not because there is
something inherently vulgar, silly and dishonest about the whole
apparatus of microphone and transmitter, but because all the
broadcasting that now happens all over the world is under the
control of governments or great monopoly companies which are
actively interested in maintaining the <i>status quo</i> and
therefore in preventing the common man from becoming too
intelligent. Something of the same kind has happened to the cinema,
which, like the radio, made its appearance during the monopoly
stage of capitalism and is fantastically expensive to operate. In
all the arts the tendency is similar. More and more the channels of
production are under the control of bureaucrats, whose aim is to
destroy the artist or at least to castrate him. This would be a
bleak outlook if it were not that the totalitarianisation which is
now going on, and must undoubtedly continue to go on, in every
country of the world, is mitigated by another process which it was
not easy to foresee even as short a time as five years ago.</p>

<p>This is, that the huge bureaucratic machines of which we are all
part are beginning to work creakily because of their mere size and
their constant growth. The tendency of the modern state is to wipe
out the freedom of the intellect, and yet at the same time every
state, especially under the pressure of war, finds itself more and
more in need of an intelligentsia to do its publicity for it. The
modern state needs, for example, pamphlet-writers, poster artists,
illustrators, broadcasters, lecturers, film producers, actors, song
composers, even painters and sculptors, not to mention
psychologists, sociologists, bio-chemists, mathematicians and what
not. The British Government started the present war with the more
or less openly declared intention of keeping the literary
intelligentsia out of it; yet after three years of war almost every
writer, however undesirable his political history or opinions, has
been sucked into the various Ministries or the BBC and even those
who enter the armed forces tend to find themselves after a while in
Public Relations or some other essentially literary job. The
Government has absorbed these people, unwillingly enough, because
it found itself unable to get on without them. The ideal, from the
official point of view, would have been to put all publicity into
the hands of "safe" people like A.P. Herbert or Ian Hay: but since
not enough of these were available, the existing intelligentsia had
to be utilised, and the tone and even to some extent the content of
official propaganda have been modified accordingly. No one
acquainted with the Government pamphlets, ABCA (The Army Bureau of
Current Affairs.) lectures, documentary films and broadcasts to
occupied countries which have been issued during the past two years
imagines that our rulers would sponsor this kind of thing if they
could help it. Only, the bigger the machine of government becomes,
the more loose ends and forgotten corners there are in it. This is
perhaps a small consolation, but it is not a despicable one. It
means that in countries where there is already a strong liberal
tradition, bureaucratic tyranny can perhaps never be complete. The
striped-trousered ones will rule, but so long as they are forced to
maintain an intelligentsia, the intelligentsia will have a certain
amount of autonomy. If the Government needs, for example,
documentary films, it must employ people specially interested in
the technique of the film, and it must allow them the necessary
minimum of freedom; consequently, films that are all wrong from the
bureaucratic point of view will always have a tendency to appear.
So also with painting, photography, script-writing, reportage,
lecturing and all the other arts and half-arts of which a complex
modern state has need.</p>

<p>The application of this to the radio is obvious. At present the
loudspeaker is the enemy of the creative writer, but this may not
necessarily remain true when the volume and scope of broadcasting
increase. As things are, although the BBC does keep up a feeble
show of interest in contemporary literature, it is harder to
capture five minutes on the air in which to broadcast a poem than
twelve hours in which to disseminate lying propaganda, tinned
music, stale jokes, faked "discussions" or what-have-you. But that
state of affairs may alter in the way I have indicated, and when
that time comes serious experiment in the broadcasting of verse,
with complete disregard for the various hostile influences which
prevent any such thing at present, would become possible. I don't
claim it as certain that such an experiment would have very great
results. The radio was bureaucratised so early in its career that
the relationship between broadcasting and literature has never been
thought out. It is not certain that the microphone is the
instrument by which poetry could be brought back to the common
people and it is not even certain that poetry would gain by being
more of a spoken and less of a written thing. But I do urge that
these possibilities exist, and that those who care for literature
might turn their minds more often to this much-despised medium,
whose powers for good have perhaps been obscured by the voices of
Professor Joad and Doctor Goebbels.</p>

<h2>W B YEATS (1943)</h2>

<p>One thing that Marxist criticism has not succeeded in doing is
to trace the connection between "tendency" and literary style. The
subject-matter and imagery of a book can be explained in
sociological terms, but its texture seemingly cannot. Yet some such
connection there must be. One knows, for instance, that a Socialist
would not write like Chesterton or a Tory imperialist like Bernard
Shaw, though <i>how</i> one knows it is not easy to say. In the
case of Yeats, there must be some kind of connection between his
wayward, even tortured style of writing and his rather sinister
vision of life. Mr Menon is chiefly concerned with the esoteric
philosophy underlying Yeats's work, but the quotations which are
scattered all through his interesting book serve to remind one how
artificial Yeats's manner of writing was. As a rule, this
artificiality is accepted as Irishism, or Yeats is even credited
with simplicity because he uses short words, but in fact one seldom
comes on six consecutive lines of his verse in which there is not
an archaism or an affected turn of speech. To take the nearest
example:</p>

<pre>
Grant me an old man's Frenzy,
My self must I remake
Till I am Timon and Lear
Or that William Blake
Who beat upon the wall
Till Truth obeyed his call.
</pre>

<p>The unnecessary "that" imports a feeling of affectation, and the
same tendency is present in all but Yeats's best passages. One is
seldom long away from a suspicion of "quaintness", something that
links up not only with the 'nineties, the Ivory Tower and the "calf
covers of pissed-on green", but also with Rackham's drawings,
Liberty art-fabrics and the <i>Peter Pan</i> never-never land, of
which, after all, "The Happy Townland" is merely a more appetising
example. This does not matter, because, on the whole, Yeats gets
away with it, and if his straining after effect is often
irritating, it can also produce phrases ("the chill, footless
years", "the mackerel-crowded seas") which suddenly overwhelm one
like a girl's face seen across a room. He is an exception to the
rule that poets do not use poetical language:</p>

<pre>
How many centuries spent
The sedentary soul
In toils of measurement
Beyond eagle or mole,
Beyond hearing or seeing,
Or Archimedes' guess,
To raise into being
That loveliness?
</pre>

<p>Here he does not flinch from a squashy vulgar word like
"loveliness" and after all it does not seriously spoil this
wonderful passage. But the same tendencies, together with a sort of
raggedness which is no doubt intentional, weaken his epigrams and
polemical poems. For instance (I am quoting from memory) the
epigram against the critics who damned <i>The Playboy of the
Western World</i>:</p>

<pre>
Once when midnight smote the air
Eunuchs ran through Hell and met
On every crowded street to stare
Upon great Juan riding by;
Even like these to rail and sweat,
Staring upon his sinewy thigh.
</pre>

<p>The power which Yeats has within himself gives him the analogy
ready made and produces the tremendous scorn of the last line, but
even in this short poem there are six or seven unnecessary words.
It would probably have been deadlier if it had been neater.</p>

<p>Mr Menon's book is incidentally a short biography of Yeats, but
he is above all interested in Yeats's philosophical "system", which
in his opinion supplies the subject-matter of more of Yeats's poems
than is generally recognised. This system is set forth
fragmentarily in various places, and at full length in <i>a
vision</i>, a privately printed book which I have never read but
which Mr Menon quotes from extensively. Yeats gave conflicting
accounts of its origin, and Mr Menon hints pretty broadly that the
"documents" on which it was ostensibly founded were imaginary.
Yeats's philosophical system, says Mr Menon, "was at the back of
his intellectual life almost from the beginning. His poetry is full
of it. Without it his later poetry becomes almost completely
unintelligible." As soon as we begin to read about the so-called
system we are in the middle of a hocus-pocus of Great Wheels,
gyres, cycles of the moon, reincarnation, disembodied spirits,
astrology and what not. Yeats hedges as to the literalness with
which he believed in all this, but he certainly dabbled in
spiritualism and astrology, and in earlier life had made
experiments in alchemy. Although almost buried under explanations,
very difficult to understand, about the phases of the moon, the
central idea of his philosophical system seems to be our old
friend, the cyclical universe, in which everything happens over and
over again. One has not, perhaps, the right to laugh at Yeats for
his mystical beliefs&mdash;for I believe it could be shown that
<i>some</i> degree of belief in magic is almost universal&mdash;but
neither ought one to write such things off as mere unimportant
eccentricities. It is Mr Menon's perception of this that gives his
book its deepest interest. "In the first flush of admiration and
enthusiasm," he says, "most people dismissed the fantastical
philosophy as the price we have to pay for a great and curious
intellect. One did not quite realise where he was heading. And
those who did, like Pound and perhaps Eliot, approved the stand
that he finally took. The first reaction to this did not come, as
one might have expected, from the politically-minded young English
poets. They were puzzled because a less rigid or artificial system
than that of <i>a vision</i> might not have produced the great
poetry of Yeats's last days." It might not, and yet Yeats's
philosophy has some very sinister implications, as Mr Menon points
out.</p>

<p>Translated into political terms, Yeats's tendency is Fascist.
Throughout most of his life, and long before Fascism was ever heard
of, he had had the outlook of those who reach Fascism by the
aristocratic route. He is a great hater of democracy, of the modern
world, science, machinery, the concept of progress&mdash;above all,
of the idea of human equality. Much of the imagery of his work is
feudal, and it is clear that he was not altogether free from
ordinary snobbishness. Later these tendencies took clearer shape
and led him to "the exultant acceptance of authoritarianism as the
only solution. Even violence and tyranny are not necessarily evil
because the people, knowing not evil and good, would become
perfectly acquiescent to tyranny...Everything must come from the
top. Nothing can come from the masses." Not much interested in
politics, and no doubt disgusted by his brief incursions into
public life, Yeats nevertheless makes political pronouncements. He
is too big a man to share the illusions of Liberalism, and as early
as 1920 he foretells in a justly famous passage ("The Second
Coming") the kind of world that we have actually moved into. But he
appears to welcome the coming age, which is to be "hierarchical,
masculine, harsh, surgical", and is influenced both by Ezra Pound
and by various Italian Fascist writers. He describes the new
civilisation which he hopes and believes will arrive: "an
aristocratic civilisation in its most completed form, every detail
of life hierarchical, every great man's door crowded at dawn by
petitioners, great wealth everywhere in a few men's hands, all
dependent upon a few, up to the Emperor himself, who is a God
dependent on a greater God, and everywhere, in Court, in the
family, an inequality made law." The innocence of this statement is
as interesting as its snobbishness. To begin with, in a single
phrase, "great wealth in a few men's hands", Yeats lays bare the
central reality of Fascism, which the whole of its propaganda is
designed to cover up. The merely political Fascist claims always to
be fighting for justice: Yeats, the poet, sees at a glance that
Fascism means injustice, and acclaims it for that very reason. But
at the same time he fails to see that the new authoritarian
civilisation, if it arrives, will not be aristocratic, or what he
means by aristocratic. It will not be ruled by noblemen with Van
Dyck faces, but by anonymous millionaires, shiny-bottomed
bureaucrats and murdering gangsters. Others who have made the same
mistake have afterwards changed their views and one ought not to
assume that Yeats, if he had lived longer, would necessarily have
followed his friend Pound, even in sympathy. But the tendency of
the passage I have quoted above is obvious, and its complete
throwing overboard of whatever good the past two thousand years
have achieved is a disquieting symptom.</p>

<p>How do Yeat's political ideas link up with his leaning towards
occultism? It is not clear at first glance why hatred of democracy
and a tendency to believe in crystal-gazing should go together. Mr
Menon only discusses this rather shortly, but it is possible to
make two guesses. To begin with, the theory that civilisation moves
in recurring cycles is one way out for people who hate the concept
of human equality. If it is true that "all this", or something like
it, "has happened before", then science and the modern world are
debunked at one stroke and progress becomes for ever impossible. It
does not much matter if the lower orders are getting above
themselves, for, after all, we shall soon be returning to an age of
tyranny. Yeats is by no means alone in this outlook. If the
universe is moving round on a wheel, the future must be
foreseeable, perhaps even in some detail. It is merely a question
of discovering the laws of its motion, as the early astronomers
discovered the solar year. Believe that, and it becomes difficult
not to believe in astrology or some similar system. A year before
the war, examining a copy of <i>Gringoire</i>, the French Fascist
weekly, much read by army officers, I found in it no less than
thirty-eight advertisements of clairvoyants. Secondly, the very
concept of occultism carries with it the idea that knowledge must
be a secret thing, limited to a small circle of initiates. But the
same idea is integral to Fascism. Those who dread the prospect of
universal suffrage, popular education, freedom of thought,
emancipation of women, will start off with a predilection towards
secret cults. There is another link between Fascism and magic in
the profound hostility of both to the Christian ethical code.</p>

<p>No doubt Yeats wavered in his beliefs and held at different
times many different opinions, some enlightened, some not. Mr Menon
repeats for him Eliot's claim that he had the longest period of
development of any poet who has ever lived. But there is one thing
that seems constant, at least in all of his work that I can
remember, and that is his hatred of modern western civilisation and
desire to return to the Bronze Age, or perhaps to the Middle Ages.
Like all such thinkers, he tends to write in praise of ignorance.
The Fool in his remarkable play, <i>The Hour-Glass</i>, is a
Chestertonian figure, "God's fool", the "natural born innocent",
who is always wiser than the wise man. The philosopher in the play
dies on the knowledge that all his lifetime of thought has been
wasted (I am quoting from memory again):</p>

<pre>
The stream of the world has changed its course,
And with the stream my thoughts have run
Into some cloudly, thunderous spring
That is its mountain-source;
Ay, to a frenzy of the mind,
That all that we have done's undone
Our speculation but as the wind.
</pre>

<p>Beautiful words, but by implication profoundly obscurantist and
reactionary; for if it is really true that a village idiot, as
such, is wiser than a philosopher, then it would be better if the
alphabet had never been invented. Of course, all praise of the past
is partly sentimental, because we do not live in the past. The poor
do not praise poverty. Before you can despise the machine, the
machine must set you free from brute labour. But that is not to say
that Yeats's yearning for a more primitive and more hierarchical
age was not sincere. How much of all this is traceable to mere
snobbishness, product of Yeats's own position as an impoverished
offshoot of the aristocracy, is a different question. And the
connection between his obscurantist opinions and his tendency
towards "quaintness" of language remains to be worked out; Mr Menon
hardly touches upon it.</p>

<p>This is a very short book, and I would greatly like to see Mr
Menon go ahead and write another book on Yeats, starting where this
one leaves off. "If the greatest poet of our times is exultantly
ringing in an era of Fascism, it seems a somewhat disturbing
symptom," he says on the last page, and leaves it at that. It is a
disturbing symptom, because it is not an isolated one. By and large
the best writers of our time have been reactionary in tendency, and
though Fascism does not offer any real return to the past, those
who yearn for the past will accept Fascism sooner than its probable
alternatives. But there are other lines of approach, as we have
seen during the past two or three years. The relationship between
Fascism and the literary intelligentsia badly needs investigating,
and Yeats might well be the starting-point. He is best studied by
someone like Mr Menon, who can approach a poet primarily as a poet,
but who also knows that a writer's political and religious beliefs
are not excrescences to be laughed away, but something that will
leave their mark even on the smallest detail of his work.</p>

<h2>ARTHUR KOESTLER (1944)</h2>

<p>One striking fact about English literature during the present
century is the extent to which it has been dominated by
foreigners&mdash;for example, Conrad, Henry James, Shaw, Joyce,
Yeats, Pound and Eliot. Still, if you chose to make this a matter
of national prestige and examine our achievement in the various
branches of literature, you would find that England made a fairly
good showing until you came to what may be roughly described as
political writing, or pamphleteering. I mean by this the special
class of literature that has arisen out of the European political
struggle since the rise of Fascism. Under this heading novels,
autobiographies, books of "reportage", sociological treatises and
plain pamphlets can all be lumped together, all of them having a
common origin and to a great extent the same emotional
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Some out of the outstanding figures in this school of writers
are Silone, Malraux, Salvemini, Borkenau, Victor Serge and Koestler
himself. Some of these are imaginative writers, some not, but they
are all alike in that they are trying to write contemporary
history, but <i>unofficial</i> history, the kind that is ignored in
the text-books and lied about in the newspapers. Also they are all
alike in being continental Europeans. It may be an exaggeration,
but it cannot be a very great one, to say that whenever a book
dealing with totalitarianism appears in this country, and still
seems worth reading six months after publication, it is a book
translated from some foreign language. English writers, over the
past dozen years, have poured forth an enormous spate of political
literature, but they have produced almost nothing of aesthetic
value, and very little of historical value either. The Left Book
Club, for instance, has been running ever since 1936. How many of
its chosen volumes can you even remember the names of? Nazi
Germany, Soviet Russia, Spain, Abyssinia, Austria,
Czechoslovakia&mdash;all that these and kindred subjects have
produced, in England, are slick books of reportage, dishonest
pamphlets in which propaganda is swallowed whole and then spewed up
again, half digested, and a very few reliable guide books and
text-books. There has been nothing resembling, for instance,
<i>Fontamara</i> or <i>Darkness At Noon</i>, because there is
almost no English writer to whom it has happened to see
totalitarianism from the inside. In Europe, during the past decade
and more, things have been happening to middle-class people which
in England do not even happen to the working class. Most of the
European writers I mentioned above, and scores of others like them,
have been obliged to break the law in order to engage in politics
at all; some of them have thrown bombs and fought in street
battles, many have been in prison or the concentration camp, or
fled across frontiers with false names and forged passports. One
cannot imagine, say, Professor Laski indulging in activities of
that kind. England is lacking, therefore, in what one might call
concentration-camp literature. The special world created by
secret-police forces, censorship of opinion, torture and frame-up
trials is, of course, known about and to some extent disapproved
of, but it has made very little emotional impact. One result of
this is that there exists in England almost no literature of
disillusionment about the Soviet Union. There is the attitude of
ignorant disapproval, and there is the attitude of uncritical
admiration, but very little in between. Opinion on the Moscow
sabotage trials, for instance, was divided, but divided chiefly on
the question of whether the accused were guilty. Few people were
able to see that, whether justified or not, the trials were an
unspeakable horror. And English disapproval of the Nazi outrages
has also been an unreal thing, turned on and off like a tap
according to political expediency. To understand such things one
has to be able to imagine oneself as the victim, and for an
Englishman to write Darkness at Noon would be as unlikely an
accident as for a slave-trader to write <i>Uncle Tom's
Cabin</i>.</p>

<p>Koestler's published work really centres about the Moscow
trials. His main theme is the decadence of revolutions owing to the
corrupting effects of power, but the special nature of the Stalin
dictatorship has driven him back into a position not far removed
from pessimistic Conservatism. I do not know how many books he has
written in all. He is a Hungarian whose earlier books were written
in German, and five books have been published in England:
<i>Spanish Testament, The Gladiators, Darkness at Noon, Scum of The
Earth,</i> and <i>Arrival and Departure.</i> The subject-matter of
all of them is similar, and none of them ever escapes for more than
a few pages from the atmosphere of nightmare. Of the five books,
the action of three takes place entirely or almost entirely in
prison.</p>

<p>In the opening months of the Spanish civil war Koestler was the
<i>News Chronicle's</i> correspondent in Spain, and early in 1937
he was taken prisoner when the Fascists captured Malaga. He was
nearly shot out of hand, then spent some months imprisoned in a
fortress, listening every night to the roar of rifle fire as batch
after batch of Republicans was executed, and being most of the time
in acute danger of execution himself. This was not a chance
adventure which "might have happened to anybody", but was in
accordance with Koestler's life-style. A politically indifferent
person would not have been in Spain at that date, a more cautious
observer would have got out of Malaga before the Fascists arrived,
and a British or American newspaper man would have been treated
with more consideration. The book that Koestler wrote about this,
<i>Spanish Testament</i>, has remarkable passages, but apart from
the scrappiness that is usual in a book of reportage, it is
definitely false in places. In the prison scenes Koestler
successfully establishes the nightmare atmosphere which is, so to
speak, his patent, but the rest of the book is too much coloured by
the Popular Front orthodoxy of the time. One or two passages even
look as though they had been doctored for the purposes of the Left
Book Club. At that time Koestler still was, or recently had been, a
member of the Communist Party, and the complex politics of the
civil war made it impossible for any Communist to write honestly
about the internal struggle on the Government side. The sin of
nearly all left-wingers from 1933 onwards is that they have wanted
to be anti-Fascist without being anti-totalitarian. In 1937
Koestler already knew this, but did not feel free to say so. He
came much nearer to saying it&mdash;indeed, he did say it, though
he put on a mask to do so&mdash;in his next book, <i>The
Gladiators</i>, which was published about a year before the war and
for some reason attracted very little attention.</p>

<p><i>The Gladiators</i> is in some ways an unsatisfactory book. It
is about Spartacus, the Thracian gladiator who raised a slaves'
rebellion in Italy round about 65 BC, and any book on such a
subject is handicapped by challenging comparison with
<i>Salammbô</i>. In our own age it would not be possible to write a
book like <i>Salammbô</i> even if one had the talent. The great
thing about <i>Salammbô</i>, even more important than its physical
detail, is its utter mercilessness. Flaubert could think himself
into the stony cruelty of antiquity, because in the mid-nineteenth
century one still had peace of mind. One had time to travel in the
past. Nowadays the present and the future are too terrifying to be
escaped from, and if one bothers with history it is in order to
find modern meanings there. Koestler makes Spartacus into an
allegorical figure, a primitive version of the proletarian
dictator. Whereas Flaubert has been able, by a prolonged effort of
the imagination, to make his mercenaries truly pre-Christian,
Spartacus is a modern man dressed up. But this might not matter if
Koestler were fully aware of what his allegory means. Revolutions
always go wrong&mdash;that is the main theme. It is on the question
of <i>why</i> they go wrong that he falters, and his uncertainty
enters into the story and makes the central figures enigmatic and
unreal.</p>

<p>For several years the rebellious slaves are uniformly
successful. Their numbers swell to a hundred thousand, they overrun
great areas of Southern Italy, they defeat one punitive expedition
after another, they ally themselves with the pirates who at that
time were the masters of the Mediterranean, and finally they set to
work to build a city of their own, to be named the City of the Sun.
In this city human beings are to be free and equal, and above all,
they are to be happy: no slavery, no hunger, no injustice, no
floggings, no executions. It is the dream of a just society which
seems to haunt the human imagination ineradicably and in all ages,
whether it is called the Kingdom of Heaven or the classless
society, or whether it is thought of as a Golden Age which once
existed in the past and from which we have degenerated. Needless to
say, the slaves fail to achieve it. No sooner have they formed
themselves into a community than their way of life turns out to be
as unjust, laborious and fear-ridden as any other. Even the cross,
symbol of slavery, has to be revived for the punishment of
malefactors. The turning-point comes when Spartacus finds himself
obliged to crucify twenty of his oldest and most faithful
followers. After that the City of the Sun is doomed, the slaves
split up and are defeated in detail, the last fifteen thousand of
them being captured and crucified in one batch.</p>

<p>The serious weakness of this story is that the motives of
Spartacus himself are never made clear. The Roman lawyer Fulvius,
who joins the rebellion and acts as its chronicler, sets forth the
familiar dilemma of ends and means. You can achieve nothing unless
you are willing to use force and cunning, but in using them you
pervert your original aims. Spartacus, however, is not represented
as power hungry, nor, on the other hand, as a visionary. He is
driven onwards by some obscure force which he does not understand,
and he is frequently in two minds as to whether it would not be
better to throw up the whole adventure and flee to Alexandria while
the going is good. The slaves' republic is in any case wrecked
rather by hedonism than by the struggle for power. The slaves are
discontented with their liberty because they still have to work,
and the final break-up happens because the more turbulent and less
civilised slaves, chiefly Gauls and Germans, continue to behave
like bandits after the republic has been established. This may be a
true account of events&mdash;naturally we know very little about
the slave rebellions of antiquity&mdash;but by allowing the Sun
City to be destroyed because Crixus the Gaul cannot be prevented
from looting and raping, Koestler has faltered between allegory and
history. If Spartacus is the prototype of the modern
revolutionary&mdash;and obviously he is intended as that&mdash;he
should have gone astray because of the impossibility of combining
power with righteousness. As it is, he is an almost passive figure,
acted upon rather than acting, and at times not convincing. The
story partly fails because the central problem of revolution has
been avoided or, at least, has not been solved.</p>

<p>It is again avoided in a subtler way in the next book,
Koestler's masterpiece, <i>Darkness at Noon</i>. Here, however, the
story is not spoiled, because it deals with individuals and its
interest is psychological. It is an episode picked out from a
background that does not have to be questioned. <i>Darkness at
Noon</i> describes the imprisonment and death of an Old Bolshevik,
Rubashov, who first denies and ultimately confesses to crimes which
he is well aware he has not committed. The grown-upness, the lack
of surprise or denunciation, the pity and irony with which the
story is told, show the advantage, when one is handling a theme of
this kind, of being a European. The book reaches the stature of
tragedy, whereas an English or American writer could at most have
made it into a polemical tract. Koestler has digested his material
and can treat it on the aesthetic level. At the same time his
handling of it has a political implication, not important in this
case but likely to be damaging in later books.</p>

<p>Naturally the whole book centres round one question: Why did
Rubashov confess? He is not guilty&mdash;that is, not guilty of
anything except the essential crime of disliking the Stalin régime.
The concrete acts of treason in which he is supposed to have
engaged are all imaginary. He has not even been tortured, or not
very severely. He is worn down by solitude, toothache, lack of
tobacco, bright lights glaring in his eyes, and continuous
questioning, but these in themselves would not be enough to
overcome a hardened revolutionary. The Nazis have previously done
worse to him without breaking his spirit. The confessions obtained
in the Russian state trials are capable of three explanations:</p>

<p>1. That the accused were guilty.</p>

<p>2. That they were tortured, and perhaps blackmailed by threats
to relatives and friends.</p>

<p>3. That they were actuated by despair, mental bankruptcy and the
habit of loyalty to the Party.</p>

<p>For Koestler's purpose in <i>Darkness At Noon</i>, 1 is ruled
out, and though this is not the place to discuss the Russian
purges, I must add that what little verifiable evidence there is
suggests that the trials of the Bolsheviks were frame-ups. If one
assumes that the accused were not guilty&mdash;at any rate, not
guilty of the particular things they confessed to&mdash;then 2 is
the common-sense explanation. Koestler, however, plumps for 3,
which is also accepted by the Trotskyist Boris Souvarine, in his
pamphlet <i>Cauchemar En Urss</i>. Rubashov ultimately confesses
because he cannot find in his own mind any reason for not doing so.
Justice and objective truth have long ceased to have any meaning
for him. For decades he has been simply the creature of the Party,
and what the Party now demands is that he shall confess to
non-existent crimes. In the end, though he had to be bullied and
weakened first, he is somewhat proud of his decision to confess. He
feels superior to the poor Czarist officer who inhabits the next
cell and who talks to Rubashov by tapping on the wall. The Czarist
officer is shocked when he learns that Rubashov intends to
capitulate. As he sees it from his "bourgeois" angle, everyone
ought to stick to his guns, even a Bolshevik. Honour, he says,
consists in doing what you think right. "Honour is to be useful
without fuss," Rubashov taps back; and he reflects with a certain
satisfaction that he is tapping with his pince-nez while the other,
the relic of the past, is tapping with a monocle. Like Bukharin,
Rubashov is "looking out upon black darkness". What is there, what
code, what loyalty, what notion of good and evil, for the sake of
which he can defy the Party and endure further torment? He is not
only alone, he is also hollow. He has himself committed worse
crimes than the one that is now being perpetrated against him. For
example, as a secret envoy of the Party in Nazi Germany, he has got
rid of disobedient followers by betraying them to the Gestapo.
Curiously enough, if he has any inner strength to draw upon, it is
the memories of his boyhood when he was the son of a landowner. The
last thing he remembers, when he is shot from behind, is the leaves
of poplar trees on his father's estate. Rubashov belongs to the
older generation of Bolsheviks that was largely wiped out in the
purges. He is aware of art and literature, and of the world outside
Russia. He contrasts sharply with Gletkin, the young GPU man who
conducts his interrogation, and who is the typical "good party
man", completely without scruples or curiosity, a thinking
gramophone. Rubashov, unlike Gletkin, does not have the Revolution
as his starting-point. His mind was not a blank sheet when the
Party got hold of it. His superiority to the other is finally
traceable to his bourgeois origin.</p>

<p>One cannot, I think, argue that <i>Darkness at Noon</i> is
simply a story dealing with the adventures of an imaginary
individual. Clearly it is a political book, founded on history and
offering an interpretation of disputed events. Rubashov might be
called Trotsky, Bukharin Rakovsky or some other relatively
civilised figure among the Old Bolsheviks. If one writes about the
Moscow trials one must answer the question, "Why did the accused
confess?" and which answer one makes is a political decision.
Koestler answers, in effect, "Because these people had been rotted
by the Revolution which they served", and in doing so he comes near
to claiming that revolutions are of their nature bad. If one
assumes that the accused in the Moscow trials were made to confess
by means of some kind of terrorism, one is only saying that one
particular set of revolutionary leaders has gone astray.
Individuals, and not the situation, are to blame. The implication
of Koestler's book, however, is that Rubashov in power would be no
better than Gletkin: or rather, only better in that his outlook is
still partly pre-revolutionary. Revolution, Koestler seems to say,
is a corrupting process. Really enter into the Revolution and you
must end up as either Rubashov or Gletkin. It is not merely that
"power corrupts": so also do the ways of attaining power.
Therefore, all efforts to regenerate society <i>by violent
means</i> lead to the cellars of the OGPU, Lenin leads to Stalin,
and would have come to resemble Stalin if he had happened to
survive.</p>

<p>Of course, Koestler does not say this quite explicitly, and
perhaps is not altogether conscious of it. He is writing about
darkness, but it is darkness at what ought to be noon. Part of the
time he feels that things might have turned out differently. The
notion that so-and-so has "betrayed", that things have only gone
wrong because of individual wickedness, is ever present in
left-wing thought. Later, in <i>Arrival and Departure</i>, Koestler
swings over much further towards the anti-revolutionary position,
but in between these two books there is another, <i>Scum of the
Earth</i>, which is straight autobiography and has only an indirect
bearing upon the problems raised by <i>Darkness at Noon</i>. True
to his life-style, Koestler was caught in France by the outbreak of
war and, as a foreigner and a known anti-Fascist, was promptly
arrested and interned by the Daladier Government. He spent the
first nine months of war mostly in a prison camp, then, during the
collapse of France, escaped and travelled by devious routes to
England, where he was once again thrown into prison as an enemy
alien. This time he was soon released, however. The book is a
valuable piece of reportage, and together with a few other scraps
of honest writing that happened to be produced at the time of the
déb&acirc;cle, it is a reminder of the depths that bourgeois
democracy can descend to. At this moment, with France newly
liberated and the witch-hunt after collaborators in full swing, we
are apt to forget that in 1940 various observers on the spot
considered that about forty per cent of the French population was
either actively pro-German or completely apathetic. Truthful war
books are never acceptable to non-combatants, and Koestler's book
did not have a very good reception. Nobody came well out of
it&mdash;neither the bourgeois politicians, whose idea of
conducting an anti-Fascist war was to jail every left-winger they
could lay their hands on, nor the French Communists, who were
effectively pro-Nazi and did their best to sabotage the French war
effort, nor the common people, who were just as likely to follow
mountebanks like Doriot as responsible leaders. Koestler records
some fantastic conversations with fellow victims in the
concentration camp, and adds that till then, like most middle-class
Socialists and Communists, he had never made contact with real
proletarians, only with the educated minority. He draws the
pessimistic conclusion: "Without education of the masses, no social
progress; without social progress, no education of the masses". In
<i>Scum of the Earth</i> Koestler ceases to idealise the common
people. He has abandoned Stalinism, but he is not a Trotskyist
either. This is the book's real link with <i>Arrival and
Departure</i>, in which what is normally called a revolutionary
outlook is dropped, perhaps for good.</p>

<p><i>Arrival and Departure</i> is not a satisfactory book. The
pretence that it is a novel is very thin; in effect it is a tract
purporting to show that revolutionary creeds are rationalisations
of neurotic impulses. With all too neat a symmetry, the book begins
and ends with the same action&mdash;a leap into a foreign country.
A young ex-Communist who has made his escape from Hungary jumps
ashore in Portugal, where he hopes to enter the service of Britain,
at that time the only power fighting against Germany. His
enthusiasm is somewhat cooled by the fact that the British
Consulate is uninterested in him and almost ignores him for a
period of several months, during which his money runs out and other
astuter refugees escape to America. He is successively tempted by
the World in the form of a Nazi propagandist, the Flesh in the form
of a French girl, and&mdash;after a nervous breakdown&mdash;the
Devil in the form of a psychoanalyst. The psychoanalyst drags out
of him the fact that his revolutionary enthusiasm is not founded on
any real belief in historical necessity, but on a morbid guilt
complex arising from an attempt in early childhood to blind his
baby brother. By the time that he gets an opportunity of serving
the Allies he has lost all reason for wanting to do so, and he is
on the point of leaving for America when his irrational impulses
seize hold of him again. In practice he cannot abandon the
struggle. When the book ends, he is floating down in a parachute
over the dark landscape of his native country, where he will be
employed as a secret agent of Britain.</p>

<p>As a political statement (and the book is not much more), this
is insufficient. Of course it is true in many cases, and it may be
true in all cases, that revolutionary activity is the result of
personal maladjustment. Those who struggle against society are, on
the whole, those who have reason to dislike it, and normal healthy
people are no more attracted by violence and illegality than they
are by war. The young Nazi in <i>Arrival and Departure</i> makes
the penetrating remark that one can see what is wrong with the
left-wing movement by the ugliness of its women. But after all,
this does not invalidate the Socialist case. Actions have results,
irrespective of their motives. Marx's ultimate motives may well
have been envy and spite, but this does not prove that his
conclusions were false. In making the hero of <i>Arrival and
Departure</i> take his final decision from a mere instinct not to
shirk action and danger, Koestler is making him suffer a sudden
loss of intelligence. With such a history as he has behind him, he
would be able to see that certain things have to be done, whether
our reasons for doing them are "good" or "bad". History has to move
in a certain direction, even if it has to be pushed that way by
neurotics. In <i>Arrival and Departure</i> Peter's idols are
overthrown one after the other. The Russian Revolution has
degenerated, Britain, symbolised by the aged consul with gouty
fingers, is no better, the international class-conscious
proletariat is a myth. But the conclusion (since, after all,
Koestler and his hero "support" the war) ought to be that getting
rid of Hitler is still a worth-while objective, a necessary bit of
scavenging in which motives are almost irrelevant.</p>

<p>To take a rational political decision one must have a picture of
the future. At present Koestler seems to have none, or rather to
have two which cancel out. As an ultimate objective he believes in
the Earthly Paradise, the Sun State which the gladiators set out to
establish, and which has haunted the imagination of Socialists,
Anarchists and religious heretics for hundreds of years. But his
intelligence tells him that the Earthly Paradise is receding into
the far distance and that what is actually ahead of us is
bloodshed, tyranny and privation. Recently he described himself as
a "short-term pessimist". Every kind of horror is blowing up over
the horizon, but somehow it will all come right in the end. This
outlook is probably gaining ground among thinking people: it
results from the very great difficulty, once one has abandoned
orthodox religious belief, of accepting life on earth as inherently
miserable, and on the other hand, from the realisation that to make
life liveable is a much bigger problem than it recently seemed.
Since about 1930 the world has given no reason for optimism
whatever. Nothing is in sight except a welter of lies, hatred,
cruelty and ignorance, and beyond our present troubles loom vaster
ones which are only now entering into the European consciousness.
It is quite possible that man's major problems will <i>never</i> be
solved. But it is also unthinkable! Who is there who dares to look
at the world of today and say to himself, "It will always be like
this: even in a million years it cannot get appreciably better?" So
you get the quasi-mystical belief that for the present there is no
remedy, all political action is useless, but that somewhere in
space and time human life will cease to be the miserable brutish
thing it now is.</p>

<p>The only easy way out is that of the religious believer, who
regards this life merely as a preparation for the next. But few
thinking people now believe in life after death, and the number of
those who do is probably diminishing. The Christian churches would
probably not survive on their own merits if their economic basis
were destroyed.</p>

<p>The real problem is how to restore the religious attitude while
accepting death as final. Men can only be happy when they do not
assume that the object of life is happiness. It is most unlikely,
however, that Koestler would accept this. There is a well-marked
hedonistic strain in his writings, and his failure to find a
political position after breaking with Stalinism is a result of
this.</p>

<p>The Russian Revolution, the central event in Koestler's fife,
started out with high hopes. We forget these things now, but a
quarter of a century ago it was confidently expected that the
Russian Revolution would lead to Utopia. Obviously this has not
happened. Koestler is too acute not to see this, and too sensitive
not to remember the original objective. Moreover, from his European
angle he can see such things as purges and mass deportations for
what they are; he is not, like Shaw or Laski, looking at them
through the wrong end of the telescope. Therefore he draws the
conclusion: This is what revolutions lead to. There is nothing for
it except to be a "short-term pessimist" i.e. to keep out of
politics, make a sort of oasis within which you and your friends
can remain sane, and hope that somehow things will be better in a
hundred years. At the basis of this lies his hedonism, which leads
him to think of the Earthly Paradise as desirable. Perhaps,
however, whether desirable or not, it isn't possible. Perhaps some
degree of suffering is ineradicable from human life, perhaps the
choice before man is always a choice of evils, perhaps even the aim
of Socialism is not to make the world perfect but to make it
better. All revolutions are failures, but they are not all the same
failure. It is his unwillingness to admit this that has led
Koestler's mind temporarily into a blind alley and that makes
<i>Arrival and Departure</i> seem shallow compared with the earlier
books.</p>

<h2>BENEFIT OF CLERGY: SOME NOTES ON SALVADOR DALI (1944)</h2>

<p>Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something
disgraceful. A man who gives a good account of himself is probably
lying, since any life when viewed from the inside is simply a
series of defeats. However, even the most flagrantly dishonest book
(Frank Harris's autobiographical writings are an example) can
without intending it give a true picture of its author. Dali's
recently published <i>Life</i> comes under this heading. Some of
the incidents in it are flatly incredible, others have been
rearranged and romanticised, and not merely the humiliation but the
persistent <i>ordinariness</i> of everyday life has been cut out.
Dali is even by his own diagnosis narcissistic, and his
autobiography is simply a strip-tease act conducted in pink
limelight. But as a record of fantasy, of the perversion of
instinct that has been made possible by the machine age, it has
great value.</p>

<p>Here, then, are some of the episodes in Dali's life, from his
earliest years onward. Which of them are true and which are
imaginary hardly matters: the point is that this is the kind of
thing that Dali would have <i>liked</i> to do.</p>

<p>When he is six years old there is some excitement over the
appearance of Halley's comet:</p>

<p>Suddenly one of my father's office clerks appeared in the
drawing-room doorway and announced that the comet could be seen
from the terrace... While crossing the hall I caught sight of my
little three-year-old sister crawling unobtrusively through a
doorway. I stopped, hesitated a second, then gave her a terrible
kick in the head as though it had been a ball, and continued
running, carried away with a 'delirious joy' induced by this savage
act. But my father, who was behind me, caught me and led me down in
to his office, where I remained as a punishment till
dinner-time.</p>

<p>A year earlier than this Dali had 'suddenly, as most of my ideas
occur,' flung another little boy off a suspension bridge. Several
other incidents of the same kind are recorded, including (<i>this
was when he was twenty-nine years old</i>) knocking down and
trampling on a girl 'until they had to tear her, bleeding, out of
my reach.'</p>

<p>When he is about five he gets hold of a wounded bat which he
puts into a tin pail. Next morning he finds that the bat is almost
dead and is covered with ants which are devouring it. He puts it in
his mouth, ants and all, and bites it almost in half.</p>

<p>When he is an adolescent a girl falls desperately in love with
him. He kisses and caresses her so as to excite her as much as
possible, but refuses to go further. He resolves to keep this up
for five years (he calls it his 'five-year plan'), enjoying her
humiliation and the sense of power it gives him. He frequently
tells her that at the end of the five years he will desert her, and
when the time comes he does so.</p>

<p>Till well into adult life he keeps up the practice of
masturbation, and likes to do this, apparently, in front of a
looking-glass. For ordinary purposes he is impotent, it appears,
till the age of thirty or so. When he first meets his future wife,
Gala, he is greatly tempted to push her off a precipice. He is
aware that there is something that she wants him to do to her, and
after their first kiss the confession is made:</p>

<p>I threw back Gala's head, pulling it by the hair, and trembling
with complete hysteria, I commanded:</p>

<p>'Now tell me what you want me to do with you! But tell me
slowly, looking me in the eye, with the crudest, the most
ferociously erotic words that can make both of us feel the greatest
shame!'</p>

<p>Then Gala, transforming the last glimmer of her expression of
pleasure into the hard light of her own tyranny, answered:</p>

<p>'I want you to kill me!'</p>

<p>He is somewhat disappointed by this demand, since it is merely
what he wanted to do already. He contemplates throwing her off the
bell-tower of the Cathedral of Toledo, but refrains from doing
so.</p>

<p>During the Spanish Civil War he astutely avoids taking sides,
and makes a trip to Italy. He feels himself more and more drawn
towards the aristocracy, frequents smart <i>salons</i>, finds
himself wealthy patrons, and is photographed with the plump Vicomte
de Noailles, whom he describes as his 'Maecenas.' When the European
War approaches he has one preoccupation only: how to find a place
which has good cookery and from which he can make a quick bolt if
danger comes too near. He fixes on Bordeaux, and duly flees to
Spain during the Battle of France. He stays in Spain long enough to
pick up a few anti-red atrocity stories, then makes for America.
The story ends in a blaze of respectability. Dali, at thirty-seven,
has become a devoted husband, is cured of his aberrations, or some
of them, and is completely reconciled to the Catholic Church. He is
also, one gathers, making a good deal of money.</p>

<p>However, he has by no means ceased to take pride in the pictures
of his Surrealist period, with titles like 'The Great Masturbator',
'Sodomy of a Skull with a Grand Piano', etc. There are
reproductions of these all the way through the book. Many of Dali's
drawings are simply representational and have a characteristic to
be noted later. But from his Surrealist paintings and photographs
the two things that stand our are sexual perversity and
necrophilia. Sexual objects and symbols&mdash;some of them well
known, like our old friend the high-heeled slipper, others, like
the crutch and the cup of warm milk, patented by Dali
himself&mdash;recur over and over again, and there is a fairly
well-marked excretory motif as well. In his painting, Le Jeu
Lugubre, he says, 'the drawers bespattered with excrement were
painted with such minute and realistic complacency that the whole
little Surrealist group was anguished by the question: Is he
coprophagic or not?' Dali adds firmly that he is <i>not</i>, and
that he regards this aberration as 'repulsive', but it seems to be
only at that point that his interest in excrement stops. Even when
he recounts the experience of watching a woman urinate standing up,
he has to add the detail that she misses her aim and dirties her
shoes. It is not given to any one person to have all the vices, and
Dali also boasts that he is not homosexual, but otherwise he seems
to have as good an outfit of perversions as anyone could wish
for.</p>

<p>However, his most notable characteristic is his necrophilia. He
himself freely admits to this, and claims to have been cured of it.
Dead faces, skulls, corpses of animals occur fairly frequently in
his pictures, and the ants which devoured the dying bat make
countless reappearances. One photograph shows an exhumed corpse,
far gone in decomposition. Another shows the dead donkeys
putrefying on top of grand pianos which formed part of the
Surrealist film, Le Chien Andalou. Dali still looks back on these
donkeys with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I 'made up' the putrefaction of the donkeys with great pots of
sticky glue which I poured over them. Also I emptied their
eye-sockets and made them larger by hacking them out with scissors.
In the same way I furiously cut their mouths open to make the rows
of their teeth show to better advantage, and I added several jaws
to each mouth, so that it would appear that although the donkeys
were already rotting they were vomiting up a little more their own
death, above those other rows of teeth formed by the keys of the
black pianos.</p>

<p>And finally there is the picture&mdash;apparently some kind of
faked photograph&mdash;of 'Mannequin rotting in a taxicab.' Over
the already somewhat bloated face and breast of the apparently dead
girl, huge snails were crawling. In the caption below the picture
Dali notes that these are Burgundy snails&mdash;that is, the edible
kind.</p>

<p>Of course, in this long book of 400 quarto pages there is more
than I have indicated, but I do not think that I have given an
unfair account of his moral atmosphere and mental scenery. It is a
book that stinks. If it were possible for a book to give a physical
stink off its pages, this one would&mdash;a thought that might
please Dali, who before wooing his future wife for the first time
rubbed himself all over with an ointment made of goat's dung boiled
up in fish glue. But against this has to be set the fact that Dali
is a draughtsman of very exceptional gifts. He is also, to judge by
the minuteness and the sureness of his drawings, a very hard
worker. He is an exhibitionist and a careerist, but he is not a
fraud. He has fifty times more talent than most of the people who
would denounce his morals and jeer at his paintings. And these two
sets of facts, taken together, raise a question which for lack of
any basis of agreement seldom gets a real discussion.</p>

<p>The point is that you have here a direct, unmistakable assault
on sanity and decency; and even&mdash;since some of Dali's pictures
would tend to poison the imagination like a pornographic
postcard&mdash;on life itself. What Dali has done and what he has
imagined is debatable, but in his outlook, his character, the
bedrock decency of a human being does not exist. He is as
anti-social as a flea. Clearly, such people are undesirable, and a
society in which they can flourish has something wrong with it.</p>

<p>Now, if you showed this book, with its illustrations, to Lord
Elton, to Mr. Alfred Noyes, to <i>The Times</i> leader writers who
exult over the 'eclipse of the highbrow'&mdash;in fact, to any
'sensible' art-hating English person&mdash;it is easy to imagine
what kind of response you would get. They would flatly refuse to
see any merit in Dali whatever. Such people are not only unable to
admit that what is morally degraded can be asthetically right, but
their real demand of every artist is that he shall pat them on the
back and tell them that thought is unnecessary. And they can be
especially dangerous at a time like the present, when the Ministry
of Information and the British Council put power into their hands.
For their impulse is not only to crush every new talent as it
appears, but to castrate the past as well. Witness the renewed
highbrow-baiting that is now going on in this country and America,
with its outcry not only against Joyce, Proust and Lawrence, but
even against T. S. Eliot.</p>

<p>But if you talk to the kind of person who <i>can</i> see Dali's
merits, the response that you get is not as a rule very much
better. If you say that Dali, though a brilliant draughtsman, is a
dirty little scoundrel, you are looked upon as a savage. If you say
that you don't like rotting corpses, and that people who do like
rotting corpses are mentally diseased, it is assumed that you lack
the aesthetic sense. Since 'Mannequin rotting in a taxicab' is a
good composition. And between these two fallacies there is no
middle position, but we seldom hear much about it. On the one side
<i>Kulturbolschevismus:</i> on the other (though the phrase itself
is out of fashion) 'Art for Art's sake.' Obscenity is a very
difficult question to discuss honestly. People are too frightened
either of seeming to be shocked or of seeming not to be shocked, to
be able to define the relationship between art and morals.</p>

<p>It will be seen that what the defenders of Dali are claiming is
a kind of <i>benefit of clergy</i>. The artist is to be exempt from
the moral laws that are binding on ordinary people. Just pronounce
the magic word 'Art', and everything is O.K.: kicking little girls
in the head is O.K.; even a film like L'Age d'Or is O.K. [Note,
below] It is also O.K. that Dali should batten on France for years
and then scuttle off like rat as soon as France is in danger. So
long as you can paint well enough to pass the test, all shall be
forgiven you.</p>

<p>[Note: Dali mentions L'Age d'Or and adds that its first public
showing was broken up by hooligans, but he does not say in detail
what it was about. According to Henry Miller's account of it, it
showed among other things some fairly detailed shots of a woman
defecating. (Author's Footnote)]</p>

<p>One can see how false this is if one extends it to cover
ordinary crime. In an age like our own, when the artist is an
altogether exceptional person, he must be allowed a certain amount
of irresponsibility, just as a pregnant woman is. Still, no one
would say that a pregnant woman should be allowed to commit murder,
nor would anyone make such a claim for the artist, however gifted.
If Shakespeare returned to the earth to-morrow, and if it were
found that his favourite recreation was raping little girls in
railway carriages, we should not tell him to go ahead with it on
the ground that he might write another <i>King Lear</i>. And, after
all, the worst crimes are not always the punishable ones. By
encouraging necrophilic reveries one probably does quite as much
harm as by, say, picking pockets at the races. One ought to be able
to hold in one's head simultaneously the two facts that Dali is a
good draughtsman and a disgusting human being. The one does not
invalidate or, in a sense, affect the other. The first thing that
we demand of a wall is that it shall stand up. If it stands up, it
is a good wall, and the question of what purpose it serves is
separable from that. And yet even the best wall in the world
deserves to be pulled down if it surrounds a concentration camp. In
the same way it should be possible to say, 'This is a good book or
a good picture, and it ought to be burned by the public hangman.'
Unless one can say that, at least in imagination, one is shirking
the implications of the fact that an artist is also a citizen and a
human being.</p>

<p>Not, of course, that Dali's autobiography, or his pictures,
ought to be suppressed. Short of the dirty postcards that used to
be sold in Mediterranean seaport towns, it is doubtful policy to
suppress anything, and Dali's fantasies probably cast useful light
on the decay of capitalist civilisation. But what he clearly needs
is diagnosis. The question is not so much <i>what</i> he is as
<i>why</i> he is like that. It ought not to be in doubt that his is
a diseased intelligence, probably not much altered by his alleged
conversion, since genuine penitents, or people who have returned to
sanity, do not flaunt their past vices in that complacent way. He
is a symptom of the world's illness. The important thing is not to
denounce him as a cad who ought to be horsewhipped, or to defend
him as a genius who ought not to be questioned, but to find out
<i>why</i> he exhibits that particular set of aberrations.</p>

<p>The answer is probably discoverable in his pictures, and those I
myself am not competent to examine. But I can point to one clue
which perhaps takes one part of the distance. This is the
old-fashioned, over-ornate Edwardian style of drawing to which Dali
tends to revert when he is not being Surrealist. Some of Dali's
drawings are reminiscent of D&uuml;rer, one (p. 113) seems to show
the influence of Beardsley, another (p. 269) seems to borrow
something from Blake. But the most persistent strain is the
Edwardian one. When I opened the book for the first time and looked
at its innumerable marginal illustrations, I was haunted by a
resemblance which I could not immediately pin down. I fetched up at
the ornamental candlestick at the beginning of Part I (p. 7). What
did this remind me of? Finally I tracked it down. It reminded me of
a large vulgar, expensively got-up edition of Anatole France (in
translation) which must have been published about 1914. That had
ornamental chapter headings and tailpieces after this style. Dali's
candlestick displays at one end a curly fish-like creature that
looks curiously familiar (it seems to be based on the conventional
dolphin), and at the other is the burning candle. This candle,
which recurs in one picture after another, is a very old friend.
You will find it, with the same picturesque gouts of wax arranged
on its sides, in those phoney electric lights done up as
candlesticks which are popular in sham-Tudor country hotels. This
candle, and the design beneath it, convey at once an intense
feeling of sentimentality. As though to counteract this, Dali has
spattered a quillful of ink all over the page, but without avail.
The same impression keeps popping up on page after page. The sign
at the bottom of page 62, for instance, would nearly go into
<i>Peter Pan</i>. The figure on page 224, in spite of having her
cranium elongated in to an immense sausage-like shape, is the witch
of the fairy-tale books. The horse on page 234 and the unicorn on
page 218 might be illustrations to James Branch Cabell. The rather
pansified drawings of youths on pages 97, 100 and elsewhere convey
the same impression. Picturesqueness keeps breaking in. Take away
the skulls, ants, lobsters, telephones and other paraphernalia, and
every now and again you are back in the world of Barrie, Rackham,
Dunsany and <i>Where the Rainbow Ends</i>.</p>

<p>Curiously, enough, some of the naughty-naughty touches in Dali's
autobiography tie up with the same period. When I read the passage
I quoted at the beginning, about the kicking of the little sister's
head, I was aware of another phantom resemblance. What was it? Of
course! <i>Ruthless Rhymes for Heartless Homes</i>, by Harry
Graham. Such rhymes were very popular round about 1912, and one
that ran:</p>

<pre>
Poor little Willy is crying so sore,
A sad little boy is he,
For he's broken his little sister's neck
And he'll have no jam for tea.
</pre>

<p>might almost have been founded on Dali's anecdote. Dali, of
course, is aware of his Edwardian leanings, and makes capital out
of them, more or less in a spirit of pastiche. He professes an
especial affection for the year 1900, and claims that every
ornamental object of 1900 is full of mystery, poetry, eroticism,
madness, perversity, et. Pastiche, however, usually implies a real
affection for the thing parodied. It seems to be, if not the rule,
at any rate distinctly common for an intellectual bent to be
accompanied by a non-rational, even childish urge in the same
direction. A sculptor, for instance, is interested in planes and
curves, but he is also a person who enjoys the physical act of
mucking about with clay or stone. An engineer is a person who
enjoys the feel of tools, the noise of dynamos and smell of oil. A
psychiatrist usually has a leaning toward some sexual aberration
himself. Darwin became a biologist partly because he was a country
gentleman and fond of animals. It may be therefore, that Dali's
seemingly perverse cult of Edwardian things (for example, his
'discovery' of the 1900 subway entrances) is merely the symptom of
a much deeper, less conscious affection. The innumerable,
beautifully executed copies of textbook illustrations, solemnly
labelled <i>le rossignol, une montre</i> and so on, which he
scatters all over his margins, may be meant partly as a joke. The
little boy in knickerbockers playing with a diabolo on page 103 is
a perfect period piece. But perhaps these things are also there
because Dali can't help drawing that kind of thing because it is to
that period and that style of drawing that he really belongs.</p>

<p>If so, his aberrations are partly explicable. Perhaps they are a
way of assuring himself that he is not commonplace. The two
qualities that Dali unquestionably possesses are a gift for drawing
and an atrocious egoism. 'At seven', he says in the first paragraph
of his book, 'I wanted to be Napoleon. And my ambition has been
growing steadily ever since.' This is worded in a deliberately
startling way, but no doubt it is substantially true. Such feelings
are common enough. 'I knew I was a genius', somebody once said to
me, 'long before I knew what I was going to be a genius about.' And
suppose that you have nothing in you except your egoism and a
dexterity that goes no higher than the elbow; suppose that your
real gift is for a detailed, academic, representational style of
drawing, your real <i>métier</i> to be an illustrator of scientific
textbooks. How then do you become Napoleon?</p>

<p>There is always one escape: <i>into wickedness</i>. Always do
the thing that will shock and wound people. At five, throw a little
boy off a bridge, strike an old doctor across the face with a whip
and break his spectacles&mdash;or, at any rate, dream about doing
such things. Twenty years later, gouge the eyes out of dead donkeys
with a pair of scissors. Along those lines you can always feel
yourself original. And after all, it pays! It is much less
dangerous than crime. Making all allowance for the probable
suppressions in Dali's autobiography, it is clear that he had not
had to suffer for his eccentricities as he would have done in an
earlier age. He grew up into the corrupt world of the
nineteen-twenties, when sophistication was immensely widespread and
every European capital swarmed with aristocrats and <i>rentiers</i>
who had given up sport and politics and taken to patronising the
arts. If you threw dead donkeys at people, they threw money back. A
phobia for grasshoppers&mdash;which a few decades back would merely
have provoked a snigger&mdash;was now an interesting 'complex'
which could be profitably exploited. And when that particular world
collapsed before the German Army, America was waiting. You could
even top it all up with religious conversion, moving at one hop and
without a shadow of repentance from the fashionable <i>salons</i>
of Paris to Abraham's bosom.</p>

<p>That, perhaps is the essential outline of Dali's history. But
why his aberrations should be the particular ones they were, and
why it should be so easy to 'sell' such horrors as rotting corpses
to a sophisticated public&mdash;those are questions for the
psychologist and the sociological critic. Marxist criticism has a
short way with such phenomena as Surrealism. They are 'bourgeois
decadence' (much play is made with the phrases 'corpse poisons' and
'decaying <i>rentier</i> class'), and that is that. But though this
probably states a fact, it does not establish a connection. One
would still like to know <i>why</i> Dali's leaning was towards
necrophilia (and not, say, homosexuality), and <i>why</i> the
<i>rentiers</i> and the aristocrats would buy his pictures instead
of hunting and making love like their grandfathers. Mere moral
disapproval does not get one any further. But neither ought one to
pretend, in the name of 'detachment', that such pictures as
'Mannequin rotting in a taxicab' are morally neutral. They are
diseased and disgusting, and any investigation ought to start out
from that fact.</p>

<h2>RAFFLES AND MISS BLANDISH (1944)</h2>

<p>Nearly half a century after his first appearance, Raffles, 'the
amateur cracksman', is still one of the best-known characters in
English fiction. Very few people would need telling that he played
cricket for England, had bachelor chambers in the Albany and
burgled the Mayfair houses which he also entered as a guest. Just
for that reason he and his exploits make a suitable background
against which to examine a more modern crime story such as <i>No
Orchids for Miss Blandish</i>. Any such choice is necessarily
arbitrary&mdash;I might equally well have chosen <i>Ars&egrave;ne
Lupin</i> for instance&mdash;but at any rate <i>No Orchids</i> and
the Raffles books [Note, below] have the common quality of being
crime stories which play the limelight on the criminal rather than
the policeman. For sociological purposes they can be compared.
<i>No Orchids</i> is the 1939 version of glamorized crime,
<i>Raffles</i> the 1900 version. What I am concerned with here is
the immense difference in moral atmosphere between the two books,
and the change in the popular attitude that this probably
implies.</p>

<p>[Note: <i>Raffles, a Thief in the Night</i> and <i>Mr. Justice
Raffles</i>, by E. W. Hornung. The third of these is definitely a
failure, and only the first has the true Raffles atmosphere.
Hornung wrote a number of crime stories, usually with a tendency to
take the side of the criminal. A successful book in rather the same
vein as <i>Raffles</i> is <i>Stiugaree</i>. (Author's
footnote.)]</p>

<p>At this date, the charm of <i>Raffles</i> is partly in the
period atmosphere and partly in the technical excellence of the
stories. Hornung was a very conscientious and on his level a very
able writer. Anyone who cares for sheer efficiency must admire his
work. However, the truly dramatic thing, about Raffles, the thing
that makes him a sort of byword even to this day (only a few weeks
ago, in a burglary case, a magistrate referred to the prisoner as
'a Raffles in real life'), is the fact that he is a
<i>gentleman</i>. Raffles is presented to us and this is rubbed
home in countless scraps of dialogue and casual remarks&mdash;not
as an honest man who has gone astray, but as a public-school man
who has gone astray. His remorse, when he feels any, is almost
purely social; he has disgraced 'the old school', he has lost his
right to enter 'decent society', he has forfeited his amateur
status and become a cad. Neither Raffles nor Bunny appears to feel
at all strongly that stealing is wrong in itself, though Raffles
does once justify himself by the casual remark that 'the
distribution of property is all wrong anyway'. They think of
themselves not as sinners but as renegades, or simply as outcasts.
And the moral code of most of us is still so close to Raffles' own
that we do feel his situation to be an especially ironical one. A
West End club man who is really a burglar! That is almost a story
in itself, is it not? But how if it were a plumber or a greengrocer
who was really a burglar? Would there be anything inherently
dramatic in that? No although the theme of the 'double life', of
respectability covering crime, is still there. Even Charles Peace
in his clergyman's dog-collar, seems somewhat less of a hypocrite
than Raffles in his Zingari blazer.</p>

<p>Raffles, of course, is good at all games, but it is peculiarly
fitting that his chosen game should be cricket. This allows not
only of endless analogies between his cunning as a slow bowler and
his cunning as a burglar, but also helps to define the exact nature
of his crime. Cricket is not in reality a very popular game in
England&mdash;it is nowhere so popular as football, for
instance&mdash;but it gives expression to a well-marked trait in
the English character, the tendency to value 'form' or 'style' more
highly than success. In the eyes of any true cricket-lover it is
possible for an innings of ten runs to be 'better' (i.e. more
elegant) than an innings of a hundred runs: cricket is also one of
the very few games in which the amateur can excel the professional.
It is a game full of forlorn hopes and sudden dramatic changes of
fortune, and its rules are so defined that their interpretation is
partly an ethical business. When Larwood, for instance, practised
bodyline bowling in Australia he was not actually breaking any
rule: he was merely doing something that was 'not cricket'. Since
cricket takes up a lot of time and is rather an expensive game to
play, it is predominantly an upper-class game, but for the whole
nation it is bound up with such concepts as 'good form', 'playing
the game', etc., and it has declined in popularity just as the
tradition of 'don't hit a man when he's down' has declined. It is
not a twentieth-century game, and nearly all modern-minded people
dislike it. The Nazis, for instance, were at pains to discourage
cricket, which had gained a certain footing in Germany before and
after the last war. In making Raffles a cricketer as well as a
burglar, Hornung was not merely providing him with a plausible
disguise; he was also drawing the sharpest moral contrast that he
was able to imagine.</p>

<p><i>Raffles</i>, no less than <i>Great Expectations</i> or <i>Le
Rouge et le Noir</i>, is a story of snobbery, and it gains a great
deal from the precariousness of Raffles's social position. A cruder
writer would have made the 'gentleman burglar' a member of the
peerage, or at least a baronet. Raffles, however, is of
upper-middle-class origin and is only accepted by the aristocracy
because of his personal charm. 'We were in Society but not of it',
he says to Bunny towards the end of the book; and 'I was asked
about for my cricket'. Both he and Bunny accept the values of
'Society' unquestioningly, and would settle down in it for good if
only they could get away with a big enough haul. The ruin that
constantly threatens them is all the blacker because they only
doubtfully 'belong'. A duke who has served a prison sentence is
still a duke, whereas a mere man about town, if once disgraced,
ceases to be 'about town' for evermore. The closing chapters of the
book, when Raffles has been exposed and is living under an assumed
name, have a twilight of the gods feeling, a mental atmosphere
rather similar to that of Kipling's poem, 'Gentleman Rankers':</p>

<p>Yes, a trooper of the forces&mdash;Who has run his own six
horses! etc.</p>

<p>Raffles now belongs irrevocably to the 'cohorts of the damned'.
He can still commit successful burglaries, but there is no way back
into Paradise, which means Piccadilly and the M.C.C. According to
the public-school code there is only one means of rehabilitation:
death in battle. Raffles dies fighting against the Boers (a
practised reader would foresee this from the start), and in the
eyes of both Bunny and his creator this cancels his crimes.</p>

<p>Both Raffles and Bunny, of course, are devoid of religious
belief, and they have no real ethical code, merely certain rules of
behaviour which they observe semi-instinctively. But it is just
here that the deep moral difference between <i>Raffles</i> and
<i>No Orchids</i> becomes apparent. Raffles and Bunny, after all,
are gentlemen, and such standards as they do have are not to be
violated. Certain things are 'not done', and the idea of doing them
hardly arises. Raffles will not, for example, abuse hospitality. He
will commit a burglary in a house where he is staying as a guest,
but the victim must be a fellow-guest and not the host. He will not
commit murder [Note, below], and he avoids violence wherever
possible and prefers to carry out his robberies unarmed. He regards
friendship as sacred, and is chivalrous though not moral in his
relations with women. He will take extra risks in the name of
'sportsmanship', and sometimes even for aesthetic reasons. And
above all, he is intensively patriotic. He celebrates the Diamond
Jubilee ('For sixty years, Bunny, we've been ruled over by
absolutely the finest sovereign the world has ever seen') by
dispatching to the Queen, through the post, an antique gold cup
which he has stolen from the British Museum. He steals, from partly
political motives, a pearl which the German Emperor is sending to
one of the enemies of Britain, and when the Boer War begins to go
badly his one thought is to find his way into the fighting line. At
the front he unmasks a spy at the cost of revealing his own
identity, and then dies gloriously by a Boer bullet. In this
combination of crime and patriotism he resembles his
near-contemporary Ars&egrave;ne Lupin, who also scores off the
German Emperor and wipes out his very dirty past by enlisting in
the Foreign Legion.</p>

<p>[Note: Actually Raffles does kill one man and is more or less
consciously responsible for the death of two others. But all three
of them are foreigners and have behaved in a very reprehensible
manner. He also, on one occasion, contemplates murdering a
blackmailer. It is however, a fairly well-established convention in
crime stories that murdering a blackmailer 'doesn't count'.
(Author's footnote, 1945.)]</p>

<p>It is important to note that by modern standards Raffles's
crimes are very petty ones. Four hundred pounds worth of jewellery
seems to him an excellent haul. And though the stories are
convincing in their physical detail, they contain very little
sensationalism&mdash;very few corpses, hardly any blood, no sex
crimes, no sadism, no perversions of any kind. It seems to be the
case that the crime story, at any rate on its higher levels, has
greatly increased in blood-thirstiness during the past twenty
years. Some of the early detective stories do not even contain a
murder. The Sherlock Holmes stories, for instance, are not all
murders, and some of them do not even deal with an indictable
crime. So also with the John Thorndyke stories, while of the Max
Carrados stories only a minority are murders. Since 1918, however,
a detective story not containing a murder has been a great rarity,
and the most disgusting details of dismemberment and exhumation are
commonly exploited. Some of the Peter Wimsey stories, for instance,
display an extremely morbid interest in corpses. The Raffles
stories, written from the angle of the criminal, are much less
anti-social than many modern stories written from the angle of the
detective. The main impression that they leave behind is of
boyishness. They belong to a time when people had standards, though
they happened to be foolish standards. Their key-phrase is 'not
done'. The line that they draw between good and evil is as
senseless as a Polynesian taboo, but at least, like the taboo, it
has the advantage that everyone accepts it.</p>

<p>So much for <i>Raffles</i>. Now for a header into the cesspool.
<i>No Orchids for Miss Blandish</i>, by James Hadley Chase, was
published in 1939, but seems to have enjoyed its greatest
popularity in 1940, during the Battle of Britain and the blitz. In
its main outlines its story is this:</p>

<p>Miss Blandish, the daughter of a millionaire, is kidnapped by
some gangsters who are almost immediately surprised and killed off
by a larger and better organized gang. They hold her to ransom and
extract half a million dollars from her father. Their original plan
had been to kill her as soon as the ransom-money was received, but
a chance keeps her alive. One of the gang is a young man named
Slim, whose sole pleasure in life consists in driving knives into
other people's bellies. In childhood he has graduated by cutting up
living animals with a pair of rusty scissors. Slim is sexually
impotent, but takes a kind of fancy to Miss Blandish. Slim's
mother, who is the real brains of the gang, sees in this the chance
of curing Slim's impotence, and decides to keep Miss Blandish in
custody till Slim shall have succeeded in raping her. After many
efforts and much persuasion, including the flogging of Miss
Blandish with a length of rubber hosepipe, the rape is achieved.
Meanwhile Miss Blandish's father has hired a private detective, and
by means of bribery and torture the detective and the police manage
to round up and exterminate the whole gang. Slim escapes with Miss
Blandish and is killed after a final rape, and the detective
prepares to restore Miss Blandish to her family. By this time,
however, she has developed such a taste for Slim's caresses [Note,
below] that she feels unable to live without him, and she jumps,
out of the window of a sky-scraper.</p>

<p>Several other points need noticing before one can grasp the full
implications of this book. To begin with, its central story bears a
very marked resemblance to William Faulkner's novel, Sanctuary.
Secondly, it is not, as one might expect, the product of an
illiterate hack, but a brilliant piece of writing, with hardly a
wasted word or a jarring note anywhere. Thirdly, the whole book,
récit as well as dialogue, is written in the American language; the
author, an Englishman who has (I believe) never been in the United
States, seems to have made a complete mental transference to the
American underworld. Fourthly, the book sold, according to its
publishers, no less than half a million copies.</p>

<p>I have already outlined the plot, but the subject-matter is much
more sordid and brutal than this suggests. The book contains eight
full-dress murders, an unassessable number of casual killings and
woundings, an exhumation (with a careful reminder of the stench),
the flogging of Miss Blandish, the torture of another woman with
red-hot cigarette-ends, a strip-tease act, a third-degree scene of
unheard-of cruelty and much else of the same kind. It assumes great
sexual sophistication in its readers (there is a scene, for
instance, in which a gangster, presumably of masochistic tendency,
has an orgasm in the moment of being knifed), and it takes for
granted the most complete corruption and self-seeking as the norm
of human behaviour. The detective, for instance, is almost as great
a rogue as the gangsters, and actuated by nearly the same motives.
Like them, he is in pursuit of 'five hundred grand'. It is
necessary to the machinery of the story that Mr. Blandish should be
anxious to get his daughter back, but apart from this, such things
as affection, friendship, good nature or even ordinary politeness
simply do not enter. Nor, to any great extent does normal
sexuality. Ultimately only one motive is at work throughout the
whole story: the pursuit of power.</p>

<p>[Note: Another reading of the final episode is possible. It may
mean merely that Miss Blandish is pregnant. But the interpretation
I have given above seems more in keeping with the general brutality
of the book. (Author's footnote, 1945)]</p>

<p>It should be noticed that the book is not in the ordinary sense
pornography. Unlike most books that deal in sexual sadism, it lays
the emphasis on the cruelty and not on the pleasure. Slim, the
ravisher of Miss Blandish, has 'wet slobbering lips': this is
disgusting, and it is meant to be disgusting. But the scenes
describing cruelty to women are comparatively perfunctory. The real
high-spots of the book are cruelties committed by men upon other
men; above all, the third-degreeing of the gangster, Eddie Schultz,
who is lashed into a chair and flogged on the windpipe with
truncheons, his arms broken by fresh blows as he breaks loose. In
another of Mr. Chase's books, <i>He Won't Need It Now</i>, the
hero, who is intended to be a sympathetic and perhaps even noble
character, is described as stamping on somebody's face, and then,
having crushed the man's mouth in, grinding his heel round and
round in it. Even when physical incidents of this kind are not
occurring, the mental atmosphere of these books is always the same.
Their whole theme is the struggle for power and the triumph of the
strong over the weak. The big gangsters wipe out the little ones as
mercilessly as a pike gobbling up the little fish in a pond; the
police kill off the criminals as cruelly as the angler kills the
pike. If ultimately one sides with the police against the
gangsters, it is merely because they are better organized and more
powerful, because, in fact, the law is a bigger racket than crime.
Might is right: vae victis.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned already, <i>No Orchids</i> enjoyed its
greatest vogue in 1940, though it was successfully running as a
play till some time later. It was, in fact, one of the things that
helped to console people for the boredom of being bombed. Early in
the war the <i>New Yorker</i> had a picture of a little man
approaching a news-stall littered with paper with such headlines as
'Great Tank Battles in Northern France', 'Big Naval Battle in the
North Sea', 'Huge Air Battles over the Channel', etc., etc. The
little man is saying <i>'action stories</i>, please'. That little
man stood for all the drugged millions to whom the world of the
gangster and the prize-ring is more 'real', more 'tough', than such
things as wars, revolutions, earthquakes, famines and pestilences.
From the point of view of a reader of <i>action stories</i>, a
description of the London blitz, or of the struggles of the
European underground parties, would be 'sissy stuff'. On the other
hand, some puny gun-battle in Chicago, resulting in perhaps half a
dozen deaths, would seem genuinely 'tough'. This habit of mind is
now extremely widespread. A soldier sprawls in a muddy trench, with
the machine-gun bullets crackling a foot or two overhead, and
whiles away his intolerable boredom by reading an American gangster
story. And what is it that makes that story so exciting? Precisely
the fact that people are shooting at each other with machine-guns!
Neither the soldier nor anyone else sees anything curious in this.
It is taken for granted that an imaginary bullet is more thrilling
than a real one.</p>

<p>The obvious explanation is that in real life one is usually a
passive victim, whereas in the adventure story one can think of
oneself as being at the centre of events. But there is more to it
than that. Here it is necessary to refer again to the curious fact
of <i>No Orchids</i> being written&mdash;with technical errors,
perhaps, but certainly with considerable skill&mdash;in the
American language.</p>

<p>There exists in America an enormous literature of more or less
the same stamp as <i>No Orchids</i>. Quite apart from books, there
is the huge array of 'pulp magazines', graded so as to cater for
different kinds of fantasy, but nearly all having much the same
mental atmosphere. A few of them go in for straight pornography,
but the great majority are quite plainly aimed at sadists and
masochists. Sold at threepence a copy under the title of Yank Mags,
[Note, below] these things used to enjoy considerable popularity in
England, but when the supply dried up owing to the war, no
satisfactory substitute was forthcoming. English imitations of the
'pulp magazine' do now exist, but they are poor things compared
with the original. English crook films, again, never approach the
American crook film in brutality. And yet the career of Mr. Chase
shows how deep the American influence has already gone. Not only is
he himself living a continuous fantasy-life in the Chicago
underworld, but he can count on hundreds of thousands of readers
who know what is meant by a 'clipshop' or the 'hotsquat', do not
have to do mental arithmetic when confronted by 'fifty grand', and
understand at sight a sentence like 'Johnny was a rummy and only
two jumps ahead of the nut-factory'. Evidently there are great
numbers of English people who are partly Americanized in language
and, one ought to add, in moral outlook. For there was no popular
protest against <i>No Orchids</i>. In the end it was withdrawn, but
only retrospectively, when a later work, <i>Miss Callaghan Comes to
Grief</i>, brought Mr. Chase's books to the attention of the
authorities. Judging by casual conversations at the time, ordinary
readers got a mild thrill out of the obscenities of <i>No
Orchids</i>, but saw nothing undesirable in the book as a whole.
Many people, incidentally, were under the impression that it was an
American book reissued in England.</p>

<p>[Note: They are said to have been imported into this country as
ballast which accounted for their low price and crumped appearance.
Since the war the ships have been ballasted with something more
useful, probably gravel. (Author's footnote)]</p>

<p>The thing that the ordinary reader <i>ought</i> to have objected
to&mdash;almost certainly would have objected to, a few decades
earlier&mdash;was the equivocal attitude towards crime. It is
implied throughout <i>No Orchids</i> that being a criminal is only
reprehensible in the sense that it does not pay. Being a policeman
pays better, but there is no moral difference, since the police use
essentially criminal methods. In a book like <i>He Won't Need It
Now</i> the distinction between crime and crime-prevention
practically disappears. This is a new departure for English
sensational fiction, in which till recently there has always been a
sharp distinction between right and wrong and a general agreement
that virtue must triumph in the last chapter. English books
glorifying crime (modern crime, that is&mdash;pirates and
highwaymen are different) are very rare. Even a book like
<i>Raffles</i>, as I have pointed out, is governed by powerful
taboos, and it is clearly understood that Raffles's crimes must be
expiated sooner or later. In America, both in life and fiction, the
tendency to tolerate crime, even to admire the criminal so long as
he is success, is very much more marked. It is, indeed, ultimately
this attitude that has made it possible for crime to flourish upon
so huge a scale. Books have been written about Al Capone that are
hardly different in tone from the books written about Henry Ford,
Stalin, Lord Northcliffe and all the rest of the 'log cabin to
White House' brigade. And switching back eighty years, one finds
Mark Twain adopting much the same attitude towards the disgusting
bandit Slade, hero of twenty-eight murders, and towards the Western
desperadoes generally. They were successful, they 'made good',
therefore he admired them.</p>

<p>In a book like <i>No Orchids</i> one is not, as in the old-style
crime story, simply escaping from dull reality into an imaginary
world of action. One's escape is essentially into cruelty and
sexual perversion. <i>No Orchids</i> is aimed at the
power-instinct, which <i>Raffles</i> or the Sherlock Holmes stories
are not. At the same time the English attitude towards crime is not
so superior to the American as I may have seemed to imply. It too
is mixed up with power-worship, and has become more noticeably so
in the last twenty years. A writer who is worth examining is Edgar
Wallace, especially in such typical books as <i>The Orator</i> and
the Mr. J. G. Reeder stories. Wallace was one of the first
crime-story writers to break away from the old tradition of the
private detective and make his central figure a Scotland Yard
official. Sherlock Holmes is an amateur, solving his problems
without the help and even, in the earlier stories, against the
opposition of the police. Moreover, like Lupin, he is essentially
an intellectual, even a scientist. He reasons logically from
observed fact, and his intellectuality is constantly contrasted
with the routine methods of the police. Wallace objected strongly
to this slur, as he considered it, on Scotland Yard, and in several
newspaper articles he went out of his way to denounce Holmes
byname. His own ideal was the detective-inspector who catches
criminals not because he is intellectually brilliant but because he
is part of an all-powerful organization. Hence the curious fact
that in Wallace's most characteristic stories the 'clue' and the
'deduction' play no part. The criminal is always defeated by an
incredible coincidence, or because in some unexplained manner the
police know all about the crime beforehand. The tone of the stories
makes it quite clear that Wallace's admiration for the police is
pure bully-worship. A Scotland Yard detective is the most powerful
kind of being that he can imagine, while the criminal figures in
his mind as an outlaw against whom anything is permissible, like
the condemned slaves in the Roman arena. His policemen behave much
more brutally than British policemen do in real life&mdash;they hit
people with out provocation, fire revolvers past their ears to
terrify them and so on&mdash;and some of the stories exhibit a
fearful intellectual sadism. (For instance, Wallace likes to
arrange things so that the villain is hanged on the same day as the
heroine is married.) But it is sadism after the English fashion:
that is to say, it is unconscious, there is not overtly any sex in
it, and it keeps within the bounds of the law. The British public
tolerates a harsh criminal law and gets a kick out of monstrously
unfair murder trials: but still that is better, on any account,
than tolerating or admiring crime. If one must worship a bully, it
is better that he should be a policeman than a gangster. Wallace is
still governed to some extent by the concept of 'not done.' In
<i>No Orchids</i> anything is 'done' so long as it leads on to
power. All the barriers are down, all the motives are out in the
open. Chase is a worse symptom than Wallace, to the extent that
all-in wrestling is worse than boxing, or Fascism is worse than
capitalist democracy.</p>

<p>In borrowing from William Faulkner's <i>Sanctuary</i>, Chase
only took the plot; the mental atmosphere of the two books is not
similar. Chase really derives from other sources, and this
particular bit of borrowing is only symbolic. What it symbolizes is
the vulgarization of ideas which is constantly happening, and which
probably happens faster in an age of print. Chase has been
described as 'Faulkner for the masses', but it would be more
accurate to describe him as Carlyle for the masses. He is a popular
writer&mdash;there are many such in America, but they are still
rarities in England&mdash;who has caught up with what is now
fashionable to call 'realism', meaning the doctrine that might is
right. The growth of 'realism' has been the great feature of the
intellectual history of our own age. Why this should be so is a
complicated question. The interconnexion between sadism, masochism,
success-worship, power-worship, nationalism, and totalitarianism is
a huge subject whose edges have barely been scratched, and even to
mention it is considered somewhat indelicate. To take merely the
first example that comes to mind, I believe no one has ever pointed
out the sadistic and masochistic element in Bernard Shaw's work,
still less suggested that this probably has some connexion with
Shaw's admiration for dictators. Fascism is often loosely equated
with sadism, but nearly always by people who see nothing wrong in
the most slavish worship of Stalin. The truth is, of course, that
the countless English intellectuals who kiss the arse of Stalin are
not different from the minority who give their allegiance to Hitler
or Mussolini, nor from the efficiency experts who preached 'punch',
'drive', 'personality' and 'learn to be a Tiger man' in the
nineteen-twenties, nor from that older generation of intellectuals,
Carlyle, Creasey and the rest of them, who bowed down before German
militarism. All of them are worshipping power and successful
cruelty. It is important to notice that the cult of power tends to
be mixed up with a love of cruelty and wickedness <i>for their own
sakes</i>. A tyrant is all the more admired if he happens to be a
bloodstained crook as well, and 'the end justifies the means' often
becomes, in effect, 'the means justify themselves provided they are
dirty enough'. This idea colours the outlook of all sympathizers
with totalitarianism, and accounts, for instance, for the positive
delight with which many English intellectuals greeted the
Nazi-Soviet pact. It was a step only doubtfully useful to the
U.S.S.R., but it was entirely unmoral, and for that reason to be
admired; the explanations of it, which were numerous and
self-contradictory, could come afterwards.</p>

<p>Until recently the characteristic adventure stories of the
English-speaking peoples have been stories in which the hero fights
<i>against odds</i>. This is true all the way from Robin Hood to
Pop-eye the Sailor. Perhaps the basic myth of the Western world is
Jack the Giant-killer, but to be brought up to date this should be
renamed Jack the Dwarf-killer, and there already exists a
considerable literature which teaches, either overtly or
implicitly, that one should side with the big man against the
little man. Most of what is now written about foreign policy is
simply an embroidery on this theme, and for several decades such
phrases as 'Play the game', 'Don't hit a man when he's down' and
'It's not cricket' have never failed to draw a snigger from anyone
of intellectual pretensions. What is comparatively new is to find
the accepted pattern, according to which (a) right is right and
wrong is wrong, whoever wins, and (b) weakness must be respected,
disappearing from popular literature as well. When I first read D.
H. Lawrence's novels, at the age of about twenty, I was puzzled by
the fact that there did not seem to be any classification of the
characters into 'good' and 'bad'. Lawrence seemed to sympathize
with all of them about equally, and this was so unusual as to give
me the feeling of having lost my bearings. Today no one would think
of looking for heroes and villains in a serious novel, but in
lowbrow fiction one still expects to find a sharp distinction
between right and wrong and between legality and illegality. The
common people, on the whole, are still living in the world of
absolute good and evil from which the intellectuals have long since
escaped. But the popularity of <i>No Orchids</i> and the American
books and magazines to which it is akin shows how rapidly the
doctrine of 'realism' is gaining ground.</p>

<p>Several people, after reading <i>No Orchids</i>, have remarked
to me, 'It's pure Fascism'. This is a correct description, although
the book has not the smallest connexion with politics and very
little with social or economic problems. It has merely the same
relation to Fascism as, say Trollope's novels have to
nineteenth-century capitalism. It is a daydream appropriate to a
totalitarian age. In his imagined world of gangsters Chase is
presenting, as it were, a distilled version of the modern political
scene, in which such things as mass bombing of civilians, the use
of hostages, torture to obtain confessions, secret prisons,
execution without trial, floggings with rubber truncheons,
drownings in cesspools, systematic falsification of records and
statistics, treachery, bribery, and quislingism are normal and
morally neutral, even admirable when they are done in a large and
bold way. The average man is not directly interested in politics,
and when he reads, he wants the current struggles of the world to
be translated into a simple story about individuals. He can take an
interest in Slim and Fenner as he could not in the G.P.U. and the
Gestapo. People worship power in the form in which they are able to
understand it. A twelve-year-old boy worships Jack Dempsey. An
adolescent in a Glasgow slum worships Al Capone. An aspiring pupil
at a business college worships Lord Nuffield. A <i>New
Statesman</i> reader worships Stalin. There is a difference in
intellectual maturity, but none in moral outlook. Thirty years ago
the heroes of popular fiction had nothing in common with Mr.
Chase's gangsters and detectives, and the idols of the English
liberal intelligentsia were also comparatively sympathetic figures.
Between Holmes and Fenner on the one hand, and between Abraham
Lincoln and Stalin on the other, there is a similar gulf.</p>

<p>One ought not to infer too much from the success of Mr. Chase's
books. It is possible that it is an isolated phenomenon, brought
about by the mingled boredom and brutality of war. But if such
books should definitely acclimatize themselves in England, instead
of being merely a half-understood import from America, there would
be good grounds for dismay. In choosing <i>Raffles</i> as a
background for <i>No Orchids</i> I deliberately chose a book which
by the standards of its time was morally equivocal. Raffles, as I
have pointed out, has no real moral code, no religion, certainly no
social consciousness. All he has is a set of reflexes the nervous
system, as it were, of a gentleman. Give him a sharp tap on this
reflex or that (they are called 'sport', 'pal', 'woman', 'king and
country' and so forth), and you get a predictable reaction. In Mr.
Chase's books there are no gentlemen and no taboos. Emancipation is
complete. Freud and Machiavelli have reached the outer suburbs.
Comparing the schoolboy atmosphere of the one book with the cruelty
and corruption of the other, one is driven to feel that
snobbishness, like hypocrisy, is a check upon behaviour whose value
from a social point of view has been underrated.</p>

<h2>ANTISEMITISM IN BRITAIN (1945)</h2>

<p>There are about 400,000 known Jews in Britain, and in addition
some thousands or, at most, scores of thousands of Jewish refugees
who have entered the country from 1934 onwards. The Jewish
population is almost entirely concentrated in half a dozen big
towns and is mostly employed in the food, clothing and furniture
trades. A few of the big monopolies, such as the ICI, one or two
leading newspapers and at least one big chain of department stores
are Jewish-owned or partly Jewish-owned, but it would be very far
from the truth to say that British business life is dominated by
Jews. The Jews seem, on the contrary, to have failed to keep up
with the modern tendency towards big amalgamations and to have
remained fixed in those trades which are necessarily carried out on
a small scale and by old-fashioned methods.</p>

<p>I start off with these background facts, which are already known
to any well-informed person, in order to emphasise that there is no
real Jewish "problem" in England. The Jews are not numerous or
powerful enough, and it is only in what are loosely called
"intellectual circles" that they have any noticeable influence. Yet
it is generally admitted that antisemitism is on the increase, that
it has been greatly exacerbated by the war, and that humane and
enlightened people are not immune to it. It does not take violent
forms (English people are almost invariably gentle and
law-abiding), but it is ill-natured enough, and in favourable
circumstances it could have political results. Here are some
samples of antisemitic remarks that have been made to me during the
past year or two:</p>

<p>Middle-aged office employee: "I generally come to work by bus.
It takes longer, but I don't care about using the Underground from
Golders Green nowadays. There's too many of the Chosen Race
travelling on that line."</p>

<p>Tobacconist (woman): "No, I've got no matches for you. I should
try the lady down the street. <i>she's</i> always got matches. One
of the Chosen Race, you see."</p>

<p>Young intellectual, Communist or near-Communist: "No, I do
<i>not</i> like Jews. I've never made any secret of that. I can't
stick them. Mind you, I'm not antisemitic, of course."</p>

<p>Middle-class woman: "Well, no one could call me antisemitic, but
I do think the way these Jews behave is too absolutely stinking.
The way they push their way to the head of queues, and so on.
They're so abominably selfish. I think they're responsible for a
lot of what happens to them."</p>

<p>Milk roundsman: "A Jew don't do no work, not the same as what an
Englishman does. 'E's too clever. We work with this 'ere" (flexes
his biceps). "They work with that there" (taps his forehead).</p>

<p>Chartered accountant, intelligent, left-wing in an undirected
way: "These bloody Yids are all pro-German. They'd change sides
tomorrow if the Nazis got here. I see a lot of them in my business.
They admire Hitler at the bottom of their hearts. They'll always
suck up to anyone who kicks them."</p>

<p>Intelligent woman, on being offered a book dealing with
antisemitism and German atrocities: "Don't show it me,
<i>please</i> don't show it to me. It'll only make me hate the Jews
more than ever."</p>

<p>I could fill pages with similar remarks, but these will do to go
on with. Two facts emerge from them. One&mdash;which is very
important and which I must return to in a moment&mdash;is that
above a certain intellectual level people are ashamed of being
antisemitic and are careful to draw a distinction between
"antisemitism" and "disliking Jews". The other is that antisemitism
is an irrational thing. The Jews are accused of specific offences
(for instance, bad behaviour in food queues) which the person
speaking feels strongly about, but it is obvious that these
accusations merely rationalise some deep-rooted prejudice. To
attempt to counter them with facts and statistics is useless, and
may sometimes be worse than useless. As the last of the
above-quoted remarks shows, people can remain antisemitic, or at
least anti-Jewish, while being fully aware that their outlook is
indefensible. If you dislike somebody, you dislike him and there is
an end of it: your feelings are not made any better by a recital of
his virtues.</p>

<p>It so happens that the war has encouraged the growth of
antisemitism and even, in the eyes of many ordinary people, given
some justification for it. To begin with, the Jews are one people
of whom it can be said with complete certainty that they will
benefit by an Allied victory. Consequently the theory that "this is
a Jewish war" has a certain plausibility, all the more so because
the Jewish war effort seldom gets its fair share of recognition.
The British Empire is a huge heterogeneous organisation held
together largely by mutual consent, and it is often necessary to
flatter the less reliable elements at the expense of the more loyal
ones. To publicise the exploits of Jewish soldiers, or even to
admit the existence of a considerable Jewish army in the Middle
East, rouses hostility in South Africa, the Arab countries and
elsewhere: it is easier to ignore the whole subject and allow the
man in the street to go on thinking that Jews are exceptionally
clever at dodging military service. Then again, Jews are to be
found in exactly those trades which are bound to incur unpopularity
with the civilian public in war-time. Jews are mostly concerned
with selling food, clothes, furniture and tobacco&mdash;exactly the
commodities of which there is a chronic shortage, with consequent
overcharging, black-marketing and favouritism. And again, the
common charge that Jews behave in an exceptionally cowardly way
during air raids was given a certain amount of colour by the big
raids of 1940. As it happened, the Jewish quarter of Whitechapel
was one of the first areas to be heavily blitzed, with the natural
result that swarms of Jewish refugees distributed themselves all
over London. If one judged merely from these war-time phenomena, it
would be easy to imagine that antisemitism is a quasi-rational
thing, founded on mistaken premises. And naturally the antisemite
thinks of himself as a reasonable being. Whenever I have touched on
this subject in a newspaper article, I have always had a
considerable "come-back", and invariably some of the letters are
from well-balanced, middling people&mdash;doctors, for
example&mdash;with no apparent economic grievance. These people
always say (as Hitler says in <i>Mein Kampf</i>) that they started
out with no anti-Jewish prejudice but were driven into their
present position by mere observation of the facts. Yet one of the
marks of antisemitism is an ability to believe stories that could
not possibly be true. One could see a good example of this in the
strange accident that occurred in London in 1942, when a crowd,
frightened by a bomb-burst nearby, fled into the mouth of an
Underground station, with the result that something over a hundred
people were crushed to death. The very same day it was repeated all
over London that "the Jews were responsible". Clearly, if people
will believe this kind of thing, one will not get much further by
arguing with them. The only useful approach is to discover
<i>why</i> they can swallow absurdities on one particular subject
while remaining sane on others.</p>

<p>But now let me come back to that point I mentioned
earlier&mdash;that there is widespread awareness of the prevalence
of antisemitic feeling, and unwillingness to admit sharing it.
Among educated people, antisemitism is held to be an unforgivable
sin and in a quite different category from other kinds of racial
prejudice. People will go to remarkable lengths to demonstrate that
they are <i>not</i> antisemitic. Thus, in 1943 an intercession
service on behalf of the Polish Jews was held in a synagogue in St
John's Wood. The local authorities declared themselves anxious to
participate in it, and the service was attended by the mayor of the
borough in his robes and chain, by representatives of all the
churches, and by detachments of RAF, Home Guards, nurses, Boy
Scouts and what not. On the surface it was a touching demonstration
of solidarity with the suffering Jews. But it was essentially a
<i>conscious</i> effort to behave decently by people whose
subjective feelings must in many cases have been very different.
That quarter of London is partly Jewish, antisemitism is rife
there, and, as I well knew, some of the men sitting round me in the
synagogue were tinged by it. Indeed, the commander of my own
platoon of Home Guards, who had been especially keen beforehand
that we should "make a good show" at the intercession service, was
an ex-member of Mosley's Blackshirts. While this division of
feeling exists, tolerance of mass violence against Jews, or, what
is more important, antisemitic legislation, are not possible in
England. It is not at present possible, indeed, that antisemitism
should <i>become respectable</i>. But this is less of an advantage
than it might appear.</p>

<p>One effect of the persecutions in Germany has been to prevent
antisemitism from being seriously studied. In England a brief
inadequate survey was made by Mass Observation a year or two ago,
but if there has been any other investigation of the subject, then
its findings have been kept strictly secret. At the same time there
has been conscious suppression, by all thoughtful people, of
anything likely to wound Jewish susceptibilities. After 1934 the
Jew joke disappeared as though by magic from postcards, periodicals
and the music-hall stage, and to put an unsympathetic Jewish
character into a novel or short story came to be regarded as
antisemitism. On the Palestine issue, too, it was <i>de rigueur</i>
among enlightened people to accept the Jewish case as proved and
avoid examining the claims of the Arabs&mdash;a decision which
might be correct on its own merits, but which was adopted primarily
because the Jews were in trouble and it was felt that one must not
criticise them. Thanks to Hitler, therefore, you had a situation in
which the press was in effect censored in favour of the Jews while
in private antisemitism was on the up-grade, even, to some extent,
among sensitive and intelligent people. This was particularly
noticeable in 1940 at the time of the internment of the refugees.
Naturally, every thinking person felt that it was his duty to
protest against the wholesale locking-up of unfortunate foreigners
who for the most part were only in England because they were
opponents of Hitler. Privately, however, one heard very different
sentiments expressed. A minority of the refugees behaved in an
exceedingly tactless way, and the feeling against them necessarily
had an antisemitic undercurrent, since they were largely Jews. A
very eminent figure in the Labour Party&mdash;I won't name him, but
he is one of the most respected people in England&mdash;said to me
quite violently: "We never asked these people to come to this
country. If they choose to come here, let them take the
consequences." Yet this man would as a matter of course have
associated himself with any kind of petition or manifesto against
the internment of aliens. This feeling that antisemitism is
something sinful and disgraceful, something that a civilised person
does not suffer from, is unfavourable to a scientific approach, and
indeed many people will admit that they are frightened of probing
too deeply into the subject. They are frightened, that is to say,
of discovering not only that antisemitism is spreading, but that
they themselves are infected by it.</p>

<p>To see this in perspective one must look back a few decades, to
the days when Hitler was an out-of-work house-painter whom nobody
had heard of. One would then find that though antisemitism is
sufficiently in evidence now, it is probably <i>less</i> prevalent
in England than it was thirty years ago. It is true that
antisemitism as a fully thought-out racial or religious doctrine
has never flourished in England. There has never been much feeling
against inter-marriage, or against Jews taking a prominent part in
public life. Nevertheless, thirty years ago it was accepted more or
less as a law of nature that a Jew was a figure of fun
and&mdash;though superior in intelligence&mdash;slightly deficient
in "character". In theory a Jew suffered from no legal
disabilities, but in effect he was debarred from certain
professions. He would probably not have been accepted as an officer
in the navy, for instance, nor in what is called a "smart" regiment
in the army. A Jewish boy at a public school almost invariably had
a bad time. He could, of course, live down his Jewishness if he was
exceptionally charming or athletic, but it was an initial
disability comparable to a stammer or a birthmark. Wealthy Jews
tended to disguise themselves under aristocratic English or
Scottish names, and to the average person it seemed quite natural
that they should do this, just as it seems natural for a criminal
to change his identity if possible. About twenty years ago, in
Rangoon, I was getting into a taxi with a friend when a small
ragged boy of fair complexion rushed up to us and began a
complicated story about having arrived from Colombo on a ship and
wanting money to get back. His manner and appearance were difficult
to "place", and I said to him:</p>

<p>"You speak very good English. What nationality are you?"</p>

<p>He answered eagerly in his chi-chi accent: "I am a <i>joo</i>,
sir!"</p>

<p>And I remember turning to my companion and saying, only partly
in joke, "He admits it openly." All the Jews I had known till then
were people who were ashamed of being Jews, or at any rate
preferred not to talk about their ancestry, and if forced to do so
tended to use the word "Hebrew".</p>

<p>The working-class attitude was no better. The Jew who grew up in
Whitechapel took it for granted that he would be assaulted, or at
least hooted at, if he ventured into one of the Christian slums
nearby, and the "Jew joke" of the music halls and the comic papers
was almost consistently ill-natured. [Note at end of paragraph]
There was also literary Jew-baiting, which in the hands of Belloc,
Chesterton and their followers reached an almost continental level
of scurrility. Non-Catholic writers were sometimes guilty of the
same thing in a milder form. There has been a perceptible
antisemitic strain in English literature from Chaucer onwards, and
without even getting up from this table to consult a book I can
think of passages which <i>if written now</i> would be stigmatised
as antisemitism, in the works of Shakespeare, Smollett, Thackeray,
Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, T. S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley and various
others. Offhand, the only English writers I can think of who,
before the days of Hitler, made a definite effort to stick up for
Jews are Dickens and Charles Reade. And however little the average
intellectual may have agreed with the opinions of Belloc and
Chesterton, he did not acutely disapprove of them. Chesterton's
endless tirades against Jews, which he thrust into stories and
essays upon the flimsiest pretexts, never got him into
trouble&mdash;indeed Chesterton was one of the most generally
respected figures in English literary life. Anyone who wrote in
that strain <i>now</i> would bring down a storm of abuse upon
himself, or more probably would find it impossible to get his
writings published.</p>

<p>[Note: It is interesting to compare the "Jew joke" with that
other stand-by of the music halls, the "Scotch joke", which
superficially it resembles. Occasionally a story is told (e.g. the
Jew and the Scotsman who went into a pub together and both died of
thirst) which puts both races on an equality, but in general the
Jew is credited <i>merely</i> with cunning and avarice while the
Scotsman is credited with physical hardihood as well. This is seen,
for example, in the story of the Jew and the Scotsman who go
together to a meeting which has been advertised as free.
Unexpectedly there is a collection, and to avoid this the Jew
faints and the Scotsman carries him out. Here the Scotsman performs
the athletic feat of carrying the other. It would seem vaguely
wrong if it were the other way about. (Author's footnote.)]</p>

<p>If, as I suggest, prejudice against Jews has always been pretty
widespread in England, there is no reason to think that Hitler has
genuinely diminished it. He has merely caused a sharp division
between the politically conscious person who realises that this is
not a time to throw stones at the Jews, and the unconscious person
whose native antisemitism is increased by the nervous strain of the
war. One can assume, therefore, that many people who would perish
rather than admit to antisemitic feelings are secretly prone to
them. I have already indicated that I believe antisemitism to be
essentially a neurosis, but of course it has its rationalisations,
which are sincerely believed in and are partly true. The
rationalisation put forward by the common man is that the Jew is an
exploiter. The partial justification for this is that the Jew, in
England, is generally a small businessman&mdash;that is to say a
person whose depredations are more obvious and intelligible than
those of, say, a bank or an insurance company. Higher up the
intellectual scale, antisemitism is rationalised by saying that the
Jew is a person who spreads disaffection and weakens national
morale. Again there is some superficial justification for this.
During the past twenty-five years the activities of what are called
"intellectuals" have been largely mischievous. I do not think it an
exaggeration to say that if the "intellectuals" had done their work
a little more thoroughly, Britain would have surrendered in 1940.
But the disaffected intelligentsia inevitably included a large
number of Jews. With some plausibility it can be said that the Jews
are the enemies of our native culture and our national morale.
Carefully examined, the claim is seen to be nonsense, but there are
always a few prominent individuals who can be cited in support of
it. During the past few years there has been what amounts to a
counter-attack against the rather shallow Leftism which was
fashionable in the previous decade and which was exemplified by
such organisations as the Left Book Club. This counter-attack (see
for instance such books as Arnold Lutin's <i>The Good Gorilla</i>
or Evelyn Waugh's <i>Put Out More Flags</i>) has an antisemitic
strain, and it would probably be more marked if the subject were
not so obviously dangerous. It so happens that for some decades
past Britain has had no nationalist intelligentsia worth bothering
about. But British nationalism, i.e. nationalism of an intellectual
kind, may revive, and probably will revive if Britain comes out of
the present war greatly weakened. The young intellectuals of 1950
may be as naively patriotic as those of 1914. In that case the kind
of antisemitism which flourished among the anti-Dreyfusards in
France, and which Chesterton and Belloc tried to import into this
country, might get a foothold.</p>

<p>I have no hard-and-fast theory about the origins of
antisemitism. The two current explanations, that it is due to
economic causes, or on the other hand, that it is a legacy from the
Middle Ages, seem to me unsatisfactory, though I admit that if one
combines them they can be made to cover the facts. All I would say
with confidence is that antisemitism is part of the larger problem
of nationalism, which has not yet been seriously examined, and that
the Jew is evidently a scapegoat, though for what he is a scapegoat
we do not yet know. In this essay I have relied almost entirely on
my own limited experience, and perhaps every one of my conclusions
would be negatived by other observers. The fact is that there are
almost no data on this subject. But for what they are worth I will
summarise my opinions. Boiled down, they amount to this:</p>

<p>There is more antisemitism in England than we care to admit, and
the war has accentuated it, but it is not certain that it is on the
increase if one thinks in terms of decades rather than years.</p>

<p>It does not at present lead to open persecution, but it has the
effect of making people callous to the sufferings of Jews in other
countries.</p>

<p>It is at bottom quite irrational and will not yield to
argument.</p>

<p>The persecutions in Germany have caused much concealment of
antisemitic feeling and thus obscured the whole picture.</p>

<p>The subject needs serious investigation.</p>

<p>Only the last point is worth expanding. To study any subject
scientifically one needs a detached attitude, which is obviously
harder when one's own interests or emotions are involved. Plenty of
people who are quite capable of being objective about sea urchins,
say, or the square root of 2, become schizophrenic if they have to
think about the sources of their own income. What vitiates nearly
all that is written about antisemitism is the assumption in the
writer's mind that <i>he himself</i> is immune to it. "Since I know
that antisemitism is irrational," he argues, "it follows that I do
not share it." He thus fails to start his investigation in the one
place where he could get hold of some reliable evidence&mdash;that
is, in his own mind.</p>

<p>It seems to me a safe assumption that the disease loosely called
nationalism is now almost universal. Antisemitism is only one
manifestation of nationalism, and not everyone will have the
disease in that particular form. A Jew, for example, would not be
antisemitic: but then many Zionist Jews seem to me to be merely
antisemites turned upside-down, just as many Indians and Negroes
display the normal colour prejudices in an inverted form. The point
is that something, some psychological vitamin, is lacking in modern
civilisation, and as a result we are all more or less subject to
this lunacy of believing that whole races or nations are
mysteriously good or mysteriously evil. I defy any modern
intellectual to look closely and honestly into his own mind without
coming upon nationalistic loyalties and hatreds of one kind or
another. It is the fact that he can feel the emotional tug of such
things, and yet see them dispassionately for what they are, that
gives him his status as an intellectual. It will be seen,
therefore, that the starting point for any investigation of
antisemitism should not be "Why does this obviously irrational
belief appeal to other people?" but "Why does antisemitism appeal
<i>to me</i>? What is there about it that I feel to be true?" If
one asks this question one at least discovers one's own
rationalisations, and it may be possible to find out what lies
beneath them. Antisemitism should be investigated&mdash;and I will
not say by antisemites, but at any rate by people who know that
they are not immune to that kind of emotion. When Hitler has
disappeared a real enquiry into this subject will be possible, and
it would probably be best to start not by debunking antisemitism,
but by marshalling all the justifications for it that can be found,
in one's own mind or anybody else's. In that way one might get some
clues that would lead to its psychological roots. But that
antisemitism will be definitively <i>cured</i>, without curing the
larger disease of nationalism, I do not believe.</p>

<h2>FREEDOM OF THE PARK (1945)</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago, five people who were selling papers outside
Hyde Park were arrested by the police for obstruction. When taken
before the magistrates, they were all found guilty, four of them
being bound over for six months and the other sentenced to forty
shillings fine or a month's imprisonments. He preferred to serve
his term.</p>

<p>The papers these people were selling were <i>Peace News,
Forward</i> and <i>Freedom</i>, besides other kindred literature.
<i>Peace News</i> is the organ of the Peace Pledge Union,
<i>Freedom</i> (till recently called <i>War Commentary</i>) is that
of the Anarchists; as for <i>Forward</i>, its politics defy
definition, but at any rate it is violently Left. The magistrate,
in passing sentence, stated that he was not influenced by the
nature of the literature that was being sold; he was concerned
merely with the fact of obstruction, and that this offence had
technically been committed.</p>

<p>This raises several important points. To begin with, how does
the law stand on the subject? As far as I can discover, selling
newspapers in the street is technically an obstruction, at any rate
if you fail to move when the police tell you to. So it would be
legally possible for any policeman who felt like it to arrest any
newsboy for selling the <i>Evening News</i>. Obviously this doesn't
happen, so that the enforcement of the law depends on the
discretion of the police.</p>

<p>And what makes the police decide to arrest one man rather than
another? However it may be with the magistrate, I find it hard to
believe that in this case the police were not influenced by
political considerations. It is a bit too much of a coincidence
that they should have picked on people selling just those
papers.</p>

<p>If they had also arrested someone selling <i>Truth</i>, or the
<i>Tablet</i>, or the <i>Spectator</i>, or even the <i>Church
Times</i>, their impartiality would be easier to believe in.</p>

<p>The British police are not like the continental
<i>gendarmerie</i> or Gestapo, but I do not think [sic] one maligns
them in saying that, in the past, they have been unfriendly to
Left-wing activities. They have generally shown a tendency to side
with those whom they regarded as the defenders of private property.
Till quite recently "red" and "illegal" were almost synonymous, and
it was always the seller of, say the Daily Worker, never the seller
of say, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, who was moved on and generally
harassed. Apparently it can be the same, at any rate at moments,
under a Labour Government.</p>

<p>A thing I would like to know&mdash;it is a thing we hear very
little about&mdash;is what changes are made in the administrative
personnel when there has been a change of government.. Does a
police officer who has a vague notion that "Socialism" means
something against the law carry on just the same when the
government itself is Socialist?</p>

<p>When a Labour government takes over, I wonder what happens to
Scotland Yard Special Branch? To Military Intelligence? We are not
told, but such symptoms as there are do not suggest that any very
extensive shuffling is going on.</p>

<p>However, the main point of this episode is that the sellers of
newspapers and pamphlets should be interfered with at all. Which
particular minority is singled out&mdash;whether Pacifists,
Communists, Anarchists, Jehovah's Witness of the Legion of
Christian Reformers who recently declared Hitler to be Jesus
Christ&mdash;is a secondary matter. It is of symptomatic importance
that these people should have been arrested at that particular
spot. You are not allowed to sell literature inside Hyde Park, but
for many years past it has been usual for the paper-sellers to
station themselves outside the gates and distribute literature
connected with the open air meetings a hundred yards away. Every
kind of publication has been sold there without interference.</p>

<p>The degree of freedom of the press existing in this country is
often over-rated. Technically there is great freedom, but the fact
that most of the press is owned by a few people operates in much
the same way as State censorship. On the other hand, freedom of
speech is real. On a platform, or in certain recognised open air
spaces like Hyde Park, you can say almost anything, and, what is
perhaps more significant, no one is frightened to utter his true
opinions in pubs, on the tops of busses, and so forth.</p>

<p>The point is that the relative freedom which we enjoy depends of
public opinion. The law is no protection. Governments make laws,
but whether they are carried out, and how the police behave,
depends on the general temper in the country. If large numbers of
people are interested in freedom of speech, there will be freedom
of speech, even if the law forbids it; if public opinion is
sluggish, inconvenient minorities will be persecuted, even if laws
exist to protect them. The decline in the desire for individual
liberty has not been so sharp as I would have predicted six years
ago, when the war was starting, but still there has been a decline.
The notion that certain opinions cannot safely be allowed a hearing
is growing. It is given currency by intellectuals who confuse the
issue by not distinguishing between democratic opposition and open
rebellion, and it is reflected in our growing indifference to
tyranny and injustice abroad. And even those who declare themselves
to be in favour of freedom of opinion generally drop their claim
when it is their own adversaries who are being prosecutued.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that the arrest of five people for selling
harmless newspapers is a major calamity. When you see what is
happening in the world today, it hardly seems worth squealing about
such a tiny incident. All the same, it is not a good symptom that
such things should happen when the war is well over, and I should
feel happier if this and the long series of similar episodes that
have preceded it, were capable of raising a genuine popular
clamour, and not merely a mild flutter in sections of the minority
press.</p>

<h2>FUTURE OF A RUINED GERMANY (1945)</h2>

<p>As the advance into Germany continues and more and more of the
devastation wrought by the Allied bombing planes is laid bare,
there are three comments that almost every observer finds himself
making. The first is: 'The people at home have no conception of
this.' The second is, 'It's a miracle that they've gone on
fighting.' And the third is, 'Just think of the work of building
this all up again!'</p>

<p>It is quite true that the scale of the Allied blitzing of
Germany is even now not realised in this country, and its share in
the breaking-down of German resistance is probably much underrated.
It is difficult to give actuality to reports of air warfare and the
man in the street can be forgiven if he imagines that what we have
done to Germany over the past four years is merely the same kind of
thing they did to us in 1940.</p>

<p>But this error, which must be even commoner in the United
States, has in it a potential danger, and the many protests against
indiscriminate bombing which have been uttered by pacifists and
humanitarians have merely confused the issue.</p>

<p>Bombing is not especially inhumane. War itself is inhumane and
the bombing plane, which is used to paralyse industry and
transport, is a relatively civilised weapon. 'Normal' or
'legitimate' warfare is just as destructive of inanimate objects
and enormously so of human lives.</p>

<p>Moreover, a bomb kills a casual cross-section of the population,
whereas the men killed in battle are exactly the ones that the
community can least afford to lose. The people of Britain have
never felt easy about the bombing of civilians and no doubt they
will be ready enough to pity the Germans as soon as they have
definitely defeated them; but what they still have not
grasped&mdash;-thanks to their own comparative immunity&mdash;-is
the frightful destructiveness of modern war and the long period of
impoverishment that now lies ahead of the world as a whole.</p>

<p>To walk through the ruined cities of Germany is to feel an
actual doubt about the continuity of civilisation. For one has to
remember that it is not only Germany that has been blitzed. The
same desolation extends, at any rate in considerable patches, all
the way from Brussels to Stalingrad. And where there has been
ground fighting, the destruction is even more thorough. In the 300
miles or so between the Marne and the Rhine there is not such a
thing as a bridge or a viaduct that has not been blown up.</p>

<p>Even in England we are aware that we need three million houses,
and that the chances of getting them within measurable time seem
rather slender. But how many houses will Germany need, or Poland or
the USSR, or Italy? When one thinks of the stupendous task of
rebuilding hundreds of European cities, one realises that a long
period must elapse before even the standards of living of 1939 can
be re-established.</p>

<p>We do not yet know the full extent of the damage that has been
done to Germany but judging from the areas that have been overrun
hitherto, it is difficult to believe in the power of the Germans to
pay any kind of reparations, either in goods or in labour. Simply
to re-house the German people, to set the shattered factories
working, and to keep German agriculture from collapsing after the
foreign workers have been liberated, will use up all the labour
that the Germans are likely to dispose of.</p>

<p>If, as is planned, millions of them are to be deported for
reconstruction work, the recovery of Germany itself will be all the
slower. After the last war, the impossibility of obtaining
substantial money reparations was finally grasped, but it was less
generally realised that the impoverishment of any one country
reacts unfavourably on the world as a whole. It would be no
advantage to turn Germany into a kind of rural slum.</p>

<h2>GOOD BAD BOOKS</h2>

<p>Not long ago a publisher commissioned me to write an
introduction for a reprint of a novel by Leonard Merrick. This
publishing house, it appears, is going to reissue a long series of
minor and partly-forgotten novels of the twentieth century. It is a
valuable service in these bookless days, and I rather envy the
person whose job it will be to scout round the threepenny boxes,
hunting down copies of his boyhood favourites.</p>

<p>A type of book which we hardly seem to produce in these days,
but which flowered with great richness in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries, is what Chesterton called the "good bad
book": that is, the kind of book that has no literary pretensions
but which remains readable when more serious productions have
perished. Obviously outstanding books in this line are
<i>Raffles</i> and the Sherlock Holmes stories, which have kept
their place when innumerable "problem novels", "human documents"
and "terrible indictments" of this or that have fallen into
deserved oblivion. (Who has worn better, Conan Doyle or Meredith?)
Almost in the same class as these I, put R. Austin Freeman's
earlier stories&mdash;"The Singing Bone" "The Eye of Osiris" and
others&mdash;Ernest Bramah's <i>Max Carrados</i>, and, dropping the
standard a bit, Guy Boothby's Tibetan thriller, <i>Dr Nikola</i>, a
sort of schoolboy version of Hue's <i>Travels in Tartary</i>, which
would probably make a real visit to Central Asia seem a dismal
anticlimax.</p>

<p>But apart from thrillers, there were the minor humorous writers
of the period. For example, Pett Ridge-but I admit his full-length
books no longer seem readable&mdash;E. Nesbit (<i>The Treasure
Seekers</i>), George Birmingham, who was good so long as he kept
off politics, the pornographic Binstead ("Pitcher" of the <i>Pink
'un</i>), and, if American books can be included, Booth
Tarkington's Penrod stories. A cut above most of these was Barry
Pain. Some of Pain's humorous writings are, I suppose, still in
print, but to anyone who comes across it I recommend what must now
be a very rare book&mdash;<i>The Octave of Claudius</i>, a
brilliant exercise in the macabre. Somewhat later in time there was
Peter Blundell, who wrote in the W.W. Jacobs vein about Far Eastern
seaport towns, and who seems to be rather unaccountably forgotten,
in spite of having been praised in print by H.G. Wells.</p>

<p>However, all the books I have been speaking of are frankly
"escape" literature. They form pleasant patches in one's memory,
quiet corners where the mind can browse at odd moments, but they
hardly pretend to have anything to do with real life. There is
another kind of good bad book which is more seriously intended, and
which tells us, I think, something about the nature of the novel
and the reasons for its present decadence. During the last fifty
years there has been a whole series of writers&mdash;some of them
are still writing&mdash;whom it is quite impossible to call "good"
by any strictly literary standard, but who are natural novelists
and who seem to attain sincerity partly because they are not
inhibited by good taste. In this class I put Leonard Merrick
himself, W.L. George, J.D. Beresford, Ernest Raymond, May Sinclair,
and&mdash;at a lower level than the others but still essentially
similar&mdash;A.S.M. Hutchinson.</p>

<p>Most of these have been prolific writers, and their output has
naturally varied in quality. I am thinking in each case of one or
two outstanding books: for example, Merrick's <i>Cynthia</i>, J.D.
Beresford's <i>A Candidate For Truth</i>, W.L. George's
<i>Caliban</i>, May Sinclair's <i>The Combined Maze</i> and Ernest
Raymond's <i>We, The Accused</i>. In each of these books the author
has been able to identify himself with his imagined characters, to
feel with them and invite sympathy on their behalf, with a kind of
abandonment that cleverer people would find it difficult to
achieve. They bring out the fact that intellectual refinement can
be a disadvantage to a story-teller, as it would be to a music-hall
comedian.</p>

<p>Take, for example, Ernest Raymond's <i>We, The
Accused</i>&mdash;a peculiarly sordid and convincing murder story,
probably based on the Crippen case. I think it gains a great deal
from the fact that the author only partly grasps the pathetic
vulgarity of the people he is writing about, and therefore does not
despise them. Perhaps it even&mdash;like Theodore Dreiser's <i>An
American Tragedy</i>&mdash;gains something from the clumsy
long-winded manner in which it is written; detail is piled on
detail, with almost no attempt at selection, and in the process an
effect of terrible, grinding cruelty is slowly built up. So also
with <i>A Candidate For Truth</i>. Here there is not the same
clumsiness, but there is the same ability to take seriously the
problems of commonplace people. So also with <i>Cynthia</i> and at
any rate the earlier part of <i>Caliban</i>. The greater part of
what W.L. George wrote was shoddy rubbish, but in this particular
book, based on the career of Northcliffe, he achieved some
memorable and truthful pictures of lower-middle-class London life.
Parts of this book are probably autobiographical, and one of the
advantages of good bad writers is their lack of shame in writing
autobiography. Exhibitionism and self-pity are the bane of the
novelist, and yet if he is too frightened of them his creative gift
may suffer.</p>

<p>The existence of good bad literature&mdash;the fact that one can
be amused or excited or even moved by a book that one's intellect
simply refuses to take seriously&mdash;is a reminder that art is
not the same thing as cerebration. I imagine that by any test that
could be devised, Carlyle would be found to be a more intelligent
man than Trollope. Yet Trollope has remained readable and Carlyle
has not: with all his cleverness he had not even the wit to write
in plain straightforward English. In novelists, almost as much as
in poets, the connection between intelligence and creative power is
hard to establish. A good novelist may be a prodigy of
self-discipline like Flaubert, or he may be an intellectual sprawl
like Dickens. Enough talent to set up dozens of ordinary writers
has been poured into Wyndham Lewis's so-called novels, such as
<i>Tarr</i> or <i>Snooty Baronet</i>. Yet it would be a very heavy
labour to read one of these books right through. Some indefinable
quality, a sort of literary vitamin, which exists even in a book
like <i>If Winter Comes</i>, is absent from them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the supreme example of the "good bad" book is <i>Uncle
Tom's Cabin</i>. It is an unintentionally ludicrous book, full of
preposterous melodramatic incidents; it is also deeply moving and
essentially true; it is hard to say which quality outweighs the
other. But <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, after all, is trying to be
serious and to deal with the real world. How about the frankly
escapist writers, the purveyors of thrills and "light" humour? How
about <i>Sherlock Holmes, Vice Versa, Dracula, Helen's Babies</i>
or <i>King Solomon's Mines</i>? All of these are definitely absurd
books, books which one is more inclined to laugh <i>at</i> than
<i>with</i>, and which were hardly taken seriously even by their
authors; yet they have survived, and will probably continue to do
so. All one can say is that, while civilisation remains such that
one needs distraction from time to time, "light" literature has its
appointed place; also that there is such a thing as sheer skill, or
native grace, which may have more survival value than erudition or
intellectual power. There are music-hall songs which are better
poems than three-quarters of the stuff that gets into the
anthologies:</p>

<pre>
Come where the booze is cheaper,
Come where the pots hold more,
Come where the boss is a bit of a sport,
Come to the pub next door!
</pre>

<p>Or again:</p>

<pre>
Two lovely black eyes
Oh, what a surprise!
Only for calling another man wrong,
Two lovely black eyes!
</pre>

<p>I would far rather have written either of those than, say, "The
Blessed Damozel" or "Love in the Valley". And by the same token I
would back <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> to outlive the complete works
of Virginia Woolf or George Moore, though I know of no strictly
literary test which would show where the superiority lies.</p>

<h2>IN DEFENCE OF P. G. WODEHOUSE (1945)</h2>

<p>When the Germans made their rapid advance through Belgium in the
early summer of 1940, they captured, among other things, Mr. P. G.
Wodehouse, who had been living throughout the early part of the war
in his villa at Le Touquet, and seems not to have realised until
the last moment that he was in any danger. As he was led away into
captivity, he is said to have remarked, "Perhaps after this I shall
write a serious book." He was placed for the time being under house
arrest, and from his subsequent statements it appears that he was
treated in a fairly friendly way, German officers in the
neighbourhood frequently "dropping in for a bath or a party".</p>

<p>Over a year later, on 25th June 1941, the news came that
Wodehouse had been released from internment and was living at the
Adlon Hotel in Berlin. On the following day the public was
astonished to learn that he had agreed to do some broadcasts of a
"non-political" nature over the German radio. The full texts of
these broadcasts are not easy to obtain at this date, but Wodehouse
seems to have done five of them between 26th June and 2nd July,
when the Germans took him off the air again. The first broadcast,
on 26th June, was not made on the Nazi radio but took the form of
an interview with Harry Flannery, the representative of the
Columbia Broadcasting System, which still had its correspondents in
Berlin. Wodehouse also published in the <i>Saturday Evening
Post</i> an article which he had written while still in the
internment camp.</p>

<p>The article and the broadcasts dealt mainly with Wodehouse's
experiences in internment, but they did include a very few comments
on the war. The following are fair samples:</p>

<p>"I never was interested in politics. I'm quite unable to work up
any kind of belligerent feeling. Just as I'm about to feel
belligerent about some country I meet a decent sort of chap. We go
out together and lose any fighting thoughts or feelings."</p>

<p>"A short time ago they had a look at me on parade and got the
right idea; at least they sent us to the local lunatic asylum. And
I have been there forty-two weeks. There is a good deal to be said
for internment. It keeps you out of the saloon and helps you to
keep up with your reading. The chief trouble is that it means you
are away from home for a long time. When I join my wife I had
better take along a letter of introduction to be on the safe
side."</p>

<p>"In the days before the war I had always been modestly proud of
being an Englishman, but now that I have been some months resident
in this bin or repository of Englishmen I am not so sure... The
only concession I want from Germany is that she gives me a loaf of
bread, tells the gentlemen with muskets at the main gate to look
the other way, and leaves the rest to me. In return I am prepared
to hand over India, an autographed set of my books, and to reveal
the secret process of cooking sliced potatoes on a radiator. This
offer holds good till Wednesday week."</p>

<p>The first extract quoted above caused great offence. Wodehouse
was also censured for using (in the interview with Flannery) the
phrase "whether Britain wins the war or not," and he did not make
things better by describing in another broadcast the filthy habits
of some Belgian prisoners among whom he was interned. The Germans
recorded this broadcast and repeated it a number of times. They
seem to have supervised his talks very lightly, and they allowed
him not only to be funny about the discomforts of internment but to
remark that "the internees at Trost camp all fervently believe that
Britain will eventually win." The general upshot of the talks,
however, was that he had not been ill treated and bore no
malice.</p>

<p>These broadcasts caused an immediate uproar in England. There
were questions in Parliament, angry editorial comments in the
press, and a stream of letters from fellow-authors, nearly all of
them disapproving, though one or two suggested that it would be
better to suspend judgment, and several pleaded that Wodehouse
probably did not realise what he was doing. On 15th July, the Home
Service of the B.B.C. carried an extremely violent Postscript by
"Cassandra" of the <i>Daily Mirror</i>, accusing Wodehouse of
"selling his country." This postscript made free use of such
expressions as "Quisling" and "worshipping the Führer". The main
charge was that Wodehouse had agreed to do German propaganda as a
way of buying himself out of the internment camp.</p>

<p>"Cassandra's" Postscript caused a certain amount of protest, but
on the whole it seems to have intensified popular feeling against
Wodehouse. One result of it was that numerous lending libraries
withdrew Wodehouse's books from circulation. Here is a typical news
item:</p>

<p>"Within twenty-four hours of listening to the broadcast of
Cassandra, the <i>Daily Mirror</i> columnist, Portadown (North
Ireland) Urban District Council banned P. G. Wodehouse's books from
their public library. Mr. Edward McCann said that Cassandra's
broadcast had clinched the matter. Wodehouse was funny no longer."
(<i>Daily Mirror</i>.)</p>

<p>In addition the B.B.C. banned Wodehouse's lyrics from the air
and was still doing so a couple of years later. As late as December
1944 there were demands in Parliament that Wodehouse should be put
on trial as a traitor.</p>

<p>There is an old saying that if you throw enough mud some of it
will stick, and the mud has stuck to Wodehouse in a rather peculiar
way. An impression has been left behind that Wodehouse's talks (not
that anyone remembers what he said in them) showed him up not
merely as a traitor but as an ideological sympathiser with Fascism.
Even at the time several letters to the press claimed that "Fascist
tendencies" could be detected in his books, and the charge has been
repeated since. I shall try to analyse the mental atmosphere of
those books in a moment, but it is important to realise that the
events of 1941 do not convict Wodehouse of anything worse than
stupidity. The really interesting question is how and why he could
be so stupid. When Flannery met Wodehouse (released, but still
under guard) at the Adlon Hotel in June 1941, he saw at once that
he was dealing with a political innocent, and when preparing him
for their broadcast interview he had to warn him against making
some exceedingly unfortunate remarks, one of which was by
implication slightly anti-Russian. As it was, the phrase "whether
England wins or not" did get through. Soon after the interview
Wodehouse told him that he was also going to broadcast on the Nazi
radio, apparently not realising that this action had any special
significance. Flannery comments [<i>Assignment to Berlin</i> by
Harry W. Flannery.]:</p>

<p>"By this time the Wodehouse plot was evident. It was one of the
best Nazi publicity stunts of the war, the first with a human
angle...Plack (Goebbels's assistant) had gone to the camp near
Gleiwitz to see Wodehouse, found that the author was completely
without political sense, and had an idea. He suggested to Wodehouse
that in return for being released from the prison camp he write a
series of broadcasts about his experiences; there would be no
censorship and he would put them on the air himself. In making that
proposal Plack showed that he knew his man. He knew that Wodehouse
made fun of the English in all his stories and that he seldom wrote
in any other way, that he was still living in the period about
which he wrote and had no conception of Nazism and all it meant.
Wodehouse was his own Bertie Wooster."</p>

<p>The striking of an actual bargain between Wodehouse and Plack
seems to be merely Flannery's own interpretation. The arrangement
may have been of a much less definite kind, and to judge from the
broadcasts themselves, Wodehouse's main idea in making them was to
keep in touch with his public and&mdash;the comedian's ruling
passion&mdash;to get a laugh. Obviously they are not the utterances
of a Quisling of the type of Ezra Pound or John Amery, nor,
probably, of a person capable of understanding the nature of
Quislingism. Flannery seems to have warned Wodehouse that it would
be unwise to broadcast, but not very forcibly. He adds that
Wodehouse (though in one broadcast he refers to himself as an
Englishman) seemed to regard himself as an American citizen. He had
contemplated naturalisation, but had never filled in the necessary
papers. He even used, to Flannery, the phrase, "We're not at war
with Germany."</p>

<p>I have before me a bibliography of P. G. Wodehouse's works. It
names round about fifty books, but is certainly incomplete. It is
as well to be honest, and I ought to start by admitting that there
are many books by Wodehouse perhaps a quarter or a third of the
total&mdash;which I have not read. It is not, indeed, easy to read
the whole output of a popular writer who is normally published in
cheap editions. But I have followed his work fairly closely since
1911, when I was eight years old, and am well acquainted with its
peculiar mental atmosphere&mdash;an atmosphere which has not, of
course, remained completely unchanged, but shows little alteration
since about 1925. In the passage from Flannery's book which I
quoted above there are two remarks which would immediately strike
any attentive reader of Wodehouse. One is to the effect that
Wodehouse "was still living in the period about which he wrote,"
and the other that the Nazi Propaganda Ministry made use of him
because he "made fun of the English." The second statement is based
on a misconception to which I will return presently. But Flannery's
other comment is quite true and contains in it part of the clue to
Wodehouse's behaviour.</p>

<p>A thing that people often forget about P. G. Wodehouse's novels
is how long ago the better-known of them were written. We think of
him as in some sense typifying the silliness of the
nineteen-twenties and nineteen-thirties, but in fact the scenes and
characters by which he is best remembered had all made their
appearance before 1925. Psmith first appeared in 1909, having been
foreshadowed by other characters in early school stories. Blandings
Castle, with Baxter and the Earl of Emsworth both in residence, was
introduced in 1915. The Jeeves-Wooster cycle began in 1919, both
Jeeves and Wooster having made brief appearances earlier. Ukridge
appeared in 1924. When one looks through the list of Wodehouse's
books from 1902 onwards, one can observe three fairly well-marked
periods. The first is the school-story period. It includes such
books as <i>The Gold Bat, The Pothunters</i>, etc and has its
high-spot in <i>Mike</i> (1909). <i>Psmith In The City</i>,
published in the following year, belongs in this category, though
it is not directly concerned with school life. The next is the
American period. Wodehouse seems to have lived in the United States
from about 1913 to 1920, and for a while showed signs of
<i>becoming americanised in idiom and outlook</i>. Ssome of the
stories in <i>The Man With Two Left Feet</i> (1917) appear to have
been influenced by O. Henry, and other books written about this
time contain Americanisms (e.g. "highball" for "whisky and soda")
which an Englishman would not normally use <i>in propria
persona</i>. Nevertheless, almost all the books of this
period&mdash;<i>Psmith, Journalist; The Little Nugget; The
Indiscretions of Archie; Piccadilly Jim</i> and various
others-depend for their effect on the <i>contrast</i> between
English and American manners. English characters appear in an
American setting, or vice versa: there is a certain number of
purely English stories, but hardly any purely American ones. The
third period might fitly be called the country-house period. By the
early nineteen-twenties Wodehouse must have been making a very
large income, and the social status of his characters moved upwards
accordingly, though the Ukridge stories form a partial exception.
The typical setting is now a country mansion, a luxurious bachelor
flat or an expensive golf club. The schoolboy athleticism of the
earlier books fades out, cricket and football giving way to golf,
and the element of farce and burlesque becomes more marked. No
doubt many of the later books, such as <i>Summer Lightning</i>, are
light comedy rather than pure farce, but the occasional attempts at
moral earnestness which can be found in <i>Psmith, Journalist; The
Little Nugget; The Coming of Bill, The Man With Two Left Feet</i>
and some of the school stories, no longer appear. Mike Jackson has
turned into Bertie Wooster. That, however, is not a very startling
metamorphosis, and one of the most noticeable things about
Wodehouse is his <i>lack</i> of development. Books like <i>The Gold
Bat</i> and <i>Tales Of St Austin's</i>, written in the opening
years of this century, already have the familiar atmosphere. How
much of a formula the writing of his later books had become one can
see from the fact that he continued to write stories of English
life although throughout the sixteen years before his internment he
was living at Hollywood and Le Touquet.</p>

<p>Mike, which is now a difficult book to obtain in an unabridged
form, must be one of the best "light" school stories in English.
But though its incidents are largely farcical, it is by no means a
satire on the public school system, and <i>The Gold Bat, The
Pothunters</i>, etc are even less so. Wodehouse was educated at
Dulwich, and then worked in a bank and graduated into novel writing
by way of very cheap journalism. It is clear that for many years he
remained "fixated" on his old school and loathed the unromantic job
and the lower-middle-class surroundings in which he found himself.
In the early stories the "glamour" of public school life (house
matches, fagging, teas round the study fire, etc) is laid on fairly
thick, and the "play the game" code of morals is accepted with not
many reservations. Wrykyn, Wodehouse's imaginary public school, is
a school of a more fashionable type than Dulwich, and one gets the
impression that between <i>The Gold Bat</i> (1904) and <i>Mike</i>
(1908) Wrykyn itself has become more expensive and moved farther
from London. Psychologically the most revealing book of Wodehouse's
early period is <i>Psmith in the City</i>. Mike Jackson's father
has suddenly lost his money, and Mike, like Wodehouse himself, is
thrust at the age of about eighteen into an ill-paid subordinate
job in a bank. Psmith is similarly employed, though not from
financial necessity. Both this book and <i>Psmith, Journalist</i>
(1915) are unusual in that they display a certain amount of
political consciousness. Psmith at this stage chooses to call
himself a Socialist-in his mind, and no doubt in Wodehouse's, this
means no more than ignoring class distinctions-and on one occasion
the two boys attend an open-air meeting on Clapham Common and go
home to tea with an elderly Socialist orator, whose shabby-genteel
home is described with some accuracy. But the most striking feature
of the book is Mike's inability to wean himself from the atmosphere
of school. He enters upon his job without any pretence of
enthusiasm, and his main desire is not, as one might expect, to
find a more interesting and useful job, but simply to be playing
cricket. When he has to find himself lodgings he chooses to settle
at Dulwich, because there he will be near a school and will be able
to hear the agreeable sound of the ball striking against the bat.
The climax of the book comes when Mike gets the chance to play in a
county match and simply walks out of his job in order to do so. The
point is that Wodehouse here sympathises with Mike: indeed he
identified himself with him, for it is clear enough that Mike bears
the same relation to Wodehouse as Julien Sorel to Stendhal. But he
created many other heroes essentially similar. Through the books of
this and the next period there passes a whole series of young men
to whom playing games and "keeping fit" are a sufficient life-work.
Wodehouse is almost incapable of imagining a desirable job. The
great thing is to have money of your own, or, failing that, to find
a sinecure. The hero of <i>Something Fresh</i> (1915) escapes from
low-class journalism by becoming physical-training instructor to a
dyspeptic millionaire: this is regarded as a step up, morally as
well as financially.</p>

<p>In the books of the third period there is no narcissism and no
serious interludes, but the implied moral and social background has
changed much less than might appear at first sight. If one compares
Bertie Wooster with Mike, or even with the rugger-playing prefects
of the earliest school stories, one sees that the only real
difference between them is that Bertie is richer and lazier. His
ideals would be almost the same as theirs, but he fails to live up
to them. Archie Moffam, in <i>The Indiscretions Of Archie</i>
(1921), is a type intermediate between Bertie and the earlier
heroes: he is an ass, but he is also honest, kind-hearted, athletic
and courageous. From first to last Wodehouse takes the
public-school code of behaviour for granted, with the difference
that in his later, more sophisticated period he prefers to show his
characters violating it or living up to it against their will:</p>

<pre>
"Bertie! You wouldn't let down a pal?"
"Yes, I would."
"But we were at school together, Bertie."
"I don't care."
"The old school, Bertie, the old school!"
"Oh, well&mdash;dash it!"
</pre>

<p>Bertie, a sluggish Don Quixote, has no wish to tilt at
windmills, but he would hardly think of refusing to do so when
honour calls. Most of the people whom Wodehouse intends as
sympathetic characters are parasites, and some of them are plain
imbeciles, but very few of them could be described as immoral. Even
Ukridge is a visionary rather than a plain crook. The most immoral,
or rather un-moral, of Wodehouse's characters is Jeeves, who acts
as a foil to Bertie Wooster's comparative high-mindedness and
perhaps symbolises the widespread English belief that intelligence
and unscrupulousness are much the same thing. How closely Wodehouse
sticks to conventional morality can be seen from the fact that
nowhere in his books is there anything in the nature of a sex joke.
This is an enormous sacrifice for a farcical writer to make. Not
only are there no dirty jokes, but there are hardly any
compromising situations: the horns-on-the-forehead motif is almost
completely avoided. Most of the full-length books, of course,
contain a "love interest", but it is always at the light-comedy
level: the love affair, with its complications and its idyllic
scenes, goes on and on, but, as the saying goes "nothing happens".
It is significant that Wodehouse, by nature a writer of farces, was
able to collaborate more than once with Ian Hay, a serio-comic
writer and an exponent (<i>Vide Pip</i>, etc.) of the "clean-living
Englishman" tradition at its silliest.</p>

<p>In <i>Something Fresh</i> Wodehouse had discovered the comic
possibilities of the English aristocracy, and a succession of
ridiculous but, save in a very few instances, not actually
contemptible barons, earls and what-not followed accordingly. This
had the rather curious effect of causing Wodehouse to be regarded,
outside England, as a penetrating satirist of English society.
Hence Flannery's statement that Wodehouse "made fun of the
English," which is the impression he would probably make on a
German or even an American reader. Some time after the broadcasts
from Berlin I was discussing them with a young Indian Nationalist
who defended Wodehouse warmly. He took it for granted that
Wodehouse <i>had</i> gone over to the enemy, which from his own
point of view was the right thing to do. But what interested me was
to find that he regarded Wodehouse as an anti-British writer who
had done useful work by showing up the British aristocracy in their
true colours. This is a mistake that it would be very difficult for
an English person to make, and is a good instance of the way in
which books, especially humorous books, lose their finer nuances
when they reach a foreign audience. For it is clear enough that
Wodehouse is not anti-British, and not anti-upper class either. On
the contrary, a harmless old-fashioned snobbishness is perceptible
all through his work. Just as an intelligent Catholic is able to
see that the blasphemies of Baudelaire or James Joyce are not
seriously damaging to the Catholic faith, so an English reader can
see that in creating such characters as Hildebrand Spencer Poyns de
Burgh John Hanneyside Coombe-Crombie, 12th Earl of Dreever,
Wodehouse is not really attacking the social hierarchy. Indeed, no
one who genuinely despised titles would write of them so much.
Wodehouse's attitude towards the English social system is the same
as his attitude towards the public-school moral code&mdash;a mild
facetiousness covering an unthinking acceptance. The Earl of
Emsworth is funny because an earl ought to have more dignity, and
Bertie Wooster's helpless dependence on Jeeves is funny partly
because the servant ought not to be superior to the master. An
American reader can mistake these two, and others like them, for
hostile caricatures, because he is inclined to be Anglophobe
already and they correspond to his preconceived ideas about a
decadent aristocracy. Bertie Wooster, with his spats and his cane,
is the traditional stage Englishman. But, as any English reader
would see, Wodehouse intends him as a sympathetic figure, and
Wodehouse's real sin has been to present the English upper classes
as much nicer people than they are. All through his books certain
problems are constantly avoided. Almost without exception his
moneyed young men are unassuming, good mixers, not avaricious:
their tone is set for them by Psmith, who retains his own
upper-class exterior but bridges the social gap by addressing
everyone as "Comrade".</p>

<p>But there is another important point about Bertie Wooster: his
out-of-dateness. Conceived in 1917 or thereabouts, Bertie really
belongs to an epoch earlier than that. He is the "knut" of the
pre-1914 period, celebrated in such songs as "Gilbert the Filbert"
or "Reckless Reggie of the Regent's Palace". The kind of life that
Wodehouse writes about by preference, the life of the "clubman" or
"man about town", the elegant young man who lounges all the morning
in Piccadilly with a cane under his arm and a carnation in his
buttonhole, barely survived into the nineteen-twenties. It is
significant that Wodehouse could publish in 1936 a book entitled
<i>Young Men in Spats</i>. For who was wearing spats at that date?
They had gone out of fashion quite ten years earlier. But the
traditional "knut", the "Piccadilly Johnny", <i>ought</i> to wear
spats, just as the pantomime Chinese ought to wear a pigtail. A
humorous writer is not obliged to keep up to date, and having
struck one or two good veins, Wodehouse continued to exploit them
with a regularity that was no doubt all the easier because he did
not set foot in England during the sixteen years that preceded his
internment. His picture of English society had been formed before
1914, and it was a naive, traditional and, at bottom, admiring
picture. Nor did he ever become genuinely Americanised. As I have
pointed out, spontaneous Americanisms do occur in the books of the
middle period, but Wodehouse remained English enough to find
American slang an amusing and slightly shocking novelty. He loves
to thrust a slang phrase or a crude fact in among Wardour Street
English ("With a hollow groan Ukridge borrowed five shillings from
me and went out into the night"), and expressions like "a piece of
cheese" or "bust him on the noggin" lend themselves to this
purpose. But the trick had been developed before he made any
American contacts, and his use of garbled quotations is a common
device of English writers running back to Fielding. As Mr John
Hayward has pointed out, [Note, below] Wodehouse owes a good deal
to his knowledge of English literature and especially of
Shakespeare. His books are aimed, not, obviously, at a highbrow
audience, but at an audience educated along traditional lines.
When, for instance, he describes somebody as heaving "the kind of
sigh that Prometheus might have heaved when the vulture dropped in
for its lunch", he is assuming that his readers will know something
of Greek mythology. In his early days the writers he admired were
probably Barry Pain, Jerome K. Jerome, W. W. Jacobs, Kipling and F.
Anstey, and he has remained closer to them than to the quick moving
American comic writers such as Ring Lardner or Damon Runyon. In his
radio interview with Flannery, Wodehouse wondered whether "the kind
of people and the kind of England I write about will live after the
war", not realising that they were ghosts already. "He was still
living in the period about which he wrote," says Flannery, meaning,
probably, the nineteen-twenties. But the period was really the
Edwardian age, and Bertie Wooster, if he ever existed, was killed
round about 1915.</p>

<p>[Note: "P. G. Wodehouse" by John Hayward. (The Saturday Book,
1942.) I believe this is the only full-length critical essay on
Wodehouse. (Author's footnote.)]</p>

<p>If my analysis of Wodehouse's mentality is accepted, the idea
that in 1941 he consciously aided the Nazi propaganda machine
becomes untenable and even ridiculous. He <i>may</i> have been
induced to broadcast by the promise of an earlier release (he was
due for release a few months later, on reaching his sixtieth
birthday), but he cannot have realised that what he did would be
damaging to British interests. As I have tried to show, his moral
outlook has remained that of a public-school boy, and according to
the public-school code, treachery in time of war is the most
unforgivable of all the sins. But how could he fail to grasp that
what he did would be a big propaganda score for the Germans and
would bring down a torrent of disapproval on his own head? To
answer this one must take two things into consideration. First,
Wodehouse's complete lack&mdash;so far as one can judge from his
printed works&mdash;of political awareness. It is nonsense to talk
of "Fascist tendencies" in his books. There are no post-1918
tendencies at all. Throughout his work there is a certain uneasy
awareness of the problem of class distinctions, and scattered
through it at various dates there are ignorant though not
unfriendly references to Socialism. In <i>The Heart Of A Goof</i>
(1926) there is a rather silly story about a Russian novelist,
which seems to have been inspired by the factional struggle then
raging in the U.S.S.R. But the references in it to the Soviet
system are entirely frivolous and, considering the date, not
markedly hostile. That is about the extent of Wodehouse's political
consciousness, so far as it is discoverable from his writings.
Nowhere, so far as I know, does he so much as use the word
"Fascism" or "Nazism." In left-wing circles, indeed in
"enlightened" circles of any kind, to broadcast on the Nazi radio,
to have any truck with the Nazis whatever, would have seemed just
as shocking an action before the war as during it. But that is a
habit of mind that had been developed during nearly a decade of
ideological struggle against Fascism. The bulk of the British
people, one ought to remember, remained anaesthetic to that
struggle until late into 1940. Abyssinia, Spain, China, Austria,
Czechoslovakia&mdash;the long series of crimes and aggressions had
simply slid past their consciousness or were dimly noted as
quarrels occurring among foreigners and "not our business." One can
gauge the general ignorance from the fact that the ordinary
Englishman thought of "Fascism" as an exclusively Italian thing and
was bewildered when the same word was applied to Germany. And there
is nothing in Wodehouse's writings to suggest that he was better
informed, or more interested in politics, than the general run of
his readers.</p>

<p>The other thing one must remember is that Wodehouse happened to
be taken prisoner at just the moment when the war reached its
desperate phase. We forget these things now, but until that time
feelings about the war had been noticeably tepid. There was hardly
any fighting, the Chamberlain Government was unpopular, eminent
publicists were hinting that we should make a compromise peace as
quickly as possible, trade union and Labour Party branches all over
the country were passing anti-war resolutions. Afterwards, of
course, things changed. The Army was with difficulty extricated
from Dunkirk, France collapsed, Britain was alone, the bombs rained
on London, Goebbels announced that Britain was to be "reduced to
degradation and poverty". By the middle of 1941 the British people
knew what they were up against and feelings against the enemy were
far fiercer than before. But Wodehouse had spent the intervening
year in internment, and his captors seem to have treated him
reasonably well. He had missed the turning-point of the war, and in
1941 he was still reacting in terms of 1939. He was not alone in
this. On several occasions about this time the Germans brought
captured British soldiers to the microphone, and some of them made
remarks at least as tactless as Wodehouse's. They attracted no
attention, however. And even an outright Quisling like John Amery
was afterwards to arouse much less indignation than Wodehouse had
done.</p>

<p>But why? Why should a few rather silly but harmless remarks by
an elderly novelist have provoked such an outcry? One has to look
for the probable answer amid the dirty requirements of propaganda
warfare.</p>

<p>There is one point about the Wodehouse broadcasts that is almost
certainly significant&mdash;the date. Wodehouse was released two or
three days before the invasion of the U.S.S.R., and at a time when
the higher ranks of the Nazi party must have known that the
invasion was imminent. It was vitally necessary to keep America out
of the war as long as possible, and in fact, about this time, the
German attitude towards the U.S.A. did become more conciliatory
than it had been before. The Germans could hardly hope to defeat
Russia, Britain and the U.S.A. in combination, but if they could
polish off Russia quickly&mdash;and presumably they expected to do
so&mdash;the Americans might never intervene. The release of
Wodehouse was only a minor move, but it was not a bad sop to throw
to the American isolationists. He was well known in the United
States, and he was&mdash;or so the Germans calculated&mdash;popular
with the Anglophobe public as a caricaturist who made fun of the
silly-ass Englishman with his spats and his monocle. At the
microphone he could be trusted to damage British prestige in one
way or another, while his release would demonstrate that the
Germans were good fellows and knew how to treat their enemies
chivalrously. That presumably was the calculation, though the fact
that Wodehouse was only broadcasting for about a week suggests that
he did not come up to expectations.</p>

<p>But on the British side similar though opposite calculations
were at work. For the two years following Dunkirk, British morale
depended largely upon the feeling that this was not only a war for
democracy but a war which the common people had to win by their own
efforts. The upper classes were discredited by their appeasement
policy and by the disasters of 1940, and a social levelling process
appeared to be taking place. Patriotism and left-wing sentiments
were associated in the popular mind, and numerous able journalists
were at work to tie the association tighter. Priestley's 1940
broadcasts, and "Cassandra's" articles in the <i>Daily Mirror</i>,
were good examples of the demagogic propaganda flourishing at that
time. In this atmosphere, Wodehouse made an ideal whipping-boy. For
it was generally felt that the rich were treacherous, and
Wodehouse&mdash;as "Cassandra" vigorously pointed out in his
broadcast&mdash;was a rich man. But he was the kind of rich man who
could be attacked with impunity and without risking any damage to
the structure of society. To denounce Wodehouse was not like
denouncing, say, Beaverbrook. A mere novelist, however large his
earnings may happen to be, is not <i>of</i> the possessing class.
Even if his income touches &pound;50,000 a year he has only the
outward semblance of a millionaire. He is a lucky outsider who has
fluked into a fortune&mdash;usually a very temporary
fortune&mdash;like the winner of the Calcutta Derby Sweep.
Consequently, Wodehouse's indiscretion gave a good propaganda
opening. It was a chance to "expose" a wealthy parasite without
drawing attention to any of the parasites who really mattered.</p>

<p>In the desperate circumstances of the time, it was excusable to
be angry at what Wodehouse did, but to go on denouncing him three
or four years later&mdash;and more, to let an impression remain
that he acted with conscious treachery&mdash;is not excusable. Few
things in this war have been more morally disgusting than the
present hunt after traitors and Quislings. At best it is largely
the punishment of the guilty by the guilty. In France, all kinds of
petty rats&mdash;police officials, penny-a-lining journalists,
women who have slept with German soldiers&mdash;are hunted down
while almost without exception the big rats escape. In England the
fiercest tirades against Quislings are uttered by Conservatives who
were practising appeasement in 1938 and Communists who were
advocating it in 1940. I have striven to show how the wretched
Wodehouse&mdash;just because success and expatriation had allowed
him to remain mentally in the Edwardian age&mdash;became the
<i>corpus vile</i> in a propaganda experiment, and I suggest that
it is now time to regard the incident as closed. If Ezra Pound is
caught and shot by the American authorities, it will have the
effect of establishing his reputation as a poet for hundreds of
years; and even in the case of Wodehouse, if we drive him to retire
to the United States and renounce his British citizenship, we shall
end by being horribly ashamed of ourselves. Meanwhile, if we really
want to punish the people who weakened national morale at critical
moments, there are other culprits who are nearer home and better
worth chasing.</p>

<h2>NONSENSE POETRY</h2>

<p>In many languages, it is said, there is no nonsense poetry, and
there is not a great deal of it even in English. The bulk of it is
in nursery rhymes and scraps of folk poetry, some of which may not
have been strictly nonsensical at the start, but have become so
because their original application has been forgotten. For example,
the rhyme about Margery Daw:</p>

<pre>
See-saw, Margery Daw,
Dobbin shall have a new master.
He shall have but a penny a day
Because he can't go any faster.
</pre>

<p>Or the other version that I learned in Oxfordshire as a little
boy:</p>

<pre>
See-saw, Margery Daw,
Sold her bed and lay upon straw.
Wasn't she a silly slut
To sell her bed and lie upon dirt?
</pre>

<p>It may be that there was once a real person called Margery Daw,
and perhaps there was even a Dobbin who somehow came into the
story. When Shakespeare makes Edgar in <i>King Lear</i> quote
"Pillicock sat on Pillicock hill", and similar fragments, he is
uttering nonsense, but no doubt these fragments come from forgotten
ballads in which they once had a meaning. The typical scrap of folk
poetry which one quotes almost unconsciously is not exactly
nonsense but a sort of musical comment on some recurring event,
such as "One a penny, two a penny, Hot-Cross buns", or "Polly, put
the kettle on, we'll all have tea". Some of these seemingly
frivolous rhymes actually express a deeply pessimistic view of
life, the churchyard wisdom of the peasant. For instance:</p>

<pre>
Solomon Grundy,
Born on Monday,
Christened on Tuesday,
Married on Wednesday,
Took ill on Thursday,
Worse on Friday,
Died on Saturday,
Buried on Sunday,
And that was the end of Solomon Grundy.
</pre>

<p>which is a gloomy story, but remarkably similar to yours or
mine.</p>

<p>Until Surrealism made a deliberate raid on the unconscious,
poetry that aimed at being nonsense, apart from the meaningless
refrains of songs, does not seem to have been common. This gives a
special position to Edward Lear, whose nonsense rhymes have just
been edited by Mr R.L. Megroz, who was also responsible for the
Penguin edition a year or two before the war. Lear was one of the
first writers to deal in pure fantasy, with imaginary countries and
made-up words, without any satirical purpose. His poems are not all
of them equally nonsensical; some of them get their effect by a
perversion of logic, but they are all alike in that their
underlying feeling is sad and not bitter. They express a kind of
amiable lunacy, a natural sympathy with whatever is weak and
absurd. Lear could fairly be called the originator of the limerick,
though verses in almost the same metrical form are to be found in
earlier writers, and what is sometimes considered a weakness in his
limericks&mdash;that is, the fact that the rhyme is the same in the
first and last lines&mdash;is part of their charm. The very slight
change increases the impression of ineffectuality, which might be
spoiled if there were some striking surprise. For example:</p>

<pre>
There was a young lady of Portugal
Whose ideas were excessively nautical;
She climbed up a tree
To examine the sea,
But declared she would never leave Portugal.
</pre>

<p>It is significant that almost no limericks since Lear's have
been both printable and funny enough to seem worth quoting. But he
is really seen at his best in certain longer poems, such as "The
Owl and the Pussy-Cat" or "The Courtship of the
Yonghy-Bonghy-B&ograve;":</p>

<pre>
On the Coast of Coromandel,
Where the early pumpkins blow,
In the middle of the woods
Lived the Yonghy-Bonghy-B&ograve;.
Two old chairs, and half a candle
One old jug without a handle
These were all his worldly goods:
In the middle of the woods,
These were all the worldly goods
Of the Yonghy-Bonghy-B&ograve;,
Of the Yonghy-Bonghy-B&ograve;.
</pre>

<p>Later there appears a lady with some white Dorking hens, and an
inconclusive love affair follows. Mr Megroz thinks, plausibly
enough, that this may refer to some incident in Lear's own life. He
never married, and it is easy to guess that there was something
seriously wrong in his sex life. A psychiatrist could no doubt find
all kinds of significance in his drawings and in the recurrence of
certain made-up words such as "runcible". His health was bad, and
as he was the youngest of twenty-one children in a poor family, he
must have known anxiety and hardship in very early life. It is
clear that he was unhappy and by nature solitary, in spite of
having good friends.</p>

<p>Aldous Huxley, in praising Lear's fantasies as a sort of
assertion of freedom, has pointed out that the "They" of the
limericks represent common sense, legality and the duller virtues
generally. "They" are the realists, the practical men, the sober
citizens in bowler hats who are always anxious to stop you doing
anything worth doing. For instance:</p>

<pre>
There was an Old Man of Whitehaven,
Who danced a quadrille with a raven;
But they said, "It's absurd
To encourage this bird!"
So they smashed that Old Man of Whitehaven.
</pre>

<p>To smash somebody just for dancing a quadrille with a raven is
exactly the kind of thing that "They" would do. Herbert Read has
also praised Lear, and is inclined to prefer his verse to that of
Lewis Carroll, as being purer fantasy. For myself, I must say that
I find Lear funniest when he is least arbitrary and when a touch of
burlesque or perverted logic makes its appearance. When he gives
his fancy free play, as in his imaginary names, or in things like
"Three Receipts for Domestic Cookery", he can be silly and
tiresome. "The Pobble Who Has No Toes" is haunted by the ghost of
logic, and I think it is the element of sense in it that makes it
funny. The Pobble, it may be remembered, went fishing in the
Bristol Channel:</p>

<p>And all the Sailors and Admirals cried, When they saw him
nearing the further side&mdash; "He has gone to fish, for his Aunt
Jobiska's Runcible Cat with crimson whiskers!"</p>

<p>The thing that is funny here is the burlesque touch, the
Admirals. What is arbitrary&mdash;the word "runcible", and the
cat's crimson whiskers&mdash;is merely rather embarrassing. While
the Pobble was in the water some unidentified creatures came and
ate his toes off, and when he got home his aunt remarked:</p>

<pre>
"It's a fact the whole world knows,
That Pobbles are happier without their toes,"
</pre>

<p>which once again is funny because it has a meaning, and one
might even say a political significance. For the whole theory of
authoritarian governments is summed up in the statement that
Pobbles were happier without their toes. So also with the
well-known limerick:</p>

<pre>
There was an Old Person of Basing,
Whose presence of mind was amazing;
He purchased a steed,
Which he rode at full speed,
And escaped from the people of Basing.
</pre>

<p>It is not quite arbitrary. The funniness is in the gentle
implied criticism of the people of Basing, who once again are
"They", the respectable ones, the right-thinking, art-hating
majority.</p>

<p>The writer closest to Lear among his contemporaries was Lewis
Carroll, who, however, was less essentially fantastic&mdash;and, in
my opinion, funnier. Since then, as Mr Megroz points out in his
Introduction, Lear's influence has been considerable, but it is
hard to believe that it has been altogether good. The silly
whimsiness of present-day children's books could perhaps be partly
traced back to him. At any rate, the idea of deliberately setting
out to write nonsense, though it came off in Lear's case, is a
doubtful one. Probably the best nonsense poetry is produced
gradually and accidentally, by communities rather than by
individuals. As a comic draughtsman, on the other hand, Lear's
influence must have been beneficial. James Thurber, for instance,
must surely owe something to Lear, directly or indirectly.</p>

<h2>NOTES ON NATIONALISM (1945)</h2>

<p>Somewhere or other Byron makes use of the French word
<i>longeur</i>, and remarks in passing that though in England we
happen not to have the <i>word</i>, we have the <i>thing</i> in
considerable profusion. In the same way, there is a habit of mind
which is now so widespread that it affects our thinking on nearly
every subject, but which has not yet been given a name. As the
nearest existing equivalent I have chosen the word 'nationalism',
but it will be seen in a moment that I am not using it in quite the
ordinary sense, if only because the emotion I am speaking about
does not always attach itself to what is called a nation&mdash;that
is, a single race or a geographical area. It can attach itself to a
church or a class, or it may work in a merely negative sense,
<i>against</i> something or other and without the need for any
positive object of loyalty.</p>

<p>By 'nationalism' I mean first of all the habit of assuming that
human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks
of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently
labelled 'good' or 'bad'.[See note, below] But secondly&mdash;and
this is much more important&mdash;I mean the habit of identifying
oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good
and evil and recognising no other duty than that of advancing its
interests. Nationalism is not to be confused with patriotism. Both
words are normally used in so vague a way that any definition is
liable to be challenged, but one must draw a distinction between
them, since two different and even opposing ideas are involved. By
'patriotism' I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular
way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has
no wish to force on other people. Patriotism is of its nature
defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the
other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding
purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more
prestige, <i>not</i> for himself but for the nation or other unit
in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.</p>

<p>[Note: Nations, and even vaguer entities such as Catholic Church
or the proleteriat, are commonly thought of as individuals and
often referred to as 'she'. Patently absurd remarks such as
'Germany is naturally treacherous' are to be found in any newspaper
one opens and reckless generalization about national character
('The Spaniard is a natural aristocrat' or 'Every Englishman is a
hypocrite') are uttered by almost everyone. Intermittently these
generalizations are seen to be unfounded, but the habit of making
them persists, and people of professedly international outlook,
e.g., Tolstoy or Bernard Shaw, are often guilty of them. (Author's
footnote)]</p>

<p>So long as it is applied merely to the more notorious and
identifiable nationalist movements in Germany, Japan, and other
countries, all this is obvious enough. Confronted with a phenomenon
like Nazism, which we can observe from the outside, nearly all of
us would say much the same things about it. But here I must repeat
what I said above, that I am only using the word 'nationalism' for
lack of a better. Nationalism, in the extended sense in which I am
using the word, includes such movements and tendencies as
Communism, political Catholicism, Zionism, Antisemitism, Trotskyism
and Pacifism. It does not necessarily mean loyalty to a government
or a country, still less to <i>one's own</i> country, and it is not
even strictly necessary that the units in which it deals should
actually exist. To name a few obvious examples, Jewry, Islam,
Christendom, the Proletariat and the White Race are all of them
objects of passionate nationalistic feeling: but their existence
can be seriously questioned, and there is no definition of any one
of them that would be universally accepted.</p>

<p>It is also worth emphasising once again that nationalist feeling
can be purely negative. There are, for example, Trotskyists who
have become simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a
corresponding loyalty to any other unit. When one grasps the
implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism
becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks
solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a
positive or a negative nationalist&mdash;that is, he may use his
mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating&mdash;but at any
rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and
humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as
the endless rise and decline of great power units, and every event
that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on
the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally,
it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of
success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply
ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked
his side, he persuades himself that it <i>is</i> the strongest, and
is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are
overwhelmingly against him. Nationalism is power-hunger tempered by
self-deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant
dishonesty, but he is also&mdash;since he is conscious of serving
something bigger than himself&mdash;unshakeably certain of being in
the right.</p>

<p>Now that I have given this lengthy definition, I think it will
be admitted that the habit of mind I am talking about is widespread
among the English intelligentsia, and more widespread there than
among the mass of the people. For those who feel deeply about
contemporary politics, certain topics have become so infected by
considerations of prestige that a genuinely rational approach to
them is almost impossible. Out of the hundreds of examples that one
might choose, take this question: Which of the three great allies,
the U.S.S.R., Britain and the USA, has contributed most to the
defeat of Germany? In theory, it should be possible to give a
reasoned and perhaps even a conclusive answer to this question. In
practice, however, the necessary calculations cannot be made,
because anyone likely to bother his head about such a question
would inevitably see it in terms of competitive prestige. He would
therefore <i>start</i> by deciding in favour of Russia, Britain or
America as the case might be, and only <i>after</i> this would
begin searching for arguments that seemed to support his case. And
there are whole strings of kindred questions to which you can only
get an honest answer from someone who is indifferent to the whole
subject involved, and whose opinion on it is probably worthless in
any case. Hence, partly, the remarkable failure in our time of
political and military prediction. It is curious to reflect that
out of al the 'experts' of all the schools, there was not a single
one who was able to foresee so likely an event as the Russo-German
Pact of 1939.[Note 1, below] And when news of the Pact broke, the
most wildly divergent explanations were of it were given, and
predictions were made which were falsified almost immediately,
being based in nearly every case not on a study of probabilities
but on a desire to make the U.S.S.R. seem good or bad, strong or
weak. Political or military commentators, like astrologers, can
survive almost any mistake, because their more devoted followers do
not look to them for an appraisal of the facts but for the
stimulation of nationalistic loyalties.[Note 2, below] And
aesthetic judgements, especially literary judgements, are often
corrupted in the same way as political ones. It would be difficult
for an Indian Nationalist to enjoy reading Kipling or for a
Conservative to see merit in Mayakovsky, and there is always a
temptation to claim that any book whose tendency one disagrees with
must be a bad book from a <i>literary</i> point of view. People of
strongly nationalistic outlook often perform this sleight of hand
without being conscious of dishonesty.</p>

<p>[Note 1: A few writers of conservative tendency, such as Peter
Drucker, foretold an agreement between Germany and Russia, but they
expected an actual alliance or amalgamation which would be
permanent. No Marxist or other left-wing writer, of whatever
colour, came anywhere near foretelling the Pact.(Author's
footnote)]</p>

<p>[Note 2: The military commentators of the popular press can
mostly be classified as pro-Russian or anti-Russian pro-blimp or
anti-blimp. Such errors as believing the Maginot Line impregnable,
or predicting that Russia would conquer Germany in three months,
have failed to shake their reputation, because they were always
saying what their own particular audience wanted to hear. The two
military critics most favoured by the intelligentsia are Captain
Liddell Hart and Major-General Fuller, the first of whom teaches
that the defence is stronger that the attack, and the second that
the attack is stronger that the defence. This contradiction has not
prevented both of them from being accepted as authorities by the
same public. The secret reason for their vogue in left-wing circles
is that both of them are at odds with the War Office. (Author's
footnote)]</p>

<p>In England, if one simply considers the number of people
involved, it is probable that the dominant form of nationalism is
old-fashioned British jingoism. It is certain that this is still
widespread, and much more so than most observers would have
believed a dozen years ago. However, in this essay I am concerned
chiefly with the reactions of the intelligentsia, among whom
jingoism and even patriotism of the old kind are almost dead,
though they now seem to be reviving among a minority. Among the
intelligentsia, it hardly needs saying that the dominant form of
nationalism is Communism&mdash;using this word in a very loose
sense, to include not merely Communist Party members, but 'fellow
travellers' and russophiles generally. A Communist, for my purpose
here, is one who looks upon the U.S.S.R. as his Fatherland and
feels it his duty t justify Russian policy and advance Russian
interests at all costs. Obviously such people abound in England
today, and their direct and indirect influence is very great. But
many other forms of nationalism also flourish, and it is by
noticing the points of resemblance between different and even
seemingly opposed currents of thought that one can best get the
matter into perspective.</p>

<p>Ten or twenty years ago, the form of nationalism most closely
corresponding to Communism today was political Catholicism. Its
most outstanding exponent&mdash;though he was perhaps an extreme
case rather than a typical one&mdash;was G. K. Chesterton.
Chesterton was a writer of considerable talent who whose to
suppress both his sensibilities and his intellectual honesty in the
cause of Roman Catholic propaganda. During the last twenty years or
so of his life, his entire output was in reality an endless
repetition of the same thing, under its laboured cleverness as
simple and boring as 'Great is Diana of the Ephesians.' Every book
that he wrote, every scrap of dialogue, had to demonstrate beyond
the possibility of mistake the superiority of the Catholic over the
Protestant or the pagan. But Chesterton was not content to think of
this superiority as merely intellectual or spiritual: it had to be
translated into terms of national prestige and military power,
which entailed an ignorant idealisation of the Latin countries,
especially France. Chesterton had not lived long in France, and his
picture of it&mdash;as a land of Catholic peasants incessantly
singing the <i>Marseillaise</i> over glasses of red wine&mdash;had
about as much relation to reality as <i>chu chin chow</i> has to
everyday life in Baghdad. And with this went not only an enormous
overestimation of French military power (both before and after
1914-18 he maintained that France, by itself, was stronger than
Germany), but a silly and vulgar glorification of the actual
process of war. Chesterton's battle poems, such as Lepanto or The
Ballad of Saint Barbara, make The Charge of the Light Brigade read
like a pacifist tract: they are perhaps the most tawdry bits of
bombast to be found in our language. The interesting thing is that
had the romantic rubbish which he habitually wrote about France and
the French army been written by somebody else about Britain and the
British army, he would have been the first to jeer. In home
politics he was a Little Englander, a true hater of jingoism and
imperialism, and according to his lights a true friend of
democracy. Yet when he looked outwards into the international
field, he could forsake his principles without even noticing he was
doing so. Thus, his almost mystical belief in the virtues of
democracy did not prevent him from admiring Mussolini. Mussolini
had destroyed the representative government and the freedom of the
press for which Chesterton had struggled so hard at home, but
Mussolini was an Italian and had made Italy strong, and that
settled the matter. Nor did Chesterton ever find a word to say
about imperialism and the conquest of coloured races when they were
practised by Italians or Frenchmen. His hold on reality, his
literary taste, and even to some extent his moral sense, were
dislocated as soon as his nationalistic loyalties were
involved.</p>

<p>Obviously there are considerable resemblances between political
Catholicism, as exemplified by Chesterton, and Communism. So there
are between either of these and for instance Scottish nationalism,
Zionism, Antisemitism or Trotskyism. It would be an
oversimplification to say that all forms of nationalism are the
same, even in their mental atmosphere, but there are certain rules
that hold good in all cases. The following are the principal
characteristics of nationalist thought:</p>

<p><i>Obsession</i>. As nearly as possible, no nationalist ever
thinks, talks, or writes about anything except the superiority of
his own power unit. It is difficult if not impossible for any
nationalist to conceal his allegiance. The smallest slur upon his
own unit, or any implied praise of a rival organization, fills him
with uneasiness which he can relieve only by making some sharp
retort. If the chosen unit is an actual country, such as Ireland or
India, he will generally claim superiority for it not only in
military power and political virtue, but in art, literature, sport,
structure of the language, the physical beauty of the inhabitants,
and perhaps even in climate, scenery and cooking. He will show
great sensitiveness about such things as the correct display of
flags, relative size of headlines and the order in which different
countries are named.[Note, below] Nomenclature plays a very
important part in nationalist thought. Countries which have won
their independence or gone through a nationalist revolution usually
change their names, and any country or other unit round which
strong feelings revolve is likely to have several names, each of
them carrying a different implication. The two sides of the Spanish
Civil War had between them nine or ten names expressing different
degrees of love and hatred. Some of these names (e.g. 'Patriots'
for Franco-supporters, or 'Loyalists' for Government-supporters)
were frankly question-begging, and there was no single one of the
which the two rival factions could have agreed to use. All
nationalists consider it a duty to spread their own language to the
detriment of rival languages, and among English-speakers this
struggle reappears in subtler forms as a struggle between dialects.
Anglophobe-Americans will refuse to use a slang phrase if they know
it to be of British origin, and the conflict between Latinizers and
Germanizers often has nationalists motives behind it. Scottish
nationalists insist on the superiority of Lowland Scots, and
socialists whose nationalism takes the form of class hatred tirade
against the B.B.C. accent and even the often gives the impression
of being tinged by belief in sympathetic magic&mdash;a belief which
probably comes out in the widespread custom of burning political
enemies in effigy, or using pictures of them as targets in shooting
galleries.</p>

<p>[Note: Certain Americans have expressed dissatisfaction because
'Anglo-American' is the form of combination for these two words. It
has been proposed to submit 'Americo-British'.(Author's
footnote)]</p>

<p><i>Instability</i>. The intensity with which they are held does
not prevent nationalist loyalties from being transferable. To begin
with, as I have pointed out already, they can be and often are
fastened up on some foreign country. One quite commonly finds that
great national leaders, or the founders of nationalist movements,
do not even belong to the country they have glorified. Sometimes
they are outright foreigners, or more often they come from
peripheral areas where nationality is doubtful. Examples are
Stalin, Hitler, Napoleon, de Valera, Disraeli, Poincare,
Beaverbrook. The Pan-German movement was in part the creation of an
Englishman, Houston Chamberlain. For the past fifty or a hundred
years, transferred nationalism has been a common phenomenon among
literary intellectuals. With Lafcadio Hearne the transference was
to Japan, with Carlyle and many others of his time to Germany, and
in our own age it is usually to Russia. But the peculiarly
interesting fact is that re-transference is also possible. A
country or other unit which has been worshipped for years may
suddenly become detestable, and some other object of affection may
take its place with almost no interval. In the first version of H.
G. Wells's <i>Outline Of History</i>, and others of his writings
about that time, one finds the United States praised almost as
extravagantly as Russia is praised by Communists today: yet within
a few years this uncritical admiration had turned into hostility.
The bigoted Communist who changes in a space of weeks, or even
days, into an equally bigoted Trotskyist is a common spectacle. In
continental Europe Fascist movements were largely recruited from
among Communists, and the opposite process may well happen within
the next few years. What remains constant in the nationalist is his
state of mind: the object of his feelings is changeable, and may be
imaginary.</p>

<p>But for an intellectual, transference has an important function
which I have already mentioned shortly in connection with
Chesterton. It makes it possible for him to be much <i>more</i>
nationalistic&mdash;more vulgar, more silly, more malignant, more
dishonest&mdash;that he could ever be on behalf of his native
country, or any unit of which he had real knowledge. When one sees
the slavish or boastful rubbish that is written about Stalin, the
Red Army, etc. by fairly intelligent and sensitive people, one
realises that this is only possible because some kind of
dislocation has taken place. In societies such as ours, it is
unusual for anyone describable as an intellectual to feel a very
deep attachment to his own country. Public opinion&mdash;that is,
the section of public opinion of which he as an intellectual is
aware&mdash;will not allow him to do so. Most of the people
surrounding him are sceptical and disaffected, and he may adopt the
same attitude from imitativeness or sheer cowardice: in that case
he will have abandoned the form of nationalism that lies nearest to
hand without getting any closer to a genuinely internationalist
outlook. He still feels the need for a Fatherland, and it is
natural to look for one somewhere abroad. Having found it, he can
wallow unrestrainedly in exactly those emotions from which he
believes that he has emancipated himself. God, the King, the
Empire, the Union Jack&mdash;all the overthrown idols can reappear
under different names, and because they are not recognised for what
they are they can be worshipped with a good conscience. Transferred
nationalism, like the use of scapegoats, is a way of attaining
salvation without altering one's conduct.</p>

<p><i>Indifference to Reality</i>. All nationalists have the power
of not seeing resemblances between similar sets of facts. A British
Tory will defend self-determination in Europe and oppose it in
India with no feeling of inconsistency. Actions are held to be good
or bad, not on their own merits, but according to who does them,
and there is almost no kind of outrage&mdash;torture, the use of
hostages, forced labour, mass deportations, imprisonment without
trial, forgery, assassination, the bombing of civilians&mdash;which
does not change its moral colour when it is committed by 'our'
side. The Liberal <i>News Chronicle</i> published, as an example of
shocking barbarity, photographs of Russians hanged by the Germans,
and then a year or two later published with warm approval almost
exactly similar photographs of Germans hanged by the
Russians.[Note, below] It is the same with historical events.
History is thought of largely in nationalist terms, and such things
as the Inquisition, the tortures of the Star Chamber, the exploits
of the English buccaneers (Sir Francis Drake, for instance, who was
given to sinking Spanish prisoners alive), the Reign of Terror, the
heroes of the Mutiny blowing hundreds of Indians from the guns, or
Cromwell's soldiers slashing Irishwomen's faces with razors, become
morally neutral or even meritorious when it is felt that they were
done in the 'right' cause. If one looks back over the past quarter
of a century, one finds that there was hardly a single year when
atrocity stories were not being reported from some part of the
world; and yet in not one single case were these
atrocities&mdash;in Spain, Russia, China, Hungary, Mexico,
Amritsar, Smyrna&mdash;believed in and disapproved of by the
English intelligentsia as a whole. Whether such deeds were
reprehensible, or even whether they happened, was always decided
according to political predilection.</p>

<p>[Note: The <i>News Chronicle</i> advised its readers to visit
the news film at which the entire execution could be witnessed,
with close-ups. The <i>Star</i> published with seeming approval
photographs of nearly naked female collaborationists being baited
by the Paris mob. These photographs had a marked resemblance to the
Nazi photographs of Jews being baited by the Berlin mob.(Author's
footnote)]</p>

<p>The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities
committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not
even hearing about them. For quite six years the English admirers
of Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and
Buchenwald. And those who are loudest in denouncing the German
concentration camps are often quite unaware, or only very dimly
aware, that there are also concentration camps in Russia. Huge
events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving the deaths of
millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the
majority of English russophiles. Many English people have heard
almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews
during the present war. Their own antisemitism has caused this vast
crime to bounce off their consciousness. In nationalist thought
there are facts which are both true and untrue, known and unknown.
A known fact may be so unbearable that it is habitually pushed
aside and not allowed to enter into logical processes, or on the
other hand it may enter into every calculation and yet never be
admitted as a fact, even in one's own mind.</p>

<p>Every nationalist is haunted by the belief that the past can be
altered. He spends part of his time in a fantasy world in which
things happen as they should&mdash;in which, for example, the
Spanish Armada was a success or the Russian Revolution was crushed
in 1918&mdash;and he will transfer fragments of this world to the
history books whenever possible. Much of the propagandist writing
of our time amounts to plain forgery. Material facts are
suppressed, dates altered, quotations removed from their context
and doctored so as to change their meaning. Events which it is felt
ought not to have happened are left unmentioned and ultimately
denied [Note, below]. In 1927 Chiang Kai Shek boiled hundreds of
Communists alive, and yet within ten years he had become one of the
heroes of the Left. The re-alignment of world politics had brought
him into the anti-Fascist camp, and so it was felt that the boiling
of the Communists 'didn't count', or perhaps had not happened. The
primary aim of propaganda is, of course, to influence contemporary
opinion, but those who rewrite history do probably believe with
part of their minds that they are actually thrusting facts into the
past. When one considers the elaborate forgeries that have been
committed in order to show that Trotsky did not play a valuable
part in the Russian civil war, it is difficult to feel that the
people responsible are merely lying. More probably they feel that
their own version was what happened in the sight of God, and that
one is justified in rearranging the records accordingly.</p>

<p>[Note: En example is the Russo-German Pact, which is being
effaced as quickly as possible from public memory. A Russian
correspondent informs me that mention of the Pact is already being
omitted from Russian year-books which table recent political
events.(Author's note)]</p>

<p>Indifference to objective truth is encouraged by the sealing-off
of one part of the world from another, which makes it harder and
harder to discover what is actually happening. There can often be a
genuine doubt about the most enormous events. For example, it is
impossible to calculate within millions, perhaps even tens of
millions, the number of deaths caused by the present war. The
calamities that are constantly being reported&mdash;battles,
massacres, famines, revolutions&mdash;tend to inspire in the
average person a feeling of unreality. One has no way of verifying
the facts, one is not even fully certain that they have happened,
and one is always presented with totally different interpretations
from different sources. What were the rights and wrongs of the
Warsaw rising of August 1944? Is it true about the German gas ovens
in Poland? Who was really to blame for the Bengal famine? Probably
the truth is discoverable, but the facts will be so dishonestly set
forth in almost any newspaper that the ordinary reader can be
forgiven either for swallowing lies or failing to form an opinion.
The general uncertainty as to what is really happening makes it
easier to cling to lunatic beliefs. Since nothing is ever quite
proved or disproved, the most unmistakable fact can be impudently
denied. Moreover, although endlessly brooding on power, victory,
defeat, revenge, the nationalist is often somewhat uninterested in
what happens in the real world. What he wants is to <i>feel</i>
that his own unit is getting the better of some other unit, and he
can more easily do this by scoring off an adversary than by
examining the facts to see whether they support him. All
nationalist controversy is at the debating-society level. It is
always entirely inconclusive, since each contestant invariably
believes himself to have won the victory. Some nationalists are not
far from schizophrenia, living quite happily amid dreams of power
and conquest which have no connection with the physical world.</p>

<p>I have examined as best as I can the mental habits which are
common to all forms of nationalism. The next thing is to classify
those forms, but obviously this cannot be done comprehensively.
Nationalism is an enormous subject. The world is tormented by
innumerable delusions and hatreds which cut across one another in
an extremely complex way, and some of the most sinister of them
have not yet impinged on the European consciousness. In this essay
I am concerned with nationalism as it occurs among the English
intelligentsia. In them, much more than in ordinary English people,
it is unmixed with patriotism and therefore can be studied pure.
Below are listed the varieties of nationalism now flourishing among
English intellectuals, with such comments as seem to be needed. It
is convenient to use three headings, Positive, Transferred, and
Negative, though some varieties will fit into more than one
category:</p>

<p><i>POSITIVE NATIONALISM</i>
</p>

<p>(i) NEO-TORYISM. Exemplified by such people as Lord Elton, A.P.
Herbert, G.M. Young, Professor Pickthorn, by the literature of the
Tory Reform Committee, and by such magazines as the NEW ENGLISH
REVIEW and THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND AFTER. The real motive force
of neo-Toryism, giving it its nationalistic character and
differentiating it from ordinary Conservatism, is the desire not to
recognise that British power and influence have declined. Even
those who are realistic enough to see that Britain's military
position is not what it was, tend to claim that 'English ideas'
(usually left undefined) must dominate the world. All neo-Tories
are anti-Russian, but sometimes the main emphasis is anti-American.
The significant thing is that this school of thought seems to be
gaining ground among youngish intellectuals, sometimes
ex-Communists, who have passed through the usual process of
disillusionment and become disillusioned with that. The anglophobe
who suddenly becomes violently pro-British is a fairly common
figure. Writers who illustrate this tendency are F. A. Voigt,
Malcolm Muggeridge, Evelyn Waugh, Hugh Kingsmill, and a
psychologically similar development can be observed in T. S. Eliot,
Wyndham Lewis, and various of their followers.</p>

<p>(ii) CELTIC NATIONALISM. Welsh, Irish and Scottish nationalism
have points of difference but are alike in their anti-English
orientation. Members of all three movements have opposed the war
while continuing to describe themselves as pro-Russian, and the
lunatic fringe has even contrived to be simultaneously pro-Russian
and pro-Nazi. But Celtic nationalism is not the same thing as
anglophobia. Its motive force is a belief in the past and future
greatness of the Celtic peoples, and it has a strong tinge of
racialism. The Celt is supposed to be spiritually superior to the
Saxon&mdash;simpler, more creative, less vulgar, less snobbish,
etc.&mdash;but the usual power hunger is there under the surface.
One symptom of it is the delusion that Eire, Scotland or even Wales
could preserve its independence unaided and owes nothing to British
protection. Among writers, good examples of this school of thought
are Hugh McDiarmid and Sean O'Casey. No modern Irish writer, even
of the stature of Yeats or Joyce, is completely free from traces of
nationalism.</p>

<p>(iii) ZIONISM. This the unusual characteristics of a nationalist
movement, but the American variant of it seems to be more violent
and malignant than the British. I classify it under Direct and not
Transferred nationalism because it flourishes almost exclusively
among the Jews themselves. In England, for several rather
incongruous reasons, the intelligentsia are mostly pro-Jew on the
Palestine issue, but they do not feel strongly about it. All
English people of goodwill are also pro-Jew in the sense of
disapproving of Nazi persecution. But any actual nationalistic
loyalty, or belief in the innate superiority of Jews, is hardly to
be found among Gentiles.</p>

<p>TRANSFERRED NATIONALISM</p>

<p>(i) COMMUNISM.</p>

<p>(ii) POLITICAL CATHOLICISM.</p>

<p>(iii) COLOUR FEELING. The old-style contemptuous attitude
towards 'natives' has been much weakened in England, and various
pseudo-scientific theories emphasising the superiority of the white
race have been abandoned.[Note, below] Among the intelligentsia,
colour feeling only occurs in the transposed form, that is, as a
belief in the innate superiority of the coloured races. This is now
increasingly common among English intellectuals, probably resulting
more often from masochism and sexual frustration than from contact
with the Oriental and Negro nationalist movements. Even among those
who do not feel strongly on the colour question, snobbery and
imitation have a powerful influence. Almost any English
intellectual would be scandalised by the claim that the white races
are superior to the coloured, whereas the opposite claim would seem
to him unexceptionable even if he disagreed with it. Nationalistic
attachment to the coloured races is usually mixed up with the
belief that their sex lives are superior, and there is a large
underground mythology about the sexual prowess of Negroes.</p>

<p>[Note: A good example is the sunstroke superstition. Until
recently it was believed that the white races were much more liable
to sunstroke that the coloured, and that a white man could not
safely walk about in tropical sunshine without a pith helmet. There
was no evidence whatever for this theory, but it served the purpose
of accentuating the difference between 'natives' and Europeans.
During the war the theory was quietly dropped and whole armies
manoeuvred in the tropics without pith helmets. So long as the
sunstroke superstition survived, English doctors in India appear to
have believed in it as firmly as laymen.(Author's footnote)]</p>

<p>(iv) CLASS FEELING. Among upper-class and middle-class
intellectuals, only in the transposed form&mdash;i.e. as a belief
in the superiority of the proletariat. Here again, inside the
intelligentsia, the pressure of public opinion is overwhelming.
Nationalistic loyalty towards the proletariat, and most vicious
theoretical hatred of the bourgeoisie, can and often do co-exist
with ordinary snobbishness in everyday life.</p>

<p>(v) PACIFISM. The majority of pacifists either belong to obscure
religious sects or are simply humanitarians who object to the
taking of life and prefer not to follow their thoughts beyond that
point. But there is a minority of intellectual pacifists whose real
though unadmitted motive appears to be hatred of western democracy
and admiration of totalitarianism. Pacifist propaganda usually
boils down to saying that one side is as bad as the other, but if
one looks closely at the writings of younger intellectual
pacifists, one finds that they do not by any means express
impartial disapproval but are directed almost entirely against
Britain and the United States. Moreover they do not as a rule
condemn violence as such, but only violence used in defence of
western countries. The Russians, unlike the British, are not blamed
for defending themselves by warlike means, and indeed all pacifist
propaganda of this type avoids mention of Russia or China. It is
not claimed, again, that the Indians should abjure violence in
their struggle against the British. Pacifist literature abounds
with equivocal remarks which, if they mean anything, appear to mean
that statesmen of the type of Hitler are preferable to those of the
type of Churchill, and that violence is perhaps excusable if it is
violent enough. After the fall of France, the French pacifists,
faced by a real choice which their English colleagues have not had
to make, mostly went over to the Nazis, and in England there
appears to have been some small overlap of membership between the
Peace Pledge Union and the Blackshirts. Pacifist writers have
written in praise of Carlyle, one of the intellectual fathers of
Fascism. All in all it is difficult not to feel that pacifism, as
it appears among a section of the intelligentsia, is secretly
inspired by an admiration for power and successful cruelty. The
mistake was made of pinning this emotion to Hitler, but it could
easily be retransferred.</p>

<p>NEGATIVE NATIONALISM</p>

<p>(i) ANGLOPHOBIA. Within the intelligentsia, a derisive and
mildly hostile attitude towards Britain is more or less compulsory,
but it is an unfaked emotion in many cases. During the war it was
manifested in the defeatism of the intelligentsia, which persisted
long after it had become clear that the Axis powers could not win.
Many people were undisguisedly pleased when Singapore fell ore when
the British were driven out of Greece, and there was a remarkable
unwillingness to believe in good news, e.g. el Alamein, or the
number of German planes shot down in the Battle of Britain. English
left-wing intellectuals did not, of course, actually want the
Germans or Japanese to win the war, but many of them could not help
getting a certain kick out of seeing their own country humiliated,
and wanted to feel that the final victory would be due to Russia,
or perhaps America, and not to Britain. In foreign politics many
intellectuals follow the principle that any faction backed by
Britain must be in the wrong. As a result, 'enlightened' opinion is
quite largely a mirror-image of Conservative policy. Anglophobia is
always liable to reversal, hence that fairly common spectacle, the
pacifist of one war who is a bellicist in the next.</p>

<p>(ii) ANTI-SEMITISM. There is little evidence about this at
present, because the Nazi persecutions have made it necessary for
any thinking person to side with the Jews against their oppressors.
Anyone educated enough to have heard the word 'antisemitism' claims
as a matter of course to be free of it, and anti-Jewish remarks are
carefully eliminated from all classes of literature. Actually
antisemitism appears to be widespread, even among intellectuals,
and the general conspiracy of silence probably helps exacerbate it.
People of Left opinions are not immune to it, and their attitude is
sometimes affected by the fact that Trotskyists and Anarchists tend
to be Jews. But antisemitism comes more naturally to people of
Conservative tendency, who suspect Jews of weakening national
morale and diluting the national culture. Neo-Tories and political
Catholics are always liable to succumb to antisemitism, at least
intermittently.</p>

<p>(iii) TROTSKYISM. This word is used so loosely as to include
Anarchists, democratic Socialists and even Liberals. I use it here
to mean a doctrinaire Marxist whose main motive is hostility to the
Stalin régime. Trotskyism can be better studied in obscure
pamphlets or in papers like the SOCIALIST APPEAL than in the works
of Trotsky himself, who was by no means a man of one idea. Although
in some places, for instance in the United States, Trotskyism is
able to attract a fairly large number of adherents and develop into
an organised movement with a petty fuerher of its own, its
inspiration is essentially negative. The Trotskyist is AGAINST
Stalin just as the Communist is FOR him, and, like the majority of
Communists, he wants not so much to alter the external world as to
feel that the battle for prestige is going in his own favour. In
each case there is the same obsessive fixation on a single subject,
the same inability to form a genuinely rational opinion based on
probabilities. The fact that Trotskyists are everywhere a
persecuted minority, and that the accusation usually made against
them, i.e. of collaborating with the Fascists, is obviously false,
creates an impression that Trotskyism is intellectually and morally
superior to Communism; but it is doubtful whether there is much
difference. The most typical Trotskyists, in any case, are
ex-Communists, and no one arrives at Trotskyism except via one of
the left-wing movements. No Communist, unless tethered to his party
by years of habit, is secure against a sudden lapse into
Trotskyism. The opposite process does not seem to happen equally
often, though there is no clear reason why it should not.</p>

<p>In the classification I have attempted above, it will seem that
I have often exaggerated, oversimplified, made unwarranted
assumptions and have left out of account the existence of
ordinarily decent motives. This was inevitable, because in this
essay I am trying to isolate and identify tendencies which exist in
all our minds and pervert our thinking, without necessarily
occurring in a pure state or operating continuously. It is
important at this point to correct the over-simplified picture
which I have been obliged to make. To begin with, one has no right
to assume that EVERYONE, or even every intellectual, is infected by
nationalism. Secondly, nationalism can be intermittent and limited.
An intelligent man may half-succumb to a belief which he knows to
be absurd, and he may keep it out of his mind for long periods,
only reverting to it in moments of anger or sentimentality, or when
he is certain that no important issues are involved. Thirdly, a
nationalistic creed may be adopted in good faith from
non-nationalistic motives. Fourthly, several kinds of nationalism,
even kinds that cancel out, can co-exist in the same person.</p>

<p>All the way through I have said, 'the nationalist does this' or
'the nationalist does that', using for purposes of illustration the
extreme, barely sane type of nationalist who has no neutral areas
in his mind and no interest in anything except the struggle for
power. Actually such people are fairly common, but they are not
worth the powder and shot. In real life Lord Elton, D. N. Pritt,
Lady Houston, Ezra Pound, Lord Vanisttart, Father Coughlin and all
the rest of their dreary tribe have to be fought against, but their
intellectual deficiencies hardly need pointing out. Monomania is
not interesting, and the fact that no nationalist of the more
bigoted kind can write a book which still seems worth reading after
a lapse of years has a certain deodorising effect. But when one has
admitted that nationalism has not triumphed everywhere, that there
are still peoples whose judgements are not at the mercy of their
desires, the fact does remain that the pressing
problems&mdash;India, Poland, Palestine, the Spanish civil war, the
Moscow trials, the American Negroes, the Russo-German Pact or what
have you&mdash;cannot be, or at least never are, discussed upon a
reasonable level. The Eltons and Pritts and Coughlins, each of them
simply an enormous mouth bellowing the same lie over and over
again, are obviously extreme cases, but we deceive ourselves if we
do not realise that we can all resemble them in unguarded moments.
Let a certain note be struck, let this or that corn be trodden
on&mdash;and it may be corn whose very existence has been
unsuspected hitherto&mdash;and the most fair-minded and
sweet-tempered person may suddenly be transformed into a vicious
partisan, anxious only to 'score' over his adversary and
indifferent as to how many lies he tells or how many logical errors
he commits in doing so. When Lloyd George, who was an opponent of
the Boer War, announced in the House of Commons that the British
communiques, if one added them together, claimed the killing of
more Boers than the whole Boer nation contained, it is recorded
that Arthur Balfour rose to his feet and shouted 'Cad!' Very few
people are proof against lapses of this type. The Negro snubbed by
a white woman, the Englishman who hears England ignorantly
criticised by an American, the Catholic apologist reminded of the
Spanish Armada, will all react in much the same way. One prod to
the nerve of nationalism, and the intellectual decencies can
vanish, the past can be altered, and the plainest facts can be
denied.</p>

<p>If one harbours anywhere in one's mind a nationalistic loyalty
or hatred, certain facts, although in a sense known to be true, are
inadmissible. Here are just a few examples. I list below five types
of nationalist, and against each I append a fact which it is
impossible for that type of nationalist to accept, even in his
secret thoughts:</p>

<p>BRITISH TORY: Britain will come out of this war with reduced
power and prestige.</p>

<p>COMMUNIST: If she had not been aided by Britain and America,
Russia would have been defeated by Germany.</p>

<p>IRISH NATIONALIST: Eire can only remain independent because of
British protection.</p>

<p>TROTSKYIST: The Stalin régime is accepted by the Russian
masses.</p>

<p>PACIFIST: Those who 'abjure' violence can only do so because
others are committing violence on their behalf.</p>

<p>All of these facts are grossly obvious if one's emotions do not
happen to be involved: but to the kind of person named in each case
they are also INTOLERABLE, and so they have to be denied, and false
theories constructed upon their denial. I come back to the
astonishing failure of military prediction in the present war. It
is, I think, true to say that the intelligentsia have been more
wrong about the progress of the war than the common people, and
that they were more swayed by partisan feelings. The average
intellectual of the Left believed, for instance, that the war was
lost in 1940, that the Germans were bound to overrun Egypt in 1942,
that the Japanese would never be driven out of the lands they had
conquered, and that the Anglo-American bombing offensive was making
no impression on Germany. He could believe these things because his
hatred for the British ruling class forbade him to admit that
British plans could succeed. There is no limit to the follies that
can be swallowed if one is under the influence of feelings of this
kind. I have heard it confidently stated, for instance, that the
American troops had been brought to Europe not to fight the Germans
but to crush an English revolution. One has to belong to the
intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could
be such a fool. When Hitler invaded Russia, the officials of the
MOI issued 'as background' a warning that Russia might be expected
to collapse in six weeks. On the other hand the Communists regarded
every phase of the war as a Russian victory, even when the Russians
were driven back almost to the Caspian Sea and had lost several
million prisoners. There is no need to multiply instances. The
point is that as soon as fear, hatred, jealousy and power worship
are involved, the sense of reality becomes unhinged. And, as I have
pointed out already, the sense of right and wrong becomes unhinged
also. There is no crime, absolutely none, that cannot be condoned
when 'our' side commits it. Even if one does not deny that the
crime has happened, even if one knows that it is exactly the same
crime as one has condemned in some other case, even if one admits
in an intellectual sense that it is unjustified&mdash;still one
cannot FEEL that it is wrong. Loyalty is involved, and so pity
ceases to function.</p>

<p>The reason for the rise and spread of nationalism is far too big
a question to be raised here. It is enough to say that, in the
forms in which it appears among English intellectuals, it is a
distorted reflection of the frightful battles actually happening in
the external world, and that its worst follies have been made
possible by the breakdown of patriotism and religious belief. If
one follows up this train of thought, one is in danger of being led
into a species of Conservatism, or into political quietism. It can
be plausibly argued, for instance&mdash;it is even possibly
true&mdash;that patriotism is an inoculation against nationalism,
that monarchy is a guard against dictatorship, and that organised
religion is a guard against superstition. Or again, it can be
argued that NO unbiased outlook is possible, that ALL creeds and
causes involve the same lies, follies, and barbarities; and this is
often advanced as a reason for keeping out of politics altogether.
I do not accept this argument, if only because in the modern world
no one describable as an intellectual CAN keep out of politics in
the sense of not caring about them. I think one must engage in
politics&mdash;using the word in a wide sense&mdash;and that one
must have preferences: that is, one must recognise that some causes
are objectively better than others, even if they are advanced by
equally bad means. As for the nationalistic loves and hatreds that
I have spoken of, they are part of the make-up of most of us,
whether we like it or not. Whether it is possible to get rid of
them I do not know, but I do believe that it is possible to
struggle against them, and that this is essentially a MORAL effort.
It is a question first of all of discovering what one really is,
what one's own feelings really are, and then of making allowance
for the inevitable bias. If you hate and fear Russia, if you are
jealous of the wealth and power of America, if you despise Jews, if
you have a sentiment of inferiority towards the British ruling
class, you cannot get rid of those feelings simply by taking
thought. But you can at least recognise that you have them, and
prevent them from contaminating your mental processes. The
emotional urges which are inescapable, and are perhaps even
necessary to political action, should be able to exist side by side
with an acceptance of reality. But this, I repeat, needs a MORAL
effort, and contemporary English literature, so far as it is alive
at all to the major issues of our time, shows how few of us are
prepared to make it.</p>

<h2>REVENGE IS SOUR (1945)</h2>

<p>Whenever I read phrases like 'war guilt trials', 'punishment of
war criminals' and so forth, there comes back into my mind the
memory of something I saw in a prisoner-of-war camp in South
Germany, earlier this year.</p>

<p>Another correspondent and myself were being show round the camp
by a little Viennese Jew who had been enlisted in the branch of the
American army which deals with the interrogation of prisoners. He
was an alert, fair-haired, rather good-looking youth of about
twenty-five, and politically so much more knowledgeable than the
average American officer that it was a pleasure to be with him. The
camp was on an airfield, and, after we had been round the cages,
our guide led us to a hangar where various prisoners who were in a
different category from the others were being 'screened'.</p>

<p>Up at one end of the hangar about a dozen men were lying in a
row on the concrete floor. These, it was explained, were S.S.
officers who had been segregated from the other prisoners. Among
them was a man in dingy civilian clothes who was lying with his arm
across his face and apparently asleep. He had strange and horribly
deformed feet. The two of them were quite symmetrical, but they
were clubbed out into an extraordinary globular shape which made
them more like a horse's hoof than anything human. As we approached
the group, the little Jew seemed to be working himself up into a
state of excitement.</p>

<p>'That's the real swine!' he said, and suddenly he lashed out
with his heavy army boot and caught the prostrate man a fearful
kick right on the bulge of one of his deformed feet.</p>

<p>'Get up, you swine!' he shouted as the man started out of sleep,
and then repeated something of the kind in German. The prisoner
scrambled to his feet and stood clumsily to attention. With the
same air of working himself up into a fury&mdash;indeed he was
almost dancing up and down as he spoke&mdash;the Jew told us the
prisoner's history. He was a 'real' Nazi: his party number
indicated that he had been a member since the very early days, and
he had held a post corresponding to a General in the political
branch of the S.S. It could be taken as quite certain that he had
had charge of concentration camps and had presided over tortures
and hangings. In short, he represented everything that we had been
fighting against during the past five years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was studying his appearance. Quite apart from the
scrubby, unfed, unshaven look that a newly captured man generally
has, he was a disgusting specimen. But he did not look brutal or in
any way frightening: merely neurotic and, in a low way,
intellectual. His pale, shifty eyes were deformed by powerful
spectacles. He could have been an unfrocked clergyman, an actor
ruined by drink, or a spiritualist medium. I have seen very similar
people in London common lodging houses, and also in the Reading
Room of the British Museum. Quite obviously he was mentally
unbalanced&mdash;indeed, only doubtfully sane, though at this
moment sufficiently in his right mind to be frightened of getting
another kick. And yet everything that the Jew was telling me of his
history could have been true, and probably was true! So the Nazi
torturer of one's imagination, the monstrous figure against whom
one had struggled for so many years, dwindled to this pitiful
wretch, whose obvious need was not for punishment, but for some
kind of psychological treatment.</p>

<p>Later, there were further humiliations. Another S.S. officer, a
large brawny man, was ordered to strip to the waist and show the
blood group number tattooed on his under-arm; another was forced to
explain to us how he had lied about being a member of the S.S. and
attempted to pass himself off as an ordinary soldier of the
Wehrmacht. I wondered whether the Jew was getting any real kick out
of this new-found power that he was exercising. I concluded that he
wasn't really enjoying it, and that he was merely&mdash;like a man
in a brothel, or a boy smoking his first cigar, or a tourist
traipsing round a picture gallery&mdash;TELLING himself that he was
enjoying it, and behaving as he had planned to behave in the days
he was helpless.</p>

<p>It is absurd to blame any German or Austrian Jew for getting his
own back on the Nazis. Heaven knows what scores this particular man
may have had to wipe out; very likely his whole family had been
murdered; and after all, even a wanton kick to a prisoner is a very
tiny thing compared with the outrages committed by the Hitler
régime. But what this scene, and much else that I saw in Germany,
brought home to me was that the whole idea of revenge and
punishment is a childish daydream. Properly speaking, there is no
such thing as revenge. Revenge is an act which you want to commit
when you are powerless and because you are powerless: as soon as
the sense of impotence is removed, the desire evaporates also.</p>

<p>Who would not have jumped for joy, in 1940, at the thought of
seeing S.S. officers kicked and humiliated? But when the thing
becomes possible, it is merely pathetic and disgusting. It is said
that when Mussolini's corpse was exhibited in public, an old woman
drew a revolver and fired five shots into it, exclaiming, 'Those
are for my five sons!' It is the kind of story that the newspapers
make up, but it might be true. I wonder how much satisfaction she
got out of those five shots, which, doubtless, she had dreamed
years earlier of firing. The condition of her being able to get
close enough to Mussolini to shoot at him was that he should be a
corpse.</p>

<p>In so far as the big public in this country is responsible for
the monstrous peace settlement now being forced on Germany, it is
because of a failure to see in advance that punishing an enemy
brings no satisfaction. We acquiesce in crimes like the expulsion
of all Germans from East Prussia&mdash;crimes which in some cases
we could not prevent but might at least have protested
against&mdash;because the Germans had angered and frightened us,
and therefore we were certain that when they were down we should
feel no pity for them. We persist in these policies, or let others
persist in them on our behalf, because of a vague feeling that,
having set out to punish Germany, we ought to go ahead and do it.
Actually there is little acute hatred of Germany left in this
country, and even less, I should expect to find, in the army of
occupation. Only the minority of sadists, who must have their
'atrocities' from one source or another, take a keen interest in
the hunting-down of war criminals and quislings. If you asked the
average man what crime Goering, Ribbentrop, and the rest are to be
charged with at their trial, he cannot tell you. Somehow the
punishment of these monsters ceases to seem attractive when it
becomes possible: indeed, once under lock and key, they almost
cease to be monsters.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is often a need of some concrete incident
before one can discover the real state of one's feelings. Here is
another memory from Germany. A few hours after Stuttgart was
captured by the French army, a Belgian journalist and myself
entered the town, which was still in some disorder. The Belgian had
been broadcasting throughout the war for the European Service of
the BBC, and, like nearly all Frenchmen or Belgians, he had a very
much tougher attitude towards 'the Boche' than an Englishman or an
American would have. All the main bridges into town had been blown
up, and we had to enter by a small footbridge which the Germans had
evidently mad efforts to defend. A dead German soldier was lying
supine at the foot of the steps. His face was a waxy yellow. On his
breast someone had laid a bunch of the lilac which was blooming
everywhere.</p>

<p>The Belgian averted his face as we went past. When we were well
over the bridge he confided to me that this was the first time he
had seen a dead man. I suppose he was thirty five years old, and
for four years he had been doing war propaganda over the radio. For
several days after this, his attitude was quite different from what
it had been earlier. He looked with disgust at the bomb-wrecked
town and the humiliation the Germans were undergoing, and even on
one occasion intervened to prevent a particularly bad bit of
looting. When he left, he gave the residue of the coffee we had
brought with us to the Germans on whom we were billeted. A week
earlier he would probably have been scandalized at the idea of
giving coffee to a 'Boche'. But his feelings, he told me, had
undergone a change at the sight of ce pauvre mort beside the
bridge: it had suddenly brought home to him the meaning of war. And
yet, if we had happened to enter the town by another route, he
might have been spared the experience of seeing one corpse out of
the&mdash;perhaps&mdash;twenty million that the war has
produced.</p>

<h2>THE SPORTING SPIRIT</h2>

<p>Now that the brief visit of the Dynamo football team has come to
an end, it is possible to say publicly what many thinking people
were saying privately before the Dynamos ever arrived. That is,
that sport is an unfailing cause of ill-will, and that if such a
visit as this had any effect at all on Anglo-Soviet relations, it
could only be to make them slightly worse than before.</p>

<p>Even the newspapers have been unable to conceal the fact that at
least two of the four matches played led to much bad feeling. At
the Arsenal match, I am told by someone who was there, a British
and a Russian player came to blows and the crowd booed the referee.
The Glasgow match, someone else informs me, was simply a
free-for-all from the start. And then there was the controversy,
typical of our nationalistic age, about the composition of the
Arsenal team. Was it really an all-England team, as claimed by the
Russians, or merely a league team, as claimed by the British? And
did the Dynamos end their tour abruptly in order to avoid playing
an all-England team? As usual, everyone answers these questions
according to his political predilections. Not quite everyone,
however. I noted with interest, as an instance of the vicious
passions that football provokes, that the sporting correspondent of
the russophile NEWS CHRONICLE took the anti-Russian line and
maintained that Arsenal was NOT an all-England team. No doubt the
controversy will continue to echo for years in the footnotes of
history books. Meanwhile the result of the Dynamos' tour, in so far
as it has had any result, will have been to create fresh animosity
on both sides.</p>

<p>And how could it be otherwise? I am always amazed when I hear
people saying that sport creates goodwill between the nations, and
that if only the common peoples of the world could meet one another
at football or cricket, they would have no inclination to meet on
the battlefield. Even if one didn't know from concrete examples
(the 1936 Olympic Games, for instance) that international sporting
contests lead to orgies of hatred, one could deduce it from general
principles.</p>

<p>Nearly all the sports practised nowadays are competitive. You
play to win, and the game has little meaning unless you do your
utmost to win. On the village green, where you pick up sides and no
feeling of local patriotism is involved, it is possible to play
simply for the fun and exercise: but as soon as the question of
prestige arises, as soon as you feel that you and some larger unit
will be disgraced if you lose, the most savage combative instincts
are aroused. Anyone who has played even in a school football match
knows this. At the international level sport is frankly mimic
warfare. But the significant thing is not the behaviour of the
players but the attitude of the spectators: and, behind the
spectators, of the nations who work themselves into furies over
these absurd contests, and seriously believe&mdash;at any rate for
short periods&mdash;that running, jumping and kicking a ball are
tests of national virtue.</p>

<p>Even a leisurely game like cricket, demanding grace rather than
strength, can cause much ill-will, as we saw in the controversy
over body-line bowling and over the rough tactics of the Australian
team that visited England in 1921. Football, a game in which
everyone gets hurt and every nation has its own style of play which
seems unfair to foreigners, is far worse. Worst of all is boxing.
One of the most horrible sights in the world is a fight between
white and coloured boxers before a mixed audience. But a boxing
audience is always disgusting, and the behaviour of the women, in
particular, is such that the army, I believe, does not allow them
to attend its contests. At any rate, two or three years ago, when
Home Guards and regular troops were holding a boxing tournament, I
was placed on guard at the door of the hall, with orders to keep
the women out.</p>

<p>In England, the obsession with sport is bad enough, but even
fiercer passions are aroused in young countries where games playing
and nationalism are both recent developments. In countries like
India or Burma, it is necessary at football matches to have strong
cordons of police to keep the crowd from invading the field. In
Burma, I have seen the supporters of one side break through the
police and disable the goalkeeper of the opposing side at a
critical moment. The first big football match that was played in
Spain about fifteen years ago led to an uncontrollable riot. As
soon as strong feelings of rivalry are aroused, the notion of
playing the game according to the rules always vanishes. People
want to see one side on top and the other side humiliated, and they
forget that victory gained through cheating or through the
intervention of the crowd is meaningless. Even when the spectators
don't intervene physically they try to influence the game by
cheering their own side and "rattling" opposing players with boos
and insults. Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is
bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all
rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence: in other words
it is war minus the shooting.</p>

<p>Instead of blah-blahing about the clean, healthy rivalry of the
football field and the great part played by the Olympic Games in
bringing the nations together, it is more useful to inquire how and
why this modern cult of sport arose. Most of the games we now play
are of ancient origin, but sport does not seem to have been taken
very seriously between Roman times and the nineteenth century. Even
in the English public schools the games cult did not start till the
later part of the last century. Dr Arnold, generally regarded as
the founder of the modern public school, looked on games as simply
a waste of time. Then, chiefly in England and the United States,
games were built up into a heavily-financed activity, capable of
attracting vast crowds and rousing savage passions, and the
infection spread from country to country. It is the most violently
combative sports, football and boxing, that have spread the widest.
There cannot be much doubt that the whole thing is bound up with
the rise of nationalism&mdash;that is, with the lunatic modern
habit of identifying oneself with large power units and seeing
everything in terms of competitive prestige. Also, organised games
are more likely to flourish in urban communities where the average
human being lives a sedentary or at least a confined life, and does
not get much opportunity for creative labour. In a rustic community
a boy or young man works off a good deal of his surplus energy by
walking, swimming, snowballing, climbing trees, riding horses, and
by various sports involving cruelty to animals, such as fishing,
cock-fighting and ferreting for rats. In a big town one must
indulge in group activities if one wants an outlet for one's
physical strength or for one's sadistic impulses. Games are taken
seriously in London and New York, and they were taken seriously in
Rome and Byzantium: in the Middle Ages they were played, and
probably played with much physical brutality, but they were not
mixed up with politics nor a cause of group hatreds.</p>

<p>If you wanted to add to the vast fund of ill-will existing in
the world at this moment, you could hardly do it better than by a
series of football matches between Jews and Arabs, Germans and
Czechs, Indians and British, Russians and Poles, and Italians and
Jugoslavs, each match to be watched by a mixed audience of 100,000
spectators. I do not, of course, suggest that sport is one of the
main causes of international rivalry; big-scale sport is itself, I
think, merely another effect of the causes that have produced
nationalism. Still, you do make things worse by sending forth a
team of eleven men, labelled as national champions, to do battle
against some rival team, and allowing it to be felt on all sides
that whichever nation is defeated will "lose face".</p>

<p>I hope, therefore, that we shan't follow up the visit of the
Dynamos by sending a British team to the USSR. If we must do so,
then let us send a second-rate team which is sure to be beaten and
cannot be claimed to represent Britain as a whole. There are quite
enough real causes of trouble already, and we need not add to them
by encouraging young men to kick each other on the shins amid the
roars of infuriated spectators.</p>

<h2>YOU AND THE ATOMIC BOMB (1945)</h2>

<p>Considering how likely we all are to be blown to pieces by it
within the next five years, the atomic bomb has not roused so much
discussion as might have been expected. The newspapers have
published numerous diagrams, not very helpful to the average man,
of protons and neutrons doing their stuff, and there has been much
reiteration of the useless statement that the bomb 'ought to be put
under international control.' But curiously little has been said,
at any rate in print, about the question that is of most urgent
interest to all of us, namely: 'How difficult are these things to
manufacture?'</p>

<p>Such information as we&mdash;that is, the big
public&mdash;possess on this subject has come to us in a rather
indirect way, apropos of President Truman's decision not to hand
over certain secrets to the USSR. Some months ago, when the bomb
was still only a rumour, there was a widespread belief that
splitting the atom was merely a problem for the physicists, and
that when they had solved it a new and devastating weapon would be
within reach of almost everybody. (At any moment, so the rumour
went, some lonely lunatic in a laboratory might blow civilisation
to smithereens, as easily as touching off a firework.)</p>

<p>Had that been true, the whole trend of history would have been
abruptly altered. The distinction between great states and small
states would have been wiped out, and the power of the State over
the individual would have been greatly weakened. However, it
appears from President Truman's remarks, and various comments that
have been made on them, that the bomb is fantastically expensive
and that its manufacture demands an enormous industrial effort,
such as only three or four countries in the world are capable of
making. This point is of cardinal importance, because it may mean
that the discovery of the atomic bomb, so far from reversing
history, will simply intensify the trends which have been apparent
for a dozen years past.</p>

<p>It is a commonplace that the history of civilisation is largely
the history of weapons. In particular, the connection between the
discovery of gunpowder and the overthrow of feudalism by the
bourgeoisie has been pointed out over and over again. And though I
have no doubt exceptions can be brought forward, I think the
following rule would be found generally true: that ages in which
the dominant weapon is expensive or difficult to make will tend to
be ages of despotism, whereas when the dominant weapon is cheap and
simple, the common people have a chance. Thus, for example, thanks,
battleships and bombing planes are inherently tyrannical weapons,
while rifles, muskets, long-bows and hand-grenades are inherently
democratic weapons. A complex weapon makes the strong stronger,
while a simple weapon&mdash;so long as there is no answer to
it&mdash;gives claws to the weak.</p>

<p>The great age of democracy and of national self-determination
was the age of the musket and the rifle. After the invention of the
flintlock, and before the invention of the percussion cap, the
musket was a fairly efficient weapon, and at the same time so
simple that it could be produced almost anywhere. Its combination
of qualities made possible the success of the American and French
revolutions, and made a popular insurrection a more serious
business than it could be in our own day. After the musket came the
breech-loading rifle. This was a comparatively complex thing, but
it could still be produced in scores of countries, and it was
cheap, easily smuggled and economical of ammunition. Even the most
backward nation could always get hold of rifles from one source or
another, so that Boers, Bulgars, Abyssinians, Moroccans&mdash;even
Tibetans&mdash;could put up a fight for their independence,
sometimes with success. But thereafter every development in
military technique has favoured the State as against the
individual, and the industrialised country as against the backward
one. There are fewer and fewer foci of power. Already, in 1939,
there were only five states capable of waging war on the grand
scale, and now there are only three&mdash;ultimately, perhaps, only
two. This trend has been obvious for years, and was pointed out by
a few observers even before 1914. The one thing that might reverse
it is the discovery of a weapon&mdash;or, to put it more broadly,
of a method of fighting&mdash;not dependent on huge concentrations
of industrial plant.</p>

<p>From various symptoms one can infer that the Russians do not yet
possess the secret of making the atomic bomb; on the other hand,
the consensus of opinion seems to be that they will possess it
within a few years. So we have before us the prospect of two or
three monstrous super-states, each possessed of a weapon by which
millions of people can be wiped out in a few seconds, dividing the
world between them. It has been rather hastily assumed that this
means bigger and bloodier wars, and perhaps an actual end to the
machine civilisation. But suppose&mdash;and really this the
likeliest development&mdash;that the surviving great nations make a
tacit agreement never to use the atomic bomb against one another?
Suppose they only use it, or the threat of it, against people who
are unable to retaliate? In that case we are back where we were
before, the only difference being that power is concentrated in
still fewer hands and that the outlook for subject peoples and
oppressed classes is still more hopeless.</p>

<p>When James Burnham wrote THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION it seemed
probable to many Americans that the Germans would win the European
end of the war, and it was therefore natural to assume that Germany
and not Russia would dominate the Eurasian land mass, while Japan
would remain master of East Asia. This was a miscalculation, but it
does not affect the main argument. For Burnham's geographical
picture of the new world has turned out to be correct. More and
more obviously the surface of the earth is being parceled off into
three great empires, each self-contained and cut off from contact
with the outer world, and each ruled, under one disguise or
another, by a self-elected oligarchy. The haggling as to where the
frontiers are to be drawn is still going on, and will continue for
some years, and the third of the three super-states&mdash;East
Asia, dominated by China&mdash;is still potential rather than
actual. But the general drift is unmistakable, and every scientific
discovery of recent years has accelerated it.</p>

<p>We were once told that the aeroplane had 'abolished frontiers';
actually it is only since the aeroplane became a serious weapon
that frontiers have become definitely impassable. The radio was
once expected to promote international understanding and
co-operation; it has turned out to be a means of insulating one
nation from another. The atomic bomb may complete the process by
robbing the exploited classes and peoples of all power to revolt,
and at the same time putting the possessors of the bomb on a basis
of military equality. Unable to conquer one another, they are
likely to continue ruling the world between them, and it is
difficult to see how the balance can be upset except by slow and
unpredictable demographic changes.</p>

<p>For forty or fifty years past, Mr. H. G. Wells and others have
been warning us that man is in danger of destroying himself with
his own weapons, leaving the ants or some other gregarious species
to take over. Anyone who has seen the ruined cities of Germany will
find this notion at least thinkable. Nevertheless, looking at the
world as a whole, the drift for many decades has been not towards
anarchy but towards the reimposition of slavery. We may be heading
not for general breakdown but for an epoch as horribly stable as
the slave empires of antiquity. James Burnham's theory has been
much discussed, but few people have yet considered its ideological
implications&mdash;that is, the kind of world-view, the kind of
beliefs, and the social structure that would probably prevail in a
state which was at once UNCONQUERABLE and in a permanent state of
'cold war' with its neighbors.</p>

<p>Had the atomic bomb turned out to be something as cheap and
easily manufactured as a bicycle or an alarm clock, it might well
have plunged us back into barbarism, but it might, on the other
hand, have meant the end of national sovereignty and of the
highly-centralised police state. If, as seems to be the case, it is
a rare and costly object as difficult to produce as a battleship,
it is likelier to put an end to large-scale wars at the cost of
prolonging indefinitely a 'peace that is no peace'.</p>

<h2>A GOOD WORD FOR THE VICAR OF BRAY</h2>

<p>Some years ago a friend took me to the little Berkshire church
of which the celebrated Vicar of Bray was once the incumbent.
(Actually it is a few miles from Bray, but perhaps at that time the
two livings were one.) In the churchyard there stands a magnificent
yew tree which, according to a notice at its foot, was planted by
no less a person than the Vicar of Bray himself. And it struck me
at the time as curious that such a man should have left such a
relic behind him.</p>

<p>The Vicar of Bray, though he was well equipped to be a
leader-writer on THE TIMES, could hardly be described as an
admirable character. Yet, after this lapse of time, all that is
left of him is a comic song and a beautiful tree, which has rested
the eyes of generation after generation and must surely have
outweighed any bad effects which he produced by his political
quislingism.</p>

<p>Thibaw, the last King of Burma, was also far from being a good
man. He was a drunkard, he had five hundred wives&mdash;he seems to
have kept them chiefly for show, however&mdash;and when he came to
the throne his first act was to decapitate seventy or eighty of his
brothers. Yet he did posterity a good turn by planting the dusty
streets of Mandalay with tamarind trees which cast a pleasant shade
until the Japanese incendiary bombs burned them down in 1942.</p>

<p>The poet, James Shirley, seems to have generalised too freely
when he said that "Only the actions of the just Smell sweet and
blossom in their dust". Sometimes the actions of the unjust make
quite a good showing after the appropriate lapse of time. When I
saw the Vicar of Bray's yew tree it reminded me of something, and
afterwards I got hold of a book of selections from the writings of
John Aubrey and reread a pastoral poem which must have been written
some time in the first half of the seventeenth century, and which
was inspired by a certain Mrs Overall.</p>

<p>Mrs Overall was the wife of a Dean and was extensively
unfaithful to him. According to Aubrey she "could scarcely denie
any one", and she had "the loveliest Eies that were ever seen, but
wondrous wanton". The poem (the "shepherd swaine" seems to have
been somebody called Sir John Selby) starts off:</p>

<pre>
Downe lay the Shepherd Swaine
So sober and demure
Wishing for his wench againe
So bonny and so pure
With his head on hillock lowe
And his arms akimboe
And all was for the losse of his
Hye nonny nonny noe...
Sweet she was, as kind a love
As ever fetter'd Swaine;
Never such a daynty one
Shall man enjoy again.
Sett a thousand on a rowe
I forbid that any showe
Ever the like of her
Hye nonny nonny noe.
</pre>

<p>As the poem proceeds through another six verses, the refrain
"Hye nonny nonny noe" takes on an unmistakably obscene meaning, but
it ends with the exquisite stanza:</p>

<pre>
But gone she is the prettiest lasse
That ever trod on plaine.
What ever hath betide of her
Blame not the Shepherd Swaine.
For why? She was her owne Foe,
And gave herself the overthrowe
By being so franke of her
Hye nonny nonny noe.
</pre>

<p>Mrs Overall was no more an exemplary character than the Vicar of
Bray, though a more attractive one. Yet in the end all that remains
of her is a poem which still gives pleasure to many people, though
for some reason it never gets into the anthologies. The suffering
which she presumably caused, and the misery and futility in which
her own life must have ended, have been transformed into a sort of
lingering fragrance like the smell of tobacco-plants on a summer
evening.</p>

<p>But to come back to trees. The planting of a tree, especially
one of the long-living hardwood trees, is a gift which you can make
to posterity at almost no cost and with almost no trouble, and if
the tree takes root it will far outlive the visible effect of any
of your other actions, good or evil. A year or two ago I wrote a
few paragraphs in TRIBUNE about some sixpenny rambler roses from
Woolworth's which I had planted before the war. This brought me an
indignant letter from a reader who said that roses are bourgeois,
but I still think that my sixpence was better spent than if it had
gone on cigarettes or even on one of the excellent Fabian Research
Pamphlets.</p>

<p>Recently, I spent a day at the cottage where I used to live, and
noted with a pleased surprise&mdash;to be exact, it was a feeling
of having done good unconsciously&mdash;the progress of the things
I had planted nearly ten years ago. I think it is worth recording
what some of them cost, just to show what you can do with a few
shillings if you invest them in something that grows.</p>

<p>First of all there were the two ramblers from Woolworth's, and
three polyantha roses, all at sixpence each. Then there were two
bush roses which were part of a job lot from a nursery garden. This
job lot consisted of six fruit trees, three rose bushes and two
gooseberry bushes, all for ten shillings. One of the fruit trees
and one of the rose bushes died, but the rest are all flourishing.
The sum total is five fruit trees, seven roses and two gooseberry
bushes, all for twelve and sixpence. These plants have not entailed
much work, and have had nothing spent on them beyond the original
amount. They never even received any manure, except what I
occasionally collected in a bucket when one of the farm horses
happened to have halted outside the gate.</p>

<p>Between them, in nine years, those seven rose bushes will have
given what would add up to a hundred or a hundred and fifty months
of bloom. The fruit trees, which were mere saplings when I put them
in, are now just about getting in their stride. Last week one them,
a plum, was a mass of blossom, and the apples looked as if they
were going to do fairly well. What had originally been the weakling
of the family, a Cox's Orange Pippin&mdash;it would hardly have
been included in the job lot if it had been a good plant&mdash;had
grown into a sturdy tree with plenty of fruit spurs on it. I
maintain that it was a public-spirited action to plant that Cox,
for these trees do not fruit quickly and I did not expect to stay
there long. I never had an apple off it myself, but it looks as if
someone else will have quite a lot. By their fruits ye shall know
them, and the Cox's Orange Pippin is a good fruit to be known by.
Yet I did not plant it with the conscious intention of doing
anybody a good turn. I just saw the job lot going cheap and stuck
the things into the ground without much preparation.</p>

<p>A thing which I regret, and which I will try to remedy some
time, is that I have never in my life planted a walnut. Nobody does
plant them nowadays&mdash;when you see a walnut it is almost
invariably an old tree. If you plant a walnut you are planting it
for your grandchildren, and who cares a damn for his grandchildren?
Nor does anybody plant a quince, a mulberry or a medlar. But these
are garden trees which you can only be expected to plant if you
have a patch of ground of your own. On the other hand, in any hedge
or in any piece of waste ground you happen to be walking through,
you can do something to remedy the appalling massacre of trees,
especially oaks, ashes, elms and beeches, which has happened during
the war years.</p>

<p>Even an apple tree is liable to live for about 100 years, so
that the Cox I planted in 1936 may still be bearing fruit well into
the twenty-first century. An oak or a beech may live for hundreds
of years and be a pleasure to thousands or tens of thousands of
people before it is finally sawn up into timber. I am not
suggesting that one can discharge all one's obligations towards
society by means of a private re-afforestation scheme. Still, it
might not be a bad idea, every time you commit an antisocial act,
to make a note of it in your diary, and then, at the appropriate
season, push an acorn into the ground.</p>

<p>And, if even one in twenty of them came to maturity, you might
do quite a lot of harm in your lifetime, and still, like the Vicar
of Bray, end up as a public benefactor after all.</p>

<h2>A NICE CUP OF TEA (1946)</h2>

<p>If you look up 'tea' in the first cookery book that comes to
hand you will probably find that it is unmentioned; or at most you
will find a few lines of sketchy instructions which give no ruling
on several of the most important points.</p>

<p>This is curious, not only because tea is one of the main stays
of civilization in this country, as well as in Eire, Australia and
New Zealand, but because the best manner of making it is the
subject of violent disputes.</p>

<p>When I look through my own recipe for the perfect cup of tea, I
find no fewer than eleven outstanding points. On perhaps two of
them there would be pretty general agreement, but at least four
others are acutely controversial. Here are my own eleven rules,
every one of which I regard as golden:</p>

<p>First of all, one should use Indian or Ceylonese tea. China tea
has virtues which are not to be despised nowadays&mdash;it is
economical, and one can drink it without milk&mdash;but there is
not much stimulation in it. One does not feel wiser, braver or more
optimistic after drinking it. Anyone who has used that comforting
phrase 'a nice cup of tea' invariably means Indian tea. Secondly,
tea should be made in small quantities&mdash;that is, in a teapot.
Tea out of an urn is always tasteless, while army tea, made in a
cauldron, tastes of grease and whitewash. The teapot should be made
of china or earthenware. Silver or Britanniaware teapots produce
inferior tea and enamel pots are worse; though curiously enough a
pewter teapot (a rarity nowadays) is not so bad. Thirdly, the pot
should be warmed beforehand. This is better done by placing it on
the hob than by the usual method of swilling it out with hot water.
Fourthly, the tea should be strong. For a pot holding a quart, if
you are going to fill it nearly to the brim, six heaped teaspoons
would be about right. In a time of rationing, this is not an idea
that can be realized on every day of the week, but I maintain that
one strong cup of tea is better than twenty weak ones. All true tea
lovers not only like their tea strong, but like it a little
stronger with each year that passes&mdash;a fact which is
recognized in the extra ration issued to old-age pensioners.
Fifthly, the tea should be put straight into the pot. No strainers,
muslin bags or other devices to imprison the tea. In some countries
teapots are fitted with little dangling baskets under the spout to
catch the stray leaves, which are supposed to be harmful. Actually
one can swallow tea-leaves in considerable quantities without ill
effect, and if the tea is not loose in the pot it never infuses
properly. Sixthly, one should take the teapot to the kettle and not
the other way about. The water should be actually boiling at the
moment of impact, which means that one should keep it on the flame
while one pours. Some people add that one should only use water
that has been freshly brought to the boil, but I have never noticed
that it makes any difference. Seventhly, after making the tea, one
should stir it, or better, give the pot a good shake, afterwards
allowing the leaves to settle. Eighthly, one should drink out of a
good breakfast cup&mdash;that is, the cylindrical type of cup, not
the flat, shallow type. The breakfast cup holds more, and with the
other kind one's tea is always half cold&mdash;before one has well
started on it. Ninthly, one should pour the cream off the milk
before using it for tea. Milk that is too creamy always gives tea a
sickly taste. Tenthly, one should pour tea into the cup first. This
is one of the most controversial points of all; indeed in every
family in Britain there are probably two schools of thought on the
subject. The milk-first school can bring forward some fairly strong
arguments, but I maintain that my own argument is unanswerable.
This is that, by putting the tea in first and stirring as one
pours, one can exactly regulate the amount of milk whereas one is
liable to put in too much milk if one does it the other way
round.</p>

<p>Lastly, tea&mdash;unless one is drinking it in the Russian
style&mdash;should be drunk WITHOUT SUGAR. I know very well that I
am in a minority here. But still, how can you call yourself a true
tea-lover if you destroy the flavour of your tea by putting sugar
in it? It would be equally reasonable to put in pepper or salt. Tea
is meant to be bitter, just as beer is meant to be bitter. If you
sweeten it, you are no longer tasting the tea, you are merely
tasting the sugar; you could make a very similar drink by
dissolving sugar in plain hot water.</p>

<p>Some people would answer that they don't like tea in itself,
that they only drink it in order to be warmed and stimulated, and
they need sugar to take the taste away. To those misguided people I
would say: Try drinking tea without sugar for, say, a fortnight and
it is very unlikely that you will ever want to ruin your tea by
sweetening it again.</p>

<p>These are not the only controversial points to arise in
connexion with tea drinking, but they are sufficient to show how
subtilized the whole business has become. There is also the
mysterious social etiquette surrounding the teapot (why is it
considered vulgar to drink out of your saucer, for instance?) and
much might be written about the subsidiary uses of tea leaves, such
as telling fortunes, predicting the arrival of visitors, feeding
rabbits, healing burns and sweeping the carpet. It is worth paying
attention to such details as warming the pot and using water that
is really boiling, so as to make quite sure of wringing out of
one's ration the twenty good, strong cups of that two ounces,
properly handled, ought to represent.</p>

<h2>BOOKS VS. CIGARETTES</h2>

<p>A couple of years ago a friend of mine, a newspaper editor, was
fire watching with some factory workers. They fell to talking about
his newspaper, which most of them read and approved of, but when he
asked them what they thought of the literary section, the answer he
got was: "You don't suppose we read that stuff, do you? Why, half
the time you're talking about books that cost twelve and sixpence!
Chaps like us couldn't spend twelve and sixpence on a book." These,
he said, were men who thought nothing of spending several pounds on
a day trip to Blackpool.</p>

<p>This idea that the buying, or even the reading, of books is an
expensive hobby and beyond the reach of the average person is so
widespread that it deserves some detailed examination. Exactly what
reading costs, reckoned in terms of pence per hour, is difficult to
estimate, but I have made a start by inventorying my own books and
adding up their total price. After allowing for various other
expenses, I can make a fairly good guess at my expenditure over the
last fifteen years.</p>

<p>The books that I have counted and priced are the ones I have
here, in my flat. I have about an equal number stored in another
place, so that I shall double the final figure in order to arrive
at the complete amount. I have not counted oddments such as proof
copies, defaced volumes, cheap paper-covered editions, pamphlets,
or magazines, unless bound up into book form. Nor have I counted
the kind of junky books-old school text-books and so
forth&mdash;that accumulate in the bottoms of cupboards. I have
counted only those books which I have acquired voluntarily, or else
would have acquired voluntarily, and which I intend to keep. In
this category I find that I have 442 books, acquired in the
following ways:</p>

<pre>
Bought (mostly second-hand)            251
Given to me or bought with book tokens  33
Review copies and complimentary copies 143
Borrowed and not returned               10
Temporarily on loan                      5
Total                                  442
</pre>

<p>Now as to the method of pricing. Those books that I have bought
I have listed at their full price, as closely as I can determine
it. I have also listed at their full price the books that have been
given to me, and those that I have temporarily borrowed, or
borrowed and kept. This is because book-giving, book-borrowing and
book stealing more or less even out. I possess books that do not
strictly speaking belong to me, but many other people also have
books of mine: so that the books I have not paid for can be taken
as balancing others which I have paid for but no longer possess. On
the other hand I have listed the review and complimentary copies at
half-price. That is about what I would have paid for them
second-hand, and they are mostly books that I would only have
bought second-hand, if at all. For the prices I have sometimes had
to rely on guesswork, but my figures will not be far out. The costs
were as follows:</p>

<pre>
&pound;   s.   d.
Bought                    36    9    0
Gifts                     10   10    0
Review copies, etc        25   11    9
Borrowed and not returned  4   16    9
On loan                    3   10    0
Shelves                    2    0    0
Total                     82   17    6
</pre>

<p>Adding the other batch of books that I have elsewhere, it seems
that I possess altogether nearly 900 books, at a cost of &pound;165
15s. This is the accumulation of about fifteen years&mdash;actually
more, since some of these books date from my childhood: but call it
fifteen years. This works out at &pound;11 1s. a year, but there
are other charges that must be added in order to estimate my full
reading expenses. The biggest will be for newspapers and
periodicals, and for this I think &pound;8 a year would be a
reasonable figure. Eight pounds a year covers the cost of two daily
papers, one evening paper, two Sunday papers, one weekly review and
one or two monthly magazines. This brings the figure up to
&pound;19 1s., but to arrive at the grand total one has to make a
guess. Obviously one often spends money on books without afterwards
having anything to show for it. There are library subscriptions,
and there are also the books, chiefly Penguins and other cheap
editions, which one buys and then loses or throws away. However, on
the basis of my other figures, it looks as though &pound;6 a year
would be quite enough to add for expenditure of this kind. So my
total reading expenses over the past fifteen years have been in the
neighbourhood of &pound;25 a year.</p>

<p>Twenty-five pounds a year sounds quite a lot until you begin to
measure it against other kinds of expenditure. It is nearly 9s. 9d.
a week, and at present 9s. 9d. is the equivalent of about 83
cigarettes (Players): even before the war it would have bought you
less than 200 cigarettes. With prices as they now are, I am
spending far more on tobacco than I do on books. I smoke six ounces
a week, at half-a-crown an ounce, making nearly &pound;40 a year.
Even before the war when the same tobacco cost 8d. an ounce, I was
spending over &pound;10 a year on it: and if I also averaged a pint
of beer a day, at sixpence, these two items together will have cost
me close on &pound;20 a year. This was probably not much above the
national average. In 1938 the people of this country spent nearly
&pound;10 per head per annum on alcohol and tobacco: however, 20
per cent of the population were children under fifteen and another
40 per cent were women, so that the average smoker and drinker must
have been spending much more than &pound;10. In 1944, the annual
expenditure per head on these items was no less than &pound;23.
Allow for the women and children as before, and &pound;40 is a
reasonable individual figure. Forty pounds a year would just about
pay for a packet of Woodbines every day and half a pint of mild six
days a week&mdash;not a magnificent allowance. Of course, all
prices are now inflated, including the price of books: still, it
looks as though the cost of reading, even if you buy books instead
of borrowing them and take in a fairly large number of periodicals,
does not amount to more than the combined cost of smoking and
drinking.</p>

<p>It is difficult to establish any relationship between the price
of books and the value one gets out of them. "Books" includes
novels, poetry, text books, works of reference, sociological
treatises and much else, and length and price do not correspond to
one another, especially if one habitually buys books second-hand.
You may spend ten shillings on a poem of 500 lines, and you may
spend sixpence on a dictionary which you consult at odd moments
over a period of twenty years. There are books that one reads over
and over again, books that become part of the furniture of one's
mind and alter one's whole attitude to life, books that one dips
into but never reads through, books that one reads at a single
sitting and forgets a week later: and the cost, in terms of money,
may be the same in each case. But if one regards reading simply as
a recreation, like going to the pictures, then it is possible to
make a rough estimate of what it costs. If you read nothing but
novels and "light" literature, and bought every book that you read,
you would be spending-allowing eight shillings as the price of a
book, and four hours as the time spent in reading it-two shillings
an hour. This is about what it costs to sit in one of the more
expensive seats in the cinema. If you concentrated on more serious
books, and still bought everything that you read, your expenses
would be about the same. The books would cost more but they would
take longer to read. In either case you would still possess the
books after you had read them, and they would be saleable at about
a third of their purchase price. If you bought only second-hand
books, your reading expenses would, of course, be much less:
perhaps sixpence an hour would be a fair estimate. And on the other
hand if you don't buy books, but merely borrow them from the
lending library, reading costs you round about a halfpenny an hour:
if you borrow them from the public library, it costs you next door
to nothing.</p>

<p>I have said enough to show that reading is one of the cheaper
recreations: after listening to the radio probably THE cheapest.
Meanwhile, what is the actual amount that the British public spends
on books? I cannot discover any figures, though no doubt they
exist. But I do know that before the war this country was
publishing annually about 15,000 books, which included reprints and
school books. If as many as 10,000 copies of each book were
sold&mdash;and even allowing for the school books, this is probably
a high estimate-the average person was only buying, directly or
indirectly, about three books a year. These three books taken
together might cost &pound;1, or probably less.</p>

<p>These figures are guesswork, and I should be interested if
someone would correct them for me. But if my estimate is anywhere
near right, it is not a proud record for a country which is nearly
100 per cent literate and where the ordinary man spends more on
cigarettes than an Indian peasant has for his whole livelihood. And
if our book consumption remains as low as it has been, at least let
us admit that it is because reading is a less exciting pastime than
going to the dogs, the pictures or the pub, and not because books,
whether bought or borrowed, are too expensive.</p>

<h2>CONFESSIONS OF A BOOK REVIEWER</h2>

<p>In a cold but stuffy bed-sitting room littered with cigarette
ends and half-empty cups of tea, a man in a moth-eaten
dressing-gown sits at a rickety table, trying to find room for his
typewriter among the piles of dusty papers that surround it. He
cannot throw the papers away because the wastepaper basket is
already overflowing, and besides, somewhere among the unanswered
letters and unpaid bills it is possible that there is a cheque for
two guineas which he is nearly certain he forgot to pay into the
bank. There are also letters with addresses which ought to be
entered in his address book. He has lost his address book, and the
thought of looking for it, or indeed of looking for anything,
afflicts him with acute suicidal impulses.</p>

<p>He is a man of 35, but looks 50. He is bald, has varicose veins
and wears spectacles, or would wear them if his only pair were not
chronically lost. If things are normal with him he will be
suffering from malnutrition, but if he has recently had a lucky
streak he will be suffering from a hangover. At present it is
half-past eleven in the morning, and according to his schedule he
should have started work two hours ago; but even if he had made any
serious effort to start he would have been frustrated by the almost
continuous ringing of the telephone bell, the yells of the baby,
the rattle of an electric drill out in the street, and the heavy
boots of his creditors clumping up and down the stairs. The most
recent interruption was the arrival of the second post, which
brought him two circulars and an income tax demand printed in
red.</p>

<p>Needless to say this person is a writer. He might be a poet, a
novelist, or a writer of film scripts or radio features, for all
literary people are very much alike, but let us say that he is a
book reviewer. Half hidden among the pile of papers is a bulky
parcel containing five volumes which his editor has sent with a
note suggesting that they "ought to go well together". They arrived
four days ago, but for 48 hours the reviewer was prevented by moral
paralysis from opening the parcel. Yesterday in a resolute moment
he ripped the string off it and found the five volumes to be
PALESTINE AT THE CROSS ROADS, SCIENTIFIC DAIRY FARMING, A SHORT
HISTORY OF EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY (this one is 680 pages and weighs
four pounds), TRIBAL CUSTOMS IN PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA, and a
novel, IT'S NICER LYING DOWN, probably included by mistake. His
review&mdash;800 words, say&mdash;has got to be "in" by midday
tomorrow.</p>

<p>Three of these books deal with subjects of which he is so
ignorant that he will have to read at least 50 pages if he is to
avoid making some howler which will betray him not merely to the
author (who of course knows all about the habits of book
reviewers), but even to the general reader. By four in the
afternoon he will have taken the books out of their wrapping paper
but will still be suffering from a nervous inability to open them.
The prospect of having to read them, and even the smell of the
paper, affects him like the prospect of eating cold ground-rice
pudding flavoured with castor oil. And yet curiously enough his
copy will get to the office in time. Somehow it always does get
there in time. At about nine p.m. his mind will grow relatively
clear, and until the small hours he will sit in a room which grows
colder and colder, while the cigarette smoke grows thicker and
thicker, skipping expertly through one book after another and
laying each down with the final comment, "God, what tripe!" In the
morning, blear-eyed, surly and unshaven, he will gaze for an hour
or two at a blank sheet of paper until the menacing finger of the
clock frightens him into action. Then suddenly he will snap into
it. All the stale old phrases&mdash;"a book that no one should
miss", "something memorable on every page", "of special value are
the chapters dealing with, etc etc"&mdash;will jump into their
places like iron filings obeying the magnet, and the review will
end up at exactly the right length and with just about three
minutes to go. Meanwhile another wad of ill-assorted, unappetising
books will have arrived by post. So it goes on. And yet with what
high hopes this down-trodden, nerve-racked creature started his
career, only a few years ago.</p>

<p>Do I seem to exaggerate? I ask any regular reviewer&mdash;anyone
who reviews, say, a minimum of 100 books a year&mdash;whether he
can deny in honesty that his habits and character are such as I
have described. Every writer, in any case, is rather that kind of
person, but the prolonged, indiscriminate reviewing of books is a
quite exceptionally thankless, irritating and exhausting job. It
not only involves praising trash&mdash;though it does involve that,
as I will show in a moment&mdash;but constantly INVENTING reactions
towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings whatever.
The reviewer, jaded though he may be, is professionally interested
in books, and out of the thousands that appear annually, there are
probably fifty or a hundred that he would enjoy writing about. If
he is a top-notcher in his profession he may get hold of ten or
twenty of them: more probably he gets hold of two or three. The
rest of his work, however conscientious he may be in praising or
damning, is in essence humbug. He is pouring his immortal spirit
down the drain, half a pint at a time.</p>

<p>The great majority of reviews give an inadequate or misleading
account of the book that is dealt with. Since the war publishers
have been less able than before to twist the tails of literary
editors and evoke a paean of praise for every book that they
produce, but on the other hand the standard of reviewing has gone
down owing to lack of space and other inconveniences. Seeing the
results, people sometimes suggest that the solution lies in getting
book reviewing out of the hands of hacks. Books on specialised
subjects ought to be dealt with by experts, and on the other hand a
good deal of reviewing, especially of novels, might well be done by
amateurs. Nearly every book is capable of arousing passionate
feeling, if it is only a passionate dislike, in some or other
reader, whose ideas about it would surely be worth more than those
of a bored professional. But, unfortunately, as every editor knows,
that kind of thing is very difficult to organise. In practice the
editor always finds himself reverting to his team of
hacks&mdash;his "regulars", as he calls them.</p>

<p>None of this is remediable so long as it is taken for granted
that every book deserves to be reviewed. It is almost impossible to
mention books in bulk without grossly overpraising the great
majority of them. Until one has some kind of professional
relationship with books one does not discover how bad the majority
of them are. In much more than nine cases out of ten the only
objectively truthful criticism would be "This book is worthless",
while the truth about the reviewer's own reaction would probably be
"This book does not interest me in any way, and I would not write
about it unless I were paid to." But the public will not pay to
read that kind of thing. Why should they? They want some kind of
guide to the books they are asked to read, and they want some kind
of evaluation. But as soon as values are mentioned, standards
collapse. For if one says&mdash;and nearly every reviewer says this
kind of thing at least once a week&mdash;that KING LEAR is a good
play and THE FOUR JUST MEN is a good thriller, what meaning is
there in the word "good"?</p>

<p>The best practice, it has always seemed to me, would be simply
to ignore the great majority of books and to give very long
reviews&mdash;1,000 words is a bare minimum&mdash;to the few that
seem to matter. Short notes of a line or two on forthcoming books
can be useful, but the usual middle-length review of about 600
words is bound to be worthless even if the reviewer genuinely wants
to write it. Normally he doesn't want to write it, and the week-in,
week-out production of snippets soon reduces him to the crushed
figure in a dressing-gown whom I described at the beginning of this
article. However, everyone in this world has someone else whom he
can look down on, and I must say, from experience of both trades,
that the book reviewer is better off than the film critic, who
cannot even do his work at home, but has to attend trade shows at
eleven in the morning and, with one or two notable exceptions, is
expected to sell his honour for a glass of inferior sherry.</p>

<h2>DECLINE OF THE ENGLISH MURDER</h2>

<p>It is Sunday afternoon, preferably before the war. The wife is
already asleep in the armchair, and the children have been sent out
for a nice long walk. You put your feet up on the sofa, settle your
spectacles on your nose, and open the NEWS OF THE WORLD. Roast beef
and Yorkshire, or roast pork and apple sauce, followed up by suet
pudding and driven home, as it were, by a cup of mahogany-brown
tea, have put you in just the right mood. Your pipe is drawing
sweetly, the sofa cushions are soft underneath you, the fire is
well alight, the air is warm and stagnant. In these blissful
circumstances, what is it that you want to read about?</p>

<p>Naturally, about a murder. But what kind of murder? If one
examines the murders which have given the greatest amount of
pleasure to the British public, the murders whose story is known in
its general outline to almost everyone and which have been made
into novels and re-hashed over and over again by the Sunday papers,
one finds a fairly strong family resemblance running through the
greater number of them. Our great period in murder, our Elizabethan
period, so to speak, seems to have been between roughly 1850 and
1925, and the murderers whose reputation has stood the test of time
are the following: Dr. Palmer of Rugely, Jack the Ripper, Neill
Cream, Mrs. Maybrick, Dr. Crippen, Seddon, Joseph Smith, Armstrong,
and Bywaters and Thompson. In addition, in 1919 or thereabouts,
there was another very celebrated case which fits into the general
pattern but which I had better not mention by name, because the
accused man was acquitted.</p>

<p>Of the above-mentioned nine cases, at least four have had
successful novels based on them, one has been made into a popular
melodrama, and the amount of literature surrounding them, in the
form of newspaper write-ups, criminological treatises and
reminiscences by lawyers and police officers, would make a
considerable library. It is difficult to believe that any recent
English crime will be remembered so long and so intimately, and not
only because the violence of external events has made murder seem
unimportant, but because the prevalent type of crime seems to be
changing. The principal CAUSE CéL&Egrave;BRE of the war years was
the so-called Cleft Chin Murder, which has now been written up in a
popular booklet; the verbatim account of the trial was published
some time last year by Messrs. Jarrolds with an introduction by Mr.
Bechhofer Roberts. Before returning to this pitiful and sordid
case, which is only interesting from a sociological and perhaps a
legal point of view, let me try to define what it is that the
readers of Sunday papers mean when they say fretfully that "you
never seem to get a good murder nowadays".</p>

<p>In considering the nine murders I named above, one can start by
excluding the Jack the Ripper case, which is in a class by itself.
Of the other eight, six were poisoning cases, and eight of the ten
criminals belonged to the middle class. In one way or another, sex
was a powerful motive in all but two cases, and in at least four
cases respectability&mdash;the desire to gain a secure position in
life, or not to forfeit one's social position by some scandal such
as a divorce&mdash;was one of the main reasons for committing
murder. In more than half the cases, the object was to get hold of
a certain known sum of money such as a legacy or an insurance
policy, but the amount involved was nearly always small. In most of
the cases the crime only came to light slowly, as the result of
careful investigations which started off with the suspicions of
neighbours or relatives; and in nearly every case there was some
dramatic coincidence, in which the finger of Providence could be
clearly seen, or one of those episodes that no novelist would dare
to make up, such as Crippen's flight across the Atlantic with his
mistress dressed as a boy, or Joseph Smith playing "Nearer, my God,
to Thee" on the harmonium while one of his wives was drowning in
the next room. The background of all these crimes, except Neill
Cream's, was essentially domestic; of twelve victims, seven were
either wife or husband of the murderer.</p>

<p>With all this in mind one can construct what would be, from a
NEWS OF THE WORLD reader's point of view, the "perfect" murder. The
murderer should be a little man of the professional class&mdash;a
dentist or a solicitor, say&mdash;living an intensely respectable
life somewhere in the suburbs, and preferably in a semi-detached
house, which will allow the neighbours to hear suspicious sounds
through the wall. He should be either chairman of the local
Conservative Party branch, or a leading Nonconformist and strong
Temperance advocate. He should go astray through cherishing a
guilty passion for his secretary or the wife of a rival
professional man, and should only bring himself to the point of
murder after long and terrible wrestles with his conscience. Having
decided on murder, he should plan it all with the utmost cunning,
and only slip up over some tiny unforeseeable detail. The means
chosen should, of course, be poison. In the last analysis he should
commit murder because this seems to him less disgraceful, and less
damaging to his career, than being detected in adultery. With this
kind of background, a crime can have dramatic and even tragic
qualities which make it memorable and excite pity for both victim
and murderer. Most of the crimes mentioned above have a touch of
this atmosphere, and in three cases, including the one I referred
to but did not name, the story approximates to the one I have
outlined.</p>

<p>Now compare the Cleft Chin Murder. There is no depth of feeling
in it. It was almost chance that the two people concerned committed
that particular murder, and it was only by good luck that they did
not commit several others. The background was not domesticity, but
the anonymous life of the dance-halls and the false values of the
American film. The two culprits were an eighteen-year-old
ex-waitress named Elizabeth Jones, and an American army deserter,
posing as an officer, named Karl Hulten. They were only together
for six days, and it seems doubtful whether, until they were
arrested, they even learned one another's true names. They met
casually in a teashop, and that night went out for a ride in a
stolen army truck. Jones described herself as a strip-tease artist,
which was not strictly true (she had given one unsuccessful
performance in this line); and declared that she wanted to do
something dangerous, "like being a gun-moll." Hulten described
himself as a big-time Chicago gangster, which was also untrue. They
met a girl bicycling along the road, and to show how tough he was
Hulten ran over her with his truck, after which the pair robbed her
of the few shillings that were on her. On another occasion they
knocked out a girl to whom they had offered a lift, took her coat
and handbag and threw her into a river. Finally, in the most wanton
way, they murdered a taxi-driver who happened to have &pound;8 in
his pocket. Soon afterwards they parted. Hulten was caught because
he had foolishly kept the dead man's car, and Jones made
spontaneous confessions to the police. In court each prisoner
incriminated the other. In between crimes, both of them seem to
have behaved with the utmost callousness: they spent the dead
taxi-driver's &pound;8 at the dog races.</p>

<p>Judging from her letters, the girl's case has a certain amount
of psychological interest, but this murder probably captured the
headlines because it provided distraction amid the doodle-bugs and
the anxieties of the Battle of France. Jones and Hulten committed
their murder to the tune of V1, and were convicted to the tune of
V2. There was also considerable excitement because&mdash;as has
become usual in England&mdash;the man was sentenced to death and
the girl to imprisonment. According to Mr. Raymond, the reprieving
of Jones caused widespread indignation and streams of telegrams to
the Home Secretary: in her native town, "SHE SHOULD HANG" was
chalked on the walls beside pictures of a figure dangling from a
gallows. Considering that only ten women have been hanged in
Britain this century, and that the practice has gone out largely
because of popular feeling against it, it is difficult not to feel
that this clamour to hang an eighteen-year-old girl was due partly
to the brutalizing effects of war. Indeed, the whole meaningless
story, with its atmosphere of dance-halls, movie-palaces, cheap
perfume, false names and stolen cars, belongs essentially to a war
period.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is significant that the most talked-of English murder
of recent years should have been committed by an American and an
English girl who had become partly Americanized. But it is
difficult to believe that this case will be so long remembered as
the old domestic poisoning dramas, product of a stable society
where the all-prevailing hypocrisy did at least ensure that crimes
as serious as murder should have strong emotions behind them.</p>

<h2>HOW THE POOR DIE</h2>

<p>In the year 1929 I spent several weeks in the H&ocirc;pital X,
in the fifteenth ARRONDISSEMENT of Paris. The clerks put me through
the usual third-degree at the reception desk, and indeed I was kept
answering questions for some twenty minutes before they would let
me in. If you have ever had to fill up forms in a Latin country you
will know the kind of questions I mean. For some days past I had
been unequal to translating Reaumur into Fahrenheit, but I know
that my temperature was round about 103, and by the end of the
interview I had some difficulty in standing on my feet. At my back
a resigned little knot of patients, carrying bundles done up in
coloured handkerchiefs, waited their turn to be questioned.</p>

<p>After the questioning came the bath&mdash;a compulsory routine
for all newcomers, apparently, just as in prison or the workhouse.
My clothes were taken away from me, and after I had sat shivering
for some minutes in five inches of warm water I was given a linen
nightshirt and a short blue flannel dressing-gown&mdash;no
slippers, they had none big enough for me, they said&mdash;and led
out into the open air. This was a night in February and I was
suffering from pneumonia. The ward we were going to was 200 yards
away and it seemed that to get to it you had to cross the hospital
grounds. Someone stumbled in front of me with a lantern. The gravel
path was frosty underfoot, and the wind whipped the nightshirt
round my bare calves. When we got into the ward I was aware of a
strange feeling of familiarity whose origin I did not succeed in
pinning down till later in the night. It was a long, rather low,
ill-lit room, full of murmuring voices and with three rows of beds
surprisingly close together. There was a foul smell, faecal and yet
sweetish. As I lay down I saw on a bed nearly opposite me a small,
round-shouldered, sandy-haired man sitting half naked while a
doctor and a student performed some strange operation on him. First
the doctor produced from his black bag a dozen small glasses like
wine glasses, then the student burned a match inside each glass to
exhaust the air, then the glass was popped on to the man's back or
chest and the vacuum drew up a huge yellow blister. Only after some
moments did I realize what they were doing to him. It was something
called cupping, a treatment which you can read about in old medical
text-books but which till then I had vaguely thought of as one of
those things they do to horses.</p>

<p>The cold air outside had probably lowered my temperature, and I
watched this barbarous remedy with detachment and even a certain
amount of amusement. The next moment, however, the doctor and the
student came across to my bed, hoisted me upright and without a
word began applying the same set of glasses, which had not been
sterilized in any way. A few feeble protests that I uttered got no
more response than if I had been an animal. I was very much
impressed by the impersonal way in which the two men started on me.
I had never been in the public ward of a hospital before, and it
was my first experience of doctors who handle you without speaking
to you or, in a human sense, taking any notice of you. They only
put on six glasses in my case, but after doing so they scarified
the blisters and applied the glasses again. Each glass now drew
about a dessert-spoonful of dark-coloured blood. As I lay down
again, humiliated, disgusted and frightened by the thing that had
been done to me, I reflected that now at least they would leave me
alone. But no, not a bit of it. There was another treatment coming,
the mustard poultice, seemingly a matter of routine like the hot
bath. Two slatternly nurses had already got the poultice ready, and
they lashed it round my chest as tight as a strait-jacket while
some men who were wandering about the ward in shirt and trousers
began to collect round my bed with half-sympathetic grins. I
learned later that watching a patient have a mustard poultice was a
favourite pastime in the ward. These things are normally applied
for a quarter of an hour and certainly they are funny enough if you
don't happen to be the person inside. For the first five minutes
the pain is severe, but you believe you can bear it. During the
second five minutes this belief evaporates, but the poultice is
buckled at the back and you can't get it off. This is the period
the onlookers enjoy most. During the last five minutes, I noted, a
sort of numbness supervenes. After the poultice had been removed a
waterproof pillow packed with ice was thrust beneath my head and I
was left alone. I did not sleep, and to the best of my knowledge
this was the only night of my life&mdash;I mean the only night
spent in bed&mdash;in which I have not slept at all, not even a
minute.</p>

<p>During my first hour in the H&ocirc;pital X I had had a whole
series of different and contradictory treatments, but this was
misleading, for in general you got very little treatment at all,
either good or bad, unless you were ill in some interesting and
instructive way. At five in the morning the nurses came round, woke
the patients and took their temperatures, but did not wash them. If
you were well enough you washed yourself, otherwise you depended on
the kindness of some walking patient. It was generally patients,
too, who carried the bed bottles and die grim bedpan, nicknamed LA
CASSEROLE. At eight breakfast arrived, called army-fashion LA
SOUPE. It was soup, too, a thin vegetable soup with slimy hunks of
bread floating about in it. Later in the day the tall, solemn,
black-bearded doctor made his rounds, with an INTERNE and a troop
of students following at his heels, but there were about sixty of
us in the ward and it was evident that he had other wards to attend
to as well. There were many beds past which he walked day after
day, sometimes followed by imploring cries. On the other hand if
you had some disease with which the students wanted to familiarize
themselves you got plenty of attention of a kind. I myself, with an
exceptionally fine specimen of a bronchial rattle, sometimes had as
many as a dozen students queuing up to listen to my chest. It was a
very queer feeling&mdash;queer, I mean, because of their intense
interest in learning their job, together with a seeming lack of any
perception that the patients were human beings. It is strange to
relate, but sometimes as some young student stepped forward to take
his turn at manipulating you he would be actually tremulous with
excitement, like a boy who has at last got his hands on some
expensive piece of machinery. And then ear after ear&mdash;ears of
young men, of girls, of negroes&mdash;pressed against your back,
relays of fingers solemnly but clumsily tapping, and not from any
one of them did you get a word of conversation or a look direct in
your face. As a non-paying patient, in the uniform nightshirt, you
were primarily A SPECIMEN, a thing I did not resent but could never
quite get used to.</p>

<p>After some days I grew well enough to sit up and study the
surrounding patients. The stuffy room, with its narrow beds so
close together that you could easily touch your neighbour's hand,
had every sort of disease in it except, I suppose, acutely
infectious cases. My right-hand neighbour was a little red-haired
cobbler with one leg shorter than the other, who used to announce
the death of any other patient (this happened a number of times,
and my neighbour was always the first to hear of it) by whistling
to me, exclaiming "NUMéRO 43!" (or whatever it was) and flinging
his arms above his head. This man had not much wrong with him, but
in most of the other beds within my angle of vision some squalid
tragedy or some plain horror was being enacted. In the bed that was
foot to foot with mine there lay, until he died (I didn't see him
die&mdash;they moved him to another bed), a little weazened man who
was suffering from I do not know what disease, but something that
made his whole body so intensely sensitive that any movement from
side to side, sometimes even the weight of the bedclothes, would
make him shout out with pain. His worst suffering was when he
urinated, which he did with the greatest difficulty. A nurse would
bring him the bed bottle and then for a long time stand beside his
bed, whistling, as grooms are said to do with horses, until at last
with an agonized shriek of "Je fissel" he would get started. In the
bed next to him the sandy-haired man whom I had seen being cupped
used to cough up blood-streaked mucus at all hours. My left-hand
neighbour was a tall, flaccid-looking young man who used
periodically to have a tube inserted into his back and astonishing
quantities of frothy liquid drawn off from some part of his body.
In the bed beyond that a veteran of the war of 1870 was dying, a
handsome old man with a white imperial, round whose bed, at all
hours when visiting was allowed, four elderly female relatives
dressed all in black sat exactly like crows, obviously scheming for
some pitiful legacy. In the bed opposite me in the farther row was
an old bald-headed man with drooping moustaches and greatly swollen
face and body, who was suffering from some disease that made him
urinate almost incessantly. A huge glass receptacle stood always
beside his bed. One day his wife and daughter came to visit him. At
sight of them the old man's bloated face lit up with a smile of
surprising sweetness, and as his daughter, a pretty girl of about
twenty, approached the bed I saw that his hand was slowly working
its way from under the bedclothes. I seemed to see in advance the
gesture that was coming&mdash;the girl kneeling beside the bed, the
old man's hand laid on her head in his dying blessing. But no, he
merely handed her the bed bottle, which she promptly took from him
and emptied into the receptacle.</p>

<p>About a dozen beds away from me was Numéro 57&mdash;I think that
was his number&mdash;a cirrhosis-of-the-liver case. Everyone in the
ward knew him by sight because he was sometimes the subject of a
medical lecture. On two afternoons a week the tall, grave doctor
would lecture in the ward to a party of students, and on more than
one occasion old NUMéRO 57 was wheeled in on a sort of trolley into
the middle of the ward, where the doctor would roll back his
nightshirt, dilate with his fingers a huge flabby protruberance on
the man's belly&mdash;the diseased liver, I suppose&mdash;and
explain solemnly that this was a disease attributable to
alcoholism, commoner in the wine-drinking countries. As usual he
neither spoke to his patient nor gave him a smile, a nod or any
kind of recognition. While he talked, very grave and upright, he
would hold the wasted body beneath his two hands, sometimes giving
it a gentle roll to and fro, in just the attitude of a woman
handling a rolling-pin. Not that NUMéRO 57 minded this kind of
thing. Obviously he was an old hospital inmate, a regular exhibit
at lectures, his liver long since marked down for a bottle in some
pathological museum. Utterly uninterested in what was said about
him, he would lie with his colourless eyes gazing at nothing, while
the doctor showed him off like a piece of antique china. He was a
man of about sixty, astonishingly shrunken. His face, pale as
vellum, had shrunken away till it seemed no bigger than a
doll's.</p>

<p>One morning my cobbler neighbour woke me up plucking at my
pillow before the nurses arrived. "NUMéRO 57!"&mdash;he flung his
arms above his head. There was a light in the ward, enough to see
by. I could see old NUMéRO 57 lying crumpled up on his side, his
face sticking out over the side of the bed, and towards me. He had
died some rime during the night, nobody knew when. When the nurses
came they received the news of his death indifferently and went
about their work. After a long time, an hour or more, two other
nurses marched in abreast like soldiers, with a great clumping of
sabots, and knotted the corpse up in the sheets, but it was not
removed till some time later. Meanwhile, in the better light, I had
had time for a good look at NUMéRO 57. Indeed I lay on my side to
look at him. Curiously enough he was the first dead European I had
seen. I had seen dead men before, but always Asiatics and usually
people who had died violent deaths. NUMéRO 57's eyes were still
open, his mouth also open, his small face contorted into an
expression of agony. What most impressed me, however, was the
whiteness of his face. It had been pale before, but now it was
little darker than die sheets. As I gazed at the tiny, screwed-up
face it struck me that this disgusting piece of refuse, waiting to
be carted away and dumped on a slab in the dissecting room, was an
example of "natural" death, one of the things you pray for in the
Litany. There you are, then, I thought, that's what is waiting for
you, twenty, thirty, forty years hence: that is how the lucky ones
die, the ones who live to be old. One wants to live, of course,
indeed one only stays alive by virtue of the fear of death, but I
think now, as I thought then, that it's better to die violently and
not too old. People talk about the horrors of war, but what weapon
has man invented that even approaches in cruelty some of the
commoner diseases? "Natural" death, almost by definition, means
something slow, smelly and painful. Even at that, it makes a
difference if you can achieve it in your own home and not in a
public institution. This poor old wretch who had just flickered out
like a candle-end was not even important enough to have anyone
watching by his deathbed. He was merely a number, then a "subject"
for the students' scalpels. And the sordid publicity of dying in
such a place! In the H&ocirc;pital X the beds were very close
together and there were no screens. Fancy, for instance, dying like
the little man whose bed was for a while foot to foot with mine,
the one who cried out when the bedclothes touched him! I dare say
"JE PISSE!" were his last recorded words. Perhaps the dying don't
bother about such things&mdash;that at least would be the standard
answer: nevertheless dying people are often more or less normal in
their minds till within a day or so of the end.</p>

<p>In the public wards of a hospital you see horrors that you don't
seem to meet with among people who manage to die in their own
homes, as though certain diseases only attacked people at the lower
income levels. But it is a fact that you would not in any English
hospitals see some of the things I saw in the H&ocirc;pital X. This
business of people just dying like animals, for instance, with
nobody standing by, nobody interested, the death not even noticed
till the morning&mdash;this happened more than once. You certainly
would not see that in England, and still less would you see a
corpse left exposed to the view of the other patients. I remember
that once in a cottage hospital in England a man died while we were
at tea, and though there were only six of us in the ward the nurses
managed things so adroitly that the man was dead and his body
removed without our even hearing about it till tea was over. A
thing we perhaps underrate in England is the advantage we enjoy in
having large numbers of well-trained and rigidly-disciplined
nurses. No doubt English nurses are dumb enough, they may tell
fortunes with tea-leaves, wear Union Jack badges and keep
photographs of the Queen on their mantelpieces, but at least they
don't let you lie unwashed and constipated on an unmade bed, out of
sheer laziness. The nurses at the H&ocirc;pital X still had a tinge
of Mrs Gamp about them, and later, in the military hospitals of
Republican Spain, I was to see nurses almost too ignorant to take a
temperature. You wouldn't, either, see in England such dirt as
existed in the H&ocirc;pital X. Later on, when I was well enough to
wash myself in the bathroom, I found that there was kept there a
huge packing case into which the scraps of food and dirty dressings
from the ward were flung, and the wainscotings were infested by
crickets. When I had got back my clothes and grown strong on my
legs I fled from the H&ocirc;pital X, before my time was up and
without waiting for a medical discharge. It was not the only
hospital I have fled from, but its gloom and bareness, its sickly
smell and, above all, something in its mental atmosphere stand out
in my memory as exceptional. I had been taken there because it was
the hospital belonging to my ARRONDISSEMENT, and I did not learn
till after I was in it that it bore a bad reputation. A year or two
later the celebrated swindler, Madame Hanaud, who was ill while on
remand, was taken to the H&ocirc;pital X, and after a few days of
it she managed to elude her guards, took a taxi and drove back to
the prison, explaining that she was more comfortable there. I have
no doubt that the H&ocirc;pital X was quite untypical of French
hospitals even at that date. But the patients, nearly all of them
working men, were surprisingly resigned. Some of them seemed to
find the conditions almost comfortable, for at least two were
destitute malingerers who found this a good way of getting through
the winter. The nurses connived because the malingerers made
themselves useful by doing odd jobs. But the attitude of the
majority was: of course this is a lousy place, but what else do you
expect? It did not seem strange to them that you should be woken at
five and then wait three hours before starting the day on watery
soup, or that people should die with no one at their bedside, or
even that your chance of getting medical attention should depend on
catching the doctor's eye as he went past. According to their
traditions that was what hospitals were like. If you are seriously
ill and if you are too poor to be treated in your own home, then
you must go into hospital, and once there you must put up with
harshness and discomfort, just as you would in the army. But on top
of this I was interested to find a lingering belief in the old
stories that have now almost faded from memory in
England&mdash;stories, for instance, about doctors cutting you open
out of sheer curiosity or thinking it funny to start operating
before you were properly "under". There were dark tales about a
little operating-room said to be situated just beyond the bathroom.
Dreadful screams were said to issue from this room. I saw nothing
to confirm these stories and no doubt they were all nonsense,
though I did see two students kill a sixteen-year-old boy, or
nearly kill him (he appeared to be dying when I left the hospital,
but he may have recovered later) by a mischievous experiment which
they probably could not have tried on a paying patient. Well within
living memory it used to be believed in London that in some of the
big hospitals patients were killed off to get dissection subjects.
I didn't hear this tale repeated at the H&ocirc;pital X, but I
should think some of the men there would have found it credible.
For it was a hospital in which not the methods, perhaps, but
something of the atmosphere of the nineteenth century had managed
to survive, and therein lay its peculiar interest.</p>

<p>During the past fifty years or so there has been a great change
in the relationship between doctor and patient. If you look at
almost any literature before the later part of the nineteenth
century, you find that a hospital is popularly regarded as much the
same thing as a prison, and an old-fashioned, dungeon-like prison
at that. A hospital is a place of filth, torture and death, a sort
of antechamber to the tomb. No one who was not more or less
destitute would have thought of going into such a place for
treatment. And especially in the early part of the last century,
when medical science had grown bolder than before without being any
more successful, the whole business of doctoring was looked on with
horror and dread by ordinary people. Surgery, in particular, was
believed to be no more than a peculiarly gruesome form of sadism,
and dissection, possible only with the aid of body snatchers, was
even confused with necromancy. From the nineteenth century you
could collect a large horror-literature connected with doctors and
hospitals. Think of poor old George III, in his dotage, shrieking
for mercy as he sees his surgeons approaching to "bleed him till he
faints"! Think of the conversations of Bob Sawyer and Benjamin
Alien, which no doubt are hardly parodies, or the field hospitals
in LA DéB&Acirc;CLE and WAR AND PEACE, or that shocking description
of an amputation in Melville's WHITEJACKET! Even the names given to
doctors in nineteenth-century English fiction, Slasher, Carver,
Sawyer, Fillgrave and so on, and the generic nickname "sawbones",
are about as grim as they are comic. The anti-surgery tradition is
perhaps best expressed in Tennyson's poem, The Children's Hospital,
which is essentially a pre-chloroform document though it seems to
have been written as late as 1880. Moreover, the outlook which
Tennyson records in this poem had a lot to be said for it. When you
consider what an operation without anaesthetics must have been
like, what it notoriously WAS like, it is difficult not to suspect
the motives of people who would undertake such things. For these
bloody horrors which the students so eagerly looked forward to ("A
magnificent sight if Slasher does it!") were admittedly more or
less useless: the patient who did not die of shock usually died of
gangrene, a result which was taken for granted. Even now doctors
can be found whose motives are questionable. Anyone who has had
much illness, or who has listened to medical students talking, will
know what I mean. But anaesthetics were a turning point, and
disinfectants were another. Nowhere in the world, probably would
you now see the kind of scene described by Axel Munthe in THE STORY
OF SAN MICHELE, when the sinister surgeon in top hat and frock
coat, his starched shirtfront spattered with blood and pus, carves
up patient after patient with the same knife and flings the severed
limbs into a pile beside the table. Moreover, the national health
insurance has partly done away with the idea that a working-class
patient is a pauper who deserves little consideration. Well into
this century it was usual for "free" patients at the big hospitals
to have their teeth extracted with no anaesthetic. They didn't pay,
so why should they have an anaesthetic&mdash;that was the attitude.
That too has changed.</p>

<p>And yet every institution will always bear upon it some
lingering memory of its past. A barrack-room is still haunted by
the ghost of Kipling, and it is difficult to enter a workhouse
without being reminded of OLIVER TWIST. Hospitals began as a kind
of casual ward for lepers and the like to die in, and they
continued as places where medical students learned their art on the
bodies of the poor. You can still catch a faint suggestion of their
history in their characteristically gloomy architecture. I would be
far from complaining about the treatment I have received in any
English hospital, but I do know that it is a sound instinct that
warns people to keep out of hospitals if possible, and especially
out of the public wards. Whatever the legal position may be, it is
unquestionable that you have far less control over your own
treatment, far less certainty that frivolous experiments will not
be tried on you, when it is a case of "accept the discipline or get
out". And it is a great thing to die in your own bed, though it is
better still to die in your boots. However great the kindness and
the efficiency, in every hospital death there will be some cruel,
squalid detail, something perhaps too small to be told but leaving
terribly painful memories behind, arising out of the haste, the
crowding, the impersonality of a place where every day people are
dying among strangers.</p>

<p>The dread of hospitals probably still survives among the very
poor, and in all of us it has only recently disappeared. It is a
dark patch not far beneath the surface of our minds. I have said
earlier that when I entered the ward at the H&ocirc;pital X I was
conscious of a strange feeling of familiarity. What the scene
reminded me of, of course, was the reeking, pain-filled hospitals
of the nineteenth century, which I had never seen but of which I
had a traditional knowledge. And something, perhaps the black-clad
doctor with his frowsy black bag, or perhaps only the sickly smell,
played the queer trick of unearthing from my memory that poem of
Tennyson's, The Children's Hospital, which I had not thought of for
twenty years. It happened that as a child I had had it read aloud
to me by a sick-nurse whose own working life might have stretched
back to the time when Tennyson wrote the poem. The horrors and
sufferings of the old-style hospitals were a vivid memory to her.
We had shuddered over the poem together, and then seemingly I had
forgotten it. Even its name would probably have recalled nothing to
me. But the first glimpse of the ill-lit murmurous room, with the
beds so close together, suddenly roused the train of thought to
which it belonged, and in the night that followed I found myself
remembering the whole story and atmosphere of the poem, with many
of its lines complete.</p>

<h2>JAMES BURNHAM AND THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION</h2>

<p>[Note: This essay was originally printed in POLEMIC under the
title "Second Thoughts on James Burnham", and later reprinted as a
pamphlet with the present title.]</p>

<p>James Burnham's book, THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION, made a
considerable stir both in the United States and in this country at
the time when it was published, and its main thesis has been so
much discussed that a detailed exposition of it is hardly
necessary. As shortly as I can summarise it, the thesis is
this:</p>

<p>Capitalism is disappearing, but Socialism is not replacing it.
What is now arising is a new kind of planned, centralised society
which will be neither capitalist nor, in any accepted sense of the
word, democratic. The rulers of this new society will be the people
who effectively control the means of production: that is, business
executives, technicians, bureaucrats and soldiers, lumped together
by Burnham, under the name of "managers". These people will
eliminate the old capitalist class, crush the working class, and so
organise society that all power and economic privilege remain in
their own hands. Private property rights will be abolished, but
common ownership will not be established. The new "managerial"
societies will not consist of a patchwork of small, independent
states, but of great super-states grouped round the main industrial
centres in Europe, Asia, and America. These super-states will fight
among themselves for possession of the remaining uncaptured
portions of the earth, but will probably be unable to conquer one
another completely. Internally, each society will be hierarchical,
with an aristocracy of talent at the top and a mass of semi-slaves
at the bottom.</p>

<p>In his next published book, THE MACHIAVELLIANS, Burnham
elaborates and also modifies his original statement. The greater
part of the book is an exposition of the theories of Machiavelli
and of his modern disciples, Mosca, Michels, and Pareto: with
doubtful justification, Burnham adds to these the syndicalist
writer, Georges Sorel. What Burnham is mainly concerned to show is
that a democratic society has never existed and, so far as we can
see, never will exist. Society is of its nature oligarchical, and
the power of the oligarchy always rests upon force and fraud.
Burnham does not deny that "good" motives may operate in private
life, but he maintains that politics consists of the struggle for
power, and nothing else. All historical changes finally boil down
to the replacement of one ruling class by another. All talk about
democracy, liberty, equality, fraternity, all revolutionary
movements, all visions of Utopia, or "the classless society", or
"the Kingdom of Heaven on earth", are humbug (not necessarily
conscious humbug) covering the ambitions of some new class which is
elbowing its way into power. The English Puritans, the Jacobins,
the Bolsheviks, were in each case simply power seekers using the
hopes of the masses in order to win a privileged position for
themselves. Power can sometimes be won or maintained without
violence, but never without fraud, because it is necessary to make
use of the masses, and the masses would not co-operate if they knew
that they were simply serving the purposes of a minority. In each
great revolutionary struggle the masses are led on by vague dreams
of human brotherhood, and then, when the new ruling class is well
established in power, they are thrust back into servitude. This is
practically the whole of political history, as Burnham sees it.</p>

<p>Where the second book departs from the earlier one is in
asserting that the whole process could be somewhat moralised if the
facts were faced more honestly. THE MACHIAVELLIANS is sub-titled
DEFENDERS OF FREEDOM. Machiavelli and his followers taught that in
politics decency simply does not exist, and, by doing so, Burnham
claims, made it possible to conduct political affairs more
intelligently and less oppressively. A ruling class which
recognised that its real aim was to stay in power would also
recognise that it would be more likely to succeed if it served the
common good, and might avoid stiffening into a hereditary
aristocracy. Burnham lays much stress on Pareto's theory of the
"circulation of the élites". If it is to stay in power a ruling
class must constantly admit suitable recruits from below, so that
the ablest men may always be at the top and a new class of
power-hungry malcontents cannot come into being. This is likeliest
to happen, Burnham considers, in a society which retains democratic
habits&mdash;that is, where opposition is permitted and certain
bodies such as the press and the trade unions can keep their
autonomy. Here Burnham undoubtedly contradicts his earlier opinion.
In THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION, which was written in 1940, it is
taken as a matter of course that "managerial" Germany is in all
ways more efficient than a capitalist democracy such as France or
Britain. In the second book, written in 1942, Burnham admits that
the Germans might have avoided some of their more serious strategic
errors if they had permitted freedom of speech. However, the main
thesis is not abandoned. Capitalism is doomed, and Socialism is a
dream. If we grasp what is at issue we may guide the course of the
managerial revolution to some extent, but that revolution IS
HAPPENING, whether we like it or not. In both books, but especially
the earlier one, there is a note of unmistakable relish over the
cruelty and wickedness of the processes that are being discussed.
Although he reiterates that he is merely setting forth the facts
and not stating his own preferences, it is clear that Burnham is
fascinated by the spectacle of power, and that his sympathies were
with Germany so long as Germany appeared to be winning the war. A
more recent essay, "Lenin's Heir", published in the PARTISAN REVIEW
about the beginning of 1945, suggests that this sympathy has since
been transferred to the USSR. "Lenin's Heir", which provoked
violent controversy in the American left-wing press, has not yet
been reprinted in England, and I must return to it later.</p>

<p>It will be seen that Burnham's theory is not, strictly speaking,
a new one. Many earlier writers have foreseen the emergence of a
new kind of society, neither capitalist nor Socialist, and probably
based upon slavery: though most of them have differed from Burnham
in not assuming this development to be INEVITABLE. A good example
is Hilaire Belloc's book, THE SERVILE STATE, published in 1911. THE
SERVILE STATE is written in a tiresome style, and the remedy it
suggests (a return to small-scale peasant ownership) is for many
reasons impossible: still, it does foretell with remarkable insight
the kind of things that have been happening from about 1930
onwards. Chesterton, in a less methodical way, predicted the
disappearance of democracy and private property, and the rise of a
slave society which might be called either capitalist or Communist.
Jack London, in THE IRON HEEL (1909), foretold some of the
essential features of Fascism, and such books as Wells's THE
SLEEPER AWAKES (1900), ZAMYATIN'S WE (1923), and Aldous Huxley's
BRAVE NEW WORLD (1930), all described imaginary worlds in which the
special problems of capitalism had been solved without bringing
liberty, equality, or true happiness any nearer. More recently,
writers like Peter Drucker and F.A. Voigt have argued that Fascism
and Communism are substantially the same thing. And indeed, it has
always been obvious that a planned and centralised society is
liable to develop into an oligarchy or a dictatorship. Orthodox
Conservatives were unable to see this, because it comforted them to
assume that Socialism "wouldn't work", and that the disappearance
of capitalism would mean chaos and anarchy. Orthodox Socialists
could not see it, because they wished to think that they themselves
would soon be in power, and therefore assumed that when capitalism
disappears, Socialism takes its place. As a result they were unable
to foresee the rise of Fascism, or to make correct predictions
about it after it had appeared. Later, the need to justify the
Russian dictatorship and to explain away the obvious resemblances
between Communism and Nazism clouded the issue still more. But the
notion that industrialism must end in monopoly, and that monopoly
must imply tyranny, is not a startling one.</p>

<p>Where Burnham differs from most other thinkers is in trying to
plot the course of the "managerial revolution" accurately on a
world scale, and in assuming that the drift towards totalitarianism
is irresistible and must not be fought against, though it may be
guided. According to Burnham, writing in 1940, "managerialism" has
reached its fullest development in the USSR, but is almost equally
well developed in Germany, and has made its appearance in the
United States. He describes the New Deal as "primitive
managerialism". But the trend is the same everywhere, or almost
everywhere. Always LAISSEZ-FAIRE capitalism gives way to planning
and state interference, the mere owner loses power as against the
technician and the bureaucrat, but Socialism&mdash;that is to say,
what used to be called Socialism&mdash;shows no sign of
emerging:</p>

<p>Some apologists try to excuse Marxism by saying that it has
"never had a chance". This is far from the truth. Marxism and the
Marxist parties have had dozens of chances. In Russia, a Marxist
party took power. Within a short time it abandoned Socialism; if
not in words, at any rate in the effect of its actions. In most
European nations there were during the last months of the first
world war and the years immediately thereafter, social crises which
left a wide-open door for the Marxist parties: without exception
they proved unable to take and hold power. In a large number of
countries&mdash;Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria, England,
Australia, New Zealand, Spain, France&mdash;the reformist Marxist
parties have administered the governments, and have uniformly
failed to introduce Socialism or make any genuine step towards
Socialism.... These parties have, in practice, at every historical
test&mdash;and there have been many&mdash;either failed Socialism
or abandoned it. This is the fact which neither the bitterest foe
nor the most ardent friend of Socialism can erase. This fact does
not, as some think, prove anything about the moral quality of the
Socialist ideal. But it does constitute unblinkable evidence that,
whatever its moral quality, Socialism is not going to come.</p>

<p>Burnham does not, of course, deny that the new "managerial"
régimes, like the régimes of Russia and Nazi Germany, may be CALLED
Socialist. He means merely that they will not be Socialist in any
sense of the word which would have been accepted by Marx, or Lenin,
or Keir Hardie, or William Morris, or indeed, by any representative
Socialist prior to about 1930. Socialism, until recently, was
supposed to connote political democracy, social equality and
internationalism. There is not the smallest sign that any of these
things is in a way to being established anywhere, and the one great
country in which something described as a proletarian revolution
once happened, i.e. the USSR, has moved steadily away from the old
concept of a free and equal society aiming at universal human
brotherhood. In an almost unbroken progress since the early days of
the Revolution, liberty has been chipped away and representative
institutions smothered, while inequalities have increased and
nationalism and militarism have grown stronger. But at the same
time, Burnham insists, there has been no tendency to return to
capitalism. What is happening is simply the growth of
"managerialism", which, according to Burnham, is in progress
everywhere, though the manner in which it comes about may vary from
country to country.</p>

<p>Now, as an interpretation of what is HAPPENING, Burnham's theory
is extremely plausible, to put it at the lowest. The events of, at
any rate, the last fifteen years in the USSR can be far more easily
explained by this theory than by any other. Evidently the USSR is
not Socialist, and can only be called Socialist if one gives the
word a meaning different from what it would have in any other
context. On the other hand, prophecies that the Russian régime
would revert to capitalism have always been falsified, and now seem
further than ever from being fulfilled. In claiming that the
process had gone almost equally far in Nazi Germany, Burnham
probably exaggerates, but it seems certain that the drift was away
from old-style capitalism and towards a planned economy with an
adoptive oligarchy in control. In Russia the capitalists were
destroyed first and the workers were crushed later. In Germany the
workers were crushed first, but the elimination of the capitalists
had at any rate begun, and calculations based on the assumption
that Nazism was "simply capitalism" were always contradicted by
events. Where Burnham seems to go most astray is in believing
"managerialism" to be on the up-grade in the United States, the one
great country where free capitalism is still vigorous. But if one
considers the world movement as a whole, his conclusions are
difficult to resist; and even in the United States the
all-prevailing faith in LAISSEZ-FAIRE may not survive the next
great economic crisis. It has been urged against Burnham that he
assigns far too much importance to the "managers", in the narrow
sense of the word-that is, factory bosses, planners and
technicians&mdash;and seems to assume that even in Soviet Russia it
is these people, and not the Communist Party chiefs, who are the
real holders of power. However, this is a secondary error, and it
is partially corrected in THE MACHIAVELLIANS. The real question is
not whether the people who wipe their boots on us during the next
fifty years are to be called managers, bureaucrats, or politicians:
the question is whether capitalism, now obviously doomed, is to
give way to oligarchy or to true democracy.</p>

<p>But curiously enough, when one examines the predictions which
Burnham has based on his general theory, one finds that in so far
as they are verifiable, they have been falsified. Numbers of people
have pointed this out already. However, it is worth following up
Burnham's predictions in detail, because they form a sort of
pattern which is related to contemporary events, and which reveals,
I believe, a very important weakness in present-day political
thought.</p>

<p>To begin with, writing in 1940, Burnham takes a German victory
more or less for granted. Britain is described as "dissolving", and
as displaying "all the characteristics which have distinguished
decadent cultures in past historical transitions", while the
conquest and integration of Europe which Germany achieved in 1940
is described as "irreversible". "England," writes Burnham, "no
matter with what non-European allies, cannot conceivably hope to
conquer the European continent." Even if Germany should somehow
manage to lose the war, she could not be dismembered or reduced to
the status of the Weimar Republic, but is bound to remain as the
nucleus of a unified Europe. The future map of the world, with its
three great super-states is, in any case, already settled in its
main outlines: and "the nuclei of these three super-states are,
whatever may be their future names, the previously existing
nations, Japan, Germany, and the United States."</p>

<p>Burnham also commits himself to the opinion that Germany will
not attack the USSR until after Britain has been defeated. In a
condensation of his book published in the PARTISAN REVIEW of
May-June 1941, and presumably written later than the book itself,
he says:</p>

<p>As in the case of Russia, so with Germany, the third part of the
managerial problem&mdash;the contest for dominance with other
sections of managerial society&mdash;remains for the future. First
had to come the death-blow that assured the toppling of the
capitalist world order, which meant above all the destruction of
the foundations of the British Empire (the keystone of the
capitalist world order) both directly and through the smashing of
the European political structure, which was a necessary prop of the
Empire. This is the basic explanation of the Nazi-Soviet Pact,
which is not intelligible on other grounds. The future conflict
between Germany and Russia will be a managerial conflict proper;
prior to the great world-managerial battles, the end of the
capitalist order must be assured. The belief that Nazism is
"decadent capitalism"...makes it impossible to explain reasonably
the Nazi-Soviet Pact. From this belief followed the always expected
war between Germany and Russia, not the actual war to the death
between Germany and the British Empire. The war between Germany and
Russia is one of the managerial wars of the future, not of the
anti-capitalist wars of yesterday and today.</p>

<p>However, the attack on Russia will come later, and Russia is
certain, or almost certain, to be defeated. "There is every reason
to believe... that Russia will split apart, with the western half
gravitating towards the European base and the eastern towards the
Asiatic." This quotation comes from THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION. In
the above quoted article, written probably about six months later,
it is put more forcibly: "the Russian weaknesses indicate that
Russia will not be able to endure, that it will crack apart, and
fall towards east and west." And in a supplementary note which was
added to the English (Pelican) edition, and which appears to have
been written at the end of 1941, Burnham speaks as though the
"cracking apart" process were already happening. The war, he says,
"is part of the means whereby the western half of Russia is being
integrated into the European super-state".</p>

<p>Sorting these various statements out, we have the following
prophecies:</p>

<p>1. Germany is bound to win the war.</p>

<p>2. Germany and Japan are bound to survive as great states, and
to remain the nuclei of power in their respective areas.</p>

<p>3. Germany will not attack the USSR until after the defeat of
Britain.</p>

<p>4. The USSR is bound to be defeated.</p>

<p>However, Burnham has made other predictions besides these. In a
short article in the PARTISAN REVIEW, in the summer of 1944, he
gives his opinion that the USSR will gang up with Japan in order to
prevent the total defeat of the latter, while the American
Communists will be set to work to sabotage the eastern end of the
war. And finally, in an article in the same magazine in the winter
of 1944-5, he claims that Russia, destined so short a while ago to
"crack apart", is within sight of conquering the whole of Eurasia.
This article, which was the cause of violent controversies among
the American intelligentsia, has not been reprinted in England. I
must give some account of it here, because its manner of approach
and its emotional tone are of a peculiar kind, and by studying them
one can get nearer to the real roots of Burnham's theory.</p>

<p>The article is entitled "Lenin's Heir", and it sets out to show
that Stalin is the true and legitimate guardian of the Russian
Revolution, which he has not in any sense "betrayed" but has merely
carried forward on lines that were implicit in it from the start.
In itself, this is an easier opinion to swallow than the usual
Trotskyist claim that Stalin is a mere crook who has perverted the
Revolution to his own ends, and that things would somehow have been
different if Lenin had lived or Trotsky had remained in power.
Actually there is no strong reason for thinking that the main lines
of development would have been very different. Well before 1923 the
seeds of a totalitarian society were quite plainly there. Lenin,
indeed, is one of those politicians who win an undeserved
reputation by dying prematurely. [See Note at end of paragraph] Had
he lived, it is probable that he would either have been thrown out,
like Trotsky, or would have kept himself in power by methods as
barbarous, or nearly as barbarous, as those of Stalin. The TITLE of
Burnham's essay, therefore, sets forth a reasonable thesis, and one
would expect him to support it by an appeal to the facts.</p>

<p>[Note: It is difficult to think of any politician who has lived
to be eighty and still been regarded as a success. What we call a
"great" statesman normally means one who dies before his policy has
had time to take effect. If Cromwell had lived a few years longer
he would probably have fallen from power, in which case we should
now regard him as a failure. If Pétain had died in 1930, France
would have venerated him as a hero and patriot. Napoleon remarked
once that if only a cannon-ball had happened to hit him when he was
riding into Moscow, he would have gone down to history as the
greatest man who ever lived. [Author's footnote.]]</p>

<p>However, the essay barely touches upon its ostensible subject
matter. It is obvious that anyone genuinely concerned to show that
there has been continuity of policy as between Lenin and Stalin
would start by outlining Lenin's policy and then explain in what
way Stalin's has resembled it. Burnham does not do this. Except for
one or two cursory sentences he says nothing about Lenin's policy,
and Lenin's name only occurs five times in an essay of twelve
pages: in the first seven pages, apart from the title, it does not
occur at all. The real aim of the essay is to present Stalin as a
towering, super-human figure, indeed a species of demigod, and
Bolshevism as an irresistible force which is flowing over the earth
and cannot be halted until it reaches the outermost borders of
Eurasia. In so far as he makes any attempt to prove his case,
Burnham does so by repeating over and over again that Stalin is "a
great man"&mdash;which is probably true, but is almost completely
irrelevant. Moreover, though he does advance some solid arguments
for believing in Stalin's genius, it is clear that in his mind the
idea of "greatness" is inextricably mixed up with the idea of
cruelty and dishonesty. There are curious passages in which it
seems to be suggested that Stalin is to be admired BECAUSE OF the
limitless suffering that he has caused:</p>

<p>Stalin proves himself a "great man", in the grand style. The
accounts of the banquets, staged in Moscow for the visiting
dignitaries, set the symbolic tone. With their enormous menus of
sturgeon, and roasts, and fowl, and sweets; their streams of
liquor; the scores of toasts with which they end; the silent,
unmoving secret police behind each guest; all against the winter
background of the starving multitudes of besieged Leningrad; the
dying millions at the front; the jammed concentration camps; the
city crowds kept by their minute rations just at the edge of life;
there is little trace of dull mediocrity or the hand of Babbitt. We
recognise, rather, the tradition of the most spectacular of the
Tsars, of the Great Kings of the Medes and Persians, of the Khanate
of the Golden Horde, of the banquet we assign to the gods of the
Heroic Ages in tribute to the insight that insolence, and
indifference, and brutality on such a scale remove beings from the
human level...Stalin's political techniques shows a freedom from
conventional restrictions that is incompatible with mediocrity: the
mediocre man is custom-bound. Often it is the scale of their
operations that sets them apart. It is usual, for example, for men
active in practical life to engineer an occasional frame-up. But to
carry out a frame-up against tens of thousands of persons,
important percentages of whole strata of society, including most of
one's own comrades, is so far out of the ordinary that the long-run
mass conclusion is either that the frame-up must be true&mdash;at
least "have some truth in it"&mdash;or that power so immense must
be submitted to is a "historical necessity", as intellectuals put
it...There is nothing unexpected in letting a few individuals
starve for reasons of state; but to starve by deliberate decision,
several millions, is a type of action attributed ordinarily only to
gods.</p>

<p>In these and other similar passages there may be a tinge of
irony, but it is difficult not to feel that there is also a sort of
fascinated admiration. Towards the end of the essay Burnham
compares Stalin with those semi-mythical heroes, like Moses or
Asoka, who embody in themselves a whole epoch, and can justly be
credited with feats that they did not actually perform. In writing
of Soviet foreign policy and its supposed objectives, he touches an
even more mystical note:</p>

<p>Starting from the magnetic core of the Eurasian heartland, the
Soviet power, like the reality of the One of Neo-Platonism
overflowing in the descending series of the emanative progression,
flows outward, west into Europe, south into the Near East, east
into China, already lapping the shores of the Atlantic, the Yellow
and China Seas, the Mediterranean, and the Persian Gulf. As the
undifferentiated One, in its progression, descends through the
stages of Mind, Soul, and Matter, and then through its fatal Return
back to itself; so does the Soviet power, emanating from the
integrally totalitarian centre, proceed outwards by Absorption (the
Baltics, Bessarabia, Bukovina, East Poland), Domination (Finland,
the Balkans, Mongolia, North China and, tomorrow, Germany),
Orienting Influence (Italy, France, Turkey, Iran, Central and south
China...), until it is dissipated in MH ON, the outer material
sphere, beyond the Eurasian boundaries, of momentary Appeasement
and Infiltration (England, the United States).</p>

<p>I do not think it is fanciful to suggest that the unnecessary
capital letters with which this passage is loaded are intended to
have a hypnotic effect on the reader. Burnham is trying to build up
a picture of terrifying, irresistible power, and to turn a normal
political manoeuvre like infiltration into Infiltration adds to the
general portentousness. The essay should be read in full. Although
it is not the kind of tribute that the average russophile would
consider acceptable, and although Burnham himself would probably
claim that he is being strictly objective, he is in effect
performing an act of homage, and even of self-abasement. Meanwhile,
this essay gives us another prophecy to add to the list: i.e. that
the USSR will conquer the whole of Eurasia, and probably a great
deal more. And one must remember that Burnham's basic theory
contains, in itself, a prediction which still has to be
tested&mdash;that is, that whatever else happens, the "managerial"
form of society is bound to prevail.</p>

<p>Burnham's earlier prophecy, of a Germany victory in the war and
the integration of Europe round the German nucleus, was falsified,
not only in its main outlines, but in some important details.
Burnham insists all the way through that "managerialism" is not
only more efficient than capitalist democracy or Marxian Socialism,
but also more acceptable to the masses. The slogans of democracy
and national self-determination, he says, no longer have any mass
appeal: "managerialism", on the other hand, can rouse enthusiasm,
produce intelligible war aims, establish fifth columns everywhere,
and inspire its soldiers with a fanatical morale. The "fanaticism"
of the Germans, as against the "apathy" or "indifference" of the
British, French, etc, is much emphasised, and Nazism is represented
as a revolutionary force sweeping across Europe and spreading its
philosophy "by contagion". The Nazi fifth columns "cannot be wiped
out", and the democratic nations are quite incapable of projecting
any settlement which the German or other European masses would
prefer to the New Order. In any case, the democracies can only
defeat Germany if they go "still further along the managerial road
than Germany has yet gone".</p>

<p>The germ of truth in all this is that the smaller European
states, demoralised by the chaos and stagnation of the pre-war
years, collapsed rather more quickly than they need have done, and
might conceivably have accepted the New Order if the Germans had
kept some of their promises. But the actual experience of German
rule aroused almost at once such a fury of hatred and
vindictiveness as the world has seldom seen. After about the
beginning of 1941 there was hardly any need of a positive war aim,
since getting rid of the Germans was a sufficient objective. The
question of morale, and its relation to national solidarity, is a
nebulous one, and the evidence can be so manipulated as to prove
almost anything. But if one goes by the proportion of prisoners to
other casualties, and the amount of quislingism, the totalitarian
states come out of the comparison worse than the democracies.
Hundreds of thousands of Russians appear to have gone over to the
Germans during the course of the war, while comparable numbers of
Germans and Italians had gone over to the Allies before the war
started: the corresponding number of American or British renegades
would have amounted to a few scores. As an example of the inability
of "capitalist ideologies" to enlist support, Burnham cites "the
complete failure of voluntary military recruiting in England (as
well as the entire British Empire) and in the United States". One
would gather from this that the armies of the totalitarian states
were manned by volunteers. Actually, no totalitarian state has ever
so much as considered voluntary recruitment for any purpose, nor,
throughout history, has a large army ever been raised by voluntary
means. [Note at end of paragraph] It is not worth listing the many
similar arguments that Burnham puts forward. The point is that he
assumes that the Germans must win the propaganda war as well as the
military one, and that, at any rate in Europe, this estimate was
not borne out by events.</p>

<p>[Note: Great Britain raised a million volunteers in the earlier
part of the 1914-18 war. This must be a world's record, but the
pressures applied were such that it is doubtful whether the
recruitment ought to be described as voluntary. Even the most
"ideological" wars have been fought largely by pressed men. In the
English civil war, the Napoleonic wars, the American civil war, the
Spanish civil war, etc, both sides resorted to conscription or the
press gang. (Author's footnote.)]</p>

<p>It will be seen that Burnham's predictions have not merely, when
they were verifiable, turned out to be wrong, but that they have
sometimes contradicted one another in a sensational way. It is this
last fact that is significant. Political predictions are usually
wrong, because they are usually based on wish-thinking, but they
can have symptomatic value, especially when they change abruptly.
Often the revealing factor is the date at which they are made.
Dating Burnham's various writings as accurately as can be done from
internal evidence, and then noting what events they coincided with,
we find the following relationships:</p>

<p>In THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION Burnham prophesies a German
victory, postponement of the Russo-German war until after Britain
is defeated, and, subsequently, the defeat of Russia. The book, or
much of it, was written in the second half of 1940&mdash;i.e. at a
time when the Germans had overrun western Europe and were bombing
Britain, and the Russians were collaborating with them fairly
closely, and in what appeared, at any rate, to be a spirit of
appeasement.</p>

<p>In the supplementary note added to the English edition of the
book, Burnham appears to assume that the USSR is already beaten and
the splitting-up process is about to begin. This was published in
the spring of 1942 and presumably written at the end of 1941; i.e.
when the Germans were in the suburbs of Moscow.</p>

<p>The prediction that Russia would gang up with Japan against the
USA was written early in 1944, soon after the conclusion of a new
Russo-Japanese treaty.</p>

<p>The prophecy of Russian world conquest was written in the winter
of 1944, when the Russians were advancing rapidly in eastern Europe
while the Western Allies were still held up in Italy and northern
France.</p>

<p>It will be seen that at each point Burnham is predicting A
CONTINUATION OF THE THING THAT IS HAPPENING. Now the tendency to do
this is not simply a bad habit, like inaccuracy or exaggeration,
which one can correct by taking thought. It is a major mental
disease, and its roots lie partly in cowardice and partly in the
worship of power, which is not fully separable from cowardice.</p>

<p>Suppose in 1940 you had taken a Gallup poll, in England, on the
question "Will Germany win the war?" You would have found,
curiously enough, that the group answering "Yes" contained a far
higher percentage of intelligent people&mdash;people with IQ of
over 120, shall we say&mdash;than the group answering "No". The
same would have held good in the middle of 1942. In this case the
figures would not have been so striking, but if you had made the
question "Will the Germans capture Alexandria?" or "Will the
Japanese be able to hold on to the territories they have captured
?", then once again there would have been a very marked tendency
for intelligence to concentrate in the "Yes" group. In every case
the less-gifted person would have been likelier to give a right
answer.</p>

<p>If one went simply by these instances, one might assume that
high intelligence and bad military judgement always go together.
However, it is not so simple as that. The English intelligentsia,
on the whole, were more defeatist than the mass of the
people&mdash;and some of them went on being defeatist at a time
when the war was quite plainly won&mdash;partly because they were
better able to visualise the dreary years of warfare that lay
ahead. Their morale was worse because their imaginations were
stronger. The quickest way of ending a war is to lose it, and if
one finds the prospect of a long war intolerable, it is natural to
disbelieve in the possibility of victory. But there was more to it
than that. There was also the disaffection of large numbers of
intellectuals, which made it difficult for them not to side with
any country hostile to Britain. And deepest of all, there was
admiration&mdash;though only in a very few cases conscious
admiration&mdash;for the power, energy, and cruelty of the Nazi
régime. It would be a useful though tedious labour to go through
the left-wing press and enumerate all the hostile references to
Nazism during the years 1935-45. One would find, I have little
doubt, that they reached their high-water mark in 1937-8 and
1944-5, and dropped off noticeably in the years 1939-42&mdash;that
is, during the period when Germany seemed to be winning. One would
find, also, the same people advocating a compromise peace in 1940
and approving the dismemberment of Germany in 1945. And if one
studied the reactions of the English intelligentsia towards the
USSR, there, too, one would find genuinely progressive impulses
mixed up with admiration for power and cruelty. It would be grossly
unfair to suggest that power worship is the only motive for
russophile feeling, but it is one motive, and among intellectuals
it is probably the strongest one.</p>

<p>Power worship blurs political judgement because it leads, almost
unavoidably, to the belief that present trends will continue.
Whoever is winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible.
If the Japanese have conquered south Asia, then they will keep
south Asia for ever, if the Germans have captured Tobruk, they will
infallibly capture Cairo; if the Russians are in Berlin, it will
not be long before they are in London: and so on. This habit of
mind leads also to the belief that things will happen more quickly,
completely, and catastrophically than they ever do in practice. The
rise and fall of empires, the disappearance of cultures and
religions, are expected to happen with earthquake suddenness, and
processes which have barely started are talked about as though they
were already at an end. Burnham's writings are full of apocalyptic
visions. Nations, governments, classes and social systems are
constantly described as expanding, contracting, decaying,
dissolving, toppling, crashing, crumbling, crystallising, and, in
general, behaving in an unstable and melodramatic way. The slowness
of historical change, the fact that any epoch always contains a
great deal of the last epoch, is never sufficiently allowed for.
Such a manner of thinking is bound to lead to mistaken prophecies,
because, even when it gauges the direction of events rightly, it
will miscalculate their tempo. Within the space of five years
Burnham foretold the domination of Russia by Germany and of Germany
by Russia. In each case he was obeying the same instinct: the
instinct to bow down before the conqueror of the moment, to accept
the existing trend as irreversible. With this in mind one can
criticise his theory in a broader way.</p>

<p>The mistakes I have pointed out do not disprove Burnham's
theory, but they do cast light on his probable reasons for holding
it. In this connection one cannot leave out of account the fact
that Burnham is an American. Every political theory has a certain
regional tinge about it, and every nation, every culture, has its
own characteristic prejudices and patches of ignorance. There are
certain problems that must almost inevitably be seen in a different
perspective according to the geographical situation from which one
is looking at them. Now, the attitude that Burnham adopts, of
classifying Communism and Fascism as much the same thing, and at
the same time accepting both of them&mdash;or, at any rate, not
assuming that either must be violently struggled against&mdash;is
essentially an American attitude, and would be almost impossible
for an Englishman or any other western European. English writers
who consider Communism and Fascism to be THE SAME THING invariably
hold that both are monstrous evils which must be fought to the
death: on the other hand, any Englishman who believes Communism and
Fascism to be opposites will feel that he ought to side with one or
the other. [Note 1 at end of paragraph] The reason for this
difference of outlook is simple enough and, as usual, is bound up
with wish-thinking. If totalitarianism triumphs and the dreams of
the geopoliticians come true, Britain will disappear as a world
power and the whole of western Europe will be swallowed by some
single great state. This is not a prospect that it is easy for an
Englishman to contemplate with detachment. Either he does not want
Britain to disappear&mdash;in which case he will tend to construct
theories proving the thing that he wants-or, like a minority of
intellectuals, he will decide that his country is finished and
transfer his allegiance to some foreign power. An American does not
have to make the same choice. Whatever happens, the United States
will survive as a great power, and from the American point of view
it does not make much difference whether Europe is dominated by
Russia or by Germany. Most Americans who think of the matter at all
would prefer to see the world divided between two or three monster
states which had reached their natural boundaries and could bargain
with one another on economic issues without being troubled by
ideological differences. Such a world-picture fits in with the
American tendency to admire size for its own sake and to feel that
success constitutes justification, and it fits in with the
all-prevailing anti-British sentiment. In practice, Britain and the
United States have twice been forced into alliance against Germany,
and will probably, before long, be forced into alliance against
Russia: but, subjectively, a majority of Americans would prefer
either Russia or Germany to Britain, and, as between Russia and
Germany, would prefer whichever seemed stronger at the moment.
[Note 2 at end of paragraph] It is, therefore, not surprising that
Burnham's world-view should often be noticeably close to that of
the American imperialists on the one side, or to that of the
isolationists on the other. It is a "tough" or "realistic" world
view which fits in with the American form of wish-thinking. The
almost open admiration for Nazi methods which Burnham shows in the
earlier of his two books, and which would seem shocking to almost
any English reader, depends ultimately on the fact that the
Atlantic is wider than the Channel.</p>

<p>[Note 1: The only exception I am able to think of is Bernard
Shaw, who, for some years at any rate, declared Communism and
Fascism to be much the same thing, and was in favour of both of
them. But Shaw, after all, is not an Englishman, and probably does
not feel his fate to be bound up with that of Britain. (Author's
footnote.)]</p>

<p>[Note 2 As late as the autumn of 1945, a Gallup poll taken among
the American troops in Germany showed that 51 percent "thought
Hitler did much good before 1939". This was after five years of
anti-Hitler propaganda. The verdict, as quoted, is not very
strongly favourable to Germany, but it is hard to believe that a
verdict equally favourable to Britain would be given by anywhere
near 51 per cent of the American army. (Author's footnote.)]</p>

<p>As I have said earlier, Burnham has probably been more right
than wrong about the present and the immediate past. For quite
fifty years past the general drift has almost certainly been
towards oligarchy. The ever-increasing concentration of industrial
and financial power; the diminishing importance of the individual
capitalist or shareholder, and the growth of the new "managerial"
class of scientists, technicians, and bureaucrats; the weakness of
the proletariat against the centralised state; the increasing
helplessness of small countries against big ones; the decay of
representative institutions and the appearance of one-party régimes
based on police terrorism, faked plebiscites, etc: all these things
seem to point in the same direction. Burnham sees the trend and
assumes that it is irresistible, rather as a rabbit fascinated by a
boa constrictor might assume that a boa constrictor is the
strongest thing in the world. When one looks a little deeper, one
sees that all his ideas rest upon two axioms which are taken for
granted in the earlier book and made partly explicit in the second
one. They are:</p>

<p>1. Politics is essentially the same in all ages.</p>

<p>2. Political behaviour is different from other kinds of
behaviour.</p>

<p>To take the second point first. In THE MACHIAVELLIANS, Burnham
insists that politics is simply the struggle for power. Every great
social movement, every war, every revolution, every political
programme, however edifying and Utopian, really has behind it the
ambitions of some sectional group which is out to grab power for
itself. Power can never be restrained by any ethical or religious
code, but only by other power. The nearest possible approach to
altruistic behaviour is the perception by a ruling group that it
will probably stay in power longer if it behaves decently. But
curiously enough, these generalisations only apply to political
behaviour, not to any other kind of behaviour. In everyday life, as
Burnham sees and admits, one cannot explain every human action by
applying the principle of CUI BONO? Obviously, human beings have
impulses which are not selfish. Man, therefore, is an animal that
can act morally when he acts as an individual, but becomes immoral
when he acts collectively. But even this generalisation only holds
good for the higher groups. The masses, it seems, have vague
aspirations towards liberty and human brotherhood, which are easily
played upon by power-hungry individuals or minorities. So that
history consists of a series of swindles, in which the masses are
first lured into revolt by the promise of Utopia, and then, when
they have done their job, enslaved over again by new masters.</p>

<p>Political activity, therefore, is a special kind of behaviour,
characterised by its complete unscrupulousness, and occurring only
among small groups of the population, especially among dissatisfied
groups whose talents do not get free play under the existing form
of society. The great mass of the people&mdash;and this is where
(2) ties up with (1)&mdash;will always be unpolitical. In effect,
therefore, humanity is divided into two classes: the self-seeking,
hypocritical minority, and the brainless mob whose destiny is
always to be led or driven, as one gets a pig back to the sty by
kicking it on the bottom or by rattling a stick inside a
swill-bucket, according to the needs of the moment. And this
beautiful pattern is to continue for ever. Individuals may pass
from one category to another, whole classes may destroy other
classes and rise to the dominant position, but the division of
humanity into rulers and ruled is unalterable. In their
capabilities, as in their desires and needs, men are not equal.
There is an "iron law of oligarchy", which would operate even if
democracy were not impossible for mechanical reasons.</p>

<p>It is curious that in all his talk about the struggle for power,
Burnham never stops to ask why people want power. He seems to
assume that power hunger, although only dominant in comparatively
few people, is a natural instinct that does not have to be
explained, like the desire for food. He also assumes that the
division of society into classes serves the same purpose in all
ages. This is practically to ignore the history of hundreds of
years. When Burnham's master, Machiavelli, was writing, class
divisions were not only unavoidable, but desirable. So long as
methods of production were primitive, the great mass of the people
were necessarily tied down to dreary, exhausting manual labour: and
a few people had to be set free from such labour, otherwise
civilisation could not maintain itself, let alone make any
progress. But since the arrival of the machine the whole pattern
has altered. The justification for class distinctions, if there is
a justification, is no longer the same, because there is no
mechanical reason why the average human being should continue to be
a drudge. True, drudgery persists; class distinctions are probably
re-establishing themselves in a new form, and individual liberty is
on the down-grade: but as these developments are now technically
avoidable, they must have some psychological cause which Burnham
makes no attempt to discover. The question that he ought to ask,
and never does ask, is: Why does the lust for naked power become a
major human motive exactly NOW, when the dominion of man over man
is ceasing to be necessary? As for the claim that "human nature",
or "inexorable laws" of this and that, make Socialism impossible,
it is simply a projection of the past into the future. In effect,
Burnham argues that because a society of free and equal human
beings has never existed, it never can exist. By the same argument
one could have demonstrated the impossibility of aeroplanes in
1900, or of motor cars in 1850.</p>

<p>The notion that the machine has altered human relationships, and
that in consequence Machiavelli is out of date, is a very obvious
one. If Burnham fails to deal with it, it can, I think, only be
because his own power instinct leads him to brush aside any
suggestion that the Machiavellian world of force, fraud, and
tyranny may somehow come to an end. It is important to bear in mind
what I said above: that Burnham's theory is only a variant&mdash;an
American variant, and interesting because of its
comprehensiveness&mdash;of the power worship now so prevalent among
intellectuals. A more normal variant, at any rate in England, is
Communism. If one examines the people who, having some idea of what
the Russian régime is like, are strongly russophile, one finds
that, on the whole, they belong to the "managerial" class of which
Burnham writes. That is, they are not managers in the narrow sense,
but scientists, technicians, teachers, journalists, broadcasters,
bureaucrats, professional politicians: in general, middling people
who feel themselves cramped by a system that is still partly
aristocratic, and are hungry for more power and more prestige.
These people look towards the USSR and see in it, or think they
see, a system which eliminates the upper class, keeps the working
class in its place, and hands unlimited power to people very
similar to themselves. It was only AFTER the Soviet régime became
unmistakably totalitarian that English intellectuals, in large
numbers, began to show an interest in it. Burnham, although the
English russophile intelligentsia would repudiate him, is really
voicing their secret wish: the wish to destroy the old,
equalitarian version of Socialism and usher in a hierarchical
society where the intellectual can at last get his hands on the
whip. Burnham at least has the honesty to say that Socialism isn't
coming; the others merely say that Socialism is coming, and then
give the word "Socialism" a new meaning which makes nonsense of the
old one. But his theory, for all its appearance of objectivity, is
the rationalisation of a wish. There is no strong reason for
thinking that it tells us anything about the future, except perhaps
the immediate future. It merely tells us what kind of world the
"managerial" class themselves, or at least the more conscious and
ambitious members of the class, would like to live in.</p>

<p>Fortunately the "managers" are not so invincible as Burnham
believes. It is curious how persistently, in THE MANAGERIAL
REVOLUTION, he ignores the advantages, military as well as social,
enjoyed by a democratic country. At every point the evidence is
squeezed in order to show the strength, vitality, and durability of
Hitler's crazy régime. Germany is expanding rapidly, and "rapid
territorial expansion has always been a sign, not of
decadence...but of renewal". Germany makes war successfully, and
"the ability to make war well is never a sign of decadence but of
its opposite". Germany also "inspires in millions of persons a
fanatical loyalty. This, too, never accompanies decadence". Even
the cruelty and dishonesty of the Nazi régime are cited in its
favour, since "the young, new, rising social order is, as against
the old, more likely to resort on a large scale to lies, terror,
persecution". Yet, within only five years this young, new, rising
social order had smashed itself to pieces and become, in Burnham's
usage of the word, decadent. And this had happened quite largely
because of the "managerial" (i.e. undemocratic) structure which
Burnham admires. The immediate cause of the German defeat was the
unheard-of folly of attacking the USSR while Britain was still
undefeated and America was manifestly getting ready to fight.
Mistakes of this magnitude can only be made, or at any rate they
are most likely to be made, in countries where public opinion has
no power. So long as the common man can get a hearing, such
elementary rules as not fighting all your enemies simultaneously
are less likely to be violated.</p>

<p>But, in any case, one should have been able to see from the
start that such a movement as Nazism could not produce any good or
stable result. Actually, so long as they were winning, Burnham
seems to have seen nothing wrong with the methods of the Nazis.
Such methods, he says, only appear wicked because they are new:</p>

<p>There is no historical law that polite manners and "Justice"
shall conquer. In history there is always the question of WHOSE
manners and WHOSE justice. A rising social class and a new order of
society have got to break through the old moral codes just as they
must break through the old economic and political institutions.
Naturally, from the point of view of the old, they are monsters. If
they win, they take care in due time of manners and morals.</p>

<p>This implies that literally anything can become right or wrong
if the dominant class of the moment so wills it. It ignores the
fact that certain rules of conduct have to be observed if human
society is to hold together at all. Burnham, therefore, was unable
to see that the crimes and follies of the Nazi régime MUST lead by
one route or another to disaster. So also with his new-found
admiration for Stalinism. It is too early to say in just what way
the Russian régime will destroy itself. If I had to make a
prophecy, I should say that a continuation of the Russian policies
of the last fifteen years&mdash;and internal and external policy,
of course, are merely two facets of the same thing&mdash;can only
lead to a war conducted with atomic bombs, which will make Hitler's
invasion look like a tea-party. But at any rate, the Russian régime
will either democratise itself, or it will perish. The huge,
invincible, everlasting slave empire of which Burnham appears to
dream will not be established, or, if established, will not endure,
because slavery is no longer a stable basis for human society.</p>

<p>One cannot always make positive prophecies, but there are times
when one ought to be able to make negative ones. No one could have
been expected to foresee the exact results of the Treaty of
Versailles, but millions of thinking people could and did foresee
that those results would be bad. Plenty of people, though not so
many in this case, can foresee that the results of the settlement
now being forced on Europe will also be bad. And to refrain from
admiring Hitler or Stalin&mdash;that, too, should not require an
enormous intellectual effort.</p>

<p>But it is partly a moral effort. That a man of Burnham's gifts
should have been able for a while to think of Nazism as something
rather admirable, something that could and probably would build up
a workable and durable social order, shows what damage is done to
the sense of reality by the cultivation of what is now called
"realism".</p>

<h2>PLEASURE SPOTS</h2>

<p>Some months ago I cut out of a shiny magazine some paragraphs
written by a female journalist and describing the pleasure resort
of the future. She had recently been spending some time at
Honolulu, where the rigours of war do not seem to have been very
noticeable. However, "a transport pilot...told me that with all the
inventiveness packed into this war, it was a pity someone hadn't
found out how a tired and life-hungry man could relax, rest, play
poker, drink, and make love, all at once, and round the clock, and
come out of it feeling good and fresh and ready for the job again."
This reminded her of an entrepreneur she had met recently who was
planning a "pleasure spot which he thinks will catch on tomorrow as
dog racing and dance halls did yesterday." The entrepreneur's dream
is described in some detail:</p>

<p>His blue-prints pictured a space covering several acres, under a
series of sliding roofs-for the British weather is unreliable and
with a central space spread over with an immense dance floor made
of translucent plastic which can be illuminated from beneath.
Around it are grouped other functional spaces, at different levels.
Balcony bars and restaurants commanding high views of the city
roofs, and ground-level replicas. A battery of skittle alleys. Two
blue lagoons: one, periodically agitated by waves, for strong
swimmers, and another, a smooth and summery pool, for playtime
bathers. Sunlight lamps over the pools to simulate high summer on
days when the roofs don't slide back to disclose a hot sun in a
cloudless sky. Rows of bunks on which people wearing sun-glasses
and slips can lie and start a tan or deepen an existing one under a
sunray lamp.</p>

<p>Music seeping through hundreds of grills connected with a
central distributing stage, where dance or symphonic orchestras
play or the radio programme can be caught, amplified, and
disseminated. Outside, two 1,000-car parks. One, free. The other,
an open-air cinema drive-in, cars queueing to move through
turnstiles, and the film thrown on a giant screen facing a row of
assembled cars. Uniformed male attendants check the cars, provide
free aid and water, sell petrol and oil. Girls in white satin
slacks take orders for buffet dishes and drinks, and bring them on
trays.</p>

<p>Whenever one hears such phrases as "pleasure spot", "pleasure
resort", "pleasure city", it is difficult not to remember the often
quoted opening of Coleridge's "Kubla Khan".</p>

<pre>
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.
So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forests ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
</pre>

<p>But it will be seen that Coleridge has got it all wrong. He
strikes a false note straight off with that talk about "sacred"
rivers and "measureless" caverns. In the hands of the
above-mentioned entrepreneur, Kubla Khan's project would have
become something quite different. The caverns, air-conditioned,
discreetly lighted and with their original rocky interior buried
under layers of tastefully-coloured plastics, would be turned into
a series of tea-grottoes in the Moorish, Caucasian or Hawaiian
styles. Alph, the sacred river, would be dammed up to make an
artificially-warmed bathing pool, while the sunless sea would be
illuminated from below with pink electric lights, and one would
cruise over it in real Venetian gondolas each equipped with its own
radio set. The forests and "spots of greenery" referred to by
Coleridge would be cleaned up to make way for glass-covered tennis
courts, a bandstand, a roller-skating rink and perhaps a nine-hole
golf course. In short, there would be everything that a
"life-hungry" man could desire.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that, all over the world, hundreds of pleasure
resorts similar to the one described above are now being planned,
and perhaps are even being built. It is unlikely that they will be
finished-world events will see to that-but they represent
faithfully enough the modern civilised man's idea of pleasure.
Something of the kind is already partially attained in the more
magnificent dance halls, movie palaces, hotels, restaurants and
luxury liners. On a pleasure cruise or in a Lyons Corner House one
already gets something more than a glimpse of this future paradise.
Analysed, its main characteristics are these:</p>

<p>1. One is never alone.</p>

<p>2. One never does anything for oneself.</p>

<p>3. One is never within sight of wild vegetation or natural
objects of any kind.</p>

<p>4. Light and temperature are always artificially regulated.</p>

<p>5. One is never out of the sound of music.</p>

<p>The music-and if possible it should be the same music for
everybody-is the most important ingredient. Its function is to
prevent thought and conversation, and to shut out any natural
sound, such as the song of birds or the whistling of the wind, that
might otherwise intrude. The radio is already consciously used for
this purpose by innumerable people. In very many English homes the
radio is literally never turned off, though it is manipulated from
time to time so as to make sure that only light music will come out
of it. I know people who will keep the radio playing all through a
meal and at the same time continue talking just loudly enough for
the voices and the music to cancel out. This is done with a
definite purpose. The music prevents the conversation from becoming
serious or even coherent, while the chatter of voices stops one
from listening attentively to the music and thus prevents the onset
of that dreaded thing, thought. For:</p>

<pre>
The lights must never go out.
The music must always play,
Lest we should see where we are;
Lost in a haunted wood,
Children afraid of the dark
Who have never been happy or good.
</pre>

<p>It is difficult not to feel that the unconscious aim in the most
typical modern pleasure resorts is a return to the womb. For there,
too, one was never alone, one never saw daylight, the temperature
was always regulated, one did not have to worry about work or food,
and one's thoughts, if any, were drowned by a continuous rhythmic
throbbing.</p>

<p>When one looks at Coleridge's very different conception of a
"pleasure dome", one sees that it revolves partly round gardens and
partly round caverns, rivers, forests and mountains with "deep
romantic chasms"-in short, round what is called Nature. But the
whole notion of admiring Nature, and feeling a sort of religious
awe in the presence of glaciers, deserts or waterfalls, is bound up
with the sense of man's littleness and weakness against the power
of the universe. The moon is beautiful partly because we cannot
reach it, the sea is impressive because one can never be sure of
crossing it safely. Even the pleasure one takes in a flower-and
this is true even of a botanist who knows all there is to be known
about the flower is dependent partly on the sense of mystery. But
meanwhile man's power over Nature is steadily increasing. With the
aid of the atomic bomb we could literally move mountains: we could
even, so it is said, alter the climate of the earth by melting the
polar ice-caps and irrigating the Sahara. Isn't there, therefore,
something sentimental and obscurantist in preferring bird-song to
swing music and in wanting to leave a few patches of wildness here
and there instead of covering the whole surface of the earth with a
network of Autobahnen flooded by artificial sunlight?</p>

<p>The question only arises because in exploring the physical
universe man has made no attempt to explore himself. Much of what
goes by the name of pleasure is simply an effort to destroy
consciousness. If one started by asking, what is man? what are his
needs? how can he best express himself? one would discover that
merely having the power to avoid work and live one's life from
birth to death in electric light and to the tune of tinned music is
not a reason for doing so. Man needs warmth, society, leisure,
comfort and security: he also needs solitude, creative work and the
sense of wonder. If he recognised this he could use the products of
science and industrialism eclectically, applying always the same
test: does this make me more human or less human? He would then
learn that the highest happiness does not lie in relaxing, resting,
playing poker, drinking and making love simultaneously. And the
instinctive horror which all sensitive people feel at the
progressive mechanisation of life would be seen not to be a mere
sentimental archaism, but to be fully justified. For man only stays
human by preserving large patches of simplicity in his life, while
the tendency of many modern inventions-in particular the film, the
radio and the aeroplane-is to weaken his consciousness, dull his
curiosity, and, in general, drive him nearer to the animals.</p>

<h2>POLITICS AND THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE</h2>

<p>Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that
the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed
that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our
civilization is decadent, and our language&mdash;so the argument
runs&mdash;must inevitably share in the general collapse. It
follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a
sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or
hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious
belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument
which we shape for our own purposes.</p>

<p>Now, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately
have political and economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad
influence of this or that individual writer. But an effect can
become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the
same effect in an intensified form, and so on indefinitely. A man
may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and
then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather
the same thing that is happening to the English language. It
becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but
the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have
foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible.
Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits
which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is
willing to take the necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these
habits one can think more clearly, and to think clearly is a
necessary first step towards political regeneration: so that the
fight against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive
concern of professional writers. I will come back to this
presently, and I hope that by that time the meaning of what I have
said here will have become clearer. Meanwhile, here are five
specimens of the English language as it is now habitually
written.</p>

<p>These five passages have not been picked out because they are
especially bad&mdash;I could have quoted far worse if I had
chosen&mdash;but because they illustrate various of the mental
vices from which we now suffer. They are a little below the
average, but are fairly representative samples. I number them so
that I can refer back to them when necessary:</p>

<p>(1) I am not, indeed, sure whether it is not true to say that
the Milton who once seemed not unlike a seventeenth-century Shelley
had not become, out of an experience ever more bitter in each year,
more alien (sic) to the founder of that Jesuit sect which nothing
could induce him to tolerate.</p>

<p>--PROFESSOR HAROLD LASKI (Essay in FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION)</p>

<p>(2) Above all, we cannot play ducks and drakes with a native
battery of idioms which prescribes such egregious collocations of
vocables as the Basic PUT UP WITH for TOLERATE or PUT AT A LOSS for
BEWILDER.</p>

<p>--PROFESSOR LANCELOT HOGBEN (INTERGLOSSA)</p>

<p>(3) On the one side we have the free personality; by definition
it is not neurotic, for it has neither conflict nor dream. Its
desires, such as they are, are transparent, for they are just what
institutional approval keeps in the forefront of consciousness;
another institutional pattern would alter their number and
intensity; there is little in them that is natural, irreducible, or
culturally dangerous. But ON THE OTHER SIDE, the social bond itself
is nothing but the mutual reflection of these self-secure
integrities. Recall the definition of love. Is not this the very
picture of a small academic? Where is there a place in this hall of
mirrors for either personality or fraternity?</p>

<p>--Essay on psychology in POLITICS (New York)</p>

<p>(4) All the "best people" from the gentlemen's clubs, and all
the frantic fascist captains, united in common hatred of Socialism
and bestial horror of the rising tide of the mass revolutionary
movement, have turned to acts of provocation, to foul incendiarism,
to medieval legends of poisoned wells, to legalize their own
destruction of proletarian organizations, and rouse the agitated
petty-bourgeoisie to chauvinistic fervor on behalf of the fight
against the revolutionary way out of the crisis.</p>

<p>--Communist pamphlet</p>

<p>(5) If a new spirit is to be infused into this old country,
there is one thorny and contentious reform which must be tackled,
and that is the humanization and galvanization of the B.B.C.
Timidity here will bespeak canker and atrophy of the soul. The
heart of Britain may lee sound and of strong beat, for instance,
but the British lion's roar at present is like that of Bottom in
Shakespeare's MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM&mdash;as gentle as any
sucking dove. A virile new Britain cannot continue indefinitely to
be traduced in the eyes, or rather ears, of the world by the effete
languors of Langham Place, brazenly masquerading as "standard
English." When the Voice of Britain is heard at nine o'clock,
better far and infinitely less ludicrous to hear aitches honestly
dropped than the present priggish, inflated, inhibited,
school-ma'am-ish arch braying of blameless bashful mewing
maidens.</p>

<p>--Letter in TRIBUNE</p>

<p>Each of these passages has faults of its own, but quite apart
from avoidable ugliness, two qualities are common to all of them.
The first is staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision.
The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he
inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as
to whether his words mean anything or not. This mixture of
vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic
of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political
writing. As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts
into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech
that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of WORDS
chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of PHRASES
tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house. I
list below, with notes and examples, various of the tricks by means
of which the work of prose-construction is habitually dodged:</p>

<p>DYING METAPHORS. A newly-invented metaphor assists thought by
evoking a visual image, while on the other hand a metaphor which is
technically "dead" (e.g., IRON RESOLUTION) has in effect reverted
to being an ordinary word and can generally be used without loss of
vividness. But in between these two classes there is a huge dump of
worn-out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are
merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing
phrases for themselves. Examples are: RING THE CHANGES ON, TAKE UP
THE CUDGELS FOR, TOE THE LINE, RIDE ROUGHSHOD OVER, STAND SHOULDER
TO SHOULDER WITH, PLAY INTO THE HANDS OF, AN AXE TO GRIND, GRIST TO
THE MILL, FISHING IN TROUBLED WATERS, ON THE ORDER OF THE DAY,
ACHILLES' HEEL, SWAN SONG, HOTBED. Many of these are used without
knowledge of their meaning (what is a "rift," for instance?), and
incompatible metaphors are frequently mixed, a sure sign that the
writer is not interested in what he is saying. Some metaphors now
current have been twisted out of their original meaning without
those who use them even being aware of the fact. For example, TOE
THE LINE is sometimes written TOW THE LINE. Another example is THE
HAMMER AND THE ANVIL, now always used with the implication that the
anvil gets the worst of it. In real life it is always the anvil
that breaks the hammer, never the other way about: a writer who
stopped to think what he was saying would be aware of this, and
would avoid perverting the original phrase.</p>

<p>OPERATORS, or VERBAL FALSE LIMBS. These save the trouble of
picking out appropriate verbs and nouns, and at the same time pad
each sentence with extra syllables which give it an appearance of
symmetry. Characteristic phrases are: RENDER INOPERATIVE, MILITATE
AGAINST, PROVE UNACCEPTABLE, MAKE CONTACT WITH, BE SUBJECTED TO,
GIVE RISE TO, GIVE GROUNDS FOR, HAVING THE EFFECT OF, PLAY A
LEADING PART (R&Ocirc;LE) IN, MAKE ITSELF FELT, TAKE EFFECT,
EXHIBIT A TENDENCY TO, SERVE THE PURPOSE OF, etc., etc. The keynote
is the elimination of simple verbs. Instead of being a single word,
such as BREAK, STOP, SPOIL, MEND, KILL, a verb becomes a PHRASE,
made up of a noun or adjective tacked on to some general-purposes
verb as PROVE, SERVE, FORM, PLAY, RENDER. In addition, the passive
voice is wherever possible used in preference to the active, and
noun constructions are used instead of gerunds (BY EXAMINATION OF
instead of BY EXAMINING). The range of verbs is further cut down by
means of the '-IZE' AND 'DE-' formations, and banal statements are
given an appearance of profundity by means of the NOT 'UN-'
formation. Simple conjunctions and prepositions are replaced by
such phrases as WITH RESPECT TO, HAVING REGARD TO, THE FACT THAT,
BY DINT OF, IN VIEW OF, IN THE INTERESTS OF, ON THE HYPOTHESIS
THAT; and the ends of sentences are saved from anti-climax by such
resounding commonplaces as GREATLY TO BE DESIRED, CANNOT BE LEFT
OUT OF ACCOUNT, A DEVELOPMENT TO BE EXPECTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE,
DESERVING OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION, BROUGHT TO A SATISFACTORY
CONCLUSION, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>PRETENTIOUS DICTION. Words like PHENOMENON, ELEMENT, INDIVIDUAL
(as noun), OBJECTIVE, CATEGORICAL, EFFECTIVE, VIRTUAL, BASIS,
PRIMARY, PROMOTE, CONSTITUTE, EXHIBIT, EXPLOIT, UTILIZE, ELIMINATE,
LIQUIDATE, are used to dress up simple statements and give an air
of scientific impartiality to biased judgments. Adjectives like
EPOCH-MAKING, EPIC, HISTORIC, UNFORGETTABLE, TRIUMPHANT, AGE-OLD,
INEVITABLE, INEXORABLE, VERITABLE, are used to dignify the sordid
processes of international politics, while writing that aims at
glorifying war usually takes on an archaic color, its
characteristic words being: REALM, THRONE, CHARIOT, MAILED FIST,
TRIDENT, SWORD, SHIELD, BUCKLER, BANNER, JACKBOOT, CLARION. Foreign
words and expressions such as CUL DE SAC, ANCIEN RéGIME, DEUS EX
MACHINA, MUTATIS MUTANDIS, STATUS QUO, GLEICHSCHALTUNG,
WELTANSCHAUUNG, are used to give an air of culture and elegance.
Except for the useful abbreviations I.E., E.G., and ETC., there is
no real need for any of the hundreds of foreign phrases now current
in English. Bad writers, and especially scientific, political and
sociological writers, are nearly always haunted by the notion that
Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones, and unnecessary
words like EXPEDITE, AMELIORATE, PREDICT, EXTRANEOUS, DERACINATED,
CLANDESTINE, SUB-AQUEOUS and hundreds of others constantly gain
ground from their Anglo-Saxon opposite numbers. [Note 1, below] The
jargon peculiar to Marxist writing (HYENA, HANGMAN, CANNIBAL, PETTY
BOURGEOIS, THESE GENTRY, LACKEY, FLUNKEY, MAD DOG, WHITE GUARD,
etc.) consists largely of words and phrases translated from
Russian, German or French; but the normal way of coining a new word
is to use a Latin or Greek root with the appropriate affix and,
where necessary, the '-ize' formation. It is often easier to make
up words of this kind (DE-REGIONALIZE, IMPERMISSIBLE, EXTRAMARITAL,
NON-FRAGMENTARY and so forth) than to think up the English words
that will cover one's meaning. The result, in general, is an
increase in slovenliness and vagueness.</p>

<p>[Note: 1. An interesting illustration of this is the way in
which the English flower names which were in use till very recently
are being ousted by Greek ones, SNAPDRAGON becoming ANTIRRHINUM,
FORGET-ME-NOT becoming MYOSOTIS, etc. It is hard to see any
practical reason for this change of fashion: it is probably due to
an instinctive turning-away from the more homely word and a vague
feeling that the Greek word is scientific. (Author's
footnote.)]</p>

<p>MEANINGLESS WORDS. In certain kinds of writing, particularly in
art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across
long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning.
[Note, below] Words like ROMANTIC, PLASTIC, VALUES, HUMAN, DEAD,
SENTIMENTAL, NATURAL, VITALITY, as used in art criticism, are
strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point
to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so
by the reader. When one critic writes, "The outstanding feature of
Mr. X's work is its living quality," while another writes, "The
immediately striking thing about Mr. X's work is its peculiar
deadness," the reader accepts this as a simple difference of
opinion If words like BLACK and WHITE were involved, instead of the
jargon words DEAD and LIVING, he would see at once that language
was being used in an improper way. Many political words are
similarly abused. The word FASCISM has now no meaning except in so
far as it signifies "something not desirable." The words DEMOCRACY,
SOCIALISM, FREEDOM, PATRIOTIC, REALISTIC, JUSTICE, have each of
them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one
another. In the case of a word like DEMOCRACY, not only is there no
agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all
sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country
democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every
kind of régime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they
might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one
meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously
dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own
private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means
something quite different. Statements like MARSHAL PéTAIN WAS A
TRUE PATRIOT, THE SOVIET PRESS IS THE FREEST IN THE WORLD, THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH IS OPPOSED TO PERSECUTION, are almost always made
with intent to deceive. Other words used in variable meanings, in
most cases more or less dishonestly, are: CLASS, TOTALITARIAN,
SCIENCE, PROGRESSIVE, REACTIONARY BOURGEOIS, EQUALITY.</p>

<p>[Note: Example: "Comfort's catholicity of perception and image,
strangely Whitmanesque in range, almost the exact opposite in
aesthetic compulsion, continues to evoke that trembling atmospheric
accumulative hinting at a cruel, an inexorably serene
timelessness...Wrey Gardiner scores by aiming at simple bulls-eyes
with precision. Only they are not so simple, and through this
contented sadness runs more than the surface bittersweet of
resignation." (POETRY QUARTERLY.) (Author's footnote.)]</p>

<p>Now that I have made this catalogue of swindles and perversions,
let me give another example of the kind of writing that they lead
to. This time it must of its nature be an imaginary one. I am going
to translate a passage of good English into modern English of the
worst sort. Here is a well-known verse from ECCLESIASTES:</p>

<p>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise,
nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of
skill; but time and chance happeneth.</p>

<p>Here it is in modern English:</p>

<p>Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the
conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities
exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but
that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be
taken into account.</p>

<p>This is a parody, but not a very gross one. Exhibit (3), above,
for instance, contains several patches of the same kind of English.
It will be seen that I have not made a full translation. The
beginning and ending of the sentence follow the original meaning
fairly closely, but in the middle the concrete
illustrations&mdash;race, battle, bread&mdash;dissolve into the
vague phrase "success or failure in competitive activities." This
had to be so, because no modern writer of the kind I am
discussing&mdash;no one capable of using phrases like "objective
consideration of contemporary phenomena"&mdash;would ever tabulate
his thoughts in that precise and detailed way. The whole tendency
of modern prose is away from concreteness. Now analyze these two
sentences a little more closely. The first contains 49 words but
only 60 syllables, and all its words are those of everyday life.
The second contains 38 words of 90 syllables: 18 of its words are
from Latin roots, and one from Greek. The first sentence contains
six vivid images, and only one phrase ("time and chance") that
could be called vague. The second contains not a single fresh,
arresting phrase, and in spite of its 90 syllables it gives only a
shortened version of the meaning contained in the first. Yet
without a doubt it is the second kind of sentence that is gaining
ground in modern English. I do not want to exaggerate. This kind of
writing is not yet universal, and outcrops of simplicity will occur
here and there in the worst-written page. Still, if you or I were
told to write a few lines on the uncertainty of human fortunes, we
should probably come much nearer to my imaginary sentence than to
the one from ECCLESIASTES.</p>

<p>As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not
consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and
inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists
in gumming together long strips of words which have already been
set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by
sheer humbug. The attraction of this way of writing, is that it is
easy. It is easier&mdash;even quicker, once you have the
habit&mdash;to say IN MY OPINION IT IS A NOT UNJUSTIFIABLE
ASSUMPTION THAT than to say I THINK. If you use ready-made phrases,
you not only don't have to hunt about for words; you also don't
have to bother with the rhythms of your sentences, since these
phrases are generally so arranged as to be more or less euphonious.
When you are composing in a hurry&mdash;when you are dictating to a
stenographer, for instance, or making a public speech&mdash;it is
natural to fall into a pretentious, Latinized style. Tags like A
CONSIDERATION WHICH WE SHOULD DO WELL TO BEAR IN MIND OR A
CONCLUSION TO WHICH ALL OF US WOULD READILY ASSENT will save many a
sentence from coming down with a bump. By using stale metaphors,
similes and idioms, you save much mental effort at the cost of
leaving your meaning vague, not only for your reader but for
yourself. This is the significance of mixed metaphors. The sole aim
of a metaphor is to call up a visual image. When these images
clash&mdash;as in THE FASCIST OCTOPUS HAS SUNG ITS SWAN SONG, THE
JACKBOOT IS THROWN INTO THE MELTING POT&mdash;it can be taken as
certain that the writer is not seeing a mental image of the objects
he is naming; in other words he is not really thinking. Look again
at the examples I gave at the beginning of this essay. Professor
Laski (1) uses five negatives in 53 words. One of these is
superfluous, making nonsense of the whole passage, and in addition
there is the slip ALIEN for akin, making further nonsense, and
several avoidable pieces of clumsiness which increase the general
vagueness. Professor Hogben (2) plays ducks and drakes with a
battery which is able to write prescriptions, and, while
disapproving of the everyday phrase PUT UP WITH, is unwilling to
look EGREGIOUS up in the dictionary and see what it means. (3), if
one takes an uncharitable attitude towards it, is simply
meaningless: probably one could work out its intended meaning by
reading the whole of the article in which it occurs. In (4), the
writer knows more or less what he wants to say, but an accumulation
of stale phrases chokes him like tea leaves blocking a sink. In
(5), words and meaning have almost parted company. People who write
in this manner usually have a general emotional meaning&mdash;they
dislike one thing and want to express solidarity with
another&mdash;but they are not interested in the detail of what
they are saying. A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he
writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I
trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will
make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And
he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly?
Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not
obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply
throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come
crowding in. They will construct your sentences for you&mdash;even
think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent-and at need they
will perform the important service of partially concealing your
meaning even from yourself. It is at this point that the special
connection between politics and the debasement of language becomes
clear.</p>

<p>In our time it is broadly true that political writing is bad
writing. Where it is not true, it will generally be found that the
writer is some kind of rebel, expressing his private opinions and
not a "party line." Orthodoxy, of whatever color, seems to demand a
lifeless, imitative style. The political dialects to be found in
pamphlets, leading articles, manifestoes, White Papers and the
speeches of under-secretaries do, of course, vary from party to
party, but they are all alike in that one almost never finds in
them a fresh, vivid, home-made turn of speech. When one watches
some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar
phrases&mdash;BESTIAL ATROCITIES, IRON HEEL, BLOODSTAINED TYRANNY,
FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER&mdash;one
often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human
being but some kind of dummy: a feeling which suddenly becomes
stronger at moments when the light catches the speaker's spectacles
and turns them into blank discs which seem to have no eyes behind
them. And this is not altogether fanciful. A speaker who uses that
kind of phraseology has gone some distance towards turning himself
into a machine. The appropriate noises are coming out of his
larynx, but his brain is not involved as it would be if he were
choosing his words for himself. If the speech he is making is one
that he is accustomed to make over and over again, he may be almost
unconscious of what he is saying, as one is when one utters the
responses in church. And this reduced state of consciousness, if
not indispensable, is at any rate favorable to political
conformity.</p>

<p>In our time, political speech and writing are largely the
defense of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British
rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of
the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by
arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which
do not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus
political language has to consist largely of euphemism,
question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages
are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the
countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with
incendiary bullets: this is called PACIFICATION. Millions of
peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the
roads with no more than they can carry: this is called TRANSFER OF
POPULATION or RECTIFICATION OF FRONTIERS. People are imprisoned for
years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die
of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called ELIMINATION OF
UNRELIABLE ELEMENTS. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to
name things without calling up mental pictures of them. Consider
for instance some comfortable English professor defending Russian
totalitarianism. He cannot say outright, "I believe in killing off
your opponents when you can get good results by doing so."
Probably, therefore, he will say something like this:</p>

<p>While freely conceding that the Soviet régime exhibits certain
features which the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we
must, I think, agree that a certain curtailment of the right to
political opposition is an unavoidable concomitant of transitional
periods, and that the rigors which the Russian people have been
called upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of
concrete achievement.</p>

<p>The inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism. A mass of
Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the
outlines and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear
language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and
one's declared aims, one turns, as it were instinctively, to long
words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink. In
our age there is no such thing as "keeping out of politics." All
issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies,
evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia. When the general
atmosphere is bad, language must suffer. I should expect to
find&mdash;this is a guess which I have not sufficient knowledge to
verify&mdash;that the German, Russian and Italian languages have
all deteriorated in the last ten or fifteen years as a result of
dictatorship.</p>

<p>But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt
thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation, even
among people who should and do know better. The debased language
that I have been discussing is in some ways very convenient.
Phrases like A NOT UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSUMPTION, LEAVES MUCH TO BE
DESIRED, WOULD SERVE NO GOOD PURPOSE, A CONSIDERATION WHICH WE
SHOULD DO WELL TO BEAR IN MIND, are a continuous temptation, a
packet of aspirins always at one's elbow. Look back through this
essay, and for certain you will find that I have again and again
committed the very faults I am protesting against. By this
morning's post I have received a pamphlet dealing with conditions
in Germany. The author tells me that he "felt impelled" to write
it. I open it at random, and here is almost the first sentence that
I see: "[The Allies] have an opportunity not only of achieving a
radical transformation of Germany's social and political structure
in such a way as to avoid a nationalistic reaction in Germany
itself, but at the same time of laying the foundations of a
cooperative and unified Europe." You see, he "feels impelled" to
write&mdash;feels, presumably, that he has something new to
say&mdash;and yet his words, like cavalry horses answering the
bugle, group themselves automatically into the familiar dreary
pattern. This invasion of one's mind by ready-made phrases (LAY THE
FOUNDATIONS, ACHIEVE A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION) can only be
prevented if one is constantly on guard against them, and every
such phrase anesthetizes a portion of one's brain.</p>

<p>I said earlier that the decadence of our language is probably
curable. Those who deny this would argue, if they produced an
argument at all, that language merely reflects existing social
conditions, and that we cannot influence its development by any
direct tinkering with words and constructions. So far as the
general tone or spirit of a language goes, this may be true, but it
is not true in detail. Silly words and expressions have often
disappeared, not through any evolutionary process but owing to the
conscious action of a minority. Two recent examples were EXPLORE
EVERY AVENUE and LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED, which were killed by the
jeers of a few journalists. There is a long list of fly-blown
metaphors which could similarly be got rid of if enough people
would interest themselves in the job; and it should also be
possible to laugh the NOT 'UN-' formation out of existence, [Note,
below] to reduce the amount of Latin and Greek in the average
sentence, to drive out foreign phrases and strayed scientific
words, and, in general, to make pretentiousness unfashionable. But
all these are minor points. The defense of the English language
implies more than this, and perhaps it is best to start by saying
what it does NOT imply.</p>

<p>[Note: One can cure oneself of the NOT 'UN-' formation by
memorizing this sentence: A NOT UNBLACK DOG WAS CHASING A NOT
UNSMALL RABBIT ACROSS A NOT UNGREEN FIELD. (Author's
footnote.)]</p>

<p>To begin with, it has nothing to do with archaism, with the
salvaging of obsolete words and turns of speech, or with the
setting-up of a "standard-English" which must never be departed
from. On the contrary, it is especially concerned with the
scrapping of every word or idiom which has outworn its usefulness.
It has nothing to do with correct grammar and syntax, which are of
no importance so long as one makes one's meaning clear, or with the
avoidance of Americanisms, or with having what is called a "good
prose style." On the other hand it is not concerned with fake
simplicity and the attempt to make written English colloquial. Nor
does it even imply in every case preferring the Saxon word to the
Latin one, though it does imply using the fewest and shortest words
that will cover one's meaning. What is above all needed is to let
the meaning choose the word, and not the other way about. In prose,
the worst thing one can do with words is to surrender them. When
you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if
you want to describe the thing you have been visualizing, you
probably hunt about till you find the exact words that seem to fit
it. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to
use words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to
prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the
job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your
meaning. Probably it is better to put off using words as long as
possible and get one's meaning as clear as one can through pictures
or sensations. Afterwards one can choose&mdash;not simply
ACCEPT&mdash;the phrases that will best cover the meaning, and then
switch round and decide what impressions one's words are likely to
make on another person. This last effort of the mind cuts out all
stale or mixed images, all prefabricated phrases, needless
repetitions, and humbug and vagueness generally. But one can often
be in doubt about the effect of a word or a phrase, and one needs
rules that one can rely on when instinct fails. I think the
following rules will cover most cases:</p>

<p>(i) Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which
you are used to seeing in print.</p>

<p>(ii) Never use a long word where a short one will do.</p>

<p>(iii) If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it
out.</p>

<p>(iv) Never use the passive where you can use the active.</p>

<p>(v) Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon
word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.</p>

<p>(vi) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything
barbarous.</p>

<p>These rules sound elementary, and so they are, but they demand a
deep change of attitude in anyone who has grown used to writing in
the style now fashionable. One could keep all of them and still
write bad English, but one could not write the kind of stuff that I
quoted in these five specimens at the beginning of this
article.</p>

<p>I have not here been considering the literary use of language,
but merely language as an instrument for expressing and not for
concealing or preventing thought. Stuart Chase and others have come
near to claiming that all abstract words are meaningless, and have
used this as a pretext for advocating a kind of political quietism.
Since you don't know what Fascism is, how can you struggle against
Fascism? One need not swallow such absurdities as this, but one
ought to recognize that the present political chaos is connected
with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about
some improvement by starting at the verbal end. If you simplify
your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy.
You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a
stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself.
Political language-and with variations this is true of all
political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists&mdash;is
designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to
give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this
all in a moment, but one can at least change one's own habits, and
from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send
some worn-out and useless phrase&mdash;some JACKBOOT, ACHILLES'
HEEL, HOTBED, MELTING POT, ACID TEST, VERITABLE INFERNO or other
lump of verbal refuse&mdash;into the dustbin where it belongs.</p>

<h2>POLITICS VS. LITERATURE: AN EXAMINATION OF GULLIVER'S
TRAVELS</h2>

<p>In GULLIVER'S TRAVELS humanity is attacked, or criticized, from
at least three different angles, and the implied character of
Gulliver himself necessarily changes somewhat in the process. In
Part I he is the typical eighteenth-century voyager, bold,
practical and unromantic, his homely outlook skilfully impressed on
the reader by the biographical details at the beginning, by his age
(he is a man of forty, with two children, when his adventures
start), and by the inventory of the things in his pockets,
especially his spectacles, which make several appearances. In Part
II he has in general the same character, but at moments when the
story demands it he has a tendency to develop into an imbecile who
is capable of boasting of "our noble Country, the Mistress of Arts
and Arms, the Scourge of France", etc., etc., and at the same time
of betraying every available scandalous fact about the country
which he professes to love. In Part III he is much as he was in
Part I, though, as he is consorting chiefly with courtiers and men
of learning, one has the impression that he has risen in the social
scale. In Part IV he conceives a horror of the human race which is
not apparent, or only intermittently apparent, in the earlier
books, and changes into a sort of unreligious anchorite whose one
desire is to live in some desolate spot where he can devote himself
to meditating on the goodness of the Houyhnhnms. However, these
inconsistencies are forced upon Swift by the fact that Gulliver is
there chiefly to provide a contrast. It is necessary, for instance,
that he should appear sensible in Part I and at least
intermittently silly in Part II because in both books the essential
manoeuvre is the same, i.e. to make the human being look ridiculous
by imagining him as a creature six inches high. Whenever Gulliver
is not acting as a stooge there is a sort of continuity in his
character, which comes out especially in his resourcefulness and
his observation of physical detail. He is much the same kind of
person, with the same prose style, when he bears off the warships
of Blefuscu, when he rips open the belly of the monstrous rat, and
when he sails away upon the ocean in his frail coracle made from
the skins of Yahoos. Moreover, it is difficult not to feel that in
his shrewder moments Gulliver is simply Swift himself, and there is
at least one incident in which Swift seems to be venting his
private grievance against contemporary Society. It will be
remembered that when the Emperor of Lilliput's palace catches fire,
Gulliver puts it out by urinating on it. Instead of being
congratulated on his presence of mind, he finds that he has
committed a capital offence by making water in the precincts of the
palace, and I was privately assured, that the Empress, conceiving
the greatest Abhorrence of what I had done, removed to the most
distant Side of the Court, firmly resolved that those buildings
should never be repaired for her Use; and, in the Presence of her
chief Confidents, could not forbear vowing Revenge.</p>

<p>According to Professor G. M. Trevelyan (ENGLAND UNDER QUEEN
ANNE), part of the reason for Swift's failure to get preferment was
that the Queen was scandalized by A TALE OF A TUB&mdash;a pamphlet
in which Swift probably felt that he had done a great service to
the English Crown, since it scarifies the Dissenters and still more
the Catholics while leaving the Established Church alone. In any
case no one would deny that GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a rancorous as
well as a pessimistic book, and that especially in Parts I and III
it often descends into political partisanship of a narrow kind.
Pettiness and magnanimity, republicanism and authoritarianism, love
of reason and lack of curiosity, are all mixed up in it. The hatred
of the human body with which Swift is especially associated is only
dominant in Part IV, but somehow this new preoccupation does not
come as a surprise. One feels that all these adventures, and all
these changes of mood, could have happened to the same person, and
the inter-connexion between Swift's political loyalties and his
ultimate despair is one of the most interesting features of the
book.</p>

<p>Politically, Swift was one of those people who are driven into a
sort of perverse Toryism by the follies of the progressive party of
the moment. Part I of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, ostensibly a satire on
human greatness, can be seen, if one looks a little deeper, to be
simply an attack on England, on the dominant Whig Party, and on the
war with France, which&mdash;however bad the motives of the Allies
may have been&mdash;did save Europe from being tyrannized over by a
single reactionary power. Swift was not a Jacobite nor strictly
speaking a Tory, and his declared aim in the war was merely a
moderate peace treaty and not the outright defeat of England.
Nevertheless there is a tinge of quislingism in his attitude, which
comes out in the ending of Part I and slightly interferes with the
allegory. When Gulliver flees from Lilliput (England) to Blefuscu
(France) the assumption that a human being six inches high is
inherently contemptible seems to be dropped. Whereas the people of
Lilliput have behaved towards Gulliver with the utmost treachery
and meanness, those of Blefuscu behave generously and
straightforwardly, and indeed this section of the book ends on a
different note from the all-round disillusionment of the earlier
chapters. Evidently Swift's animus is, in the first place, against
ENGLAND. It is "your Natives" (i.e. Gulliver's fellow-countrymen)
whom the King of Brobdingnag considers to be "the most pernicious
Race of little odious vermin that Nature ever suffered to crawl
upon the surface of the Earth", and the long passage at the end,
denouncing colonization and foreign conquest, is plainly aimed at
England, although the contrary is elaborately stated. The Dutch,
England's allies and target of one of Swift's most famous
pamphlets, are also more or less wantonly attacked in Part III.
There is even what sounds like a personal note in the passage in
which Gulliver records his satisfaction that the various countries
he has discovered cannot be made colonies of the British Crown:</p>

<p>The HOUYHNHNMS, indeed, appear not to be so well prepared for
War, a Science to which they are perfect Strangers, and especially
against missive Weapons. However, supposing myself to be a Minister
of State, I could never give my advice for invading them...Imagine
twenty thousand of them breaking into the midst of an EUROPEAN
army, confounding the Ranks, overturning the Carriages, battering
the Warriors' Faces into Mummy, by terrible Yerks from their hinder
hoofs...</p>

<p>Considering that Swift does not waste words, that phrase,
"battering the warriors' faces into mummy", probably indicates a
secret wish to see the invincible armies of the Duke of Marlborough
treated in a like manner. There are similar touches elsewhere. Even
the country mentioned in Part III, where "the Bulk of the People
consist, in a Manner, wholly of Discoverers, Witnesses, Informers,
Accusers, Prosecutors, Evidences, Swearers, together with their
several subservient and subaltern Instruments, all under the
Colours, the Conduct, and Pay of Ministers of State", is called
Langdon, which is within one letter of being an anagram of England.
(As the early editions of the book contain misprints, it may
perhaps have been intended as a complete anagram.) Swift's PHYSICAL
repulsion from humanity is certainly real enough, but one has the
feeling that his debunking of human grandeur, his diatribes against
lords, politicians, court favourites, etc., has mainly a local
application and springs from the fact that he belonged to the
unsuccessful party. He denounces injustice and oppression, but he
gives no evidence of liking democracy. In spite of his enormously
greater powers, his implied position is very similar to that of the
innumerable silly-clever Conservatives of our own day&mdash;people
like Sir Alan Herbert, Professor G. M. Young, Lord Eiton, the Tory
Reform Committee or the long line of Catholic apologists from W. H.
Mallock onwards: people who specialize in cracking neat jokes at
the expense of whatever is "modern" and "progressive", and whose
opinions are often all the more extreme because they know that they
cannot influence the actual drift of events. After all, such a
pamphlet as AN ARGUMENT TO PROVE THAT THE ABOLISHING OF
CHRISTIANITY, etc., is very like "Timothy Shy" having a bit of
clean fun with the Brains Trust, or Father Ronald Knox exposing the
errors of Bertrand Russell. And the ease with which Swift has been
forgiven&mdash;and forgiven, sometimes, by devout
believers&mdash;for the blasphemies of A TALE OF A TUB demonstrates
clearly enough the feebleness of religious sentiments as compared
with political ones.</p>

<p>However, the reactionary cast of Swift's mind does not show
itself chiefly in his political affiliations. The important thing
is his attitude towards Science, and, more broadly, towards
intellectual curiosity. The famous Academy of Lagado, described in
Part III of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, is no doubt a justified satire on
most of the so-called scientists of Swift's own day. Significantly,
the people at work in it are described as "Projectors", that is,
people not engaged in disinterested research but merely on the
look-out for gadgets which will save labour and bring in money. But
there is no sign&mdash;indeed, all through the book there are many
signs to the contrary&mdash;that "pure" science would have struck
Swift as a worth-while activity. The more serious kind of scientist
has already had a kick in the pants in Part II, when the "Scholars"
patronized by the King of Brobdingnag try to account for Gulliver's
small stature:</p>

<p>After much Debate, they concluded unanimously that I was only
RELPLUM SCALCATH, which is interpreted literally, LUSUS NATURAE, a
Determination exactly agreeable to the modern philosophy of EUROPE,
whose Professors, disdaining the old Evasion of OCCULT CAUSES,
whereby the followers of ARISTOTLE endeavoured in vain to disguise
their Ignorance, have invented this wonderful solution of All
Difficulties, to the unspeakable Advancement of human
Knowledge.</p>

<p>If this stood by itself one might assume that Swift is merely
the enemy of SHAM science. In a number of places, however, he goes
out of his way to proclaim the uselessness of all learning or
speculation not directed towards some practical end:</p>

<p>The learning of (the Brobdingnaglans) is very defective,
consisting only in Morality, History, Poetry, and Mathematics,
wherein they must be allowed to excel. But, the last of these is
wholly applied to what may be useful in Life, to the improvement of
Agriculture, and all mechanical Arts so that among us it would be
little esteemed. And as to Ideas, Entities, Abstractions, and
Transcen-dentals, I could never drive the least Conception into
their Heads.</p>

<p>The Houyhnhnms, Swift's ideal beings, are backward even in a
mechanical sense. They are unacquainted with metals, have never
heard of boats, do not, properly speaking, practise agriculture (we
are told that the oats which they live upon "grow naturally"), and
appear not to have invented wheels. [Note, below] They have no
alphabet, and evidently have not much curiosity about the physical
world. They do not believe that any inhabited country exists beside
their own, and though they understand the motions of the sun and
moon, and the nature of eclipses, "this is the utmost progress of
their ASTRONOMY". By contrast, the philosophers of the flying
island of Laputa are so continuously absorbed in mathematical
speculations that before speaking to them one has to attract their
attention by napping them on the ear with a bladder. They have
catalogued ten thousand fixed stars, have settled the periods of
ninety-three comets, and have discovered, in advance of the
astronomers of Europe, that Mars has two moons&mdash;all of which
information Swift evidently regards as ridiculous, useless and
uninteresting. As one might expect, he believes that the
scientist's place, if he has a place, is in the laboratory, and
that scientific knowledge has no bearing on political matters:</p>

<p>[Note: Houyhnhnms too old to walk are described as being carried
on "sledges" or in "a kind of vehicle, drawn like a sledge".
Presumably these had no wheels. (Author's note.)]</p>

<p>What I...thought altogether unaccountable, was the strong
Disposition I observed in them towards News and Politics,
perpetually enquiring into Public Affairs, giving their judgements
in Matters of State, and passionately disputing every inch of a
Party Opinion. I have, indeed, observed the same Disposition among
most of the Mathematicians I have known in EUROPE, though I could
never discover the least Analogy between the two Sciences; unless
those people suppose, that, because the smallest Circle hath as
many Degrees as the largest, therefore the Regulation and
Management of the World require no more Abilities, than the
Handling and Turning of a Globe.</p>

<p>Is there not something familiar in that phrase "I could never
discover the least analogy between the two sciences"? It has
precisely the note of the popular Catholic apologists who profess
to be astonished when a scientist utters an opinion on such
questions as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul.
The scientist, we are told, is an expert only in one restricted
field: why should his opinions be of value in any other? The
implication is that theology is just as much an exact science as,
for instance, chemistry, and that the priest is also an expert
whose conclusions on certain subjects must be accepted. Swift in
effect makes the same claim for the politician, but he goes one
better in that he will not allow the scientist&mdash;either the
"pure" scientist or the ad hoc investigator&mdash;to be a useful
person in his own line. Even if he had not written Part III of
GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, one could infer from the rest of the book that,
like Tolstoy and like Blake, he hates the very idea of studying the
processes of Nature. The "Reason" which he so admires in the
Houyhnhnms does not primarily mean the power of drawing logical
inferences from observed facts. Although he never defines it, it
appears in most contexts to mean either common sense&mdash;i.e.
acceptance of the obvious and contempt for quibbles and
abstractions&mdash;or absence of passion and superstition. In
general he assumes that we know all that we need to know already,
and merely use our knowledge incorrectly. Medicine, for instance,
is a useless science, because if we lived in a more natural way,
there would be no diseases. Swift, however, is not a simple-lifer
or an admirer of the Noble Savage. He is in favour of civilization
and the arts of civilization. Not only does he see the value of
good manners, good conversation, and even learning of a literary
and historical kind, he also sees that agriculture, navigation and
architecture need to be studied and could with advantages be
improved. But his implied aim is a static, incurious
civilization&mdash;the world of his own day, a little cleaner, a
little saner, with no radical change and no poking into the
unknowable. More than one would expect in anyone so free from
accepted fallacies, he reveres the past, especially classical
antiquity, and believes that modern man has degenerated sharply
during the past hundred years. [Note, below] In the island of
sorcerers, where the spirits of the dead can be called up at
will:</p>

<p>[Note: The physical decadence which Swift claims to have
observed may have been a reality at that date. He attributes it to
syphilis, which was a new disease in Europe and may have been more
virulent than it is now. Distilled liquors, also, were a novelty in
the seventeenth century and must have led at first to a great
increase in drunkenness. (Author's footnote.)]</p>

<p>I desired that the Senate of ROME might appear before me in one
large chamber, and a modern Representative in Counterview, in
another. The first seemed to be an Assembly of Heroes and
Demy-Gods, the other a Knot of Pedlars, Pick-pockets, Highwaymen
and Bullies.</p>

<p>Although Swift uses this section of Part III to attack the
truthfulness of recorded history, his critical spirit deserts him
as soon as he is dealing with Greeks and Romans. He remarks, of
course, upon the corruption of imperial Rome, but he has an almost
unreasoning admiration for some of the leading figures of the
ancient world:</p>

<p>I was struck with profound Veneration at the sight of BRUTUS,
and could easily discover the most consummate Virtue, the greatest
Intrepidity and Firmness of Mind, the truest Love of his Country,
and general Benevolence for Mankind, in every Lineament of his
Countenance...I had the honour to have much Conversation with
BRUTUS, and was told, that his Ancestors JUNIUS, SOCRATES,
EPAMINONDAS, CATO the younger, SIR THOMAS MORE, and himself, were
perpetually together: a SEXTUMVIRATE, to which all the Ages of the
World cannot add a seventh.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that of these six people, only one is a
Christian. This is an important point. If one adds together Swift's
pessimism, his reverence for the past, his incuriosity and his
horror of the human body, one arrives at an attitude common among
religious reactionaries&mdash;that is, people who defend an unjust
order of Society by claiming that this world cannot be
substantially improved and only the "next world" matters. However,
Swift shows no sign of having any religious beliefs, at least in
any ordinary sense of the words. He does not appear to believe
seriously in life after death, and his idea of goodness is bound up
with republicanism, love of liberty, courage, "benevolence"
(meaning in effect public spirit), "reason" and other pagan
qualities. This reminds one that there is another strain in Swift,
not quite congruous with his disbelief in progress and his general
hatred of humanity.</p>

<p>To begin with, he has moments when he is "constructive" and even
"advanced". To be occasionally inconsistent is almost a mark of
vitality in Utopia books, and Swift sometimes inserts a word of
praise into a passage that ought to be purely satirical. Thus, his
ideas about the education of the young are fathered on to the
Lilliputians, who have much the same views on this subject as the
Houyhnhnms. The Lilliputians also have various social and legal
institutions (for instance, there are old age pensions, and people
are rewarded for keeping the law as well as punished for breaking
it) which Swift would have liked to see prevailing in his own
country. In the middle of this passage Swift remembers his
satirical intention and adds, "In relating these and the following
Laws, I would only be understood to mean the original Institutions,
and not the most scandalous Corruptions into which these people are
fallen by the degenerate Nature of Man" but as Lilliput is supposed
to represent England, and the laws he is speaking of have never had
their parallel in England, it is clear that the impulse to make
constructive suggestions has been too much for him. But Swift's
greatest contribution to political thought in the narrower sense of
the words, is his attack, especially in Part III, on what would now
be called totalitarianism. He has an extraordinarily clear
prevision of the spy-haunted "police State", with its endless
heresy-hunts and treason trials, all really designed to neutralize
popular discontent by changing it into war hysteria. And one must
remember that Swift is here inferring the whole from a quite small
part, for the feeble governments of his own day did not give him
illustrations ready-made. For example, there is the professor at
the School of Political Projectors who "shewed me a large Paper of
Instructions for discovering Plots and Conspiracies", and who
claimed that one can find people's secret thoughts by examining
their excrement:</p>

<p>Because Men are never so serious, thoughtful, and intent, as
when they are at Stool, which he found by frequent Experiment: for
in such Conjunctures, when he used meerly as a trial to consider
what was the best Way of murdering the King, his Ordure would have
a tincture of Green; but quite different when he thought only of
raising an Insurrection, or burning the Metropolis.</p>

<p>The professor and his theory are said to have been suggested to
Swift by the&mdash;from our point of view&mdash;not particularly
astonishing or disgusting fact that in a recent State trial some
letters found in somebody's privy had been put in evidence. Later
in the same chapter we seem to be positively in the middle of the
Russian purges:</p>

<p>In the Kingdom of Tribnia, by the Natives called Langdon...the
Bulk of the People consist, in a Manner, wholly of Discoverers,
Witnesses, Informers, Accusers, Prosecutors, Evidences,
Swearers...It is first agreed, and settled among them, what
suspected Persons shall be accused of a Plot: Then, effectual Care
is taken to secure all their Letters and Papers, and put the Owners
in Chains. These papers are delivered to a Sett of Artists, very
dexterous in finding out the mysterious Meanings of Words,
Syllables, and Letters...Where this method fails, they have two
others more effectual, which the Learned among them call ACROSTICS
and ANAGRAMS. FIRST, they can decypher all initial Letters into
political Meanings: Thus: N shall signify a Plot, B a Regiment of
Horse, L a Fleet at Sea: Or, SECONDLY, by transposing the Letters
of the Alphabet in any suspected Paper, they can lay open the
deepest Designs of a discontented Party. So, for Example if I
should say in a Letter to a Friend, OUR BROTHER TOM HAS JUST GOT
THE PILES, a skilful Decypherer would discover that the same
Letters, which compose that Sentence, may be analysed in the
following Words: RESIST&mdash;A PLOT IS BROUGHT HOME&mdash;THE TOUR
(Note: tower). And this is the anagrammatic method.</p>

<p>Other professors at the same school invent simplified languages,
write books by machinery, educate their pupils by inscribing the
lesson on a wafer and causing them to swallow it, or propose to
abolish individuality altogether by cutting off part of the brain
of one man and grafting it on to the head of another. There is
something queerly familiar in the atmosphere of these chapters,
because, mixed up with much fooling, there is a perception that one
of the aims of totalitarianism is not merely to make sure that
people will think the right thoughts, but actually to make them
LESS CONSCIOUS. Then, again, Swift's account of the Leader who is
usually to be found ruling over a tribe of Yahoos, and of the
"favourite" who acts first as a dirty-worker and later as a
scapegoat, fits remarkably well into the pattern of our own times.
But are we to infer from all this that Swift was first and foremost
an enemy of tyranny and a champion of the free intelligence? No:
his own views, so far as one can discern them, are not markedly
liberal. No doubt he hates lords, kings, bishops, generals, ladies
of fashion, orders, titles and flummery generally, but he does not
seem to o think better of the common people than of their rulers,
or to be in favour of increased social equality, or to be
enthusiastic about representative institutions. The Houyhnhnms are
organized upon a sort of caste system which is racial in character,
the horses which do the menial work being of different colours from
their masters and not interbreeding with them. The educational
system which Swift admires in the Lilliputians takes hereditary
class distinctions for granted, and the children of the poorest
classes do not go to school, because "their Business being only to
till and cultivate the Earth... therefore their Education is of
little Consequence to the Public". Nor does he seem to have been
strongly in favour of freedom of speech and the Press, in spite of
the toleration which his own writings enjoyed. The King of
Brobdingnag is astonished at the multiplicity of religious and
political sects in England, and considers that those who hold
"opinions prejudicial to the public" (in the context this seems to
mean simply heretical opinions), though they need not be obliged to
change them, ought to be obliged to conceal them: for "as it was
Tyranny in any Government to require the first, so it was weakness
not to enforce the second". There is a subtler indication of
Swift's own attitude in the manner in which Gulliver leaves the
land of the Houyhnhnms. Intermittently, at least. Swift was a kind
of anarchist, and Part IV of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a picture of an
anarchistic Society, not governed by law in the ordinary sense, but
by the dictates of "Reason", which are voluntarily accepted by
everyone. The General Assembly of the Houyhnhnms "exhorts"
Gulliver's master to get rid of him, and his neighbours put
pressure on him to make him comply. Two reasons are given. One is
that the presence of this unusual Yahoo may unsettle the rest of
the tribe, and the other is that a friendly relationship between a
Houyhnhnm and a Yahoo is "not agreeable to Reason or Nature, or a
Thing ever heard of before among them". Gulliver's master is
somewhat unwilling to obey, but the "exhortation" (a Houyhnhnm, we
are told, is never COMPELLED to do anything, he is merely
"exhorted" or "advised") cannot be disregarded. This illustrates
very well the totalitarian tendency which is explicit in the
anarchist or pacifist vision of Society. In a Society in which
there is no law, and in theory no compulsion, the only arbiter of
behaviour is public opinion. But public opinion, because of the
tremendous urge to conformity in gregarious animals, is less
tolerant than any system of law. When human beings are governed by
"thou shalt not", the individual can practise a certain amount of
eccentricity: when they are supposedly governed by "love" or
"reason", he is under continuous pressure to make him behave and
think in exactly the same way as everyone else. The Houyhnhnms, we
are told, were unanimous on almost all subjects. The only question
they ever DISCUSSED was how to deal with the Yahoos. Otherwise
there was no room for disagreement among them, because the truth is
always either self-evident, or else it is undiscoverable and
unimportant. They had apparently no word for "opinion" in their
language, and in their conversations there was no "difference of
sentiments". They had reached, in fact, the highest stage of
totalitarian organization, the stage when conformity has become so
general that there is no need for a police force. Swift approves of
this kind of thing because among his many gifts neither curiosity
nor good-nature was included. Disagreement would always seem to him
sheer perversity. "Reason," among the Houyhnhnms, he says, "is not
a Point Problematical, as with us, where men can argue with
Plausibility on both Sides of a Question; but strikes you with
immediate Conviction; as it must needs do, where it is not mingled,
obscured, or discoloured by Passion and Interest." In other words,
we know everything already, so why should dissident opinions be
tolerated? The totalitarian Society of the Houyhnhnms, where there
can be no freedom and no development, follows naturally from
this.</p>

<p>We are right to think of Swift as a rebel and iconoclast, but
except in certain secondary matters, such as his insistence that
women should receive the same education as men, he cannot be
labelled "Left". He is a Tory anarchist, despising authority while
disbelieving in liberty, and preserving the aristocratic outlook
while seeing clearly that the existing aristocracy is degenerate
and contemptible. When Swift utters one of his characteristic
diatribes against the rich and powerful, one must probably, as I
said earlier, write off something for the fact that he himself
belonged to the less successful party, and was personally
disappointed. The "outs", for obvious reasons, are always more
radical than the "ins". [Note, below] But the most essential thing
in Swift is his inability to believe that life&mdash;ordinary life
on the solid earth, and not some rationalized, deodorized version
of it&mdash;could be made worth living. Of course, no honest person
claims that happiness is NOW a normal condition among adult human
beings; but perhaps it COULD be made normal, and it is upon this
question that all serious political controversy really turns. Swift
has much in common&mdash;more, I believe, than has been
noticed&mdash;with Tolstoy, another disbeliever in the possibility
of happiness. In both men you have the same anarchistic outlook
covering an authoritarian cast of mind; in both a similar hostility
to Science, the same impatience with opponents, the same inability
to see the importance of any question not interesting to
themselves; and in both cases a sort of horror of the actual
process of life, though in Tolstoy's case it was arrived at later
and in a different way. The sexual unhappiness of the two men was
not of the same kind, but there was this in common, that in both of
them a sincere loathing was mixed up with a morbid fascination.
Tolstoy was a reformed rake who ended by preaching complete
celibacy, while continuing to practise the opposite into extreme
old age. Swift was presumably impotent, and had an exaggerated
horror of human dung: he also thought about it incessantly, as is
evident throughout his works. Such people are not likely to enjoy
even the small amount of happiness that falls to most human beings,
and, from obvious motives, are not likely to admit that earthly
life is capable of much improvement. Their incuriosity, and hence
their intolerance, spring from the same root.</p>

<p>[Note: At the end of the book, as typical specimens of human
folly and viciousness, Swift names "a Lawyer, a Pickpocket, a
Colonel, a Fool, a Lord, a Gamester, a Politician, a Whore-master,
a Physician, an Evidence, a Suborner, an Attorney, a Traitor, or
the like". One sees here the irresponsible violence of the
powerless. The list lumps together those who break the conventional
code, and those who keep it. For instance, if you automatically
condemn a colonel, as such, on what grounds do you condemn a
traitor? Or again, if you want to suppress pickpockets, you must
have laws, which means that you must have lawyers. But the whole
closing passage, in which the hatred is so authentic, and the
reason given for it so inadequate, is somehow unconvincing. One has
the feeling that personal animosity is at work. (Author's
footnote.)]</p>

<p>Swift's disgust, rancour and pessimism would make sense against
the background of a "next world" to which this one is the prelude.
As he does not appear to believe seriously in any such thing, it
becomes necessary to construct a paradise supposedly existing on
the surface of the earth, but something quite different from
anything we know, with all that he disapproves of&mdash;lies,
folly, change, enthusiasm, pleasure, love and dirt&mdash;eliminated
from it. As his ideal being he chooses the horse, an animal whose
excrement is not offensive. The Houyhnhnms are dreary
beasts&mdash;this is so generally admitted that the point is not
worth labouring. Swift's genius can make them credible, but there
can have been very few readers in whom they have excited any
feeling beyond dislike. And this is not from wounded vanity at
seeing animals preferred to men; for, of the two, the Houyhnhnms
are much liker to human beings than are the Yahoos, and Gulliver's
horror of the Yahoos, together with his recognition that they are
the same kind of creature as himself, contains a logical absurdity.
This horror comes upon him at his very first sight of them. "I
never beheld," he says, "in all my Travels, so disagreeable an
Animal, nor one against which I naturally conceived so strong an
Antipathy." But in comparison with what are the Yahoos disgusting?
Not with the Houyhnhnms, because at this time Gulliver has not seen
a Houyhnhnm. It can only be in comparison with himself, i.e. with a
human being. Later, however, we are to be told that the Yahoos ARE
human beings, and human society becomes insupportable to Gulliver
because all men are Yahoos. In that case why did he not conceive
his disgust of humanity earlier? In effect we are told that the
Yahoos are fantastically different from men, and yet are the same.
Swift has over-reached himself in his fury, and is shouting at his
fellow-creatures, "You are filthier than you are!" However, it is
impossible to feel much sympathy with the Yahoos, and it is not
because they oppress the Yahoos that the Houyhnhnms are
unattractive. They are unattractive because the "Reason" by which
they are governed is really a desire for death. They are exempt
from love, friendship, curiosity, fear, sorrow and&mdash;except in
their feelings towards the Yahoos, who occupy rather the same place
in their community as the Jews in Nazi Germany&mdash;anger and
hatred. "They have no Fondness for their Colts or Foles, but the
Care they take, in educating them, proceeds entirely from the
Dictates of REASON." They lay store by "Friendship" and
"Benevolence", but "these are not confined to particular Objects,
but universal to the whole Race". They also value conversation, but
in their conversations there are no differences of opinion, and
"nothing passed but what was useful, expressed in the fewest and
most significant Words". They practise strict birth control, each
couple producing two offspring and thereafter abstaining from
sexual intercourse. Their marriages are arranged for them by their
elders, on eugenic principles, and their language contains no word
for "love", in the sexual sense. When somebody dies they carry on
exactly as before, without feeling any grief. It will be seen that
their aim is to be as like a corpse as is possible while retaining
physical life. One or two of their characteristics, it is true, do
not seem to be strictly "reasonable" in their own usage of the
word. Thus, they place a great value not only on physical hardihood
but on athleticism, and they are devoted to poetry. But these
exceptions may be less arbitrary than they seem. Swift probably
emphasizes the physical strength of the Houyhnhnms in order to make
clear that they could never be conquered by the hated human race,
while a taste for poetry may figure among their qualities because
poetry appeared to Swift as the antithesis of Science, from his
point of view the most useless of all pursuits. In Part III he
names "Imagination, Fancy, and Invention" as desirable faculties in
which the Laputan mathematicians (in spite of their love of music)
were wholly lacking. One must remember that although Swift was an
admirable writer of comic verse, the kind of poetry he thought
valuable would probably be didactic poetry. The poetry of the
Houyhnhnms, he says:</p>

<p>must be allowed to excel (that of) all other Mortals; wherein
the Justness of their Similes, and the Minuteness, as well as
exactness, of their Descriptions, are, indeed, inimitable. Their
Verses abound very much in both of these; and usually contain
either some exalted Notions of Friendship and Benevolence, or the
Praises of those who were Victors in Races, and other bodily
Exercises.</p>

<p>Alas, not even the genius of Swift was equal to producing a
specimen by which we could judge the poetry of the Houyhnhnms. But
it sounds as though it were chilly stuff (in heroic couplets,
presumably), and not seriously in conflict with the principles of
"Reason".</p>

<p>Happiness is notoriously difficult to describe, and pictures of
a just and well-ordered Society are seldom either attractive or
convincing. Most creators of "favourable" Utopias, however, are
concerned to show what life could be like if it were lived more
fully. Swift advocates a simple refusal of life, justifying this by
the claim that "Reason" consists in thwarting your instincts. The
Houyhnhnms, creatures without a history, continue for generation
after generation to live prudently, maintaining their population at
exactly the same level, avoiding all passion, suffering from no
diseases, meeting death indifferently, training up their young in
the same principles&mdash;and all for what? In order that the same
process may continue indefinitely. The notions that life here and
now is worth living, or that it could be made worth living, or that
it must be sacrificed for some future good, are all absent. The
dreary world of the Houyhnhnms was about as good a Utopia as Swift
could construct, granting that he neither believed in a "next
world" nor could get any pleasure out of certain normal activities.
But it is not really set up as something desirable in itself, but
as the justification for another attack on humanity. The aim, as
usual, is to humiliate Man by reminding him that he is weak and
ridiculous, and above all that he stinks; and the ultimate motive,
probably, is a kind of envy, the envy of the ghost for the living,
of the man who knows he cannot be happy for the others who&mdash;so
he fears&mdash;may be a little happier than himself. The political
expression of such an outlook must be either reactionary or
nihilistic, because the person who holds it will want to prevent
Society from developing in some direction in which his pessimism
may be cheated. One can do this either by blowing everything to
pieces, or by averting social change. Swift ultimately blew
everything to pieces in the only way that was feasible before the
atomic bomb&mdash;that is, he went mad&mdash;but, as I have tried
to show, his political aims were on the whole reactionary ones.</p>

<p>From what I have written it may have seemed that I am AGAINST
Swift, and that my object is to refute him and even to belittle
him. In a political and moral sense I am against him, so far as I
understand him. Yet curiously enough he is one of the writers I
admire with least reserve, and GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, in particular,
is a book which it seems impossible for me to grow tired of. I read
it first when I was, eight&mdash;one day short of eight, to be
exact, for I stole and furtively read the copy which was to be
given me next day on my eighth birthday&mdash;and I have certainly
not read it less than half a dozen times since. Its fascination
seems inexhaustible. If I had to make a list of six books which
were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, I would
certainly put GULLIVER'S TRAVELS among them. This raises the
question: what is the relationship between agreement with a
writer's opinions, and enjoyment of his work?</p>

<p>If one is capable of intellectual detachment, one can PERCEIVE
merit in a writer whom one deeply disagrees with, but ENJOYMENT is
a different matter. Supposing that there is such a thing as good or
bad art, then the goodness or badness must reside in the work of
art itself&mdash;not independently of the observer, indeed, but
independently of the mood of the observer. In one sense, therefore,
it cannot be true that a poem is good on Monday and bad on Tuesday.
But if one judges the poem by the appreciation it arouses, then it
can certainly be true, because appreciation, or enjoyment, is a
subjective condition which cannot be commanded. For a great deal of
his waking life, even the most cultivated person has no aesthetic
feelings whatever, and the power to have aesthetic feelings is very
easily destroyed. When you are frightened, or hungry, or are
suffering from toothache or sea-sickness, KING LEAR is no better
from your point of view than PETER PAN. You may know in an
intellectual sense that it is better, but that is simply a fact
which you remember: you will not FEEL the merit of KING LEAR until
you are normal again. And aesthetic judgement can be upset just as
disastrously&mdash;more disastrously, because the cause is less
readily recognized&mdash;by political or moral disagreement. If a
book angers, wounds or alarms you, then you will not enjoy it,
whatever its merits may be. If it seems to you a really pernicious
book, likely to influence other people in some undesirable way,
then you will probably construct an aesthetic theory to show that
it HAS no merits. Current literary criticism consists quite largely
of this kind of dodging to and fro between two sets of standards.
And yet the opposite process can also happen: enjoyment can
overwhelm disapproval, even though one clearly recognizes that one
is enjoying something inimical. Swift, whose world-view is so
peculiarly unacceptable, but who is nevertheless an extremely
popular writer, is a good instance of this. Why is it that we don't
mind being called Yahoos, although firmly convinced that we are NOT
Yahoos?</p>

<p>It is not enough to make the usual answer that of course Swift
was wrong, in fact he was insane, but he was "a good writer". It is
true that the literary quality of a book is to some small extent
separable from its subject-matter. Some people have a native gift
for using words, as some people have a naturally "good eye" at
games. It is largely a question of timing and of instinctively
knowing how much emphasis to use. As an example near at hand, look
back at the passage I quoted earlier, starting "In the Kingdom of
Tribnia, by the Natives called Langdon". It derives much of its
force from the final sentence: "And this is the anagram-made
Method." Strictly speaking this sentence is unnecessary, for we
have already seen the anagram decyphered, but the mock-solemn
repetition, in which one seems to hear Swift's own voice uttering
the words, drives home the idiocy of the activities described, like
the final tap to a nail. But not all the power and simplicity of
Swift's prose, nor the imaginative effort that has been able to
make not one but a whole series of impossible worlds more credible
than the majority of history books&mdash;none of this would enable
us to enjoy Swift if his world-view were truly wounding or
shocking. Millions of people, in many countries, must have enjoyed
GULLIVER'S TRAVELS while more or less seeing its anti-human
implications: and even the child who accepts Parts i and ii as a
simple story gets a sense of absurdity from thinking of human
beings six inches high. The explanation must be that Swift's
world-view is felt to be NOT altogether false&mdash;or it would
probably be more accurate to say, not false all the time. Swift is
a diseased writer. He remains permanently in a depressed mood which
in most people is only intermittent, rather as though someone
suffering from jaundice or the after-effects of influenza should
have the energy to write books. But we all know that mood, and
something in us responds to the expression of it. Take, for
instance, one of his most characteristic works, The Lady's Dressing
Room: one might add the kindred poem, Upon a Beautiful Young Nymph
Going to Bed. Which is truer, the viewpoint expressed in these
poems, or the viewpoint implied in Blake's phrase, "The naked
female human form divine"? No doubt Blake is nearer the truth, and
yet who can fail to feel a sort of pleasure in seeing that fraud,
feminine delicacy, exploded for once? Swift falsifies his picture
of the world by refusing to see anything in human life except dirt,
folly and wickedness, but the part which he abstracts from the
whole does exist, and it is something which we all know about while
shrinking from mentioning it. Part of our minds&mdash;in any normal
person it is the dominant part&mdash;believes that man is a noble
animal and life is worth living: but there is also a sort of inner
self which at least intermittently stands aghast at the horror of
existence. In the queerest way, pleasure and disgust are linked
together. The human body is beautiful: it is also repulsive and
ridiculous, a fact which can be verified at any swimming pool. The
sexual organs are objects of desire and also of loathing, so much
so that in many languages, if not in all languages, their names are
used as words of abuse. Meat is delicious, but a butcher's shop
makes one feel sick: and indeed all our food springs ultimately
from dung and dead bodies, the two things which of all others seem
to us the most horrible. A child, when it is past the infantile
stage but still looking at the world with fresh eyes, is moved by
horror almost as often as by wonder&mdash;horror of snot and
spittle, of the dogs' excrement on the pavement, the dying toad
full of maggots, the sweaty smell of grown-ups, the hideousness of
old men, with their bald heads and bulbous noses. In his endless
harping on disease, dirt and deformity, Swift is not actually
inventing anything, he is merely leaving something out. Human
behaviour, too, especially in politics, is as he describes it,
although it contains other more important factors which he refuses
to admit. So far as we can see, both horror and pain are necessary
to the continuance of life on this planet, and it is therefore open
to pessimists like Swift to say: "If horror and pain must always be
with us, how can life be significantly improved?" His attitude is
in effect the Christian attitude, minus the bribe of a "next
world"&mdash;which, however, probably has less hold upon the minds
of believers than the conviction that this world is a vale of tears
and the grave is a place of rest. It is, I am certain, a wrong
attitude, and one which could have harmful effects upon behaviour;
but something in us responds to it, as it responds to the gloomy
words of the burial service and the sweetish smell of corpses in a
country church.</p>

<p>It is often argued, at least by people who admit the importance
of subject-matter, that a book cannot be "good" if it expresses a
palpably false view of life. We are told that in our own age, for
instance, any book that has genuine literary merit will also be
more or less "progressive" in tendency. This ignores the fact that
throughout history a similar struggle between progress and reaction
has been raging, and that the best books of any one age have always
been written from several different viewpoints, some of them
palpably more false than others. In so far as a writer is a
propagandist, the most one can ask of him is that he shall
genuinely believe in what he is saying, and that it shall not be
something blazingly silly. To-day, for example, one can imagine a
good book being written by a Catholic, a Communist, a Fascist,
pacifist, an anarchist, perhaps by an old-style Liberal or an
ordinary Conservative: one cannot imagine a good book being written
by a spiritualist, a Buchmanite or a member of the Ku-Klux-Klan.
The views that a writer holds must be compatible with sanity, in
the medical sense, and with the power of continuous thought: beyond
that what we ask of him is talent, which is probably another name
for conviction. Swift did not possess ordinary wisdom, but he did
possess a terrible intensity of vision, capable of picking out a
single hidden truth and then magnifying it and distorting it. The
durability of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS goes to show that, if the force of
belief is behind it, a world-view which only just passes the test
of sanity is sufficient to produce a great work of art.</p>

<h2>RIDING DOWN FROM BANGOR</h2>

<p>The reappearance of HELEN'S BABIES, in its day one of the most
popular books in the world&mdash;within the British Empire alone it
was pirated by twenty different publishing firms, the author
receiving a total profit of &pound;40 from a sale of some hundreds
of thousands or millions of copies&mdash;will ring a bell in any
literate person over thirty-five. Not that the present edition is
an altogether satisfactory one. It is a cheap little book with
rather unsuitable illustrations, various American dialect words
appear to have been cut out of it, and the sequel, OTHER PEOPLE'S
CHILDREN, which was often bound up with it in earlier editions, is
missing. Still, it is pleasant to see HELEN'S BABIES in print
again. It had become almost a rarity in recent years, and it is one
of the best of the little library of American books on which people
born at about the turn of the century were brought up.</p>

<p>The books one reads in childhood, and perhaps most of all the
bad and good bad books, create in one's mind a sort of false map of
the world, a series of fabulous countries into which one can
retreat at odd moments throughout the rest of life, and which in
some cases can even survive a visit to the real countries which
they are supposed to represent. The pampas, the Amazon, the coral
islands of the Pacific, Russia, land of birch-tree and samovar,
Transylvania with its boyars and vampires, the China of Guy
Boothby, the Paris of du Maurier&mdash;one could continue the list
for a long time. But one other imaginary country that I acquired
early in life was called America. If I pause on the word "America",
and, deliberately putting aside the existing reality, call up my
childhood vision of it, I see two pictures&mdash;composite
pictures, of course, from which I am omitting a good deal of the
detail.</p>

<p>One is of a boy sitting in a whitewashed stone schoolroom. He
wears braces and has patches on his shirt, and if it is summer he
is barefooted. In the corner of the school room there is a bucket
of drinking water with a dipper. The boy lives in a farm-house,
also of stone and also whitewashed, which has a mortgage on it. He
aspires to be President, and is expected to keep the woodpile full.
Somewhere in the background of the picture, but completely
dominating it, is a huge black Bible. The other picture is of a
tall, angular man, with a shapeless hat pulled down over his eyes,
leaning against a wooden paling and whittling at a stick. His lower
jaw moves slowly but ceaselessly. At very long intervals he emits
some piece of wisdom such as "A woman is the orneriest critter
there is, 'ceptin' a mule", or "When you don't know a thing to do,
don't do a thing"; but more often it is a jet of tobacco juice that
issues from the gap in his front teeth. Between them those two
pictures summed up my earliest impression of America. And of the
two, the first&mdash;which, I suppose, represented New England, the
other representing the South&mdash;had the stronger hold upon
me.</p>

<p>The books from which these pictures were derived included, of
course, books which it is still possible to take seriously, such as
<i>Tom Sawyer</i> and UNCLE TOM'S CABIN, but the most richly
American flavour was to be found in minor works which are now
almost forgotten. I wonder, for instance, if anyone still reads
REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM, which remained a popular favourite long
enough to be filmed with Mary Pickford in the leading part. Or how
about the "Katy" books by Susan Coolidge (WHAT KATY DID AT SCHOOL,
etc), which, although girls' books and therefore "soppy", had the
fascination of foreignness? Louisa M. Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN and
GOOD WIVES are, I suppose, still flickeringly in print, and
certainly they still have their devotees. As a child I loved both
of them, though I was less pleased by the third of the trilogy,
LITTLE MEN. That model school where the worst punishment was to
have to whack the schoolmaster, on "this hurts me more than it
hurts you" principles, was rather difficult to swallow.</p>

<p>HELEN'S BABIES belonged in much the same world as LITTLE WOMEN,
and must have been published round about the same date. Then there
were Artemus Ward, Bret Harte, and various songs, hymns and
ballads, besides poems dealing with the civil war, such as "Barbara
Fritchie" ("Shoot if you must this old grey head, But spare your
country's flag,' she said") and "Little Gifford of Tennessee".
There were other books so obscure that it hardly seems worth
mentioning them, and magazine stories of which I remember nothing
except that the old homestead always seemed to have a mortgage on
it. There was also BEAUTIFUL JOE, the American reply to BLACK
BEAUTY, of which you might just possibly pick up a copy in a
sixpenny box. All the books I have mentioned were written well
before 1900, but something of the special American flavour lingered
on into this century in, for instance, the Buster Brown coloured
supplements, and even in Booth Tarkington's "Penrod" stories, which
will have been written round about 1910. Perhaps there was even a
tinge of it in Ernest Thompson Seton's animal books (WILD ANIMALS I
HAVE KNOWN, etc), which have now fallen from favour but which drew
tears from the pre-1914 child as surely as MISUNDERSTOOD had done
from the children of a generation earlier.</p>

<p>Somewhat later my picture of nineteenth-century America was
given greater precision by a song which is still fairly well known
and which can be found (I think) in the SCOTTISH STUDENTS' SONG
BOOK. As usual in these bookless days I cannot get hold of a copy,
and I must quote fragments from memory. It begins:</p>

<pre>
Riding down from Bangor
On an Eastern train,
Bronzed with weeks of hunting
In the woods of Maine
Quite extensive whiskers,
Beard, moustache as well
Sat a student fellow,
Tall and slim and swell.
</pre>

<p>Presently an aged couple and a "village maiden", described as
"beautiful, petite", get into the carriage. Quantities of cinders
are flying about, and before long the student fellow gets one in
his eye: the village maiden extracts it for him, to the scandal of
the aged couple. Soon after this the train shoots into a long
tunnel, "black as Egypt's night". When it emerges into the daylight
again the maiden is covered with blushes, and the cause of her
confusion is revealed when:</p>

<pre>
There suddenly appeared
A tiny little ear-ring
In that horrid student's beard!
</pre>

<p>I do not know the date of the song, but the primitiveness of the
train (no lights in the carriage, and a cinder in one's eye a
normal accident) suggests that it belongs well back in the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>What connects this song with books like HELEN'S BABIES is first
of all a sort of sweet innocence&mdash;the climax, the thing you
are supposed to be slightly shocked at, is an episode with which
any modern piece of naughty-naughty would START&mdash;and,
secondly, a faint vulgarity of language mixed up with a certain
cultural pretentiousness. HELEN'S BABIES is intended as a humorous,
even a farcical book, but it is haunted all the way through by
words like "tasteful" and "ladylike", and it is funny chiefly
because its tiny disasters happen against a background of conscious
gentility. "Handsome, intelligent, composed, tastefully dressed,
without a suspicion of the flirt or the languid woman of fashion
about her, she awakened to the utmost my every admiring
sentiment"&mdash;thus is the heroine described, figuring elsewhere
as "erect, fresh, neat, composed, bright-eyed, fair-faced, smiling
and observant". One gets beautiful glimpses of a now-vanished world
in such remarks as: "I believe you arranged the floral decorations
at St Zephaniah's Fair last winter, Mr Burton? 'Twas the most
tasteful display of the season." But in spite of the occasional use
of "'twas" and other archaisms&mdash;"parlour" for sitting-room,
"chamber" for bedroom, "real" as an adverb, and so forth&mdash;the
book does not "date" very markedly, and many of its admirers
imagine it to have been written round about 1900. Actually it was
written in 1875, a fact which one might infer from internal
evidence, since the hero, aged twenty-eight, is a veteran of the
civil war.</p>

<p>The book is very short and the story is a simple one. A young
bachelor is prevailed on by his sister to look after her house and
her two sons, aged five and three, while she and her husband go on
a fortnight's holiday. The children drive him almost mad by an
endless succession of such acts as falling into ponds, swallowing
poison, throwing keys down wells, cutting themselves with razors,
and the like, but also facilitate his engagement to "a charming
girl, whom, for about a year, I had been adoring from afar". These
events take place in an outer suburb of New York, in a society
which now seems astonishingly sedate, formal, domesticated and,
according to current conceptions, un-American. Every action is
governed by etiquette. To pass a carriage full of ladies when your
hat is crooked is an ordeal; to recognise an acquaintance in church
is ill-bred; to become engaged after a ten days' courtship is a
severe social lapse. We are accustomed to thinking of American
society as more crude, adventurous and, in a cultural sense,
democratic than our own, and from writers like Mark Twain, Whitman
and Bret Harte, not to mention the cowboy and Red Indian stories of
the weekly papers, one draws a picture of a wild anarchic world
peopled by eccentrics and desperadoes who have no traditions and no
attachment to one place. That aspect of nineteenth-century America
did of course exist, but in the more populous eastern States a
society similar to Jane Austen's seems to have survived longer than
it did in England. And it is hard not to feel that it was a better
kind of society than that which arose from the sudden
industrialisation of the later part of the century. The people in
HELEN'S BABIES or LITTLE WOMEN may be mildly ridiculous, but they
are uncorrupted. They have something that is perhaps best described
as integrity, or good morale, founded partly on an unthinking
piety. It is a matter of course that everyone attends church on
Sunday morning and says grace before meals and prayers at bedtime:
to amuse the children one tells them Bible stories, and if they ask
for a song it is probably "Glory, glory Hallelujah". Perhaps it is
also a sign of spiritual health in the light literature of this
period that death is mentioned freely. "Baby Phil", the brother of
Budge and Toddie, has died shortly before HELEN'S BABIES opens, and
there are various tear-jerking references to his "tiny coffin". A
modern writer attempting a story of this kind would have kept
coffins out of it.</p>

<p>English children are still Americanised by way of the films, but
it would no longer be generally claimed that American books are the
best ones for children. Who, without misgivings, would bring up a
child on the coloured "comics" in which sinister professors
manufacture atomic bombs in underground laboratories while Superman
whizzes through the clouds, the machine-gun bullets bouncing off
his chest like peas, and platinum blondes are raped, or very
nearly, by steel robots and fifty-foot dinosaurs? It is a far cry
from Superman to the Bible and the woodpile. The earlier children's
books, or books readable by children, had not only innocence but a
sort of native gaiety, a buoyant, carefree feeling, which was the
product, presumably, of the unheard-of freedom and security which
nineteenth-century America enjoyed. That is the connecting link
between books so seemingly far apart as LITTLE WOMEN and LIFE ON
THE MISSISSIPPI. The society described in the one is subdued,
bookish and home-loving, while the other tells of a crazy world of
bandits, gold mines, duels, drunkenness and gambling hells: but in
both one can detect an underlying confidence in the future, a sense
of freedom and opportunity.</p>

<p>Nineteenth-century America was a rich, empty country which lay
outside the main stream of world events, and in which the twin
nightmares that beset nearly every modern man, the nightmare of
unemployment and the nightmare of State interference, had hardly
come into being. There were social distinctions, more marked than
those of today, and there was poverty (in LITTLE WOMEN, it will be
remembered, the family is at one time so hard up that one of the
girls sells her hair to the barber), but there was not, as there is
now, an all-prevailing sense of helplessness. There was room for
everybody, and if you worked hard you could be certain of a
living&mdash;could even be certain of growing rich: this was
generally believed, and for the greater part of the population it
was even broadly true. In other words, the civilisation of
nineteenth-century America was capitalist civilisation at its best.
Soon after the civil war the inevitable deterioration started. But
for some decades, at least, life in America was much better fun
than life in Europe&mdash;there was more happening, more colour,
more variety, more opportunity&mdash;and the books and songs of
that period had a sort of bloom, a childlike quality. Hence, I
think, the popularity of HELEN'S BABIES and other "light"
literature, which made it normal for the English child of thirty or
forty years ago to grow up with a theoretical knowledge of
raccoons, woodchucks, chipmunks, gophers, hickory trees,
water-melons and other unfamiliar fragments of the American
scene.</p>

<h2>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE COMMON TOAD</h2>

<p>Before the swallow, before the daffodil, and not much later than
the snowdrop, the common toad salutes the coming of spring after
his own fashion, which is to emerge from a hole in the ground,
where he has lain buried since the previous autumn, and crawl as
rapidly as possible towards the nearest suitable patch of water.
Something&mdash;some kind of shudder in the earth, or perhaps
merely a rise of a few degrees in the temperature&mdash;has told
him that it is time to wake up: though a few toads appear to sleep
the clock round and miss out a year from time to time&mdash;at any
rate, I have more than once dug them up, alive and apparently well,
in the middle of the summer.</p>

<p>At this period, after his long fast, the toad has a very
spiritual look, like a strict Anglo-Catholic towards the end of
Lent. His movements are languid but purposeful, his body is
shrunken, and by contrast his eyes look abnormally large. This
allows one to notice, what one might not at another time, that a
toad has about the most beautiful eye of any living creature. It is
like gold, or more exactly it is like the golden-coloured
semi-precious stone which one sometimes sees in signet-rings, and
which I think is called a chrysoberyl.</p>

<p>For a few days after getting into the water the toad
concentrates on building up his strength by eating small insects.
Presently he has swollen to his normal size again, and then he hoes
through a phase of intense sexiness. All he knows, at least if he
is a male toad, is that he wants to get his arms round something,
and if you offer him a stick, or even your finger, he will cling to
it with surprising strength and take a long time to discover that
it is not a female toad. Frequently one comes upon shapeless masses
of ten or twenty toads rolling over and over in the water, one
clinging to another without distinction of sex. By degrees,
however, they sort themselves out into couples, with the male duly
sitting on the female's back. You can now distinguish males from
females, because the male is smaller, darker and sits on top, with
his arms tightly clasped round the female's neck. After a day or
two the spawn is laid in long strings which wind themselves in and
out of the reeds and soon become invisible. A few more weeks, and
the water is alive with masses of tiny tadpoles which rapidly grow
larger, sprout hind-legs, then forelegs, then shed their tails: and
finally, about the middle of the summer, the new generation of
toads, smaller than one's thumb-nail but perfect in every
particular, crawl out of the water to begin the game anew.</p>

<p>I mention the spawning of the toads because it is one of the
phenomena of spring which most deeply appeal to me, and because the
toad, unlike the skylark and the primrose, has never had much of a
boost from poets. But I am aware that many people do not like
reptiles or amphibians, and I am not suggesting that in order to
enjoy the spring you have to take an interest in toads. There are
also the crocus, the missel-thrush, the cuckoo, the blackthorn,
etc. The point is that the pleasures of spring are available to
everybody, and cost nothing. Even in the most sordid street the
coming of spring will register itself by some sign or other, if it
is only a brighter blue between the chimney pots or the vivid green
of an elder sprouting on a blitzed site. Indeed it is remarkable
how Nature goes on existing unofficially, as it were, in the very
heart of London. I have seen a kestrel flying over the Deptford
gasworks, and I have heard a first-rate performance by a blackbird
in the Euston Road. There must be some hundreds of thousands, if
not millions, of birds living inside the four-mile radius, and it
is rather a pleasing thought that none of them pays a halfpenny of
rent.</p>

<p>As for spring, not even the narrow and gloomy streets round the
Bank of England are quite able to exclude it. It comes seeping in
everywhere, like one of those new poison gases which pass through
all filters. The spring is commonly referred to as "a miracle", and
during the past five or six years this worn-out figure of speech
has taken on a new lease of life. After the sorts of winters we
have had to endure recently, the spring does seem miraculous,
because it has become gradually harder and harder to believe that
it is actually going to happen. Every February since 1940 I have
found myself thinking that this time winter is going to be
permanent. But Persephone, like the toads, always rises from the
dead at about the same moment. Suddenly, towards the end of March,
the miracle happens and the decaying slum in which I live is
transfigured. Down in the square the sooty privets have turned
bright green, the leaves are thickening on the chestnut trees, the
daffodils are out, the wallflowers are budding, the policeman's
tunic looks positively a pleasant shade of blue, the fishmonger
greets his customers with a smile, and even the sparrows are quite
a different colour, having felt the balminess of the air and nerved
themselves to take a bath, their first since last September.</p>

<p>Is it wicked to take a pleasure in spring and other seasonal
changes? To put it more precisely, is it politically reprehensible,
while we are all groaning, or at any rate ought to be groaning,
under the shackles of the capitalist system, to point out that life
is frequently more worth living because of a blackbird's song, a
yellow elm tree in October, or some other natural phenomenon which
does not cost money and does not have what the editors of left-wing
newspapers call a class angle? There is not doubt that many people
think so. I know by experience that a favourable reference to
"Nature" in one of my articles is liable to bring me abusive
letters, and though the key-word in these letters is usually
"sentimental", two ideas seem to be mixed up in them. One is that
any pleasure in the actual process of life encourages a sort of
political quietism. People, so the thought runs, ought to be
discontented, and it is our job to multiply our wants and not
simply to increase our enjoyment of the things we have already. The
other idea is that this is the age of machines and that to dislike
the machine, or even to want to limit its domination, is
backward-looking, reactionary and slightly ridiculous. This is
often backed up by the statement that a love of Nature is a foible
of urbanized people who have no notion what Nature is really like.
Those who really have to deal with the soil, so it is argued, do
not love the soil, and do not take the faintest interest in birds
or flowers, except from a strictly utilitarian point of view. To
love the country one must live in the town, merely taking an
occasional week-end ramble at the warmer times of year.</p>

<p>This last idea is demonstrably false. Medieval literature, for
instance, including the popular ballads, is full of an almost
Georgian enthusiasm for Nature, and the art of agricultural peoples
such as the Chinese and Japanese centre always round trees, birds,
flowers, rivers, mountains. The other idea seems to me to be wrong
in a subtler way. Certainly we ought to be discontented, we ought
not simply to find out ways of making the best of a bad job, and
yet if we kill all pleasure in the actual process of life, what
sort of future are we preparing for ourselves? If a man cannot
enjoy the return of spring, why should he be happy in a
labour-saving Utopia? What will he do with the leisure that the
machine will give him? I have always suspected that if our economic
and political problems are ever really solved, life will become
simpler instead of more complex, and that the sort of pleasure one
gets from finding the first primrose will loom larger than the sort
of pleasure one gets from eating an ice to the tune of a Wurlitzer.
I think that by retaining one's childhood love of such things as
trees, fishes, butterflies and&mdash;to return to my first
instance&mdash;toads, one makes a peaceful and decent future a
little more probable, and that by preaching the doctrine that
nothing is to be admired except steel and concrete, one merely
makes it a little surer that human beings will have no outlet for
their surplus energy except in hatred and leader worship.</p>

<p>At any rate, spring is here, even in London N.1, and they can't
stop you enjoying it. This is a satisfying reflection. How many a
time have I stood watching the toads mating, or a pair of hares
having a boxing match in the young corn, and thought of all the
important persons who would stop me enjoying this if they could.
But luckily they can't. So long as you are not actually ill,
hungry, frightened or immured in a prison or a holiday camp, spring
is still spring. The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the
police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from
the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun, and
neither the dictators nor the bureaucrats, deeply as they
disapprove of the process, are able to prevent it.</p>

<h2>THE PREVENTION OF LITERATURE</h2>

<p>About a year ago I attended a meeting of the P.E.N. Club, the
occasion being the tercentenary of Milton's AEROPAGITICA&mdash;A
pamphlet, it may be remembered, in defense of freedom of the press.
Milton's famous phrase about the sin of "killing" a book was
printed on the leaflets advertising the meeting which had been
circulated beforehand.</p>

<p>There were four speakers on the platform. One of them delivered
a speech which did deal with the freedom of the press, but only in
relation to India; another said, hesitantly, and in very general
terms, that liberty was a good thing; a third delivered an attack
on the laws relating to obscenity in literature. The fourth devoted
most of his speech to a defense of the Russian purges. Of the
speeches from the body of the hall, some reverted to the question
of obscenity and the laws that deal with it, others were simply
eulogies of Soviet Russia. Moral liberty&mdash;the liberty to
discuss sex questions frankly in print&mdash;seemed to be generally
approved, but political liberty was not mentioned. Out of this
concourse of several hundred people, perhaps half of whom were
directly connected with the writing trade, there was not a single
one who could point out that freedom of the press, if it means
anything at all, means the freedom to criticize and oppose.
Significantly, no speaker quoted from the pamphlet which was
ostensibly being commemorated. Nor was there any mention of the
various books which have been "killed" in England and the United
States during the war. In its net effect the meeting was a
demonstration in favor of censorship. [Note: It is fair to say that
the P.E.N. club celebrations, which lasted a week or more, did not
always stick at quite the same level. I happened to strike a bad
day. But an examination of the speeches (printed under the title
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION) shows that almost nobody in our own day is
able to speak out as roundly in favour of intellectual liberty as
Milton could do 300 years ago&mdash;and this in spite of the fact
Milton was writing in a period of civil war. (Author's
footnote)]</p>

<p>There was nothing particularly surprising in this. In our age,
the idea of intellectual liberty is under attack from two
directions. On the one side are its theoretical enemies, the
apologists of totalitarianism, and on the other its immediate,
practical enemies, monopoly and bureaucracy. Any writer or
journalist who wants to retain his integrity finds himself thwarted
by the general drift of society rather than by active persecution.
The sort of things that are working against him are the
concentration of the press in the hands of a few rich men, the grip
of monopoly on radio and the films, the unwillingness of the public
to spend money on books, making it necessary for nearly every
writer to earn part of his living by hackwork, the encroachment of
official bodies like the M.O.I. [Ministry of Information] and the
British Council, which help the writer to keep alive but also waste
his time and dictate his opinions, and the continuous war
atmosphere of the past ten years, whose distorting effects no one
has been able to escape. Everything in our age conspires to turn
the writer, and every other kind of artist as well, into a minor
official, working on themes handed down from above and never
telling what seems to him the whole of the truth. But in struggling
against this fate he gets no help from his own side; that is, there
is no large body of opinion which will assure him that he's in the
right. In the past, at any rate throughout the Protestant
centuries, the idea of rebellion and the idea of intellectual
integrity were mixed up. A heretic&mdash;political, moral,
religious, or aesthetic&mdash;was one who refused to outrage his
own conscience. His outlook was summed up in the words of the
Revivalist hymn:</p>

<pre>
Dare to be a Daniel
Dare to stand alone
Dare to have a purpose firm
Dare to make it known
</pre>

<p>To bring this hymn up to date one would have to add a "Don't" at
the beginning of each line. For it is the peculiarity of our age
that the rebels against the existing order, at any rate the most
numerous and characteristic of them, are also rebelling against the
idea of individual integrity. "Daring to stand alone" is
ideologically criminal as well as practically dangerous. The
independence of the writer and the artist is eaten away by vague
economic forces, and at the same time it is undermined by those who
should be its defenders. It is with the second process that I am
concerned here.</p>

<p>Freedom of thought and of the press are usually attacked by
arguments which are not worth bothering about. Anyone who has
experience of lecturing and debating knows them off backwards. Here
I am not trying to deal with the familiar claim that freedom is an
illusion, or with the claim that there is more freedom in
totalitarian countries than in democratic ones, but with the much
more tenable and dangerous proposition that freedom is undesirable
and that intellectual honesty is a form of anti-social selfishness.
Although other aspects of the question are usually in the
foreground, the controversy over freedom of speech and of the press
is at bottom a controversy of the desirability, or otherwise, of
telling lies. What is really at issue is the right to report
contemporary events truthfully, or as truthfully as is consistent
with the ignorance, bias and self-deception from which every
observer necessarily suffers. In saying this I may seem to be
saying that straightforward "reportage" is the only branch of
literature that matters: but I will try to show later that at every
literary level, and probably in every one of the arts, the same
issue arises in more or less subtilized forms. Meanwhile, it is
necessary to strip away the irrelevancies in which this controversy
is usually wrapped up.</p>

<p>The enemies of intellectual liberty always try to present their
case as a plea for discipline versus individualism. The issue
truth-versus-untruth is as far as possible kept in the background.
Although the point of emphasis may vary, the writer who refuses to
sell his opinions is always branded as a mere egoist. He is
accused, that is, of either wanting to shut himself up in an ivory
tower, or of making an exhibitionist display of his own
personality, or of resisting the inevitable current of history in
an attempt to cling to unjustified privilege. The Catholic and the
Communist are alike in assuming that an opponent cannot be both
honest and intelligent. Each of them tacitly claims that "the
truth" has already been revealed, and that the heretic, if he is
not simply a fool, is secretly aware of "the truth" and merely
resists it out of selfish motives. In Communist literature the
attack on intellectual liberty is usually masked by oratory about
"petty-bourgeois individualism", "the illusions of
nineteenth-century liberalism", etc., and backed up by words of
abuse such as "romantic" and "sentimental", which, since they do
not have any agreed meaning, are difficult to answer. In this way
the controversy is maneuvered away from its real issue. One can
accept, and most enlightened people would accept, the Communist
thesis that pure freedom will only exist in a classless society,
and that one is most nearly free when one is working to bring such
a society about. But slipped in with this is the quite unfounded
claim that the Communist Party is itself aiming at the
establishment of the classless society, and that in the U.S.S.R.
this aim is actually on the way to being realized. If the first
claim is allowed to entail the second, there is almost no assault
on common sense and common decency that cannot be justified. But
meanwhile, the real point has been dodged. Freedom of the intellect
means the freedom to report what one has seen, heard, and felt, and
not to be obliged to fabricate imaginary facts and feelings. The
familiar tirades against "escapism" and "individualism",
"romanticism", and so forth, are merely a forensic device, the aim
of which is to make the perversion of history seem respectable.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago, when one defended the freedom of the
intellect, one had to defend it against Conservatives, against
Catholics, and to some extent&mdash;for they were not of great
importance in England&mdash;against Fascists. Today one has to
defend it against Communists and "fellow-travelers". One ought not
to exaggerate the direct influence of the small English Communist
Party, but there can be no question about the poisonous effect of
the Russian MYTHOS on English intellectual life. Because of it
known facts are suppressed and distorted to such an extent as to
make it doubtful whether a true history of our times can ever be
written. Let me give just one instance out of the hundreds that
could be cited. When Germany collapsed, it was found that very
large numbers of Soviet Russians&mdash;mostly, no doubt, from
non-political motives&mdash;had changed sides and were fighting for
the Germans. Also, a small but not negligible portion of the
Russian prisoners and displaced persons refused to go back to the
U.S.S.R., and some of them, at least, were repatriated against
their will. These facts, known to many journalists on the spot,
went almost unmentioned in the British press, while at the same
time Russophile publicists in England continued to justify the
purges and deportations of 1936-38 by claiming that the U.S.S.R.
"had no quislings". The fog of lies and misinformation that
surrounds such subjects as the Ukraine famine, the Spanish civil
war, Russian policy in Poland, and so forth, is not due entirely to
conscious dishonesty, but any writer or journalist who is fully
sympathetic for the U.S.S.R.&mdash;sympathetic, that is, in the way
the Russians themselves would want him to be&mdash;does have to
acquiesce in deliberate falsification on important issues. I have
before me what must be a very rare pamphlet, written by Maxim
Litvinoff in 1918 and outlining the recent events in the Russian
Revolution. It makes no mention of Stalin, but gives high praise to
Trotsky, and also to Zinoviev, Kamenev, and others. What could be
the attitude of even the most intellectually scrupulous Communist
towards such a pamphlet? At best, the obscurantist attitude of
saying that it is an undesirable document and better suppressed.
And if for some reason it were decided to issue a garbled version
of the pamphlet, denigrating Trotsky and inserting references to
Stalin, no Communist who remained faithful to his party could
protest. Forgeries almost as gross as this have been committed in
recent years. But the significant thing is not that they happen,
but that, even when they are known about, they provoke no reaction
from the left-wing intelligentsia as a whole. The argument that to
tell the truth would be "inopportune" or would "play into the hands
of" somebody or other is felt to be unanswerable, and few people
are bothered by the prospect of the lies which they condone getting
out of the newspapers and into the history books.</p>

<p>The organized lying practiced by totalitarian states is not, as
is sometimes claimed, a temporary expedient of the same nature as
military deception. It is something integral to totalitarianism,
something that would still continue even if concentration camps and
secret police forces had ceased to be necessary. Among intelligent
Communists there is an underground legend to the effect that
although the Russian government is obliged now to deal in lying
propaganda, frame-up trials, and so forth, it is secretly recording
the true facts and will publish them at some future time. We can, I
believe, be quite certain that this is not the case, because the
mentality implied by such an action is that of a liberal historian
who believes that the past cannot be altered and that a correct
knowledge of history is valuable as a matter of course. From the
totalitarian point of view history is something to be created
rather than learned. A totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy,
and its ruling caste, in order to keep its position, has to be
thought of as infallible. But since, in practice, no one is
infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in
order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this
or that imaginary triumph actually happened. Then again, every
major change in policy demands a corresponding change of doctrine
and a revelation of prominent historical figures. This kind of
thing happens everywhere, but is clearly likelier to lead to
outright falsification in societies where only one opinion is
permissible at any given moment. Totalitarianism demands, in fact,
the continuous alteration of the past, and in the long run probably
demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truth. The
friends of totalitarianism in this country usually tend to argue
that since absolute truth is not attainable, a big lie is no worse
than a little lie. It is pointed out that all historical records
are biased and inaccurate, or on the other hand, that modern
physics has proven that what seems to us the real world is an
illusion, so that to believe in the evidence of one's senses is
simply vulgar philistinism. A totalitarian society which succeeded
in perpetuating itself would probably set up a schizophrenic system
of thought, in which the laws of common sense held good in everyday
life and in certain exact sciences, but could be disregarded by the
politician, the historian, and the sociologist. Already there are
countless people who would think it scandalous to falsify a
scientific textbook, but would see nothing wrong in falsifying an
historical fact. It is at the point where literature and politics
cross that totalitarianism exerts its greatest pressure on the
intellectual. The exact sciences are not, at this date, menaced to
anything like the same extent. This partly accounts for the fact
that in all countries it is easier for the scientists than for the
writers to line up behind their respective governments.</p>

<p>To keep the matter in perspective, let me repeat what I said at
the beginning of this essay: that in England the immediate enemies
of truthfulness, and hence of freedom of thought, are the press
lords, the film magnates, and the bureaucrats, but that on a long
view the weakening of the desire for liberty among the
intellectuals themselves is the most serious symptom of all. It may
seem that all this time I have been talking about the effects of
censorship, not on literature as a whole, but merely on one
department of political journalism. Granted that Soviet Russia
constitutes a sort of forbidden area in the British press, granted
that issues like Poland, the Spanish civil war, the Russo-German
pact, and so forth, are debarred from serious discussion, and that
if you possess information that conflicts with the prevailing
orthodoxy you are expected to either distort it or keep quiet about
it&mdash;granted all this, why should literature in the wider sense
be affected? Is every writer a politician, and is every book
necessarily a work of straightforward "reportage"? Even under the
tightest dictatorship, cannot the individual writer remain free
inside his own mind and distill or disguise his unorthodox ideas in
such a way that the authorities will be too stupid to recognize
them? And in any case, if the writer himself is in agreement with
the prevailing orthodoxy, why should it have a cramping effect on
him? Is not literature, or any of the arts, likeliest to flourish
in societies in which there are no major conflicts of opinion and
no sharp distinction between the artist and his audience? Does one
have to assume that every writer is a rebel, or even that a writer
as such is an exceptional person?</p>

<p>Whenever one attempts to defend intellectual liberty against the
claims of totalitarianism, one meets with these arguments in one
form or another. They are based on a complete misunderstanding of
what literature is, and how&mdash;one should perhaps say
why&mdash;it comes into being. They assume that a writer is either
a mere entertainer or else a venal hack who can switch from one
line of propaganda to another as easily as an organ grinder
changing tunes. But after all, how is it that books ever come to be
written? Above a quite low level, literature is an attempt to
influence the viewpoint of one's contemporaries by recording
experience. And so far as freedom of expression is concerned, there
is not much difference between a mere journalist and the most
"unpolitical" imaginative writer. The journalist is unfree, and is
conscious of unfreedom, when he is forced to write lies or suppress
what seems to him important news; the imaginative writer is unfree
when he has to falsify his subjective feelings, which from his
point of view are facts. He may distort and caricature reality in
order to make his meaning clearer, but he cannot misrepresent the
scenery of his own mind; he cannot say with any conviction that he
likes what he dislikes, or believes what he disbelieves. If he is
forced to do so, the only result is that his creative faculties
will dry up. Nor can he solve the problem by keeping away from
controversial topics. There is no such thing as a genuinely
non-political literature, and least of all in an age like our own,
when fears, hatreds, and loyalties of a directly political kind are
near to the surface of everyone's consciousness. Even a single
taboo can have an all-round crippling effect upon the mind, because
there is always the danger that any thought which is freely
followed up may lead to the forbidden thought. It follows that the
atmosphere of totalitarianism is deadly to any kind of prose
writer, though a poet, at any rate a lyric poet, might possibly
find it breathable. And in any totalitarian society that survives
for more than a couple of generations, it is probable that prose
literature, of the kind that has existed during the past four
hundred years, must actually come to an end.</p>

<p>Literature has sometimes flourished under despotic regimes, but,
as has often been pointed out, the despotisms of the past were not
totalitarian. Their repressive apparatus was always inefficient,
their ruling classes were usually either corrupt or apathetic or
half-liberal in outlook, and the prevailing religious doctrines
usually worked against perfectionism and the notion of human
infallibility. Even so it is broadly true that prose literature has
reached its highest levels in periods of democracy and free
speculation. What is new in totalitarianism is that its doctrines
are not only unchallengeable but also unstable. They have to be
accepted on pain of damnation, but on the other hand, they are
always liable to be altered on a moment's notice. Consider, for
example, the various attitudes, completely incompatible with one
another, which an English Communist or "fellow-traveler" has had to
adopt toward the war between Britain and Germany. For years before
September, 1939, he was expected to be in a continuous stew about
"the horrors of Nazism" and to twist everything he wrote into a
denunciation of Hitler: after September, 1939, for twenty months,
he had to believe that Germany was more sinned against than
sinning, and the word "Nazi", at least as far as print went, had to
drop right out of his vocabulary. Immediately after hearing the 8
o'clock news bulletin on the morning of June 22, 1941, he had to
start believing once again that Nazism was the most hideous evil
the world had ever seen. Now, it is easy for the politician to make
such changes: for a writer the case is somewhat different. If he is
to switch his allegiance at exactly the right moment, he must
either tell lies about his subjective feelings, or else suppress
them altogether. In either case he has destroyed his dynamo. Not
only will ideas refuse to come to him, but the very words he uses
will seem to stiffen under his touch. Political writing in our time
consists almost entirely of prefabricated phrases bolted together
like the pieces of a child's Meccano set. It is the unavoidable
result of self-censorship. To write in plain, vigorous language one
has to think fearlessly, and if one thinks fearlessly one cannot be
politically orthodox. It might be otherwise in an "age of faith",
when the prevailing orthodoxy has long been established and is not
taken too seriously. In that case it would be possible, or might be
possible, for large areas of one's mind to remain unaffected by
what one officially believed. Even so, it is worth noticing that
prose literature almost disappeared during the only age of faith
that Europe has ever enjoyed. Throughout the whole of the Middle
Ages there was almost no imaginative prose literature and very
little in the way of historical writing; and the intellectual
leaders of society expressed their most serious thoughts in a dead
language which barley altered during a thousand years.</p>

<p>Totalitarianism, however, does not so much promise an age of
faith as an age of schizophrenia. A society becomes totalitarian
when its structure becomes flagrantly artificial: that is, when its
ruling class has lost its function but succeeds in clinging to
power by force or fraud. Such a society, no matter how long it
persists, can never afford to become either tolerant or
intellectually stable. It can never permit either the truthful
recording of facts or the emotional sincerity that literary
creation demands. But to be corrupted by totalitarianism one does
not have to live in a totalitarian country. The mere prevalence of
certain ideas can spread a kind of poison that makes one subject
after another impossible for literary purposes. Wherever there is
an enforced orthodoxy&mdash;or even two orthodoxies, as often
happens&mdash;good writing stops. This was well illustrated by the
Spanish civil war. To many English intellectuals the war was a
deeply moving experience, but not an experience about which they
could write sincerely. There were only two things that you were
allowed to say, and both of them were palpable lies: as a result,
the war produced acres of print but almost nothing worth
reading.</p>

<p>It is not certain whether the effects of totalitarianism upon
verse need be so deadly as its effects on prose. There is a whole
series of converging reasons why it is somewhat easier for a poet
than a prose writer to feel at home in an authoritarian society. To
begin with, bureaucrats and other "practical" men usually despise
the poet too deeply to be much interested in what he is saying.
Secondly, what the poet is saying&mdash;that is, what his poem
"means" if translated into prose&mdash;is relatively unimportant,
even to himself. The thought contained in a poem is always simple,
and is no more the primary purpose of the poem than the anecdote is
the primary purpose of the picture. A poem is an arrangement of
sounds and associations, as a painting is an arrangement of
brushmarks. For short snatches, indeed, as in the refrain of a
song, poetry can even dispense with meaning altogether. It is
therefore fairly easy for a poet to keep away from dangerous
subjects and avoid uttering heresies; and even when he does utter
them, they may escape notice. But above all, good verse, unlike
good prose, is not necessarily and individual product. Certain
kinds of poems, such as ballads, or, on the other hand, very
artificial verse forms, can be composed co-operatively by groups of
people. Whether the ancient English and Scottish ballads were
originally produced by individuals, or by the people at large, is
disputed; but at any rate they are non-individual in the sense that
they constantly change in passing from mouth to mouth. Even in
print no two versions of a ballad are ever quite the same. Many
primitive peoples compose verse communally. Someone begins to
improvise, probably accompanying himself on a musical instrument,
somebody else chips in with a line or a rhyme when the first singer
breaks down, and so the process continues until there exists a
whole song or ballad which has no identifiable author.</p>

<p>In prose, this kind of intimate collaboration is quite
impossible. Serious prose, in any case, has to be composed in
solitude, whereas the excitement of being part of a group is
actually an aid to certain kinds of versification. Verse&mdash;and
perhaps good verse of its own kind, though it would not be the
highest kind&mdash;might survive under even the most inquisitorial
régime. Even in a society where liberty and individuality had been
extinguished, there would still be a need either for patriotic
songs and heroic ballads celebrating victories, or for elaborate
exercises in flattery; and these are the kinds of poems that can be
written to order, or composed communally, without necessarily
lacking artistic value. Prose is a different matter, since the
prose writer cannot narrow the range of his thoughts without
killing his inventiveness. But the history of totalitarian
societies, or of groups of people who have adopted the totalitarian
outlook, suggests that loss of liberty is inimical to all forms of
literature. German literature almost disappeared during the Hitler
régime, and the case was not much better in Italy. Russian
literature, so far as one can judge by translations, has
deteriorated markedly since the early days of the revolution,
though some of the verse appears to be better than the prose. Few
if any Russian novels that it is possible to take seriously have
been translated for about fifteen years. In western Europe and
America large sections of the literary intelligentsia have either
passed through the Communist Party or have been warmly sympathetic
to it, but this whole leftward movement has produced
extraordinarily few books worth reading. Orthodox Catholicism,
again, seems to have a crushing effect upon certain literary forms,
especially the novel. During a period of three hundred years, how
many people have been at once good novelists and good Catholics?
The fact is that certain themes cannot be celebrated in words, and
tyranny is one of them. No one ever wrote a good book in praise of
the Inquisition. Poetry might survive in a totalitarian age, and
certain arts or half-arts, such as architecture, might even find
tyranny beneficial, but the prose writer would have no choice
between silence or death. Prose literature as we know it is the
product of rationalism, of the Protestant centuries, of the
autonomous individual. And the destruction of intellectual liberty
cripples the journalist, the sociological writer, the historian,
the novelist, the critic, and the poet, in that order. In the
future it is possible that a new kind of literature, not involving
individual feeling or truthful observation, may arise, but no such
thing is at present imaginable. It seems much likelier that if the
liberal culture that we have lived in since the Renaissance comes
to an end, the literary art will perish with it.</p>

<p>Of course, print will continue to be used, and it is interesting
to speculate what kinds of reading matter would survive in a
rigidly totalitarian society. Newspapers will presumably continue
until television technique reaches a higher level, but apart from
newspapers it is doubtful even now whether the great mass of people
in the industrialized countries feel the need for any kind of
literature. They are unwilling, at any rate, to spend anywhere near
as much on reading matter as they spend on several other
recreations. Probably novels and stories will be completely
superseded by film and radio productions. Or perhaps some kind of
low grade sensational fiction will survive, produced by a sort of
conveyor-belt process that reduces human initiative to the
minimum.</p>

<p>It would probably not be beyond human ingenuity to write books
by machinery. But a sort of mechanizing process can already be seen
at work in the film and radio, in publicity and propaganda, and in
the lower reaches of journalism. The Disney films, for instance,
are produced by what is essentially a factory process, the work
being done partly mechanically and partly by teams of artists who
have to subordinate their individual style. Radio features are
commonly written by tired hacks to whom the subject and the manner
of treatment are dictated beforehand: even so, what they write is
merely a kind of raw material to be chopped into shape by producers
and censors. So also with the innumerable books and pamphlets
commissioned by government departments. Even more machine-like is
the production of short stories, serials, and poems for the very
cheap magazines. Papers such as the WRITER abound with
advertisements of literary schools, all of them offering you
ready-made plots at a few shillings a time. Some, together with the
plot, supply the opening and closing sentences of each chapter.
Others furnish you with a sort of algebraical formula by the use of
which you can construct plots for yourself. Others have packs of
cards marked with characters and situations, which have only to be
shuffled and dealt in order to produce ingenious stories
automatically. It is probably in some such way that the literature
of a totalitarian society would be produced, if literature were
still felt to be necessary. Imagination&mdash;even consciousness,
so far as possible&mdash;would be eliminated from the process of
writing. Books would be planned in their broad lines by
bureaucrats, and would pass through so many hands that when
finished they would be no more an individual product than a Ford
car at the end of the assembly line. It goes without saying that
anything so produced would be rubbish; but anything that was not
rubbish would endanger the structure of the state. As for the
surviving literature of the past, it would have to be suppressed or
at least elaborately rewritten.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, totalitarianism has not fully triumphed anywhere. Our
own society is still, broadly speaking, liberal. To exercise your
right of free speech you have to fight against economic pressure
and against strong sections of public opinion, but not, as yet,
against a secret police force. You can say or print almost anything
so long as you are willing to do it in a hole-and-corner way. But
what is sinister, as I said at the beginning of this essay, is that
the conscious enemies of liberty are those to whom liberty ought to
mean most. The big public do not care about the matter one way or
the other. They are not in favour of persecuting the heretic, and
they will not exert themselves to defend him. They are at once too
sane and too stupid to acquire the totalitarian outlook. The
direct, conscious attack on intellectual decency comes from the
intellectuals themselves.</p>

<p>It is possible that the Russophile intelligentsia, if they had
not succumbed to that particular myth, would have succumbed to
another of much the same kind. But at any rate the Russian myth is
there, and the corruption it causes stinks. When one sees highly
educated men looking on indifferently at oppression and
persecution, one wonders which to despise more, their cynicism or
their shortsightedness. Many scientists, for example, are the
uncritical admirers of the U.S.S.R. They appear to think that the
destruction of liberty is of no importance so long as their own
line of work is for the moment unaffected. The U.S.S.R. is a large,
rapidly developing country which has an acute need of scientific
workers and, consequently, treats them generously. Provided that
they steer clear of dangerous subjects such as psychology,
scientists are privileged persons. Writers, on the other hand, are
viciously persecuted. It is true that literary prostitutes like
Ilya Ehrenburg or Alexei Tolstoy are paid huge sums of money, but
the only thing which is of any value to the writer as
such&mdash;his freedom of expression&mdash;is taken away from him.
Some, at least, of the English scientists who speak so
enthusiastically of the opportunities to be enjoyed by scientists
in Russia are capable of understanding this. But their reflection
appears to be: "Writers are persecuted in Russia. So what? I am not
a writer." They do not see that any attack on intellectual liberty,
and on the concept of objective truth, threatens in the long run
every department of thought.</p>

<p>For the moment the totalitarian state tolerates the scientist
because it needs him. Even in Nazi Germany, scientists, other than
Jews, were relatively well treated and the German scientific
community, as a whole, offered no resistance to Hitler. At this
stage of history, even the most autocratic ruler is forced to take
account of physical reality, partly because of the lingering-on of
liberal habits of thought, partly because of the need to prepare
for war. So long as physical reality cannot altogether be ignored,
so long as two and two have to make four when you are, for example,
drawing the blueprint of an aeroplane, the scientist has his
function, and can even be allowed a measure of liberty. His
awakening will come later, when the totalitarian state is firmly
established. Meanwhile, if he wants to safeguard the integrity of
science, it is his job to develop some kind of solidarity with his
literary colleagues and not disregard it as a matter of
indifference when writers are silenced or driven to suicide, and
newspapers systematically falsified.</p>

<p>But however it may be with the physical sciences, or with music,
painting and architecture, it is&mdash;as I have tried to
show&mdash;certain that literature is doomed if liberty of thought
perishes. Not only is it doomed in any country which retains a
totalitarian structure; but any writer who adopts the totalitarian
outlook, who finds excuses for persecution and the falsification of
reality, thereby destroys himself as a writer. There is no way out
of this. No tirades against "individualism" and the "ivory tower",
no pious platitudes to the effect that "true individuality is only
attained through identification with the community", can get over
the fact that a bought mind is a spoiled mind. Unless spontaneity
enters at some point or another, literary creation is impossible,
and language itself becomes something totally different from what
it is now, we may learn to separate literary creation from
intellectual honesty. At present we know only that the imagination,
like certain wild animals, will not breed in captivity. Any writer
or journalist who denies that fact&mdash;and nearly all the current
praise of the Soviet Union contains or implies such a
denial&mdash;is, in effect, demanding his own destruction.</p>

<h2>WHY I WRITE (1946)</h2>

<p>From a very early age, perhaps the age of five or six, I knew
that when I grew up I should be a writer. Between the ages of about
seventeen and twenty-four I tried to abandon this idea, but I did
so with the consciousness that I was outraging my true nature and
that sooner or later I should have to settle down and write
books.</p>

<p>I was the middle child of three, but there was a gap of five
years on either side, and I barely saw my father before I was
eight. For this and other reasons I was somewhat lonely, and I soon
developed disagreeable mannerisms which made me unpopular
throughout my schooldays. I had the lonely child's habit of making
up stories and holding conversations with imaginary persons, and I
think from the very start my literary ambitions were mixed up with
the feeling of being isolated and undervalued. I knew that I had a
facility with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts, and I
felt that this created a sort of private world in which I could get
my own back for my failure in everyday life. Nevertheless the
volume of serious&mdash;i.e. seriously intended&mdash;writing which
I produced all through my childhood and boyhood would not amount to
half a dozen pages. I wrote my first poem at the age of four or
five, my mother taking it down to dictation. I cannot remember
anything about it except that it was about a tiger and the tiger
had 'chair-like teeth'&mdash;a good enough phrase, but I fancy the
poem was a plagiarism of Blake's 'Tiger, Tiger'. At eleven, when
the war or 1914-18 broke out, I wrote a patriotic poem which was
printed in the local newspaper, as was another, two years later, on
the death of Kitchener. From time to time, when I was a bit older,
I wrote bad and usually unfinished 'nature poems' in the Georgian
style. I also attempted a short story which was a ghastly failure.
That was the total of the would-be serious work that I actually set
down on paper during all those years.</p>

<p>However, throughout this time I did in a sense engage in
literary activities. To begin with there was the made-to-order
stuff which I produced quickly, easily and without much pleasure to
myself. Apart from school work, I wrote VERS D'OCCASION, semi-comic
poems which I could turn out at what now seems to me astonishing
speed&mdash;at fourteen I wrote a whole rhyming play, in imitation
of Aristophanes, in about a week&mdash;and helped to edit a school
magazines, both printed and in manuscript. These magazines were the
most pitiful burlesque stuff that you could imagine, and I took far
less trouble with them than I now would with the cheapest
journalism. But side by side with all this, for fifteen years or
more, I was carrying out a literary exercise of a quite different
kind: this was the making up of a continuous 'story' about myself,
a sort of diary existing only in the mind. I believe this is a
common habit of children and adolescents. As a very small child I
used to imagine that I was, say, Robin Hood, and picture myself as
the hero of thrilling adventures, but quite soon my 'story' ceased
to be narcissistic in a crude way and became more and more a mere
description of what I was doing and the things I saw. For minutes
at a time this kind of thing would be running through my head: 'He
pushed the door open and entered the room. A yellow beam of
sunlight, filtering through the muslin curtains, slanted on to the
table, where a match-box, half-open, lay beside the inkpot. With
his right hand in his pocket he moved across to the window. Down in
the street a tortoiseshell cat was chasing a dead leaf', etc. etc.
This habit continued until I was about twenty-five, right through
my non-literary years. Although I had to search, and did search,
for the right words, I seemed to be making this descriptive effort
almost against my will, under a kind of compulsion from outside.
The 'story' must, I suppose, have reflected the styles of the
various writers I admired at different ages, but so far as I
remember it always had the same meticulous descriptive quality.</p>

<p>When I was about sixteen I suddenly discovered the joy of mere
words, i.e. the sounds and associations of words. The lines from
PARADISE LOST,</p>

<p>So hee with difficulty and labour hard<br>
Moved on: with difficulty and labour hee.</p>

<p>which do not now seem to me so very wonderful, sent shivers down
my backbone; and the spelling 'hee' for 'he' was an added pleasure.
As for the need to describe things, I knew all about it already. So
it is clear what kind of books I wanted to write, in so far as I
could be said to want to write books at that time. I wanted to
write enormous naturalistic novels with unhappy endings, full of
detailed descriptions and arresting similes, and also full of
purple passages in which words were used partly for the sake of
their own sound. And in fact my first completed novel, BURMESE
DAYS, which I wrote when I was thirty but projected much earlier,
is rather that kind of book.</p>

<p>I give all this background information because I do not think
one can assess a writer's motives without knowing something of his
early development. His subject matter will be determined by the age
he lives in&mdash;at least this is true in tumultuous,
revolutionary ages like our own&mdash;but before he ever begins to
write he will have acquired an emotional attitude from which he
will never completely escape. It is his job, no doubt, to
discipline his temperament and avoid getting stuck at some immature
stage, in some perverse mood; but if he escapes from his early
influences altogether, he will have killed his impulse to write.
Putting aside the need to earn a living, I think there are four
great motives for writing, at any rate for writing prose. They
exist in different degrees in every writer, and in any one writer
the proportions will vary from time to time, according to the
atmosphere in which he is living. They are:</p>

<p>(i) Sheer egoism. Desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to
be remembered after death, to get your own back on the grown-ups
who snubbed you in childhood, etc., etc. It is humbug to pretend
this is not a motive, and a strong one. Writers share this
characteristic with scientists, artists, politicians, lawyers,
soldiers, successful businessmen&mdash;in short, with the whole top
crust of humanity. The great mass of human beings are not acutely
selfish. After the age of about thirty they almost abandon the
sense of being individuals at all&mdash;and live chiefly for
others, or are simply smothered under drudgery. But there is also
the minority of gifted, willful people who are determined to live
their own lives to the end, and writers belong in this class.
Serious writers, I should say, are on the whole more vain and
self-centered than journalists, though less interested in
money.</p>

<p>(ii) Aesthetic enthusiasm. Perception of beauty in the external
world, or, on the other hand, in words and their right arrangement.
Pleasure in the impact of one sound on another, in the firmness of
good prose or the rhythm of a good story. Desire to share an
experience which one feels is valuable and ought not to be missed.
The aesthetic motive is very feeble in a lot of writers, but even a
pamphleteer or writer of textbooks will have pet words and phrases
which appeal to him for non-utilitarian reasons; or he may feel
strongly about typography, width of margins, etc. Above the level
of a railway guide, no book is quite free from aesthetic
considerations.</p>

<p>(iii) Historical impulse. Desire to see things as they are, to
find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity.</p>

<p>(iv) Political purpose.&mdash;Using the word 'political' in the
widest possible sense. Desire to push the world in a certain
direction, to alter other peoples' idea of the kind of society that
they should strive after. Once again, no book is genuinely free
from political bias. The opinion that art should have nothing to do
with politics is itself a political attitude.</p>

<p>It can be seen how these various impulses must war against one
another, and how they must fluctuate from person to person and from
time to time. By nature&mdash;taking your 'nature' to be the state
you have attained when you are first adult&mdash;I am a person in
whom the first three motives would outweigh the fourth. In a
peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive
books, and might have remained almost unaware of my political
loyalties. As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of
pamphleteer. First I spent five years in an unsuitable profession
(the Indian Imperial Police, in Burma), and then I underwent
poverty and the sense of failure. This increased my natural hatred
of authority and made me for the first time fully aware of the
existence of the working classes, and the job in Burma had given me
some understanding of the nature of imperialism: but these
experiences were not enough to give me an accurate political
orientation. Then came Hitler, the Spanish Civil War, etc. By the
end of 1935 I had still failed to reach a firm decision. I remember
a little poem that I wrote at that date, expressing my dilemma:</p>

<pre>
A happy vicar I might have been
Two hundred years ago
To preach upon eternal doom
And watch my walnuts grow;

But born, alas, in an evil time,
I missed that pleasant haven,
For the hair has grown on my upper lip
And the clergy are all clean-shaven.

And later still the times were good,
We were so easy to please,
We rocked our troubled thoughts to sleep
On the bosoms of the trees.

All ignorant we dared to own
The joys we now dissemble;
The greenfinch on the apple bough
Could make my enemies tremble.

But girl's bellies and apricots,
Roach in a shaded stream,
Horses, ducks in flight at dawn,
All these are a dream.

It is forbidden to dream again;
We maim our joys or hide them:
Horses are made of chromium steel
And little fat men shall ride them.

I am the worm who never turned,
The eunuch without a harem;
Between the priest and the commissar
I walk like Eugene Aram;

And the commissar is telling my fortune
While the radio plays,
But the priest has promised an Austin Seven,
For Duggie always pays.

I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls,
And woke to find it true;
I wasn't born for an age like this;
Was Smith? Was Jones? Were you?
</pre>

<p>The Spanish war and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and
thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I
have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly,
AGAINST totalitarianism and FOR democratic socialism, as I
understand it. It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own,
to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects. Everyone
writes of them in one guise or another. It is simply a question of
which side one takes and what approach one follows. And the more
one is conscious of one's political bias, the more chance one has
of acting politically without sacrificing one's aesthetic and
intellectual integrity.</p>

<p>What I have most wanted to do throughout the past ten years is
to make political writing into an art. My starting point is always
a feeling of partisanship, a sense of injustice. When I sit down to
write a book, I do not say to myself, 'I am going to produce a work
of art'. I write it because there is some lie that I want to
expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial
concern is to get a hearing. But I could not do the work of writing
a book, or even a long magazine article, if it were not also an
aesthetic experience. Anyone who cares to examine my work will see
that even when it is downright propaganda it contains much that a
full-time politician would consider irrelevant. I am not able, and
do not want, completely to abandon the world view that I acquired
in childhood. So long as I remain alive and well I shall continue
to feel strongly about prose style, to love the surface of the
earth, and to take a pleasure in solid objects and scraps of
useless information. It is no use trying to suppress that side of
myself. The job is to reconcile my ingrained likes and dislikes
with the essentially public, non-individual activities that this
age forces on all of us.</p>

<p>It is not easy. It raises problems of construction and of
language, and it raises in a new way the problem of truthfulness.
Let me give just one example of the cruder kind of difficulty that
arises. My book about the Spanish civil war, HOMAGE TO CATALONIA,
is of course a frankly political book, but in the main it is
written with a certain detachment and regard for form. I did try
very hard in it to tell the whole truth without violating my
literary instincts. But among other things it contains a long
chapter, full of newspaper quotations and the like, defending the
Trotskyists who were accused of plotting with Franco. Clearly such
a chapter, which after a year or two would lose its interest for
any ordinary reader, must ruin the book. A critic whom I respect
read me a lecture about it. 'Why did you put in all that stuff?' he
said. 'You've turned what might have been a good book into
journalism.' What he said was true, but I could not have done
otherwise. I happened to know, what very few people in England had
been allowed to know, that innocent men were being falsely accused.
If I had not been angry about that I should never have written the
book.</p>

<p>In one form or another this problem comes up again. The problem
of language is subtler and would take too long to discuss. I will
only say that of late years I have tried to write less
picturesquely and more exactly. In any case I find that by the time
you have perfected any style of writing, you have always outgrown
it. ANIMAL FARM was the first book in which I tried, with full
consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse political purpose and
artistic purpose into one whole. I have not written a novel for
seven years, but I hope to write another fairly soon. It is bound
to be a failure, every book is a failure, but I do know with some
clarity what kind of book I want to write.</p>

<p>Looking back through the last page or two, I see that I have
made it appear as though my motives in writing were wholly
public-spirited. I don't want to leave that as the final
impression. All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the
very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book
is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some
painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were
not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor
understand. For all one knows that demon is simply the same
instinct that makes a baby squall for attention. And yet it is also
true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly
struggles to efface one's own personality. Good prose is like a
windowpane. I cannot say with certainty which of my motives are the
strongest, but I know which of them deserve to be followed. And
looking back through my work, I see that it is invariably where I
lacked a POLITICAL purpose that I wrote lifeless books and was
betrayed into purple passages, sentences without meaning,
decorative adjectives and humbug generally.</p>

<h2>LEAR, TOLSTOY AND THE FOOL</h2>

<p>Tolstoy's pamphlets are the least-known part of his work, and
his attack on Shakespeare [Note, below] is not even an easy
document to get hold of, at any rate in an English translation.
Perhaps, therefore, it will be useful if I give a summary of the
pamphlet before trying to discuss it.</p>

<p>[Note: SHAKESPEARE AND THE DRAMA. Written about 1903 as an
introduction to another pamphlet, SHAKESPEARE AND THE WORKING
CLASSES, by Ernest Crosby. (Author's footnote)]</p>

<p>Tolstoy begins by saying that throughout life Shakespeare has
aroused in him "an irresistible repulsion and tedium". Conscious
that the opinion of the civilized world is against him, he has made
one attempt after another on Shakespeare's works, reading and
re-reading them in Russian, English and German; but "I invariably
underwent the same feelings; repulsion, weariness and
bewilderment". Now, at the age of seventy-five, he has once again
re-read the entire works of Shakespeare, including the historical
plays, and I have felt with an even greater force, the same
feelings&mdash;this time, however, not of bewilderment, but of
firm, indubitable conviction that the unquestionable glory of a
great genius which Shakespeare enjoys, and which compels writers of
our time to imitate him and readers and spectators to discover in
him non-existent merits&mdash;thereby distorting their aesthetic
and ethical understanding&mdash;is a great evil, as is every
untruth.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, Tolstoy adds, is not merely no genius, but is not
even "an average author", and in order to demonstrate this fact he
will examine KING LEAR, which, as he is able to show by quotations
from Hazlitt, Brandes and others, has been extravagantly praised
and can be taken as an example of Shakespeare's best work.</p>

<p>Tolstoy then makes a sort of exposition of the plot of KING
LEAR, finding it at every step to be stupid, verbose, unnatural,
unintelligible, bombastic, vulgar, tedious and full of incredible
events, "wild ravings", "mirthless jokes", anachronisms,
irrelevancies, obscenities, worn-out stage conventions and other
faults both moral and aesthetic. LEAR is, in any case, a plagiarism
of an earlier and much better play, KING LEIR, by an unknown
author, which Shakespeare stole and then ruined. It is worth
quoting a specimen paragraph to illustrate the manner in which
Tolstoy goes to work. Act III, Scene 2 (in which Lear, Kent and the
Fool are together in the storm) is summarized thus:</p>

<p>Lear walks about the heath and says word which are meant to
express his despair: he desires that the winds should blow so hard
that they (the winds) should crack their cheeks and that the rain
should flood everything, that lightning should singe his white
bead, and the thunder flatten the world and destroy all germs "that
make ungrateful man"! The fool keeps uttering still more senseless
words. Enter Kent: Lear says that for some reason during this storm
all criminals shall be found out and convicted. Kent, still
unrecognized by Lear, endeavours to persuade him to take refuge in
a hovel. At this point the fool utters a prophecy in no wise
related to the situation and they all depart.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's final verdict on LEAR is that no unhypnotized
observer, if such an observer existed, could read it to the end
with any feeling except "aversion and weariness". And exactly the
same is true of "all the other extolled dramas of Shakespeare, not
to mention the senseless dramatized tales, PERICLES, TWELFTH NIGHT,
THE TEMPEST, CYMBELINE, TROILUS AND CRESSIDA."</p>

<p>Having dealt with Lear Tolstoy draws up a more general
indictment against Shakespeare. He finds that Shakespeare has a
certain technical skill which is partly traceable to his having
been an actor, but otherwise no merits whatever. He has no power of
delineating character or of making words, and actions spring
naturally out of situations, Us language is uniformly exaggerated
and ridiculous, he constantly thrusts his own random thoughts into
the mouth of any character who happens to be handy, he displays a
"complete absence of aesthetic feeling", and his words "have
nothing whatever in common with art and poetry".</p>

<p>"Shakespeare might have been whatever you like," Tolstoy
concludes, "but he was not an artist." Moreover, his opinions are
not original or interesting, and his tendency is "of the lowest and
most immoral". Curiously enough, Tolstoy does not base this last
judgement on Shakespeare's own utterances, but on the statements of
two critics, Gervinus and Brandes. According to Gervinus (or at
any, rate Tolstoy's reading of Gervinus) "Shakespeare taught...THAT
ONE MAY BE TOO GOOD", while according to Brandes: "Shakespeare's
fundamental principle...is that THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS."
Tolstoy adds on his own account that Shakespeare was a jingo
patriot of the worst type, but apart from this he considers that
Gervinus and Brandes have given a true and adequate description of
Shakespeare's view of life.</p>

<p>Tolstoy then recapitulates in a few paragraphs the theory of art
which he had expressed at greater length elsewhere. Put still more
shortly, it amounts to a demand for dignity of subject matter,
sincerity, and good craftsmanships. A great work of art must deal
with some subject which is "important to the life of mankind", it
must express something which the author genuinely feels, and it
must use such technical methods as will produce the desired effect.
As Shakespeare is debased in outlook, slipshod in execution and
incapable of being sincere even for a moment, he obviously stands
condemned.</p>

<p>But here there arises a difficult question. If Shakespeare is
all that Tolstoy has shown him to be, how did he ever come to be so
generally admired? Evidently the answer can only lie in a sort of
mass hypnosis, or "epidemic suggestion". The whole civilized world
has somehow been deluded into thinking Shakespeare a good writer,
and even the plainest demonstration to the contrary makes no
impression, because one is not dealing with a reasoned opinion but
with something akin to religious faith. Throughout history, says
Tolstoy, there has been an endless series of these "epidemic
suggestions"&mdash;for example, the Crusades, the search for the
Philosopher's Stone, the craze for tulip growing which once swept
over Holland, and so on and so forth. As a contemporary instance he
cites, rather significantly, the Dreyfus case, over which the whole
world grew violently excited for no sufficient reason. There are
also sudden short-lived crazes for new political and philosophical
theories, or for this or that writer, artist or scientist&mdash;for
example, Darwin who (in 1903) is "beginning to be forgotten". And
in some cases a quite worthless popular idol may remain in favour
for centuries, for "it also happens that such crazes, having arisen
in consequence of special reasons accidentally favouring their
establishment correspond in such a degree to the views of life
spread in society, and especially in literary circles, that they
are maintained for a long time". Shakespeare's plays have continued
to be admired over a long period because "they corresponded to the
irreligious and unmoral frame of mind of the upper classes of his
time and ours".</p>

<p>As to the manner in which Shakespeare's fame STARTED, Tolstoy
explains it as having been "got up" by German professors towards
the end of the eighteenth century. His reputation "originated in
Germany, and thence was transferred to England". The Germans chose
to elevate Shakespeare because, at a time when there was no German
drama worth speaking about and French classical literature was
beginning to seem frigid and artificial, they were captivated by
Shakespeare's "clever development of scenes" and also found in him
a good expression of their own attitude towards life. Goethe
pronounced Shakespeare a great poet, whereupon all the other
critics flocked after him like a troop of parrots, and the general
infatuation has lasted ever since. The result has been a further
debasement of the drama&mdash;Tolstoy is careful to include his own
plays when condemning the contemporary stage&mdash;and a further
corruption of the prevailing moral outlook. It follows that "the
false glorification of Shakespeare" is an important evil which
Tolstoy feels it his duty to combat.</p>

<p>This, then, is the substance of Tolstoy's pamphlet. One's first
feeling is that in describing Shakespeare as a bad writer he is
saying something demonstrably untrue. But this is not the case. In
reality there is no kind of evidence or argument by which one can
show that Shakespeare, or any other writer, is "good". Nor is there
any way of definitely proving that&mdash;for instance&mdash;Warwick
Beeping is "bad". Ultimately there is no test of literary merit
except survival, which is itself an index to majority opinion.
Artistic theories such as Tolstoy's are quite worthless, because
they not only start out with arbitrary assumptions, but depend on
vague terms ("sincere", "important" and so forth) which can be
interpreted in any way one chooses. Properly speaking one cannot
ANSWER Tolstoy's attack. The interesting question is: why did he
make it? But it should be noticed in passing that he uses many weak
or dishonest arguments. Some of these are worth pointing out, not
because they invalidate his main charge but because they are, so to
speak, evidence of malice.</p>

<p>To begin with, his examination of KING LEAR is not "impartial",
as he twice claims. On the contrary, it is a prolonged exercise in
misrepresentation. It is obvious that when you are summarizing KING
LEAR for the benefit of someone who has not read it, you are not
really being impartial if you introduce an important speech (Lear's
speech when Cordelia is dead in his arms) in this manner: "Again
begin Lear's awful ravings, at which one feels ashamed, as at
unsuccessful jokes." And in a long series of instances Tolstoy
slightly alters or colours the passages he is criticizing, always
in such a way as to make the plot appear a little more complicated
and improbable, or the language a little more exaggerated. For
example, we are told that Lear "has no necessity or motive for his
abdication", although his reason for abdicating (that he is old and
wishes to retire from the cares of state) has been clearly
indicated in the first scene. It will be seen that even in the
passage which I quoted earlier, Tolstoy has wilfully misunderstood
one phrase and Slightly changed this meaning of another, making
nonsense of a remark which is reasonable enough in its context.
None of these misreadings is very gross in itself, but their
cumulative effect is to exaggerate the psychological incoherence of
the play. Again, Tolstoy is not able to explain why Shakespeare's
plays were still in print, and still on the stage, two hundred
years after his death (BEFORE the "epidemic suggestion" started,
that is); and his whole account of Shakespeare's rise to fame is
guesswork punctuated by outright misstatements. And again, various
of his accusations contradict one another: for example, Shakespeare
is a mere entertainer and "not in earnest", but on the other hand
he is constantly putting his own thoughts into the mouths of his
characters. On the whole it is difficult to feel that Tolstoy's
criticisms are uttered in good faith. In any case it is impossible
that he should fully have believed in his main
thesis&mdash;believed, that is to say, that for a century or more
the entire civilized world had been taken in by a huge and palpable
lie which he alone was able to see through. Certainly his dislike
of Shakespeare is real enough, but the reasons for it may be
different, or partly different, from what he avows; and therein
lies the interest of his pamphlet.</p>

<p>At this point one is obliged to start guessing. However, there
is one possible clue, or at least there is a question which may
point the way to a clue. It is: why did Tolstoy, with thirty or
more plays to choose from, pick out KING LEAR as his especial
target? True, LEAR is so well known and has been so much praised
that it could justly be taken as representative of Shakespeare's
best work; still, for the purpose of a hostile analysis Tolstoy
would probably choose the play he disliked most. Is it not possible
that he bore an especial enmity towards this particular play
because he was aware, consciously or unconsciously, of the
resemblance between Lear's story and his own? But it is better to
approach this clue from the opposite direction&mdash;that is, by
examining LEAR itself, and the qualities in it that Tolstoy fails
to mention.</p>

<p>One of the first things an English reader would notice in
Tolstoy's pamphlet is that it hardly deals with Shakespeare as a
poet. Shakespeare is treated as a dramatist, and in so far as his
popularity is not spurious, it is held to be due to tricks of
stagecraft which give good opportunities to clever actors. Now, so
far as the English-speaking countries go, this is not true; Several
of the plays which are most valued by lovers of Shakespeare (for
instance, TIMON OF ATHENS) are seldom or never acted, while some of
the most actable, such as A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, are the least
admired. Those who care most for Shakespeare value him in the first
place for his use of language, the "verbal music" which even
Bernard Shaw, another hostile critic, admits to be "irresistible".
Tolstoy ignores this, and does not seem to realize that a poem may
have a special value for those who speak the language in which it
was written. However, even if one puts oneself in Tolstoy's place
and tries to think of Shakespeare as a foreign poet it is still
clear that there is something that Tolstoy has left out. Poetry, it
seems, is NOT solely a matter of sound and association, and
valueless outside its own language-group: otherwise how is it that
some poems, including poems written in dead languages, succeed in
crossing frontiers? Clearly a lyric like "To-morrow is Saint
Valentine's Day" could not be satisfactorily translated, but in
Shakespeare's major work there is something describable as poetry
that can be separated from the words. Tolstoy is right in saying
that LEAR is not a very good play, as a play. It is too drawn-out
and has too many characters and sub-plots. One wicked daughter
would have been quite enough, and Edgar is a superfluous character:
indeed it would probably be a better play if Gloucester and both
his sons were eliminated. Nevertheless, something, a kind of
pattern, or perhaps only an atmosphere, survives the complications
and the LONGUEURS. LEAR can be imagined as a puppet show, a mime, a
ballet, a series of pictures. Part of its poetry, perhaps the most
essential part, is inherent in the story and is dependent neither
on any particular set of words, nor on flesh-and-blood
presentation.</p>

<p>Shut your eyes and think of KING LEAR, if possible without
calling to mind any of the dialogue. What do you see? Here at any
rate is what I see; a majestic old man in a long black robe, with
flowing white hair and beard, a figure out of Blake's drawings (but
also, curiously enough, rather like Tolstoy), wandering through a
storm and cursing the heavens, in company with a Fool and a
lunatic. Presently the scene shifts and the old man, still cursing,
still understanding nothing, is holding a dead girl in his arms
while the Fool dangles on a gallows somewhere in the background.
This is the bare skeleton of the play, and even here Tolstoy wants
to cut out most of what is essential. He objects to the storm, as
being unnecessary, to the Fool, who in his eyes is simply a tedious
nuisance and an excuse for making bad jokes, and to the death of
Cordelia, which, as he sees it, robs the play of its moral.
According to Tolstoy, the earlier play. KING LEIR, which
Shakespeare adapted terminates more naturally and more in
accordance with the moral demands of the spectator than does
Shakespeare's; namely, by the King of the Gauls conquering the
husbands of the elder sisters, and by Cordelia, instead of being
killed, restoring Leir to his former position.</p>

<p>In other words the tragedy ought to have been a comedy, or
perhaps a melodrama. It is doubtful whether the sense of tragedy is
compatible with belief in God: at any rate, it is not compatible
with disbelief in human dignity and with the kind of "moral demand"
which feels cheated when virtue fails to triumph. A tragic
situation exists precisely when virtue does NOT triumph but when it
is still felt that man is nobler than the forces which destroy him.
It is perhaps more significant that Tolstoy sees no justification
for the presence of the Fool. The Fool is integral to the play. He
acts not only as a sort of chorus, making the central situation
clearer by commenting on it more intelligently than the other
characters, but as a foil to Lear's frenzies. His jokes, riddles
and scraps of rhyme, and his endless digs at Lear's high-minded
folly, ranging from mere derision to a sort of melancholy poetry
("All thy other titles thou hast given away, that thou wast born
with"), are like a trickle of sanity running through the play, a
reminder that somewhere or other in spite of the injustices,
cruelties, intrigues, deceptions and misunderstandings that are
being enacted here, life is going on much as usual. In Tolstoy's
impatience with the Fool one gets a glimpse of his deeper quarrel
with Shakespeare. He objects, with some justification, to the
raggedness of Shakespeare's plays, the irrelevancies, the
incredible plots, the exaggerated language: but what at bottom he
probably most dislikes is a sort of exuberance, a tendency to
take&mdash;not so much a pleasure as simply an interest in the
actual process of life. It is a mistake to write Tolstoy off as a
moralist attacking an artist. He never said that art, as such, is
wicked or meaningless, nor did he even say that technical
virtuosity is unimportant. But his main aim, in his later years,
was to narrow the range of human consciousness. One's interests,
one's points of attachment to the physical world and the day-to-day
struggle, must be as few and not as many as possible. Literature
must consist of parables, stripped of detail and almost independent
of language. The parables&mdash;this is where Tolstoy differs from
the average vulgar puritan&mdash;must themselves be works of art,
but pleasure and curiosity must be excluded from them. Science,
also, must be divorced from curiosity. The business of science, he
says, is not to discover what happens but to teach men how they
ought to live. So also with history and politics. Many problems
(for example, the Dreyfus case) are simply not worth solving, and
he is willing to leave them as loose ends. Indeed his whole theory
of "crazes" or "epidemic suggestions", in which he lumps together
such things as the Crusades and the Dutch passion of tulip growing,
shows a willingness to regard many human activities as mere
ant-like rushings to and fro, inexplicable and uninteresting.
Clearly he could have no patience with a chaotic, detailed,
discursive writer like Shakespeare. His reaction is that of an
irritable old man who is being pestered by a noisy child. "Why do
you keep jumping up and down like that? Why can't you sit still
like I do?" In a way the old man is in the right, but the trouble
is that the child, has a feeling in its limbs which the old man has
lost. And if the old man knows of the existence of this feeling,
the effect is merely to increase his irritation: he would make
children senile, if he could. Tolstoy does not know, perhaps, just
WHAT he misses in Shakespeare, but he is aware that he misses
something, and he is determined that others shall be deprived of it
as well. By nature he was imperious as well as egotistical. Well
after he was grown up he would still occasionally strike his
servant in moments of anger, and somewhat later, according to his
English biographer, Derrick Leon, he felt "a frequent desire upon
the slenderest provocation to slap the faces of those with whom he
disagreed". One docs not necessarily get rid of that kind of
temperament by undergoing religious conversion, and indeed it is
obvious that the illusion of having been reborn may allow one's
native vices to flourish more freely than ever, though perhaps in
subtler forms. Tolstoy was capable of abjuring physical violence
and of seeing what this implies, but he was not capable of
tolerance or humility, and even if one knew nothing of his other
writings, one could deduce his tendency towards spiritual bullying
from this single pamphlet.</p>

<p>However, Tolstoy is not simply trying to rob others of a
pleasure he does not share. He is doing that, but his quarrel with
Shakespeare goes further. It is the quarrel between the religious
and the humanist attitudes towards life. Here one comes back to the
central theme of KING LEAR, which Tolstoy does not mention,
although he sets forth the plot in some detail.</p>

<p>Lear is one of the minority of Shakespeare's plays that are
unmistakably ABOUT something. As Tolstoy justly complains, much
rubbish has been written about Shakespeare as a philosopher, as a
psychologist, as a "great moral teacher", and what-not. Shakespeare
was not a systematic thinker, his most serious thoughts are uttered
irrelevantly or indirectly, and we do not know to what extent he
wrote with a "purpose" or even how much of the work attributed to
him was actually written by him. In the sonnets he never even
refers to the plays as part of his achievement, though he does make
what seems to be a half-ashamed allusion to his career as an actor.
It is perfectly possible that he looked on at least half of his
plays as mere pot-boilers and hardly bothered about purpose or
probability so long as he could patch up something, usually from
stolen material, which would more or less hang together on the
stage. However, that is not the whole story. To begin with, as
Tolstoy himself points out, Shakespeare has a habit of thrusting
uncalled-for general reflections into the mouths of his characters.
This is a serious fault in a dramatist, but it does not fit in with
Tolstoy's picture of Shakespeare as a vulgar hack who has no
opinions of his own and merely wishes to produce the greatest
effect with the least trouble. And more than this, about a dozen of
his plays, written for the most part later than 1600, do
unquestionably have a meaning and even a moral. They revolve round
a central subject which in some cases can be reduced to a single
word. For example, MACBETH is about ambition, Othello is about
jealousy, and TIMON OF ATHENS is about money. The subject of LEAR
is renunciation, and it is only by being wilfully blind that one
can fail to understand what Shakespeare is saying.</p>

<p>Lear renounces his throne but expects everyone to continue
treating him as a king. He does not see that if he surrenders
power, other people will take advantage of his weakness: also that
those who flatter him the most grossly, i.e. Regan and Goneril, are
exactly the ones who will turn against him. The moment he finds
that he can no longer make people obey him as he did before, he
falls into a rage which Tolstoy describes as "strange and
unnatural", but which in fact is perfectly in character. In his
madness and despair, he passes through two moods which again are
natural enough in his circumstances, though in one of them it is
probable that he is being used partly as a mouthpiece for
Shakespeare's own opinions. One is the mood of disgust in which
Lear repents, as it were, for having been a king, and grasps for
the first time the rottenness of formal justice and vulgar
morality. The other is a mood of impotent fury in which he wreaks
imaginary revenges upon those who have wronged him. "To have a
thousand with red burning spits come hissing in upon 'em!",
and:</p>

<pre>
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
A troop of horse with felt; I'll put't in proof;
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
</pre>

<p>Only at the end does he realize, as a sane man, that power,
revenge and victory are not worth while:</p>

<pre>
No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison...
....and we'll wear out,
In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones
That ebb and flow by the moon.
</pre>

<p>But by the time he makes this discovery it is too late, for his
death and Cordelia's are already decided on. That is the story,
and, allowing for some clumsiness in the telling, it is a very good
story.</p>

<p>But is it not also curiously similar to the history of Tolstoy
himself? There is a general resemblance which one can hardly avoid
seeing, because the most impressive event in Tolstoy's life, as in
Lear's, was a huge and gratuitous act of renunciation. In his old
age, he renounced his estate, his title and his copyrights, and
made an attempt&mdash;a sincere attempt, though it was not
successful&mdash;to escape from his privileged position and live
the life of a peasant. But the deeper resemblance lies in the fact
that Tolstoy, like Lear, acted on mistaken motives and failed to
get the results he had hoped for. According to Tolstoy, the aim of
every human being is happiness, and happiness can only be attained
by doing the will of God. But doing the will of God means casting
off all earthly pleasures and ambitions, and living only for
others. Ultimately, therefore, Tolstoy renounced the world under
the expectation that this would make him happier. But if there is
one thing certain about his later years, it is that he was NOT
happy. On the contrary he was driven almost to the edge of madness
by the behaviour of the people about him, who persecuted him
precisely BECAUSE of his renunciation. Like Lear, Tolstoy was not
humble and not a good judge of character. He was inclined at
moments to revert to the attitudes of an aristocrat, in spite of
his peasant's blouse, and he even had two children whom he had
believed in and who ultimately turned against him&mdash;though, of
course, in a less sensational manner than Regan and Goneril. His
exaggerated revulsion from sexuality was also distinctly similar to
Lear's. Tolstoy's remark that marriage is "slavery, satiety,
repulsion" and means putting up with the proximity of "ugliness,
dirtiness, smell, sores", is matched by Lear's well-known
outburst:</p>

<pre>
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
Beneath is all the fiends;
There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit,
Burning, scalding, stench, consumption, etc., etc.
</pre>

<p>And though Tolstoy could not foresee it when he wrote his essay
on Shakespeare, even the ending of his life&mdash;the sudden
unplanned flight across country, accompanied only by a faithful
daughter, the death in a cottage in a strange village&mdash;seems
to have in it a sort of phantom reminiscence of LEAR.</p>

<p>Of course, one cannot assume that Tolstoy was aware of this
resemblance, or would have admitted it if it had been pointed out
to him. But his attitude towards the play must have been influenced
by its theme. Renouncing power, giving away your lands, was a
subject on which he had reason to feel deeply; Probably, therefore,
he would be more angered and disturbed by the moral that
Shakespeare draws than he would be in the case of some other
play&mdash;MACBETH, for example&mdash;which did not touch so
closely on his own life. But what exactly is the moral of LEAR?
Evidently there are two morals, one explicit, the other implied in
the story.</p>

<p>Shakespeare starts by assuming that to make yourself powerless
is to invite an attack. This does not mean that EVERYONE will turn
against you (Kent and the Fool stand by Lear from first to last),
but in all probability SOMEONE will. If you throw away your
weapons, some less scrupulous person will pick them up. If you turn
the other cheek, you will get a harder blow on it than you got on
the first one. This docs not always happen, but it is to be
expected, and you ought not to complain if it does happen. The
second blow is, so to speak, part of the act of turning the other
cheek. First of all, therefore, there is the vulgar, common-sense
moral drawn by the Fool: "Don't relinquish power, don't give away
your lands." But there is also another moral. Shakespeare never
utters it in so many words, and it does not very much matter
whether he was fully aware of it. It is contained in the story,
which, after all, he made up, or altered to suit his purposes. It
is: "Give away your lands if you want to, but don't expect to gain
happiness by doing so. Probably you won't gain happiness. If you
live for others, you must live FOR OTHERS, and not as a roundabout
way of getting an advantage for yourself."</p>

<p>Obviously neither of these conclusions could have been pleasing
to Tolstoy. The first of them expresses the ordinary,
belly-to-earth selfishness from which he was genuinely trying to
escape. The other conflicts with his desire to eat his cake and
have it&mdash;that is, to destroy his own egoism and by so doing to
gain eternal life. Of course, LEAR is not a sermon in favour of
altruism. It merely points out the results of practising
self-denial for selfish reasons. Shakespeare had a considerable
streak of worldliness in him, and if he had been forced to take
sides in his own play, his sympathies would probably have lain with
the Fool. But at least he could see the whole issue and treat it at
the level of tragedy. Vice is punished, but virtue is not rewarded.
The morality of Shakespeare's later tragedies is not religious in
the ordinary sense, and certainly is not Christian. Only two of
them, HAMLET and OTHELLO, are supposedly occurring inside the
Christian era, and even in those, apart from the antics of the
ghost in HAMLET, there is no indication of a "next world" where
everything is to be put right. All of these tragedies start out
with the humanist assumption that life, although full of sorrow, is
worth living, and that Man is a noble animal&mdash;a belief which
Tolstoy in his old age did not share.</p>

<p>Tolstoy was not a saint, but he tried very hard to make himself
into a saint, and the standards he applied to literature were
other-worldly ones. It is important to realize that the difference
between a saint and an ordinary human being is a difference of kind
and not of degree. That is, the one is not to be regarded as an
imperfect form of the other. The saint, at any rate Tolstoy's kind
of saint, is not trying to work an improvement in earthly life: he
is trying to bring it to an end and put something different in its
place. One obvious expression of this is the claim that celibacy is
"higher" than marriage. If only, Tolstoy says in effect, we would
stop breeding, fighting, struggling and enjoying, if we could get
rid not only of our sins but of everything else that binds us to
the surface of the earth&mdash;including love, then the whole
painful process would be over and the Kingdom of Heaven would
arrive. But a normal human being does not want the Kingdom of
Heaven: he wants life on earth to continue. This is not solely
because he is "weak", "sinful" and anxious for a "good time". Most
people get a fair amount of fun out of their lives, but on balance
life is suffering, and only the very young or the very foolish
imagine otherwise. Ultimately it is the Christian attitude which is
self-interested and hedonistic, since the aim is always to get away
from the painful struggle of earthly life and find eternal peace in
some kind of Heaven or Nirvana. The humanist attitude is that the
struggle must continue and that death is the price of life. "Men
must endure their going hence, even as their coming hither:
Ripeness is all"&mdash;which is an un-Christian sentiment. Often
there is a seeming truce between the humanist and the religious
believer, but in fact their attitudes cannot be reconciled: one
must choose between this world and the next. And the enormous
majority of human beings, if they understood the issue, would
choose this world. They do make that choice when they continue
working, breeding and dying instead of crippling their faculties in
the hope of obtaining a new lease of existence elsewhere.</p>

<p>We do not know a great deal about Shakespeare's religious
beliefs, and from the evidence of his writings it would be
difficult to prove that he had any. But at any rate he was not a
saint or a would-be saint: he was a human being, and in some ways
not a very good one. It is clear, for instance, that he liked to
stand well with the rich and powerful, and was capable of
flattering them in the most servile way. He is also noticeably
cautious, not to say cowardly, in his manner of uttering unpopular
opinions. Almost never does he put a subversive or sceptical remark
into the mouth of a character likely to be identified with himself.
Throughout his plays the acute social critics, the people who are
not taken in by accepted fallacies, are buffoons, villains,
lunatics or persons who are shamming insanity or are in a state of
violent hysteria. LEAR is a play in which this tendency is
particularly well marked. It contains a great deal of veiled social
criticism&mdash;a point Tolstoy misses&mdash;but it is all uttered
either by the Fool, by Edgar when he is pretending to be mad, or by
Lear during his bouts of madness. In his sane moments Lear hardly
ever makes an intelligent remark. And yet the very fact that
Shakespeare had to use these subterfuges shows how widely his
thoughts ranged. He could not restrain himself from commenting on
almost everything, although he put on a series of masks in order to
do so. If one has once read Shakespeare with attention, it is not
easy to go a day without quoting him, because there are not many
subjects of major importance that he does not discuss or at least
mention somewhere or other, in his unsystematic but illuminating
way. Even the irrelevancies that litter every one of his
plays&mdash;the puns and riddles, the lists of names, the scraps of
"reportage" like the conversation of the carriers in HENRY IV the
bawdy jokes, the rescued fragments of forgotten ballads&mdash;are
merely the products of excessive vitality. Shakespeare was not a
philosopher or a scientist, but he did have curiosity, he loved the
surface of the earth and the process of life&mdash;which, it should
be repealed, is NOT the same thing as wanting to have a good time
and stay alive as long as possible. Of course, it is not because of
the quality of his thought that Shakespeare has survived, and he
might not even be remembered as a dramatist if he had not also been
a poet. His main hold on us is through language. How deeply
Shakespeare himself was fascinated by the music of words can
probably be inferred from the speeches of Pistol. What Pistol says
is largely meaningless, but if one considers his lines singly they
are magnificent rhetorical verse. Evidently, pieces of resounding
nonsense ("Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on",
etc.) were constantly appearing in Shakespeare's mind of their own
accord, and a half-lunatic character had to be invented to use them
up.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's native tongue was not English, and one cannot blame
him for being unmoved by Shakespeare's verse, nor even, perhaps,
for refusing to believe that Shakespeare's skill with words was
something out of the ordinary. But he would also have rejected the
whole notion of valuing poetry for its texture&mdash;valuing it,
that is to say, as a kind of music. If it could somehow have been
proved to him that his whole explanation of Shakespeare's rise to
fame is mistaken, that inside the English-speaking world, at any
rate, Shakespeare's popularity is genuine, that his mere skill in
placing one syllable beside another has given acute pleasure to
generation after generation of English-speaking people&mdash;all
this would not have been counted as a merit to Shakespeare, but
rather the contrary. It would simply have been one more proof of
the irreligious, earthbound nature of Shakespeare and his admirers.
Tolstoy would have said that poetry is to be judged by its meaning,
and that seductive sounds merely cause false meanings to go
unnoticed. At every level it is the same issue&mdash;this world
against the next: and certainly the music of words is something
that belongs to this world.</p>

<p>A sort of doubt has always hung around the character of Tolstoy,
as round the character of Gandhi. He was not a vulgar hypocrite, as
some people declared him to be, and he would probably have imposed
even greater sacrifices on himself than he did, if he had not been
interfered with at every step by the people surrounding him,
especially his wife. But on the other hand it is dangerous to take
such men as Tolstoy at their disciples' valuation. There is always
the possibility&mdash;the probability, indeed&mdash;that they have
done no more than exchange one form of egoism for another. Tolstoy
renounced wealth, fame and privilege; he abjured violence in all
its forms and was ready to suffer for doing so; but it is not easy
to believe that he abjured the principle of coercion, or at least
the DESIRE to coerce others. There are families in which the father
will say to his child, "You'll get a thick car if you do that
again", while the mother, her eyes brimming over with tears, will
take the child in her arms and murmur lovingly, "Now, darling, IS
it kind to Mummy to do that?" And who would maintain that the
second method is less tyrannous than the first? The distinction
that really matters is not between violence and non-violence, but
between having and not having the appetite for power. There are
people who are convinced of the wickedness both of armies and of
police forces, but who are nevertheless much more intolerant and
inquisitorial in outlook than the normal person who believes that
it is necessary to use violence in certain circumstances. They will
not say to somebody else, "Do this, that and the other or you will
go to prison", but they will, if they can, get inside his brain and
dictate his thoughts for him in the minutest particulars. Creeds
like pacifism and anarchism, which seem on the surface to imply a
complete renunciation of power, rather encourage this habit of
mind. For if you have embraced a creed which appears to be free
from the ordinary dirtiness of politics&mdash;a creed from which
you yourself cannot expect to draw any material
advantage&mdash;surely that proves that you are in the right? And
the more you are in the right, the more natural that everyone else
should be bullied into thinking likewise.</p>

<p>If we are to believe what he says in his pamphlet, Tolstoy has
never been able to see any merit in Shakespeare, and was always
astonished to find that his fellow-writers, Turgenev, Fet and
others thought differently. We may be sure that in his unregenerate
days Tolstoy's conclusion would have been: "You like
Shakespeare&mdash;I don't. Let's leave it at that." Later, when his
perception that it takes all sorts to make a world had deserted
him, he came to think of Shakespeare's writings as something
dangerous to himself. The more pleasure people took in Shakespeare,
the less they would listen to Tolstoy. Therefore nobody must be
ALLOWED to enjoy Shakespeare, just as nobody must be allowed to
drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. True, Tolstoy would not prevent
them by force. He is not demanding that the police shall impound
every copy of Shakespeare's works. But he will do dirt on
Shakespeare, if he can. He will try to get inside the mind of every
lover of Shakespeare and kill his enjoyment by every trick he can
think of, including&mdash;as I have shown in my summary of his
pamphlet&mdash;arguments which are self-contradictory or even
doubtfully honest.</p>

<p>But finally the most striking thing is how little difference it
all makes. As I said earlier, one cannot ANSWER Tolstoy's pamphlet,
at least on its main counts. There is no argument by which one can
defend a poem. It defends itself by surviving, or it is
indefensible. And if this test is valid, I think the verdict in
Shakespeare's case must be "not guilty". Like every other writer,
Shakespeare will be forgotten sooner or later, but it is unlikely
that a heavier indictment will ever be brought against him. Tolstoy
was perhaps the most admired literary man of his age, and he was
certainly not its least able pamphleteer. He turned all his powers
of denunciation against Shakespeare, like all the guns of a
battleship roaring simultaneously. And with what result? Forty
years later Shakespeare is still there completely unaffected, and
of the attempt to demolish him nothing remains except the yellowing
pages of a pamphlet which hardly anyone has read, and which would
be forgotten altogether if Tolstoy had not also been the author of
WAR AND PEACE and ANNA KARENINA.</p>

<h2>SUCH, SUCH WERE THE JOYS (1947)</h2>

<p><b>I</b>
</p>

<p>Soon after I arrived at St Cyprian's (not immediately, but after
a week or two, just when I seemed to be settling into the routine
of school life) I began wetting my bed. I was now aged eight, so
that this was a reversion to a habit which I must have grown out of
at least four years earlier. Nowadays, I believe, bed-wetting in
such circumstances is taken for granted. It is normal reaction in
children who have been removed from their homes to a strange place.
In those days, however, it was looked on as a disgusting crime
which the child committed on purpose and for which the proper cure
was a beating. For my part I did not need to be told it was a
crime. Night after night I prayed, with a fervour never previously
attained in my prayers, 'Please God, do not let me wet my bed! Oh,
please God, do not let me wet my bed!', but it made remarkably
little difference. Some nights the thing happened, others not.
There was no volition about it, no consciousness. You did not
properly speaking <i>do</i> the deed: you merely woke up in the
morning and found that the sheets were wringing wet.</p>

<p>After the second of third offence I was warned that I should be
beaten next time, but I received the warning in a curiously
roundabout way. One afternoon, as we were filing out from tea, Mrs
Wilkes the Headmaster's wife, was sitting at the head of one of the
tables, chatting with a lady of whom I knew nothing, except that
she was on an afternoon's visit to the school. She was an
intimidating, masculine-looking person wearing a riding-habit, or
something that I took to be a riding-habit. I was just leaving the
room when Mrs Wilkes called me back, as though to introduce me to
the visitor.</p>

<p>Mrs Wilkes was nicknamed Flip, and I shall call her by that
name, for I seldom think of her by any other. (Officially, however,
she was addressed as Mum, probably a corruption of the 'Ma'am' used
by public schoolboys to their housemasters' wives.) She was a
stocky square-built woman with hard red cheeks, a flat top to her
head, prominent brows and deep-set, suspicious eyes. Although a
great deal of the time she was full of false heartiness, jollying
one along with mannish slang ('<i>Buck</i> up, old chap!' and so
forth), and even using one's Christian name, her eyes never lost
their anxious, accusing look. It was very difficult to look her in
the face without feeling guilty, even at moments when one was not
guilty of anything in particular.</p>

<p>'Here is a little boy,' said Flip, indicating me to the strange
lady, 'who wets his bed every night. Do you know what I am going to
do if you wet your bed again?' she added, turning to me, 'I am
going to get the Sixth Form to beat you'.</p>

<p>The strange lady put on an air of being inexpressibly shocked,
and exclaimed 'I-should-<i>think</i>-so!' And here there occurred
one of those wild, almost lunatic misunderstandings which are part
of the daily experience of childhood. The Sixth Form was a group of
older boys who were selected as having 'character' and were
empowered to beat smaller boys. I had not yet learned of their
existence, and I mis-heard the phrase 'the Sixth Form' as 'Mrs
Form'. I took it as referring to the strange lady--I thought, that
is, that her name was Mrs Form. It was an improbable name, but a
child has no judgement in such matters. I imagined, therefore, that
it was <i>she</i> who was to be deputed to beat me. It did not
strike me as strange that this job should be turned over to a
casual visitor in no way connected with the school. I merely
assumed the 'Mrs Form' was a stern disciplinarian who enjoyed
beating people (somehow her appearance seemed to bear this out) and
I had an immediate terrifying vision of her arriving for the
occasion in full riding kit and armed with a hunting-whip. To this
day I can feel myself almost swooning with shame as I stood, a very
small, round-faced boy in short corduroy knickers, before the two
women. I could not speak. I felt that I should die if 'Mrs Form'
were to beat me. But my dominant feeling was not fear or even
resentment: it was simply shame because one more person, and that a
woman, had been told of my disgusting offence.</p>

<p>A little later, I forget how, I learned that it was not after
all 'Mrs Form' who would do the beating. I cannot remember whether
it was that very night that I wetted my bed again, but at any rate
I did wet it again quite soon. Oh, the despair, the feeling of
cruel injustice, after all my prayers and resolutions, at once
again waking between the clammy sheets! There was no chance of
hiding what I had done. The grim statuesque matron, Margaret by
name, arrived in the dormitory specially to inspect my bed. She
pulled back the clothes, then drew herself up, and the dreaded
words seemed to come rolling out of her like a peal of thunder:</p>

<p>'REPORT YOURSELF to the Headmaster after breakfast!'</p>

<p>I put REPORT YOURSELF in capitals because that was how it
appeared in my mind. I do not know how many times I heard that
phrase during my early years at St Cyprian's. It was only very
rarely that it did not mean a beating. The words always had a
portentous sound in my ears, like muffled drums or the words of the
death sentence.</p>

<p>When I arrived to report myself, Flip was doing something or
other at he the long shiny table in the ante-room to the study. Her
uneasy eyes searched me as I went past. Sambo was a
round-shouldered, curiously oafish-looking man, not large but
shambling in gait, with a chubby face which was like that of an
overgrown baby, and which was capable of good humour. He knew, of
course, why I had been sent to him, and had already taken a
bone-handled riding-crop out of the cupboard, but it was part of
the punishment of reporting yourself that you had to proclaim your
offence with your own lips. When I had said my say, he read me a
short but pompous lecture, then seized me by the scruff of the
neck, twisted me over and began beating me with the riding-crop. He
had a habit of continuing his lecture while he flogged you, and I
remember the words 'you dir-ty lit-tle boy' keeping time with the
blows. The beating did not hurt (perhaps, as it was the first time,
he was not hitting me very hard), and I walked out feeling very
much better. The fact that the beating had not hurt was a sort of
victory and partially wiped out the shame of the bed-wetting. I was
even incautious enough to wear a grin on my face. Some small boys
were hanging about in the passage outside the door of the
ante-room.</p>

<p>'D'you get the cane?'</p>

<p>'It didn't hurt.' I said proudly.</p>

<p>Flip had heard everything. Instantly her voice came screaming
after me:</p>

<p>'Come here! Come here this instant! What was that you said?'</p>

<p>'I said it didn't hurt,' I faltered out.</p>

<p>'How dare you say a thing like that? Do you think that is a
proper thing to say? Go in and REPORT YOURSELF AGAIN!'</p>

<p>This time Sambo laid on in real earnest. He continued for a
length of time that frightened and astonished me--about five
minutes, it seemed--ending up by breaking the riding-crop. The bone
handle went flying across the room.</p>

<p>'Look what you've made me do!' he said furiously, holding the
broken crop.</p>

<p>I had fallen into a chair, weakly snivelling. I remember that
this was the only time throughout my boyhood when a beating
actually reduced me to tears, and curiously enough I was not even
now crying because of the pain. The second beating had not hurt
very much either. Fright and shame seemed to have anaesthetized me.
I was crying partly because I felt that this was expected of me,
partly from genuine repentance, but partly also because of a deeper
grief which is peculiar to childhood and not easy to convey: a
sense of desolate loneliness and helplessness, of being locked up
not only in a hostile world but in a world of good and evil where
the rules were such that it was actually not possible for me to
keep them.</p>

<p>I knew the bed-wetting was (a) wicked and (b) outside my
control. The second fact I was personally aware of, and the first I
did not question. It was possible, therefore, to commit a sin
without knowing that you committed it, without wanting to commit
it, and without being able to avoid it. Sin was not necessarily
something that you did: it might be something that happened to you.
I do not want to claim that this idea flashed into my mind as a
complete novelty at this very moment, under the blows of Sambo's
cane: I must have had glimpses of it even before I left home, for
my early childhood had not been altogether happy. But at any rate
this was the great, abiding lesson of my boyhood: that I was in a
world where it was <i>not possible</i> for me to be good. And the
double beating was a turning-point, for it brought home to me for
the first time the harshness of the environment into which I had
been flung. Life was more terrible, and I was more wicked, than I
had imagined. At any rate, as I sat snivelling on the edge of a
chair in Sambo's study, with not even the self-possession to stand
up while he stormed at me, I had a conviction of sin and folly and
weakness, such as I do not remember to have felt before.</p>

<p>In general, one's memories of any period must necessarily weaken
as one moves away from it. One is constantly learning new facts,
and old ones have to drop out to make way for them. At twenty I
could have written the history of my schooldays with an accuracy
which would be quite impossible now. But it can also happen that
one's memories grow sharper after a long lapse of time, because one
is looking at the past with fresh eyes and can isolate and, as it
were, notice facts which previously existed undifferentiated among
a mass of others. Here are two things which in a sense I
remembered, but which did not strike me as strange or interesting
until quite recently. One is that the second beating seemed to me a
just and reasonable punishment. To get one beating, and then to get
another and far fiercer one on top of it, for being so unwise as to
show that the first had not hurt--that was quite natural. The gods
are jealous, and when you have good fortune you should conceal it.
The other is that I accepted the broken riding-crop as my own
crime. I can still recall my feeling as I saw the handle lying on
the carpet--the feeling of having done an ill-bred clumsy thing,
and ruined an expensive object. <i>I</i> had broken it: so Sambo
told me, and so I believed. This acceptance of guilt lay unnoticed
in my memory for twenty or thirty years.</p>

<p>So much for the episode of the bed-wetting. But there is one
more thing to be remarked. This is that I did not wet my bed
again--at least, I did wet it once again, and received another
beating, after which the trouble stopped. So perhaps this barbarous
remedy does work, though at a heavy price, I have no doubt.</p>

<p><b>II</b>
</p>

<p>St Cyprian's was an expensive and snobbish school which was in
process of becoming more snobbish, and, I imagine, more expensive.
The public school with which it had special connexions was Harrow,
but during my time an increasing proportion of the boys went on to
Eton. Most of them were the children of rich parents, but on the
whole they were the un-aristocratic rich, the sort of people who
live in huge shrubberied houses in Bournemouth or Richmond, and who
have cars and butlers but not country estates. There were a few
exotics among them--some South American boys, sons of Argentine
beef barons, one or two Russians, and even a Siamese prince, or
someone who was described as a prince.</p>

<p>Sambo had two great ambitions. One was to attract titled boys to
the school, and the other was to train up pupils to win
scholarships at public schools, above all at Eton. He did, towards
the end of my time, succeed in getting hold of two boys with real
English titles. One of them, I remember, was a wretched drivelling
little creature, almost an albino, peering upwards out of weak
eyes, with a long nose at the end of which a dewdrop always seemed
to be trembling. Sambo always gave these boys their titles when
mentioning them to a third person, and for their first few days he
actually addressed them to their faces as 'Lord So-and-so.'
Needless to say he found ways of drawing attention to them when any
visitor was being shown round the school. Once, I remember, the
little fair-haired boy had a choking fit at dinner, and a stream of
snot ran out of his nose on to his plate in a way horrible to see.
Any lesser person would have been called a dirty little beast and
ordered out of the room instantly: but Sambo and Flip laughed it
off in a 'boys will be boys' spirit.</p>

<p>All the very rich boys were more or less undisguisedly favoured.
The school still had a faint suggestion of the Victorian 'private
academy' with its 'parlour boarders', and when I later read about
that kind of school in Thackeray I immediately saw the resemblance.
The rich boys had milk and biscuits in the middle of the morning,
they were given riding lessons once or twice a week, Flip mothered
them and called them by their Christian names, and above all they
were never caned. Apart from the South Americans, whose parents
were safely distant, I doubt whether Sambo ever caned any boy whose
father's income was much above £2,000 a year. But he was sometimes
willing to sacrifice financial profit to scholastic prestige.
Occasionally, by special arrangement, he would take at greatly
reduced fees some boy who seemed likely to win scholarships and
thus bring credit on the school. It was on these terms that I was
at St Cyprian's myself: otherwise my parents could not have
afforded to send me to so expensive a school.</p>

<p>I did not at first understand that I was being taken at reduced
fees; it was only when I was about eleven that Flip and Sambo began
throwing the fact in my teeth. For my first two or three years I
went through the ordinary educational mill: then, soon after I had
stated Greek (one started Latin at eight, Greek at ten), I moved
into the scholarship class, which was taught, so far as classics
went, largely by Sambo himself. Over a period of two or three years
the scholarship boys were crammed with learning as cynically as a
goose is crammed for Christmas. And with what learning! This
business of making a gifted boy's career depend on a competitive
examination, taken when he is only twelve or thirteen is an evil
thing at best, but there do appear to be preparatory schools which
send scholars to Eton, Winchester, etc. without teaching them to
see everything in terms of marks. At St Cyprian's the whole process
was frankly a preparation for a sort of confidence trick. Your job
was to learn exactly those things that would give an examiner the
impression that you knew more than you did know, and as far as
possible to avoid burdening your brain with anything else. Subjects
which lacked examination-value, such as geography, were almost
completely neglected, mathematics was also neglected if you were a
'classical', science was not taught in any form--indeed it was so
despised that even an interest in natural history was
discouraged--and even the books you were encouraged to read in your
spare time were chosen with one eye on the 'English paper'. Latin
and Greek, the main scholarship subjects, were what counted, but
even these were deliberately taught in a flashy, unsound way. We
never, for example, read right through even a single book of a
Greek or Latin author: we merely read short passages which were
picked out because they were the kind of thing likely to be set as
an 'unseen translation'. During the last year or so before we went
up for our scholarships, most of our time was spent in simply
working our way through the scholarship papers of previous years.
Sambo had sheaves of these in his possession, from every one of the
major public schools. But the greatest outrage of all was the
teaching of history.</p>

<p>There was in those days a piece of nonsense called the Harrow
History Prize, an annual competition for which many preparatory
schools entered. It was a tradition for St Cyprian's to win it
every year, as well we might, for we had mugged up every paper that
had been set since the competition started, and the supply of
possible questions was not inexhaustible. They were the kind of
stupid question that is answered by rapping out a name of
quotation. Who plundered the Begams? Who was beheaded in an open
boat? Who caught the Whigs bathing and ran away with their clothes?
Almost all our historical teaching ran on this level. History was a
series of unrelated, unintelligible but--in some way that was never
explained to us--important facts with resounding phrases tied to
them. Disraeli brought peace with honour. Clive was astonished at
his moderation. Pitt called in the New World to redress the balance
of the Old. And the dates, and the mnemonic devices. (Did you know,
for example, that the initial letters of 'A black Negress was my
aunt: there's her house behind the barn' are also the initial
letters of the battles in the Wars of the Roses?) Flip, who 'took'
the higher forms in history, revelled in this kind of thing. I
recall positive orgies of dates, with the keener boys leaping up
and down in their places in their eagerness to shout out the right
answers, and at the same time not feeling the faintest interest in
the meaning of the mysterious events they were naming.</p>

<p>'1587'</p>

<p>'Massacre of St Bartholomew!'</p>

<p>'1707?'</p>

<p>'Death of Aurangzeeb!'</p>

<p>'1713?'</p>

<p>'Treaty of Utrecht!'</p>

<p>'1773?'</p>

<p>'Boston Tea Party!'</p>

<p>'1520?'</p>

<p>'Oo, Mum, please, Mum--'</p>

<p>'Please, Mum, please Mum! Let me tell him, Mum!'</p>

<p>'Well!'</p>

<p>'1520?'</p>

<p>'Field of the Cloth of Gold!'</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>But history and such secondary subjects were not bad fun. It was
in 'classics' that the real strain came. Looking back, I realize
that I then worked harder than I have ever done since, and yet at
the time it never seemed possible to made quite the effort that was
demanded of one. We would sit round the long shiny table, made of
some very pale-coloured hard wood, with Sambo goading, threatening,
exhorting, sometimes joking, very occasionally praising, but always
prodding, prodding away at one's mind to keep it up to the right
pitch of concentration, as one keeps a sleepy person awake by
sticking pins in him.</p>

<p>'Go on, you little slacker! Go on, you idle, worthless little
boy! The whole trouble with you is that you're bone and horn idle.
You eat too much, that's why. You wolf down enormous meals, and
then when you come here you're half asleep. Go on, now, put your
back into it. You're not <i>thinking</i>. Your brain doesn't
sweat.'</p>

<p>He would tap away at one's skull with his silver pencil, which,
in my memory, seems to have been about the size of a banana, and
which certainly was heavy enough to raise a bump: or he would pull
the short hairs round one's ears, or, occasionally, reach out under
the table and kick one's shin. On some days nothing seemed to go
right, and then it would be 'All right, then, I know what you want.
You've been asking for it the whole morning. Come along, you
useless little slacker. Come into the study.' And then whack,
whack, whack, and back one would come, red-wealed and smarting--in
later years Sambo had abandoned his riding-crop in favour of a thin
rattan cane which hurt very much more--to settle down to work
again. This did not happen very often, but I do remember, more than
once, being led out of the room in the middle of a Latin sentence,
receiving a beating and then going straight ahead with the same
sentence, just like that. It is a mistake to think such methods do
not work. They work very well for their special purpose. Indeed, I
doubt whether classical education ever has been or can be
successfully carried on without corporal punishment. The boys
themselves believed in its efficacy. There was a boy named Beacham,
with no brains to speak of, but evidently in acute need of a
scholarship. Sambo was flogging him towards the goal as one might
do with a foundered horse. He went up for a scholarship at
Uppingham, came back with a consciousness of having done badly, and
a day or two later received a severe beating for idleness. 'I wish
I'd had that caning before I went up for the exam,' he said
sadly--a remark which I felt to be contemptible, but which I
perfectly well understood.</p>

<p>The boys of the scholarship class were not all treated alike. If
a boy were the son of rich parents to whom the saving of fees was
not all-important, Sambo would goad him along in a comparatively
fatherly way, with jokes and digs in the ribs and perhaps an
occasional tap with the pencil, but no hair-pulling and no caning.
It was the poor but 'clever' boys who suffered. Our brains were a
gold-mine in which he had sunk money, and the dividends must be
squeezed out of us. Long before I had grasped the nature of my
financial relationship with Sambo, I had been made to understand
that I was not on the same footing as most of the other boys. In
effect there were three castes in the school. There was the
minority with an aristocratic or millionaire background, there were
the children of the ordinary suburban rich, who made up the bulk of
the school, and there were a few underlings like myself, the sons
of clergyman, Indian civil servants, struggling widows and the
like. These poorer ones were discouraged from going in for 'extras'
such as shooting and carpentry, and were humiliated over clothes
and petty possessions. I never, for instance, succeeded in getting
a cricket bat of my own, because 'Your parents wouldn't be able to
afford it'. This phrase pursued me throughout my schooldays. At St
Cyprian's we were not allowed to keep the money we brought back
with us, but had to 'give it in' on the first day of term, and then
from time to time were allowed to spend it under supervision. I and
similarly-placed boys were always choked off from buying expensive
toys like model aeroplanes, even if the necessary money stood to
our credit. Flip, in particular, seemed to aim consciously at
inculcating a humble outlook in the poorer boys. 'Do you think
that's the sort of thing a boy like you should buy?' I remember her
saying to somebody--and she said this in front of the whole school:
'You know you're not going to grow up with money, don't you? Your
people aren't rich. You must learn to be sensible. Don't get above
yourself!' There was also the weekly pocket-money, which we took
out in sweets, dispensed by Flip from a large table. The
millionaires had a sixpence a week, but the normal sum was
threepence. I and one or two others were only allowed twopence. My
parents had not given instructions to this effect, and the saving
of a penny a week could not conceivably have made any difference to
them: it was a mark of status. Worse yet was the detail of the
birthday cakes. It was usual for each boy, on his birthday, to have
a large iced cake with candles, which was shared out at tea between
the whole school. It was provided as a matter of routine and went
on his parents' bill. I never had such a cake, though my parents
would have paid for it readily enough. Year after year, never
daring to ask, I would miserably hope that his year a cake would
appear. Once or twice I even rashly pretended to my companions that
this time I <i>was</i> going to have a cake. Then came tea-time,
and no cake, which did not make me more popular.</p>

<p>Very early it was impressed upon me that I had no chance of a
decent future unless I won a scholarship at a public school. Either
I won my scholarship, or I must leave school at fourteen and
become, in Sambo's favourite phrase 'a little office boy at forty
pounds a year'. In my circumstances it was natural that I should
believe this. Indeed, it was universally taken for granted at St
Cyprian's that unless you went to a 'good' public school (and only
about fifteen schools came under this heading) you were ruined for
life. It is not easy to convey to a grown-up person the sense of
strain, of nerving oneself for some terrible, all-deciding combat,
as the date of the examination crept nearer--eleven years old,
twelve years old, then thirteen, the fatal year itself! Over a
period of about two years, I do not think there was ever a day when
'the exam', as I called it, was quite out of my waking thoughts. In
my prayers it figured invariably: and whenever I got the bigger
portion of a wishbone, or picked up a horseshoe, or bowed seven
times to the new moon, or succeeded in passing through a
wishing-gate without touching the sides, then the wish I earned by
doing so went on 'the exam' as a matter of course. And yet
curiously enough I was also tormented by an almost irresistible
impulse <i>not</i> to work. There were days when my heart sickened
at the labours ahead of me, and I stood stupid as an animal before
the most elementary difficulties. In the holidays, also, I could
not work. Some of the scholarship bonus received extra tuition from
a certain Mr Batchelor, a likeable, very hairy man who wore shaggy
suits and lived in a typical bachelor's 'den'--book-lined wall,
over-whelming stench of tobacco--somewhere in the town. During the
holidays Mr Batchelor used to send us extracts from a wad of work
once a week. Somehow I could not do it. The empty paper and the
black Latin dictionary lying on the table, the consciousness of a
plain duty shirked, poisoned my leisure, but somehow I could not
start, and by the end of the holidays I would only have sent Mr
Batchelor fifty or a hundred lines. Undoubtedly part of the reason
was that Sambo and his cane were far away. But in term-time, also,
I would go through periods of idleness and stupidity when I would
sink deeper and deeper into disgrace and even achieve a sort of
feeble, snivelling defiance, fully conscious of my guilt and yet
unable or unwilling--I could not be sure which--to do any better.
Then Sambo or Flip would send for me, and this time it would not
even be a caning.</p>

<p>Flip would search me with her baleful eyes. (What colour were
those eyes, I wonder? I remember them as green, but actually no
human being has green eyes. Perhaps they were hazel.) She would
start off in her peculiar, wheedling, bullying style, which never
failed to get right through one's guard and score a hit on one's
better nature.</p>

<p>'I don't think it's awfully decent of you to behave like this,
is it? Do you think it's quite playing the game by your mother and
father to go on idling your time away, week after week, month after
month? Do you <i>want</i> to throw all your chances away? You know
your people aren't rich, don't you? You know they can't afford the
same things as other boys' parents. How are they to send you to a
public school if you don't win a scholarship? I know how proud your
mother is of you. Do you <i>want</i> to let her down?'</p>

<p>'I don't think he wants to go to a public school any longer,'
Sambo would say, addressing himself to Flip with a pretence that I
was not there. 'I think he's given up that idea. He wants to be a
little boy at forty pounds a year.'</p>

<p>The horrible sensation of tears--a swelling in the breast, a
tickling behind the nose--would already have assailed me. Flip
would bring out her ace of trumps:</p>

<p>'And do you think it's quite fair to <i>us</i>, the way you're
behaving? After all we've done for you? You <i>do</i> know what
we've done for you, don't you?' Her eyes would pierce deep into me,
and though she never said it straight out, I did know. 'We've had
you here all these years--we even had you here for a week in the
holidays so that Mr Batchelor could coach you. We don't <i>want</i>
to have to send you away, you know, but we can't keep a boy here
just to eat up our food, term after term. <i>I</i> don't think it's
very straight, the way you're behaving. Do you?'</p>

<p>I never had any answer except a miserable 'No, Mum,' or 'Yes,
Mum,' as the case might be. Evidently it was <i>not</i> straight,
the way I was behaving. And at some point or other the unwanted
tear would always force its way out of the corner of my eye, roll
down my nose and splash.</p>

<p>Flip never said in plain words that I was a non-paying pupil, no
doubt because vague phrases like 'all we've done for you' had a
deeper emotional appeal. Sambo, who did not aspire to be loved by
his pupils, put it more brutally, though, as was usual with him in
pompous language. 'You are living on my bounty' was his favourite
phrase in this context. At least once I listened to these words
between blows of the cane. I must say that these scenes were not
frequent, and except on one occasion they did not take place in the
presence of other boys. In public I was reminded that I was poor
and that my parents 'wouldn't be able to afford' this or that, but
I was not actually reminded of my dependent position. It was a
final unanswerable argument, to be brought forth like an instrument
of torture when my work became exceptionally bad.</p>

<p>To grasp the effect of this kind of thing on a child of ten or
twelve, one has to remember that the child has little sense of
proportion or probability. A child may be a mass of egoism and
rebelliousness, but it as no accumulated experience to give it
confidence in its own judgements. On the whole it will accept what
it is told, and it will believe in the most fantastic way in the
knowledge and powers of the adults surrounding it. Here is an
example.</p>

<p>I have said that at St Cyprian's we were not allowed to keep our
own money. However, it was possible to hold back a shilling or two,
and sometimes I used furtively to buy sweets which I kept hidden in
the loose ivy on the playing-field wall. One day when I had been
sent on an errand I went into a sweet-shop a mile or more from the
school and bought some chocolates. As I came out of the shop I saw
on the opposite pavement a small sharp-faced man who seemed to be
staring very hard at my school cap. Instantly a horrible fear went
through me. There could be no doubt as to who the man was. He was a
spy placed there by Sambo! I turned away unconcernedly, and then,
as though my legs were doing it of their own accord, broke into a
clumsy run. But when I got round the next corner I forced myself to
walk again, for to run was a sign of guilt, and obviously there
would be other spies posted here and there about the town. All that
day and the next I waited for the summons to the study, and was
surprised when it did not come. It did not seem to me strange that
the headmaster of a private school should dispose of an army of
informers, and I did not even imagine that would have to pay them.
I assumed that any adult, inside the school or outside, would
collaborate voluntarily in preventing us from breaking the rules.
Sambo was all-powerful; it was natural that his agent should be
everywhere. When this episode happened I do not think I can have
been less than twelve years old.</p>

<p>I hated Sambo and Flip, with a sort of shamefaced, remorseful
hatred, but it did not occur to me to doubt their judgement. When
they told me that I must either win a public-school scholarship or
become an office boy at fourteen, I believed that those were the
unavoidable alternatives before me. And above all, I believed Sambo
and Flip when they told me they were my benefactors. I see now, of
course, that from Sambo's point of view I was a good speculation.
He sank money in me, and he looked to get it back in the form of
prestige. If I had 'gone off; as promising boys sometimes do, I
imagine that would have got rid of me swiftly. As it was I won him
scholarships when the time came, and no doubt he made full use of
them in his prospectuses. But it is difficult for a child to
realize that a school is primarily a commercial venture. A child
believes that the school exists to educate and that the
school-master disciplines him either for his own good, or from a
love of bullying. Flip and Sambo had chosen to befriend me, and
their friendship included canings, reproaches and humiliations,
which were good for me and saved me from an office stool. That was
their version, and I believed in it. It was therefore clear that I
owed them a vast debt of gratitude. But I was <i>not</i> grateful,
as I very well knew. On the contrary, I hated both of them. I could
not control my subjective feelings, and I could not conceal them
from myself. But it is wicked, is it not, to hate your benefactors?
So I was taught, and so I believed. A child accepts the codes of
behaviour that are presented to it, even when it breaks them. From
the age of eight or even earlier, the consciousness of sin was
never far away from me. If I contrived to seem callous and defiant,
it was only a thin cover over a mass of shame and dismay. All
through my boyhood I had a profound conviction that I was no good,
that was wasting my time, wrecking my talents, behaving with
monstrous folly and wickedness and ingratitude--and all this, it
seemed, was in escapable, because I lived among laws which were
absolute, like the law of gravity, but which it was not possible
for me to keep.</p>

<p><b>III</b>
</p>

<p>No one can look back on his schooldays and say with truth that
they were altogether unhappy.</p>

<p>I have good memories of St Cyprian's, among a horde of bad ones.
Sometimes on summer afternoons there were wonderful expeditions
across the Downs to a village called Birling Gap, or to Beachy
Head, where one bathed dangerously among the boulders and came home
covered with cuts. And there were still more wonderful mid-summer
evenings when, as a special treat, we were not driven off to bed as
usual but allowed to wander about the grounds in the long twilight,
ending up with a plunge into the swimming bathe at about nine
o'clock. There was the joy of waking early on summer mornings and
getting in an hour's undisturbed reading (Ian Hay, Thackeray,
Kipling and H. G. Wells were the favourite authors of my boyhood)
in the sunlit, sleeping dormitory. There was also cricket, which I
was no good at but with which I conducted a sort of hopeless love
affair up to the age of about eighteen. And there was the pleasure
of keeping caterpillars--the silky green and purple puss-moth, the
ghostly green poplar-hawk, the privet-hawk, large as one's third
finger, specimens of which could be illicitly purchased for
sixpence at a shop in the town--and, when one could escape long
enough from the master who was 'taking the walk', there was the
excitement of dredging the dew-ponds on the Downs for enormous
newts with orange-coloured bellies. This business of being out for
a walk, coming across something of fascinating interest and then
being dragged away from it by a yell from the master, like a dog
jerked onwards by the leash, is an important feature of school
life, and helps to build up the conviction, so strong in many
children, that the things you most want to do are always
unattainable.</p>

<p>Very occasionally, perhaps once during each summer, it was
possible to escape altogether from the barrack-like atmosphere of
school, when Brown, the second master, was permitted to take one or
two boys for an afternoon of butterfly hunting on a common a few
miles away. Brown was a man with white hair and a red face like a
strawberry, who was good at natural history, making models and
plaster casts, operating magic lanterns, and things of that kind.
He and Mr Batchelor were the only adults in any way connected with
the school whom I did not either dislike or fear. Once he took me
into his room and showed me in confidence a plated, pearl-handled
revolver--his 'six-shooter', he called it--which he kept in a box
under his bed, and oh, the joy of those occasional expeditions! The
ride of two or three miles on a lonely little branch line, the
afternoon of charging to and fro with large green nets, the beauty
of the enormous dragonflies which hovered over the tops of the
grasses, the sinister killing-bottle with its sickly smell, and
then tea in the parlour of a pub with large slices of pale-coloured
cake! The essence of it was in the railway journey, which seemed to
put magic distances between yourself and school.</p>

<p>Flip, characteristically, disapproved of these expeditions,
though not actually forbidding them. 'And have you been catching
<i>little butterflies</i>?' she would say with a vicious sneer when
one got back, making her voice as babyish as possible. From her
point of view, natural history ('bug-hunting' she would probably
have called it) was a babyish pursuit which a boy should be laughed
out of as early as possible. Moreover it was somehow faintly
plebeian, it was traditionally associated with boys who wore
spectacles and were no good at games, it did not help you to pass
exams, and above all it smelt of science and therefore seemed to
menace classical education. It needed a considerable moral effort
to accept Brown's invitation. How I dreaded that sneer of <i>little
butterflies</i>! Brown, however, who had been at the school since
its early days, had built up a certain independence for himself: he
seemed to handle Sambo, and ignored Flip a good deal. If it ever
happened that both of them were away, Brown acted as deputy
headmaster, and on those occasions instead of reading the appointed
lesson for the day at morning chapel, he would read us stories from
the Apocrypha.</p>

<p>Most of the good memories of my childhood, and up to the age of
about twenty, are in some way connected with animals. So far as St
Cyprian's goes, it also seems, when I look back, that all my good
memories are of summer. In winter your nose ran continually, your
fingers were too numb to button your shirt (this was an especial
misery on Sundays, when we wore Eton collars), there was the daily
nightmare of football--the cold, the mud, the hideous greasy ball
that came whizzing at one's face, the gouging knees and trampling
boots of the bigger boys. Part of the trouble was that in winter,
after about the age of ten, I was seldom in good health, at any
rate during term-time. I had defective bronchial tubes and a lesion
in one lung which was not discovered till many years later. Hence I
not only had a chronic cough, but running was a torment to me. In
those days however, 'wheeziness', or 'chestiness', as it was
called, was either diagnosis imagination or was looked on as
essentially a moral disorder, caused by overeating. 'You wheeze
like a concertina,' Sambo would say disapprovingly as he stood
behind my chair; 'You're perpetually stuffing yourself with food,
that's why.' My cough was referred to as a 'stomach cough', which
made it sound both disgusting and reprehensible. The cure for it
was hard running, which, if you kept it up long enough, ultimately
'cleared your chest'.</p>

<p>It is curious, the degree--I will not say of actual hardship,
but of squalor and neglect--that was taken for granted in
upper-class schools of the period. Almost as in the days of
Thackeray, it seemed natural that a little boy of eight or ten
should be a miserable, sotty-nosed creature, his face almost
permanently dirty, his hands chapped, his nails bitten, his
handkerchief a sodden horror, his bottom frequently blue with
bruises. It was partly the prospect of actual physical discomfort
that made the thought of going back to school lie in one's breast
like a lump of lead during the last few days of the holidays. A
characteristic memory of St Cyprian's is the astonishing hardness
of one's bed on the first night of term. Since this was an
expensive school, I took a social step upwards by attending it, and
yet the standard of comfort was in every way far lower than in my
own home, or, indeed, than it would have been in a prosperous
working-class home. One only had a hot bath once a week, for
instance. The food was not only bad, it was also insufficient.
Never before or since have I seen butter of jam scraped on bread so
thinly. I so not think I can be imagining the fact that we were
underfed, when I remember the lengths we would go in order to steal
food. On a number of occasions I remember creeping down at two or
three o'clock in the morning through what seemed like miles of
pitch-dark stairways and passages--barefooted, stopping to listen
after each step, paralysed with about equal fear of Sambo, ghosts
and burglars--to steal stale bread from the pantry. The assistant
masters had their meals with us, but they had somewhat better food,
and if one got half a chance it was usual to steal left-over scraps
of bacon rind or fried potato when their plates were removed.</p>

<p>As usual, I did not see the sound commercial reason for this
underfeeding On the whole I accepted Sambo's view that a boy's
appetite is a sort of morbid growth which should be kept in check
as much as possible. A maxim often repeated to us at St Cprian's
was that it is healthy to get up from a meal feeling as hungry as
when you sat down. Only a generation earlier than this it had been
common for school dinners to start off with a slab of unsweetened
suet pudding, which, it was frankly said, 'broke the boys
appetites.' But the underfeeding was probably less flagrant at
preparatory schools, where a boy was wholly dependent on the
official diet, than at public schools, where he was
allowed--indeed, expected--to buy extra food for himself. At some
schools, he would literally not have had enough to eat unless he
had bought regular supplies of eggs, sausages, sardines, etc.; and
his parents had to allow him money for this purpose. At Eton, for
instance, at any rate in College, a boy was given no solid meal
after mid-day dinner. For his afternoon tea he was given a
miserable supper of soup or fried fish, or more often bread and
cheese, with water to drink. Sambo went down to see his eldest son
at Eton and came back in snobbish ecstasies over the luxury in
which the boys lived. 'They give them fried fish for supper!' he
exclaimed, beaming all over his chubby face. 'There's no school
like it in the world.' Fried fish! The habitual supper of the
poorest of the working class! At very cheap boarding schools it was
no doubt worse. A very early memory to mine is of seeing the
boarders at a grammar school--the sons, probably, of farmers and
shopkeepers--being fed on boiled lights.</p>

<p>Whoever writes about his childhood must beware of exaggeration
and self-pity. I do not claim that I was a martyr or that St
Cyprian's was a sort of Dotheboys Hall. But I should be falsifying
my own memories if I did not record that they are largely memories
of disgust. The over crowded, underfed underwashed life that we led
was disgusting, as I recall it. If I shut my eyes and say 'school',
it is of course the physical surroundings that first come back to
me: the flat playing field with its cricket pavilion and the little
shed by the rifle range, the draughty dormitories, the dusty
splintery passages, the square of asphalt in front of the
gymnasium, the raw-looking pinewood chaplet at the back. And at
almost every point some filthy detail obtrudes itself. For example,
there were the pewter bowls out of which we had our porridge. They
had overhanging rims, and under the rimes there were accumulations
of sour porridge, which could be flaked off in ling strips. The
porridge itself, too, contained more lumps, hairs and unexplained
black things than one would have thought possible, unless someone
were putting them there on purpose. It was never safe to start on
that porridge without investigating it first. And there was the
slimy water of the plunge bath--it was twelve or fifteen feet long,
the whole school was supposed to go into it every morning, and I
doubt whether the water was changed at all frequently--and the
always-damp towels with their cheesy smell: and, on occasional
visits in the winter, the murky sea-water of the local Baths, which
came straight in from the beach and on which I once saw floating a
human turd. And the sweaty smell of the changing-room with its
greasy basins, and, giving on this, the row of filthy, dilapidated
lavatories, which had no fastenings of any kind on the doors, so
that whenever you were sitting there someone was sure to come
crashing in. It is not easy for me to think of my schooldays
without seeming to breathe in a whiff of something cold and
evil-smelling--a sort of compound of sweaty stockings, dirty
towels, faecal smells blowing along corridors, forks with old food
between the prongs, neck-of-mutton stew, and the banging doors of
the lavatories and the echoing chamber-pots in the dormitories.</p>

<p>It is true that I am by nature not gregarious, and the W.C. and
dirty handkerchief side of life in necessarily more obtrusive when
great numbers of human beings are crushed together in a small
space. It is just as bad in an army, and worse, no doubt, in a
prison. Besides, boyhood is the age of disgust. After one has
learned to differentiate, and before one has become
hardened--between seven and eighteen, say--one seems always to be
walking the tight-rope over a cesspool. Yet I do not think I
exaggerate the squalor of school life, when I remember how health
and cleanliness were neglected, in spite of the hoo-ha about fresh
air and cold water and keeping in hard training. It was common to
remain constipated for days together. Indeed, one was hardly
encouraged to keep one's bowels open, since the only aperients
tolerated were castor oil or another almost equally horrible drink
called liquorice powder. One was supposed to go into the plunge
bath every morning, but some boys shirked it for days on end,
simply making themselves scarce when the bell sounded, or else
slipping along the edge of the bath among the crowd, and then
wetting their hair with a little dirty water off the floor. A
little boy of eight or nine will not necessarily keep himself clean
unless there is someone to see that he does it. There was a new boy
named Hazel, a pretty, mother's darling of a boy, who came a little
while before I left. The first thing I noticed about him was the
beautiful pearly whiteness of his teeth. By the end of that term
his teeth were an extraordinary shade of green. During all that
time, apparently, no one had taken sufficient interest in him to
see that he brushed them.</p>

<p>But of course the differences between home and school were more
than physical. That bump on the hard mattress, on the first night
of term, used to give me a feeling of abrupt awakening, a feeling
of: 'This is reality, this is what you are up against.' Your home
might be far from perfect, but at least it was a place ruled by
love rather than by fear, where you did not have to be perpetually
on your guard against the people surrounding you. At eight years
old you were suddenly taken out of this warm nest and flung into a
world of force and fraud and secrecy, like a gold-fish into a tank
full of pike. Against no matter what degree of bullying you had no
redress. You could only have defended yourself by sneaking, which,
except in a few rigidly defined circumstances, was the unforgivable
sin. To write home and ask your parent to take you away would have
been even less thinkable, since to do so would have been to admit
yourself unhappy and unpopular, which a boy will never do. Boys are
Erewhonians: they think that misfortune is disgraceful and must be
concealed to all cost. It might perhaps have been considered
permissible to complain to your parents about bad food, or an
unjustified caning, or some other ill-treatment inflicted by
masters and not by boys. The fact that Sambo never beat the richer
boys suggests that such complaints were made occasionally. But in
my own peculiar circumstances I could never have asked my parents
to intervene on my behalf. Even before I understood about the
reduced fees, I grasped that they were in some way under an
obligation to Sambo, and therefore could not protect me against
him. I have mentioned already that throughout my time at St
Cyprian's I never had a cricket bat of my own. I had been told this
was because 'your parents couldn't afford it'. One day in the
holidays, by some casual remark, it came out that they had provided
ten shillings to buy me one: yet no cricket bat appeared. I did not
protest to my parents, let alone raise the subject with Sambo. How
could I? I was dependent on him, and the ten shillings was merely a
fragment of what I owed him. I realize now, of course, that it is
immensely unlikely that Sambo had simply stuck to the money. No
doubt the matter had slipped his memory. But the point is that I
assumed that he had stuck to it, and that he had a right to do so
if he chose.</p>

<p>How difficult it is for a child to have any real independence of
attitude could be seen in our behaviour towards Flip. I think it
would be true to say that every boy in the school hated and feared
her. Yet we all fawned on her in the most abject way, and the top
layer of our feelings towards her was a sort of guilt-stricken
loyalty. Flip, although the discipline of the school depended more
on her than on Sambo, hardly pretended to dispense strict justice.
She was frankly capricious. An act which might get you a caning one
day might next day be laughed off as a boyish prank, or even
commended because it 'showed you had guts'. There were days when
everyone cowered before those deep-set, accusing eyes, and there
were days when she was like a flirtatious queen surrounded by
courtier-lovers, laughing and joking, scattering largesse, or the
promise of largesse ('And if you win the Harrow History Prize I'll
give you a new case for your camera!'), and occasionally even
packing three or four favoured boys into her Ford car and carrying
them off to a teashop in town, where they were allowed to buy
coffee and cakes. Flip was inextricably mixed up in my mind with
Queen Elizabeth, whose relations with Leicester and Essex and
Raleigh were intelligible to me from a very early age. A word we
all constantly used in speaking of Flip was 'favour'. 'I'm in good
favour;' we would say, or 'I'm in bad favour.' Except for the
handful of wealthy or titled boys, no one was permanently in good
favour, but on the other hand even the outcasts had patches of it
from time to time. Thus, although my memories of Flip are mostly
hostile, I also remember considerable periods when I basked under
her smiles, when she called me 'old chap' and used my Christian
name, and allowed me to frequent her private library, where I first
made acquaintance with <i>Vanity Fair.</i> The high-water mark of
good favour was to be invited to serve at table on Sunday nights
when Flip and Sambo had guests to dinner. In clearing away, of
course, one had a chance to finish off the scraps, but one also got
a servile pleasure from standing behind the seated guests and
darting deferentially forward when something was wanted. Whenever
one had the chance to suck up, one did suck up, and at the first
smile one's hatred turned into a sort of cringing love. I was
always tremendously proud when I succeeded in making Flip laugh. I
have even, at her command, written <i>vers d'occasion</i>, comic
verses to celebrate memorable events in the life of the school.</p>

<p>I am anxious to make it clear that I was not a rebel, except by
force of circumstances. I accepted the codes that I found in being.
Once, towards the end of my time, I even sneaked to Brown about a
suspected case of homosexuality. I did not know very well what
homosexuality was, but I knew that it happened and was bad, and
that this was one of the contexts in which it was proper to sneak.
Brown told me I was 'a good fellow', which make me feel horribly
ashamed. Before Flip one seemed as helpless as a snake before the
snake-charmer. She had a hardly-varying vocabulary of praise and
abuse, a whole series of set phrased, each of which promptly called
forth the appropriate response. There was '<i>Buck</i> up, old
chap!', which inspired one to paroxysms of energy; there was 'Don't
<i>be</i> such a fool!' (or, 'It's path<i>et</i>ic, isn't it?'),
which made one feel a born idiot; and there was 'It isn't very
straight of you, is it?', which always brought one to the brink of
tears. And yet all the while, at the middle of one's heart, there
seemed to stand an incorruptible inner self who knew that whatever
one did--whether one laughed or snivelled or went into frenzies of
gratitude for small favours--one's only true feeling was
hatred.</p>

<p><b>IV</b>
</p>

<p>I had learned early in my career that one can do wrong against
one's will, and before long I also learned that one can do wrong
without ever discovering what one has done or why it was wrong.
There were sins that were too subtle to be explained, and there
were others that were too terrible to be clearly mentioned. For
example, there was sex, which was always smouldering just under the
surface and which suddenly blew up into a tremendous row when I was
about twelve.</p>

<p>At some preparatory schools homosexuality is not a problem but I
think that St Cyprian's may have acquired a 'bad tone' thanks to
the presence of the South American boys, who would perhaps mature a
year or two earlier than an English boy. At that age I was not
interested, so I so not actually know what went on, but I imagine
it was group masturbation. At any rate, one day the storm suddenly
burst over our heads. There were summonses, interrogations,
confessions, floggings, repentances, solemn lectures of which one
understood nothing except that some irredeemable sin known as
'swinishness' or 'beastliness' had been committed. One of the
ringleaders a boy named Horne, was flogged, according to
eye-witnesses, for a quarter of an hour continuously before being
expelled. His yells rang through the house. But we were all
implicated, more or less, or felt ourselves to be implicated. Guilt
seemed to hang in the air like a pall or smoke. A solemn,
black-haired imbecile of an assistant master, who was later to be a
Member of Parliament took the older boys to a secluded room and
delivered a talk on the Temple of the Body.</p>

<p>'Don't you realize what a wonderful thing your body is?' he said
gravely. 'You talk of your motor-car engines, your Rolls-Royces and
Dainlers and so on. Don't you understand that no engine ever made
is fit to be compared with your body? And then you go and wreck it,
ruin it--for life!'</p>

<p>He turned his cavernous black eyes on me and added quite
sadly:</p>

<p>'And you, whom I'd always believed to be quite a decent person
after your fashion--you, I hear, are one of the very worst.'</p>

<p>A feeling of doom descended upon me. So I was guilty too. I too
had done the dreadful thing, whatever it was, that wrecked you for
life, body and soul, and ended in suicide or the lunatic asylum.
Till then I had hoped that I was innocent, and the conviction of
sin which now took possession of me was perhaps all the stronger
because I did not know what I had done. I was not among those who
were interrogated and flogged, and it was not until the row was
well over that I even learned about the trivial accident that had
connected my name with it. Even then I understood nothing. It was
not till about two years later that I fully grasped what that
lecture on the Temple of the Body had referred to.</p>

<p>At this time I was in an almost sexless state, which is normal,
or at any rate common, in boys of that age; I was therefore in the
position of simultaneously knowing and not knowing what used to be
called the Facts of Life. At five or six, like many children, I had
passed though a phase of sexuality. My friends were the plumber's
children up the road, and we used sometimes to play games of a
vaguely erotic kind. One was called 'playing at doctors', and I
remember getting a faint but definitely pleasant thrill from
holding a toy trumpet, which was supposed to be a stethoscope,
against a little girl's belly. About the same time I fell deeply in
love, a far more worshipping kind of love than I have ever felt for
anyone since, with a girl named Elsie at the convent school which I
attended. She seemed to me grown up, so I suppose she must have
been fifteen. After that, as so often happens, all sexual feelings
seemed to go out of me for many years. At twelve I knew more than I
had known as a young child, but I understood less, because I no
longer knew the essential fact that there is something pleasant in
sexual activity. Between roughly seven and fourteen, the whole
subject seemed to me uninteresting and, when for some reason I was
forced to think of it, disgusting. My knowledge of the so-called
Facts of Life was derived from animals, and was therefore
distorted, and in any case was only intermittent. I knew that
animals copulated and that human beings had bodies resembling those
of animals: but that human beings also copulated I only knew as it
were, reluctantly, when something, a phrase in the Bible, perhaps,
compelled me to remember it. Not having desire, I had no curiosity,
and was willing to leave many questions unanswered. Thus, I knew in
principle how the baby gets into the woman, but I did not know how
it gets out again, because I had never followed the subject up. I
knew all the dirty words, and in my bad moments I would repeat them
to myself, but I did not know what the worst of them meant, nor
want to know. They were abstractly wicked, a sort of verbal charm.
While I remained in this state, it was easy for me to remain
ignorant of any sexual misdeeds that went on about me, and to be
hardly wiser even when the row broke. At most, through the veiled
and terrible warnings of Flip, Sambo and all the rest of them, I
grasped that the crime of which we were all guiltily was somehow
connected with the sexual organs. I had noticed, without feeling
much interest, that one's penis sometimes stands up of its own
accord (this starts happening to a boy long before he has any
conscious sexual desires), and I was inclined to believe, or
half-believe, that <i>that</i> must be the crime. At any rate, it
was something to do with the penis--so much I understood. Many
other boys, I have no doubt, were equally in the dark.</p>

<p>After the talk on the Temple of the Body (days later, it seems
in retrospect: the row seemed to continue for days), a dozen of us
were seated at a long shiny table which Sambo used for the
scholarship class, under Flip's lowering eye. A long desolate wail
rang out from a room somewhere above. A very small boy named
Ronalds, aged no more than about ten, who was implicated in some
way, was being flogged, or was recovering from a flogging. At the
sound, Flip's eyes searched our faces, and settled upon me.</p>

<p>'<i>You see</i>,' she said.</p>

<p>I will not swear that she said 'You see what you have done,' but
that was the sense of it. We were all bowed down with shame. It was
<i>our</i> fault. Somehow or other we had led poor Ronalds astray:
<i>we</i> were responsible for his agony and his ruin. Then Flip
turned upon another boy named Heath. It is thirty years ago, and I
cannot remember for certain whether she merely quoted a verse from
the Bible, or whether she actually brought out a Bible and made
Heath read it; but at any rate the text indicated was: 'Who so
shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it were
better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and
that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.'</p>

<p>That, too, was terrible. Ronalds was one of these little ones,
we had offended him; it were better that millstone were hanged
about our necks and that we were drowned in the depth of the
sea.</p>

<p>'Have you thought about that, Heath--have you thought what it
means?' Flip said. And Heath broke down into snivelling tears.</p>

<p>Another boy, Beacham, whom I have mentioned already, was
similarly overwhelmed with shame by the accusation that he 'had
black rings round his eyes'.</p>

<p>'Have you looked in the glass lately, Beacham?' said Flip.
'Aren't you ashamed to go about with a face like that? Do you think
everyone doesn't know what it means when a boy has black rings
round his eyes?'</p>

<p>Once again the load of guilt and fear seemed to settle down upon
me. Had <i>I</i> got black rings round my eyes? A couple of years
later I realized that these were supposed to be a symptom by which
masturbators could be detected. But already, without knowing this,
I accepted the black rings as a sure sign of depravity, <i>some</i>
kind of depravity. And many times, even before I grasped the
supposed meaning, I have gazed anxiously into the glass, looking
for the first hint of that dreaded stigma, the confession which the
secret sinner writes upon his own face.</p>

<p>These terrors wore off, or became merely intermittent, without
affecting what one might call my official beliefs. It was still
true about the madhouse and the suicide's grave, but it was no
longer acutely frightening. Some months later it happened that I
once again saw Horne, the ringleader who had been flogged and
expelled. Horne was one of the outcasts, the son of poor
middle-class parents, which was no doubt part of the reason why
Sambo had handled him so roughly. The term after his expulsion he
went on to Eastbourne College, the small local public school, which
was hideously despised at St Cyprian's and looked on as 'not
really' a public school at all. Only a very few boys from St
Cyprian's went there, and Sambo always spoke of them with a sort of
contemptuous pity. You had no chance if you went to a school like
that: at the best your destiny would be a clerkship. I thought of
Horne as a person who at thirteen had already forfeited all hope of
any decent future. Physically, morally and socially he was
finished. Moreover I assumed that his parents had only sent him to
Eastbourne College because after his disgrace no 'good' school
would have him.</p>

<p>During the following term, when we were out for a walk, we
passed Horne in the street. He looked completely normal. He was a
strongly-built, rather good-looking boy with black hair. I
immediately noticed that he looked better than when I had last seen
him--his complexion, previously rather pale, was pinker--and that
he did not seem embarrassed at meeting us. Apparently he was not
ashamed either of having been expelled, or of being at Eastbourne
College. If one could gather anything form the way he looked at us
as we filed past, it was that he was glad to have escaped from St
Cyprian's. But the encounter made very little impression on me. I
drew no inference from the fact that Horne, ruined in body and
soul, appeared to be happy and in good health. I still believed in
the sexual mythology that had been taught me by Sambo and Flip. The
mysterious, terrible dangers were still there. Any morning the
black rings might appear round your eyes and you would know that
you too were among the lost ones. Only it no longer seemed to
matter very much. These contradictions can exist easily in the mind
of a child, because of its own vitality. It accepts--how can it do
otherwise?--the nonsense that its elders tell it, but its youthful
body, and the sweetness of the physical world, tell it another
story. It was the same with Hell, which up to the age of about
fourteen I officially believed in. Almost certainly Hell existed,
and there were occasions when a vivid sermon could scare you into
fits. But somehow it never lasted. The fire that waited for you was
real fire, it would hurt in the same way as when you burnt your
finger, and <i>for ever</i>, but most of the time you could
contemplate it without bothering.</p>

<p><b>V</b>
</p>

<p>The various codes which were presented to you at St
Cyprian's--religious, moral social and intellectual--contradicted
one another if you worked out their implications. The essential
conflict was between the tradition of nineteenth-century asceticism
and the actually existing luxury and snobbery of the pre-1914 age.
On the one side were low-church Bible Christianity, sex puritanism,
insistence on hard work, respect for academic distinction,
disapproval of self-indulgence: on the other, contempt for
'braininess', and worship of games, contempt for foreigners and the
working class, an almost neurotic dread of poverty, and, above all,
the assumption not only that money and privilege are the things
that matter, but that it is better to inherit them than to have to
work for them. Broadly, you were bidden to be at once a Christian
and a social success, which is impossible. At the time I did not
perceive that the various ideals which were set before us cancelled
out. I merely saw that they were all, or nearly all, unattainable,
so far as I was concerned, since they all depended not only on what
you did but on what you <i>were</i>.</p>

<p>Very early, at the age of only ten or eleven, I reached the
conclusion--no one told me this, but on the other hand I did not
simply make it up out of my own head: somehow it was in the air I
breathed--that you were no good unless you had £100,000. I had
perhaps fixed on this particular sum as a result of reading
Thackeray. The interest on £100,000 would be £4,000 a year (I was
in favour of a safe 4 per cent), and this seemed to me the minimum
income that you must possess if you were to belong to the real top
crust, the people in the country houses. But it was clear that I
could never find my way into that paradise, to which you did not
really belong unless you were born into it. You could only
<i>make</i> money, if at all by a mysterious operation called
'going to the city', and when you came out of the City, having won
you £100,000, you were fat and old. But the truly enviable thing
about the top-notchers was that they were rich while young. For
people like me, the ambitious middle class, the
examination-passers, only a bleak, laborious kind of success was
possible. You clambered upwards on a ladder of scholarships into
the Civil Service or the Indian Civil Service, or possibly you
became a barrister. And if at any point you 'slacked' or 'went off'
and missed one of the rungs in the ladder, you became 'a little
office boy at forty pounds a year'. But even if you climbed to the
highest niche that was open to you, you could still only be an
underling, a hanger-on of the people who really counted.</p>

<p>Even if I had not learned this from Sambo and Flip, I would have
learned it from other boys. Looking back, it is astonishing how
intimately, intelligently snobbish we all were, how knowledgeable
about names and addresses, how swift to detect small differences in
accents and manners and the cut of clothes. There were some boys
who seemed to drip money from their pores even in the bleak misery
of the middle of a winter term. At the beginning and end of the
term, especially, there was naïvely snobbish chatter about
Switzerland, and Scotland with its ghillies and grouse moors, and
'my uncle's yacht', and 'our place in the country'. And 'my pony'
and 'my pater's touring car'. There never was, I suppose, in the
history of the world a time when the sheer vulgar fatness of
wealth, without any kind of aristocratic elegance to redeem it, was
so obtrusive as in those years before 1914. It was the age when
crazy millionaires in curly top-hats and lavender waistcoats gave
champagne parties in rococo house-boats on the Thames, the age of
diabolo and hobble skirts, the age of the 'knut' in his grey bowler
and cut-away coat, the age of <i>The Merry Widow</i>, Saki's
novels, <i>Peter Pan</i> and <i>Where the Rainbow Ends</i>, the age
when people talked about chocs and cigs and ripping and topping and
heavenly, when they went for divvy week-ends at Brighton and had
scrumptious teas at the Troc. From the whole decade before 1914
there seems to breathe forth a smell of the more vulgar,
un-grown-up kind of luxury, a smell of brilliantine and
<i>crème-de-menthe</i> and soft-centred chocolates--an atmosphere,
as it were, of eating everlasting strawberry ices on green lawns to
the tune of the Eton Boating Song. The extraordinary thing was the
way in which everyone took it for granted that his oozing, bulging
wealth of the English upper and upper-middle classes would last for
ever, and was part of the order of things. After 1918 it was never
quite the same again. Snobbishness and expensive habits came back,
certainly, but they were self-conscious and on the defensive.
Before the war the worship of money was entirely unreflecting and
untroubled by any pang of conscience. The goodness of money was as
unmistakable as the goodness of health or beauty, and a glittering
car, a title or a horde of servants was mixed up in people's minds
with the idea of actual moral virtue.</p>

<p>At St Cyprian's, in term-time, the general bareness of life
enforced a certain democracy, but any mention of the holidays, and
the consequent competitive swanking about cars and butlers and
country housed, promptly called class distinctions into being. The
school was pervaded by a curious cult of Scotland, which brought
out the fundamental contradiction in our standard of values. Flip
claimed Scottish ancestry, and she favoured the Scottish boys,
encouraging them to wear kilts in their ancestral tartan instead of
the school uniform, and even christened her youngest child by a
Gaelic name. Ostensibly we were supposed to admire the Scots
because they were 'grim' and 'dour' ('stern' was perhaps the key
word), and irresistible on the field of battle. In the big
schoolroom there was a steel engraving of the charge to the Scots
Greys at Waterloo, all looking as though they enjoyed every moment
of it. Our picture of Scotland was made up of burns, braes, kilts,
sporrans, claymores, bagpipes and the like, all somehow mixed up
with the invigorating effects of porridge, Protestantism and a cold
climate. But underlying this was something quite different. The
real reason for the cult of Scotland was that only very rich people
could spend their summers there. And the pretended belief in
Scottish superiority was a cover for the bad conscience of the
occupying English, who had pushed the Highland peasantry off their
farms to make way for the deer forests, and then compensated them
by turning them into servants. Flip's face always beamed with
innocent snobbishness when she spoke of Scotland. Occasionally she
even attempted a trace of Scottish accent. Scotland was a private
paradise which a few initiates could talk about and make outsiders
feel small.</p>

<p>'You going to Scotland this hols?'</p>

<p>'Rather! We go every year.'</p>

<p>'My pater's got three miles of river.'</p>

<p>'My pater's giving me a new gun for the twelfth. There's jolly
good black game where we go. Get out, Smith! What are listening
for? You've never been to Scotland. I bet you don't know what a
blackcock looks like.'</p>

<p>Following on this, imitations of the cry of a blackcock, of the
roaring of a stag, of the accent of 'our ghillies', etc. etc.</p>

<p>And the questionings that new boys of doubtful social origin
were sometimes put through--questionings quite surprising in their
mean-minded particularity, when one reflects that the inquisitors
were only twelve or thirteen!</p>

<p>'How much a year has your pater got? What part of London do you
live in? Is that Knightsbridge or Kensington? How many bathrooms
has you house got? How many servants do your people keep? Have you
got a butler? Well, then, have you got a cook? Where do you get
your clothes made? How many shows did you go to in the hols? How
much money did you bring back with you?' etc. etc.</p>

<p>I have seen a little new boy, hardly older than eight,
desperately lying his way through such a catechism:</p>

<p>'Have your people got a car?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'What sort of car?'</p>

<p>'Daimler.'</p>

<p>'How many horse-power?'</p>

<p>(Pause, and leap in the dark.) 'Fifteen.'</p>

<p>'What kind of lights?'</p>

<p>The little boy is bewildered.</p>

<p>'What kind of lights? Electric or acetylene?'</p>

<p>(A longer pause, and another leap in the dark.) 'Acetylene.'</p>

<p>'Coo! He says his pater's car's got acetylene lamps. They went
out years ago. It must be as old as the hill.'</p>

<p>'Rot! He's making it up. He hasn't got a car. He's just a navvy.
Your pater's a navvy.'</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>By the social standards that prevailed about me, I was no good,
and could not be any good. But all the different kinds of virtue
seemed to be mysteriously interconnected and to belong to much the
same people. It was not only money that mattered: there were also
strength, beauty, charm, athleticism and something called 'guts' or
'character', which in reality meant the power to impose your will
on others. I did not possess any of these qualities. At games, for
instance, I was hopeless. I was a fairly good swimmer and not
altogether contemptible at cricket, but these had no prestige
value, because boys only attach importance to a game if it requires
strength and courage. What counted was football, at which I was a
funk. I loathed the game, and since I could see no pleasure or
usefulness in it, it was very difficult for me to show courage at
it. Football, it seemed to me, is not really played for the
pleasure of kicking a ball about, but is a species of fighting. The
lovers of football are large, boisterous, nobbly boys who are good
at knocking down and trampling on slightly smaller boys. That was
the pattern of school life--a continuous triumph of the strong over
the weak. Virtue consisted in winning: it consisted in being
bigger, stronger, handsomer, richer, more popular, more elegant,
more unscrupulous than other people--in dominating them, bullying
them, making them suffer pain, making them look foolish, getting
the better of them in every way. Life was hierarchical and whatever
happened was right. There were the strong, who deserved to win and
always did win, and there were the weak, who deserved to lose and
always did lose, everlastingly.</p>

<p>I did not question the prevailing standards, because so far as I
could see there were no others. How could the rich, the strong, the
elegant, the fashionable, the powerful, be in the wrong? It was
their world, and the rules they made for it must be the right ones.
And yet from a very early age I was aware of the impossibility of
any <i>subjective</i> conformity. Always at the centre of my heart
the inner self seemed to be awake, pointing out the difference
between the moral obligation and the psychological <i>fact.</i> It
was the same in all matters, worldly or other-worldly. Take
religion, for instance. You were supposed to love God, and I did
not question this. Till the age of about fourteen I believed in
God, and believed that the accounts given of him were true. But I
was well aware that I did not love him. On the contrary, I hated
him, just as I hated Jesus and the Hebrew patriarchs. If I had
sympathetic feelings towards any character in the Old Testament, it
was towards such people as Cain, Jezebel, Haman, Agag, Sisera: in
the New Testament my friends, if any, were Ananias, Caiaphas, Judas
and Pontius Pilate. But the whole business of religion seemed to be
strewn with psychological impossibilities. The Prayer Book told
you, for example, to love God and fear him: but how could you love
someone whom you feared? With your private affections it was the
same. What you <i>ought</i> to feel was usually clear enough but
the appropriate emotion could not be commanded. Obviously it was my
duty to feel grateful towards Flip and Sambo; but I was not
grateful. It was equally clear that one ought to love one's father,
but I knew very well that I merely disliked my own father, whom I
had barely seen before I was eight and who appeared to me simply as
a gruff-voiced elderly man forever saying 'Don't'. It was not that
one did not want to possess the right qualities or feel the correct
emotions, but that one could not. The good and the possible never
seemed to coincide.</p>

<p>There was a line of verse that I came across not actually while
I was at St Cyprian's, but a year of two later, and which seemed to
strike a sort of leaden echo in my heart. It was: 'The armies of
unalterable law'. I understood to perfection what it meant to be
Lucifer, defeated and justly defeated, with no possibility of
revenge. The schoolmasters with their canes, the millionaires with
their Scottish castles, the athletes with their curly hair--these
were the armies of unalterable law. It was not easy, at that date,
to realize that in fact it <i>was</i> alterable. And according to
that law I was damned. I had no money, I was weak, I was ugly, I
was unpopular, I had a chronic cough, I was cowardly, I smelt. This
picture, I should add, was not altogether fanciful. I was an
unattractive boy. St Cyprian's soon made me so, even if I had not
been so before. But a child's belief in its own shortcomings is not
much influenced by facts. I believed, for example, that I 'smelt'.
But this was based simply on general probability. It was notorious
that disagreeable people smelt, and therefore presumably I did so
too. Again, until after I had left school for good I continued to
believe that I was preternaturally ugly. It was what my
schoolfellows had told me, and I had no other authority to refer
to. The conviction that it was <i>not possible</i> for me to be a
success went deep enough to influence my actions till far into
adult life. Until I was about thirty I always planned my life on
the assumption not only that any major undertaking was bound to
fail, but that I could only expect to live a few years longer.</p>

<p>But this sense of guilt and inevitable failure was balanced by
something else: that is, the instinct to survive. Even a creature
that is weak, ugly, cowardly, smelly and in no way justifiable
still wants to stay alive and be happy after its own fashion. I
could not invert the existing scale of values, or turn myself into
a success, but I could accept my failure and make the best of it. I
could resign myself to being what I was, and then endeavour to
survive on those terms.</p>

<p>To survive, or at least to preserve any kind of independence,
was essentially criminal, since it meant breaking rules which you
yourself recognized. There was a boy named Johnny Hale who for some
months oppressed me horribly. He was a big, powerful, coarsely
handsome boy with a very red face and curly black hair, who was
forever twisting somebody's arm, wringing somebody's ear, flogging
somebody with a riding-crop (he was a member of the Sixth Form), or
performing prodigies of activity on the football field. Flip loved
him (hence the fact he was habitually called by his Christian name)
and Sambo commended him as a boy who 'had character' and 'could
keep order'. He was followed about by a group of toadies who
nicknamed him Strong Man.</p>

<p>One day, when we were taking off our overcoats in the
changing-room, Hale picked on me for some reason. I 'answered him
back'. Whereupon he gripped my wrist, twisted it round and bent my
forearm back upon itself in a hideously painful way. I remember his
handsome, jeering red face bearing down upon mine. He was, I think,
older than I, besides being enormously stronger. As he let go of me
a terrible, wicked resolve formed itself in my heart. I would get
back on him by hitting him when he did not expect it. It was a
strategic moment, for the master who had been 'taking' the walk
would be coming back almost immediately, and then there could be no
fight. I let perhaps a minute go by, walked up to Hale with the
most harmless air I could assume, and then, getting the weight of
my body behind it, smashed my fist into his face. He was flung
backwards by the blow, and some blood ran out of his mouth. His
always sanguine face turned almost black with rage. Then he turned
away to rinse his mouth at the wash-basins.</p>

<p>'<i>All right!</i>' he said to me between his teeth as the
master led us away.</p>

<p>For days after this he followed me about, challenging me to
fight. Although terrified out of my wits, I steadily refused to
fight. I said that the blow in the face had served him right, and
there was an end of it. Curiously enough he did not simply fall
upon me there and then, which public opinion would probably have
supported him in doing. So gradually the matter tailed off, and
there was no fight.</p>

<p>Now, I had behaved wrongly, by my own code no less than his. To
hit him unawares was wrong. But to refuse afterwards to fight
knowing that if we fought we would beat me--that was far worse: it
was cowardly. If I had refused because I disapproved of fighting,
or because I genuinely felt the matter to be closed, it would have
been all right; but I had refused merely because I was afraid. Even
my revenge was made empty by that fact. I had struck the blow in a
moment of mindless violence, deliberately not looking far ahead and
merely determined to get my own back for once and damn the
consequences. I had had time to realize that what I did was wrong,
but it was the kind of crime from which you could get some
satisfaction. Now all was nullified. There had been a sort of
courage in the first act, but my subsequent cowardice had wiped it
out.</p>

<p>The fact I hardly noticed was that though Hale formally
challenged me to fight, he did not actually attack me. Indeed,
after receiving that one blow he never oppressed me again. It was
perhaps twenty years before I saw the significance of this. At the
time I could not see beyond the moral dilemma that is presented to
the weak in a world governed by the strong: Break the rules, or
perish. I did not see that in that case the weak have the right to
make a different set of rules for themselves; because, even if such
an idea had occurred to me, there was no one in my environment who
could have confirmed me in it. I lived in a world of boys,
gregarious animals questioning nothing, accepting the law of the
stronger and avenging their own humiliations by passing them down
to someone smaller. My situation was that of countless other boys,
and if potentially I was more of a rebel than most, it was only
because, by boyish standards, I was a poorer specimen. But I never
did rebel intellectually, only emotionally. I had nothing to help
me except my dumb selfishness, my inability--not, indeed, to
despise myself, but to <i>dislike</i> myself--my instinct to
survive.</p>

<p>It was about a year after I hit Johnny Hale in the face that I
left St Cyprian's for ever. It was the end of a winter term. With a
sense of coming out from darkness into sunlight I put on my Old
Boy's tie as we dressed for the journey. I well remember the
feeling of emancipation, as though the tie had been at once a badge
of manhood and an amulet against Flip's voice and Sambo's cane. I
was escaping from bondage. It was not that I expected, or even
intended, to be any more successful at a public school than I had
been at St Cyprian's. But still, I was escaping. I knew that at a
public school there would be more privacy, more neglect, more
chance to be idle and self-indulgent and degenerate. For years I
had been resolved--unconsciously at first, but consciously later
on--that when once my scholarship was won I would 'slack off' and
cram no longer. This resolve, by the way, was so fully carried out
that between the ages of thirteen and twenty-two or three I hardly
ever did a stroke of avoidable work.</p>

<p>Flip shook hands to say good-bye. She even gave me my Christian
name for the occasion. But there was a sort of patronage, almost a
sneer, in her face and in her voice. The tone in which she said
good-bye was nearly the tone in which she had been used to say
<i>little butterflies.</i> I had won two scholarships but I was a
failure, because success was measured not by what you did but by
what you <i>were</i>. I was 'not a good type of boy' and could
bring no credit on the school. I did not possess character or
courage or health or strength or money, or even good manners, the
power to look like a gentlemen.</p>

<p>'Good-bye,' Flip's parting smile seemed to say; 'its not worth
quarrelling now. You haven't made much of a success of your time at
St Cyprian's, have you? And I don't suppose you'll get on awfully
well at a public school either. We make a mistake, really, in
wasting our time and money on you. This kind of education hasn't
much to offer to a boy with your background and your outlook. Oh,
don't think we don't understand you! We know all about those ideas
you have at the back of your head, we know you disbelieve in
everything we've taught you, and we know you aren't in the least
grateful for all we've done for you. But there's no use in bringing
it all up now. We aren't responsible for you any longer, and we
shan't be seeing you again. Let's just admit that you're one of our
failures and part without ill-feeling. And so, good-bye.'</p>

<p>That at least was what I read into her face. And yet how happy I
was, that winter morning, as the train bore me away with the
gleaming new silk tie (dark green, pale blue and black, if I
remember rightly) round my neck! The world was opening before me,
just a little, like a grey sky which exhibits a narrow crack of
blue. A public school would be better fun than St Cyprian's, but at
bottom equally alien. In a world where the prime necessities were
money, titled relatives, athleticism, tailor-made clothes,
neatly-brushed hair, a charming smile, I was no good. All I had
gained was a breathing-space. A little quietude, a little
self-indulgence, a little respite from cramming--and then, ruin.
What kind of ruin I did not know: perhaps the colonies or an office
stool, perhaps prison or an early death. But first a year or two in
which one could 'slack off' and get the benefit of one's sins, like
Doctor Faustus. I believed firmly in my evil destiny, and yet I was
acutely happy. It is the advantage of being thirteen that you can
not only live in the moment, but do so with full consciousness,
foreseeing the future and yet not caring about it Next term I was
going to Wellington. I had also won a scholarship at Eton, but it
was uncertain whether there would be a vacancy, and I was going to
Wellington first. At Eton you had a room to yourself--a room which
might even have a fire in it. At Wellington you had your own
cubicle, and could make yourself cocoa in the evenings. The privacy
of it, the grown-upness! And there would be libraries to hang about
in, and summer afternoons when you could shirk games and mooch
about the countryside alone, with no master driving you along.
Meanwhile there were the holidays. There was the 22 rifle that I
had bought the previous holidays (the Crackshot, it was called,
costing twenty-two and sixpence), and Christmas was coming next
week. There were also the pleasures of overeating. I thought of
some particularly voluptuous cream buns which could be bought for
twopence each at a shop in our town. (This was 1916, and
food-rationing had not yet started.) Even the detail that my
journey-money had been slightly miscalculated, leaving about a
shilling over--enough for an unforeseen cup of coffee and a cake or
two somewhere on the way--was enough to fill me with bliss. There
was time for a bit of happiness before the future closed in upon
me. But I did know that the future was dark. Failure, failure,
failure--failure behind me, failure ahead of me--that was by far
the deepest conviction that I carried away.</p>

<p><b>VI</b>
</p>

<p>All this was thirty years ago and more. The question is: Does a
child at school go through the same kind of experiences
nowadays?</p>

<p>The only honest answer, I believe, is that we do not with
certainty know. Of course it is obvious that the present-day
<i>attitude</i> towards education is enormously more humane and
sensible than that of the past. The snobbishness that was an
integral part of my own education would be almost unthinkable
today, because the society that nourished it is dead. I recall a
conversation that must have taken place about a year before I left
St Cyprian's. A Russian boy, large and fair-haired, a year older
than myself, was questioning me.</p>

<p>'How much a year has your father got?'</p>

<p>I told him what I thought it was, adding a few hundreds to make
it sound better. The Russian boy, neat in his habits, produced a
pencil and a small note-book and made a calculation.</p>

<p>'My father has over two hundred times as much money as yours,'
he announced with a sort of amused contempt.</p>

<p>That was in 1915. What happened to that money a couple of years
later, I wonder? And still more I wonder, do conversations of that
kind happen at preparatory schools now?</p>

<p>Clearly there has been a vast change of outlook, a general
growth of 'enlightenment', even among ordinary, unthinking
middle-class people. Religious belief, for instance, has largely
vanished, dragging other kinds of nonsense after it. I imagine that
very few people nowadays would tell a child that if it masturbates
it will end in the lunatic asylum. Beating, too, has become
discredited, and has even been abandoned at many schools. Nor is
the underfeeding of children looked on as a normal, almost
meritorious act. No one now would openly set out to give his pupils
as little food as they could do with, or tell them that it is
healthy to get up from a meal as hungry as you sat down. The whole
status of children has improved, partly because they have grown
relatively less numerous. And the diffusion of even a little
psychological knowledge has made it harder for parents and
schoolteachers to indulge their aberrations in the name of
discipline. Here is a case, not known to me personally, but known
to some one I can vouch for, and happening within my own lifetime.
A small girl, daughter of a clergyman, continued wetting her bed at
an age when she should have grown out of it. In order to punish her
for this dreadful deed, her father took her to a large garden party
and there introduced her to the whole company as a little girl who
wetted her bed: and to underline her wickedness he had previously
painted her face black. I do not suggest that Flip and Sambo would
actually have done a thing like this, but I doubt whether it would
have much surprised them. After all, things do change. And
yet--!</p>

<p>The question is not whether boys are still buckled into Eton
collars on Sunday, or told that babies are dug up under gooseberry
bushes. That kind of thing is at an end, admittedly. The real
question is whether it is still normal for a school child to live
for years amid irrational terrors and lunatic misunderstandings.
And here one is up against the very great difficulty of knowing
what a child really feels and thinks. A child which appears
reasonably happy may actually be suffering horrors which it cannot
or will not reveal. It lives in a sort of alien under-water world
which we can only penetrate by memory or divination. Our chief clue
is the fact that we were once children ourselves, and many people
appear to forget the atmosphere of their own childhood almost
entirely. Think for instance of the unnecessary torments that
people will inflict by sending a child back to school with clothes
to the wrong pattern, and refusing to see that this matters! Over
things of this kind a child will sometimes utter a protest, but a
great deal of the time its attitude is one of simple concealment.
Not to expose your true feelings to an adult seems to be
instinctive from the age of seven or eight onwards. Even the
affection that one feels for a child, the desire to protect and
cherish it, is a cause of misunderstanding. One can love a child,
perhaps, more deeply than one can love another adult, but it is
rash to assume that the child feels any love in return. Looking
back on my own childhood, after the infant years were over, I do
not believe that I ever felt love for any mature person, except my
mother, and even her I did not trust, in the sense that shyness
made me conceal most of my real feelings from her. Love, the
spontaneous, unqualified emotion of love, was something I could
only feel for people who were young. Towards people who were
old--and remember that 'old' to a child means over thirty, or even
over twenty-five--I could feel reverence respect, admiration or
compunction, but I seemed cut off from them by a veil of fear and
shyness mixed up with physical distaste. People are too ready to
forget the child's <i>physical</i> shrinking from the adult. The
enormous size of grown-ups, their ungainly, rigid bodies, their
coarse, wrinkled skins, their great relaxed eyelids, their yellow
teeth, and the whiffs of musty clothes and beer and sweat and
tobacco that disengage from them at every movement! Part of the
reason for the ugliness of adults, in a child's eyes, is that the
child is usually looking upwards, and few faces are at their best
when seen from below. Besides, being fresh and unmarked itself, the
child has impossibly high standards in the matter of skin and teeth
and complexion. But the greatest barrier of all is the child's
misconception about age. A child can hardly envisage life beyond
thirty, and in judging people's ages it will make fantastic
mistakes. It will think that a person of twenty-five is forty, that
a person of forty is sixty-five, and so on. Thus, when I fell in
love with Elsie I took her to be grown-up. I met her again, when I
was thirteen and she, I think, must have been twenty-three; she now
seemed to me a middle-aged woman, somewhat past her best. And the
child thinks of growing old as an almost obscene calamity, which
for some mysterious reason will never happen to itself. All who
have passed the age of thirty are joyless grotesques, endlessly
fussing about things of no importance and staying alive without so
far as the child can see, having anything to live for. Only child
life is real life. The schoolmaster who imagines that he is loved
and trusted by his boys is in fact mimicked and laughed at behind
his back. An adult who does not seem dangerous nearly always seems
ridiculous.</p>

<p>I base these generalizations on what I can recall of my own
childhood out look. Treacherous though memory is, it seems to me
the chief means we have of discovering how a child's mind works.
Only by resurrecting our own memories can we realize how incredibly
distorted is the child's vision of the world. Consider this, for
example. How would St Cyprian's appear to me now, if I could go
back, at my present age, and see it as it was in 1915? What should
I think of Sambo and Flip, those terrible, all-powerful monsters? I
should see them as a couple of silly, shallow, ineffectual people,
eagerly clambering up a social ladder which any thinking person
could see to be on the point of collapse. I would no more be
frightened of them than I would be frightened of a dormouse.
Moreover, in those days they seemed to me fantastically old,
whereas--though of this I am not certain--I imagine they must have
been somewhat younger than I am now. And how would Johnny Hale
appear with his blacksmith's arms and his red, jeering face? Merely
a scruffy little boy, barely distinguishable from hundreds of other
scruffy little boys. The two sets of facts can lie side by side in
my mind, because those happen to be my own memories. But it would
be very difficult for me to see with the eyes of any other child,
except by an effort of the imagination which might lead me
completely astray. The child and the adult live in different
worlds. If that is so, we cannot be certain that school, at any
rate boarding school, is not still for many children as dreadful an
experience as it used to be. Take away God, Latin, the cane, class
distinctions and sexual taboos, and the fear, the hatred, the
snobbery and the misunderstanding might still all be there. It will
have been seen that my own main trouble was an utter lack of any
sense of proportion or probability. This led me to accept outrages
and believe absurdities, and to suffer torments over things which
were in fact of no importance. It is not enough to say that I was
'silly' and 'ought to have known better'. Look back into your own
childhood and think of the nonsense you used to believe and the
trivialities which could make you suffer. Of course my own case had
its individual variations, but essentially it was that of countless
other boys. The weakness of the child is that it starts with a
blank sheet. It neither understands nor questions the society in
which it lives, and because of its credulity other people can work
upon it, infecting it with the sense of inferiority and the dread
of offending against mysterious, terrible laws. It may be that
everything that happened to me at St Cyprian's could happen in the
most 'enlightened' school, though perhaps in subtler forms. Of one
thing, however, I do feel fairly sure, and that is that boarding
schools are worse than day schools. A child has a better chance
with the sanctuary of its home near at hand. And I think the
characteristic faults of the English upper and middle classes may
be partly due to the practice, general until recently, of sending
children away from home as young as nine, eight or even seven.</p>

<p>I have never been back to St Cyprian's. Reunions, old boys'
dinners and such-like leave me something more than cold, even when
my memories are friendly. I have never even been down to Eton,
where I was relatively happy, though I did once pass through it in
1933 and noted with interest that nothing seemed to have changed,
except that the shops now sold radios. As for St Cyprian's, for
years I loathed its very name so deeply that I could not view it
with enough detachment to see the significance of the things that
happened to me there. In a way it is only within the last decade
that I have really thought over my schooldays, vividly though their
memory has always haunted me. Nowadays, I believe, it would make
very little impression on me to see the place again, if it still
exists. (I remember hearing a rumour some years ago that it had
been burnt down.) If I had to pass through Eastbourn I would not
make a detour to avoid the school: and if I happened to pass the
school itself I might even stop for a moment by the low brick wall,
with the steep bank running down from it, and look across the flat
playing field at the ugly building with the square of asphalt in
front of it. And if I went inside and smelt again the inky, dusty
smell of the big schoolroom, the rosiny smell of the chapel, the
stagnant smell of the swimming bath and the cold reek of the
lavatories, I think I should only feel what one invariably feels in
revisiting any scene of childhood: How small everything has grown,
and how terrible is the deterioration in myself! But it is a fact
that for many years I could hardly have borne to look at it again.
Except upon dire necessity I would not have set foot in Eastbourne.
I even conceived a prejudice against Sussex, as the country that
contained St Cyprian's, and as an adult I have only once been in
Sussex, on a short visit. Now, however, the place is out of my
system for good. Its magic works no longer, and I have not even
enough animosity left to make me hope that Flip and Sambo are dead
or that the story of the school being burnt down was true.</p>

<h2>WRITERS AND LEVIATHAN (1948)</h2>

<p>The position of the writer in an age of State control is a
subject that has already been fairly largely discussed, although
most of the evidence that might be relevant is not yet available.
In this place I do not want to express an opinion either for or
against State patronage of the arts, but merely to point out that
WHAT KIND of State rules over us must depend partly on the
prevailing intellectual atmosphere: meaning, in this context,
partly on the attitude of writers and artists themselves, and on
their willingness or otherwise to keep the spirit of liberalism
alive. If we find ourselves in ten years' time cringing before
somebody like Zhdanov, it will probably be because that is what we
have deserved. Obviously there are strong tendencies towards
totalitarianism at work within the English literary intelligentsia
already. But here I am not concerned with any organised and
conscious movement such as Communism, but merely with the effect,
on people of goodwill, of political thinking and the need to take
sides politically.</p>

<p>This is a political age. War, Fascism, concentration camps,
rubber truncheons, atomic bombs, etc are what we daily think about,
and therefore to a great extent what we write about, even when we
do not name them openly. We cannot help this. When you are on a
sinking ship, your thoughts will be about sinking ships. But not
only is our subject-matter narrowed, but our whole attitude towards
literature is coloured by loyalties which we at least
intermittently realise to be non-literary. I often have the feeling
that even at the best of times literary criticism is fraudulent,
since in the absence of any accepted standards whatever&mdash;any
EXTERNAL reference which can give meaning to the statement that
such and such a book is "good" or "bad"&mdash;every literary
judgement consists in trumping up a set of rules to justify an
instinctive preference. One's real reaction to a book, when one has
a reaction at all, is usually "I like this book" or "I don't like
it", and what follows is a rationalisation. But "I like this book"
is not, I think, a non-literary reaction; the non-literary reaction
is "This book is on my side, and therefore I must discover merits
in it". Of course, when one praises a book for political reasons
one may be emotionally sincere, in the sense that one does feel
strong approval of it, but also it often happens that party
solidarity demands a plain lie. Anyone used to reviewing books for
political periodicals is well aware of this. In general, if you are
writing for a paper that you are in agreement with, you sin by
commission, and if for a paper of the opposite stamp, by omission.
At any rate, innumerable controversial books-books for or against
Soviet Russia, for or against Zionism, for or against the Catholic
Church, etc&mdash;are judged before they are read, and in effect
before they are written. One knows in advance what reception they
will get in what papers. And yet, with a dishonesty that sometimes
is not even quarter-conscious, the pretence is kept up that
genuinely literary standards are being applied.</p>

<p>Of course, the invasion of literature by politics was bound to
happen. It must have happened, even if the special problem of
totalitarianism had never arisen, because we have developed a sort
of compunction which our grandparents did not have, an awareness of
the enormous injustice and misery of the world, and a
guilt-stricken feeling that one ought to be doing something about
it, which makes a purely aesthetic attitude towards life
impossible. No one, now, could devote himself to literature as
single-mindedly as Joyce or Henry James. But unfortunately, to
accept political responsibility now means yielding oneself over to
orthodoxies and "party lines", with all the timidity and dishonesty
that that implies. As against the Victorian writers, we have the
disadvantage of living among clear-cut political ideologies and of
usually knowing at a glance what thoughts are heretical. A modern
literary intellectual lives and writes in constant dread&mdash;not,
indeed, of public opinion in the wider sense, but of public opinion
within his own group. As a rule, luckily, there is more than one
group, but also at any given moment there is a dominant orthodoxy,
to offend against which needs a thick skin and sometimes means
cutting one's income in half for years on end. Obviously, for about
fifteen years past, the dominant orthodoxy, especially among the
young, has been "left". The key words are "progressive",
"democratic" and "revolutionary", while the labels which you must
at all costs avoid having gummed upon you are "bourgeois",
"reactionary" and "Fascist". Almost everyone nowadays, even the
majority of Catholics and Conservatives, is "progressive", or at
least wishes to be thought so. No one, so far as I know, ever
describes himself as a "bourgeois", just as no one literate enough
to have heard the word ever admits to being guilty of antisemitism.
We are all of us good democrats, anti-Fascist, anti-imperialist,
contemptuous of class distinctions, impervious to colour prejudice,
and so on and so forth. Nor is there much doubt that the
present-day "left" orthodoxy is better than the rather snobbish,
pietistic Conservative orthodoxy which prevailed twenty years ago,
when the CRITERION and (on a lower level) the LONDON MERCURY were
the dominant literary magazines. For at the least its implied
objective is a viable form of society which large numbers of people
actually want. But it also has its own falsities which, because
they cannot be admitted, make it impossible for certain questions
to be seriously discussed.</p>

<p>The whole left-wing ideology, scientific and Utopian, was
evolved by people who had no immediate prospect of attaining power.
It was, therefore, an extremist ideology, utterly contemptuous of
kings, governments, laws, prisons, police forces, armies, flags,
frontiers, patriotism, religion, conventional morality, and, in
fact, the whole existing scheme of things. Until well within living
memory the forces of the Left in all countries were fighting
against a tyranny which appeared to be invincible, and it was easy
to assume that if only THAT particular
tyranny&mdash;capitalism&mdash;could be overthrown, Socialism would
follow. Moreover, the Left had inherited from Liberalism certain
distinctly questionable beliefs, such as the belief that the truth
will prevail and persecution defeats itself, or that man is
naturally good and is only corrupted by his environment. This
perfectionist ideology has persisted in nearly all of us, and it is
in the name of it that we protest when (for instance) a Labour
government votes huge incomes to the King's daughters or shows
hesitation about nationalising steel. But we have also accumulated
in our minds a whole series of unadmitted contradictions, as a
result of successive bumps against reality.</p>

<p>The first big bump was the Russian Revolution. For somewhat
complex reasons, nearly the whole of the English Left has been
driven to accept the Russian régime as "Socialist", while silently
recognising that its spirit and practice are quite alien to
anything that is meant by "Socialism" in this country. Hence there
has arisen a sort of schizophrenic manner of thinking, in which
words like "democracy" can bear two irreconcilable meanings, and
such things as concentration camps and mass deportations can be
right and wrong simultaneously. The next blow to the left-wing
ideology was the rise of Fascism, which shook the pacifism and
internationalism of the Left without bringing about a definite
restatement of doctrine. The experience of German occupation taught
the European peoples something that the colonial peoples knew
already, namely, that class antagonisms are not all-important and
that there is such a thing as national interest. After Hitler it
was difficult to maintain seriously that "the enemy is in your own
country" and that national independence is of no value. But though
we all know this and act upon it when necessary, we still feel that
to say it aloud would be a kind of treachery. And finally, the
greatest difficulty of all, there is the fact that the Left is now
in power and is obliged to take responsibility and make genuine
decisions.</p>

<p>Left governments almost invariably disappoint their supporters
because, even when the prosperity which they have promised is
achievable, there is always need of an uncomfortable transition
period about which little has been said beforehand. At this moment
we see our own Government, in its desperate economic straits,
fighting in effect against its own past propaganda. The crisis that
we are now in is not a sudden unexpected calamity, like an
earthquake, and it was not caused by the war, but merely hastened
by it. Decades ago it could be foreseen that something of this kind
was going to happen. Ever since the nineteenth century our national
income, dependent partly on interest from foreign investments, and
on assured markets and cheap raw materials in colonial countries,
had been extremely precarious. It was certain that, sooner or
later, something would go wrong and we should be forced to make our
exports balance our imports: and when that happened the British
standard of living, including the working-class standard, was bound
to fall, at least temporarily. Yet the left-wing parties, even when
they were vociferously anti-imperialist, never made these facts
clear. On occasion they were ready to admit that the British
workers had benefited, to some extent, by the looting of Asia and
Africa, but they always allowed it to appear that we could give up
our loot and yet in some way contrive to remain prosperous. Quite
largely, indeed, the workers were won over to Socialism by being
told that they were exploited, whereas the brute truth was that, in
world terms, they were exploiters. Now, to all appearances, the
point has been reached when the working-class living-standard
CANNOT be maintained, let alone raised. Even if we squeeze the rich
out of existence, the mass of the people must either consume less
or produce more. Or am I exaggerating the mess we are in? I may be,
and I should be glad to find myself mistaken. But the point I wish
to make is that this question, among people who are faithful to the
Left ideology, cannot be genuinely discussed. The lowering of wages
and raising of working hours are felt to be inherently
anti-Socialist measures, and must therefore be dismissed in
advance, whatever the economic situation may be. To suggest that
they may be unavoidable is merely to risk being plastered with
those labels that we are all terrified of. It is far safer to evade
the issue and pretend that we can put everything right by
redistributing the existing national income.</p>

<p>To accept an orthodoxy is always to inherit unresolved
contradictions. Take for instance the fact that all sensitive
people are revolted by industrialism and its products, and yet are
aware that the conquest of poverty and the emancipation of the
working class demand not less industrialisation, but more and more.
Or take the fact that certain jobs are absolutely necessary and yet
are never done except under some kind of coercion. Or take the fact
that it is impossible to have a positive foreign policy without
having powerful armed forces. One could multiply examples. In every
such case there is a conclusion which is perfectly plain but which
can only be drawn if one is privately disloyal to the official
ideology. The normal response is to push the question, unanswered,
into a corner of one's mind, and then continue repeating
contradictory catchwords. One does not have to search far through
the reviews and magazines to discover the effects of this kind of
thinking.</p>

<p>I am not, of course, suggesting that mental dishonesty is
peculiar to Socialists and left-wingers generally, or is commonest
among them. It is merely that acceptance of ANY political
discipline seems to be incompatible with literary integrity. This
applies equally to movements like Pacifism and Personalism, which
claim to be outside the ordinary political struggle. Indeed, the
mere sound of words ending in '-ism' seems to bring with it the
smell of propaganda. Group loyalties are necessary, and yet they
are poisonous to literature, so long as literature is the product
of individuals. As soon as they are allowed to have any influence,
even a negative one, on creative writing, the result is not only
falsification, but often the actual drying-up of the inventive
faculties.</p>

<p>Well, then what? Do we have to conclude that it is the duty of
every writer to "keep out of politics"? Certainly not! In any case,
as I have said already, no thinking person can or does genuinely
keep out of politics, in an age like the present one. I only
suggest that we should draw a sharper distinction than we do at
present between our political and our literary loyalties, and
should recognise that a willingness to DO certain distasteful but
necessary things does not carry with it any obligation to swallow
the beliefs that usually go with them. When a writer engages in
politics he should do so as a citizen, as a human being, but not AS
A WRITER. I do not think that he has the right, merely on the score
of his sensibilities, to shirk the ordinary dirty work of politics.
Just as much as anyone else, he should be prepared to deliver
lectures in draughty halls, to chalk pavements, to canvass voters,
to distribute leaflets, even to fight in civil wars if it seems
necessary. But whatever else he does in the service of his party,
he should never write for it. He should make it clear that his
writing is a thing apart. And he should be able to act
co-operatively while, if he chooses, completely rejecting the
official ideology. He should never turn back from a train of
thought because it may lead to a heresy, and he should not mind
very much if his unorthodoxy is smelt out, as it probably will be.
Perhaps it is even a bad sign in a writer if he is not suspected of
reactionary tendencies today, just as it was a bad sign if he was
not suspected of Communist sympathies twenty years ago.</p>

<p>But does all this mean that a writer should not only refuse to
be dictated to by political bosses, but also that he should refrain
from writing ABOUT politics? Once again, certainly not! There is no
reason why he should not write in the most crudely political way,
if he wishes to. Only he should do so as an individual, an
outsider, at the most an unwelcome guerrilla on the flank of a
regular army. This attitude is quite compatible with ordinary
political usefulness. It is reasonable, for example, to be willing
to fight in a war because one thinks the war ought to be won, and
at the same time to refuse to write war propaganda. Sometimes, if a
writer is honest, his writings and his political activities may
actually contradict one another. There are occasions when that is
plainly undesirable: but then the remedy is not to falsify one's
impulses, but to remain silent.</p>

<p>To suggest that a creative writer, in a time of conflict, must
split his life into two compartments, may seem defeatist or
frivolous: yet in practice I do not see what else he can do. To
lock yourself up in an ivory tower is impossible and undesirable.
To yield subjectively, not merely to a party machine, but even to a
group ideology, is to destroy yourself as a writer. We feel this
dilemma to be a painful one, because we see the need of engaging in
politics while also seeing what a dirty, degrading business it is.
And most of us still have a lingering belief that every choice,
even every political choice, is between good and evil, and that if
a thing is necessary it is also right. We should, I think, get rid
of this belief, which belongs to the nursery. In politics one can
never do more than decide which of two evils is the lesser, and
there are some situations from which one can only escape by acting
like a devil or a lunatic. War, for example, may be necessary, but
it is certainly not right or sane. Even a General Election is not
exactly a pleasant or edifying spectacle. If you have to take part
in such things&mdash;and I think you do have to, unless you are
armoured by old age or stupidity or hypocrisy&mdash;then you also
have to keep part of yourself inviolate. For most people the
problem does not arise in the same form, because their lives are
split already. They are truly alive only in their leisure hours,
and there is no emotional connection between their work and their
political activities. Nor are they generally asked, in the name of
political loyalty, to debase themselves as workers. The artist, and
especially the writer, is asked just that&mdash;in fact, it is the
only thing that Politicians ever ask of him. If he refuses, that
does not mean that he is condemned to inactivity. One half of him,
which in a sense is the whole of him, can act as resolutely, even
as violently if need be, as anyone else. But his writings, in so
far as they have any value, will always be the product of the saner
self that stands aside, records the things that are done and admits
their necessity, but refuses to be deceived as to their true
nature.</p>

<h2>REFLECTIONS ON GANDHI</h2>

<p>Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved
innocent, but the tests that have to be applied to them are not, of
course, the same in all cases. In Gandhi's case the questions one
feels inclined to ask are: to what extent was Gandhi moved by
vanity&mdash;by the consciousness of himself as a humble, naked old
man, sitting on a praying mat and shaking empires by sheer
spiritual power&mdash;and to what extent did he compromise his own
principles by entering politics, which of their nature are
inseparable from coercion and fraud? To give a definite answer one
would have to study Gandhi's acts and writings in immense detail,
for his whole life was a sort of pilgrimage in which every act was
significant. But this partial autobiography, which ends in the
nineteen-twenties, is strong evidence in his favor, all the more
because it covers what he would have called the unregenerate part
of his life and reminds one that inside the saint, or near-saint,
there was a very shrewd, able person who could, if he had chosen,
have been a brilliant success as a lawyer, an administrator or
perhaps even a businessman.</p>

<p>At about the time when the autobiography first appeared I
remember reading its opening chapters in the ill-printed pages of
some Indian newspaper. They made a good impression on me, which
Gandhi himself at that time did not. The things that one associated
with him&mdash;home-spun cloth, "soul forces" and
vegetarianism&mdash;were unappealing, and his medievalist program
was obviously not viable in a backward, starving, over-populated
country. It was also apparent that the British were making use of
him, or thought they were making use of him. Strictly speaking, as
a Nationalist, he was an enemy, but since in every crisis he would
exert himself to prevent violence&mdash;which, from the British
point of view, meant preventing any effective action
whatever&mdash;he could be regarded as "our man". In private this
was sometimes cynically admitted. The attitude of the Indian
millionaires was similar. Gandhi called upon them to repent, and
naturally they preferred him to the Socialists and Communists who,
given the chance, would actually have taken their money away. How
reliable such calculations are in the long run is doubtful; as
Gandhi himself says, "in the end deceivers deceive only
themselves"; but at any rate the gentleness with which he was
nearly always handled was due partly to the feeling that he was
useful. The British Conservatives only became really angry with him
when, as in 1942, he was in effect turning his non-violence against
a different conqueror.</p>

<p>But I could see even then that the British officials who spoke
of him with a mixture of amusement and disapproval also genuinely
liked and admired him, after a fashion. Nobody ever suggested that
he was corrupt, or ambitious in any vulgar way, or that anything he
did was actuated by fear or malice. In judging a man like Gandhi
one seems instinctively to apply high standards, so that some of
his virtues have passed almost unnoticed. For instance, it is clear
even from the autobiography that his natural physical courage was
quite outstanding: the manner of his death was a later illustration
of this, for a public man who attached any value to his own skin
would have been more adequately guarded. Again, he seems to have
been quite free from that maniacal suspiciousness which, as E.M.
Forster rightly says in A PASSAGE TO INDIA, is the besetting Indian
vice, as hypocrisy is the British vice. Although no doubt he was
shrewd enough in detecting dishonesty, he seems wherever possible
to have believed that other people were acting in good faith and
had a better nature through which they could be approached. And
though he came of a poor middle-class family, started life rather
unfavorably, and was probably of unimpressive physical appearance,
he was not afflicted by envy or by the feeling of inferiority.
Color feeling when he first met it in its worst form in South
Africa, seems rather to have astonished him. Even when he was
fighting what was in effect a color war, he did not think of people
in terms of race or status. The governor of a province, a cotton
millionaire, a half-starved Dravidian coolie, a British private
soldier were all equally human beings, to be approached in much the
same way. It is noticeable that even in the worst possible
circumstances, as in South Africa when he was making himself
unpopular as the champion of the Indian community, he did not lack
European friends.</p>

<p>Written in short lengths for newspaper serialization, the
autobiography is not a literary masterpiece, but it is the more
impressive because of the commonplaceness of much of its material.
It is well to be reminded that Gandhi started out with the normal
ambitions of a young Indian student and only adopted his extremist
opinions by degrees and, in some cases, rather unwillingly. There
was a time, it is interesting to learn, when he wore a top hat,
took dancing lessons, studied French and Latin, went up the Eiffel
Tower and even tried to learn the violin&mdash;all this was the
idea of assimilating European civilization as thoroughly as
possible. He was not one of those saints who are marked out by
their phenomenal piety from childhood onwards, nor one of the other
kind who forsake the world after sensational debaucheries. He makes
full confession of the misdeeds of his youth, but in fact there is
not much to confess. As a frontispiece to the book there is a
photograph of Gandhi's possessions at the time of his death. The
whole outfit could be purchased for about 5 pounds, and Gandhi's
sins, at least his fleshly sins, would make the same sort of
appearance if placed all in one heap. A few cigarettes, a few
mouthfuls of meat, a few annas pilfered in childhood from the
maidservant, two visits to a brothel (on each occasion he got away
without "doing anything"), one narrowly escaped lapse with his
landlady in Plymouth, one outburst of temper&mdash;that is about
the whole collection. Almost from childhood onwards he had a deep
earnestness, an attitude ethical rather than religious, but, until
he was about thirty, no very definite sense of direction. His first
entry into anything describable as public life was made by way of
vegetarianism. Underneath his less ordinary qualities one feels all
the time the solid middle-class businessmen who were his ancestors.
One feels that even after he had abandoned personal ambition he
must have been a resourceful, energetic lawyer and a hard-headed
political organizer, careful in keeping down expenses, an adroit
handler of committees and an indefatigable chaser of subscriptions.
His character was an extraordinarily mixed one, but there was
almost nothing in it that you can put your finger on and call bad,
and I believe that even Gandhi's worst enemies would admit that he
was an interesting and unusual man who enriched the world simply by
being alive. Whether he was also a lovable man, and whether his
teachings can have much for those who do not accept the religious
beliefs on which they are founded, I have never felt fully
certain.</p>

<p>Of late years it has been the fashion to talk about Gandhi as
though he were not only sympathetic to the Western Left-wing
movement, but were integrally part of it. Anarchists and pacifists,
in particular, have claimed him for their own, noticing only that
he was opposed to centralism and State violence and ignoring the
other-worldly, anti-humanist tendency of his doctrines. But one
should, I think, realize that Gandhi's teachings cannot be squared
with the belief that Man is the measure of all things and that our
job is to make life worth living on this earth, which is the only
earth we have. They make sense only on the assumption that God
exists and that the world of solid objects is an illusion to be
escaped from. It is worth considering the disciplines which Gandhi
imposed on himself and which&mdash;though he might not insist on
every one of his followers observing every detail&mdash;he
considered indispensable if one wanted to serve either God or
humanity. First of all, no meat-eating, and if possible no animal
food in any form. (Gandhi himself, for the sake of his health, had
to compromise on milk, but seems to have felt this to be a
backsliding.) No alcohol or tobacco, and no spices or condiments
even of a vegetable kind, since food should be taken not for its
own sake but solely in order to preserve one's strength. Secondly,
if possible, no sexual intercourse. If sexual intercourse must
happen, then it should be for the sole purpose of begetting
children and presumably at long intervals. Gandhi himself, in his
middle thirties, took the vow of BRAMAHCHARYA, which means not only
complete chastity but the elimination of sexual desire. This
condition, it seems, is difficult to attain without a special diet
and frequent fasting. One of the dangers of milk-drinking is that
it is apt to arouse sexual desire. And finally this is the cardinal
point&mdash;for the seeker after goodness there must be no close
friendships and no exclusive loves whatever.</p>

<p>Close friendships, Gandhi says, are dangerous, because "friends
react on one another" and through loyalty to a friend one can be
led into wrong-doing. This is unquestionably true. Moreover, if one
is to love God, or to love humanity as a whole, one cannot give
one's preference to any individual person. This again is true, and
it marks the point at which the humanistic and the religious
attitude cease to be reconcilable. To an ordinary human being, love
means nothing if it does not mean loving some people more than
others. The autobiography leaves it uncertain whether Gandhi
behaved in an inconsiderate way to his wife and children, but at
any rate it makes clear that on three occasions he was willing to
let his wife or a child die rather than administer the animal food
prescribed by the doctor. It is true that the threatened death
never actually occurred, and also that Gandhi&mdash;with, one
gathers, a good deal of moral pressure in the opposite
direction&mdash;always gave the patient the choice of staying alive
at the price of committing a sin: still, if the decision had been
solely his own, he would have forbidden the animal food, whatever
the risks might be. There must, he says, be some limit to what we
will do in order to remain alive, and the limit is well on this
side of chicken broth. This attitude is perhaps a noble one, but,
in the sense which&mdash;I think&mdash;most people would give to
the word, it is inhuman. The essence of being human is that one
does not seek perfection, that one is sometimes willing to commit
sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not push asceticism to
the point where it makes friendly intercourse impossible, and that
one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life,
which is the inevitable price of fastening one's love upon other
human individuals. No doubt alcohol, tobacco, and so forth, are
things that a saint must avoid, but sainthood is also a thing that
human beings must avoid. There is an obvious retort to this, but
one should be wary about making it. In this yogi-ridden age, it is
too readily assumed that "non-attachment" is not only better than a
full acceptance of earthly life, but that the ordinary man only
rejects it because it is too difficult: in other words, that the
average human being is a failed saint. It is doubtful whether this
is true. Many people genuinely do not wish to be saints, and it is
probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never
felt much temptation to be human beings. If one could follow it to
its psychological roots, one would, I believe, find that the main
motive for "non-attachment" is a desire to escape from the pain of
living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is
hard work. But it is not necessary here to argue whether the
other-worldly or the humanistic ideal is "higher". The point is
that they are incompatible. One must choose between God and Man,
and all "radicals" and "progressives", from the mildest Liberal to
the most extreme Anarchist, have in effect chosen Man.</p>

<p>However, Gandhi's pacifism can be separated to some extent from
his other teachings. Its motive was religious, but he claimed also
for it that it was a definitive technique, a method, capable of
producing desired political results. Gandhi's attitude was not that
of most Western pacifists. SATYAGRAHA, first evolved in South
Africa, was a sort of non-violent warfare, a way of defeating the
enemy without hurting him and without feeling or arousing hatred.
It entailed such things as civil disobedience, strikes, lying down
in front of railway trains, enduring police charges without running
away and without hitting back, and the like. Gandhi objected to
"passive resistance" as a translation of SATYAGRAHA: in Gujarati,
it seems, the word means "firmness in the truth". In his early days
Gandhi served as a stretcher-bearer on the British side in the Boer
War, and he was prepared to do the same again in the war of
1914-18. Even after he had completely abjured violence he was
honest enough to see that in war it is usually necessary to take
sides. He did not&mdash;indeed, since his whole political life
centred round a struggle for national independence, he could
not&mdash;take the sterile and dishonest line of pretending that in
every war both sides are exactly the same and it makes no
difference who wins. Nor did he, like most Western pacifists,
specialize in avoiding awkward questions. In relation to the late
war, one question that every pacifist had a clear obligation to
answer was: "What about the Jews? Are you prepared to see them
exterminated? If not, how do you propose to save them without
resorting to war?" I must say that I have never heard, from any
Western pacifist, an honest answer to this question, though I have
heard plenty of evasions, usually of the "you're another" type. But
it so happens that Gandhi was asked a somewhat similar question in
1938 and that his answer is on record in Mr. Louis Fischer's GANDHI
AND STALIN. According to Mr. Fischer, Gandhi's view was that the
German Jews ought to commit collective suicide, which "would have
aroused the world and the people of Germany to Hitler's violence."
After the war he justified himself: the Jews had been killed
anyway, and might as well have died significantly. One has the
impression that this attitude staggered even so warm an admirer as
Mr. Fischer, but Gandhi was merely being honest. If you are not
prepared to take life, you must often be prepared for lives to be
lost in some other way. When, in 1942, he urged non-violent
resistance against a Japanese invasion, he was ready to admit that
it might cost several million deaths.</p>

<p>At the same time there is reason to think that Gandhi, who after
all was born in 1869, did not understand the nature of
totalitarianism and saw everything in terms of his own struggle
against the British government. The important point here is not so
much that the British treated him forbearingly as that he was
always able to command publicity. As can be seen from the phrase
quoted above, he believed in "arousing the world", which is only
possible if the world gets a chance to hear what you are doing. It
is difficult to see how Gandhi's methods could be applied in a
country where opponents of the régime disappear in the middle of
the night and are never heard of again. Without a free press and
the right of assembly, it is impossible not merely to appeal to
outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even
to make your intentions known to your adversary. Is there a Gandhi
in Russia at this moment? And if there is, what is he
accomplishing? The Russian masses could only practise civil
disobedience if the same idea happened to occur to all of them
simultaneously, and even then, to judge by the history of the
Ukraine famine, it would make no difference. But let it be granted
that non-violent resistance can be effective against one's own
government, or against an occupying power: even so, how does one
put it into practise internationally? Gandhi's various conflicting
statements on the late war seem to show that he felt the difficulty
of this. Applied to foreign politics, pacifism either stops being
pacifist or becomes appeasement. Moreover the assumption, which
served Gandhi so well in dealing with individuals, that all human
beings are more or less approachable and will respond to a generous
gesture, needs to be seriously questioned. It is not necessarily
true, for example, when you are dealing with lunatics. Then the
question becomes: Who is sane? Was Hitler sane? And is it not
possible for one whole culture to be insane by the standards of
another? And, so far as one can gauge the feelings of whole
nations, is there any apparent connection between a generous deed
and a friendly response? Is gratitude a factor in international
politics?</p>

<p>These and kindred questions need discussion, and need it
urgently, in the few years left to us before somebody presses the
button and the rockets begin to fly. It seems doubtful whether
civilization can stand another major war, and it is at least
thinkable that the way out lies through non-violence. It is
Gandhi's virtue that he would have been ready to give honest
consideration to the kind of question that I have raised above;
and, indeed, he probably did discuss most of these questions
somewhere or other in his innumerable newspaper articles. One feels
of him that there was much he did not understand, but not that
there was anything that he was frightened of saying or thinking. I
have never been able to feel much liking for Gandhi, but I do not
feel sure that as a political thinker he was wrong in the main, nor
do I believe that his life was a failure. It is curious that when
he was assassinated, many of his warmest admirers exclaimed
sorrowfully that he had lived just long enough to see his life work
in ruins, because India was engaged in a civil war which had always
been foreseen as one of the byproducts of the transfer of power.
But it was not in trying to smooth down Hindu-Moslem rivalry that
Gandhi had spent his life. His main political objective, the
peaceful ending of British rule, had after all been attained. As
usual the relevant facts cut across one another. On the other hand,
the British did get out of India without fighting, and event which
very few observers indeed would have predicted until about a year
before it happened. On the other hand, this was done by a Labour
government, and it is certain that a Conservative government,
especially a government headed by Churchill, would have acted
differently. But if, by 1945, there had grown up in Britain a large
body of opinion sympathetic to Indian independence, how far was
this due to Gandhi's personal influence? And if, as may happen,
India and Britain finally settle down into a decent and friendly
relationship, will this be partly because Gandhi, by keeping up his
struggle obstinately and without hatred, disinfected the political
air? That one even thinks of asking such questions indicates his
stature. One may feel, as I do, a sort of aesthetic distaste for
Gandhi, one may reject the claims of sainthood made on his behalf
(he never made any such claim himself, by the way), one may also
reject sainthood as an ideal and therefore feel that Gandhi's basic
aims were anti-human and reactionary: but regarded simply as a
politician, and compared with the other leading political figures
of our time, how clean a smell he has managed to leave behind!</p>
