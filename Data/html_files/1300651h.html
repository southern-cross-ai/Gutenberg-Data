     name="ch1"><small>CHAPTER I</small></a><br>
  <br>
  TELLS OF A DOOR AJAR AND OF<br>
  A LAD WHO STOOD BEHIND IT</h2>

  <p class="first">I had never need to keep any record either of the date or
  place. It was the fifteenth night of July, in the year 1758, and the place
  was Lieutenant Clutterbuck's lodging at the south corner of Burleigh Street,
  Strand. The night was tropical in its heat, and though every window stood
  open to the Thames, there was not a man, I think, who did not long for the
  cool relief of morning, or step out from time to time on to the balcony and
  search the dark profundity of sky for the first flecks of grey. I cannot be
  positive about the entire disposition of the room: but certainly Lieutenant
  Clutterbuck was playing at ninepins down the middle with half a dozen
  decanters and a couple of silver salvers; and Mr. Macfarlane, a young
  gentleman of a Scottish regiment, was practising a game of his own.</p>

  <p>He carried the fire-irons and Lieutenant Clutterbuck's sword under his
  arm, and walked solidly about the floor after a little paper ball rolled up
  out of a news sheet, which he hit with one of these instruments, selecting
  now the poker, now the tongs or the sword with great deliberation, and
  explaining his selection with even greater earnestness; there was besides a
  great deal of noise, which seemed to be a quality of the room rather than the
  utterance of any particular person; and I have a clear recollection that
  everything, from the candles to the glasses on the tables and the broken
  tobacco pipes on the floor, was of a dazzling and intolerable brightness.
  This brightness distressed me particularly, because just opposite to where I
  sat a large mirror hung upon the wall between two windows. On each side was a
  velvet hollow of gloom, in the middle this glittering oval. Every ray of
  light within the room seemed to converge upon its surface. I could not but
  look at it&mdash;for it did not occur to me to move away to another
  chair&mdash;and it annoyed me exceedingly. Besides, the mirror was inclined
  forward from the wall, and so threw straight down at me a reflection of
  Lieutenant Clutterbuck's guests, as they flung about the room beneath it.</p>

  <p>Thus I saw a throng of flushed young exuberant faces, and in the
  background, continually peeping between them, my own, very white and drawn
  and thin and a million years old. That, too, annoyed me very much, and then
  by a sheer miracle, as it seemed to me, the mirror splintered and cracked and
  dropped in fragments on to the floor, until there was only hanging on the
  wall the upper rim, a thin curve of glass like a bright sickle. I remember
  that the noise and hurley-burley suddenly ceased, as though morning had come
  unawares upon a witches' carnival and that all the men present stood like
  statues and appeared to stare at me. Lieutenant Clutterbuck broke the
  silence, or rather tore it, with a great loud laugh which crumpled up his
  face. He said something about "Old Steve Berkeley," and smacked his hand upon
  my shoulder, and shouted for another glass, which he filled and placed at my
  elbow, for my own had disappeared.</p>

  <p>I had no time to drink from it, however, for just as I was raising it to
  my lips Mr. Macfarlane's paper ball dropped from the ceiling into the
  liquor.</p>

  <p>"Bunkered, by God!" cried Mr. Macfarlane, amidst a shout of laughter.</p>

  <p>I looked at Macfarlane with some reserve.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," I began.</p>

  <p>"Don't move, man!" cried he, as he forced me back into my chair, and
  dropping the fire-irons with a clatter on to the floor, he tried to scoop the
  ball out of the glass with the point of Clutterbuck's sword-sheath. He missed
  the glass; the sheath caught me full on the knuckles; I opened my hand
  and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Sir, you have ruined my game," said Mr. Macfarlane, with considerable
  heat.</p>

  <p>"And a good thing too," said I, "for a sillier game I never saw in all my
  life."</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," cried Lieutenant Clutterbuck, though he did not articulate
  the word with his customary precision; but his intentions were undoubtedly
  pacific. He happened to be holding the last of his decanters in his hand, and
  he swung it to and fro. "Gentlemen," he repeated, and as if to keep me
  company, he let the decanter slip out of his hand. It fell on the floor and
  split with a loud noise. "Well," said he, solemnly, "I have dropped a
  brooch," and he fumbled at his cravat.</p>

  <p>Another peal of laughter went up; and while it was still ringing, a
  man&mdash;what his name was I cannot remember, even if I ever knew it; I saw
  him for the first time that evening, and I have only once seen him since, but
  he was certainly&mdash;more sober than the rest&mdash;stooped over my chair
  and caught me by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Steve," said he, with a chuckle,&mdash;and from this familiarity to a new
  acquaintance I judge he was not so sober after all,&mdash;"do you notice the
  door?"</p>

  <p>The door was in the corner of the room to my right. I looked towards it:
  the brass handle shone like a gold ball in the sun. I looked back at my
  companion, and, shaking my arm free, I replied coldly:</p>

  <p>"I see it. It is a door, a mere door. But I do not notice it. It is not
  indeed noteworthy."</p>

  <p>"It is unlatched," said my acquaintance, with another chuckle.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is not the only door in the world in that predicament."</p>

  <p>"But it was latched a moment ago," and with his forefinger he gently poked
  me in the ribs.</p>

  <p>"Then someone has turned the handle," said I, drawing myself away.</p>

  <p>"A most ingenious theory," said he, quite unabashed by my reserve, "and
  the truth. Someone <i>has</i> turned the handle. Now who?" He winked with an
  extreme significance. "My dear sir, who?"</p>

  <p>I looked round the room. Mr. Macfarlane had resumed his game. Two
  gentlemen in a corner through all the din were earnestly playing putt with
  the cards. They had, however, removed their wigs, and their shaven heads
  gleamed unpleasantly. Others by the window were vociferating the chorus of a
  drinking song. Lieutenant Clutterbuck alone was near to the door. I was on
  the point of pronouncing his name when he lurched towards it, and instantly
  the door was closed.</p>

  <p>"It was someone outside," said I.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. Steve, you are not so devoid of sense as your friends would
  have me believe," continued my companion. "Now, who will be Lieutenant
  Clutterbuck's timorous visitor?" He drew his watch from his fob: "We may
  hazard a guess at the sex, I think, but for the rest&mdash;&mdash; Is it some
  fine lady from St. James's who has come in her chair at half-past one of the
  morning to keep an appointment which her careless courtier has
  forgotten?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly," I returned. "For your fine lady would hurry back to her chair
  with all the speed her petticoats allowed. She would not stay behind the
  door, which, I see, has again been opened."</p>

  <p>The familiar stranger laid his hand upon my shoulder and held me back in
  my chair at arm's length from him.</p>

  <p>"They do you wrong, my dear Steve," said he, gravely, "who say your brains
  are addled with drink. Your"&mdash;his tongue stumbled over a long word which
  I judged to be "ratiocination"&mdash;"is admirable. Never was logician more
  precise. It is not a fine lady from St. James's. It will be a flower-girl
  from Drury Lane, and may I be eternally as drunk as I am to-night, if we do
  not have her into the room."</p>

  <p>With that he crossed the room, and seizing the handle suddenly swung the
  door open. The next instant he stepped back. The door was in a line with the
  wall against which my chair was placed, and besides it opened towards me so
  that I could not see what it was that so amazed him.</p>

  <p>"Here's the strangest flower-girl from Drury Lane that ever I saw," said
  he, and Lieutenant Clutterbuck turning about cried:</p>

  <p>"By all that's wonderful, it's Dick Parmiter," and a lad of fifteen years,
  with a red fisherman's bonnet upon his head and a blue jersey on his back,
  stepped hesitatingly into the room.</p>

  <p>"Well, Dick, what's the news from Scilly?" continued Clutterbuck. "And
  what's brought you to London? Have you come to see the king in his golden
  crown? Has Captain Hathaway lost his <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> and sent you to
  town to buy him another? Come, out with it!"</p>

  <p>Dick shifted from one foot to another; he took his cap from his head and
  twisted it in his hands; and he looked from one to another of Lieutenant
  Clutterbuck's guests who had now crowded about the lad and were plying him
  with questions. But he did not answer the questions. No doubt the noise and
  the lights, and the presence of these glittering gentlemen confused the lad,
  who was more used to the lonely beaches of the islands and the companionable
  murmurs of the sea. At last he plucked up the courage to say, with a glance
  of appeal to Lieutenant Clutterbuck:</p>

  <p>"I have news to tell, but I would sooner tell it to you alone."</p>

  <p>His appeal was received with a chorus of protestations, and "Where are
  your manners, Dick," cried Clutterbuck, "that you tell my friends flat to
  their faces they cannot keep a secret?"</p>

  <p>"Are we women?" asked Mr. Macfarlane.</p>

  <p>"Out with your story," cried another.</p>

  <p>Dick Parmiter shrank back and turned his eyes towards the door, but one
  man shut it to and leaned his shoulders against the panels, while the others
  caught at the lad's hesitation as at a new game, and crowded about him as
  though he was some rare curiosity brought by a traveller from outlandish
  parts.</p>

  <p>"He shall tell his story," cried Clutterbuck. "It is two years since I was
  stationed at the Scilly Islands, two years since I dined in the mess-room of
  Star Castle with Captain Hathaway of his Majesty's Invalids, and was bored to
  death with his dissertations on <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>. Two years! The boy
  must have news of consequence. There is no doubt trouble with the cray fish,
  or Adam Mayle has broken the head of the collector of the Customs
  House&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Adam Mayle is dead. He was struck down by paralysis and never moved till
  he died," interrupted Dick Parmiter.</p>

  <p>The news sobered Clutterbuck for an instant. "Dead!" said he, gaping at
  the boy. "Dead!" he repeated, and so flung back to his noise and laughter,
  though there was a ring of savagery in it very strange to his friends. "Well,
  more brandy will pay revenue, and fewer ships will come ashore, and very like
  there'll be quiet upon Tresco&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," interrupted Parmiter again, and Clutterbuck turned upon him with a
  flush of rage.</p>

  <p>"Well, tell your story and have done with it!"</p>

  <p>"To you," said the boy, looking from one to other of the faces about
  him.</p>

  <p>"No, to all," cried Clutterbuck. The drink, and a certain anger of which
  we did not know the source, made him obstinate. "You shall tell it to us all,
  or not at all. Bring that table, forward, Macfarlane! You shall stand on the
  table Dick, like a preacher in his pulpit," he sneered, "and put all the fine
  gentlemen to shame, with a story of the rustic virtues."</p>

  <p>The table was dragged from the corner into the middle of the room. The boy
  protested, and made for the door. But he was thrust back, seized and lifted
  struggling on to the table, where he was set upon his feet.</p>

  <p>"Harmony, gentlemen, harmony!" cried Clutterbuck, flapping his hand upon
  the mantelshelf. "Take your seats, and no whispering in the side boxes, if
  you please. For I can promise you a play which needs no prologue to excuse
  it."</p>

  <p>It was a company in which a small jest passed easily for a high stroke of
  wit. They applauded Lieutenant Clutterbuck's sally, and drew up their chairs
  round the table and sat looking upwards towards the boy, with a great
  expectation of amusement, just as people watch a bear-baiting at a fair. For
  my part I had not moved, and it was no doubt for that reason that Parmiter
  looked for help towards me.</p>

  <p>"When all's said, Clutterbuck," I began, "you and your friends are a pack
  of bullies. The boy's a good boy, devil take me if he isn't."</p>

  <p>The boy upon the table looked his gratitude for the small mercy of my
  ineffectual plea, and I should have proceeded to enlarge upon it had I not
  noticed a very astonishing thing. For Parmiter lifted his arm high up above
  his head as thought to impress upon me his gratitude, and his arm lengthened
  out and grew until it touched the ceiling. Then it dwindled and shrank until
  again it was no more than a boy's arm on a boy's shoulder. I was so struck
  with this curious phenomenon that I broke off my protest on his behalf, and
  mentioned to those about me what I had seen, asking whether they had remarked
  it too, and inquiring to what cause, whither of health or malady, they were
  disposed to attribute so sudden a growth and contraction.</p>

  <p>However, Lieutenant Clutterbuck's guests were only disposed that night to
  make light of any subject however important or scientific. For some laughed
  in my face, others more polite, shrugged their shoulders with a smile, and
  the stranger who had spoken to me before clapped his hand in the small of my
  back as I leaned forward, and shouted some ill-bred word that, though might
  he die of small-pox if he had ever met me before, he would have known me from
  a thousand by the tales he had heard. However, before I could answer him
  fitly, and indeed, while I was still pondering the meaning of his words.
  Lieutenant Clutterbuck clapped his hands for silence, and Dick Parmiter,
  seeing no longer any hope of succour, perforce began to tell his story.</p>

  <p>It was a story of a youth that sat in the stocks of a Sunday morning and
  disappeared thereafter from the islands; of a girl named Helen; of a negro
  who slept and slept, and of men watching a house with a great tangled garden
  that stood at the edge of the sea. Cullen Mayle, Parmiter called the youth
  who had sat in the stocks, son to that Adam whose death had so taken
  Lieutenant Clutterbuck with surprise. But I could not make head or tail of
  the business. For one thing I have always been very fond of flowers, and
  quite unaccountably the polished floor of the room blossomed into a parterre
  of roses, so that my attention was distracted by this curious and pleasing
  event.</p>

  <p>For another, Parmiter's story was continually interrupted by intricate
  questions intended to confuse him, his evident anxiety was made the occasion
  of much amusement by those seated about the table, and he was induced on one
  excuse and another to go back to the beginning again and again and relate
  once more what he had already told. But I remember that he spoke with a high
  intonation, and rather quickly and with a broad accent, and that even then I
  was extremely sensible of the unfamiliar parts from which he came. His words
  seemed to have preserved a smell of the sea, and through them I seemed to
  hear very clearly the sound of waves breaking upon a remote beach&mdash;near
  in a word to that granite house with the tangled garden where the men watched
  and watched.</p>

  <p>Then the boy's story ceased, and the next thing I heard was a sound of
  sobbing. I looked up, and there was Dick Parmiter upon the table, crying like
  a child. Over against him sat Lieutenant Clutterbuck, with a face sour and
  dark.</p>

  <p>"I'll not stir a foot or lift a finger," said he, swearing an oath, "no,
  not if God comes down and bids me."</p>

  <p>And upon that the boy weakened of a sudden, swayed for an instant upon his
  feet, and dropped in a huddle upon the table. His swoon put every one to
  shame except Clutterbuck; everyone busied himself about the boy, dabbing his
  forehead with wet handkerchiefs, and spilling brandy over his face in
  attempts to pour it into his mouth&mdash;every one except Clutterbuck, who
  never moved nor changed in a single line of his face, from his fixed
  expression of anger. Dick Parmiter recovered from his swoon and sat up: and
  his first look was towards the lieutenant, whose face softened for an instant
  with I know not what memories of days under the sun in a fishing boat amongst
  the islands.</p>

  <p>"Dick, you are over&mdash;tired. It's a long road from the Scillies to
  London. Very like, too, you are hungry," and Dick nodded "yes" to each
  sentence. "Well, Dick, you shall eat here, if there's any food in my larder,
  and you shall sleep here when you have eaten."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" asked Parmiter, simply, and Clutterbuck's face turned hard
  again as a stone.</p>

  <p>"Every word," said he.</p>

  <p>The boy slipped off the table and began to search on the ground. His cap
  had fallen from his hand when he fell down in his swoon. He picked it up from
  beneath a chair. He did not look any more at Clutterbuck; he made no appeal
  to anyone in the room; but though his legs still faltered from weakness, he
  walked silently out of the door, and in a little we heard his footsteps upon
  the stone stairs and the banisters creaking, as though he clung to them,
  while he descended, for support.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Clutterbuck!" cried Macfarlane "he's but a boy."</p>

  <p>"With no roof to his head," said another.</p>

  <p>"And fainting for lack of a meal," said a third.</p>

  <p>"He shall have both," I cried, "if he will take them from me," and I ran
  out of the door.</p>

  <p>"Dick," I cried down the hollow of the staircase, "Dick Parmiter," but no
  answer was returned, save my own cry coming back to me up the well of the
  stairs. Clutterbuck's rooms were on the highest floor of the house; the stone
  stairs stretched downwards flight after flight beneath me. There was no sound
  anywhere upon them; the boy had gone. I came back to the room. Lieutenant
  Clutterbuck sat quite still in his chair. The morning was breaking; a cold
  livid light crept through the open windows, touched his hands, reached his
  face and turned it white.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," he said, without so much as a look.</p>

  <p>His eyes were bent upon memories to which we had no clue. We left him
  sitting thus and went down into the street, when we parted. I saw no roses
  blossoming in the streets as I walked home, but as I looked in my mirror at
  my lodging I noticed again that my face was drawn and haggard and a million
  years old.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"

  <br>
  DICK PARMITER'S STORY</h2>

  <p class="first">I woke up at mid-day, and lay for awhile in my bed
  anticipating wearily the eight limping hours to come before the evening fell,
  and wondering how I might best escape them. From that debate my thoughts
  drifted to the events of the night before, and I recollected with a sudden
  thrill of interest, rare enough to surprise me, the coming of Dick Parmiter,
  and his treatment at Clutterbuck's hands and his departure. I thought of his
  long journey to London along strange roads. I could see him tramping the
  dusty miles, each step leading him farther from that small corner of the
  world with which alone he was familiar. I imagined him now sleeping beneath a
  hedge, now perhaps, by some rare fortune, in one of Russell's waggons with
  the Falmouth mails, which at nightfall he had overtaken, and from which at
  daybreak he would descend with a hurried word of thanks to get the quicker on
  his way; I pictured him pressing through the towns with a growing fear at his
  heart, because of their turmoil and their crowds; and I thought of him as
  hungering daily more and more for the sea which he had left behind, like a
  sheep-dog which one has taken from the sheep and shut up within the walls of
  a city. The boy's spirit appealed to me. It was new, it was admirable; and I
  dressed that day with an uncommon alertness and got me out to Clutterbuck's
  lodgings.</p>

  <p>I found the lieutenant in bed with a tankard of small ale at his bedside.
  He looked me over with astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could carry my liquor as well as you do," said he, taking a pull
  at the tankard.</p>

  <p>"Has the boy come back?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"What, Dick?" said he. "No, nor will not." And changing the subject, "If
  you will wait, Steve, I will make a shift to get up."</p>

  <p>I went into his parlour. The room had been put into some sort of order;
  but the shattered remnant of the mirror still hung between the windows, and
  it too spoke to me of Dick's journey. I imagined him coming to the great city
  at the fall of night, and seeking out his way through its alleys and streets
  to Lieutenant Clutterbuck's lodgings. I could see him on the stairs pausing
  to listen to the confusion within the rooms, and in the passage opening and
  closing the door as he hesitated whether to go in or no. I became all at once
  very curious to know what the errand was which had pushed him so far from his
  home, and I cudgelled my brains to recollect his story. But I could remember
  only the youth Cullen Mayle, who had sat in the stocks on a Sunday morning,
  and the girl Helen, and a negro who slept and slept, and a house with a
  desolate tangled garden by the sea, and men watching the house. But what
  bound these people and the house in a common history, as to that I was
  entirely in the dark.</p>

  <p>"Steve," said Clutterbuck&mdash;I had not remarked his entrance&mdash;"you
  look glum as a November morning. Is it a sore head? or is it the sight of
  your mischievous handiwork?" and he pointed to the mirror.</p>

  <p>"It's neither one nor the other," said I. "It's just the recollection of
  that boy fumbling under the table for his cap, and dragging himself silently
  out of the room, with all England to tramp and despair to sustain him."</p>

  <p>"That boy!" cried Clutterbuck, with great exasperation. "Curse you,
  Berkeley. That boy's a maggot, and has crept into your brains. We'll talk no
  more of him, if you please." He took a pack of cards from a corner cupboard,
  and, tossing them on the table, "Here, choose your game I'll play what you
  will, and for what stakes you will, so long as you hold your tongue."</p>

  <p>It was plain that I should learn nothing by pressing my curiosity upon
  him. I must go another way to work. But chance and Lieutenant Clutterbuck
  served my turn without any provocation from myself.</p>

  <p>I chose the game of picquet, and Clutterbuck shuffled and cut the cards;
  whereupon I dealt them. Clutterbuck looked at his hand fretfully, and then
  cried out:</p>

  <p>"I have no hand for picquet, but I have very good putt cards."</p>

  <p>I glanced through the cards I held.</p>

  <p>"Make it putt, then," said I. "I will wager what you will my hand is the
  better;" and Clutterbuck broke into a laugh and tossed his cards upon the
  table.</p>

  <p>"You have two kings and an ace," said he, "I know very well; but I have
  two kings and a deuce, and mine are the better."</p>

  <p>"It is a bite," said I.</p>

  <p>"And an ingenious one," he returned. "It was Cullen Mayle who taught it to
  us in the mess at Star Castle. For packing the cards or knapping the dice I
  never came across his equal. Yet we could never detect him, and in the end
  not a soul in the garrison would play with him for crooked pins."</p>

  <p>"Cullen Mayle," said I; "that was Adam's son."</p>

  <p>Clutterbuck had sunk into something of a reverie, and spoke rather to
  himself than to me.</p>

  <p>"They were the strangest pair," he continued; "you would never take them
  for father and son, and I myself was always amazed to think there was any
  relationship between them. I have seen them sitting side by side on the
  settle in the kitchen of the 'Palace Inn' at Tresco. Adam, an old bulky
  fellow, with a mulberry face and yellow angry eyes, and his great hands and
  feet twisted out of all belief. His stories were all of wild doings on the
  Guinea coast. Cullen, on the other hand, was a stripling with a soft face
  like a girl's, exquisite in his dress, urbane in his manners. He had a gentle
  word and an attentive ear for each newcomer to the fire, and a white
  protesting hand for the oaths with which Adam salted his speech. Yet they
  were both of the same vindictive, turbulent spirit, only Cullen was the more
  dangerous.</p>

  <p>"I have watched the gannets often through an afternoon in Hell Bay over at
  Brehar. They would circle high up in the air where no fish could see them,
  and then slant their wings and drop giddily with the splash of a stone upon
  their prey. They always put me in mind of Cullen Mayle. He struck mighty
  quick and out of the sky. I cannot remember, during all the ten years I lived
  at the Scillies, that any man crossed Cullen Mayle, though unwittingly, but
  some odd accident crippled him. He was the more dangerous of the pair. With
  Adam it was a word and a blow. With Cullen a word and another and another,
  and all of them soft, and the blow held over for a secret occasion. But it
  fell. If ever you come across Cullen Mayle, Berkeley, take care of your words
  and your deeds, for he strikes out of the sky and mighty quick."</p>

  <p>This Clutterbuck said with an extreme earnestness, leaning forward to me
  as he spoke. And even now I can but put it down to his earnestness that a
  shiver took me at the words; for nothing was more unlikely than that I should
  ever come to grips with Cullen Mayle, and the next moment I answered
  Clutterbuck lightly.</p>

  <p>"Yet he sat in the stocks in the end," said I, with as much indifference
  as I could counterfeit; for I was afraid lest any display of eagerness might
  close his lips. Lieutenant Clutterbuck, however, was hardly aware that he was
  being questioned. He laughed with a certain pleasure.</p>

  <p>"Yes. A schooner, with a cargo of brandy, came ashore on Tresco. Cullen
  and the Tresco men saved the cargo and hid it away, and when the collector
  came over with his men from the Customs House upon St. Mary's, Cullen drove
  him back to his boats with a broken head. Cullen broke old Captain Hathaway's
  patience at the same time. Hathaway took off his silver spectacles at last
  and shut up his <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> with a bang; and so Cullen Mayle sat
  in the stocks before the Customs House on the Sunday morning. He left the
  islands that night. That was two years and a month ago."</p>

  <p>"And what had Dick Parmiter to do with Cullen Mayle?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Dick?" said he. "Oh, Dick was Cullen Mayle's henchman. But it seems that
  Dick has transferred his allegiance to&mdash;&mdash;" And he stopped
  abruptly. His face soured as he stopped.</p>

  <p>"To the girl Helen?" said I, quite forgetting my indifference.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" cried Clutterbuck, savagely, "to the girl Helen. He is fifteen
  years old is Dick. But at fifteen years a lad is ripe to be one of Cupid's
  April fools." And after that he would say no more.</p>

  <p>His last words, however, and, more than his words, the tone in which he
  spoke, had given me the first definite clue of the many for which my
  curiosity searched. It was certainly on behalf of the girl, whom I only knew
  as Helen, that Dick had undertaken his arduous errand, and it was no less
  certain that just for that reason Lieutenant Clutterbuck had refused to
  meddle in the matter. I recognised that I should get no advantage from
  persisting, but I kept close to his side that day waiting upon
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>We dined together at Locket's, by Charing Cross; we walked together to the
  "Cocoa Tree" in St. James's Street, and passed an hour or so with a dice-box.
  Clutterbuck was very silent for the most part. He handled the dice-box with
  indifference; and, since he was never the man to keep his thoughts for any
  long time to himself, I had no doubt that some time that day I should learn
  more. Indeed, very soon after we left the "Cocoa Tree" I thought the whole
  truth was coming out; for he stopped in St. James's Park, close to the Mall,
  which at that moment was quiet and deserted. We could hear a light wind
  rippling through the leaves of the poplars, and a faint rumble of carriages
  lurching over the stones of Pall Mall.</p>

  <p>"It is very like the sound of the sea on a still morning of summer," said
  he, looking at me with a vacant eye, and I wondered whether he was thinking
  of a tangled garden raised above a beach of sand, wherein, maybe, he had
  walked, and not alone on some such day as this two years ago.</p>

  <p>We crossed the water to the Spring Gardens at Vauxhall, where we supped. I
  was now fallen into as complete a silence and abstraction as Clutterbuck
  himself, for I was clean lost in conjectures, I knew something now of Adam
  Mayle and his son Cullen, but as to Helen I was in the dark. Was her name
  Mayle too? Was she wife to Cullen? The sight of Clutterbuck's ill-humour
  inclined me to that conjecture; but I was wrong, for as the attendants were
  putting out the lights in the garden I ventured upon the question. To my
  surprise, Clutterbuck answered me with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said he, "you are the most pertinacious fellow. What's come to
  you, who were content to drink your liquor and sit on one side while the
  world went by? No, she was not wife to Cullen Mayle, nor sister. She was a
  waif of the sea. Adam Mayle picked her up from the rocks a long while since.
  It was the only action that could be counted to his credit since he came out
  of nowhere and leased the granite house of Tresco. A barque&mdash;a Venetian
  vessel, it was thought, from Marseilles, in France, for a great deal of
  Castile soap, and almonds and oil was washed ashore afterwards&mdash;drove in
  a northwesterly gale on to the Golden Bar reef. The reef runs out from St.
  Helen's Island, opposite Adam Mayle's window. Adam put out his lugger and
  crossed the sound, but before he could reach St. Helen's the ship went down
  into fourteen fathoms of water. He landed on St. Helen's, however, and
  amongst the rocks where the reef joins the land he came across a sailor, who
  lay in the posture of death, and yet wailed like a hungry child. The sailor
  was dead, but within his jacket, buttoned up on his breast, was a child of
  four years or so. Adam took her home. No one ever claimed her, so he kept
  her, and called her Helen from the island on which she was wrecked. That was
  a long time since, for the girl must be twenty."</p>

  <p>"Is she French?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"French, or Venetian, or Spanish, or what you will," he cried. "It matters
  very little what country a woman springs from. I have no doubt that a
  Hottentot squaw will play you the same tricks as a woman of fashion, and with
  as demure a countenance. Well, it seems we are to go to bed sober;" and we
  went each to his lodging.</p>

  <p>For my part, I lay awake for a long time, seeking to weave into some sort
  of continuous story what I had heard that day from Lieutenant Clutterbuck and
  the scraps which I remembered of Parmiter's talk. But old Adam Mayle, who was
  dead; Cullen, the gannet who struck from the skies; and even Helen, the waif
  of the sea&mdash;these were at this time no more to me than a showman's
  puppets; marionettes of sawdust and wood, that faced this way and that way
  according as I pulled the strings. The one being who had life was the boy
  Parmiter, with his jersey and his red fisherman's bonnet; and I very soon
  turned to conjecturing how he fared upon his journey.</p>

  <p>Had he money to help him forward? Had he fallen in with a kindly carrier?
  How far had he travelled? I had no doubt that, whether he had money or no, he
  would reach his journey's end. His spirit was evident in the resolve to
  travel to London, in his success, and in the concealment of any weakness
  until the favour he asked for had been refused.</p>

  <p>I bought next morning one of the new maps of the Great West Road and began
  to pick off the stages of his journey. This was the second day since he had
  started. He would not travel very fast, having no good news to lighten his
  feet. I reckoned that he would have reached the "Golden Farmer," and I made a
  mark at that name on the map. Every day for a week I kept in this way an
  imagined tally of his progress, following him from county to county; and at
  the end of the week, coming out in the evening from my lodging at the corner
  of St. James's Street, I ran plump into the arms of the gentleman I had met
  at Clutterbuck's, and whose name I did not know. But his familiarity was all
  gone from him. He bowed to me stiffly, and would have passed on, but I caught
  him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Sir," said I, "you will remember a certain night when I had the honour of
  your acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Berkeley," he returned with a smile, "I remember very much better the
  dreadful morning which followed it."</p>

  <p>"You will not, at all events, have forgotten the boy whom you discovered
  outside the door, and if you can repeat the story which he told, or some
  portion of it, I shall be obliged to you."</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I have still half an hour to spare," said he; and he led the way to the
  "Groom Porters." The night was young, but not so young but what the
  Bassett-table was already full. We sat down together in a dark corner of the
  room, and my companion told me what he remembered of Parmiter's story.</p>

  <p>It appeared that Cullen Mayle had quarrelled with his father on that
  Sunday night after he had sat in the stocks and had left the house. He had
  never returned. A year ago Adam Mayle had died, bequeathing his fortune,
  which was considerable, and most of it placed in the African Company, to his
  adopted daughter Helen. She, however, declared that she had no right to it,
  that it was not hers, and that she would hold it in trust until such time as
  Cullen should come back to claim it.</p>

  <p>He did not come back, as has been said; but eight months later Dick
  Parmiter, on an occasion when he had crossed in his father's fishing boat to
  Cornwall, had discovered upon Penzance Quay a small crowd of loiterers, and
  on the ground amongst them, with his back propped against a wall, a negro
  asleep. A paper was being passed from hand to hand among the group, and in
  the end it came to Dick Parmiter. Upon the paper was written Adam Mayle's
  name and the place of his residence, Tresco, in the Scilly Islands; and Dick
  at once recognised that the writing was in Cullen Mayle's hand. He pushed to
  the front of the group, and stooping down, shook the negro by the shoulder.
  The negro drowsily opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You come from Mr. Cullen Mayle?" said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the negro, speaking in English and quite clearly.</p>

  <p>"You have a message from him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Dick; and he put a number of questions eagerly. But in
  the midst of them, and while still looking at Dick, the negro closed his eyes
  deliberately and fell asleep.</p>

  <p>"See," cried a sailor, an oldish white-haired man, with a French accent;
  "that is the way with him. He came aboard with us at the port of London as
  wide awake as you or I. Bound for Penzance he was, and the drowsiness took
  him the second day out. At first he would talk a little; but each day he
  slept more and more, until now he will say no more than a 'Yes' or a 'No.'
  Why, he will fall asleep over his dinner."</p>

  <p>Dick shook the negro again.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to cross to Tresco?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the negro.</p>

  <p>Dick carried him back to Scilly and brought him to the house on Tresco,
  where Helen Mayle now lived alone. But no news could be got from him. He
  would answer "Yes" or "No" and eat his meals; but when it came to a question
  of his message or Cullen Mayle's whereabouts he closed his eyes and fell
  asleep. Helen judged that somewhere Cullen was in great need and distress,
  and because she held his money, and could do nothing to succour him, she was
  thrown into an extreme trouble. There was some reason why he could not come
  to Scilly in person, and here at her hand was the man sent to tell the
  reason; but he could not because of his mysterious malady. More than once he
  tried with a look of deep sadness in his eyes, as though he was conscious of
  his helplessness, but he never got beyond the first word. His eyelids closed
  while his mouth was still open to speak, and at once he was asleep. His
  presence made a great noise amongst the islands; from Brehar, from St.
  Mary's, and from St. Martin's the people sailed over to look at him. But
  Helen, knowing Cullen Mayle and fearing the nature of his misadventure, had
  bidden Parmiter to let slip no hint that he had come on Cullen's account.</p>

  <p>So the negro stayed at Tresco and spread a great gloom throughout the
  house. They watched him day by day as he slept. Cullen's need might be
  immediate; it might be a matter of crime; it might be a matter of life and
  death. The gloom deepened into horror, and Helen and her few servants, and
  Dick, who was much in the house, fell into so lively an apprehension that the
  mere creaking of a door would make them start, a foot crunching on the sand
  outside sent them flying to the window. So for a month, until Dick Parmiter,
  coming over the hill from New Grimsby harbour at night, had a lantern flashed
  in his face, and when close to the house saw a man spring up from the gorse
  and watch him as he passed. From that night the house was continually spied
  upon, and Helen walked continually from room to room wringing her hands in
  sheer distraction at her helplessness. She feared that they were watching for
  Cullen; she feared, too, that Cullen, receiving no answer to his message,
  would come himself and fall into their hands. She dared hardly conjecture for
  what reason they were watching, since she knew Cullen. For a week these men
  watched, five of them, who kept their watches as at sea; and then Dick,
  taking his courage in his hands, and bethinking him of Lieutenant
  Clutterbuck, who had been an assiduous visitor at the house on Tresco, had
  crossed over to St. Mary's and learned from old Captain Hathaway where he now
  lived. He had said nothing of his purpose to Helen, partly from a certain
  shyness at speaking to her upon a topic of some delicacy, and partly lest he
  should awaken her hopes and perhaps only disappoint them. But he had begged a
  passage in a ship that was sailing to Cornwall, and, crossing thither
  secretly, had made his way in six weeks to London.</p>

  <p>This is the story which my acquaintance repeated to me as we sat in the
  "Groom Porters."</p>

  <p>"And Clutterbuck refused to meddle in the matter," said I. "Poor lad!"</p>

  <p>I was thinking of Dick, but my companion mistook my meaning, for he
  glanced thoughtfully at me for a second.</p>

  <p>"I think you are very right to pity him," he said; "although, Mr.
  Berkeley, if you will pardon me, I am a trifle surprised to hear that
  sentiment from you. It is indeed a sodden, pitiful, miserable dog's life that
  Clutterbuck leads. To pass the morning over his toilette, to loiter through
  the afternoon in a boudoir, and to dispose of the evening so that he may be
  drunk before midnight! He would be much better taking the good air into his
  lungs and setting his wits to unknot that tangle amongst those islands in the
  sea. But I have overstayed my time. If you can persuade him to that, you will
  be doing him no small service;" and politely taking his leave, he went out of
  the room.</p>

  <p>I sat for some while longer in the corner. I could not pretend that he had
  spoken anything but truth, but I found his words none the less bitter on that
  account. A pitiful dog's life for Lieutenant Clutterbuck, who was at the most
  twenty-four years of age! What, then, was it for me, who had seven years the
  better of Lieutenant Clutterbuck, or rather, I should say, seven years the
  worse? I was thirty-one that very month, and Clutterbuck's sodden, pitiful
  life had been mine for the last seven years. An utter disgust took hold of me
  as I repeated over and over to myself my strange friend's words. I looked at
  the green cloth and the yellow candles, and the wolfish faces about the
  cloth. The candles had grown soft with the heat of the night, and were bent
  out of their shape, so that the grease dropped in great blots upon the cloth,
  and the air was close with an odour of stale punch. I got up from my corner
  and went out into the street, and stood by the water in St. James's Park, If
  only some such summons had come to me when I was twenty-four as had now come
  to Clutterbuck!&mdash;well, very likely I should have turned a deaf ear to
  it, even as he had done! And&mdash;and, at all events, I was thirty-one and
  the summons had not come to me, and there was an end of the matter. To-morrow
  I should go back to the green cloth and not trouble my head about the grease
  blots; but to-night, since Clutterbuck was twenty-four, I would try to do him
  that small service of which the stranger spoke, and so setting out at a round
  pace I made my way to Clutterbuck's lodging.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"><small>CHAPTER III</small></a><br>
  <br>
  OF THE MAGICAL INFLUENCE OF A MAP</h2>

  <p class="first">I did not, however, find Lieutenant Clutterbuck that night.
  He was out of reach, and likely to remain so for some while to come. He had
  left his lodgings at mid-day and taken his body-servant with him, and his
  landlady had no knowledge of his whereabouts. I thought it probable, however,
  that some of his friends might have that knowledge, and I thereupon hurried
  to those haunts where of an evening he was an habitual visitor. The "Hercules
  Pillars" in Piccadilly, the "Cocoa Tree" in St. James's Street, the "Spring
  Gardens" at Vauxhall, "Barton's" in King Street, the "Spread Eagle" in Covent
  Garden,&mdash;I hurried from one to the other of these places, and though I
  came upon many of Clutterbuck's intimates, not one of them was a whit better
  informed than myself. I returned to my lodging late and more disheartened
  than I could have believed possible in a matter wherein I had no particular
  concern. And, indeed, it was not so much any conjecture as to what strange
  tragical events might be happening about that watched and solitary house in
  Tresco which troubled me, or even pity for the girl maddened by her fears, or
  regret that I had not been able to do Clutterbuck that slight service which I
  purposed. But I took out the map of the Great West Road, and thought of the
  lad Parmiter trudging along it, doing a day's work here among the fields,
  begging a lift there upon a waggon and slowly working his way down into the
  West. I had a very clear picture of him before my eyes. The day was breaking,
  I remember, and I blew out the candles and looked out of the window down the
  street. The pavement was more silent at that hour than those country roads on
  which he might now be walking, or that hedge under which he might be shaking
  the dew from off his clothes. For there the thrush would be calling to the
  blackbird with an infinite bustle and noise, and the fields of corn would be
  whispering to the fields of wheat.</p>

  <p>I came back again to my map, and while the light broadened, followed
  Parmiter from the outset of his journey, through Knightsbridge, along the
  Thames, between the pine-trees of Hampshire, past Whitchurch, and into the
  county of Devon. The road was unwound before my eyes like a tape. I saw it
  slant upwards to the brow of a hill, and dip into the cup of a valley; here
  through a boskage of green I saw a flash of silver where the river ran; there
  between flat green fields it lay, a broad white line geometrically straight
  to the gate of a city; it curved amongst the churches and houses, but never
  lost itself in that labyrinth, aiming with every wind and turn at that other
  gate, from which it leaped free at last to the hills. And always on the road
  I saw Dick Parmiter, drunk with fatigue, tottering and stumbling down to the
  West.</p>

  <p>For awhile he occupied that road alone; but in the end I saw another
  traveller a long way behind&mdash;a man on horseback, who spurred out from
  London and rode with the speed of the wind. For a little I watched that
  rider, curious only to discern how far he travelled, and whether he would
  pass Dick Parmiter; then, as I saw him drawing nearer and nearer, devouring
  the miles which lay between, it came upon me slowly that he was riding not to
  pass but to overtake; and at once the fancy flashed across me that this was
  Clutterbuck. I gazed at my map upon the table as one might gaze into a
  magician's globe. It was no longer a map; it was the road itself imprisoned
  in hedges, sunlit, and chequered with the shadows of trees. I could see the
  horseman, I could see the dust spirting up from beneath his horse's hoofs
  like smoke from a gun-barrel. Only his hat was pushed down upon his brows
  because of the wind made by the speed of his galloping, so that I could not
  see his face. But it was Clutterbuck I had no doubt. Whither had he gone from
  his lodging? Now I was convinced that I knew. There had been no need of my
  night's wanderings from tavern to tavern, had I but looked at my map before.
  It was Clutterbuck without a doubt. At some bend of the road he would turn in
  his saddle to look backwards, and I should recognise his face. It was
  Lieutenant Clutterbuck, taking the good air into his lungs with a vengeance.
  He vanished into a forest, but beyond the forest the road dipped down a bank
  of grass and lay open to the eye. I should see him in a second race out, his
  body bent over his horse's neck to save him from the swinging boughs. I could
  have clapped my hands with sheer pleasure. I wished that my voice could have
  reached out to Parmiter, tramping wearily so far beyond; in my excitement, I
  believed that it would, and before I knew what I did, I cried out aloud:</p>

  <p>"Parmiter! Parmiter!" and a voice behind me answered:</p>

  <p>"You must be mad, Berkeley! What in the world has come to you?"</p>

  <p>I sat upright in my chair. The excitement died out of me and left me
  chilly. I looked about me; I was in my own lodging at the corner of St
  James's Street, outside in the streets the world was beginning to wake, and
  the voice which had spoken to me and the hand which was now laid upon my
  shoulder were the voice and the hand of Lieutenant Clutterbuck.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" said he, leaning over my shoulder. "It is a map."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, "it is a mere map, the map of the Great West Road;" and
  in my eyes it was no longer any more than a map.</p>

  <p>Clutterbuck, who was holding it in his hand, dropped it with a movement
  and an exclamation of anger. Then he looked curiously at me, stepped over to
  the sideboard and took up a glass or two which stood there. The glasses were
  clean and dry. He looked at me again, his curiosity had grown into
  uneasiness; he walked to the opposite side of the table, and drawing up a
  chair seated himself face to face with me.</p>

  <p>"I hoped you were drunk," said he. "But it seems you are as sober as a
  bishop. Are you daft, then? Has it come to a strait-waistcoat? I come back
  late from Twickenham. I stopped at the 'Hercules Pillars.' There I heard that
  you had rushed in two hours before in a great flurry and disorder, crying out
  that you must speak to me on the instant. The same story was told to me at
  the 'Cocoa Trees.' My landlady repeated it. I conjectured that it must needs
  be some little affair to be settled with sharps at six in the morning; and so
  that you might not say your friends neglect you, I turn from my bed, and
  hurry to you at three o'clock of the morning. I find that you have left your
  front-door unlatched for any thief that wills to make his profit of the
  house. I come into your room and find you bending over a map in a great
  excitement and crying out aloud that damned boy's name. Is he to trouble my
  peace until the Judgment Day? Are you daft, eh, Steve?" and he reached his
  hand across the table not unkindly, and laid it on my sleeve. "Are you
  daft?"</p>

  <p>I was staring again at the map, and did not answer him. He shifted his
  hand from my sleeve and took it up and away from my eyes. He looked at it
  himself, and then spoke slowly, and in quite a different voice:</p>

  <p>"It is a curious, suggestive thing, the map of a road, when all's said,"
  he observed slowly. "I'll not deny but what it seizes one's fancies. Its
  simple lines and curves call up I know not what pictures of flowering
  hedgerows; a little black blot means a village of stone cottages, very likely
  overhung with ivy and climbed upon with roses." He suddenly thrust the map
  again under my nose, "What do you see upon the road?" said he.</p>

  <p>"Parmiter," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he interrupted sharply. "Well, where is Parmiter?" and I laid
  a finger on the map.</p>

  <p>"Between Fenny Bridges and Exeter," said he, leaning forward. "He has made
  great haste."</p>

  <p>He spoke quite seriously, not questioning my conjecture, but accepting it
  as a mere statement of fact.</p>

  <p>"That is a heath?" he asked, pointing to an inch or so where the map was
  shaded on each side of the high-road. "Yes, a heath t'other side of Hartley
  Row; I know it. There should be a mail-coach there, and the horses out of the
  shafts, and one or two men in crape masks and a lady in a swoon, and the
  driver stretched in the middle of the road with a bullet through his
  crop."</p>

  <p>"I do not see that," I returned. "But here, beyond
  Axminster&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>He leaned yet further forward.</p>

  <p>"There is a forest here."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I saw a man on horseback ride into it between the trees. He has not as
  yet emerged from it."</p>

  <p>"Who was he? Did you know him?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I did. But I could not see his face."</p>

  <p>Clutterbuck watched that forest eagerly, and with a queer suspense in his
  attitude and even in his breathing. Every now and then he raised his eyes to
  mine with a question in them. Each time I shook my head, and answered:</p>

  <p>"Not yet," and we both again stared at the map.</p>

  <p>Then Clutterbuck whispered quickly:</p>

  <p>"What if his horse had stumbled? What if he is lying there at the roadside
  beneath the tree?" He tore himself away from the contemplation of the map.
  "The thing's magical!" he cried. "It has bewitched you, Steve, and by the
  Lord it has come near to bewitching me!"</p>

  <p>"I thought the horseman was yourself. Why don't you go?" said I, pointing
  to the map.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Clutterbuck rose impatiently from his chair.</p>

  <p>"There must be an end of this. Once for all I will not go. There is no
  reason I should. There is reason why I should not. You do not know in what
  you are meddling. You are taken like a schoolboy by an old wife's tale of a
  lonely girl trapped in a net. You are too old for such follies."</p>

  <p>"I was too old a fortnight ago," I returned, "but, by the Lord, these last
  days I have grown young again&mdash;so young that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I stopped suddenly. Not until this instant had the notion occurred to me,
  but it came now, it thrilled through me with a veritable shock. I leaned back
  in my chair and stared at Clutterbuck. He understood, for he in his turn
  stared at me.</p>

  <p>"The rider!" said he breathlessly, tapping the map with his forefinger,
  "the man whose face you did not see!"</p>

  <p>I nodded at him.</p>

  <p>"What if the face were mine?" said I.</p>

  <p>"You could never believe it."</p>

  <p>"I believe that I have even enough youth for that," I cried, and I bent
  over the map, trying again to fashion from its plain black and white my
  picture of the great high-road, climbing and winding through a country-side
  rich with all the colours of the summer. But it was only a map of lines and
  curves, nor could I any longer discover the horseman who spurred along
  it&mdash;though I had now a particular reason to wish for a view of his
  face,&mdash;or the wood into which he disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Well, has your cavalier galloped into the open yet?" asked
  Clutterbuck.</p>

  <p>He spoke with sarcasm, but the sarcasm was forced. It was but a cloak to
  cover and excuse the question.</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"No, and he will not," said Clutterbuck.</p>

  <p>"Is that so sure?" I asked. "What if the face were mine?"</p>

  <p>"You are serious!" he cried. "You would go a stranger and offer your
  unsought aid? It would be an impertinence."</p>

  <p>"Suppose life and death are in the balance, would they weigh
  impertinence?"</p>

  <p>"It might be <i>your</i> life and <i>your</i> death!"</p>

  <p>And as he spoke, it seemed to me that all my last seven years rose up in
  their shrouds and laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"And what then?" I cried. "Would the world shiver if I died? Would even a
  tavern-keeper draw down his blinds? Perhaps some drunkard in his cups would
  wish I lived, that he might take my measure in a drinking-bout. There's my
  epitaph for you! Good Lord, Clutterbuck, but I would dearly love to die a
  clean death! There's that boy Parmiter tramping down his road. He does a far
  better thing than I have ever done. You know! Why talk of it? You know the
  life I have lived, and since that boy flung his example in my eyes, upon my
  word I sicken to think of it. Twelve years ago, Clutterbuck, I came to
  London, a cadet with a cadet's poor portion, but what a wealth of dreams! A
  fortune first, if I slaved till I was forty, and then I would set free my
  soul and live! The fortune came, and I slaved but six years for it. The
  treaty of Aix and a rise of stocks, and there was my fortune. You know how I
  have lived since."</p>

  <p>Clutterbuck looked at me curiously. I had never said so much to him or to
  any man in this strain. Nor should I have said so much now, but I was fairly
  shaken out of my discretion. For a little Clutterbuck sat silent and
  motionless. Then he said gently:</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you why I will not go? Yes, I will tell you," and he told me
  the history of that Sunday, two years ago, when Cullen Mayle sat in the
  stocks, or at least as much of it as had come within his knowledge. The
  events of that day were the beginning of all the trouble, indeed, but
  Lieutenant Clutterbuck never knew more of it than what concerned himself, and
  as I sat over against him on that July morning and listened to his story
  while the world awoke, I had no suspicion of what the passage of that Sunday
  hid, or of the extraordinary consequences which it brought about.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"><small>CHAPTER IV</small></a><br>
  <br>
  DESCRIBES THE REMARKABLE MANNER<br>
  IN WHICH CULLEN MAYLE LEFT TRESCO</h2>

  <p class="first">"It was my business," he began, "to fetch Cullen Mayle from
  Tresco over to St. Mary's where the stocks were set. It was an unpleasant
  business, and to me doubly and damnably unpleasant."</p>

  <p>"I understand!" said I, thinking of how he had before spoken to me of Adam
  Mayle's adopted daughter.</p>

  <p>"I took a file of Musquets, found the three of them at breakfast, and,
  with as much delicacy as I could, explained my errand. Helen alone showed any
  distress or consciousness of disgrace. Cullen strolled to the window, and
  seeing that I had placed my men securely about the house and that my boat was
  ready on the sand not a dozen yards away, professed himself, with an
  inimitable indifference, willing to gratify my wishes; while Adam, so far
  from manifesting any anger, broke out into a great roar of laughter.</p>

  <p>"'Cullen, my boy,' he shouted, like a man highly pleased, 'here's a nasty
  stumble for your pride. To sit in the stocks of a Sunday morning, when all
  the girls can see you as they come from church! To sit in the stocks like a
  common drunkard; and you that sets up for a gentleman! Oh, Cullen, Cullen!'
  He wagged his head from side to side, and so brought his fist upon the table
  with a bang which set all the plates dancing. 'Devil damn me,' said he, 'if I
  don't sail to church at St. Mary's myself and see how you look in your wooden
  garters.' Cullen glanced carelessly towards me. 'An unseemly old man,' said
  he; and we left Adam still shaking like a monstrous jellyfish, and crossed
  back to St. Mary's from Tresco.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough Adam kept his word. They were singing the <i>Nunc
  Dimittis</i> in the church when Adam stumped up the aisle. He had brought
  Helen with him, and she looked as though she wished the brick floor to open
  and let her out of sight. But Adam kept his head erect and showed a face of
  an extraordinary good humour. You may be certain that the parson got the
  scantiest attention imaginable to his discourse. For one thing, Adam Mayle
  had never set foot in St. Mary's Church before, and for another, every one
  was agog to see how he would bear himself afterwards, when he passed on his
  way to the quay across the little space before the Customs House.</p>

  <p>"There was a rush to the church door as soon as the benediction was
  pronounced, and it happened that I was one of the last to come out of the
  porch. The first thing that I saw was Adam walking a little way apart amongst
  the gravestones with a stranger, and the next thing, Helen talking to Dick
  Parmiter."</p>

  <p>Here I interrupted Clutterbuck, for I was anxious to let no detail escape
  me.</p>

  <p>"Had Dick crossed with Adam Mayle from Tresco?"</p>

  <p>"I think not," returned Clutterbuck. "He was not in the church. I do not
  know, but I fancy he brought the stranger over to St. Mary's afterwards."</p>

  <p>"And who was this stranger?"</p>

  <p>"George Glen he called himself, and said he had been quartermaster with
  Adam Mayle at Whydah. He was a squat, tarry man, of Adam's age or
  thereabouts, and the pair of them walked through the gates and crossed the
  fields over to the street of Hugh Town. I made haste to join Helen,"
  Clutterbuck continued, and explained his words with an unnecessary confusion.
  "I mean, I would not have it appear that she shared in the disgrace which had
  befallen Cullen Mayle. So I walked with her, and we followed Adam down the
  street to the Customs House, where it seemed every inhabitant was loitering,
  and where Cullen sat, with his hat cocked forward over his forehead to shield
  him from the sun, entirely at his ease.</p>

  <p>"It was curious to observe the behaviour of the loiterers. Some affected
  not to see Cullen at all; some, but those chiefly maidens, protested that it
  was a great shame so fine a gentleman should be so barbarously used. The
  elders on the other hand answered that he had come over late to his deserts,
  while a few, with a ludicrous pretence of unconsciousness, bowed and smiled
  at him as though it was the most natural thing in the world for a man in a
  laced coat to take the air in the stocks of a Sunday morning.</p>

  <p>"Into the midst of this group marched Adam Mayle, and came to a halt
  before his son. He had composed his face to an unexceptionable gravity, and
  as he prodded thoughtfully with his stick at the sole of Cullen's shoe,</p>

  <p>"'This is the first time,' he said, 'that ever I saw a pair of silk
  stockings in the stocks.'</p>

  <p>"'One lives and learns,' replied Cullen, indifferently; and the old man
  lifted his nose into the air and said dreamily:</p>

  <p>"'There is a ducking-chair, is there not, at the pier head?' and so walked
  on to the steps where his boat was moored. He went down into it with Mr.
  Glen, and the two men set about hoisting the sail. I was still standing on
  the pier with Helen.</p>

  <p>"'You will come too?' she said with a sort of appeal. 'I do not know what
  may happen when Cullen is set free and comes back, I should be very glad if
  you would come.'"</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Clutterbuck broke off his story and walked uneasily once or
  twice across the room as though he was troubled even now with the
  recollection of her appeal and of how she looked when she made it.</p>

  <p>"So I went," he continued suddenly, and with a burst of frankness. "You
  see, Steve, she and I were very good friends; I never saw anything but
  welcome in her eyes when I crossed over to Tresco, and the kindliness of her
  voice had a warmth, and at times a tenderness, which I hoped meant more than
  friendship. Indeed, I would have staked my life she was ignorant of
  duplicity; and with Cullen she seemed always at some pains to conceal a
  repugnance. Well, I was young, I suppose; I saw with the eyes of youth, which
  see everything out of its due proportion. I crossed to Tresco, and while we
  were seated at dinner, about two hours later, Cullen Mayle strolled in and
  took his chair. Dick Parmiter had waited for him at St. Mary's until such
  time as he was set free, and had brought him across the Road.</p>

  <p>"I cannot deny but what Cullen Mayle bore himself very suitably for the
  greater part of the time we were at table. Adam's blatant jests were enough
  to set any man's teeth on edge, yet Cullen made as though he did not hear a
  word of them, and talked politely upon indifferent topics to us and Mr. Glen.
  Adam, however, was not to be silenced that way. His banter became coarse and
  vindictive; for one thing he had drunk a deal of liquor, and for another he
  was exasperated that he could not provoke his son. I forget what particular
  joke he roared out from the head of the table, but I saw Cullen stretch his
  arm out over the cloth.</p>

  <p>"'I see what is amiss,' he said, wearily, and took away the brandy bottle
  from his father's elbow. He went to the window, and opening it, emptied the
  bottle on to the grass beneath the sill. Then he came back to his seat and
  said suavely to Mr. Glen: 'My father cannot get the better of his old habits;
  he is drunk very early on Sundays&mdash;an unregenerate old put of a fellow
  as ever I came across.'</p>

  <p>"The quarrel followed close upon the heels of that sentence, and occupied
  the afternoon and was renewed at supper. Adam very violent and blustering;
  Cullen very cool and composed, and only betraying his passion by the
  whiteness of his face. He used no oaths; he sat staring at his father with
  his dark sleepy eyes, and languidly accused him of every crime in the Newgate
  Calendar, with a great deal of detail as to time and place, and adding any
  horrible detail which came into his mind. The old man was routed at the last.
  About the middle of supper he got up from his chair, and going up the stairs
  shut himself into a room which he had fitted up as a cabin, and where he was
  used to sit of an evening.</p>

  <p>"We were all, as you may guess, inexpressibly relieved when Adam left the
  parlour, for here it seemed was the quarrel ended. We counted, however,
  without Cullen. He looked for a moment or two at his father's empty chair,
  and stood up in his turn.</p>

  <p>"'Here's an old rogue for you,' he said in a gentle voice. 'He has no more
  manners than a nasty pig. I'll teach him some,' and he followed his father up
  the stairs and into the cabin above. What was said between them we never
  heard, but we gathered at the foot of the stairs in the hall and listened to
  their voices. The old man bellowed as though he was in pain, and shook the
  windows with his noise; Cullen's voice came to us only as a smooth,
  continuous murmur. For half an hour perhaps we stood thus in the
  hall&mdash;interference would have only made matters worse&mdash;and I own
  that this half hour was not wholly unpleasant to me. Helen, in a word, was
  afraid, and more than once her hand was laid upon my coat-sleeve, and,
  touching it, ceased to tremble. She turned to me, it seemed, in that half
  hour of fear; I was fool enough to think it.</p>

  <p>"At length we heard a door opening. Cullen negligently came down the
  stairs; Adam rushed out after him as far as the head of the stairs, where he
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"'Open the door, one of you!' he bawled. 'Kick him out, Clutterbuck, and
  we'll see what damned muck-heap his fine manners will lead him to.'</p>

  <p>"The outcry brought the servants scurrying into the hall. Adam repeated
  his order and one of the servants threw open the door.</p>

  <p>"'Will you fetch me my boots?' said Cullen, and sitting down in a chair he
  kicked off his shoes. Then he pulled on his boots deliberately, stood up and
  felt in his pockets. From one pocket he drew out five guineas, from a second
  two, from a third four. These eleven guineas he held in his open hand.</p>

  <p>"'They belong to you, I think,' he said, softly, poising them in his palm;
  and before any one could move a step or indeed guess at his intention, he
  raised his arm and flung them with all his force to where his father stood at
  the head of the stairs. Two of the guineas cut the old man in the forehead,
  and the blood ran down his face; the rest sparkled and clattered against the
  panels behind his head, whence they fell on to the stairs and rolled one by
  one down into the hall. No one spoke; no one moved. The brutal violence of
  the action for the moment paralysed every one; even Adam stood shaking at the
  stair head with his wits wandering. One by one the guineas rolled down the
  staircase, leaping from step to step, rattling as they leaped; and for a long
  time it seemed, one whirred and sang in a corner as it span round and settled
  down upon the boards; and when the coin had ceased to spin, still no one
  moved, no one spoke. A murmur of waves breaking lazily upon the sand, a
  breath of air stirring a shrub in the garden, the infinitesimal trumpeting of
  a gnat, came through the window, bringing as it were tales of things which
  lived into a room of statues.</p>

  <p>"Cullen himself was the first to break the enchantment. He took his watch
  from his fob and holding it by the ribbon twirled it backwards and forwards.
  It was a big silver watch, and as he twirled it this way and that, it caught
  the light, seemed to throw out little sparks of fire, and flashed with a
  dazzling brightness. The eyes of the company were caught by it; they watched
  it with a keen attention, not knowing why they watched it; they watched it as
  it shone and glittered in its revolutions, almost with a sense of
  expectation, as though something of great consequence was to happen from the
  twirling of that watch.</p>

  <p>"'This, too, is yours,' said Cullen, 'but it was no doubt some dead
  sailorman's before you stole it;' and ceasing to twirl the watch he held it
  steady by the ribbon. Then he looked round the hall and saw Helen staring at
  the watch with a queer intentness. I remember that her hand was at that
  moment resting upon my sleeve, and I felt it grow more rigid. I looked at
  her; her face was set, her eyes fixed upon Cullen and his glittering watch. I
  spoke to her; she did not answer, she did not hear."</p>

  <p>Clutterbuck interrupted his story and sat moodily lost in his
  recollections, and when he resumed it was with great bitterness.</p>

  <p>"I think," he continued, "that when Cullen spoke, he spoke with no other
  end than to provoke his father yet more. You must know that the old man had
  just one tender spot in his heart. Cullen could have no other aim but to set
  his heel on that.</p>

  <p>"'I will come back for you, Helen,' he said, bending his eyes upon her and
  making as if there was much love between them; and to everybody's surprise
  Helen lifted her eyes slowly from the watch until they met Cullen's, and kept
  them there. She did not answer him in words, there was no need she should,
  every line of her body expressed obedience.</p>

  <p>"Even Cullen was puzzled by her demeanour. Boy and girl, maid and youth,
  they had lived side by side in the house with indifference upon his part and
  all the appearance of aversion upon hers. Yet here was she subdued in an
  instant at the prospect of his departure! It seemed that the mere thought
  that Cullen was henceforth an outcast tore her secret live and warm from her
  heart.</p>

  <p>"Cullen was plainly puzzled, as I say, but he was not the man to miss an
  advantage in the gratification of his malice. He shot one triumphant look at
  his father and spoke again to Helen.</p>

  <p>"'You will wait for me?'</p>

  <p>"Her eyes never wavered from his.</p>

  <p>"'Yes!' she answered.</p>

  <p>"It was a humiliating moment for me as you may imagine. It must have been
  more humiliating for Adam. With a hand upon the rail he lumbered heavily down
  a couple of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"'No!' he cried, with a dreadful oath and in a voice which was strangely
  moved.</p>

  <p>"'But I say yes,' said Cullen, very quietly. The smile had gone from his
  face; a new excitement kindled it. He was pitting his will against his
  father's. I saw him suddenly draw himself erect. 'Or, better still, you shall
  come with me now,' he cried. He reached out his arm straight from the
  shoulder towards her.</p>

  <p>"'Come! Come with me now.'</p>

  <p>"His voice rang out dominant like the clang of a trumpet, and to the
  consternation of us all, Helen crossed the floor towards him. I tried to
  detain her. 'Helen,' I cried, 'you do not know what you are doing. He will
  drag you into the gutter.'</p>

  <p>"'Lieutenant Clutterbuck,' said Cullen, 'you are very red in the face. You
  cannot expect she will listen to you, for you do not look well when you are
  red in the face.'</p>

  <p>"I paid no heed to his gibes.</p>

  <p>"'Helen,' I cried, again. She paid no more heed to my prayers. 'What will
  you do? Where will you go?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'We shall go to London,' answered Cullen, 'where we shall do very well,
  and further to the best of our means Lieutenant Clutterbuck's
  advancement.'</p>

  <p>"Humiliation and grief had overset my judgment or I should not have argued
  at this moment with Cullen Mayle. I flung out at him hotly, and like a
  boy.</p>

  <p>"'When you are doing very well in London, Cullen Mayle, Lieutenant
  Clutterbuck will not be so far behind you.'</p>

  <p>"'He will indeed be close upon my heels,' returned Cullen as pleasantly as
  possible, 'for most likely he will be carrying my valise.'</p>

  <p>"With that he turned again to Helen, beckoned her to follow him, and
  strode towards the open door. She did follow him. Cullen was already in the
  doorway; in another second she would have crossed the threshold. But with a
  surprising agility Adam Mayle jumped down the stairs, ran across the hall,
  and caught the girl in his arms. She did not struggle to free herself, but
  she strained steadily towards Cullen. The old man's arms were strong,
  however.</p>

  <p>"'Shut the door,' he cried, and I sprang forward and slammed it to.</p>

  <p>"'Lock it! Bolt it!'</p>

  <p>"Adam stood with his arms about the girl until the heavy bar swung down
  across the door and dropped into its socket with a clang. Now do you
  understand why I will not go down to Tresco? I can give you another reason if
  you are not content. When I spoke to Helen two days later, and taxed her with
  her passion for Cullen,&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;she was deeply
  pained and hurt. She would not have it said that she had so much as thought
  of following Cullen's fortunes. She outfaced me as though I had been telling
  her fairy tales, and not what my own eyes saw. No, indeed, I will not go down
  to Tresco! I am not the traveller who has ridden into your wood upon the
  Great West Road."</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Clutterbuck took up his hat when he had finished his story,</p>

  <p>"The girl, besides, is not worth a thought," said he.</p>

  <p>"I am not thinking of her," said I. Of Lieutenant Clutterbuck, of myself,
  above all of Dick Parmiter, I was thinking, but not at all of Helen Mayle. I
  drew the map towards me. Clutterbuck stopped at the door, came back and again
  leaned over my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Has your traveller come out from that wood?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered.</p>

  <p>"It is an allegory," said he. "The man who rides down on this business to
  the West will, in very truth, enter into a wood from which he will not get
  free."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"><small>CHAPTER V</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE ADVENTURE IN THE WOOD</h2>

  <p class="first">A loud roll of drums beneath my windows, the inspiriting
  music of trumpets, the lively measured stamp of feet. The troops with General
  Amherst at their head were marching down St. James's Street on their way to
  embark for Canada, and the tune to which they marched sang in my head that
  day as I rode out of London. The beat of my horse's hoofs kept time to it,
  and at Brentford a girl singing in a garden of apple-trees threw me a snatch
  of a song to fit to it.</p>

  <p>She sang, and I caught the words up as I rode past. The sparkle of summer
  was in the air, and an Indian summer, if you will, at my heart. I slept that
  night at Hartley Row, and the next at Down House, and the third at a little
  inn some miles beyond Dorchester. A brook danced at the foot of the house,
  and sang me to sleep with the song I had heard at Brentford, and, as I lay in
  bed, I could see out of my window the starlight and the quiet fields white
  with a frost of dew and thickets of trees very black and still; and towards
  sunset upon the fourth day, I suddenly reined in my horse to one side and sat
  stone-still. To my left, the road ran straight and level for a long way, and
  nowhere upon it was there a living thing; on each side stretched fields and
  no one moved in them, and no house was visible. That way I had come, and I
  had remarked upon the loneliness. To my right, the road ran forward into a
  thick wood, and vanished beneath a roof of overhanging boughs. It was the
  aspect of that wood which took my breath away, and it surprised me because it
  was familiar. There was a milestone which I recognised just where the first
  tree overhung the road; there was a white gate in the hedge some twenty paces
  this side of the milestone. I knew that too. Just behind where I sat there
  should be three tall poplars ranged in a line like sentinels, the wood's
  outposts; I turned, and in the field behind me, the poplars reached up
  against the sky. I had no doubt they would be there, yet the sight of them
  fairly startled me. I had seen them&mdash;yes, but never in my life had I
  ridden along this road before. I had seen them only on the map in my lodging
  at St. James's Street.</p>

  <p>The sun dropped down behind the trees, and the earth turned grey. I sat
  there in the saddle with I know not what superstitious fancies upon me. I
  could not but remember that the traveller had ridden into the wood, and had
  not ridden out and down the open bank of grass upon the other side. "What if
  his horse has stumbled?" Clutterbuck had asked. "What if he is lying at the
  roadside under the trees?" I could see that picture very clearly, and at
  last, very clearly too, the rider's face. I looked backwards down the road
  with an instinctive hope that some other traveller might be riding my way in
  whose company I might go along. But the long level slip of white was empty.
  All the warmth seemed to have gone from the world with the dropping of the
  sun. A sad chill twilight crept over the lonely fields. A shiver caught and
  shook me; I gathered up the reins and rode slowly among the trees, where
  already it was night.</p>

  <p>I rode at first in the centre of the highway, and found the clatter of my
  horse's hoofs a very companionable sound. But in a little the clatter seemed
  too loud, it was too clear a warning of my approach, it seemed to me in some
  way a provocation of danger. I drew to one side of the road where the leaves
  had drifted and made a carpet whereon I rode without noise. But now the
  silence seemed too eerie&mdash;I heard, and started at, the snapping of every
  twig. I strained my ears to catch the noise of creeping footfalls, and I was
  about to guide my horse back to the middle of the road, when I turned a
  corner suddenly, and saw in front of me in a space where the forest receded
  and let the sky through, lights gleaming in a window.</p>

  <p>I set spurs to the horse and galloped up to the door. The house was an
  inn; the landlord was already at the threshold, and in a very short while I
  was laughing at my fears over my supper in the parlour.</p>

  <p>"Am I your only guest to-night?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"There is one other, sir," returned the landlord as he served me, and as
  he spoke I heard a footstep in the passage. The door was pushed open, and a
  young man politely bowed to me in the entrance.</p>

  <p>"You have a very pretty piece of horseflesh, sir," said he, as he came
  into the room. "I took the liberty of looking it over a minute ago in the
  stables."</p>

  <p>"It is not bad," said I. There was never a man in the world who did not
  relish praise of his horse, and I warmed to my new acquaintance. "We are
  both, it seems, sleeping here to-night, and likely enough we are travelling
  the same road to-morrow."</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I could wish indeed," said he, "that we might be fellow-travellers, but
  though it may well be we follow the same road, we do not, alas, travel in the
  same way," and he showed me his boots which were thickly covered with dust.
  "My horse fell some half-a-dozen miles from here and snapped a leg. I must
  needs walk to-morrow so far as where I trust to procure another&mdash;that is
  to say," he continued, "if I do not have to keep my bed, for I have taken a
  devilish chill this evening," and drawing up his chair to the empty
  fireplace, he crouched over an imaginary fire and shivered.</p>

  <p>Now since he sat in this attitude, I could not but notice his boots, and I
  fell to wondering what in the world he had done with his spurs. For he wore
  none, and since he had plainly not troubled to repair the disorder of his
  dress, it seemed strange that he should have gone to the pains of removing
  his spurs. However, I was soon diverted from this speculation by the distress
  into which Mr. Featherstone's cold threw him. Featherstone was his name, as
  he was polite enough to tell me in the intervals of coughing, and I told him
  mine in return. At last his malady so increased that he called for the
  landlord, and bidding him light a great fire in his bedroom said he must
  needs go to bed.</p>

  <p>"I trust, however," he continued politely to me, "that you, Mr. Berkeley,
  will prove a Samaritan, and keep me company for a while. For I shall not
  sleep, upon my word I shall not sleep a wink," and he was so positive in his
  assurances that, though I was myself sufficiently tired, I thought it no more
  than kindness to fall in with his wishes.</p>

  <p>Accordingly I followed him into his bedroom, where he lay in a great
  canopied bed, with a big fire blazing upon the hearth, and a bottle of rum
  with a couple of glasses upon a table at the bedside.</p>

  <p>"It is an ague," said he, "which I caught upon the Gambia River, and from
  which I have ever since suffered many inconveniences;" he poured out the rum
  into the glasses, and wished me with great politeness all prosperity.</p>

  <p>It was no doubt, also, because he had voyaged on the Gambia River that he
  suffered no inconvenience from the heat of the room. But what with the hot
  August night, and the blazing fire, and the closed window, I became at once
  so drowsy that I could hardly keep my eyes open, and I wished him
  good-night.</p>

  <p>"But you will not go," said he. "We are but this moment acquainted, and
  to-morrow we shall wave a farewell each to the other. Let us, Mr. Berkeley,
  make something of the meanwhile, I beg you."</p>

  <p>I answered him that I did not wish to appear churlish, but that I should
  most certainly appear so if I fell asleep while we talked, which, in spite of
  myself, I was very likely to do.</p>

  <p>"But I have a bottle of salts here," said he, with a laugh, as he reached
  out of bed and fumbled with his coat. "I have a bottle of salts here which
  will infallibly persuade you from any thought of sleep," and he drew out from
  the pocket of his coat a pack of cards. "Well, what do you say?" he
  continued, as I did not move.</p>

  <p>"It is some while since I handled a card," said I slowly.</p>

  <p>"A game of picquet," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"It is a good game," said I.</p>

  <p>He flipped the edges of the cards with his thumb. I drew nearer to the
  bed.</p>

  <p>"Well, one game then," said I.</p>

  <p>"To be sure," said he, shuffling the cards.</p>

  <p>"And the stakes must be low."</p>

  <p>"I hate a gambler myself."</p>

  <p>He cut the cards. I sat down on the bedside and dealt them.</p>

  <p>"It is your elder," said I.</p>

  <p>He looked disconsolately at his hand.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word," said he. "Deuce take me if I know what to discard. I have
  no hand for picquet at all, though as luck will have it I have very good putt
  cards."</p>

  <p>I glanced through my hand.</p>

  <p>"I have better putt cards than you," said I.</p>

  <p>"It is not likely," he returned.</p>

  <p>"I'll make a wager of it," I cried.</p>

  <p>"Your horse," said he, leaning up on his elbow. He spoke a trifle too
  eagerly, he sprang up on his elbow a trifle too quickly. I looked again
  through my hand, and I laid the cards down on the counterpane.</p>

  <p>"No," said I quietly. "It is very likely you are right: I have two treys
  and an ace, but you may have two treys and a deuce."</p>

  <p>"Why, this is purely magical," he exclaimed, with the most natural burst
  of laughter imaginable. "Two treys and a deuce! Those are indeed the cards I
  hold."</p>

  <p>He fell back again in the bed, and we played our single game of picquet.
  He won the game. Indeed, he could not but win it, for I paid no attention
  whatever to the cards which I held, or to how I should draw, or&mdash;and
  this perhaps was my most important omission&mdash;to how Mr. Featherstone
  shuffled and dealt. The truth is, I had suddenly become very curious about
  Mr. Featherstone. I had recalled his great politeness of manner. I remarked
  his face, which was of an almost girlish delicacy. I reflected that here was
  a man in a great hurry to travel by the same road as myself, and I remembered
  how I had learned that trick by which he had tried to outwit me of my horse.
  Even as it was I had all but fallen into the trap. I should most certainly
  have done so had not Lieutenant Clutterbuck once explained it to me on a
  particular occasion. I remembered that occasion very clearly as I sat on the
  bed playing this game of picquet by the light of a single candle, and I
  wondered whether I could fit Mr. Featherstone with another name.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said he, "that this is a capote," as I played my last
  card.</p>

  <p>"But the loss is trifling," said I, "and I have kept my horse."</p>

  <p>"Very true," said he, whistling softly between his teeth. "You have kept
  your horse," and as I wished him good&mdash;night, he added, "you will be
  careful to shut the door behind you, won't you?"</p>

  <p>But before the words were out of his mouth, he was seized with so violent
  a paroxysm of shivering that he could barely stammer out the end of the
  sentence.</p>

  <p>"These infernal fevers," said he, with a groan.</p>

  <p>"I notice, however," I returned, "that they are intermittent," and
  latching the door as he again requested me, I went off to my own room.</p>

  <p>I could not but wonder what trickery the fire was intended to help, for
  until the last fit of the ague had seized him, he had given no sign of any
  sickness since he had brought out the cards. However, there was a more
  important question to occupy my mind. I had little doubt that Mr.
  Featherstone was Cullen Mayle: I had little doubt that he was hurrying as
  fast as he could to the Scillies, since he had received no answer to the
  message which he sent with the negro. But should I tell him of the men who
  watched for his coming, keeping their watches as at sea? On the one side
  their presence meant danger to Cullen Mayle, it could hardly mean anything
  else; and since it meant danger he should be warned of it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the watchers might have tired of their watching and
  given it up as profitless. Besides I was by no means sure in what light
  Cullen himself was to be regarded. Was his return to Tresco, a prospect to be
  welcomed or deplored? Did he come as a friend to that distracted girl alone
  in the lonely house by the sand? I could not answer these questions. I knew
  Cullen to be a knave, I knew that the girl cared for him, and these two items
  made the sum of my knowledge. I turned over in my bed and fell asleep,
  thinking that my course might be clear to me in the morning.</p>

  <p>And in the morning it was clear. I woke up with a mind made up. I had a
  horse; Cullen travelled on foot; since he had come so far on foot, it was not
  likely that he had the money to purchase a horse, for the story of the
  stumble and the broken leg I entirely disbelieved, and with the best of
  reasons. I had travelled myself along that road yesterday, and I had passed
  no disabled horse upon the way. I had therefore the advantage of Cullen. I
  would journey on without saying a word to him of my destination. I would on
  arriving take council with Dick Parmiter and Helen Mayle and seek to fathom
  the trouble. I should still have time to cross back to the mainland and
  hinder Cullen from attempting the passage.</p>

  <p>Thus I planned to do, but the plan was never put to the test of action.
  For while I was still dressing, a loud hubbub and confusion filled the house.
  I opened my door. The noise came from the direction of Cullen's room. I
  hastily slipped on my coat and ran down the passage. I could hear Cullen's
  voice very loud above the rest, a woman or two protesting with a shrill
  indignation and the landlord trying to make all smooth, though what the
  bother was about I could not distinguish.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the whole household was gathered in the room, though Mr.
  Featherstone still lay abed. The moment that I appeared in the doorway,</p>

  <p>"Ah! here's a witness," he cried. "Mr. Berkeley, you were the last to
  leave me last night. You closed the door behind you? I was particular to ask
  you to close the door?"</p>

  <p>"I remember that very well," said I, "for I was wondering how in the world
  you could put up with the door closed and a blazing fire."</p>

  <p>"There!" cried Featherstone turning to the landlord. "You hear? Mr.
  Berkeley is a gentleman beyond reproach. He shut the door behind him, and
  this morning I find it wide open and my breeches gone. There is a thief, sir,
  in your inn, and we travellers must go on our way without breeches. It is the
  most inconsiderate theft that ever I heard of."</p>

  <p>"As for the breeches, sir," began the landlord.</p>

  <p>"I don't care a button for them," cried Featherstone. "But there was money
  in the breeches' pockets. Fifteen guineas in gold, and a couple of bills on
  Mr. Nossiter, the banker at Exeter."</p>

  <p>"The bills can be stopped," said the landlord. "We are but eighteen miles
  from Exeter."</p>

  <p>"But how am I to travel those miles; do you expect me to walk there in my
  shirt tails. No, I stay here in bed until my breeches are found, and, burn
  me, if I don't eat up everything in the house," and immediately he began to
  roar out for food. "I will have chops at once, and there's a great sirloin of
  beef, and bring me a tankard of small ale."</p>

  <p>Then he turned again to me, and said pathetically,</p>

  <p>"It is not the breeches I mind, though to be sure I shall cut a ridiculous
  figure on the highroad; no, nor the money, though I have not a stiver left.
  But I woke up this morning in the sweetest good-humour, and here am I in a
  violent passion at nine o'clock in the morning, and my whole day spoilt. It
  is so discouraging," and he lay back upon the pillow as though he would have
  wept.</p>

  <p>The landlord offered him his Sunday breeches. They were of red cloth, and
  a belted earl might wear them without shame.</p>

  <p>"But not without discomfort," grumbled Mr. Featherstone, contemplating the
  landlord who was of a large figure. "They will hang about me in swathes like
  a petticoat."</p>

  <p>"And as for the fifteen guineas," said I, "my purse is to that amount at
  your disposal."</p>

  <p>"That is a very gentlemanly offer, Mr. Berkeley," said he, "from one
  stranger to another. But I have a horror of borrowing. I cannot accept your
  munificence. No, I will walk in my host's red cloth breeches as far as
  Rockbere, which to be sure is no more than twelve miles, quite penniless, but
  when I reach my friends, upon my word, I will make such a noise about this
  inn as will close its doors, strike me dead and stiff, if don't."</p>

  <p>His threat had its effect. The landlord, after the usual protestations
  that such an incident had never occurred before, that he had searched the
  house even to the servants' boxes, and that he could make neither head nor
  tail of the business, wound up his harangue with an offer of five
  guineas.</p>

  <p>"It is all I have in the house, sir," said he, "and of course I shall
  charge you neither for food nor lodging."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," said Mr. Featherstone indignantly. "Well, I must make the
  best of it, but oh! I woke up with so happy a disposition towards the world;"
  and dismissing the women he got up and dressed. The landlord fetched the five
  guineas and his red cloth breeches, which Featherstone drew on.</p>

  <p>"Was ever a man so vilely travestied?" he said. "Sure, I shall be taken
  for a Hollander. That is hard for a person of some elegance," and he tied his
  cravat and went grumbling from the room.</p>

  <p>"This is a great misfortune, sir, for me," said my host. "I have lived
  honest all my days. There is no one in the house who would steal; on that I
  would stake my life. I can make nothing of it."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Featherstone is quite recovered from his ague," said I slowly. I
  crossed over to the empty fireplace heaped with the white ashes of the logs
  which had blazed there the night before.</p>

  <p>"The fire no doubt did him some benefit."</p>

  <p>"That is precisely what I was thinking," said I, and I knelt down on the
  hearth-rug and poked amongst the ashes with the shovel. Suddenly, the
  landlord uttered an exclamation and threw up the window. I heard the clatter
  of a horse's hoofs upon the road. I got up from my knees and rushed to the
  window. As I leaned out Mr. Featherstone rode underneath and he rode my
  horse.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" I shouted out.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Berkeley," he cried, airily waving his hand as he rode by, "you may
  hold very good putt cards, but you haven't kept your horse."</p>

  <p>"You damned thief!" I yelled, and he turned in his saddle and put out his
  tongue. It is, if you think of it, a form of repartee to which there is no
  reply. In any case I doubt if I could have made any reply which would have
  reached his ears. For he had set the horse to a gallop and was far down the
  road.</p>

  <p>I went back to the hearth where the landlord joined me. We both knelt down
  and raked away the ashes.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" said I, pointing to something blackened and scorched. The
  landlord picked it up.</p>

  <p>"It is a piece of corduroy."</p>

  <p>"And here's a bone button," said I. "The ague was a sham, the fire a
  device to rob you. He came here without a penny piece and burnt his breeches
  last night. He has robbed you, he has robbed me, and he will reach the Scilly
  Islands first. How far is it to Rockbere?"</p>

  <p>"Twelve miles."</p>

  <p>"I must walk those twelve miles?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Will I get a horse there?"</p>

  <p>"It is doubtful."</p>

  <p>"He has a day's start then at the least."</p>

  <p>So after all, though the horse did not stumble, nor the rider lie quiet by
  the roadside, he did not ride out of the forest at a gallop, and down the
  green bank into the open space beyond.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"><small>CHAPTER VI</small></a><br>
  <br>
  MY FIRST NIGHT UPON TRESCO</h2>

  <p class="first">I walked that day into Rockbere, and taking the advice of
  the innkeeper with whom I lodged, I hired a hack and a guide from him the
  next morning and struck across country for the sea; for he assured me that I
  should most likely find a fishing smack at Topsham whose master would put me
  over to the Scillies, and that if the wind did but favour me I should reach
  the islands sooner that way than if I had the quickest horse under me that
  was ever foaled. It was of the greatest urgency that I should set foot on
  Tresco before Cullen Mayle. I had to risk something to achieve that object,
  and I risked the wind. It was in the northeast when I started from Rockbere
  and suited my purpose finely if it did but hold; so that I much regretted I
  was not already on the sea, and rode in a perpetual fear lest it should
  change its quarter. I came to Honiton Clyst that night, and to Topsham the
  next day, where I was fortunate enough to find a boat of some thirty tons and
  to come to an agreement with its master. He had his crew ready to his hand;
  he occupied the morning in provisioning the smack; and we stood out of the
  harbour in the evening, and with a steady wind on our quarter made a good run
  to the Start Point. Shortly after we passed the Start the wind veered round
  into the north, which did us no great harm, since these boats sail their best
  on a reach. We reached then with a soldier's breeze, as the saying is, out to
  the Eddystone Rock and the Lizard Point.</p>

  <p>It was directly after we had sighted the Lizard that the wind began to
  fall light, and when we were just off the Point it failed us altogether. I
  remember that night as well as any other period in the course of these
  incidents. I was running a race with Cullen Mayle, and I was beginning to
  think that it was not after all only on account of his peril that it was
  needful for me to reach Tresco before he did. These last two days I had been
  entirely occupied with the stimulation of that race and the inspiriting
  companionship of the sea. The waves foaming away from the bows and bubbling
  and hissing under the lee of the boat, the flaws of wind blistering the
  surface of the water as they came off the land towards us, making visible
  their invisible approach; the responsive spring of the boat, like a horse
  under the touch of a spur&mdash;these mere commonplaces to my companions had
  for me an engrossing enchantment. But on that evening at the Lizard Point the
  sea lay under the sunset a smooth, heaving prism of colours; we could hear
  nothing but the groaning of the blocks, the creaking of the boom's collars
  against the masts; and the night came out from behind the land very peaceful
  and solemn, and solemnly the stars shone out in the sky. All the excitement
  of the last days died out of me. We swung up and down with the tide. Now the
  lights of Falmouth were visible to us at the bottom of the bay, now the
  Lizard obscured them from us. I was brought somehow to think of those last
  years of mine in London. They seemed very distant and strange to me in this
  clean air, and the pavement of St. James's Street, which I had daily trodden,
  became an unacceptable thing.</p>

  <p>About two o'clock of the morning a broad moon rose out of the sea, and
  towards daybreak a little ruffing breeze sprang up, and we made a gentle
  progress across the bay towards Land's End; but the breeze sank as the sun
  came up, and all that day we loitered, gaining a little ground now and then
  and losing it again with the turn of the tide. It was not until the fifth
  evening that we dropped anchor in the road between St. Mary's Island and
  Tresco.</p>

  <p>I waited until it was quite dark, and was then quietly rowed ashore with
  my valise in the ship's dinghy. I landed on Tresco near to the harbour of New
  Grimsby. It was at New Grimsby that Dick Parmiter lived, Clutterbuck had told
  me, and the first thing I had to do was to find Dick Parmiter without
  arousing any attention.</p>

  <p>Now on an island like Tresco, sparsely inhabited and with no commerce, the
  mere presence of a stranger would assuredly provoke comment. I walked,
  therefore, very warily towards the village. One house I saw with great
  windows all lighted up, and that I took to be the Palace Inn, where Adam
  Mayle and Cullen used to sit side by side on the settle and surprise the
  visitors by their unlikeness to one another. There was a small cluster of
  cottages about the inn with a lane straggling between, and further away,
  round the curve of the little bay, were two huts close to the sea.</p>

  <p>It would be in one of these that Dick Parmiter lived, and I crept towards
  them. There was no light whatever in the first of them, but the door stood
  open, and a woman and a man stood talking in the doorway. I lay down in the
  grass and crawled towards them, if by any chance I might hear what they said.
  For a while I could distinguish nothing of what they said, but at last the
  man cried in a clear voice, "Good-night, Mrs. Grudge," and walked off to the
  inn. The woman went in and closed the door. I was sure then that the next
  cottage was the one for which I searched. I walked to it; there was a light
  in the window and the sound of voices talking.</p>

  <p>I hesitated whether to go in boldly and ask for Dick. But it would be
  known the next morning that a stranger had come for Dick; no doubt, too,
  Dick's journey to London was known, and the five men watching the house on
  Merchant's Point would be straightway upon the alert. Besides Dick might not
  have reached home. I walked round the hut unable to decide what I should do,
  and as I came to the back of it a light suddenly glowed in a tiny window
  there. I cautiously approached the window and looked through. Dick Parmiter
  was stripping off his jersey, and was alone.</p>

  <p>I tapped on the window. Dick raised his head, and then put out the light,
  so that I could no longer see into the room; but in a moment the window was
  slowly lifted, and the boy's voice whispered:</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Mr. Mayle?"</p>

  <p>I drew a breath of relief. I was ahead of Cullen Mayle, though he had
  stolen my horse.</p>

  <p>"No," said I; "but I have come on Cullen Mayle's business."</p>

  <p>The boy leaned out of the window and peered into my face. But voices were
  raised in the room beyond this cupboard, and a woman's voice cried out,
  "Dick, Dick!"</p>

  <p>"That's mother," said Dick to me. "Wait! I will come out to you."</p>

  <p>He closed the window, and I lay down again in the grass, and waited there
  for perhaps an hour. A mist was coming up from the sea and thickening about
  the island; the starlight was obscured; wreaths of smoke, it seemed, came in
  puffs between myself and the house, and at last I heard the rustling of feet
  in the grass.</p>

  <p>"Dick," said I in a whisper, and the lad came to me.</p>

  <p>"I remember you," he said. "You were at Lieutenant Clutterbuck's. Why have
  you come?"</p>

  <p>"Upon my word," said I, "I should find it difficult to tell you."</p>

  <p>Indeed, it would have taken me half the night to explain the motives which
  had conjoined to this end.</p>

  <p>"And now that you are come, what is it you mean to do?"</p>

  <p>"Dick," I returned, "you ask the most disconcerting questions. You tramp
  up to London with a wild story of a house watched&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You come as a friend, then," he broke in eagerly.</p>

  <p>"As your friend, yes."</p>

  <p>Dick sat silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I think so," he said at length.</p>

  <p>"And here's a trifle to assure you," I said. "Cullen Mayle is not very far
  behind me. You may expect him upon Tresco any morning."</p>

  <p>Dick started to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure of that? You do not know him. How are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Clutterbuck described him to me. I overtook him on the road, and stayed
  the same night with him at an inn. He robbed me and robbed the landlord.
  There was a trick at the cards, too. Not a doubt of it, Cullen Mayle is close
  on my heels. Are those five men still watching the house?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. They are still upon Tresco. They lodge here and there with the
  fishermen, and make a pretence to burn kelp or to fish for their living; but
  their business is to watch the house, as you will see to-night. There are six
  of them now, not five."</p>

  <p>He led me as he spoke towards the "Palace Inn," where a light still burned
  in the kitchen. The cottages about the inn, however, were by this time dark,
  and we could advance without risk of being seen. Dick stopped me under the
  shadow of a wall not ten yards from the inn. A red blind covered the lower
  part of the window, but above it I could see quite clearly into the
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>"Give me a back," whispered Dick, who reached no higher than my shoulder.
  I bent down and Dick climbed on to my shoulders, whence he too could see the
  interior of the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"That will go," said he in a little, and slid to the ground. "Can you see
  a picture on the wall?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And a man sitting under the picture&mdash;a squat, squabby man with white
  hair and small eyes very bright?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That is the sixth man. He came to Tresco while I was in London. I found
  him here when I came back two days ago. But I had seen him before. He had
  come to Tresco before. His name is George Glen."</p>

  <p>"George Glen!" said I. "Wait a bit," and I took another look at the man in
  the kitchen. "He was quartermaster with Adam Mayle at Whydah, eh? He is the
  stranger you brought over to St. Mary's Church on the day when Cullen Mayle
  sat in the stocks."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Dick, and he asked me how I knew.</p>

  <p>"Clutterbuck told me," I replied.</p>

  <p>From the inn we walked some few yards along a lane until we were free of
  the cottages, and then leaving the path, mounted inland up a hill of gorse.
  Dick gave me on the way an account of his journey homewards and the
  difficulties he had surmounted. I paid only an indifferent attention to his
  story, for I was wholly occupied with George Glen's presence upon the island.
  Glen had come first of all to visit Adam Mayle, and was now watching for
  Cullen. What link was there between his two visits? I was inclined to think
  that George Glen was the clue to the whole mystery. In spite of my
  inattention, I gathered this much however from Dick. That tramp of his to
  London was well known throughout the islands. His mother had given him up for
  dead when he went away, and had thrashed him soundly when he returned, but
  the next day had made him out a great hero in her talk. She did not know why
  he went to London, for Dick had the discretion to hold his tongue upon that
  point.</p>

  <p>So much Parmiter had told me when he suddenly stopped and listened. I
  could hear nothing, however much I strained my ears, and in a moment or two
  Dick began to move on. The mist was very thick about us&mdash;I could not see
  a yard beyond my nose; but we were now going down hill, so that I knew we had
  crossed the ridge of the island and were descending towards the harbour of
  New Grimsby and the house under Merchant's Rock.</p>

  <p>We had descended for perhaps a couple of hundred yards; then Dick stopped
  again. He laid a hand upon my arm and dragged me down among the gorse, which
  was drenched with the fog.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Hush," he whispered; and even as he whispered I saw a sort of brown
  radiance through the fog a long way to my left. The next instant a speck of
  clear light shone out in the heart of this radiance: it was the flame of a
  lantern, and it seemed miles away. I raised myself upon my elbows to watch
  it. Dick pulled my elbow from beneath me, and pressed me down flat in the
  grass; and it was fortunate that he did, for immediately the lantern loomed
  out of the fog not a dozen yards away. I heard it rattle as it swung, and the
  man who carried it tramped by so near to me that if I had stretched out my
  hand I could have caught him by the ankle and jerked him off his feet. It was
  the purest good fortune that he did not detect us, and we lay very still
  until the rustle of the footsteps had altogether died away.</p>

  <p>"Is that one of them?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes; William Blads. He lodges with Mrs. Crudge next to our cottage."</p>

  <p>We continued to descend through the gorse for another quarter of an hour
  or so until an extraordinary sound at our feet brought us both to an halt. It
  was the strangest melancholy screeching sound that ever I had heard: it was
  so harsh it pierced the ears; it was so wild and eerie that I could hardly
  believe a voice uttered it. It was like a shrill cry of pain uttered by some
  live thing that was hardly human. It startled me beyond words, and the more
  so because it rose out of the fog directly at our feet. Dick Parmiter
  trembled at my side.</p>

  <p>"Quick," he whispered in a shaking voice; "let us go! Oh, let us go!"</p>

  <p>But he could not move for all his moaning. His limbs shook as though he
  had the fever; terror chained him there to the ground. Had I not known the
  boy under other circumstances, I should have set him down for a coward.</p>

  <p>I took a step forward. Dick caught hold of my arm and muttered something,
  but his voice so wavered and gasped I could not distinguish what he said. I
  shook his arm off, and again stepped forward for one, two, three paces. As I
  took the third pace the ground suddenly sloped, my feet slipped on the wet
  grass; I let go of my valise, and I fell to my full length upon my back, and
  slid. And the moment I began to slide my feet touched nothing. I caught at
  the grass, and the roots of it came away in my hands. I turned over on my
  face. Half my body was now hanging over the edge. I hung for a second by my
  waist, and as I felt my waist slipping, I struck out wildly upon each side
  with my arms. My right arm struck against a bush of gorse; I seized hold of
  it, and it bent, but it did not break. I lifted a knee carefully, set it on
  the edge, and so crawled up the slope again.</p>

  <p>Dick was lying on his face peering down towards me.</p>

  <p>"My God," said he, "I thought you had fallen;" and reaching out his hands,
  he caught both my arms as though he was afraid I should slip again. "Oh,
  quick," he said, "let us go!"</p>

  <p>And again I heard the shrill screech rise up from that hollow into which I
  had so nearly fallen. It was repeated and repeated with a regular interval
  between&mdash;an interval long enough for Dick to reiterate his eager
  prayer.</p>

  <p>"It has begun again," said I.</p>

  <p>"It has never ceased since we first heard it," said Dick, and no doubt he
  spoke the truth; only I had been deaf to it from the moment my foot slipped
  until now. "Let us go," and picking up my valise he hurried me away, turning
  his head as he went, shuddering whenever he heard that cry.</p>

  <p>"But it may be some one in distress&mdash;some one who needs help."</p>

  <p>"No, no," he cried; "it is no one. I will tell you to-morrow."</p>

  <p>We skirted the top of the hollow, and once more descended. The fog showed
  no sign of clearing, but Parmiter walked with an assured tread, and in a
  little time he began to recover his spirits.</p>

  <p>"We are close to the house," said he.</p>

  <p>"Dick, you are afraid of ghosts," said I; and while I spoke he uttered a
  cry and clung to my arm. A second later something brushed past my hand very
  quickly. I just saw it for an instant as it flitted past, and then the
  darkness swallowed it up.</p>

  <p>Dick blurted out this fable: the souls of dead drowned sailormen kept
  nightly tryst on Castle Down.</p>

  <p>"That was no spirit," said I. "Play the man, Dick. Did you ever meet a
  spirit that trod with the weight of a body?"</p>

  <p>I could hear the sound of feet rustling the grass beneath us. Dick
  listened with his hand to his ear.</p>

  <p>"The tread is very light," said he.</p>

  <p>"That is because it is a woman who treads."</p>

  <p>"No woman would be abroad here in this fog at this time," he
  protested.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, it was a woman; for I saw her, and her dress brushed
  against my hand. It was a woman, and you cried out at her; so that if there
  is any one else upon the watch to-night, it is very likely we shall have him
  upon our heels."</p>

  <p>That argument sobered him, and we went forward again without speaking to
  each other, and only halting now and again to listen. In a very short while
  we heard the sea booming upon the beach, and then Dick stepped forward yet
  more warily, feeling about with his hands.</p>

  <p>"There should be a fence hereabouts," said he, and the next moment I fell
  over it with a great clatter. A loud whistle sounded from the
  beach&mdash;another whistle answered behind us, and I heard the sound of a
  man running up from the sand. We both crouched in the grass close by the
  palisade, and again the fog saved us. I heard some one beating about in the
  grass with a stick, but he did not come near us, and at last he turned back
  to the sea.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Dick, "I told Lieutenant Clutterbuck the truth. The house
  is watched."</p>

  <p>"Devil a doubt of it," said I. "Do you go forward and see if you can get
  in."</p>

  <p>He came back to me in a little space of time, saying that the door was
  barred, and that he could see no light through any chink. He had stolen all
  round the house; he had rapped gently here and there at a window, but there
  was no one waking.</p>

  <p>"And what are we to do now?" said he. "If I make a clatter and rouse the
  house, we shall rouse Cullen's enemies, too."</p>

  <p>"It would not be wise to put them on the alert, the more particularly
  since Cullen Mayle may be here to-morrow. I will go back to the 'Palace' Inn,
  sleep the night there, and come over here boldly in the morning." And I got
  up and shouldered my valise again. But Dick stopped me.</p>

  <p>"I have a better plan than that," said he, "for George Glen is staying at
  the 'Palace' Inn. What if you slept in the house here to-night! I can come
  over early to-morrow and tell Miss Helen who you are, and why you have
  come."</p>

  <p>"But how am I to get into the house, without you rouse the household?"</p>

  <p>"There is a window. It is the window of Cullen Mayle's room. You could get
  through it with my help."</p>

  <p>It seemed in many ways the best plan that could be thought of, but certain
  words of Clutterbuck's that my meddling at all in the matter would be nothing
  but an impertinence came back very forcibly to me. But I heard Dick Parmiter
  speaking, and the thought slipped instantly from my mind.</p>

  <p>"I helped Cullen Mayle through the window, the night his father drove him
  from the house," said he, "and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's that you say?" I asked eagerly. "The night that Cullen Mayle was
  driven from the house, he climbed back into his room!"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it, and be quick!" said I. I had my own reason for urging
  him, and I listened with all my attention to every word he spoke. He told me
  the sequel of the story which Clutterbuck had related in my lodging at St.
  James's Street.</p>

  <p>"I was waiting for him outside here on the beach," said he; "and when the
  door was closed behind him, he came straight towards me. 'And where am I to
  sleep to-night, Dick?' said he. I told him that he could have my bed over at
  New Grimsby, but he refused it. 'I'm damned if I sleep in a rat-hole,' he
  said, 'when by putting my pride in my pocket I can sleep in my own bed; and
  with my help he clambered on to an outhouse, and so back into his own
  room."</p>

  <p>"When did he leave the island, then?" I asked. "The next morning? But no
  one saw him go?"</p>

  <p>"No," answered Dick. "I sailed him across the same night. About three
  o'clock of the morning he came and tapped softly upon my window, just as you
  did to-night. It was that which made me think you were Cullen come back. He
  bade me slip out to him without any noise, and together we carried my
  father's skiff down to the water. I sailed him across to St. Mary's. He made
  me swear never to tell a word of his climbing back into his room."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he made you swear that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he said he would rip my heart out if I broke my oath. Well, I've
  kept it till to-night. No one knows but you. I got back to Tresco before my
  father had stirred."</p>

  <p>"And Cullen?"</p>

  <p>"A barque put out from St. Mary's to Cornwall with the first of the ebb in
  the morning. I suppose he persuaded the captain to take him."</p>

  <p>Parmiter's story set me thinking, and I climbed over the palisade after
  him without further objection. He came to a wall of planks; Dick set himself
  firmly against it and bent his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"This is an outhouse," said he. "From my shoulders you can reach the roof.
  From the roof you can reach the window. You can force the catch of the window
  with a knife."</p>

  <p>"It will be an awkward business," said I doubtfully, "if I wake the
  house."</p>

  <p>"There is no fear of that," answered Dick. "With any other window I would
  not say no. The other rooms are separated only by a thin panelling of wood,
  and at one end of the house you can almost hear a mouse scamper at the other.
  Mr. Cullen's room, however, is a room built on, its inner wall is the outer
  wall of the house, it is the one room where you could talk secrets and run no
  risk of being overheard."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said I slowly, for this speech too set me thinking. "I will
  risk it. Come over early to-morrow, Dick. I shall cut an awkward figure
  without you do," and getting on to his shoulder, I clambered up on to the
  roof of the outhouse. He handed my valise to me; I pushed back the catch of
  the window with the blade of my knife, lifted it, threw my leg over the sill
  and silently drew myself into the room. The room was very dark, but my eyes
  were now accustomed to the gloom. I could dimly discern a great four-poster
  bed. I shut the window without noise, set my valise in a corner, drew off my
  boots and lay down upon the bed.</p>

     name="ch7"><small>CHAPTER VII</small></a><br>
  <br>
  TELLS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENT<br>
  IN CULLEN MAYLE'S BEDROOM</h2>

  <p class="first">I was very tired, but in spite of my fatigue it was some
  while before I fell asleep. Parmiter had thrown a new light upon the business
  tonight, and by the help of that light I arrayed afresh my scanty knowledge.
  The strangeness of my position, besides, kept me in some excitement. Here was
  I quietly abed in a house where I knew no one; Clutterbuck might well talk
  about impertinence, and I could not but wonder what in the world I should
  find to say if Dick was late in the morning. Finally, there was the adventure
  of that night. I felt myself again slipping down the wet grass and dangling
  over the precipice. I heard again that unearthly screeching which had so
  frightened Dick and perplexed me, It perplexed me still. I could not for a
  moment entertain Dick's supposition of a spirit. This was the middle of the
  eighteenth century, you will understand, and I had come fresh from London.
  Ghosts and bogies might do very well for the island of Tresco, but Mr.
  Berkeley was not to be terrified with any such old-wives' stories, and so Mr.
  Berkeley fell asleep.</p>

  <p>At what precise hour the thing happened I do not know. The room was so
  dark that I could not have read my watch, even if I had looked at it, which I
  did not think to do. But at some time during that night I woke up quite
  suddenly with a clear sense that I had been waked up.</p>

  <p>I sat up in my bed with my heart beating very quick; and then with as a
  little noise as I could I gathered myself up in the shadow of the
  bed-hangings, at the head. The fog was still thick about the house, so that
  hardly a glimmer of light came from the window. But there was some one in the
  room I knew, for I could hear a rustle as of stealthy movements. And then
  straight in front of me between the two posts of the bed-foot, I saw
  something white that wavered and swayed this way and that. Only an hour or so
  before I had been boasting to myself that I was London-bred and lived in the
  middle of the eighteenth century. But none the less my hair stirred upon my
  head, and all the moisture dried up in my throat as I stared at that dim
  white thing wavering and swaying between the bed-posts. It was taller than
  any human being that I had seen. I remembered the weird screeching sound
  which I had heard in the hollow; I think that in my heart I begged Dick
  Parmiter's pardon for laughing at his fears; I know that I crouched back
  among the hangings and shuddered till the bed shook and shook again. And then
  it made a sound, and all the blood in my veins stood still. I thought that my
  heart would stop or my brain burst. For the sound was neither a screech like
  that which rose from the hollow, nor a groan, nor any ghostly noise. It was
  purely human, it was a kecking sound in the throat, such as one makes who
  gasps for breath. The white thing was a live thing of flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>I sprang up on the bed and jumped to the foot of it. It was very dark in
  the room, but through the darkness, I could see, on a level with my face, the
  face of a woman. Her eyes were open and they stared into mine. I could see
  the whites of them; our heads were so near they almost touched.</p>

  <p>Even then I did not understand. I wondered what it was on which she stood.
  I noticed a streak of white which ran straight up towards the ceiling from
  behind her head, and I wondered what that was. And then suddenly her body
  swung against my legs. She was standing on nothing whatever! Again the queer
  gasping coughing noise broke from her lips, and at last I understood it. It
  was a gasp of a woman strangling to death. That white stiff streak above her
  head&mdash;I knew what it was too. I caught her by the waist and lifted her
  up till her weight rested upon my arm. With the other arm I felt about her
  neck. A thick soft scarf&mdash;silk it seemed to the touch&mdash;was knotted
  tightly round it, and the end of the scarf ran up to the cross-beam above the
  bed-posts. The scarf was the streak of white.</p>

  <p>I fumbled at the knot with my fingers. It was a slip knot, and now that no
  weight kept it taut, it loosened easily. I slipped the noose back over her
  head and left it dangling. The woman I laid down upon the bed, where she lay
  choking and moaning.</p>

  <p>I flung up the window and the cold fog poured into the room. I had no
  candle to light and nothing wherewith to light it. But I remembered that my
  foot had knocked against a chair to the right of the window, as I climbed
  into the room. I groped for the chair and set it to face the open night. Then
  I carried the woman to the window and placed her in the chair, and supported
  her so that she might not fall. Outside I could hear the surf booming upon
  the sand almost within arm's reach, and the air was brisk with the salt of
  the sea.</p>

  <p>Such light as there was, glimmered upon the woman's face. I saw that she
  was young, little more than a girl indeed, with hair and eyes of an extreme
  blackness. She was of a slight figure as I knew from the ease with which I
  carried her, but tall. I could not doubt who it was, for one thing the white
  dress she wore was of some fine soft fabric, and even in that light it was
  easy to see that she was beautiful.</p>

  <p>I held her thus with the cold salt air blowing upon her face, and in a
  little, she began to recover. She moved her hands upon her lap, and finally
  lifted one and held her throat with it.</p>

  <p>"Very likely there will be some water in the room," said I. "If you are
  safe, if you will not fall, I will look for it."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she murmured.</p>

  <p>My presence occasioned her no surprise and this I thought was no more than
  natural at the moment. I took my arm from her waist and groped about the room
  for the water-jug. I found it at last and a glass beside it. These I carried
  back to the window.</p>

  <p>The girl was still seated on the chair, but she had changed her attitude.
  She had leaned her arms upon the sill and her head upon her arms. I poured
  out the water from the jug into the tumbler. She did not raise her head. I
  spoke to her. She did not answer me. A horrible fear turned me cold. I knelt
  down by her side, and setting down the water gently lifted her head. She did
  not resist but sank back with a natural movement into my arms. Her eyes were
  closed, but she was breathing. I could feel her breath upon my cheek and it
  came steadily and regular. I cannot describe my astonishment; she was in a
  deep sleep.</p>

  <p>I pondered for a moment what I should do! Should I wake the household?
  Should I explain what had happened and my presence in the house? For Helen
  Mayle's sake I must not do that, since Helen Mayle it surely was whom I held
  in my arms.</p>

  <p>I propped her securely in the chair, then crossed the room, opened the
  door and listened. The house was very still; so far no one had been
  disturbed. A long narrow passage stretched in front of me, with doors upon
  either side. Remembering what Dick Parmiter had told me, I mean that every
  sound reverberated through the house, I crept down the landing on tiptoe. I
  had only my stockings upon my feet and I crept forward so carefully that I
  could not hear my own footfalls.</p>

  <p>I had taken some twenty paces when the passage opened out to my right. I
  put out my hand and touched a balustrade. A few yards farther on the
  balustrade ceased; there was an empty space which I took to be the beginning
  of the stairs, and beyond the empty space the passage closed in again.</p>

  <p>I crept forward, and at last at the far end of the house and on the left
  hand of the passage I came to that for which I searched, and which I barely
  hoped to find&mdash;an open door. I held my breath and listened in the
  doorway, but there was no sound of any one breathing, so I stepped into the
  room.</p>

  <p>The fog was less dense, it hung outside the window a thin white mist and
  behind that mist the day was breaking. I looked round the room. It was a
  large bedroom, and the bed had not been slept in. A glance at the toilette
  with its dainty knick-knacks of silver proved to me that it was a woman's
  bedroom. It had two big windows looking out towards the sea, and as I stood
  in the dim grey light, I wondered whether it was from one of those windows
  that Adam Mayle had looked years before, and seen the brigantine breaking up
  upon the Golden Ball Reef. But the light was broadening with the passage of
  every minute. With the same caution which I had observed before I stole back
  on tiptoe to Cullen Mayle's room. Helen Mayle was still asleep, and she had
  not moved from her posture. I raised her in my arms, and still she did not
  wake. I carried her down the passage, through the open door and laid her on
  the bed. There was a coverlet folded at the end of the bed and I spread it
  over her. She nestled down beneath it and her lips smiled very prettily, and
  she uttered a little purring murmur of content; but this she did in her
  sleep. She slept with the untroubled sleep of a child. Her face was pale, but
  that I took to be its natural complexion. Her long black eyelashes rested
  upon her cheeks. There was no hint of any trouble in her expression, no trace
  of any passionate despair. I could hardly believe that this was the girl who
  had sought to hang herself, whom I had seen struggling for her breath.</p>

  <p>Yet there was no doubt possible. She had come into the empty
  room&mdash;empty as she thought, and empty it would have been, had not a
  fisher-boy burst one night into Lieutenant Clutterbuck's lodging off the
  Strand&mdash;when every one slept, and there she had deliberately stood upon
  the bed, fastened her noose to the cross-bar and sprang off. There was no
  doubt possible. It was her spring from the bed which had waked me up, and as
  I returned to Cullen's room, I saw the silk noose still hanging from the
  beam.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"><small>CHAPTER VIII</small></a><br>
  <br>
  HELEN MAYLE</h2>

  <p class="first">A loud rapping on the door roused me. The mist had cleared
  away, and out of the open window I could see a long sunlit slope of gorse all
  yellow and purple stretching upwards, and over the slope a great space of
  blue sky whereon the clouds sailed like racing boats in a strong breeze. The
  door was thrust open and Dick Parmiter entered.</p>

  <p>"You keep London hours, sir," said he, standing at the foot of the bed,
  and he happened to raise his eyes. "What's that?" he asked.</p>

  <p><i>That</i> was the silk scarf still dangling from the cross- bar, and the
  sight of it brought back to me in a flash my adventure of the night. With the
  clear sunlight filling the room and the bright wind chasing the clouds over
  the sky, I could hardly believe that it had really occurred. But the silk
  scarf hung between the posts.</p>

  <p>"My God," I cried out. "What if I had never waked up!"</p>

  <p>There would have been the sunlight and the wind in the sky as now, but,
  facing me, no longer swaying, but still, inert, horrible, I should have
  seen&mdash;and I clapped my hands over my face, so distinct was this
  unspeakable vision to me, and cried out again: "What if I had not waked
  up!</p>

  <p>"You have not waked up very early," said Dick, looking at me curiously,
  and recovering my self-possession I hasten to explain.</p>

  <p>"I have had dreams, Dick. The strange room! I am barely awake yet."</p>

  <p>It appeared that I was not the only one to keep London hours that morning.
  It was close upon mid-day and Dick had not waked me before, because he had
  not before had speech with the mistress of the house. Helen Mayle had risen
  late. But she knew now of my presence in the house and what had brought me,
  and was waiting to offer me her thanks.</p>

  <p>In spite of this news that she was waiting, I made my toilette very
  slowly. It would be the most awkward, embarrassing meeting imaginable. How
  could one bow and smile and exchange the trivial courtesies with a girl whom
  one had saved from that silk noose some eight hours before? With what
  countenance would she greet me? Would she resent my interference? Dick,
  however, had plainly noticed nothing unusual in her demeanour; I consoled
  myself with that reflection. He noticed, however, something unusual here in
  my room, for as I tied my cravat before the mirror I saw that he was
  curiously looking at the silk scarf.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have seen it before," said I without turning round. Dick
  started, then he coloured.</p>

  <p>"I was wondering why it hung there," said he.</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> curious," said I calmly, and I stood upon the bed and with
  some trouble, for the knots were stiff, I took it down and thrust it into the
  pocket of my coat.</p>

  <p>"It is yours?" cried Dick.</p>

  <p>"One silk scarf is very like another," said I, and he coloured again and
  was silent. His silence was fortunate, since if he had asked to what end I
  had hung it above my bed, I should have been hard put to it for an
  answer.</p>

  <p>"I am ready," said I, and we walked along the passage to the balustrade,
  and the head of the stairs where I had crept on tiptoe during the night.</p>

  <p>I noticed certain marks, a few dents, a few scratches on the panels of the
  wall at the head of the stairs, and I was glad to notice them, for they
  reminded me of the business upon which I had come and of certain conjectures
  which Dick had suggested to my mind. It was at the head of the stairs that
  Adam Mayle had stood when he drove out his son. The marks no doubt were the
  marks of that handful of guineas which Cullen had flung to splatter and
  sparkle against the wall behind his father's head. I was glad to notice them,
  as I say, for the tragical incident in which I had borne a share that night
  had driven Cullen Mayle's predicament entirely from my thoughts.</p>

  <p>I saw the flutter of a dress at the foot of the stairs, and a face looked
  up to mine. It was the face which I had seen on a level with mine in the
  black gloom of the night, and as I saw it now in the clear light of day, I
  stopped amazed. It wore no expression of embarrassment, no plea for silence.
  She met me with a grateful welcome in her eyes as for one who had come
  unexpectedly to do her a service, and perhaps a hint of curiosity as to why I
  should have come at all.</p>

  <p>"Dick has told me of you," she said, as she held out her hand. "You are
  very kind. Until this morning I did not even know the reason of Dick's
  journey to London. I was not aware that he had paid a visit to Lieutenant
  Clutterbuck."</p>

  <p>There was a trifle of awkwardness in her voice as she pronounced his name.
  I could not help feeling and no doubt expressing some awkwardness as I heard
  it. Lieutenant Clutterbuck had not hesitated to accuse her of duplicity; I at
  all events could not but acknowledge that she was excellently versed in the
  woman's arts of concealment. There was thus a moment's silence before I
  answered.</p>

  <p>"You will accept me I hope as Lieutenant Clutterbuck's proxy."</p>

  <p>"We had no right," she returned, "to expect any service from Lieutenant
  Clutterbuck, much less from&mdash;&mdash;" and she hesitated and stopped
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"From a stranger you would have said," I added.</p>

  <p>"We shall count you a stranger no longer," she said, with a frank smile,
  and that I might not be outdone in politeness, I said:</p>

  <p>"If Dick had lacked discretion and told you all that he might have told,
  you would understand that the obligation is upon my side. For whereas I do
  not know that I can render you any service whatever, I do know that already
  you have rendered me a great one."</p>

  <p>"That is very prettily said," she returned, as she walked into the
  parlour.</p>

  <p>"Truth at times," I answered lightly as I followed her, "can be as pretty
  as the most ingenious lie."</p>

  <p>So that first awkward meeting was past. I took my cue from her reticence,
  but without her success. I could not imitate her complete unconsciousness. It
  seemed she had no troubles. She sat at the table in a flow of the highest
  spirits. Smiles came readily to her lips, and her eyes laughed in unison. She
  was pale and the pallor was the more marked on account of her dark hair and
  eyes, but the blood came and went in her cheeks, and gave to her an infinite
  variety of expression. I could hardly believe that this voice which was now
  lively with contentment was the voice which had uttered that kecking sound in
  the night, or that the eyes which now sparkled and flashed were the eyes
  which had stared at me through the gloom. No doubt I looked at her with more
  curiosity than was convenient; at all events she said, with a laugh:</p>

  <p>"I would give much to know what picture Dick painted of me, for if I may
  judge from your looks, Mr. Berkeley, the likeness is very unlike to the
  original."</p>

  <p>I felt my cheeks grow hot, and cast about for a reason to excuse my
  curiosity. Her own words suggested the reason.</p>

  <p>"Dick told me," I said, "of a woman in great distress and perplexity,
  whose house was watched, who dreaded why it was watched&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you find a woman on the top of her spirits," she broke in, and was
  silent for a little, looking at the cloth. "And very likely," she continued
  slowly, "you are disposed to think that you have been misled and persuaded
  hither for no more than a trivial purpose."</p>

  <p>"No," I protested. "No such thought occurred to me," and in my anxiety to
  free myself from the suspicion of this imputation I broke through that
  compact of silence upon which we seemed silently to have agreed. "I have no
  reason for pride, God knows, but indeed. Madam, I am not so utterly
  despicable as to regret that I came to Tresco and crept into your house last
  night. Already,&mdash;suppose there was nothing more for me to do but to wish
  you a good-morning and betake myself back to town&mdash;already I have every
  reason to be glad that I came, for if I had not come&mdash;&mdash;" and I
  stopped.</p>

  <p>Helen Mayle listened to me with some surprise of manner at the earnestness
  with which I spoke and when I stopped so abruptly, she blushed and her eyes
  again sought the table.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said quietly, "Mr. Berkeley, you have guessed the reason of my
  good spirits. If you had not come, a woman in great distress and perplexity
  would be wandering restlessly about the house, as she did yesterday."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were still fixed upon the table, or she must have remarked my
  astonishment and the pretence would at once and for all have been torn away
  from between us. I leaned back in my chair; it was as much as I could do to
  stifle an exclamation. If I had not come, a woman's spirit might be wandering
  to-day restlessly from room to room, but the woman&mdash;I had the silk scarf
  in my coat-pocket to assure me she would not.</p>

  <p>"The distress and perplexity," she continued, "are not done with, but
  to-day a hand has been stretched to me out of the dark, and I must think, to
  some good end. It could not be otherwise," and she lifted her eyes to mine. I
  did not doubt their sincerity. "And&mdash;shall I tell you?" she continued
  with a frank smile. "I am glad, though I hardly know why&mdash;I am glad that
  the man who stretched out his hand was quite unknown to me and himself knew
  nothing of me, and had not so much as seen my face. He helps a woman, not
  <i>one</i> woman. I am more grateful for that, I take it to be of good
  augury." And she held her hand to me.</p>

  <p>I took the hand; I was tempted to let her remain in her misapprehension.
  But sooner or later she would learn the truth, and it seemed to me best that
  she should learn something of it from me.</p>

  <p>"Madam," I said, "I should account myself happy if I could honestly agree,
  but I fear it was not on a woman's account that I travelled down to Tresco.
  Dick I think had something to do with it, but chiefly I came to do myself a
  service."</p>

  <p>"Well," she answered as she rose and crossed to the window "that may be.
  You are here at all events, in the house that is watched" and then she
  suddenly called me to her side. "Look," said she, "but keep well behind the
  curtain."</p>

  <p>I looked across the water to a brown pile of rocks which was named
  Norwithel, and beyond Norwithel over St. Helen's Pool to the island of St.
  Helen's.</p>

  <p>"Do you see?" she asked.</p>

  <p>I saw the bare rock, the purple heather of St. Helen's, to the right a
  wide shining beach of Tean, and to the left stretching out into the sea from
  the end of St. Helen's a low ridge of rocks like a paved causeway. I pointed
  to that causeway.</p>

  <p>"That is the Golden Ball Reef," said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered, "Dick told you the story. You would not see the reef,
  but that the tide is low. But it is not that I wanted to show you. See!" and
  she stretched out her hand towards the rock pile of Norwithel.</p>

  <p>I looked there again and at last I saw a man moving on the rocks close by
  the sea.</p>

  <p>"He is cutting the weed," said I.</p>

  <p>"That is the pretence," said she. "But so long as he stays there no one
  can enter this house without he knows, no one can go out without he
  knows."</p>

  <p>"Unless one goes in or out by the door I used."</p>

  <p>"That door is within view of the Castle Down. There will be some man
  smoking his pipe, stretched on the grass of the Castle Down."</p>

  <p>"You have never spoken to them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! They wanted nothing of me. They only watch. I know for whom they
  watch. I could learn nothing by questioning them."</p>

  <p>"Have you asked Captain Hathaway's help?"</p>

  <p>Helen smiled.</p>

  <p>"No. What could he do? They do no one any hurt. They stand out of my way
  when I pass. And besides&mdash;I am afraid. I do not know. If these men were
  questioned closely by some one in authority, what story might they have to
  tell and what part in that story does Cullen play?"</p>

  <p>I hesitated for a few moments whether to risk the words which were on my
  lips. I made an effort and spoke them.</p>

  <p>"You will pardon the question&mdash;I have once met Cullen Mayle&mdash;and
  is he worth all this anxiety?"</p>

  <p>"He had a strange upbringing in this house. There is much to excuse him in
  the eyes of any one. And for myself I cannot forget that all which people say
  is mine, is more rightly his."</p>

  <p>She spoke very gently about Cullen, as I had indeed expected that she
  would, but with sufficient firmness to prove to me that it was not worth
  while to continue upon this strain.</p>

  <p>"And the negro?" I asked. "He has not spoken?"</p>

  <p>For answer she led me up the stairs, and into a room which opened upon the
  landing. The negro lay in bed and asleep. The flesh had shrivelled off his
  bones, his face was thin and peaked, and plainly his days were numbered.
  Helen leaned over the bed, spoke to him and pressed upon his shoulder. The
  negro opened his eyes. Never in my life had I seen anything so melancholy as
  their expression. The conviction of his helplessness was written upon them
  and I think too an appeal for forgiveness that he had not discharged his
  mission.</p>

  <p>"Speak to him," said Helen. "Perhaps a stranger's voice may rouse him if
  only to speak two words."</p>

  <p>I spoke to him as she bade me; a look of intelligence came into the
  negro's face; I put a question to him.</p>

  <p>"Why does George Glen watch for Cullen Mayle?"&mdash; and before I had
  completed the sentence his eyelids closed languidly over his eyes and he was
  asleep. I looked at him as he lay there, an emaciated motionless figure, the
  white bedclothes against his ebony skin, and as I thought of his long travels
  ending so purposelessly in this captivity of sleep, I was filled with a great
  pity. Helen uttered a moan, she turned towards me wringing her hands.</p>

  <p>"And there's our secret," she cried, "the secret which we must know and
  which this poor negro burns to tell and it's locked up within him! Bolts and
  bars," she burst out, "what puny things they seem! One can break bolts, one
  can sever bars, but a secret buried within a man, how shall one unearth
  it?"</p>

  <p>It just occurred to me that she stopped with unusual abruptness, but I was
  looking at the negro, I was still occupied with pity.</p>

  <p>"Heaven send my journey does not end so vainly as his," I said solemnly. I
  turned to Helen and I saw that she was staring at me with a great
  astonishment, and concern for which I could not account.</p>

  <p>"I have a conjecture to tell you of," said I, "I do not know that it is of
  value."</p>

  <p>"Let us go downstairs," she replied, "and you shall tell me," but she
  spoke slowly as though she was puzzled with some other matter. As we went
  downstairs I heard Dick Parmiter's voice and could understand the words he
  said. I stopped.</p>

  <p>"Where is Dick?"</p>

  <p>"Most likely in the kitchen."</p>

  <p>When we were come to the foot of the stairs I asked where the kitchen
  was?</p>

  <p>"At the end of that passage across the hall," she answered.</p>

  <p>Upon that I called Dick. I heard a door open and shut, and Dick came into
  the hall.</p>

  <p>"The kitchen door was closed," said I, "I do not know but what my
  conjecture may have some value after all."</p>

  <p>Helen Mayle walked into the parlour, Dick followed her. As I crossed the
  hall my coat caught on the back of a chair. Whilst I was disengaging my coat,
  I noticed that an end of the white scarf was hanging from my pocket and that
  the initials "H. M." were embroidered upon it. I recollected then how Helen
  Mayle had abruptly ended her outcry concerning the bolts and bars, and how
  she had looked at me and how she had spoken. Had she noticed the scarf? I
  thrust it back into my pocket and took care that the flap of the pocket
  should hide it completely. Then I, too, went into the parlour. But as I
  entered the room I saw then Helen's eyes went at once to my pocket. She had,
  then, noticed the scarf. It seemed, however, that she was no longer perplexed
  as to how I came by it. But, on the other hand, it was my turn to be
  perplexed. For, as she raised her eyes from my pocket, our glances crossed.
  It was evident to her that I had detected her look and understood it. Yet she
  smiled&mdash;without any embarrassment; it was as though she thought I had
  stolen her scarf for a favour and she forgave the theft. And then she
  blushed. That, however, she was very ready to do upon all occasions.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"><small>CHAPTER IX</small></a><br>
  <br>
  TELLS OF A STAIN UPON A WHITE FROCK,<br>
  AND A LOST KEY</h2>

  <p class="first">Helen drew a chair to the table and waited with her hands
  folded before her.</p>

  <p>"Dick," said I, turning to the lad, who stood just within the door, "that
  oath of yours."</p>

  <p>"I have broken it already," said he.</p>

  <p>"There was never priest in the world who would refuse to absolve you. The
  virtue of it lies in the forswearing. Now!" and I turned to Helen. "But I
  must speak frankly," I premised.</p>

  <p>She nodded her assent.</p>

  <p>"Very well. I can make a consecutive sort of story, but I may well be at
  fault, for my knowledge is scanty, and if I am in error over the facts, I beg
  you. Miss Mayle, to correct me. Old Mr. Mayle's talk ran continually about
  his wild doings on the Guinea coast, in Africa. There can be no doubt that he
  spent some considerable portion of his life there, and that he managed to
  scrape together a sufficient fortune. It is likely, therefore, that he was
  engaged in the slave trade, and, to be quite frank, Miss Helen, from what I
  have gathered of his manner and style, I am not indisposed to think that he
  found an occasional diversion from that pursuit in a little opportune
  piracy."</p>

  <p>I made the suggestion with some diffidence, for the old man, whatever his
  sins, had saved her life, and shown her much affection, of which, moreover,
  at his death he had given her very tangible proofs. It was necessary for me,
  however, to say it, for I had nothing but suspicion to go upon, and I looked
  to her in some way, either by words or manner, to confirm or confute my
  suspicions. And it seemed to me that she confirmed it, for she simply pressed
  the palms of her hands to her forehead, and said quietly,</p>

  <p>"You are very frank."</p>

  <p>"There is no other way but frankness, believe me," I returned. "Now let us
  come to that Sunday, four years ago, when Cullen Mayle sat in the stocks and
  George Glen came to Tresco. It was you who took George Glen to St. Mary's
  Church," I turned to Dick Parmiter.</p>

  <p>"Yes." said he. "I was kicking my heels in the sand, close to our cottage,
  when he came ashore in a boat. He was most anxious to speak with Mr.
  Mayle."</p>

  <p>"So you carried him across to St. Mary's, and he told you, I think, that
  he had been quartermaster with Adam Mayle at Whydah, on the Guinea
  coast?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did he name the ship by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"He did once, whilst we were at supper," interrupted Helen, "and I
  remember the name very well, for my father turned upon him fiercely when he
  spoke it, and Mr. Glen immediately said that he was mistaken and substituted
  another name, which I have forgotten. The first name was the <i>Royal
  Fortune</i>."</p>

  <p>"The <i>Royal Fortune</i>," said I, thoughtfully. The name in a measure
  was familiar to me; it seemed familiar too in precisely this connection with
  the Guinea coast. But I could not be sure. I was anxious to discover George
  Glen's business with Adam Mayle, and very likely my anxiety misled me into
  imagining clues where there were none. I put the name away in my mind and
  went on with my conjecture.</p>

  <p>"Now on that Sunday George Glen met Adam Mayle in the churchyard, you,
  Miss Mayle, and Lieutenant Clutterbuck were of the party. Together you sailed
  across to Tresco. So that George Glen could have had no private word with Mr.
  Mayle."</p>

  <p>"No," Helen Mayle agreed. "There was no opportunity."</p>

  <p>"Nor was there an opportunity all that afternoon and evening, until Cullen
  left the house."</p>

  <p>"But after Cullen had gone," said she, "they had their opportunity and
  made use of it. I left them together in my father's room.</p>

  <p>"The room fitted up as a cabin, where every word they spoke could be heard
  though the door was shut and the eavesdropper need not even trouble to lay
  his ear to the keyhole."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is true," said Helen. "But the servants were in bed, and there
  was no one to hear."</p>

  <p>At that Dick gave a start and a jump, and I cried:</p>

  <p>"But there was some one to hear. Tell your story, Dick!" and Dick told how
  Cullen Mayle had climbed through the window, and how some hours after he had
  waked him up and sworn him to secrecy.</p>

  <p>"Now, do you see?" I continued. "Why should Cullen Mayle have sworn Dick
  here to silence unless he had discovered some sort of secret which might
  prove of value to himself, unless he had overhead George Glen talking to Adam
  Mayle? And there's this besides. Where has Cullen Mayle been these last two
  years? I can tell you that."</p>

  <p>"You can?" said Helen. She was leaning across the table, her face all
  lighted up with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Yes. There's the negro above stairs for one thing, Cullen's servant. For
  another I met Cullen Mayle on the road as I was travelling here. He
  counterfeited an ague, which he told me he had caught on the Guinea coast.
  The ague was counterfeit, but very likely he has been on the Guinea
  coast."</p>

  <p>"Of course," cried Dick.</p>

  <p>"Not a doubt of it," said Helen.</p>

  <p>"So this is my theory. George Glen came to enlist Adam Mayle's help and
  Adam Mayle's money, in some voyage to Africa. Cullen Mayle overheard it, and
  got the start of George Glen. So here's George Glen back again upon Tresco,
  and watching for Cullen Mayle."</p>

  <p>"See!" cried Helen suddenly. "Did I not tell you you were sent here to a
  good end?"</p>

  <p>"But we are not out of the wood yet," I protested. "We have to discover
  what it was that Glen proposed to Mr. Mayle. How shall we do that?"</p>

  <p>"How?" repeated Helen, and she looked to me confidently for the
  answer.</p>

  <p>"I can think of but one way," said I, "to go boldly to George Glen and
  make terms with him."</p>

  <p>"Would he speak, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Most likely not," I answered, and so in spite of my fine conjecture, we
  did not seem to have come any nearer to an issue. We were both of us silent
  for some while. The very confidence which Helen displayed stung me into an
  activity of thought. Helen herself was sunk in an abstraction, and in that
  abstraction she spoke.</p>

  <p>"You are hurt," she said.</p>

  <p>My right hand was resting upon the table. It was cut in one or two places,
  and covered with scratches.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," said I, "I slipped on the hill yesterday night and cut it
  with the gorse;" and again we fell to silence.</p>

  <p>"What I am thinking is this," she said, at length. "You overtook Cullen
  upon the road, and you reached the islands last night. At any moment then we
  may expect his coming."</p>

  <p>"Why, that's true," said I, springing up to my feet. "And if Dick will
  sail me across to St. Mary's, we'll make a shift to stop him."</p>

  <p>Helen Mayle rose at that moment from her seat. She was wearing a white
  frock, and upon one side of it I noticed for the first time a red smear or
  two, as though she had brushed against paint&mdash;or blood. I looked at my
  hand scratched and torn by the gorse bush. It would have been bleeding at the
  time when a woman, coming swiftly past us in the fog, brushed against it. The
  woman was certainly hurrying in the direction of this house.</p>

  <p>"You have told me everything, I suppose," I said&mdash; "everything at all
  events that it concerns me to know."</p>

  <p>"Everything," she replied.</p>

  <p>We crossed that afternoon to St. Mary's. There was no sign of Cullen Mayle
  at Hugh Town. No one had seen him or heard of his coming. He had not landed
  upon St. Mary's. I thought it possible that he might not have touched St.
  Mary's at all, but rowed ashore to Tresco even as I had done. But no ship had
  put into the Road that day but one which brought Castile soap from
  Marseilles. We sailed back to Tresco, and ran the boat's nose into the sand
  not twenty yards from the door of the house on Merchant's Point. A man, an
  oldish, white-haired man, loitering upon the beach very civilly helped us to
  run the boat up out of the water. We thanked him, and he touched his hat and
  answered with something of a French accent, which surprised me. But as we
  walked up to the house,</p>

  <p>"That's one of the five," Dick explained. "He came on the boat with the
  negro to Penzance. Peter Tortue he is called, and he was loitering there on
  purpose to get a straight look at you."</p>

  <p>"Well," said I, "it is at all events known that I am here," and going into
  the house I found Helen Mayle eagerly waiting for our return. I told her that
  Cullen Mayle could not by any means have yet reached the Scillies, and that
  we had left word with the harbour master upon St. Mary's to detain him if he
  landed; at which she expressed great relief.</p>

  <p>"And since it is known I am here," I added, "it will be more suitable if I
  carry my valise over to New Grimsby and seek a bed at the 'Palace' Inn. I
  shall besides make the acquaintance of Mr. George Glen. It is evident that he
  and his fellows intend no hurt to you, so that you may sleep in peace."</p>

  <p>"No," said she, bravely enough. "I am not afraid for myself."</p>

  <p>"And you will do that?"</p>

  <p>"What?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Sleep in peace," said I; and putting my hand into my pocket as if by
  accident, I let her see again the corner of her white scarf. Her face flushed
  a little as she saw it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," she answered, and to my surprise with the easiest laugh
  imaginable. "I shall sleep in peace. You need have no fear."</p>

  <p>I could not understand her. What a passion of despair it must have needed
  to string her to that act of death last night! Yet to-day&mdash;she could
  even allude to it with a laugh. I was lost in perplexity, but I had this one
  sure thing to comfort me. She was to-day hopeful, however much she despaired
  yesterday. She relied upon me to rescue Cullen from his peril. I was not sure
  that I should be doing her the service she imagined it to be, even if I
  succeeded. But she loved him, and looked to me to help her. So that I, too,
  could sleep in peace without fear that to-night another scarf would be
  fetched out to do the office this one I kept had failed to do.</p>

  <p>I gave Dick my valise to carry across the island, and waited until he was
  out of sight before I started. Then I walked to the palisade at the end of
  the house. I found a spot where the palisade was broken; the splintered wood
  was fresh and clean; it was I who had broken the palisade last night. From
  that point I marched straight up the hill through the gorse, and when I had
  walked for about twenty minutes I stopped and looked about me. I struck away
  to my left, and after a little I stopped again. I marched up and down that
  hill, to the right, to the left, for perhaps the space of an hour, and at
  last I came upon that for which I searched&mdash;a steep slope where the
  grass was crushed, and underneath that slope a sheer descent. On the brink of
  the precipice&mdash;for that I judged it to be&mdash;I saw a broken
  gorse-bush. I lay down on my face and carefully crawled down the slope. The
  roots of the gorse-bush still held firmly in the ground. I clutched it in my
  left hand, dug the nails of my right through the grass into the soil and
  leaned over. My precipice was no more than a hollow some twenty feet deep,
  and had I slipped yesterday night, I should not have fallen even those twenty
  feet; for a sort of low barn was built in the hollow, with its back leaning
  against the perpendicular wall. I should have dropped perhaps ten feet on to
  the roof of this barn.</p>

  <p>I drew myself up the hill again and sat down. The evening was very quiet
  and still. I was near to the summit of the island. Over my left shoulder I
  could see the sun setting far away in the Atlantic, and the waves rippling
  gold. Beneath me was the house, a long one-storied building of granite, on
  the horn of a tiny bay. The windows looked across the bay; behind the house
  stretched that tangled garden, and at the end of the garden rose the
  Merchant's Rock. As it stood thus in the evening light, with the smoke
  curling from its chimneys, and the sea murmuring at its door, it seemed quite
  impossible to believe that any story of turmoil and strife and tragedy could
  have locality there. That old buccaneer Adam Mayle, and his soft-voiced son
  Cullen, whom he had turned adrift, seemed the figures of a dream and my
  adventure in Cullen's room&mdash;a hideous nightmare.</p>

  <p>And yet even as I looked footsteps brushed through the grass behind me,
  and turning I saw a sailor with a brass telescope under one arm and a black
  patch over one eye; who politely passed me the time of day and went by. He
  was a big man, with a great beard and hair sprouting from his ears and
  nostrils. He was another of the five no doubt, and though he went by he did
  not pass out of sight. I waited, hoping that he would go, for I had a great
  desire to examine the barn beneath me more closely. It was from the barn that
  the unearthly screeching had risen which had so terrified Dick Parmiter. It
  was between the barn and the house that a girl had brushed against my wounded
  hand and taken a stain of blood upon her dress.</p>

  <p>The hollow was only a break in the steep slope of the hill. The barn could
  easily be approached by descending the hill to the right or the left, and
  then turning in. I was anxious to do it, to try the door, to enter the barn,
  but I dared not, for the sailor was within sight, and I had no wish to arouse
  any suspicions. Helen had told me everything, she had said&mdash;everything
  which it concerned me to know. But had she? I found myself asking, as I got
  to my feet and crossed the hill down towards New Grimsby.</p>

  <p>The sun had set by this time, a cool twilight took the colour from the
  gorse, and numberless small winged things flew and sung about one's face; all
  round a grey sea went down to a grey sky, and sea and sky were merged; and at
  my feet the lights began to twinkle in the little fishing village by the sea.
  I hired a bed at the "Palace" Inn, bade them prepare me supper and then
  walked on to Parmiter's cottage for my valise.</p>

  <p>There was a great hubbub going on within; Dick's voice was explaining, and
  a woman's shrill voice overtopped his explanation. The cause of his offence
  was twofold. He had not been near the cottage all day, so that it was thought
  he had run away again, and the key of the cottage was gone. It had not been
  seen since yesterday, and Dick had been accused of purloining it. I explained
  to Mrs. Parmiter that it was my fault Dick had kept away all day, and I made
  a bargain with her that I should have the lad as my servant while I stayed
  upon the island. Dick shouldered my valise in a state of considerable
  indignation.</p>

  <p>"What should I steal the key for?" said he. "It only stands in the door
  for show. No one locks his door in Tresco. What should I steal the key for?"
  and he was within an ace of whimpering.</p>

  <p>"Come, Dick," said I, "you mustn't mind a trifle of a scolding. Why, you
  are a hero to everybody in these parts, and to one man at all events outside
  them."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't hinder mother from chasing me about with an oar," he
  answered.</p>

  <p>"It is the fate of all heroes," said I, "to be barbarously used by their
  womenfolk."</p>

  <p>"Then I am damned if I want to be a hero," said Dick, violently. "And as
  for the key&mdash;of what consequence is it at all if you never lock your
  door?"</p>

  <p>"Of no more consequence than your bruises, Dick," said I.</p>

  <p>But I was wrong. You may do many things with a key besides locking a door.
  You can slip it down your back to stop your nose bleeding, for instance; if
  it's a big key you can weigh a line with it, and perhaps catch a mackerel for
  your breakfast. And there's another use for a key of which I did not at this
  time know, or I should have been saved from considerable perplexity and not a
  little danger.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"><small>CHAPTER X</small></a><br>
  <br>
  IN WHICH I LEARN SOMETHING<br>
  FROM AN ILL-PAINTED PICTURE</h2>

  <p class="first">I took my supper in the kitchen of the Palace Inn, with a
  strong reek of tobacco to season it, and a succession of gruesome stories to
  make it palatable. The company was made up for the most part of fishermen,
  who talked always of wrecks upon the western islands and of dead men drowned.
  But occasionally a different accent and a different anecdote of some other
  corner of the world would make a variation; and doing my best to pierce the
  haze of smoke, I recognised the speaker as Peter Tortue, the Frenchman, or
  the man with the patch on his eye. George Glen was there too, tucked away in
  a corner by the fireplace, but he said very little. I paid, therefore, but a
  scanty attention, until, the talk having slid, as it will, from dead men to
  their funerals, some native began to descant upon the magnificence of Adam
  Mayle's.</p>

  <p>"Ay," said he, drawing a long breath, "there <i>was</i> a funeral, and all
  according to orders dictated in writing by the dead man. He was to be buried
  by torchlight in the Abbey Grounds. I do remember that! Mortal heavy he was,
  and he needed a big coffin."</p>

  <p>"To be sure he would," chimed in another.</p>

  <p>"And he had it too," said a third; "a mortal big coffin. We carried him
  right from his house over the shoulder of the island, and down past the Abbey
  pond to the graveyard. Five shillings each we had for carrying him&mdash;five
  shillings counted out by torchlight on a gravestone as soon as the grave was
  filled in. It was all written down before he died."</p>

  <p>Then the first speaker took up the tale again.</p>

  <p>"A queer, strange man was Adam Mayle, and queer strange sights he had
  seen. He would sit in that corner just where you be, Mr. Glen, and tell
  stories to turn a man cold. Crackers they used to call him on board ship, so
  he told us&mdash;'Crackers.'"</p>

  <p>"Why Crackers?" asked George Glen.</p>

  <p>"'Cause he was that handy with a marlinspike. A queer man! And that was a
  queer notion of his about that stick"; and then he appealed to his
  companions, who variously grunted their assent.</p>

  <p>"What about the stick?" asked Glen.</p>

  <p>"You may well ask, Mr. Glen. It was all written down. The stick was to be
  buried with him in his coffin. It was an old heavy stick with a great brass
  handle. Many's the time he has sat on the settle there with that stick atween
  his knees. 'Twas a stick with a sword in't, but the sword was broken. I
  remember how he loosened the handle once while he was talking just as you and
  I are now, and he held the stick upside down and the sword fell out on to the
  ground, just two or three inches of steel broken off short. He picked it up
  pretty sharp and rammed it in again. Well, the stick was to be buried with
  him, so that if he woke up when we were carrying him over the hill to the
  Abbey he might knock on the lid of his coffin."</p>

  <p>"But I doubt if any one would ha' opened the lid if he had knocked," said
  one, with a chuckle, and another nodded his head to the sentiment. "There was
  five shillings, you see," he explained, "once the ground was stamped down on
  top of him. It wasn't quite human to expect a body to open the lid."</p>

  <p>"A queer notion&mdash;about that stick."</p>

  <p>And so the talk drifted away to other matters. The fishermen took their
  leave one by one and tramped heavily to their homes. Peter Tortue and his
  companion followed. George Glen alone remained, and he sat so quiet in his
  corner that I forgot his presence. Adam Mayle was the only occupant of the
  room for me. I could see him sitting on the settle, with a long pipe between
  his lips when he was not holding a mug there, his mulberry face dimly glowing
  through the puffs of tobacco, and his voice roaring out those wild stories of
  the African coast. That anxiety for a barbaric funeral seemed quite of a
  piece with the man as my fancies sketched him. Well, he was lying in the
  Abbey grounds, and George Glen sat in his place.</p>

  <p>Mr. Glen came over to me from his corner, and I called for a jug of rum
  punch, and invited him to share it, which he willingly did. He was a little
  squabby man, but very broad, with a nervous twitting laugh, and in his manner
  he was extremely intimate and confidential. He could hardly finish a sentence
  without plucking you by the sleeve, and every commonplace he uttered was
  pointed with a wink. He knew that I had been over at the house under
  Merchant's Rock, and he was clumsily inquisitive about my business upon
  Tresco.</p>

  <p>"Why," said I, indifferently, "I take it that I am pretty much in the same
  case with you, Mr. Glen."</p>

  <p>At that his jaw dropped a little, and he stared at me utterly
  discountenanced that I should be so plain with him.</p>

  <p>"As for me," said he in a little, "it is plain enough. And when you
  say"&mdash;and here he twitched my sleeve as he leaned across the
  table&mdash;"'here's old George Glen, that battered about the world in ships
  for fifty years, and has come to his moorings in a snug harbor where rum's
  cheap, being smuggled or stole', says you&mdash;well, I am not denying you
  may be right;" and here he winked prodigiously.</p>

  <p>"And that's just what I said," I returned; "for here have I battered about
  London, that's worse than the sea, and ages a man twice as
  fast&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Glen interrupted me with some astonishment, and, I thought, a little
  alarm.</p>

  <p>"Why," says she, "this is no place for the likes of you&mdash;a crazy
  tumbledown of a tavern. All very well for tarry sailor folk that's never seen
  nothing better than forecastle. But you'll sicken of it in a week. Sure, you
  have not dropped your anchor here."</p>

  <p>"We'll call it a kedge, Mr. Glen," said I.</p>

  <p>"A kedge, you say," answered Mr. Glen, with a titter, "and a kedge we'll
  make it. It's a handy thing to get on board in a hurry."</p>

  <p>He spoke with a wheedling politeness, but very likely a threat underlay
  his words. I thought it wise to take no notice of them, but, rising from my
  seat, I wished him good night. And there the conversation would have ended
  but for a couple of pictures upon the wall which caught my eye.</p>

  <p>One was the ordinary picture which you may come upon in a hundred
  alehouses by the sea: the sailor leaving his cottage for a voyage, his wife
  and children clinging about his knees, and in the distance an impossible ship
  unfurling her sails upon an impossible ocean. The second, however, it was,
  which caught my attention. It was the picture of a sailor's return. His wife
  and children danced before him, he was clad in magnificent garments, and to
  prove the prosperity of his voyage he carried in his hand a number of gold
  watches and chains; and the artist, whether it was that he had a sense of
  humour or that he merely doubted his talents, instead of painting the
  watches, had cut holes in the canvas and inserted little discs of bright
  metal.</p>

  <p>"This is a new way of painting pictures, Mr. Glen," said I.</p>

  <p>Mr. Glen's taste in pictures was crude, and for these he expressed a quite
  sentimental admiration.</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "the artist is guilty of a libel, for he makes the
  sailor out to be a sneak-thief."</p>

  <p>Mr. Glen became indignant.</p>

  <p>"Because he comes home with wealth untold?" he asked grandly.</p>

  <p>"No, but because he comes home with watches," said I.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Mr. Glen was at some pains to explain to me that the watches
  were merely symbolical.</p>

  <p>"And the picture's true," he added, and fell to pinching my arm. "There's
  many a landsman laughs; but sailors, you says, says you, 'comes home with
  watches in their 'ands more than they can 'old and sets up for gentle-folk,'
  says you."</p>

  <p>"Like old Adam Mayle, I adds," said I; and Mr. Glen dropped my arm and
  stood a little way off blinking at me.</p>

  <p>"You knew Adam?" he said, in a fierce sort of way.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered.</p>

  <p>"But you know of him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, slowly, "I know of him, but not as much as you do, Mr.
  Glen, who were quartermaster with him at Whydah on the ship <i>Royal
  Fortune</i>."</p>

  <p>I spoke at random, wondering how he would take the words, and they had
  more effect than I had even hoped for. His face turned all of a mottled
  colour; he banged his fist upon the table and uttered a horrible oath,
  calling upon God to slay him if he had ever set foot on the deck of a ship
  named the <i>Royal Fortune</i>.</p>

  <p>"And when you says, says you," he added, sidling up to me, "Old George
  never see'd a <i>Royal Fortune</i>, says you&mdash;why, you're saying what's
  right and fair, and I thanks you, sir. I thanks you with a true sailor's
  'eart "; at which he would have wrung my hand. But I had no hand ready for
  him; I barely heard his words. Whydah&mdash;the Guinea coast&mdash;the ship
  <i>Royal Fortune!</i> The truth came so suddenly upon me that I had not the
  wit to keep silence. I could have bitten off my tongue the next moment. As it
  was I caught most of the sentence back. But the beginning of it jumped from
  my mouth.</p>

  <p>"At last I know"&mdash;I began and stopped.</p>

  <p>"What?" said Mr. Glen, with his whole face distorted into an insinuating
  grin. But he was standing very close to me and a little behind my back.</p>

  <p>"That my father thrashed me over twenty years ago," said I, clapping my
  hand to my coat tails and springing away from him.</p>

  <p>"And you have never forgotten it," said he.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," said I, "I have only just remembered it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Glen moved away from the table and walked towards the door. Thus he
  disclosed the table to me, and I laughed very contentedly. Mr. Glen
  immediately turned. He had reached the door, and he stood in the doorway
  biting shreds of skin from his thumb.</p>

  <p>"You are in good spirits," said he, rather surlily.</p>

  <p>"I was never in better," said I. "The motions of inanimate bodies are
  invariably instructive."</p>

  <p>I was very willing he should think me half-witted. He went grumbling up
  the stairs; I turned me again to the picture of the sailor's return.
  Whydah&mdash;the Guinea coast&mdash;the ship <i>Royal Fortune!</i> It may
  have been in some part the man's eagerness to deny all knowledge of the ship;
  it was, no doubt, in some part the picture of those gold watches, which
  awakened my memories. Watches of just such gold were dangling for sale on a
  pedler's stall when first I heard of the ship <i>Royal Fortune</i>. The whole
  scene came back to me most vividly&mdash;the market-place of an old country
  town upon a fair day, the carts, the crowds, the merry-go-rounds, the
  pedler's stall with the sham gold watches, and close by the stall a ragged
  hawker singing a ballad of the <i>Royal Fortune</i>, and selling copies of
  the ballad&mdash;a ballad to which was added the last confessions of four men
  hung for piracy at Cape Coast Castle within the flood-marks. It was well over
  twenty years since that day, but I remembered it now with a startling
  distinctness. There was a rough woodcut upon the title-page of the ballad
  representing four men hanging in chains upon four gibbets. I had bought one
  that afternoon, and my father had taken it from me and thrashed me soundly
  for reading it. But I had read it! My memory was quickened now to an almost
  supernatural clearness. I could almost turn over the pages in my mind and
  read it again. All four men&mdash;one of them was named Ashplant, a second
  Moody&mdash;went to the gallows without any sign of penitence. There was a
  third so grossly stupid&mdash;yes, his name was Hardy&mdash;so stupid that
  during his last moments he could think of nothing more important than the
  executioner's tying his wrists behind his back, and his last words were
  before they swung him off to the effect that he had seen many men hanged, but
  none with their hands tied in this way. The fourth&mdash;I could not recall
  his name, but he swore very heartily, saying that he would rather go to hell
  than to heaven, since he would find no pirates in heaven to keep him company,
  and that he would give Roberts a salute of thirteen guns at entrance. There
  was the story of a sea-fight, too, besides the ballad and the confessions and
  it all cost no more than a penny. What a well-spent penny! The fourth man's
  name, by-the-bye, was Sutton.</p>

  <p>But the sea-fight! It was fought not many miles from Whydah between His
  Majesty's ship <i>Swallow</i> and the <i>Royal Fortune</i>; for the <i>Royal
  Fortune</i> was sailed by Captain Bartholomew Roberts, the famous pirate who
  was killed in this very encounter. How did George Glen or Adam Mayle or Peter
  Tortue (for he alone of Glen's assistants was of an age to have shipped on
  the <i>Royal Fortune</i>) escape? I did not care a button. I had my thumb on
  George Glen, and was very well content.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt I had my thumb on the insinuating George. There was
  Adam Mayle's fortune, in the first place; there was Adam's look when George
  Glen let slip the name of the ship when he first came to Tresco; there was
  Glen's consternation this evening when I repeated it to him, and there was
  something more than his convincing than his consternation&mdash;a table-
  knife.</p>

  <p>He had come very close to me when I mentioned the <i>Royal Fortune</i>,
  and he had stood a little behind me&mdash;against the table at which I had
  eaten my supper. I had eaten that supper at the opposite side of the table,
  and how should a table-knife have crawled across the table and be now lying
  so handily on this nearer edge unless George had doubts of my discretion?
  Yes, I had my thumb upon him and as I went upstairs to bed I wondered whether
  after all Helen would be justified of her confidence in believing that I had
  been sent to Tresco to some good end. Her face was very present to me that
  night. There was much in her which I could not understand. There was
  something, too, to trouble one, there were concealments, it almost seemed
  there was a trace of effrontery&mdash;such as Lieutenant Clutterbuck had
  spoken of; but to- night I was conscious chiefly that she set her faith in me
  and my endeavours. Does the reed always break if you lean upon it? What if a
  miracle happened and the reed grew strong because some one&mdash;any
  one&mdash;leaned upon it! I kept that trustful face of hers as I had seen it
  in the sunlight, long before my eyes in the darkness of the room. But it
  changed, as I knew and feared it would,&mdash;it changed to that appalling
  face which had stared at me out of the dark. I tried to drive that picture of
  her from my thoughts.</p>

  <p>But I could not, until a door creaked gently. I sat up in my bed with a
  thought of that knife handy on the table edge to the grasp of George Glen. I
  heard a scuffle of shoeless feet draw towards my door, and I remembered that
  I had no weapon&mdash;not even a knife. The feet stopped at my door, and I
  seemed to hear the sound of breathing. The moon had already sunk, but the
  night was clear, and I watched the white door and the white woodwork of the
  door frame. The door was in the wall on my right; it was about midway between
  the head and the foot of my bed, and it opened inwards and down towards the
  foot; so that I should easily see it opening. But suddenly I heard the stair
  boards creaking. Whoever it was then, had merely stopped to listen at my
  door. I fell back on my bed with a relief so great as to surprise me. I was
  surprised, too, to find myself cold with sweat. I determined to buy myself a
  knife in the morning, for there was the girl over at Merchant's Point who
  looked to me. I had thus again a picture of her in the sunlight.</p>

  <p>And then I began to wonder at that stealthy descent of the stairs. And why
  should any one wish to assure himself I slept? This was a question to be
  looked into. I got out of bed very cautiously, as cautiously opened the door
  and peered out.</p>

  <p>There was a light burning in the kitchen&mdash;a small yellow light as of
  a candle, but I could hear no sound. I crept to the head of the stairs which
  were steep and led directly to the very threshold of the kitchen. I lay down
  on the boards of the landing and stretching my head down the stairs, looked
  into the room.</p>

  <p>George Glen had taken the sailor with the watches, down from the wall. He
  was seated with the candle at his elbow, and minutely examining the picture.
  He looked up towards the stairs, I drew my face quickly back; but he was
  gazing in a complete abstraction, and biting his thumb, very much puzzled. I
  crept back to bed and in a little I heard him come shuffling up the stairs.
  He had been examining that picture to find a reason for my exclamation. It
  was a dull-witted thing to do and I could have laughed at him heartily, only
  I had already made a mistake in taking him to be duller-witted than he was.
  For he was quick enough, at all events, to entertain suspicions.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"><small>CHAPTER XI</small></a><br>
  <br>
  OUR PLANS MISCARRY UPON CASTLE DOWN</h2>

  <p class="first">The next morning, you may be sure, I crossed the hill
  betimes, and came down to the house under Merchant's Rock with my good news.
  I told her the news with no small elation, and with a like elation she began
  to hear it. But as I related what had occurred at the Palace Inn, she fell
  into thought, and now smiled with a sort of pride, and now checked a sigh;
  and when I came to the knife upon the table's edge she shuddered.</p>

  <p>"But you are in danger!" she cried. "Every minute you are in danger of
  your life, and on my account!"</p>

  <p>"Nay," said I lightly, "you exaggerate. The best of women have that
  fault."</p>

  <p>But she did not smile. She laid a hand upon my arm, and said, very
  earnestly:</p>

  <p>"I cannot have it. I am very proud you count the risk so little, but you
  must go."</p>

  <p>"No," said I, "they must go, and we have the means to make them march. We
  have but to inform Captain Hathaway at the Garrison that here are some of
  Bartholomew Robert's fry, and we and the world will soon be quit of them for
  ever."</p>

  <p>"But we cannot," she exclaimed, "for then it would be known that
  my"&mdash;she hesitated for a second, or rather she paused, for there was no
  hesitation in her voice, as she continued&mdash;"my father also was of the
  band. It may be justice that it should be known. But I cannot help it; I
  guard his memory. Besides, there is Cullen."</p>

  <p>It was to Cullen that she always came in the end, and with such excuses as
  a girl might make who was loyal to a man whom she must know not to be worth
  her loyalty. The house in which she lived, the money which she owned were his
  by right. She dreaded what story these men, if captured, might have to tell
  of Cullen&mdash;she could not be persuaded that Glen and his friends had not
  a motive of vengeance as well as of gain,&mdash;and that story, whatever it
  was, would never have been enacted, had not Cullen been driven penniless from
  Tresco. It did not occur to her at all that this house was not Cullen's by
  any right, but belonged to the scattered sons of many men with whom the ship
  <i>Royal Fortune</i> had fallen in.</p>

  <p>She repeated her arguments to me as we walked in the grass- grown garden
  at the back of the house. A thick shrubbery of trees grew at the end of the
  garden, and behind the trees rose the Merchant's Rock. On one side the Castle
  Down rolled up towards the sky, on the other a hedge closed the garden in,
  and beneath the hedge was the sea. Over the hedge I could see the uninhabited
  island of St. Helen's and the ruined church upon the summit, and a ship or
  two in St. Helen's Pool; and this side of the ships the piled boulders of
  Norwithel. It was at Norwithel that I looked as she spoke, and when she had
  done I continued:</p>

  <p>"I do not propose that we should tell Captain Hathaway, but I can make a
  bargain with Glen. I can find out what he wants, and strike a bargain with
  him. We have the upper hand, we can afford to speak freely. I will make a
  bargain with him to-night, of which one condition shall be that he and his
  party leave Tresco and nowhere attempt to molest Cullen Mayle."</p>

  <p>But she stopped in front of me.</p>

  <p>"I cannot have it," she said, with energy. "This means danger to you who
  propose the bargain."</p>

  <p>"I shall propose it in the inn kitchen," said I.</p>

  <p>"And the knife on the table's edge?" she asked; "that too was in the inn
  kitchen. Oh, no! no!" she cried, in a voice of great trouble. There was great
  trouble too in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Madam," I said, gently, "I never thought that this would prove a
  schoolboy's game. If I had thought so, I should be this instant walking down
  St. James's. But you overrate my peril."</p>

  <p>I saw her draw herself erect.</p>

  <p>"No; it is I who will propose the bargain and make the conditions. It is I
  who will charge them with their piracy."</p>

  <p>"How?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I will go this morning to the Palace Inn."</p>

  <p>"George Glen went out this morning before I rose."</p>

  <p>She looked over to Norwithel.</p>

  <p>"There is no one to-day on Norwithel," said I.</p>

  <p>"I shall find Peter Tortue on the Castle Down."</p>

  <p>"But I crossed the Castle Down this morning&mdash;&mdash;" and I suddenly
  stopped. There had been no one watching on the Castle Down. There was no one
  anywhere upon the watch to-day. The significance of this omission struck me
  then for the first time.</p>

  <p>"What if already we are quit of them!" I cried. "What if that one tiny
  word <i>Royal Fortune</i> has sent them at a scamper into hiding?"</p>

  <p>Helen caught something of my excitement.</p>

  <p>"Oh! if it only could be so!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Most like it <i>is</i> so," I returned. "No man cutting ore-weed upon
  Norwithel! No man lounging on the Castle Down! It must be so!" and we shook
  hands upon that likelihood as though it was a certainty. We started guiltily
  apart the next moment, for a servant came into the garden with word that Dick
  Parmiter had sailed round in a boat from New Grimsby, and was waiting for
  me.</p>

  <p>"There is something new!" said Helen, clasping her hands over her heart,
  and in a second she was all anxiety. I hastened to reassure her. Dick had
  come at my bidding, for I was minded to sail over to St. Mary's, and discover
  if there was anywhere upon that island a record of the doings of the <i>Royal
  Fortune</i>. To that end I asked Helen to give me a letter to the chaplain
  there, who would be likely to know more of what happened up and down the
  world than the natives of the islands. I was not, however, to allow that I
  had any particular interest in the matter, lest the Rev. Mr. Milray should
  smell a rat as they say, and on promising to be very exact in this particular
  and to return to the house in time for supper, I was graciously given the
  letter.</p>

  <p>I found the Rev. Mr. Milray in his parsonage at Old Town, a small, elderly
  man, who would talk of nothing but the dampness of his house since the great
  wave which swept over this neck of land on the day of the earthquake at
  Lisbon. I left him very soon, therefore, and went about another piece of
  business.</p>

  <p>I had travelled from London with no more clothes and linen than a small
  valise would hold. On setting out, I had not considered, indeed, that I
  should be thrown much into the company of a lady, but only that I was
  journeying into a rough company of fisher-folk. Yesterday, however, it had
  occurred to me that I must make some addition to my wardrobe and the
  necessity was yet more apparent to-day. I was pleased, therefore, to find
  that Hugh Town was of greater importance than I had thought it to be. It is
  much shrunk and dwindled now, but then ships from all quarters of the world
  were continually putting in there, so that they made a trade by themselves,
  and there was always for sale a great store of things which had been salved
  from wrecks. I was able, therefore, to fit myself out very properly.</p>

  <p>I sailed back to the Palace Inn, dressed with some care, and walked over
  to sup at Merchant's Rock&mdash;little later perhaps. Helen Mayle was
  standing in the hall by the foot of the stairs. I saw her face against the
  dark panels as I entered, and it looked very white and strained with
  fear.</p>

  <p>"There is no news of Cullen at St. Mary's," I said, to lighten her fears;
  and she showed an extravagant relief, before, indeed, she could barely have
  heard the words. Her face coloured brightly and then she began to laugh.
  Finally she dropped me a curtsey.</p>

  <p>"Shall I lend you some hair-powder?" she asked, whimsically; and when we
  were seated at table, "How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"I was thirty and more a month ago," said I, "but I think that I am now
  only twenty-two."</p>

  <p>"As much as that?" said she, with a laugh, and grew serious in an instant.
  "What did you discover at St. Mary's besides a milliner?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said I, "except that the Rev. Milray suffers from the
  rheumatics."</p>

  <p>She remained in the same variable disposition during the whole of that
  supper, at one moment buoyant on a crest of light-heartedness and her eyes
  sparkling like stars, at another sunk into despondency and her white brows
  all wrinkled with frowns. But when supper was over she went to a cabinet, and
  taking from it a violin, said:</p>

  <p>"Now, I will play to you."</p>

  <p>And she did&mdash;out in that tangled garden over the sea.</p>

  <p>"The violin came to the Scillies in a ship that was wrecked upon the
  Stevel Rock one Christmas. But the violin will tell you," she said, with a
  smile. "My father bought it at St. Mary's and gave it to me, and an old pilot
  now dead taught me;" and she swept the bow across the strings and the music
  trembled across the water, through the lucent night, up to the stars, a voice
  vibrating with infinite wisdom and infinite passion.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that I had at last got the truth of her. All my guesses,
  my suspicions of something like duplicity, even my recollection of our first
  meeting were swept out of my mind. She sat, her white face gleaming strangely
  solemn under her black wealth of hair, her white hand flashing backwards and
  forwards, and she made the violin speak. It spoke of all things, things most
  sad and things most joyous; it spoke with complete knowledge of the heights
  and the depths; it woke new, vague, uncomprehended hungers in one's heart; it
  called and called till all one's most sacred memories rose up, as it were
  from graves, to answer the summons. It told me, I know, all my life, from my
  childhood in the country to the day when I set out with my cadet's portion to
  London. It sang with almost a pan of those first arduous years&mdash;set
  them to a march,&mdash;and then with a great pity told of those eight wasted
  years that followed&mdash;years littered with cards, stained with drink;
  years in which, and there was the humiliation of it, my fellow-drunkards, my
  fellow-gamblers had all been younger than myself&mdash;years in which I grew
  a million years old. That violin told it all out to me, until I twisted in my
  chair through sheer shame, and I looked up and the girl's eyes were fixed
  upon me. What it was that compelled me to speak I could never tell, unless it
  was the violin. But as she looked at me, and as that violin sobbed out its
  notes, I cried in a passionate excuse:</p>

  <p>"You asked me how old I was. Do you know I never was young&mdash;I never
  had the chance of youth! When the chance came, I had forgotten what youth can
  do. That accounts, surely, for those eight years. I was tired then, and I was
  never young."</p>

  <p>"Until to-night," she said quietly, and the music quickened. I suppose
  that she was right, for I had never spoken so intimately to any one, whether
  man or woman; and I cursed myself for a fool, as one does when one is first
  betrayed into speaking of one's secret self.</p>

  <p>She took the violin from her shoulder, and the glory of the music died off
  the sea, but lingered for a little faintly upon the hills. I rose up to go
  and Helen drew a breath and shivered.</p>

  <p>"This afternoon," said I, "a brig went out from the islands through Crow
  Sound, bound for Milford. I'll wager the five were on it."</p>

  <p>"But if not?"</p>

  <p>"There's the 'Palace' kitchen."</p>

  <p>"Speak when there are others by, not within hearing, but within reach! You
  will? Promise me!"</p>

  <p>I promised readily enough, thinking that I could keep the promise, and she
  walked back with me through the house to the door. There is a little porch at
  the door, four wooden beams and a slate roof on the top, and half a dozen
  stone steps from the porch to the garden. Helen Mayle stood in the porch,
  with her violin still in her hand. She wished me "Good-night" when I was at
  the bottom of the steps, but a little afterwards, when I had passed through
  the gateway of the palisade and had begun to ascend the hill, she drew the
  bow sharply across one of the strings and sent a little chirp of music after
  me, which came to my ears, with an extraordinarily friendly sound. The air
  was still hereabouts, though from the motion of the clouds there was some
  wind in the sky, and the chirp came very clear and pretty.</p>

  <p>It was a few minutes short of ten when I left the house, and I set off at
  a good pace, for I was anxious to keep my promise and make my bargain with
  George Glen, quietly in a corner, before the fishing-folk had gone home to
  bed. A young moon hung above the crest of the hill, a few white clouds were
  gathering towards it, and the gorse at my feet was black as ink. I walked
  upwards then steadily. I had walked for perhaps a quarter of an hour, when I
  heard a low, soft whistle. It came to me quite as clearly as the chirp of the
  violin, but it had not the same friendly sound. It sounded very lonesome, it
  set my heart jumping, it brought me to a stop. For I had heard precisely that
  whistle on one occasion before, on the night when I first crossed this hill
  with Dick Parmiter down to Merchant's Rock.</p>

  <p>The whistle had sounded from below me and from no great distance away. I
  turned and looked down the slope, but I could see no one. It was very lonely
  and very still. Whoever had whistled lay crouched on the gorse. And then the
  whistle sounded again, but this time it came from above me, higher up the
  slope. Immediately I dropped to the ground. The gorse which hid them from me
  might well hide me from them. A few paces above me the gorse seemed thicker
  than it was where I lay. I crawled laboriously, flat upon my face, till I
  reached this patch. I forced myself into it, holding my face well down to
  keep the thorns out of my eyes, until the bushes were so close I could crawl
  no further. Then I lay still as a mouse, holding my breath, listening with
  every nerve. I had eluded them before in just this way, but I got little
  comfort from that reflection. There had been a fog on that night, whereas
  to-night it was clear. Moreover, they had a more urgent reason now for
  persevering in their search. I possessed some dangerous knowledge about them
  as they were aware&mdash;knowledge, too dangerous; knowledge which would
  harden into a weapon in my hand if&mdash;if I reached the Palace Inn
  alive.</p>

  <p>I lay very still, and in a little I heard the brushing of their feet
  through the grass. They were closing down from above, they were closing up
  from below; but they did not speak or so much as whisper. I turned my head
  sideways, ever so gently, and looked up to the sky. I saw to my delight that
  the clouds were over the moon. I buried my face again in the grass, lest they
  should detect me by its pallor against the black gorse. I was very thankful
  indeed that I had not accepted that proffered loan of hair-powder&mdash;I was
  dressed in black, too, from head to foot; I blessed the good fortune which
  had led me to buy black stockings at St. Mary's, and, in a word, my hopes
  began to revive.</p>

  <p>The feet came nearer, and I heard a voice whisper:</p>

  <p>"It was here." The voice was Peter Tortue's, as I knew from the French
  accent, and the next instant a stick fell with a heavy thud not a foot from
  my head. If only the clouds hung in front of the moon! Round and about they
  tramped&mdash;the whole five of them. For in a little they began in low tones
  to curse, first of all me, and afterwards Peter Tortue, who had whistled from
  below. Let them only quarrel amongst themselves, I thought, and there's a
  good chance they will forget the reason of their quarrel. It seemed that they
  were well on the road to a quarrel at last; a man, quite young as I judged
  from his voice, flung himself down on the grass with an oath.</p>

  <p>"But he is here, close to us," said Peter. "I heard the girl thrum
  good-night to him on her fiddle, and then I saw him, and followed him, and
  whistled."</p>

  <p>"Well, it is your business, not mine. Yours and George Glen's," the other
  returned. I learned later that his name was Nathaniel Roper. "I was never on
  no <i>Royal Fortune</i>, devil damn me."</p>

  <p>"Whist, you lousy fool"&mdash;and this was George Glen speaking. I am sure
  he was winking and pinching the fellow's arm,&mdash;"we are all in the same
  boat whether we've sailed in the <i>Royal</i>&mdash;&mdash;" and he
  stopped.</p>

  <p>All at once there was a dead silence. I have never in my life experienced
  anything so horrible as that sudden, complete silence. I could not see what
  caused it, for my face was buried in the grass, and I dared not move. One
  moment I had a sensation that they were gazing at my back, and I
  felt&mdash;it is the only way I can express it&mdash;I felt <i>naked</i>.
  Another moment I imagined it to be a ruse to beguile me into stirring; and it
  lasted for ever and ever.</p>

  <p>At length one sound&mdash;not a voice&mdash;broke the silence: the man who
  had thrown himself down was getting to his feet. But when he had stood up he
  made no further movement; he stood motionless, like the others, and the
  silence began again and again it lasted for ever and ever.</p>

  <p>All sorts of tremors began to creep over my body; the muscles of my back
  jerked of their own accord. The suspense was driving me mad. I had to move, I
  had to see, if only to hinder myself from leaping to my feet and making a
  headlong rush. Very slowly I turned my head sideways; I looked backwards
  along the ground, until I saw. The moon had swum out from the clouds, and the
  five men were standing in arrested attitudes with their eyes fixed upon
  something that glittered very bright upon the ground. I could see it myself
  through the gorse glittering and burning white, like a delicate flame, and my
  heart gave a great leap within me as I understood what it was. It was a big
  silver shoe-buckle that shone in the moonlight, and the shoe-buckle was on my
  foot.</p>

  <p>The game was up. I thought that I might as well make a fight of it at the
  last, and I jumped to my feet suddenly, with a faint hope that the suddenness
  of the movement might startle them and let me through. But there was to be no
  fighting for me that night. It is true that the men all scattered from about
  me, but a voice a few yards to my right thundered, "Stand!" and I stood
  stock-still, obedient as a charity-school boy.</p>

  <p>For Peter Tortue was standing stock still too, with his right arm
  stretched out in a line with his shoulder and the palm of his hand upturned.
  On the palm of that hand was balanced a long knife with an open blade, and
  the moonlight streaked along that blade in flame, just as it had burned upon
  my shoe-buckle.</p>

  <p>George Glen rubbed his hands together.</p>

  <p>"You will lie down, Mr. Berkeley," said he, with his most insinuating
  smile. "You will down, 'flat on my face,' says you."</p>

  <p>"But I have only just got up," said I.</p>

  <p>Glen tittered nervously, but no one else showed any appreciation of my
  sally. I thought it best to lie down flat on my face.</p>

  <p>"Cross your hands behind your back," said George Glen, and I knew he was
  winking.</p>

  <p>"Any little thing like that, I am sure," I murmured, as I obeyed. "Only
  too happy," and in a trice I was nothing more than a coil of rope. It cut
  into my wrists, it crushed my chest, it snaked round my legs, it bit my
  ankles.</p>

  <p>"To be sure," said I, "they mean to send me somewhere by the post."</p>

  <p>Mr. George Glen sniggered and mentioned my destination, which was
  impolite, though he mentioned it politely; but Roper thumped me in the small
  of the back, and thrust my handkerchief into my mouth. So I had done better
  to have kept silence.</p>

  <p>Two of the men lifted me up on their shoulders and staggered up hill. In a
  moment or two they descended a small incline, and I saw that I was being
  carried into the hollow where the shed stood. Glen pushed at the door of the
  shed and it fell open inwards. A great cavern of blackness gaped at us, and
  they carried me in and set me down unceremoniously on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Brisk along with that lantern, Nat Roper," said Glen, and the young
  fellow who had flung himself down on the grass struck a light and set fire to
  the candle. The shed was divided by a wooden partition, in which was a
  rickety door hardly hanging on its hinges.</p>

  <p>"In there!" said Glen, swinging the lantern towards the inner room. My
  bearers picked me up again and carried me to the door. One of them kicked at
  the door, but it did not yield.</p>

  <p>"It's jammed," said the other, "there's some- thing 'twixt it and the
  floor," and raising a great sea boot, he kicked with all his might.</p>

  <p>I heard a metallic clinking, as though a piece of iron was hopping across
  the stone floor, and the door flew open.</p>

  <p>They carried me into the inner room and set me down against the partition.
  There was no furniture of any sort, not even a bucket to sit upon; there was
  no window either, a thatched roof rested upon heavy beams over my head. They
  placed the lantern at my feet, four of them squatted down about me, the fifth
  went out of the shed to keep watch.</p>

  <p>It was, after all, not in the inn kitchen of the Palace Inn that any
  bargain was to be struck. I could not deny that they had chosen their place
  very well. Not a man in Tresco but would give this shed the widest of berths,
  and if he saw the glint of this lantern through a chink, or heard, perhaps,
  as he was like to do, one loud cry&mdash;why, he would only take to his heels
  the faster. The ropes, too, made my bones ache.</p>

  <p>I would have preferred the kitchen at the Palace Inn.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"

  <br>
  I FIND AN UNEXPECTED FRIEND</h2>

  <p class="first">Glen bade Roper take the handkerchief from my mouth, and
  when that was done his creased face smiled at me over the lantern.</p>

  <p>"About the <i>Royal Fortune?</i>" he said smoothly.</p>

  <p>Peter Tortue nodded, and absently cleaned the blade of his knife upon the
  thighs of his breeches. There was no reply for me to make, and I waited.</p>

  <p>"You were over to St. Mary's to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What did you do there?"</p>

  <p>"I bought a pair of silk stockings and some linen."</p>

  <p>George Glen sniggered like a man that leaves off a serious conversation to
  laugh politely at a bad joke.</p>

  <p>"But it's true," I cried.</p>

  <p>"Did you speak of the <i>Royal Fortune?</i>"</p>

  <p>"No," and, as luck would have it, I had not&mdash;not even to the Rev. Mr.
  Milray.</p>

  <p>"Not to a living soul?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did you go up to Star Castle?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did you speak to Captain Hathaway?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"'There's poor old George,' you said. 'Old George Glen,' says you, 'what
  was quartermaster with Cap'n Roberts on the <i>Royal</i>&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"No," I cried.</p>

  <p>"Did you mention Peter Tortue?" said the Frenchman.</p>

  <p>"No. Would you be sitting here if I had? There would be a company of
  soldiers scouring the island for you."</p>

  <p>"That's reasonable," said Tortue, and the rest echoed his words. In a
  little there was silence. Tortue set to work again with his knife. It flashed
  backwards and forwards, red with the candle light as though it ran blood. It
  shone in my eyes and dazzled me, and somehow, there came back to me a
  recollection of that hot night in Clutterbuck's rooms when everything had
  glittered with an intolerable brightness, and Dick Parmiter had been set upon
  the table to tell his story. I was vaguely wondering what they were all doing
  at this moment in London, Clutterbuck, Macfarlane, and the rest, when the
  questions began again.</p>

  <p>"You came back from St. Mary's to New Grimsby?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell Parmiter?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"From St. Mary's you crossed the island to Merchant's Point?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell the girl?"</p>

  <p>Here a lie was obviously needful, and I did not scruple to tell it.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Peter Tortue leaned forward to me with a shrewd glance in his keen
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are her lover," he said. "You told her."</p>

  <p>I lifted my eyes from his knife, looked him in the eyes, and sustained his
  glance.</p>

  <p>"I am not her lover," I said; "that is a damned lie."</p>

  <p>He did not lose his temper, but repeated:</p>

  <p>"You told her," and George Glen looked in again with his whole face
  screwed into a wink.</p>

  <p>"You said to her, 'My dear,' says you, 'there's old George,'" and at that
  I lost my temper.</p>

  <p>"I said nothing of the kind," I cried. "Am I a parrot that I cannot open
  my lips without old George popping out of them? But what's the use of
  talking. Do what you will, I have done. If I had betrayed your secret, do you
  think I should be walking home alone, and you upon the island? But I have
  done. I had a bargain to strike with you, I thought to find you all at the
  inn&mdash;but I have done."</p>

  <p>To tell the truth, I had no longer any hope of life. Glen, for all his
  winks and smiles, would stop short of no cruelty. Peter Tortue quietly
  polished his knife upon his thigh. He was a big Brittany man, with shrewd
  eyes and an unchanging face. The rest squatted and stared curiously at me.
  The light of the lantern fell upon their callous faces, they were lookers-on
  at a show, of which perhaps, they had seen the like before, they were not
  concerned in this affair of the <i>Royal Fortune</i> nor how it ended.</p>

  <p>"So you told no one."</p>

  <p>"No one."</p>

  <p>I closed my eyes and leaned back against the partition. I was utterly
  helpless in their hands, and I hoped they would be quick. I remember that I
  regretted very much I could send no word to the girl at Merchant's Rock, and
  that I was very glad she had not delayed her music till tomorrow night, but
  both regret and gladness were of a numbed and languid kind.</p>

  <p>Then Glen asked me another question, and it spurred my will to
  alertness.</p>

  <p>"How did you know that I was quartermaster on the <i>Royal
  Fortune?</i>"</p>

  <p>I could not remind him that he had let the ship's name drop from his lips
  four years ago. It would be as much as to say that Helen had told me. It
  would confess that I had spoken with her of the <i>Royal Fortune</i>. Yet I
  must answer, and without the least show of hesitation. I caught at the first
  plausible reason which occurred to me. I said: "Cullen Mayle told me," and
  that answer saved my life. For Glen remarked, "Yes, he knew," and nodded to
  Tortue: Tortue lifted the knife in his hand, and again I closed my eyes. But
  the next thing I heard was a snap as the blade shut into the handle, and the
  next thing after that Tortue's voice deliberately speaking:</p>

  <p>"George Glen, you never had the brains of a louse. You can smirk and
  wriggle, and you're handy with a weapon, but, you never had no brains."</p>

  <p>I opened my eyes pretty wide at that, and I saw that the three younger
  faces were now kindled out of their sluggishness. It was that mention of
  Cullen Mayle which had wrought the change. These three took no particular
  interest in the <i>Royal Fortune</i>, but they had every interest in the
  doings of Cullen Mayle, and they now alertly followed all that Tortue said.
  George Glen leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Who's cap'en here, Peter Tortue?" said he. "Was you with us on the Sierra
  Leone River? Nat Roper there, Blads, you James Skyrm, speak up, lads, was he
  with us?"</p>

  <p>"My son was," said Tortue calmly.</p>

  <p>"And what sort of answer is that? 'Tis lucky for you Cap'en Roberts isn't
  aboard this shed. He wouldn't have understood that language, not he&mdash;and
  he wouldn't have troubled you for an explanation neither. Here's a fine
  thing, lads! If a man dies, his father, what's been lying in the lap of
  luxury at home, is to have his share. That's a nice new rule for gentlemen
  adventurers, and not content with his share, wants to set up for cap'en. I
  have a good mind to learn you modesty, Peter, just as Roberts would have
  learnt you."</p>

  <p>He was talking quite smoothly, with a grin all over his face, but I never
  saw a man that looked so dangerous. Peter Tortue, however, was in no way
  discomposed.</p>

  <p>"Why, you blundering fool," he answered, "where would you ha' been but for
  me? No, I wasn't on the Sierra Leone River with you, or you wouldn't be
  eating your hearts and your pockets empty upon Tresco. No, I am not your
  captain, or you wouldn't never have lost track of Cullen Mayle at
  Wapping."</p>

  <p>There were four faces now alertly watching Peter Tortue, and the fourth
  was mine. It was not merely that my life hung upon his predominance, but
  there was the best of chances now that I might get to the bottom of the
  mystery of their watching.</p>

  <p>"You talk of Roberts," he continued, "well you're not the only man that
  knew Roberts, and would Roberts have let Cullen Mayle slip through his
  fingers&mdash;at Wapping too? Good Lord, it makes me sick to look at you,
  George Glen!" and he turned to Roper, "Who was it found the track for you;
  was it him or me?" he cried. "Who was it found the nigger and sailed from the
  port o' London to Penzance, ay, and would ha' found out the nigger's message
  if he hadn't had the sickness on him. Was it him or was it me? Why the nigger
  knowed you all! Would he ha' sailed to Penzance on that boat if he had seen a
  face on board that he had known? not he."</p>

  <p>"That's true," said Roper.</p>

  <p>"Who brought you all to Tresco, eh? Who hindered you from rushing the
  house, ay, hindered you in the face of your captain, and a deal you'ld ha'
  found if you had rushed the house. A lot he knows, your captain. P'raps he
  thought Adam Mayle was the man to leave a polite note on his mantelshelf,
  telling us where to look. Who told you to wait for Cullen Mayle?"</p>

  <p>"We have waited," answered Glen. "How long are we to wait? Where is Cullen
  Mayle?"</p>

  <p>Peter Tortue threw up his hands.</p>

  <p>"No wonder you all dry in the sun at the end of it," he cried, "my word!
  We haven't got Cullen Mayle, but haven't we got the man as knows him? What's
  he doing at Tresco if he wasn't sent by Cullen Mayle who daren't show his
  face because we're here? Not worth my share, ain't I? and you that can't add
  two and two! See here! Dick Parmiter goes to London, don't he? He goes after
  the nigger come; what for, but to find Cullen Mayle, and say as we're here?
  He knows where Cullen's to be found, and down comes the stranger here. And we
  ha' got him tucked up comfortable, and we know tricks that Roberts taught us
  to make him speak, don't we? And you want to jab a knife into him. You make
  me sick, George Glen&mdash;fair sick! Suppose you do jab a knife into him,
  and bury him here under the stones, do you think the girl'll take it quite
  easy and natural? Or will you go down the hill and rush the house? And then
  if you please, what'll you all be doing to-morrow? Well, you are captain,
  George Glen, but what has your crew to say to this? Come! Am I to talk to Mr.
  Berkeley, or will you set your own course, and steer for execution dock?"</p>

  <p>There was no hesitation in the answer. With one accord they leaned to
  Tortue's proposal.</p>

  <p>I could not see that I was in a much better case. Tortue was to put to me
  questions, the very questions which I wished to ask, and I was expected to
  answer them. I should have to answer them if I was to come off with my life.
  The men sat hungrily about me awaiting my answers. It would not take them
  long to discover that I was tricking them, that I had no knowledge whatever
  about their concerns beyond that one dangerous item that Glen and Tortue had
  sailed on the <i>Royal Fortune</i>, and when that discovery was made, why,
  out of mere resentment they would let Glen have his way.</p>

  <p>However, I was still alive, and the girl was still at Merchant's Point.
  These men were plainly growing impatient of their long stay upon the island;
  and once I was out of the way, who was to stand between them and the
  girl?</p>

  <p>I summoned my wits together, and ran quickly over my mind what I did know.
  I had a few fresh hints from Tortue's arguments to add to my knowledge. I
  knew why they were watching for Cullen Mayle. He was to show them where to
  look for something. It was that something about which Glen had talked to Adam
  Mayle the night Cullen was driven away; Cullen had overheard, and he had gone
  out in search of it to the Sierra Leone River. Glen and his companions had
  done likewise. It was in some degree apparent now what that something was:
  namely, treasure of some sort from the Royal Fortune, and buried on the banks
  of the Sierra Leone River. They had not found it, and their presence here,
  and certain words, told me why. Adam Mayle had been first with them.</p>

  <p>So much I could venture to think of. For the rest I must wait upon the
  questions; and, fortunately for me. Glen was a man of much garrulity.</p>

  <p>"You spoke of a bargain," said Tortue. "What do you propose?"</p>

  <p>"Halves!" said I, as bold as brass.</p>

  <p>There was an outcry against the proposal, and it mightily relieved me, for
  it proved to me I was right. It was treasure they were after, but of what
  kind? I had now to puzzle my brains over that. Was it specie? Hardly, I
  thought, for Adam Mayle would not have hidden money upon Tresco. Was it a
  treasure of jewels, then?</p>

  <p>"Halves," said George Glen with a titter. "A very good proposal, Mr.
  Berkeley, by daylight, with a company of soldiers within call."</p>

  <p>Jewels, I thought: yes, jewels&mdash;jewels that might be recognized,
  jewels that Adam Mayle would keep hidden to himself so long as there was no
  pressing need to dispose of them.</p>

  <p>"As it is," continued Glen, "we take all, but we give you your life.
  That's a fair offer."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's fair," said Roper.</p>

  <p>I hazarded it.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said I. "You can find your jewels for yourselves."</p>

  <p>I expected an explosion of wrath; I met with only mute surprise.</p>

  <p>"Jewels!" said Roper at length.</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't the cross thick with them?" said Tortue to Roper.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be of much use to us without," sniggered Glen. "Lord, but
  that was a clever stroke of Roberts'&mdash;the cleverest thing he ever done.
  Right under the guns of the African Comp'ny's fort she lay in Sierra Leone
  harbour&mdash;a Portuguese ship of twenty guns. At a quarter to eleven there
  was her crew, as many as might be&mdash;we could hear 'em singing and
  laughing as we pulled across the water to 'em&mdash;and at ten minutes past
  three there wasn't a mother's son of them all alive; and no noise, mind you.
  Rich she was, too. Sugar&mdash;we had run short of sugar for our punch, and
  welcome it was&mdash;sugar, skins, tobacco, ninety thousand moidors, and this
  cross with the diamonds for the King of Portugal. Roberts himself said he had
  never seen stones like it, and he was a good judge of stones was Roberts. He
  was quick, too. Why, we had that cross on the dinghy and were well up the
  Sierra Leone River before daybreak, just the three of us&mdash;Roberts, me,
  and Adam Mayle&mdash;Kennedy he called himself then, being a gentleman born
  and with more sense than the rest of us. He buried the cross, two days sail
  up the Sierra Leone River, and Roberts made a chart of its bearings. He gave
  it to me on the deck of the <i>Royal Fortune</i> when he was mortally
  wounded, and I kept it all the time we were in prison. I showed it to Adam
  Mayle when we escaped, but we had no means to get at it&mdash;at least, I
  hadn't. Adam, he was a gentleman born, and had got his savings placed all
  safe in his own name."</p>

  <p>I hoped Glen would go on in this strain until my slip was forgotten. I
  was, besides, acquiring information. But Roper cut him short.</p>

  <p>"It was a cross&mdash;it wasn't jewels," said he, suspiciously; and
  suddenly Tortue interrupted.</p>

  <p>"'Halves' was what you said, I think," he remarked, rather quickly, and I
  could almost have believed that he was trying to cover up my mistake. I took
  advantage of his interruption as quickly as he had made it.</p>

  <p>"Half for you, half for Cullen," said I; and immediately Tortue flung out
  in an extravagant passion. He threatened me, he threatened Cullen, he opened
  his knife and gesticulated, he cursed, until I began to wonder: was he
  acting? Was this anger a pretence to divert attention finally from my unlucky
  guess? I could not be sure. I could conceive no reason for such a pretence.
  But certainly, whether he intended it or not, he brought about that result;
  for his companions began to fear he would make an end of me before they had
  got the information where the cross was hid, and so busied themselves with
  appeasing him. He permitted himself at the last to be appeased, and George
  Glen took up the argument.</p>

  <p>"Look you here, Mr. Berkeley," said he, "we're reasonable men, and it's no
  more than fair you should be reasonable too, seeing as how you are
  uncomfortably placed. That was took up by Adam Mayle, and he never meant his
  son to finger it. 'A damned ungrateful, supercilious whelp,' says he to me in
  the lad's own bedroom; yes, in his own bedroom"&mdash;for, as may be
  imagined, I had started. Here was the explanation of how Cullen discovered
  George Glen's business. I hoisted myself up against the partition as well as
  I could. How I prayed that Glen would go on! He was sufficiently garrulous,
  if only he was not interrupted, and he was arguing for all of them. "'A
  damned ungrateful, supercilious whelp,' he said; 'and George,' said he, as I
  read out the chart, 'I'd sooner let the cross rot to pieces in the Sierra
  Leone mud than fetch it home for him to have a share of. I've enough for
  myself and the girl. I'll not stir a finger,' says he, 'and if it was here
  now I'd have it buried with me.' Those were his very words, which he spoke to
  me not half an hour after he had driven Cullen from the house, and in the
  lad's own bedroom, where we couldn't be overheard."</p>

  <p>"But you were overheard," said I, "Cullen Mayle overheard you." Glen
  jumped on to his feet, his mouth dropped, he stood staring at me in a daze,
  and then he thumped one fist down into the palm of the other.</p>

  <p>"By God it's true," he said, "he was in the curtains."</p>

  <p>"He was in bed," said I.</p>

  <p>"By God it's true," repeated Glen, and he sat down again on the floor. "So
  that's how Cullen Mayle found out. I was mightily astonished to find him at
  Sierra Leone on the same business as ourselves. But it's true. I remember
  there was a noise, and I cried out, 'What's that?' with a sort of jump, and
  Adam he says, pleasant like, 'It's the hangman, George;' but it wasn't, it
  was Cullen Mayle."</p>

  <p>I think that every one laughed as Glen ended, except myself. I could even
  at that moment, but be sensible what a strange picture it made; those two old
  ruffians sitting over against each other in the bedroom, and Cullen waked up
  from his sleep in bed to lie quiet and overhear them.</p>

  <p>"So you see, it isn't reasonable Cullen should have half since his father
  never meant him to have any," he continued.</p>

  <p>"But without Cullen you would get nothing at all," said I.</p>

  <p>"Why not since we have you?"&mdash;and then I made a slip&mdash;I
  answered: "But Cullen Mayle told me where the cross is."</p>

  <p>"But Cullen Mayle doesn't know," said Roper, "else would he have gone
  hunting to Sierra Leone for it?"</p>

  <p>"Told him where to look for the plan, he means." Tortue interrupted again.
  This time I could not mistake. He glanced at me with too much significance.
  For some reason, he was standing my friend.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said I, "where to look for the plan."</p>

  <p>So it was a plan they needed, a plan of the spot where Adam Mayle had
  buried the cross. Where could that plan be, in what unlikely place would Adam
  have hid it?</p>

  <p>I ran over my mind the rooms, and the furniture of the house. There was no
  bureau, no secretaire. But I had to make up my mind. This last slip had
  awakened my captor's suspicions. The faces about me menaced me.</p>

  <p>"Well, where is the plan?"</p>

  <p>I thought over all that Glen had said to-night&mdash;was a clue to be got
  there?</p>

  <p>"I haven't it," said I, to gain time.</p>

  <p>"But where are we to look for it?" again asked Roper, and he put his hand
  in his coat-pocket.</p>

  <p>"Speak up," said Tortue, and I read his meaning in the glance of his eyes.
  He meant&mdash;"Name some spot, any spot!" But I knew! It had come upon me
  like an inspiration, I had no shadow of doubt where that plan was. I
  said:</p>

  <p>"Where are you to look for the plan? Glen has told you. Adam Mayle would
  rather have had the cross buried with him than that Cullen should have it. He
  couldn't have the treasure buried with him, but he could and did the plan.
  Look in Adam Mayle's grave. You will find a stick with a brass handle to
  it&mdash;a sword stick, but the sword's broken off short. In the hollow of
  that stick you'll find the plan." Tortue nodded at me with approval. The rest
  jumped up from the ground.</p>

  <p>"We have time to-night," said Roper, and stretching out a hand he pulled
  my watch from my fob. "It is eleven o'clock," and he put the watch in his own
  pocket. "Where's Adam Mayle buried?" asked another.</p>

  <p>"In the Abbey Grounds," said I.</p>

  <p>"But we want spades," objected Tortue, "we want a pick."</p>

  <p>"They are here," said Glen, with an evil smile, "we had them ready," and
  he grinned at me. "Mr. Berkeley comes with us, I think," said he smoothly,
  "untie his legs."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Roper with an oath. He was in a heat of excitement. "And if he
  has told us wrong, good God, we'll bury him with Adam Mayle."</p>

  <p>But I had no doubt that I was right. I remembered what Clutterbuck had
  told me of Adam's vindictiveness. He would hide that plan if he could, and he
  could have chosen no surer place. No doubt he would have destroyed that plan
  when he knew that he was dying, but he was struck down with paralysis, and
  could not stir a finger. He could only order the stick to be buried with
  him.</p>

  <p>They unfastened my legs. Roper blew out the lantern, and we went out of
  the shed, on to the hillside. Glen despatched Blads upon some errand, and the
  man hurried up the hill towards New Grimsby. Glen leisurely walked along the
  slope of the hill. I followed him, and the rest behind me. The moon had gone
  down, and the night, though clear enough, was dark. We walked on for about
  five minutes, until some one treading close upon my heels suddenly tripped me
  up. My hands were still tied behind my back, so that I could not save myself
  from a fall. But Tortue picked me up, and as he did so whispered in my
  ear:</p>

  <p>"Is the plan there?"</p>

  <p>I answered, "Yes."</p>

  <p>I would have staked my life upon it; in fact, I was staking my life upon
  it.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"><small>CHAPTER XIII</small></a><br>
  <br>
  IN THE ABBEY GROUNDS</h2>

  <p class="first">We kept along the ridge of hill towards the east of the
  island, and met no one, nor, indeed, were we likely to do. I could look down
  on either side to the sea. I saw the cottages on the shore of New Grimsby
  harbour on the one side, and on the other the house at Merchant's Point, and
  the half-dozen houses scattered on the grass at Old Grimsby, that went by the
  name of Dolphin Town, and nowhere was there a twinkle of light.</p>

  <p>Tresco was in bed.</p>

  <p>We descended a little to our left, and rounded the shoulder of the hill at
  the eastern end of the island, through a desolate moorland of gorse; but once
  we had rounded the shoulder, we were in an instant amongst trees of luxuriant
  foliage, and in a hollow sheltered from the winds. The Abbey ruins stood up
  from a small plateau in the bosom of the trees, its broken arches and columns
  showing very dismal against the sky, and everywhere fragments of crumbling
  wall cropped up unexpected through the grass.</p>

  <p>The burial ground was close to an eel pond, which glimmered below, nearer
  to the sea, and a path overgrown with weeds wound downwards to the
  graves.</p>

  <p>I could not tell in which corner Adam Mayle was buried, so Roper was sent
  forward with the lantern to look amongst the headstones. For half an hour he
  searched; the flame of the candle danced from grave to grave as though it
  were the restless soul of some sinner buried there. The men who remained with
  me grew impatient, for opposite to us, across the road, lay St. Mary's and
  the harbour of Hugh Town; and on this clear night the speck of light in the
  Abbey grounds would be visible at a great distance. I was beginning to wonder
  whether Adam had a headstone at all to mark his resting-place, when a cry
  came upwards to our ears and the lantern was swung aloft in the air.</p>

  <p>One loud, unanimous shout answered that cry.</p>

  <p>"Come," shouted Glen, and seizing hold of the end of the rope where it
  went round my chest, he began to run down the path. The others jostled and
  tumbled after him in an extreme excitement. All discretion was tossed to the
  winds. They laughed, shouted, and leaped while they ran as though they
  already had the cross in their keeping. What with Glen tugging at the end in
  front and the others pushing and thrusting at me from behind, it was more
  than I could do to keep my feet. Twice I fell forward on my knees and brought
  them to a stop. Glen turned upon me in a fury.</p>

  <p>"Loose his hands then, George," said Tortue.</p>

  <p>"No," returned George, with an oath, and he plucked on the rope until
  somehow I stumbled on to my feet, and we all set to running again.</p>

  <p>Things were taking on an ugly look for me. Those men were growing ten
  times more savage since the grave had been discovered; they were in a heat of
  excitement. In their movements, in their faces, in their words, a violent
  ferocity was evident. They had made their bargain with me, but would they
  keep it once they had the plan in their hands? I had no doubt their
  arrangements were made for an instant departure from the islands. One could
  not be a day upon Tresco without hearing some hint of the luggers which did a
  great smuggling trade between Scilly and the port of Roscoff in Brittany. No
  doubt Glen and Tortue had made their account with one of these to carry them
  into France. I was the more sure of this when Blads returned. I could not but
  think he had been sent so that a boat might be ready, and it seemed unlikely
  they would leave me alive behind them when the mere scruple of a bargain only
  held their hands.</p>

  <p>We were now come to the grave. It had a headstone but no slab to cover it;
  only a boulder from the seashore by which Adam had lived was with a pretty
  fancy imposed upon the mound.</p>

  <p>Roper hung the lantern on to a knob of the headstone; and already Glen had
  snatched the pick and thrust it under the boulder. It needed but one heave
  upon the pick, and the boulder tottered and rolled from the grave with a
  crash. It stopped quite close to my feet. I looked at it, then I looked at
  the grave, and from the grave to the sailors. But they had noticed nothing;
  they were already digging furiously at the grave. In their excitement they
  had noticed nothing; even Tortue was kneeling in the lantern-light watching
  the gleam of the spades, sensible of nothing but that each shovelful cast up
  on the side brought them by a shovelful nearer to their prize. And they dug
  with such furious speed, taking each his turn, each anticipating his turn!
  For before one man had stepped, dripping with sweat from the trench, another
  had leaped in, and the spade fell from one man's grasp into the palm of
  another. Once a spade jarred upon a piece of rock, and the man who drove it
  into the earth cursed. I had a sudden flutter of hope that the spade was
  broken, and that by so much the issue would be delayed, but the digger
  resumed his work. I looked over to St. Mary's, but the town was quiet; one
  light gleamed, it was only the light at the head of the jetty. And even in
  Tresco such infinitesimal chance of interruption as there had ever been had
  disappeared. For the men had ceased even from their oaths. There was not even
  a whisper to be shared amongst them; there was no sound but the laboured
  sound of their breathing. They worked in silence.</p>

  <p>I had no longer any hope. I saw now and again Roper, as he slapped down a
  spadeful of earth beside me, look with a grim significant smile at me, and
  perhaps his fellow would catch the look and imitate it. I noticed that George
  Glen, as he took down the lantern from time to time and held it over the
  trench, would flash it towards me; and he, too, would smile and perhaps wink
  at Roper in the trench. The winks and smiles were easy as print to read. They
  were agreeing between themselves: the unspoken word was going round; they did
  not mean to keep their part of the bargain, and when they left the Abbey
  grounds the mound upon Adam's grave would be a foot higher than when they
  entered them.</p>

  <p>But this unspoken understanding had no longer any power to frighten me. I
  tried to catch Peter Tortue's attention; I shuffled a foot upon the ground;
  but he paid no heed. He was on all fours by the grave-side peering into the
  trench, and I dared not call to him. I wanted to contradict what I had said
  outside the shed upon the hillside. I wanted to whisper to him:</p>

  <p>"The plan you search for is not there."</p>

  <p>If they were meaning to break their part of the bargain it mattered very
  little, for I was unable to keep mine.</p>

  <p>I had suspected that from the moment the boulder was uprooted; I knew it a
  moment after the lantern was hung upon the headstone. The stone had rested on
  that grave for two years, yet at the fresh pressure of the pick it had given
  and swayed and rolled from its green pedestal. It had tumbled at my feet, and
  there was not even a clot of earth or a pebble clinging to it. Moreover, on
  the grave itself there was grass where it had rested. For all its weight, it
  had not settled into the ground or so much as worn the herbage. Yet it had
  rested there two years!</p>

  <p>The lantern was hung upon the headstone, and its light showed to me that
  close to the ground the headstone had been chipped. It was as though some one
  had swung a pick and by mistake had struck the edge of the headstone.
  Moreover, whoever had swung the pick had swung it recently. For whereas the
  face of the granite was dull and weatherbeaten, this chipped edge sparkled
  like quartz.</p>

  <p>The aspect of the grave itself confirmed me. Some pains had been taken to
  replace the sods of grass upon the top, but all about the mound, wherever the
  lantern-light fell, I could see lumps of fresh clay.</p>

  <p>The grave had been opened, and recently&mdash;I did not stop then to
  consider by whom&mdash;and secretly. It could have been opened but for the
  one reason. There would be no plan there for Glen to find.</p>

  <p>Roper uttered an exclamation and stopped digging. His spade had struck
  something hard. Glen lowered the lantern into the trench, and the light
  struck up on to his face and the face of the diggers.</p>

  <p>I hazarded a whisper to Tortue, and certainly no one else heard it, but
  neither did Tortue. Roper struck his spade in with renewed vigour, and a
  stifled cry which burst at the same moment from the five mouths told me the
  coffin&mdash;lid was disclosed. I whispered again the louder:</p>

  <p>"Tortue! Tortue!" and with no better result.</p>

  <p>The pick was handed down at Roper's call. I <i>spoke</i> now, and at last
  he heard. He turned his head across his shoulder towards me, but he only
  motioned me to silence. The pick rang upon wood, and now I called:</p>

  <p>"Tortue! Tortue!"</p>

  <p>Still no one but Tortue heard. This time, however, he rose from his knees
  and came to me. Glen looked up for an instant.</p>

  <p>"See that he is fast!" he said, and so looked back into the grave.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Tortue.</p>

  <p>"The plan has gone. Loose my hands!"</p>

  <p>I could no longer see Roper; he had stooped down below the lip of the
  trench.</p>

  <p>"Gone!" said Tortue. "How?"</p>

  <p>"Some one has been here before you, but within this last week, I'll swear.
  Loose my hands."</p>

  <p>"Some one!" he exclaimed savagely. "Who? who?" and he shook me by the
  arms.</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>"Swear it."</p>

  <p>"I do. Loose my hands."</p>

  <p>"Remember it is I who save you."</p>

  <p>His knife was already out of his pocket; he had already muffled it in his
  coat and opened it; he was making a pretence to see whether the end was still
  fast. I could feel the cold blade between the rope and my wrist, when, with a
  shout. Roper stood erect, the stick in one hand, a sheet of paper flourishing
  in the other.</p>

  <p>He drew himself out of the trench and spread the paper out on a pile of
  clay at the graveside. Glen held his lantern close to it. There were four
  streaming faces bent over that paper. I felt a tug at my wrists and the cord
  slacken as the knife cut through it.</p>

  <p>"Take the rope with you," whispered Tortue.</p>

  <p>The next moment there were five faces bent over that paper.</p>

  <p>"On St. Helen's Island," cried Glen.</p>

  <p>"Let me see!" exclaimed Tortue, leaning over his shoulder.
  "Three&mdash;what's that?&mdash;chains. Three chains east by the compass of
  the east window in the south aisle of the church."</p>

  <p>And that was the last I heard. I stepped softly back into the darkness for
  a few paces, and then I ran at the top of my speed westwards towards New
  Grimsby, freeing my arms from the rope as I ran. Once I turned to look back.
  They were still gathered about that plan; their faces, now grown small, were
  clustered under the light of the lantern, and Tortue, with his flashing
  knife-blade, was pointing out upon the paper the position of the treasure.
  Ten minutes later I was well up the top of the hill. I saw a lugger steal
  round the point from New Grimsby and creep up in the shadow towards the Abbey
  grounds.</p>

  <p>I spent that night in the gorse high up on the Castle Down. I had no mind
  to be caught in a trap at the Palace Inn.</p>

  <p>From the top of the down, about an hour later, I saw the lugger come round
  the Lizard Point of Tresco and beat across to St. Helen's. As the day broke
  she pushed out from St. Helen's, and reaching past the Golden Ball into the
  open sea, put her tiller up and ran by the islands to the south.</p>

  <p>There was no longer any need for me to hide among the gorse. I went down
  to the Palace Inn. No one was as yet astir, and the door, of course, was
  unlocked. I crept quietly up to my room and went to bed.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"><small>CHAPTER XIV</small></a><br>
  <br>
  IN WHICH PETER TORTUE EXPLAINS<br>
  HIS INTERVENTION ON MY BEHALF</h2>

  <p class="first">As will be readily understood, when I woke up the next
  morning I was sensible at once of a great relief. My anxieties and
  misadventures of last night were well paid for after all. I could look at my
  swollen wrists and say that without any hesitation, the watchers had departed
  from their watching, and what if they had carried away the King of Portugal's
  great jewelled cross? Helen Mayle had no need of it, indeed, her great regret
  now was that she could not get rid of what she had; and as for Cullen, to
  tell the truth, I did not care a snap of the fingers whether he found a
  fortune or must set to work to make one. Other men had been compelled to do
  it&mdash;better men too, deuce take him! We were well quit of George Glen and
  his gang, though the price of the quittance was heavy. I would get up at
  once, run across to Merchant's Point, and tell Helen Mayle&mdash;&mdash; My
  plans came to a sudden stop. Tell Helen Mayle precisely what? That Adam
  Mayle's grave had been rifled?</p>

  <p>I lay staring up at the ceiling as I debated that question, and suddenly
  it slipped from my mind. That grave had been rifled before, and quite
  recently. I was as certain of that in the sober light of the morning as I had
  been during the excitement of last night. Why? It was not for the chart of
  the treasure, since the chart had been left. And by whom? So after all, here
  was I, who had waked up in the best of spirits too, with the world grown
  comfortable, confronted with questions as perplexing as a man could wish for.
  It was, as Cullen Mayle had said, at the inn near Axminster, most
  discouraging. And I turned over in bed and tried to go to sleep, that I might
  drive them from my mind. I should have succeeded too, but just as I was in a
  doze there came a loud rapping at the door, and Dick Parmiter danced into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"They are gone, Mr. Berkeley," he cried.</p>

  <p>"I know," I grumbled; "I saw them go," and stretched out my arms and
  yawned.</p>

  <p>"Why, you have hurt your wrist," Dick exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"No," said I, "it was George Glen's shake of the hand."</p>

  <p>"They are gone," repeated Dick, gleefully, "all of them except Peter
  Tortue."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" I cried, sitting up in the bed.</p>

  <p>"All of them except Peter Tortue."</p>

  <p>"To be sure," said I, scratching my head.</p>

  <p>Now what in the world had Peter Tortue remained behind for? For no harm,
  that was evident, since I owed my life to his good offices last night. I was
  to remember that it was he who saved me. I was, then, to make some return.
  But what return?</p>

  <p>I threw my pillow at Parmiter's head.</p>

  <p>"Deuce take you, Dicky! My bed was not such a plaguey restful place before
  that it needed you to rumple it further. Well, since I mayn't sleep late i'
  the morning like a gentleman, I'll get up."</p>

  <p>I tried to put together some sort of plausible explanation which would
  serve for Helen Mayle while I was dressing. But I could not hit upon one, and
  besides Parmiter made such a to-do over brushing my clothes this morning that
  that alone was enough to drive all reasoning out of one's head.</p>

  <p>"Dick," said I as he handed me my coat, "you have had, if my memory serves
  me, some experience of womenfolk."</p>

  <p>Dick nodded his head in a mournful fashion.</p>

  <p>"Mother!" said he.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said I. "Now, here's a delicate question. Do you always tell
  womenfolk the truth?"</p>

  <p>"No," said he, stoutly.</p>

  <p>"Do you tell them&mdash;shall we say quibbles,&mdash; then?"</p>

  <p>"Quibbles?" said Dick, opening his mouth.</p>

  <p>"It is not a fruit, Dicky," said I, "so you need not keep it open. By
  quibbles I mean lies. Do you tell your womenfolk lies, when the truth is not
  good for them to know?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Dick, as steadily as before, "for they finds you out."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," I agreed. "But since you neither tell the truth nor tell
  lies, what in the world do you do?"</p>

  <p>"Well," answered Dick, "I say that it's a secret which mother isn't to
  know for a couple of days."</p>

  <p>"I see. And when the couple of days has gone?</p>

  <p>"Then mother has forgotten all about the secret."</p>

  <p>I reflected for a moment or two.</p>

  <p>"Dick."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever try that plan with Miss Helen?"</p>

  <p>"No," said he, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"I will," said I, airily, "or something like it."</p>

  <p>"Something like it would be best," said Dick.</p>

  <p>The story which I told to Helen was not after all very like it. I
  said:</p>

  <p>"The watchers have gone and gone for ever. They were here not for any
  revenge, but for their profit. There was a treasure in St. Helen's which
  Cullen Mayle was to show them the way to&mdash;if they could catch him and
  force him. They had some claim to it&mdash;I showed them the way."</p>

  <p>"You?" she exclaimed. "How?"</p>

  <p>"That I cannot tell you," said I. "I would beg you not to ask, but to let
  my silence content you. I could not tell you the truth and I do not think
  that I could invent a story to suit the occasion which would not ring false.
  The consequence is the one thing which concerns us, and there is no doubt of
  it. The watchers did not watch for an opportunity of revenge and they are
  gone."</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said. "I was right after all, you see. The hand stretched
  out of the dark has done this service. For it is your doing that they are
  gone?"</p>

  <p>I did not answer and she laughed a little and continued, "But I will not
  ask you. I will make shift to be content with your silence. Did Dick Parmiter
  come with you this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered with a laugh, "but he was not with me last night."</p>

  <p>Helen laughed again.</p>

  <p>"Ah," she cried! "So it was your doing, and I have not asked you." Then
  she grew serious of a sudden. "But since they are gone"&mdash;she exclaimed,
  in a minute, her whole face alight with her thought&mdash;"since they are
  gone, Cullen may come and come in safety."</p>

  <p>"Oh! yes, Cullen may come," I answered, perhaps a trifle roughly. "Cullen
  will be safe and may come. Indeed, I wonder that he was not here before this.
  He stole my horse upon the road and yet could not reach here first. I trudged
  a-foot, Cullen bestrode my horse and yet Tresco still pines for him. It is
  very strange unless he has a keen nose for danger."</p>

  <p>My behaviour very likely was not the politest imaginable, but then Helen's
  was no better. For although she displayed no anger at my rough words&mdash;I
  should not have cared a scrape of her wheezy fiddle if she had, but she did
  not, she merely laughed in my face with every appearance of enjoyment. I drew
  myself up very stiff. Here were all the limits of courtesy clearly
  over-stepped, but I at all events would not follow her example, nor allow her
  one glimpse of any exasperation which I might properly feel.</p>

  <p>"Shall I go out and search for him in the highways and hedges?" I asked
  with severity.</p>

  <p>"It would be magnanimous," said she biting her lip, and then her manner
  changed. "He rode your horse," she cried, "and yet he has fallen behind. He
  will be hurt then! Some accident has befallen him!"</p>

  <p>"Or he has wagered my horse at some roadside inn and lost! It was a good
  horse, too."</p>

  <p>She caught hold of my arm in some agitation.</p>

  <p>"Oh! be serious!" she prayed.</p>

  <p>"Serious quotha!" said I, drawing away from her hand with much dignity.
  "Let me assure you, madam, that the loss of a horse is a very serious affair,
  that the stealing of a horse is a very serious affair&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, well, I will buy it from you, saddle and stirrup and all," she
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Madam," said I, when I could get my speech. "There is no more to be
  said."</p>

  <p>"Heaven be praised!" said she. "And now it may be, you will condescend to
  listen to me. What am I to do? Suppose that he is hurt! Suppose that he is in
  trouble! Suppose that he still waits for my answer to his message! Suppose in
  a word that he does not come! What can I do? He may go hungering for a
  meal."</p>

  <p>I did not think the contingency probable, but Helen was now speaking with
  so much sincerity of distress that I could not say as much.</p>

  <p>"Unless he comes to Tresco I am powerless. It is true I have bequeathed
  everything to him, but then I am young," she said, with a most melancholy
  look in her big dark eyes. "Neither am I sickly."</p>

  <p>"I will go back along the road and search for him," and this I spoke with
  sincerity. She looked at me curiously.</p>

  <p>"Will you do that?" she asked in a doubtful voice, as though she did not
  know whether to be pleased or sorry.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, and a servant knocked at the door, and told me Parmiter
  wished to speak with me. I found the lad on the steps of the porch, and we
  walked down to the beach.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The Frenchman," said he, with a frightened air.</p>

  <p>"Peter Tortue?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>I led him further along the beach lest any of the windows of the house
  should be open towards us, and any one by the open window.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>Dick pointed up the hill.</p>

  <p>"At the shed?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He was lying in wait on the hillside, and ran down when he saw that
  I was alone. He stays in the shed for you, and you are to go to him
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Amongst the dead sailor-men?" said I, with a laugh. But the words were
  little short of blasphemy to Dick Parmiter. "Well, I was there last night,
  and no harm came to me."</p>

  <p>"You were there last night?" cried Dick. "Then you will not go?"</p>

  <p>"But I will," said I. "I am curious to hear what Tortue has to say to me.
  You may take my word for it, Dick, there's no harm in Peter Tortue. I shall
  be back within the hour. Hush! not a word of this!" for I saw Helen Mayle
  coming from the house towards us. I told her that I was called away, and
  would return.</p>

  <p>"Do you take Dick with you?" she asked, with too much indifference. She
  held a big hat of straw by the ribbons and swung it to and fro. She did that
  also with too much indifference.</p>

  <p>"No," said I, "I leave him behind. Make of him what you can. He cannot
  tell what he does not know."</p>

  <p>The sum of Dick's knowledge, I thought, amounted to no more than
  this&mdash;that I had last night visited the shed, in spite of the dead
  sailor-men. I forgot for the moment that he was in my bedroom when I rose
  that morning.</p>

  <p>The door of the shed was fastened on the inside; I rapped with my
  knuckles, and Tortue's voice asked who was there. When I told him, he
  unbarred the door.</p>

  <p>"There is no one behind you?" said he, peering over my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Nay! Do you fear that I have brought the constables to take you? You may
  live in Tresco till you die if you will. What! Should I betray you, whose
  life you saved only last night?"</p>

  <p>Peter opened the door wide.</p>

  <p>"A night!" said he, with a shrug of the shoulders. "One can forget more
  than that in a night, if one is so minded."</p>

  <p>I followed him into the shed. Here and there, through the chinks in the
  boards, a gleam of light slipped through. Outside it was noonday, within it
  was a sombre evening. I passed through the door of the partition into the
  inner room. The rafters above were lost in darkness, and before my eyes were
  accustomed to the gloom I stumbled over a slab of stone which had been lifted
  from its place in the floor. I turned to Tortue, who was just behind me, and
  he nodded in answer to my unspoken question. The spade and the pick had stood
  in that corner to the left, and this slab of stone had been removed in
  readiness. The darkness of the shed struck cold upon me all at once, as I
  thought of why that slab had been removed. I looked about me much as a man
  may look about his bedroom the day after he has been saved from his grave by
  the surgeon's knife. Everything stands as it did yesterday&mdash;this chair
  in this corner, that table just upon that pattern of the carpet, but it is
  all very strange and unfamiliar. It was against that board in the partition
  that I leaned my back; there sat George Glen with his evil smile, here Tortue
  polished his knife.</p>

  <p>"Let us go out into the sunlight, for God's sake!" said I, and my foot
  struck against a piece of iron, which went tinkling across the stone floor. I
  picked it up. "They are gone," said I, with a shiver, "and there's an end of
  them. But this shed is a nightmarish sort of place for me. For God's sake,
  let us get into the sun!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, they are gone," said Tortue, "but they would have stayed if they
  dared, if I hadn't set you free, for they went without the cross."</p>

  <p>I was still holding that piece of iron in my hand. By the feel of it, it
  was a key, and I slipped it into my pocket quite unconsciously, for Tortue's
  words took me aback with surprise.</p>

  <p>"Without the jewelled cross? But you had the plan," said I, as I stepped
  into the open. "I heard you describe the spot&mdash;three chains in a line
  east of the east window in the south aisle of the church."</p>

  <p>"There was no trace of the cross."</p>

  <p>"It was true then!" I exclaimed. "I was sure of it, even after Roper had
  found the stick and the plan. It was true&mdash;that grave had been rifled
  before."</p>

  <p>"Why should the plan have been put back, then?"</p>

  <p>"God knows! I don't."</p>

  <p>"Besides, if the grave had been rifled, the spot of ground on St. Helen's
  Island had not. There had been no spade at work there."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And you followed out the directions?"</p>

  <p>"To the letter. Three chains east by the compass of the eastern window in
  the south aisle of St. Helen's Church, and four feet deep! We dug five and
  six feet deep. There was nothing, nor had the ground been disturbed."</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand it. Why should Adam Mayle have been at such pains to
  hide the plan? Was it a grim joke to be played on Cullen?"</p>

  <p>There was no means of answering the problem, and I set it aside.</p>

  <p>"After all, they are gone," said I. "That is the main thing."</p>

  <p>"All except me," said Tortue.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Why have you stayed?"</p>

  <p>Tortue threw himself on the ground and chewed at a stalk of grass.</p>

  <p>"I saved your life last night," said he.</p>

  <p>"I know. Why did you do it? Why did you cover my mistakes in that shed?
  Why did you cut the rope?"</p>

  <p>"Because you could serve my turn. The cross!" he exclaimed, with a
  flourish. "I do not want the cross." He looked at me steadily for an instant
  with his shrewd eyes. "I want a man to nail on the cross, and you can help me
  to him. Where is Cullen Mayle?"</p>

  <p>The words startled me all the more because there was no violence in the
  voice which spoke them&mdash;only a cold, deliberate resolution. I was
  nevermore thankful for the gift of ignorance than upon this occasion. I could
  assure him quite honestly,</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>"But last night you knew."</p>

  <p>"I spoke of many things last night of which I had no knowledge&mdash;the
  cross, the plan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You knew where the plan was. Flesh! but you knew that!"</p>

  <p>"I guessed."</p>

  <p>"Guess, then, where Cullen Mayle is, and I'll be content."</p>

  <p>"I have no hint to prompt a guess." Tortue gave no sign of anger at my
  answer. He sat upon the grass, and looked with a certain sadness at the
  shed.</p>

  <p>"It does not, after all, take much more than a night to forget," said
  he.</p>

  <p>"I am telling you the truth, Tortue," said I, earnestly. "I do not know. I
  never met Cullen Mayle but once, and that was at a roadside inn. He stole my
  horse upon that occasion, so that I have no reason to bear him any
  goodwill."</p>

  <p>"But because of him you came down to Tresco?" said Tortue quickly.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Tortue looked at me doubtfully. Then he looked at the house, and</p>

  <p>"Ah! It was because of the girl."</p>

  <p>"No! No!" I answered vehemently. I could not explain to him why I had
  come, and fortunately he did not ask for an explanation. He just nodded his
  head, and stood up without another word.</p>

  <p>"I do not forget," said I pointing to the shed. "And if you should be in
  any need&mdash;&mdash;" But I got no further in my offer of help; for he
  turned upon me suddenly, and anger at last had got the upper hand with
  him.</p>

  <p>"Money, is it not?" he cried, staring down at me with his eyes ablaze.
  "Ay, that's the way with gentlefolk! You would give me as much as a guinea no
  doubt&mdash;a whole round gold guinea. Yes, I am in need," and with a violent
  movement he clasped his hands together. "Virgin Mary, but I am in need of
  Cullen Mayle, and you offer me a guinea!" and then hunching his shoulders he
  strode off over the hill.</p>

  <p>So Helen Mayle's instinct was right. Out of the five men there was one who
  waited for Cullen's coming with another object than to secure the diamond
  cross. Would he continue to wait? I could not doubt that he would, when I
  thought upon his last vehement burst of passion. Tortue would wait upon
  Tresco, until, if Cullen did not come himself, some word of Cullen's
  whereabouts dropped upon his ear. It was still urgent, therefore, that Cullen
  Mayle should be warned, and if I was to go away in search of him, Helen must
  be warned too.</p>

  <p>I walked back again towards Merchant's Point with this ill news heavy upon
  my mind, and as I came over the lip of the hollow, I saw Helen waiting by the
  gate in the palisade. She saw me at the same moment, and came up towards me
  at a run.</p>

  <p>"Is there more ill-news?" I asked myself. "Or has Cullen Mayle returned?"
  and I ran quickly down to her.</p>

  <p>"Has he come?" I asked, for she came to a stop in front of me with her
  face white and scared.</p>

  <p>"Who?" said she absently, as she looked me over.</p>

  <p>"Cullen Mayle," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Cullen," she said, and it struck me as curious that this was the
  first time I had heard her speak his name with indifference.</p>

  <p>"Because he must not show himself here. There is a reason! There is a
  danger still!"</p>

  <p>"A danger," she said, in a loud cry, and then "Oh! I shall never forgive
  myself!"</p>

  <p>"For what?"</p>

  <p>She caught hold of my arm.</p>

  <p>"See?" she said. "Your coat-sleeve is frayed. It was a rope did that last
  night. No use to deny it. Dick told me. He saw that a rope too had seared
  your wrists. Tell me! What happened last night? I must know!"</p>

  <p>"You promised not to ask," said I, moving away from her.</p>

  <p>"Well, I break my promise," said she. "But I must know," and she turned
  and kept pace with me, down the hill, through the house into the garden.
  During that time she pleaded for an answer in an extreme agitation, and I
  confess that her agitation was a sweet flattery to me. I was inclined to make
  the most of it, for I could not tell how she would regard the story of my
  night's adventures. It was I after all who caused old Adam Mayle's bones to
  be disturbed; and I understood that it was really on that account that I had
  shrunk from telling her. She had a right to know, no doubt. Besides there was
  this new predicament of Tortue's stay. I determined to make a clean breast of
  the matter. She listened very quietly without an exclamation or a shudder;
  only her face lost even the little colour which it had, and a look of horror
  widened in her eyes. I told her of my capture on the hillside, of Tortue's
  intervention, of the Cross and the stick in the coffin. I drew a breath and
  described that scene in the Abbey grounds, and how I escaped; and still she
  said no word and gave no sign. I told her of their futile search upon St.
  Helen's, and how I had witnessed their departure from the top of the Castle
  Down. Still she walked by my side silent, and wrapped in horror. I faltered
  through this last incident of Tortue's stay and came to a lame finish,
  amongst the trees at the end of the garden. We turned and walked the length
  of the garden to the house.</p>

  <p>"I know," I said. "When I guessed the stick held the plan, I should have
  held my tongue. But I did not think of that. It was not easy to think at all
  just at that time, and I must needs be quick. They spoke of attacking the
  house, and I dreaded that.... I should not have been able to give you any
  warning.... I should not have been able to give you any help ... for, you
  see, the slab of stone was already removed in the shed."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't!" she cried out, and pressed her hands to her temples. "I shall
  never forgive myself. Think! A week ago you and I were strangers. It cannot
  be right that you should go in deadly peril because of me."</p>

  <p>"Madam," said I, greatly relieved, "you make too much of a thing of no
  great consequence. I hope to wear my life lightly."</p>

  <p>"Always?" said she quickly, as she stopped and looked at me.</p>

  <p>I stopped, too, and looked at her.</p>

  <p>"I think so," said I, but without the same confidence. "Always."</p>

  <p>She had a disconcerting habit of laughing when there was no occasion
  whatever for laughter. She fell into that habit now, and I hastened to recall
  her to Tortue's embarrassing presence on the island.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said I, "a word to the Governor at Star Castle and we are rid
  of him. But he stood between me and my death, and he trusts to my
  silence."</p>

  <p>"We must keep that silence," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Yet he waits for Cullen Mayle, and&mdash;it will not be well if those two
  men meet."</p>

  <p>"Why does he wait? Do you know that, too?"</p>

  <p>I did not know, as I told her, though I had my opinion, of which I did not
  tell her.</p>

  <p>"The great comfort is this. Tortue did not make one upon that expedition
  to the Sierra Leone River, but his son did. Tortue only fell in with George
  Glen and his gang at an ale-house in Wapping, and <i>after</i>&mdash;that is
  the point&mdash;after Glen had lost track of Cullen Mayle. Tortue, therefore,
  has never seen Cullen, does not know him. We have an advantage there. So
  should he come to Tresco, while I go back along the road to search for him,
  you must make your profit of that advantage."</p>

  <p>She stopped again.</p>

  <p>"You will go, then?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes."</p>

  <p>She shook her head, reflectively.</p>

  <p>"It is not right," she said.</p>

  <p>"I am going chiefly," said I, "because I wish to recover my horse."</p>

  <p>She always laughed when I mentioned that horse, and her laughter always
  made me angry.</p>

  <p>"Do you doubt I have a horse?" I asked. "Or rather <i>had</i> a horse?
  Because Cullen Mayle stole it, stole it deliberately from under my
  nose&mdash;a very valuable horse which I prized even beyond its
  value&mdash;and he stole it."</p>

  <p>The girl was in no way impressed by my wrath, and she said,
  pleasantly:</p>

  <p>"I am glad you said that. I am glad to know that with it all, you are mean
  like other men."</p>

  <p>"Madam," I returned, "when Cullen Mayle stole my horse, and rode away upon
  it, he put out his tongue at me. I made no answer. Nor do I make any answer
  to the remark which you have this moment addressed to me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir!" said she, "here are fine words, and here's a curtsey to match
  them;" and spreading out her frock with each hand, she sank elaborately to
  the very ground.</p>

  <p>We walked for some while longer in the garden, without speech, and the
  girl's impertinence gradually slipped out of my mind. The sea murmured lazily
  upon the other side of the hedge, and I had full in view St. Helen's Island
  and the ruined church upon its summit. The south aisle of the church pointed
  towards the house, and through the tracery of a rude window I could see the
  sky.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who in the world can have visited the Abbey burial-ground and
  rifled that grave?"</p>

  <p>The question perplexed me more and more, and I wondered whether Helen
  could throw light upon it. So I asked her, but she bent her brows in a frown,
  and in a little she answered:</p>

  <p>"No, I can think of no one."</p>

  <p>I held out my hand to her. "This is good-bye," said I.</p>

  <p>"You go to-day?" she asked, but did not take my hand.</p>

  <p>"Yes, if I can find a ship to take me. I go to St. Helen's first. Can I
  borrow your boat; Dick will bring it back. I want to see that east window in
  the aisle."</p>

  <p>A few more words were said, and I promised to return, whether I found
  Cullen Mayle or not. And I did return, but sooner than I expected, for I
  returned that afternoon.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"><small>CHAPTER XV</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE LOST KEY IS FOUND</h2>

  <p class="first">It happened in this way. I took Dick Parmiter with me and
  sailed across to St. Helen's. We beached the boat on the sand near to the
  well and quarantine hut, and climbed up eastwards till we came to the hole
  which Glen's party had dug. The ground sloped away from the church in this
  direction; and as I stood on the edge of the hole with my face towards the
  side of the aisle, I could just see over the grass the broken cusp of the
  window. It was exactly opposite to me.</p>

  <p>It occurred to me, however, that Glen had measured the distance wrong. So
  I sent Dick in the boat across to Tresco to borrow a measure, and while he
  was away I examined the ground there around; but it was all covered with
  grass and bracken, which evidently had not been disturbed. Here and there
  were bushes of brambles, but, as I was at pains to discover, no search for
  the cross had been made beneath them.</p>

  <p>In the midst of my search Dick came back to me with a tape measure, and we
  set to work from the window of the church. The measure was for a few yards,
  so that when we had run it out to its full length, keeping ever in the
  straight line, it was necessary to fix some sort of mark in the ground, and
  start afresh from that; and for a mark I used a big iron key which I had in
  my pocket. Three chains brought us exactly to the hole which had been dug,
  and holding the key in my hand, I said:</p>

  <p>"They made no mistake. It is plain the plan was carelessly drawn."</p>

  <p>And Dick said to me: "That's the key of our cottage."</p>

  <p>I handed it to him to make sure. He turned it over in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he, "that's the key;" and he added reproachfully, with no
  doubt a lively recollection of his mother's objurgations: "So you had it all
  the time."</p>

  <p>"I found it this morning, Dick," said I.</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"In the shed on the Castle Down. Now, how the deuce did it get there? The
  dead sailormen had no use for keys."</p>

  <p>"It's very curious," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Very curious and freakish," said I, and I sat down on the grass to think
  the matter out.</p>

  <p>"Let me see, your mother missed it in the morning after I came to
  Tresco."</p>

  <p>"That's three days ago." And I could hardly believe the boy. It seemed to
  me that months had passed. But he was right.</p>

  <p>"Yes, three days ago. Your mother missed it in the morning. It is likely,
  then, that it was taken from the lock of the door the night before."</p>

  <p>"That would be the night," said Dick, suspiciously, "when you tapped on my
  window."</p>

  <p>"The night, in fact, when I first landed on Tresco. Wait a little."</p>

  <p>Dick sat still upon the grass, and I took the key from his hand into mine.
  There were many questions which at that moment perplexed me&mdash;that
  hideous experience in Cullen Mayle's bedroom, the rifling of Adam Mayle's
  grave, the replacing of the plan in it and the disappearance of the cross,
  and I was in that state of mind when everything new and at all strange
  presented itself as a possible clue to the mystery. It seemed to me that the
  key which I held was very much more than a mere rusty iron key of a door that
  was never locked. I felt that it was the key to the door of the mystery which
  baffled me, and that feeling increased in me into a solid conviction as I
  held it in my hand. I seemed to see the door opening, and opening very
  slowly. The chamber beyond the door was dark, but my eyes would grow
  accustomed to the darkness if only I did not turn them aside. As it was, even
  now I began to see dim, shadowy things which, uncomprehended though they
  were, struck something of a thrill into my blood, and something of a chill,
  too.</p>

  <p>"The night that I landed upon Tresco," I said, "we crossed the Castle
  Down, I nearly fell on to the roof of the shed, where all the dead sailormen
  were screeching in unison."</p>

  <p>"Yes!" said Dick, in a low voice, and I too looked around me to see that
  we were not overheard. Dick moved a little nearer to me with an uneasy
  working of his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the woman who passed us?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"You said it was a woman."</p>

  <p>"And it was."</p>

  <p>I had the best of reasons to be positive upon, that point. I had scratched
  my hand in the gorse and I had seen the blood of my scratches the next day on
  the dress of the woman who had brushed against me as she passed. That woman
  was Helen Mayle. Had she come from the shed? What did she need with the
  key?</p>

  <p>"Is that shed ever used?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not now."</p>

  <p>"Whom does it belong to?"</p>

  <p>He nodded over towards Merchant's Rock.</p>

  <p>"Then Adam Mayle used it?"</p>

  <p>"Cullen Mayle used it."</p>

  <p>"Cullen!"</p>

  <p>I sprang up to my feet and walked away; and walked back; and walked away
  again. The shadowy things were indeed becoming visible; my eyes were growing
  indeed accustomed to the darkness; and, indeed, the door was opening. Should
  I close, slam it to, lock it again and never open it? For I was afraid.</p>

  <p>But if I did shut it and lock it I should come back to it perpetually, I
  should be perpetually fingering the lock. No; I would open the door wide and
  see what was within the room. I came back to Dick.</p>

  <p>"What did Cullen Mayle use it for?"</p>

  <p>"He was in league with the Brittany smugglers. Brandy, wine, and lace were
  landed on the beach of a night and carried up to the shed."</p>

  <p>"Were they safe there?"</p>

  <p>Dick laughed. Here he was upon firm ground, and he answered with some
  pride:</p>

  <p>"When Cullen Mayle lived here, the collector of customs daren't for his
  life have landed on Tresco in daylight."</p>

  <p>"And at night the dead sailormen kept watch."</p>

  <p>"There wasn't a man who would go near the shed."</p>

  <p>"So Cullen Mayle would not have needed a key to lock the shed?"</p>

  <p>"No, indeed!" and another laugh.</p>

  <p>"Could he have needed a key for any other purpose? Dick, we will go
  slowly, very slowly," and I sat for some while hesitating with a great fear
  very cold at my heart. That door was opening fast. Should I push it open,
  wide? With one bold thrust of the hand I could do it&mdash;if I would. But
  should I see clearly into the room&mdash;so clearly that I could not mistake
  a single thing I saw. No, I would go on, gently forcing the door back, and
  all the while accustoming my vision to the gloom.</p>

  <p>"Has that shed been used since Cullen Mayle was driven away?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You are certain? Oh, be certain, very certain, before you speak."</p>

  <p>Dick looked at me in surprise, as well he might; for I have no doubt my
  voice betrayed something of the fear and pain I felt.</p>

  <p>"I am certain."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, have you, has any one heard these dead sailormen making
  merry&mdash;God save the mark&mdash;since that shed has been disused?"</p>

  <p>Dick thought with considerable effort before he answered. But it did not
  matter; I was certain what his answer would be.</p>

  <p>"I have never heard them," he said.</p>

  <p>"Nor have met others who have?"</p>

  <p>"No," said he, after a second deliberation, "I don't remember any one who
  has."</p>

  <p>"From the time Cullen Mayle left Tresco to the night when we crossed the
  Down to Merchant's Rock? There's one thing more. Cullen was in league with
  the Brittany smugglers. He would be in league, then, with smugglers from
  Penzance, who would put him over to Tresco secretly, if he needed it?"</p>

  <p>"He was very good friends with all smugglers," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, rising from the ground, "we will sail back, Dick, to
  Tresco, and have another look into that shed."</p>

  <p>I made him steer the boat eastwards and land behind the point of the old
  Grimsby Harbour, on which the Block House stands, and out of sight of
  Merchant's Point. It was not that I did not wish to be seen by any one in
  that house. But&mdash;but&mdash;well, I did not wish at that moment to land
  near it&mdash;to land where a voice now grown familiar might call to me.</p>

  <p>From the Block House we struck up through Dolphin Town on to the empty
  hill, and so came to the shed. I pushed open the door and went in. Dick
  followed me timidly.</p>

  <p>The floor was of stone. I had been thinking of that as we sailed across
  from St. Helen's. I had been thinking, too, that when I was carried into the
  inner room the door of the partition was jambed against the floor, that Roper
  had kicked it open, and that, as it yielded, I had heard some iron thing
  spring from beneath it and jingle across the floor. That iron thing was,
  undoubtedly, the key which I held in my hand.</p>

  <p>I placed it again under the door. There was a fairly strong wind blowing.
  I told Dick to set the outer door wide open to the wind, which he did. And
  immediately the inner door began to swing backwards and forwards in the
  draught. But it dragged the key with it, and it dragged the key over the
  stone floor. The shed was filled with a harsh, shrill, rasping sound, which
  set one's fingernails on edge. I set my hand to the door and swung it more
  quickly backwards and forwards. The harsh sound rose to a hideous inhuman
  grating screech.</p>

  <p>"There are your dead sailormen, Dick," said I. "It was Cullen Mayle who
  took the key from your door on the night I landed on Tresco&mdash;Cullen
  Mayle, who had my horse to carry him on the road and smuggler friends at
  Penzance to carry him over the sea. It was Cullen Mayle who was in this shed
  that night, and used his old trick to scare people from his hiding-place. It
  was Cullen Mayle who was first in the Abbey burial ground. No doubt Cullen
  Mayle has that cross. And it was Cullen Mayle whom the woman&mdash;&mdash;
  But, there, enough."</p>

  <p>The door was wide open now, and this key had opened it. I could see
  everything clearly. My eyes were, indeed, now accustomed to the
  gloom&mdash;so accustomed that, as I stepped from the shed, all the sunlight
  seemed struck out of the world.</p>

  <p>It was all clear. Helen Mayle had come up to the shed that night. She had
  told Cullen of the stick in the coffin&mdash;yes, she must have done that.
  She told him of the men who watched. What more had passed between them I
  could not guess, but she had come back with despair in her heart, and, in the
  strength of her despair, had walked late at night into his room&mdash;with
  that silk noose in her hand.</p>

  <p>That she loved him&mdash;that was evident. But why could she not have been
  frank with me? Cullen had spoken with her, had been warned by her, had left
  the island since. Why had she kept up this pretence of anxiety on his
  account, of fear that he was in distress, of dread lest he return unwitting
  of his peril and fall into Glen's hand? Clutterbuck's word "duplicity" came
  stinging back to me.</p>

  <p>I sent Dick away to sail the boat back to Merchant's Point, and lay for a
  long while on the open hillside, while the sun sank and evening came. It was
  only yesterday that she had played in her garden upon the violin. I had felt
  that I knew her really for the first time as she sat with her pale face
  gleaming purely through the darkness. Why could she not have been frank to
  me? The question assailed me; I cried it out. Surely there was some answer,
  an answer which would preserve my picture of her in her tangled garden,
  untarnished within my memories. Surely, surely! And how could such deep love
  mate with duplicity?</p>

  <p>I put the scarf into my pocket, and crossed the hill again and came down
  to Merchant's Point. I could not make up my mind to go in. How could I speak
  of that night when I slept in Cullen Mayle's bedroom? I lay now upon the
  gorse watching the bright windows. Now I went down to the sea and its kindly
  murmurings. And at last, about ten o'clock of the night, a white figure came
  slowly from the porch and stood beside me.</p>

  <p>"You have been here&mdash;how long?&mdash;I have watched you," she said
  very gently. "What is it? Why didn't you come in?"</p>

  <p>I took both her hands in mine and looked into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Will you be frank with me if I do?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," she said, and her face was all wonder and all concern. "You
  hurt me&mdash;no, not your hands, but your distrust."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"><small>CHAPTER XVI</small></a><br>
  <br>
  AN UNSATISFACTORY EXPLANATION</h2>

  <p class="first">We went into the house, but no farther than the hall. For
  the moment we were come there she placed herself in front of me. I remember
  that the door of the house was never shut, and through the opening I could
  see a shoulder of the hill and the stars above it, and hear the long roar of
  the waves upon the beach.</p>

  <p>"We are good friends, I hope, you and I," she said. "Plain speech is the
  privilege of such friendship. Speak, then, as though you were speaking to a
  man. Wherein have I not been frank with you?"</p>

  <p>There must be, I thought, some explanation which would free her from all
  suspicion of deceit. Else, how could she speak with so earnest a tongue or
  look with eyes so steady?</p>

  <p>"As man to man, then," I answered, "I am grieved I was not told that
  Cullen Mayle had come secretly to Tresco and had thence escaped."</p>

  <p>"Cullen!" she said, in a wondering voice. "He was on Tresco! Where?"</p>

  <p>I constrained myself to answer patiently.</p>

  <p>"In the Abbey grounds, on St. Helen's Island, and&mdash; " I paused,
  thinking, nay hoping, that even at this eleventh hour she would speak, she
  would explain. But she kept silence, nor did her eyes ever waver from my
  face.</p>

  <p>&mdash;"And," I continued, "on Castle Down."</p>

  <p>"There!" she exclaimed, and added, thoughtfully, "Yes, there he would be
  safe. But when was Cullen upon Tresco? When?"</p>

  <p>So the deception was to be kept up.</p>

  <p>"On the night," I answered, "when I first came to Merchant's Point."</p>

  <p>She looked at me for a little without a word, and I could imagine that it
  was difficult for her to hit upon an opportune rejoinder. There was one
  question, however, which might defer her acknowledgments of her concealments,
  and, to be sure, she asked it:</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?" and before I could answer, she added another,
  which astonished me by its assurance. "When did you find out?"</p>

  <p>I told her, I trust with patience, of the key and the various steps by
  which I had found out. "And as to when," I said, "it was this afternoon."</p>

  <p>At that she gave a startled cry, and held out a trembling hand towards
  me.</p>

  <p>"Had you known," she cried, "had you known only yesterday that Cullen had
  come and had safely got him back, you would have been spared all you went
  through last night!"</p>

  <p>"What I went through last night!" I exclaimed, passionately. "Oh, that is
  of small account to me, and I beg you not to suffer it to trouble your peace.
  But&mdash;I do not say had I known yesterday, I say had I been <i>told</i>
  yesterday&mdash;I should have been spared a very bitter disappointment."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand," she said, and again she put out her hand towards me
  and drew it in and stretched it out again with an appearance of distress to
  which even at that moment I felt myself softening. However, I took no heed of
  the hand. "In some way you blame me, but I do not understand."</p>

  <p>"You would, perhaps, find it easier to understand if you were at the pains
  to remember that on the night I landed upon Tresco, I came over Castle Down
  and past the shed to Merchant's Point."</p>

  <p>"Well?" and she spoke with more coldness, as though her pride made her
  stubborn in defiance. No doubt she was unaware that I was close to her that
  night. It remained for me to reveal that, and God knows I did it with no
  sense of triumph, but only a great sadness.</p>

  <p>"As I stood in the darkness a little this side of the shed, a girl hurried
  down the hill from it. She was dressed in white, so that I could make no
  mistake. On the other hand, my dark coat very likely made me difficult to
  see. The girl passed me, and so closely that her frock brushed against my
  hand. Now, can you name the girl?"</p>

  <p>She looked at me with the same stubbornness.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "I cannot."</p>

  <p>"On the other hand," said I, "I can. One circumstance enables me to be
  certain. I slipped on the grass that night, and catching hold of a bush of
  gorse pricked my hand."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember that."</p>

  <p>"I pricked my hand a minute or two before the girl passed me. As I say,
  she brushed against my hand, which was bleeding, and the next day I saw the
  blood smirched upon a white frock&mdash;and who wore it, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"I did," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Then you own it. You will own too that I have some cause of
  discontentment in that you have played with me, whose one thought was to
  serve you like an honest gentleman."</p>

  <p>And at that the stubbornness, the growing resentment at my questions, died
  clean out of her face.</p>

  <p>"You would have!" she cried eagerly. "You would indeed have cause for more
  than discontent had I played with you. But you do not mean that. You cannot
  think that I would use any trickeries with you. Oh! take back your words! For
  indeed they hurt me. You are mistaken here. I wore the frock, but it was not
  I who was on Castle Down that night. It was not I who brushed past
  you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And the stain?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"How it came there I do not know," she said. "But this I do know,&mdash;it
  was not your hand that marked it. I never knew that Cullen was on Tresco. I
  never saw him, much less spoke to him. You will believe that? No! Why should
  I have kept it secret if I had?" and her head drooped as she saw that still I
  did not believe.</p>

  <p>There was silence between us. She stood without changing her attitude, her
  head bent, her hands nervously clasping and unclasping. The wind came through
  the open door into the hall. Once in the silence Helen caught her breath; it
  was as though she checked a sob; and gradually a thought came into my mind
  which would serve to explain her silence&mdash;which would, perhaps, justify
  it&mdash;which, at all events, made of it a mistaken act of kindness. So I
  spoke with all gentleness&mdash;and with a little remorse, too, for the
  harshness I had shown:</p>

  <p>"You said we were good friends, you hoped; and, for my part, I can say
  that the words were aptly chosen. I am your friend&mdash;your good
  <i>friend</i>. You will understand? I want you also to understand that it was
  not even so much as friendship which brought me down to Tresco. It was Dick's
  sturdy example, it was my utter weariness, and some spark of shame Dick
  kindled in me. I was living, though upon my soul <i>living</i> is not the
  word, in one tiresome monotony of disgraceful days. I had made my fortune,
  and in the making had somehow unlearnt how fitly to enjoy it."</p>

  <p>"But this I know," interrupted Helen, now lifting her face to me.</p>

  <p>"I never told you."</p>

  <p>"But my violin told me. Do you remember? I wanted to know you through and
  through, to the heart's core. So I took my violin and played to you in the
  garden. And your face spoke in answer. So I knew you."</p>

  <p>It was strange. This confession she made with a blush and a great deal of
  confusion&mdash;a confession of a trick if you will, but a trick to which no
  one could object, by which anyone might be flattered. But that other more
  serious duplicity she could deny with an unwavering assurance!</p>

  <p>"You know then," I went on. "It makes it easier for me. I want you to
  understand then that it was to serve myself I came, and I do verily believe
  that I have served myself better than I have served you. Why, I did not even
  know what you were like. I did not inquire of Clutterbuck, he drew no picture
  of you to persuade me to my journey. Thus then there is no reason why you
  should be silent concerning Cullen out of any consideration for me."</p>

  <p>She looked at me in perplexity. My hint had not sufficed. I must make
  myself more clear.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt," I continued, "that you have seen. No doubt I might have
  been more circumspect. No doubt I have betrayed myself this last day. But,
  believe me, you are under no debt to me. If I can bring Cullen Mayle back to
  you, I will not harbour a thought of jealousy."</p>

  <p>Did she understand? I could not be sure. But I saw her whole face brighten
  and smile&mdash;it was as though a glory shone upon it&mdash;and her figure
  straighten with a sort of pride. Did she understand at the last that she need
  practise no concealments? But she said nothing, she waited for me to say what
  more I had to say. Well, I could make the matter yet more plain.</p>

  <p>"Besides," I said, "I knew&mdash;I knew very well before I set out from
  London, Clutterbuck told me. So that it is my own fault, you see, if when I
  came here I took no account of what he told me. And even so, believe me, I do
  not regret the fault."</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant Clutterbuck!" she exclaimed, with something almost of alarm.
  "He told you what?"</p>

  <p>"He told me of a night very like this. You were standing in this hall,
  very likely as you stand now, and the door was open and the breeze and the
  sound of the sea came through the open door as it does now. Only where I
  stand Cullen Mayle stood, asking you to follow him out through the world. And
  you would have followed, you did indeed begin to follow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>So far I had got when she broke in passionately, with her eyes afire!</p>

  <p>"It is not true! How can men speak such lies? Lieutenant Clutterbuck! I
  know&mdash;he told me the same story. It would have been much easier, so much
  franker, had he said outright he was tired of his&mdash;friendship for me and
  wished an end to it. I should have liked him the better had he been so frank.
  But that he should tell you the same story. Oh! it is despicable&mdash;and
  you believe it?" she challenged me. "You believe that story. You believe,
  too, I went to a trysting with Cullen on Castle Down, the night you came, and
  kept it secret from you and let you run the peril of your life. You will have
  it, in a word, whatever I may say or do," and she wrung her hands with a
  queer helplessness. "You will have it that I love him. Pity, a sense of
  injustice, a feeling that I wrongly possess what is rightly his&mdash;these
  things you will not allow can move me. No, I must love him."</p>

  <p>"Have I not proof you do?" I answered. "Not from Clutterbuck, but from
  yourself. Have I not proof into what despair your love could throw you?" And
  I took from my pocket the silk scarf. "Where did I get this?"</p>

  <p>She took it from my hands, while her face softened. She drew it through
  her fingers, and a smile parted her lips. She raised her eyes to me with a
  certain shyness, and she answered shyly:</p>

  <p>"Yet you say you were not curious to know anything of me in London before
  you started to the West."</p>

  <p>The answer was no answer at all. I repeated my question:</p>

  <p>"How do I come to have that scarf?"</p>

  <p>"I can but guess," she said; "I did not know that Lieutenant Clutterbuck
  possessed it. But it could be no one else. You asked it of Lieutenant
  Clutterbuck in London."</p>

  <p>For a moment I could not believe that I had heard a right. I stared at
  her. It was impossible that any woman could carry effrontery to so high a
  pitch. But she repeated her words.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant Clutterbuck gave it to you no doubt in London, and&mdash;will
  you tell me?&mdash;I should like to know. Did you ask him for it?"</p>

  <p>Should I strip away this pretence? Should I compel her to own where I
  found it and how I came by it? But it seemed not worth while. I turned on my
  heel without a word, and went straight out through the open door and on to
  the hillside.</p>

  <p>And so this was the second night which I spent in the gorse of Castle
  Down. One moment I was hot to go back to London and speak to no woman for the
  rest of my days. The next I was all for finding Cullen Mayle and heaping
  coals of fire upon Helen's head. The coals of fire carried the day in the
  end.</p>

  <p>As morning broke I walked down to the Palace Inn fully resolved. I would
  search for Cullen Mayle until I found him. I would bring him back. I would
  see him married to Helen from a dark corner in St. Mary's Church, and when
  the pair were properly unhappy and miserable, as they would undoubtedly
  become&mdash;I was very sorry, but miserable they would be&mdash;why then I
  would send her a letter. The writing in the letter should be "Ha!
  ha!"&mdash;not a word more, not even a signature, but just "Ha! ha!" on a
  blank sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>But, as I have said, I had grown very young these last few days.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"><small>CHAPTER XVII</small></a><br>
  <br>
  CULLEN MAYLE COMES HOME</h2>

  <p class="first">The search was entirely unsuccessful. Through the months of
  November and December I travelled hither and thither, but I had no hint as to
  Cullen Mayle's whereabouts; and towards the end of the year I took passage in
  a barque bound for St. Mary's, where I landed the day before Christmas and
  about the fall of the dusk. It was my intention to cross over that night to
  Tresco and report my ill-success, which I was resolved to do with a deal of
  stateliness. I was also curious to know whether Peter Tortue was still upon
  the island.</p>

  <p>But as I walked along the street of Hugh Town to the "Dolphin" Inn, by the
  Customs House, a band of women dancing and shouting, with voices
  extraordinarily hoarse, swept round the corner. I fell plump amongst them,
  and discovered they were men masquerading as women. Moreover, they stopped
  me, and were for believing that I was a woman masquerading as a man; and,
  indeed, when they had let me go I did come upon a party of girls dressed up
  for sea captains and the like, who swaggered, counterfeiting a manly walk,
  and drawing their hangers upon one another with a great show of spirit.</p>

  <p>The reason of these transformations was explained to me at the "Dolphin."
  It seems that they call this sort of amusement "a goose-dancing," and the
  young people exercise it in these islands at Christmas time. I was told that
  it would be impossible for me to hire a boatman to put me over to Tresco that
  night; so I made the best of the matter, and to pass the time stepped out
  again into the street, which was now lighted up with many torches and crowded
  with masqueraders. They went dancing and singing from house to house; the
  women paid their addresses with an exaggeration of courtly manners to the
  men, who, dressed in the most uncouth garments that could be devised,
  received them with a droll shyness and modesty, and altogether, what with
  liquor and music, the festival went with a deal of noise and spirit. But in
  the midst of it one of these false women, with a great bonnet pulled forward
  over her face, clapped a hand upon my shoulder and said in my ear:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Berkeley, I hope you have been holding better putt cards of late;"
  and would have run on, but I caught him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Featherstone," said I, "you stole my horse; I have a word to say to
  you."</p>

  <p>"I have not the time to listen," said he, wrenching his arm free as he
  flung himself into the thick of the crowd. I kept close upon his heels,
  however, which he perceived, and drawing into a corner he suddenly turned
  round upon me.</p>

  <p>"Your horse is dead," said he. "I very much regret it; but I will pay you,
  for I have but now come into an inheritance. I will pay you for it
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I did not follow you to speak of the horse, or to Mr. Featherstone at
  all, but to Mr. Cullen Mayle."</p>

  <p>"You know me?" he exclaimed, looking about him lest the name should have
  been overheard.</p>

  <p>"And have news for you," I added. "Will you follow me to the
  'Dolphin?'"</p>

  <p>I went back to the inn, secured from my host a room where we could be
  private, and went out to the door. Cullen Mayle was waiting; he followed me
  quickly in, hiding his face so that no one could recognise him, and when the
  door was shut&mdash;</p>

  <p>"How in the world did you come to know of my name?" said he. "I cannot
  think, but I shall be obliged if you will keep it secret for a day or so, for
  I am not sure but what I may have some inconvenient friends among these
  islands."</p>

  <p>"Those inconvenient friends are all gone but one," said I.</p>

  <p>"You know that too," he exclaimed. "Indeed, Mr. Berkeley, you seem to be
  very well acquainted with my affairs; but I cannot regret it, since you give
  me such comforting news. Only one of my inconvenient friends left! Why, I am
  a match for one&mdash;I think I may say so without vaunting&mdash;so it seems
  I can come to Tresco and take up my inheritance."</p>

  <p>With that he began briskly to unhook the cotton dress which he had put on
  over his ordinary clothes.</p>

  <p>"Inheritance!" said I. "You mentioned the word before. I do not
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said he, "it is a long story and a melancholy. My father drove me
  from the house, and bequeathed his fortune to an adopted daughter."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I quickly, "I know that too."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" and he stopped his toilette to stare at me. "Perhaps you are
  aware then that Helen Mayle, conscious of my father's injustice, bequeathed
  it again to me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but&mdash;but&mdash;you spoke of an immediate inheritance."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said he, coolly, "there is something, then, I can inform you of.
  Helen Mayle is dead."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" I cried, and started to my feet. I did not understand. I
  was like a man struck by a bullet, aware dimly that some hurt has come to
  him, but not yet conscious of the pain, not yet sensible of the wound.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Cullen Mayle, and untying a string at his waist he let his
  dress fall about his feet. "It is most sad. Not for the world would I have
  come into this inheritance at such a cost. You knew Helen Mayle, perhaps?" he
  asked, with a shrewd glance at me. "A girl very staunch, very true, who would
  never forget a <i>friend</i>." He emphasised that word "friend" and made it
  of a greater significance. "Indeed, I am not sure, but I must think it was
  because she could not forget a&mdash;friend that, alas! she died."</p>

  <p>I was standing stupefied. I heard the words he spoke, but gave them at
  this moment no meaning. I was trying to understand the one all-important
  fact.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" I babbled. "Helen Mayle&mdash; dead!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and in the strangest, pitiful way. I cannot think of it, without the
  tears come into my eyes. The news came to me but lately, and you will perhaps
  excuse me on that account." His voice broke as he spoke; there were tears,
  too, in his eyes. I wondered, in a dull way, whether after all he had really
  cared for her. "But how comes it that you knew her?" he asked.</p>

  <p>I sat down upon a chair and told him&mdash;of Dick Parmiter's coming to
  London, of my journey into the West. I told him how I had come to recognise
  him at the inn; and as I spoke the comprehension of Helen's death crept
  slowly into my mind, so that I came to a stop and could speak no more.</p>

  <p>"You were on your way to Tresco," said he, "when we first met. Then you
  know that she is dead?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "When did she die?"</p>

  <p>"On the sixth of October," said he.</p>

  <p>I do not think that I should have paid great heed to his words, but
  something in his voice&mdash;an accent of alarm&mdash;roused me. I lifted my
  eyes and saw that he was watching me with a singular intentness.</p>

  <p>"The sixth of October," I repeated vaguely, and then I broke into a laugh,
  so harsh and hysterical that it seemed quite another voice than mine. "Your
  news is false," I cried; "she is not dead! Why, I did not leave Tresco till
  the end of October, and she was alive then and no sign of any malady. The
  sixth of October! No, indeed, she did not die upon that day."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Sure?" said I. "I have the best of reasons to be sure; for it was on the
  sixth of October that I first set foot in Tresco," and at once Cullen Mayle
  sprang up and shook me by the hand.</p>

  <p>"Here is the bravest news," he said. His whole face was alight; he could
  not leave hold of my hand. "Mr. Berkeley, I may thank God that I spoke to you
  to-night. 'Helen!'"&mdash;and he lingered upon the name. "Upon my word, it
  would take little more to unman me. So you landed on the sixth of October.
  But are you sure of the date?" he asked with earnestness. "I borrowed your
  horse but a few days before. You would hardly have travelled so quickly."</p>

  <p>"I travelled by sea with a fair wind," said I. "It was the sixth of
  October. Could I forget it? Why, that very night I crossed Castle Down to
  Merchant's Point; that very night I entered the house. Dick Parmiter showed
  me a way. I crept into the house, and slept in your
  bedroom&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I had spoken so far without a notion of the disclosure to which my words
  were leading me. I was not looking at Cullen Mayle, but on to the ground,
  else very likely I might have read it upon his face. But now in an instant
  the truth of the matter was clear to me. For as I said, "I slept in your
  bedroom," he uttered one loud cry, leapt to his feet, and stood over against
  me, very still and quiet. I had sufficient wit not to raise my head and
  betray this new piece of knowledge. That sad and pitiful death on the sixth
  of October, of which he had heard with so deep a pain&mdash;he had never
  heard it, he had <i>planned</i> it, and the plan miscarried. He knew why,
  now, and so was standing in front of me very still and quiet. He had seen
  Helen that night on Castle Down; there, no doubt, she had told him how in her
  will she had disposed of her inheritance; and he had persuaded her, working
  on her generosity&mdash;with what prepared speeches of despair!&mdash;to that
  strange, dark act which it had been my good fortune to interrupt. It was
  clear to me. The very choice of that room, wherein alone secrecy was
  possible, made it clear. He had suggested to her the whole cunning plan; and
  a moment ago I had almost been deceived to believe his expressions of
  distress sincere!</p>

  <p>"I told you I was nearly unmanned," I heard him say; "and you see even so
  I underrated the strength of my relief, so that the mere surprise of your
  ingenious shift to get a lodging took my breath away."</p>

  <p>He resumed his seat, and I, having now composed my face, raised it full to
  him. I have often wondered since whether, as he stood above me, motionless
  and silent during those few moments, I was in any danger.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, "it was no doubt surprising."</p>

  <p>This, however, was not the only surprise I was to cause Cullen Mayle that
  night.</p>

  <p>He proposed immediately that we should cross to Tresco together, and on my
  objecting that we should get no one to carry us over&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh," said he, "I have convenient friends in Scilly as well as
  inconvenient." He looked out of the window. "The tide is high, and washes the
  steps at the back of the inn. Do you wait here upon the steps. I will have a
  boat there in less than half an hour;" and on the word he hooked up his dress
  again and got him out of the inn.</p>

  <p>I waited upon the steps as he bade me. Behind me were the lights and the
  uproar of the street; in front, the black water and the cool night; and still
  further, out of sight, the island of Tresco, the purple island of bracken and
  gorse, resonant with the sea.</p>

  <p>In a little I heard a ripple of water, and the boat swam to the steps. I
  was careful as we sailed across the road to say nothing to Cullen Mayle which
  would provoke his suspicion. I did not even allow him to see I was aware that
  he himself had been upon Tresco on the sixth of October. It was not difficult
  for me to keep silence. For as the water splashed and seethed under the lee
  of the boat, and Tresco drew nearer, I had to consider what I should do in
  the light of my new knowledge. It would have been so much easier had only
  Helen been frank with me.</p>

  <p>Tresco dimly loomed up out of the darkness.</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Cullen Mayle, who had been silent too, "you said that
  one of the watchers had remained. It will be George Glen, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "It is a Frenchman, Peter Tortue," and by the mere
  mention of the name I surprised Cullen Mayle again that evening. It is true
  that this time he uttered no exclamation, and did not start from his seat.
  But the boat shot up into the wind and got into irons, as the saying is, so
  that I knew his hand had left the tiller. But he said nothing until we were
  opposite to the Blockhouse, and then he asked in a low trembling voice:</p>

  <p>"Did you say Peter Tortue?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>There was another interval of silence. Then he put another question and in
  the same tone of awe:</p>

  <p>"A young fellow, less than my years&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. The young fellow's father," said I. "A man of sixty years. I think I
  should be wary of him."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"He said, 'I am looking, not for the cross, but for a man to nail upon the
  cross,' and he meant his words, every syllable."</p>

  <p>Again we fell to silence, and so crossed the Old Grimsby Harbour and
  rounded its northern point. The lights of the house were in view at last.
  They shot out across the darkness in thin lines of light and wavered upon the
  black water lengthening and shortening with the slight heave of the waves.
  When they shortened, I wondered whether they beckoned me to the house; when
  they lengthened out, were they fingers which pointed to us to be gone?</p>

  <p>"Since you know so much, Mr. Berkeley," whispered Cullen Mayle, "perhaps
  you can tell me whether Glen secured the cross."</p>

  <p>"No, he failed in that."</p>

  <p>"I felt sure he would," said Cullen with a chuckle, and he ran the boat
  aground, not on the sand before the house but on the bank beneath the garden
  hedge. We climbed through the hedge; two windows blazed upon the night, and
  in the room sat Helen Mayle close by the fire, her violin on a table at her
  side and the bow swinging in her hand. I stepped forward and rapped at the
  window. She walked across the room and set her face to the pane, shutting out
  the light from her eyes with her hands. She saw us standing side by side.
  Instantly she drew down the blinds and came to the door, and over the grass
  towards us. She came first to me with her hand outstretched.</p>

  <p>"It is you," she said gently, and the sound of her voice was wonderful in
  my ears. I had taken her hand before I was well aware what I did.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I.</p>

  <p>"You have come back. I never thought you would. But you have come."</p>

  <p>"I have brought back Cullen Mayle," said I, as indifferently as I could,
  and so dropped her hand. She turned to Cullen then.</p>

  <p>"Quick," she said. "You must come in."</p>

  <p>We went inside the door.</p>

  <p>"It is some years since I trod these flags," said Cullen. "Well, I am glad
  to come home, though it is only as an outcast; and indeed, Helen, I have not
  the right even to call it home."</p>

  <p>It was as cruel a remark as he could well have made, seeing at what pains
  the girl had been, and still was, to restore that home to him. That it hurt
  her I knew very well, for I heard her, in the darkness of the passage, draw
  in her breath through her clenched teeth. Cullen walked along the passage and
  through the hall.</p>

  <p>"Lock the door," Helen said to me, and I did lock it. "Now drop the
  bar."</p>

  <p>When that was done we walked together into the hall, where she
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"Look at me," she said, "please!" and I obeyed her.</p>

  <p>"You have come back," she repeated. "You do not, then, any longer believe
  that I deceived you?"</p>

  <p>"There is a reason why I have come back," I answered. It was a reason
  which I could not give to her. I was resolved not to suffer her to lie at the
  mercy of Cullen Mayle. Fortunately, she did not think to ask me to be
  particular about the reason. But she beat her hands once or twice together,
  and&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You still believe it, then!" she cried. "With these two months to search
  and catch and hold the truth, you still hold me in the same contempt as when
  you turned your back on me and walked out through that door?"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" I exclaimed. "Contempt! That never entered into any thought I
  ever had of you. Make sure of that!"</p>

  <p>"Yet you believe I tricked you. How can you believe that, and yet spare me
  your contempt!"</p>

  <p>"I am no philosopher. It is the truth I tell you," I answered, simply; and
  the face of Cullen Mayle appeared at the doorway of the parlour, so that no
  more was said.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"><small>CHAPTER XVIII</small></a><br>
  <br>
  MY PERPLEXITIES ARE EXPLAINED</h2>

  <p class="first">There is no need for me to tell at any length the
  conversation that passed between the three of us that night. Cullen Mayle
  spoke frankly of his journey to the Sierra Leone River.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Berkeley," he said, "already knows so much, that I doubt it would not
  be of any avail to practise mysteries with him. And besides there is no need,
  for, if I mistake not, Mr. Berkeley can keep a secret as well as any
  man."</p>

  <p>He spoke very politely, but with a keen eye on me to notice whether I
  should show any confusion or change colour. But I made as though I attached
  no significance to his words beyond mere urbanity. He told us how he made his
  passage to the Guinea Coast as a sailor before the mast, and then fell in
  with George Glen. It seemed prudent to counterfeit a friendly opinion that
  the cross would be enough for all. But when they discovered the cross was
  gone from its hiding place, he took the first occasion to give them the
  slip.</p>

  <p>"For I had no doubt that my father had been beforehand," said he. "Had I
  possessed more wisdom, I might have known as much when I heard him from my
  bed refuse his assistance to George Glen, and so saved myself an arduous and
  a perilous adventure. For my father, was he never so rich, was not the man to
  turn his back on the King of Portugal's cross."</p>

  <p>Of his father, Cullen spoke with good nature and a certain hint of
  contempt; and he told us much which he had learned from George Glen. "He went
  by the name of Kennedy," said Cullen, "but they called him 'Crackers' for the
  most part. He was not on the <i>Royal Fortune</i> at the time when Roberts
  was killed, so that he was never taken prisoner with the rest, nor did he
  creep out of Cape Corse Castle like George Glen."</p>

  <p>"Then he was never tried or condemned," said Helen, who plainly found some
  relief in that thought.</p>

  <p>"No!" answered Cullen, with a chuckle. "But why? He played rob-
  thief&mdash;a good game, but it requires a skilled player. I would never have
  believed Adam had the skill. Roberts put him in command of a sloop called the
  <i>Ranger</i>, which he had taken in the harbour of Bahia, and when he put
  out to sea on that course which brought him into conjunction with the
  <i>Swallow</i>, he left the <i>Ranger</i> behind in Whydah Bay. And what does
  Adam do but haul up his anchor as soon as Roberts was out of sight, and,
  being well content with his earnings, make sail for Maryland, where the
  company was disbanded. I would I had known that on the day we quarrelled.
  Body o' me, but I would have made the old man quiver. Well, Adam came home to
  England, settled at Bristol, where he married, and would no doubt have
  remained there till his death, had he not fallen in with one of his old
  comrades on the quay. That frightened him, so he come across to Tresco,
  thinking to be safe. And safe he was for twenty years, until George Glen
  nosed him out."</p>

  <p>Thereupon, Cullen, from relating his adventures, turned to questions
  asking for word of this man and that whom he had known before he went away.
  These questions of course he put to Helen, and not once did he let slip a
  single allusion to the meeting he had had with her in the shed on Castle
  Down. For that silence on his part I was well prepared; the man was versed in
  secrecy. But Helen showed a readiness no whit inferior; she never hesitated,
  never caught a word back. They spoke together as though the last occasion
  when they had met was the night, now four years and a half ago, when Adam
  Mayle stood at the head of the stairs and drove his son from the house. One
  thing in particular I learned from her, the negro had died a month ago.</p>

  <p>It was my turn when the gossip of the islands had been exhausted, and I
  had to tell over again of my capture by Glen and the manner of my escape. I
  omitted, however, all mention of an earlier visitant to the Abbey burial
  grounds, and it was to this omission that I owed a confirmation of my
  conviction that Cullen Mayle was the visitant. For when I came to relate how
  George Glen and his band sailed away towards France without the cross, he
  said:</p>

  <p>"If I could find that cross, I might perhaps think I had some right to it.
  It is yours, Helen, to be sure, by law, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him, as she was sure to do, with a statement that the
  cross and everything else was for him to dispose of as he thought fit. But he
  was magnanimous to a degree.</p>

  <p>"The cross, Helen, nothing but the cross, if I can find it. I have a
  thought which may help me to it. 'Three chains east of the east window in
  south aisle of St. Helen's Church.' Those were the words, I think."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I.</p>

  <p>"And Glen measured the distance correctly?"</p>

  <p>"To an inch."</p>

  <p>"Well, what if&mdash;it is a mere guess, but a likely one, I presume to
  think,&mdash;what if the chains were Cornish chains? There would be a
  difference of a good many feet, a difference of which George Glen would be
  unaware. You see I trust you, Mr. Berkeley. I fancy that I can find that
  cross upon St. Helen's Island."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt you will," said I.</p>

  <p>Cullen rose from his chair.</p>

  <p>"It grows late, Helen," said he, "and I have kept you from your sleep with
  my gossiping." He turned to me. "But, Mr. Berkeley, you perhaps will join me
  in a pipe and a glass of rum? My father had a good store of rum, which in
  those days I despised, but I have learnt the taste for it."</p>

  <p>His proposal suited very well with my determination to keep a watch that
  night over Helen's safety, and I readily agreed.</p>

  <p>"You will sleep in your old room, Cullen," she said, "and you, Mr.
  Berkeley, in the room next to it;" and that arrangement suited me very well.
  Helen wished us both good-night, and left us together.</p>

  <p>We went up into Mayle's cabin and Cullen mixed the rum, which I only
  sipped. So it was not the rum. I cannot, in fact, remember at all feeling any
  drowsiness or desire to sleep. I think if I had felt that desire coming over
  me I should have shaken it off; it would have warned me to keep wide awake.
  But I was not sensible of it at all; and I remember very vividly the last
  thing of which I was conscious. That was Cullen Mayle's great silver watch
  which he held by a ribbon and twirled this way and that as he chatted to me.
  He spun it with great quickness, so that it flashed in the light of the
  candle like a mirror, and at once held and tired the eyes. I was conscious of
  this, I say, and of nothing more until gradually I understood that some one
  was shaking me by the shoulders and rousing me from sleep. I opened my eyes
  and saw that it was Helen Mayle who had disturbed me.</p>

  <p>It took me a little time to collect my wits. I should have fallen asleep
  again had she not hindered me; but at last I was sufficiently roused to
  realise that I was still in the cabin, but that Cullen Mayle had gone. A
  throb of anger at my weakness in so letting him steal a march quickened me
  and left me wide awake. Helen Mayle was however in the room, plainly then she
  had suffered no harm by my negligence. She was at this moment listening with
  her ear close to the door, so that I could not see her face.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" I asked, and she flung up her hand with an imperative
  gesture to be silent.</p>

  <p>After listening for a minute or so longer she turned towards me, and the
  aspect of her face filled me with terror.</p>

  <p>"In God's name what has happened, Helen?" I whispered. For never have I
  seen such a face, so horror-stricken&mdash;no, and I pray that I never may
  again, though the face be a stranger's and not one of which I carried an
  impression in my heart.</p>

  <p>Yet she spoke with a natural voice.</p>

  <p>"You took so long to wake!" said she.</p>

  <p>"What o'clock is it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Three. Three of the morning; but speak low, or rather listen! Listen, and
  while you listen look at me, so that I may know." She seated herself on a
  chair close to mine, and leant forward, speaking in a whisper. "On the night
  of the sixth of October I went to the shed on Castle Down and had word with
  Cullen Mayle. Returning I passed you, brushed against you. So much you have
  maintained before. But listen, listen! That night you climbed into Cullen's
  bedroom and fell asleep, and you woke up in the dark middle of the
  night."</p>

  <p>"Stop! stop!" I whispered, and seized her hands in mine. Horror was upon
  me now, and a hand of ice crushing down my heart. I did not reason or argue
  at that moment. I knew&mdash;her face told me&mdash;she had been after all
  ignorant of what she had done that night. "Stop; not a word more&mdash;there
  is no truth in it."</p>

  <p>"Then there is truth in it," she answered, "for you know what I have not
  yet told you. It is true, then&mdash;your waking up&mdash;the silk noose! My
  God! my God!" and all the while she spoke in a hushed whisper, which made her
  words ten times more horrible, and sat motionless as stone. There was not
  even a tremor in the hands I held; they lay like ice in mine.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" I said. "But I would have spared you this! You did not
  know, and I doubted you. Of course&mdash;of course you did not know. Good
  God! Why could not this secret have lain hid in me? I would have spared you
  the knowledge of it. I would have carried it down safe with me into my
  grave."</p>

  <p>Her face hardened as I spoke. She looked down and saw that I held her
  hands; she plucked them free.</p>

  <p>"You would have kept the secret safe," she said, steadily. "You liar! You
  told it this night to Cullen Mayle."</p>

  <p>Her words struck me like a blow in the face. I leaned back in my chair.
  She kept her eyes upon my face.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;told it&mdash;to Cullen Mayle?" I repeated.</p>

  <p>She nodded her head.</p>

  <p>"To-night?"</p>

  <p>"Here in this room. My door was open. I overheard."</p>

  <p>"I did not know I told him," I exclaimed; and she laughed horribly and
  leaned back in the chair.</p>

  <p>All at once I understood, and the comprehension wrapped me in horror. The
  horror passed from me to her, though as yet she did not understand. She
  looked as though the world yawned wide beneath her feet. "Oh!" she moaned,
  and, "Hush!" said I, and I leaned forward towards her. "I did not know, just
  as you did not know that you went to the shed on Castle Down, that you
  brushed against me as you returned,&mdash;just as you did not know of what
  happened thereafter."</p>

  <p>She put her hands to her head and shivered.</p>

  <p>"Just as you did not know that four years ago when Cullen Mayle was turned
  from the door, he bade you follow him, and you obeyed," I continued. "This is
  Cullen Mayle's work&mdash;devil's work. He spun his watch to dazzle you four
  years ago; he did the same to-night, and made me tell him why his plan
  miscarried. Plan!" and at last I understood. I rose to my feet; she did the
  same. "Yes, plan! You told him you had bequeathed everything to him. He knew
  that tonight when I met him at St. Mary's. How did he know it unless you told
  him on Castle Down? He bade you go home, enter his room, where no one would
  hear you, and&mdash;don't you see? Helen! Helen!"</p>

  <p>I took her in my arms, and she put her hands upon my shoulders and clung
  to them.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of such things in London," said I. "Some men have this power
  to send you to sleep and make you speak or forget at their pleasure; and some
  have more power than this, for they can make you do when you have waked up
  what they have bidden you to do while you slept, and afterwards forget the
  act;" and suddenly Helen started away from me, and raised her finger.</p>

  <p>We both stood and listened.</p>

  <p>"I can hear nothing," I whispered.</p>

  <p>She looked over her shoulder to the door. I motioned her not to move. I
  walked noiselessly to the door, and noiselessly turned the handle. I opened
  the door for the space of an inch; all was quiet in the house.</p>

  <p>"Yet I heard a voice," she said, and the next moment I heard it too.</p>

  <p>The candles were alight. I crossed the room and squashed them with the
  palm of my hand. I was not a moment too soon, for even as I did so I heard
  the click of a door handle, and then a creak of the hinges, and a little
  afterwards&mdash;footsteps.</p>

  <p>A hand crept into mine; we waited in the darkness, holding our breath. The
  footsteps came down the passage to the door behind which we stood and passed
  on. I expected that they would be going towards the room in which Helen
  slept. I waited for them to cease that I might follow and catch Cullen Mayle,
  damned by some bright proof in his hand of a murderous intention. But they
  did not cease; they kept on and on. Surely he must have reached the room. At
  last the footsteps ceased. I opened the door cautiously and heard beneath me
  in the hall a key turn in a lock.</p>

  <p>A great hope sprang up in me. Suppose that since his plan had failed, and
  since Tortue waited for him on Tresco, he had given up! Suppose that he was
  leaving secretly, and for good and all! If that supposition could be true! I
  prayed that it might be true, and as if in answer to my prayer I saw below me
  where the hall door should be a thin slip of twilight. This slip broadened
  and broadened. The murmur of the waves became a roar. The door was
  opening&mdash;no, now it was shutting again; the twilight narrowed to a slip
  and disappeared altogether.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said I, and we heard footsteps on the stone tiles of the
  porch.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he is gone!" said Helen, in an indescribable accent of relief.</p>

  <p>"Yes, gone," said I. "See, the door of his room is open."</p>

  <p>I ran down the passage and entered the room. Helen followed close behind
  me.</p>

  <p>"He is gone," I repeated. The words sounded too pleasant to be true. I
  approached the bed and flung aside the curtains. I stooped forward over the
  bed.</p>

  <p>"Helen," I cried, and aloud, "out of the room! Quick! Quick!"</p>

  <p>For the words <i>were</i> too pleasant to be true. I flung up my arm to
  keep her back. But I was too late. She had already seen. She had approached
  the bed, and in the dim twilight she had seen. She uttered a piercing scream,
  and fell against me in a dead swoon.</p>

  <p>For the man who had descended the stairs and unlocked the door was not
  Cullen Mayle.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"><small>CHAPTER XIX</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE LAST</h2>

  <p class="first">Mesmer at this date was a youth of twenty-four, but the
  writings of Van Helmont and Wirdig and G. Maxwell had already thrown more
  than a glimmering of light upon the reciprocal action of bodies upon each
  other, and had already demonstrated the existence of a universal magnetic
  force by which the human will was rendered capable of influencing the minds
  of others. It was not, however, till seventeen years later&mdash;in the year
  1775, to be precise&mdash;that Mesmer published his famous letter to the
  Academies of Europe. And by a strange chance it was in the same year that I
  secured a further confirmation of his doctrines and at the same time an
  explanation of the one matter concerned with this history of which I was
  still in ignorance. In a word, I learned at last how young Peter Tortue came
  by his death.</p>

  <p>I did not learn it from his father. That implacable man I never saw after
  the night when we listened to his footsteps descending the stairs in the
  darkness. He was gone the next morning from the islands, nor was any trace of
  him, for all the hue and cry, discovered for a long while&mdash;not, indeed,
  for ten years, when my son, who was then a lad of eight, while playing one
  day among the rocks of Peninnis Head on St. Mary's, dropped clean out of my
  sight, or rather out of Helen's sight, for I was deep in a book, and did not
  raise my head until a cry from my wife startled me.</p>

  <p>We ran to the loose pile of boulders where the boy had vanished, and
  searched and called for a few minutes without any answer. But in the end a
  voice answered us, and from beneath our feet. It was the boy's voice sure
  enough, but it sounded hollow, as though it came from the bowels of the
  earth. By following the sound we discovered at last between the great
  boulders an interstice, which would just allow a man to slip below ground.
  This slit went down perpendicularly for perhaps fifteen or twenty feet, but
  there were sure footholds and one could disappear in a second. At the bottom
  of this hole was a little cave, very close and dark, in which one could sit
  or crouch.</p>

  <p>On the floor of this cave I picked up a knife, and, bringing it to the
  light, I recognised the carved blade, which I had seen Tortue once polish
  upon his thigh in the red light of a candle. The cave, upon inquiry, was
  discovered to be well known amongst the smugglers, though it was kept a
  secret by them, and they called it by the curious name of
  Issachum&mdash;Pucchar.</p>

  <p>This discovery was made in the year of 1768, and seven years later I
  chanced to be standing upon the quay at Leghorn when a vessel from Oporto,
  laden with wine and oil, dropped anchor in the harbour, and her master came
  ashore. I recognised him at once, although the years had changed him. It was
  Nathaniel Roper. I followed him up into the town, where he did his business
  with the shipping agent and thence repaired to a tavern. I entered the
  tavern, and sitting down over against him at the same table, begged him to
  oblige me by drinking a glass at my expense, which he declared himself ready
  to do. "But I cannot tell why you should want to drink with me rather than
  another," said he.</p>

  <p>"Oh! as to that," said I, "we are old acquaintances."</p>

  <p>He answered, with an oath or two, that he could not lay his tongue to the
  occasion of our meeting.</p>

  <p>"You swear very fluently and well," said I. "But you swore yet more
  fluently, I have no doubt, that morning you sailed away from St. Helen's
  Island without the Portuguese King's cross."</p>

  <p>His face turned the colour of paper, he half rose from his chair and sat
  down again.</p>

  <p>"I was never on Tresco," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"Who spoke of Tresco, my friend?" said I, with a laugh. "I made mention of
  St. Helen's. Yet you were upon Tresco. Have you forgotten? The shed on Castle
  Down? The Abbey burial ground?" and then he knew me, though for awhile he
  protested that he did not.</p>

  <p>But I persuaded him in the end that I meant no harm to him.</p>

  <p>"You were at Sierra Leone with Cullen, maybe," said I. "Tell me how young
  Peter Tortue came by his death?" and he told me the story which he had before
  told to old Peter in an alehouse at Wapping.</p>

  <p>Peter, it appeared, had not been able to hold his tongue at Sierra Leone.
  It became known through his chattering that Glen's company and Cullen Mayle
  were going up the river in search of treasure, and it was decided for the
  common good to silence him lest he should grow more particular, and relate
  what the treasure was and how it came to be buried on the bank of that river.
  George Glen was for settling the matter with the stab of a knife, but Cullen
  Mayle would have none of such rough measures.</p>

  <p>"I know a better and more delicate way," said he, "a way very amusing too.
  You shall all laugh to-morrow;" and calling Peter Tortue to him, he betook
  himself with the whole party to the house of an old buccaneering fellow, John
  Leadstone, who kept the best house in the settlement, and lived a jovial life
  in safety, being on very good terms with any pirate who put in. He had,
  indeed, two or three brass guns before his door, which he was wont to salute
  the appearance of a black flag with. To his house then the whole gang
  repaired, and while they were making merry, Cullen Mayle addressed himself
  with an arduous friendliness to Peter Tortue, taking his watch from his fob
  and bidding the Frenchman admire it. For a quarter of an hour he busied
  himself in this way, and then of a sudden in a stern commanding voice he
  said:</p>

  <p>"Stand up in the centre of the room," which Peter Tortue obediently
  did.</p>

  <p>"Now," continued Cullen, with a chuckle to his companions, "I'll show you
  a trick that will tickle you. Peter," and he turned toward him. "Peter," and
  he spoke in the softest, friendliest voice, "you talk too much. I'll clap a
  gag on your mouth, you stinking offal! To-morrow night, my friend, at ten
  o'clock by my watch, when we are lying in our boat upon the river, you will
  fall asleep. Do you hear that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Peter Tortue, gazing at Mayle.</p>

  <p>"At half-past ten, as you sleep, you will feel cramped for room, and you
  will dangle a leg over the side of the boat in the river. Do you hear
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Cullen. "That will learn you to hold your tongue. Now
  come back to your chair."</p>

  <p>Peter obeyed him again.</p>

  <p>"When you wake up," added Cullen, "you will continue to talk of my watch
  which you so much admire. You will not be aware that any time has passed
  since you spoke of it before. You can wake up now."</p>

  <p>He made some sort of motion with his hands and Peter, whose eyes had all
  this time been open, said:</p>

  <p>"I'll buy a watch as like that as a pea to a pea. First thing I will, as
  soon as I handle my share."</p>

  <p>Cullen Mayle laughed, but he was the only one of that company that did.
  The rest rather shrank from him as from something devilish, at which,
  however, he only laughed the louder, being as it seemed flattered by their
  fear.</p>

  <p>The next day the six men started up the river in a long-boat which they
  borrowed of Leadstone, and sailed all that day until evening when the tide
  began to fall.</p>

  <p>Thereupon Cullen, who held the tiller, steered the boat out of the channel
  of the river and over the mudbanks, which at high tide were covered to the
  depth of some feet.</p>

  <p>Here all was forest: the great tree-trunks, entwined with all manner of
  creeping plants, stood up from the smooth oily water, and the roof of
  branches over head made it already night.</p>

  <p>"I have lost my way," said Cullen. "It will not be safe to try to regain
  the channel until the tide rises. It falls very quickly here, Leadstone tells
  me, and we should get stuck upon some mudbank. Let us look for a pool where
  we may lie until the tide rises in the morning."</p>

  <p>Accordingly they took their oars and pulled in and out amongst the trees,
  while Cullen Mayle sounded with the boathook for a greater depth of water.
  The tide fell rapidly; bushes of undergrowth scraped the boat's side, and
  then Mayle's boathook went down and touched no bottom.</p>

  <p>"This will do," said he.</p>

  <p>It was nine o'clock by his watch at this time, and the crew without any
  fire or light made their supper in the boat as best they could. Meanwhile the
  tide still sank; banks of mud rose out of the black water; the forest
  stirred, and was filled with a horrible rustling sound, of fish flapping and
  crabs crawling and scuttering in the slime; and on the pool on which the boat
  lay every now and then a ripple would cross the water as though a faint wind
  blew, and a broad black snout would show, and a queer lugubrious cough echo
  out amongst the tree-trunks.</p>

  <p>"Crocodiles, Peter," said Cullen gaily, and he clapped Tortue on the
  shoulder. "It would not be prudent to take a bath in the pool. Hand the
  lantern over, Glen!" and when he had the lantern in his hand he looked at his
  watch.</p>

  <p>"Five minutes to ten," said he. "Well, it is not so long to wait."</p>

  <p>"Four hours," grumbled Tortue, who was thinking of the tide.</p>

  <p>"No, only five minutes, my friend," Cullen corrected him, softly; and sure
  enough in five minutes Peter stretched himself and complained that he was
  sleepy.</p>

  <p>Cullen laughed with a gentle enjoyment and whistled a tune between his
  teeth. But the others waited in a sort of paralysis of horror and amazement.
  Even these hardened men were struck with a cold fear. The suggestions of the
  place, too, had their effect. Above them was a black roof of leaves, the
  close air was foul with the odour of things decaying and things decayed, and
  everywhere about them was perpetually heard the crawling and pattering of the
  obscene things which lived in the mud.</p>

  <p>Peter Tortue stirred in his sleep, and Cullen held up the face of his
  watch in the light of the lantern so that all in the boat might see. It was
  half-past ten. Peter lifted his leg over the side and let it fall with a
  splash in the water. It dangled there for about five minutes, and then the
  man uttered a loud scream and clutched at the thwart, but the next instant he
  was dragged over the boat's side.</p>

  <p>Roper told me this story, and the horror of it lived again upon his face
  as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Well," said I, "the father took his revenge. He stabbed Cullen Mayle to
  the heart as he lay in bed. There is one thing more I would like to know. Can
  you remember the paper with the directions of the spot where the cross was
  buried?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he; "am I likely to forget it?"</p>

  <p>"Could you write them out again, word for word and line for line, as they
  were written?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he.</p>

  <p>I called for a sheet of paper and a pen and ink, and set them before
  Roper, and he wrote the directions laboriously, and handed the paper back to
  me. There were only two lines with which I was concerned, and they ran in
  this order:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><i>"The S aisle of St. Helen's Church.<br>
  Three chains east by the compass of the east window."</i></p><br>

  <p>"Are you sure you have made no mistake?" I asked. "This is a facsimile of
  the paper which you took from the hollow of the stick. Look again!"</p>

  <p>I gave it back to him and he scratched his head over it for a little. Then
  he wrote the directions again upon a second sheet of paper, and when he had
  written, tore off a corner of the paper.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said I, "that is what I thought." He handed it to me again, and it
  ran now:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"The S aisle of S. Helen's Church. Three<br>
  chains east by the compass of the east window."</p><br>

  <p>On that corner which had been torn a word had been written. I knew the
  word. It would be "Cornish." I knew, too, who had torn off the corner.</p>

  <p>The cross still lies then three Cornish chains east of that window, or
  should do so. We at all events have not disturbed it, for we do not wish to
  have continually before our eyes a reminder of those days when the sailors
  watched the house at Merchant's Point. Even as it is, I start up too often
  from my sleep in the dark night and peer forward almost dreading again to see
  the flutter of white at the foot of the bed, and to hear again the sound of
  some one choking.</p>
