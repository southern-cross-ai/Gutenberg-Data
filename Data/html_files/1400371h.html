  <p class="first">ATE," said Aunt Deborah to me as we sat with our feet on the
  fender one rainy afternoon&mdash;or, as we were in London, I should say one
  rainy morning&mdash;in June, "I think altogether, considering the weather and
  what not, it would be as well for you to give up this Ascot expedition, my
  dear."</p>

  <p>I own I felt more than half inclined to cry&mdash;most girls would have
  cried&mdash;but Aunt Deborah says I am very unlike the generality of women;
  and so, although I had ordered a peach-coloured mantle, and such a bonnet as
  can only be seen at Ascot on the Cup Day, I kept back my tears, and swallowed
  that horrid choking feeling in my throat, whilst I replied, with the most
  careless manner I could assume, "Goodness, aunt, it won't rain for ever: not
  that I care; but think what a disappointment for John!"</p>

  <p>I must here be allowed the privilege of my sex, to enter on a slightly
  discursive explanation as to who Aunt Deborah is and who I am, not forgetting
  Cousin John, who is good-nature itself, and without whom I cannot do the
  least bit. My earliest recollections of Aunt Deborah, then, date from a
  period when I was a curly-headed little thing in a white frock (not so very
  long ago, after all); and the first occasion on which I can recollect her
  personality with any distinctness was on a certain birthday, when poor
  grandfather said to me in his funny way, "Kate, you romp, we must get you a
  rocking-horse."</p>

  <p>Aunt Deborah lifted up her hands and eyes in holy horror and deprecation.
  "A rocking-horse, Mr. Coventry," said she; "what an injudicious selection!
  (Aunt Deborah likes to round her periods, as the book-people say.) The child
  is a sad tomboy already, and if you are going to teach her to ride,
  <i>I</i>won't answer for the consequences in after-life, when the habits of
  our youth have become the second nature of our maturity."</p>

  <p>Imagine such sentiments so expressed by a tall austere lady, with high
  manly features, piercing dark eyes, a <i>front</i> of jet-black hair coming
  low down on a somewhat furrowed brow. Cousin John says all dark women are
  inclined to be cross; and I own I think we <i>blondes</i> have the best of it
  as far as good temper is concerned. My aunt is not altered in the slightest
  degree from what she was then. She dresses invariably in gray silks of the
  most delicate shades and texture; carries spectacles low down upon her nose,
  where they can be of no earthly use except for inspection of the carpet; and
  wears lavender kid gloves at all hours of the day and night&mdash;for Aunt
  Deborah is vain of her hand, and preserves its whiteness as a mark of her
  birth and parentage. Most families have a crotchet of some sort on which they
  plume themselves; some will boast that their scions rejoice one and all in
  long noses; others esteem the attenuated frames which they bequeath to their
  descendants as the most precious of legacies; one would not part with his
  family squint for the finest pair of eyes that ever adorned an Andalusian
  maiden; another cherishes his hereditary gout as a priceless patent of
  nobility; and even insanity is prized in proportion to the tenacity with
  which it clings to a particular race. So the Horsinghams never cease talking
  of the Horsingham hand; and if I want to get anything out of Aunt Deborah, I
  have only to lend her a pair of my gloves, and apologize to her for their
  being so <i>large</i> that she can get both her hands into one.</p>

  <p>Now the only thing we ever fall out about is what my aunt calls
  <i>propriety</i>. I had a French governess once who left because I pinned the
  tail of Cousin John's kite to her skirt, and put white mice in her work-box;
  and she was always lecturing me about what she called "<i>les
  convenances</i>." Aunt Deborah don't speak much French, though she says she
  understands it perfectly, and she never lets me alone about propriety. When I
  came home from church that rainy Sunday with Colonel Bingham, under his
  umbrella (a cotton one), Aunt Deborah lectured me on the impropriety of such
  a thing&mdash;though the Colonel is forty if he is a day, and told me
  repeatedly he was a "safe old gentleman." I didn't think him at all
  dangerous, I'm sure. I rode a race against Bob Dashwood the other morning,
  once round the inner ring, down Rotten Row, to finish in front of Apsley
  House, and beat him all to ribbons. Wasn't it fun? And didn't I kick the dirt
  in his face? He looked like a wall that's been fresh plastered when he pulled
  up. I don't know who told Aunt Deborah. It wasn't the coachman, for he said
  he wouldn't; but she heard of it somehow, and of course she said it was
  <i>improper</i> and unladylike, and even <i>unfeminine</i>&mdash;as if
  anything a woman does can be unfeminine. I know Bob didn't think so, though
  he got the worst of it every way.</p>

  <p>To be sure, we women are sadly kept down in this world, whatever we shall
  be in the next. If they would only let us try, I think we could beat the
  "lords of the creation," as they call themselves, at everything they
  undertake. Dear me, they talk about our weakness and vanity&mdash;why, they
  never know their own minds for two minutes together; and as for vanity, only
  tell a man you think him good-looking, and he falls in love with you
  directly; or if that is too great <i>a bounce</i>&mdash;and indeed very few
  of them have the slightest pretensions to beauty&mdash;you need only hint
  that he rides gallantly, or waltzes nicely, or wears neat boots, and it will
  do quite as well. I recollect perfectly that Cousin Emily made her great
  marriage&mdash;five thousand a year and the chance of a baronetcy&mdash;by
  telling her partner in a quadrille, quite innocently, that "she should know
  his figure anywhere." The man had a hump, and one leg shorter than the other;
  but he thought Emily was dying for him, and proposed within a fortnight.
  Emily is an artless creature&mdash;"good, common-sense," Aunt Deborah calls
  it&mdash;and so she threw over Harry Bloomfield and married the hump and the
  legs that didn't match and the chance of the baronetcy forthwith; and now
  they say he beats her, and I think it serves her right.</p>

  <p>But we women&mdash;gracious! if we only take the trouble we can turn the
  whole male sex round our little fingers. Who ever saw half a dozen of us
  hovering and watching and fussing round a masculine biped, thankful even to
  be <i>snubbed</i> rather than not noticed at all. Who ever saw us fetch and
  carry like so many retrievers, and "sit up," so to speak, for a withered
  rose-bud at the fag end of an over-blown bouquet. Not that we don't love
  flowers in their proper places, and <i>keep</i> them too, sometimes long
  after their colour has faded and their perfume gone; but we don't make a
  parade of such things, and have the grace to be ashamed of ourselves when we
  are so foolish.</p>

  <p>But it's quite different with men. They give in to us about everything if
  we only insist&mdash;and it's our own fault if we don't insist; for, of
  course, if they find us complying and ready to oblige, why, there's no end to
  their audacity. "Give 'em an inch, and they take an ell." However, they do
  try to keep us down as much as they can. Now there's that very exercise of
  riding that they are so proud of. They get us a side-saddle, as they call it,
  of enormous weight and inconvenience, on which they plant pommels enough to
  impale three women; they place us in an attitude from which it is next to
  impossible to control a horse should he be violent, and in a dress which
  ensures a horrible accident should he fall; added to which, they constantly
  give us the worst quadruped in the stable; and yet, with all these drawbacks,
  such is our own innate talent and capacity, we ride many an impetuous steed
  in safety and comfort that a man would find a dangerous and incontrollable
  "mount." For my part, I only wish I had been born a man&mdash;that's to say,
  if I could keep my own ideas and feelings. To be sure, I should lose a good
  many personal adornments; not that I'm vain enough to consider myself a
  beauty, but still one cannot help being anxious about one's own appearance,
  particularly if one has a full-length glass in one's bedroom. I need not be
  ashamed to own that I know I've got bright eyes, and good teeth, and a fresh
  colour, and loads of soft brown hair, and not a bad figure&mdash;so my
  dressmaker tells me; though I think myself I look best in a riding-habit.
  Altogether you can't call <i>that</i> a perfect fright; but, nevertheless, I
  think if I might I would change places with Cousin John. <i>He</i> has no
  Aunt Deborah to be continually preaching <i>propriety</i> to <i>him</i>. He
  can go out when he likes without being questioned, and come in without being
  scolded. He can swagger about wherever he chooses without that most odious of
  encumbrances called a chaperon; and though I shouldn't care to smoke as many
  cigars as he does (much as I like the smell of them in the open air), yet I
  confess it must be delightfully independent to have a latchkey.</p>

  <p>I often wonder whether other people think Cousin John good-looking. I have
  known him so long that I believe I can hardly be a fair judge. He is
  fresh-coloured, to be sure, and square and rather fat, and when he smiles and
  shows all his white teeth, he has a very pleasant appearance; but I think I
  admire a man who looks rather more of a <i>rou&eacute;</i>&mdash;not like
Colonel
  Bingham exactly, whose face is all wrinkles and whiskers, but a little
  care-worn and jaded, as if he was accustomed to difficulties, and had other
  things to occupy his thoughts besides his horses and his dinner. I don't like
  a man that stares at you; and I don't like a man that can't look you in the
  face. He provokes me if he is all smiles, and I've no patience with him if
  he's cross. I'm not sure I know exactly what does please me best, but I
  <i>do</i>know that I like Cousin John's constant good-humour, and the pains
  he takes to give me a day's amusement whenever he can, or what he calls "have
  Cousin Kate out for a lark." And this brings me back to Aunt Deborah and the
  expedition to Ascot, a thing of all others I fancied was so perfectly
  delightful.</p>

  <p>"My dear," said Aunt Deborah as she folded her lavender-gloved hands, "if
  it wasn't for the weather and my rheumatism, I'd accompany you myself; but I
  do consider that Ascot is hardly a place for <i>my</i> niece to be seen at
  without a chaperon, and with no other protector than John Jones&mdash;John
  Jones," repeated the old lady reflectively&mdash;"an excellent young man,
  doubtless (I heard him his Catechism when he was <i>so</i> high), but still
  hardly equal to so responsible a charge as that of Miss Coventry."</p>

  <p>I knew this was what John calls a "back-hander" at me, but I can be
  <i>so</i> good-tempered when I've anything to gain; therefore I only
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Well, aunt, of course you're the best judge, and I don't care the least
  about going; only when John calls this afternoon, you must explain it all to
  him, for he's ordered the carriage and the luncheon and everything, and he'll
  be so disappointed."</p>

  <p>I've long ago found out that if you want to do anything you should never
  seem too anxious about it.</p>

  <p>Aunt Deborah is fonder of John than she likes to confess. I know why,
  because I overheard my old nurse tell the housekeeper when I was quite a
  little thing; and what I hear, especially if I'm not intended to hear it, I
  never forget. There were three Miss Horsinghams, all with white
  hands&mdash;poor mamma, Aunt Deborah, and Aunt Dorcas. Now Aunt Deborah
  wanted to marry old David Jones (John's papa). I can just remember
  him&mdash;a snuffy little man with a brown wig, but perhaps he wasn't always
  so; and David Jones, who was frightened at Aunt Deborah's black eyes, thought
  he would rather marry Aunt Dorcas. Why the two sisters didn't toss up for him
  I can't think; but he <i>did</i> marry Aunt Dorcas, and Aunt Deborah has been
  an old maid ever since. Sometimes even now she fixes her eyes on Cousin John,
  and then takes them off with a great sigh. It seems ridiculous in an old
  lady, but I don't know that it is so. That's the reason my cousin can do what
  he likes with Aunt Deborah; and that's the reason why, when he called on that
  rainy afternoon, he persuaded her to let me go down to Ascot with him all
  alone by our two selves the following day.</p>

  <p>How pleasant it is to wake on the morning of a gala day, to hear the carts
  and cabs rumbling and clattering in the streets, and to know that you must
  get up early, and be off directly after breakfast, and will have the whole
  livelong day to amuse yourself in. What a bright sunshiny morning it was, and
  what fun I had going with John in a hansom cab to Paddington&mdash;I like a
  hansom cab, it goes so fast&mdash;and then down to Windsor by the train in a
  carriage full of such smart people, some of whom I knew quite well by name,
  though not to speak to. The slang aristocracy, as they are called, muster in
  great force at Ascot. Nor could anything be more delightful than the drive
  through Windsor Forest up to the Course&mdash;such a neat phaeton and pair,
  and John and I like a regular Darby and Joan sitting side by side. Somehow
  that drive through Windsor Forest made me think of a great many things I
  never think of at other times. Though I was going to the races, and fully
  prepared for a day of gaiety and amusement, a half-melancholy feeling stole
  over me as we rolled along amongst those stately old trees, and that lovely
  scenery, and those picturesque little places set down in that abode of
  beauty. I thought how charming it would be to saunter about here in the early
  summer mornings or the still summer nights, and listen to the thrush and the
  blackbird and the nightingale in the copse; and then I thought I would not
  care to wander here <i>quite</i> alone, and that a whisper might steal on my
  ear, sweeter than the note of the thrush and the nightingale; and that there
  might be a somebody without whom all that sylvan beauty would be a blank, but
  with whom any place would become a fairyland. And then I fell to wondering
  who that somebody would be; and I looked at Cousin John, and felt a little
  cross&mdash;which was very ungrateful; and a little disappointed&mdash;which
  was very unjust.</p>

  <p>"Here we are, Kate: that's the Grand Stand, and we'll have the carriage
  right opposite; and the Queen's not come, and we're in heaps of time; and
  there's Frank Lovell," exclaimed the unconscious John as we drove on to the
  Course, and my daydreams were effectually dispelled by the gay scene which
  spread itself before my eyes.</p>

  <p>As I took John's arm and walked into the enclosure in front of the stand,
  I must confess that the first impression on my mind was this&mdash;"Never in
  my life have I seen so many well-dressed people collected together before;"
  and when the Queen drove up the Course with her brilliant suite of carriages
  and outriders, and the mob of gentlemen and ladies cheered her to the echo, I
  was such a goose that I felt as if I could have cried. After a time I got a
  little more composed, and looked about at the different toilettes that
  surrounded me. I own I saw nothing much neater than my own; and I was pleased
  to find it so, as nothing gives one greater confidence in a crowd than the
  consciousness of being well dressed. But what I delighted in more than all
  the bonnets and gowns in the universe were those dear horses, with their
  little darlings of jockeys. If there is one thing I like better than another,
  it is a thoroughbred horse. What a gentleman he looks amongst the rest of his
  kind! How he walks down the Course, as if he knew his own
  value&mdash;self-confident, but not vain&mdash;and goes swinging along in his
  breathing-gallop as easily and as smoothly as if I was riding him myself, and
  he was proud of his burthen! When Colonist won the Cup, I felt again as if I
  could have cried. It was a near race, and closely contested the whole way
  from the distance in. I felt my blood creeping quite chill, and I could
  perfectly understand then the infatuation men cherish about racing, and why
  they ruin their wives and children at that pursuit. What a relief it was when
  the number was up, and I could be quite satisfied that the dear bay horse had
  won. As for the little jockey that rode him, I could and <i>would</i> have
  kissed him! Just then Cousin John came back to me, with his sunny, laughing
  face, and I naturally asked him, "Had he won his money?" John never bets; but
  he replied, "I'm just as pleased as if I'd won a fortune; only think, Frank
  Lovell has landed twelve hundred!" "Well," I replied, "I am glad of
  it&mdash;which is very good of me, seeing that I don't know Mr. Lovell."
  "Don't know Frank Lovell!" exclaimed John. "The greatest friend I have in the
  world." (Men's friends always are the greatest in the world.) "I'll introduce
  him to you; there he is&mdash;no he isn't. I saw him a moment ago." And
  forthwith John launched into a long biography of his friend Frank
  Lovell&mdash;how that gentleman was the nicest fellow and the finest rider
  and the best shot in the universe; how he knew more about racing than any man
  of his age, and had been in more difficulties, and got out of them better,
  and robbed the public generally with a more plausible air; how he sang a
  capital song, and was the pleasantest company, and had more brains than the
  world gave him credit for (as indeed might easily be the case); how he was
  very good-looking, and very agreeable, and met with great success (whatever
  that means) in society; how Lady Scapegrace was avowedly in love with him;
  and he had thrown over pretty Miss Pinnifer because he wouldn't leave the
  army, and six months afterwards was obliged to sell his commission, when
  Outsider won the "Two Thousand;" together with various other details, which
  lasted till it was time to have luncheon, and go back to Windsor to catch the
  four o'clock train. Though evidently such a hero of John's, I confess I
  didn't like what I heard of Frank Lovell at all.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <p class="first">We've got such a sweet little house in Lowndes
  Street&mdash;to my mind the very best situation in London. When I say
  <i>we</i>, of course I mean Aunt Deborah and myself. We live together, as I
  hope we always shall do, as Aunt Deborah says, till "one of us is married."
  And notwithstanding the difference of our ages we get on as comfortably as
  any two forlorn maidens can. Though a perfect fairy palace within, our
  stronghold is guarded by no giant, griffin, dragon, or dwarf; nothing more
  frightful than a policeman, whose measured tread may be heard at the midnight
  hour pacing up and down beneath our windows. "It's a great comfort," says
  Aunt Deborah, "to know that assistance is close at hand. I am a lone woman,
  Kate, and I confess to feeling nervous when I lie awake." I quite agree with
  my aunt, though I'm not nervous, but I must say I like the idea of being
  watched over during the hours of sleep; and there is something romantic in
  hearing the regular tramp of the sentinel whilst one is curled up snug in
  bed. I don't much think it always is the policeman&mdash;at least I know that
  one night when I got up to peep if it was a constable, he was wrapped in a
  very loose cloak, such as is by no means the uniform of the force, and was
  besides, unquestionably, smoking a cigar, which I am given to understand is
  not permitted by the regulations when on duty. I watched the glowing light
  for at least ten minutes, and when I went to bed again, I could not get to
  sleep for wondering who the amateur policeman could be.</p>

  <p>But the house is a perfect jewel of its kind. <i>Such</i> a pretty dining-
  room, <i>such</i> a lovely drawing-room, opening into a conservatory, with a
  fountain and gold-fish, to say nothing of flowers (I am passionately fond of
  flowers), and <i>such</i> a boudoir of my own, where nobody ever intrudes
  except my special favourites&mdash;Cousin John, for instance, when he is not
  in disgrace&mdash;and which I have fitted up and furnished quite to my own
  taste. There's the "Amazon" in gilt bronze, and a bas-relief from the Elgin
  marbles&mdash;not coloured like those flaxen-haired abominations at Sydenham,
  but pure and simple as the taste that created it; and an etching Landseer did
  for me himself of my little Scotch terrier growling; and a veritable original
  sketch of Horace Vernet&mdash;in which nothing is distinguishable save a
  phantom charger rearing straight up amongst clouds of smoke. Then I've put up
  a stand for my riding-whips, and a picture of my own thoroughbred favourite
  horse over the chimney-piece; altogether, Aunt Deborah describes the
  apartment exactly when she says to me, as she does about once a week, "My
  dear, if you were a <i>man</i>, I should say your room was fitted up in the
  most perfect taste; but as you happen to be a young lady, I won't say what I
  think, because I know you won't agree with me;" and I certainly do not agree
  with Aunt Deborah upon a great many subjects.</p>

  <p>However, there's no situation like Lowndes Street. I'm not going to tell
  the number, nor at which end of the street we live; for it's very
  disagreeable to have people riding by and stopping to alter their
  stirrup-leathers, and squinting up at one's drawing-room windows where one
  sits working in peace, and then cantering off and trotting by again, as if
  something had been forgotten. No; if curiosity is so very anxious to know
  where I live, let it look in the <i>Court Guide</i>; for my part, I say
  nothing, except that there are always flowers in the balcony, and there's no
  great singularity about that. But there are two great advantages connected
  with a "residence in Belgravia," which I wonder are not inserted in the
  advertisements of all houses to let in that locality. In the first place, a
  lady may walk about all the forenoon quite alone, without being hampered by a
  maid or hunted by a footman; and in the second, she is most conveniently
  situated for a morning ride or walk in the Park; and those are about the two
  pleasantest things one does in London.</p>

  <p>Well, the same conversation takes place nearly every morning at breakfast
  between Aunt Deborah and myself (we breakfast early, never after half-past
  nine, however late we may have been the night before). Aunt Deborah
  begins,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My dear, I hope we shall have a quiet morning together; I've directed the
  servants to deny me to all visitors; and if you'll get your work, I will
  proceed with my readings from excellent Mrs. Hannah More."</p>

  <p>Kate.&mdash;"Thank you, aunt; Hannah More amuses me very much"&mdash;(I
  confess that prim moralist does make me laugh).</p>

  <p><i>Aunt Deborah</i> (reprovingly).&mdash;"Instructive, Kate, not amusing;
  certainly not ludicrous. If you'll shut the door we'll begin."</p>

  <p><i>Kate</i>.&mdash;"Can't we put it off for an hour? I must get my ride,
  you know, aunt. What's the use of horses if one don't ride?"</p>

  <p><i>Aunt Deborah</i>.&mdash;"Kate, you ride too much; I don't object to the
  afternoons with John Jones, but these morning scampers are really quite
  uncalled for; they're spoiling your figure and complexion; it's
  improper&mdash;more, it's unfeminine; but as you seem determined upon it, go
  and get your ride, and come back a little sobered;" and Kate&mdash;that's
  me&mdash;disappears into the boudoir, from which she emerges in about five
  minutes with the neatest habit and the nicest hat, and her hair done in two
  such killing plaits&mdash;John Jones says I never look so well as when I've
  got my hair dressed for riding.</p>

  <p>I always go out for these morning excursions quite alone. Aunt Deborah
  fought for a long time, and insisted on my taking the coachman; but he is an
  old family servant, and I soon knocked him up completely. In the first place,
  the ride is always soft, and I hate going <i>slow</i>, so he used to get a
  dreadful stitch in his side trying to keep up with me on one of the
  high-actioned coach-horses; then he didn't see the fun of having two horses
  to clean when he got home instead of one; so when he found he couldn't get
  another helper, we begged him off between us, and I go out now unencumbered
  by that excellent and pursy old man. After all, I ought to be able to take
  care of myself. I have ridden ever since I was five years old; and if habit
  is second nature, as Aunt Deborah says, I'm sure my habit ought to be natural
  enough to me. I recollect as well as if it was yesterday, when poor papa put
  me on a shaggy Shetland pony, and telling me not to be frightened, gave it a
  thump, and started me off by myself. I wasn't the least bit afraid, I know
  that. It was a new sensation, and delightful; round and round the field we
  went, I shaking my reins with one hand, and holding on a great flapping straw
  hat with the other; the pony grunting and squeaking, with his mane and tail
  floating on the breeze, and papa standing in the middle, waving his hat and
  applauding with all his might. After that I was qualified to ride anything;
  and by the time I was twelve, there wasn't a hunter in the stables that I
  wouldn't get on at a moment's notice. I am ashamed to confess that I have
  even caught the loose cart-horses in a field, and ridden them without saddle
  or bridle. I never was beat but once, and that was at Uncle Horsingham's when
  I was about fifteen. He had bought a mare at Tattersall's for his daughter to
  ride, and brought her down to Dangerfield, thinking she would conduct herself
  like the rest of her species. How well I remember my governess's face when
  she gave me leave to go to the stable with Sir Harry and look over the new
  purchase. I was a great pet of Uncle Horsingham; and as Cousin Amelia was not
  much of an equestrian, he proposed that I should get upon the chestnut mare
  first, and try her paces and temper before his daughter mounted her. As we
  neared the stables out came one of the grooms with a sidesaddle on his head,
  and the longest face I ever beheld.</p>

  <p>"O Sir 'Arry," said he&mdash;I quote his exact words&mdash;"that new
  mare's a wicious warmint; afore I was well into the stable, she ups and lets
  out at me just above the knee: I do believe as my thigh's broke."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, man," said my uncle; "put the saddle on and bring her out."
  Presently the chestnut mare appeared; and I saw at once that she was not in
  the best of humours. But I was young, full of spirits, and fresh from
  lessons; so, fearing if one of the men should venture to mount her she might
  show temper, and I should lose my ride, I made a sign to the head-groom to
  give me a hand; and before my uncle had time to exclaim, "For goodness sake,
  Kate!" I was seated, muslin dress and all, on the back of the chestnut mare.
  What she did I never could quite make out; it seemed to me that she crouched
  as if she was going to lie down, and then bounded into the air, with all four
  legs off the ground. I was as near gone as possible; but for the only time in
  my life I caught hold of the pommel with my right hand, and that saved me. In
  another instant she had broke from the groom's hold, and was careering along
  the approach like a mad thing. If I had pulled at her the least she would
  have run away with me.</p>

    <p class="caption">I was as near gone as possible.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Luckily, the park was roomy, and the old trees far apart; so when we got
  upon the grass I knew who would be mistress. I gave her a rousing good
  gallop, shook my reins and patted her, to show her how confident I was, and
  brought her back to my uncle as quiet as a lamb. Unfortunately, however, the
  mare had taken a dislike to certain stone pillars which supported the stable
  gates, and nothing would induce her to pass them. Flushed with success, I
  borrowed my uncle's riding-whip to punish her; and now began a battle in good
  earnest. She reared and plunged, and wheeled round and round, and did all she
  knew to get rid of me; whilst I flogged and jerked, and screamed at her (I
  didn't swear, because I didn't know how), and vowed in my wicked little heart
  I would be killed rather than give in. During the tussle we got nearer and
  nearer to a certain large pond about a hundred yards from the stable gates,
  at which the cattle used to water in the quiet summer afternoons. I knew it
  wasn't very deep, for I had seen them standing in it often. By the time we
  were close on the brink the whole household had turned out to see "Miss Kate
  killed;" and just as I hit the mare a finishing cut over the ears, I caught a
  glimpse of my governess in an attitude of combined shame, horror, and disgust
  that I shall never forget. The next moment we were overhead in the pond, the
  mare having dashed blindly in, caught her fore-feet in the bridle, and rolled
  completely over. What a ducking I got to be sure! But it was nothing to the
  scolding I had to endure afterwards from all the females of the family,
  including my governess; only Uncle Horsingham stuck up for me, and from that
  time till the day of his death vowed he had "never known but one plucky
  fellow in the world, and that was his little niece Kate."</p>

  <p>No wonder I feel at home on Brilliant, who never did wrong in his life,
  who will eat out of my hand, put his foot in my apron-pocket, follow me about
  like a dog, and is, I am firmly persuaded, the very best horse in England. He
  is quite thoroughbred, though he has never been in training&mdash;and is as
  beautiful as he is good. Bright bay, with such black legs, and such a silky
  mane and tail! I know lots of ladies whose hair is coarser than Brilliant's.
  Fifteen hands three inches, and Cousin John says well up to his
  weight&mdash;an honest fourteen stone. With the smallest nose, and the
  leanest head, and the fullest dark eye, and the widest, reddest
  nostril&mdash;his expression of countenance, when a little blown, is the most
  beautiful I ever beheld; and not a white mark about him except a tiny star in
  the very middle of his forehead; I know it well, for I have kissed it often
  and often. The picture over my chimney-piece does not half do him justice;
  but then, to be sure, its <i>pendant</i>, painted by the same artist, and
  representing my other horse, White Stockings, flatters that very plain and
  excellent animal most unblushingly.</p>

  <p>Of all delights in the world give me my morning canter up the park on
  Brilliant. Away we go, understanding each other perfectly; and I am quite
  sure that he enjoys as much as I do the bright sunshine and the morning
  breeze and the gleaming Serpentine, with its solitary swan, and its hungry
  ducks, and its amphibious dogs continually swimming for the inciting stick,
  only rescued to produce fresh exertions; and the rosy children taking their
  morning walk; and, above all, the <i>liberty</i> of London before two o'clock
  in the day, when the real London begins. I pat Brilliant's smooth, hard neck,
  and he shakes his head, and strikes an imaginary butterfly with one black
  fore-leg, and I draw my rein a thought tighter, and away we go, much to the
  admiration of that good-looking man with moustachios who is leaning on his
  umbrella close to the rails, and smoking the cigar of meditation as if the
  park was his own.</p>

  <p>I often wondered who that man was. Morning after morning have I seen him
  at the same place, always with an umbrella, and always with a cigar. I quite
  missed him on the Derby day, when of course he was gone to Epsom (by-the-bye,
  why don't we go to the Derby just as much as to Ascot?); and yet it was
  rather a relief, too, for I had got almost shy about passing him. It seemed
  so absurd to see the man every day and never to speak; besides, I fancied,
  though of course it could only be fancy, that he looked as if he was
  expecting me. At last I couldn't help blushing, and I thought he saw it; for
  I'm sure he smiled, and then I was so provoked with myself that I sent
  Brilliant up the ride at a pace nothing short of a racehorse could have
  caught.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

  <p class="first">I wonder whether any lady in England has a maid who, to use
  that domestic's own expression, is capable of "giving satisfaction." If any
  lady does rejoice in such an Abigail, I shall be too happy to "swap" with
  her, and give anything else I possess except Brilliant into the bargain. Mine
  is the greatest goose that ever stood upon two legs, and how she can chatter
  as she does with her mouth full of pins is to me a perfect miracle. Once or
  twice in the week I have to endure a certain ordeal which, although a
  positive pleasure to some women, is to my disposition intense martyrdom,
  termed dressing to go out; and I think I never hated it more than the night
  of Lady Horsingham's ball. Lady Horsingham is my poor uncle's widow; and as
  Aunt Deborah is extremely punctilious on all matters relating to family
  connections, we invariably attend these solemnities with a gravity befitting
  the occasion.</p>

  <p>Now, I may be singular in my ideas; but I confess that it does appear to
  me a strange way of enjoying oneself in the dog-days, to make one's toilette
  at eleven p.m., for the purpose of sitting in a carriage till twelve, and
  struggling on a staircase amongst a mob of one's fellow-creatures till
  half-past. After fighting one's way literally step by step, and gaining a
  landing by assault, one looks round and takes breath, and what does one see?
  Panting girls looking in vain for the right partner, who is probably not ten
  yards from them, but wedged in between substantial dowagers, whom he is
  cursing in his heart, but from whom there is no escape; or perhaps
  philosophically and perfidiously making the best of his unavoidable
  situation, and flirting shamefully with the one he likes <i>next</i> best to
  the imprisoned maiden on the staircase; or, the tables turned, young
  fledglings pining madly for their respective enslavers, and picturing to
  themselves how she may be even now whirling round to that pealing waltz in
  the arms of some former adorer or delightfully new acquaintance, little
  heeding him who is languishing in his white neckcloth, actually within
  speaking distance, but separated as effectually as if he were in another
  country. By-the-bye, it's fatal when people begin to think of each other as
  hes and shes; the softest proper name that ever was whispered is not half so
  dangerous as those demonstrative pronouns. In one corner is a stout old
  gentleman, wedged against the wall, wiping the drops from his bald head, and
  wondering what Jane and Julia can see in these gatherings to make them wild
  about going to every ball for which they can get an invitation. Deluded
  father! both Jane and Julia have the best of reasons in this very house. You
  grudge not to spend a broiling September day in the pursuit of <i>your</i>
  game; each of your fair daughters, sir, flatters herself that she, too, has
  winged her bird.</p>

  <p>Swaying backwards and forwards in the mass, like some goodly merchantman
  at anchor, pitching and rolling to a ground-swell, behold the chaperon
  fulfilling her destiny, and skilfully playing that game which to her is the
  business of life. Flushed and hot in person, she is cool and composed in
  mind. Practice makes perfect; and the chaperon is as much at home here as the
  stockbroker on 'Change, or the betting-man in the ring, or the fisherman
  amidst the roar and turmoil of the waves. With lynx eyes she notes how Lady
  Carmine's eldest girl is "carrying on" with young Thriftless, and how Lord
  Looby's eyeglass is fixed on her own youngest daughter; yet for all this she
  is not absent or preoccupied, but can whisper to stupid Lady Dulwich the very
  latest intelligence of a marriage, or listen, all attention, to the freshest
  bit of scandal from Mrs. General Gabbler. But perhaps by this time you have
  floated with the tide into the doorway, and received from your hostess the
  cordial shake of the hand or formal bow which makes you free of the place.
  So, with patience and perseverance you work your way at last into the
  dancing-room, and you now see what people come here for&mdash;dancing, of
  course. Each performer has about eighteen inches of standing room, and on
  that space must be enacted in hopeless pantomime the intricate evolutions of
  the quadrille, or the rotatory struggles of the waltz. Sliding and smiling,
  and edging and crushing, the conscientious dancers try to fulfil their
  duties, and much confusion and begging of pardons are the natural
  results.</p>

  <p>However, it's a rare place for love-making. What with the music and the
  crowd and the confusion, the difficulty is more to make out what one's
  partner <i>does</i> say than to prevent his being overheard by other people;
  but, I must confess, if anybody had anything very particular to say to
  <i>me</i>, I had rather hear it in the quiet country by moonlight, or even
  coming home from Greenwich by water&mdash;or anywhere, in short, rather than
  in the turmoil of a London ball. But that's all nonsense; and I hope I have
  too much pride to allow any man to address me in such a strain. Trust me for
  setting him down!</p>

  <p>It's no wonder, then, that I was cross when I was dressing for Lady
  Horsingham's ball; and that silly Gertrude (that's my maid's name, and what a
  name it is for a person in that class of life!) put me more and more out of
  patience with her idiotic conversation, which she tries to adapt to my
  tastes, and of which the following is a specimen:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Master John will be at her ladyship's ball, miss, I make no doubt;"
  brushing away the while at my back hair, and pulling it unnecessarily hard;
  no maid ever yet had a "light hand."</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Brushing away the while at my back hair.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>No answer. What business is it of hers, and why should she call him
  <i>Master John?</i> Gertrude tries again: "You look pale to-night, miss; you
  that generally has such a colour. I'm afraid you're tired with your
  ride."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it&mdash;only sleepy. Why, it's time one was in bed."</p>

  <p>"Lor, miss, I shouldn't want to go to bed, not if I was going to a ball.
  But I think you like 'orse exercise best; and to be sure, your 'orse is a
  real beauty, Miss Kate."</p>

  <p>The very name of Brilliant always puts me in good humour, so, of course, I
  can but answer, "<i>That</i> he is, Gertrude, and as good as he's handsome;"
  on which my voluble handmaid goes off again at score.</p>

  <p>"That's what I say, miss, when I see him coming round to the door, with
  his long black tail and his elegant shape and his thin legs." <i>Thin
  legs!</i>&mdash;I can't stand that; to hear my beautiful Brilliant's great
  strong legs called <i>thin</i>, as if he were made of paper. I feel I am
  getting savage again, so I cut Gertrude short, and bid her "finish my hair,"
  and hasten my dressing, for Aunt Deborah don't take long, and we shall be
  late for the ball. At the mention of the word "ball," off goes Gertrude
  again.</p>

  <p>"What a grand ball it'll be, miss, as all her ladyship's is; and I know
  there'll be no young lady there as will be better dressed than my young lady,
  nor better looking neither; and I'm sure, to see you and Master John stand up
  together, as you did last Christmas when we was all at Dangerfield! and I
  says to the steward, 'Mr. Musty,' says I, 'a handsomer couple than them two I
  never clapped eyes on. Master John, he looks so fresh, and so healthy and
  portly, as becomes a gentleman.' And he says, 'No doubt,' says he; 'and Miss
  Kate, she steps away like a real good one, with her merry eyes and her trim
  waist, as blooming,' says he, 'as a beanfield, and as saucy as&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"There, that will do, Gertrude; now my pocket-handkerchief and some scent,
  and my gloves and my fan. Good-night, Gertrude."</p>

  <p>"Good-night, miss; I do humbly hope you'll enjoy your ball."</p>

  <p>Enjoy my ball, indeed! How little does the girl know what I enjoy, and
  what I don't enjoy! Lady Horsingham will be as stiff as the poker, and about
  as communicative. Cousin Amelia will look at everything I've got on, and say
  the most disagreeable things she can think of, because she never can forgive
  me for being born two years later than herself. I shall know very few people,
  and those I do know I shall not like. I shall have a headache before I have
  been half an hour in the room. If I dance I shall be hot, and if I don't
  dance I shall be bored. Enjoy my ball, indeed! I'd much rather be going
  hay-making.</p>

  <p>Up went the steps, bang went the door, and ere long we were safely
  consigned to the "string" of carriages bound for the same destination as
  ourselves. After much "cutting-in," and shaving of wheels, and lashing of
  coach-horses, with not a little blasphemy, "Miss Horsingham" and "Miss
  Coventry" were announced in a stentorian voice, and we were struggling in a
  mass of silks and satins, blonde and broadcloth, up the swarming staircase.
  Everything happened exactly as I had predicted; Lady Horsingham accosted Aunt
  Deborah with the most affectionate cordiality, and lent me two fingers of her
  left hand, to be returned without delay. Cousin Amelia looked me well over
  from head to foot, and asked after my own health and Brilliant's with a
  supercilious smile. How that girl hates me! And I honestly confess to
  returning the feeling with some cordiality. As far as appearance goes, I
  think without vanity I may say I have the best of it, Cousin Amelia being
  very short and pale, with a "turn-up" nose and long ringlets. Why does a
  little woman with a turn-up nose always wear her hair in ringlets? Is it that
  she wishes to resemble a King Charles's spaniel? And why are our sex so apt
  to cherish feelings of animosity towards those who are younger and
  better-looking than themselves? While I ask myself these questions I was
  suddenly accosted by a lady who had been some time in conversation with my
  chaperon, and from whom, I saw by Aunt Deborah's countenance, she was anxious
  to make her escape. Poor old soul! What could she do? A double rank of
  dowagers hemmed her in in front; on one side of her was her unwelcome
  acquaintance and the banisters&mdash;on the other, myself and three demure
  young ladies (sisters), who looked frightened and uncomfortable&mdash;whilst
  her rear was guarded by a tall cavalry officer with enormous moustachios,
  heading an impervious column of dandies worse than himself. Aunt Deborah was
  like a needle in a bottle of hay. Taking advantage of her position, the lady
  before mentioned seized me by both hands, and vowed she should have known me
  anywhere by my likeness to my poor mamma. "I must make your acquaintance, my
  dear Miss Coventry&mdash;your uncle, Sir Harry, was one of my oldest friends.
  I see you so often in the park, and you ride the nicest horse in London, a
  bay with a white star." Of course I bowed an affirmative, and shook my new
  friend by the hand with a cordiality equal to her own. A conversation begun
  in so promising a manner as by a reference to my favourite was sure to go on
  swimmingly; besides, we could not have got away from each other if we would;
  and ere long I found Mrs. Lumley&mdash;for that was the lady's name&mdash;a
  most amusing and satirical personage, with a variety of anecdotes about all
  her friends and acquaintances, and a sort of flippant charm of manner that
  was quite irresistible.</p>

  <p>Besides all this, she was doubtless a very pretty woman&mdash;less
  striking perhaps than winning. At the first glance you hardly remarked
  her&mdash;at the second you observed she was very well dressed&mdash;at the
  third it occurred to you all of a sudden that she was far better-looking than
  half the regular red-and-white beauties of the season; and after five
  minutes' conversation all the men were over head and ears in love with her.
  She was neither dark nor fair, neither pale nor ruddy, neither short nor
  tall. I never could succeed in making out the colour of her eyes, but she had
  wonderfully long thick eyelashes with a curl in them (I wish mine had been
  cut when I was a baby), and a beautiful healthy-looking skin, and such good
  teeth. After all, I think her great attraction was her nose. It had more
  expression in its straight, well-cut bridge and little, sharp point than all
  the rest of her features put together. I believe it was her nose that
  conquered everything, and that her small feet and pretty figure and white
  hands, and dashing ways and <i>piquante</i> conversation had much less to
  answer for than one saucy little feature. How she rattled on: "You don't know
  Lady Scapegrace, Miss Coventry, do you? There, that bold-looking woman in
  yellow. Beautiful black hair, hasn't she?&mdash;false, every bit of it!
  She'll bow to me to-night, because she sees me with your good aunt; there, I
  told you so! Since she and Sir Guy are living together again she sets up for
  being respectable&mdash;such stories, my dear! but I don't believe half of
  'em. However, I've seen her with my own eyes do <i>the oddest</i>
  things&mdash;at best, I'm afraid she's a shocking flirt! There's your cousin,
  Mr. Jones&mdash;you see I know everybody. How black he looks&mdash;he don't
  like me&mdash;a great many people don't&mdash;but I return good for
  evil&mdash;I like everybody&mdash;it's never worth while to be cross;" and as
  she said so she smiled with such a sunny, merry expression that I liked her
  better and better.</p>

  <p>Cousin John certainly did look very cross. "Who introduced you to that
  horrid woman, Kate?" said he as soon as a fresh convulsion in the crowd had
  stranded us a few steps higher up, and we were separated from Mrs. Lumley and
  her attractions.</p>

  <p>"My aunt, sir," I replied demurely, telling a "<i>white</i> one" for the
  sake of teasing him. "Why? Have you any objections?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course, if my aunt did, it's all right," replied he. "I don't know
  a great deal of her, and what I do know I don't much like. But, Kate, there's
  a friend of mine wishes to be presented to you. You've often heard me mention
  Frank Lovell&mdash;well, there he is; do you see him?&mdash;turning round now
  to speak to Lady Scapegrace."</p>

  <p>Good heavens! it was the man I had seen in the park so often, if possible
  better-looking with his hat off than I had thought him in his morning
  costume, with the eternal cigar in his mouth. I have a sort of dim
  recollection of his making his bow to my aunt, who received him, as she does
  all good-looking young men, with a patronizing smile, and a vision of John
  "doing the polite," and laughing as he ceremoniously introduced "Captain
  Lovell" and "Miss Coventry," and something said about "the honour of the next
  waltz;" and although I am not easily discomposed, I confess I felt a little
  shy and uncomfortable till I found myself hanging on Captain Lovell's arm,
  and elbowing our way to a place amongst the dancers.</p>

  <p>I must say he wasn't the least what I expected&mdash;not at all forward,
  and never alluded to our previous meeting, or to Brilliant, till we went to
  have an ice in the tea-room, when Captain Lovell began to enlarge upon the
  charm of those morning rides, and the fresh air, and the beautiful scenery of
  Hyde Park; and though I never told him exactly, he managed to find out that I
  rode every day at the same early hour, "<i>even</i> after a ball!" and that I
  was as likely to be there to-morrow as any day in the week; and so we had
  another turn at "the Colombetta" waltz, and he took me back to my aunt,
  half-inclined to be pleased with <i>him</i>, and more than half-inclined to
  be angry with <i>myself</i>. I am afraid I couldn't help watching him as he
  loitered about amongst the crowd, now deep in conversation with Lady
  Scapegrace, now laughing with my new friend, Mrs. Lumley. He looked so like a
  gentleman, even amongst all the high-bred men there; and though so handsome,
  he didn't appear the least conceited. I began to wonder whether all could be
  true that I had heard of him, and to think that a man who liked such early
  walks could not possibly be the <i>rou&eacute;</i> and "good-for-nothing"
they made
  him out. I was roused out of a brown study by Cousin John's voice in my ear,
  "Now then, Kate, for <i>our</i> waltz. The room's a little clearer, so we can
  go the 'pace' if you like." And away we went to "the Odalisque" faster than
  any other couple in the room. Somehow it wasn't half such a pretty air as the
  Colombetta, and John, though he has a very good ear, didn't seem to waltz
  quite so well as usual; perhaps I was getting a little tired. I know I wasn't
  at all sorry when my aunt ordered the carriage; and I thought the dawn never
  looked so beautiful as it did when we emerged from those hot, lighted rooms
  into the pure, fragrant summer air. I confess I do love the dawn, even in
  London. I like to see the "gates of morning" open with that clear,
  light-green tinge that art has never yet been able to imitate; and if I could
  do as I liked, which none of us can, I should always be up and dressed by
  sunrise.</p>

  <p>As we drove down Grosvenor Place I saw Captain Lovell walking home,
  smoking a cigar. I think he caught a glimpse of my face at the
  carriage-window, for I am almost sure he bowed, but I shrunk back into the
  corner, and pretended to go to sleep; and when we arrived in Lowndes Street I
  was not at all sorry to wish Aunt Deborah good-night, and go upstairs to
  bed.</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">OW then, Kate, late as usual; my phaeton's at the door, and
  we've only an hour and five minutes to do the twelve miles," said Cousin
  John's cheery voice as he accosted me on the following morning, running
  upstairs to change my dress after my early ride. Yes, notwithstanding the
  ball the night before, I was not going to disappoint Brilliant of his gallop;
  besides, these things are all habit; if you once get accustomed to early
  hours nothing is so easy as to keep to them. Why, even Captain Lovell was in
  the park as usual with his cigar&mdash;he seems regular enough about
  <i>that</i>, at all events&mdash;and he took his hat off so gracefully when
  he spied me cantering up the Ride that I hadn't the heart to pass without
  stopping just to say, "How d'ye do?" but of course I didn't shake hands with
  him.</p>

  <p>"Come, Kate, bustle, bustle," exclaimed that fidget John; and in less time
  than my lady-readers would believe, I had put on my pink bonnet and my white
  dress, and was bowling down to Richmond by the side of my cousin, behind a
  roan and a chestnut that stepped away in a style that it did one good to
  see.</p>

  <p>"What a clipper that off-horse is, John," said I as we cleared London, and
  got to the level road by Kew Gardens; "let me take the reins for five
  minutes&mdash;they're going so pleasantly." But John don't like me to drive
  anything more sporting than a pony-carriage, and he refused point blank,
  which, to say the least of it, was brutal on his part. If I hadn't thought it
  would make me sick, I should have liked to smoke, on purpose to provoke him.
  We did the distance with three minutes to spare, and as we pulled up in front
  of the Castle Hotel, I was proud to hear the admiration our <i>tout
  ensemble</i> elicited from a knot of idlers lounging round the door. "'Ere's
  a spicy set-out, Bill," said one. "Crickey! vot a pretty gal!" said another.
  "Vouldn't I like to be Vilikins with she for a Dinah!" exclaimed the dirtiest
  of the conclave; and although I appreciated the compliment, I was forced to
  turn my back on my unwashed admirer, and reply to the greetings of the picnic
  party we had come down to join.</p>

  <p>There was Mrs. Molasses and her two daughters to begin with, people of
  unheard-of wealth, of which they seemed to carry a large portion on their
  persons. The mamma, ample, black-eyed, fresh-coloured, and brocaded, with an
  extremely natural wig. The eldest daughter, Mary, with whom I had afterwards
  reason to be better acquainted, pale, languid, very quiet, and low-toned,
  with fine eyes, and soft dark hair, and what people call an
  <i>interesting</i> look. She took the sentimental line&mdash;was all feeling
  and poetry, and milk and water, and as easily frightened as she was reassured
  again. The younger girl, Jane, was the very reverse of her sister&mdash;short
  and dark and energetic, rather blue, and I thought a little impudent;
  however, I liked her the best of the two. Then came Sir Guy and Lady
  Scapegrace. The Baronet, a stout, square, elderly man, with enormous dyed
  whiskers and hair to match, combining as much as possible the manners of the
  coachman with the morals of the <i>rou&eacute;</i>. A tremendous dandy of the
  Four-in-hand Club school&mdash;high neckcloth, huge pins, gorgeous patterns,
  enormous buttons, and a flower in his mouth. His lady as handsome as a star,
  though a little hollow-eyed and <i>pass&eacute;e</i>. She looked like a
tragedy
  queen, with her magnificent figure, and long black hair, and fierce flashing
  eyes, and woe-begone expression, and the black velvet ribbon with its diamond
  cross, which she always wore round her neck. Ah me! what stories that
  diamond-cross could tell, if all be true that we hear of Lady Scapegrace! A
  girl sold for money, to become a rebellious wife to an unfeeling husband. A
  handsome young cousin, who cut his own throat in despair&mdash;they brought
  it in temporary insanity, of course. An elopement with a gallant Major to the
  south of France, and a duel there, in which the Major was shot, but not by
  Sir Guy; an English lady of rank travelling on the Continent, independent and
  alone, breaking banks in all directions with her luck and hearts with her
  beauty; a reconciliation, entirely for money considerations, which drove
  another far less erring woman into a madhouse (but that was Sir Guy's fault);
  and a darker tale still of a certain potion prepared by her hand, which the
  Baronet was prevented from swallowing only by his invariable habit of
  contradicting his wife on all points, and which the lady herself had the
  effrontery to boast "would have settled all accounts." Not a word of truth in
  any of these stories probably; but still, such is the character the world's
  good nature affixes to that dark handsome woman at whom Cousin John seems so
  very much alarmed.</p>

  <p>Then there was an elderly Miss Minnows, who was horribly afraid of
  catching cold, but in whose character I could perceive no other very salient
  point; and a fair-haired young gentleman, whose name I did not distinctly
  catch, and who looked as if he ought to have been at school, where, indeed, I
  think he would have been much happier; and sundry regular stereotyped London
  men and women, well bred and well dressed, and cool and composed, and
  altogether thoroughly respectable and stupid; and a famous author, who drank
  a great deal of wine, and never opened his lips to speak; and I think that
  was all&mdash;no, by-the-bye, there was Captain Lovell, who came very late,
  and we went soberly into Richmond Park, and dined under a tree.</p>

  <p>I do not think I quite like a picnic. It is all very well, like most other
  arrangements, if everything goes right; but I sat between Sir Guy Scapegrace
  and the light-haired young gentleman, and although I could hear lots of fun
  going on at the other end of the tablecloth, where Cousin John and Mary
  Molasses and Captain Lovell had got together, I was too far off to partake of
  it, and my <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, Lady Scapegrace, scowled at me so from
under
  her black eyebrows, though I believe utterly unconsciously, that she made me
  feel quite nervous. Then it was not reassuring to have that odious Sir Guy
  pressing me to eat everything, and looking right under my bonnet, and asking
  me to drink champagne at least four times; and if I turned to my other
  neighbour, and ventured to address him on the most commonplace subject, he
  blushed so painfully that I began to think he was quite as much afraid of me
  as I was of Sir Guy. Altogether I was rather glad when the things were
  cleared away and put back into the hampers, and the gentlemen asked leave to
  light their cigars, and we broke up our circle, and lounged about and enjoyed
  ourselves in the shade of those fine trees on that dry velvet sward. We were
  rather put to it though for amusement, and had to propose games of forfeits
  and other pastimes; and Cousin John, quite unwittingly, got me into a sad
  scrape by boasting about his horses. "Not such another pair out of London
  to-day," expatiated John to the company in general. "We came down in seven
  minutes under the hour from my aunt's door in Lowndes Street; didn't we,
  Kate? And never turned a hair; did we, Kate? Why, they went so smooth Kate
  couldn't keep her hands off the reins; could you, Kate? And there are few
  better judges, let me tell you, than Miss Coventry." I saw the ladies look at
  me, and then at each other; and I knew by that indescribable glance, which
  none but a woman can thoroughly appreciate, how from that moment they had
  vowed, one and all, to hate me eternally in their hearts. The offence had
  been committed; the sentence had gone forth. I had been tried for being
  <i>fast</i>, and found guilty <i>nem. com.</i>, from sneering Lady Scapegrace
  to unmeaning Miss Minnows; each stared at me for about two seconds, and so
  made up her mind. I cannot think why it is that this should be so great a
  crime in the eyes of my own sex. Next to being attractive to the other half
  of creation&mdash;and that I can easily understand is totally
  unpardonable&mdash;there is nothing makes a woman so angry with her sister as
  high spirits, natural courage, and above all a love for a horse. It is very
  hard upon us that we should be debarred from all out-of-door exercises and
  amusements by the prejudices of those very individuals who ought to back us
  up in our efforts to enlarge the circle of our amusements. I cannot see why
  it follows that because I do not mind "weather," I must, therefore, be
  utterly regardless of morality; nor how my knack of breaking in a horse
  should imply an infraction of all the commandments. Are men the only bipeds
  that can be at the same time brave and virtuous? Must pluck and piety be for
  ever divorced in the female character? Shall I never be able to keep the
  straight path in life because I can turn an awkward corner with four horses
  at a trot? Female voices answer volubly in the negative, and I give in.</p>

  <p>But odious Sir Guy thinks none the worse of me for my coaching
  predilections. "Fond of driving, Miss Coventry?" says he, leering at me from
  over his great choking neckcloth. "Seen <i>my</i> team&mdash;three greys and
  a piebald? If you like going <i>fast</i> I can accommodate you. Proud to take
  you back on my drag. What? Go on the box. <i>Drive</i>, if you like.
  Hey!"</p>

  <p>I confess for one instant, much as I hated the old reprobate, I should
  have liked to go, if it was only to make all the women so angry; but just
  then I caught Captain Lovell's eye fixed upon me with a strange, earnest
  expression, and all at once I felt that nothing should induce me to trust
  myself with Sir Guy. I couldn't help blushing though as I declined, more
  particularly when my would-be charioteer swore he considered it "an
  engagement, hey?&mdash;only put off to another time&mdash;get the coach new
  painted&mdash;begad, Miss Coventry's favourite colour!" And the old monster
  grinned in my face till I could have boxed his ears.</p>

  <p>The author by this time was fast asleep, with a handkerchief over his
  face, Miss Minnows searching in vain for a fabulous pair of clogs, as she
  imagined the dew must be falling&mdash;it was about six p.m., and hot June
  weather. Sir Guy was off to the hampers in search of "brandy and soda," and
  the rest of the party lounging about in twos and threes, when Captain Lovell
  proposed we should stroll down to the river and have a row in the cool of the
  evening. Mary Molasses voted it "charming;" Lady Scapegrace was willing to go
  anywhere away from Sir Guy; John, of course, all alive for a lark; and though
  Mrs. Molasses preferred remaining on dry land, she had no objection to
  trusting her girls with us. So we mustered a strong party for embarkation on
  Father Thames. Our two cavaliers ran forward to get the boat ready, Captain
  Lovell bounding over the fences and stiles almost as actively as Brilliant
  could have done; and John, who is no mean proficient at such exercises,
  following him; whilst we ladies paced along soberly in the rear.</p>

  <p>"Can you row, Miss Coventry?" asked Lady Scapegrace, who seemed to have
  taken rather a fancy to me, probably out of contradiction to the other women.
  "I can. I rowed four miles once on the Lake of Geneva," she added in her
  deep, melancholy voice, "and we were caught in one of those squalls and
  nearly lost. If it hadn't been for poor Alphonse, not one of us could have
  escaped. I wonder if drowning's a painful death, Miss Coventry; the water
  always looks so inviting."</p>

  <p>"Goodness, Lady Scapegrace!" exclaimed I; "don't take this opportunity of
  finding out. None of us can swim but John; and if he saves anybody, he's
  solemnly engaged to save <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you, Lady Scapegrace," said the romantic Miss
  Molasses. "It looks so peaceful, and gives one such an idea of repose. I for
  one have not the slightest fear of death, or indeed of any mere bodily
  changes&mdash;Gracious goodness! the bull! the bull!"</p>

  <p>What a rout it was! The courageous young lady who thus gave us the first
  intimation of danger leading the flight with a speed and activity of which I
  should have thought her languid frame totally incapable; Lady Scapegrace
  making use of her long legs with an utter forgetfulness of her usually grave
  and tragic demeanour; and the rest of the party seeking safety
  helter-skelter.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a situation of some peril. Our course to the riverside had
  led us through a long narrow strip of meadow-land, bounded by high impervious
  thorn fences, such as I knew would be <i>bullfinches</i> in the winter, and
  which now, in all the luxuriance of summer foliage, presented a mass of
  thorns and fragrance that no mortal could expect to get through. At either
  end of the field was a high hog-backed stile, such as ladies usually make
  considerable difficulties about surmounting, but which are by no means so
  impossible of transit when an infuriated bull is bringing up the rear. We
  were already a quarter of the way across the field, when Miss Mary's
  exclamation made us aware of our enemy, who had been quietly cropping the
  grass in a corner behind us, but who now, roused by our gaudy dresses and the
  piercing screams of some of our party, was lashing himself into a rage, and
  looking sufficiently mischievous to be a very unpleasant acquaintance. It was
  impossible to turn round and make for the stile we had just left, as the bull
  now occupied a position exactly between us and that place of safety; it was
  hopeless, particularly in our light muslin gowns, to attempt the hedge on
  either side; there was nothing for it but a fair run to the other end of the
  meadow, about a quarter of a mile, and <i>sauve qui peut</i> was now the
  order of the day.</p>

  <p>I will not allow that I am deficient in courage; on the contrary, as
  Cousin John says, "I am rather proud of my pluck;" but there is nothing so
  contagious as a panic, and I too ran for my very life. The bull came
  galloping after us, tossing his head and rolling his great body about as if
  he quite enjoyed the fun; nor do I know how the adventure would have ended,
  for he must have overtaken some of us before we could reach our haven, had
  not Lady Scapegrace caught her foot in the long grass, and, falling
  prostrate, buried her face in her hands, and giving herself up, as she
  afterwards assured me, to the prospect of a horrible and violent death. I
  could not leave her in such a situation. By an impulse for which I cannot
  account I stopped short, turned round, got between the pursuer and his fallen
  foe, and with a beating heart and my knees knocking together, faced the great
  mischievous brute with no other weapon, offensive or defensive, than a laced
  pocket handkerchief.</p>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">I got between the pursuer and his fallen foe.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>I believe he was a well-meaning bull after all; for instead of crashing in
  upon me, as I half expected he would, and immolating me on the spot, he too
  stopped short, stared, bellowed, and began sniffing the grass, and pawing up
  the turf, and whisking his tail about, just as Brilliant does when he is
  going to lie down. I don't think he had ever seen a young lady, certainly not
  a French bonnet before, and he didn't seem to know what to make of the
  combination; so there we stood, he and I staring each other out of
  countenance, but without proceeding to any further extremities. I know I have
  plenty of courage, for after the first minute I wasn't the least bit afraid;
  I felt just as I do when I ride at a large fence&mdash;as I get nearer and
  nearer I feel something rising and rising within me that enables me to face
  anything; and so when I had confronted the bull for a little time I felt
  inclined to carry the war into the enemy's country, and advance upon him. But
  of course all this is very indelicate and unfeminine; and it would have been
  far more virtuous and lady-like to have run shrieking away like Miss
  Molasses, or laid down and given in at once like poor Lady Scapegrace, who
  was quite resigned to being tossed and trampled upon, and only gave vent
  every now and then to a stifled moan.</p>

  <p>Well, at last I did advance a few steps, and the bull gave ground in the
  same proportion. I began to think I should beat him after all, when to my
  great relief, I must allow, I heard a voice behind me exclaim, "By Jove, what
  a plucky girl!" and I thought I heard something muttered that sounded very
  like "darling," but of course that couldn't be meant for me; and Captain
  Lovell, hot, handsome, and breathless, made his appearance, and soon drove
  our enemy into the farthest corner of the field. As soon as the coast was
  clear we raised poor Lady Scapegrace, who kissed me with tears in her eyes as
  she thanked me for what she called "saving her life." I had no idea the woman
  had so much feeling. Captain Lovell gave each of us an arm as we walked on to
  join our party, and he explained how the screams of Miss Molasses had reached
  him even at the riverside, and how he had turned and hastened back
  immediately, "Fortunately in time to be of some use. But I never saw a finer
  thing done, Miss Coventry; if I live to a hundred I shall never forget it;"
  and he looked as if he would have added, "or you either."</p>

  <p>Many were the exclamations, and much the conversation created by our
  adventure. The ladies who had run away so gallantly were of course too much
  agitated for the proposed boating excursion; so after sundry restoratives at
  the hotel we ordered the carriages to return to town. Cousin John gave
  "Frank" (as he calls him) a place in the back seat of his phaeton, and he
  leaned over and talked to me the whole way home. What a pleasant drive it was
  in the moonlight, and how happy I felt! I was really sorry when we got back
  to London. Frank seemed quite anxious to make Aunt Deborah's acquaintance;
  and I thought I shouldn't wonder if he was to call in Lowndes Street very
  soon.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

  <p class="first">When Aunt Deborah is laid up with one of <i>her</i> colds
  she always has a wonderful accession of "propriety" accompanying the
  disorder; and that which would appear to her at the worst a harmless
  <i>escapade</i>when in her usual health and spirits becomes a crime of the
  blackest dye when seen through the medium of barley-broth and
  water-gruel&mdash;these being Aunt Deborah's infallible remedies for a
  catarrh. Now, the cold in question had lasted its victim over the Ascot
  meeting, over our picnic to Richmond, and bade fair to give her employment
  during the greater part of the summer, so obstinate was the enemy when he had
  once possessed himself of the citadel; and under these circumstances I
  confess it appeared to me quite hopeless to ask her permission to accompany
  Cousin John on a long-promised expedition to Hampton Races. I did not dare
  make the request myself; and I own I had great misgivings, even when I
  overheard from my boudoir the all-powerful John preferring his petition,
  which he did with a sort of abrupt good humour peculiarly his own.</p>

  <p>"Going to take Kate out for another lark, aunt, if you have no objection,"
  says John, plumping down into an armchair, and forthwith proceeding to
  entangle Aunt Deborah's knitting into the most hopeless confusion. "Only some
  quiet races near town; all amongst ourselves, you know&mdash;gentlemen
  riders, and that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>Aunt Deborah, who is a good deal behindhand in all matters connected with
  the turf, and who has set her face into a determined refusal when she hears
  the word "racing," rather relaxes at the mention of "<i>gentlemen</i>riders,"
  and replies gravely, "John, I want to talk to you about Kate. The girl's wild
  after horses and hounds and all such unfeminine pursuits. I wonder you like
  to see it yourself, my dear. Now, don't you think it would be far better to
  encourage her in domestic tastes and amusements? I give you my word, she
  hasn't done a bit of worsted-work for a fortnight."</p>

  <p>John's face must have been good at this piece of intelligence; if there is
  one thing he hates more than another it is "cross-stitch." But he replied
  with exemplary gravity that "Cousin Kate never was strong, you know, aunt,
  and she is ordered to be a good deal in the open air, with plenty of horse
  exercise; and this is delightful weather for riding."</p>

  <p>"Well, John," says Aunt Deborah, "of course, if you don't mind it, I
  needn't; you'll be the sufferer, my dear, not I" (I wonder what she meant by
  that?); "and I must let her go if you choose to take her, John. How like your
  father you're growing, my handsome boy!" and Aunt Deborah kissed Cousin John
  on the forehead, with tears in her eyes; and they called to me to get ready,
  and the horses came round, and in less than ten minutes we were up and
  away.</p>

  <p>It was very gratifying to overhear the complimentary remarks made upon the
  general appearance of White Stockings, whom I had ridden down to save
  Brilliant, and who, despite his ugliness, is a very hunting-looking
  horse.</p>

  <p>"Looks a game 'un, don't he, squire?" remarked a jolly-looking Surrey
  farmer in top-boots to a dilapidated friend in a white neckcloth. "Shouldn't
  wonder if he couldn't kick the dirt in some of their faces, with that tight
  lass to keep his head straight." The friend was a melancholy man, and nodded
  his silent affirmative with a sigh. I think, early as it was, they had both
  been drinking.</p>

  <p>"Look at that chestnut horse!" exclaimed a good-looking boy of some twenty
  summers, who had coached his own drag down, like a second Phaethon, only as
  yet with better luck, and was now smoking a huge cigar on its roof. "Isn't he
  the image of old Paleface? Who's the woman, eh? Does nobody know her? I'll
  ask her to come and sit up here. She looks like a lady, too," he added,
  checking himself. "Never mind, here goes!" And he was jumping off the coach,
  to tender me, I presume, his polite invitation in person, when his arm was
  caught by the man next him, who was no other than John's friend, Captain
  Lovell.</p>

  <p>"Charley, stop!" exclaimed Frank, flushing all over his handsome face and
  temples. "I know her, I tell you. Have a care; it's Miss Coventry." And in
  another instant he had bounded to the earth, accosted my <i>chaperon</i> with
  a hearty "Jack, how goes it?" and was deep in conversation with my humble
  self, with his hand on my horse's neck&mdash;Frank always wears such good
  gloves&mdash;and his pleasant countenance beaming with delight at our chance
  interview. I liked the races better after this, and should have spent a
  happier day, perhaps, without the society of Mrs. Lumley, who appeared
  likewise on horseback, quite unexpectedly, and was riding the most beautiful
  brown mare I ever saw in my life. I quite wished I had brought down
  Brilliant, if only to have met her on more equal terms. As we were the only
  two ladies on horseback, of course we were obliged to fraternize (if the
  weaker sex may use such an expression), as, indeed, we must have done had we
  been the bitterest foes on earth, instead of merely hating each other with
  common civility. Mrs. Lumley seemed on particularly good terms with Frank
  Lovell&mdash;I do not know that I liked her any the better for that&mdash;and
  expressed her sentiments and opinions to the world in general with a vivacity
  and freedom peculiarly her own.</p>

  <p>"I am out on 'the sly,' you know," she observed with an arch smile. "I
  have a good, quiet aunt who lives down at Richmond, and I do penance there
  for a time, whenever I have been more than usually wicked; but to-day I could
  not resist the fine weather and the crowd and the fun, and above all the bad
  company, which amuses me more than all the rest put together, though I do not
  include you, Miss Coventry, nor yet Mr. Jones, but I am afraid I must Captain
  Lovell. Come, let's ride amongst the carriages and see the ninnies."</p>

  <p>So Mrs. Lumley and I plunged into the crowd, leaving Frank to return to
  his drag and his betting-book, and Cousin John somewhat discontentedly to
  bring up the rear.</p>

  <p>"After all, I don't see much harm in Hampton," said my lively guide as we
  threaded our way between the carriages, "though, to be sure, there are some
  very queer-looking people on the course. I could tell you strange stories of
  most of them, Miss Coventry, only you wouldn't believe me. Do you see that
  old, plainish woman, with such black hair and eyebrows&mdash;something like
  Lady Scapegrace, only not so handsome as my favourite enemy? Would you
  believe it, she might marry three coronets at this moment if she chose, and
  she won't have any one of them. She is not good-looking, you can see; she can
  scarcely write her own name. She has no conversation, I happen to know, for I
  met her once at dinner, and she cannot by any chance put an 'H' into its
  right place. Yet men see something in her that is totally inexplicable to us,
  and she seems to have a mysterious influence over all ages and all sorts. One
  of these infatuated noblemen is decrepit and twaddling; the other a stern,
  reserved man that up to forty years of age was supposed to be the very
  impersonation of common sense; and the third, young, clever, and handsome, a
  man that might marry half the nicest women in England if he liked. And why,
  do you think, she won't pick and choose from such a trio? Why, forsooth,
  because she has set her stupid heart on a drunken stockbroker, who won't have
  a word to say to her, and would have been here to-day, I have no doubt, if he
  hadn't been afraid of meeting <i>her</i>. Well, there's a stranger story than
  <i>that</i> about the girl with long fair hair in the next carriage. You can
  see her now, in a pink bonnet, drinking sherry and soda water. It is supposed
  that she is old Goldfinch's daughter, and that he won't give her a farthing;
  but I know somebody who knows his lawyer, and that girl <i>will</i> have half
  a million, if she don't drink herself to death before old Goldfinch takes his
  departure from this wicked world. She is beautiful and clever and
  accomplished, and all the young men are in love with her; but she cannot keep
  sober, and in three years' time she will have lost her youth and her health
  and her faculties, and in all probability will finish in a madhouse. There's
  Frank Lovell making fierce love to her now."</p>

  <p>And as Mrs. Lumley concluded with this amiable remark, I looked round for
  Cousin John, and rode away from her in disgust at her flippancy, and sick at
  heart to think of such a man as Captain Lovell wasting his smiles on such a
  creature. To be sure, he only said three words to her, for when I looked
  round again at the carriage he was gone. There is something very amusing to
  me in the bustle of a racecourse; and yet, after talking to Mrs. Lumley, the
  gloss seemed to be only on the surface. She had told me enough of the company
  to make me fancy there must be some strange history belonging to each. Like
  the man that saw through the roofs of the houses in Madrid, thanks to the
  agency of his familiar, I thought that my demon on a side-saddle had taught
  me to see into the very hearts and secrets of the motley assemblage.</p>

  <p>There was a handsome girl, with beautiful teeth and neatly-braided hair
  and such a brilliant smile, attracting a crowd round her as she sang piquant
  songs in a sweet, deep-toned voice that ought to have made her fortune on the
  stage if it had been properly cultivated&mdash;sang them, too, with a look
  and manner that I have seen seldom rivalled by the cleverest actresses; and I
  thought what a face and form were wasted here to make profit for one knave
  and sport for some fifty fools. As she accompanied herself on the harp, and
  touched its strings with a grace and expression which made amends for a
  certain want of tuition, I could not help fancying her in a drawing-room,
  surrounded by admirers, making many a heart ache with her arch smile and
  winning ways. Without being <i>positively</i> beautiful, she had the knack so
  few women possess of looking charming in every attitude and with every
  expression of countenance; and although her songs were of a somewhat florid
  school, yet I could not help thinking that, with those natural gifts and a
  plaintive old ballad, English or Scotch, such as "Annie Laurie" or "The
  Nut-brown Maid" to bring them out, in a pretty drawing-room, with the
  assistance of a good dressmaker&mdash;dear! she might marry a duke if she
  liked.</p>

  <p>And yet all this belonged to a dark, close-shaved ruffian, with silver
  rings and a yellow handkerchief, who scowled and prowled about her, and
  looked as if he was likely enough to beat her when they got home. But she
  hands up an ivory bowl for contributions amongst the young dandies on the
  roof of a neighbouring coach, who have been listening open-mouthed to the
  siren, and shillings and half-crowns, and a bit of gold from the one last out
  of the Bench, pour into it; and she moves off, to make way for three French
  glee-maidens with a monkey and a tambourine, and the swells return to their
  cigars and their betting, and we are all attention for the next event on the
  card, because it is a gentlemen-riders' race; and the performances will
  consequently be as different as possible from what we have just seen.</p>

  <p>"We'll secure a good place for this, Kate," says Cousin John, edging his
  horse in as near the judges' stand as he can get. "Frank Lovell has a mare to
  run, and I have backed her for a sovereign."</p>

  <p>"Dear, I hope she'll win!" is my ardent rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Kate," says kind Cousin John, who concludes I take an unusual
  interest in his speculations; and forthwith we proceed to criticize the three
  animals brought to the post, and to agree that Captain Lovell's Parachute is
  far the best-looking of the lot; or, as Sir Guy Scapegrace says to the
  well-pleased owner, "If make and shape go for anything, Frank, she ought to
  beat them, as far as they can see."</p>

  <p>Sir Guy is <i>chaperoning</i> a strange-looking party of men and women,
  who have been very noisy since luncheon-time. He is attired in a close-shaved
  hat (which he had the effrontery to take off to me, but I looked the other
  way), a white coat, and a red neckcloth, the usual flower in his mouth being
  replaced for the occasion by a large cigar. Captain Lovell hopes "I admire
  his mare&mdash;she has a look of Brilliant from here, Miss Coventry. 'Baby
  Larkins' of the Lancers is to ride; and The Baby will do her justice if any
  one can. He's far the best of the young ones now."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean his name is 'Baby'?" said I, much amused, "or that you call
  him so because he is such a child? He looks as if he ought to be with mamma
  still." "We always call him 'Baby' in the Lancers," explained Frank, "because
  he joined us so very <i>young</i>. He is nineteen, though you would guess him
  about twelve; but he's got the brains of a man of sixty and the nerves of a
  giant. Ah! Parachute, you may kick, old girl, but you won't get rid of
  <i>that</i> child!"</p>

  <p>And sure enough "The Baby" sat like a rock, with a grim smile, and
  preserving throughout a silence and <i>sang froid</i> which nothing seemed
  able to overcome. Two more seedy-looking animals made up the entry. The lamer
  one of the two was ridden by a stout major with a redundancy of moustaches,
  the other by a lanky cornet of Heavy Dragoons, who seemed not to know where
  on earth to dispose of his arms and legs, besides finding his cap somewhat in
  his way, and being much embarrassed with his whip. They gallop up and down
  before starting, till I wonder how any galloping can be left for the race;
  and after a futile attempt or two they get away, The Baby making strong
  running, the stout Major waiting closely upon his infantine antagonist, while
  the long cornet, looming like a windmill in the distance, brings up the
  rear.</p>

  <p>"Parachute still making running," says John, standing erect in his
  stirrups, his honest face beaming with excitement. "Woa, horse!&mdash;Stand
  still, White-Stockings&mdash;now they reach the turn, and The Baby takes a
  pull&mdash;Gad, old Ganymede's coming up. Well done, Major&mdash;no, the old
  one's flogging. Parachute wins. Now, Baby!&mdash;now Major&mdash;the
  horse!&mdash;the mare!&mdash;Best race I ever saw in my life&mdash;a dead
  heat&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!" The latter explosion of mirth is due to the
  procrastinated arrival of the long cornet, who flogs and works as religiously
  home as if he had a hundred more behind him, and who reaches the weighing
  enclosure in time to ascertain with his own eyes that Ganymede has won, the
  lame plater who rejoices in that classical appellation having struggled home
  first by a head, "notwithstanding," as the sporting papers afterwards
  expressed themselves, "the judicious riding and beautiful finish of that
  promising young jockey, Mr. B. Larkins." The Baby himself, however, is
  unmoved as usual, nodding to Parachute's disappointed owner without moving a
  muscle of his countenance. He merely remarks, "Short of work, Frank. Told you
  so afore I got up," and putting on a tiny white overcoat like a plaything,
  disappears, and is seen no more.</p>

  <p>What a confusion there is in getting away! Sir Guy Scapegrace has a yearly
  bet with young Phaethon, who wanted to invite me on his box, as to which
  shall get first to Kensington on their way back to town. You would suppose
  Sir Guy was very happy at home by his anxiety to be off. The two drags are
  soon bumping and rolling and rattling along the sward. The narrow lane
  through which they must make their way is completely blocked up with
  spring-vans, and tax-carts, and open carriages, and shut carriages, and
  broughams, and landaus, and every description of vehicle that ever came out
  of Long Acre; whilst more four-horse coaches, with fast teams and still
  faster loads, are thundering in the rear. Slang reigns supreme; and John
  Gilpin's friend, who had a "ready wit," would here meet with his match. Nor
  are jest and repartee (what John calls "chaff") the only missiles bandied
  about. Toys, knocked off "the sticks" for the purpose, darken the air as they
  fly from one vehicle to another, and the broadside from a well-supplied coach
  is like that of a seventy-four. Fun and good-humour abound, but confusion
  gets worse confounded. Young Phaethon's wheel is locked with a
  market-gardener's, who is accompanied by two sisters-in-law and the suitors
  of those nowise disconcerted damsels, all more or less intoxicated.
  Thriftless has his near leader in the back-seat of a pony-carriage, and Sir
  Guy's off-wheeler is over the pole. John and I agree to make a detour, have a
  pleasant ride in the country, never mind about dinner, and so get back to
  London by moonlight. As we reach a quiet, sequestered lane, and inhale the
  pleasant fragrance of the hawthorn&mdash;always sweetest towards
  nightfall&mdash;we hear a horse's tramp behind us, and are joined by Frank
  Lovell, who explains with unnecessary distinctness that "he always makes a
  practice of <i>riding back</i> from Hampton to avoid the crowd, and always
  comes <i>that</i> way." If so, he must be in the habit of taking a
  considerable detour. But he joins our party, and we ride home together.</p>

  <p>How beautifully the moon shone upon the river as we crossed Kew Bridge
  that calm, silent, summer night! How it flickered through their branches and
  silvered over the old trees, and what a peaceful, lovely landscape it was! I
  thought Frank's low, sweet voice quite in keeping with the time and the
  scene. As we rode together, John lagging a good deal behind (that bay horse
  of John's never <i>could</i> walk with White Stockings), I could not help
  thinking how much I had misunderstood Captain Lovell's character. What a deal
  of feeling&mdash;almost of romance&mdash;there was under that conventional
  exterior which he wore before the world! I liked him so much more now I came
  to know him better. I was quite sorry when we had to wish him "good-night"
  and John and I rode thoughtfully home through the quiet streets. I thought my
  cousin's manner was altered too, though I scarce knew how. His farewell
  sounded more constrained, more polite than usual, when he left me at Aunt
  Deborah's door. And whilst I was undressing I reflected on all the
  proceedings of the day, and tried to remember what I had done that could
  possibly have displeased good-natured John. The more I went over it,
  backwards and forwards, the less could I make of it. "Can it be possible," I
  thought at last; "can it be possible that Cousin John&mdash;" And here I
  popped out my candle and jumped into bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <p class="first">I really had not courage to take my usual canter the morning
  after Hampton Races. I did not feel as if I could face the umbrella and the
  cigar at the rails in "the Ride," and yet I rang the bell once for my maid to
  help me on with my habit, and had my hand on it more than once to order my
  horse; but I thought better of it. Poor Aunt Deborah's cold was still bad,
  though she was downstairs; so I determined to take care of her, in common
  gratitude, and give her the advantage of my agreeable society. I am very fond
  of Aunt Deborah in my own way, and I know there is nothing she likes so much
  as a "quiet morning with Kate."</p>

  <p>The hours passed off rather slowly till luncheon-time. I did forty-two
  stitches of worsted-work&mdash;I never do more than fifty at a time, unless
  it's "grounding"&mdash;and I got off Hannah More because Aunt Deborah was too
  hoarse to read to <i>me</i>, and I really cannot read that excellent work to
  <i>her</i> without laughing; but I thought luncheon never would be ready, and
  when it did come I couldn't eat any. However, I went upstairs afterwards, and
  smoothed my hair and set my collar straight, and was glad to hear Aunt
  Deborah give her usual order that she was "at home" with her usual solemnity.
  I had not been ten minutes in the drawing-room before a knock at the door
  brought my heart into my mouth, and our tragic footman announced "Captain
  Lovell" in his most tragic voice. In marched Frank, who had never set eyes on
  my aunt in his life, and shook hands with <i>me</i>, and made <i>her</i> a
  very low bow, with a degree of effrontery that nothing but a <i>man</i> could
  ever have been capable of assuming. Aunt Deborah drew herself up&mdash;and
  she really is very formidable when she gets on her <i>high
  horse</i>&mdash;and looked first at me, and then at Frank, and then at me
  again; and I blushed like a fool, and hesitated, and introduced "Captain
  Lovell" to "My aunt, Miss Horsingham!" and I didn't the least know what to do
  next, and had a great mind to make a bolt for it and run upstairs. But our
  visitor seemed to have no misgivings whatever, and smoothed his hat and
  talked about the weather as if he had known us all from childhood. I have
  often remarked that if you only deprive a man of the free use of his hands
  there is no difficulty which he is unable to face. Give him something to
  handle and keep fidgeting at, and he seems immediately to be in his element,
  never mind what it is&mdash;a paper-knife and a book to open, or a flower to
  pull in pieces, or a pair of scissors and a bit of thread to snip, or even
  the end of a stick to suck&mdash;and he draws inspiration, and what is more
  to the purpose, <i>conversation</i>, from any and all of these sources.</p>

    <p class="caption">Our visitor smoothed his hat and talked about the
    weather.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>But let him have his hands entirely to himself, give him nothing to "lay
  hold of," and he is completely dumbfoundered on the spot. Here was Frank
  brushing and smoothing away at his hat till it shone like black satin, and
  facing my aunt with a gallantry and steadiness beyond all praise; but I
  believe if I could have snatched it away from him and hid it under the sofa,
  he would have been routed at once, and must have fled in utter bewilderment
  and dismay. After my aunt had replied courteously enough to a few commonplace
  observations, she gave one of her ominous coughs, and I trembled for the
  result.</p>

  <p>"Captain <i>Beville</i>," said my aunt. "I think I once knew a family of
  your name in Hampshire&mdash;the New Forest, if I remember rightly."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," said Frank, nowise disconcerted, and with a sly glance at me,
  "my name is Lovell."</p>

  <p>"Oh," replied my aunt, with a considerable assumption of stateliness,
  "then&mdash;ahem!&mdash;Captain <i>Greville</i>, I don't think I have ever
  had the pleasure of meeting you before."</p>

  <p>And my aunt looked as if she didn't care whether she ever met him again.
  This would have been a "poser" to most people; but Frank applied himself
  diligently to his hat, and opened the trenches in his own way.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, Miss Horsingham," said he, "that I have taken advantage of
  my intimacy with your nephew to call upon you without a previous
  introduction, in hopes of ascertaining what has become of an old brother
  officer of mine, a namesake of yours, and consequently, I should conclude, a
  relative. There is, I believe, only one family in England of your name.
  Excuse me, Miss Horsingham, for so personal a remark, but I am convinced he
  must have been a near connection from a peculiarity which every one who knows
  anything about our old English families is aware belongs to yours: my poor
  friend Charlie had a beautiful 'hand.' <i>You</i>, madame, I perceive, own
  the same advantage; therefore I am convinced you must be a near connection of
  my old comrade. You may think me impertinent, but there is no mistaking 'the
  Horsingham hand.'"</p>

  <p>Aunt Deborah gave in at once.</p>

  <p>"I cannot call to mind at this moment any relative of mine who is likely
  to have served with you" (nor was this to be wondered at, the warrior <i>aux
  blanches mains</i> being a fabulous creation of wicked Frank); "but I have no
  doubt, Captain Lovell, that you are correct. I have great pleasure in making
  your acquaintance, particularly as you seem well acquainted with our
  belongings. Do you stay any length of time in town?"</p>

  <p>"I seldom remain till the end of the season; but this year I think I
  shall. By the way, Miss Horsingham, I saw a curious old picture the other day
  in the West of England, purporting to be a portrait of the celebrated 'Ysonde
  of Brittany, with the White Hand,' in which I traced a strong resemblance to
  some of the Horsinghams, with whom I am acquainted. Yours is, I believe, an
  old Norman family; and as I am a bit of an antiquary" (O Frank, Frank!), "I
  consulted my friend Sir J. Burke on the subject, who assures me that the 'Le
  Montants'&mdash;Godfrey le Montant, if you remember, distinguished himself
  highly in the second crusade&mdash;that the Le Montants claimed direct
  descent from the old Dukes of Brittany, and consequently from the very lady
  of whom we are speaking. Roger le Montant came over with the Conqueror, and
  although strangely omitted from the Roll of Battle Abbey, doubtless received
  large grants of land in Hampshire from William; and two generations later we
  can trace his descendant, Hugo, in the same locality, under the Anglicized
  name of Horsengem, now corrupted to Horsingham, of which illustrious family
  you are, of course, aware yours is a younger branch. It is curious that the
  distinguishing mark of the race should have been preserved in all its shapely
  beauty," added Frank, with the gravest face possible, and glancing at the
  lavender kids, "through so many changes and so many successive
  generations."</p>

  <p>Aunt Deborah was delighted. "Such a clever young man, my dear!" she said
  to me afterwards. "Such manners! such a voice! <i>quite</i> one of the old
  school&mdash;evidently well-bred, and with that respect for good blood which
  in these days, I regret to say, is fast becoming obsolete. Kate, I like him
  vastly!"</p>

  <p>In the meantime she entered freely into conversation with our visitor; and
  before he went away&mdash;by which time his hat looked as if it had been
  ironed&mdash;"she hoped he would call again; she was always at home till two
  o'clock, and trusted to have the pleasure of his company at dinner as soon as
  she was well enough to get anybody to meet him."</p>

  <p>So Frank went off to ride in the Park on the neatest possible brown hack;
  for I saw him quite plainly trot round the corner as I went into the balcony
  to water my poor geraniums.</p>

  <p>Well, I waited and waited, and John never came for me, as was his usual
  habit; and I began to think I must lose my ride, for I am not allowed to go
  by myself in the afternoons; and at last I was obliged to coax Aunt Deborah
  to take me out in the open carriage, for it was a beautiful day, and it would
  be just the thing for her cold. So we went dowagering about, and shopped in
  Bond Street, and looked at some lace in Regent Street, and left cards for
  Lady Horsingham, as in duty bound, after helping her to "make a good ball;"
  and then we went into the Ring, and I looked and looked everywhere, but I
  could not see anything like Frank or his brown hack. To be sure the Ride was
  as crowded as a fair. But I <i>did</i> see Cousin John, and I <i>must</i> say
  it was too bad of him to keep me waiting and watching all the afternoon, and
  then never to take the trouble of sending a note or a message, but to start
  off by himself and escort Miss Molasses, as if he was her brother <i>at
  least</i>, if not a nearer relation. Miss Molasses, forsooth, with her
  lackadaisical ways and her sentimental nonsense; and that goose John taking
  it all in open-mouthed, as if she was an angel upon earth. Well, at all
  events she don't <i>ride</i>like me. Such a figure <i>I</i> never saw on a
  horse!&mdash;all on one side, like the handle of a teapot, bumping when she
  trots and wobbling when she canters, with braiding all over her habit, and a
  <i>white</i> feather in her hat, and gauntlet gloves (<i>of course</i> one
  may wear gauntlet gloves for hunting, but <i>that's</i> not London), and her
  sallow face. People call her interesting, but <i>I</i> call her
  <i>bilious</i>. And a wretched long-legged Rosinante, with <i>round</i> reins
  and tassels, and a netting over its ears, and a head like a fiddle-case, and
  no more action than a camp-stool. Such a couple I never beheld. I wonder John
  wasn't ashamed to be seen with her, instead of leaning his hand upon her
  horse's neck, and looking up in her face with his broad, honest smile, and
  taking no more notice of her sister Jane, who is a clever girl, with
  something in her, than if she had been the groom. I was provoked with him
  beyond all patience. Had it been Mrs. Lumley, for instance, I could have
  understood it; for she certainly is a chatty, amusing woman, though
  dreadfully <i>bold</i>, and it is a pleasure to see her canter up the Park in
  her close-fitting habit and her neat hat, with her beautiful round figure
  swaying gracefully to every motion of her horse, yet so imperceptibly that
  you could fancy she might balance a glassful of water on her head without
  spilling a drop. To say nothing of the brown mare, the only animal in London
  I covet, who is herself a picture. Such action! such a mouth! and such a
  shape! I coaxed Aunt Deborah to wait near Apsley House, on purpose that we
  might see her before we left the Park. And sure enough we did see her, as
  usual surrounded by a swarm of admirers; and next to her&mdash;positively
  next to her&mdash;Frank Lovell, on the very brown hack that had been standing
  an hour at our door. He saw me too, and took his hat off; and she said
  something to him, and they both laughed!</p>

  <p>I asked Aunt Deborah to go home, for it was getting late, and the evening
  air was not very good for her poor cold. I did not feel well myself somehow;
  and when dear aunty told me I looked pale, I was forced to confess to a
  slight headache. I am not subject to low spirits generally&mdash;I have no
  patience with a woman that is&mdash;but of course one is sometimes a "little
  out of sorts;" and I confess I did not feel quite up to the mark that
  evening, I cannot tell why. If John flatters himself it was because he
  behaved so brutally in disappointing me, he is very much mistaken; and as for
  Captain Lovell, I am sure he may ride with anybody he likes for what I care.
  I wonder, with all his cleverness, he can't see how that woman is only
  laughing at him. However, it's no business of mine. So I went into my
  boudoir, drank some tea, and then locked myself in and had a "good cry."</p>

  <p class="first">T is wonderful how soon the London season comes to an end;
  and, in fact, it is difficult to say when its tide is really at the flood.
  Single men&mdash;and they are necessary ingredients for gaiety wherever there
  are young ladies&mdash;single men seldom go to town much before the Derby.
  Then comes Ascot, for which meeting they leave the metropolis, and enjoy some
  quiet retreat in the neighbourhood of Windsor, taking with them many potables
  and what <i>they</i> call a "dog cook." After Ascot people begin to think
  about going away, and before you know where you are three more weeks have
  elapsed, and it is July. Dear, what a scatter there is then!&mdash;some off
  to Norway, some to Cowes, some to Caithness, and some to Galway. Those that
  remain for Goodwood are sure to go to Newmarket; and the man who sticks
  religiously to the pavement, and resists the allurements of all the
  above-mentioned resorts, only does so because he is meditating a trip to
  California, Kamtschatka, or the Rocky Mountains, and is so preoccupied with
  portable soup, patent saddle-bags, bowie-knives, and revolvers that he might
  just as well be at his ultimate destination in person for all the benefit one
  gets from his society. I confess I don't like the end of the season. You keep
  on trying to be gay, whilst your friends are dropping off and disappearing
  one by one. Like the survivor in some horrid pestilence, you know your time
  must come too; but you shut your eyes to the certainty, and greet every fresh
  departure with a gaiety more forced and a smile more and more hopeless.</p>

  <p>Well, <i>my</i> London season too was drawing to its close, and I confess
  I had enjoyed it very much. What with my morning gallops and afternoon
  saunters (for John had returned to his allegiance, and came to take me out
  regularly, although he always joined Miss Molasses' party when he got into
  the Park); what with Aunt Deborah's tiresome cold, which obliged me to go
  about a good deal by myself, and the agreeable society of Frank Lovell, who
  never missed an opportunity of being with us, I had been very happy, and I
  was quite sorry to think it was all so soon to come to an end. John was
  already talking of a fishing excursion to Norway, and actually proposed that
  I should accompany him; an arrangement which Aunt Deborah declared "was
  totally impracticable," and which I confess I do not myself think would have
  been a very good plan. I had made several pleasant acquaintances, amongst
  whom I may number Lady Scapegrace&mdash;that much-maligned dame having taken
  a great fancy to me ever after the affair of the bull, and proving, when I
  came to know her better, a very different person from what the world gave her
  credit for being. With all her faults&mdash;the chief of which were an
  uncontrollable temper and much too strong feelings for the nineteenth
  century&mdash;she had a warm, affectionate heart, and was altogether an
  energetic, straightforward woman, very much in earnest, whether for good or
  evil. But there was one thing that vexed me considerably amongst all my
  regrets for past pleasures and castles in the air for the future, and this
  was the conduct of Captain Lovell. What did he mean? I couldn't make him out
  at all. One day calling on my aunt at eleven in the morning, and staying to
  luncheon, and making himself so agreeable to <i>her</i>, and bringing
  bouquets of the loveliest flowers (which I know came from Harding's or else
  direct from Covent Garden) to <i>me</i>; and then going away as if he had
  fifty more things to say, and lingering over his farewell as if he was on the
  eve of departure for China instead of Mayfair, and joining me again in the
  Park, and asking me if I was going to the Opera, and finding out all my
  engagements and intentions, as if he couldn't possibly live five minutes out
  of my sight; and then, perhaps, never coming near us for days together, till
  even my aunt "wondered what had become of that pleasant Captain Lovell;" and
  when he met me in the Park, taking off his hat with a civil bow, as if he had
  only been introduced the night before. All this I couldn't make out, and I
  didn't half like, as I told Lady Scapegrace one hot morning, sitting with her
  in her boudoir. I was a good deal at Lady Scapegrace's now, and the more so
  because that was the place of all others at which I was least likely to meet
  Sir Guy. "Men are so uncertain, my dear," said her ladyship, sitting in a
  morning deshabille, with her long black hair combed straight out over her
  shoulders and reaching nearly to her knees. "If you ask me candidly whether
  he <i>means</i> anything, I tell you I think Frank Lovell a shocking flirt."
  "<i>Flirt!</i>" I replied, half crying with vexation. "It's time enough for
  him to <i>flirt</i> with me when I give him any encouragement. But I don't,
  Lady Scapegrace, and I never will. I hope I'm too proud for that. Only when a
  man is always in <i>one's pocket</i> wherever one goes; when he sends one
  bouquets, and rides out in the rain to get one's bracelet mended, and watches
  one from a corner of the room if one happens to be dancing with anybody else,
  and looks pleased when one is dull and cross when one laughs&mdash;why, he
  either does prefer, or ought to prefer, one's society to that of Miss
  Molasses and Mrs. Lumley, and that is why I tell you I can't quite make out
  Captain Lovell."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk of that odious woman," exclaimed Lady Scapegrace, between whom
  and Mrs. Lumley there was a polite feud of some years' standing. "She is
  ready and willing to jump down Frank Lovell's throat, or any one else's for
  the matter of that, so bold as she is, and so utterly regardless&mdash;such
  stories, my dear. But take my advice, Kate: play that cheerful cousin of
  yours against Master Frank. I never knew it fail yet if you only go the right
  way to work. Men are not only very vain, but very jealous. Don't let him
  think you are going <i>to marry</i> your cousin, or he may consider it a
  capital arrangement and a sort of matter-of-course affair, which is all in
  his favour. Men like Frank always prefer other people's property, and I have
  no doubt he would be over head and ears in love with you if you were not
  single. So don't be going to marry Mr. Jones, but just appeal to him about
  every earthly thing you do or say, look after him when he leaves the room, as
  if you couldn't bear him out of your sight. Get Frank to abuse him if you
  can, and then fight his battles fiercely; and directly the latter thinks
  there is a rival in the field he will be down on his knees, you mark my
  words, in two days' time at the furthest. I think I ought to know what men
  are, my dear" (and to do Lady Scapegrace justice, she had studied that
  variety of the creation to some purpose, or she was much maligned). "I know
  that they can't, any of them, see three yards before their noses, and that
  you can turn and twist them which way you will if you only go upon this
  principle&mdash;that they are full of vanity and self-conceit, and totally
  deficient in brains."</p>

  <p>"But I'm sure Captain Lovell's a clever man," said I, not disposed to come
  to quite such sweeping conclusions as those of my monitress;
  "and&mdash;and&mdash;I don't mean to say that I <i>care</i> about him, Lady
  Scapegrace, but still it mightn't answer with <i>him</i>,
  and&mdash;and&mdash;I shouldn't like to lose him altogether."</p>

  <p>"Pooh! Lose him! Fiddlestick!" rejoined her ladyship. "You'll see. He is
  to join our party at Greenwich this afternoon. By the way, when Sir Guy heard
  you were coming, he proposed to drive us all down on that horrid coach. But I
  told him we should be taken for the people that <i>usually</i> occupy it, and
  nothing should induce me to go; so that plan was given up. But you and I will
  go down in the barouche, and I'll call for you, and we'll take Mr. Jones with
  us. And mind you're very civil to him, and only notice the other in a quiet,
  good-humoured way&mdash;for he mustn't think you do it out of pique&mdash;and
  before the whitebait is on the table you'll see he'll be a different man. But
  now you must go&mdash;there's a dear. I'll call for you at five. It's too bad
  to turn you out; but I'm never at home to any one between three and half-past
  four. Good-bye, dear, good-bye."</p>

  <p>And Lady Scapegrace kissed me most affectionately, and promised to call
  for me punctually at five, till which hour I cannot make out why her time was
  always engaged.</p>

  <p>As I tripped downstairs, hoping to make my escape without being attended
  by the whole establishment to open the house-door, whom should I come across
  but odious Sir Guy, in a sort of scarlet fancy dress, which I concluded was
  his morning "demi-toilette." He actually had the effrontery to propose that I
  should accompany him to the stable, and that he should then "show me
  <i>his</i> boudoir&mdash;hey? You look like a rose this morning, Miss
  Coventry. Should like to transplant you. What?" And whilst he stood dodging
  and grinning on the stairs, I managed to slip by him and get safe into the
  street. I wonder <i>when</i> men think they are beginning to grow old! I am
  sure Sir Guy fancies he is still in the flower of his youth, and so charming
  that nobody can resist him.</p>

  <p>What a pleasant day we had! Only we four&mdash;Lady Scapegrace, Cousin
  John, Captain Lovell, and I. We went down in Lady Scapegrace's barouche, and
  walked in Greenwich Park, and adjourned to a nice room with a bay window, and
  such a lookout over the river, blushing rose colour in the evening sun. And
  the whitebait was so good, and the champagne-cup so nice; and we were all in
  such spirits, and Frank was so kind and attentive and agreeable I couldn't
  find it in my heart to be cross to him. So it ended in our making up any
  little imaginary differences we may have had and becoming better friends than
  ever. As we sat in the balcony over the river&mdash;the two gentlemen smoking
  their after-dinner cigars, and we ladies sipping our coffee&mdash;I thought I
  had never enjoyed an evening so much; and even John, who was generally
  dreadfully afraid of Lady Scapegrace, became quite lively and gallant (for
  him), and they laughed and talked and joked about all sorts of things; while
  Frank leant over my shoulder and conversed more gravely than was his habit;
  and I listened, and thought him pleasanter even than usual. By the way, that
  lilac bonnet never quite lost the odour of tobacco afterwards.</p>

  <p>"How quick the time passes!" said Frank, with almost a sigh. "Can't we
  <i>do</i> anything to put off horrid London and home and bed? Let's all go to
  Vauxhall."</p>

  <p>"What do <i>you</i> say, Mr. Jones?" inquired Lady Scapegrace, who was
  always ready for a lark; "you're our <i>chaperon</i>, you know. Do you think
  you can be responsible?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, John!" I exclaimed. "You promised to take me once before the end
  of the season. We shall never have such another chance."</p>

  <p>"This is a capital night to go," remarked Frank, "because there is a new
  riding-woman; and you can take a lesson, Miss Coventry, in case you should
  wish to perform in public." Cousin John could not possibly hold out against
  all three; and although I think in his heart he did not entirely approve, the
  carriage was ordered, the bill paid, and we were rolling along through the
  cool summer night <i>en route</i> for Vauxhall.</p>

  <p>"My dear," said Lady Scapegrace to me as we sidled through the entrance of
  that place of amusement, and the gentlemen remained behind to pay, "you are
  doing anything but what I told you; scarcely three words have you spoken to
  your cousin, who, by the way, is very pleasant. <i>I</i> think I shall
  <i>take him up</i> and improve him on my own account; but as for you, my
  dear, I can see plainly it's all over with you."</p>

  <p>"And you <i>really</i> leave town to-morrow?" said Frank as we walked arm
  in arm up one of those shaded alleys which lead to the "Hermit," or the
  "Gipsy," or some other excuse for a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
not too much under
  the lamps. By the way, why is it that a party never can keep together at
  Vauxhall? Lady Scapegrace and I had particularly stipulated that we were not
  to separate under any circumstances. "Whatever happens, do let us keep
  together," we mutually implored at least ten times during the first five
  minutes, and yet no sooner did we pair off arm in arm than the distance began
  gradually to increase, till we found ourselves in "couples," totally
  independent of each other's proceedings. In this manner we saw the
  horsemanship, and the acrobats, and the man with the globe, and all the other
  eccentricities of the circus. I really think I could have ridden quite as
  nicely as Madame Rose d'Amour had I been mounted on an equally well-broken
  animal with the one which curvetted and caracoled under that much-rouged and
  widely-smiling dame. They do look pretty too at a little distance those
  histrionic horsewomen, with their trappings and their spangles and their
  costume of Francis I. I often wonder whether people really rode out hawking,
  got up so entirely regardless of expense, in the days of the Field of the
  Cloth of Gold. From the horsemanship we went to see the people dance, which
  they did with a degree of vigour and hilarity such as might be introduced in
  a modified form with great advantage into good society; and here we came
  across Cousin John and Lady Scapegrace just in time to witness a short and
  abrupt interview between the latter and Sir Guy. Yes, there was Sir Guy, with
  the flower in his mouth and all, dancing, actually <i>dancing</i>&mdash;and
  he can't be much less than sixty&mdash;with a little smart lady, wearing the
  most brilliant colour and the blackest eyelashes and the reddest lips and the
  lightest eyes I ever saw upon a human being. The little lady, whose hair,
  moreover, was dressed <i> l'Imp&eacute;ratrice</i>, thereby imparting
additional
  boldness to a countenance not remarkable for modesty, frisked and whisked
  round Sir Guy with a vivacity that must have been of Parisian growth; whilst
  the Baronet laboured ponderously along with true British determination, like
  a man who habitually wears very thick shoes and is used to take his own time.
  In the course of his evolutions he brought his foot down heavily on the skirt
  of a lady's dress, and turning round to apologize found himself face to face
  with his wife! To do him justice he was not the least taken aback&mdash;anger
  rather than confusion seemed to be his dominant feeling; and although he
  tried to smother a rising oath in a laugh, or rather a grin, it was such a
  muscular contraction of the mouth as does not give me the idea of a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Come out for a lark too, my lady, hey?" said the Baronet, studiously
  interposing his large person between "my lady" and his partner. "Reminds one
  of Paris; dance with anybody, whether one knows them or not." And Sir Guy
  tried to look as if he was telling the truth with indifferent success. But
  Lady Scapegrace's face was a perfect study; I never saw a countenance so
  expressive of scorn&mdash;intense scorn&mdash;and yet, as it seemed to me,
  not so much of him as of herself.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you amuse yourself, Sir Guy," she said very quietly; but her
  lip was as white as ashes while she spoke. "I should think this place must
  suit you exactly. Mr. Jones, we shall be late for the fireworks." And she
  swept on, taking no further notice of the discomfited Sir Guy, whilst Frank
  and I followed in her wake, feeling rather awkward even at witnessing this
  ill-timed <i>rencontre</i>.</p>

  <p>"And so you leave town to-morrow, Miss Coventry?" said Frank; and I
  thought his voice shook a little whilst he spoke. "I shall ride down Lowndes
  Street every day, and think how deserted it looks. No more walks in the
  morning for <i>me</i>, no more pleasant rides in the afternoons; I shall send
  my hacks home and sulk by myself, for I shall be miserable when my friends
  are gone. Do you know, Miss Coventry"&mdash;I listened, all attention; how
  could I tell what he might <i>not</i> be going to say?&mdash;"do you know
  that I have never had courage to ask you something till to-night?" (Goodness!
  I thought, <i>now</i> it's coming, and my heart beat as it does when I'm
  going out hunting.) "I want you to give me" (a lock of my hair, thinks I.
  Well, I don't know; perhaps I may)&mdash;"I want you to give me&mdash;Miss
  Horsingham's receipt for making barley-water; but I know it's a long business
  to write out, and I'm afraid of being troublesome." So that was all, was it?
  I felt half inclined to laugh, and more than half inclined to cry; but
  turning round I was somewhat consoled to find Lady Scapegrace and her
  cavalier close behind us; and I do confess I rather attributed Frank's
  extremely moderate request to their immediate vicinity; there was no
  opportunity, however, of renewing the subject. John had said all he
  <i>had</i> to say to his companion. John soon gets high and dry with these
  smart ladies, and they seem mutually tired of each other; so we got the
  carriage and took our departure, Frank pressing my hand as he bade me
  farewell, and whispering, "<i>Au revoir</i>, Miss Coventry; something tells
  me it won't be very long before we meet again." What <i>could</i> he
  mean?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a melancholy work to glide out of London by the last
  train, and to think that one's gaieties were over for that summer, and that
  there was nothing to look forward to till the hunting season but Dangerfield
  and Lady Horsingham, and the wearisome monotony of a regular country-house
  life. Aunt Deborah and I settled ourselves comfortably in a roomy first-class
  carriage, she with her knitting and I with the last <i>Punch</i>&mdash;in
  which, by the way, was the portrait of a dandy, the very image of Frank
  Lovell&mdash;and prepared for our journey, as ladies generally do, by
  arranging multifarious outworks of smelling-bottles, shawls, reticules,
  parasols, etc., without which paraphernalia no well-bred woman can possibly
  travel a hundred yards. I confess I dreaded the trip. I was too well aware by
  experience that a railway always makes Aunt Deborah rather cross and me very
  sleepy; so I knew what was coming, and I was not disappointed. Before we had
  fairly left the outskirts of London I saw by the way in which my aunt laid
  down her knitting and the ominous cough or two in which she indulged that I
  was in for a lecture; and sure enough, just as we emerged on the open fields
  and began to smell the fresh country air, it began.</p>

  <p>"Kate," said my aunt, "as we are going to a very regular and
  well-conducted establishment, I think it is a good opportunity for me to say
  a few words to you as regards your past conduct."</p>

  <p>"Good gracious, aunt!" I replied, quite frightened, "what have I
  done?"</p>

  <p>"My dear," said my aunt, "I have seen a great deal going on lately that I
  have taken no notice of; but it don't follow that I should approve of it any
  more than John."</p>

  <p>"And what has John got to do with it, I should like to know?" I rejoined,
  firing up on the instant, for such a chance of carrying the war into the
  enemy's country was not to be neglected. "John, indeed! I'm sure, aunt, John
  encourages me in all my <i>unfeminine</i> pursuits, as you call them; and if
  he has been telling tales or setting you against me, I'll soon let him know
  what I think of such conduct. I'll soon tell him that I'm not going to be
  accountable to him; indeed, that I'm not going to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush, my dear," said Aunt Deborah; "there is no occasion for all this
  animosity against John. After all, it is very natural, poor fellow, that he
  should feel aggrieved and annoyed. There's that Captain Lovell: I don't mean
  to say that he's not an agreeable, well-informed young man, but there he is
  coming to see you at all hours, riding with you in the Park, whispering to
  you at the Opera, bringing you new music and <i>old</i> china and fresh
  flowers, and conducting himself altogether as if he was either your accepted
  suitor or mine&mdash;and I don't think the latter very likely,
  Kate&mdash;whereas, you know, John&mdash;" My aunt stopped short. The ringing
  of the bell and loud exclamations of "Trotter's Heath! Trotter's Heath! All
  out for Sheepshanks, Fleecyfold, and Market Muddlebury!" announced that we
  had arrived at the Muddlebury Junction; and the opportune entrance into the
  carriage of a stranger, who seemed extremely anxious concerning the safety of
  a brace of pointers that accompanied him, effectually prevented my aunt from
  proceeding with her discourse; while the dead silence which followed the
  renewed puffing of the engine, and the vibration of the train, gave me an
  opportunity of studying attentively the person and features of our new
  fellow-traveller.</p>

  <p>I don't think I ever saw a man so freckled in my life. Even the backs of
  his hands (for he wore no gloves&mdash;I should think didn't even know <i>his
  number</i>!) were studded with spots till you could have hardly put a pin's
  point on a place free from this horrid disfigurement. His face, too, was like
  a plum-pudding on which the fruit had been showered with a most liberal hand;
  but the features were good, and had it not been for his red hair, a little
  grizzled, and his stiff red whiskers, the bright-blue eyes and white teeth
  would almost have entitled him to be considered "handsome." He had a strong,
  stiff-built figure, about the middle size, well made for everything but
  dancing, and large, <i>useful</i> feet encased in the stoutest double-soled
  shooting shoes. The latter articles of costume proved him at once to be a
  country gentleman. Every one must have remarked this peculiarity in that
  enviable class. Their attire, particularly as regards the lower man, is
  invariably of a nature to defy the utmost inclemency of the weather, and is
  worn totally irrespective of the season or the pursuit in which the owner may
  chance to be engaged at the time. But even independent of these tell-tales
  the stranger's social position was easily enough discerned by the deference
  with which he was treated "along the line," and the title of "Squire," which
  greeted him from guards, porters, and book-keepers at every station we
  passed.</p>

  <p>So humane a master of dumb animals, or one so fidgety as to their welfare,
  I never came across; and this, I confess, prepossessed me in his favour.
  Every time the train stopped out jumped our fellow-traveller, and off he went
  to a certain van containing his treasures, from which he emerged with a very
  red face and a constantly-repeated apology for disturbing me on his return to
  his seat. Despite of his thick shoes and his freckles, I could see the man
  was a gentleman; but, dear me, what a contrast to the smart gentlemen I had
  lately been accustomed to meet! Beyond a "Beg your pardon; I fear I'm very
  much in your way," accompanied by such a vivid blush as can be performed only
  by a red-haired man, the Squire did not venture on any communication either
  with me or my aunt; and with the latter's lecture fresh in my mind I did not,
  as may be supposed, dare to take the initiative by dropping my gloves, or
  pretending I couldn't pull up the window, or any other little lady-like
  manoeuvre which lays the foundation of a temporary intimacy, and often
  furnishes one with an agreeable hour's conversation. I can <i>not</i> see why
  one should sit "mum" opposite the same person for miles, merely because one
  has never been introduced.</p>

  <p>When we arrived at length at the Dangerfield Station, where Lady
  Horsingham's emblazoned coach and fat horses were in waiting for us, "the
  Squire," who was here treated with a deference bordering on idolatry, got out
  too. He made an involuntary motion with his hand, as though he would have
  taken his hat off, and wished us "good-morning;" but his shyness got the
  better of him, and he disappeared from the platform, entangled amongst his
  dumb favourites, with a blush that was visible even at the back of his head,
  where the tips of his ears met the rim of his white hat. As we toiled up the
  sandy lane leading from Dangerfield Station to Dangerfield Park, we were
  overtaken by a smart, high dogcart, drawn by a clever, raking-looking bay
  mare, and driven by the owner of the freckles, the pointers, and the white
  hat.</p>

  <p>"Bachelor, my dear," said Aunt Deborah as he whisked by, "and not at all a
  bad-looking man either."</p>

  <p>"How do you know he's a bachelor, aunt?" I naturally inquired.</p>

  <p>"Common-sense, my dear," replied Aunt Deborah sententiously. "I judge of
  people by their belongings. No lady could get into that dogcart without
  dirtying her dress against the wheel; and if he had a wife, that handsome bay
  horse would go with another in her carriage instead of his. Besides, he
  wouldn't be so fond of his pointers if he had anything else to care for; and
  above all, Kate," added my aunt conclusively, "his silk handkerchief wasn't
  hemmed, and he'd a button wanting in the front of his shirt."</p>

  <p>All my life I have had a sinking at my heart when I have heard the ring at
  that great Dangerfield front door bell. It was better in my poor uncle's
  time, for he would have made any place lively; but since his death the Park
  has relapsed into its natural solemnity, and I am quite sure that if ever I
  <i>do</i> go into a convent my sensations will be exactly like those which I
  have always experienced when visiting Aunt Horsingham. The moat alone is
  enough to give one the "blues;" but in addition to that, the thick
  horse-chestnuts grow up to the very windows, and dark Scotch firs shed a
  gloom all over the Park. Dangerfield is one of those places that seem always
  to be in the shade. How the strawberries ever ripen, or the flowers ever
  bloom, or the birds ever sing there is to me a mystery. Outside there are
  dark walls and yew hedges and cypresses, and here and there a copper beech,
  with lawns that are never mown and copses that are never thinned, to say
  nothing of that stagnant moat, with its sombre and prolific vegetation;
  whilst within, black oak wainscoting, and heavy tapestry, and winding
  staircases, and small, deep-set windows, and oddly-shaped rooms, with steps
  at the door like going down into a bath, and doors considerably up and down
  hill, and queer recesses that frighten one out of one's wits to go into, form
  altogether a domicile that would tame the wildest Merry-Andrew in a fortnight
  into as staid and sober and stupid a personage as the veriest Lady Superior
  could desire. Aunt Horsingham received us as usual with a freezing smile.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Kate?" said she, putting two of her cold bony fingers into
  my hand. "I'm afraid you will find it rather dull here after London; but it
  is <i>wholesome</i> for young people to be occasionally sobered a
  little."</p>

  <p>Aunt Horsingham is tall and thin, with a turn-up nose, rather red at the
  point, a back that never stoops, and a grim smile that never varies. She
  dresses in bright colours, affecting strange and startling contrasts, both of
  hues and material. Her hands are always cold and seldom clean; and she has
  sundry uncomfortable notions about damping the spirits of youth and checking
  the exuberance of its gaiety which render her a perfect terror and bugbear to
  the rising generation. When I was a little thing, laughing, prattling, and
  giggling, as children will, an admonishing look from my aunt, with a gaunt
  finger held aloft, and a cold "Kate, don't be silly, my dear," was always
  sufficient to make me dull and gloomy for the rest of the day.</p>

  <p>I should like to know indeed why children are not to be "<i>silly</i>."
  Are grown-up people always so rational in their amusements or irreproachable
  in their demeanour? "Let the child alone," poor Uncle Harry used to say; and
  once I overheard him mutter, "I've more patience with a <i>young</i> fool
  than an <i>old</i> one." Such training has not had a good effect on Cousin
  Amelia. She has been so constantly tutored to conceal her emotions and to
  adopt the carriage and manners of an automaton that the girl is now a
  complete hypocrite. It is quite impossible to make her out. If you tickled
  her, I don't believe you could get her to laugh; and if you struck her, I
  very much doubt whether she would cry. My aunt calls it "self-command;" I
  call it "imbecility." She shook hands with me in her provokingly patronizing
  manner&mdash;"hoped I had brought my horses with me" (as if I was coming to
  spend months at Dangerfield without Brilliant!); "supposed I had my
  side-saddle in the cap-box;" and showed me my room without so much as a
  single kind word of welcome or a cousinly caress. It was quite a relief to
  help dear Aunt Deborah to unpack her dressing-case, and kiss her pleasant
  face, and give her the warm cup of tea without which Aunt Deborah never
  dreams of dressing for dinner.</p>

  <p>Oh, those solemn, heavy, silent, stupid dinners, with the massive plate
  and the dark oak wainscoting, and the servants gliding about like ghosts at a
  festival in Acheron! What a relief it would have been even to have had a
  clownish footman spill soup over one's dress, or ice-cream down one's back,
  or anything to break the monotony of the entertainment! But, no; there we
  sat, Aunt Horsingham remarking that the "weather was dull" and the "crops
  looking very unpromising;" Aunt Deborah with her eyes fixed on a portrait of
  the late Mr. David Jones as a boy, opposite which she invariably took her
  place, and on which, though representing an insignificant urchin in a high
  frill and blue jacket, she gazed intently during the whole repast; Cousin
  Amelia looking at herself in the silver dish-covers, and when those were
  removed relapsing into a state of irritable torpor; and as for poor me, all I
  could do was to think over the pleasures of the past season, and dwell rather
  more than I should otherwise have done on the image of Frank Lovell, and the
  very agreeable acquisition he would have been to such a party. And then the
  evenings were, if possible, worse than the dinners&mdash;work, work,
  work&mdash;mum, mum, mum&mdash;till tea. And after tea Aunt Horsingham would
  read to us, in her dry harsh voice, long passages from the <i>Spectator</i>,
  very excellent articles from the <i>Rambler</i>, highly interesting in their
  day no doubt, but which lose some of their point after an interval of nearly
  a century; or, worse than all, Pope's "Homer" or Cowper's "Task," running the
  lines into each other, so as to avoid what she called "the sing-song of the
  rhymes," till the poet's effusions sounded like the most extraordinary prose,
  cut into lengths, as we ladies should say, for no earthly purpose but to make
  nonsense of the whole thing. Her ladyship never went to bed till eleven; so
  there, having dined at half-past six to a minute, we were forced to sit three
  mortal hours and a half, swallowing yawns and repressing that inexplicable
  disorder termed the "fidgets" till the welcome bed-candles arrived. No wonder
  men drink and smoke and commit all sort of enormities to fill up those
  dreadful hours after dinner. I think if ever I take to tobacco it will be at
  Dangerfield.</p>

  <p>Then of course the Hall was haunted; and of course <i>my</i> passage was
  the one which the ghost particularly affected. It was a sad story that of
  "the Dangerfield ghost." I have got it all out of Aunt Deborah at different
  times; and though I don't exactly believe in the spectre, I can't help
  sometimes crying over the incidents. The fact is, the Horsinghams were quite
  as proud of their ghost as they were of their hand; and although not a very
  creditable tale to any of the family, Aunt Deborah would never forgive me if
  I were not to relate the tragedy which conferred on Dangerfield the honour of
  being a haunted house.</p>

  <p>In the reign of George II, the head of the house, Sir Hugh Horsingham,
  married a young wife, and brought her home to Dangerfield with the usual
  demonstrations and rejoicings peculiar to such an event. Sir Hugh was a dark,
  morose man, considerably older than his bride; stern and forbidding in his
  manners, but possessing deep feelings under a reserved exterior, and a
  courage and determination not to be daunted or subdued. Such a man was
  capable of great things for good or for evil; and such was the very nature on
  which a woman's influence might have produced the most beneficial results.
  But, unfortunately, young Lady Horsingham had but one feeling for her lord,
  and that was intense terror of his anger. She never sought to win his
  confidence; she never entered into his political schemes, his deeper studies,
  or even his country amusements and pursuits. All she thought of was how to
  avoid offending Sir Hugh; and ere long this one idea grew to such a pitch
  that she quite trembled in his presence, could scarcely answer distinctly
  when he spoke to her, and seemed hardly to draw breath in freedom save when
  out of his sight. Such a state of things could have but one
  ending&mdash;distrust and suspicion on one side, unqualified aversion on the
  other. A marriage, never of inclination, as indeed in those days amongst
  great families few marriages were, became an insupportable slavery ere the
  first year of wedded life had elapsed; and by the time an heir was born to
  the house of Horsingham, probably there was no unhappier couple within fifty
  miles of Dangerfield than dark Sir Hugh and his pretty, fair-haired, gentle
  wife. No; she ought never to have married him at all. It was but the night
  before her wedding that she walked in the garden of her father's old
  manor-house with a bright, open-hearted, handsome youth, whose brow wore that
  expression of acute agony which it is so pitiable to witness on a young
  countenance&mdash;that look almost of <i>physical</i> pain, which betokens
  how the iron has indeed "entered the sufferer's soul." "Ah, you may plead,
  'Cousin Edward;' but we women are of a strange mixture, and <i>the
  weakest</i> of us may possess <i>obstinacy</i> such as no earthly
  consideration can overcome." "Lucy! Lucy! for <i>the last</i> time, think of
  it; for the love of Heaven, do not drive me mad; think of it once more; it is
  the last, <i>last</i> chance!" The speaker was white as a sheet, and his
  hollow voice came in hoarse, inarticulate whispers as he looked almost
  fiercely into that dear face to read his doom. Too well he knew the set,
  fixed expression of her delicate profile. She did not dare turn towards him;
  she could not have looked him in the face and persevered; but she kept her
  eyes fastened on the horizon, as though she saw her future in the fading
  sunset; and whilst her heart seemed turning to very stone she kept her lips
  firmly closed; she repressed the tears that would have choked her, and so for
  <i>that</i> time she conquered.</p>

  <p>Lucy had a great idea of duty; hers was no high-principled love of duty
  from the noblest motives, but a morbid dread of self-reproach. She had not
  <i>character</i> enough to do anything out of her own notions of the beaten
  track. She had promised her father she would marry Sir Hugh
  Horsingham&mdash;not that he had the slightest right to exact such a
  promise&mdash;and she felt bound to fulfil it. She never remembered the
  injury she was doing "Cousin Edward," the <i>right</i> which such devotion as
  <i>his</i> ought to have given him. She <i>knew</i> she loved him better than
  any one in the world; she knew she was about to commit an act of the greatest
  injustice towards Sir Hugh; but she had "promised papa," and though she would
  have given worlds to avoid fulfilling her compact, she had not strength of
  mind to break the chain and be free.</p>

  <p>Cousin Edward! Cousin Edward! you should have carried her off then and
  there; she would have been truly grateful for the rest of her life, but she
  would have died sooner than open her lips. He was
  hurt&mdash;reckless&mdash;almost savage. He thought her sullen. "Once more,
  Lucy," he said, and his eye glared fiercely in the waning light&mdash;"once
  more, <i>will</i> you give me one word, or <i>never</i> set eyes on me
  again?" Her lip never moved. "I give you till we pass that tree"&mdash;he
  looked dangerous now&mdash;"and then"&mdash;he swore a great oath&mdash;"I
  leave you for ever!" Lucy thought the tree looked strange and ghastly in the
  rising moon, she even remarked a knot upon its smooth white stem; but she
  held out whilst one might have counted ten; and when she turned round, poor
  girl, Cousin Edward was gone!</p>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

  <p class="first">So the bells rung merrily at Dangerfield, and the rustics
  huzzaed for their landlord and the comely village maidens envied the bride;
  and Lucy was Lady Horsingham now, with new duties and a high position, and a
  large, fine, gloomy house, and jewels in her hair, and an aching heart in her
  bosom. Nevertheless, she determined to do her duty as a wife; and every hour
  of the day she resolved <i>not</i> to think of Cousin Edward.</p>

  <p>Years elapsed, and pretty Lucy became a gentle, handsome
  woman&mdash;kindly, courteous, and beloved by all, timid, and shrinking only
  with Sir Hugh. Her husband, wearied and discontented, mixed himself fiercely
  in all the intrigues of the day&mdash;became a staunch partisan of the House
  of Stuart, and sought for excitement abroad in proportion as he missed
  congeniality of feeling at home. It was an unhappy household. Their one child
  was the mother's sole consolation; she scarcely ever let it out of her
  presence. They were a pretty sight, that loving couple, as they basked in the
  sun of a fine summer's morning on the terrace in front of the manor-house.
  The boy, with his mother's blue eyes and his own golden curls and the arch,
  merry smile that he never got from stern Sir Hugh; and the fair, graceful
  woman, with her low, white brow and her soft brown hair and her quiet
  gestures and gentle sorrowing face&mdash;that face that haunts poor Cousin
  Edward still.</p>

  <p>"Mamma!" says the urchin, pouting his rosy lips, "why don't you play with
  me?&mdash;what are you thinking of?" and a shade passes over that kind face,
  and she blushes, though there is no one with her but the child, and catches
  him up and smothers him in kisses, and says "<i>You</i>, my darling;" but,
  nevertheless, I do not think at that moment she was thinking either of her
  boy or Sir Hugh.</p>

  <p>And where was Cousin Edward all the time? Why, at that particular instant,
  sword-point to sword-point with Colonel Bludyer of the Dragoons, slightly
  wounded in two places&mdash;cool and wary, and seeming to enjoy, with a sort
  of fierce pleasure, such a safety-valve for excitement as a duel with one of
  the best fencers in Europe.</p>

  <p>Cousin Edward was an altered man since he stood with the future Lady
  Horsingham in the moonlight. "An evil counsellor is despair;" and he had
  hugged that grim adviser to his heart. He had grown handsomer, indeed, than
  ever; but the wild eye, the haggard brow, and the deep lines about his mouth
  spoke of days spent in fierce excitement&mdash;nights passed in reckless
  dissipation. He had never forgotten Lucy through it all, but even her image
  only goaded him to fresh extravagances&mdash;anything to deaden the sting of
  remembrance&mdash;anything to efface the maddening past. So Cousin Edward too
  became a Jacobite; and was there a daring scheme to be executed, a foolhardy
  exploit to be performed&mdash;life and limb to be risked without a
  question&mdash;who so ready and so reckless as "handsome Ned Meredith"?</p>

  <p>In the course of their secret meetings and cabals he became slightly
  acquainted with Sir Hugh Horsingham; and, with the inexplicable infatuation
  peculiar to a man in love, he look a pleasure in being near one so closely
  connected with Lucy, although that one was the very person who had deprived
  him of all he valued on earth. So it fell out that Sir Hugh Horsingham and
  Ned Meredith were supping at the Rose and Thistle in close alliance, the
  table adjoining them being occupied by those staunch Hanoverians, Colonel
  Bludyer and Mr. Thornton.</p>

  <p>"Here's 'The Blackbird,'"* said Cousin Edward, tossing off a huge goblet
  of Bordeaux, and looking round the room with an air of defiance as he
  proposed so well-known a toast. Sir Hugh was a man of a certain grim humour,
  and as he drained his goblet and nodded to his companion, he added, "May the
  rats dance to his whistle, and the devil&mdash;that's <i>you</i>,
  Ned&mdash;take the hindmost!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">* One of the many passwords by which the adherents of the
  Chevalier distinguished that ill-fated Prince.</p>

  <p>Colonel Bludyer rose from his chair, placed his cocked hat on his head,
  and turned the buckle of his sword-belt in front. "The King!" he shouted,
  raising his hat with one hand and filling a bumper with the other. "The
  King!" he repeated, scowling fiercely at his two neighbours.</p>

  <p>"Over the water!" roared Ned Meredith; and the Colonel, turning rapidly
  round and mistaking his man, flung his cocked hat right in Sir Hugh
  Horsingham's face.</p>

  <p>Swords were out in a second&mdash;thrust, parry, and return passed like
  lightning, but the bystanders separated the combatants; and Meredith,
  determining for the sake of Lucy that Sir Hugh should encounter no
  unnecessary danger, took the whole quarrel on himself, and arranged a meeting
  for the following morning with the redoubtable Colonel Bludyer. Thus it was
  that while Lucy and her boy were basking in the summer sunshine, Cousin
  Edward was exhausting all his knowledge of swordsmanship in vain endeavours
  to get within that iron Colonel's guard. The duel was fought on the ground
  now occupied by Leicester Square, Sir Hugh and Mr. Thornton officiating as
  seconds, though, the latter being disabled from the effects of a recent
  encounter, they did not, as was usual in those days, fight to the death,
  merely "<i>pour se d&eacute;sennuyer</i>." Stripped to their shirts&mdash;in
  breeches and silk stockings, with no shoes&mdash;the antagonists lunged and
  glared and panted, and twice paused for breath by mutual consent, with no
  further damage than two slight wounds in Ned's sword-arm.</p>

  <p>"Very pretty practice," said Mr. Thornton, coolly taking a pinch of snuff,
  and offering his box to Sir Hugh. "I'm in despair at not being able to oblige
  you this fine morning."</p>

  <p>"Some other time," replied Sir Hugh with a grim smile; "d&mdash;ation," he
  added, "Ned's down!"</p>

  <p>Sure enough Cousin Edward was on the grass, striving in vain to raise
  himself, and gasping out that he "wasn't the least hurt." He had got it just
  between the ribs, and was trying to stanch the blood with a delicate laced
  handkerchief, in a corner of which, had he examined it closely, Sir Hugh
  would have found embroidered the well-known name of "Lucy." Poor Cousin
  Edward! it was all he had belonging to his lost love, and he would have been
  unwilling to die without that fragment of lace in his hand.</p>

  <p>"A very promising fencer," remarked Colonel Bludyer, as he wiped his
  rapier on the grass. "If he ever gets over it, he won't forget that
  "<i>plongeant</i>" thrust in tierce. I never knew it fail,
  Thornton&mdash;never, with a man under thirty." So the Colonel put his coat
  on, and drove off to breakfast; while Sir Hugh took charge of Ned Meredith,
  and as soon as he was recovered&mdash;for his wound was not
  mortal&mdash;carried him down with him to get thoroughly well at Dangerfield
  Hall.</p>

  <p>It is an old, old story. Love, outraged and set at defiance, bides his
  time, and takes his revenge. Dangerfield looked like a different place now,
  so thought Lucy; and her spirits rose, and the colour came back to her cheek,
  and she even summoned courage to speak without hesitating to Sir Hugh. When
  Cousin Edward was strong enough to limp about the house, it seemed that
  glimpses of sunshine brightened those dark oak rooms; and ere he was able to
  take the air, once more leaning on Lucy's arm, alas! alas! he had become even
  dearer to the impassioned, thoughtful woman than he ever was to the timid,
  vacillating girl. There was an addition now to the party on the terrace in
  the bright autumn mornings, but the little boy needed no longer to ask mamma
  "what she was thinking of;" and the three would have seemed to a careless
  observer a happy family party&mdash;husband, wife, and child. Oh that it
  could but have been so!</p>

  <p>In the meantime Sir Hugh was again as usual busied with his state
  intrigues and party politics, and absented himself for weeks together from
  the Hall; riding post to London night and day, returning at all sorts of
  unexpected hours, leaving again at a moment's notice, and otherwise
  comporting himself in his usual mysterious reserved manner. Yet those who
  knew him best opined there was something wrong about Sir Hugh. He was
  restless and preoccupied; his temper less easily excited about trifles than
  was his wont, but perfectly ungovernable when once he gave way to it. No man
  dared to question him. He had not a friend in the world who would have
  ventured to offer him a word of advice or consolation; but it was evident to
  his servants and his intimates that Sir Hugh was ill at ease. Who can tell
  the struggles that rent that strong, proud heart? Who could see beneath that
  cold surface, and read the intense feelings of love, hatred, jealousy, or
  revenge that smouldered below, stifled and kept down by the iron will, the
  stubborn, indomitable pride? There is a deep meaning in the legend of that
  Spartan boy who suffered the stolen fox to gnaw his very vitals, the while he
  covered him with his tunic and preserved on his brave face a smile of
  unconcern. Most of us have a stolen fox somewhere; but the weak nature
  writhes and moans, and is delivered from its torment, while the bold,
  unflinching spirit preserves a gallant bearing before the world, and scorns
  to be relieved from the fangs that are draining its very life away.</p>

  <p>Whatever Sir Hugh saw or suspected, he said not a word to Lucy, nor was it
  until surmise had become certainty that he forbade "Cousin Edward" the house.
  To him he would not condescend to explain his motives; he simply wrote to him
  to say that on his return he should expect to find that his guest had
  departed, and that he had sufficient reasons for requesting his visits might
  not be repeated. With his wife he was, if possible, more austere and morose
  than ever; so once more the Hall resumed its old aspect of cheerlessness and
  desolation, and its mistress went moping about, more than ever miserable and
  broken-hearted. Such a state of things could not long go on; the visits
  forbidden openly took place by stealth; and the climax rapidly approached
  which was to result in the celebrated Dangerfield tragedy.</p>

  <p>At this period there was set on foot another of those determined plots
  which during the first two reigns of the house of Hanover so constantly
  harassed that dynasty. Sir Hugh of course was a prime mover of the
  conspiracy, and was much in London and elsewhere gathering intelligence,
  raising funds, and making converts to his opinions. Ned Meredith, having, it
  is to be presumed, all his energies occupied in his own private intrigues,
  had somewhat withdrawn of late from the Jacobite party; and Sir Hugh heard,
  with his grim, unmoved smile, many a jest and innuendo levelled at the
  absentee.</p>

  <p>One stormy winter's evening the baronet, well armed, cloaked, and booted,
  left his own house for the metropolis, accompanied by one trusty servant. He
  was bearing papers of importance, and was hurrying on to lay them with the
  greatest dispatch before his fellow-conspirators. As night was drawing on,
  Sir Hugh's horse shied away from a wild figure, looming like some spectre in
  the fading light; and ere he had forced the animal back into the path, his
  bridle was caught by a half-naked lad, whom the rider at once recognized as
  an emissary he had often before employed to be the bearer of secret
  intelligence, and who, under an affectation of being half-witted, concealed
  much shrewdness of observation and unimpeachable fidelity to the cause.</p>

  <p>"Whip and spur, Sir Hugh&mdash;whip and spur," said the lad, who seemed
  flustered and confused with drink; "you may burst your best horse betwixt
  this and London, and all to get there before you're wanted. A dollar to
  drink, Sir Hugh, like handsome Ned gave me this morning&mdash;a dollar to
  drink, and I'll save you a journey for the sake of the 'Bonny White Rose' and
  the 'Bird with the Yellow Bill.'"</p>

  <p>Sir Hugh scrutinized the lad with a piercing eye, flung him a crown from
  his purse, and bid him "out with what he had to say, for that he himself was
  hurried, and must push on to further the good cause." The lad was sobered in
  an instant.</p>

  <p>"Look ye here, Sir Hugh," he said eagerly; "handsome Ned went down the
  road at a gallop this morning. There's something brewing in London, you may
  trust me, Sir Hugh, and I tried to stop him to learn his errand; but he
  tossed me a crown and galloped on. He took the Hill road, Sir Hugh, and you
  came up the Vale; but he's bound for Dangerfield, I know, and mayhap he's got
  papers that will save your journey to London. No offence, Sir Hugh," added
  the lad, for the baronet's face was black as midnight.</p>

  <p>"None, my good boy," was the reply in a hoarse, thick voice. "Hold,
  there's another crown for you&mdash;drink it every farthing, you villain! or
  I never give you a sixpence again;" and Sir Hugh rode on as though bound for
  London, but stopped a mile farther forward, at a place where two roads met;
  and entrusting his papers to his servant, bade him hasten on with them,
  whilst he galloped back through the darkness in the direction of his
  home.</p>

  <p>Home, indeed! Had it ever been home to Sir Hugh? Would it be home
  to-night? When he got back there, and skulked into his own house like a
  midnight thief&mdash;what would he do?&mdash;why was he galloping so fast?
  Sir Hugh set his teeth tight, and holding his powerful horse hard by the head
  urged him on faster than before. The lights are all out in the little village
  of which he is sole master, and his horse's hoofs clattering through the
  street rouse the sleepy inmates for an instant ere they return to their
  peaceful rest. Sir Hugh is not sleepy; he feels as if he never should want to
  sleep again.</p>

  <p>How dark it is in the Park under those huge old trees! He fastens his
  horse to one of the drooping branches, and after removing his pistols from
  their holsters spreads his cloak over the heaving flanks of the heated
  animal. Habit is second nature, and he does not forget the good horse. He
  strides through the shrubberies and across Lucy's garden, crushing with his
  heavy boot-heel the last flower that had lingered on into the winter. There
  is a light streaming from one of the windows in the gallery. Ha!&mdash;he
  <i>may</i> be right&mdash;he may not have returned in vain. For an instant a
  feeling of sickness comes over him, and he learns for the first time that he
  <i>had</i> cherished a hope he might be deceived.</p>

  <p>He can let himself in by the garden-gate with his own pass-key. Ere he is
  aware, he is tramping up the corridor in his heavy horseman's boots&mdash;his
  hand is on the door&mdash;there is a woman's shriek&mdash;and Sir Hugh's
  tall, dark figure fills the doorway of Lucy's sitting-room, where, alas! she
  is not alone, for the stern, angry husband is confronted by Ned Meredith!</p>

  <p>Lucy cowers down in a corner of the room with her face buried in her
  hands. Cousin Edward draws himself up to his full height, and looks his
  antagonist steadily in the face, but with an expression of calm despair that
  seems to say fate has now done her worst. Sir Hugh is cool, collected, and
  polite; nay, he can even smile, but he speaks strangely, almost in a whisper,
  and hisses through his set teeth. He has double-locked the door behind him,
  and turns to Cousin Edward with a grave, courteous bow.</p>

    <p class="caption">He double-locked the door behind him.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"You have done me the honour of an unexpected visit, Mr. Meredith," he
  says. "I trust Lady Horsingham has entertained you hospitably! Pray do not
  stir, madam. Mr. Meredith, we are now quits; you saved my life when you
  encountered Colonel Bludyer; I forbore from taking yours when I had proofs
  that it was my right. We have now entered on a fresh account, but the game
  shall be fairly played. Mr. Meredith, you are a man of honour&mdash;yes, it
  shall be fairly played." Ned's lip quivered, but he bowed and stood perfectly
  still. "Lady Horsingham," continued Sir Hugh, "be good enough to hand me
  those tables; they contain a dice-box.&mdash;Nay, Mr. Meredith," seeing Ned
  about to assist the helpless, frightened woman; "when <i>present</i>, at
  least, I expect my wife to obey me." Lucy was forced to rise, and, trembling
  in every limb, to present the tables to her lord. Sir Hugh placed the
  dice-box on the table, laid his pistols beside it, and, taking a seat,
  motioned to Cousin Edward to do the same. "You are a man of honour, Mr.
  Meredith," he repeated; "we will throw three times, and the highest caster
  shall blow the other's brains out." Lucy shrieked and rushed to the door; it
  was fast, and her husband forced her to sit down and watch the ghastly
  game.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Sir Hugh!" exclaimed Cousin Edward, "this is too
  horrible&mdash;for your wife's sake&mdash;any reparation I can make, I will;
  but this is murder, deliberate murder!"</p>

  <p>"You are a man of honour, Mr. Meredith," reiterated Sir Hugh. "I ask for
  no reparation but this&mdash;the chances are equal if the stakes are high.
  You are my guest, or rather, I should say, <i>Lady Horsingham's guest</i>.
  Begin." Cousin Edward's face turned ghastly pale. He took the box, shook it,
  hesitated; but the immovable eye was fixed on him, the stern lips repeated
  once more, "You are a man of honour," and he threw&mdash;"Four." It was now
  Sir Hugh's turn. With a courteous bow he received the box, and
  threw&mdash;"Seven." Again the adversaries cast, the one a six, the other a
  three; and now they were even in the ghastly match. Once more Cousin Edward
  shook the box, and the leaping dice turned up&mdash;"Eleven." Lucy's white
  face stood out in the lamplight, as she watched with stony eyes that seemed
  to have lost the very power of sight.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, forego this frightful determination, Sir Hugh," pleaded
  Cousin Edward; "take my life in a fair field. I will offer no resistance; but
  you can hardly expect to outdo my throw, and nothing shall induce me to take
  advantage of it. Think better of it, Sir Hugh, I entreat you."</p>

  <p>"You are a man of honour, Mr. Meredith, and so am I," was the only reply,
  as Sir Hugh brandished the box aloft, and thundered it down on the
  table&mdash;"Sixes!" "Good casting," he remarked; and at the same instant
  cocking the pistol nearest to him, discharged it full into his antagonist's
  bosom. The bullet sped through a delicate lace handkerchief, which he always
  wore there, straight and true into Cousin Edward's heart. As he fell forward
  across the table, a dark stream flowed slowly along the carpet, till it dyed
  the border of Lucy's white dress with a crimson stain. She was on her knees,
  apparently insensible; but one small hand felt the cold, wet contact, and she
  looked at it, and saw that it was blood. Once more she uttered a shriek that
  rang through those vast buildings, and rushed again to the door to find it
  locked. In sheer despair she made for the window, threw open the casement,
  and ere Sir Hugh could seize or stop her flung herself headlong into the
  court below. When the horrified husband looked down into the darkness, a wisp
  of white garments, a bruised and lifeless body, was all that remained of Lady
  Horsingham.</p>

  <p>That night one half of Dangerfield Hall was consumed by fire. Its mistress
  was said to have perished in the flames. The good neighbours, the honest
  country people, pitied poor Sir Hugh, galloping back from London, to find his
  house in ruins and his wife a corpse. His gay companions missed "Ned
  Meredith" from his usual haunts; but it was generally supposed he had
  obtained a mission to the court of St. Germains, and there was a rumour that
  he had perished in a duel with a French marquis. A certain half-witted lad,
  who had followed Sir Hugh back to Dangerfield on that fearful night, might
  have elucidated the mystery; but he had been kidnapped, and sent to the
  plantations. After many years he returned to England, and on his deathbed
  left a written statement, implicating Sir Hugh in the double crime of arson
  and murder. But long ere this the culprit had appeared before a tribunal
  which admits of no prevarication, and the pretty boy with the golden curls
  had become lord of Dangerfield Hall. The long corridor had been but partially
  destroyed. It was repaired and refurnished by successive generations; but
  guests and servants alike refused to sleep again in that dreary wing after
  the first trial. Every night, so surely as the clock tolled out the hour of
  twelve, a rush of feet was heard along the passage&mdash;a window looking
  into the court was thrown open&mdash;a piercing scream from a woman's voice
  rang through the building&mdash;and those who were bold enough to look out
  averred that they beheld a white figure leap wildly into the air and
  disappear. Some even went so far as to affirm that drops of blood, freshly
  sprinkled, were found every morning on the pavement of the court. But no one
  ever doubted the Dangerfield ghost to be the nightly apparition of Lucy, Lady
  Horsingham. At length, in my grandfather's time, certain boards being lifted
  to admit of fresh repairs in the accursed corridor, the silver-mounted guard
  of a rapier, the stock and barrel of a pistol, with a shred of lace, on which
  the letter "L" was yet visible, were discovered by the workmen. They are in
  existence still. Whatever other remains accompanied them turned to dust
  immediately on exposure to the air. That dust was, however, religiously
  collected and buried in a mausoleum appropriated to the Horsinghams. Since
  then the ghost has been less troublesome; but most of the family have seen or
  heard it at least once in their lives. I confess that if ever I lie awake at
  Dangerfield till the clock strikes twelve I invariably stop my ears and bury
  my head under the bedclothes for at least a quarter of an hour. By these
  means I have hitherto avoided any personal acquaintance with the spectre; but
  nothing on earth would induce me to walk down that corridor at midnight and
  risk a private interview with the Dangerfield ghost!</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">S for spending a whole morning in the drawing-room with the
  ladies it is what I cannot and will not submit to. Working and scandal,
  scandal and working, from half-past ten till two is more than I can stand, so
  the very first morning I was at Dangerfield I resolved to break the chain at
  once, and do as I always meant to do for the future. Accordingly, immediately
  after breakfast I popped my bonnet on&mdash;the lavender one, that had done a
  good deal of London work, but was still quite good enough for the
  country&mdash;and started off for a walk by myself, confiding my intentions
  to no one; as I well knew if I did I should have Aunt Deborah's "Kate,
  <i>pray</i> don't overheat yourself, my dear. Do wrap yourself up, and take
  care not to catch cold;" and Lady Horsingham's sarcastic smile, and "In
  <i>my</i> time, Miss Coventry, young ladies were not in the habit of trailing
  all over the country by themselves; but I expect soon to hear of their
  farming and fishing and shooting, I shouldn't wonder&mdash;not worse than
  <i>hunting</i>, at any rate. However, I say nothing;" and Cousin Amelia with
  her lackadaisical sneer, and her avowal that "she was not <i>equal</i> to
  walking," and her offer to "go as far as the garden with me in the
  afternoon." So I tripped down the back staircase and away to the stables with
  a bit of sugar for Brilliant, who had arrived safely by the train in company
  with White Stockings, and on through the kitchen-garden and the home-farm up
  to the free, fresh, breezy down.</p>

  <p>I do enjoy a walk by myself, and it was the last chance I should have of
  one; for Cousin John was expected that very day, and when Cousin John and I
  are anywhere, of course we are inseparable. But I am sure an occasional
  stroll quite by oneself does one more good than anything. I think of such
  quantities of things that never occur to me at other times&mdash;fairies,
  brigands, knights, and damsels, and all sorts of wild adventures; and I feel
  so brave and determined, as if I could face anything in a right cause, and so
  <i>good</i>, and I make such excellent resolutions, and walk faster and
  faster, and get more and more romantic, like a goose, as I know I am.</p>

  <p>Well, it was a beautiful morning, early in autumn&mdash;blue sky, light
  fleecy clouds, a sharp, clear air from the north, the low country studded
  with corn-ricks, and alive with reapers and cart-teams and cattle. A green
  valley below me, rich in fine old timber, and clothed with high, thick
  hedgerows, concealing the sluggish river that stole softly away, and only
  gleamed out here and there to light up the distance; whilst above and around
  me stretched far and wide the vast expanse of down, cutting sharply against
  the sky, and dwarfing to mere shrubs the clumps of old fir trees that
  relieved its magnificent monotony. I was deep in a daydream and an imaginary
  conversation with Frank Lovell&mdash;in which I was running over with much
  mental eloquence what <i>I</i> should say, and what <i>he</i> would say, and
  what <i>I</i> should reply to <i>that</i>&mdash;when a shrill whistle caused
  me to start and turn suddenly round; whilst at the same instant a great black
  retriever bounced up against my legs, and two handsome pointers raced by me
  as if just emancipated from the kennel. The consequence of all this was that
  I stepped hastily on a loose stone, turned my foot the wrong way under me,
  and came down with a slightly-sprained ankle, and the black retriever, an
  animal of exceedingly noisome breath, affectionately licking my face.</p>

  <p>"Down, Juno!&mdash;I beg your pardon a million times; get down, you bitch!
  How shall I ever apologize? Confound you, get down," said an agitated voice
  above me; and looking up I espied the red-haired stranger of the railway,
  dressed in a most conspicuous shooting-costume, white hat and all, whose dogs
  had been the means of bringing me thus suddenly to the earth, and on whom I
  was now dependent for succour and support till I should be able to reach
  home.</p>

  <p>In such an emergency my new friend was not half so confused and shy as I
  should have expected. He seemed to summon all his energies to consider what
  was best to be done; and as my foot pained me considerably when I tried to
  walk (particularly down hill), he made no more ado, but lifted me carefully
  in his arms, and proceeded incontinently to carry me off in the direction of
  Dangerfield Hall, where he seemed intuitively to know I was at present
  residing.</p>

  <p>It was, to say the least of it, an unusual situation. A man I had never
  seen but once before in my life&mdash;and here was I lying in his arms
  (precious weight he must have found me!) and looking up in his face like a
  child in its nurse's, and the usages of society making it incumbent on us
  both to attempt a sort of indifferent conversation about the weather and the
  country and the beauty of the scenery, which the juxtaposition of our
  respective faces rendered ludicrous in the extreme.</p>

  <p>"A tempting day for a walk, Miss&mdash;ah&mdash;ah" (he didn't know my
  name&mdash;how should he?&mdash;and was now beginning to get very red, partly
  from the return of his constitutional shyness and partly from the severity of
  his exertions). "I hope your foot does not pain you quite so much; be good
  enough to lean a little more this way." Poor man, how his arms must have
  ached! Whilst I replied somewhat in this fashion, "Thank you, I'm better; I
  shall soon be able to walk, I think; this is indeed a lovely country. Don't
  you find me very heavy?" "I think I could carry you a good many miles," he
  said quietly; and then seemed so shocked at such an avowal that he hardly
  opened his lips again, and put me down the very first time I asked him, and
  offered me his arm with an accession of confusion that made me feel quite
  awkward myself. Truth to tell, my ankle was not sprained, only
  <i>twisted</i>; and when the immediate pain wore off I was pretty sound
  again, and managed, with the assistance of my new acquaintance's arm, to make
  a very good walk of it. So we plodded on quite sociably towards the Hall, and
  my friend took leave of me at the farm with a polite bow and a sort of
  hesitating manner that most shy men possess, and which would lead one to
  infer they have always got something more to say that never is said. I knew I
  should be well scolded if I avowed my accident to any of the family; besides,
  I did not quite fancy facing all the inquiries as to how I got home, and
  Cousin Amelia's sneers about errant damsels and wandering knights; so I stole
  quietly up to my room, bathed my foot in eau-de-Cologne, and remained
  <i>perdue</i> till dinner-time, in despite of repeated messages from my
  aunts and the arrival of Cousin John.</p>

  <p>People may talk about country pleasures and country duties and all the
  charms of country life; but it appears to me that a good many things are done
  under the titles of pleasure and duty which belong in reality to neither; and
  that those who live entirely in the country inflict on themselves a great
  variety of unnecessary disagreeables, as they lose a great many of its chief
  delights. Of all receipts for weariness commend me to a dinner-party of
  country neighbours by <i>daylight</i>&mdash;people who know each other just
  well enough to have opposite interests and secret jealousies&mdash;who arrive
  ill at ease in their smart dresses, to sit through a protracted meal with hot
  servants and forced conversation, till one young lady on her promotion being
  victimized at the pianoforte enables them to yawn unobserved; and welcome ten
  o'clock brings round the carriage and tipsy coachman, in order that they may
  enter on their long, dark, dreary drive home through lanes and by-ways, which
  is only endurable from the consideration that the annual ordeal has been
  accomplished, and that they need not do it again till this time next
  year.</p>

  <p>There was a dinner-party at Dangerfield regularly once a month, and this
  was the day. Aunt Horsingham was great on these occasions, astonishing the
  neighbours as much with her London dresses as did Cousin Amelia with her
  London manners. We all assembled a few minutes earlier than usual in the
  drawing-room, so as to be ready to receive our guests, and great was the
  infliction on poor Aunt Deborah and my humble self. How they trooped in, one
  after another! Sir Brian and Lady Banneret and Master Banneret and two Misses
  Banneret; these were the great cards of the party; so Lady Horsingham kissed
  Lady Banneret and the young ladies, and opined Master Banneret was
  <i>grown</i>, much to the indignation of that young gentleman, who, being an
  Oxonian, of course considered himself <i>a man</i>. Sir Brian was a
  good-humoured jolly old boy, with a loud laugh, and stood with his coat-tails
  lifted and his back to the empty fireplace in perfect ease and contentment.
  Not so his lady; first she scrutinized everything Lady Horsingham had got on,
  then she took a review of the furniture, and specially marked one faded place
  in the carpet. Lastly, she turned a curious and disappointed glance on
  myself. I accounted for the latter mark of displeasure by the becoming shade
  of my gown; I knew it was a pretty one, and would meet with feminine censure
  accordingly. The Bannerets were soon followed by Mr. and Mrs. Plumridge, a
  newly-married couple, who were <i>f&ecirc;ted</i> accordingly. Mr. Plumridge
was a
  light-haired, unmeaning-looking individual, partially bald, with a blue coat
  and white satin neckcloth; his bride a lively, sarcastic, black-eyed little
  woman, who must have married him for her own convenience&mdash;they said
  afterwards she was once a governess; but at all events she held her own
  handsomely when alone with the ladies after dinner, and partly from
  good-humour, partly from an exceedingly off-hand natural manner, forced even
  Lady Banneret to be civil to her. Then came the Marmadukes and the Marygolds,
  and old Miss Finch in a sedan-chair from the adjoining village, and a
  goodish-looking man whose name I never made out, and Mr. Sprigges the curate;
  and lastly, in a white heat and a state of utter confusion, my shy
  acquaintance of the railway and the pointers, who was ushered in by Lady
  Horsingham's pompous butler under the style and title of Mr. Haycock. He
  appeared to be a great friend of the family; and, much to his own
  discomfiture, was immediately laid violent hands on by my aunt and
  cousin&mdash;the former not thinking it necessary to present him to me, till
  he offered me his arm to take me in to dinner, when her face of reproval, on
  his stammering out he "had met Miss Coventry before," was worth anything,
  expressive as it was of shocked propriety and puzzled astonishment.</p>

  <p>When you have a secret only known to your two selves, even with a shy man,
  it is wonderful how it brings him on. Before the soup was off the table
  Squire Haycock and I had become wonderfully good friends. He had hoped "my
  ankle did not pain me," and I had trusted "his arms did not ache." He had
  even gone the length of "vowing" that he would have shot his clumsy retriever
  for being the cause of the accident, only he let him off because "if it
  hadn't been for the dog&mdash;" and here, seeing Cousin Amelia's eye fixed
  upon us, my companion stopped dead short, and concealed his blushes in a
  glass of champagne. Taking courage from that well-iced stimulant, he reverted
  to our railway journey in company.</p>

  <p>"I knew you again this morning, Miss Coventry, I assure you, a long way
  off; in fact, I was going the other way, only, seeing you walking in that
  lonely part of the down, I feared you might be frightened" (he was getting
  bright scarlet again), "and I determined to watch you at a little distance,
  and be ready to assist you if you were alarmed by tramps or sheep-dogs
  or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I thought he was getting on too fast, so I stopped him at once by
  replying,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I am well able to take care of myself, Mr. Haycock, I assure you, and I
  like best walking <i>quite</i> alone;" after which I turned my shoulder a
  little towards him, and completely discomfited him for the rest of dinner.
  One great advantage of diffidence in a man is that one can so easily reduce
  him to the lowest depths of despondency; but then, on the other hand, he is
  apt to think one means to be more cruel than one does, and one is obliged to
  be kind in proportion to previous coldness, or the stupid creature breaks
  away altogether. When the ladies got up to leave the dining-room, I dropped
  my handkerchief well under the table, and when it was returned to me by the
  Squire, I gave him such a look of gratitude as I knew would bring him back to
  me in the evening. Nobody hates flirting so much as myself, but what is one
  to do shut up in a country-house, with no earthly thing to occupy or amuse
  one?</p>

  <p>Tea and coffee served but little to produce cordiality amongst the female
  portion of the guests after their flight to the drawing-room. Lady Horsingham
  and Lady Banneret talked apart on a sofa; they were deep in the merits of
  their respective preachers and the failings of their respective maids. Mrs.
  Marmaduke and Mrs. Marygold, having had a "Book-Club" feud, did not speak to
  each other, but communicated through the medium of Miss Finch, whose deafness
  rendered this a somewhat unsatisfactory process. Aunt Deborah went to sleep
  as usual; and I tried the two Miss Bannerets consecutively, but ascertained
  that neither would open her lips, at least in the presence of mamma. At last
  I found a vacant place by the side of Mrs. Plumridge, and discovered
  immediately, with the peculiar freemasonry which I believe men do not
  possess, that she was <i>one of my sort</i>. She liked walking, riding,
  driving, dancing&mdash;all that I liked, in short; and she hated
  scandal-gossiping, <i>sensible</i> women, morning visits, and worsted-work,
  for all of which I confess to an unqualified aversion. We were getting fast
  friends when the gentlemen came in from their wine, honest Sir Brian's voice
  sounding long before he entered the room, and the worthy gentleman himself
  rolling in with an unsteady step, partly from incipient gout, and partly, I
  fancy, from a good deal of port wine. He took a vacant seat by me almost
  immediately, chiefly, I think, because it was the nearest seat; and avowing
  openly his great regard and admiration for my neighbour, Mrs. Plumridge,
  proceeded to make himself agreeable to both of us in his own way&mdash;though
  I am concerned to state that he trod heavily on my <i>sprained</i> foot, and
  spilt the greater part of a cup of coffee over <i>her</i> satin gown. The
  Squire, whose nerves for the present were strung above blushing pitch, soon
  joined our little party; and whilst the two Miss Bannerets performed an
  endless duet on Aunt Horsingham's luckless pianoforte, and their brother,
  choking in his stiff white neckcloth, turned over the leaves, Sir Brian
  bantered Mr. Haycock gracefully on his abstemiousness after dinner, an effort
  of self-denial of which no one could accuse him, and vowed, with much
  laughter, that "Haycock must be in love! in love, Miss Coventry, don't you
  think so? A man that always used to take his two bottles as regularly as
  myself&mdash;I am a foe to excess, ladies, but Haycock's an anchorite,
  d&mdash; me&mdash;a monk! Haycock! monks mustn't marry, you
  know!&mdash;wouldn't he look well with his feet shaved, Miss Coventry, and
  his head bare and a rope round his neck?" Sir Brian was getting confused, and
  had slightly transposed the clerical costume to which he alluded; but was
  quite satisfied that his little badinage was witty and amusing in the
  extreme. Indeed, Mrs. Plumridge and I couldn't help laughing; but poor Squire
  Haycock's embarrassment was so intense that he ordered his carriage
  immediately, and took leave, venturing, however, at the very last, to shake
  me by the hand, and braving once again the banter of the inebriated
  Baronet.</p>

  <p>"Stole away," said Sir Brian; "a shy man, Miss Coventry&mdash;a shy,
  diffident man, my friend Haycock, but true as steel&mdash;not a better
  landlord in the county&mdash;excellent neighbour&mdash;useful
  magistrate&mdash;good house&mdash;beautiful garden&mdash;lots of poultry, and
  a glass beehive&mdash;wants nothing but a wife&mdash;order the carriage, my
  lady.&mdash;Mrs. Plumridge, you must come and see us at Slopperly, and don't
  forget to bring Plumridge.&mdash;Miss Coventry, you're a charming young lady;
  mind you come too." So jolly Sir Brian wished us both a most affectionate
  good-night, and, shaking Aunt Horsingham violently by both hands, packed
  himself into his carriage in a state of high good-humour and confusion. I
  have since heard that on his arrival at Slopperly he stoutly refused to get
  out, declaring that he preferred to "sit in the carriage whilst they changed
  horses," and avowing, much to his old butler's astonishment, his resolution
  to go "at least one more stage that night."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

  <p class="first">I must despair of being able in simple narrative to convey
  the remotest idea of the dullness of Dangerfield Hall; but as during my
  residence there I beguiled the weary hours by keeping a diary (bound in blue
  velvet, with brass clasps and a Bramah lock), I have it in my power, by
  transcribing a few of its pages, to present to my readers my own impressions
  of life in that well-regulated establishment. I put things down just as they
  happened, with my own reflections, more or less philosophical, on the events
  of each day. My literary labours were invariably carried on after the family
  had retired for the night; and I may observe that a loose white
  dressing-gown, trimmed with Mechlin lace and pink ribbons&mdash;one's hair,
  of course, being "taken down"&mdash;is a costume extremely well adapted to
  the efforts of composition. I take a day from the diary at random.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Up at half-past seven; peeped in the glass the
  instant I was out of bed, and wondered how Cousin Amelia looks when she
  wakes. Yellowish, I should think, and by no means captivating, particularly
  if she wears a nightcap. I don't care how ugly a woman is, she has no right
  to look anything but <i>fresh</i> in the morning; and yet how few possess
  this advantage! Nothing like open air and plenty of exercise; <i>saving</i>
  one's complexion is undoubtedly the very way to spoil it. Saw Brilliant and
  White Stockings going to exercise in the Park. What coddles they look on
  these fine autumn mornings, covered with clothing! Felt very <i>keen</i>
  about hunting; the same feeling always comes on at the fall of the leaf;
  shouldn't wonder if I could jump a gate, with my present nerves. Should like
  once in my life to <i>plant</i> a field of horsemen, and show these gentlemen
  how a woman <i>can</i> ride. Interrupted in my daydreams by Lady Horsingham's
  bell, and huddled on my things in a tremendous hurry; forced to wash my hands
  in <i>cold</i> water, which made the tips of my fingers as red as radishes
  for the rest of the day. Got down to prayers by half-past eight, and took
  Aunt Deborah her tea and toast from the breakfast-table at nine.</p>

  <p>Breakfast dull, and most of the party cross: Aunt Horsingham is generally
  out of humour at breakfast-time, particularly on Sundays. Cousin Amelia
  suggested my towels were too coarse: "they had rubbed a colour into my cheeks
  like a dairymaid's." John said I looked like a rose&mdash;a tea-rose, he
  added, as I handed him his cup. Cousin John is getting quite poetical, and
  decidedly improved since he left London. I wonder whom he got that letter
  from that was lying on his plate when he came down. I am <i>not</i> curious,
  but I just glanced at the direction, and I am certain it was in a lady's
  hand. Not that it's any business of mine; only I should think Miss Molasses
  would hardly have the face to <i>write</i> to him. I wonder whether there is
  anything between John and Miss Molasses. I asked him, half spitefully, the
  other day how he could bear to be parted from her now the season was over;
  and he seemed so pleased at my taking an interest in the thing at all that I
  had no patience to go on with my cross-questioning. I don't think she's good
  enough for John, I must confess; but he is easily imposed on by young
  ladies&mdash;as indeed, for that matter, are the rest of his great
  thick-headed sex. When breakfast was over and Cousin Amelia went off as usual
  to practise her music for an hour or two, I thought I might steal away for a
  visit to my favourites in the stable; indeed I saw John at the front door in
  a hideous wide-awake, with a long cigar in his mouth. But I was waylaid by
  Aunt Horsingham; and as these visits to the stable are strictly forbidden, I
  was obliged to follow her into the drawing-room, and resign myself for the
  whole morning to that dreadful worsted-work, more especially as it was coming
  on a drizzling mist, and there was no pretext for my usual walk.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to see you getting more sociable, Kate," said Lady Horsingham,
  in her dry, harsh voice, as I took a seat beside her and opened my
  work-basket. "It is never advisable for any young lady to affect singularity,
  and I have observed with some concern that your demeanour on many occasions
  is very unlike that of the rest of your sex."</p>

  <p>I never give in to Aunt Horsingham&mdash;after all she's not <i>my own</i>
  aunt&mdash;so I answered as pertly as ever I could:</p>

  <p>"No: you mean I don't spend the morning in looking in the glass and
  talking evil of my neighbours; I don't scream when I see a beetle, or go into
  convulsions because there's a mouse in the room. I've got two legs, very good
  legs, Aunt Horsingham&mdash;shall I show you them?&mdash;and I like to use
  them, and to be out of doors amongst the trees and the grass and the daisies,
  instead of counting stitches for work that nobody wants or writing letters
  that nobody reads. I had rather give Brilliant a good 'bucketing' (Aunt
  Horsingham shuddered; I knew she would, and used the word on purpose) over an
  open heath or a line of grass than go bodkin in a chariot, seven miles an
  hour, and both windows up. Thank you, Aunt Horsingham; you would like to make
  a fine lady of me&mdash;a useless, sickly, lackadaisical being instead of a
  healthy, active, light-hearted woman. Much obliged to you; I had rather stay
  as I am."</p>

  <p>"Miss Coventry," said my aunt, who was completely posed by my volubility,
  and apparently shocked beyond the power of expression at my
  opinions&mdash;"Miss Coventry," she repeated, "if these are indeed your
  sentiments, I must beg&mdash;nay, I must insist&mdash;on your keeping them to
  yourself whilst under <i>this</i> roof.&mdash;Amelia, my dear" (to my cousin,
  who was gliding quietly into the room)&mdash;"Amelia, go back to your music
  for ten minutes.&mdash;I must insist, Miss Coventry, that you do not
  inoculate <i>my</i> daughter with these pernicious doctrines&mdash;this
  mistaken view of the whole duties and essentials of your sex. Do you think
  <i>men</i> appreciate a woman who, if she had but a beard, would be exactly
  like one of themselves? Do you think they like to see their ideal hot and
  dishevelled, plastered with mud, and draggled with wet? Do you think they
  wish her to be strong and independent of them, and perhaps their superior at
  those very sports and exercises on which they plume themselves? Do you think
  they are to be taken by storm, and, so to speak, bullied into admiration?
  You're wrong, Kate, you're wrong; and I believe I am equally wrong to talk to
  you in this strain, inasmuch as the admiration of the other sex ought to be
  the last thing coveted or thought of by a young person of yours."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure, aunt, I don't want the men to admire me," I replied; "but I
  would not give much for the admiration of one who could be jealous of me for
  so paltry a cause as my riding better than himself; and as for ideals, I
  don't know much about such things, but I think a man's ideal may do pretty
  well what she likes, and he is sure to think everything she <i>does</i> do is
  perfect. Besides, I don't see why I should <i>bully</i> him into liking me
  because I'm fond of the beautiful 'out of doors' instead of the fireside. And
  courageous women, like courageous men, are generally a deal more gentle than
  the timid ones. I've known ladies who would not venture into a carriage or a
  boat who could wage a war of words bitterer than the veriest trooper would
  have at his command; and I've heard Cousin John say that there is scarcely an
  instance of a veritable heroine in history, from Joan of Arc downwards, who
  was not in her private life as sweet, as gentle, and as womanly as she was
  high-couraged and undaunted when the moment came that summoned her energies
  to the encounter. Unselfishness is the cause in both cases, you may depend.
  People that are always so dreadfully afraid something is going to happen to
  them think a great deal more of self than anything else; and the same cause
  which makes them tremble at imaginary danger for their own sakes will make
  them forgetful of real sufferings in which they themselves have no share. I
  had rather be a hoyden, Aunt Horsingham, and go on in my own way. I have much
  more enjoyment; and, upon my word, I don't think I'm one bit a worse member
  of society than if I was the most delicate fine lady that ever fainted away
  at the overpowering smell of a rose leaf or the merry peal of a noisy child's
  laugh."</p>

  <p>My aunt lifted up her hands and gave in, for the return of Cousin Amelia
  from the music-room effectually prevented further discussion; and we beguiled
  the time till luncheon by alternate fits of scandal and work, running through
  the characters of most of the neighbours within twenty miles, and completely
  demolishing the reputation of <i>my</i> friend, as they called
  her&mdash;lively, sarcastic little Mrs. Plumridge. John was off
  rabbit-shooting, so of course he did not appear at that meal so essential to
  ladies; and after Cousin Amelia, by way of being delicate, had got through
  two cutlets, the best part of a chicken, a plateful of rice-pudding, and a
  large glass of sherry, I ventured to propose to her that if the afternoon
  held up we should have a walk.</p>

  <p>"I'm not equal to much fatigue," said she, with a languid air and a heavy
  look about her eyes which I attributed to the luncheon; "but if you like
  we'll go to the garden and the hothouses, and be back in time for a cup of
  tea at five o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Anything to get out of the house," was my reply, and forthwith I rushed
  upstairs, two steps at a time, to put on my things; whilst my aunt whispered
  to her daughter, loud enough for me to hear, "She really ought to have been a
  man, Emmy; did you ever see such a hoyden in your life?"</p>

  <p>It was pleasant to get out even into that formal garden. The day was soft
  and misty, such as one often finds it towards the close of autumn&mdash;dark
  without being chill&mdash;and the withered leaves strewed the earth in all
  the beauty of wholesome natural decay. Autumn makes some people miserable; I
  confess it is the time of year that I like best. Spring makes me cross if
  it's bad weather, and melancholy if it's fine. Summer is very enjoyable
  certainly, but it has a luxuriance of splendour that weighs down my spirits;
  and in those glorious hot, dreamy haymaking days I seem unable to identify
  myself sufficiently with all the beauty around me, and to pine for I don't
  exactly know what. Winter is charming when it don't freeze, with its early
  candle-light and long evenings; but autumn combines everything that to me is
  most delightful&mdash;the joys of reality and the pleasures of anticipation.
  Cousin Amelia don't think so at all.</p>

  <p>"A nasty raw day, Kate," she remarked as we emerged from the hothouse into
  the moist, heavy air. "How I hate the country! except whilst the strawberries
  are ripe. Let's go back to the house, and read with our feet on the fender
  till tea-time."</p>

  <p>"Not yet, Emmy," I pleaded, for I really pined for a good walk; "let's go
  on the highroad as far as the milestone&mdash;it's market day at Muddlebury,
  and we shall see the tipsy farmers riding home and the carriers' carts with
  their queer-looking loads; besides, think what a colour you'll have for
  dinner. Come on, there's a dear!"</p>

  <p>The last argument was unanswerable; and Cousin Amelia putting her best
  foot foremost, we soon cleared the garden and the approach, and emerged on
  the highroad three miles from Muddlebury, and well out of the sight of the
  windows of Dangerfield Hall. As we rose the hill, on the top of which is
  perched the well-known milestone, and my cousin began already to complain of
  fatigue, the sound of hoofs behind us caused us both to stop and look
  round.</p>

  <p>"It's cavalry," said Amelia, who jumps rather rapidly to conclusions, and
  is no judge of a horse.</p>

  <p>"It's a stud," was my reply; "somebody coming to hunt with 'the
  Heavy-top.' Let's stand in this gateway and see them pass." We took up a
  position accordingly; and if I felt keen about the commencement of the season
  previously, how much more so did I become to watch the string of gallant
  well-bred horses now jogging quietly towards us with all the paraphernalia
  and accessories of the chase!</p>

  <p>Two, four, six, and a hack, all clothed and hooded, and packed for
  travelling. Such a chestnut in the van, with a minute boy on him, who cannot
  have weighed four stone; strong, flat, sinewy legs (the chestnut's, not the
  boy's), hocks and thighs clean, full, and muscular as Brilliant's, only twice
  the size; a long, square tail, and a wicked eye. How I <i>should</i> like to
  ride that chestnut! Then a brown and two bays, one of the latter scarcely big
  enough for a hunter, to my fancy, but apparently as thoroughbred as Eclipse;
  then a gray, who seemed to have a strong objection to being led, and who held
  back and dragged at his rein in a most provoking manner; and lastly, by the
  side of a brown hack that I fancied I had seen before, a beautiful black
  horse, the very impersonation of strength, symmetry, courage, speed, and all
  that a horse should be.</p>

  <p>"Ask the groom whose they are," whispered Amelia as he went by. "I don't
  quite like to speak to him; he looks an impudent fellow with those dark
  whiskers."</p>

  <p>I should like to see the whiskers that would frighten <i>me</i>; so I
  stepped boldly out into the road, and accosted him at once.</p>

  <p>"Whose horses are those, my man?" I asked, with my most commanding
  air.</p>

  <p>"Captain Lovell's, miss," was the reply. My heart jumped into my mouth,
  and you might have knocked me down with a feather.</p>

  <p>"Captain Lovell's!" exclaimed Amelia; "why, that's your old flirt, Kate. I
  see it all now." But I hardly heard her, and when I looked up the horses were
  a mile off, and we were retracing our steps towards Dangerfield Hall.</p>

  <p>What a happy day this has been, and how unpromising was its beginning! And
  yet I don't know why I should have been so happy. After all, there is nothing
  extraordinary in Captain Lovell's sending down a stud of horses to hunt with
  so favourite a pack as "the Heavy-top" hounds. I wish I had summoned courage
  to ask the man when his master was coming and where he was going to stay; but
  I really couldn't do it&mdash;no, not if my life depended on it. All the way
  home Cousin Amelia laughed and sneered and chattered, and once she
  acknowledged I was "the best-tempered girl in the world;" but I am sure I
  have not an idea why I deserve this character. Her words fell perfectly
  unheeded on my ear. I was glad to get to the solitude of my own room, when it
  was time to dress for dinner, that I might have the luxury, if it was only
  for five minutes, of <i>thinking</i> undisturbed. But there was Aunt Deborah
  to be attended to; for poor Aunt Deborah, I am sorry to say, is by no means
  well. And Gertrude came in "to do my hair;" and then the dinner-bell rang,
  and the wearisome meal, and the long evening dragged on in their accustomed
  monotony. But I did not find it as dull as usual, though I was more rejoiced
  than ever when the hand-candles came and we were dismissed to go to bed.</p>

  <p>And now they are all fast asleep, and I can sit at my open window and
  think, think, think as much as I like. What a lovely night it is! The mist
  has cleared off, and the moat is glistening in the moonlight, and the old
  trees are silvered over and blackened alternately by its beams; the church
  tower stands out massively against the sky. How dark the old belfry looks on
  such a night as this, contrasting with the white tombstones in the
  churchyard, and the slated roof shimmering above the aisle! There is a faint
  breeze sighing amongst the few remaining leaves, now rising into a pleading
  whisper, now dying away with a sad, unearthly moan. The deer are moving
  restlessly about the Park, now standing out in bold relief on some open space
  brightened by the moonlight, now flitting like spectres athwart the shade.
  Everything breathes of romance and illusion; and I do believe it is very bad
  for one to be watching here, dreaming wide awake, instead of snoring
  healthily in bed. I wonder what he is about at this moment. Perhaps smoking a
  cigar out of doors, and enjoying this beautiful night. I wonder what he is
  thinking of. Perhaps, after all, he's stewed up in some lamplit drawing-room
  talking nonsense to Lady Scapegrace and Mrs. Lumley, or playing that odious
  whist at his club. Well, I suppose I may as well go to bed. One more look
  into the night, and then&mdash;hark! what is it? how beautiful, how charming!
  Distant music from the wood at the low end of the Park. The deer are all
  listening, and now they troop down towards the noise in scores. How softly it
  dies away and rises again! 'Tis a cornet-&agrave;-piston, I think, and
though not
  very skilfully played it sounds heavenly by moonlight. I never thought that
  old air of "You'll Remember Me" half so beautiful before. Who can it be? I
  have never heard it since I came here. It can't be Captain Lovell's groom;
  it's not quite impossible it might be Captain Lovell himself. Ah, if I
  thought that! Well, it has ceased now. I may as well go to bed. What a happy
  day this has been, and what dreams I shall have!</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

  <p class="first"><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;This has been an eventful day. I
  thought somehow it would be so; at all events, the first day's hunting is
  always an era to me&mdash;so when I came down to breakfast in my
  riding-habit, and braved the cold glances of my aunt and the sarcasms of my
  cousin, I was prepared for a certain amount of excitement, although, I
  confess, I did not bargain for quite so much as I got.</p>

  <p>"You'll enjoy yourself to-day, I trust, Miss Coventry," said Aunt
  Horsingham, looking as black as thunder.</p>

  <p>"Mind you don't get a fall," observed Cousin Amelia with a sneer; but I
  cared little for their remarks and remonstrances. White Stockings was at the
  door, Cousin John ready to lift me into my saddle, and I envied no mortal
  woman on earth, no not our gracious Queen upon the throne, when I found
  myself fairly mounted, and jogging gently down the park in all the delightful
  anticipation of a good day's sport. I think I would rather have ridden
  Brilliant of the two, but John suggested that the country was cramped and
  sticky, with small fields and blind fences. Now, White Stockings is an animal
  of great circumspection, and allows no earthly consideration to hurry him. He
  is, moreover, as strong as a dray-horse, and as handy, so John declares, "as
  a fiddle." To him, therefore, was entrusted the honour of carrying me on my
  first appearance with the Heavy-top hounds. The meet was at no great distance
  from Dangerfield Hall, and being the beginning of the season, and a favourite
  place, there was a considerable muster of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the
county, and
  a goodly show of very respectable horses to grace the covert side. As we rode
  up to the mounted assemblage, I perceived, by the glance of curiosity, not to
  say admiration, directed at myself and White Stockings, that ladies were
  unusual visitors in that field, and that the Heavy-top gentlemen were not
  prepared to be cut <i>down</i>, at all events by <i>a woman</i>. Cousin John
  seems to know them all and to be a universal favourite.</p>

  <p>"Who's the lady, John, my boy?" whispered a fat squire in a purple
  garment, with a face to match; "good seat on a horse, eh? rides like a bird,
  I'll warrant her." I did not catch John's answer; but the corpulent sportsman
  nodded, and smiled, and winked, and wheezed out, "Lucky dog&mdash;pretty
  cousin&mdash;double harness."</p>

  <p>I don't know what he meant; but that it was something intensely ludicrous
  I gather from his nearly choking with laughter at his own concluding
  observation, though John blushed and looked rather like a fool.</p>

  <p>"Who's that girl on the chestnut?" I again heard asked by a slang-looking
  man with red whiskers meeting under his chin; "looks like a larker&mdash;I
  must get introduced to her," added the conceited brute. How I hated him! If
  he had ventured to speak to me, I really think I could have struck him over
  the face with my riding-whip.</p>

  <p>"I told you it would not be long before we met, Miss Coventry," said a
  well-known voice beside me; and turning round, I shook hands with Captain
  Lovell; and I am ashamed to confess, shook all over into the bargain. I am
  always a little nervous the first day of the season. How well he looked in
  his red coat and neat appointments, with his graceful seat upon a horse, and
  so high-bred, amongst all the country squires and jolly yeomen that
  surrounded us! He had more colour too than when in London, and altogether I
  thought I had never seen him looking so handsome. The chestnut with the
  wicked eye, showing off his fine shape, now divested of clothing, curvetted
  and bent to his rider's hand as if he thoroughly enjoyed that light
  restraining touch: the pair looked what the gentlemen call "all over like
  going," and I am sure one of them thought so too.</p>

  <p>"I saw your horses on their way to Muddlebury yesterday," I at length
  found courage to say. "Are you going to hunt all the season with the
  Heavy-top?"</p>

  <p>"How long do you stay at Dangerfield?" was the counter question from
  Frank; "you see I know the name of the place already; I believe I could find
  my way now about the Park; very picturesque it is too by night, Miss
  Coventry. Do you like music by moonlight?"</p>

  <p>"Not if it's played out of tune," I answered with a laugh and a blush; but
  just then Squire Haycock, whom I scarcely knew in his hunting costume, rode
  up to us, and begged as a personal favour to himself that we would accompany
  him to a particular point, from which he could ensure us a good start if the
  fox went away&mdash;his face becoming scarlet as he expressed a hope "Miss
  Coventry would not allow her fondness for the chase to lead her into
  unnecessary danger;" whilst Frank looked at him with a half-amused,
  half-puzzled expression that seemed to say, "What a queer creature you are;
  and what the deuce can that matter to you?"</p>

  <p>I wonder why people always want to oblige you when you don't want to be
  obliged; "too civil by half" is much more in the way than "not half civil
  enough." So we rode on with Squire Haycock, and took up a position at the end
  of the wood that commanded a view of the whole proceedings, and, as Frank
  whispered to me, was "the likeliest place in the world if we wanted to head
  the fox."</p>

  <p>The Heavy-top hounds are an establishment such as, I am given to
  understand, is not usually kept in Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, and
  other so-called "flying counties." I like to gain all the information I
  can&mdash;Cousin John calls this thirst for knowledge, "female
  curiosity"&mdash;and gather from him that the Heavy-top consists of
  twenty-two couples of hunting hounds, and that the whole twenty-two come out
  three times a week during the season. I don't see why they shouldn't, I'm
  sure; they look very fat, and remind me of the otter hounds poor Uncle Horace
  used to keep when I was a child. He (that's my oracle, Cousin John) further
  adds that they are remarkably "steady"&mdash;which is more than can be said
  of their huntsman, who is constantly drunk&mdash;and that they consume a vast
  quantity of "flesh," which, far from being a meritorious, appears to me a
  disgusting tendency. They are capital "line-hunters," so says John; a
  "line-hunter," I imagine, is a hound that keeps snuffing about under the
  horses' feet, and must be a most useful auxiliary, when, as is often the
  case, the sportsmen are standing on the identical spot where the fox has
  crossed. He considers them a very "killing" pack, not in manners or
  appearance certainly, but in perseverance and undying determination. Their
  huntsman is what is called "one of the old sort." If this is a correct
  description, I can only say that "the old sort" must have worn the brownest
  and shabbiest of boots, the oldest of coats, and the greasiest of caps; must
  have smelt of brandy on all occasions, and lived in a besotted state of
  general confusion, vibrating between "delirium audacious" and "delirium
  tremens." They have, however, a certain whip called "Will," who appears to me
  to do all the work, and to keep everything right. When old Tippler drinks
  himself to death (a casualty which must shortly happen), Will is pretty sure
  to succeed him&mdash;an event which I fancy will greatly add to the
  efficiency of the Heavy-top hounds. To crown all, Frank Lovell dubs the whole
  thing "slow;" but I have remarked gentlemen make use of this epithet to
  convey their disapproval of that which they cannot find any positive fault
  with&mdash;just as we ladies call a woman "bad style" when we have nothing
  else to say in her disparagement.</p>

  <p>"Gone away!" exclaims Squire Haycock, lifting his cap high above his red
  head; "yonder he goes! Don't you see him, Miss Coventry, now whisking under
  the gate?"</p>

  <p>"Forward, forward!" holloas Frank, giving vent to his excitement in one of
  those prolonged screams that proclaim how the astonished sportsman has
  actually seen the fox with his own eyes. The next instant he is through the
  hand-gate at the end of the ride, and rising in his stirrups, with the wicked
  chestnut held hard by the head, is speeding away over the adjoining pasture,
  alongside of the two or three couples of leading hounds that have just
  emerged from the covert. Ah! we are all forgotten now; women, children,
  everything is lost in that first delirious five minutes when the hounds are
  really away. Frank was gazing at me a minute ago as if his very life was at
  my disposal, and now he is speeding away a field ahead of me, and don't care
  whether I break my neck following him or not. But this is no time for such
  thoughts as these; the drunken huntsman is sounding his horn in our rear.
  Will, the whip, cap in hand, is bringing up the body of the pack. Squire
  Haycock holds the gate open for me to pass, Cousin John goes by me like a
  flash of lightning; White Stockings with a loose rein, submits to be kicked
  along at any pace I like to ask him. The fence at the end of the field is
  nothing; I shall go exactly where Frank did. My blood thrills with ecstasy in
  my veins: moment of moments! I have got a capital start, and we are in for a
  run.</p>

  <p>As I sit here in my armchair and dressing-gown, I see the whole panorama
  of to-day passing once more before my eyes. I see that dark, wet, ploughed
  field, with the white hounds slipping noiselessly over its furrowed surface.
  I can almost perceive the fresh, wholesome smell of the newly-turned earth. I
  see the ragged, overgrown, straggling fence at the far end, glistening with
  morning dew, and green with formidable briers. I see Frank Lovell's chestnut
  rising at the weakest place, the rider sitting well back, his spurs and
  stirrup-irons shining in the sun; I see Squire Haycock's square scarlet back,
  as he diverges to a well-known corner for some friendly egress; I hear Cousin
  John's voice shouting, "Give him his head, Kate!" As White Stockings and I
  rapidly approach the leap, my horse relapses of his own accord into a trot,
  points his small ears, crashes into the very middle of the fence, and just as
  I give myself up for lost, makes a second bound that settles me once more in
  the saddle, and lands gallantly in the adjoining field, Frank looking back
  over his shoulder in evident anxiety and admiration, whilst John's cheery
  voice, with its "Bravo, Kate!" rings in my delighted ears. We three are now
  nearest the hounds, a long strip of rushy meadow-land before us, the pack
  streaming along the side of a high, thick hedge that bounds it on our left;
  the south wind fans my face and lifts my hair as I slacken my horse's rein
  and urge him to his speed. I am alongside of Frank. I could ride anywhere
  now, or do anything. I pass him with a smile and a jest. I am the foremost
  with the chase. What is ten years of common life, one's feet upon the fender,
  compared to five such golden minutes as these? The hounds stop suddenly, and
  after scattering and spreading themselves into the form of an open fan, look
  up in my face with an air of mute bewilderment. The huntsman and the field
  come up, the gentlemen in a high state of delight and confusion; but Mr.
  Tippler in the worst of humours, and muttering as he trots off to a corner of
  the meadow with the pack about his horse's heels,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Rode 'em slap off the scent&mdash;drove 'em to a check&mdash;wish she was
  at home and abed and asleep, and be d&mdash;d to her!"</p>

  <p>A grim old lady who has but one eye, and answers to the name of "Jezebel,"
  has threaded the fence, and proclaims in anything but a sweet voice to her
  comrades, that she has discovered the line of our fox. They join her in an
  instant, down go their heads in concert, and away we all speed again, through
  an open gate, across a wide common, into a strip of plantation, over a stile
  and foot-board that leads out of it, and I find myself once more following
  Captain Lovell with Cousin John alongside of me, and all the rest far, far
  behind. This is indeed glorious. I should like it to go on till dinnertime.
  How I hope we shan't kill the fox!</p>

  <p>"Take hold of his head, Kate," says my cousin, whose horse has just
  blundered on to his nose through a gap. "Even White Stockings won't last for
  ever, and this is going to be something out of the common."</p>

  <p>"Forward!" is my reply as I point with my whip towards the lessening pack,
  now a whole field ahead of us. "Forward!" If we hadn't been going such a pace
  I could have sung for joy.</p>

  <p>There is a line of pollarded willow trees down in that hollow, and the
  hounds have already left these behind them; they are rising the opposite
  ground. Again Frank Lovell looks anxiously back at me, but makes no sign.</p>

  <p>"We <i>must</i> have it, Kate!" says John; "there's your best place, under
  the tree; send him at it as hard as he can lay legs to the ground."</p>

  <p>I ply my whip and loosen my reins in vain. White Stockings stops dead
  short, and lowers his nose to the water, as if he wanted to drink; all of a
  sudden the stream is behind me, and with a flounder and a struggle we are
  safe over the brook. Not so Cousin John; I see him on his legs on the bank,
  with his horse's head lying helplessly between his feet, the rest of that
  valuable animal being completely submerged.</p>

  <p>"Go along, Kate!" he shouts encouragingly, and again I speed after Frank
  Lovell, who is by this time nearly a quarter of a mile ahead of me, and at
  least that distance behind the hounds. White Stockings is going very
  pleasantly, but the ground is now entirely on the rise, and he indulges
  occasionally in a trot without any hint on my part; the fences fortunately
  get weaker and weaker; the fields are covered with stones, and are light,
  good galloping enough, but the rise gets steeper every yard; round hills are
  closing in about us; we are now on the Downs, and the pack is still fleeting
  ahead, like a body of hounds in a dream, every moment increasing their
  distance from us, and making them more and more indistinct. Frank Lovell
  disappears over the brow of that hill, and I urge White Stockings to overtake
  my only companion. He don't seem to go much faster for all that. I strike him
  once or twice with my light riding-whip; I shake my reins, and he comes back
  into a trot; I rise in my stirrup and rouse his energies in every way I can
  think of. I am afraid he must be ill, the trot degenerates to a jog, a walk;
  he carries his head further out from him than is his wont, and treats curb
  and snaffle with a like disregard and callousness of mouth. Now he stops
  altogether, and catching a side view of his head his eye appears to me more
  prominent than usual, and the whole animal seems changed, till I can hardly
  fancy it is my own horse. I get a little frightened now, and look round for
  assistance. I am quite alone. Hounds, horsemen, all have disappeared; the
  wide, dreary, solitary Downs stretch around me, and I begin to have
  misgivings as to how I am to get back to Dangerfield Hall. Cousin John has
  explained it all to me since.</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be simpler, Kate," said he this evening when I handed him
  his tea; "you <i>stopped your horse</i>. If ladies <i>will</i> go in front
  with a loose rein for five-and-forty minutes, 'riding jealous' of such a
  first-rate performer as Frank Lovell, it is not an unlikely thing to happen.
  If you could have lasted ten minutes longer, you would have seen them kill
  their fox. Frank was the only one there, but he assures me he could not have
  gone another hundred yards. Never mind, Kate, better luck next time!"</p>

  <p>Well, to return to my day. After a while White Stockings began to recover
  himself. I'm sure I didn't know what to do with him. I got off, and loosened
  his girths as well as I could, and turned his head to the wind, and wiped his
  poor nose with my pocket-handkerchief. I hadn't any eau-de-Cologne, and if I
  had it might not have done him much good. At last he got better, and I got on
  again (all my life I've been used to mounting and dismounting without
  assistance). Thinking downhill must be the way home, downhill I turned him,
  and proceeded slowly on, now running over in my own mind the glorious hour I
  had just spent, now wondering whether I should be lost and have to sleep
  amongst the Downs; and anon coming back to the old subject, and resolving
  that hunting was the only thing to live for, and that for the future I would
  devote my whole time and energies to that pursuit. At last I got into a steep
  chalky lane, and at a turn a little farther on espied to my great relief a
  red-coated back jogging leisurely home. White Stockings pricked his ears and
  mended his pace, so I soon overtook the returning sportsman, who proved to be
  no other than Squire Haycock, thrown out like the rest of the Heavy-top
  gentlemen, and only too happy to take care of me, and show me the shortest
  way (eleven miles as the crow flies) back to Dangerfield Hall.</p>

  <p>We jogged on amicably enough, the Squire complimenting me much on my
  prowess, and not half so shy as usual&mdash;very often the case with a
  diffident man when on horseback. We were forced to go very slow, both our
  horses being pretty well tired; and to make matters better, we were caught in
  a tremendous hailstorm about two miles from home, just as it was getting
  dark, and close to the spot where our respective roads diverged. I could not
  possibly miss mine, as it was perfectly straight. Ah! that hailstorm has a
  deal to answer for. We were forced to turn through a hand-gate, and take
  shelter in a friendly wood. What a ridiculous position, pitch dark, pelting
  with rain, an elderly gentleman and a young lady on horseback under a fir
  tree. The Squire had been getting more incoherent for some time; I couldn't
  think what he was driving at.</p>

  <p>"You like our country, Miss Coventry; fine climate, excellent soil, nice
  and dry for ladies?"</p>

  <p>I willingly subscribed to all these advantages.</p>

  <p>"Good neighbourhood," added the Squire; "capital hunting, charming rides,
  wonderful scenery for sketching. Do you think you could live in this part of
  the world?"</p>

  <p>I thought I could if I was to try.</p>

  <p>"You expressed your approbation of my house, Miss Coventry," the Squire
  proceeded, with his hand on my horse's neck; "do you think&mdash;I
  mean&mdash;should you consider&mdash;or rather I should say, is there any
  alteration you would suggest&mdash;anything in my power&mdash;if you would
  condescend to ride over any afternoon; may I consider you will so far favour
  me?"</p>

  <p>I said "I should be delighted, but that it had left off raining, and it
  was time for us to get home."</p>

  <p>"One word, Miss Coventry," pleaded the Squire with a shaking voice. "Have
  I your permission to call upon Lady Horsingham to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>I said I thought my aunt would be at home, and expressed my conviction
  that she would be delighted to see him, and I wished him good-bye.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Miss Coventry, good-bye," said the Squire, shaking hands with a
  squeeze that crushed my favourite ring into my prettiest finger; "you have
  made me <i>the happiest of men</i>&mdash;good-bye!"</p>

  <p>I saw it all in an instant, just as I see it now. The Squire means to
  propose for me to-morrow, and he thinks I have accepted him. What
  <i>shall</i> I do? <i>Mrs. Haycock</i>&mdash;Kate Haycock&mdash;Catherine
  Haycock. No, I can't make it look well, write it how I will; and then, to vow
  never to think of any one else; I suppose I mightn't even <i>speak</i> to
  Frank. Never, no, never; but what a scrape I have got into, and how I wish
  to-morrow was over!</p>

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">Y diary continued,&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Well, it is over at last; and upon my word I begin
  to think I am capable of anything after all I have got through to-day since
  breakfast. Scarcely had I finished the slice of toast and single cup of tea
  that constitute my morning meal, before I heard the tramp of a horse on the
  gravel in front of the house, followed by the ominous sound of the door-bell.
  I have remarked that in all country families a ring at the door-bell brings
  everybody's heart into everybody's mouth. Aunt Horsingham, brooding over the
  teapot as usual, had been in her worst of humours ever since she came down,
  and tried to look as if no bell that ever was cast had power to move her grim
  resolve.</p>

  <p>"A message by electric telegraph," exclaimed Cousin Amelia, who is always
  anticipating some catastrophe; "no visitor would ever call at such a
  time."</p>

  <p>"Unless he came to propose for one of us," suggested John, who was carving
  a ham at the side-table.</p>

  <p>"Some one on business for <i>me</i>, probably," remarked Aunt Horsingham,
  drawing herself up and looking more stately than usual.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Haycock!" announced the butler, throwing open the door with a
  flourish; and while all our untimely visitor's preparations, such as wiping
  his shoes, arranging his dress, etc., were distinctly audible outside, we
  looked at each other in mute astonishment, and I own I <i>did</i> feel the
  guilty one amongst the party.</p>

  <p>The Squire made his entrance in a state of intense trepidation. Having
  been forcibly deprived of his white hat in the hall, he had nothing but
  natural means to resort to for concealment of his confusion. Had it not been
  for an enormous silk handkerchief (white spots on a yellow ground) with which
  he blew his nose and wiped his brow at short and startling intervals his
  condition would have been pitiable in the extreme. The "Squire's" dress too
  was of a more florid style than is usual in these days of sad-coloured
  attire. A bright blue neckcloth, well starched, and of great depth and
  volume; a buff waistcoat, with massive gilt buttons; a grass-green
  riding-coat of peculiar shape and somewhat scanty material; white cord
  trousers, York tan gaiters, and enormous double-soled shooting-shoes, pierced
  and strapped, and clamped and hobnailed, completing a <i>tout ensemble</i>
  that almost upset my aunt's gravity, and made me, nervous as I felt, stuff my
  pocket-handkerchief into my mouth that I might not laugh outright.</p>

  <p>"Fine morning, Lady Horsingham," observed the Squire, as if he had come
  all that distance at this early hour on purpose to impart so valuable a piece
  of information&mdash;"fine morning, but cold," he repeated, rubbing his hands
  together though the perspiration stood on his brow. "I don't recollect a much
  finer morning at this time of year," he resumed, addressing Cousin John after
  a pause, during which he had ceremoniously shaken hands with each of us in
  succession.</p>

  <p>"Will you have some breakfast?" asked Lady Horsingham, whose cold and
  formal demeanour contrasted strangely with the nervous excitement of her
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you&mdash;if you please," answered the Squire in a breath. "I
  breakfasted before I left home. Early hours, Lady Horsingham&mdash;I think
  your ladyship approves of early hours&mdash;but I'll ask for a cup of tea, if
  you please." So he sat down to a weak cup of lukewarm tea with much assumed
  gusto and satisfaction.</p>

  <p>It was now time for Cousin Amelia to turn her battery on the Squire; so
  she presently attacked him about his poultry and his garden and his farm, the
  honest gentleman's absent and inconsequent replies causing my aunt and John
  to regard him with silent astonishment, as one who was rapidly taking leave
  of his senses; whilst I who knew, or at least guessed, the cause of his
  extraordinary behaviour began heartily to wish myself back in Lowndes Street,
  and to wonder how this absurd scene was going to end.</p>

  <p>"Your dahlias must have suffered dreadfully from these early frosts," said
  Cousin Amelia, shaking her ringlets at the poor man in what she fancies her
  most bewitching style.</p>

  <p>"Beautifully," was the bewildered reply, "particularly the
  shorthorns."</p>

  <p>"You never sent us over the Alderney calf you promised, Mr. Haycock,"
  pursued the lady, now adroitly changing her ground. "I begin to think you are
  not to be depended on."</p>

  <p>"You do me injustice, Miss Horsingham; indeed you do," broke out the
  Squire in a white heat and with a deprecating glance at me. "I assure you I
  sent over a very fine cutting, with a pot and everything, directions for
  matting it in winter and transplanting after a year. If you never got it I'll
  discharge my gardener; I will, upon my word."</p>

  <p>"I have got such a Cochin China to show you," persisted his tormentor,
  determined to renew the charge. "When you've finished breakfast I'll take you
  to the poultry-yard if you like."</p>

  <p>"Delighted," replied the Squire, looking ruefully around him as if he
  meditated instant flight&mdash;"delighted, I'm sure; but they haven't
  flowered well this year. I'll teach you how to bud them if you like; but
  you're aware, Miss Horsingham, that they've no smell."</p>

  <p>John could stand it no longer, and was forced to bolt out of the room. My
  aunt too rose from the table with something approaching a smile; and the
  Squire, screwing his courage to the sticking-place, was following her into
  the drawing-room, evidently for a private interview, when Cousin Amelia, who
  seemed to have made up her mind to take bodily possession of him, hurried the
  visitor off to the billiard-room, there to engage in a match which would
  probably last till luncheon-time. I never saw anything so hopeless as the
  expression of the victim's countenance whilst suffering himself to be thus
  led into captivity. He did summon courage to entreat "Miss Coventry to come
  and mark"&mdash;a favour which, notwithstanding my cousin's black looks, I
  really had not the heart to refuse him.</p>

  <p>Game after game they played, the gentleman apparently abandoning himself
  to his fate. Sprawling over the table, making the most ridiculous blunders in
  counting, missing the most palpable of cannons, and failing to effect the
  easiest of hazards; the lady brandishing her mace in the most becoming
  attitudes, drooping her long hair over the cushions, and displaying the
  whiteness of her hand and slender symmetry of her fingers, as she requested
  her astonished adversary to teach her "how to make a bridge," or "pocket the
  red," or "screw it off the white," and lisped out "how hard it was to be
  disappointed by that provoking kiss!" The Squire made one or two futile
  attempts to engage me in a game, but Cousin Amelia was determined to have him
  all to herself; and as it was getting near the time at which I take Aunt
  Deborah her broth&mdash;for poor Aunt Deborah, I am sorry to say, is very ill
  in bed&mdash;I made my escape, and as I ran upstairs heard the billiard-room
  bell ring, and Squire Haycock summon up courage to "know if Lady Horsingham
  was at leisure, as he wished to see her for five minutes alone in the
  drawing-room."</p>

  <p>People may say what they like about superstition and credulity and old
  women's tales, but I <i>have</i> faith in presentiments. Didn't I get up from
  my work and walk to the window at least a dozen times to watch for Cousin
  John coming home that wet day two years ago when he broke his leg with the
  harriers, and yet he had only gone out for a morning's canter on the best
  horse he ever had in his life? Didn't I feel for eight-and-forty hours as if
  something too delightful was going to happen to me the week that Brilliant
  was bought and sent home, looking like an angel in a horse's skin? That
  reminds me I never go to see him now; I hope I am not inconstant to my old
  friends. And what was it but a presentiment that made my heart beat and my
  knees knock together when I entered my own room to-day before luncheon and
  saw a brown paper parcel on the table, addressed, evidently by the shop
  people, to "Miss Coventry, Dangerfield Hall"? How my fingers trembled as I
  untied the thread and unfolded the paper; after all, it was nothing but a
  packet of worsteds! To be sure, I hadn't ordered any worsteds, but there
  might possibly be a note to explain; so I shook every skein carefully, and
  turned the covering inside out, that the document, if there should be one,
  might not escape my vigilance. How could my presentiments deceive me? Of
  course there was a note&mdash;after all, where was the harm? Captain Lovell
  had most politely sent me all these worsteds for a cushion I had once talked
  about working, and very naturally had enclosed a note to say so; and nothing
  to my mind could be kinder or more welcome than the contents. I am not going
  to say what they are, of course; though for that matter I easily could, since
  I have got the note by me at this moment, and have read it over to-day
  besides more than once. After all, there is nothing like a letter. Who does
  not remember the first letter received in one's childish days, written in a
  fair round text for childish eyes, or perhaps even <i>printed</i> by the kind
  and painstaking correspondent for the little dunce of a recipient. Who has
  not slept with such a letter carefully hoarded away under the pillow, that
  morning's first light might give positive assurance of the actual existence
  of our treasure. Nor is the little urchin the only glad supporter of our
  admirable postal institutions. Manly eyes moisten with tears of joy over
  those faint delicate lines traced by <i>her</i> hand whose gentle influence
  has found the <i>one</i> soft place. Woman hides away in her bosom, close to
  her loving heart, the precious scrap which assures her, visibly, tangibly,
  unerringly, that he is hers and hers alone. Words may deceive, scenes of
  bliss pass away like a dream. Though ever present to the mind it requires an
  effort to disentangle the realities of memory from the illusions of
  imagination; but a letter is proof positive; there it is in black and white.
  You may read it again and again; you may kiss it as often as you please; you
  may prize it and study it and pore over it, and find a new meaning in every
  fresh perusal, a hidden interpretation for every magic word. Nothing can
  unsay it, nothing can deprive you of it; only don't forget to lock it up
  carefully, and mind you don't go leaving about your keys.</p>

  <p>I had hardly read my note over a second time before Cousin Amelia bounced
  into the room without knocking. I should have locked the door had I known she
  was coming; as it was, I had only time to pop the note into my dress (the
  seal made a great scratch just below my neck) before she was upon me, and
  throwing herself into my arms with a most unusual excess of affections
  exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Give me joy, Kate&mdash;give me joy&mdash;he's gone to mamma&mdash;he's
  in the drawing-room with her now&mdash;O Kate, what shall I do?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Amelia," I exclaimed, as the delightful thought flashed across me
  that, after all, the Squire's visit might have been for my cousin, though I
  must say I wondered at his taste, "am I to congratulate you on being Mrs.
  Haycock? I do indeed from my heart. I am sure he is an excellent, amiable
  man, and will make you a capital husband."</p>

  <p>"That he will!" exclaimed Cousin Amelia; "and such a nice place and
  gardens, and a very good fortune too. Upon my word, Kate, I begin to think
  I'm a lucky girl, though to be sure with my advantages I might expect to make
  a good match. He's not so old, Kate, after all; at least not so old as he
  looks; and he's very good-tempered, I know, because his servants say so. I
  shall alter that tumble-down house of his, and new-furnish the drawing-room.
  Of course he'll take me to London for two or three months every year in the
  season. I wonder if he knows about Mr. Johnson&mdash;not that I ever
  <i>cared</i> for <i>him</i>&mdash;and, of course, a poor curate like that one
  couldn't think of it. Do you know, Kate, I thought his manner was very
  <i>odd</i> the other day when he dined here; though he sat next <i>you</i> he
  kept looking at <i>me</i>, and I remarked once that he coloured up, oh! so
  red. Poor fellow, I see it all now. Kate, you shall be one of my
  bridesmaids&mdash;perhaps it will be <i>your</i>turn to be a bride some of
  these days; who knows!"</p>

  <p>Just then Gertrude tapped at the door.</p>

  <p>"Miss Coventry, if you please, her ladyship wishes to see you in the
  drawing-room."</p>

  <p>My cousin's face fell several inches.</p>

  <p>"Some mistake, Gertrude," she exclaimed. "It's me isn't it, that mamma
  wants?"</p>

  <p>"Her ladyship bid me tell Miss Kate she wished to see her
  <i>immediately</i>," was my maid's reply; so I tripped downstairs with a
  beating heart, and crossed the hall just in time to see Squire Haycock riding
  leisurely away from the house (though it was bitter cold and a hard frost,
  the first of the season), and looking up at the window, doubtless in hopes of
  an encouraging wave from the white handkerchief of his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>
  presumptive.</p>

  <p>Short as was the interval between my own door and that of the drawing-room
  I had time to run over in my mind the whole advantages and disadvantages of
  the flattering proposal which I was now convinced had been made on my behalf.
  If I became Mrs. Haycock (and I saw clearly that I had not mistaken the
  Squire's meaning on our return from hunting), I should be at the head of a
  handsome establishment, should have a good-tempered, easy-going, pleasant
  husband, who would let me do just what I liked and hunt to my heart's
  content; should live in the country, and look after the poor, and feed hens
  and chickens, and sink down comfortably into a contented old age. I need not
  separate from Aunt Deborah, who would never be able to do without me; and I
  might, I am sure, turn the Squire with the greatest ease round my little
  finger. But then there certainly were great objections. I could have got over
  the colour of his hair, though a red head opposite me every morning would
  undoubtedly be a trial; but the freckles! No, I do not think I could do my
  duty as a wife by a man so dreadfully freckled. I'm certain I couldn't love
  him; and if I didn't love him I oughtn't to marry him, and I thought of the
  sad, sad tale of Lucy, Lady Horsingham, whose ghost was now in the nightly
  habit of haunting Dangerfield Hall. The struggles that poor thing must have
  gone through, the leaden hours of dull, torpid misery, the agonizing moments
  of acute remorse, the perpetual spirit-wearing conflict between duty and
  inclination, much to the discomfiture of the former; and the haunting face of
  Cousin Edward continually rising on that heated imagination, pleading,
  reproaching, suing till she loved him, if possibly more madly in his absence
  than when he was by her side. I too was beginning to have a "Cousin Edward"
  of my own; Frank Lovell's image was far too often present in my mind. I did
  not choose to confess to myself how much I liked him; but the more I
  reflected on Mr. Haycock's proposal the more I felt how impossible it would
  be never to <i>think</i> of Frank any more.</p>

  <p>"No!" I said inwardly, with my hand on the drawing-room door, "I will
  <i>not</i> give him up. I have his note even now in my bosom; <i>he</i> cares
  for <i>me</i>, at any rate. I am happier to-day than I have been for months,
  and I will <i>not</i> go and destroy it all with my own hand." I opened the
  door, and found myself in the formidable presence of Aunt Horsingham.</p>

  <p>Her ladyship looked colder and more reserved, if possible, than ever. She
  motioned me stiffly to take a chair, and plunged at once into the subject in
  her dry, measured tones.</p>

  <p>"Before I congratulate you, Kate," she began, "on such an unlooked-for
  piece of good fortune as has just come to my knowledge, I am bound to
  confess, much to my astonishment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, aunt," I put in; "that's complimentary, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"I should wish to say a few words," proceeded my aunt, without heeding the
  interruption, "on the duties which will now devolve upon you, and the line of
  conduct which I should advise you to pursue in your new sphere. These
  hoydenish manners, these ridiculous expeditions, these scampers all over the
  country, must be renounced forthwith. Unbecoming as they are in a young
  unmarried female, a much stricter sense of decorum, a vastly different repose
  and reserve of manner, are absolutely essential in a wife; and it is as a
  <i>wife</i>, Kate, that I am now addressing you."</p>

  <p>"A wife, aunt!" I exclaimed; "whose, I should like to know?"</p>

  <p>"This is an ill-chosen time for jesting, Kate," said my aunt with a frown.
  "I cannot congratulate you on your good taste in turning so important a
  subject into ridicule. Mr. Haycock has proposed to you; you have accepted
  him. Whilst poor Deborah is so ill I am your natural guardian, and he has
  with great propriety requested my consent; although, in the agitation very
  natural to a man so circumstanced," added my aunt, smothering a smile, "it
  was with some difficulty that I made out exactly what he meant."</p>

  <p>"He <i>never</i> proposed to me; I <i>never</i> accepted him," I broke in,
  breathless with agitation. "I never <i>will</i> be his wife, aunt; you had no
  right to tell him so. Write to him immediately&mdash;send a man off on
  horseback to overtake him. I'll put my bonnet on this instant, and walk every
  mile of the way myself. He's a true-hearted gentleman, and I won't have him
  made a fool of." I walked up and down the room&mdash;I looked Aunt Horsingham
  full in the face; she was quite cowed by my vehemence. I felt I was mistress
  now, while the excitement lasted, and she gave in; she even wrote a note to
  the Squire at my dictation&mdash;she dispatched it by a special
  messenger&mdash;she did everything I told her, and never so much as ventured
  on remonstrance or reproach; but she will never forgive me to her dying hour.
  There is no victory so complete as that which one obtains over a person who
  is always accustomed to meet with fear and obedience. Aunt Horsingham rules
  her household with a rod of iron; nobody ever ventures to disagree with her,
  or so much as to hint an opinion contrary to those which she is known to
  hold. Such a person is so astonished at resistance as to be incapable of
  quelling it; the very hardihood of the rebellion ensures its success. When I
  walked out of the drawing-room to-day I felt that for once I had obtained the
  victory in a contest with my aunt; that in future I should no longer be the
  "wild, troublesome Kate," the "black sheep" of the family, the scapegoat on
  whom were laid the faults and misdemeanours of all, but the master-spirit,
  the bold, resolute woman, whose value others were able to appreciate, and who
  was ready and willing to assert her own independence. In the meantime poor
  Aunt Deborah had to be informed of what had taken place, and Cousin Amelia to
  be undeceived in her groundless expectations. That the latter would never
  forgive me I was well enough acquainted with my own sex to be assured; but
  the task required to be done, notwithstanding. Flushed with my triumph, with
  heightened colour and flashing eyes, I stalked off towards my chamber and met
  Cousin John in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, Kate, what is the matter? What has happened?" exclaimed
  John in obvious perturbation.</p>

  <p>"A piece of news!" was my reply; "a conquest, John! What do you think? Mr.
  Haycock has just been here, and <i>proposed</i> for me!"</p>

  <p>He flushed up all over his face and temples, and then turned deadly pale;
  even his lips were quite white and wide apart. How they quivered as he tried
  to speak unconcernedly! And after all he got out nothing but, "Well,
  Kate?"</p>

  <p>"And I have refused him, John," I said quietly, but in a tone that showed
  him there was no mistake about it.</p>

  <p>"God bless you, Kate!" was all he replied, and turned away muttering
  something about "wet things" and his "dressing-room;" but he was going to the
  wrong door, and had to turn back, though he took care not to let me see his
  face again.</p>

  <p>I can't make John out. At dinner he was just as if nothing had happened;
  but at all events I'm glad I've refused Mr. Haycock; so I shall read Frank's
  note over once more and then go to bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

  <p class="first">I need quote no more from my diary, as the next few days
  offered no incident worthy of recording to break the monotony of our life at
  Dangerfield Hall. Drearier than ever it was, and more especially to me; for I
  felt that, although undeclared, there was "war to the knife" between myself,
  my aunt, and cousin. The latter scarcely spoke to me at all; and my aunt,
  whose defeat was rankling bitterly in her heart, merely took such sullen
  notice of me as was absolutely necessitated by the laws of hospitality and
  the usages of society. Poor Aunt Deborah required to be kept very quiet and
  free from all worries and annoyances. "The more she slept," the doctor said,
  "the sooner she would get well enough to move to London for further advice;"
  so I had not even her to talk to&mdash;there was no hunting&mdash;the frost
  got harder and harder&mdash;that obstinate weather-cock over the stables kept
  veering from north to north-east&mdash;the grooms went to exercise wrapped up
  in greatcoats and shawl handkerchiefs, and stayed out as short a time as was
  compatible with the mildest stable discipline; there would be no change of
  the moon for a week, and it was obvious that I should have but little use for
  Brilliant and White Stockings before our return to town.</p>

  <p>Oh! the hopelessness of a real bitter black frost coming on early in the
  season, especially when you are not at your own home and your time is
  limited; to get up morning after morning with the faint hope that the change
  may have come at last; to see the dry slates and the clear horizon and the
  iron-bound earth, and to ascertain in your own proper person that the water
  gets colder and colder every day. You puzzle over the almanac till your eyes
  ache, and study the thermometer till you get a crick in your neck. You watch
  the smoke from every farmhouse and cottage within your ken, and still, after
  curling high up into the pure, rarefied atmosphere, it floats hopelessly away
  to the southward and corroborates the odious dog-vane that you fondly
  imagined might have got stuck in its northerly direction. You walk out and
  ask every labourer you meet whether he "does not think we are going to have a
  change?" The man looks up from his work, wonders at your solicitude, opines
  "the gentry folk have queer ways," but answers honestly enough, according to
  his convictions, in the negative&mdash;perhaps giving some local reasons for
  his opinion, which, if an old man, he will tell you he has never known to
  fail. Lastly, you quarrel with every one of your non-hunting friends, whose
  unfeeling observations on "fine seasonable weather" and "healthy, bracing
  frosts" you feel to be brutal in the extreme.</p>

  <p>How I hated the frost at Dangerfield! My only chance of meeting with Frank
  Lovell was out hunting. I had written him an answer to his note (I have often
  heard Aunt Horsingham say that nothing is so inexcusable as not to answer a
  letter), and I had no possible means of delivering it. I could not put it in
  the bag, for my aunt keeps the key. I did not like to entrust it to any of
  the servants, and my own maid is the last person in whose power I should
  choose to place myself. I did once think of asking Cousin John to give it to
  Frank, and throwing myself on kind, good John's generosity, and confessing
  everything to him, and asking for his advice; but somehow I could not bring
  myself to it. If he had been my brother, nothing would have been easier; but
  John is only a cousin, and one or two little things of late had made me
  suspect that he liked me even better than cousins generally do; so altogether
  I thought I would leave it alone&mdash;besides, John was going off to shoot
  pheasants in Wales. The third morning of the frost he came down to breakfast
  in a suit of wondrous apparel that I knew meant a move in some direction, and
  I attacked him accordingly.</p>

  <p>"Is that killing 'get-up' entirely for our benefit, John?" I asked; "or
  are you bound on some expedition that requires more fascinations than
  common?"</p>

  <p>John coloured&mdash;he has taken to blushing lately. "I'm going down to
  Wales for a few days' shooting, Kate," was his reply. "I shall come back
  again when the frost breaks up if Lady Horsingham will be good enough to
  receive me." Aunt Horsingham is always very civil to John, and so is Cousin
  Amelia. People generally are to young bachelors. I wonder why men ever marry;
  they are so much more in request without wives and children.</p>

  <p>"Always happy to see <i>you</i>," said Aunt Horsingham, with an emphasis
  on the pronoun. "By-the-way, what is your address in Wales, that I may
  forward your letters?"</p>

  <p>John looked rather guilty as he handed an envelope to my aunt and begged
  her to copy it exactly.</p>

  <p>"I can't pronounce the name of my friend Lloyd's place," he said, "but
  you'll find it written there in seven consonants and one vowel."</p>

  <p>"Lloyd!" said I&mdash;"Lloyd! Wasn't there a pretty Miss Lloyd you used to
  dance with last season in London? John! John! I've found you out at last. Now
  I can account for the splendour of your attire. Now I can see why you post
  off to Wales in such a hurry, leaving your horses and your hunting and your
  cousin, sir, for the <i>beaux yeux</i> of Miss Fanny&mdash;isn't that her
  name? Well, John, I give you joy; she is a pretty girl, even in London, and
  Aunt Deborah says she's a fortune."</p>

  <p>John looked so distressed I didn't like to pursue the subject. I couldn't
  think what had come over him&mdash;he never spoke another word to me till he
  jumped into his dog-cart to be off, and then he only muttered "Goodbye, Kate"
  in a hoarse whisper, but he wrung my hand very hard, and I even thought there
  were tears in his eyes! He is a good fellow, John; I was sorry to think I
  might have said anything to hurt his feelings.</p>

  <p>After he went away it was drearier than ever. What could I do but think of
  Frank Lovell, and wonder when I should see him again? Where could he be?
  Perhaps at the inn at Muddlebury. I could see the smoke of the town from the
  breakfast-room windows, and used to watch it with a painful interest. Every
  time a servant came into the room I thought something impossible was going to
  happen. If a carriage drove up to the house&mdash;if a horse's tramp was
  heard in the approach&mdash;if the door-bell rung, I fancied it must be
  Captain Lovell coming to call&mdash;perhaps to explain
  everything&mdash;possibly to request an interview with my aunt, such as
  Squire Haycock had undergone, "but," as I said to myself with a beating
  heart, "to have a very different result." If the dwelling solely on one idea
  be a species of madness, then was I undoubtedly mad&mdash;nothing was so wild
  and extravagant as to appear impossible to my heated fancy. I was always
  expecting and always disappointed.</p>

  <p>The fourth morning I got a letter from Mrs. Lumley, which did not add much
  to my composure or comfort. Why is it ladies have such a knack of making each
  other miserable equally by letter as by word of mouth? I give the epistle of
  Mrs. Lumley verbatim, omitting only the dashes and notes of admiration with
  which it was studded:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"MY DEAREST DEAR KATE,&mdash;Here we are settled at
  Brighton, much to the benefit of my poor, dear husband, whom you have never
  seen, but who knows you well by name, and have everything, even the weather,
  all we can wish. The only drawback to me is the loss of your charming society
  and the absence of your dear, merry face.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I am leading a highly virtuous and praiseworthy life, and
  have not done the least bit of mischief since I came here, except making the
  Dean's wife jealous, which I can hardly call a crime, as she is a vulgar
  little woman with a red nose and a yellow bonnet&mdash;the Dean is a fat,
  good-natured man, and calls here nearly every day. His wife abuses me in all
  societies, and tries to pass me without speaking. You know how I always
  return good for evil, so I go up and shake hands with her, and ask after her
  dear children, and patronize her till I make her so angry she don't know
  which way to look&mdash;it's rather good fun in such a slow place as this. My
  time is fully occupied nursing 'my old man,' who was very ill before we came
  here, and can only go out in a pony-carriage for an hour or two at a time; so
  I have brought the ponies down and drive him myself.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The only chance the brown mare has of a gallop is in the
  mornings, though next week I mean to have a day with the harriers; indeed,
  they have appointed them at a good place on purpose for me. I inspected the
  regiment of Dragoons quartered here yesterday morning; they were at exercise
  on the Downs, and as the Gitana (my brown mare) always behaves well with
  troops, which my enemies would affirm is more than can be said of her
  mistress, I am able to report upon their general appearance and efficiency.
  Such a set of 'gigs,' my dear, I never saw in my life; large underbred
  horses, and not a good-looking man amongst them. The officers are, if
  possible, more hideous than the privates; and they never give balls or
  theatricals or anything, so we need waste no more words upon them.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I am improving my mind, though, vastly, picking up shells
  for my little cousins, and perfecting my education besides by learning to
  swim. I wish you were here&mdash;what fun we would have enacting the part of
  mermaids! though I fear the cold will now put a stop to my aquatic exploits.
  The other morning I swam nearly two hundred yards on a stretch; and the tide
  having taken me out of my reckoning, I brought up, as the sailors say,
  opposite the gentlemen's bathing-machines. What could I do? It was as
  impossible to walk along the beach as to fight back against the current.
  Presence of mind, Kate, is the salient point of the heroic character; the
  door of a machine was open, and I popped in. My dear, there were all his
  clothes, his hair-brush, his button-hook, his wig, and, would you believe it?
  an instrument for curling his whiskers! I put everything on except the wig,
  crowned myself with his broad-brimmed white hat, felt in his pockets, which
  were full of gold and silver, and, to my credit be it said, only selected one
  shilling, with which I paid the bathing-man, and walked off undiscovered to
  my own machine. The fat old she-triton laughed till she cried. I dressed in
  my proper costume leisurely enough, and was amused to hear afterwards of the
  luckless plight in which a stout gentleman had found himself by the temporary
  loss of all his apparel whilst he was disporting in 'the briny.'</p>

  <p class="letter">"Other adventures I have had none; and the contrast is, as
  you may believe, somewhat striking after the last two or three weeks of the
  London season&mdash;always, to my mind, the pleasantest part of the year. I
  was sorry you left town when you did; we had such a number of charming little
  dinners and expeditions in our own set. Dear Frank Lovell was the life and
  soul of us all. I never knew him in such spirits&mdash;quite like a boy out
  of school; and there were few days that we did not meet either at Greenwich
  or Richmond, or Windsor or Vauxhall; and of course wherever <i>he</i> went
  there was Lady Scapegrace. I must say that, although nobody can accuse me of
  being a prude, the way she goes on with Frank is rather too brazen-faced even
  for <i>her</i>&mdash;taking him everywhere in her carriage, setting him down
  at his club after the opera, walking with him in Kensington Gardens, his cab
  always at the door, and her ladyship 'not at home' even to me. To be sure, he
  is almost as bad, if it is true, as everybody says it is, that he is to marry
  Miss Molasses.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Poor Frank! he must get hold of somebody with money, or he
  will soon be in the Bench. He is rather a friend of yours, my dear, so I
  ought not to abuse him; but he is <i>very wild</i>, and though extremely
  agreeable, I am afraid utterly unprincipled. I do not believe, however, that
  he cares one snap of the fingers for Lady Scapegrace, or Miss Molasses
  either, for the matter of that. I meant to have written you a long letter;
  but my stupid servants have let the Dean in, and I hear his cough at this
  moment on the stairs&mdash;he is sadly out of wind before he reaches the
  first landing. I think even my poor 'old man' would beat him at even weights
  a hundred yards along the beach. As I shall not get rid of him under an hour,
  and the post will by that time be gone out, I must wish you
  good-bye.&mdash;Ever my dearest Kate's most affectionate</p>

  <p class="letter">&mdash;"M. L."</p><br>

  <p>I threw the letter on the floor, and stamped upon it with my feet. And was
  this the end of all? To have brooded and pined, and made myself miserable and
  well-nigh broken my heart day by day for a man that was to prove so utterly
  unworthy as this! To have been thrown over for a Lady Scapegrace! or, worse
  still, to have allowed even to myself that I cared for one who was ready and
  willing to be sold to a Miss Molasses.</p>

  <p>"Too degrading!" I thought. "No, I'll never care for him again; the dream
  is over. What a fool I've been! And yet&mdash;why did he send his horses down
  to Muddlebury? Why did he serenade me that night from the Park? Why is he not
  now with his dear Lady Scapegrace at Scamperly, where I see by the <i>Morning
  Post</i> Sir Guy is 'entertaining a party of fashionables during the frost'?
  No! I will not give him up quite yet."</p>

  <p>On reading her letter over again, which I did many times during the day, I
  found a ray of comfort in my voluble correspondent's own opinion that Frank
  did not himself care a pin for either of the ladies, to both of whom the
  world gave him so unhesitatingly. Well, that was something, at any rate. As
  for his wildness and his debts, and his recklessness and many escapades, I
  liked him none the worse for these&mdash;what woman ever did? I thought it
  all over during the whole day, and by the time that I opened my window for my
  usual lookout into the night before going to bed, I am afraid I felt more
  inclined than ever to forgive him all that had gone before, and more
  determined to find some means of forwarding him the answer I had written to
  his note, and which I had been so many times on the point of burning during
  the day.</p>

  <p>What a bitter cold night it was!&mdash;yet the keen north wind felt
  pleasant and refreshing on my fevered forehead. There had been a sprinkling
  of snow too since sunset, and the open surface of the Park was completely
  whitened over&mdash;how cheerless and desolate it looked! I hadn't the heart
  to stay very long at the window; it reminded me too much of the pleasant
  evenings one short week ago. I felt weary and desponding, and drowsy with
  uncertainty and unhappiness, so I was in the act of shutting down the window,
  when I saw a dark figure moving rapidly across the snow in the direction of
  the house. Not for an instant did I mistake it for a deer, or a gamekeeper,
  or a poacher, or a housebreaker. From the moment I set eyes on it, something
  told me it must be Frank Lovell; and though I shrunk back that he might not
  see me, I watched him with painful anxiety and a beating heart. He seemed to
  know his way quite well. He came straight to the moat, felt his way
  cautiously for a step or two, and finding the ice would bear him, crossed at
  once, and took up a position under my window, not twenty feet from where I
  was standing.</p>

  <p>He must have seen my shadow across the candle-light, for he whispered my
  name.</p>

  <p>"Miss Coventry&mdash;Kate! Only one word." What could I do? Poor fellow!
  he had walked all that distance in the cold and the snow only for one
  word&mdash;and this was the man I had been doubting and misjudging all day!
  Why, of course, though I know it was very wrong and very improper and all
  that, of course I spoke to him, and listened to what he had to say, and
  carried on a long conversation, the effect of which was somewhat ludicrous,
  in consequence of the distance between the parties, question and answer
  requiring to be <i>shouted</i>, as it were, in a whisper. The night too was
  clouding over, more snow was falling, and it was getting so dark I could not
  see Frank, even at the distance of twelve or fourteen feet, and it could not
  have been much more between my bedroom window and the ground.</p>

  <p>"Did you get my note?" said he with sundry complimentary expressions.</p>

  <p>"Here's the answer," was my practical reply, as I dropped my own missive
  into the darkness.</p>

  <p>I know he caught it, because&mdash;because&mdash;<i>I heard him kiss
  it</i>. At that moment I was aware of a step in the passage, a hand on my
  door. Down went my window in a twinkling, out went my candles&mdash;the wick
  of the second one would keep glimmering like a light far off at sea&mdash;and
  in came Aunt Horsingham, clad in flannel attire, with a wondrous head-dress,
  the like of which I have never beheld before or since, just as I popped into
  bed, and buried myself beneath the clothes as if I had been asleep for
  hours.</p>

  <p>"Where can it be, Kate?" said my aunt. "I have been in every room along
  the passage to find out where the light comes from. I saw it distinctly from
  my own room, streaming across the moat; there might be thieves in the house,"
  added my aunt, looking valiant even in flannel, "or some of the men-servants
  carousing, but I have been in every room on the ground floor myself; and then
  I thought perhaps you might be sitting up reading."</p>

  <p>"Reading, aunt? Oh dear, no! I assure you I wasn't reading," I answered,
  every nerve racked with suspense, lest Frank should get impatient and wonder
  what had become of me&mdash;perhaps throw a snowball up at the window to
  attract my attention.</p>

  <p>"What o'clock is it?" I added with a feigned yawn. "I think I must have
  been asleep for hours."</p>

  <p>As if to punish me for this gratuitous perversion of the truth, the words
  were hardly out of my mouth when I heard a loud crack on the ice, and a
  splash as of the sudden immersion of some daring adventurer; then all was
  still&mdash;the snow-flakes fell softly against the window panes. My aunt,
  shading her candle with her long hand, talked drowsily on; and finally
  persisted in my coming to sleep with her in her own room, as she said I was
  "the only person in the house that had the nerves of a hen." I would have
  given all I was worth in the world to have one more look out of the open
  window, though even then it might be too late. I would willingly have walked
  barefoot in the snow all the way to Muddlebury, only to know he was safe back
  at the inn. For a moment I thought of confessing everything and alarming the
  house, but I had <i>not</i> courage; so I followed my aunt to her room, and
  lay awake that livelong night in such a state of agony and suspense as I hope
  I may never have to endure again.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

  <p class="first">It may easily be believed that I took an early walk next
  morning before breakfast. No sooner had I made my escape from Aunt
  Horsingham's room, than, in utter defiance of the cold thaw just commencing,
  I put my bonnet on and made the best of my way to the moat. Sure enough,
  large fragments of ice were floating about where the surface had been broken,
  close to the side farthest from the Hall. There were footprints on the snow
  though, leading away through the Park in the direction of Muddlebury, and I
  came back to breakfast with a heart lightened of at least half its load. We
  were to return to London immediately. Aunt Deborah, pale and reduced, but
  undoubtedly better, was able to appear at breakfast, and Lady Horsingham, now
  that we were really about to take leave of her, seemed to value our society,
  and to be sorry to part with us.</p>

  <p>"My dear Deborah, I trust you are well wrapped up for this cold raw day,"
  said our hostess, pressing on her departing guest all kinds of provision for
  the journey. "I have ordered them to put up a paper of sandwiches and some
  sherry, and a few biscuits and a bottle of peppermint-water."</p>

  <p>"And, Aunt Deborah," put in Cousin Amelia, "here's a comforter I've made
  you myself, and a box of cayenne lozenges for your throat; and don't forget
  the stone jug of hot water for your poor feet; and mind you write directly
  you arrive&mdash;you or Kate," she added, turning to address me almost for
  the first time since the memorable mistake about Squire Haycock.</p>

  <p>Aunt Deborah was completely overpowered by so much kindness.</p>

  <p>"You'd better have the carriage all to yourself&mdash;you and your maid,"
  persisted Lady Horsingham. "I'll drive Kate as far as the station in the
  pony-carriage.&mdash;Kate, you're not afraid to trust yourself with me in the
  pony-carriage?"</p>

  <p>"Not I, indeed, aunt," was my reply, "nor with anybody else, for that
  matter. I've pretty good nerves&mdash;there are few things that I am afraid
  of."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, Kate, I fear it is so," was my aunt's reply. "I own I should like
  to see you a little more of a coward."</p>

  <p>So it was settled that Aunt Deborah and Gertrude being safely packed up in
  the close carriage, I should accompany Lady Horsingham, who was rather proud
  of her charioteering skill, and drove stiff and upright, as if she had
  swallowed the poker&mdash;never looking to the right or left, or allowing her
  attention to wander for an instant from the ponies she had undertaken to
  control.</p>

  <p>Now, these said ponies had been doing nothing during the frost except
  consuming their three feeds a day with vigorous appetite and a considerable
  accession of high spirits. Consequently they were, what is termed in stable
  language, very much "above themselves"&mdash;a state of self-exaltation which
  they demonstrated by sundry unbecoming squeaks and gambols as soon as they
  found themselves fairly started on their journey. Tiny, the youngest and
  handsomest, would persist in shying, plunging, and swerving against the pole,
  much to the demoralization of his comrade, Mouse, a stiff-built little fellow
  with a thick neck, who was ordinarily extremely well-behaved, but apt on
  occasions like the present to lower his rebellious little head and defy all
  control.</p>

  <p>Lady Horsingham was tolerably courageous, but totally destitute of what is
  termed "hand," a quality as necessary in driving as in riding, particularly
  with fractious or high-spirited horses. The seat of a pony-carriage, besides,
  is not a position from which a Jehu has much command over the animals in
  front of him; and although, as I have repeatedly said, I am not nervous, I
  had earned sufficient experience in the ways of the equine race to know that
  we might easily be placed in a position of some peril should anything occur
  to excite the mischievous propensities of either of the specimens now
  gambolling before us. More accidents have happened out of pony-carriages than
  all other descriptions of vehicle put together.</p>

  <p>It is said that in the olden and golden days of the road the usual death
  of a "long coachman" was to be pitched out of a gig; and doubtless that
  two-wheeled conveniency, particularly when going at any pace, is capable of
  arriving at a large proportion of grief. But even a gig, if properly
  constructed, admits of the driver having a certain amount of control over his
  horse; he is well above the animal, and can get a good purchase to pull him
  up from, when the acceleration is becoming dangerous, or there is a tendency
  to the grosser insubordination of a "kicking match." Not so in a
  pony-carriage: low down upon the ground, even under their very heels, you are
  completely at the mercy of your team; and the facility of egress in the event
  of a runaway only tempts you to the fatal expedient of jumping
  out&mdash;another form of expression for "certain death."</p>

  <p>To be sure, if people will but sit still, there is no reason why they
  should be much alarmed, as an "upset" from so low an elevation need not
  necessarily produce any very serious results. But they never <i>will</i> sit
  still&mdash;at least they won't in nine cases out of ten, and the consequence
  is that whilst newspaper columns are filled with "horrid accidents" and
  "frightful occurrences," based on the fact of the "unfortunate sufferer
  taking an airing in his or her pony-carriage," many an elderly lady and
  cautious gentleman is not to be persuaded into entering one of these little
  conveyances, but prefers the slow and sure travelling of his or her own
  respectable feet.</p>

  <p>Well, Lady Horsingham seemed rather uncomfortable on her driving-seat,
  although far too proud to acknowledge so derogatory a feeling. We had no
  servant with us; and when I suggested that we might as well take one of the
  stablemen to open the gates, my proposal was met with derision and
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"I should have thought such a masculine lady as yourself, Kate, would have
  been above requiring any assistance. I am always in the habit of driving
  these ponies quite by myself; but of course, if <i>you're afraid</i>, I'll
  have a groom to go with us immediately."</p>

  <p><i>Afraid</i>, indeed! I scouted the idea: my blood was up, and I almost
  hoped something would happen, that I might fling the word in my aunt's teeth,
  and ask her, "Who's <i>afraid</i> now?" It came sooner than I bargained
  for.</p>

  <p>The ponies were pulling hard, and had got their mouths so thoroughly set
  against my aunt's iron hand, that she might as well have been driving with a
  pair of halters for any power she had over them, when a rush of colts in an
  adjoining paddock on one side of the lane, and a covey of partridges
  "whirring up" out of a turnip-field on the other, started them both at the
  same moment. My aunt gave a slight scream, clutched at her reins with a jerk;
  down went the ponies' heads, and we were off, as hard as ever they could lay
  legs to the ground, along a deep-rutted narrow lane, with innumerable
  twistings and turnings in front of us, for a certainty, and the off-chance of
  a wagon and bell team blocking up the whole passage before we could emerge
  upon the high road.</p>

  <p>"Lay hold, Kate!" vociferated my aunt, pulling for her very life, with the
  veins on her bare wrists swelling up like whipcord. "Gracious goodness! can't
  you stop 'em? There's a gravel-pit not half a mile farther on! I'll jump out!
  I'll jump out!"</p>

  <p>My aunt began kicking her feet clear of the sundry wraps and shawls, and
  the leather apron that kept our knees warm, though I must do her the justice
  to say that she still tugged hard at the reins. I saw such an expedient would
  be certain death, and I wound one arm round her waist, and held her forcibly
  down in her seat, while with the other I endeavoured to assist her in the
  hopeless task of stopping the runaway ponies. Everything was against us: the
  ground was slightly on the decline; the thaw had not yet reached the
  sheltered road we were travelling, and the wheels rung against its frozen
  surface as they spun round with a velocity that seemed to add to the
  excitement of our flying steeds. Ever and anon we bounded and bumped over
  some rut or inequality that was deeper than usual. Twice we were within an
  inch of the ditch; once, for an awful hundred yards, we were balancing on two
  wheels; and still we went faster and faster than ever. The trees and hedges
  wheeled by us; the gravel road streamed away behind us. I began to get giddy
  and to lose my strength. I could hardly hope to hold my aunt in much longer,
  and now she began to struggle frightfully, for we were nearing the gravel-pit
  turn! Ahead of us was a comfortable fat farmer, jogging drowsily to market in
  his gig. I can see his broad, well-to-do back now. What would I have given to
  be seated, I had almost said <i>enthroned</i>, by his side? What a smash if
  we had touched him! I pulled frantically at the off-rein, and we just cleared
  his wheel. He said something; I could not make out what. I was nearly
  exhausted, and shut my eyes, resigning myself to my fate, but still clinging
  to my aunt. I think that if ever that austere woman was near fainting it was
  on this occasion. I just caught a glimpse of her white, stony face and fixed
  eyes; her terror even gave me a certain confidence. A figure in front of us
  commenced gesticulating and shouting and waving its hat. The ponies slackened
  their pace, and my courage began to revive.</p>

  <p>"Sit still," I exclaimed to my aunt as I indulged them with a good strong
  "give-and-take" pull.</p>

  <p>The gravel-pit corner was close at hand, but the figure had seized the
  refractory little steeds by their heads, and though I shook all over, and
  felt really frightened now the danger was past, I knew that we were safe, and
  that we owed our safety to a tall, ragged cripple with a crutch and a bandage
  over one eye.</p>

  <p><a id="pic8"

  <div align="center">

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">The figure had seized the refractory little steeds by
    their heads.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>My aunt jumped out in a twinkling, and the instant she touched <i>terra
  firma</i> put her hand to her side, and began to sob and gasp and pant, as
  ladies will previous to an attack of what the doctors call "hysteria." She
  leant upon the cripple's shoulder, and I observed a strange, roguish sparkle
  in his unbandaged eye. Moreover, I remarked that his hands were white and
  clean, and his figure, if he hadn't been such a cripple, would have been tall
  and active.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?" gasped my aunt. "I won't get in; nothing shall induce
  me to get in again. Kate, give this good man half a crown. What a
  providential escape! He ought to have a sovereign. Perhaps ten shillings will
  be enough. How am I to get back? I'll walk all the way rather than get
  in."</p>

  <p>"But, aunt," I suggested, "at any rate I must get to the station. Aunt
  Deborah is sure to think something has happened, and she ought not to be
  frightened till she gets stronger. How far is it to the station? I think I
  should not mind driving the ponies on."</p>

  <p>In the meantime the fat farmer whom we had passed so rapidly had arrived
  at the scene of action, his anxiety not having induced him in the slightest
  degree to increase the jog-trot pace at which all his ideas seemed to travel.
  He knew Lady Horsingham quite well, and now sat in his gig with his hat off,
  wiping his fat face, and expatiating on the narrow escape her ladyship had
  made, but without offering the slightest suggestion or assistance
  whatever.</p>

  <p>At this juncture the cripple showed himself a man of energy.</p>

  <p>"Your ladyship had best go home with this gentleman," said he, indicating
  the fat farmer, "if the young lady is not afraid to go on. I can take care of
  her as far as the railway, if it's not too great a liberty, and bring the
  ponies back to the Hall afterwards, my lady?" with an interrogative snatch at
  his ragged hat.</p>

  <p>It seemed the best thing to be done under the circumstances. My aunt,
  after much demurring and another incipient attack of the hysterics, consented
  to entrust herself to the fat farmer's guidance, not, however, until she was
  assured that his horse was both blind and broken-winded. I put Mouse's bridle
  down on the lower bar instead of the cheek, on which he had previously been
  driven. My aunt climbed into the gig; I mounted the pony-carriage, the
  cripple took his seat deferentially by my side, and away we went on our
  respective journeys; certainly in a mode which we had little anticipated when
  we left the front door at Dangerfield Hall.</p>

  <p>My preserver sat half in and half out of the carriage, leaning his white,
  well-shaped hand upon the splashboard. The bandaged side of his face was
  towards me. The ponies went quietly enough; they had enjoyed their gallop,
  and were, I think, a little blown. I had leisure to take a good survey of my
  companion. When we had thus travelled for a quarter of a mile in silence he
  turned his face towards me. We looked at each other for about half a minute,
  and then both burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"You didn't know me, Miss Coventry! not the least in the world," exclaimed
  the cripple, pulling the bandage off his face, and showing another eye quite
  as handsome as the one that had previously been uncovered.</p>

  <p>"How could you do so, Captain Lovell?" was all I could reply. "Conceive if
  my aunt had found you out, or even if any one should recognize you now. What
  would people think of <i>me</i>? But how did you know we were going to London
  to-day, and how could you tell the ponies would run away?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind how I knew your movements, Miss Coventry," was the reply.
  "Kate! may I call you Kate? it's such a soft, sweet name," he added, now
  sitting altogether <i>inside</i> the carriage, which certainly was a small
  one for two people. "You don't know how I've watched for you, and waited and
  prowled about, during the last few days. You don't know how anxious I've been
  only for one word&mdash;even one look. I've spent hours out on the Down just
  to see the flutter of your white dress as you went through the
  shrubbery&mdash;even at that distance it was something to gaze at you and
  know you were there. Last night I crossed the ice under your window."</p>

  <p>"You did indeed!" I replied with a laugh; "and what a ducking you must
  have got!"</p>

  <p>Frank laughed too, and resumed. "I was sadly afraid that your aunt might
  have found out you were holding a parley with the enemy outside the walls. I
  knew you were to go to London to-day. I thought very likely you might be
  annoyed, and put under surveillance on my account, and I was resolved to see
  you, if only for one moment; so I borrowed these ragged garments of a
  professional beggar, who I believe is a great deal better off in reality than
  myself, and I determined to watch for your carriage and trust to chance for a
  word, or even a glance of recognition. She has befriended me more than I
  could expect. At first, when I saw 'Aunt Deborah' alone in the chariot, it
  flashed across me that perhaps you were to stay <i>en penitence</i> at
  Dangerfield. But I knew Lady Horsingham had a pony-carriage. I also
  knew&mdash;or what would be the use of servants?&mdash;that it was ordered
  this morning; so I stumped gaily along the road, thinking that at all events
  I might have an opportunity of saying three words to you at the station
  whilst the servants were putting the luggage on, and the dear aunts, who I
  presume cherish a mutual hatred, were wishing each other a tender farewell.
  But that such a chance as this runaway should befriend me was more than I
  ever dared to hope for, and that I should be sitting next <i>you</i>, Kate
  (and <i>so close</i>, I'm sure he might have added), in Lady Horsingham's
  pony-phaeton is a piece of good luck that in my wildest moments I never so
  much as dreamt of. We scarcely ever meet now. There&mdash;you needn't drive
  so fast; the up-train don't go by till the half-hour, and every minute is
  precious, at least to <i>me</i>. We are kept sadly apart, Kate. If you can
  bear it, I can't. I should like to be near you always&mdash;always to watch
  over you and worship you. Confound that pony! he's off again."</p>

  <p>Sure enough, Tiny was indulging in more vagaries, as if he meditated a
  second fit of rebellion; and what with holding him and humouring Mouse, and
  keeping my head down so as to hide my face from Frank, for I didn't want him
  to see how I was blushing, I am sure I had enough to do.</p>

  <p>"Kate, you must really have pity on me," pursued Frank. "You don't know
  how miserable I am sometimes (I wonder what he wanted me to say?), or how
  happy you have it in your power to make me. Here we are at that cursed
  station, and my dream is over. I must be the cripple and the beggar once
  more&mdash;a beggar I am indeed, Kate, without your affection. When shall we
  meet again, and where?"</p>

  <p>"In London," was all I could answer.</p>

  <p>"And you won't forget me, Kate?" pleaded poor Frank, looking so handsome,
  poor fellow.</p>

  <p>"<i>Never</i>," I replied, and before I knew how it was, I found myself
  standing on the platform with Aunt Deborah and the servants and the luggage.
  The great green engine was panting and gasping in front of me, but ponies and
  pony-carriage and cripple had all vanished like a dream.</p>

  <p>As we steamed on to London I sometimes thought it <i>was</i> a dream, not
  altogether a pleasant one, nor yet exactly the reverse. I should have liked
  my admirer to have been a little more explicit. It is all very well to talk
  of being miserable and desperate, and to ring the changes of meeting and
  parting, and looks and sighs, and all that; but after all the real question
  is, "Will you?" or "Won't you?" and I don't think a man is acting very fairly
  towards a girl who don't put the case in that way at once before he allows
  himself to run into rhapsodies about his feelings and his sufferings and such
  matters, which, after all, lead to nothing, or at least to nothing
  satisfactory. To be sure, men are strange creatures, and upon my word I
  sometimes think they are more troubled with shyness than our own sex. Perhaps
  it's their diffidence that makes them hesitate so, and, as it were, "beat
  about the bush," when they have only got to "flush the bird" and shoot it at
  once and put it in the game-bag. Perhaps it's their pride for fear of being
  refused. Now, I think it's far more creditable to a man to wear the willow,
  and take to <i>men dinners</i> and brandy-and-water for a month or six weeks,
  than to break a girl's heart for a whole year; and I know it takes nearly
  that time for a well-brought-up young lady to get over a <i>real</i>
  matrimonial disappointment. However, shy or not shy, they certainly ought to
  be explicit. It's too bad to miss a chance because we cannot interpret the
  metaphor in which some bashful swain thinks it decorous to couch his
  proposals; and I once knew a young lady who, happening to dislike needlework,
  and replying in the negative to the insidious question, "Can you sew a
  button?" never knew for months that she had actually declined a man she was
  really fond of, with large black whiskers, and two-and-twenty hundred a year.
  Women can't be too cautious.</p>

  <p class="first">WAS not sorry to be once again fairly settled in Lowndes
  Street. Even in the winter London has its charms. People don't watch
  everything you do or carp at everything you say. If there is more apparent
  constraint, there is more real liberty than in the country. Besides, you have
  so much society, and everybody is so much pleasanter in the metropolis during
  December than July. The frost had set in again harder than ever. Brilliant
  and White Stockings, like "Speir-Adam's steeds," were compelled to "bide in
  stall." John was lingering at the Lloyds or elsewhere in the Principality,
  though expected back every day. Aunt Deborah was still weak, and had only
  just sufficient energy to forbid Captain Lovell the house, and insist on my
  never speaking to him. I can't think what she had found out or what Aunt
  Horsingham had told her; but this I know, that if ever I have a daughter, and
  I don't want her to like Mr. Dash, or to be continually thinking about him, I
  shall not forbid her to speak to him; nor shall I take every opportunity of
  impressing on her that he is wild, unprincipled, reckless, and dissipated,
  and that the only redeeming points about him are his agreeable conversation
  and his good looks. Altogether, I should have been somewhat dull had it not
  been for Mrs. Lumley; but of that vivacious lady I saw a good deal, and I
  confess took a far greater pleasure in her society than on our first
  acquaintance I should have esteemed possible. When I am ill at ease with
  myself, not thoroughly satisfied with my own conduct, I always like the
  society of <i>fast</i> people; their liberality of sentiment and general
  carelessness of demeanour convey no tacit reproach on my own want of
  restraint, and I feel more at home with them than with such severe moralists
  as Aunt Horsingham or hypocritical Cousin Amelia. So I drove and shopped and
  visited with Mrs. Lumley&mdash;nay, I was even permitted as a great favour to
  dine with her on one or two occasions, Aunt Deborah only stipulating that
  there should be no male addition to the party except Mr. Lumley himself, or,
  as the lady of the house termed him, "her old man."</p>

  <p>I confess I liked the "old man," and so I think in her own way did his
  wife. Why she married him I cannot think, more particularly as he had not
  then succeeded to the comfortable fortune they now enjoy: he was little, old,
  ugly, decrepit, and an invalid, but he was good nature and contentment
  personified. I believe he had great talents&mdash;for all his want of
  physical beauty he had a fine head&mdash;but these talents were wholly and
  unsparingly devoted to one pursuit: he was an entomologist. With a black
  beetle and a microscope he was happy for the day. Piles upon piles of
  manuscripts had he written upon the forms and classification of the
  bluebottle fly. He could tell you how many legs are flourished by the
  house-spider, and was thoroughly versed in the anatomy of the common gnat.
  This pursuit, or science as he called it, engrossed his whole attention. It
  was fortunate he had such an absorbing occupation, inasmuch as his general
  debility prevented his entering into any amusement out of doors. His wife and
  he seemed to understand each other perfectly.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he would say when listening to some escapade that it would have
  been scarcely prudent to trust to most husbands' ears, "I never interfere
  with your butterflies, and you never trouble yourself about mine. I must,
  however, do myself the justice to observe that you get tired of your insects
  infinitely the soonest of the two."</p>

  <p>He never inquired where she went or what she did, but late or early always
  received her with the same quiet welcome, the same sly, good-humoured smile.
  I firmly believe that with all her levity, whatever scandal might say, she
  was a good wife to him. He trusted her implicitly; and I think she felt his
  confidence deserved to be respected. Such was not the opinion of the world, I
  am well aware; but we all know the charitable construction it is so eager to
  put on a fair face with a loud laugh and a good set of teeth. Dear me! if he
  looked for a lady that had never been <i>talked about</i>, C sar might have
  searched London for a wife in vain. Good Mr. Lumley professed a great
  affection for me, and would occasionally favour me with long and technical
  dissertations on the interior economy of the flea, for example; and once in
  the fullness of his heart confided to his wife that "Miss Coventry was really
  a <i>dear</i> girl; it's my belief, Madge, that if she'd been a man she'd
  have been a naturalist." These little dinners were indeed vastly agreeable.
  Nobody had such a comfortable house or such a good cook or so many pretty
  things as Mrs. Lumley. Her "old man" seemed to enjoy the relaxation of
  ladies' society after his morning labours and researches. With me he was
  good-humoured and full of fun; at his wife's jokes and stories, most of them
  somewhat scandalous, he would laugh till he cried.</p>

  <p>"I'm responsible for you, Miss Coventry," he would say with a sly laugh.
  "You're not fit to be trusted with Madge; upon my life, I believe she is the
  wildest of the two. If you won't have the carriage, I must walk back with you
  myself.&mdash;How far is it, Madge? Do you think I can <i>stay the
  distance</i>, as you sporting people term it in your inexplicable
  jargon?"</p>

  <p>"Why, you know you can't get a hundred yards, you foolish old man,"
  laughed his wife. "A nice chaperon you'd make for Kate. Why, she'd have to
  carry you, and you know you'd tumble off even then. No, no; you and I will
  stay comfortably here by the fire, and I'll give you your tea and put you
  tidily to bed. I shan't be home any other night this week. Kate has a convoy
  coming for her;&mdash;haven't you, Kate?&mdash;<i>Le beau cousin</i> will
  take the best possible care of us; and even prim Aunt Deborah won't object to
  our walking back with <i>him</i>. I believe he came up from Wales on purpose.
  What would somebody else give to take the charge off his hands?&mdash;You
  needn't blush, Kate; I can see through a millstone as far as my neighbours.
  I'm not quite such a fool as I look;&mdash;am I, 'old man'?&mdash;There's the
  doorbell.&mdash;John, ask Mr. Jones if he won't step up and have some tea."
  We were sitting by a blazing fire in the boudoir, a snug and beautiful little
  room, to which no one was admitted but the lady's especial favourites; even
  the "old man" never entered it during the day.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jones's compliments, and he hopes you'll excuse him, ma'am," was the
  footman's answer on his return; "but it's very late, and he promised to bring
  Miss Coventry back by eleven."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sure," said Mrs. Lumley, "if I was you, Kate, I shouldn't stand
  his anticipating his authority in this way. Never mind; be a good girl, and
  do as you're bid&mdash;pop your bonnet on. Shall I lend you an extra shawl?
  There, you may give my 'old man' a kiss, if you like. Bless him! he's gone
  fast asleep. Good-night, Kate; mind you come to luncheon to-morrow, there's a
  dear." So saying, Mrs. Lumley bid me a most affectionate farewell; and I
  found myself leaning on John's arm, to walk home through the clear frosty
  night.</p>

  <p>I do like perambulating London streets by gaslight&mdash;of course with a
  gentleman to take care of one. It is so much pleasanter than being stewed up
  in a brougham. How I wish it was the fashion for people to take their bonnets
  out to dinner with them, and walk back in the cool fresh air! If it is
  delightful even in winter, how much more so in the hot summer nights of the
  season! Your spirits rise and your nerves brace themselves as you inhale the
  midnight air, with all its smoky particles, pure by comparison with that
  which has just been poisoning you in a crowded drawing-room. Your cavalier
  asks leave to indulge in his "weed," and you enjoy its fragrance at
  second-hand as he puffs contentedly away and chats on in that prosy,
  confidential sort of manner which no <i>man</i> ever succeeds in assuming,
  save with a cigar in his mouth. John lit his, of course, but was less
  communicative, to my fancy, than usual. After asking me if I had "enjoyed a
  pleasant evening," and whether "I <i>preferred</i> walking," he relapsed into
  a somewhat constrained silence. I too walked on without speaking. Much as I
  love the night, it always makes me rather melancholy; and I dare say we
  should have got to Lowndes Street without exchanging a syllable, had not some
  imp of mischief prompted me to cross-examine my cousin a little upon his
  <i>s&eacute;jour</i> in Wales, and to quiz him half spitefully on his supposed
  <i>penchant</i> for pretty Fanny Lloyd. John <i>rose</i> freely in a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"I know where you pick up all this nonsense, Kate," he burst out quite
  savagely; "I know where half the scandal and half the mischief in London
  originates! With that odious woman whose house we have just quitted, whose
  tongue cannot be still for a single moment; who never by any chance speaks a
  word of truth, and who is seldom so happy as when she is making mischief. I
  pity that poor decrepit husband of hers, though he ought to keep her in
  better order; yet it <i>is</i> a hard case upon any man to be tied to such a
  Jezebel as <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>"The Jezebel, as you call her, John," I interposed quietly, "is my most
  intimate friend."</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I complain of," urged my cousin; "that's my great
  objection to her, Kate; that's one of the things that I do believe are
  driving me out of my senses day by day. You know I don't wish you to
  associate with her; you know that I object extremely to your being seen
  everywhere in her company. But you don't care: the more I expostulate the
  more obstinate and wilful you seem to become."</p>

  <p>It is my turn to be angry now.</p>

  <p>"Obstinate and wilful indeed!" I repeated, drawing myself up. "I should
  like to know what right you have to apply such terms to <i>me</i>! Who gave
  <i>you</i> authority to choose my society for me, or to determine where I
  shall go or what I shall do? You presume on your relationship, John; you take
  an ungenerous advantage of the regard and affection which I have always
  entertained for you."</p>

  <p>John was mollified in an instant.</p>

  <p>"<i>Do</i> you entertain regard and affection for me, Kate?" said he; "do
  you value my good opinion and consider me as your dearest and best
  friend?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do, John," was my reply. "Haven't we known each other from
  childhood, and are you not like a brother to me?"</p>

  <p>John's face fell a little and his voice shook as he spoke. "Am I never to
  be more than a brother to you&mdash;never to obtain a greater interest in
  you, a larger share of your regard than I have now? Listen to me, Kate; I
  have something to tell you, and I can put it off no longer. This delay, this
  uncertainty day by day, I do believe will drive me mad. Kate, I promised Aunt
  Deborah faithfully that I would never enter on this subject till you came of
  age, and you know by your father's will you don't come of age till you're
  five-and-twenty. 'By that time, John,' said my aunt, 'Kate will have seen
  plenty of others, and be old enough to know her own mind. If she takes you
  then, she takes you with her eyes open, and she won't get tired of you and
  find out she likes some one else better. Promise me, John, that you'll wait
  till then.' And I did promise, Kate; but I can't keep my word&mdash;I can't
  wait in this state of anxiety and uncertainty, and perhaps lose you after
  all. It's too great a stake to play for if one is to be kept so long in
  suspense, and I have resolved to be put out of my pain one way or the
  other."</p>

  <p>John paused. I had never seen him so excited before. He was quite hot,
  though the night was keen and frosty; his arm trembled as mine leant upon it;
  and though his cigar was gone out, he kept puffing away, utterly unconscious
  of the fact. He seemed to expect an answer. I hesitated; I did not know what
  to reply. I had got so accustomed to Cousin John that I never looked upon him
  in any other light than that of a favourite brother, a constant companion and
  friend. Moreover, I was not prepared to take any such decisive step as that
  to which he now seemed to be urging me. There is a great difference between
  <i>liking</i> people and giving them power of life and death over one for the
  rest of one's days. I will not say that the image of another did not rise
  before me in all its winning beauty as I had seen it last, scarcely one short
  week ago. Altogether I did not know what to say; so I wisely said nothing,
  but walked on, looking straight before me, with an uncomfortable feeling that
  I was driven into a corner, and should ere long be compelled to do that which
  is always distasteful to our liberty-loving sex&mdash;namely, to "make up my
  mind."</p>

  <p>John too walked on for a few paces in silence. We were at the corner of
  Lowndes Street. There was not a soul to be seen but our two selves. All at
  once he stopped short under the light of a lamp and looked me full in the
  face.</p>

  <p>"Kate," said he, in a grave, deliberate voice, "you know what I
  mean&mdash;Yes or No?"</p>

  <p>I shook like a leaf. What would I have given to have been able to take
  counsel of one of my own sex&mdash;Mrs. Lumley, Aunt Deborah, or even cold,
  pitiless Lady Horsingham! But I had to choose for myself. I felt that the
  turning-point of my destiny had arrived&mdash;that the game was in my own
  hand, and that now I ought to decide one way or the other. I shrank from the
  responsibility. Like a very woman, I adopted a middle course.</p>

  <p>"Give me time, John," I pleaded&mdash;"give me time to weigh matters over
  in my own mind. This is an affair that equally concerns the happiness of each
  of us. Do not let us decide in a hurry. Aunt Deborah was quite right: her
  wishes ought to be my law. When I am five-and-twenty it will be soon enough
  to enter on this subject again. In the interval, believe me, John, I have the
  greatest regard and esteem for you."</p>

  <p>"Nothing more, Kate," said John, looking as if he didn't know whether he
  was pleased or annoyed&mdash;"nothing but <i>esteem</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I mustn't say any more," was my reply; "but you know you have
  <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>John's face brightened considerably. "And in the meantime, Kate," he
  urged, "you won't allow yourself to be entangled with any one else?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," was my vigorous disclaimer; and by this time we had
  arrived at my aunt's door, and it was time to say good-night.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Kate?" exclaimed Mrs. Lumley, when I called to lunch
  with her the following day, according to promise. "You look pale and worried.
  For goodness' sake tell me what has happened. Have you found out <i>the
  rover</i> transferring his adoration to Miss Molasses? or did <i>mon
  cousin</i> take advantage of the hour and the opportunity to lecture us last
  night on our love of admiration and general levity of conduct? Tell me all
  about it, dear. We shan't be disturbed. I'm not 'at home' to a soul; and my
  old man is busy dissecting an earwig, so he's quite safe till dinner-time.
  Sit you down on the sofa, out with your pocket-handkerchief, and make a clean
  breast of it!"</p>

  <p>I told her the whole of my conversation with my cousin the previous night,
  only suppressing the unflattering opinions he had thought fit to express of
  my present <i>confidante</i>. "And oh, Mrs. Lumley," I exclaimed as I
  concluded, "how could I sleep a wink last night, with all this to harass and
  reproach me? No wonder I'm pale and worried and perfectly miserable. I feel
  I'm behaving shamefully to John, and not at all rightly towards Captain
  Lovell. I know I ought to come to an understanding with my cousin, and that
  Frank ought to be more explicit with me. I couldn't have given a decided
  answer last night if my life had depended on it. I can't give up the one
  without knowing exactly whether he means honestly (if I thought he did, Mrs.
  Lumley, nothing should induce me to throw him over); and I don't like to make
  the other miserable, which I am sure I should do if I refused him
  point-blank; nor do I think I could do at all well without him, accustomed as
  I have been to depend upon him for everything from childhood. So I have
  wavered and prevaricated, and behaved disingenuously, almost falsely; and
  what must he think of me now?"</p>

  <p>"Think of you, my dear?" replied my worldly friend; "why, of course, he
  thinks of you more than ever. There is nothing like uncertainty, Kate, to
  keep them well up to the collar. You should always treat men like the beasts
  of the field. If you want to retain the upper hand of him, ride an adorer as
  you do Brilliant, my dear&mdash;a light hand, with just enough liberty to
  make him fancy he is going quite at his ease; and then, when he is getting a
  little careless and least expects it, give him such a jerk as makes his fine
  mouth smart again. He'll wince with the pain, and very likely rear straight
  on end; but he'll be all on his haunches well under control, and go on much
  the pleasanter during the rest of the day. Never mind how much they suffer;
  it's very good for them, and they will like you all the better for it."</p>

  <p>"That may answer very well with some," I replied, "but I should be afraid
  to try the experiment too often. I am sure Brilliant would break away
  altogether if I used <i>him</i> so. And I think the very man that minds it
  most would be the least likely to stand a repetition of such treatment. No,
  Mrs. Lumley; I fear I must now choose between Frank and my cousin. The latter
  has behaved honourably, considerately, and kindly, and like a thorough
  gentleman. The former seems to think I am to be at his beck and call, indeed,
  whenever he chooses. He has never been to see me during the whole of this
  past week. At Dangerfield he was as little careful of my reputation as he was
  of his own limbs. Did I tell you how nearly drowned he was, crossing the
  moat? How you would have laughed, you wicked, unfeeling woman, if you had
  heard the splash that cold, snowy night! And then to disguise himself like a
  tramp, and stop those runaway ponies at the risk of his life, that he might
  speak three words to me before I went away. I will say for him that he is
  afraid of nothing; but I cannot conceal from myself which has behaved best
  towards <i>me</i>. And yet, Mrs. Lumley," I concluded, rising and walking off
  to the window, "I would rather have Frank for a lover than Cousin John for a
  husband."</p>

  <p>"Many people would suggest there was no impossibility in your having both;
  but I don't give such bad advice as that," replied Mrs. Lumley. "However,
  Kate, do nothing in a hurry&mdash;that's my counsel. I grant you, I think
  Master Frank a very slippery gentleman. I do know some <i>curious</i> stories
  about him; but I never tell tales out of school. In the meantime you are,
  after all, only suffering from an <i>embarras de richesses</i>; it's far
  better to have too many suitors than none at all. Come, I'll take you out
  shopping with me till five; then we'll have some tea, and you can go home
  quietly to dinner and ask Aunt Deborah's leave to join me at the French play.
  I've got a capital box, and I'll send the carriage for you. Wait half a
  second, whilst I put on my bonnet."</p>

  <p>So we went off shopping, and we had our tea, and I found no objections
  from Aunt Deborah to my going out again in the evening; and I was so restless
  I did not the least grudge the trouble of dressing, or anything to take me
  away from my own thoughts. But all the afternoon and all the evening I made
  up my mind that I would give up Frank Lovell. A little resolution was all
  that was needed. It was plain he did not <i>really</i> care for me. Why, he
  wasn't even in London, though he knew quite well I had been there more than a
  week. Very likely I shouldn't see him all the winter, and my heart sank as I
  thought how much easier this would make my sacrifice. At all events, I
  determined, when I did see him, to be cold, and demure, and unmoved&mdash;to
  show him unmistakably that I belonged to another; in which Spartan frame of
  mind I betook myself to the French play.</p>

  <p>Alas, alas! Well may the bard complain,&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"Woman's vows are writ in water;<br>
  Woman's faith is traced in sand."</p>

  <p>Who should be in the back of the box but Frank Lovell himself! Mischievous
  Mrs. Lumley, was this your doing? Before I went away I had promised to meet
  him next morning in the park, and he was to <i>explain all</i>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

  <p class="first">I hope I have as much command of countenance as falls to the
  lot of any lady who don't paint; but when I returned from my walk in the Park
  the following morning I must have looked flushed or excited, or in some way
  different from usual. I met John at the corner of Lowndes Street, and he
  stopped short, and looked me piercingly in the face.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been, Kate?" said he, without waiting to bid me
  "good-morning" or anything.</p>

  <p>"A little stroll in the Park, John," was my reply.</p>

  <p>"By yourself?" he asked, and his face looked pale and grave.</p>

  <p>I cannot tell a story, so I hesitated and stammered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No, not exactly&mdash;at least I met an acquaintance near the
  Serpentine."</p>

  <p>"Have you any objection to telling me who it was?" said John, and his
  voice sounded very strange.</p>

  <p>"Good gracious! what's the matter?" I asked, in my turn. "Has anything
  happened? Are you ill, John? you look quite upset."</p>

  <p>"I insist upon knowing," answered he, without taking the slightest notice
  of my tender inquiries after his health.</p>

  <p>"Did you or did you not meet Captain Lovel this morning in Hyde Park?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I certainly <i>did</i> meet him," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Accidentally?" exclaimed my cousin.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;no&mdash;not entirely," was my answer; "but the fact
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Enough!" burst out John, breaking in upon my explanations with a rudeness
  I had never before seen him exhibit. "Kate, I have been deceived in you. I
  thought at least you were candid and straightforward: I find you faithless,
  ungrateful, ungenerous! But I will not reproach you," he added, checking
  himself by a strong effort: "it is only natural, I conclude, for a woman to
  be false. I thought you were different from the rest, and I was a fool for my
  pains. Kate, let us understand each other at once. I offered you last night
  all that man could give. I had a right to expect an answer then and there. I
  <i>thought</i> I had a favourable one, and I have spent twelve hours of
  happiness. I now see that I have deceived myself. Perhaps I value my own
  worth too highly; I own I feel sore and aggrieved, but <i>you</i> shall not
  be the sufferer. Kate, I am only 'Cousin John' once more. Give me a few days
  to get over a natural disappointment, and you and I will be friends and
  playfellows as we used to be. Shake hands, Kate: I spoke harshly, in a moment
  of anger; it is over now. God bless you, dear!"</p>

  <p>And with these words John walked away, and left me standing on that
  eventful doorstep which seemed to witness all the changes and chances of my
  life. How stately was his walk as he strode down the street! I watched him
  all the way to the corner, but he never once looked back. John was grown much
  handsomer of late; he used to be too ruddy and prosperous-looking and boyish,
  but his countenance had altered considerably in the last two or three
  months&mdash;only, seeing him every day, I did not remark the change. Lady
  Scapegrace had found it out the first. I perfectly remember her saying to me,
  on the day of our Greenwich dinner,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My dear, your cousin has a great deal in him, if one did but know how to
  get it <i>out</i>. You have no idea what a good-looking man he would be, if
  you could only succeed in making him ill and unhappy."</p>

  <p>Poor John! I am afraid I had made him unhappy, even now. It struck me he
  had a nobler bearing than Captain Lovell himself; although, of course, I
  could not think him so graceful, or so handsome, or half so charming as my
  dear Frank. I rushed into the house and locked myself in my boudoir, to think
  over and dwell upon the many events of that most eventful morning&mdash;my
  happy walk, my delightful companion, whose soft voice was still whispering in
  my ear, whose every look and gesture I could recall, even to the wind
  freshening his handsome brow and waving his clustering locks. How happy and
  contented I felt by his side! And yet, there was a something. I was not
  satisfied; I was not thoroughly at ease; my cousin's face would intrude
  itself upon my thoughts. I could not get out of my head the tone of manly
  kindness and regret in which he had last addressed me. I reflected on his
  sincerity, his generosity, his undeviating fidelity and good-humour, till my
  heart smote me to think of all he suffered for my sake; and I began to wonder
  whether I was worthy of being so much cared for, and whether I was justified
  in throwing all this faith and truth away.</p>

  <p>Reader, have you ever lived for weeks and weeks in a place which bored you
  to death? Have you learned to loathe every tree and shrub and hedge-row in
  the dreary landscape? Have you shivered up and down the melancholy walks, and
  yawned through the dull, dark rooms, till you began to think the hour never
  would arrive that was to restore you once again to liberty and light? And
  then, when the hour <i>has</i> come at last, have you been able to take your
  departure without some half-reproachful feeling akin to
  melancholy&mdash;without some slight shade of regret to think that much as
  you have hated it, you look upon it all now for the <i>last</i> time? Perhaps
  the sun breaks out and shines upon the old place as you catch your last
  glimpse. Ah! it never used to shine like that when you could see it from
  those windows every day; you almost wish your departure had been put off till
  the morrow; you think if you were back again, the walks would not be so very
  melancholy, the rooms no longer so dull and gloomy. You sigh because you are
  leaving it, and wonder at yourself for doing so. It is the same thing with
  friends, and more especially with those who would fain assume a tenderer
  title: we never know their value but by their loss.</p>

  <p>"If it wasn't for Frank," I began to think, "I really believe I might have
  been very happy with Cousin John. Of course, it's impossible now; and, as he
  says himself, he'll never be anything but a cousin to me. Poor John! he's a
  noble, true-hearted, unselfish, generous fellow."</p>

  <p>But to return to my walk. When a lady and gentleman meet each other by
  appointment, either at the edge of the Serpentine or elsewhere, their
  conversation is not generally of a nature to be related in detail, nor is it
  to be presumed that their colloquy would prove as interesting to the general
  public as to themselves. What I learnt of Frank's private history, his views,
  feelings, and intentions, on that morning, I may as well give in my own
  words, suppressing divers interruptions, protestations, and interjections,
  which, much as they added to its zest, necessarily rather impeded the course
  of the narrative, and postponed its completion till long after I ought to
  have been back at luncheon.</p>

  <p>Frank had been an only child, and spoiled as only children are in nine
  cases out of ten. His father was a peer's second son, and married a wealthy
  cotton-spinner's niece for the sake of her money, which money lasted him
  about as long as his own constitution. When he died, the widow was left with
  ten thousand pounds and the handsome, curly-pated, mischievous boy. She soon
  followed her husband. Poor thing, she was very fond of him, and he had
  neglected her shamefully. The boy went to his uncle&mdash;the peer, not to
  his uncle the mill-owner&mdash;to be brought up. Frank was consequently what
  the world calls a "well-bred one;" his name was in the <i>Peerage</i>, though
  he had a first cousin once removed who was but an industrious weaver. The
  peer, of course, sent him to Eton.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand pounds," said that judicious relative, "will buy him his
  commission. The lad's handsome and clever; he can play whist now better than
  my boy's private tutor. By the time his ten thousand's gone, we'll pick up an
  heiress for him. 'Gad! how like my poor brother he is about the eyes!"</p>

  <p>So Frank was started in life with a commission in the Light Dragoons, an
  extremely good opinion of himself, and as much of his ten thousand pounds as
  he had not already anticipated during the one term he spent at Oxford before
  he was rusticated. By the way, so many of my partners, and other young
  gentlemen with whom I am acquainted, have gone through this process, that it
  was many years before I understood the meaning of the term. For long I
  understood <i>rustication</i> to be merely a playful form of expression for
  "taking a degree;" and I was the more confirmed in this impression from
  observing that those who had experienced this treatment were spoken of with
  high respect and approbation by their fellow-collegians.</p>

  <p>What odd creatures young men are! I can understand their admiring prowess
  in field-sports and athletic pursuits, just as I could understand one's
  admiring a statesman, an author, an artist, or a successful man in any
  pursuit of life; but why they should think it creditable to get drunk, to run
  into debt, to set at defiance all the rules and regulations enacted for their
  own benefit, and to conduct themselves in unswerving opposition to the wishes
  of their nearest and dearest friends, and all to do themselves as much harm
  as possible, is more than I can comprehend. Girls are not wrong-headed like
  this. Where the son is the source of all the annoyance, and ill-humour, and
  retrenchment in a family, the daughter is generally the mainstay, and
  comfort, and sunshine of the whole house. When shall we poor women be done
  justice to? But to return to Frank. By his own account he was a gambler, of
  course. A man turned loose upon the world, with such an education as most
  English gentlemen deem befitting their sons, and without means to indulge the
  tastes that education has led him to acquire, is very likely to become
  so.</p>

  <p>As a boy, the example of his elders teaches him to look upon frivolous
  distinction as a great end and aim of life, whilst that of his comrades leads
  him to neglect all study as dry, to despise all application as "slow." At
  home he hears some good-looking, grown-up cousin, or agreeable military
  uncle, admired and commented on for being "such a capital shot," "such a good
  cricket-player," "such an undeniable rider to hounds," what wonder the boy
  grows up thinking that these accomplishments alone are the very essentials of
  a gentleman? At school, if he makes an effort at distinction in school-hours,
  he is stigmatized by his comrades as a "sap," and derided for his pursuit of
  the very object it is natural to suppose he has been sent there to attain.
  What wonder he hugs idleness as his bosom-friend, and loses all his powers of
  application in their disuse.</p>

  <p>Then come the realities of manhood, for which he is so ill prepared. In
  the absence of all <i>useful</i> knowledge and practical pursuits,
  <i>amusement</i> becomes the business of life. Human nature cannot be idle,
  and if not doing good, is pretty sure to be doing harm. Pleasure, excitement,
  and fashionable dissipation must be purchased, and paid for pretty dearly, in
  hard coin of the realm. The younger son, with his ten thousand pounds, must
  soar in the same flight, must "go as fast" as his elder brother with ten
  thousand a year. How is it to be done? Why, <i>of course</i>, he must
  <i>make</i> money, if he can, by betting and play. So it goes on smoothly
  enough for a time. The Arch-croupier below, they say, arranges these matters
  for beginners; but the luck turns at last. The capital is eaten into; the
  Jews are called in; and the young gentleman is ruined. Frank, I think, at
  this time was in a fair way of arriving pretty rapidly at the customary
  catastrophe. He had gone through the whole educational process I have
  described above, had been regularly and systematically "spoilt," was a
  habitual gambler, and a confirmed "dandy." The ladies all liked him much, and
  I confess I don't wonder at it. Always good-humoured, never sentimental (I
  hate a sentimental man), invariably well dressed, with a very good opinion of
  his own attractions, Frank could make himself agreeable in all societies. He
  had never been troubled with shyness as a boy, and in his manhood was as
  "cool a hand" as one would meet with often, even in London. Then he had
  plenty of courage, which made the men respect him; and, above all, was very
  good-looking&mdash;an advantage which, doubtless, has a certain weight even
  with <i>our</i> far-sighted and reflective sex.</p>

  <p>I never quite made out the rights of his <i>liaison</i>, or whatever
  people call it, with Lady Scapegrace; nor do I think his own account entirely
  satisfactory. He assured me that he met her first of all at a masked ball in
  Paris, that she mistook him for some one else, and confided a great deal to
  his ears which she would not have entrusted to any one save the individual
  she supposed him to be; that when she discovered her mistake she was in
  despair, and that his discretion and respect for her feelings had made her
  his fast friend for life. I cannot tell how this may be, but that they were
  great friends I have had reason to know too well. He declared, however, that
  he looked upon her "quite as a sister." I do not think, though she is always
  very kind to me, that I should exactly like her for a <i>sister-in-law</i>. I
  certainly have known Lady Scapegrace do most extraordinary things&mdash;such
  things as no other woman would be permitted to do without drawing down the
  abuse of the world. If she had been fair, and rosy, and pleasing, people
  would have scouted her; but she was dark, and stern, and commanding. The
  world was afraid of her, and it is very true that "in the world one had
  better be feared than loved." Scandal did not <i>dare</i> say all it thought
  of Lady Scapegrace; and if she brought Frank Lovell home in her carriage, or
  went to the opera alone with Count Coquin, or was seen, day after day,
  perambulating Kensington Gardens arm in arm with young Greenfinch of the Life
  Guards, instead of shouting and hissing, and, so to speak, <i>pelting</i> her
  off the stage, the world lifted its fingers to its lips, shrugged up its
  worldly shoulders, and merely remarked,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Always <i>was</i> very odd, poor woman! Hers has been a curious
  history&mdash;little cracked, I think, now&mdash;but what a handsome creature
  she was years ago, when I left school, before <i>you</i> were born, my
  boy!"</p>

  <p>Whatever may have been her carelessness of appearances and levity of
  manner, I think it was never for an instant supposed that she liked any human
  being half so much as she hated Sir Guy. Then, again, Sir Guy and Frank were
  fast friends, almost inseparable. They say Frank kept things right between
  the ill-assorted pair, and that his good offices had many a time interposed
  to prevent scenes of abuse and violence such as must have ended in a
  separation at least. I was not quite clear that Frank's regard for the
  coach-driving baronet was alone at the bottom of all this friendship. I
  cannot conceive two men much worse suited to each other; but Frank vowed,
  when I cross-questioned him on the subject, which I thought I had a right to
  do, that he was under the greatest possible obligations to Sir Guy, that the
  latter had even lent him money, and stood by him when such assistance was
  most valuable; and that he looked upon <i>him</i> as <i>a brother</i>, just
  as he looked upon her ladyship as a sister. It seems to have been quite a
  family party altogether. Frank warmed with the topic.</p>

  <p>"You will hear me talked about with all sorts of people, Kate," said he,
  as we took about our twentieth turn, each of which I had protested should be
  <i>the last</i>; "but the world is so officious and mischief-making, you must
  never believe a word it says. They know I am ruined, and they choose to
  decide that I must be making up to some wealthy young lady. As if <i>I</i>was
  a man to marry for money; as if I cared for anything on earth but
  <i>one</i>person, and <i>that</i> for the sake of her own dear self alone!
  You ask <i>me</i>about Miss Molasses; you declare I am continually riding
  with her, and dancing with her, and what you ladies call 'paying her
  attention'&mdash;that yellow lackadaisical miss! Do you think I would marry
  her if she had half a million? Do you think I could stand those sentimental
  airs, that smattering of learning, and affectation of being poetical, and
  romantic, and blue&mdash;I, who have only lately learned what a woman should
  be, and what a treasure such a woman is? No, no; I have known the whole
  family from a child; I can't quite stand the lady part of it, but old
  Molasses is a right good fellow, and one must be civil to them all. No, no,
  Kate; with my many faults, I am a very different person from what you seem to
  think. I have my hopes and wishes, certainly, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I can't possibly go on to relate the conclusion of Frank's rhapsody, but
  he took great pains to convince me that if there was ever a high-principled,
  pure-minded, much-injured individual, that exemplary character was the
  gentleman now walking by my side; and I was convinced, but at the same time
  not exactly satisfied. In thinking over the whole of our conversation, I
  could gather nothing very definite, nothing that led to any particular
  result, from it.</p>

  <p>One thing was clear to my mind, and that was at all events a gratifying
  reflection. Frank did not seem to be aware that I had any worldly prospects
  whatever: it was evident that if he liked me he liked me entirely for myself.
  I confess I should not wish to be a great heiress; I should always be
  fancying that it was the "fine eyes of my casket," as the French say, which
  attracted my admirers, and I could not stand that. No, Frank was not
  mercenary, I was sure, and if even&mdash;why the competency I should be
  possessed of would be an agreeable surprise. If, indeed! Nothing was clear,
  nothing was settled. What a fool I was to dwell so upon an uncertainty, to
  anchor my hopes upon a dream! I was not at all comfortable that afternoon:
  the more I thought, the more I walked about my boudoir in a state of high
  fidget and restlessness. One thing, however, was consolatory&mdash;the frost
  was breaking. Already in London it was a decided thaw, and I went to pay
  Brilliant a visit in the stable.</p>

  <p>Now I dare say I shall be considered very bold and unladylike, and
  <i>unfeminine</i>&mdash;that's the word&mdash;for owning that I do indeed
  enjoy paying my favourites a visit in their comfortable quarters. It's worth
  a good deal to see Brilliant's reception of me when I approach his stable.
  From the instant I enter his abode and he hears my voice, he begins to move
  restlessly to and fro, whisking his dear tail, cocking his ears, and pawing
  up his "litter," till indeed that word alone describes the state to which he
  reduces his bed; then when I go up to him he lays back his ears with sheer
  delight, and gives a jump, as if he was going to kick me, and whisks that
  thin tail about more than ever. I lay my cheek to his smooth soft skin, and
  he nestles his beautiful head in my arms, and pokes his pretty muzzle into my
  pockets, and seems to ask for bits of bread and sugar and other delicacies,
  all of which are conferred upon him forthwith. I am sure he has more sense
  than a dog, and a great deal more affection than most men. I don't care how
  <i>slang</i> and "bad style" people may think me, but I feel every one of
  those strong flat black legs, and look into his hoofs, hind-feet and all, and
  turn his rug up to see that he has been properly cleaned and treated as he
  deserves; for I <i>love</i> Brilliant, and Brilliant loves me. It has
  sometimes been my lot to have an aching heart, as I conclude it is the lot of
  all here below. Like the rest of my fellow-creatures, I have been stung by
  ingratitude, lacerated by indifference where I had a right to expect
  attachment; or, worst of all, forced to confess myself deceived where I had
  bestowed regard and esteem. When I feel sore and unhappy on any or all of
  these points, nothing consoles and softens me so much as the affection of a
  dumb animal, more particularly a horse. His honest grave face seems to
  sympathize in one's grief, without obtruding the impertinence of curiosity or
  the mockery of consolation. He gives freely the affection one has been
  disappointed in finding elsewhere, and seems to stand by one in his brute
  vigour and generous unreasoning nature like a true friend. I always feel
  inclined to pour my griefs into poor Brilliant's unintelligent ears, and many
  a tear have I shed nestling close to my favourite, with my arms round him
  like a child's round its nurse's neck. That very afternoon, when I had made
  sure there was no one else in the stable, I leaned my head against
  Brilliant's firm warm neck, and sobbed, like a fool as I was.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Gentlemen think it right to affect a contempt for stag-
  hunting, and many a battle have I had with Cousin John when he has provoked
  me by "pooh-poohing" that exhilarating amusement. I generally get the best of
  the argument. I put a few pertinent questions to him which he cannot answer
  satisfactorily. I ask him, "What is your principal object in going out
  hunting? Is it to learn the habits of the wild animal, or to watch the
  instinct of the hound that pursues him? Do you enjoy seeing a fox
  <i>walked</i> to death, as you call it, on a cold scenting day&mdash;or do
  you care for the finest hunting run that ever was seen in a woodland country?
  Have I not heard you say a hundred times, when questioned as to your morning
  sport, 'Oh, wretched! hounds never went any pace!&mdash;couldn't shake off
  the crowd&mdash;yes, we killed our fox; but the whole thing was dead slow?'
  or else exclaim, with a face of delight, 'The fastest thing I have seen for
  years! Eighteen minutes <i>up wind</i>, extra pace! not a soul but myself in
  the same field with them when they threw their heads up. Fox was <i>back</i>,
  of course, and we never recovered him, but it was by far the best gallop of
  the season?' It is evident to me that what you <i>like</i> is riding a good
  hunter fast over a stiff country&mdash;going a turn better than your
  neighbours, and giving your own skill that credit which is due to the
  superiority of your horse. You only consider the hounds as a fleeting object
  at which to ride; the fox as a necessary evil, without which all this
  'rasping' and 'bruising' and 'cutting down,' as you call it in your
  ridiculous jargon, cannot be attained. Why, then, do you waste so much
  energy, and money, and civility, and 'soft-sawder,' to preserve the vulpine
  race? Why don't you all hunt with stag-hounds, or, better still, devote
  yourselves to a drag, when you may gallop and jump and bustle about, and
  upset your horses, and break your own necks to your heart's content?" To all
  of which John answers, as men invariably do when they are worsted, that
  "women can't enter into these things, and I am talking great nonsense about
  what I don't understand."</p>

  <p>However, let him despise "the calf," as he termed it, as much as he liked,
  I was not going to be stewed up in London, with the wind at south-west, the
  thermometer 45 , and the mud over one's ankles, whilst Brilliant and White
  Stockings were eating their heads off in the stable, so I took advantage of
  John's good nature to exact a promise that he would take me down and show me
  her Majesty's stag-hounds in the field; and on the express stipulation that
  Mrs. Lumley should join our party, and that we should confine ourselves
  religiously to the lanes, I was promised the enjoyment of a day's hunting.
  John did everything I asked him now; he was even kinder than he used to be;
  but it was a different sort of kindness, and it cut me to the heart.</p>

  <p>Still, the idea was enchanting: the Great Western made a delightful
  cover-hack. We sent our horses on by the early train. The place of meeting
  was scarcely three miles from the station, so we had time to settle ourselves
  comfortably in the saddle, and to avoid the fuss and parade of two ladies in
  their habits stepping out of a first-class carriage into the midst of a
  metropolitan field. I ran my eye jealously over the brown mare as Mrs. Lumley
  jogged quietly along by my side, and I confess I had my misgivings whilst
  contemplating the easy pliant seat and firm graceful figure of her mistress,
  the strong lengthy frame and beautiful proportions of the mare herself; but
  then Brilliant felt so light and elastic under me, the day was so soft and
  fresh, the country air so fragrant, and the dewdrops sparkling so brilliantly
  on the leafless hedges, that my courage rose with my spirits, and I felt as
  if I could ride anywhere or do anything in sheer gladness of heart.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jones is very strict," said my companion, taking the brown mare
  lightly on the curb, and putting her into a canter along a level piece of
  sward by the roadside; "he declares he only takes charge of us under the
  solemn promise that there is to be no <i>jumping</i>. For my part, I never do
  what I am told, Kate; do you?"</p>

  <p>"I always do as I like with John," said I; "but then I always
  <i>like</i>to do what he wishes."</p>

  <p>My cousin's sorrowful smile almost brought the tears into my eyes.</p>

  <p>"I dare say he's quite right," rejoined Mrs. Lumley. "For my part, I've no
  nerves left now. If you'll promise not to jump, I'll promise too. What say
  you, Kate&mdash;is it a bargain?"</p>

  <p>"Agreed," I replied; and just then a turn in the lane brought us into full
  view of the meet of her Majesty's stag-hounds.</p>

  <p>What a motley assemblage it was! At first I could not catch a glimpse of
  the hounds themselves, or even the servants, for the crowd, mostly of
  foot-people, that surrounded them. Where did these queer-looking pedestrians
  come from? They were not agricultural labourers; they were not townspeople,
  nor operatives, nor mechanics; they were the sort of people that one never
  sees except on such an occasion as this. I believe if I was in the habit of
  attending low pigeon matches, dog fights, or steeplechases, in the "Harrow
  County," I should recognize most of them enjoying the spectacle of such
  diversions. One peculiarity I remarked amongst them, with scarcely an
  exception. Although in the last stage of shabbiness, their clothes had all
  been once of fashionable texture and good material; but they entirely
  neglected the "unities" in their personal apparel. A broadcloth coat, much
  the worse for wear, was invariably surmounted by a greasy cap; whilst he who
  rejoiced in a beaver, usually battered in at the crown and encircled by a tag
  of threadbare crape, was safe to have discarded his upper garment, and to
  appear in his waistcoat and shirt-sleeves. A wiry sweep, in the full uniform
  of his profession, was by far the most respectable-looking personage of the
  lot. They clustered round the pack, and seemed to make remarks, more or less
  sarcastic, amongst themselves. As they opened out a little, I observed a very
  aristocratic-looking old man, clad in most gorgeous apparel of scarlet and
  gold, and seated on a remarkably handsome, powerful horse, long and low, with
  great strength in small compass, and to all appearance quite
  thoroughbred.</p>

  <p>"That's the huntsman," said Mrs. Lumley, who kindly undertook to be my
  cicerone, for she often enjoyed "a day with the Queen's," and was quite at
  home here; "he'll be so glad to see me. We're great friends. If you like,
  Kate, I'll introduce you."</p>

  <p>I declined the honour as rather too public. "But," said I, "do tell me who
  is in that green carriage with its back to us. Is it Prince Albert?" Mrs.
  Lumley laughed.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly, my dear," she replied; "that's the calf! Come a little this
  way; and when they open the door we shall see him bounce out." So we edged
  our horses off to a spot at which the foot-people were already beginning to
  congregate, and sat there quietly anticipating the "enlargement of the
  deer."</p>

  <p>"What are we waiting for now?" I asked at length, when my patience was
  nearly worn out. "Why don't we begin?"</p>

  <p>"The Master of the Buck hounds, of course," replied my cicerone. "He's not
  come yet. You know, Kate, it's a political appointment, and they generally
  give it to somebody who hates hunting, and particularly stag-hunting, more
  than anything; so, of course, he wisely comes as late and goes home as early
  as he can. But this man is a good sportsman and a thorough gentleman, and
  very fond of it too, so we shall not have to wait much longer."</p>

  <p>In fact, the words were hardly out of her mouth before a carriage-and-four
  drove up containing three very gentleman-like, good-looking men, "got up" to
  the utmost extent of hunting splendour, and looking the very personification
  of that dandyism which Melton engrafted upon London would be likely to
  produce. When they were mounted, I am obliged to confess that those
  magnificent animals made Brilliant himself look small. By this time there was
  great excitement amongst the foot-people; and an official in gold lace, a
  sort of mounted beadle, riding up with a heavy-thonged whip, cleared a lane
  at the back of the cart which I had so erroneously imagined to contain the
  Prince Consort. The doors flew open, and I was all eyes to witness the
  magnificent sight of "the monarch of the waste" leaping forth into the
  sunshine, exulting in his freedom. Shall I confess that I was somewhat
  disappointed?</p>

  <p>A neutral-coloured beast, something like a donkey, bundled out in a
  clumsy, unwilling sort of manner, and on his egress commenced cropping the
  grass with the utmost <i>sang froid</i> and placidity. My friend the sweep
  threw his cap at him. He raised his head, shorn of its branching honours,
  and, after staring about him, trotted quietly off amongst the spectators,
  closely followed by two well-mounted officials, termed, I believe, "flappers"
  by disrespectful sportsmen, but whose duty, it appears, is to keep the chase
  in view till it either beats them off for pace, or leaves them "planted" at
  some large awkward impediment, the latter obstacle generally presenting
  itself in about three fields. On this occasion I saw the deer trot quite
  composedly up to a high thorn fence of at least six feet, and clear it
  without an effort; whereon its pursuers, looking blandly around for gate or
  gap, and finding none, prudently returned to their fellow-officials in
  scarlet and gold lace&mdash;I conclude, to report upon their own
  inefficiency. In the meantime nobody seemed to be in a hurry; there was,
  indeed, some slight stir among the equestrians; but there was no throwing
  away of cigars, no drawing of girths and taking up of curb-chains&mdash;none
  of the bustle and confusion created by the departure of a wild fox over a
  grass country. On the contrary, every one here seemed to know exactly how
  much time he had to spare. We ladies were naturally the most impatient of the
  throng. Presently the huntsman looked at his watch, and said something to the
  noble master, who looked at his, and replied, "I think we may begin."</p>

  <p>There was a slight bustle among the "knowing ones;" two or three officers
  of the Life Guards stole forward a few paces; one of the officials cracked
  his whip; and ere I knew exactly what had happened, the hounds were streaming
  away over an adjoining field, "heads up and sterns down," running perfectly
  mute, but at a pace which would have astonished my old friends of the
  Heavytop country to no small extent. Several desperate speculators were
  making frightful efforts for a start. Two of the Life Guardsmen were settled
  with the hounds, and the third <i>would</i> have been, had he not been
  "turned over" by an uncompromising flight of rails. Four London dealers and a
  young Berkshire farmer were flourishing about, determined to show their
  horses whilst they were fresh; the noble Master and his aristocratic friends
  were pounding down a lane running parallel to the line of chase. Mrs. Lumley
  was getting excited, and the Gitana reared straight on end. Brilliant was
  fighting most disagreeably with his bridle, and John nervously endeavouring
  to quiet our horses, and prevail on ourselves to submit to his guidance. We
  <i>did</i> follow him into the lane; but here what a scene of confusion it
  was! Mild equestrians, much at the mercy of their infuriated steeds; hot
  foot-people, springing out of the way of the charging squadrons, and
  revenging themselves for threatened annihilation by sarcastic jeers, not
  altogether undeserved.</p>

  <p>"Give me a lead, sir!" implored a good-looking light-weight&mdash;who was
  evidently not in his usual place, and most anxious to get out of the
  lane&mdash;to a fat, jolly old sportsman in a green coat and brass buttons on
  a stiff bay horse.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," said the good-natured man; and turned his horse short at
  the fence, closely followed by the gentleman he was so ready to oblige. The
  bank was rotten and the bay horse unwilling. As might have been expected, the
  green coat kissed mother earth, whilst his own horse and his pursuer and his
  pursuer's horse rolled about on the top of him in a most complicated game of
  all-fours. As they picked each other up, I heard the fat man in green, much
  to my astonishment, apologizing for the accident with the greatest
  <i>empressement</i>.</p>

  <p>"A thousand pardons, my dear sir! How could I be so clumsy? It might have
  been a most serious accident!" All of which excuses the aggressor, as was to
  be expected, received with boundless affability and good-humour. In the
  meantime we had a beautiful view of the run. The hounds were still streaming
  away, two fields in front of every one; the huntsman and the two officers
  going gallantly abreast in their wake. One of them reminded me a little of
  Frank Lovell. The noble Master, too, had cut in, and was striding along over
  every obstacle; the London dealers had dropped somewhat in the rear, and the
  farmer's horse was already completely sobered by the pace. The hounds turned
  towards us. John entreated us to stop. They crossed the lane under our
  horses' heads, and taking up the scent in the adjoining pasture, went off
  again at score&mdash;not a soul <i>really</i> with them.</p>

  <p>"Flesh and blood can't stand this!" exclaimed Mrs. Lumley as, turning the
  Gitana short round at a high stile with a foot-board, she landed lightly in
  the field. "Don't attempt it, Kate!" she screamed out to me, half turning in
  her saddle. I heard John's voice too, raised in expostulation, but it was too
  late. I was already in the air. I thought Brilliant never would come to the
  ground; and when he did touch it, he was so excited with his previous
  restraint and his present position, that he broke clean away with me. I was a
  little frightened, but I never lost my nerve. I flew past Mrs. Lumley like an
  arrow; and though she put the Gitana to her speed, and made my horse more
  violent still as she thundered close upon his quarters, I was too proud to
  ask her to give me a pull, and a wicked, jealous feeling rose in my heart
  that was an excellent substitute for true courage at the time. My horse was
  almost frantic; but fortunately he knew my voice, and by speaking to him I
  was able to steady him before we reached the fence. He bounded over it like a
  deer, and went quite quietly, now that he had nothing before him but the
  hounds. I had never known till now what it was to ride for myself. Hitherto I
  had always followed a leader, but henceforth I resolved to enjoy the true
  pleasure of finding my own way. I looked back. I was positively <i>first</i>,
  but Mrs. Lumley was not fifty yards behind me, and coming up rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Well done, Kate!" said she as we flew our third fence side by side. Still
  the hounds fleeted on, and I never took my eye off them, but urged my horse
  in their wake, taking every turn they did, and swerving from nothing.
  Fortunately, Brilliant was thoroughbred and the fences light, or, even with
  my weight, such a style of riding must soon have produced fatal results. I
  shall never go again as well as I did that day; but do what I would I could
  not shake off Mrs. Lumley. If I lost sight of her for an instant, she was
  sure to gain a turn upon me, and on one or two occasions she was actually in
  my front. I felt I could have ridden into a chalk pit, and <i>dared</i> her
  to follow me with the greatest satisfaction. At last the hounds checked; we
  stood alone with them; I felt almost delirious with the excitement.</p>

  <p>"What an example we have made of <i>the gentlemen</i>, Kate," said Mrs.
  Lumley, turning the Gitana's head to the wind. "I had no idea <i>you</i>
  could ride like this."</p>

  <p>I did not answer, but I thought "Wait a little, and I'll show you." I felt
  I <i>hated</i> her, though she <i>was</i> my friend. Again the hounds stooped
  to the scent; they crossed a deep narrow lane, up which I saw the crowd
  advancing. I put my horse into his pace.</p>

  <p>"You can't go there, Kate," vociferated Mrs. Lumley. "This way; here's a
  gate in this corner."</p>

  <p>I clenched my teeth, and rode straight for the fence. It looked dark and
  forbidding. I did not see <i>how</i> it was to be done, but I trusted to
  Brilliant, and Brilliant nearly did it&mdash;but <i>not quite</i>. There was
  a loud crash; one of my pommels gave me an awkward dig in the side. I saw the
  white star on my horse's forehead shoot below me; and the muddy, gravelly
  lane seemed to rise in my face and rasp my hands and smear my habit, and get
  conglomerated with my hair. The horsemen were all round me when I got up. I
  did not care for my accident; I did not care for being bruised&mdash;in fact,
  I did not know whether I was hurt or not&mdash;but my prevailing feeling was
  one of burning shame and horror as I thought of my dress. To have had a fall
  amongst all those men! I could have sunk into the earth and thanked it for
  covering me. But there was no lack of sympathy and assistance. The huntsman
  pulled up; the noble Master offered me his carriage to go back to London;
  everybody stopped to tender advice and condolences.</p>

  <p>"The lady's had a fall."&mdash;"Give the lady some sherry."&mdash;"Catch
  the lady's horse."&mdash;"Can we render the lady any assistance?" John, of
  course, was much distressed and annoyed, but glad to find I was not seriously
  hurt. Mrs. Lumley only stood aloof and sneered. "I told you not to ride
  there, Kate," said she; "and what a fall you've had&mdash;amongst all these
  people, too!" She very nearly made me an enemy for life.</p>

  <p>I was too much hurt to go on. The stag was taken, as usual, in a large
  pond about a mile from where I met with my accident; but our party had had
  enough of hunting for one day. I am sure I had; and I think the Gitana was
  nearly beat, though her mistress would not confess it. We soon got back to
  the station, where I washed my face and put myself to rights. After all, I
  was very little the worse, and everybody said I had "gone like a bird." As we
  returned to London by the fast train, and I sat in that comfortable,
  well-cushioned carriage, enjoying the delightful languor of rest after
  fatigue, I half resolved to devote my whole life to a sport which was capable
  of affording such thrilling excitement as that which I had so recently
  enjoyed. I had never been so happy, I thought, in my existence as whilst I
  was leading the field on my dear Brilliant. It was a pure, wholesome,
  legitimate excitement; there were no harassing doubts and fears, no wounded
  feelings and bitter thoughts, no hours and days of suspense and misery to
  atone for a few short moments of delight. If I was disappointed in other
  things, could I not devote myself wholly to hunting, and so lead a happy and
  harmless life? If I had been a man, I should have answered in the
  affirmative; but I am a woman, and gradually softer thoughts stole over me. A
  distant vision of a happy home, with home-interests and
  home-pleasures&mdash;others to love, others to care for, besides
  myself&mdash;all a woman's duties, and all a woman's best delights. I shut my
  eyes and tried to realize the picture. When I opened them again, Mrs. Lumley
  had gone fast to sleep; but John was watching me with a look of painful
  attention. He certainly had acquired a very earnest, keen look of late, such
  as he never used to wear. I do not know what prompted the question, but I
  could not forbear asking him, in a sort of half-laughing way, "John, if I had
  broken my neck to-day, what on earth should you have done?"</p>

  <p>"Mourned for you <i>as a sister</i>, Kate," he replied gravely, even
  severely. I did not speak another word the whole way home.</p>

  <p class="first">SHALL miss you sadly, Kate; but if you enjoy your visit I
  shall be quite satisfied."</p>

  <p>It was Aunt Deborah who spoke. Dear Aunt Deborah! I felt as if I had not
  been half attentive enough to her lately. I had selfishly been so taken up
  with my own thoughts and my own schemes that I had neglected my poor
  suffering relative, and now my heart smote me for my want of consideration.
  Aunt Deborah had not left the house since our return from Dangerfield. She
  looked worn and old, but had the same kind smile, the same measured accents
  as ever. Though she endured a good deal of pain and was kept in close
  confinement, she never complained: patient and quiet, she had a kind word for
  every one; and even her maid avowed that "missus's" temper was that of an
  angel. "Hangel," the maid called it, but it was perfectly true. Aunt Deborah
  must have had something very satisfactory to look forward to, or she never
  would have been so light-hearted. One thing I remarked, she was fonder of
  John than ever.</p>

  <p>"I won't go, my dear aunt," was my reply, for my conscience smote me hard.
  "I won't go; I don't care about it; I had much rather stay and nurse you
  here."</p>

  <p>But Aunt Deborah wouldn't hear of it.</p>

  <p>"No, no," said she, "my dear; you are at the right age to enjoy yourself.
  I don't know much about Scamperley, and I have a far more charitable opinion
  of Lady Scapegrace than the world in general; but I dare say you will have a
  pleasant party, and I can trust you anywhere with John."</p>

  <p>There it was, John again&mdash;always John&mdash;and I knew exactly what
  John thought of me; and it made me thoroughly despise myself. I reflected
  that if I were John, I should have a very poor opinion of my cousin; I should
  consider her silly, vacillating, easily deceived, and by no means to be
  depended upon; more than woman in her weaknesses, and less than woman in her
  affections. "What a character! and what a contempt he must have for me!"</p>

  <p>My cousin called to take me to the railway, and to accompany me as a
  chaperon on a visit to Sir Guy and Lady Scapegrace, who were, as usual,
  "entertaining a distinguished party of fashionables at their residence,
  Scamperley." By the way, what an odd phrase that same "entertaining" always
  sounds to my ear. When I learn that the Marquis of Mopes has been
  "entertaining" his friends, the Duke of Drearyshire, Count and Countess
  Crotchet, Viscount Inane, Sir Simon and Lady Sulkes, the Honourable Hercules
  Heavyhead, etc., etc., at his splendid seat, Boudoir Castle, I cannot refrain
  from picturing to myself the dignified host standing on his bald head for the
  amusement of his immovable visitors, or otherwise, forgetful of his usual
  staid demeanour, performing ludicrous antics, projecting disrespectful
  "larks," to woo a smile from those stolid countenances in vain! Sir Guy might
  be "entertaining," too, in this way, but hardly in any other. What a
  disagreeable man he was! although I could not help acknowledging his good
  nature in coming to fetch us from the station himself.</p>

  <p>As we emerged from the railway carriage, the first object that greeted my
  eyes was Sir Guy's great gaudy drag, with its three piebalds and a roan. The
  first tones that smote on my ear were those of his hoarse harsh voice (how it
  jarred upon my nerves!) in loud obstreperous welcome.</p>

  <p>"Thought you'd come by this train, Miss Coventry," shouted Sir Guy from
  the box, without making the slightest demonstration of descending; "laid
  Frank five to two on the event.&mdash;Done him again, hey, Frank&mdash;<i>I
  knew</i> what you'd be up to; brought the drag over on purpose. Now then,
  give us your hand; one foot on the box, one on the roller-bolt, and now
  you're landed. Jones, my boy, get up behind. I've sent the van for servants
  and luggage. 'Gad! what a pretty maid you've got. Let 'em go, and sit
  tight!"</p>

  <p>So we rolled smoothly out, the piebalds shaking their harness and trotting
  merrily along, the roan placed on the off-side, for the purpose of sustaining
  whatever amount of punishment our charioteer thought fit to inflict.</p>

  <p>Behold me, then, seated on the box of Sir Guy Scapegrace's drag! a pretty
  position for a young lady who, during the last month or two, had been making
  daily resolutions of amendment as to <i>slang</i> conduct and general levity
  of demeanour. How I hated myself, and loathed the very sight of <i>him</i>,
  as I looked at my companion. Sir Guy was redder and fatter than when I had
  seen him last; his voice was more dissonant, his neckcloth more alarming, his
  jewellery more prominent, his hat closer shaved and the flower in his mouth
  less like a flower than ever. How came I there? Why, because I was piqued,
  and hurt, and reckless. I was capable of almost any enormity. John's manner
  to me in the train had well-nigh driven me mad. So quiet, so composed, so
  cold, so kind and considerate, but a kindness and consideration such as that
  with which one treats a child. He seemed to feel he was my superior; he
  seemed even to soothe and pity me. I would have given worlds to have spoken
  frankly <i>out</i> to him, to have asked him what I had done to offend him,
  even to have brought him back to that topic upon which I felt he would never
  enter more. But it was impossible. I dared not wound that kind, generous
  heart again&mdash;I dared not trust <i>myself</i>. No, he was only "Cousin
  John" now; he had said so himself. Surely he need not have given me up quite
  so easily; surely I was worthy of an effort at least: yet I <i>knew</i> it
  had been my own fault&mdash;though I would not allow it even to
  myself&mdash;and this I believe it was that rankled and gnawed at my heart
  till I could hardly bear my own identity. It was a relief to do everything I
  could think of to annoy him. To heap self-contempt on my wicked head, to show
  him I was reckless of his good opinion as of my own, to lay up a store of
  agonizing reproaches for the future, to gnash my teeth, as it were, and nerve
  myself into a savage indifference for the present. Nay, there was even a
  diabolical <i>pleasure</i> in it. Frank Lovell occupied the seat behind me:
  at another time I might have been gratified at his near neighbourhood, and
  annoyed to think he should have been paying so long a visit to Scamperley. I
  was startled to find how little I cared. He leaned over and whispered to me
  occasionally, and seemed pleased with the marked encouragement I gave him.
  After all, I could not help liking Frank very much; and was not my cousin at
  the back of the coach, to witness all that took place? But Sir Guy would not
  allow me to be "monopolized," as he called it.</p>

  <p>"You've lost your roses sadly in London, Miss Coventry," said he, poking
  his odious face almost under my bonnet, and double-thonging the off-wheeler
  most unmercifully. "Never mind; I think a woman looks best when she is pale.
  Egad, you've more colour now, though. Don't be angry, it's only my way; you
  know I'm your slave."</p>

  <p>"Sir Guy don't <i>mean</i> to be rude," whispered Frank, for I confess I
  was beginning to get indignant; and the Baronet went on,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do you remember our picnic at Richmond, Miss Coventry, and my promise
  that if ever you honoured me by taking a place on my coach you should
  <i>drive</i>? Take hold of 'em now, there's a good girl; you ought to know
  something about the ribbons, and the next four miles is quite straight, and a
  dead flat."</p>

  <p>I was in that state of mind that I should not have had the least scruple
  in upsetting the coach and risking the lives of all upon it, my own included;
  but I know not what imp of evil prompted me to turn round and call to my
  cousin at the back,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"John, do you think I could drive four horses?"</p>

  <p>"Pray don't," whispered Frank Lovell, who seemed to disapprove of the
  whole proceeding; but I did not heed him, for my cousin never answered till I
  asked him again.</p>

  <p>"Do as you like, Kate," was his reply, "only I shouldn't advise you to
  try;" but he looked very grave, and seriously hurt and annoyed.</p>

  <p>This was enough for me. I laughed aloud. I was determined to provoke him,
  and I changed places with Sir Guy. He showed me how to part and hold the
  reins; he lectured me on the art of putting horses together; he got into a
  state of high good-humour, and smiled, and swore, and patronized me, and had
  the effrontery to call me a "d&mdash;d fine girl," and I never boxed his
  ears, though I confess to having been once or twice sorely tempted. In short,
  I flirted with him shamefully, and even Frank got grave and out of sorts. At
  last Sir Guy removed the flower from his mouth, and pulled out his
  cigar-case.</p>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">He showed me how to hold the reins.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Have a weed, Miss Coventry!" said he, with his detestable leer. "Of
  course you smoke; any one who can tool 'em along as you do <i>must</i> be
  able to smoke. Mine are very mild, let me choose one for you."</p>

  <p>I accepted his offer, though I had considerable misgivings as to whether
  it would not make me sick. I looked round to see how my cousin approved of
  all these goings on, and particularly this last cigar movement. He was
  sitting with his back to us, reading the morning newspaper, apparently
  totally indifferent to my proceedings. That decided me. I would have smoked
  now if there had been a barrel of gunpowder under my nose. I didn't care how
  sick it made me! I lit my cigar from Sir Guy's, I suffered him to put his
  horrid red face close to mine. I flirted, and laughed, and drove, and puffed
  away as if I had been used to these accomplishments all my life. I rattled
  through the turnpike without stopping to pay, as if it were a good joke. I
  double-thonged a sleeping carter over the face and eyes as I passed him. My
  near leader shied at a wheelbarrow, and I <i>almost</i> swore as I rated him
  and flanked him, and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Confound you, <i>I'll</i> teach you to keep straight!"</p>

  <p>As we drove into the Park at Scamperley&mdash;for I fearlessly rounded the
  avenue turn, and vowed I would not abandon the reins till I had delivered my
  load at the front door&mdash;even Frank was completely disgusted. My cousin
  took not the slightest notice, but kept his seat with his back turned to the
  horses, and was still deep in his newspaper. Sir Guy was delighted; he
  shouted, and grinned, and swore more than ever. I was a "trump"&mdash;I was a
  "girl of the right sort"&mdash;I was a "well-bred one"&mdash;I had no end of
  "devil" in me&mdash;I was fit to be a "queen!" Whilst the object of all these
  polished encomiums could willingly have burst out crying at a moment's
  notice; indeed, she would have found it an unspeakable relief; and felt as
  she had never felt before, and as she trusts in heaven she may never feel
  again.</p>

  <p>It was a lovely spot Scamperley&mdash;beautiful as a dream&mdash;with the
  quiet woodland beauty of a real English place. Such timber! Such an avenue! I
  wonder if any of the sporting dandies and thoughtless visitors who came down
  "to stay with Scapegrace" because he had more pheasants and better "dry"
  (meaning champagne) than anybody else ever thought of the many proprietors
  those old oaks and chestnuts had seen pass away, the strange doings they must
  have witnessed as generation after generation of Scapegraces lived their
  short hour and went to their account, having done all the mischief they
  could, for they were a wild, wicked race from father to son. The present
  Baronet's childhood was nursed in profligacy and excess. Sir Gilbert had been
  a fitting sire to Sir Guy, and drank, and drove, and sinned, and turned his
  wife out-of-doors, and gathered his boon companions about him, and placed his
  heir, a little child, upon the table, and baptized him, in mockery, with
  blood-red wine; and one fine morning he was found dead in his dressing-room,
  with a dark stream stealing slowly along the floor. They talked of "broken
  blood-vessels," and "hard living," and "a full habit;" but some people
  thought he had died by his own hand; and the dressing-room was shut up and
  made a lumber-room of, and nobody ever used it any more. However, it was the
  only thing to save the family. A long minority put the present possessor
  fairly on his legs again, and the oaks and the chestnuts were spared the fate
  that had seemed too surely awaiting them. Nor was this the only escape they
  had experienced. A Scapegrace of former days had served in the Parliamentary
  army during his father's lifetime; had gone over to the king at his death;
  had fought at Edgehill and Marston Moor&mdash;and to do Sir Neville justice,
  he could fight like a demon; had abandoned the royal cause when it was
  hopeless, and, by betraying his sovereign, escaped the usual fate and
  amercement of malcontent&mdash;the Protector remarking, with a certain solemn
  humour, "that Sir Neville was an instrument in the hand of the Lord, but that
  Satan had a share in him, which doubtless he would not fail to claim in due
  time." So Sir Neville lived at Scamperley in abundance and honour, and
  preserved his oaks and his rents, and professed the strictest Puritanism; and
  died in a fit brought on by excessive drinking to the success of the
  Restoration, when he heard that Charles had landed, and the king was really
  "to enjoy his own again." He was succeeded by his grandson Sir Montague, the
  best-looking, the best-hearted, and the weakest of his race. There was a
  picture of him hanging over against the great staircase&mdash;a handsome,
  well-proportioned man, with a woman's beauty of countenance, and more than
  womanly softness of expression. Lady Scapegrace and I have stopped and gazed
  at it for hours.</p>

  <p>"He's not very like the present Baronet, my dear," she would say, her
  haughty features gathering into a sneer&mdash;and Lady Scapegrace's sneer was
  that of Mephistopheles himself; "he is beautiful, exceedingly. I love to look
  at his hazel eyes, his low antique brow, his silky chestnut hair, and his
  sweet melancholy smile. Depend upon it, Kate, no man with such a smile as
  that is ever capable of succeeding in any one thing he undertakes. I don't
  care what his intellect may be, I don't care what animal courage he may
  possess, however dashing his spirit, however chivalrous his
  sentiments&mdash;so surely as he has woman's strength of affection, woman's
  weakness of heart, so surely must he go to the wall. I have seen it a hundred
  times, Kate, and I never knew it otherwise."</p>

  <p>Since the affair of the bull Lady Scapegrace had contracted a great
  affection for me, and would have me to roam about the house with her for
  hours. She was a clever, intellectual woman, without one idea or sentiment in
  common with her husband. In this state of mental widowhood she had consoled
  herself by study, amongst other things; and the history of the family into
  which she had married afforded her ample materials for reflection and
  research. She had collected every scrap of writing, every private memorandum,
  letter, and document that could throw any light upon the subject; and I
  verily believe she could have concocted a highly interesting volume,
  detailing the exploits and misdeeds, the fortunes and misfortunes, of the
  Scapegraces.</p>

  <p>"I know all about him, Kate," she would proceed, fixing her great hollow
  eyes upon my face, and laying her hand on my arm, as was her habit when
  interested. "He is my pet amongst the family, though I despise him
  thoroughly. You see that distant castle, sufficiently badly painted, in the
  corner of the picture? That was the residence of her who exercised such a
  fatal influence over the life of poor Sir Montague. All his little sonnets,
  some of them touching and pretty enough, are addressed to 'The Lady Mabel.' I
  have found two or three of his love-letters, probably returned by her, tied
  up in a faded bit of ribbon; there is also one note from the lady to her
  admirer; such a production, Kate! Not a word but what is misspelt, not a
  sentence of common grammar in the whole of it; and yet this was the woman he
  broke his heart for! Look well at him, my dear, and you will see why. With
  all its beauty, such a face as that was made to be imposed upon. The Lady
  Mabel, however, seems to have been a notable strong-minded personage enough.
  She acknowledges the receipt of her lover's letters; which, however, without
  condescending to give any further explanation, she avers 'came to hand at an
  untoward moment,' and finishes by sending him a receipt for making
  elderflower wine&mdash;assuring him, with a certain sly malice, that it is 'a
  sovereign specific against colic, vertigo, and all ailments of the heart and
  stomach!' What a contrast to his protestations endorsed, 'These, with
  haste&mdash;ride&mdash;ride&mdash;ride!' which many a good horse must have
  been spurred and hurried to deliver. How he rings the changes upon his
  unalterable and eternal devotion! How he implores 'his dear heart' never to
  forget him! and calls her 'his sweet life,' and protests that 'he welcomes
  the very night-breeze blowing from the castle, because it must have swept
  past the windows of his love!' and pours out his foolish heart like a child
  pouring water into a sieve. Lady Mabel, however, seems to have been proof
  against sentiment, as she undoubtedly was against good looks. From all that I
  can gather, she appears to have made use of her adorer in furtherance of
  sundry political schemes, such as were so numerous at that period, and to
  have thrown him away, like a rusty blade, when she had no further occasion
  for his services. I cannot help thinking she despised him thoroughly. There
  are certain bills and memoranda, with his signature attached, relating to
  levies of men and great purchases of arms, which look as if he had plunged
  into some desperate enterprise, doubtless at her instigation; and in his
  sonnets there are frequent allusions to 'winning her by the sword,' 'loving
  her to the death,' and such Quixotic protestations, that look as if he had at
  one time meditated an unusually daring stroke. He was a fool," said Lady
  Scapegrace reflectively, "but he was a fine fellow, too, to throw wealth,
  life, and honour at the feet of a woman who was not worth a throb of that
  kind, generous heart, a drop of that loyal, gallant blood!</p>

  <p>"Then he married, I can't quite make out why, as there is a considerable
  gap in the correspondence of the family about this time, only partially
  connected by the diary of an old chaplain, who seems to have been formerly
  tutor to Sir Montague, and to have cherished a great regard for his pupil.
  The lady was a foreigner and a Romanist; and although we have no picture of
  her, we gather from the reverend chronicler that she was 'low of stature,
  dark-browed, and swarthy in complexion,' though he gallantly adds that she
  was 'doubtless pleasing to the eyes of those who loved such southern beauty.'
  At the wedding it appears that Lady Mabel was present; and 'my good master's
  attire and ornaments,' consisting of 'peach-coloured doublet, and
  pearl-silken hose, and many gems of unspeakable price, dazzling to the sight
  of humble men,' are detailed with strange minuteness and fidelity. Even the
  plume in his hat and the jewelled hilt of his rapier are dwelt upon at
  considerable length. But notwithstanding his magnificence, the worthy
  chaplain did not fail to remark that 'my good master seemed ill at ease, and
  the vertigo seizing him during the ceremony, he must have fallen had I not
  caught him something cunningly under the arm-pits, assisted by worthy Master
  Holder and one of the groomsmen.' The chaplain, who seems to have been as
  blind as became his reverend character, cannot forbear from expressing his
  admiration of the Lady Mabel, whom he describes as 'fair and comely in
  colour, like the bloom of the spring rose; of a buxom stature, and of a lofty
  gait and gestures withal.' What was she doing at Sir Montague's wedding? No
  wonder the old attack of 'vertigo,' which her elderflower wine seems rather
  to have increased, should have come on again.</p>

  <p>"One thing is pretty clear, the Baronet detested his wife (the Scapegraces
  have generally owned that amiable weakness, my dear). I think it must have
  been in consequence of her religion that he became so strenuous a supporter
  of the opposite faith. At last he joined Monmouth, and still the
  correspondence seems to have gone on, for the night before Sedgmoor he wrote
  her a letter. Such a letter, Kate! I was lucky enough to get it from a
  descendant of the lady, who was under great obligations to me; I'll show it
  you to-morrow. No man with <i>that mouth</i> could have written such a
  letter, except when death was looking him in the face. I often think when she
  got it she must have given way at last. But it was too late. He was killed in
  the first charge made by the royal troops. His own regiment, raw recruits and
  countrymen, turned at the first shot; but he died like a Scapegrace, waving
  his hat and cheering them on. We are rather proud of him in the family, after
  all. Compared with the rest of them, his was a harmless life and a creditable
  end."</p>

  <p>"But what became of Lady Mabel?" I asked; for I confess I was a little
  interested in this disjointed romance of long-past days.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever know a thoroughly unfeeling person in your life that did not
  prosper?" was her ladyship's reply; and again her features writhed into the
  Mephistopheles' sneer. "Lady Mabel married an earl, and had sons and
  daughters, and lived to a green old age. I have seen a picture of her at
  fifty, and she was still 'fair and comely and buxom' as when she dazzled the
  old chaplain's eyes and broke Sir Montague's heart. Yes, yes, Kate, there's
  nothing like a <i>sensible</i> woman; she's the evergreen in the garden, and
  blooms, and buds, and puts forth fresh shoots, when the rose is lying
  withered and trampled into the earth; but for all that, she has never had the
  charm of the rose, and never can have."</p>

  <p>Such is a specimen of one of my many conversations with Lady Scapegrace,
  whom I liked more and more the better I knew her. But I have been
  anticipating sadly during my drive of Sir Guy's coach up Sir Guy's avenue.
  When I reached the front door, with all my recklessness, I felt glad to see
  no head poking out of windows&mdash;above all, no <i>female</i> witness to my
  unwomanly conduct. I felt thoroughly ashamed of myself as I got down from the
  box; and I confess it was with feelings of intense relief that a polite groom
  of the chambers informed me, with many apologies, "her ladyship and all the
  ladies had gone to dress," and handed me over, with a courtly bow, to a tidy
  elderly woman, in a cap that could only belong to a housekeeper. She
  conducted me to my room, and consigned me to Gertrude, already hard at work
  unpacking upon her knees.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

  <p class="first">A very pretty little room it was; none of your enormous
  dreary state-apartments, dull as a theatre in the daytime, with a bed like a
  mourning coach, and corners of gloom and mystery, uncomfortable even at noon,
  and fatal to the nerves when seen by the light of a solitary wax-candle. On
  the contrary, it was quite the room for a young lady: pink hangings tinted
  one's complexion with that roseate bloom which the poet avers is as
  indispensable to woman as "man's imperial front"&mdash;whatever <i>that</i>
  means&mdash;is to the male biped. A dark carpet with a rich border relieved
  the light-coloured paper, picked out sparingly with flowers; the toilet-table
  was covered with a blushing transparency of pink under white, like sunset on
  snow&mdash;perhaps I should rather say like a muslin dress over a satin slip;
  and there was a charming full-length glass, in which I could contemplate my
  whole person from top to toe, without slanting it an inch off the
  perpendicular. The lookout was into Lady Scapegrace's garden, a little
  <i>bijou</i> of a place, that bore ample witness to the good taste of its
  mistress. Every shrub had been transplanted under her own eye, every border
  filled according to her personal directions. She tied her own carnations, and
  budded her own roses, like the most exemplary clergyman's wife in England. I
  do believe she <i>would</i> have been a good wife to anybody but Sir Guy.</p>

  <p>However, it was too dark for me to see anything of her ladyship's garden.
  It was already getting dusk when we arrived, and although it wanted three
  mortal hours of dinner, all the ladies, including the hostess, had retired to
  their own rooms, to while away the time by writing letters, reading novels,
  and going to sleep. I was much too restless to embark in any of these
  occupations. It would have been a relief to write, certainly&mdash;to pour
  out all one's thoughts and feelings before some sympathizing correspondent;
  but I owned none such. I could not have settled to read, no, not the most
  interesting novel that was ever penned, although I might have left it off the
  day before in an agony of uncertainty at the critical place which is always
  to be found near the conclusion of the second volume; and as for
  sleep&mdash;sleep, indeed!&mdash;I felt as if I should never sleep again.</p>

  <p>When I am unhappy, and particularly when I am angry with myself, I must
  always be doing something&mdash;no matter what&mdash;but I <i>must</i> be
  occupied, so I hurried Gertrude, and bustled about, and got myself dressed,
  and found my own way to one of the drawing-rooms, where I hoped to be at
  least secure from interruption, and to brood and worry myself for an hour or
  two in unbroken solitude. I ought to have been safe enough here. As I had
  wandered through unknown passages and passed uncertain doors, I had heard the
  click of billiard balls, the sound of many voices, and the harsh laugh of Sir
  Guy; I knew consequently that the gentlemen were all busy at "pool," or some
  equally intellectual pastime, and had not yet gone to dress. I was
  sufficiently conversant with the habits of my own sex to be aware that no
  lady would willingly tarnish the freshness of her dinner toilette by coming
  down before the very last minute, and I anticipated therefore no further
  interruption than a housemaid coming to put the fire to rights, or a groom of
  the chambers to light fresh candles, functionaries, especially the former,
  who would be much more incommoded by my presence than I should be by theirs.
  Good gracious! there was a gentleman down and dressed already; sitting with
  his back to me, immersed in the thrilling pages of "The Drawing-Room Scrap
  Book," which he was studying upside-down. I came in very softly, and he never
  heard me, nor turned his head, but I knew the back of that head pretty well.
  It was Cousin John. I also took a book, and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," I thought, "he's not going to speak to me at all. Well, what do
  I care? I've a temper, too, if it comes to that."</p>

  <p>So I read my book assiduously; it was the "Comic Almanac," but I don't
  know that it made me feel very much inclined to laugh. The clock ticked loud
  and disagreeably. I determined not to speak till I was spoken to; but after a
  time the silence grew irksome, and the ticking of the clock so loud, that I
  ventured on a slight cough, merely to break it. "Ahem," said I, still intent
  on the "Comic Almanac." John turned slowly round, made a half rise, as if out
  of compliment to my presence, and returned to "The Drawing-Room Scrap Book,"
  which, however, he was now reading the right way. This would not do; I
  resolved to wait a little longer, just a quarter of an hour by the clock, and
  see whether he would not have the common civility to speak to me. What a long
  quarter of an hour it was! The hand reached it at last&mdash;it passed
  it&mdash;I gave him another five minutes. It was getting painful. I spoke,
  and the sound of my own voice quite startled me, yet was my remark as
  harmless and commonplace as well could be.</p>

  <p>"John," said I, "what time do we dine?"</p>

  <p>"A quarter before eight, I believe," answered John, quite good-humouredly,
  and as if nothing had happened to estrange us. "Dear me, Kate, how early
  you're dressed!"</p>

  <p>I could have cried with vexation; but I resolved, if possible, to find a
  sore place somewhere, and give him "one" before I had done with him; so I
  made a saucy face, and asked him, half laughing, whether "he didn't think I
  had driven them very well from the station?"</p>

  <p>"Inimitably, Kate," was his reply; "I hadn't the least idea you were so
  accomplished a charioteer."</p>

  <p>I should have burst into tears, I verily believe, but just then Lady
  Scapegrace sailed in, and the usual forms of society had to be gone through;
  and she kissed me, and shook hands with Mr. Jones, as if she really liked us;
  and we talked of the weather, and the shameful stoppages of the train we had
  come by, and the general inconveniences of railways; and presently more
  ladies came down, neat and crisp as if turned out of a bandbox, followed by
  their lords in choking white neckcloths; and then Sir Guy himself appeared in
  a costume of surpassing splendour; but still, although in his evening dress,
  brilliant with starch and polish and buttons and jewellery, looking like a
  coachman in masquerade; and "dinner" was announced, and we all paired off
  with the utmost ceremony, and I found myself seated between Frank Lovell and
  dear old Mr. Lumley, and opposite the elder Miss Molasses, who scowled at me
  with an asperity of which I should have believed her unmeaning face
  incapable, as if she hated me on this particular evening more than all the
  other days of the year. I soon discovered the cause. Frank was more attentive
  to me than I had ever known him, although there was a <i>something</i> in his
  manner that I did not altogether like, a sort of freedom that I had never
  remarked before, and which made me colder and more reserved than usual. It
  was evident he thought he might venture as far as he liked with a young lady
  who drove four horses and smoked a cigar the while. I felt I was blushing
  <i>under my skin</i>; but I was determined to brave it all out, to hide from
  every living soul my own vexation and self-contempt. Once I caught a
  telegraphic signal exchanged between my neighbour and Miss Molasses, after
  which she seemed more at ease, and went on with her dinner in comfort. I was
  so angry now that I turned my shoulder towards Master Frank, and took refuge
  with my dear old friend Mr. Lumley, who, utterly regardless of the noise and
  flirtation his better half was carrying on at the other end of the table,
  discussed his cutlet quite contentedly, and prosed away to me in his usual
  kind, consolatory manner. I was one of his great favourites; in fact, he told
  me so, then and there. He always called me "my dear," and often vowed that if
  he had only the use of his legs he would walk to the end of the world to make
  me a thoroughgoing naturalist like himself. I was getting more at ease under
  his dear old wing. I had gone through so much excitement during the day that
  this comparative inaction was a positive relief, and I was really beginning
  to enjoy a sort of repose, when the Baronet's horrid voice from the bottom of
  the table aroused me once more to an agony of shame and despite.</p>

  <p>"Do me the honour to drink a glass of champagne; the champagne to Miss
  Coventry!" shouted Sir Guy; "you must require it after your exertion. Egad!
  my team won't get over it in a hurry&mdash;the roads were woolly and the time
  short&mdash;hey, Miss Kate? But d&mdash;n me if the whipcord was scarce. I've
  done that seven miles in all weathers, and a sweet seven miles it is, but I
  never came anything like the pace we did to-day. Your good health, Miss Kate;
  I'll have a fresh team put together for you to-morrow, and a better cigar to
  smoke than the one I gave you to-day."</p>

  <p>I could willingly have sunk into the earth&mdash;nay, crept under the
  table-cloth&mdash;anything to hide my dishonoured head. The ladies looked at
  each other aghast, and then at <i>me</i>. The gentlemen, even the stiffest of
  them, turned boldly round to survey such a phenomenon as the tobacco-smoking,
  four-in-hand Miss Coventry. Mrs. Lumley showered her long ringlets all over
  her face with one toss of her pretty little head that I might not see how
  heartily she was laughing. Lady Scapegrace good-naturedly made an immense
  clatter with something that was handed to her, to distract attention from my
  unfortunate self; but I believe I must have got up and left the room had not
  Cousin John come adroitly to the rescue. He had not been studying the daily
  paper for nothing, and his voice rose loud and clear through the awful
  silence that succeeded Sir Guy's polished remarks.</p>

  <p>"Did you see that article in to-day's <i>Times</i> about Ministers?" asked
  John, of the public in general; "there's another split in the
  Cabinet&mdash;this time it's on the malt-tax. To-day, in the City, they were
  betting five to two there's a general election within a fortnight, and taking
  two to one Ambidexter is Premier before the first of next month."</p>

  <p>John! John! if you had saved my life I could not have been more obliged to
  you. Many of the present party were members of Parliament&mdash;all were deep
  in politics. Most of them had seen the Times, but none, like John, had the
  earliest intelligence from the City. I have since had reason to believe he
  invented every syllable of it. However, such a topic was too engrossing not
  to swamp every other, and no more allusions were made to my unfortunate
  escapade till Lady Scapegrace had drawn on her gloves, bent her haughty head,
  and "made the move," at which we all sailed away to tea and coffee in the
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>Here I was more at my ease. Lady Scapegrace and Mrs. Lumley, hating each
  other, were, of course, inclined to be excessively kind to me&mdash;I formed
  a bond of union between the foes. We three, particularly with such a weapon
  as the tongue of Mrs. Lumley, were more than a match for any number of our
  own sex, and most of the other ladies gave in at once. Only Miss Molasses
  held out, and eyed me once more with an expression of eager malice for which
  I could not easily account. I remarked, too, that she seemed restless and
  fidgety, glanced anxiously ever and anon at the door by which the gentlemen
  would join us, and seemed uncomfortable if any of us approached an empty
  chair which was next to her seat. I began to have my suspicions of Frank
  Lovell, notwithstanding all his asseverations. I determined to watch him
  narrowly; and <i>if</i> I found my misgivings were true&mdash;if I discovered
  he was false and treacherous, why, then, I would&mdash;after all, what
  <i>could</i> I do? It stung me to think how powerless I was.</p>

  <p>Now, the establishment of Scamperley, although doubtless the bonds of
  domestic discipline were by no means over-tightly drawn, was one in which
  servants, from the stately curly-headed "groom of the chambers," down to the
  little boy in green that was always too late for the post, had more than
  enough upon their hands. In the first place, nobody ever seemed to think of
  going to bed much before daylight. This entailed a breakfast, protracted by
  one late sleeper after another till luncheon-time; that meal was of unusual
  magnificence and variety; besides which, a hot repast, dressed by the French
  cook, and accompanied by iced champagne, etc., required to be served in one
  of the woods for the refreshment of Sir Guy's shooting guests. Then in the
  afternoon there were constant fresh arrivals and rooms to be got ready; for
  when the host and hostess were at home they kept the house full, and the day
  concluded with a large dinner-party, at which seldom less than sixteen sat
  down to discuss the inspirations of Monsieur Horsd'oeuvre and the priceless
  wines of Sir Guy. No wonder the servants looked tired and overworked, though
  I fancy the luxury and good living <i>downstairs</i> was quite equal to that
  which elicited encomiums from <i>bon-vivants</i> and connoisseurs above.
  Nevertheless, it was but just that they too should have their share of
  relaxation and amusement; therefore did Sir Guy in his generosity give an
  annual servants' ball, which he attended and opened himself in a state of
  hilarity not calculated to inspire much respect amongst his retainers. He
  had, however, sufficient self-command invariably to select as his partner the
  prettiest maidservant in his establishment. But if the baronet failed in his
  dignity as head of the house, her ladyship had enough for both. She looked
  like a queen as she sailed in, amongst her own domestics and all the
  retainers and hangers-on for miles round. On the evening in question it
  amused me much to see the admiration, almost the adoration, she elicited from
  old and young. No wonder: that stately form, that queenly brow, had been bent
  over many a sick-bed; those deep, thrilling tones had spoken words of comfort
  to many a humble sufferer; that white hand was ever ready to aid, ever open
  to relieve; good or bad, none ever applied to Lady Scapegrace in vain.</p>

  <p>"The virtuous it is pleasant to relieve and make friends of," she has
  often said to me in her moments of confidence; "the wicked it is a duty to
  assist and to pity. Who should feel for them, Kate, if I didn't? God knows I
  have been wicked enough myself."</p>

  <p>The men-servants never took their eyes off her, and I fear made but sorry
  partners to the buxom lasses of the household till "my lady" had left the
  room. I saw two stable-boys, evidently fresh arrivals, who seemed perfectly
  transfixed with admiration, as at an apparition such as they had never
  pictured to themselves in their dreams; and one rough fellow, a sort of
  under-keeper in velveteen, with the frame of a Hercules and a fist that could
  have stunned an ox, having gazed at her open-mouthed for about ten minutes
  without winking an eyelash, struck his hand against his thigh, and exclaimed
  aloud to his own inexpressible relief, though utterly unconscious of anything
  but the presence which so overpowered him,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Noa, dashed if ever I <i>did</i>!"</p>

  <p>This was soon after "my lady" had sailed into the servants' hall at the
  head of her guests. It was the custom of the place for all the "fashionables"
  and smart people who were actually in the house to attend the servants' ball,
  most of us only staying long enough to set the thing going with spirit,
  though I believe some of the young dandies who found partners to their liking
  remained to the end, and "kept it up" till daylight. Down we all went, as
  soon as the gentlemen had finished their wine and discussed their coffee in
  the drawing-room, down we went, through stone passages and long underground
  galleries into a splendidly-lighted apartment, somewhat devoid of furniture,
  but decorated with evergreens, and further adorned by a sort of muslin
  transparency hanging from the roof. This was the servants' hall, and although
  on a stone floor, a capital room for dancing it was. We were all soon
  provided with partners. Sir Guy, much to her triumph, selected my maid,
  Gertrude. Lady Scapegrace paired off with the steward, a fat, rosy man, who
  quite <i>shone</i> with delight at the honour. The French cook carried off
  Miss Molasses, with whose native stupidity I thought the vivacious foreigner
  seemed a little disappointed. Frank Lovell was taken possession of by the fat
  housekeeper, to whom he "did the amiable," as Frank had the knack of doing to
  anything with a petticoat. Cousin John handed off a stately damsel, whom I
  afterwards recognized as the upper housemaid, and I was claimed by a dapper
  little second-horse rider, of whom I flatter myself I made a complete
  conquest by the interest I took in his profession and the thorough knowledge
  I displayed of its details. I had to make most of the conversation myself,
  certainly, for his replies, though couched in terms of the deepest respect,
  and accompanied by a chivalrous deference for my sex to which I was totally
  unaccustomed from the partners of a London ball-room, consisted for the most
  part of little more than "Yes, Miss," and "No, Miss," with an additional
  smooth of the smoothest, shiniest head I ever beheld. When I had exhausted
  the meets of the hounds for the ensuing week, with a few general observations
  on the pursuit of hunting, and the merits of that noble animal, the horse, I
  began to get high and dry for further topics, and was not sorry when three
  fiddles and a flute struck up their inspiriting tones, and away we all went,
  "cross hands," "down the middle and up again," to the lively and by this time
  tolerably familiar air of "Sir Roger de Coverley."</p>

  <p>I am bound to confess that, as far as the servants were concerned,
  everything went on with the utmost propriety and respect. Sir Guy, indeed,
  pulled his partner about with an unnecessary degree of vigour, which at times
  almost degenerated into a romp, and squeezed my hands in "the Poussette" with
  an energy of affection which I could well have dispensed with; but every one
  else was a very pattern of politeness and decorum. In fact, the thing was
  almost getting stupid, when my little second-horse rider and myself,
  returning breathless from our rapid excursion down some two-and-thirty
  couple, were "brought up," startled and dismayed, by a piercing scream from
  at least that number of female voices, all raised at the same instant.</p>

  <p>"Fire! fire!" exclaimed the tall housemaid at my elbow.</p>

  <p>"Save me! save me!" shrieked the fat housekeeper, plumping into Frank
  Lovell's arms, and well-nigh bringing him to the ground, in which case she
  <i>must</i> have crushed him.</p>

  <p>"Murder! murder!" shouted my idiot of a maid, Gertrude, rushing
  frantically for the doorway, followed by Sir Guy, who was swearing, I am
  sorry to say, most fearfully.</p>

  <p>"Stand still, fools!" I heard Lady Scapegrace exclaim in her deep tones,
  "and let nobody open the door!"</p>

  <p>By this time there was a rush of all the women towards the door; and as
  the centre of the room was cleared, I saw what had happened. The muslin
  transparency had caught fire&mdash;a large fragment of it was even now
  blazing on the floor, and the consequences amongst all those light floating
  dresses and terrified women might have been indeed awful. For an instant
  everybody seemed paralyzed&mdash;everybody but Cousin John; during that
  instant he had flung off his coat, and kneeling upon it, extinguished the
  flames. They were still blazing over his head: with a desperate bound he tore
  down the ill-fated transparency; regardless of singed hair and blistered
  hands, he clasped and pressed it, and stamped upon it, and smothered it. Ere
  one could have counted fifty the danger was over and not a vestige of the
  fire remained. How handsome he looked with his brave face lighted up and his
  eyes sparkling with excitement! Nobody could say John wanted expression of
  countenance now. The next moment he was quietly apologizing in his usual tone
  to Lady Scapegrace for "spoiling her beautiful transparency," and parrying
  her thanks and encomiums on his courage and presence of mind with an
  assurance that he "only pulled it down because he happened to be directly
  under it;" but he could not help turning to me and saying,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Kate, I hope you were not much frightened."</p>

  <p>The words were not much, but they were uttered in the old kind voice; they
  rung in my ears all the evening, and I went to bed happier than I ever
  thought I could have been after such a day.</p>

  <p class="first">HE Sunday at Scamperley, I am sorry to say, was hardly
  observed with that degree of respect and strictness which is due to the one
  sacred day of the week. Very few people went to morning service, as indeed
  the late hours overnight kept most of us in our rooms till eleven or twelve
  o'clock, when we dawdled down to a breakfast that seemed to lengthen itself
  out till luncheon-time. To be sure, when the latter meal had been discussed,
  and we had marked our reverence for the day by a conversation in which we
  expressed our disapproval of the personal appearance, faults and foibles, and
  general character of our friends, some of us would declare an intention of
  attending afternoon church; on which subject much discussion would arise, and
  the probability of the weather holding up would be volubly commented
  on&mdash;the church being situated about a quarter of a mile from the house,
  and the way to it through the Park being so completely sheltered by
  evergreens that to have got wet, save in a downright <i>pour</i> of rain, was
  next to impossible. At last we would get under way&mdash;the ladies mincing
  along with their magnificently covered prayer-books, affecting an air of
  unwilling decorum; the dandies carrying cloaks, shawls, and umbrellas for
  their respective goddesses, and following them, so to speak, under protest,
  as if there was something to be ashamed of in the whole proceeding. Lady
  Scapegrace always went early, and quite by herself; she sat apart, too, from
  her guests and relatives. Not so Sir Guy. It was his great delight to create
  as much noise and confusion as possible, that on his entrance the respectable
  yeomen and humble parishioners might be dazzled with his glory, and whisper
  one to another, "That be Sir Guy," as he marched to the front of his family
  pew in a blaze of wondrous apparel. It was natural that he should create a
  sensation with his red face and gaudy-coloured clothes, and huge, dyed
  whiskers, and the eternal flower in his mouth, which was always on duty save
  when relieved by a cigar or a toothpick. Pew it could scarcely with propriety
  be called, inasmuch as it was more like a box at the opera than a seat in a
  place of worship. We entered by a staircase outside the church, with a
  private door of our own; passing through which we found ourselves in a very
  comfortable chamber, with a good many chairs and sofas, a handsome bookcase,
  and a blazing fire. This, again, led to a smaller apartment, into which Sir
  Guy would swagger with much unnecessary noise and bustle. Throwing up a large
  window, he leaned over as it were from a hustings, and, behold! we were at
  church.</p>

  <p>When the sermon was concluded Sir Guy shut the window down again, and we
  took our departure, much edified, as may easily be imagined, by the lessons
  of meekness and humility which we had received in so becoming a manner. From
  church we invariably proceeded to the kennel, where a stout, healthy-looking
  keeper paraded the Baronet's pointers and setters for the inspection of the
  ladies. Here Sir Guy took entire possession of me once more.</p>

  <p>"Don't be alarmed, my dear," said he, as a great bull-headed,
  black-and-white brute, surnamed Don, came blundering up and tried to put his
  muddy paws on my dress. Sir Guy's affectation of the "paternal," and his
  odious way of calling one "my dear," provoked me intensely; and I gave Don
  such a crack over his double nose with my parasol as broke the ivory handle
  of that instrument, and completely quelled all further demonstrations of
  affection from the uninteresting brute. Sir Guy was charmed.</p>

    <p class="caption">Sir Guy was charmed.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Hit him hard," said he; "he's got no friends. What a vixen it is! How she
  punished my near leader the other day! I <i>love</i> that girl!"</p>

  <p>The latter sentence, be it observed, was spoken <i>sotto voce</i>, and
  required, as indeed it received, no reply.</p>

  <p>"What interesting creatures!" exclaimed Miss Molasses, indicating an old
  pointer lady, who went swinging by with all the appearance of having lately
  brought up a large and thirsty family. "Do tell me, can that dog really
  <i>catch</i> a hare?"</p>

  <p>The keeper's face was a study; he was apparently a humorous individual.
  But Miss Molasses addressed her remarks to Frank Lovell; and Frank, as in
  duty bound, replied. That girl was evidently making up to him, and, thinking
  he was fond of field-sports, pretended to take an interest in everything
  connected with those pursuits for his sake.</p>

  <p>"Come and see the tame pheasants, Miss Coventry," said Sir Guy. I knew
  what this meant: I knew it would entail a
  <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> walk with my
  aversion, and I cast an imploring look at Frank, as much as to say,
  "<i>Do</i> save me." He caught my meaning in an instant, and skilfully
  interposed. Of course, as he accompanied us, so did Miss Molasses; but Frank
  and I lingered a little behind the rest of the party, made a wrong turn in
  the shrubbery, and found ourselves, I never knew exactly how, taking a long
  walk all alone in the waning twilight. I don't know what Aunt Deborah would
  have said to such proceedings, and I am quite sure Lady Horsingham would have
  been unspeakably shocked; but these Sunday walks were the custom of the
  country at Scamperley&mdash;and, after all, it was not my doing, and
  consequently not my fault.</p>

  <p>I wonder why it is that, in the very convenient code of morality which the
  world has adopted for its private use, places and people should so completely
  alter facts. You may do things with impunity in London that would destroy the
  character of a Diana in the country; and, again, certain rural practices,
  harmless&mdash;nay, even praiseworthy&mdash;when confined to a picturesque
  domain, if flourished before the eyes of the metropolis, would sink the
  performer to the lowest depths of social degradation. It is not what you
  <i>do</i> that matters one whit, but what the world <i>thinks</i> of your
  actions; and the gentlemen use a proverb which I have often heard in
  connection with certain racing enormities, that "One man may steal a horse,
  while another must not even <i>look at a halter</i>:" and if this be the case
  with that sex who arrogate to themselves the exclusive privilege of doing
  wrong, how much more does the adage hold good with us poor, weak,
  trampled-upon women? Lady Straitlace may do what she likes: she assumes a
  severe air in society, is strict with her children, and harsh with her
  servants. In all ranks of her acquaintance (of course below that of a
  countess) she visits the slightest dereliction from female propriety with
  unrelenting bitterness. Woe be to the trespasser, high or low! The weapon is
  always ready to probe and gash and lacerate; the lash is constantly raised,
  "swift to smite and never to spare." But who would venture to speak a word
  against the decorum of Lady Straitlace? If she goes out in the dark, 'tis to
  visit a sick friend; if she encourages young Antin us to be what ladies call
  continually "in her pocket," that is only in order to give the lad good
  advice and keep him out of mischief. Major Ramrod is never out of the house;
  but what then? The visits of fifty Major Ramrods would not entitle the world
  to breathe a whisper against a person of such strict propriety as Lady
  Straitlace. But how that same forbearing world indemnifies itself on poor
  Mrs. Peony! It is never tired of shrugging its worldly shoulders and raising
  its worldly hands and eyebrows at the sayings and doings of unfortunate Mrs.
  Peony.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear of her going to the bachelors' ball with three gentlemen in
  a fly?" (Nobody thinks it worth while to specify that the three Lotharios
  consisted of her grandfather, her husband, and her nephew.) "Did you see her
  drop her bracelet, to make young Stiffneck pick it up? Do you know that she
  takes morning walks with Colonel Chanticleer, and evening strolls with Bob
  Bulbul? She chatters, she laughs, she flirts, she makes eyes; she's bad
  style, she's an odious woman; 'pon my word, I don't know whether mamma will
  go on visiting her!"</p>

  <p>And why should the world make this dead set at poor Mrs. Peony? She is
  good-looking, soft-hearted, and unaffected; she laughs when she is pleased,
  and cries when she is touched. She is altogether frank, and natural, and
  womanly. Can these be good reasons for running her down? Heavens knows! but
  run down she is, just as the hypocritical Lady Straitlace is cried up. Well,
  we must take things as they are and make the best of them. So Frank and I
  walked on through the pleasant fields in the darkening twilight, and I, for
  one, enjoyed it excessively, and was quite sorry when a great bell sounding
  from the house warned us that it was time to return, and that our absence
  would too surely be the subject of remark should we linger out of doors any
  longer. I never knew Frank so agreeable; on every topic he was brilliant, and
  lively, and amusing. Only once, in some casual remark about the future, there
  was a shade of melancholy in his tone, more like what he used to be formerly.
  Somehow, I don't think I liked him so well in his best spirits; perhaps I was
  myself changed in the last few weeks. I used often to think so. At first,
  during that walk, I feared lest Frank should touch upon a topic which would
  have been far from unwelcome a short time ago. I soon saw he had not the
  slightest intention of doing so, and I confess I was immensely relieved. I
  had dreaded the possibility of being obliged at last to give a decided
  answer&mdash;of having my own fate in my own hands, and feeling totally
  incapable of choosing for myself. But I might have spared my nerves all such
  misgivings: my cavalier never gave me an opportunity of even fancying myself
  in such a dilemma till just as we reached the house, when, espying Mrs.
  Lumley and Miss Molasses returning from <i>their</i> stroll, he started,
  coloured up a little, like a guilty man, and acted as though he would have
  escaped their notice. I was provoked.</p>

  <p>"Don't desert your colours, Captain Lovell," I said, in a firm voice;
  "Miss Molasses is looking for you, even now."</p>

  <p>"Unfeeling," muttered Frank, biting his lip, and looking really annoyed.
  "O Miss Coventry! O Kate! give me an opportunity of explaining all."</p>

  <p>"Explain nothing," was my reply; "we understand each other perfectly. It
  is time for me to go in and dress."</p>

  <p>So I marched into the house, and left him looking foolish&mdash;if Frank
  ever <i>could</i> look foolish&mdash;on the doorstep. As I hurried along the
  passages I encountered Lady Scapegrace.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Kate?" said she, following me into my room; "you look
  as if something had happened. No bad news, I trust, from Aunt Deborah?"</p>

  <p>I burst into tears. Kindness always overcomes me completely, and then I
  make a fool of myself.</p>

  <p>"Nothing's the matter," I sobbed out; "only I'm tired and nervous, Lady
  Scapegrace, and I want to dress."</p>

  <p>My hostess slipped quietly out of the room, and presently returned with
  some sal volatile and water: she made me drink it every drop.</p>

  <p>"I must have a talk to you, Kate," said she, "but not now; the dinner-bell
  will ring in ten minutes." And she too hurried away to perform her
  toilette.</p>

  <p>As I get older I take to moralizing, and I am afraid I waste a good deal
  of valuable time in speculating on the thoughts, ideas, and, so to speak, the
  inner life of my neighbours. It is curious to observe a large, well-dressed
  party seated at dinner, all apparently frank and open as the day, full of fun
  and good humour, saying whatever comes uppermost, and to all outward seeming
  laying bare every crevice and cranny of their hearts, and then to reflect
  that each one of the throng has a separate life, entirely distinct from that
  which he or she parades before the public, cherished perhaps with a miser's
  care or endured with a martyr's fortitude. Sir Guy, sitting at the bottom of
  his table, drinking rather more wine than usual&mdash;perhaps because it was
  Sunday, and the enforced decencies of the day had somewhat damped his
  spirits&mdash;looked a jovial, thoughtless, merry country gentleman, somewhat
  slang, it may be, not to say vulgar, but still open-hearted, joyous, and
  hospitable. Was there no skeleton in Sir Guy's mental cupboard? Were there no
  phantoms that <i>would</i> rise up, like Banquo's ghost, to their seat,
  unbidden, at his board? While he smacked his great lips over those bumpers of
  dark red Burgundy, had he quite forgotten the days of old&mdash;the friends
  he had pledged and made fools of&mdash;the kind hearts he had loved and
  betrayed? Did he ever think of Damocles and the hanging sword? Could he
  summon courage to look into the future, or fortitude even to <i>think</i> of
  the past? Sir Guy's was a strong, healthy, sensuous nature, in which the
  physical far outweighed the intellectual; and yet I verily believe his
  conscience sometimes nearly drove him mad.</p>

  <p>Then there was my lady, sitting at the top of her table, the very picture
  of a courteous, affable, well-bred hostess; perhaps, if anything, a little
  too placid and immovable in her outward demeanour. Who would have guessed at
  the wild and stormy passions that could rage beneath so calm a surface? Who
  would suppose that stately, reserved, majestic-looking woman had the
  recklessness of a brigand and the caprices of a child? A physiognomist might
  have marked the traces of strong feelings in her deepened eyes and the lines
  about her mouth&mdash;damages done by the hurricane, that years of calm can
  never repair; but there had been a page or two in Lady Scapegrace's life
  that, with all his acuteness, would have astonished Lavater himself. Then
  there was Miss Molasses, the pink of propriety and "what-would-mamma-say"
  young ladyism&mdash;cold as a statue, and, as old Chaucer says, "upright as a
  bolt," but all the time over head and ears in love with Frank Lovell, and
  ready to do anything he asked her at a moment's notice. There was Frank
  himself, gay and <i>d&eacute;bonnair</i>: outwardly the lightest-hearted man
in the
  company; inwardly, I have reason to know, tormented with misgivings and stung
  by self-reproach. Playing a double game&mdash;attached to one woman and
  courting another, despising himself thoroughly the while; hemmed in by
  difficulties and loaded with debt, hampered by a bad book on "The Two
  Thousand," and playing hide-and-seek even now with the Jews&mdash;Frank's
  real existence was very different from the one he showed his friends. So with
  the rest of the party. Old Mrs. Molasses was bothered by her maid; Mr. Lumley
  puzzled by his beetles; his wife involved in a thousand schemes of
  mischief-making, which kept her in perpetual hot water: all, even honest
  Cousin John, were sedulously hiding their real thoughts from their
  companions; all were playing the game with counters, of which indeed they
  were lavish enough; but had you asked for a bit of sterling coin, fresh from
  the Mint and stamped with the impress of truth, they would have buttoned
  their pockets closer than ever&mdash;ay, though you had been bankrupt and
  penniless, they would have seen you further first, and <i>then they
  wouldn't</i>.</p>

  <p>So we flirted, and talked, and laughed, and adjourned to the drawing-room,
  where, after a proper interval, we were joined by the gentlemen, who, in
  consideration of the day, consented for that one evening in the week to
  forego their usual games of chance or skill, such as whist, billiards, and
  cockamaroo. But the essential inanity of a fashionable party requires to be
  amused, so we set round a large table, and played at "letters," sedulously
  "shuffling" the handsome ivory capitals as we gave each other long
  jaw-breaking words, the difficulties of which were much enhanced by their
  being usually misspelt, but which, nevertheless, formed a very appropriate
  vehicle for what the world calls "flirtation." I can always find out other
  people's words much quicker than my own, and whilst I was puzzling over
  "centipede," and teasing Mrs. Lumley, who had given it me, for the initial
  letter, I peeped over the shoulder of my next neighbour, Miss Molasses, and
  made out clearly enough the word she had just received from Frank Lovell.
  <i>She</i> would not have discovered it for a century, but I read it at a
  glance. I just <i>looked</i> at Frank, who blushed like a girl, took it back,
  vowing he had spelt it wrong, and gave her another. Did he think to throw
  dust in my eyes? There is a stage of mental suffering at which we grow
  naturally clear-sighted. I had arrived at it long ago. Watching every action
  of my neighbours, I had yet ears for all that was going on around. Sir Guy,
  occupying a position on the hearth-rug, with his coat-tails over his arms,
  was haranguing the clergyman of the parish, a quiet, meek little man, who
  dined at Scamperley regularly on Sunday, and appeared frightened out of his
  wits. He was a man of education and intellect, a ripe scholar, a middling
  preacher, and a profound logician; but he was completely overpowered by
  coarse, ignorant, noisy Sir Guy.</p>

  <p>"Driving&mdash;hey?" said the Baronet; "we're all fond of driving, here,
  Mr. Waxy: there's a young lady who will teach you to handle the ribbons. Gad,
  she'd make the crop-eared mare step along. Have you got the old mare still?
  Devilish good old mare!"</p>

  <p>No child of man is too learned, or too quiet, or too humble, to feel
  flattered at praise of his horse. Mr. Waxy blushed a moist yellow as he
  replied,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Very good of you to remember her, Sir Guy; docile and safe, and gentle
  withal, Sir Guy. But I don't drive her myself, Sir Guy," added Mr. Waxy,
  raising his hands deprecatingly, as who should say, "Heaven forbid!" "I don't
  drive myself, sir; no&mdash;no, my lad assumes the reins; and notwithstanding
  the potency of your Scamperley ale, Sir Guy, we manage to arrive pretty safe
  at our destination."</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Mr. Waxy," vociferated Sir Guy. "Did I ever tell you what
  happened to me once, when I took it into my head to drive my own chariot
  home? Look ye here, sir, I'll tell you how it was. I was unmarried then, Mr.
  Waxy, and as innocent as a babe, d'ye see? Well, sir, I'd been to a
  <i>battue</i> at my friend Rocketer's; and what with staying to dinner, and a
  ball and a supper afterwards, it was very late before I started for
  Scamperley, and all the servants were drunk, as a matter of course. Why, sir,
  when I came out of the house there were my carriage and horses standing in
  the line with some dozen others, and devil a soul to look after 'em. What
  should you have done, Mr. Waxy? Sworn like a trooper, I'll warrant it!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Waxy shook his head with an air of mild deprecation.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," continued Sir Guy, "I'll tell you what I did. I jumped on the
  box, Sir, before you could say Jack Robinson. I put on my own coachman's
  box-coat, Sir, and drove 'em home myself. Thinks I, 'I'll give the rascals a
  precious benefit: they'll have to walk every mile of the way'&mdash;nine
  miles, and as dark as pitch, Mr. Waxy, as dark as pitch! Well, sir, I'd a
  London footman, who was a sharpish fellow, and used to dissipation in
  general; he heard the carriage drive off, and ran to catch it. I gave
  <i>him</i> a pretty good breather as I rattled down the avenue. The fellow
  puffed like a grampus when he got up behind, making no doubt it was all
  right, and he hadn't been found out. The horses knew they were going home,
  and it wasn't long before I pulled up at my own door. Down gets John, all
  officiousness and alacrity to make up for past enormities, and rings a peal
  that might waken the dead. Directly he hears them beginning to unbar he opens
  the carriage-door and looks in. No master! The day was just dawning. I shall
  never forget the fellow's face as he looked up, mistaking me, muffled as I
  was in my own livery, for his fellow-servant.</p>

  <p>"'I always told you how it would be, Peter,' said he, turning up a face of
  drunken wisdom; 'and now it's come to pass. The devil's been and took Sir Guy
  at last; and if he's as wicious there as he's been here, it's a precious bad
  bargain for both of 'em!'"</p>

  <p>Poor Mr. Waxy was obliged to laugh, but he took his departure immediately;
  and of course, directly there was a move, the ladies went to bed.</p>

  <p>"Come to my room, Kate," whispered Lady Scapegrace, as we lighted our
  hand-candles&mdash;"you can go the short way through the boudoir&mdash;I want
  to speak a word with you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

  <p class="first">"Kate," said Lady Scapegrace, as she shut the door of her
  snug dressing-room and wheeled an easy-chair before the fire for my
  benefit&mdash;"Kate, you're a foolish girl; it strikes me you are playing a
  dangerous game, and playing it all wrong, moreover. I can see more than you
  think. Do you know the difference between real diamonds and paste? Not you,
  you little goose. But you <i>shall</i>, if I can teach it you. Kate, have you
  ever heard me talked about? Did you ever hear any good of me?" I was forced
  to answer both questions&mdash;the former in the affirmative, the latter in
  the negative.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe I'm as bad as they give me credit for?" proceeded her
  ladyship.</p>

  <p>"No, no!" I replied, taking her hand and kissing it; for I really liked
  Lady Scapegrace. "Let them say what they will, I won't believe anything bad
  of you at all."</p>

  <p>"I have had a strange life, Kate," said she; "and perhaps not quite fair
  play. Well, the worst is over now, at any rate. I don't <i>much</i> care how
  short the remainder may be. Kate, did you ever hear I was a murderess?"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" I repeated, taking her hand once more; for I was shocked and
  half frightened at the expression of her countenance. "I never heard anybody
  say more than that you were <i>odd</i>, and a flirt, and perhaps not very
  much attached to Sir Guy."</p>

  <p>Lady Scapegrace shuddered. "I owe you a great deal, Kate Coventry," she
  resumed&mdash;"a great deal more than I can ever hope to repay. I consider
  that you once saved my life, but of that I make small account; you have done
  me a far greater kindness&mdash;you have interested me; you have made me fond
  of you; you have taught me to feel like a <i>woman</i> again. The least I can
  do in return is to watch you and warn you&mdash;to show you the rock on which
  I made shipwreck, and beseech you to avoid it. Kate, you've heard of my
  Cousin Latimer; would you like to see his picture?"</p>

  <p>Lady Scapegrace rose, walked to a small cabinet, unlocked it, and produced
  a miniature, which she placed in my hands. If the painter had not flattered
  him, Cousin Latimer was indeed a handsome boy. There was genius on his wide,
  bold forehead, and resolution in his firm, well-cut mouth; his large dark
  eyes betrayed strong passions and keen intelligence, whilst high birth was
  stamped on his fine features and chivalrous expression of countenance. Poor
  Cousin Latimer!</p>

  <p>"Look at that, Kate," said Lady Scapegrace, in low chilling tones; "the
  last time I saw him that was his very image. Thank God, I never beheld him
  when those kind features were cold and rigid&mdash;that white neck gashed by
  his own hand! O Kate! 'tis a sad story. I have not mentioned it for twenty
  years; but it's a relief to <i>talk</i> of it now. Surely I was not
  altogether to blame; surely he might have given me time; he need not have
  been so hasty&mdash;so desperate.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Kate. I was one of a large family of girls. All my sisters were
  beautiful; all were vain of their charms. As I grew up, I heard nothing
  talked about but conquests, and lovers, and captivations. I thought, to
  dazzle and enslave the opposite sex was the noblest aim of woman. Latimer was
  brought up with us: we called him 'cousin,' though he was in reality a very
  distant connection. Poor boy! day by day I could see he was growing more and
  more attached to me. Latimer always brought me the earliest roses. Latimer
  would walk miles by the side of my pony. Latimer helped me with my drawing,
  and did my commissions, and turned the leaves when I played on the
  pianoforte, and hung over the instrument when I sang. In short, Latimer was
  my slave, body and soul; and the consequence was, Kate, that I cared very
  little for him. My sisters, to be sure, joked me about my conquest; and I
  felt, I confess, a proper pride in owning a lover like the rest; but of real
  affection for him I had then very little; and I often think, my dear, that we
  women seldom value devotion such as his till too late. I was not old enough
  to think seriously of marriage; but Latimer was convinced I should become his
  wife, and (poor fellow!) made all his arrangements and schemes for the future
  under this idea, with a forethought scarcely to be expected from one so
  young.</p>

  <p>"Well, years crept on, and I 'came out,' as you young ladies call it, and
  was presented at court, and went to balls, and began to make the most of my
  time, and enjoy life after the manner of my kind. Of course, I was no wiser
  than my elders. I danced, and smiled, and flirted, as I had seen my sisters
  do; and the more partners I could refuse the better I was pleased. One day
  Cousin Latimer came to me, and spoke out honestly and explicitly. He told me
  of all his hopes, his misgivings, his future as I had the power to make it,
  and his love. I was pleased and flattered. I felt that I liked Cousin Latimer
  better than any one in the world; but there were two things I liked even
  better than Cousin Latimer: these were power and admiration. Of the former I
  never could obtain as much as I coveted; of the latter I determined to take
  my fill. We were that night to have a grand ball in the house, and were much
  occupied with decorating the rooms, and other preparations, such as we girls
  delighted in. I put off Latimer with half-promises and vague assurances,
  which sent him away more in love with me than ever. I was to dance the first
  quadrille with him. It was an engagement of at least a month's standing, and
  he had rather wearied me by too often reminding me of it.</p>

  <p>"There was a regiment of hussars quartered in our neighbourhood, and we
  were well acquainted with most of the officers. The more so, as one of my
  sisters was engaged to be married to the major, who, by the way, ran away
  from her a year afterwards. One of these officers, a captain in the regiment,
  was an especial flirt of mine; he was a good-looking, agreeable man, and a
  beautiful waltzer. I recollect the night as well as if it was
  yesterday&mdash;the officers arriving in their uniforms; my father standing
  behind us, proclaiming aloud his pride in his six handsome daughters; Cousin
  Latimer claiming my hand for the first dance, and my refusal, notwithstanding
  my long promise, on the plea that I was engaged to Captain Normanton. Poor
  boy! I can see his pained, eager face now. 'You do what you like with me,' he
  said; 'but you <i>must</i> dance the next.' I laughed and promised.</p>

  <p>"Captain Normanton was very agreeable; he was the most dashing-looking man
  in the room, and I liked the vanity of parading him about in his uniform, and
  showing my sisters and others the power I had over Cousin Latimer. Once more
  the latter claimed my promise, and once more I threw him over. I glanced
  triumphantly at him as he watched me from a corner; and the more he gazed,
  the more <i>I acted at him</i>, as if I was making violent love to my
  partner. Somehow, without looking, I saw every shade of Latimer's
  countenance. Once or twice I had compassion, but there was the excitement of
  vanity and novelty to lure me on.</p>

  <p>"For the first time in my life I knew how much it was possible for men to
  care for us, and I could not resist torturing my victim to the utmost. Fool
  that I was! Cousin Latimer came up to me once more. Though annoyed and hurt,
  he mustered a good-humoured smile as he said, 'For the <i>third</i> and
  <i>last</i> time, will you dance with me?' 'But you don't waltz half as well
  as Captain Normanton,' I replied; 'I like <i>him</i> best;' and away I
  whirled again with the delighted hussar.</p>

  <p>"The instant I had spoken, I felt I had gone too far. I would have given
  anything to unsay those foolish words, but it was too late. When I stopped,
  panting and breathless, after the dance, Cousin Latimer came quite close to
  me. I never saw a face so changed: he was deadly pale, and there was a sweet,
  melancholy expression in his countenance that contrasted strangely with the
  wild gleam in his eye. He spoke very low, almost softly, but in a voice I had
  never heard before. He only said, 'God forgive you, dear; you try me too
  much.' I never saw him again, Kate&mdash;never.</p>

  <p>"When I heard what had happened, I was laid up for months with brain
  fever. They cut all my hair off; they pinioned me; they did all that skill
  and science could do, and I recovered. Would to God that I had died! I do not
  think my head has ever been right since.</p>

  <p>"Kate! Kate! would you have such feelings as mine? Should you like to live
  all your life haunted by one pale face? Would you wish never to enjoy a
  strain of music, a gleam of sunshine, a single, simple, natural pleasure,
  because of the phantom? Be warned, my dear, before it is too late. I tell you
  honestly, I never forgot him; I tell you, I never forgave myself. What did I
  care for any of them, except poor Alphonse&mdash;and I only liked Alphonse
  because he reminded me of the dead. Do you think I was not a reckless woman
  when I married Sir Guy?</p>

  <p>"Do you think I have not been punished and humiliated enough? Heaven
  forbid, my dear, that your fate should resemble mine! I read your feelings
  far more plainly than you do yourself. You have a kind, generous, noble heart
  deeply attached to you. Don't be a fool, as I was; don't throw him over for
  the sake of an empty-headed, flirting, good-for-nothing rou&eacute;, who
will forget
  you in a fortnight. Strong language, Kate, is it not? But think over what I
  have told you. Good-night, dear. What would I give to yawn as honestly as you
  do, and to sleep sound once again, as I used to sleep when I was a girl!"</p>

  <p>I took my candle, and kissed Lady Scapegrace affectionately as I thanked
  her, and wished her "good-night." It was already late, and my room was quite
  at the other end of the house. As I sped along, devoutly trusting I should
  not meet any of the gentlemen on their way to bed, I spied a figure advancing
  towards me from the end of a long corridor. It was attired in a flowing
  dressing-gown of crimson silk, with magnificent Turkish slippers, and carried
  a hand candlestick much off the perpendicular, as it swayed up the passage in
  a somewhat devious course. When it caught sight of me, it extended both its
  arms, regardless of the melted wax with which such a manoeuvre bedaubed the
  wall, and prepared, with many endearing and complimentary expressions, to bar
  my further progress.</p>

  <p>The figure was no less a person than Sir Guy, half tipsy, proceeding from
  his dressing-room to bed. What to do I knew not. I shuddered at the idea of
  meeting the Baronet at such an hour, and in so excited a state. I loathed and
  hated him at all times, and I quite trembled now to face his odious
  compliments and impertinent <i>double entendres</i>. My hunting experience,
  however, had given me a quick eye to see my way out of a difficulty; and
  espying a green baise door on my right I rushed through it, and down a flight
  of stone steps that led I knew not where. Giving a view-holloa that must have
  startled every light sleeper in the house, Sir Guy followed close in my wake,
  dropping the silver candlestick with a most alarming clatter. I saw I had not
  the speed of him to any great extent, so I dodged into the first empty room I
  came to, and blowing out my light, resolved to lie there <i>perdue</i> till
  my pursuer had overrun the scent.</p>

  <p>The manoeuvre answered admirably so far. I heard the enemy swearing
  volubly as he blundered along the passage, thinking I was still before him;
  and I now prepared to grope my way back in the dark to my own room. But I had
  not escaped yet. To my infinite dismay, I heard the voices of gentlemen
  wishing each other the usual "Good-night, old fellow," and proceeding along
  the passage from the direction of the smoking-room. Horror of horrors! a
  light approached the door of the very room in which I had taken refuge; in
  another second he would enter&mdash;the man would find me in his room. He
  stopped a moment on the threshold to fire a parting jest at his companions,
  and the light from his candle showed me my only chance. A covered showerbath
  stood in the corner of the apartment, and into that shower-bath I jumped,
  closing the curtains all round me, but, as may be easily believed, taking
  very particular care not to pull the string. Scarcely was I fairly ensconced
  before Frank Lovell made his appearance; and I saw at once, through a hole in
  the curtains, that he was the lawful occupier and possessor of the
  apartment.</p>

  <p>Here was a predicament indeed! If the emergency had not been so desperate,
  I must have fainted. "Good gracious," I thought, "if he should lock the
  door!" Frank, however, seemed to have no such intention; I believe this is a
  precaution gentlemen seldom adopt. On the contrary, he proceeded to make
  himself thoroughly at home. Lighting his candle, he leisurely divested
  himself of his coat, waistcoat, and neckcloth, enfolded his person in a large
  loose dressing-gown, leaned his head on both hands, and gave a deep sigh.
  Apparently much relieved by this process, he took up his hair-brushes, and
  after a good refreshing turn at his locks and whiskers, and a muttered
  compliment to his own reflection in the glass, that sounded very like "You
  fool!" he unlocked a small writing-case, and producing from it a little
  bundle of letters, tied up with pink ribbon, selected them one by one, and
  read them over from beginning to end, kissing each with devout fervour as he
  replaced it carefully in its envelope. I would have given a great deal to
  know who they were from; their perusal seemed to afford him mingled
  satisfaction and annoyance; but he sighed heavily again, and I saw he had a
  long lock of hair in his fingers, which he gazed at till the tears stood in
  his eyes. He kissed it, the traitor! and fondled it, and spoke to it, and
  clasped it to his heart (men are just as great fools as we are). Whose could
  it be? Not mine, certainly, for I never gave him such a thing; Miss
  Molasses'? No; hers was black, and rather coarse; this was a silky chestnut.
  Could it have belonged to Mrs. Lumley? Hers was very much the colour, and I
  often thought Frank rather <i>&eacute;pris</i> with her. Nonsense! that
lively lady
  had not an atom of sentiment in her composition; she would just as soon have
  thought of working him a counterpane!</p>

  <p>I was so interested in my discoveries that I forgot altogether my own
  critical position, the impracticability of escape till Frank had gone to
  sleep, the chance of arousing him as I went out, or, more alarming still, the
  awful possibility of his lying awake all night. When morning dawned,
  concealment could no longer be preserved, and what to do then? I meditated a
  bold stroke. To rush from my hiding-place, blow out both the candles before
  my host had recovered his surprise, and then run for it. Thrice was I on the
  eve of this perilous enterprise. Thrice my courage failed me at the critical
  moment. The fourth time I think I should have gone, when a knock at the door
  arrested my attention, and Frank's "Come in" welcomed a visitor whose voice I
  well knew to be that of Cousin John. The plot began to thicken. It was
  impossible to get away now.</p>

  <p>"Lovell," said John, in an unusually grave voice, "I told you I wanted to
  speak a word with you, and this is the only time I can make sure of finding
  you alone."</p>

  <p>Frank was busy huddling his treasures back into the writing-case.</p>

  <p>"Drive on, old fellow," said he, "there's lots of time; it's not two
  o'clock yet."</p>

  <p>"Lovell," proceeded John, "you are an old friend of mine, and I have a
  great regard for you, but I have a duty to perform, and I must go through
  with it. Point-blank, on your honour as a gentleman, I ask you, <i>Are
  you</i> or <i>are you not</i> engaged to be married to Miss Molasses?"</p>

  <p>Frank coloured, hesitated, looked confused, and then got angry.</p>

  <p>"No intimacy can give you a right to ask such a question," he replied,
  talking very fast and excitedly: "you take an unwarrantable liberty, both
  with her and me. Who told you I was going to be married at all? or what
  business is it of yours whether I am married or not?"</p>

  <p>John began to get heated too, but he looked very determined.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you should take it thus," he replied, "for you force me to
  come at once to the point. As the nearest relation and natural guardian of my
  cousin, Miss Coventry, I must ask your intention with regard to that young
  lady. I have often remarked you paid her great attention, but it was not till
  to-day that I heard your name coupled with hers, and a doubt expressed as to
  which of the ladies I have mentioned you meant to honour with your
  preference. I don't want to quarrel with you, Frank," added John, softening,
  "I don't want to mistrust your good feelings or your honour. Perhaps you
  don't know her as well as I do; perhaps you can't appreciate her value like
  me. Many men would give away their lives for her&mdash;would think no
  sacrifice too dear at which to purchase her regard. Believe me, Frank, she's
  worth anything. If you have proposed to her, as I have reason to think you
  must have done, confide in me; I will smooth all difficulties; I will arrange
  everything for you both. God knows I love her better than anything on earth;
  but <i>her</i> happiness is my first consideration, and if she likes you,
  Frank, she shall marry you."</p>

  <p>Captain Lovell seemed to be of a different opinion. He bit his lip,
  looking angry and annoyed.</p>

  <p>"You go too fast, Mr. Jones," he replied very stiffly; "I have never given
  the young lady you mention an opportunity of either accepting or refusing me.
  If ever <i>I am</i> fool enough to marry, I shall take the liberty of
  selecting my own wife, without consulting your taste; and I really cannot
  undertake to wed every lively young lady that condescends to flirt with me,
  merely <i>pour passer le temps</i>."</p>

  <p>John's face grew dark with anger. How noble he looked as he squared his
  fine figure and reared his gallant head, standing erect before his enemy, and
  scanning him from top to toe. He was very quiet too; he only said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Captain Lovell, I claim a brother's right to protect Miss Coventry's
  reputation, and as a brother I demand reparation for the wrong you have done
  her; need I say any more?"</p>

  <p>"Not another syllable," replied Frank Lovell carelessly. "Whenever you
  like, only the sooner the better. Popham always acts for me on these
  occasions; he don't go away till to-morrow afternoon, so I refer you to him.
  I'm getting sleepy now, Mr. Jones. I wish you a good-night."</p>

  <p>Cousin John took up his candle, and retired. Never in my life had I been
  in such a position as this. That there would be a duel I had not the
  slightest shadow of doubt&mdash;and all for my sake. That my gallant,
  generous, true-hearted cousin should have behaved so nobly, so unselfishly,
  did not surprise me; but that he should be sacrificed to his devoted
  fidelity&mdash;I could not bear to think of it for a moment! How I loved him
  now! How I wondered that I could ever have compared the two for an instant!
  How I resolved to make him full amends, and, come what might, to frustrate
  this projected duel! But what could I do? In the first place, how was I to
  get out of the room?</p>

  <p>My situation was so embarrassing, and at the same time so ridiculous, that
  I could with difficulty resist a hysterical inclination to laugh. Here I was,
  at all events, a close prisoner till Captain Lovell should go to bed, and he
  seemed to have no idea of that rational proceeding, though it was now past
  three o'clock. He walked about the room, whistling softly. Once he came so
  near my hiding-place that I felt his breath on my cheek. "Good heavens,"
  thought I, "if he should take it into his head to have a shower-bath now to
  brace his nerves!" At last he walked to a drawer, selected a cigar, lit it,
  and throwing open the window, proceeded deliberately to get out. I almost
  hoped he would break his neck! But I conclude there was a ledge or balcony of
  some sort to sustain him, and that he was accustomed to a nightly cigar in
  that position. Here was a chance not to be lost! I bolted out of the
  shower-bath; I popped the extinguisher on one candle, and blew the other out
  at the same instant. I heard the smoker's exclamation of astonishment, but
  heeded it not. I rushed through the door. I flew along the dark passages,
  breathless and trembling; at last I reached my own room, more by instinct, I
  believe, than any other faculty, and having locked the door and struck a
  light, sat me down, in a state of immense confusion and bewilderment, to
  think what I should do next.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Who was there to whom I could apply? Sir Guy, of course, was
  out of the question. Then, in an affair of such delicacy, I could not consult
  a <i>young</i> man; besides, these boys, I fancy, are always for fighting,
  right or wrong. A woman was no use, or I should have gone straight back to
  Lady Scapegrace. I pondered matters over and over again. I thought of every
  horror in the way of duelling I had ever heard of.</p>

  <p>My own uncle was shot dead by a Frenchman when attached to the army of
  occupation at Cambray. It was a romantic story, and I had often heard the
  particulars from my godfather, General Grape, who officiated as his second.
  My uncle was a handsome, chivalrous youth, deeply attached to a countrywoman
  of his own, whose picture he wore constantly next his heart. Such a man was
  not likely to become compromised with another lady. It happened, however,
  that my uncle was quartered in the vicinity of a ch&agrave;teau belonging to a
  retired general of the Grand Army, who hated an Englishman as a matter of
  taste, and a British officer as a matter of duty.</p>

  <p>The French general had a charming daughter, and Rosalie, besides being
  <i>belle comme le jour</i>, was likewise what her acquaintance called <i>tant
  soit peu coquette</i>. So she made love to my uncle on every available
  opportunity, and of course, because he didn't care for her two pins, set her
  faithless heart upon him, as a woman will. To make things simpler, she was
  herself engaged to a young marquis in the neighbourhood. Well, my uncle, like
  a sensible man, did his best to keep clear of the whole thing, but he could
  not avoid meeting Rosalie occasionally in his walks, nor could he absolutely
  refuse to make her acquaintance, or refrain from perusing the letters she
  wrote to him, or, finally, prevent that forward young person from falling
  into his arms, and bursting into tears, with her head on his shoulder. The
  moment was, however, ill-chosen for so dramatic a scene, inasmuch as it
  occurred under the very noses of her father and her <i>fianc&eacute;</i>,
both of
  whom, unknown to the fair wanderer, had followed Rosalie, on purpose to find
  out where it was she walked day after day so perseveringly.</p>

  <p>My uncle had scarcely recovered his surprise at the first demonstration
  ere he was staggered by the second&mdash;"<i>Malheureuse!</i>" exclaimed the
  father; "<i>Perfide!</i>" groaned the lover; "<i>Tra tre!</i>" shouted the
  marquis; "<i>Lche!</i>" growled the general. My uncle turned from one to the
  other, completely at a nonplus, Rosalie in the meantime clinging to his
  breast and imploring him passionately to save her! My uncle's waistcoat came
  undone&mdash;his real mistress's miniature dropped out; the sight added fuel
  to the fire of the belligerents. Nothing would satisfy them but his blood. In
  vain he protested, in vain he swore, in extremely bad French, that he had no
  <i>penchant</i> for Rosalie, had never made love to her in his life; in fact,
  rather disliked her than otherwise.</p>

  <p>The Frenchmen <i>sacr&eacute;ed</i>, and fumed, and stormed at him, and
jostled
  him, till my uncle lost all patience, shook himself clear of Rosalie, who
  fell fainting to the ground, knocked each of his adversaries down in turn,
  and walked home to his quarters, very much disgusted with the world in
  general, and the wilfulness of French young ladies in particular. Of course
  he knew perfectly well it was not to end here. He sent for Grape, then a
  brother subaltern, and placed his honour in that officer's hands.</p>

  <p>No message came for two days, that interval having elapsed in consequence
  of a deadly quarrel between the marquis and the general as to who should take
  the thing up first. Grape firmly believes they decided the matter with small
  swords; another version is, that they played piquet for eight-and-forty hours
  to settle it&mdash;the best out of so many games. Be this how it may, the
  general appeared as the ostensible champion, and the marquis officiated as
  his <i>t&eacute;moin</i>. Grape, as my uncle's second, chose pistols for the
  weapons, and selected a retired piece of ground in a large garden near the
  chteau as the lists. I give the conclusion in his own words:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Horsingham was as cool as a cucumber, and the only thing
  that seemed to annoy him was a possibility that the cause of his
  <i>rencontre</i> might be misrepresented to her he loved at home.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Tell her I was faithful to the last,' said he to me as he
  squeezed my hand just before <i>I put him up</i>. 'Tell her, if I fall, that
  I never loved another; that my heart is pure and spotless as that white rose,
  which I will wear upon it for her sake.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"While he spoke, he plucked a white rose from a neighbouring
  bush, and in spite of my remonstrances fixed it in the breast of his
  close-fitting dark coat.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'What are you about, Charlie?' I urged. 'This is no time
  for romance. Don't you know all these cursed Frenchmen are dead shots? You
  might as well chalk out a bull's eye over the pit of your stomach!'</p>

  <p class="quote">"He was a romantic, foolish fellow. I can see him now,
  drawing himself up, and looking like a knight of the olden time, with his
  brightening eye, and his smooth, unruffled forehead."</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Give her the white rose,' he only said. 'She'll keep it
  when it's withered, perhaps. And tell her I never wavered&mdash;never for an
  hour!'"</p>

  <p class="quote">"I knew too well how it would be. From the instant he came
  on the ground the old general never took his eye off his man. What an eye it
  was! Cold and gray and leaden; half shut, like that of some wild animal, with
  a pupil that contracted visibly while I watched it. I knew my friend had no
  chance. I did all I could. As I had the privilege of placing the men, I
  stationed our adversary where he would have to look over his shoulder to see
  my signal, whilst my friend's face was turned towards me. They were to fire
  when I dropped my hat. I dropped it with a flourish. Alas! all was of no use.
  The general shot him right through the heart. I knew he would; and the bullet
  cut the stalk of the rose in two, smashed the lower part of the miniature,
  leaving only the face untouched, and poor Charlie Horsingham never spoke
  again. As we lifted him and unbuttoned his waistcoat, the two Frenchmen gazed
  at the miniature with looks of anger and curiosity. Great was their
  astonishment to behold the portrait of another than Rosalie. The younger man
  was much affected; he groaned aloud and covered his face with his hands. Not
  so the old general. '<i>Tenez</i>,' said he, wiping the barrel of his weapon
  on his glove, '<i>c'est dommage! je ne contais pas l&agrave;-dessus; mais, que
  voulez-vous? Peste! ce n'est qu'un Anglais de moins.</i>'"</p><br>

  <p>This is the carelessness with which men talk and think of human life; and
  here was my cousin about to go through the fearful ordeal, perhaps to be shot
  dead, like poor Charles Horsingham. The more I thought of it, the more
  resolutely I determined to prevent it. I had never taken off my
  dinner-dress&mdash;my candles were nearly burned down&mdash;the clock struck
  five&mdash;in two hours it would be daylight. There was not a moment to lose.
  All at once a bright thought struck me. I would rouse good old Mr. Lumley. He
  was clever, sensible, and respected; he was likewise a man of honour and a
  gentleman. With all his infirmities, I had seen him show energy enough when
  he could do any good. I would go to him at once; and I left my room with the
  resolution that I, for one, would move heaven and earth ere a hair of Cousin
  John's precious head should be imperilled on my account.</p>

  <p>I lit my candle and tripped once more along the silent passages. I knew
  where Mrs. Lumley slept, and soon reached the door of her room; audible
  snores, base and treble, attested, if not the good consciences, at least the
  sound digestions of the inmates. I tapped loudly; no answer. Again I knocked
  till my knuckles smarted. A sleepy "Come in" was the reply to my summons.
  They probably thought it was the housemaid arrived to open the shutters. It
  was no time for false delicacy or diffidence, and I walked boldly into the
  apartment. By the light of the night-lamp I beheld the happy pair. Of course,
  I am not going to describe the lady's dress; but all I can say is, that if
  ever I am prevailed on to marry, and such a catastrophe is by no means
  impossible, I shall <i>not</i> permit my husband to disfigure himself at any
  hour by adopting such a custom as that of dear, kind, good old Mr.
  Lumley.</p>

  <p>A white cotton nightcap, coming well over the ears, and tied under the
  throat with tape to match, surmounted by a high <i>bonnet rouge</i> like an
  extinguisher, the entire headdress being further secured by a broad black
  ribbon, would make Plato himself look ridiculous; and a sleepy old face, with
  a small turn-up nose, and a rough stubbly chin of unshaven gray, does not add
  to the beauty or the dignity of such a recumbent subject. However, what I
  wanted was Mr. Lumley; and Mr. Lumley I was forced to take as I could get
  him.</p>

  <p>"What's o'clock?" he murmured drowsily. "Come again to light the fire in
  half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Kate!" exclaimed his better half, rousing up, bright and warm,
  in a moment, like a child. "Goodness, Kate, what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Coventry!" ejaculated her husband. "What is it? A perfect specimen
  of the common house-spider, I'll lay my life. What an energetic girl! Found
  it on her pillow, and lost not a moment in bringing it here! I'm eternally
  obliged to you. Where is it? Mind you don't injure the legs. Pray don't stick
  a pin through the back."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Lumley!" I sobbed out, "it's worse than a spider. Get up, please;
  there's going to be a duel, and I want you to stop it. Captain Lovell and
  Cousin&mdash;Cousin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I fairly broke down here, and burst into tears; but the kind old man
  understood me in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Margery, my dear," he shouted, "get me up directly; there's not a moment
  to lose. Oh, these boys! these boys! young blood and absence of brains! If
  they would but devote their energies to science. Don't distress yourself, my
  dear; I'll manage it all. Where does Captain Lovell sleep?"</p>

  <p>"First door on the right, when you get down the steps in the Bachelors'
  wing," I replied unhesitatingly, much to the surprise of Mrs. Lumley. She
  would have known too, if she had been shut up there for a couple of hours in
  a shower-bath.</p>

  <p>"I'll go to him as soon as I'm dressed," promised Mr. Lumley. "I pledge
  you my honour he shan't fight till I give him leave. Go to bed, my dear, and
  leave everything in my hands. Don't cry, there's a good girl. By the way, the
  housemaids here are infernally officious; you haven't <i>seen</i> a good
  specimen of the common house-spider anywhere about, have you?"</p>

  <p>I assured the kind-hearted old naturalist I had not; and as he was already
  half out of bed, I took my departure, and sought my own couch&mdash;not to
  sleep, Heaven knows, but to toss and turn and tumble, and see horrid visions,
  waken as I was, and think of everything dreadful that might happen to my
  cousin, and confess to my own heart how I loved him now, and hated myself for
  having treated him as I had, and revel, as it were, in self-reproach and
  self-torture. It was broad daylight ere I fell into a sort of fitful dose, so
  out-wearied and over-excited was I, both in body and mind.</p>

        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">T is very disagreeable to face a large party with anything
  on your mind that you cannot help thinking must be known, or at least
  suspected, by your associates. When I came down to breakfast, after a hasty
  and uncomfortable toilette, and found the greater portion of the guests
  assembled at that gossiping meal, I could not help fancying that every
  listless dandy and affected fine lady present was acquainted with my
  proceedings during the last twelve hours, and was laughing in his or her
  sleeve accordingly. I cast a rapid and frightened glance round the table,
  and, to my infinite relief, beheld Cousin John eating his egg as composedly
  as possible; whilst a reassuring smile and a pleasant "Good-morning" from Mr.
  Lumley gave me to understand that his mediation had averted all fatal
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>The other guests ate and drank, and laughed and chattered much as usual;
  but still I could not help remarking on the face of each of them a subdued
  expression of intelligence, as though in possession of some charming bit of
  news or delightful morsel of scandal. Lady Scapegrace was the first to put me
  on a footing of equality with the rest.</p>

  <p>"We have lost some of our party, Kate," said she, as she handed me my tea.
  "I confess I suspected it last year, in London. She is a most amiable girl,
  and will have a large fortune."</p>

  <p>I looked at her ladyship as if I was dreaming.</p>

  <p>"You needn't be so surprised, Kate," said she, laughing at my utter
  bewilderment; "don't you miss anybody? Look round the table."</p>

  <p>Sure enough the Molasses party were absent, and there was no Frank Lovell.
  Then it was true, after all! He had sold himself to that lackadaisical young
  lady, and had been making a fool of <i>me</i>, Kate Coventry, the whole time.
  How angry I ought to have been! I was surprised to find I was <i>not</i>. On
  the contrary, my first feeling was one of inexpressible relief, as I thought
  there was now no earthly obstacle between myself and that kind face on the
  other side of the breakfast-table; though too soon a horrid tide of doubts
  and fears surged up as I reflected on my own unworthiness and caprice.</p>

  <p>How I had undervalued that noble, generous character! How often I had
  wounded and annoyed him in sheer carelessness or petulance, and thought
  little of inflicting on him days of pain to afford myself the short and
  doubtful amusement of an hour's flirtation and folly!</p>

  <p>What if he should cast <i>me</i> off now? What if he had obtained an
  insight into my character which had cured him entirely of any regard he might
  previously have entertained for me? What if I should find that I had all my
  life been neglecting the gem which I was too ignorant to appreciate, and now,
  when I knew its real value and would give my life for it, it was beyond my
  grasp?</p>

  <p>At all events, I would never forget <i>him</i>. Come what might now, I
  would never care for another. I felt quite glad Frank Lovell was as good as
  married, and out of the way. The instant I had swallowed my breakfast I put
  my bonnet on and rushed into the garden, for I felt as if fresh air was
  indispensable to my very existence. The first person I met amongst the
  flower-beds was dear old Mr. Lumley. He had hobbled out on his crutches
  purposely to give me an interview. I thanked him, as if he had been my
  father, for all his kindness; and he talked to me gently and considerately,
  as a parent would to a child.</p>

  <p>"I promised you, my dear, that they should not fight, and I think I have
  kept my word. Your cousin, Miss Coventry, is a noble fellow," said the old
  man, his benevolent features kindling into admiration; "but I had more
  difficulty with him than his antagonist. He would not be satisfied till
  Captain Lovell had assured him, on his honour, that you had yourself declined
  his advances in a manner which admitted of no misconstruction; and that then,
  and not till then, he considered himself free. You were right, my
  dear&mdash;I am an old man, and I take a great interest in you, so do not
  think me impertinent&mdash;you were right to have nothing to say to a
  <i>rou&eacute;</i> and a gambler.</p>

  <p>"I was not always the old cripple you are so forbearing with now. I lived
  in the world once, and saw a good deal of life and men. My experience has
  convinced me that selfishness is the bane of the generality of mankind; but
  that nowhere is it so thoroughly developed as in those who live what people
  call 'by their wits,' and enjoy all the luxuries and pleasures of life by
  dint of imposing on the world. I consider Frank Lovell, though we all vote
  him such a good fellow, one of that class, and I do not think he would have
  made a good husband to my young friend Miss Coventry. Your cousin, my dear,
  is a character of another stamp altogether; and if, as I hear everybody say,
  he is really to be married to that Welsh girl, I think you will agree with me
  that she has got a prize such as falls to the lot of few."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lumley was by this time out of breath; but I could not have answered
  him to save my life. Like one of his own favourite house-spiders, I had been
  unconsciously spinning a web of delightful self-delusion, and here came the
  ruthless housemaid and swept it all away. How blind I must have been not to
  see it long ago! John might be very fond of pheasant-shooting, and I believe,
  when the game is plentiful and the thing well managed, that sport is
  fascinating enough; but people don't travel night and day into such a country
  as Wales, where there are no railroads, merely for the purpose of standing in
  a ride and knocking over a certain quantity of half-tame fowls. No, no; I
  ought to have seen it long ago. I had lost him now, and <i>now</i> I knew his
  value when it was too late. Too late!&mdash;the knell that tolls over half
  the hopes and half the visions of life.</p>

  <p>Too late!&mdash;the one bitter drop that poisons the whole cup of success.
  Too late! The golden fruit has long hung temptingly just above your grasp;
  you have laboured and striven and persevered, and you seize it at last and
  press it to your thirsty lips. Dust and ashes are your reward. The fruit is
  still the same, but it is too late: your desire for it is gone, or your power
  of enjoying it has failed you at the very moment of fruition; all that
  remains to you is the keen pang of disappointment, or, worse still, the
  apathy of disgust. I might have made John my slave a few weeks ago, and
  <i>now</i>&mdash;it was too provoking, and for that Welsh girl too! How I
  hated everything Welsh! Not Ancient Pistol, eating his enforced leek with its
  accompanying sauce, could have entertained a greater aversion for the
  Principality than I did at that moment.</p>

  <p>Presently we were joined by Lady Scapegrace. She too had got something
  pleasant to say to me.</p>

  <p>"I told you so, Kate," she observed, taking my arm, and leading me down
  one of those secluded walks&mdash;"I told you so all along. Your friend
  Captain Lovell proposed to Miss Molasses yesterday. Don't blame him too much,
  Kate; if he's not married within three weeks, he'll be in the Bench. Never
  mind how I know, but I <i>do</i> know. I think he has behaved infamously to
  you, I confess; but take comfort, my dear&mdash;you are not the first by a
  good many."</p>

  <p>I put it to my impartial reader whether such a remark, though made with
  the kindest intentions, was not enough to drive any woman mad with spite. I
  broke away from Lady Scapegrace, and rushed back into the house. We were to
  leave Scamperley that day by the afternoon train. Gertrude was already
  packing my things; but I was obliged to go to the drawing-room for some work
  I had left there, and in the drawing-room I found a whole bevy of ladies
  assembled over their different occupations.</p>

  <p>Women never spare each other; and I had to go through the ordeal,
  administered ruthlessly, and with a refinement of cruelty known only to
  ourselves. Even Mrs. Lumley, my own familiar friend, had no mercy.</p>

  <p>"We ought to congratulate you, I conclude, Miss Coventry," said one.</p>

  <p>"He's a relation of yours, is he not?" inquired another.</p>

  <p>"Only a very great <i>friend</i>," laughed Mrs. Lumley, shaking her
  curls.</p>

  <p>"It's a great marriage for <i>him</i>," some one else went on to
  say&mdash;"far better than he deserves. Poor thing! he'll lead her a sad
  life; he's a shocking flirt!"</p>

  <p>Now, if there is one thing to my mind more contemptible than another, it
  is that male impostor whom ladies so charitably designate by the mild term "a
  flirt." It is all fair for <i>us</i> to have our little harmless vanities and
  weaknesses. We are shamefully debarred from the nobler pursuits and
  avocations of life; so we may be excused for passing the time in such trivial
  manoeuvres as we can invent to excite the envy of our own and triumph over
  the pride of the opposite sex. But that a man should lower himself to act the
  part of a slave, "tied to an apron-string," and voluntarily be a fool,
  without being an honest one&mdash;it is too degrading!</p>

  <p>Such a despicable being does us an infinity of harm: he encourages us to
  display all the worst points of the female character; he cheats us of our due
  amount of homage from many a noble heart, and perhaps robs us of our own
  dignity and self-respect. Yet such is the creature we encourage in our blind
  vanity, and whilst we vote him "so pleasant and agreeable," temper our
  commendation with the mild remonstrance, "though I am afraid he's rather a
  flirt!"</p>

  <p>I saw the drawing-room on that morning was no place for me; so I folded my
  work, and curbing my tongue, which I own had a strong inclination to take its
  part in the war of words, I sought my own room, and found there, in addition
  to the litter and discomfort inseparable from the process of packing, a
  letter just arrived by the post. It was in Cousin Amelia's hand, and bore the
  Dangerfield postmark. "What now?" I thought, dreading to open it lest it
  might contain some fresh object of annoyance, some further inquiries or
  remarks calculated to irritate my already overdriven temper out of due
  bounds.</p>

  <p>"Cousin Amelia never writes to me unless she has something unpleasant to
  say," was my mental observation, "and a very little more would fill the cup
  to overflowing. Whatever happens, I am determined not to cry; rather than
  face all those ladies with red eyes when I go to wish Lady Scapegrace
  good-bye, I would forego the pleasure of ever receiving a letter or hearing a
  bit of news again!"</p>

  <p>So I popped Cousin Amelia's epistle into my pocket without breaking the
  seal, and put on my bonnet at once, that I might be ready to start, and not
  keep Cousin John waiting.</p>

  <p>The leavetaking was got over more easily than I expected. People generally
  hustle one off in as great a hurry as the common decencies of society would
  admit of, in order to shorten as much as possible the unavoidable g&ecirc;ne
of
  parting. Sir Guy, staunch to his colours, was to drive me back on the
  detested drag; but his great face fell several inches when I expressed my
  determination to perform the journey <i>this</i> time <i>inside</i>.</p>

  <p>"I've bitted the team on purpose for you, Miss Kate," he exclaimed, with
  one of his usual oaths, "and now you throw me over at the last moment. Too
  bad; by all that's disappointing, it's too bad! Come now, think better of it;
  put on my box-coat, and catch hold of 'em, there's a good girl."</p>

  <p>"<i>Inside</i>, or not at all, Sir Guy," was my answer; and I can be
  pretty determined, too, when I choose.</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps your maid would like to come on the box," urged the Baronet,
  who seemed to have set his heart on the enjoyment of <i>some</i> female
  society.</p>

  <p>"Gertrude goes with me," I replied stoutly; for I thought Cousin John
  looked pleased, and Sir Guy was at a nonplus.</p>

  <p>"Awfully high temper," he muttered, as he took his reins and placed his
  foot on the roller-bolt. "I like 'em saucy, I own, but this girl's a regular
  vixen!"</p>

  <p>Sir Guy was very much put out, and vented his annoyance on his
  off-wheeler, "double-thonging" that unfortunate animal most unmercifully the
  whole way to the station. He bade me farewell with a coldness, and almost
  sulkiness, quite foreign to his usual demeanour, and infinitely pleasanter to
  my feelings. Besides, I saw plainly that the more I fell in the Baronet's
  good opinion, the higher I rose in that of my <i>chaperone</i>; and by the
  time John and I were fairly settled in a <i>coup&eacute;</i>, my cousin had
got back
  to his old, frank, cordial manner, and I took courage to break the seal of
  Cousin Amelia's letter, and peruse that interesting document, regardless of
  all the sarcasms and innuendoes it might probably contain.</p>

  <p>What a jumble of incongruities it was! Long stories about the weather, and
  the garden, and the farm, and all sorts of things which no one knew better
  than I did had no interest for my correspondent whatever. I remarked,
  however, throughout the whole composition, that "mamma's" sentiments and
  regulations were treated with an unusual degree of contempt, and the writer's
  own opinions asserted with a boldness and freedom I had never before observed
  in my strait-laced, hypocritical cousin. Mr. Haycock's name, too, was very
  frequently brought on the <i>tapis</i>: he seemed to have breakfasted with
  them, lunched with them, walked, driven, played billiards with them, and, in
  short, to have taken up his residence almost entirely at Dangerfield. The
  postscript explained it all, and the postscript I give verbatim as I read it
  aloud to Cousin John whilst we were whizzing along at the rate of forty miles
  an hour.</p>

  <p class="letter">"P.S.&mdash;I am sure my dear Kate will give me joy. You
  cannot have forgotten a <u>certain</u> person calling this autumn at
  Dangerfield for a <u>certain</u> purpose, in which he did not seem clearly to
  know his own mind. Everything is now explained. My dear Herod (is it not a
  pretty Christian name!)&mdash;my dear Herod is all that I can wish, and
  assures me that all along <u>it</u> was intended for me. The <u>happy day</u>
  is not yet fixed; but my dearest Kate may rest assured that I will not fail
  to give her the <u>earliest intelligence</u> on the <u>first opportunity</u>.
  Tell Mr. Jones I shall be married before him, after all."</p><br>

  <p>The last sentence escaped my lips without my meaning it. Had I not come
  upon it unexpectedly, I think I should have kept it to myself. John blushed,
  and looked hurt. For a few minutes there was a disagreeable silence, which we
  both felt awkward. He was the first to break it.</p>

  <p>"Kate," said he, "do you think I shall be married before Miss
  Horsingham?"</p>

  <p>"How can I tell?" I replied, looking steadfastly out of the window, whilst
  my colour rose and my heart beat rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe that Welsh story, Kate?" proceeded my cousin.</p>

  <p>I knew by his voice it <i>couldn't</i> be true; I <i>felt</i> it was a
  slander; and I whispered, "No."</p>

  <p>"One more question, Kate," urged Cousin John, in a thick, low voice. "Why
  did you refuse Frank Lovell?"</p>

  <p>"He never proposed to me," I answered; "I never gave him an
  opportunity."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said my cousin.</p>

  <p>"Because I liked some one else better," was my reply; and I think those
  few words settled the whole business.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>I shall soon be five-and-twenty now, and on my birthday I am to be
  married. Aunt Deborah has got better ever since it has all been settled.
  Everybody seems pleased, and I am sure no one can be better pleased than I
  am. Only Lady Horsingham says, "Kate will <i>never</i> settle." I think I
  know better. I think I shall make none the worse a wife because I can walk,
  and ride, and get up early, and stand all weathers, and love the simple,
  wholesome, natural pleasures of the country. John thinks so too, and that is
  all I need care about.</p>

  <p>I have such a charming trousseau, though I am ashamed to say I take very
  little pleasure in looking at it. But kind, thoughtful Cousin John has
  presented Brilliant with an entirely new set of clothing; and I think my
  horse seems almost more delighted with his finery than his mistress is with
  hers. My Cousin and I ride together every day. Dear me, how delightful it is
  to think that I shall always be as happy as I am now!</p>
