  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>I. &mdash; DESTINY IN AN EGG-CHEST</h2>

  <h3>(JASPER GRAY'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">A CRAB of mature age and experience is represented by an
  ancient writer as offering advice to his son somewhat in these terms: "My
  son, I have observed in you a most regrettable tendency to walk with
  ungraceful and unbecoming sidelong steps. Pray endeavour to conquer this
  pernicious habit and to adopt a straightforward and direct mode of
  progression."</p>

  <p>Excellent advice! Though the gait of the existing generation of crabs
  leads one to fear that it failed to take effect.</p>

  <p>The ancient parable was brought to my mind by the cigarette that I was
  lighting; for I had been the recipient of some most excellent paternal advice
  on the subject of cigarettes, coupled with the same on Irish whisky. My
  revered parent had, in fact, actually removed a choice Egyptian from his
  mouth the better to expound the subject; and, pointing to the accumulated
  ends on the hearth and the half empty bottle on the mantelpiece, had
  explained with his admirable lucidity that these unsubstantial gauds were the
  inefficient substitutes for bacon for breakfast.</p>

  <p>And yet I smoked. I did not consume Irish whisky, though I was perhaps
  restrained by reasons that were economic rather than ethical. But I smoked
  cigarettes; and recently I had started a pipe, having made the interesting
  discovery that the paternal cigarette ends were capable of reincarnation in a
  pipe-bowl.</p>

  <p>I lit my cigarette and reflected on life and its problems. I was at the
  moment seated on a folded sack in an up-ended two-wheeled truck or hand-cart.
  In that truck I had conveyed a heavy bale of stationery from my employers,
  Messrs. Sturt and Wopsall, to a customer at Mile End; after which I had drawn
  the empty truck into a quiet yard, up-ended it and taken my seat in it as
  aforesaid. Since that day I have sat in many a more luxurious seat; in club
  divans, in hansom cabs, yea! even in the chariots of the mighty. But never
  have I found one quite equal to an up-ended truck with its floor turned to
  windward and a folded sack interposed between its tail and my own. There is
  much to be said for the simple life.</p>

  <p>At this time I was just turned seventeen, and needless to say, I was quite
  poor. But poor boy as I was, there were many things for which I had to be
  thankful. In the first place I enjoyed the supreme advantage of having
  escaped education&mdash;or rather, I should say, the particular brand that is
  supplied by the State. Other boys of like indigence were hauled off to Board
  Schools, where they contracted measles, chicken-pox, ringworm and a most
  hideous accent, which would cling to them and, socially speaking, damn them
  hopelessly for ever, even though they should subsequently rise&mdash;or
  sink&mdash;to millionairedom.</p>

  <p>From this curse I was exempt. My accent was that of the upper
  middle-class, my vocabulary that of the man of culture; I could manage my
  aitches and express myself in standard speech. If the present was meagre, the
  future held untold potentialities; and this was the priceless gift of
  circumstance.</p>

  <p>My father was a clergyman; or rather, I should say, he had been a
  clergyman. Why he had ceased to be a clergyman I never knew, though I
  associated the cessation of pastoral activities directly or indirectly with
  his complexion. When I knew him he was what he called a classical tutor and
  other people called a crammer; and the "crammees" being mostly of humble
  station, though ambitious, his income was meagre and precarious even at
  that.</p>

  <p>But he was a wonderful man. He could construe the most difficult passages
  from the ancient authors and work out intricate problems in spherical
  trigonometry, when, from causes which I need not dwell upon, the functions of
  his legs were in temporary abeyance; on which occasions he would sit on the
  floor, for the excellent reason&mdash;as he lucidly explained&mdash;that "the
  direction of the force of gravity being geocentric, it was impossible to fall
  off." Yes, he was a remarkable man, and should surely have attained to
  distinction in the church. Not, to be sure, that you can conveniently sit on
  the floor to conduct morning service; but what I mean is that a man must be
  accounted more than ordinarily gifted in whom, once more to adopt his
  admirable phraseology, "the effect of alcoholic stimulation is merely to
  induce motor inco-ordination unaccompanied by psychical confusion."</p>

  <p>I must not, however, allow mere family pride to lead me into digressions
  of unreasonable length. To return to the present incident. The cigarette had
  dwindled to about an inch and a half, and I was beginning to consider the
  resumption of locomotive activities, when a man stopped at the entrance of
  the yard and then slowly advanced towards me. I thought he was going to order
  me to move on. But he did not. He sauntered down the yard, and, halting
  opposite the truck, surveyed me attentively until I became quite embarrassed
  and a little annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Want a job, young feller?" he asked at length.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," I replied. "I've got one."</p>

  <p>"So I see. Looks a pretty soft one, too. How much do they pay yer for
  sittin' in that truck?"</p>

  <p>Of course it was no concern of his; but I was a civil youth and replied
  simply: "Ten shillings a week."</p>

  <p>"And are they going to give yer a pension?"</p>

  <p>"They may if I sit here long enough," I answered.</p>

  <p>He pondered this statement thoughtfully and then resumed: "Sure yer don't
  want a job? Wouldn't care to earn five bob, for instance?"</p>

  <p>Now this was a different matter. Five shillings was half my weekly wage. I
  was not pressed for time, for I had run all the way with the loaded truck and
  was entitled to loiter on the return journey.</p>

  <p>"'What sort of job is it?" I asked, "and how long will it take?"</p>

  <p>"It's to carry a case from Mansell Street to Byleses Wharf. Take yer about
  'arf a hour."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said I. "Five shillings is agreed upon, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Five bob it is; to be paid on delivery. You cut along to Mansell Street,
  right 'and side next door to the 'bacca shop what's got the image of a nigger
  outside. I'll just mizzle on ahead and tell 'em you're coming."</p>

  <p>He turned and left the yard at a much more sprightly pace than that at
  which he had entered, and immediately vanished from my sight. But he
  evidently discharged his mission, for, when I arrived at the house indicated,
  a seedy-looking man accosted me.</p>

  <p>"Are you the bloke what's come for that case of eggs?"</p>

  <p>"I've come for a case that's to go to Byles Wharf," I replied.</p>

  <p>"That's right," said he. "And mind you're careful with that there case.
  J'ever hear about Humpty Dumpty what sat on a wall?"</p>

  <p>I replied that I was quite familiar with the legend.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he. "There's two thousand of 'em in that case, so you go
  slow and don't get a-joltin' 'em. We don't want 'em made into omlicks before
  their time. Now then; just hold that truck steady."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, two men came out of the house carrying a large, oblong case
  on the top side, of which was pasted an enormous label inscribed, "Fragile.
  This side up." I steadied the truck by its pole and they slid the case into
  position with extraordinary care while the seedy person stood by to
  superintend and admonish. Having settled it securely, they wiped their hands
  on the backs of their trousers and retired into the house, when the seedy one
  administered a final caution.</p>

  <p>"Remember what I told yer, young covey. Don't you go a-gallopin' that
  there case over the cobbles or a-bangin' it aginst lamp-posts, and you'd best
  take the back ways so as not to get run into by fire-ingines or sechlike.
  D'ye ogle?"</p>

  <p>I assured him that I ogled perfectly and he then requested me to
  skedaddlle; which I did with the air and at the pace of one conducting a
  modest funeral.</p>

  <p>But my circumspect manner and elaborate care seemed only to invite
  assaults from without. In Upper East Smithfield a van, attempting to pass me
  at a wobbling canter, caught the corner of the precious case a bang that was
  enough to have turned the whole consignment into "omlicks"; and any that
  remained whole were like to have been addled by the van-driver's comments.
  Then in Pennington Street a man came running round a corner with a barrowful
  of empty casks; and I only escaped being capsized by turning quickly and
  receiving the impact of the collision on the back of the case. And, finally,
  an intoxicated Swedish seaman insisted on accompanying me down nearly the
  entire length of Old Gravel Lane, performing warlike music on the end of the
  case with a ship-wright's mallet.</p>

  <p>As I turned into the gateway of Byles Wharf I looked anxiously at my
  charge, rather expecting to find some oozing of yellow liquid from its
  joints. But no such traces of its stormy passage were visible and I ventured
  to hope that the packing was better than I had been led to believe. Just
  inside the yard I encountered, somewhat to my surprise, the seedy stranger of
  Mansell Street, with another even seedier.</p>

  <p>"Here you are then, young covey," said the former. "I hope you've been
  careful with them eggs."</p>

  <p>I assured him that I had been most careful but I did not think it
  necessary to mention that some other people had not. After all, you can't
  mend eggs, so the less said the better.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he; "you stay here a minute while I go and see if
  they're ready."</p>

  <p>The two men went away and disappeared round the corner of a shed, leaving
  me holding the pole of the truck. Now the act of standing still and holding
  the pole of a truck soon becomes monotonous, especially to a youth of
  seventeen. Half unconsciously I began, presently, to vary the monotony by
  working the pole up and down like a pump-handle. That couldn't hurt the eggs,
  and it produced a measured creak of the truck-springs that was interesting
  and pleasing.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there smote on my ear a hoarse and muffled voice, which exclaimed
  fiercely: "Keep still, can't yer!"</p>

  <p>I stopped instantly and looked around me. I had not noticed anyone near,
  and I didn't see anyone now. Could there be a ventriloquist hiding somewhere
  in the yard? The idea set my youthful curiosity aflame. I couldn't see him.
  But perhaps I could induce him to speak again and then I might locate the
  sound.</p>

  <p>I renewed my application to the pump-handle with increased vigour, and the
  truck-springs squeaked joyously. The experiment was a perfect success. At the
  fourth or fifth squeak a savage but muffled voice exclaimed, rather louder
  than before: "Keep still, I tell yer, yer young blighter!"</p>

  <p>The mystery was solved. There was no doubt this time as to where the voice
  came from. It came from inside the case. Eggs indeed! And then I thought of
  the Swedish sailor and I am afraid I grinned.</p>

  <p>The joy of a youth of my age at this romantic discovery may easily be
  imagined. Instantly my mind began to evolve speculations as to the identity
  of the imprisoned man. He seemed to take his incarceration in a philosophic
  spirit, though the Swedish mariner must have been a trial, to say nothing of
  the other incidents. But at this point my reflections were cut short by the
  reappearance of the two seedy strangers.</p>

  <p>"Now, young shaver," said my original employer; "bring them eggs along
  this way."</p>

  <p>He preceded me round the corner to the quay, alongside of which lay a
  barge with a hoisting tackle rigged from the end of a mast-derrick. There I
  was directed to halt and my two friends proceeded to lift the case tenderly
  out of the truck.</p>

  <p>"Now you can mizzle," said the seedier of the two.</p>

  <p>"I want my five shillings," said I.</p>

  <p>The man put his hand in his pocket and produced a half-crown, which he
  presented to me. I examined it critically and held it out to him.</p>

  <p>"This is no use," I said. "It's pewter. Besides, I was to have five
  shillings."</p>

  <p>He was about to argue the point when the other man broke in impatiently:
  "Don't play the goat, Jim. Give the cove his dibs"; on which the first man
  produced&mdash;from another pocket&mdash;five shillings of undoubtedly
  official origin. I pocketed them after careful scrutiny and offered him the
  "snide" half-crown. But he waved it aside magnanimously.</p>

  <p>"You can keep that," said he. "'T'ain't no good to me if it's a wrong 'un.
  And now you can cut your lucky."</p>

  <p>My "lucky" took me about a dozen yards along the quay, where I drew up
  behind a pile of bales to watch the progress of this stirring drama. The
  barge's tackle-rope had a sling hooked on the end, and this was now carefully
  passed round the case. The fall of the rope was put on the mast-winch, and,
  when all was ready, the word was given to "heave away." The men at the winch
  according hove away. The pawls clinked merrily, the rope tightened, the case
  rose clear of the ground and swung out like the bob of an enormous
  pendulum.</p>

  <p>And then came the disaster. The barge was secured to two mooring-posts and
  was about ten feet away from the quay, so that the derrick had to be hauled
  over by guy-ropes. But the case had not been properly balanced in the sling;
  and no sooner had it swung clear of the edge of the quay than it began to
  slip through the rope loop.</p>

  <p>"Look alive!" roared someone on the quay. "She's a-slippin'!"</p>

  <p>One of the men left the winch and rushed for the guy-rope. But it was too
  late. Slowly, inexorably, the case slid through the loop and fell with a
  resounding plop! into the water.</p>

  <p>An agonised yell arose from the quay and a furious stampede among the
  onlookers. The bargees snatched up boat-hooks and setting-poles and scrambled
  along the deck. But, alas! A swift tide was running, and the case, gyrating
  and dancing like a cork in a mill race, was out of reach before the first
  boat-hook could be got over the side.</p>

  <p>A barge's dinghy was made fast at the foot of a ladder hard by. Abandoning
  the truck, I slithered down the ladder, closely followed by a barge-boy, and
  we met in the boat with mutual recriminations. But there was no time to
  argue. The boy cast off the painter, and snatching up the paddle, dropped it
  in the transom-notch and began to scull furiously down stream. Ahead of us,
  we could see the case dancing along on the tide, turning round and round,
  vanishing and reappearing among the tiers of shipping. Presently, too, I saw
  another boat start in pursuit and recognised my two friends among its
  occupants.</p>

  <p>But the case had got a flying start and pursuit was difficult among the
  crowded shipping. We were beginning to overhaul it when it disappeared behind
  a cargo steamer, and when we next saw it, it had been neatly snared by a
  couple of ropes and was being hoisted by hand through the gangway of a little
  Welsh schooner that was just hauling out of the tiers. The barge-boy and I
  approached the schooner on the off shore side and climbed on board unnoticed;
  for the other boat, containing my seedy acquaintances had just arrived on the
  in-shore side. My employer proceeded to state his claim. "Hi, Captain! That
  there's my case."</p>

  <p>The captain leaned over the bulwark and regarded him with an affable
  smile.</p>

  <p>"D'y'ear," my friend repeated. "That case belongs to me."</p>

  <p>The captain's smile broadened. "Belonged," he corrected blandly.</p>

  <p>"What d'yer mean?" demanded the seedy one. "You ain't going to try to
  stick to my property?"</p>

  <p>The captain maintained his affable manner. "This is a case of salvage,"
  said he.</p>

  <p>"Git out," rejoined the other. "It's a case of eggs; and they're my
  eggs."</p>

  <p>"Did you lay 'em yourself?" enquired the captain (a good deal nearer the
  mark than he thought). The question seemed to irritate my seedy friend, for
  he replied angrily: "Never you mind 'oo laid 'em. You just hand that case
  over."</p>

  <p>At this moment there came a diversion. One of the sailors, who had been
  closely examining the case as it lay dribbling on the deck, suddenly started
  back, like a cat who has inadvertently smelt a hedgehog.</p>

  <p>"Golly wores!" he exclaimed. "There's some-think alive inside!"</p>

  <p>"Hey! what's that?" demanded the captain.</p>

  <p>"There is, sir, swelp me! I 'eard it a-movin' about."</p>

  <p>The captain looked sharply over the bulwark. "Here you, mister!" he sang
  out, "you haven't been sitting on those eggs, have you?"</p>

  <p>"Sittin' on 'em? What d'yer mean?"</p>

  <p>"Because they seem to have hatched themselves and the chickens are running
  about inside the case."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and they're usin' the most shockin' langwidge, too," said an elderly
  seaman who had been pressing his ear to a crack in the case.</p>

  <p>This report, reaching the occupants of the boat, caused very evident
  dismay. But my late employer made a last effort.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense," he said, sulkily. "Pass that case over and I'll pay
  what's doo for salvage in reason."</p>

  <p>"Not me," replied the captain. "I'm goin' to broach that case and see
  what's inside."</p>

  <p>The effect of this decision was rather curious. The men in the boat
  consulted together hurriedly; then their craft was turned about and rowed
  away rapidly in the direction whence they had come.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the captain and his myrmidons proceeded to operate on the case.
  Producing one or two small crow-bars, they neatly prised up the lid and threw
  it back; when there rose from the case, some what after the fashion of the
  obsolete toy known as "Jack-in-the-box," no less a person than the man who
  had originally chartered my truck. He stepped out sullenly and confronting
  the group of grinning seamen, remarked, in, perhaps justifiably, emphatic
  terms, that he had had enough of that mode of travelling for the present.</p>

  <p>The captain looked at him attentively, and he looked at the captain; and
  then ensued a whispered conversation between them, which was interrupted by
  one of the crew remarking:</p>

  <p>"Looks like the police boat, don't it?"</p>

  <p>The passenger turned and stared wildly in the direction indicated. A
  police gig was approaching slowly but doggedly over the strong tide; and
  besides the amphibious officials were two men in civilian garb who sat in the
  stern-sheets and kept their eyes ominously glued on the schooner.</p>

  <p>The passenger bobbed down behind the high bulwark and gazed about him
  despairingly; and suddenly his eye lighted on me.</p>

  <p>"Here, boy," he said, "get into that case."</p>

  <p>"No thank you," said I.</p>

  <p>He dived his hand frantically into his pocket and brought it out with a
  shining, yellow burden that clinked musically.</p>

  <p>"Here, boy," he pleaded. "Here's five quid for you if you'll get into that
  case and let 'em nail it up."</p>

  <p>Five sovereigns! It was a fortune to a lad in my position. And there
  really was no particular risk. I examined the coins&mdash;I was a fairly
  expert judge of money from my occupation, which often included "payment on
  delivery"&mdash;and found them genuine; and I succumbed. Stowing the money in
  an inside pocket, I stepped into the case and hunched myself up so as to
  occupy comfortably the rather limited accommodation.</p>

  <p>"Don't you drop the case into the water again!" I said.</p>

  <p>"Right-o, Sonny!" the captain answered. "We'll handle you carefully. Now
  there, look sharp!"</p>

  <p>The lid was clapped on, a few smart but not noisy blows of a hammer drove
  home the nails, and I began to earn my magnificent wage. The interior of the
  case was unpleasantly damp and stuffy, though a sufficiency of air and a few
  streaks of light came through the chinks of the lid. Sounds from without also
  reached me freely and consisted, for the present, chiefly of suppressed
  laughter from the sailors and admonitions from the captain.</p>

  <p>"Stow that chap down in the lazarette, Fred," said the latter; "and you
  men, don't stand about laughing like a lot o' fools. Get that tow-rope ready
  for the tug. Here comes the police boat."</p>

  <p>There was a pause after this with some scuffling about the deck and a good
  deal of sniggering. Then I heard a sharp, official voice. "What's this case,
  Captain?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," was the reply. "Belongs to those men that you see running
  up them steps. They hooked it when they saw your boat coming."</p>

  <p>"That's Jim Trout," said another voice; "and Tommy Bayste with him. What's
  in the case, Captain?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say. Seems to be something alive in it."</p>

  <p>"There!" said the first official. "What did I tell you, Smith. It's Powis
  right enough. We'd better get him out of the case and clap the darbies on
  him."</p>

  <p>"Not on my ship, you won't," said the captain. "I can't have any criminals
  let loose here just as I'm hauling out to go to sea. You'd better take the
  case ashore and open it there."</p>

  <p>"Gad!" exclaimed Smith; "the Captain's right, Sergeant. We'd better drop
  the case into the boat and take it ashore. Powis is an ugly customer to
  handle. He might capsize us all into the river."</p>

  <p>"That's true," agreed the sergeant. "We'll take him as he is if the
  Captain will have the case let down into our boat."</p>

  <p>The captain was most willing for certain private reasons not entirely
  unconnected with the lazarette. I heard and felt a rope sling passed round
  the case and my heart was brought into my mouth by the squeal of
  tackle-blocks. For a few seconds the case swung horribly in mid-air; then, to
  my unspeakable relief, I felt it subside on to the floor of the boat.</p>

  <p>A good deal of laughter and facetious talk mingled with the measured sound
  of the oars as I was borne away. Suddenly the sergeant laughed out
  boisterously like a man who has had a funny idea. And apparently he had.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what, Smith," he chuckled; "we won't open the case till we
  get to Holloway. We'll take it right into the reception ward. Ha! Ha!"</p>

  <p>The joke was highly appreciated by Mr. Smith and his colleagues&mdash;a
  good deal more than it was by me; for I had had enough of my quarters
  already&mdash;and they were still in full enjoyment of it when another voice
  sang out: "Keep clear of that tug, West. She'll be right on top of us. Hi!
  Tug ahoy! Look out! Where the dev&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here there came an alarming bump and a confused chorus of shouts arose.
  The case canted over sharply, there was a fearful splash, and immediately, to
  my horror, water began to ooze in through the cracks between the boards. Two
  or three minutes of dreadful suspense followed. A loud churning noise sounded
  close at hand, waves seemed to be breaking over the case, and I had a
  sensation as if my residence were being dragged swiftly through the
  water.</p>

  <p>It didn't last very long. Presently I felt the case run aground. Then it
  was lifted on to what I judged to be a barrow; which immediately began to
  move off over an abominably rough road at a pace which may have been
  necessary but was excessively uncomfortable to me.</p>

  <p>Hitherto very little had been said. A few muttered directions were all
  that I had been able to catch. But now a newcomer appeared to join our
  procession, and I began to gather a few particulars of the rescue.</p>

  <p>"Any of the coppers drowned, d'ye think, Bill?"</p>

  <p>"Not as I knows of. I see 'em all a-crawlin' up on to a dumb barge."</p>

  <p>"Where's the tug now?"</p>

  <p>"Islington, I should think. We left 'er on the mud with 'er propeller
  goin' round like blazes."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with Powis, Bill?"</p>

  <p>"We're going to shove the case into Ebbstein's crib and then nip off to
  Spitalfields with the barrer. And we've got to look slippery, or we'll have
  the coppers on our heels, to say nothin' of them tug blokes. They'll be
  wantin' our scalps, I reckon, when they find their craft on the mud."</p>

  <p>This conversation was by no means reassuring. I was certainly out of the
  frying-pan but it remained to be seen what sort of fire I had dropped
  into.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile I carefully stowed my treasure in a secret receptacle inside the
  back of my waistcoat and braced myself as well as I could to resist the
  violent jolting and bumping caused by the combined effects of speed,
  indifferent springs and an abominably rough road. It was during a
  readjustment of my position after a more than usually violent joggle that my
  hand, seeking a more secure purchase on the wet surface, came into contact
  with a small body which felt somewhat like a flat button. I took it between
  my fingers and tried by the sense of touch to determine what it was, but
  could make out no more than that it was hard and smooth, flat and oval in
  shape and about half an inch long. This did not tell me much, and indeed I
  was not acutely interested in the question as to what the thing might be; but
  eventually, on the bare chance that it might turn out to be something of
  value, I deposited it in my secret pocket for examination on some more
  favourable occasion. Then I wedged myself afresh and awaited further
  developments.</p>

  <p>I had not long to wait. Presently the barrow stopped. I felt the case
  lifted off and carried away. The light ceased to filter in through the cracks
  of the lid and was replaced by a curious, sour smell. A muttered conversation
  with someone who spoke very imperfect English was followed by another brief
  journey and then the case came to rest on a wooden floor and the smell grew
  more intense. A confused jabbering in an uncouth foreign tongue seemed to
  pervade the foul air, but this was soon interrupted by the unmistakable
  English voice that I had heard before.</p>

  <p>"I'll soon 'ave it open, Ebbstein, if you've got a jemmy. That's the
  ticket, mate. Look out, there, inside!"</p>

  <p>The beak of the jemmy drove in under the top edge; one or two quick jerks
  dislodged the nails, the lid was lifted clear and I popped up as the last
  occupant had done. A swift, comprehensive glance showed me an ill-lighted
  frowsy room with a coke fire on which a tailor's "goose" was heating; a large
  work-board on which were piled a quantity of unfinished clothing, and three
  wild-looking women, each holding a half-made garment and all motionless like
  arrested clockwork figures, with their eyes fixed on me. Besides these, and a
  barrel filled with herrings and cut cabbage floating in a clear liquid, were
  the two men who confronted me; of whom one was a common, stubbly-haired
  English East-Ender while the other was a pale, evil-looking foreigner, with
  high cheek-bones, black, up-standing hair and a black beard that looked like
  a handful of horsehair stuffing.</p>

  <p>"Blimey!" ejaculated the Englishman, as I rose into view; "'t'aint Powis
  at all! Who the blazes are you?"</p>

  <p>"Who is he!" hissed the foreigner, glaring at me fiercely, "I will tell
  you. He is a bolice spy!" and his hand began to creep under his
  coat-skirt.</p>

  <p>The Englishman held up his hand. "Now none o' that, Ebbstein," said he.
  "You foreigners are so bloomin' excitable. Tell us who you are, young
  un."</p>

  <p>I told them all I knew, including the name of the schooner&mdash;the
  Gladwys of Cardiff&mdash;and I could see that Ebbstein rejected the whole
  story as a manifest fable. Not so the Englishman. After a moment's
  reflection, he asked sharply: "How much did he give you for getting into that
  case?"</p>

  <p>"Five shillings and a duffer," I replied promptly, having anticipated the
  question.</p>

  <p>"Where's the five bob?" he asked; and I indicated my left trouser's
  pocket. Instantly and with remark able skill, he slipped his hand into the
  pocket and fished out the three coins.</p>

  <p>"Right you are," said he, spreading them out on his palm; "one for you,
  Ebb, one for me and one for yourself, young un," and here, with a sly grin,
  he returned me the pewter half-crown, which I pocketed.</p>

  <p>"And now," he continued, "the question is what we're to do with this young
  toff. We can't let him run loose just now. He might mention our address."
  Ebbstein silently placed one finger under his beard; but the other man shook
  his head impatiently.</p>

  <p>"That's the worst of you foreigners," said he; "you're so blooming
  unconstitootional. This ain't Russian Poland. Don't you understand that this
  boy was seen to get into that case and that the coppers'll be askin' for him
  presently? You'd look a pretty fine fool if they was to come here for him and
  you'd only got cold meat to offer 'em. Have you got a empty room?"</p>

  <p>"Dere is der top room, vere Chonas vorks," said Ebbstein.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Shove him in there and lock him in. And you take my tip, young
  feller, and don't give Mr. Ebbstein no trouble."</p>

  <p>"Are you going away?" I asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to see what's happened to my pal; but you'll see me back here
  some time to-night."</p>

  <p>After a little further discussion, the pair hustled me up the grimy,
  ruinous stairs to the top of the house and introduced me to an
  extraordinarily filthy garret, where, after a brief inspection of the window,
  they left me, locking the door and removing the key.</p>

  <p>The amazing folly of the ordinary criminal began to dawn on me when I
  proceeded to lighten the tedium of confinement by examining my prison. I was
  shut up here, presumably, because I knew too much; and behold! I was
  imprisoned in a room which contained incriminating objects connected with at
  least two different kinds of felony. An untidy litter of plaster moulds, iron
  ladles, battered pewter pots and crude electrical appliances let me into the
  secret at once. For, young as I was, I had learned a good deal about the
  seamy side of London life, and I knew a coiner's outfit when I saw it. So,
  too, a collection of jemmies, braces, bits and skeleton keys was quite
  intelligible; these premises were used by a coiner&mdash;presumably Mr.
  'Chonas'&mdash;and a burglar, who was possibly Ebbstein himself.</p>

  <p>I examined all the tools and appliances with boyish curiosity, and was
  quite interested for a time, especially when I discovered the plaster mould
  of a half-crown, very sharp and clear and coated with polished black lead,
  which seemed to correspond with the 'Duffer' in my pocket. The resemblance
  was so close that I brought forth the coin and compared it with the mould,
  and was positively thrilled when they proved to be one and the same coin.</p>

  <p>Then it suddenly occurred to me that Ebbstein probably had forgotten about
  the moulds, and that if he should realise the position he would come up and
  secure his safety by those "unconstitootional" methods that he had hinted at.
  The idea was most alarming. No sooner had it occurred to me than I resolved
  to make myself scarce at all costs.</p>

  <p>There was not much difficulty at the start. The window was fixed with
  screws, but there were tools with which to unscrew it; and outside was a
  parapet. I began by sticking the end of one jemmy in a crack in the floor and
  jamming the other end against the door; which was as effective as a bolt.
  Then I extracted the screws from the window with a turn-screw bit, softly
  slid up the bottom sash and looked out. Exactly opposite was the opening of a
  mews or stable yard, but it was unoccupied at the moment. The coast seemed
  quite clear, the house was not overlooked, and the parapet ran along the
  whole length of the street. Arming myself with a two-foot jemmy, I crawled
  out on to the broad gutter enclosed by the parapet, shut the window and
  hesitated for a moment, considering whether I should turn to the right or the
  left. Providence guided me to the left, and I began to crawl away along the
  gutter, keeping below the parapet as far as possible.</p>

  <p>As I passed the dormer window of the next house, curiosity led me to peep
  in; but at the first glance my caution fled, and I rose boldly to press my
  face against the glass. I looked into an unfurnished room tenanted by one
  person only; a handsome&mdash;nay a beautiful girl of about my own age. Her
  limbs were pinioned with thinnish rope, and she was further secured with the
  same rope to a heavy chair. A single glance told me that she was no East-End
  girl; she was obviously a young lady; and my premature knowledge of the seamy
  side of life enabled me to hazard a guess as to what she was doing here.</p>

  <p>She had already seen me and turned her deathly pale face to me in mute
  appeal. In a moment I had my big clasp-knife out, and, thrusting it up
  between the sashes, pushed back the catch; when I quietly pulled down the top
  sash and climbed over into the room. She looked at me with mingled hope and
  apprehension and exclaimed imploringly:</p>

  <p>"Oh! Take me away from this dreadful place&mdash;" but I cut her
  short.</p>

  <p>"Don't speak," I whispered; "they might hear you. I'm going to take you
  away."</p>

  <p>I was about to cut the rope when it occurred to me that it might be
  useful, as there seemed to be a considerable length of it. So I untied the
  knot and unwound the coils, recoiling the rope and throwing it round my neck.
  As the young lady rose stiffly and stretched herself, I silently carried the
  chair to the door, where I stuck its low back under the handle and jammed the
  back legs against the floor. No one could now get into the room without
  breaking the door off its hinges.</p>

  <p>"Can you follow me along the parapet, Miss?" I asked with some
  misgiving.</p>

  <p>"I will do anything you tell me," she answered, "if you will only take me
  away from this place."</p>

  <p>"Then," I said, "follow me, Miss, if you please," and climbing back out of
  the window, I reached in and took her hands to haul her up after me. She was
  an active, plucky girl, and I had her out on the gutter behind the parapet in
  a twinkling; and then, having softly shut the window, in case it should be
  noticed from outside, I crouched down in the gutter and motioned to her to do
  the same.</p>

  <p>In the gathering dusk, we began to crawl slowly away, I leading; but we
  had advanced only a few yards when I heard her utter a low cry, and at the
  same time felt her grasp the skirt of my jacket. Turning back, I saw her
  peering with an expression of terror through a hole in the parapet that
  opened into a rain-hopper, and, backing as best I could, I applied my eye to
  the hole, but failed to see anything more alarming than a woman on the
  opposite side of the street, who was looking at the houses on our side as if
  searching for a number. To be sure, she was not a pleasant-looking woman.
  Tall and gaunt, with dead black hair and a dead white face, and pale grey
  eyes that struck a discord with her hair, and were not quite a match in
  colour&mdash;for the left eye looked considerably darker than the
  right&mdash;she impressed me somehow as evil-looking and abnormal with a
  suggestion of disguise or make-up; a suggestion that was heightened by her
  dress. For she wore the uniform of a hospital nurse, and I found myself
  instinctively rejecting it as a masquerade.</p>

  <p>Still, unprepossessing as she was, I could see nothing terrifying in her
  aspect until my companion whispered in my ear: "She is coming to fetch me."
  Then I vaguely understood and shared her alarm. But the greater the danger,
  the greater the need to escape as quickly as possible. Accordingly, with a
  few whispered words of encouragement, I started forward again, crawling as
  fast as the confined space permitted. I looked up at the windows as we
  passed, but did not venture to peep in; but near the end of the row, I made
  out on one the words "To let," written with soap or whitewash, and on this, I
  raised my head and looked in. The appearance of the empty room with its open
  door confirmed the inscription, and I made bold, after a cautious look round,
  to slip back the catch with my knife, lower the top sash and enter. A very
  brief inspection showed that the house was really empty, so I returned, and
  quickly helping my protégée in through the window, slid up the sash.</p>

  <p>While we were exploring the empty house, the young lady told me her story.
  That very morning her governess had left her for a few minutes to call at an
  office, and while she was waiting in the Strand, the woman whom we had just
  seen had come to her to tell her that the governess had been run over and
  taken to the hospital. She was then hurried into a cab by the nurse and
  driven to the house in which I had found her.</p>

  <p>There was no time, however, for detailed explanations. We were by no means
  out of the wood yet. All the outside doors, front and back, were locked, and
  though I could have broken out with the jemmy, it was not a very safe plan on
  account of the noise that I should make. But there was another plan that
  looked more feasible. This particular house had no back yard, but gave
  directly on a narrow court; into which it would be fairly easy to drop from
  the first-floor window by the aid of the rope.</p>

  <p>No sooner had I conceived the idea than I proceeded to execute it. Raising
  the bottom sash of the back first-floor window, I passed the cord through the
  bars of the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"Shall I go first, Miss?" I asked. "The rope is rather short, and I had
  better be there to catch you if you have to drop."</p>

  <p>She agreed eagerly, and, after a careful look up and down the court, I
  took the doubled rope in my hand, climbed out of the window, and, slipping
  down easily until I was near the ends of the rope, let go and dropped on the
  pavement.</p>

  <p>Looking up, I saw the young lady, without a moment's delay, seize the rope
  and climb out of the window. But instead of grasping the two parts of the
  rope together, she had taken one in each hand, which made the descent much
  less easy; and as she apparently held one part more tightly than the other,
  the more loosely-held part began to slip up as the "bight" ran through the
  bars of the grate above. Finally, she let go with one hand, when the released
  end flew up and she came down "by the run" holding on to the other. I stepped
  forward as she dropped the last few feet and caught her without difficulty;
  and as I set her on her feet, the rope came down by its own weight and fell
  in a confused coil on top of us. Half unconsciously, I picked it up and flung
  it round my neck as I glanced about in search of the exit from the court.</p>

  <p>At this moment a man came, treading softly, round a bend of the narrow
  passage; a foreigner, evidently, and so like Ebbstein that, for a moment, I
  really thought it was that villain himself. He stopped short and looked at me
  with scowling inquisitiveness. Then, suddenly, he seemed to recognise the
  young lady, for he uttered a sort of snarl and stepped forward. At the sound
  she turned and saw the man; and the low, trembling cry that she gave, and the
  incredulous horror that froze upon her face, will be fresh and vivid in my
  memory though I should live for a century.</p>

  <p>"You shall come back with me now," the wretch exclaimed, and rushed at her
  with his foul hands spread out like talons. My gorge rose at the brute. The
  blood surged noisily in my ears and my teeth clenched tightly. The jemmy in
  my hand seemed to whirl aloft of itself. I was dimly aware of a strong
  muscular effort and a dull-sounding blow; of a limp fall and a motionless
  figure on the pavement. Perhaps the man was dead. I didn't know and I didn't
  particularly care. At any rate I did not stop to ascertain. Taking my
  companion by the hand, I drew her swiftly down the court, grasping the jemmy
  tightly and quite ready to use it again if need be.</p>

  <p>We were obviously in great danger. Even as David, when he went down into
  Ashdod, we walked in the midst of enemies. There were few people in the ill
  lighted street into which we emerged, but those few eyed us with sinister
  glances and whispered together ominously. We walked on quickly but without
  appearing to hurry, and presently turned into a street that was quite
  deserted save for a hansom cab that had drawn up outside a small public
  house. I stepped forward joyfully, remembering the golden bribe that I could,
  and would willingly, offer for a safe passage; but my companion suddenly
  seized my arm and dragged me into a deep doorway.</p>

  <p>"Don't let him see us!" she exclaimed breathlessly. "He is the man who
  brought me here, and he is one of them. I heard the nurse call him
  Louis."</p>

  <p>We pressed back into the doorway and I watched the man putting on the
  horse's nose-bag. He certainly was a villainous-looking rascal; pale,
  black-eyed, with crisp, curly, black hair; the very opposite of the English
  horsey type. When he had secured the nose-bag, he turned and entered the
  public house; and at the same moment I made up my mind. Advancing quickly, I
  deliberately took off the horse's nose-bag and threw it down.</p>

  <p>"Jump into the cab!" I said to my companion; flinging the coil of rope and
  the jemmy down on the foot-board; and she stepped in without a word. I led
  the horse forward a few paces clear of the house, and then I climbed quickly
  to the driver's seat and took the reins. My experience of driving was small,
  but I had driven our van once or twice under the carman's supervision, and
  knew how to handle the 'ribbons'. A gentle shake of them now started the
  horse at a walk and I had just plucked the whip out of its socket when there
  rose from the direction of the court a shout of alarm and a confused noise of
  many voices. I shook the whip, and the horse broke into a trot. The voices
  drew nearer, and, just as I turned the corner, a loud yell from behind us
  announced that the cabman had discovered his loss. I gave the horse a sharp
  cut and he broke into a canter.</p>

  <p>On we rattled through one after another of the short and narrow slum
  streets, turning the sharp corners on one wheel and shaving the treacherous
  posts; and always the roar of angry voices seemed to pursue us, gathering in
  volume and seeming to draw nearer. The cab swayed, men leaped aside with
  curses, women and children sprang from the kennels screaming, windows were
  flung up and people yelled at us from doorways. And still the roar from
  behind seemed to draw nearer; and still I sat with clenched teeth, grasping
  the reins convulsively and thinking only of the posts at the corners.</p>

  <p>Presently we entered a longer street and I whipped up the horse afresh. At
  the end of this street we came out into a broad road and I took a deep
  breath. Now I knew where I was: Commercial Road East. Ashdod was behind us
  with the gibbering crowd of our enemies. I lashed the horse into a gallop and
  rattled gaily along the broad road, westward. The police might stop me if
  they pleased; I cared not a fig for them. My lady was safe from those
  vampires, and that was all that mattered.</p>

  <p>As we approached Whitechapel High Street, I stopped and raised the trap to
  ask where I should drive my fare. The address she gave was 63, Dorchester
  Square; and having obtained this, I drove on once more. But I went more
  soberly now that the danger was over and avoided the main streams of traffic.
  Years of experience in the delivery of parcels had made me almost as familiar
  with London as a fully qualified cabman, and I threaded my way through quiet
  squares and by-streets with no difficulty beyond that of driving the cab
  straight and keeping clear of other traffic. In less than an hour I turned
  into Dorchester Square, and, slowing down to read the numbers, at length drew
  up before a large house.</p>

  <p>I climbed down quickly, and, snatching off my cap, helped my fare to
  alight. She stood by the cab, still holding my hand and looking earnestly
  into my face; and her eyes filled.</p>

  <p>"I want to thank you," she said with a little catch in her breath, "and I
  can't. But my mother will. I will send someone out to hold the horse in a
  minute."</p>

  <p>She ran up the steps and rang the bell. The great door opened. It was
  opened by a tall footman who seemed to be prematurely grey; in fact his hair
  was perfectly white, though he looked quite young. He stared at the young
  lady for a second or two as if stupefied; then he let off a most undignified
  yell. "Miss Stella's come back!"</p>

  <p>So her name was Stella. A pretty name and a fit one for a lovely young
  lady. But I liked not that footman. And the great house, with its unfamiliar
  pomp, cast a chill on me. I felt a sudden shyness, which may have been
  pride.</p>

  <p>Why should I see her mother? There was nothing more to do. "Miss Stella
  had come back," and there was an end of it.</p>

  <p>I led the horse a few yards farther on to a lamp-post and taking the
  reins, which had fallen down, I secured them to the post with what our packer
  calls a clove hitch. Thriftily, I gathered up the coil of rope from the
  footboard&mdash;the jemmy had jolted off&mdash;and then I walked away across
  the Square.</p>

  <p>I looked in at Sturt and Wopsalls, though the premises were shut. But the
  foreman, who lived there, told me that my truck had been brought home by the
  police; and when he had heard my story he advised me to leave all
  explanations to him; which I did. Of course I said nothing about the young
  lady.</p>

  <p>To my revered parent I was even more reticent. Experience had taught me to
  maintain a judicious silence about any pecuniary windfall until some
  periodical financial crisis called forth my savings. But he was singularly
  incurious about the details of my daily life. Even the coil of rope which I
  brought home on my arm, drew from him no comment or question. And as the
  frugal supper was on the table and we were both pretty sharp set,
  conversation tended for a while to be spasmodic, with the result that the
  story of my adventures remained untold.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; TREASURE TROVE</h2>

  <h3>(JASPER GRAY'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was not until I had retired to my room for the night and
  taken the unusual precaution of locking the door, that I ventured to turn out
  the secret pocket at the back of my waistcoat and inspect the almost
  unbelievable wealth that the day's adventures had yielded. Indeed, so
  incredible did my good fortune appear that nothing short of a minute and
  critical examination of each coin separately would convince me that the
  windfall was a glorious reality.</p>

  <p>But a reality it was; and as I laid out the shining coins on my
  dressing-table, my eyes travelled over them with something approaching awe.
  Five golden sovereigns! Wealth beyond my wildest dreams. As I recall the
  ecstasy with which I gazed at them I can understand the joys of the
  old-fashioned miser. The paper vouchers which pass as money in these later,
  degenerate days hold no such thrills.</p>

  <p>And what a fortunate inspiration that secret pocket had been! The sewing
  of it on had been but a mere boyish freak with no defined purpose; for
  nothing more valuable than an occasional stray silver coin had ever come into
  my possession. Yet, but for that invaluable pocket, the five sovereigns would
  have gone the way of the two half-crowns. And thus reflecting, I was reminded
  of the little object that I had picked up in the egg-chest and dipped my
  fingers into the recesses of the somewhat irregularly shaped pocket. The
  object, when I at last discovered it in a sunken corner, appeared to be a
  little oval glass plate, flat on one side and rounded on the other, and about
  half an inch in length. As it was coated with dirt, I carried it to the wash
  hand-basin, and, having tenderly bathed and wiped it, brought it back to the
  candle. And then I received another thrill; for, holding it up to the light,
  I found it to be of a beautiful deep, clear green colour, whereupon I
  instantly decided that it must be an emerald. But more than this: as I looked
  through it with the rounded side towards me, there appeared, as if in its
  very substance, but actually engraved on the flat side, a little castle, such
  as one uses in playing chess, and above it the tiny head of some animal which
  seemed to combine the characteristics of a donkey and a crocodile, while,
  underneath the castle, in the tiniest of lettering, were the words, "Strong
  in Defence." Evidently this emerald had dropped out of a seal or a signet
  ring.</p>

  <p>I knew all about seals, for Sturt and Wopsalls were accustomed to secure
  small parcels for the post in this way; and occasionally the packer had
  allowed me to perform this interesting operation, having instructed me in the
  proper method and how to prevent the wax from sticking to the seal. But the
  warehouse seal was a big, clumsy, brass affair, quite different from this
  delicate little engraved gem. Hence it is needless to say that I was all agog
  to make a trial of my new treasure; and, failing any more suitable material,
  I made a number of experimental impressions on samples of wax from the candle
  before returning the gem to its secret hiding-place. Then, having bestowed my
  golden windfall at the bottom of a drawer filled with miscellaneous
  clothing&mdash;mostly outgrown&mdash;I went to bed, gloating happily over my
  sudden accession of wealth.</p>

  <p>Throughout the following day&mdash;it was a Saturday, I remember&mdash;the
  consciousness of my new opulence never left me. I seemed to walk on air. For
  the first time in my life I was a capitalist. If I had chosen&mdash;only I
  was not such a mug&mdash;I could have gone quite extensively 'on the bust' or
  brought something really expensive. It was a delightful sensation, and it
  cost nothing so long as I kept my capital intact.</p>

  <p>But even more than my treasure of gold was the mysterious emerald a source
  of joy, to which the uncertainty as to its value contributed not a little. I
  had read somewhere that the emerald is the most precious of stones, even more
  precious than the diamond. And this was quite a good-sized stone. Why it
  might be worth a hundred pounds! I had heard of diamonds that were worth more
  than that. True, it was probably some other person's property, and the
  circumstances in which I had acquired it strongly suggested that it was
  stolen property. But what of that? I had not stolen it, and I was fully
  prepared to surrender it to the rightful owner if ever he should appear.
  Meanwhile it was mine to possess and enjoy, and I made the most of it,
  halting from time to time in unfrequented places to fish it out of its
  hiding-place and hold it up to the light, revelling in its gorgeous colour
  and the quaint little castle and the preposterous little donkey or crocodile
  or whatever he was, magnified by the lens-like convex back of the gem.</p>

  <p>Presently I became possessed by an overwhelming desire to see those mystic
  figures embodied in wax&mdash;real wax; sealing-wax. A survey of my pockets,
  revealing the presence of several pennies, and my arrival opposite a small
  stationer's shop in Chichester Rents, settled the matter. I went in and
  demanded a stick of sealing-wax. The presiding genius, a dry-looking elderly
  man, rummaged awhile among some shelves at the back of the shop, and at
  length produced a cardboard box which he laid on the counter and in which I
  perceived a number of sticks of black sealing-wax.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather have red," said I.</p>

  <p>"M'yes," said he, giving the box a sort of reproachful shake, "I seem to
  have run out of red for the moment. Won't black wax do?"</p>

  <p>I was about to say "No," when I observed a portion of a broken stick in
  the box, and my habitual thrift suggested the chance of a "deal."</p>

  <p>"How much for that broken piece?" I enquired.</p>

  <p>He looked at the fragment disparagingly, picked it out with much
  deliberation and laid it on the counter.</p>

  <p>"Make you a present of that," said he; and taking up the box, turned his
  back on me as if to avoid my grateful acknowledgments.</p>

  <p>I went forth gleefully from the shop with the little stump of funereal wax
  in my pocket and a growing urge to make a trial of it. But there are three
  factors to a sealing operation; the seal, the wax and the document or letter.
  The first two I had; and even as I was searching my pockets, and searching in
  vain, for some letter or envelope which might form a plausible subject for an
  experiment, Providence, or Fate, in a playful mood, supplied the deficiency.
  Just as I was about to cross Fleet Street, a spectacled gentleman, who looked
  like a lawyer's clerk and carried in his hand a large sheaf of letters,
  blundered hastily out of Middle Temple Lane and collided with another hustler
  who was proceeding in the opposite direction. The shock of the impact
  dislodged one of the letters from his hand, but, unaware of his loss, he
  hurried away eastward. I ran across the road and picked up the letter, but by
  the time I had secured it, he had disappeared into the crowd. However, there
  was no need to pursue him. The letter was stamped and obviously ready for
  posting. All I had to do was to walk down to the post office and drop it in
  the box.</p>

  <p>With this intention I had turned eastward and was threading my way among
  the crowd when, happening to glance at the letter in my hand, I noticed that
  the flap of the envelope was very insecurely stuck down. The letter, as I had
  already observed, was addressed to a Mr. Brodribb, at New Square, Lincoln's
  Inn. Now, if Mr. Brodribb lived in Lincoln's Inn, he was probably a lawyer,
  especially as the letter had come from the Temple; and if he was a lawyer,
  the letter possibly contained important and confidential matter. It was
  highly improper that such a letter should be insecurely fastened. The least
  that I could do was to close the envelope as securely as was possible. And
  since mere gum had been tried in the balance and found wanting, the obvious
  proceeding was to seal it and make it absolutely safe.</p>

  <p>No sooner had I conceived the idea than I set about its execution. Darting
  down Inner Temple Lane in search of a retired spot, I turned to the left
  beside the church, and, passing Oliver Goldsmith's grave, came to a monument
  provided with a shelf which would serve the purpose to perfection. Here, with
  no one to observe my proceedings (though, indeed, they were innocent enough
  and even meritorious) I laid the envelope, the box of matches, the wax and
  the seal. Very carefully and methodically I melted the wax until I was able
  to deposit a nearly circular patch on the flap of the envelope. Then, giving
  it a few moments for the excessive stickiness to subside, I laid the precious
  seal daintily in position and made steady pressure on it with my thumb.</p>

  <p>The result was perfect, even to the microscopic markings on the castle; so
  perfect that I was loath to part with my work. Again and again I gloated over
  the beauty of its jet-like polish and the clean-cut device as I walked slowly
  down Fleet Street until I reached the post office, where, reluctantly I
  dropped the letter into the yawning mouth of the box. However, if I must
  needs part with the finished work, I retained the means of repeating it
  indefinitely; nor, to do myself justice, did I neglect my opportunities.
  Every parcel to which I could get access went forth enriched as to its
  exterior with a supplementary impression on the parcel wax, and a couple of
  ponderous rolls of cartoon paper which I conveyed in the truck to Studios in
  Ebury Street and at Chelsea, arrived at their destinations adorned with one
  or two black seals in addition.</p>

  <p>It was late in the evening when I reached home&mdash;for Saturday was
  little different to me from other days excepting that it held the promise of
  Sunday. I was rather tired and uncommonly hungry. But, to a strong and
  healthy lad, mere fatigue is not unpleasant, especially with an immediate
  prospect of unrestricted rest; and my hunger was mitigated by the comfortable
  consciousness of a pound of streaky bacon in my pocket, the product of a
  trifling honorarium tendered by the Ebury Street artist. That bacon was
  dedicated to future breakfasts, but still at a pinch (and pinches were not
  infrequent in our household) it might be made to yield a highly acceptable
  supper.</p>

  <p>However, as I toiled up the noble staircase that mocked our poverty with
  its faded, old-world magnificence, my nose informed me that the bacon could
  be reserved for its legitimate function. A savoury aroma on the second-floor
  landing, waxed in intensity as I mounted the "third pair," offering
  suggestions that I hardly dared to entertain. But when I opened the door of
  our sitting-room, my doubts were dispelled and my wildest hopes received
  glorious confirmation.</p>

  <p>I recall very vividly the picture that greeted my eyes as I paused for a
  moment in the open doorway. Beside the fire, seated in the old Windsor
  arm-chair and clad in his shabby dressing-gown, behold Pontifex (my revered
  parent&mdash;Pontifex Maximus on occasions of ceremony, shortened to Ponty in
  familiar conversation) delicately adjusting something that reposed in a
  frying-pan and murmured softly, exhaling a delicious fragrance. I sniffed and
  listened in ecstasy. More grateful than the odours of myrrh and frankincense
  was that delightful aroma; sweeter to my ears that soft, sibilant murmur than
  songs of Araby. For they conveyed, without the clumsy intermediary of speech,
  the entrancing idea of scallops; and lest any faintest misgiving might
  linger, there in the fender was ranged a goodly row of twelve empty
  scallop-shells.</p>

  <p>As I entered, Pontifex looked up with a smile compounded of welcome,
  triumph and congratulation. We were strangely different in many respects, but
  on one point our souls were tuned in perfect unison. We both had a gluttonous
  passion for scallops. It could not often be indulged, for the bare
  necessaries of life consumed the whole of our joint financial resources. Our
  ordinary diet&mdash;largely consisting of Irish stew&mdash;was supplied under
  a slightly ambiguous contract by the lady on the second-floor. But she was an
  indifferent culinary artist, and we did not trust her with such rare
  delicacies as scallops, or even with bacon. These called for more subtle
  treatment, and besides, the very process of cooking them was a feast in
  itself.</p>

  <p>While Pontifex, with consummate artistry and an air of placid
  satisfaction, tended the scallops, I proceeded to cut the bread and butter in
  order that there might be no unnecessary delay. And as I thus busied myself,
  my mind became half-unconsciously occupied, in the intervals of conversation,
  with speculations on the train of circumstances that had produced this
  unlooked-for festivity. How came Pontifex to be able to buy these scallops?
  Only that morning funds had been so short that it had been doubtful whether
  they would run to butter. Could Ponty have received an unexpected payment? It
  might be so, but I doubted it. And as I weighed the probabilities&mdash;and
  found them wanting&mdash;a horrible suspicion began to steal into my
  mind.</p>

  <p>Concerning my golden windfall I had, for sound economic reasons, kept my
  own counsel. But the "snide" half-crown I thought might be allowed to
  transpire, so to speak, in the form of a booby-trap for poor old Ponty; to
  which end I had that very morning planted it on the corner of the
  mantelpiece, experience having informed me of my respected parent's habit of
  snapping up any unconsidered trifles in the way of specie. It was a foolish
  joke, but I had taken it for granted that as soon as Ponty had the coin in
  his hand, he would see that it was a counterfeit. I had made no allowance for
  the difference between his eyesight and mine or our respective experiences of
  "snide" money. And now it looked as if my joke had failed disastrously. For I
  now remembered having noticed when passing a fishmonger's shop on my way
  home, that scallops were marked two shillings and sixpence a dozen. Of
  course, it might be only a coincidence. But a sensible man looks askance at
  coincidences; and the suspicious fact remained that a half-crown had
  disappeared and two and sixpence worth of scallops had unaccountably made
  their appearance.</p>

  <p>However, I refrained from spoiling poor Ponty's enjoyment of the feast by
  raising the very awkward question and I even managed to dismiss it from my
  own mind. So we had a banquet that a Lord Mayor might have envied. The
  scallops were cooked to perfection and served tastefully in their native
  shells; and when those shells had become once more empty and I had brewed
  myself a pot of tea while Pontifex mixed an uncommonly stiff jorum of grog
  and lit a cigarette, we experienced that sense of luxury and well-being that
  comes only to those who have to count their coppers and whose rare banquets
  are seasoned by habitual hard living.</p>

  <p>But the question of the "snide" half-crown had to be disposed of, for if
  it had purchased those scallops, then the scallops had been virtually stolen;
  and if it had not, it must be lurking in Ponty's pocket, an element of
  potential danger. Thus, I reflected on the morrow as, in accordance with our
  Sunday morning routine, I shaved Pontifex, laid the table, fried the bacon
  and made the tea. Accordingly, as soon as we were seated at table, I opened
  fire with a leading question, which Pontifex received with a waggish air of
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"So that was your half-crown!" he exclaimed. "Now why did that very simple
  explanation not occur to me? I tried to remember how I came to put it there
  but my memory was a complete blank. Naturally, as I realise now."</p>

  <p>"So you annexed it and busted it on scallops."</p>

  <p>Pontifex smiled blandly. "Your inference," he remarked, "illustrates the
  curious fact that it is sometimes possible to reach a correct conclusion by
  means of perfectly incorrect reasoning. The connection which you assumed
  between the Treasure Trove and the scallops though false in logic was true in
  fact. But as to your use of the colloquialism, 'busted', I would point out
  that even as omelettes cannot be made without the breaking of eggs, so
  scallops at two shillings and sixpence a dozen cannot be eaten without the
  expenditure of half-crowns."</p>

  <p>"Precisely. That was how I established the connection."</p>

  <p>"Assumed, my son," he corrected. "You did not establish it. You will note
  that your middle term was not distributed."</p>

  <p>"If the scallops were the middle term," I rejoined, flippantly, "they were
  distributed all right. We had six each."</p>

  <p>"I mean," he said with a deprecating smile, "that you fell into the common
  confusion of the undistributed middle. You confused the generic half-crown
  with a particular half-crown."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no I didn't." I retorted. "I wasn't born yesterday. I know that the
  generic half-crown is made of silver. But this particular half-crown was made
  of pewter."</p>

  <p>Pontifex suddenly became serious. Laying down his knife and fork, he
  looked at me for several seconds in silent dismay. At length he exclaimed:
  "You don't mean, my son, that it was a base coin?"</p>

  <p>"That is just what I do mean. Rank duffer. Made out of a pewter pot.
  Chappie probably prigged the pewter pot to make it."</p>

  <p>Pontifex was too much overcome even to protest at my vulgarisms of speech.
  Still gazing at me in consternation, he exclaimed tragically: "But this is
  terrible, Jasper. I have actually committed a gross fraud on that most
  estimable fish monger! Unwittingly, it is true; but a fraud nevertheless."
  (It was characteristic of Pontifex that he refrained from any suggestion that
  my idiotic booby-trap was the cause of the disaster. No man was more sensible
  of his own faults or more oblivious of other people's).</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "you undoubtedly sold him a pup. Precious mug he must
  have been to let you. But I suppose, as it was Saturday night, he was pretty
  busy."</p>

  <p>"He was. The shop was crowded with buyers. But, my son, we shall have to
  make restitution: though, really, in the present circumstances
  of&mdash;ah&mdash;financial stringency&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He explored his various pockets, which appeared to be rich in truncated
  fragments of lead pencil, in addition to which they yielded a small bunch of
  keys, a pen knife with a broken blade, a sixpence and three half pence. These
  treasures he regarded disconsolately and returned them whence they came. Then
  he turned an enquiring and appealing eye on me. He knew, of course, that I
  had received my wages on the previous day but delicately refrained from
  explicit allusion to the fact. However, as the entire sum reposed untouched
  in my pocket, in the form of four half-crowns and the fishmonger had to be
  paid, I produced the necessary coin and pushed it across the table. Usually,
  I was a little chary of handing money to Pontifex, preferring to pay our
  debts myself. For Ponty's ideas on the subject of meum and tuum were a trifle
  obscure&mdash;or perhaps I should say communistic&mdash;where my property was
  concerned, and the establishments of the tobacconist and the spirit merchant
  exercised a fatal fascination. But he was scrupulous enough in regard to
  strangers and I had no misgivings as to my present contribution safely
  reaching its proper destination. Accordingly, when I had furnished him with
  the means wherewith to make restitution to the defrauded fishmonger, I
  considered the incident of the "snide" half-crown as closed.</p>

  <p>But it was not, as I discovered when I arrived home on Monday night. The
  fishmonger, it appeared, had communicated with the police, and the police
  were profoundly interested in the coin, which they recognised as one of a
  series which was being issued in considerable numbers by a coiner whom they
  had failed to locate or identify. In consequence, Pontifex had been requested
  to ascertain from me how the coin had come into my possession and to
  communicate the information to the fishmonger for transmission to the
  police.</p>

  <p>Now, in my mind, there was little doubt as to the source of that
  half-crown. It had come from the work shop or studio of the mysterious artist
  who had been referred to as 'Chonas'. But my experiences under the
  too-hospitable roof of Mr. Ebbstein had begotten an unwillingness to be
  involved in any affair connected with that establishment. I am not peculiarly
  secretive, but I have a habit of keeping my own counsel. 'Chonas's'
  proceedings were no concern of mine and I was not disposed to meddle with
  them. Wherefore, in reply to Ponty's not very eager enquiries, I stated
  simply and quite truthfully, that I had received the coin from a man who was
  a total stranger to me. This answer satisfied Pontifex, who was not acutely
  interested in the matter, and once more I assumed that I had finished with
  that disreputable coin. And once more I was mistaken.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; A MYSTERY AND A DISAPPEARANCE</h2>

  <h3>(DR. JERVIS'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE are some&mdash;and not a few, I fear&mdash;of the
  dwellers in, or frequenters of London to whom the inexhaustible charms of
  their environment are matters of no more concern than is the landscape which
  the rabbit surveys indifferently from the mouth of his burrow. For them the
  sermons in stones are preached in vain. Voices of the past, speaking their
  messages from many an ancient building or historic landmark, fall on deaf
  ears. London, to such as these, is but an assemblage of offices and shops,
  offering no more than a field for profitable activity.</p>

  <p>Very different from these unreflective fauna of the town was my friend
  Thorndyke. Inveterate town-sparrow as he was, every link with the
  many-coloured past, even though it were no more than an ancient street-name,
  was familiar and beloved, never to be passed without at least a glance of
  friendly recognition. Hence it was natural that when, on a certain Tuesday
  morning, we crossed Chancery Lane to enter Lincoln's Inn by the spacious
  archway of the ancient gate-house, he should pause to glance round the
  picturesque little square of Old Buildings and cast his eyes up to the
  weathered carving above the archway which still exhibits the arms of the
  builder and the escutcheons of the ancient family whose title gave the inn
  its name.</p>

  <p>We were just turning away, debating&mdash;not for the first time&mdash;the
  rather doubtful tradition that Ben Jonson had worked as a bricklayer on this
  gateway, when we became aware of a remarkably spruce-looking elderly
  gentleman who was approaching from the direction of New Square. He had
  already observed us, and, as he was obviously bearing down on us with intent,
  we stepped forward to meet him.</p>

  <p>"This meeting," said he, as we shook hands, "is what some people would
  describe as providential, if you know what that means. I don't. But the fact
  is that I was just coming to call on you. Now you had better walk back with
  me to my chambers&mdash;that is, if you are at liberty."</p>

  <p>"May I take it," said Thorndyke, "that there is some matter that you wish
  to discuss?"</p>

  <p>"You may, indeed. I have a poser for you; a mystery that I am going to
  present to you for solution. Oh, you needn't look like that. This is a
  genuine mystery. The real thing. I've never been able to stump you yet, but I
  think I'm going to do it now."</p>

  <p>"Then I think we are at liberty. What do you say, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"If there is a chance of my seeing my revered senior stumped, I am
  prepared to stay out all night. But I doubt if you will bring it off,
  Brodribb."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb shook his head. "I should like to think you are right,
  Jervis," said he, "for I am absolutely stumped, myself, and I want the matter
  cleared up. But it is a regular twister. I can give you the facts as we walk
  along. They are simple enough, as facts. It is the explanation of them that
  presents the difficulty.</p>

  <p>"I think you have heard me speak of my client, Sir Edward Hardcastle. I am
  the family solicitor. I acted for Sir Edward's father, Sir Julian, and my
  father acted for Sir Julian's father. So I know a good deal about the family.
  Now, yesterday morning I received a letter which was sealed on the outside
  with Sir Edward Hardcastle's seal. I opened the envelope and took out the
  letter, naturally assuming that it was from Sir Edward. Imagine my
  astonishment when I found that the letter was from Frank Middlewick, your
  neighbour in the Temple."</p>

  <p>"It certainly was rather odd," Thorndyke admitted.</p>

  <p>"Odd!" exclaimed Brodribb. "It was astounding. Here was Sir Edward's
  private seal&mdash;the impression of his signet ring&mdash;on the envelope of
  a man who, as far as I knew, was a perfect stranger to him. I was positively
  staggered. I could make no sense of it; and as it was obviously a matter that
  called aloud for explanation, I slipped the letter in my pocket and hopped
  off to the Temple without delay.</p>

  <p>"But my interview with Middlewick only made confusion worse confounded. To
  begin with, he didn't know Sir Edward Hardcastle even by name. Never heard of
  him. And he was perfectly certain that the seal wasn't put on in his office.
  He had written the letter himself&mdash;I had already observed that it was in
  his own handwriting&mdash;but the envelope was addressed and the letter put
  in it by his clerk, Dickson, after the copy had been taken and the entry made
  in the index. Dickson states that he put the letter in one of the ordinary
  envelopes from the rack and he is quite certain that, when he closed it and
  stuck the stamp on, there was no seal on it. Of course, there couldn't have
  been. Then he took the letter, with a number of others, and posted it with
  his own hand at the post office in Fleet Street."</p>

  <p>"Did he check the letters when he posted them?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"No, he didn't. He ought to have done so, of course. But it seems that he
  was in a deuce of a hurry, so he shot the whole lot of letters into the box
  at once. Careless, that was. A man has no business to be in such a hurry that
  he can't attend to what he is doing. However it doesn't matter, as it
  happens. The post-mark shows that the letter was actually posted there at the
  time stated. So there's no help in that direction."</p>

  <p>"And what about your own premises? Who took the letter in?"</p>

  <p>"I took it in myself. I was strolling round the square, having my morning
  pipe, when I saw the postman coming along towards my entry. So I waited and
  took my batch of letters from him, and looked them over as I strolled back to
  the house. This one with the seal on it was among the batch. That is the
  whole story. And now, what have you got to say about it?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed softly. "It is a quaint problem," said he. "We seem to
  be able to take it as certain that the letter was unsealed when it left
  Middlewick's office. Apparently it was unsealed when it was dropped into the
  post office letter-box. It was certainly sealed when the postman delivered
  it. That leaves us the interval between the posting and the delivery. The
  suggestion is that somebody affixed the seal to the letter in the course of
  transit through the post."</p>

  <p>"That seems quite incredible," said I. "The seal was the impression of a
  signet ring which couldn't possibly have been in the possession of any of the
  post office people, to say nothing of the general absurdity of the
  suggestion."</p>

  <p>"Mere absurdity or improbability," replied Thorndyke, "can hardly be
  considered as excluding any particular explanation. The appearance of this
  seal in these circumstances is grotesquely improbable. It appears to be an
  impossibility. Yet there is the devastating fact that it has happened. We can
  hardly expect a probable or even plausible explanation of so abnormal a fact;
  but among the various improbable explanations, one must be true. All that we
  can do is to search for the one that is the least improbable, and I agree
  with you, Jervis, that the post office is not the most likely place in which
  the sealing could have occurred. It seems to me that the only point at which
  we make anything resembling a contact with probability is the interval
  between Dickson's leaving the office and the posting of the letters."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow you," said Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"What I mean is that at that point there is an element of uncertainty.
  Dickson believes that he posted the letter, but, as he did not check the
  letters that he posted, it is just barely possible that this one may have in
  some way escaped from his custody."</p>

  <p>"But," objected Brodribb, "it was certainly posted at the place and time
  stated. The post-mark proves that."</p>

  <p>"True. But it might have been posted by another hand."</p>

  <p>"And how does that suggestion help us?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," Thorndyke admitted. "It merely allows us to suggest, in
  addition to the alternatives known to us&mdash;all of them wildly incredible
  and apparently impossible&mdash;a set of unknown circumstances in which the
  sealing might credibly have happened."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't seem very satisfactory," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"It is highly unsatisfactory," he replied, "since it is purely
  speculative. But you see my point. If we accept Dickson's statement we are
  presented with a choice of apparent impossibilities. Middlewick could not
  have sealed the letter; Dickson could not have sealed it; we agree that it
  appears impossible for the postal officials to have sealed it, and it is
  unimaginable that the postman sealed it. Yet it left Middlewick's hands
  unsealed and arrived in the postman's hands sealed. Thus the apparently
  impossible happened. On the other hand, if we assume that the letter passed
  out of Dickson's possession in some way without his knowledge, we are
  assuming something that is not inherently improbable. And if we further
  assume&mdash;as we must, since the letter was posted by somebody&mdash;that
  there was an interval during which it was in the possession of some unknown
  person, then we have something like a loop-hole of escape from our dilemma.
  For, since the assumed person is unknown to us, we cannot say that it was
  impossible, or even improbable, that he should have had the means of sealing
  the letter."</p>

  <p>I laughed derisively. "This is all very well, Thorndyke," said I, "but you
  are getting right off the plane of reality. Your unknown person is a mere
  fiction. To escape from the difficulty you invent an imaginary person who
  might have had possession of Sir Edward's ring and might have had some motive
  for sealing with it a letter which was not his and with which he had no
  concern. But there isn't a particle of evidence that such a person
  exists."</p>

  <p>"There is not," Thorndyke agreed. "But I remind my learned friend that
  this perfectly incredible thing has undoubtedly happened and that we are
  trying to imagine some circumstances in which it might conceivably have
  happened. Obviously, there must be some such circumstances."</p>

  <p>"But," I protested, "there is no use in merely inventing circumstances to
  fit the case."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite agree with you, Jervis," Brodribb interposed. "As Thorndyke
  points out, since the thing happened, it must have been possible. But it does
  not appear to be possible in the circumstances known to us. Therefore there
  must have been some other circumstances which are unknown to us. Now the
  suggestion that Dickson dropped the letter (which, I understand, is what
  Thorndyke means) is not at all improbable. We know that he was in a devil of
  a hurry and I know that he is as blind as a bat. If he dropped the letter,
  somebody certainly picked it up and put it in the post; and I agree that that
  is probably what really occurred. I should think so on grounds of general
  probability, but I have a further reason.</p>

  <p>"Just now I said that I had told you the whole story, but that was not
  strictly correct. There is a sequel. As soon as I left Middlewick, I sent off
  a reply-paid telegram to Sir Edward asking him if his signet ring was still
  in his possession and if he had sealed any strange letter with it. In reply I
  got a telegram from his butler saying that Sir Edward was away from home and
  adding that a letter would follow. That letter arrived this morning, and gave
  me some news that I don't like at all. It appears that last
  Tuesday&mdash;this day week&mdash;Sir Edward left home with the expressed
  intention of spending a couple of days in Town and returning on Thursday
  afternoon. But he did not return on that day. On Friday, Weeks, the butler,
  telegraphed to him at the club, where he usually stayed when in town, asking
  him when he would be coming home. As no reply to this telegram was received,
  Weeks telegraphed next day&mdash;Saturday&mdash;to the secretary of the club
  enquiring if Sir Edward was still there. The secretary's answer informed him
  that Sir Edward had stayed at the club on Tuesday night, had gone out after
  breakfast on Wednesday morning and had not returned since, but that his
  suit-case and toilet fittings were still in his bedroom.</p>

  <p>"This rather disturbed Weeks, for Sir Edward is a methodical man and
  regular in his habits. But he didn't like to make a fuss, so he decided to
  wait until Monday night, and then, if his master did not turn up, to
  communicate with me. As I have said, up to the time of his writing to me, Sir
  Edward had not returned, nor had he sent any message. So the position is that
  his whereabouts are unknown, and, seeing that he has left his kit at the
  club, the whole affair has a very unpleasant appearance."</p>

  <p>"It has," Thorndyke agreed, gravely, "and in the light of this
  disappearance the seal incident takes on a new significance."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I hastened to interpose, "and the assumed unknown person seems to
  rise at once to the plane of reality."</p>

  <p>"That is what I feel," said Brodribb. "Taken with the disappearance, the
  incident of the seal has an ominous look. And there is another detail, which
  I haven't mentioned, but which I find not a little disturbing. The seal on
  this letter is impressed in black wax. It may mean nothing, but it conveys to
  me a distinctly sinister suggestion. Sir Edward, like most of us, always used
  red wax."</p>

  <p>On this Thorndyke made no comment, but I could see that he was as much
  impressed as was our old friend and as I was, myself. Indeed, to me this
  funereal wax seemed to impart to the incident of the seal an entirely new
  character. From the region of the merely fantastic and whimsical, it passed
  to that of the tragic and portentous.</p>

  <p>"There is just one point," said Thorndyke, "on which I should like to be
  quite clear. It is, I suppose, beyond doubt that this is really Sir Edward's
  seal&mdash;the actual impression of his signet ring?"</p>

  <p>"You shall judge for yourself," replied Brodribb; and forthwith he started
  forward towards his entry (hitherto we had been pacing up and down the broad
  pavement of the square). He preceded us to his private office where, having
  shut the door, he unlocked and opened a large deed box on the lid of which
  was painted in white lettering: "Sir Edward Hardcastle, Bart". From this he
  took out an envelope, apparently enclosing a letter and bearing on its flap a
  small seal in red wax. This he laid on the table, and then, extracting from
  his pocket wallet another envelope, bearing a similar seal in black wax, laid
  it down beside the other. Thorndyke picked them up, and, holding them as near
  together as was possible, made a careful comparison. Then, through his pocket
  lens, he made a prolonged inspection, first of the red seal and then of the
  black. Finally, producing a small calliper gauge which he usually carried in
  his pocket, he measured the two diameters of each of the little oval spaces
  in which the device was enclosed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, handing the envelopes to me, "there is no doubt that they
  are impressions of the same seal. The possible fallacy is not worth
  considering."</p>

  <p>"What fallacy do you mean?" asked Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"I mean," he replied, "that if you would leave one of these impressions
  with me for twenty-four hours I could present you with an indistinguishable
  facsimile. It is quite easy to do. But, in the present case, the question of
  forgery doesn't seem to arise."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Brodribb, "I don't think it does. But the question that does
  arise, is, what is to be done? I suppose we ought to communicate with the
  police at once."</p>

  <p>"I think," said Thorndyke, "that the first thing to be done is to call at
  the club and find out all that we can about Sir Edward's movements. Then,
  when we know all that is to be known, we can, if it still seems desirable,
  put the police in possession of the facts."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Brodribb agreed, eagerly, "that will be much the better plan. We
  may be able to do without the police and avoid a public fuss. Can you come
  along now? It's an urgent case."</p>

  <p>"It is," Thorndyke agreed. "Yes, we must let our other business wait for
  the moment. We had no actual appointment."</p>

  <p>Thereupon, Brodribb drew the letters out of the envelopes, and having
  deposited the former in the deed box, which he closed and locked, bestowed
  the latter in his wallet.</p>

  <p>"May want the seals to show to the police," he explained as he slipped the
  wallet into his pocket. "Now let us be off."</p>

  <p>We made our way out of the square by the Carey Street gate and headed for
  the Strand by way of Bell Yard. At the stand by St. Clement's Church we
  picked up an unoccupied 'Growler', and, when we had jammed ourselves into its
  interior, Brodribb communicated the destination to the cabman, who looked in
  on us as he closed the door. "Clarendon Club, Piccadilly."</p>

  <p>The cabman thereupon climbed to his box and gave the reins a shake, and
  our conveyance started forward on its career towards the west.</p>

  <p>"I take it," said Thorndyke, "that Sir Edward wears this ring on his
  finger?"</p>

  <p>"Not as a rule," Brodribb replied. "It is an old ring&mdash;an heirloom,
  in fact&mdash;and it is rather a loose fit and apt to drop off. For that
  reason, and because he sets a good deal of value on it, Sir Edward usually
  carries it in his waistcoat pocket in a little wash-leather case."</p>

  <p>"And what is the ring like? Is it of any considerable intrinsic value?</p>

  <p>"As to its intrinsic value," replied Brodribb, "I can't tell you much, as
  I have not been told and don't know much about jewels. But I can tell you
  what it is like, and perhaps you can judge of its value from the description.
  The stone, I understand, is a green tourmaline of an unusually fine colour,
  flat on the front, which, of course bears the engraved device, and convex at
  the back. The ring itself is rather massive and ornamented with a certain
  amount of chased work, but the general effect is rather plain and simple.
  What should you say as to its value?"</p>

  <p>"Principally artistic and sentimental," Thorndyke replied. "A tourmaline
  is a very beautiful stone, especially if it is cut so as to display the
  double colouring&mdash;which, apparently, this one was not; but it is not one
  of the very precious stones. On the other hand, a green tourmaline might
  easily be mistaken by a person who had no special knowledge for an emerald,
  which is, in certain cases, the most precious of all stones."</p>

  <p>"In any case," said I, "it would be worth stealing, and certainly worth
  picking up if it happened to be dropped."</p>

  <p>The discussion was interrupted by the stopping of the cab opposite the
  club. We all alighted, and, as Thorndyke was paying the cabman, I followed
  Brodribb up the steps to the hall, where our friend presented his card to the
  porter and asked to see the secretary. Almost immediately, the messenger
  returned and ushered us to the private office where we found a small,
  grave-looking gentleman standing beside his desk to receive us.</p>

  <p>"I am extremely relieved to see you, Mr. Brodribb," the secretary said
  when the necessary introductions had been made and the purpose of our visit
  stated. "I had the feeling that I ought to communicate with the police, but
  you understand the difficulty. The club members wouldn't like a public fuss
  or scandal; and then there is Sir Edward, himself. He would be annoyed if he
  should return to find himself the subject of a newspaper sensation. But now,"
  he smiled deprecatingly, "I can transfer the burden of responsibility to your
  shoulders. Is there any information that I can give you?"</p>

  <p>"If you have any," replied Brodribb. "I have seen your letter to Weeks,
  Sir Edward's butler."</p>

  <p>"Then I think you know all that I have to tell. But perhaps there is
  something more that&mdash;" he broke off undecidedly and looked from Brodribb
  to Thorndyke with an air of vague enquiry.</p>

  <p>"Could we have a look at the bedroom that Sir Edward occupied?" Thorndyke
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," was the ready, almost eager response. "I will go and get the
  key."</p>

  <p>He hurried away, evidently all agog to pass on his embarrassments to
  Brodribb and be clear of them. When he returned with the key in his hand, he
  invited us to follow him and preceded us along a corridor and up a back
  stairway, to another corridor at a door in which he halted to insert and turn
  the key. As the door swung open, he stood aside to let us pass, and, when we
  had entered, he followed and closed the door after him.</p>

  <p>For a minute or more we all stood silently glancing around and taking in
  the general aspect of the room; and I could see that the distinctly
  uncomfortable impression that the appearance of the room produced on me was
  shared by my companions. Not that there was anything unusual or abnormal in
  its aspect. On the contrary, the room had precisely the appearance that one
  would expect to find in the bedroom of a gentleman who was in residence at
  his club. And that was, in the circumstances, the disquieting fact. For thus
  had the room been lying in a state of suspended animation, as one might say,
  for close upon a week; a fact which every object in it seemed to stress. The
  neatly-made bed with the folded pyjamas on the pillow, the brushes, nail
  scissors and other little toilet implements on the dressing-table, the
  tooth-brush, nail-brush and sponge on the wash-stand; all offered the same
  sinister suggestion.</p>

  <p>"I take it," said Thorndyke, voicing my own conclusion, "that Sir Edward
  wears a beard?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Brodribb replied.</p>

  <p>"Then, since he had no razors, and all his travelling necessaries appear
  to be here, we may assume that he took nothing with him."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that seems to be the case," Brodribb agreed, gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Which implies," Thorndyke continued, "that, when he went away, he had the
  intention of returning here to sleep."</p>

  <p>The implication was so obvious that Brodribb acknowledged it only with a
  nod and an inarticulate grunt. Then turning to the secretary, he asked: "Did
  he leave anything in your custody, Mr. Northbrook?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," was the reply. "Whatever he had with him and did not take away
  is in this room."</p>

  <p>On this, Thorndyke stepped over to the dressing-chest and pulled out the
  drawers, one after another. Finding them all empty, he transferred his
  attention to a suit-case that rested on a trunk-stand. It proved to be
  locked, but the lock was an artless affair which soon yielded to a small key
  from Mr. Brodribb's voluminous bunch.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much there," the latter commented as he held up the lid and
  glanced disparagingly at a few collars and a couple of shirts which seemed to
  form the sole contents of the case. He was about to lower the lid when
  Thorndyke, with characteristic thoroughness, took out the collars and lifted
  the shirts. The result drew from our friend an exclamation of surprise; for
  the removal of the shirts brought into view some objects that had
  been&mdash;perhaps intentionally&mdash;concealed by them; a large and
  handsome gold watch and guard, a bunch of keys, a tie-pin, set with a single
  large pearl and one or two opened letters addressed to the missing man. The
  latter, Brodribb scanned eagerly and then replaced with an air of
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Family letters," he explained. "Nothing in them that is of any use to us.
  But," he added, looking anxiously at Thorndyke, "this is a most extraordinary
  affair. Most alarming, too. It looks as if he had deliberately removed from
  his person everything of intrinsic value."</p>

  <p>"Excepting the ring," Thorndyke interposed.</p>

  <p>"True, excepting the ring. He may have forgotten that, unless he had
  intended to use it&mdash;to seal some document, for instance. But otherwise
  he seems to have jettisoned everything of value. I need not ask you what that
  suggests."</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke replied, answering Brodribb's interrogative glance rather
  than his words. "Taking appearances at their face value one would infer that
  he was intending to go to some place where personal property is not very
  secure. That is the obvious suggestion, but there are other
  possibilities."</p>

  <p>"So there may be," said Brodribb, "but I shall adopt the obvious
  suggestion until I see reason to change my mind. Sir Edward went from here to
  some place where, as you say, personal chattels are not very safe. And where
  a man's property is not safe his life is usually not safe either. What we
  have seen here, coupled with his disappearance, fills me with alarm, indeed
  with despair; for I fear that the danger, whatever it was, has already taken
  effect. This is the seventh day since he left here."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded gloomily. "I am afraid, Brodribb," he said, "that I can
  only agree with you. Still, whatever we may think or feel, there is only one
  thing to be done. We must go at once to Scotland Yard and put the authorities
  there in possession of all the facts that are known to us. This is
  essentially a police case. It involves the simultaneous search of a number of
  likely localities by men who know those localities and their inhabitants by
  heart."</p>

  <p>Brodribb assented immediately to Thorndyke's suggestion, and when he had
  taken possession of the derelict valuables and given Mr. Northbrook a receipt
  for them, we shook hands with that gentleman and took our leave.</p>

  <p>At Scotland Yard we had the rather unexpected good fortune to learn that
  our old friend, Superintendent Miller, was in the building, and, after a
  brief parley, we were conducted to his office. On our entrance, he greeted us
  collectively and motioned to the messenger to place chairs for us; then,
  regarding Thorndyke with a quizzical smile, he enquired: "Is this a
  deputation?"</p>

  <p>"In a way," replied Thorndyke, "it is. My friend, here, Mr. Brodribb, whom
  you have met on some previous occasions, has come to ask for your assistance
  in regard to a client of his who is missing."</p>

  <p>"Anyone I know?" enquired Miller.</p>

  <p>"Sir Edward Hardcastle of Bradstow in Kent," Brodribb replied.</p>

  <p>The Superintendent shook his head. "I don't think I have ever heard the
  name," said he. "However, we will see what can be done, if you will give us
  the necessary particulars."</p>

  <p>He laid a sheet of paper on the desk before him, and, taking up his
  fountain pen, looked interrogatively at Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"I think," said the latter, "you had better hear the whole story first and
  then take down the particulars. Or I could supply you with a full account in
  writing, which would save time just now."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Miller agreed, "that would be the best plan," but nevertheless he
  held his pen in readiness and jotted down a note from time to time as
  Brodribb proceeded with his narrative. But he made no comments and asked no
  questions until that narrative was concluded, listening with the closest
  attention and obviously with the keenest professional interest.</p>

  <p>"Well," he exclaimed, as Brodribb concluded, "that is a queer story, and
  the queerest part of it is that sealed letter. I can make nothing of that. It
  may be some odd chance or it may be a practical joke. But there is an
  unpleasant air of purpose about it. We can hardly believe that Sir Edward
  sealed the letter; and if he didn't, his ring was in someone else's
  possession. If it was, it may have been lost and picked up or it may have
  been stolen. There's an alarming lot of 'ifs' in this case. Do you know
  anything about Sir Edward's habits?"</p>

  <p>"Not a great deal," replied Brodribb. "He is a quiet, studious man, rather
  solitary and reserved."</p>

  <p>"Not in the habit of attending race meetings?"</p>

  <p>"I should say not."</p>

  <p>"Nor addicted to slumming?"</p>

  <p>"No. I believe he spends most of his time at his place in Kent, and, apart
  from books, I think his principal interest is gardening."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Miller. "Well, that leaves us pretty much in the dark. If a man
  was proposing to attend a race meeting, he might naturally leave his more
  valuable portable property at home; and the same if he was bound on some
  expedition into the slums, or if he expected to be in some sort of rough
  crowd. At any rate, the fact remains that he did turn out his pockets before
  starting from the club, so we can take it that he had in view the possibility
  of his getting into some shady company. We shall have to find out a bit more
  about his habits. What is this butler man, Weeks, like?"</p>

  <p>"A most intelligent, conscientious, responsible man. He could probably
  tell you more about Sir Edward's habits than anyone. Would you like him to
  come and see you?"</p>

  <p>"We've got to see him," Miller replied, "to fill in details, but I think
  it would be better for one of our men&mdash;unless I can manage it
  myself&mdash;to go down and see him at the house. You see, we shall want a
  full description of the missing man and at least one photograph, if we can
  get it. And we may want to go over his clothes and hats for private marks and
  Bertillon measurements."</p>

  <p>"For Bertillon measurements!" exclaimed Brodribb. "But I thought you
  required the most minute accuracy for them."</p>

  <p>"So you do if you can get it," replied Miller. "But, you see, the system
  depends on what we may call multiple agreements, like circumstantial
  evidence. It isn't a question of one or two accurate measurements but of the
  coincidence of a large number with no disagreements. If we should find an
  unrecognisable body with legs and forearms, thighs and upper arms about the
  same length as Sir Edward's; and if the chest and waist measurements were
  about the same as his and if the head would fit his hats, the hands would fit
  his gloves and the feet would fit his boots, and if there was no disagreement
  in any one measurement, then we should have established a very strong
  probability that the body was his body. It is surprising how much information
  an experienced man can get from clothes. Of course, I am speaking of clothes
  that have been worn and that have creases that mark the position of the
  joints. But even new clothes will tell you quite a lot."</p>

  <p>"Will they really?" said Brodribb, in a slightly shocked tone&mdash;for,
  despite his expressed pessimism, he was hardly prepared to consider his
  client in the character of a body. "I can understand their use for comparison
  with those on the&mdash;er&mdash;person, but I should not have expected them
  to furnish measurements of scientific value. However, I think you have
  Weeks's address?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I will just jot down one or two particulars&mdash;dates, for
  instance."</p>

  <p>He did so; and when he had finished, as our business seemed to be
  concluded, we thanked him for his interest in the case and rose to depart. As
  we moved towards the door, Brodribb turned to make a last enquiry.</p>

  <p>"Would it be admissible to ask if you think there is a reasonable chance
  of your being able to trace my missing client?"</p>

  <p>Miller reflected awhile, assisting the process of cogitation by gently
  scratching the back of his head. "Well, Mr. Brodribb," he replied, at length,
  "I'm like the doctor, I'm not fond of guessing. The position is that this
  gentleman is either alive or dead. If he is dead, his body must be lying
  somewhere and it is pretty certain to come to light before very long. If he
  is alive, the matter is not so simple, for he must be keeping out of sight
  intentionally; and as he is not known to any of our people, he might be
  straying about a long time before he was recognised and reported. But I can
  promise you that everything that is possible shall be done. When we have got
  a good photograph and a description, they will be circulated among the police
  in all likely districts and instructions issued for a sharp look-out to be
  kept. That is about all that we can do. I suppose you would not care for us
  to publish the photograph and description?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it would be advisable," Brodribb replied. "If he should,
  after all, return to his club, it would be so extremely unpleasant for
  him&mdash;and for me. Later, it may be necessary, but for the present, the
  less fuss that we make, the better."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent was disposed to agree with this view; and when Brodribb
  had once more promised to send full written particulars with a special
  impression of the missing seal, we finally took our departure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; MR. BRODRIBB'S PERPLEXITIES</h2>

  <h3>(DR. JERVIS'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">DURING the next few weeks we saw a good deal of Mr.
  Brodribb; indeed, his visits to our chambers became so frequent, and he
  became so acutely conscious of their frequency, that he was reduced to the
  most abject apologies for thus constantly intruding on our privacy. But we
  always received him with the warmest of welcomes, not only for the sake of
  our long-standing friendship but because we both realised that the
  warm-hearted old lawyer was passing through a period of heavy tribulation.
  For Mr. Brodribb took his responsibilities as a family solicitor very
  seriously. To him, the clients whose affairs he managed were as his own
  family, their welfare and their interests took precedence over every other
  consideration and their property was as precious and sacred as if it had been
  his own.</p>

  <p>Hence, as the time ran on and no tidings of the missing man came to hand,
  the usually jovial old fellow grew more and more worried and depressed. It
  was not only the suspense of waiting for news that kept his nerves on edge,
  but the foreboding that when the tidings should at last come they would be
  tidings of tragedy and horror. Nor even was this all; for, presently, it
  began to transpire that there were further causes of anxiety.</p>

  <p>From chance phrases of rather ambiguous import we inferred that the
  baronet's disappearance bade fair to create a situation of some difficulty
  from the legal point of view; but as to the nature of the difficulties we
  were unable to judge until a certain evening when Brodribb at last unburdened
  himself of his anxieties and entered into explicit particulars. I do not
  think that he started with the intention of going into details, but the
  matter arose naturally in the course of conversation.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he began, "we could hardly expect to keep this horrible
  affair to ourselves, but I had rather hoped that we might have avoided
  scandal and gossip, at least until something of legitimate public interest
  occurred."</p>

  <p>"And haven't we?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No. There has been a leakage of information somewhere. Police, I suspect,
  unless it was someone at the club. It would hardly be Northwood, though, for
  he was more anxious than any of us to keep the affair dark. Anyhow, a notice
  of the disappearance has got into at least one newspaper."</p>

  <p>"Which newspaper was it?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is what I have been unable to ascertain. The way in which I
  became aware of it was this: a man&mdash;a relative of Sir Edward's and an
  interested party&mdash;called on me a day or two ago to make enquiries. He
  said that he had heard a rumour that Sir Edward was missing and wished to
  know if there was any truth in it. I asked him where he heard the rumour and
  he said that he had seen some obscure reference to the matter in one of the
  evening papers, but he couldn't remember which paper it was. I pressed him to
  try to remember for it struck me as most remarkable that he should have
  forgotten the name of the paper, he being, as I have said, an interested
  party. I should have expected him to preserve the paper or at least have cut
  out the paragraph. But he persisted that he had no idea whatever as to what
  paper it was."</p>

  <p>"It was, as you say, rather odd," commented Thorndyke. "If it isn't an
  indiscreet question, in what respect and to what extent was he an interested
  party?"</p>

  <p>"In a very vital respect," replied Brodribb. "He thinks that he is the
  heir presumptive."</p>

  <p>"And do I understand that you think otherwise?"</p>

  <p>"No. I am afraid I am disposed to agree with him. But I am not going to
  commit myself. Meanwhile he shows signs of being damned troublesome. He is
  not going to let the grass grow under his feet. He began to throw out hints
  of an application to the court for leave to presume death; which is
  preposterous at this stage."</p>

  <p>"Quite," Thorndyke agreed. "But, of course, if Sir Edward doesn't
  presently turn up, alive or dead, that is what you will have to do; and
  having regard to the circumstances, the Court would probably be prepared to
  consider the application after a comparatively short period."</p>

  <p>"So it might," Brodribb retorted, doggedly. "But he will have to make the
  application himself; and if he does, I shall contest it."</p>

  <p>Here he suddenly shut himself up, dipping his fine old nose reflectively
  into his wineglass and fixing a thoughtful eye on the empty fireplace. But
  somehow, his abrupt silence conveyed to me in some subtle manner the
  impression that he would not be unwilling to be questioned further. Nor was I
  mistaken; for, after a pause, during which neither Thorndyke nor I had made
  any comment, he broke the silence with the remark: "But I've no business to
  come here boring you two fellows with a lot of shop talk&mdash;and my own
  private shop at that."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said Thorndyke. "Are we then of no account? I rather thought
  that we were to some extent concerned in the case and that, to that extent,
  we might regard your shop as our shop."</p>

  <p>"He knows that perfectly well, old humbug that he is," said I. "And he
  knows that nothing but our superlative good manners has restrained us from
  demanding full particulars."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb smiled genially and emptied his glass.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said he, "if you are so polite as to express an actual
  interest in the civil aspects of the case I shall take you at your word. It
  will be very helpful to me to talk matters over with you, though I really
  hardly know where to begin."</p>

  <p>"You might begin," said Thorndyke, "by filling your glass. The decanter is
  on your side. Then you might tell us what your objections are to this
  claimant, whom you admit to be the heir presumptive."</p>

  <p>"I don't admit anything of the kind," protested Brodribb as he filled his
  glass and pushed the decanter across the table. "I merely agree that his
  claim appears, at the moment to be quite a good and well-founded one."</p>

  <p>"I don't see much difference," said I, "between an heir presumptive and a
  claimant with a well-founded claim. But never mind. You object to the
  gentleman for some reason. Tell us why you object to him."</p>

  <p>Brodribb considered the question for a while. At length he replied:</p>

  <p>"I think, if you are really interested in the state of affairs, it would
  be best for me to give you a short sketch of the family history and the
  relationships. Then you will understand my position and my point of view. I
  need not go back in detail beyond Sir Edward's father, Sir Julian
  Hardcastle.</p>

  <p>"Sir Julian had two sons, Edward and Gervase. As the estate is settled in
  tail male, we can ignore the female members of the family. On Sir Julian's
  death, Edward, the elder, succeeded; and as he was already married and had
  one son, the succession was, for the time being, satisfactorily settled. The
  younger son, Gervase, married his cousin, Phillipa, a daughter of Sir
  Julian's brother William. There was a good deal of opposition to the
  marriage, but the young people were devoted to one another and in the end
  they made a run-away match of it."</p>

  <p>"Was the opposition due to the near kinship of the parties?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Partly, no doubt. There is a very general prejudice against the marriage
  of first cousins. But the principal objection of the young lady's people was
  to Gervase, himself. It seems&mdash;for I never saw her&mdash;that Miss
  Phillipa was an extremely beautiful and attractive girl who might have been
  expected to make a brilliant marriage, whereas Gervase was a younger son with
  very little in the way of expectations. However, that might have passed. The
  real trouble was that Gervase had acquired some bad habits when he was up at
  Oxford and he hadn't shaken them off. Plenty of young fellows tend to overdo
  the libations to Bacchus during their undergraduate days. But it is usually
  mere youthful expansiveness which passes off safely when they come down from
  the 'Varsity and take up their adult responsibilities. Unfortunately, it was
  not so with Gervase. Conviviality passed into chronic intemperance. He became
  a confirmed drinker, though not an actual drunkard.</p>

  <p>"I may as well finish with him, so far as his history is known to me, as
  that history complicates the present position. I may have given the
  impression that he was a waster, but he was not, by any means. He was a queer
  fellow in many respects, but, apart from his tippling habits, there was
  nothing against him. And he must have had considerable abilities, for I
  understand that he not only graduated with distinction but was reputed the
  most brilliant classical scholar of his year. In fact he became a Fellow of
  his college and after his marriage I believe he took Orders, though he
  remained at Oxford in some teaching capacity. I don't know much of his
  affairs at this time. It wasn't my business, and Sir Edward did not talk much
  about him; but so far as I can gather, his career at the University came to a
  sudden and disastrous end. Something happened, I don't know what it was but I
  suspect that he got drunk under circumstances that created a public scandal.
  At any rate he was deprived of his Fellowship and had to leave Oxford; and
  from that time, with a single exception, all trace of him is lost&mdash;at
  least to me. But he must have felt his disgrace acutely for it is clear that
  he cut himself off entirely from his family and went virtually into hiding on
  the continent."</p>

  <p>"What about his wife?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"She certainly went with him into exile, and though she never communicated
  with her family at this time, I think there is no doubt that, in spite of all
  his faults, she remained devoted to him. That appears plainly in connection
  with the single reappearance which I mentioned, of which I heard indirectly
  from Sir Edward. It seems that a friend of the family who had known Gervase
  at Oxford, came across him by chance in Paris; and from his account of the
  meeting it would seem that the poor fellow was in a very sad way. His
  appearance suggested abject poverty and his manner was that of a man who had
  received some severe shock. He had a bewildered air and seemed to be only
  partially conscious of what was going on around him. He gave no account of
  himself in any respect save one; which was that he had lost his wife some
  time previously, but he did not say when or where she died. He did not seem
  to have any distinct ideas as to place or time. The fact of his loss appeared
  to occupy his thoughts to the exclusion of everything else. In short, he was
  the mere wreck of a man.</p>

  <p>"The friend&mdash;whose name I forget, if I ever knew it&mdash;had some
  idea of helping him and trying to get him into touch with his family; but
  before he could make any move, Gervase had disappeared. As he had given no
  hint as to his place of abode, no search for him was possible; and so this
  unfortunate man passes out of our ken. The only further news we got of him
  was contained in a notice in the obituary column of The Times some twelve
  months later which recorded his death at Brighton. No address was given, and,
  I am sorry to say, neither Sir Edward nor I made any enquiries at the time. I
  cut the notice out and put it with the papers relating to the estate, and
  there, for the time being the matter ended."</p>

  <p>"There was no doubt that the notice really referred to him?" Thorndyke
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No. He was described as 'The Reverend Gervase Hardcastle, M.A. (so
  apparently he had taken orders), formerly Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford,'
  and his age was correctly given. No, I think there can be no doubt that the
  notice referred to him. Of course, I ought to have looked into the matter and
  got all the particulars; but at the time Sir Edward's son and wife were both
  alive and well, so it looked as if there were no chance of any question
  arising with regard to the succession."</p>

  <p>"It is not known, I suppose," said Thorndyke, "whether Gervase had any
  children?"</p>

  <p>"No. There were no children up to the time when he left England. But it is
  possible that some may have been born abroad. But if so, since we have no
  knowledge whatever as to where he lived during his wanderings and don't even
  know in what country his wife died, we have no date on which to base any
  enquiries. As a matter of fact, both Sir Edward and I assumed that, at least,
  there was no son, for if there had been, we should almost certainly have
  received some communication from him after Gervase's death. That was what we
  assumed, but of course we ought not to have left it at that. But now we had
  better pursue the course of events.</p>

  <p>"Gervase's death, as recorded in The Times, occurred sixteen years ago.
  Six years later, Sir Edward lost both his wife and his son&mdash;his only
  child&mdash;within a few days. A malignant form of influenza swept through
  the house and brought Sir Edward, himself, to the very verge of the grave.
  When he at length rose from his bed, it was to find himself a childless
  widower. This altered the position radically, and, of course, we ought to
  have made such enquiries as would have cleared up the question of the
  succession. But Sir Edward was, for the time, so broken by his bereavements
  that I hardly liked to trouble him about a matter which had ceased to be his
  personal concern, and on the few occasions when I raised the question, I
  found him quite uninterested. His view was that there was nothing to discuss;
  and assuming, as he did, that Gervase had died without issue (in which
  assumption I concurred) he was right. In that case, the heir presumptive was
  undoubtedly his cousin Paul, Phillipa's brother; and as Paul Hardcastle was
  an entirely eligible successor, Sir Edward made a fresh will bequeathing to
  him the bulk of his personal property.</p>

  <p>"That was the position ten years ago. But four years ago Paul Hardcastle
  died, leaving only one child, a daughter some twelve years of age. Once more
  the position was altered; for, now, Sir Edward's near kin were exhausted and
  the new heir presumptive was a comparatively distant cousin&mdash;a grandson
  of Sir Julian's uncle, one David Hardcastle. On this, Sir Edward revoked his
  will and made another, by which about three quarters of his personal property
  goes to Paul Hardcastle's daughter, in trust until she shall reach the age of
  twenty-one and thereupon absolutely. The remaining fourth, apart from certain
  legacies, goes to the heir of the estate, that is to David Hardcastle."</p>

  <p>"And supposing the young lady should die during her minority?" Thorndyke
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"Then the property goes to the heir to the title and estate."</p>

  <p>"Does the personal property amount to anything considerable?</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is very considerable indeed. Sir Edward came into a comfortable
  sum when he succeeded, and his wife was a lady of some means; and he has been
  an excellent manager&mdash;almost unduly thrifty&mdash;so there have been
  substantial accumulations during his time. Roughly, the personalty will be
  not less than a hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"That," I remarked, "leaves some twenty-five thousand for the heir to the
  title. He won't have much to complain of."</p>

  <p>"No," growled Brodribb, "but I expect he will complain, all the same. In
  fact, he has complained already. He thinks that the whole of the money should
  have gone to the heir to enable him to support his position in suitable
  style."</p>

  <p>"So," said I, "we may take it that the gentleman who called on you was Mr.
  David Hardcastle?"</p>

  <p>"You may," replied Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"And we may further take it that the said David is not exactly the apple
  of your eye."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you may. It is all wrong, I know, for me to allow my likes
  and dislikes to enter into the matter. But I have acted for Sir Edward and
  for Sir Julian before him, and my father acted for Sir Julian and his father,
  Sir Henry, so that it is only natural that I should have a deep personal
  sentiment in regard to the family and the estate."</p>

  <p>"Which," said I, "brings us back to the original question; What is the
  matter with David Hardcastle?"</p>

  <p>Brodribb pondered the question, consciously controlling, as I suspect, his
  naturally peppery temper. But with no great success, for he, at length, burst
  out: "I can't trust myself to say what I feel about him. Everything is the
  matter. He is a changeling, a misfit, an outlander. He doesn't match the rest
  of the family at all. The Hardcastles, as I have known them, have been
  typical English landed gentry; straight-going, honourable men who lived
  within their income and paid their way and did their duty justly and even
  generously to their tenants.</p>

  <p>"Now this man is a different type altogether. His appearance and manner
  suggest a flash bookmaker rather than a country gentleman. My gorge rose at
  him as soon as I clapped eyes on him, and I don't fancy I was any too civil.
  Which was a tactical mistake, under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Is he a man of independent means," asked Thorndyke, "or does he do
  anything for a living?"</p>

  <p>"I have never heard that he has any means," replied Brodribb, "and I do
  know that he is occasionally in pretty low water, for there are several loans
  from Sir Edward outstanding against him. As to his occupation, God knows what
  it is. I should say he is a sort of cosmopolitan adventurer, always on the
  move, prowling about the continental watering-places, living on his wits, or
  the deficiency of other people's. A distinctly shady customer in my opinion.
  And there is another thing. In the course of his travels he has picked up a
  foreign wife; a Russian woman of some sort&mdash;may be a Jewess for all I
  know."</p>

  <p>"What an inveterate old John Bull it is," chuckled Thorndyke. "But we
  mustn't be too insular, you know, Brodribb. There are plenty of most
  estimable and charming Russian ladies; and even if she should be a Jewess,
  surely you would not deny that she would belong to a very distinguished and
  gifted race."</p>

  <p>Brodribb grunted. "The Lady of Bradstow," said he, "should be an English
  lady, not a Russian or a Jewess. Besides, this person is not an estimable and
  charming lady, as you express it. She had to hop out of Russia mighty sharp
  in consequence of some political rumpus&mdash;and you know what that means in
  that part of the world. And a brother of hers was I believe, actually tried
  and convicted."</p>

  <p>"Still," I urged, "political offences are not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are not what?" interrupted Brodribb. "I am surprised at you, Jervis, a
  member of the English Bar, condoning crime. A lawyer should revere the law
  above everything. No, sir, crime is crime. A man who would compass the death
  of a Tsar would murder anyone else if it served his purpose."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said Thorndyke, "we may sympathise with your distaste for
  the present claimant; but, as you say, your feeling as to his suitability or
  unsuitability for the position is beside the mark. The only question is as to
  the soundness of his claim. And that question is not urgent at the
  moment."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Brodribb, "not at this moment. But it may become urgent in
  twenty-four hours. And this fellow thinks that the question is settled
  already. As he talked to me in my office, his manner was that of the heir
  just waiting to step into possession."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Thorndyke, "I understand that he knows exactly how Sir
  Edward has disposed of the personal estate. How did he come by that
  knowledge?"</p>

  <p>"Sir Edward gave him all the particulars as to the provisions of the will.
  He thought it the fair thing to do, though it seemed to me rather
  unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"It was the kind thing to do," said I. "It will have saved him a rather
  severe disappointment. But what are you going to do if he shows signs of
  undue activity?"</p>

  <p>"What the deuce can I do?" demanded Brodribb "That is the question that is
  worrying me. I have no locus standi; and the beggar knows it. Practically
  told me so."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "you are Sir Edward's man of business and his
  executor."</p>

  <p>"I shall be the executor," Brodribb corrected, "when Sir Edward dies or
  his death is proved or presumed. So long as he remains alive, in a legal
  sense, my powers as an executor have not come into being. On the other hand,
  my position as his solicitor gives me no authority to act without his
  instructions. I hold no power of attorney. In his absence I have really no
  locus standi at all. Of course, if he does not turn up, alive or dead, some
  arrangements will have to be made for administering the estate and carrying
  on generally. But the application for powers to do that will be made by the
  legally interested party&mdash;the heir presumptive."</p>

  <p>"And supposing," said I, "Sir Edward should be proved to be dead&mdash;say
  by the finding of his body&mdash;your powers as the executor of the will
  would then come into being. In that capacity, would you accept David
  Hardcastle as the heir?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb regarded me speculatively for some moments before replying.
  At length he said with quiet emphasis, and speaking very deliberately: "No, I
  should not&mdash;as matters stand at present." He paused, still with his eyes
  fixed on me, and then continued. "A very curious thing has happened. After my
  interview with Mr. David, realising that the question of the succession might
  become acute at any moment, I did what I ought to have done long ago. I set
  to work to clear up the circumstances of Gervase's death and to try to settle
  the question as to whether there had been any issue of the marriage, and, if
  so, whether there could possibly be a son living. I began by looking up that
  cutting from The Times that I told you about. As I mentioned to you, no
  address was given. But there was the date; and with that I thought I should
  have no difficulty in getting a copy of the death certificate, on which, of
  course, the address would be stated, and at that address it might be possible
  to start some enquiries.</p>

  <p>"Accordingly, off I went to Somerset House and proceeded to look up the
  register of deaths for that date. To my astonishment, the name was not there.
  Thinking that, perhaps, a wrong date had been given, I looked up and down the
  entries for a week or two before and after the given date. But there was no
  sign of the name of Gervase Hardcastle. Then I settled down to make a
  thorough search, beginning ten years before the date and going on ten years
  after. But still there was no sign of the name. I noted one or two other
  Hardcastles and got copies of the certificates corresponding to the entries,
  but the particulars showed them all to relate to strangers.</p>

  <p>"Then I went down to Brighton and personally called upon the local
  registrars and got them to overhaul their records. But the result was the
  same in all the cases. There was no record of the death of Gervase
  Hardcastle. Now what do you make of that?"</p>

  <p>"Mighty little," said Thorndyke. "Apparently, the notice in The Times was
  a false notice, but why it should have been inserted it is difficult to
  guess."</p>

  <p>"Unless," I suggested, "he was living under an assumed name and that name
  was given to the registrar, the true name being published for the information
  of the family."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "I don't think that will do, Jervis," said he.
  "The person who sent the notice to The Times knew his proper name, age and
  description. There is no imaginable reason why a person having that knowledge
  should give a false name to the registrar, and there are the best of reasons
  why he should not."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible," I suggested, "that he may have committed suicide and
  sent off the notice himself before completing the job?</p>

  <p>"It is possible, of course," replied Thorndyke, "but, in the absence of
  any positive fact indicating the probability of its having occurred, the mere
  possibility is not worth considering."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Brodribb, "it is of no use guessing. The important truth that
  emerges is that his death, which has been accepted all these years by the
  family as an established fact, has now become extremely doubtful. At any
  rate, there is no legal evidence that he is dead. No court would entertain a
  mere obituary notice unsupported by any corresponding entry in the register
  of deaths. Legally speaking, Gervase is presumably still living, and it is
  not at all improbable that he is actually alive."</p>

  <p>"Then, in that case," said I, "why do you say that David has a good claim
  to be the heir?"</p>

  <p>"Because he is here and visible&mdash;extremely visible; whereas the very
  existence of Gervase is problematical. David's claim is good unless it is
  contested by Gervase. In Gervase's absence, I think David would have no
  difficulty in taking possession. Who could oppose him? If I did, as executor
  (and I think I should have a try), the probability is that his claim would be
  admitted, subject to the chance that Gervase or his heir might come forward
  later and endeavour to oust him."</p>

  <p>"And meanwhile?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, I propose setting on foot some enquiries by which I hope to be
  able to pick up some trace of Gervase on the Continent. It isn't a very
  hopeful task, I must admit."</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine any less hopeful task," said I, "than searching for a man
  who has been lost to sight for over sixteen years, who was probably living
  under an assumed name and whose place of abode at any time is utterly
  unknown. I don't see how you are going to start."</p>

  <p>"I am not very clear, myself," Brodribb admitted; and with this, as it was
  now growing late, he rose, and, having gathered up his hat and stick, shook
  our hands despondently and took his departure.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V. &mdash; FINE FEATHERS MAKE FINE BIRDS</h2>

  <h3>(JASPER GRAY'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">THE providence that doth shape our ends is apt to do so by
  methods so unobtrusive as entirely to escape our notice. Passively we float
  on the quiet stream of events with no suspicion as to whither we are being
  carried until at last we are thrown up high and dry on the shore of our
  destiny, the mere jetsam of unnoted circumstances.</p>

  <p>When I drew up my truck at the shabby door of a studio in a mews near
  Fitzroy Square and pulled the bell-handle no intelligible message was borne
  to me by the tintinnabulation from within; nor, when the door was opened by a
  pleasant-faced grey-haired woman in a blue overall, did I recognise the chief
  arbiter&mdash;or shall I say arbitress?&mdash;of my fate. I merely pulled off
  my cap and said: "A roll of paper, madam, from Sturt and Wopsalls."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm glad you've come," she said. "Shall I help you to carry it
  in?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, madam," I replied, "but I think I can manage without troubling
  you."</p>

  <p>It was an unwieldy roll of cartoon paper, six feet long and uncommonly
  heavy. But I was used to handling ponderous and unshapely packages, and I got
  the roll on my shoulder without difficulty. The lady preceded me down a
  passage and into a great, bare studio, where, according to directions, I laid
  the roll down on the floor in a corner.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be very strong," the lady remarked.</p>

  <p>"I'm pretty strong, thank you, madam," I answered; adding that I got a
  good deal of exercise.</p>

  <p>Here a second lady, rather younger than the first, turned from her easel
  to look at me.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he would help us to move that costume chest," she said.</p>

  <p>I expressed my willingness to do anything that would be of service to
  them; and being shown the chest, a huge box-settle with an upholstered top, I
  skilfully coaxed it along the bare floor to the place by the wall that had
  been cleared for it.</p>

  <p>"Would you like a glass of lemonade?" the elder lady asked when she had
  thanked me.</p>

  <p>I accepted gratefully, for it was a hot day; though, for that matter, I
  believe a healthy boy of seventeen would drink lemonade with pleasure at the
  North Pole. Accordingly a glass jug and a tumbler were placed on a little
  table by the settle and I was invited to sit down and refresh at my leisure;
  which I did, staring about me meanwhile with the lively curiosity proper to
  my age. It was a great barn of a place with rough, white washed walls, which
  were, however, mostly covered with large paper cartoons, on which life-size
  figure subjects were broadly sketched in charcoal. There were also a number
  of smaller studies of heads and limbs and some complete
  figures&mdash;complete, that is to say, excepting as to their clothing; and
  the strangely aboriginal state of these, even allowing for the heat of the
  weather, occasioned profound speculations on my part.</p>

  <p>As I sat sipping the lemonade and gaping at the pictures with serene
  enjoyment, the two ladies conversed in low tones and disjointed scraps of
  their conversation reached my ears, though I tried not to listen.</p>

  <p>"Yes" (this was the elder lady), "and not only so handsome but so exactly
  the correct type. And a rare type, too. Even the colouring is absolutely
  perfect."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed the other; "it is typical. So clean-cut, refined and
  symmetrical. A little severe, but all the better for that; and really quite
  distinguished&mdash;quite distinguished."</p>

  <p>Here I happened to glance at the ladies and was dismayed to find them both
  looking very attentively at me. I blushed furiously. Could they be talking
  about me? It seemed impossible. Sturt and Wopsall's parcels-boy could hardly
  be described as a distinguished person. But it almost seemed as if they were,
  for the elder lady said with an engaging smile: "We want to see how you would
  look in a wig. Would you mind trying one on?"</p>

  <p>This was a staggerer, but of course I didn't mind. It was rather a "lark"
  in fact. And when the lady produced from a cupboard a golden wig with long
  ringlets, I sniggered shyly and allowed her to put it on my head. The two
  women looked at me with their heads on one side and then at one another.</p>

  <p>"It's the very thing, you know," said the younger lady.</p>

  <p>The other nodded, and, addressing me, said: "Would you just frown a little
  and put on a rather haughty expression?"</p>

  <p>Needless to say, I grinned like a Cheshire cat, and, a heroic effort to
  control my features only ended in violent giggles. The two ladies smiled
  good-humouredly, and the elder said, in a wheedling tone:</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you would do me a very great favour."</p>

  <p>"I would if I could," was my prompt and natural reply.</p>

  <p>"It is this," she continued. "I am painting a picture of an incident in
  the French Revolution to be called 'An Aristocrat at Bay'. I suppose you have
  heard of the French Revolution?"</p>

  <p>I had. In fact I had read Carlyle's work on the subject&mdash;and didn't
  think much of it&mdash;and the "Tale of Two Cities" which I had found greatly
  superior.</p>

  <p>"Very well," my new friend went on, "then I will show you the sketch for
  the picture;" and she led me to a great easel with a handle like that of a
  barrel-organ, on which was a large canvas with a sheet of cartoon paper
  pinned on it. The sketch, which was roughly put in with charcoal and tinted
  in parts with an occasional smear of pastel or wash of water-colour, showed a
  lady standing in a doorway at the top of a flight of steps around the foot of
  which surged a crowd of revolutionaries.</p>

  <p>"My difficulty," the lady continued, "is this. I have got a model for the
  figure of the Aristocrat but I can't get a suitable model for the head. Now
  you happen to suit perfectly and the question is, will you let me paint the
  head from you?"</p>

  <p>"But it's a woman!" I protested.</p>

  <p>That lady knew something about boys. "I know," she said; "but a man would
  do as well if he was clean-shaved and wore a wig. You will say yes, now,
  won't you? Of course it is a business arrangement. You will be paid for your
  time."</p>

  <p>Eventually it was settled that I should sit from six to eight every
  morning&mdash;I wasn't due at the warehouse until half-past eight&mdash;and
  breakfast in the studio afterwards. I didn't much like this latter
  arrangement for Pontifex and I always breakfasted together and the old
  gentleman would miss me. My employer suggested that he should come to
  breakfast too; but this would not do. Poor old Ponty would have pawned my
  boots if the whisky had run short, but he took no favours from strangers.
  However, my salary was to be twelve shillings a week, Sunday sittings to be
  extra pro rata, and that would have to compensate. I agreed to the terms and
  the arrangement was fixed.</p>

  <p>"Your hair is rather long," said my employer. "Would you mind having it
  cut short, so as to let the wig set more closely?"</p>

  <p>Would I mind! For, twelve shillings a week I would have had my head shaved
  and painted in green and red stripes. As a matter of fact I went that very
  evening to a barber and made him trim me until my head looked like a ball of
  brown plush. Which must have made Providence wink the eye that was fixed on
  my destiny.</p>

  <p>The sittings&mdash;or rather standings&mdash;began two days later, when I
  took up my pose on the model's throne, rigged out in the full costume of a
  royalist lady and an aristocrat; my first appearance in either character.
  After the sitting we all had breakfast in a corner of the studio, and the two
  ladies crammed me until I was ready to burst with nourishment and gratitude.
  They were dear women. I loved them both from the very beginning, with a
  slight preference, perhaps, for my employer, Miss Vernet; though, to be sure,
  the younger lady, Miss Brandon, was a lovable creature, too. But I must not
  linger on their perfections. Reluctantly I must leave them for a while to
  relate a most singular adventure that arose in part out of my employment by
  them.</p>

  <p>It was, I think, on the day of my fourth sitting that I had a stroke of
  luck; a parcel&mdash;and not a very large one, either&mdash;to deliver to a
  bibliophile who kept a private press somewhere out Tottenham way and close to
  the river Lea. It was virtually a day's holiday with a railway fare thrown
  in, and I set forth jubilantly with the parcel on my shoulder, whistling an
  operatic air as I went. The train bore me luxuriously to Black Horse Road
  Station, I found the house of the bibliophile, delivered my parcel, a then,
  free as air, struck out across the fields towards the river.</p>

  <p>Along the shallow, winding stream that runs parallel to the 'Lea
  Navigation' I wandered with the ecstatic delight of the thoroughbred Londoner
  in rural scenes, be they never so homely. It was a day of wonders. I had
  hardly ever been in the country before and this mere suburb&mdash;though it
  was more rural then than now&mdash;gave to my urban eyes a veritable glimpse
  of Paradise. I looked into the few inches of running water and saw actual
  fish. I watched an angler and saw him land, with elaborate artifice, what
  looked like a piece of cheese. For the first time in my life I looked upon a
  living frog and chased it to its lair under the bank. And then I came on a
  group of urchins, disporting themselves, as naked as cherubim, in the
  shallows; and Providence closed its left eye firmly.</p>

  <p>It was a roasting day. Those urchins were certainly naked and wet and
  probably cool. How delicious! And why not? There was no one about, and there
  was plenty of cover. Five minutes later I had shed my garments beside a
  willow bush and was lying on my stomach in four inches of water making
  frantic efforts to swim.</p>

  <p>I waded joyfully up the stream, sometimes almost knee-deep, and
  impersonated characters suitable to the scenery. Now I was some sort of
  Indian and impaled fish&mdash;which weren't there&mdash;with an imaginary
  barbed spear. There I discovered a curious lurking-place under a large
  pollard and between two clumps of willow-bush; and forthwith I tucked myself
  into it, becoming instantly&mdash;as I persuaded myself&mdash;invisible to
  mortal eyes. I was now an Indian no longer. My role had changed to that of
  some unclassified species of water-sprite; at least I think so, though I am
  not quite clear; for the fact is that, at this moment, a nursemaid with two
  children hove in sight on the bank facing me, and, having sauntered along
  with exasperating slowness, finally sat down exactly opposite my hiding-place
  and produced a novelette which she began to read with much composure and
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>I watched her balefully; and I watched the children. Especially, I watched
  the children. And meanwhile I sat up to my hips in water, finding it
  delightfully cool and shady beneath the pollard.</p>

  <p>The minutes wore on. It was still cool. Surprisingly so, considering the
  heat of the sun outside. In fact my teeth presently began to chatter slightly
  and an urgent desire to sample the sunshine once more made itself felt. But
  there I was, and there I must stay until the young lady opposite moved on;
  for I was a modest youth with a rather exaggerated notion of the delicacy of
  young women. And, after all, the situation was of my own making.</p>

  <p>At last, one of the children observed me and pointed me out with a yell of
  ecstasy. "Oh! Look, Nanny! What's that hiding in the water over there?</p>

  <p>"It's nothing, dear," replied Nanny, without raising her eyes from her
  novelette; "only a frog."</p>

  <p>"But it looks like a man," the young viper protested.</p>

  <p>"I know, dear. They do," and Nanny went on serenely with her reading.</p>

  <p>The child was evidently dissatisfied and continued to stare at me with
  large, devouring eyes, and was presently joined by his fellow demon. But now
  a new object appeared, to divert their attention and mine. A man came along
  the bank just behind them, walking quickly and breaking now and again, into a
  shambling trot. I watched him at first without special interest; but when he
  had passed, and a back view was presented, I found myself viewing him with
  suddenly-awakened curiosity. What first attracted my attention was a patch in
  the rear of his trousers. For my own trousers had a precisely similar patch:
  I had sewn it in myself, so I knew it thoroughly. It was an extraordinary
  coincidence. The two patches were identical in shape and colour, but more
  than this; the pattern of the man's trousers was absolutely the same as the
  pattern of mine. There could be no doubt about it. They were made from the
  same piece; or else&mdash;Yes! The horrible conviction forced itself on
  me&mdash;they were my trousers!</p>

  <p>But that was not all. A glance at the coat, Yea! and even the cap,
  revealed familiar traits. The fellow was walking off in my clothes!</p>

  <p>For a brief space, modesty, anger and chilly horror struggled for mastery;
  and in that interval the man disappeared over a fence. Then modesty was
  "outed" and I stood up. The children howled with joy; the nursemaid bounced
  up and retreated, making audible references to a "disgusting creature," and I
  ran splashing through the shallows towards the spot where I had undressed.
  For it was fairly certain that the man had not come to this place unclothed.
  He must have left some sort of exuvium in place of mine. But if the exchange
  had been worth his while&mdash;well! my expectations expressed themselves in
  a premonitory impulse to scratch myself, for whatever the clothes were like,
  I should have to put them on.</p>

  <p>The reality turned out to be better and worse than my anticipations. The
  clothes were good enough; better than mine, in fact, though the
  colour&mdash;a dusty buff&mdash;was disagreeable. But it was the decoration
  that spoiled them. Some misguided person had covered them with a pattern that
  recalled the device on a bench mark. The broad arrow, to put it in a
  nutshell. My absent friend was a run-away convict.</p>

  <p>I huddled the wretched garments on as quickly as I could, for I was
  chilled to the marrow; and as I stood up in that livery of shame, I was
  sensible of a subtle influence that exhaled from it, impelling me to skulk in
  unfrequented places and to sneak from cover to cover. Of course the mistake
  could be explained if I was arrested; but I didn't want to be arrested. I was
  safer at large. The better plan was to get home if possible, or make for
  Sturt and Wopsalls, where I was known. But how was I to get home? My return
  ticket was in the pocket of the vanished trousers in company with a
  clasp-knife and eighteen-pence, and miles of town lay between me and
  safety.</p>

  <p>I crept stealthily round the meadows away from the river, keeping under
  the cover of hedges and fences and reviewing anxiously my chances of escape,
  which seemed hopelessly remote. Ahead of me, near the side of a meadow, were
  a couple of hayricks, like enormous loaves; and the narrow space between
  their ends looked a likely place in which to conceal myself while I thought
  over my plans. Accordingly I crept along under the hedge until I was opposite
  the ricks, when I dashed out across the open, darted into the space between
  the ricks, and nearly fell over a man who was lying there smoking a pipe.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," I stammered. "I didn't know you were here."</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it," he replied suavely. "If I'd expected yer I'd ha' told
  the footman to announce yer." He sat up, and, regarding me attentively,
  asked: "And how goes it? Doin' a bit of a skyboozle I guess?" I assented
  vaguely, not being perfectly clear as to the nature of a skyboozle, and he
  then enquired: "How did yer git out o' the jug?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't get out at all. I wasn't ever in."</p>

  <p>"Lor!" he exclaimed. "Wasn't yer? Where did yer git them pretty clothes
  from?"</p>

  <p>I described the disastrous circumstances of the exchange and he listened
  to my story with a foxy smile.</p>

  <p>"Well I'm blowed!" was his comment. "What bloomin' impidence, to take and
  prig a young gentleman's clothes. I call it actially rude. And he seems to
  'ave cut yer 'air, too. He oughtn't to 'a done that. He'll 'ave to be spoke
  to."</p>

  <p>At this reference to my closely cropped hair, I started violently. That
  was an added danger that I had overlooked, and I was so much disturbed by it
  that I have no recollection of my friend's further remarks; only I know that
  they were few and brief, for he shortly rose, and, knocking out his pipe
  (against the rick), looked at me with profound attention.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, at length, "I must be movin' on or I shall be late for
  lunch. You'd best lay down 'ere and 'ave a good rest, 'cos you may have to
  make a bolt for it any minute, and the fresher you are the quicker you'll be
  able to leg it. So long."</p>

  <p>With these words of sage advice, he turned and sauntered away with
  funereal slowness, looking back once or twice to see if I had profited by his
  counsel. I sat down&mdash;not where he had been lying&mdash;and when he
  looked back again and observed this, he nodded approvingly and changed his
  direction slightly, so that he passed out of view. But the influence of that
  livery of dishonour had made me wary. After waiting a few seconds, I crept on
  all fours to the corner of the rick and peeped round; and behold! my friend's
  pace was funereal no longer; he was running across the meadow like a
  slip-shod, disreputable hare. And I had no difficulty in guessing at his
  destination.</p>

  <p>I let him get well out of sight and then I followed his example in the
  opposite direction. Skirting the adjoining meadow, I came to a hedge that
  bordered a by-road; and here I lurked awhile, for a van was approaching,
  though it was still some distance away, and I was afraid to cross the road
  until it had passed. I watched the vehicle wistfully as it drew nearer.
  Through the opening of the tilt I could see that it was empty, or nearly so;
  and, from the conduct of the driver, who lolled in the corner of his seat and
  chanted a popular ballad, I judged that he had finished his delivery and was
  homeward bound.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer drew the van at a steady jog-trot. Now I could see the
  driver's face and hear the words of his song. I could also make out the tops
  of one or two cases&mdash;probably empties&mdash;rising above the back of his
  seat; and I crouched by a gap in the hedge, my heart thumping violently and
  my knees trembling. At last the van came rumbling by. I had a brief view of a
  familiar name and of the words "Theobald's Road" painted on the tilt, and it
  had passed.</p>

  <p>I looked out of the gap. Besides the carter there was not a soul in sight.
  The tail-board of the van was up, its body was half empty, and the driver's
  back was towards me. In a moment I was out through the gap and padding along
  swiftly in my soft prison shoes after the van. I had my hands on the
  tail-board, I gave a light spring, remained poised for a moment on the edge,
  and then stealthily crawling over, crept silently into the space between two
  empty cases. For the moment I was saved.</p>

  <p>The van rattled along and the driver, all unconscious of his passenger,
  carolled blithely. From my retreat I could see out at the back by peeping
  round a case, and so ascertain our direction; and I was somewhat alarmed
  presently to observe that the road took a sharp turn towards the place where
  the tramp had disappeared. This made me so uneasy that I risked craning up to
  look out through the front of the van; and when I did so, I got a most
  terrible shock. Far away along the road, but coming towards us, was a small
  crowd of men, and, as we mutually approached, I could make out at least one
  constable in uniform among them. A little nearer and I was able to recognise
  the tramp, walking by the constable and evidently acting as guide. I broke
  out into a cold perspiration. Would that constable stop the van and search
  it? It was quite possible; it was even likely. And again I craned up and
  peeped at my enemies.</p>

  <p>We were getting quite near when the tramp stopped and pointed at the
  ricks, no doubt. Then he climbed over the fence that bordered the road. The
  constable followed him and the others followed the constable; and so they
  passed out of view.</p>

  <p>But they came into sight again shortly from the back of the van, and now I
  could see the ricks, too. The crowd had deployed out into a long, curved line
  and were advancing, in the highest style of strategy, under the direction of
  the tramp and the constable. It reminded me of the formation of the Spanish
  Armada, as that great fleet swept up-channel. I didn't see the end of it. The
  line was still deploying out to encircle the rick when the van turned sharply
  and rumbled over a bridge. I was sorry to miss the denouement; but perhaps it
  was better so. After all, my business was to get clear away.</p>

  <p>The van rumbled on at its quiet jog-trot and all seemed plain sailing.
  Through the northern suburbs and gradually into the town by way of Stamford
  Hill and Stoke Newington. And still all went well until we came out of the
  Essex Road and drew nigh unto the Angel at Islington; when the Devil entered
  into the carman and caused him to draw up by a public house and inspect the
  interior of the van.</p>

  <p>Of course he saw me at once though I squeezed myself into the farthest
  corner between the cases, and with a sort of gruff reluctance, he ordered me
  to clear out. I begged to be allowed to travel with him as far as Theobald's
  Road, and began to tender explanations; but he shook his head decidedly.</p>

  <p>"I'd be in chokee myself if I let you," said he, "and I can't afford that
  with a wife and family to keep."</p>

  <p>There was nothing more to be said. Reluctantly and with deep misgivings, I
  bundled out and began to walk away briskly along the crowded pavement. But I
  didn't get far. Before I had gone a hundred yards, two tall men who were
  walking towards me suddenly roused and, darting at me, seized me by the
  arms.</p>

  <p>"Have you got a pair of darbies about you, Sims?" one of them asked the
  other. Fortunately Mr. Sims had not but suggested that "this young feller"
  did not look like giving trouble, whereupon, the two officers began to walk
  me along briskly in the direction of the Angel.</p>

  <p>There was no lack of public recognition. I had already gathered quite a
  nice little following when I met the detectives, and my retinue increased so
  rapidly that before we reached the Angel we had become the centre of a
  hurrying hallooing crowd. At this point, my captors decided to cross the
  road.</p>

  <p>Now the traffic about the cross roads by the Angel is usually pretty
  dense. On this occasion, I think it was denser than usual, and when our
  procession launched itself from the kerb, it reached a superlative degree of
  density. Vans, omnibuses, hansoms, all manner of vehicles slowed down that
  their drivers might get a better view of the man in motley. For the moment
  the roadway seemed to be completely choked with vehicles and foot-passengers,
  and from the closely-packed throng there arose a very babel of shouts and
  cheers. Thus we were standing in the roadway, jammed immovably, when above
  the universal uproar, rose a new sound; a thunderous rattle, jingling of
  small bells and a quick succession of shouts. The omnibuses, vans and hansoms
  began to back hurriedly towards the pavements, their drivers cheering lustily
  and flourishing their whips; the mob surged to and fro, a cloud of smoke and
  sparks arose behind them; there was a vision of gleaming brass helmets and of
  galloping horses bearing down apparently straight on us; the rattling,
  jingling and shouting swelled into a deafening roar, and the crowd surged
  away to the right and left.</p>

  <p>"Look out, Sims!" yelled the other detective. "They'll be on top of us."
  He thrust his shoulder into the crowd and dragged me out of the track of the
  oncoming engine. The horses dashed by within a few inches; the rushing wheels
  grazed our very toes and still I kept a cool head. With eyes dazzled by the
  scarlet glare, the glitter of brass and the flying sparks, I watched for my
  chance and took it. As the shining boiler whizzed past, I made a quick snatch
  at the big brass rail that supports the foot-plate, and at the same moment,
  jumped forward. The sudden wrench nearly dislocated my arm; but it was a
  strong arm and I held on. The jerk whisked me clean out of the grasp of the
  two officers; I swung round behind the engine and, grabbing the engineer with
  my other hand, hauled myself on to the foot-plate. A single, instantaneous
  glance backward showed me two plain-clothes officers lying on their backs
  with their feet in the air. Of course they could not have maintained that
  position permanently, but I saw them only for the fraction of a second and
  that was how they appeared.</p>

  <p>The engine rattled on. The coachman and his two satellites had naturally
  seen nothing; and the four men who sat back to back on the body of the engine
  also appeared to be unaware of my arrival though, oddly enough, they were all
  on the broad grin and their "Hi, hies!" tended at times to be tremulous. Even
  the engineer, whom I clasped fondly by the waist, seemed to be oblivious of
  my presence and stolidly shovelled coal into the little furnace.</p>

  <p>We swept round the corner at the "Angel," and never shall I forget the way
  in which we thundered down Pentonville Hill with our brakes on and our horses
  at full gallop. I think I have never enjoyed anything so thoroughly. The
  engine skidded to and fro, the firemen yelled themselves purple, houses and
  lamp-posts flashed by and far ahead, even unto King's Cross, an expectant
  crowd awaited us with welcoming bellows. We passed through the narrow strait
  at the foot of the hill like a royal procession; our arrival was respectfully
  anticipated at the crossing by the Great Northern, and we thundered down the
  Euston Road between ranks of waiting omnibuses like the leaders in a chariot
  race. We were approaching Tottenham Court Road when the engineer observed
  placidly, apparently addressing his remark to the pressure gauge, that "there
  was such things as telegraph wires and it might be as well to hop off." I
  accepted the friendly hint, and as we turned into the latter thoroughfare I
  dropped from the foot-plate and made a bolt down Warren Street. The engine
  gave me a send-off, for it attracted so much attention that I was, at first,
  almost unnoticed; it was only when I had covered half the length of Warren
  Street, that juvenile and other loafers, deciding that a convict in the hand
  is worth two fire engines in the bush, turned to follow my fortunes, or
  misfortunes, as the case might be.</p>

  <p>What manner of crowd it was that howled at my heels, I cannot say, for I
  did not look back. I was on familiar ground and I now had a definite
  objective. Miss Vernet's studio backed on a mews, and there was a large
  window which was usually left open. That was my port of salvation. Swiftly I
  zigzagged up and down the narrow streets, keeping my pursuers at a
  respectable distance, and gradually drawing nearer to the vicinity of the
  mews. At length I shot round the last corner and, diving into the entrance of
  the mews, padded furiously over the rough cobbles. The place was fortunately
  empty, for it was now late afternoon, and half-way down, the open window
  yawned hospitably. Setting my foot on a brick plinth, I sprang up, grasped
  the window-sill and shot in through the opening like a harlequin.</p>

  <p>My arrival on all-fours on the studio floor was hailed by startled shrieks
  from my two friends who were hard at work at their easels. But, of course,
  they recognised me at once, and a few words of breathless explanation enabled
  them to grasp the state of affairs.</p>

  <p>"Get into the dressing-room instantly," said Miss Vernet, "and put on your
  costume."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and throw us out those horrible clothes," added Miss Brandon.</p>

  <p>I shot into the dressing-room, and peeling off the garb of infamy with the
  speed of a quick-change artist, threw the garments out and whisked the
  costume down from its pegs; and even as the roar of many voices from the mews
  outside announced the arrival of my pursuers, I dropped the gown over my
  head, secured the fastenings with trembling fingers and clapped the ringlets
  on my stubbly pate. When I came out into the studio Miss Brandon had just
  closed the costume chest, on the lid of which she was piling palettes,
  paint-tubes and sheafs of brushes, and Miss Vernet was standing at her
  easel.</p>

  <p>"Now," she said briskly, "get on the throne and take up your pose; and
  pull your gloves on. They mustn't see your hands."</p>

  <p>I had just struggled into my long gloves and taken up the pose when the
  murmur of voices announced the return of my pursuers from an unsuccessful
  quest at the end of the mews. There was a scrambling sound and a disreputable
  head and shoulders framed itself in the window, and the eyes appertaining
  thereto glared inquisitively into the studio. Then it disappeared with a
  suddenness suggestive of outside assistance; the scrambling sound was renewed
  and a helmeted head rose majestically in its place. The constable gazed in
  enquiringly, and had just opened his mouth as if about to speak, when he
  caught the stern and for bidding eye of Miss Vernet, which seemed to paralyse
  him completely.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing at my window, sir?" the lady demanded acidly.</p>

  <p>The constable's mouth opened once more and this time with more result.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, madam," said he, "but there is an escaped
  convict&mdash;" here the constable disappeared with the same suddenness as
  the previous observer, his toes having apparently slipped off the brick
  coping. He did not reappear, but I heard a voice, which seemed to be his,
  enquiring irritably: "Where's the dam door?"</p>

  <p>Somebody must have shown him the "dam door", for after a brief pause, the
  studio bell rang and Miss Brandon, smothering her giggles, went out and
  returned accompanied by two constables and two elderly gentlemen. The latter
  came in in a state of hilarity that contrasted strongly with the solemnity of
  the officials.</p>

  <p>"I hear you've got a convict hiding in here," said one of them, a
  fresh-faced farmer-like looking gentleman.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" demanded Miss Vernet, whisking round from her easel.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam," said one of the constables, staring hard at the picture and
  then glaring at me. "A convict who has escaped from Pentonville is believed
  to have climbed in at your window."</p>

  <p>"At my window!" shrieked Miss Vernet, "but what a frightful thing, and how
  disgraceful of you to let him. I call it a perfect scandal that a respectable
  householder, paying police rates, should be subjected to the annoyance and
  danger of having hordes of convicts and criminals swarming in at all the
  windows if they happen to be left open."</p>

  <p>"Oh, droar it mild, madam," protested the constable. "It ain't as bad as
  that. There's only one of them."</p>

  <p>"If there's one there may be a dozen," Miss Vernet replied, rather
  illogically, I thought, "and I insist on your searching the premises and
  removing every one of them."</p>

  <p>"Is that the window?" asked the gentleman who had spoken before. The
  constable admitted that it was. "But, my good man," the gentleman protested,
  "how could anyone have got in without being seen?"</p>

  <p>The constable suggested that the ladies might have been looking the other
  way at the time, at which both the old gentlemen laughed aloud and shook
  their heads.</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said Miss Vernet, laying down her palette, "I must insist
  on having the premises searched thoroughly," and thereupon she and Miss
  Brandon conducted the two constables out through the doorway that led to the
  kitchen and offices. As soon as they were gone, the two gentlemen settled
  themselves to examine the picture, and from the canvas they presently turned
  their attention to me with an intentness that made my flesh creep. The
  farmer-like gentleman seemed particularly interested, and having minutely
  compared me with the figure on the canvas, turned suddenly to his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"This is a most extraordinary coincidence, Brodribb," said he; and as he
  spoke I was dimly aware of something familiar in the sound of the name.</p>

  <p>The other gentleman&mdash;a fine, jovial-looking old cock with a
  complexion like that of a Dublin Bay prawn and hair like white
  silk&mdash;looked about him a little vaguely and then asked: "What is?</p>

  <p>"That figure in the picture," his friend replied. "Doesn't it recall
  anything to your mind?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb looked at the canvas with a frown of concentration and an air
  of slight perplexity, but apparently without the desired effect on his
  memory, for, after a prolonged stare, he shook his head and replied: "I can't
  say that it does."</p>

  <p>"Come and stand here," said the other, stepping back a couple of paces,
  "and look carefully at the central figure only, taking the architrave of the
  door way as the picture frame. Is there no portrait that you have ever seen
  that it reminds you of?"</p>

  <p>Again Mr. Brodribb looked and again he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear," exclaimed the farmer-like gentleman, "and to think how many
  dozens of times you must have looked on it! Don't you remember a portrait
  that hangs over the fireplace in the small drawing room at Bradstow? A
  portrait by Romney of, I think, a Miss Isabel Hardcastle."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb brightened up. "Yes, yes, of course," said he, "I remember
  the portrait that you mention. Not very well, though. But what about it?</p>

  <p>"Why, my dear Brodribb, this figure is an almost exact replica. The dress
  is of the same character and the pose is similar, though that might easily be
  in an historical picture of the same period. But the most astonishing
  resemblance is in the face. This might be a copy."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb looked interested. "I remember the picture," said he, "and I
  recognise the general resemblance now you point it out, though I can't recall
  the face. I am not a portrait painter, you see, Sir Giles, so I haven't your
  memory for faces. But if the facial resemblance is as strong as you say it is
  in the two portraits, a very interesting fact seems to follow; for as this
  portrait is an excellent likeness of this young lady," (here the old
  gentleman bowed to me deferentially, whereupon I grinned and turned as red as
  a lobster) "she must be extremely like the subject of the other portrait, is
  it not so?"</p>

  <p>Sir Giles laughed a fine, jolly, agricultural laugh. "Q.E.D., hey,
  Brodribb. Very acutely argued. Discreetly, too, as we can't put the other
  lady in evidence. But, of course, you're right."</p>

  <p>At this point the two ladies returned, accompanied by the constables, who
  were both looking into the interiors of their helmets and bore a subtle
  suggestion of having taken refreshment. They departed with thanks and
  apologies, and the two ladies and the gentlemen then engaged in a spirited
  discussion on the composition of the picture. I was glad when it came to an
  end and the two gentlemen took their leave&mdash;each with a valedictory bow
  to me, which I returned to the best of my ability&mdash;for I was tired and
  hungry and wanted to get home.</p>

  <p>"Now, Jasper," said Miss Vernet, when she had shown them out, "the
  question is how we are to get you away from here. You can't wear the prison
  clothes and you can't go home in your costume. What are we to do, Lucy?"</p>

  <p>Miss Brandon reflected awhile and then suggested: "There's that widow's
  costume, you know. That would fit him."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course," agreed Miss Vernet, "it's the very thing. He shall put
  it on and I will walk home with him, myself."</p>

  <p>And so the tragedy ended. Less than an hour later, a tall and
  gawky-looking widow might have been seen&mdash;but fortunately was
  not&mdash;sneaking up the stairs to the third floor of the house in Great
  Ormond Street. Pontifex was out shopping and came in later with a bottle
  under his arm. But by that time, my widowhood had come to an end. The
  resources of my wardrobe were slender, but they included two suits which I
  had outgrown before they had degenerated into mere scarecrow's costume, and
  into one of these I insinuated myself cautiously and with some misgivings as
  to its tensile strength. But, of course, it was impossible. Even Sturt and
  Wopsall's packer revolted at the sight of four inches of visible sock above
  my boots, and besides, I didn't dare to stoop. Miss Vernet had delicately
  hinted as we walked home at a desire to replace my lost garments, but,
  grateful as I was to her the thing was not to be thought of when I had five
  golden sovereigns hidden away. Accordingly, the very next day, I disinterred
  two of them and, making my way to a shop of which I knew in the vicinity of
  Convent Garden, procured in exchange for them a most admirable second-hand
  suit, in which I came forth proudly with my outgrown exuvium under my arm.
  Never before had I been so well dressed. When I returned to the warehouse,
  the packer raised his brown-paper cap and made me a deep bow; and even
  Pontifex, who was not ordinarily acutely observant, eyed that suit in silence
  and with an evidently unsuccessful effort of memory.</p>

  <p>But there was a fly in the ointment&mdash;or perhaps I should say that
  there was a fly&mdash;a butterfly&mdash;missing from the ointment. I hastened
  to sew in at the back of the waistcoat a commodious secret pocket. But alas!
  that pocket was empty. The miserable wretch who had absconded in my patched
  and threadbare clothes, had, all unconsciously, been the bearer of a
  priceless treasure. In the agitation of the moment, I had forgotten the
  emerald that reposed at the back of his&mdash;or rather my&mdash;waistcoat.
  Now, too late, the realisation of my loss was borne in on me and remained for
  weeks a deep and abiding sorrow.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI. &mdash; A VISIT TO STRATFORD ATTE BOW</h2>

  <h3>(DR. JERVIS'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">THE mystery surrounding the disappearance of Sir Edward
  Hardcastle was solved in a very startling and tragic manner; if, indeed, that
  can be called a solution which was even more mysterious than the problem
  which it solved. The news was brought to us late one afternoon by Mr.
  Brodribb, who burst into our chambers in a state of such extreme agitation
  that we were at once prepared for some tidings of disaster.</p>

  <p>"Here is a terrible thing, Thorndyke!" he exclaimed, dropping into a chair
  and mopping his face with his handkerchief. "Sir Edward has made away with
  himself."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke was evidently surprised at the news, as also was I, but he made
  no comment beyond a half-articulate "Ha," and Brodribb continued: "I have
  just had the information from the police. Superintendent Miller was kind
  enough to call on me and give me the report himself. He had no details
  but&mdash;to put the horrible affair in a nutshell&mdash;Sir Edward's body
  was found this morning hanging from a beam in an empty house at
  Stratford."</p>

  <p>"At Stratford!" Thorndyke repeated, incredulously. For if the news of the
  suicide itself was surprising, the alleged circumstances were amazing.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Brodribb, "it is an astonishing affair. I can't imagine what
  can have taken him to Stratford. But I suppose that people in the state of
  mind that is associated with self-destruction are apt to behave in a rather
  unaccountable way. Perhaps some kind of explanation will be forthcoming at
  the inquest, which I understand from the Superintendent is to take place
  to-morrow. It appears that there are some circumstances that make it
  desirable to hold the inquiry as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>We had no difficulty in guessing what those circumstances were, but
  neither of us made any comment.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to go," Brodribb continued; "in fact the Superintendent
  warned me, but I should like you to be present to watch the proceedings, if
  you can manage it. Not that there is any real necessity, since there is no
  insurance question to raise and there seems unfortunately to be no doubt of
  the facts. But inquests are quite out of my province and I should feel more
  satisfied if I had your views on the affair."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke. "I will attend the inquest on your
  instructions. But I think I had better be present at the post mortem, too. I
  should wish to have an opportunity of forming a direct judgement on the facts
  as well as hearing the evidence of the medical witness."</p>

  <p>Brodribb nodded approvingly. "That is what I like about you, Thorndyke,"
  said he. "You are so thorough&mdash;even beyond the necessities of the case.
  You take nothing on trust. But there is another matter. The Superintendent
  urged me&mdash;in fact, I may say that he ordered me&mdash;to go down to
  Stratford this evening and identify the body. He said that it was most
  important that the question of identity should be settled at once, and I
  suppose he is right. But it is frightfully unpleasant."</p>

  <p>I suspected that it would be more unpleasant than he was aware of, but I
  kept my suspicions to myself; and he continued: "I don't see why the
  identification couldn't have been done by Weeks, Sir Edward's butler. They
  have summoned him by telegraph&mdash;I left his name and address with Miller,
  you remember&mdash;and I suppose he will have to see the body. However, the
  Superintendent insisted that I ought to go this evening, so there is no help
  for it. I suppose you couldn't come down with me?" he added, wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke replied, promptly, "I will come with you, and perhaps
  Jervis will keep us company."</p>

  <p>He looked enquiringly at me, and, when I had assented&mdash;which I did
  readily enough&mdash;he resumed: "But there is one thing that must be done,
  at once, since there may not be time to-morrow. I must get a letter from the
  Home Office asking the coroner to give me the necessary facilities. Otherwise
  I may be refused permission to be present at the post mortem."</p>

  <p>"Would that matter?" asked Brodribb. "There can't be much question as to
  the cause of death."</p>

  <p>"That is impossible to say," replied Thorndyke. "If I am to attend I may
  as well be in a position to check the medical evidence. That, in fact, is my
  proper function."</p>

  <p>"But you won't find anybody at the Home Office now," Brodribb
  objected.</p>

  <p>"I think I shall," said Thorndyke. "There is always some responsible
  person on late duty to attend to urgent business. I suggest that you two go
  on to Stratford and wait for me at the police station."</p>

  <p>"No, we won't do that," said Brodribb. "We will wait for you at my office
  and then we can all go down together."</p>

  <p>To this arrangement Thorndyke agreed and took his departure forth en route
  for Whitehall, while Brodribb and I, in more leisurely fashion, made our way
  out into Fleet Street and so, by way of Carey Street to New Square. We did
  not, however, go into Brodribb's office; for our old friend was in a state of
  nervous unrest, and now that he was to have our company on his distasteful
  errand, was all impatience to start. Accordingly we walked together up and
  down the pavement of the quiet square, exchanging now and again a few words
  but mostly occupied with our own thoughts.</p>

  <p>What Brodribb's thoughts were I cannot guess, but my own were fully
  occupied by the communication that he had made to us. For, brief and sketchy
  as it was, it contained matter that certainly invited reflection. Thorndyke,
  I could see, was, if not actually suspicious, at least very definitely on his
  guard. His determination to check the official medical evidence by
  independent observation showed clearly that in his view there might be more
  in the case than might meet the eye of a routine investigator. And I found
  myself in complete agreement with him. The alleged facts carried a distinct
  suggestion of fishiness. As to the probability of Sir Edward's committing
  suicide I could form no opinion; but the circumstances in which the suicide
  had occurred called aloud for inquiry. I was, indeed, somewhat surprised at
  the easy-going fashion in which the usually astute Brodribb had accepted
  them. But perhaps I was doing him an injustice. Possibly he was purposely
  withholding his own doubts the better to test Thorndyke's attitude.</p>

  <p>I had reached this point in my reflections when, on making a quarter-deck
  turn, I perceived my colleague advancing swiftly up the pavement from the
  Carey Street gate. We stepped out to meet him and, as he joined us, Brodribb
  greeted him with the comprehensive question: "Well, what news?"</p>

  <p>"I have got a letter for the coroner asking for facilities, and a hansom
  waiting opposite the gate."</p>

  <p>"Hm," grunted Brodribb, "it will be a damned tight fit."</p>

  <p>And I must admit that it was. Three large men, one of whom was distinctly
  of "a full habit" were more than the coach-builder had made allowance for.
  However, Thorndyke and I bore the brunt of the squeeze, and the journey was
  not a long one. In due course we unpacked ourselves at Liverpool Street
  Station and presently boarded a train bound for Bow and Stratford.</p>

  <p>We travelled for the most part in silence, and what conversation passed
  was not connected with our present quest. There was, in fact, no opportunity
  for interchange of talk on confidential matters as our carriage contained,
  besides ourselves, three passengers, apparently businessmen returning, at the
  end of the day's work, not indeed to Stratford, but to some of the more
  savoury localities in the neighbourhood of Epping Forest. At length a strange
  and repulsive effluvium which began to filter in at the windows, suggestive
  of soap-boiling, glue-making and other odoriferous forms of industry,
  announced our approach to the classical neighbourhood of Stratford atte Bow,
  and a minute or two later we disembarked, Brodribb snorting disgustedly and
  holding a large silk handkerchief to his nose. From the railway station we
  made our way to that of the police, to which Mr. Brodribb had been directed
  by Superintendent Miller; and presenting ourselves to the sergeant on duty in
  the outer office and stating our business, were duly conducted into the inner
  office and the presence of the Station Superintendent.</p>

  <p>The latter turned out to be an eminently helpful officer. Possibly the
  Home Office letter (which, though it was addressed to the coroner, was shown
  to the Superintendent) requesting that Dr. Thorndyke should be given such
  facilities as he might reasonably require, might have influenced him, to say
  nothing of our virtual introduction by Superintendent Miller. But apart from
  this, he was a capable, businesslike man, quite free from any tendency to red
  tape officialism and naturally inclined rather to help than to obstruct.
  Accordingly, when we had presented our credentials and explained our
  connection with the case, he proceeded to give us, without reserve, all the
  information that he possessed.</p>

  <p>"The discovery," he began, "was made this morning about nine o'clock by a
  man named Holker, a retired ship's steward who owns a good deal of low-class
  weekly property about here&mdash;mostly small houses that he has picked up
  cheap and put in some sort of repair himself. He's what you'd call a handy
  man, able to do a job of bricklaying or plastering or joinery, so it doesn't
  cost him much to codge up these old derelicts that he buys. Now, some time
  ago he bought a row of half a dozen little houses that some fool had built on
  a bit of waste land down by Abbey Creek. He got them for next to nothing as
  they had never been inhabited and were in a ruinous condition and stood by an
  unmade road that was often half under water. He meant to do them up and let
  them at low rents to some of the labourers at the works. In fact he started
  work on one of them&mdash;Number Five&mdash;about a month ago, that is how we
  are able to fix the dates. The last time he was working there was Sunday, the
  twenty-first of June, and he is quite sure that nothing had happened then
  because he went all over the house. On Sunday night he was offered, and
  accepted, a temporary job on one of his old ships which traded to Marseilles;
  and on Monday morning he dropped in at the house to fetch away his tools. As
  he was in a hurry, he only went into the front room, where the tools had been
  left, but he could see that someone had been in the house by the fact that a
  glove was lying on the floor. He thought it queer, but, as I said, he was in
  a hurry and as it was an empty house with nothing in it to steal, he didn't
  trouble to look into the matter but just got his tools and came away.</p>

  <p>"That was three weeks ago&mdash;this is the fourteenth. Now, Holker got
  back from his trip yesterday, and this morning he went round to get on with
  his work at the house. As soon as he got there he noticed the glove still
  lying on the floor. And then he noticed&mdash;well he noticed that there was
  something wrong about the house, so he went through to the kitchen and from
  there to the wash-house; and the first thing he saw when he opened the
  wash-house door was a man hanging from a tie-beam. There was no doubt that
  the man was dead and that he had been dead a pretty long time. Holker didn't
  stop to cut the body down. He just bolted out and came up here to report what
  he had seen. I happened to be here at the time so I thought I had better go
  along and see into the affair, though the job didn't sound much of a catch
  from what Holker said. And I can tell you it wasn't. However, I needn't go
  into that. You can imagine what it was like for yourselves.</p>

  <p>"Well, there was the body hanging from the beam and an old, broken-backed
  windsor chair capsized on the floor underneath. Evidently he had stood on the
  chair to tie the rope to the beam and when he had fixed the noose round his
  neck he had kicked the chair over and left himself dangling. It was all
  pretty obvious, fortunately, for one didn't want to spend a lot of time in
  that wash-house making observations. I just cut the rope when the constables
  had got the stretcher underneath and they lowered the body on to it, covered
  it up and carried it away."</p>

  <p>"Concerning the rope," said Thorndyke, as the Superintendent paused; "I
  presume deceased found that on the premises?</p>

  <p>"No," the officer replied, "he must have brought the rope with him for it
  wasn't Hiker's. It was a smallish, brown rope&mdash;looked like
  coir&mdash;and he'd brought more than he wanted, for there was a spare end
  about four feet long."</p>

  <p>"And with regard to the glove that was mentioned&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw that in the front room. The fellow one was on the wash-house
  floor. I picked them both up and I've got them here."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Thorndyke, "how do you suppose the deceased man got
  into the house?"</p>

  <p>"He must have got in by the window. He didn't get in by the front door,
  for Holker is sure he shut it when he left on Sunday and he found it shut
  when he went there on Monday morning. Of course, the lock is only a cheap
  builder's night-latch that anyone used to locks could open easily enough. But
  I don't suppose the deceased gentleman was accustomed to picking locks; and
  he didn't open it with a key because he hadn't a key of any sort about
  him."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose," Thorndyke remarked, "that he was much accustomed to
  getting in at windows."</p>

  <p>"Probably not," the officer agreed. "But, you see, sir, he got in somehow;
  and Holker found the sitting-room window unfastened on the Monday morning. So
  it would have been easy enough for anyone to get in. The window-sill is only
  about two feet six above the ground. And you remember that the one glove was
  lying on the sitting-room floor. As a matter of fact, it was just under the
  window."</p>

  <p>There was silence for a few moments. Then Brodribb remarked: "The officer
  from Scotland Yard mentioned that the body had been identified by some
  letters that were found in the pockets. I suppose there were some other
  things?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but mighty few considering the man's position; and yet enough to
  show that the body had not been robbed. I've got the things here if you would
  like to see them."</p>

  <p>He stepped over to a nest of drawers which stood on a massive shelf, and,
  unlocking one of the drawers, drew it out bodily and brought it over to the
  table at which we were sitting. "There's the collection," said he. "It isn't
  quite what you'd expect to find on the person of a baronet. Look at that
  watch, for instance. Sort of thing that you could pick up at a cheap
  jeweller's for seven and six. What is rather odd, too, is that there are no
  keys. Not even a latch-key."</p>

  <p>"He left his keys and his gold watch and some other valuables at his
  club," said Brodribb as he ran a gloomy eye over the contents of the
  drawer.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Did he? Yes, very natural and very proper, too, having regard to what
  he intended to do. I'll make a note of that. It will be an important point
  for the coroner."</p>

  <p>Brodribb was evidently sorry that he had spoken, but he did not lose his
  presence of mind. "Yes," he agreed. "The secretary of the club, Mr.
  Northbrook, will be able to tell you about it. I suppose you will have to
  summon him as a witness as Sir Edward was staying at the club."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we shall want his evidence, and in fact, a summons has been served
  on him," the Superintendent replied, adding with a faint smile, "I take it
  that you'd rather not be called. But I'm afraid it can't be helped. You know
  more about his private and financial affairs than anybody else. The butler
  has been summoned, but he can't tell us what state the deceased's affairs
  were in, whereas you can give any information that is wanted. My sergeant,
  here, is the coroner's officer and he will hand you the summons when he takes
  you over to the mortuary."</p>

  <p>"Do you really think it necessary for me to go there?" Mr. Brodribb
  protested with evident discomfort. "The butler will be able to testify to the
  identity."</p>

  <p>"Yes," the officer agreed, "that is so. But for our own information, now,
  we should like to know whether this is or is not Sir Edward's body. You had
  better run over and just take a glance at it."</p>

  <p>Brodribb acquiesced with a faint groan and the Superintendent then
  reverted to the contents of the drawer. "Do you recognise any of these
  articles?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Brodribb looked them over once again before replying. They comprised the
  watch, a pair of wash-leather gloves, a shabby leather
  cigar-case&mdash;empty&mdash;a small silver match-box, an old and well-worn
  pigskin purse, containing, as the officer demonstrated, three sovereigns, a
  handkerchief marked E. H., a lead pencil, a fountain-pen, a small
  pocket-knife, some loose silver and coppers and a letter-case, containing two
  five-pound notes and one or two letters in envelopes, addressed to "Sir
  Edward Hardcastle, Bart., Bradstow, Kent."</p>

  <p>"No," Brodribb replied, at length. "I don't recognise any of these things.
  The handkerchief is marked with Sir Edward's initials, as you can see; and
  the envelopes bear his name and address, as you can also see. That is all.
  Would you like me to look through the letters?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need," the officer replied. "The coroner will read them and
  he will ask you anything that he wants to know about them. And now you would
  like to step across to the mortuary? I will tell the sergeant to take you
  over."</p>

  <p>He rose, and, having replaced the drawer in its nest, passed through into
  an adjoining office and returned almost immediately accompanied by his
  subordinate, who bore in his hand a small blue paper.</p>

  <p>"Here," said the Superintendent, "is your summons, Mr. Brodribb. Is there
  anything else that I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>"There is one little matter, Superintendent," said Thorndyke. "I should
  like, if possible, to have an opportunity to inspect the house in which the
  body was found. I presume there is no objection?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," was the reply. "But you are not thinking of going there
  to-night? Better go to-morrow morning by daylight, before you attend at the
  post mortem. I'll see that there is someone to show you the place and let you
  in, and then we can tell you what time to turn up at the mortuary. But you'll
  waste your time at the house, for there is nothing to see but the end of a
  cut rope and an overturned chair."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "we will inspect them. It is a mere formality, but
  it is a good rule to see everything."</p>

  <p>"So it is, sir," the Superintendent agreed; and with this he glanced at
  the sergeant, who forthwith opened the door and launched us into the street,
  the gathering darkness of which was tempered by the light of the lamp over
  the doorway.</p>

  <p>"A pleasant night, gentlemen," he remarked as he led us across the road;
  "a trifle warm, perhaps, but that is seasonable, though for my part, I prefer
  rather cooler weather for mortuary jobs."</p>

  <p>At this, Mr. Brodribb shuddered audibly, and, as I observed that he had
  taken Thorndyke's arm, I suddenly realised that what was for me and my
  colleague a matter of mere daily routine was to our poor old friend a really
  distressing and horrible experience. Evidently, Thorndyke had realised it
  too, for when the sergeant had unlocked a door at the bottom of a narrow
  alley and entered before us to light the gas, I heard him say in a low tone:
  "I'll go in first, Brodribb. You had better wait here till I call you."</p>

  <p>The light from the large, shaded gas-lamps shone down brightly on the
  shrouded figure that lay on the central table and lit more dimly and fitfully
  the side benches, the great porcelain sink and the white washed walls.
  Thorndyke and I, with the sergeant, advanced to the table and the latter drew
  back the sheet, exposing the head and shoulders of the corpse. It was not a
  pleasant spectacle, but, still, immeasurably less repulsive than I had
  expected from my experiences of the "found drowned" corpses that I had seen
  in riverside mortuaries; and what was more to the point, it appeared to be
  quite recognisable. For a few seconds we stood looking down at the shrunken,
  discoloured face. Then Thorndyke drew up the sheet and having arranged it so
  that the face alone was visible, called out to Brodribb; who thereupon
  entered, walking quickly and a little unsteadily, and stepped up to the table
  by Thorndyke's side.</p>

  <p>A single horrified glance apparently disposed of any doubts or hopes that
  he may have entertained, for he turned away quickly, muttering, "Dear Lord!
  What an end!" and began to walk towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Can you identify the body, sir?" the sergeant asked in matter-of-fact
  tones.</p>

  <p>"I can," replied Brodribb, relapsing, despite his agitation, into legal
  precision. "The body is that of Sir Edward Hardcastle of Bradstow in Kent";
  and having made his statement, he walked out into the dark alley.</p>

  <p>We followed almost immediately, for there was nothing to see that would
  not be better seen by daylight on the morrow. At the top of the alley we
  wished the sergeant "good night" and while he hurried away in the direction
  of the office, we turned our steps towards the station.</p>

  <p>During the short walk, hardly a word was spoken. Brodribb strode forward
  with his chin on his breast and his gaze bent on the ground, absorbed in
  gloomy reflections, while Thorndyke and I silently turned over in our minds
  the significance of what we had seen and heard. It was not until we were
  seated in a first-class carriage&mdash;of which we were the only
  occupants&mdash;that our friend came out of his "brown study." Then, as the
  train moved out of the station, he turned to my colleague and asked abruptly:
  "Well, Thorndyke; what do you think of it?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke considered a few moments before replying. "It is early," he
  said, at length, "to express, or even to form an opinion. At present, we have
  no technical data. All that we can do is to form a provisional opinion based
  on the facts now known to us. That you can do as well as Jervis and I
  can."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Brodribb. "All the same, I should like to hear what the
  facts convey to you."</p>

  <p>"Then I may say," Thorndyke responded, "that they convey to me principally
  the urgent necessity of getting more facts. At present we are confronted by
  two sets of conflicting probabilities, and we await further facts to throw
  greater weight on the one or the other. For instance, the mode of death is
  markedly characteristic of suicide. When a man is found hanging, the
  probability is that he has hanged himself. The possible alternatives are
  accident and homicide. Accidental hanging is rare and is usually obvious on
  inspection. Homicidal hanging is extremely rare. So that the mode of death,
  in the absence of any elucidatory evidence, establishes a strong presumption
  of suicide. Evidence of motive or intention would turn that presumption into
  something approaching certainty. Absence of such motive would reduce the
  probability; but the presumption would remain. At present we have no evidence
  of motive or intention."</p>

  <p>"You are not forgetting that he emptied his pockets of all valuables?"
  Brodribb objected.</p>

  <p>"No, I am not. The exact significance of that proceeding is not obvious
  but it does not appear to me to indicate an intention to commit suicide."</p>

  <p>"Does it not? Do you not find a certain congruity between that action and
  the place and circumstances in which the body was found?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly I do," replied Thorndyke. "But the place and circumstances
  have no natural connection with suicide. That is what I mean by conflicting
  probabilities. If Sir Edward had been found hanging from a peg in his bedroom
  the ordinary presumption of suicide would have existed, because suicides
  commonly act in that way. But here we have a man making preparations (as it
  appears to me) to go into some place where property on the person is not safe
  and being later found dead in a remote part of the town which we should
  suppose to be quite unknown to him. The circumstances are so abnormal and the
  conduct so strikingly unlike the usual conduct of suicides that the ordinary
  presumption based on the mode of death cannot be accepted."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Brodribb, "what is it that you are suggesting?"</p>

  <p>"At present, I am suggesting nothing excepting that I am not prepared to
  accept the Superintendent's account at its face value. Beyond that it is
  useless to go until we have heard what transpires at the inquest."</p>

  <p>Brodribb nodded gravely. "Yes," he agreed. "Discussion at this stage is
  merely academic. But probably the evidence at the inquest will clear matters
  up. I suppose the post-mortem will settle the question of suicide?"</p>

  <p>"It may," Thorndyke replied, guardedly, "in a negative sense, by showing
  the absence of any alternative suggestion. But the conditions are not
  favourable for forming positive and definite opinions as to the exact
  circumstances in which death occurred."</p>

  <p>"Well, you will be there, so, if it is possible to establish the fact of
  suicide&mdash;or to exclude it&mdash;by an examination of the body, we may
  say that the question will be decided to-morrow."</p>

  <p>To this statement Thorndyke made no rejoinder; and as Brodribb relapsed
  into silent meditation and my colleague showed no inclination for further
  discussion, I followed their example, and, as I smoked my pipe, turned the
  situation over in my mind.</p>

  <p>In the colloquy to which I had listened, two things had impressed me
  rather forcibly. For the first time in my experience of him, Brodribb had
  appeared unprepared to defer to Thorndyke's judgement. It was evident that in
  his opinion the suicide of Sir Edward was virtually an established fact, and
  that in his view Thorndyke's scepticism was merely a manifestation of the
  specialist's tendency to see things through the medium of his own specialty.
  On the other hand it had struck me that Thorndyke had made little effort to
  influence his opinion. He had, it is true, fairly answered Brodribb's
  questions; but it was quite obvious to me that he had not put the case
  against suicide with nearly the force that was possible even with the few
  facts that we had. This might have been due to his habit of avoiding anything
  like premature conclusions, but I had the feeling that he was not unwilling
  that Brodribb should continue to take the case, as he had expressed it, at
  its face value.</p>

  <p>At the terminus we separated, Brodribb setting forth alone in a hansom
  while Thorndyke and I decided to restore our circulations by a brisk walk
  homewards through the city streets on which the quiet and repose of evening
  had now descended. Having seen Brodribb fairly launched, we turned out of the
  station, and, crossing Liverpool Street, started at a swinging pace up New
  Broad Street. For a minute or two we walked on in silence while I debated
  inwardly whether or not I should propound my views to Thorndyke. Finally
  deciding in the affirmative, I began, cautiously: "Brodribb appears to me to
  have made up his mind definitely on this case. He seems quite convinced that
  Sir Edward hanged himself."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was what I gathered from his remarks on the case."</p>

  <p>"I wonder why. He is a lawyer, and a pretty shrewd one, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes; but not a criminal lawyer. His experience is all on the civil side
  and principally in relation to property. Still, he may have reasons for his
  views of the affair which he has not disclosed. He knew Sir Edward pretty
  intimately and he knows all about the family. There may be some highly
  pertinent facts connected with the dead man's personality and the family
  history which we know nothing about. I take it that you don't agree with
  Brodribb?"</p>

  <p>"I do not; and neither, I suspect, do you."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, Jervis. I do not. But we must not allow ourselves to
  come to any sort of conclusion before we have seen and heard the evidence. We
  must try to approach to-morrow's investigation with a perfectly open mind,
  and I am not sure that we ought to be discussing it now."</p>

  <p>"There is no harm," said I, "in just going over the ground&mdash;without
  prejudice."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," he agreed; "and since my learned friend seems to have
  arrived at certain provisional conclusions, it would be interesting to hear
  his exposition of the case as it presents itself to him."</p>

  <p>I reflected for a few moments, trying to arrange my ideas in an orderly
  sequence. At length I began: "Taking the points for and against the theory of
  suicide in this case, I know of only one in favour of it; the one that you
  mentioned&mdash;that unofficial hanging is usually suicidal. On the other
  hand, there are several reasons against it.</p>

  <p>"First, there is the fact that he came to London. Why should he, if he had
  been intending to commit suicide? The natural thing, according to precedent,
  would have been to hang himself in his own bedroom or in a garret."</p>

  <p>"There are precedents of the opposite kind, though," objected Thorndyke.
  "I recall a case of a lady who poisoned herself in a very secluded wood on a
  common or in a park near London and whose body was not discovered for some
  months. Still, I agree that the probabilities are with you. What is the next
  point?"</p>

  <p>"It is the fact that he unloaded his pockets of all valuables before he
  set out from the club. Why did he do that? If it is suggested that it was to
  provide against the chance that his body might be robbed, the obvious answer
  is that he could have avoided that possibility by committing suicide on his
  own premises. And the way in which the things were hidden under his shirts
  strongly suggests an intention to return and recover them. By Brodribb this
  incident seems to have been accepted as proof of an intention to commit
  suicide; but to me it has quite the opposite significance. Your own
  suggestion, made at the time, that he was expecting to go to some place and
  among some people where he might expect to be robbed, seems to meet the case
  perfectly; and Brodribb's suggestion that where property on the person is not
  safe, the person is probably also in some danger seems to receive
  corroboration. You and Brodribb suggest in advance the possibility of his
  being exposed to danger of personal violence, and the next thing that happens
  is that he is found dead, having admittedly died a violent death."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded approvingly. "Yes," he admitted, "I think that is quite
  fairly argued."</p>

  <p>"The next point," I continued, "is the place in which the body was found.
  It is an empty house in an obscure and remote part of a region which is quite
  unknown to the immense majority of Londoners and almost certainly unknown to
  the deceased. How on earth did he get there and what could have been his
  object in going there? He could hardly have strayed thither by chance, for
  the place is difficult of access and right off the track to any more likely
  locality. On the other hand, the choice of this particular house suggests
  some local knowledge&mdash;knowledge of the existence of that desolate row of
  houses and of the fact that they were all uninhabited and likely to be left
  undisturbed and unexamined for months. The whole set of circumstances seems
  to me profoundly suspicious."</p>

  <p>"There I am entirely with you," said Thorndyke. "That empty house on the
  edge of no-man's-land wants a deal of explaining."</p>

  <p>"Then," I resumed, "there is that new, cheap watch, evidently bought as a
  substitute for the watch that he had left at the club. The purchase of that
  watch seems to me utterly to exclude the state of mind of a man intending
  immediately to commit suicide. Then, finally, there is a point which,
  strangely enough, seems to have been overlooked by Brodribb&mdash;the seal.
  That seems to me the most suspicious of all the elements in the case. The
  sealed letter was posted on the Saturday, but we have evidence that the
  hanging could not have occurred before Sunday night at the earliest. Now, it
  is fair to assume that the letter was not sealed by Sir Edward."</p>

  <p>"It is extremely unlikely," Thorndyke interposed, "but we can't say that
  it is impossible. And if we accept the hypothesis of suicide, it is not even
  very improbable. It might be suggested that Sir Edward adopted that method of
  announcing his death. But I may say that I agree with you in assuming that
  the letter was almost certainly sealed and posted by some other person."</p>

  <p>"Then, in that case, Sir Edward's signet ring must have been in the
  possession of some other person at least twenty-four hours before the
  earliest moment at which he could have hanged himself in the empty house.
  That is a very remarkable and significant fact."</p>

  <p>"Has it occurred to you, Jervis," Thorndyke asked, "that Sir Edward might
  have been wearing his ring that day, or some other day after he left the
  club, and that it might have slipped off his finger and been picked up by
  some chance stranger? We have been told that it was a very loose fit."</p>

  <p>"That did occur to me," I replied, "but I think we must reject that
  explanation. You remember that Sir Edward usually carried the ring in a
  little leather case or bag in his pocket. Now, if he had lost the ring off
  his finger, the empty case would have been in his pocket. But apparently it
  was not. I looked for it carefully among the things in the drawer that the
  Superintendent showed us and it was not there. And it could hardly have been
  overlooked in a careful search of the pockets."</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed, "I think we may take it that the case was not
  there, though we shall have to verify its absence, since, as you say, the
  point is an important one and opens up some very curious possibilities. But
  here we are at our journey's end. Your masterly summing-up of the evidence
  has made the miles slip by unnoticed. I must compliment you on the
  completeness of your survey. And we shall be none the worse for having gone
  over the ground in advance, provided that we approach the actual
  investigation to-morrow without prejudice or any expectation as to what we
  are likely to discover."</p>

  <p>As he concluded, we turned in at our entry and mounted the stairs to our
  landing. The door of our chambers was open, giving us a view of the lighted
  room, in which Polton was adding a few final touches to the supper table.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-07"
     id="ch-07"></a>VII. &mdash; NUMBER FIVE PIPER'S ROW</h2>

  <h3>(DR. JERVIS'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">FROM my long association with Thorndyke, I was often able to
  deduce something of his state of mind and his intentions from observation of
  his actions. Particularly interesting was it to me to watch him (as
  unobtrusively as possible) packing his green canvas "research case" in
  preparation for some investigation, for, by noting carefully the appliances
  and materials with which he provided himself, I could form a pretty clear
  idea as to the points that he thought it necessary to elucidate.</p>

  <p>Thus, on the morning on which we were to set forth for our second visit to
  Stratford, I stood by with an attentive eye on his proceedings as he put into
  the case the various articles which he thought might be needed. I was
  specially interested on this occasion because, while I viewed the case with
  the deepest suspicion, I could think of no method of attack on the
  undoubtedly plausible prima facie appearances. Possibly Thorndyke was in the
  same position; but one thing became clear to me as I watched him. He was
  taking nothing for granted. As I observed him putting into the case the
  chemically clean bottles with stoppers prepared for sealing, I realised that
  he was prepared for signs that might call for an analysis. The little
  portable microscope and the box of blank-labelled slides, the insufflator, or
  powder-spray, the miniature camera and telescopic tripod, the surveyor's tape
  and small electric lamp, each indicated certain points which were to be
  subjected to exact tests and measurements, and the rubber gloves and case of
  post-mortem instruments showed that he contemplated taking an active part in
  the actual necropsy if the opportunity should present itself. The whole
  outfit suggested his habitual state of mind. Nothing was to be taken on
  trust. The one undoubted fact was that Sir Edward Hardcastle was dead. Beyond
  that Thorndyke would accept no suggestion. He was going to begin at the
  beginning as if no cause of death had been hinted at.</p>

  <p>One item of the outfit did certainly puzzle me considerably&mdash;a box of
  keys from Polton's rather doubtfully legal collection. The fact is that our
  worthy laboratory assistant held somewhat obscure views on certain aspects of
  the law; but on one subject he was perfectly clear. Whatever legal
  restrictions or obligations might apply to common persons, they had no
  application to "The Doctor." In his view, his revered employer was above the
  law. Thus, in the assumed interests of that employer, Polton had amassed a
  collection of keys that would have been enough to bring a "common person"
  within hail of penal servitude, and a portion of his illegal hoard I now saw
  going into the research case. I examined them with profoundly speculative
  eyes. The collection included a number of common latch-keys, a graded set of
  blanks (how on earth had Polton managed to acquire those blanks, so strictly
  forbidden by the law?) and a bunch of skeleton keys of the pipe variety,
  simple in construction but undeniably felonious in aspect.</p>

  <p>I asked no questions concerning those keys, reserving to myself the
  prospective entertainment of seeing them produced and put to their mysterious
  use; as to which I could form no sort of surmise. They were certainly not to
  let us into the house, for we had already been promised free admittance. But
  it was useless to speculate. The explanation would come all in good time, and
  now the research case, having received its lading, was closed and fastened
  and we were due to start.</p>

  <p>At Stratford, we found the Superintendent ready to receive us and in the
  same helpful spirit as on the preceding day.</p>

  <p>"You are full early, gentlemen," he remarked, "as matters stand. The
  inquest opens, as you know, at four p.m., and the doctor has fixed two p.m.
  for the post-mortem. So you'll have plenty of time to survey the 'scene of
  the tragedy,' as the newspapers call it, though I don't fancy that you'll
  spend your time very profitably. However, that's your affair. You are acting
  for the executor, as I understand, so I suppose you have got to make a show
  of doing something."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Thorndyke agreed. "A specialist must make a demonstration of
  some kind. You gave my letter to the coroner?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. And it is just as well that you had it. Otherwise I don't fancy
  you'd have got many facilities. He's rather a touchy man and he seemed
  disposed to resent your coming here to hold what he calls 'an unofficial
  inquiry of your own.' However, it is all right. I am to let you see anything
  that you want to see, and the medical witness&mdash;he is the police
  surgeon's deputy&mdash;has got the same instructions. And now I expect you
  would like to start. I've got the key here, but I can't give it to you in
  case the coroner wants to inspect the place himself. Besides, you'll want
  someone to show you where it is."</p>

  <p>He stepped to the door, and, looking into the adjoining office, called
  out: "Marshall, just take these two gentlemen down to number five Piper's
  Row. You needn't stay. Just let them into the house and bring the key back to
  me."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he produced from the nest of drawers a key with a wooden
  label attached to it which he handed to the constable; and I noticed that, as
  it passed from hand to hand, Thorndyke bestowed a quick glance on it, and I
  suspected that he was memorising its shape and size. It was, however, but a
  momentary glance, for the key disappeared immediately into the constabulary
  pocket and the officer, with a salute to his superior, turned and led the way
  out into the street.</p>

  <p>The town of Stratford is not strikingly prepossessing in any part. There
  is nothing of the residential suburb about it. But the district to which we
  were conducted by Constable Marshall seemed to reach the very limit of what
  is attainable in the way of repulsive squalor by the most advanced
  developments of modern industry. Turning out of the High Street by Abbey
  Lane, we presently emerged from the inhabited areas on to a dreary expanse of
  marsh, on which a few anaemic weeds struggled to grow in the interstices of
  the rubbish that littered every open space. Gas works, chemical works,
  pumping stations and various large buildings of the mill or factory type
  arose on all sides, each accompanied by its group of tall chimney-shafts, all
  belching forth smoke and each diffusing the particular stench appropriate to
  the industry that it represented. A few rough roads, like urbanised cart
  tracks, flanked by drainage ditches, meandered across this region, and along
  one of these we picked our way until it brought us to the place where, as the
  Superintendent bluntly but justly expressed it, "some fool had built" Piper's
  Row.</p>

  <p>"Not much to look at, are they, sir?" Constable Marshall remarked in
  comment on our disparaging glances at the unspeakably sordid, ruinous little
  hovels. "Mr. Holker bought them for a song, but I fancy he's going to lose
  his money all the same. This is the one."</p>

  <p>He halted at a decaying door bearing the number 5, fished the key out of
  his pocket, inserted it, gave it a turn and pushed the door open. Then, as we
  entered, he withdrew the key, wished us "good morning," closed the door and
  took his departure.</p>

  <p>For some moments Thorndyke stood looking about the tiny room&mdash;for
  there was no hall, the sitting-room opening directly on the
  street&mdash;letting his eye travel over its scanty details; the rusty grate,
  the little cupboard in the recess, the small, low window and especially the
  floor. He stepped across and tried the door of the cupboard, and, finding it
  locked, remarked that Holker had probably used it to stow away his tools.</p>

  <p>"You notice, Jervis," he added, "that the appearance of the floor does not
  seem to support the theory that the house was entered by the window. There
  are foot-marks under the window, certainly, but they are quite faint, whereas
  there are well-marked prints of muddy feet, two pairs at least, leading from
  the street door to the next room, which I suppose is the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that," I replied; "but as we don't know whose foot-prints they
  are or when they were made, the observation doesn't carry us very far."</p>

  <p>"Still," he rejoined, "we note their existence and observe that they
  proceed, getting rapidly fainter, direct to the kitchen."</p>

  <p>He passed through the open doorway, still narrowly examining the floor,
  and halted in the kitchen to look round. But, beyond the faint marks on the
  floor, there was nothing to attract notice, and, after a brief inspection, we
  went on to the wash-house, which was what we had actually come to see.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the place had been left in the condition in which it had been
  found by Holker, for the decrepit Windsor chair still lay on its side, while
  almost directly above it a length of thinnish brown rope hung down from a
  short beam that connected the principal pair of rafters. At this Thorndyke,
  when he had finished his scrutiny of the floor, looked with an expression of
  interest that it hardly seemed to warrant.</p>

  <p>"The Superintendent," he remarked, "spoke of a tie beam. It is only a
  matter of terminology, but this is rather what architects would call a collar
  beam. But the fact is of some interest. A tie beam, in a building of this
  size, would be within comfortable reach of a short man. But this beam is
  fully eight feet above the floor. Even with the aid of the chair, it is not
  so very accessible."</p>

  <p>"No. But the rope could have been thrown over and pulled taut after the
  knot was tied. It is made fast with a fisherman's bend, which would run up
  close when the rope was hauled on."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed, "that is so. And, by the way, the character of the knot
  is worth noting. There is something rather distinctive about a fisherman's
  bend."</p>

  <p>He stood looking up thoughtfully at the knot, from which a long end hung
  down beside the 'standing part', which had been cut, as if the rope had been
  longer than was necessary for the purpose. Then he took the cut end in his
  hand and examined it minutely, first with the naked eye and then with the aid
  of a pocket lens. Finally, slipping on a glove, he picked up the chair, and,
  mounting on it, began deliberately to untie the knot.</p>

  <p>"Is that quite in order, Thorndyke?" I protested. "We had permission to
  inspect the premises, but I don't think we were expected to disturb
  anything."</p>

  <p>"We are not going to disturb anything in any essential sense," he replied.
  "When we have finished, we shall re-tie the knot and put the chair as we
  found it. That will be good enough for the coroner's jury. You might give me
  the tape out of the case."</p>

  <p>I opened the case and took out the long tape, which I handed to him and
  watched him as he carefully measured the rope and entered the length in his
  note book. It seemed an unaccountable proceeding, but I made no comment until
  he had re-fastened the rope and stepped down from the chair. Then I ventured
  to remark: "I should like to know why you measured that rope, Thorndyke. It
  seems to me that its length can have no possible bearing on anything
  connected with the case that we are investigating. Evidently I am wrong."</p>

  <p>"When we are collecting facts," he replied, "especially when we are
  absolutely in the dark, we are not bound to consider their relevancy in
  advance. The length of this rope is a fact and that fact might acquire later
  some relevancy which it does not appear to have now. There is no harm in
  noting irrelevant facts, but a great deal of harm in leaving any fact
  unnoted. That is a general rule. But in this case there is a reason for
  ascertaining and recording the length of this piece of rope. Look at it
  attentively and see what information it yields."</p>

  <p>I glared at the rope with concentrated attention, but all the information
  that it yielded to me was that it was a piece of rope.</p>

  <p>"I am looking at it attentively," I said, doggedly, "and what I see is a
  length&mdash;about a fathom and a half&mdash;of thinnish coir rope, the
  thinnest coir rope, I think, that I have ever seen. It is made fast at the
  end with a fisherman's bend and the other part has been cut."</p>

  <p>"Why 'the other part'? I mean what is the distinction?</p>

  <p>"It is obvious," I replied. "The end proper has got the whipping on
  it."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Thorndyke. "That is the point. Incidentally, it is not a
  coir rope. It is a hemp rope dyed, apparently with cutch. But that is a
  detail, though a significant one. The chief point is that the end is whipped.
  A rope with cut ends is a rope of no determinate length. It is simply a piece
  of rope. But a rope with whipped ends has a determinate length. It is a
  definite entity. It may be a boat's painter, a sheet, a halyard, a waterman's
  towing-rope; in any case it is a thing, not a part of a thing. Here we have a
  piece of rope with a whipping at one end. We haven't seen the other part. But
  we know that when it was complete it was whipped at both ends. And we know
  that, somewhere, there is a counterpart to this fragment and that the two
  together make up a known length."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "there is no denying the truth of what you have said, but
  it is a mere exposition of theory. Undoubtedly there does exist a piece of
  rope which is the complement to this piece. But as we have no idea where it
  is and there is not the remotest chance that we shall ever meet with it, or
  that we should recognise it if we did, your measurement is a mere
  demonstration of a principle without any utility what ever."</p>

  <p>"Our chance of meeting with that complementary portion is small enough, I
  must admit," said Thorndyke, "but it is not so infinitesimal as you think.
  There are some points which you have overlooked; and I think you have not
  fully taken in the immense importance of tracing the origin of this rope. But
  we must not waste time in discussion. This chair is the next subject for
  investigation. On the hypothesis that Sir Edward hanged himself, there should
  be prints of his fingers on some part of it; and if he did not, then there
  should be prints of the fingers of some other person."</p>

  <p>"I think we can take it that there will be plenty of finger-prints on it,"
  said I, "if they are not too old to develop. The latest must be at least
  three weeks old."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is rather a poor chance, but we will try our luck."</p>

  <p>He opened the research case and brought out the insufflator with one of
  the powder containers which was filled with a pure white powder. Having
  fitted the container to the spray-producer, he placed the chair where the
  light fell on the front aspect of it and began to work the bellows, keeping
  at some distance from the chair, so that the cloud of white powder met the
  surface quite gently. Very soon the whole of the front of the chair became
  covered with a thin, uniform coating of the impalpably fine white dust. Then
  the chair was turned about by pushing and pulling the lower parts of the legs
  and the other aspect coated with powder. When this process was completed
  Thorndyke proceeded to tap each of the legs very lightly and quickly with the
  handle of a large pocket-knife. At once, in response to the faint jarring
  strokes, the white dust began to creep down the perpendicular surfaces, and
  in a few seconds there came into view a number of rounded, smeary shapes on
  the broad, flat top rail of the chair-back. Still, as the light, quick
  tapping went on, the powder continued to creep down, leaving the shapes more
  and more conspicuous and distinct. Finally, Thorndyke transferred his
  operations to the top of the chair-back, gradually increasing the force of
  his blows until practically the whole of the powder had been jarred off,
  leaving the shapes&mdash;now unmistakable finger-prints&mdash;standing out
  strongly against the dingy, varnished surface.</p>

  <p>"Not a very promising lot," Thorndyke commented, after a preliminary
  inspection. "Several hopeless smears and several more super-imposed. Those
  won't be much use even to the experts."</p>

  <p>With the aid of his pocket lens, he made a more critical survey of the one
  side while I examined the other, reinforcing the feeble light with the
  electric lamp.</p>

  <p>"They are a very confused lot," I remarked. "The trouble is that there are
  too many of them on top of one another. Still, there are several that show a
  distinguishable pattern. I should think the finger print experts will be able
  to make something of them."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "I think so. It is surprising to see what
  shockingly bad prints they manage to decipher. At any rate, we will give them
  a chance."</p>

  <p>Between us, we got out the little camera, mounted it on its tripod and
  placed it in position by means of its wire sighting frame. Having measured
  the distance with the tape and set the focusing-scale, Thorndyke stopped the
  lens down to F. 16, and, taking out his watch, gave the long exposure that
  was demanded by the weak light and the small stop. Then, when, as a measure
  of safety, he had made a second exposure, we turned the chair round and
  repeated the operation on the opposite side.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to leave the powder on the chair?" I asked as we re-packed
  the camera.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "The police have had their opportunity. Perhaps they
  have taken it. At any rate it will be best for us to keep our own counsel as
  to our private investigations. And the photographs will be available if they
  are wanted."</p>

  <p>With this he carefully dusted away all traces of the powder and when he
  had laid the chair in the place and position in which we had found it, he
  picked up the research case and we went back to the front room.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, moving towards the door, "I think we have seen everything
  here and we have picked up one or two crumbs&mdash;pretty small ones as far
  as I am concerned. But perhaps there is something else that you want to
  see?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "there are two more points that we ought to consider
  before we go. First there are those wheel-ruts. You noticed them, I
  suppose?</p>

  <p>"I observed some ruts in the road as we came along. Deuced uncomfortable
  they were to a man with thin shoes. But what about them?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently you did not notice them," said he, "excepting as a source of
  physical discomfort. Come out now and take a careful look at them."</p>

  <p>He opened the street door and we stepped out on to the strip of rough
  ground that served as the footpath or 'side-walk'. The unmade road that
  passed the houses was bumpy with obscure impressions of feet that had trodden
  it when the surface was moist and there were faint suggestions of old ruts.
  But in addition to these was a pair of deep, sharply-defined ruts with clear
  hoof-marks between, which I now remembered having seen as we came out of
  Abbey Lane.</p>

  <p>"I can't quite make up my mind as to the class of vehicle," he said. "What
  do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>"A two-wheeled cart of some kind," I suggested. "A largish one, to judge
  by the space between the ruts."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is rather wide for a light cart. My provisional diagnosis was a
  good-sized gig or dog-cart&mdash;more probably a gig. It was evidently a
  light, high vehicle, as we can tell by the narrowness of the rims and the
  large diameter of the wheels."</p>

  <p>"I can see that the rims were narrow, but I don't see how you arrive at
  the diameter of the wheels."</p>

  <p>"It happens," he explained, "to be quite easy in this case. There is a
  notch in the edge of the near tyre; rather a surprising feature if you
  consider the strength of an iron tyre. It must have been caused by striking a
  sharp angle of granite or iron at some corner."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought," said I, "that a blow that would notch the tyre
  would have broken the wheel."</p>

  <p>"So should I." he agreed. "However, there it is, and it leaves a small,
  triangular projection at the side of the rut; and of course, the distance
  between two such projections is the circumference of the wheel. We may as
  well measure that distance, and the width between the two tracks and the
  width of the rims. Fortunately, there is no one here to spy on us."</p>

  <p>I looked round as I unfastened the research case and handed out the tape.
  There was not a human creature in sight. Piper's Row might as well have been
  in the midst of the Sahara.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the solitude, we went out on to the road and made the
  three measurements at our ease; and as I held one end of the tape while
  Thorndyke stretched it and took the reading, I speculated vaguely as to the
  object of the proceeding.</p>

  <p>"The tyres are one inch and a half wide," he reported as he put away his
  note-book, "the width between the outside edges of the tyre-marks is
  fifty-seven inches and the circumference of the wheels is thirteen feet ten
  inches. That makes the diameter about four feet seven and a half, that is
  fifty-five and a half inches.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed without much enthusiasm, "that will be about right. But
  why are we taking all this trouble? Is there anything particularly
  interesting about this cart?</p>

  <p>"The interest attaching to this cart," he replied, "lies in the fact that
  it stopped at number five Piper's Row."</p>

  <p>"The deuce it did!" I exclaimed. "That is rather remarkable, seeing that
  Number Five is an empty house."</p>

  <p>"Very remarkable," he agreed. "It was quite a short halt," he continued,
  "unless the horse was more than usually patient. But there is no doubt about
  it. You can see where the tracks swerve in slightly towards the house. Then
  there is the spot where the ruts lose their regularity and broaden out
  somewhat, and there is quite plainly the re-duplication of the hoof-marks
  where the horse has trodden two or three times in nearly the same place. That
  could have happened only when the cart was stationary."</p>

  <p>I was still looking down at the impressions to verify his statements when
  I was aroused by the slamming of a door. I looked up quickly and saw that a
  gust of wind had caught the door of Number Five and shut us out.</p>

  <p>"Well, Thorndyke," I remarked with a faint grin, "that seems to put the
  stopper on that further point that you were going to elucidate."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he retorted. "I would say rather that it introduces it in a
  particularly opportune way. Do you mind opening the research case?"</p>

  <p>I did so; and when he had replaced the tape in its compartment, he took
  out the box of keys which had so stimulated my curiosity. Opening it, he
  extracted the bunch of skeleton keys, and, glancing from them to the keyhole,
  he deliberately selected one and inserted it. It entered quite easily and
  when he gave it a turn and a slight push, the door opened and we walked
  in.</p>

  <p>"You see, Jervis," he said, withdrawing it from the keyhole and holding it
  out to me, "here is a perfectly elementary skeleton key, made by simply
  cutting away the whole of the bit excepting the top and the bolt edge. I
  selected it with Constable Marshall's key in my mind."</p>

  <p>"That was a ward key, I think?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it had three vertical slits in the bit, which ostensibly
  corresponded to three concentric wards in the lock."</p>

  <p>"Why 'ostensibly'?"</p>

  <p>"Because I suspect that they are not there. But in selecting the skeleton
  key I assumed that they were there, and you saw the result. Also you see the
  weakness of a ward lock. The wards are obstructions placed in the path of the
  key. The key which fits a particular lock has slits corresponding to the
  wards, so that it can turn and let the wards pass through. But it isn't
  necessary for the slits to fit the wards. All that is necessary is a hole in
  the key-bit large enough to let it pass the wards. The simplest plan is, as
  in this key, to cut out the whole of the bit excepting the distal
  edge&mdash;which enters the notch, or 'talon' of the bolt and moves
  it&mdash;and the top edge which joins it to the key stem. I am speaking, of
  course, of comparatively simple locks."</p>

  <p>"And you think that this lock hasn't any wards at all?"</p>

  <p>"It is a mere guess based on the generally shoddy appearance of the
  fittings. But we can easily settle the question."</p>

  <p>Once more he opened the key box and this time took out a locksmith's
  'blank', which he compared with the skeleton key. Finding their bits about
  the same width, he tried the blank in the lock. It entered as easily as the
  skeleton had, and when he turned it, it made its circuit in the same manner
  and duly drew in the bolt.</p>

  <p>"That," said Thorndyke, "makes it perfectly clear. This blank could not
  possibly have passed a ward. It follows that this lock contains nothing but a
  spring bolt. Consequently it could be opened by practically any key that
  would enter the keyhole and that was long enough in the bit to reach the
  notch of the bolt."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said I, "if there are no wards, what is the function of
  those slits that you described in the key?"</p>

  <p>"Their function, I take it, is purely commercial&mdash;a matter of
  salesmanship; to produce a certain moral effect on the purchaser. He sees a
  somewhat intricate key and naturally infers a corresponding intricacy in the
  lock. The ethics of commerce are sometimes a little difficult for the
  uncommercial mind to follow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Jove," said I. "That dummy key does seem uncommonly like a fraud.
  But with regard to this lock: it is all very curious and interesting but I
  don't quite see the purpose of these experiments. Obviously they have some
  bearing since you took the trouble to bring that collection of keys."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied as he returned the box to the green canvas case and
  fastened the latter, "they have a bearing. We can discuss it as we walk back
  to the town; and I propose that we follow the tracks of the cart and see
  where it went to. It is bound to go our way, as this area of marsh is
  enclosed on the other three sides by the creeks."</p>

  <p>We went out of the dismal little house, slamming the door behind us, and
  set forth along the rough footway in the direction in which the cart had
  gone. We walked a short distance in silence; then Thorndyke returned to my
  question.</p>

  <p>"The bearing of what we have ascertained about that lock is this; we are
  invited to believe that entrance was effected into the house by the window
  because the door was shut and locked. But the fact, which we have
  established, that the lock is one which can be opened with almost any
  key&mdash;or even with a piece of stiff wire&mdash;makes any such supposition
  unnecessary. The house was accessible to anybody by way of the door."</p>

  <p>"As far as Sir Edward was concerned," said I, "you remember that he had no
  keys on him at all."</p>

  <p>"Yes. And that fact may have influenced the Superintendent. But it doesn't
  influence us. If Sir Edward went into that house of his own free will it is
  of no concern to us whether he got in at the window or climbed down the
  chimney. But if we assume&mdash;as I take it we both do, without prejudice as
  to what may transpire at the inquest&mdash;that he was taken into that house
  forcibly, or in a state of unconsciousness, or actually dead, then the
  facility of access becomes a material fact. For the proceedings would
  necessarily be hurried. There would be no time for the manipulation of
  windows or picking of locks. Entry would have to be effected at once."</p>

  <p>"That means," said I, "that the person or persons who entered knew what
  sort of lock was on the door."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," he agreed. "The house must have been known to at least one
  of the parties, and would, presumably, have been visited and explored. The
  plan must have been arranged and prepared in advance to enable it to be
  carried out quickly."</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose to have been the actual modus operandi?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"From what we have seen, I should reconstruct events somewhat thus: First,
  a scout would come to the place, try the lock and ascertain that a particular
  key would open it, explore the house and select the place where the victim
  could be most conveniently hanged. Then, at the appointed time, the
  victim&mdash;who must almost necessarily have been either dead or
  insensible&mdash;would be put in the cart and covered up; the three
  men&mdash;possibly two, but much more probably three&mdash;would mount to the
  seat and the cart would be driven to the house pretty late at night, so as to
  secure complete darkness.</p>

  <p>"On arriving at Number Five, one man would jump down and open the door.
  The victim and the rope would then be handed down and carried in and the door
  shut. The cart would then be driven off, possibly to wait at some rendezvous
  outside the immediate neighbourhood. The two men, having concluded the
  business, would come out and walk to the rendezvous and the whole party would
  then return whence they came."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "that sounds very complete and consistent. But aren't we
  taking rather a lot for granted? I admit that the stopping of that cart
  opposite Number Five is a highly suspicious circumstance&mdash;and here we
  are, back at Abbey Lane and here are the cart-tracks back with us. So the
  cart must have made the round expressly to call at Number Five, which
  strongly supports your theory. But still, we are assuming that the cart made
  that very suspicious call on that particular night. Of course, it is
  extremely probable that it did; and if it did, it almost certainly conveyed
  Sir Edward, alive or dead. The fatal flaw in the evidence is that we can't
  fix the date on which the cart called at the house."</p>

  <p>"But I think we can, Jervis. One doesn't like to use the word certainty,
  but I think I can fix the date with the very highest degree of
  probability."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, "if you can do that, I accept your hypothetical
  reconstruction as almost certainly representing what actually happened. But I
  should like to hear the evidence."</p>

  <p>"The evidence," he replied, "is based on two factors; one is the state of
  the road when the tracks were made; the other is the time at which the road
  could have been in that particular state. Let us consider factor one.</p>

  <p>"You saw the ruts and the hoof-prints. They were deep and sharp but by no
  means dead sharp. There was a slight blurring of the edges of the
  impressions. The soil of the road was an impure clayey loam. Now, since the
  impressions were deep, the road must have been quite soft; but since the
  impressions were fairly sharp, the mud could not have been liquid or
  diffluent, for liquid or semi-liquid mud does not retain impressions. It
  could not have been raining when the impressions were made, for in the soft
  state of the road, rain would have largely obliterated them. For the same
  reason, no appreciable rain could have fallen after they were made.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, the road could not have dried enough to become plastic
  or semi-solid, or&mdash;on soil of this kind&mdash;the impressions would have
  been dead sharp. So it comes to this: the ruts were made after heavy
  rain&mdash;heavy enough to swamp the road. But there was an interval after
  the rain, long enough to allow the semi-liquid stage to pass off but not long
  enough to allow the mud to pass into the plastic or semi-solid stage.</p>

  <p>"Now let us take the second factor&mdash;the time factor. I need not
  remind you of the long drought that has prevailed this summer. It began, as
  you probably remember, at the very end of May, and it still continues. In
  that drought there has been up to the present only a single break&mdash;a
  single, dramatic break. On Sunday, the twenty-first June, a tremendous storm
  burst over the London area, and for more than an hour the rain fell in
  torrents. The storm clouds came up quite suddenly about half-past four in the
  afternoon and the rain ceased and the clouds rolled away with almost equal
  suddenness about six o'clock. And forthwith the drought resumed its sway. A
  hot, dry easterly wind followed the storm and the pavements dried up as if
  the water on them had been spirit.</p>

  <p>"Now, during that heavy rain, these roads across the marshes must have
  been flooded. For the time being, their surfaces must have been just liquid
  mud. But we must remember that under that liquid mud, only a few inches down,
  was soil baked dry by weeks of drought. Before midnight the surface water
  would have soaked in, bringing the soil to the consistency shown by these
  ruts. By the following morning, or at least by noon, the plastic stage would
  have been reached, while by evening, after a day's hot sunshine and dry wind,
  the surface would have become too firm to yield deep impressions like these
  with their surrounding ridges. As I say, one doesn't like to use the word
  certainty; but I submit that we are justified in assuming with considerable
  confidence that these ruts were made on the night of Sunday, the twenty-first
  of June, probably after ten o'clock."</p>

  <p>"More probably in the small hours of the morning," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"The state of the road would admit of that view," he replied, "but other
  considerations suggest an earlier hour&mdash;say from eleven to half-past. A
  party of men with a dead or insensible man in a cart would not wish to
  attract notice or run the risk of being stopped and questioned. Up to
  midnight they would be pretty safe, but in the small hours a cart prowling
  round an unfrequented neighbourhood or travelling along a road that leads
  nowhere might excite the curiosity of an alert and enterprising policeman.
  However, that is mere surmise and not at present of special interest to us.
  The important point is the date and the approximate time."</p>

  <p>"By the way, Thorndyke," I asked, "how do you manage to remember all these
  details? I recollect the storm, of course, and now that you mention it, I
  think I can corroborate the date and the time. But it is a mystery to me how
  you keep these dates and times in your memory, ready to be produced at a
  moment's notice."</p>

  <p>"The solution of that mystery," he replied, "is quite simple. I don't. I
  keep a diary; a highly condensed affair, but I note in it everything that may
  need to be recalled. And I always enter the state of the weather, having
  learned from experience that it is often a vitally important means of fixing
  the time of other happenings, as in the present case. I looked it up last
  night, principally in connection with the possibility of finding muddy
  foot-prints in the house."</p>

  <p>"After reading me a lecture on the impropriety of discussing the case in
  advance," I said with a grin; "and now you have built up a complete
  reconstruction of the events before we have even seen what the post mortem
  has to tell, to say nothing of the inquest."</p>

  <p>He smiled deprecatingly. "We had no choice, Jervis. We could only observe
  the facts in the order in which they were presented. But, still, I hope we
  shall approach the inquest without prejudice; and it is possible that we may
  get a surprise from the evidence of Brodribb or Weeks, but especially
  Brodribb. I suspect that he has something in his mind that he has not
  disclosed to us."</p>

  <p>"The deuce!" I exclaimed. "You think there may have been reasons for
  anticipating the possibility of suicide? It will be a bit of an anti-climax
  if evidence of that kind is given, for it will knock the bottom out of your
  elaborate reconstruction."</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," he replied; "opinions and expectations are no answer to
  observed facts; and you must not forget, Jervis, that a known intention or
  tendency to commit suicide makes things uncommonly easy for a murderer. But
  it is time that we turned our attention to the subject of food. We are due at
  the mortuary at two o'clock, and it will not be amiss if we get there a few
  minutes before our time. How will this place do?"</p>

  <p>He halted opposite a restaurant of somewhat fly-blown aspect, the fascia
  of which bore an Italian name. In the window, a 'set piece' (consisting of
  two glass dishes of tomatoes flanking the head of a calf, who appeared from
  his complexion to have died of pernicious anaemia) was exhibited to whet the
  appetites of passers-by, while through the open doorway an unctuous odour
  suggestive of thick soup stole forth to mingle with the aroma from an
  adjacent soap-boiler's.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "the soup inside smells better than the soap outside. Let
  us go in." Accordingly we went in.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-08"
     id="ch-08"></a>VIII. &mdash; SIR EDWARD HARDCASTLE, BART., DECEASED</h2>

  <h3>(DR. JERVIS'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">THORNDYKE'S reasons for wishing to arrive at the mortuary a
  few minutes before the appointed time were not difficult to guess at. But
  they became crystal clear as soon as the constable, deputed by the
  Superintendent, had admitted us and retired. As soon as the door shut behind
  the officer, he stepped quickly across to the long shelf on which the
  clothing had been deposited, and, picking up the shoes, turned them over,
  took a single glance at the soles, and then, without comment, held them out
  for my inspection.</p>

  <p>No comment was needed. The soles were, relatively speaking, perfectly
  clean. There was not a trace of mud or any sign whatever of their having been
  damp. On the contrary, there still clung to them a certain amount of light
  dust, and this was still more evident on the welts and uppers. The condition
  of those shoes proved with absolute certainty that however and whenever Sir
  Edward Hardcastle had got into that empty house, he had not walked there on
  the night of Sunday, the twenty-first of June.</p>

  <p>There was no time, however, to dwell on this striking confirmation of our
  previous conclusions. Thorndyke already had the research case open and had
  taken out the little finger-print box and produced from it the ready-inked
  copper plate, a piece of soft rag and a couple of smooth cards. The latter he
  handed to me, and together we moved over to the great table and uncovered the
  hands of the corpse.</p>

  <p>"We shan't get normal prints," he remarked, as he wiped the finger-tips
  one after the other and then touched them with the inked plate, "but they
  will be clear enough to compare with our photographs of those of the
  chair-back."</p>

  <p>They were certainly not normal prints, for the finger-tips were shrunken
  and almost mummified. But, distorted as they were, the ridge-patterns were
  fairly distinct and quite decipherable, as I could see by the quick glance
  that I took at each print after pressing the inked finger-tip on the
  card.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "there will be no difficulty about these. I only wish the
  photographs were half as clear."</p>

  <p>I handed them to him and he immediately slipped them into the grooved
  receptacle with which the box was provided. Then he closed the latter and
  replaced it in the research case.</p>

  <p>"I am glad we were able to get that done unobserved," said he. "Now we can
  make our observations at our ease."</p>

  <p>He took out of the research case a pair of rubber gloves and a case of
  post-mortem instruments which he placed on a vacant spot on the great table.
  Then he brought out the tape and carefully measured the length of the
  corpse.</p>

  <p>"Sixty-five inches," he reported. "Five feet five. You remember the height
  of that beam. Now we will have another look at those shoes."</p>

  <p>He took them up once more and turned them over slowly to bring each part
  into view. Adhering to one heel was a small flat mass of some material which
  had apparently been trodden on, and which Thorndyke detached with his
  pocket-knife and deposited in an envelope from the research case.</p>

  <p>"Looks like a small piece of soap," he remarked as he wrote "heel of right
  shoe" on it and put it back in the case, "but we may as well see what it is.
  You notice several rubbed places on these shoes, but especially on the backs,
  as if deceased had been dragged along a fairly smooth surface. Perhaps the
  back of his coat may tell us something more."</p>

  <p>He laid the shoes down and, taking up the neatly folded coat, carefully
  unfolded it and held it up.</p>

  <p>"I think you are right, Thorndyke," said I. "The coat is pretty dirty all
  over, but the back is noticeably more dusty than the other parts. It looks as
  if it had been dragged along a dirty floor; and those two bits of cotton
  sticking to it suggest indoor rather than outdoor dirt. And the same is true
  of the trousers," I added, holding them up for inspection. "There is a
  definitely dusty area at the back, and here is another piece of cotton
  sticking to the cloth."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think that point is clear," he said, "and it is an important
  point. The cotton is, as you say, definitely suggestive of a floor rather
  than an out-of-door surface." He picked off the three fragments, and, as he
  bestowed them with the other 'specimens', remarked: "There is nothing very
  distinctive about cotton, but we may as well take them for reference. I wish
  we had time to go over the clothing thoroughly, but we had better not show
  too conspicuous an interest."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he looked over each garment, quickly, but with intense
  scrutiny, passing each to me before taking up the next. Over one object
  only&mdash;the collar&mdash;did he seem disposed to linger; and certainly its
  appearance invited notice; for not only was it extremely dirty and crumpled,
  but it seemed to be uniformly stained as if with weak tea. Moreover, as I
  held it in my hands, it gave me the impression of a sort of harsh stiffness
  unaccounted for by the material, for it was a collar of the kind known as
  'semi-stiff' which usually becomes quite limp after a day's wear. But now
  Thorndyke had passed on to an examination of the rope noose and I laid down
  the collar to join him.</p>

  <p>"Evidently," said he, "as they were able to remove it without cutting it,
  the knot must have slipped open pretty easily. And you can see why. The noose
  was made with a running bowline, a rather unsuitable and unusual knot for the
  purpose. We will venture to untie it and measure its length, to add to our
  other measurement. You notice that both ends are cut, so that the whole
  length is only a part of the complete rope, whatever it was."</p>

  <p>He rapidly unfastened the knot and measured the length of the piece, and
  when he had made a note of the measurement, he produced his pocket-knife and
  cut off a portion about eight inches long which he dropped into the research
  case. Meanwhile, I carefully re-tied the bowline and had just replaced it
  where we had found it when the door opened somewhat abruptly and a stout,
  well-dressed, middle-aged man bustled in and deposited a hand-bag on a side
  bench.</p>

  <p>"I must really apologise to you, gentlemen," he said, civilly, "for
  keeping you waiting, but you know how difficult it is for a G.P. to keep
  appointments punctually. Inquests are the bane of my life."</p>

  <p>He hung his hat on a peg by the door, and then, as he turned, his glance
  lighted on Thorndyke's rubber gloves and instrument case.</p>

  <p>"Those your tools?" he asked; and when Thorndyke admitted the ownership,
  he enquired with evident interest: "Were you thinking of taking a hand in
  this job?"</p>

  <p>"I came prepared to offer any assistance that might be acceptable,"
  Thorndyke replied.</p>

  <p>"That is very good of you&mdash;my name is Ross, by the way. Of course I
  know yours&mdash;very good of you, indeed. I don't mind confiding to you that
  I hate post-mortems; and really, they are not very suitable jobs for a man
  who is going in and out of sick-rooms and examining living people."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you," said Thorndyke. "Medicine and pathology do not
  mix kindly; and as I am a pathologist and not in medical practice, perhaps
  you would like me to carry out the actual dissection?"</p>

  <p>"I should, very much," Dr. Ross replied. "You are an experienced
  pathologist and I am not. But do you think it would be in order?</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Thorndyke asked. "You are instructed to make a post-mortem
  inspection. You can do that without performing the dissection. The
  observations and inferences on which you will give evidence will be your own
  observations and inferences."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is true," agreed Ross. "But perhaps I had better make, say, the
  first incision. If I do that, I can say truthfully that I made the
  post-mortem with your assistance. That is, if I am asked. The whole affair is
  a mere formality."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke; "we will make the autopsy jointly," and with
  this he took off his coat, rolled up his shirt sleeves, drew on the rubber
  gloves, opened his instrument case and removed the sheet with which the body
  had been covered.</p>

  <p>I was somewhat amused at our colleague's casuistry and also at the
  subtlety of Thorndyke's tactics. The sort of examination that our friend
  would have made, on the assumption that the cause of death was obvious and
  the autopsy "a mere formality," would not have served Thorndyke's purpose.
  Now he would conduct the investigation in accordance with what was in his own
  mind.</p>

  <p>Dr. Ross ran his eye quickly over the corpse. "It is not an attractive
  body," he remarked, "but it might easily have been worse after three weeks.
  Still, all those post-mortem stains are a trifle confusing. You don't see
  anything abnormal about the general appearance, do you?</p>

  <p>"Nothing very definite," replied Thorndyke. "Those transverse stains on
  the outer sides of the arms might be pressure marks, or they might not."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Ross. "I should say they are just post-mortem stains.
  They are certainly not bruises. What do you think of the groove?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Thorndyke, "as we know that the body was hanging for three
  weeks, we can hardly expect to learn much from it. You notice that the knot
  was at the back and that it was a rather bulky knot."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ross. "Wrong place, of course, and wrong sort of knot. But
  perhaps he hadn't had much practice in hanging himself. Shall I make the
  incision now?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke handed him a scalpel and he made an incision&mdash;a very
  tentative one. Then he retired to the open window and lit his pipe.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to supervise?" Thorndyke enquired with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"What is the use? You are an expert and I am not. If you will tell me what
  you find, that will satisfy me. I accept your facts without question, though
  I shall form my own conclusions."</p>

  <p>"You don't consider an expert's conclusions as convincing as his facts?" I
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wouldn't say that," he replied. "But, you see, a medico-legal
  expert tends to approach an inquiry with a certain bias in favour of the
  abnormal. Take this present case. Here is an unfortunate gentleman who is
  found hanging in an empty house. A melancholy affair, but that is all that
  there is to it. Yet here are you two experts, with an enthusiasm that I
  admire and respect, voluntarily and cheerfully undertaking a most unpleasant
  investigation in search of something that pretty certainly is not there. And
  why? Because you utterly refuse to accept the obvious."</p>

  <p>"It isn't exactly the function of a medico-legal expert to accept the
  obvious," I ventured to remind him.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," he agreed. "That is my point. Your function is to look out
  for the abnormal and find it if you possibly can. To you, a normal case is
  just a failure, a case in which you have drawn a blank."</p>

  <p>I was on the point of suggesting that his own function in this case was,
  in effect, the same as ours. But then, as I realised that his easy-going
  acceptance of surface appearances was making things easy for Thorndyke, I
  refrained and proceeded to "make conversation" along other lines.</p>

  <p>"Your work as police surgeon must give you a good deal of medico-legal
  experience," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"I'm not the police surgeon," he replied; "at least only by acting rank.
  The genuine artist is away on leave and I don't care how soon he comes back.
  This job is a hideous interruption of one's ordinary routine. But I see that
  the pathologist has made a discovery. What is the specimen that you are
  collecting?" he added as Thorndyke replaced the stopper in a bottle and stood
  the latter on a side bench.</p>

  <p>"It is some fluid from the stomach," Thorndyke replied. "There was only an
  ounce or so, but I am surprised to find any in a half-mummified body like
  this."</p>

  <p>"And you are preserving it for analysis, I suppose?" said Ross.</p>

  <p>"Yes, just a rough analysis as a matter of routine. Would you write the
  label, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"Any particular reason for preserving that fluid?" asked Ross. "Any signs
  or suggestions of poison, for instance?</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "But it will be just as well to exclude it
  definitely. The stomach is better preserved than I should have expected and
  less red."</p>

  <p>"You don't suspect arsenic?"</p>

  <p>"No, certainly not as a cause of death; nor, in fact, any other poison.
  The routine analysis is just an extra precaution."</p>

  <p>"Well, I expect you are right, from your point of view," said Ross. "And,
  of course, poison is a possibility. The ways of suicides are so
  unaccountable, I heard of a man who took a dose of oxalic acid, then cut his
  throat, ineffectually, and finally hanged himself. So this man may have taken
  a dose and failed to produce the desired effect; but he undoubtedly finished
  himself off with the rope, and that is all that matters to the coroner's
  jury."</p>

  <p>"There are a number of small bodies which look like fish-scales sticking
  to the walls of the stomach," Thorndyke reported. "No other contents
  excepting the fluid."</p>

  <p>"Well," Ross protested, "there is nothing very abnormal about fish-scales
  in the stomach. The reasonable inference is that he had been eating fish.
  What do you mean to suggest?"</p>

  <p>"I am not suggesting anything," replied Thorndyke. "I am merely reporting
  the facts as I observe them. The lungs seem slightly cedematous and there is
  just a trace of fluid in them&mdash;only a trace."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come," Ross expostulated, "you are not going to hint that he was
  drowned! Because he wasn't. I've seen some drowned bodies and I can say quite
  positively that this is not one. Besides, let us keep the facts in mind. This
  man was found hanging from a beam in a house."</p>

  <p>"Once more," Thorndyke replied, a little wearily, "let me repeat that I am
  offering no suggestions or inferences. As we agreed, I report the facts and
  you form your own conclusions. There are one or two of these little
  bodies&mdash;fish-scales or whatever they are&mdash;in the air-passages.
  Perhaps you would like to look at them."</p>

  <p>Dr. Ross walked over to the table and looked down as Thorndyke
  demonstrated the little whitish specks sticking to the sides of the bronchial
  tubes, and for the moment he seemed somewhat impressed. But only for a
  moment. Unlike the medico-legal expert, as his fancy painted him, Dr. Ross
  evidently approached an inquiry with a strong bias in favour of the
  normal.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, as he returned to the window, "it is queer how they can
  have got into the lung. Still, we know he had been eating fish, and there
  must have been particles in the mouth. Perhaps he had an attack of coughing
  and got some of them drawn down his trachea. Anyhow there they are. But if
  you will excuse me for saying so, these curious and no doubt interesting
  little details are just a trifle beside the mark. The object of this
  examination is to ascertain the cause of death&mdash;if it isn't obvious
  enough from the circumstances. Now, what do you say? You have made a pretty
  complete examination&mdash;and uncommonly quick you have been over it. I
  couldn't have done it in twice the time. But what is the result? The alleged
  fact is that this man hanged himself. If he did, he presumably died of
  asphyxia. Is the appearance of the body consistent with death from asphyxia?
  That is the question that I shall be asked at the inquest; and I have got to
  answer it. What do you say?</p>

  <p>"One doesn't like to dogmatise," Thorndyke answered, cautiously. "You see
  the state of the body. Most of the characteristic signs are absent owing to
  the drying and the other changes. But making all the necessary allowances, I
  think the appearances are suggestive of death from asphyxia. At any rate
  there are no signs inconsistent with that cause of death and there is nothing
  to suggest any other."</p>

  <p>"That is what I wanted to know," said Ross, "and if you can give me one or
  two details, I will run off and put my notes in order so that I can give my
  evidence clearly and answer any questions."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke dictated a brief description of the state of the various organs
  which Ross took down verbatim in his note-book. Then he put it away, got his
  hat from the peg and picked up his hand-bag.</p>

  <p>"I am infinitely obliged to you two gentlemen," he said. "You have saved
  me from a task that I hate and you have done the job immeasurably better than
  I could have done it and in half the time. I only hope that I haven't
  victimised you too much."</p>

  <p>"You haven't victimised us at all," said Thorndyke. "It has been a matter
  of mutual accommodation."</p>

  <p>"Very good of you to say so," said Ross; and having thanked us once more,
  he bustled away.</p>

  <p>"I hope that you have not misled that good gentleman," I remarked as
  Thorndyke proceeded to restore, as far as possible, the status quo ante and
  render the corpse presentable to the coroner's jury.</p>

  <p>"I have not misled him intentionally," he replied. "I gave him all the
  observed facts. His interpretation of them is his own affair. Perhaps, while
  I am finishing, you would complete the labels. That corked tube filled with
  water contains the fish-scales, as I assume them to be."</p>

  <p>"Shall I write 'fish-scales' on the label?"</p>

  <p>"No; just write 'from lungs, mouth and stomach'; and perhaps you might
  look through the beard and the hair and see if you can find any more."</p>

  <p>"The hair!" I exclaimed. "How on earth could they get into the hair?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they did not," he replied. "But you may as well look. We are not
  adopting Ross's interpretation, you know."</p>

  <p>I took a pair of dissecting forceps and searched among the rather short
  hair of the scalp, speculating curiously as to what Thorndyke could have in
  his mind. But whatever it was, it evidently agreed with the facts for my
  search brought to light no less than six of the little, white, lustrous
  objects.</p>

  <p>"You had better put them in a separate tube," said Thorndyke, when I
  reported the find, "in case they are not the same as the others. And now it
  would be as well to have another look at the coat."</p>

  <p>He had drawn the sheet over the whole of the body excepting the head and
  neck and now proceeded to clean and dry his rubber gloves and instruments.
  While he was thus occupied, I took up the coat and made a fresh and more
  detailed inspection.</p>

  <p>"It is extraordinarily dirty at the back," I reported, "and there seems to
  be a slight stain on the collar and shoulders as if it had been wetted with
  dirty water."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I noticed that," he said. "You don't see any foreign particles
  sticking to it or to any of the other garments?"</p>

  <p>I looked the coat over inside and out but could find nothing excepting a
  tiny fragment of what looked like black silk thread, which had stuck to the
  flap of a pocket. I picked it off and put it in the envelope with the ends of
  cotton. Then I turned my attention to the other garments. From the trousers
  nothing fresh was to be learned, nor from the waistcoat&mdash;the pockets of
  which I searched to make sure that the little leather ring-case had not been
  overlooked&mdash;excepting that, like the coat, it showed signs on its collar
  of having been wetted; as also did the blue and white striped cotton shirt. I
  was examining the latter when Thorndyke, having finished 'tidying up', came
  and looked over my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"That stain," he remarked, "hardly looks like water, even dirty water,
  though it is surprising how distinct and conspicuous a stain perfectly clean
  water will sometimes make on linen which has been worn and exposed to
  dust."</p>

  <p>He took the garment from me and examined the stained part intently, felt
  it critically with finger and thumb and finally held it to his nose and
  sniffed at it. Then he laid it down and picked up the collar, which he
  examined in the same manner, by sight, touch and smell, turning it over and
  opening the fold to inspect the inside.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "we ought to find out, if possible, whether this was
  water or some other fluid. We don't know what light the knowledge might throw
  on this extraordinarily obscure case."</p>

  <p>He was still standing, as if undecided, with the collar in his hand when
  the sound of footsteps approaching down the alley became audible; whereupon
  he turned quickly, and, dropping the collar into the research case, closed
  the latter and took his hat down from the peg. The next moment the door
  opened and the sergeant looked in.</p>

  <p>"Jury coming to view the body, gentlemen," he announced; and with a
  critical look towards the table, he added: "I thought I had better come on
  ahead and see that they shouldn't get too bad a shock. Juries are sometimes a
  bit squeamish, but I see that the doctor has left everything tidy and decent.
  You know where the inquest is to be held, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"We don't," replied Thorndyke, "but if we lurk outside and follow the jury
  we shan't go far wrong."</p>

  <p>We walked up to the top of the alley, where we met a party of rather
  apprehensive-looking men who were being personally conducted by a constable.
  We waited for them to return, which they did with remarkable promptitude and
  looking not at all refreshed by their visit, and we turned and followed in
  their wake, the sergeant, as coroner's officer, hurrying past us to
  anticipate their arrival at the place where the inquiry was to be held.</p>

  <p>"It seems almost a waste of time for us to sit out the proceedings," I
  remarked as we walked along in the rear of the procession. "We have got all
  the material facts."</p>

  <p>"We think we have," replied Thorndyke, "and it is not likely that we shall
  hear anything that will alter our views of the case. But, still, we don't
  know that something vital may not turn up in the evidence."</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine anything that could account for the state of the dead
  man's shoes," said I.</p>

  <p>"No," he agreed, "that seems conclusive, and I think it is. Nevertheless,
  if it should transpire in evidence that Sir Edward was seen in the
  neighbourhood before the rain started, the absence of mud on his shoes would
  cease to have any special significance. But here we are at the court. I
  expect Brodribb is there already and it will probably be best for him and for
  us if we select seats that are not too near his. He will want to give his
  whole attention to his own evidence and that of the other witnesses."</p>

  <p>We watched the last of the jurymen enter the municipal office in which the
  proceedings were to take place; then we went in and took possession of a
  couple of chairs in a corner, commanding a view of the table and the place in
  which the witnesses would stand or sit to give their evidence.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>IX. &mdash; THE CROWNER'S QUEST</h2>

  <h3>(DR. JERVIS'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">DURING the brief preliminary period, while the jury-men were
  taking their places and the court was pervaded by the hum of conversation and
  the rustle of movement, I looked about me to see who was present and if
  possible to identify the prospective witnesses. Brodribb was seated near the
  coroner's chair, and, by his rather unhappy, preoccupied look, I judged that
  Thorndyke, with his usual tact, had pretty accurately gauged his mental
  state. He caught my eye once and acknowledged my silent greeting with a grave
  nod, but immediately relapsed into his previous gloomy and meditative
  condition.</p>

  <p>Seated next to him was an elderly&mdash;or perhaps I should say an
  old&mdash;man, for he looked well over sixty, who was, in appearance, such a
  typical example of the old-fashioned better gentleman's servant that I
  instantly placed him, correctly, as it turned out, as Mr. Weeks, Sir Edward's
  butler. Behind the coroner's chair was our friend the Superintendent, who was
  carrying on a whispered conversation with Dr. Ross. Our colleague struck me
  as looking a little nervous and sheepish and I noticed that he held a paper
  in his hand and glanced at it from time to time. From which I inferred that
  he was conning over his notes with a view to the prompt and confident
  delivery of his evidence.</p>

  <p>At this point my observations were brought to an end by a premonitory
  cough on the part of the coroner, which had somewhat the effect of the
  warning rattle of a striking clock, as giving the company to understand that
  he was about to begin his address. Thereupon, silence fell on the assembly
  and the proceedings opened. Quite briefly and in general terms, he indicated
  the nature of the case which was the subject of the inquiry, and, having
  sketchily recited the leading facts, proceeded to call the witnesses.</p>

  <p>"It is the common practice," he said in conclusion, "to begin with the
  medical evidence, as the state of the body is usually the principal means of
  determining the cause of death and of answering the questions, How, When and
  Where that death was brought about. But in the present case the circumstances
  surrounding the discovery of the body have so important a bearing that I
  think it better to take the evidence on that point first. The first witness
  will be James Holker."</p>

  <p>In response to the implied summons, a well-dressed, capable-looking man
  rose and approached the table. Having been sworn, he deposed that his name
  was James Holker, that he was by calling a ship's steward but now retired and
  living chiefly on the proceeds of certain house property that he owned. Among
  other such property was a row of houses known as Piper's Row; and it was in
  one of these houses, Number Five, to wit, that he made the discovery.</p>

  <p>"On what date was that?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"On Tuesday, the fourteenth of July. Yesterday morning, in fact."</p>

  <p>"Tell us exactly what happened on that occasion."</p>

  <p>"I went round to Number Five to go on with some repairs that I had begun.
  I went straight into the front room&mdash;that is the living-room&mdash;and
  then I noticed a glove lying on the floor under the window. I remembered
  having seen that glove before. But now I noticed something very unpleasant
  about the air of the place and there seemed to be an unusual number of flies
  and blue-bottles about. So I went through to the kitchen and it was worse
  there. Then I opened the door of the wash-house and looked in; and there I
  saw a man hanging from a roof-beam. I didn't stop to examine him. I just
  bolted straight out of the house and ran up to the police station to report
  what had happened."</p>

  <p>"You had no doubt that the man was dead?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever. I could see at a glance that he had been dead a week or
  two. And it wasn't a matter of eyesight only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. Quite so. Now, have you any means of judging how long he had been
  hanging there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I judge that he had been hanging there a little over three
  weeks."</p>

  <p>"Tell us how you are able to arrive at that time."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, it was this way. On Sunday, the twenty-first of June, I put in
  a fairly full day's work at the repairs on Number Five; and nothing could
  have happened on that day, because I went all over the house. I worked on
  there all the afternoon up to getting on for five, and then, as I saw that it
  was coming on wet, I stowed my tools in a cupboard in the front room and ran
  off home as hard as I could go through the rain.</p>

  <p>"That night, the captain of an old ship of mine, the _Esmeralda_, called
  to ask me to take a trip with him to Marseilles, as his steward had to go
  into hospital. I thought I'd like the trip, and I was glad to oblige the
  captain, so I said 'Yes' and set to work to pack my kit. Next morning,
  Monday, I ran round to Number Five to fetch my tools away. As I was in a
  hurry, I only went into the front room, where my tools were. But I could see
  that someone had been in the house, because there was a glove lying on the
  floor just under the window; and I noticed that the window was unfastened and
  slightly open. If I had had time I would have had a look round the house;
  but, as I was in a hurry to get on to the docks, and there was nothing in the
  house that anyone could take, I just took up my tools and came away."</p>

  <p>"Did you pick up the glove?"</p>

  <p>"No. I left it as it was; and when I went to the house yesterday, it was
  lying in the same place."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything else that you can tell us about the case?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. That's all I know about it."</p>

  <p>The coroner glanced at the jury. "Are there any questions that you wish to
  ask the witness, gentlemen?" he enquired. "If not, we will next take the
  evidence of Superintendent Thompson."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent marched briskly up to the table and having disposed,
  with business-like brevity, of the preliminary formalities, gave his evidence
  with a conciseness born of long experience.</p>

  <p>"At ten-fifteen yesterday morning, that is Tuesday, the fourteenth of
  July, the previous witness, James Holker, came to the police station and
  reported to me that a dead man was hanging in a house of his, Number Five
  Piper's Row. I gave instructions for a wheeled stretcher to be sent there and
  then proceeded forthwith to the house in company with Holker and Constable
  Marshall.</p>

  <p>"On entering, I went straight through to the wash-house, where I saw the
  dead body of a man hanging by a rope from a roof-beam. Nearly underneath the
  body but a little to one side was an overturned chair; and close to the chair
  a wash-leather glove was lying on the floor and a little farther off a soft
  felt hat. A walking-stick was standing in the corner by the door. Deceased
  had no collar on, but I found the collar, afterwards, in his pocket, very
  dirty and crumpled. The rope by which the body was hanging was a small coir
  rope, a trifle thinner than my little finger. It was tied very securely to
  the beam above and the noose had a rather large knot, which was at the back
  of the neck."</p>

  <p>"Could you form any idea as to how long the body had been hanging?" the
  coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"I could only form a rough estimate. Judging by the advanced state of
  decomposition I concluded that it must have been hanging at least a
  fortnight, and I thought it probable that Holker's account, making it three
  weeks, was correct."</p>

  <p>"Did there appear to be anything unusual in the method used by
  deceased?"</p>

  <p>"No. The way in which the suicide was carried out seemed quite simple and
  ordinary. Apparently, when he came into the wash-house, he stood his stick in
  the corner, threw down his hat and glove, took off his collar and put it in
  his pocket. Then he probably made the noose, stood on the chair and tied the
  rope to the beam, put the noose round his neck, pulled it fairly tight, drew
  up his legs and kicked the chair over so that he was left swinging free. That
  was what it looked like."</p>

  <p>"Is there any evidence as to how deceased got into the house?"</p>

  <p>"I think there is no doubt that he got in by the front room window. He
  couldn't have got in by the street door, because it was locked&mdash;at
  least, so I am informed by Holker, who is quite sure that he shut it when he
  left the house on Sunday evening, the twenty-first of June&mdash;and deceased
  had no keys on him. But there is positive evidence that he got in by the
  window; for when I went into the front room, I found the window unfastened
  and open a couple of inches, and just underneath it I found a wash-leather
  glove on the floor, which was evidently the fellow of the glove that was
  lying on the wash-house floor under the body."</p>

  <p>"And with regard to the rope. Did deceased find that on the premises?"</p>

  <p>"No. He must have brought it with him. I questioned Holker about it and he
  informed me that it was not his, that he had never seen it before and that
  there was no rope of any kind in the house."</p>

  <p>"Were there any signs that the body had been robbed?"</p>

  <p>"No; and I think I can say definitely that it had not. There was not much
  in the pockets, considering the deceased gentleman's position, but there were
  things in them that no thief would have left. For instance, there was a purse
  containing three sovereigns and a letter wallet with two five-pound notes in
  it. And the small value of the contents of the pockets seems to be
  satisfactorily accounted for, as Mr. Brodribb has informed me that deceased
  had emptied his pockets of most of his valuables, including his gold watch,
  before he left the club."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said the coroner, "that is a significant fact. We must get the
  details from Mr. Brodribb. Are there any further facts known to you that
  ought to be communicated to the jury?"</p>

  <p>"I think I ought to mention that deceased's clothing was extraordinarily
  dirty and tumbled. The collar was excessively dirty and seemed to have been
  wetted, and so did the shirt at the neck; and the coat and trousers were very
  dusty at the back, as if deceased had been lying on a dirty floor."</p>

  <p>"What do you suggest as to the significance of those facts?"</p>

  <p>"Taken with the fact that deceased left the club (as I am informed) on
  Wednesday, the seventeenth of June, and could not have entered the empty
  house before Sunday night, the twenty-first of June, the state of his clothes
  suggests to me that he had been wandering about in the interval, perhaps
  spending the nights in common lodging-houses or sleeping in the open, and
  that he had washed himself at pumps or taps and got his head and neck wet. Of
  course, that is only a guess."</p>

  <p>"Quite so. But it seems probable and certainly agrees with the known
  circumstances. Is there any thing more that you have to tell the jury?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. That is all the information that I have to give."</p>

  <p>"Any questions, gentlemen?" the coroner asked, glancing at the jury. "No
  questions. Thank you, Superintendent. Perhaps, before we hear the next
  witness we had better recall Mr. Holker in order that he may confirm on oath
  those of his statements which have been quoted by the Superintendent."</p>

  <p>Holker was accordingly recalled and formally confirmed those passages of
  the officer's evidence (referring to the door and the rope) when they had
  been read out by the coroner from the depositions. This formality having been
  disposed of, the coroner glanced through his notes and then announced: "We
  will take the medical evidence next so that the doctor may be able to get
  away to his patients. Dr. Ross."</p>

  <p>Our colleague approached the table with less obvious self-possession than
  the experienced officer who had preceded him. But he was quite a good
  witness. He had made up his mind as to what he was going to say and he said
  it with a confident, authoritative air that carried conviction to the
  jury.</p>

  <p>"You have made a thorough examination of the body of deceased?" the
  coroner said, when the witness had been sworn and the other preliminaries
  despatched.</p>

  <p>"I have," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"And what was the result of your examination? You understand, doctor, that
  the jury don't want you to go into technical details. They just want the
  conclusions that you arrived at. To begin with, how long should you say the
  deceased had been dead?"</p>

  <p>"I should say that he had been dead not less than three weeks."</p>

  <p>"Were you able to ascertain the cause of death?"</p>

  <p>"I was able to form a very definite opinion. The condition of the body was
  so very unfavourable for examination that I hardly like to go beyond
  that."</p>

  <p>"Quite so. The jury have seen the body and I am sure they fully realise
  its condition. But you were able to form a decided opinion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I found distinct signs of death from asphyxia and I found nothing
  whatever to suggest any other cause of death."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner, "that seems to be sufficient for our purpose.
  Was there anything to account for the asphyxia?</p>

  <p>"There was a deep groove encircling the neck, marking the position of the
  rope by which deceased had been suspended."</p>

  <p>Here the foreman of the jury interposed with the request that the witness
  would explain exactly what he meant by asphyxia.</p>

  <p>"Asphyxia," the doctor explained, "is the condition which is produced when
  a person is prevented from breathing. If the breathing is completely stopped,
  death occurs in about two minutes."</p>

  <p>"And how may the breathing become stopped?" the foreman asked.</p>

  <p>"In various ways. By hanging, by strangling, by covering the mouth and
  nose with a pillow or other soft object, by drowning or by immersion in a gas
  such as carbonic acid."</p>

  <p>"What do you say was the cause of the asphyxia in this case?"</p>

  <p>"As hanging causes asphyxia and deceased was undoubtedly hanged, the
  asphyxia was presumably due to the hanging."</p>

  <p>"That seems fairly obvious," said the coroner; "but," he added, looking a
  little severely at the foreman, "we mustn't ask the doctor to provide us with
  a verdict. He is giving evidence as to the facts observed by himself. It is
  for you to decide on the significance of those facts. He tells us that he
  observed signs of death from asphyxia. We have heard from other witnesses
  that deceased was found hanging; the connection of those facts is a question
  for the jury. Is there anything else that you have to tell us, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"No, I observed nothing else that is relevant to the inquiry."</p>

  <p>"Does any gentleman wish to ask the doctor any further questions?" the
  coroner asked, glancing at the jury; and as no one expressed any such desire,
  he continued: "Then I think we need not detain the doctor any longer. The
  next witness will be Herbert Weeks."</p>

  <p>On hearing his name pronounced, Mr. Weeks rose and took his place at the
  table. Having been sworn, he stated that he had been butler to deceased,
  whose father, Sir Julian, he had served in the same capacity. He had known
  deceased practically all his (deceased's) life and they were on very intimate
  and confidential terms.</p>

  <p>"Had you ever any reason to expect that deceased might make away with
  himself?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"No," was the reply. "Such a thing never occurred to me."</p>

  <p>"Have you noticed anything of late in his manner or his apparent state of
  mind that might account for, or explain his having made away with himself?
  Has he, for instance, seemed worried or depressed about anything?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Weeks hesitated. At length he replied, with an air of weighing his
  words carefully: "I don't think he was worried about anything. So far as I
  know, there was nothing for him to worry about. And I should hardly describe
  him as being depressed, though I must admit that he had not very good
  spirits. He had never really recovered from the shock of losing his wife and
  his son&mdash;his only child."</p>

  <p>"When did that happen?"</p>

  <p>"About ten years ago. They were both carried off by influenza within a few
  days, and Sir Edward himself nearly died of the same complaint. When he began
  to get better, we had to break it to him and I thought it would have killed
  him; and though he did at last recover, he was never the same man again."</p>

  <p>"In what respect was he changed?"</p>

  <p>"He seemed to have lost interest in life. When her ladyship and the young
  gentleman were alive, he was always cheerful and gay and full of schemes and
  projects for the future. He was constantly planning improvements in the
  estate and riding about the property with his son to discuss them. He was
  very devoted to his wife and son, as they were to him; a most affectionate
  and united family. When they died, it seemed as if he had lost everything
  that he cared for. He took no further interest in his property but just left
  it to the bailiff to manage and turned his business affairs over to Mr.
  Brodribb."</p>

  <p>"And you say that he was changed in manner?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. All his old high spirits went, though he was just as kind and
  thoughtful for others as he had always been. But he became grave and quiet in
  his manner and seemed rather dull and aimless, as if there was nothing that
  he cared about in particular."</p>

  <p>The coroner reflected for a few moments on these statements. Then
  abandoning this line of enquiry, he asked: "When did deceased leave
  home?"</p>

  <p>"On Tuesday, the sixteenth of June."</p>

  <p>"Did he inform you what his intended movements were?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He said that he was going to spend a couple of days in London and
  that he expected to return home on Thursday afternoon. He told me that he
  intended to stay at his club as he usually did when visiting London."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything unusual in his manner on that occasion?"</p>

  <p>"I thought that he seemed rather preoccupied, as if he had some business
  on hand that he was giving a good deal of thought to."</p>

  <p>"He did not strike you as unusually depressed or anxious?"</p>

  <p>"No; only that he gave me the impression that he was thinking out
  something that he did not quite understand."</p>

  <p>"Was that the last time that you saw him alive?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I stood at the main door and watched him walk away down the drive,
  followed by one of the gardeners carrying his suit-case. I never saw him
  again until this morning, when I saw him in the mortuary."</p>

  <p>Mr. Weeks delivered these statements in quiet, even tones, but it was easy
  to see that he was controlling his emotion with some difficulty. Observing
  this, the coroner turned from the witness to the jury.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "Mr. Weeks has given us all the material facts known
  to him, so, if there are no questions, we need not prolong what is, no doubt,
  a very painful ordeal for him." He paused, and then, as no question was
  asked, he thanked the witness and dismissed him. A brief pause followed
  during which the coroner glanced quickly through his notes. Then Mr.
  Brodribb's name was called; and, bearing Thorndyke's prediction in mind, I
  gave his evidence my very special attention.</p>

  <p>"What was the exact nature of your relations with deceased?" the coroner
  asked, when the introductory matter had been disposed of.</p>

  <p>"I was his solicitor. But in addition to my purely legal functions, I
  acted as his adviser in respect of the general business connected with the
  management of his property. I am also the executor of his will."</p>

  <p>"Then you can tell us if there were any embarrassments or difficulties
  connected with his property that were causing him anxiety."</p>

  <p>"I can. There were no embarrassments or difficulties whatever. His
  financial affairs were not only completely in order but in a highly
  favourable state. I may say that his estate was flourishing and his income
  considerably in excess of his expenditure. He certainly had no financial
  anxieties."</p>

  <p>"Had he any anxieties of any kind, so far as you know?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know, he had none."</p>

  <p>"You heard Mr. Weeks's description of the change in his manner and habits
  caused by his bereavement. Do you confirm that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; the loss of his wife and son left him a broken man."</p>

  <p>"You attribute the change in him to the grief due to his bereavement?</p>

  <p>"Principally. The loss of those so dear to him left an abiding grief. But
  there was a further effect. Sir Edward's lively interest in his estate and
  his ambition to improve it and increase its value were based on the
  consideration that it would in due course pass to his son, and probably to
  his son's son. Like most English landowners, he had a strong sense of
  continuity. But the continuity of succession was destroyed by his son's
  death. The present heir-presumptive is a distant relative who was almost a
  stranger to Sir Edward. Thus deceased had come to feel that he was no more
  than a life-tenant of the estate; that, at his death, it would pass out of
  the possession of his own family into the hands of strangers and there was no
  knowing what might happen to it. As a result he, not unnaturally, lost all
  interest in the future of the estate. But since, hitherto, this had been the
  predominant purpose of his life, its failure left him without any strong
  interest or aim in life."</p>

  <p>The coroner nodded, as one who appreciates a material point of
  evidence.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "this loss of interest in life seems to have an important
  bearing on our inquiry. But beyond this general state of mind, did you ever
  notice any more particular manifestation. In short, did you ever observe
  anything that caused you to entertain the possibility that deceased might
  make away with himself?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb hesitated. "I can't say," he replied, after a pause, "that
  the possibility of suicide ever entered my mind."</p>

  <p>"That, Mr. Brodribb, seems a rather qualified answer, as if you had
  something further in your mind. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Apparently the coroner was right, for Mr. Brodribb, after a few moments'
  rather uneasy reflection, replied with obvious unwillingness: "I certainly
  never considered the possibility of suicide; but, looking back, I am not sure
  that there were not some suggestions that were at least susceptible of such
  an interpretation. I now recall, for instance, a remark which deceased made
  to me some months ago. We were, I think, discussing the almost universal
  repugnance to the idea of death when deceased said (as nearly as I can
  remember), 'I often feel, Brodribb, that there is something rather restful in
  the thought of death. That it would be quite pleasant and peaceful to feel
  oneself sinking into sleep with the certain knowledge that one was never
  going to wake up.' I attached no weight to that remark at the time, but now,
  looking at it in the light of what has happened, it seems rather
  significant."</p>

  <p>"I agree with you," the coroner said, emphatically. "It seems very
  significant indeed. And that suggests another question. I presume that you
  are pretty well acquainted with the affairs of deceased's family?"</p>

  <p>"Very well indeed. I have been connected with the Hardcastle estate during
  the whole of my professional life, and so was my father before me."</p>

  <p>"Then you can tell us whether any instances of suicide have occurred among
  any of deceased's relatives."</p>

  <p>Once more Mr. Brodribb hesitated with a slightly puzzled and reluctant
  air. At length, he replied, cautiously: "I can only say that no instance of
  suicide in the family is known to me, or even suspected by me. But it seems
  proper that I should acquaint you with the rather mysterious and highly
  eccentric conduct of deceased's brother, Gervase. This gentleman became,
  unfortunately, rather intemperate in his habits, with the regrettable
  result&mdash;among others&mdash;that he was deprived of a fellowship that he
  held at Oxford. Thereafter, he disappeared and ceased to communicate with his
  family, and all that is known of him is that he was, for a time, living in
  poverty, and apparently in something like squalor, in Paris and other foreign
  towns."</p>

  <p>"Had his family cast him off?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. Sir Edward's feelings towards him were quite friendly and
  brotherly. He would willingly have provided the means for his brother to live
  comfortably and in a manner suitable to his station. The self-imposed
  ostracism on Gervase's part was sheer perversity."</p>

  <p>"And what became of this brother? Is he still living?"</p>

  <p>"His death was announced in the obituary column of The Times about sixteen
  years ago without any address other than Brighton. Of the circumstances of
  his death, nothing whatever is known."</p>

  <p>"Have you any reason to suppose that he made away with himself?"</p>

  <p>"I have not. I mentioned his case merely as an instance of voluntary
  disappearance and generally eccentric behaviour."</p>

  <p>"Exactly; as furnishing a parallel to the voluntary disappearance of
  deceased. That is quite an important point. And now, as a final question, I
  should like to ask you to confirm what the Superintendent told us as to
  deceased having emptied his pockets of things of value before leaving the
  club."</p>

  <p>"The Superintendent's statement is, in the main, correct. When examining
  his bedroom at the club, I found in a locked suit-case&mdash;which I was able
  to unlock&mdash;a gold watch and chain, a valuable pearl tie pin, a bunch of
  keys and a few private letters, which I glanced through and which threw no
  light on his disappearance."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said the coroner, "a very significant proceeding. No doubt it struck
  you so?"</p>

  <p>"It did, coupled with the fact that the owner was missing; and I
  communicated the facts at once to the police."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Very proper. And that, I think, is all that we wish to ask you,
  unless there is anything else that occurs to you or unless the jury desire to
  put any questions."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb intimated that he had nothing further to communicate, and, as
  the jury made no sign, the witness was allowed to retire to his seat.</p>

  <p>The next name called was that of Mr. Northbrook, the secretary of the
  club; but as his evidence for the most part, merely confirmed and amplified
  that of the preceding witnesses, I need not record it in detail. One new
  fact, however, emerged, though it did not seem to me, at the time, to have
  any particular significance.</p>

  <p>"You say," said the coroner, "that you saw deceased leave the club?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was in the porter's office at the time, and, as deceased passed
  the open door, I wished him 'good morning.' But apparently he did not hear
  me, for he passed out without taking any notice."</p>

  <p>"And that, I take it, was actually the last time he is known to have been
  seen alive?</p>

  <p>"Not absolutely the last time. He was seen a few minutes later by one of
  the club waiters, getting into a hansom cab. I have brought the waiter with
  me in case you wished to hear his account first hand."</p>

  <p>"That was very thoughtful of you," said the coroner, "and I am glad you
  did. We should certainly wish to have the evidence of the last person who saw
  deceased alive."</p>

  <p>The waiter was accordingly called and sworn, when it transpired that his
  name was Joseph Wood and that he had mighty little to tell. That little may
  as well, however, be given in his own words.</p>

  <p>"I was coming along Piccadilly from the west when I caught sight of Sir
  Edward Hardcastle, coming towards me. He was a good distance off, but I
  recognised him at once. I wait at the table that he always used, so I knew
  him very well by sight. While I was looking at him, a hansom drew up by the
  pavement and he got in, and then the hansom drove away. I didn't see him hail
  it, but he may have done. I couldn't see if there was anyone else in the cab,
  because its back was towards me, and as soon as he got in it drove away. I
  didn't see him say anything to the cabman, but he may have spoken up through
  the trap. The cab drove off in an easterly direction&mdash;towards the
  Circus. I did not notice the number of the cab. There was no reason why I
  should."</p>

  <p>This was the sum of his evidence, and it was not clear to me why he had
  been brought so far to tell so little, for the trivial circumstance that he
  deposed to appeared to have no bearing whatever on the case; and I was not a
  little surprised to observe that Thorndyke took down his statements,
  apparently verbatim, in short-hand; a proceeding that I could account for
  only by bearing in mind his invariable rule that nothing could be considered
  irrelevant until all the facts were known.</p>

  <p>The waiter, Joseph Wood, was the last of the witnesses, and, when he had
  concluded his evidence, the coroner, having announced that all the known
  facts were now in the jury's possession, made a brief inspection of his notes
  with a view to his summing-up. At length he began: "It is not necessary,
  gentlemen, that I should address you at great length. We have given to this
  painful case an exhaustive consideration which was called for rather by
  reason of the deceased gentleman's position and the interests involved than
  by any inherent difficulties. The case is, in fact, quite a simple one. All
  the material circumstances are known to us, and there is not the slightest
  conflict of evidence. On the contrary, all the witnesses are in complete
  agreement and the evidence of each confirms that of the others.</p>

  <p>"The time at which this sad affair occurred is fixed beyond any possible
  doubt by Mr. Holker's evidence. Deceased must have entered the house, in
  which his body was subsequently found, during the evening or night of Sunday,
  the twenty-first of June; and this date is confirmed by the medical evidence.
  Thus, the questions, When and Where are answered conclusively. Mr. Holker and
  the Superintendent both saw the dead body suspended from a beam; and the
  medical witness found signs of death from asphyxia, as would be expected in
  the case of a man who had died by hanging.</p>

  <p>"The question of motive seems to be solved as completely as we could
  expect by the evidence of Mr. Weeks and especially by that of Mr. Brodribb.
  The terrible bereavement which deceased suffered, the shipwreck of all his
  hopes and ambitions and the desolate state in which he was left, if they
  could not be properly regarded as conditions predisposing to suicide, furnish
  a reasonable explanation of it after the event.</p>

  <p>"There is one feature in the case which did, at first, appear very strange
  and difficult to explain, and which, I may admit, occasioned this very
  rigorous inquiry. That feature is the extraordinary surroundings in which the
  body was discovered. How, one asked oneself, is it possible to account for
  the appearance of a man in deceased's position in an empty house in the
  purlieus of Stratford? It seemed an insoluble mystery. Then came the evidence
  of the Superintendent and Mr. Brodribb. The one finds traces that, to the
  expert eye, tell of ramblings in sordid neighbourhoods and waste places, of
  nights spent in doss-houses or in the open. The other tells us of a
  relative&mdash;actually a brother of deceased&mdash;who, in a strangely
  similar manner, had disappeared from his usual places of resort, cut himself
  off from family and friends and, by deliberate choice, had lived&mdash;and
  perhaps died&mdash;in surroundings of sordid poverty. I will not say that
  this evidence explains the proceedings of deceased. Probably they will never
  be completely explained. But I do say that our knowledge of the brother's
  conduct makes that of deceased perfectly credible.</p>

  <p>"I will add only one further observation. If you find that deceased made
  away with himself, as the evidence seems to prove, I think you will agree
  with me that, at the time and for some days previously, he was not in his
  right mind. If that is your view, I will ask you to embody it in your
  verdict."</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of the coroner's address, the jury consulted together.
  But their consultation occupied only a minute or two. Apparently they had
  already made up their minds, as they might well have done, taking the
  evidence at its face value. When the whispered conference came to an end, the
  foreman announced that they had agreed on their verdict and the coroner then
  put the formal question: "And what is your decision, gentlemen?</p>

  <p>"We find," was the reply, "that deceased committed suicide by hanging
  himself while temporarily insane."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner, "I am in entire agreement with you, and I must
  thank you for the care and attention with which you have considered the
  evidence."</p>

  <p>As the proceedings came to an end, Thorndyke and I rose and made our way
  out, leaving Brodribb in conversation with the coroner and the
  Superintendent.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said as we halted outside to wait for our friend, "it has been
  quite entertaining, but I don't see that we have got much for our
  attendance."</p>

  <p>"We have got one fact, at least," replied Thorndyke, "that was worth
  coming for. We now know that Holker was in the house until after the rain had
  begun to fall. That clears away any uncertainties on a point of vital
  importance. But we had better not discuss the case now. And I
  think&mdash;though it seems rather scurvy treatment of our old
  friend&mdash;but I think we had better keep our own counsel. Brodribb accepts
  the suicide as an established fact, and perhaps it is as well that he should.
  If we are going to work at this case, it will be all to the good that we hold
  the monopoly of the real facts. It will be a difficult and obscure case, but
  the difficulty will be materially reduced if we can watch the development of
  events quietly, without anyone suspecting that we are watching. This was no
  crime of sudden impulse. It was premeditated and arranged. Obviously there
  was, behind it, some perfectly definite motive. We have, among other things,
  to discover what that motive was. The criminals at present believe themselves
  to be entirely unsuspected. If they maintain that belief, they will feel at
  liberty to pursue their purpose without any special precautions; and
  we&mdash;also unsuspected&mdash;may get our chance. But here comes
  Brodribb."</p>

  <p>I must confess that Thorndyke's observations appeared to me so cryptic as
  to convey no meaning whatever. That, I recognised, was owing to my own
  'slowness in the uptake'. However, there was no opportunity to seek
  elucidation, for Brodribb had seen us and was now bearing down on us. He
  replied to our greeting with something less than his usual vivacity, and we
  set forth on our way to the station in almost uninterrupted silence.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>X. &mdash; A SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE</h2>

  <h3>(DR. JERVIS'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. BRODRIBB'S taciturn mood persisted even after we had
  taken possession of an empty first-class smoking compartment and lit our
  pipes. Evidently his recent experiences had depressed him profoundly; which,
  after all, was no matter for surprise. An inquest is not a jovial function
  under the most favourable conditions, and the conditions in the recent
  inquiry had been far from favourable for the friends of the deceased.</p>

  <p>"It was a ghoulish business," he remarked in semi-apologetic explanation
  of his low spirits, "but, of course, it had to be; and the coroner managed it
  as decently as possible. Still, I had rather that he had managed without
  me."</p>

  <p>"If he had," said I, "he would have missed what he regarded as most
  important evidence."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," replied Brodribb. "That was what I felt, though I hated
  giving that evidence. The affair had to be cleared up, and I have no doubt
  that the jury were right in their verdict. I know you don't agree with me,
  Thorndyke, but I think your special experience has misled you for once."</p>

  <p>"There is always the possibility," Thorndyke admitted, "that professional
  bias may influence one. In any case, our divergence of views does not affect
  the position in practice. The death of Sir Edward is an established fact and
  the ambiguity of your legal status is at an end."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Brodribb agreed, "there is that very unsatisfactory compensation. I
  am now the executor and can act as I think best. I could only wish that the
  best course of action were a little more easy to decide on."</p>

  <p>With this, he relapsed into silent reflection, possibly connected with the
  difficulties suggested by his last sentence; and as Thorndyke and I were
  unable to discuss before him the matters that were occupying our thoughts, we
  followed his example and devoted ourselves to the consideration of our own
  affairs.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Brodribb sat up with a start and began to rummage in his inside
  breast-pocket. "Bless my soul!" he exclaimed. "What a fool I am! Clean forgot
  this. Ought to have mentioned it in my evidence."</p>

  <p>Here he brought out a letter wallet, and, taking from it an envelope,
  opened the latter and tipped some small object out on to his palm.</p>

  <p>"There!" he said, holding out his open hand to Thorndyke. "What do you
  think of that?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke picked up the object, and, having examined it, held it up to the
  light, when I saw that it was a little oval plate of a bright transparent
  green bearing an engraved device which I recognised instantly.</p>

  <p>"The missing seal!" I exclaimed, taking it from Thorndyke to inspect it
  more closely. "Then we may assume that the great mystery is solved."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, you may assume nothing of the kind," said Brodribb. "On the
  contrary, the mystery is more profound than ever and the chance of a solution
  more remote. I will tell you all about it&mdash;all that I know, that is to
  say. It is a queer story. Your friend, Superintendent Miller, brought it to
  me yesterday afternoon to compare with my seals and for formal identification
  by me (which I thought very kind and courteous of him), and this is the
  account he gave of its discovery.</p>

  <p>"It seems that, about a week ago, a man escaped from Pentonville Gaol. I
  understand that he got away in the evening, and in some miraculous
  fashion&mdash;you know where the prison is; right in the middle of a populous
  neighbourhood&mdash;he kept out of sight until it was dark, which wouldn't
  have been much before eleven at this time of year. Then, with the same
  miraculous luck, he managed to slip away through the streets, right across
  the northern suburbs to the neighbourhood of Temple Mills by the River
  Lea.</p>

  <p>"There he was lurking the next afternoon when he had another stroke of
  luck. Some devotee of the simple life had elected to take a bath in the
  river, and he must have strayed away some distance from his clothes, for our
  Pentonville sportsman found them unguarded. Possibly he may have watched the
  other sportsman taking them off. At any rate, he seized the opportunity;
  slipped off the prison clothes and popped on the others. Then he nipped off
  across the meadows in the direction of Tottenham. And there it was that his
  luck deserted him; for, by the merest chance, a plain clothes officer who
  knew him by sight, happened to meet him, and, as the hue and cry was out, he
  collared him forthwith.</p>

  <p>"And now comes one of the quaint features of the story. At Tottenham
  Police Station they went through his pockets&mdash;they were really the other
  fellow's, of course&mdash;with mighty little result. The next day they took
  him back to Pentonville, and once more he was put into uniform. The clothes
  that were taken off him were put aside until they could be disposed of in
  some way. But a couple of days ago it occurred to one of the officers to go
  over them carefully to see if he could find out the lawful owner. And then he
  made a discovery. Apparently, the owner of those clothes was a pickpocket,
  for there was a secret receptacle in the back of the waistcoat, which had
  been overlooked at the first search; and in that secret pocket the officer
  found this stone."</p>

  <p>"And what happened to the other man?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" chuckled Brodribb, quite recovering his natural spirits for the time
  being, "that's the cream of the joke. He found the gaol-bird's discarded
  garments in place of his own clothes and of course he had to put 'em on,
  since he couldn't go about naked. It was a lovely situation; almost as if he
  had walked into prison and locked himself in. However, as soon as he was
  dressed in his proper character, he made a bolt for it; and he had even
  better luck than the other fellow. In some perfectly incredible manner, he
  made his way, in broad daylight, right across North London and came to the
  surface at the Angel, of all unlikely places."</p>

  <p>"At the Angel!" I repeated, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"At the Angel," Brodribb reiterated, joyously. "Just picture to yourselves
  an escaped convict in full uniform, elbowing his way through the crowd at the
  Angel! Well, of course, it couldn't go on. A couple of plain-clothes men saw
  him and pounced on him in an instant. It looked as if his luck had given out.
  But apparently his wits were as nimble as his heels, for he got just a dog's
  chance and he took it. At the moment when the two constables were taking him
  across the road, a fire-engine came thundering along and they had to scuttle
  back out of the way. But as it flew past, our friend made a grab at the rail
  of the foot-plate and held on. The momentum of the engine whisked him out of
  the clutches of his captors and sent them sprawling; and when they got up,
  their prisoner was standing on the foot-plate and fading in the distance
  before their eyes. Of course, it is no use shouting after a fire-engine.</p>

  <p>"Now the odd thing is," Mr. Brodribb continued in a slightly shaky voice,
  "that none of the fire-men on the engine seem to have noticed him; and the
  constables couldn't telephone a warning until they had found out where the
  fire was. So our friend stuck on the engine until it turned down Tottenham
  Court Road, when he hopped off and made a bolt down Warren Street. Naturally,
  he soon picked up some followers, but he kept ahead of them, flying up one
  street and down another until he arrived at Cleveland Mews with half the town
  at his heels. He turned into the mews, still well ahead, and shot down it
  like a rocket. And that was the last that was seen of him. The crowd and the
  police surged in after him, and as the mews is a blind alley, they were quite
  cocksure that they'd got him. But when they came to the blind end, there was
  not a sign of him. He had vanished into thin air. And he had vanished for
  good, you observe. For, as nobody knew who he was, nobody could identify him
  when once he had changed his clothes."</p>

  <p>"No," I agreed, "he has got clear away, and I must admit that I think he
  deserved to."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I agree with you," said Brodribb. "Very improper for a
  lawyer, but even lawyers are human. But the police were very puzzled; not
  only as to how he had managed to escape, but, when the real convict was
  captured, they couldn't make out why he ran away. Of course, when the seal
  was found in the pocket, they understood."</p>

  <p>"I wonder how he did get away," said I.</p>

  <p>"So do I," said Brodribb. "It was a remarkable exploit. I examined the
  place myself and could see no apparent way of escape."</p>

  <p>"You examined the place?" I exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I forgot to mention that, by a remarkable coincidence, I happened to
  be there at the very time. I took Sir Giles Farnaby to see a client of mine
  who has a studio that fronts on the mews. When we arrived the police were
  actually searching the studio. They thought the fugitive might have got in at
  the open window, unnoticed by the two ladies who were at work there. So they
  went all over the premises. Just as well for our friend that they did; for
  while they were searching the studio premises he had time to make his little
  arrangements at the bottom of the mews. And now we shall never know how he
  came by that seal, though, as he seems to have been a pickpocket, we can make
  a pretty likely guess."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed a little dryly, "it is always possible to guess.
  But guesses are not very valuable evidential assets. The police guessed that
  this man was a pickpocket, and we can guess that, being a pickpocket, he
  obtained the seal in the practice of his art. That guess is supported by the
  fact that the ring is the only article known to be missing from his person,
  and that the leather case in which it was usually carried, is also missing.
  On the other hand, it is not in agreement with the fact that the stone had
  been dismounted from the ring and that the ring was not found with it. The
  pickpocket usually takes his booty to the receiver as he finds it. It is the
  receiver who extracts the stones and melts down the metal. That is the usual
  procedure, but, naturally, there are exceptions."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said Brodribb, "what matters to us is that the man has
  vanished and no one knows who he is."</p>

  <p>On this conclusion neither Thorndyke nor I made any comment, and the
  discussion was brought to an end by our arrival at Liverpool Street, where we
  saw Mr. Brodribb into a hansom and then embarked in another for the
  Temple.</p>

  <p>During the meal which we found awaiting us at our chambers, I endeavoured
  to extract from Thorndyke some elucidation of the statement that had seemed
  to me so obscure. But he was not willing to enter into details at
  present.</p>

  <p>"The position at the moment, Jervis," said he, "is this. We have no doubt
  whatever that Sir Edward Hardcastle was murdered. We have evidence that the
  murder was premeditated and the methods planned in advance with considerable
  care and some ingenuity. It was carried out by more than one, and probably
  several persons. It was, in fact, of the nature of a conspiracy. The purpose
  of the murder was not robbery from the person. The perpetrators, or at least
  some of them, were apparently of a low class, socially; and the victim seems
  to have walked, not entirely unsuspecting, into some sort of ambush.</p>

  <p>"That is all that we know at present, and it doesn't carry us far. What we
  have to discover, if we can, is the identity of the murderers. If we can do
  that, the motive will disclose itself. If, on the other hand, we can uncover
  the motive, that will probably point to the murderers. We must proceed along
  both lines if we can. We must endeavour cautiously to ascertain whether Sir
  Edward had any enemies who might conceivably have been capable of a crime of
  revenge; and we must watch the consequences of his death and note who
  benefits by them."</p>

  <p>"It is evident," said I, "that someone is going to benefit to the extent
  of a title and an uncommonly valuable estate."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and we shall bear that in mind. But we mustn't attach undue weight
  to it. Whenever a well-to-do person is murdered, the heirs benefit; but that
  fact&mdash;though it furnishes a conceivable motive&mdash;does not cast
  suspicion on them in the absence of any other evidence. In practice, as you
  know, I like to leave the question of motive until I have got a lead in some
  definite direction. It is much safer. The premature consideration of motive
  may be very misleading, whereas its use as corroboration may be
  invaluable."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I realise that," said I, "but in this case I don't see how you are
  going to get a lead. The murderers left plenty of traces of a kind; but they
  were the wrong kind. There was nothing personal about them&mdash;unless the
  finger-prints can be identified, and I doubt if they can. They were very
  confused and obscure. And even if they could be made out, they would be of no
  use unless they were the prints of criminals known to the police and recorded
  at the register."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed grimly. "My learned friend," he remarked, "is not
  disposed to be encouraging. But never mind. We have made many a worse start
  and yet reached our goal. Presently we will examine our material and see what
  it has to tell us. Perhaps we may get a lead in some direction from an
  unexpected source."</p>

  <p>At the actual examination I was not present, for our expeditions to
  Stratford had left me with one or two unfulfilled engagements. Accordingly,
  as soon as we had finished our supper (or dinner&mdash;the exact status of
  our evening meal was not clearly defined), I went forth to despatch one of
  them, my regret tempered by the consideration that I should miss nothing but
  the mere manipulations, most of which were now fairly familiar to me, and
  that on my return I should find most of the work done and the results
  available.</p>

  <p>And so it turned out. Re-entering our chambers about half-past ten and
  finding the sitting-room untenanted, I made my way up to the laboratory where
  a glance around told me that the final stage of the investigation had been
  reached. On one bench was a microscope and a row of slides, each bearing a
  temporary or permanent label; on the chemical bench a sand-bath stood over a
  bunsen burner and bore a small glass evaporating dish, and one or two large
  watch-glasses containing fluid with a crystalline margin had apparently had
  their turn on the bath. Beside them in a beaker of fluid&mdash;presumably
  water&mdash;was the collar that had been abstracted from the mortuary by
  Thorndyke, who was at the moment gently prodding it with a glass rod, while
  his familiar demon, Polton, was engaged in vigorously wringing out the end of
  rope in a basin of hot liquid which exhaled the unmistakable aroma of soft
  soap.</p>

  <p>"We have nearly finished," said Thorndyke, "and we haven't done so badly,
  considering that this is only the beginning of our investigation. Have a look
  at the specimens and see if you agree with the findings."</p>

  <p>I went over to the microscope bench and ran my eye over the exhibits. As I
  did so, I was once more impressed by the wonderfully simple, orderly and
  efficient plan on which my colleague worked. For years past, indeed, from the
  very earliest days of his practice, it had been his habit to collect
  impartially examples of every kind of natural and artificial material and to
  make, wherever it was practicable, permanent microscopic preparations of
  each. The result was an immense and carefully classified collection of minute
  objects of all kinds&mdash;hairs, feather insect scales, diatoms, pollen,
  seeds, powders, starches, textiles, threads, fibres&mdash;any one of which
  could be found in a moment and used for comparison with any new 'find', the
  nature of which had to be determined. Thus he was, to a great extent,
  independent of books of reference and had the great advantage of being able
  to submit both the new specimen and the 'standard' to any kind of test with
  the micrometer or polariscope or otherwise.</p>

  <p>In the present case, the specimens were laid out in pairs, the new,
  unknown specimen with a 'certified' example from the collection; and an
  eye-piece micrometer was in position for comparing dimensions. I took up one
  slide, labelled 'E. H. decd. 15. 7. 03. From Rt. Bronchus', and placed it on
  the stage of the microscope. Instantly the nature of the object became
  obvious. It was a fish-scale; but, of course, I could not say what fish. Then
  I laid on the stage the companion slide from the collection, labelled 'Scale
  of Herring', and made a rough comparison. In the shape of the margins, the
  concentric and radiating markings and all other characters, the two specimens
  appeared to be identical. I did not make an exhaustive examination, assuming
  that this had been done by Thorndyke, but went on to the other specimens. All
  the fish-scales were alike, as might have been expected, and I gave them only
  a passing glance. Then I picked up a slide labelled 'From Trachea' and placed
  it on the stage. The specimen appeared to be a small piece of a leaf of some
  kind; a rather large leaf, as I judged by the absence of any indication of
  form, and by its thickness, and I observed that it seemed to have one cut
  edge.</p>

  <p>Taking up the 'reference' slide I read, 'Cuticle of Cabbage'.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember this scrap of leaf, Thorndyke," said I.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "I did not draw Ross's attention to it. It was wearisome
  to keep pointing out facts to a man who had already made up his mind. It
  seems to be a fragment of cabbage leaf, but it is of no special importance.
  The fish-scales prove the entrance of water to the lungs, which is the really
  significant fact."</p>

  <p>"And this little melted fragment from the heel of the boot? It doesn't
  look like soap."</p>

  <p>"It isn't. It is beeswax. I put that fragment on the slide to observe the
  melting-point."</p>

  <p>The other two specimens were the scraps of cotton and silk thread that we
  had picked off the clothes. The silk thread was clearly shown, by comparison
  with the 'reference specimen' to be a fragment of 'buttonhole twist'. The
  white cotton corresponded exactly with a reference specimen of basting
  cotton; but here the identification was less certain owing to the less
  distinctive character of the thread.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed when I remarked upon this, "white cotton threads
  are a good deal alike, but I haven't much doubt that this is basting cotton.
  Still, I shall take the specimens to a trimmings-dealer and get an expert
  opinion."</p>

  <p>"Have you made any analysis of the fluids from the stomach and lungs?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "only a preliminary test. But I think that has given us
  the essential facts, though as a measure of safety, I shall have a complete
  examination made. What I find is that both fluids contain a considerable
  amount of sodium chloride. They appear to be, and I have no doubt are, just
  simply salt water. We can't tell how salt the water was when it was swallowed
  and drawn into the lungs owing to the drying that had occurred in the body.
  But the salt is there, and that is the important point."</p>

  <p>"You haven't yet tested the water in which you have soaked the
  collar?"</p>

  <p>"No. We will do that now."</p>

  <p>He poured a little of the water from the beaker in which the collar had
  been soaking, through a filter into a test-tube. Then, with a pipette, he
  dipped up a small quantity of a solution of silver nitrate from a bottle and
  let it fall, drop by drop, into the test-tube. As each drop fell into the
  clear liquid it gave rise to a little milky cloud, which became denser with
  each succeeding drop.</p>

  <p>"Chloride of some kind," I observed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he, "and we may take it, provisionally, that it is sodium
  chloride. And that finishes our preliminary examination of our material. Have
  you got that rope clean, Polton?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied Polton, producing the end of rope from a towel in
  which he had been squeezing the last remains of moisture from it. "It is
  quite clean, but a good deal of the colour has come out. I think you are
  right, sir. It looks like cutch."</p>

  <p>He exhibited the discoloured water in the basin and handed the piece of
  rope to Thorndyke, who passed it to me.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "I see now that it is a hemp rope. But it is odd that they
  should have been at the trouble of dyeing it to imitate coir, which is an
  inferior rope to hemp."</p>

  <p>He made no reply, but seemed to look at me attentively as I turned the
  rope over in my hand, and finally took it from me without remark. I had the
  feeling that he had expected me to make some observation, and I wondered
  vaguely what it might have been. Also, I wondered a little at his interest in
  the physical characters of this rope, which really seemed to have no bearing
  on our inquiry; and even as I wondered, I had an uneasy suspicion that I had
  missed some significant point.</p>

  <p>"How have the photographs come out?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen them yet," he replied. "They are in Polton's province.
  What do you say, Polton? Is it possible to inspect them?"</p>

  <p>"The enlargements are now washing," Polton replied. "I'll fetch them in
  for you to see."</p>

  <p>He went through into the dark room and presently returned with four
  porcelain dishes, each containing a half-plate bromide print, which he laid
  down on the bench under the shaded light. All the four prints were
  enlargements to the same scale&mdash;about three times the natural linear
  size.</p>

  <p>"Well," I remarked, as we looked them over together, "Sir Edward's
  finger-prints are clear enough, though they look a little odd, but the
  chair-back groups are a most unholy muddle. Most of the prints are just
  undecipherable smears."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke admitted regretfully, "they are a poor lot and too many
  superimposed and obliterating one another. But, still, I have some hopes. Our
  expert friends are wonderfully clever at sorting out imperfect prints; and
  some of these seem to me to have enough visible detail for identification. At
  any rate, one important negative fact can, I think, be established. I see no
  print that seems to resemble any of Sir Edward's."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I; and, of course, if they were there, they would be more
  distinct than any of the others, being the most recent. But it would be a
  facer if the experts should find them there. That would fairly knock the
  bottom out of the entire case."</p>

  <p>"It would, certainly," Thorndyke agreed. "But the probability is so
  negligibly remote that it is not worth considering. What is of much more
  interest is the chance of their being able to identify some of the prints as
  those of known criminals."</p>

  <p>"Supposing they can?" said I. "What then?"</p>

  <p>"In that case," he replied, "I think we should have to take Miller into
  our confidence. You see, Jervis, that our present difficulty is that we are
  dealing with a crime in the abstract, so to speak. The perpetrators are
  unknown to us. We have&mdash;at the moment&mdash;no clue whatever to their
  identity. But give us a name; turn our unknown criminals into actual, known
  persons, and I think we have enough evidence to secure a conviction. At any
  rate, a very little corroboration by police investigation would make the case
  complete."</p>

  <p>"The deuce it would!" I exclaimed, completely taken aback. "I had no idea
  that the case had advanced as far as that. I thought it was rather a matter
  of strong suspicion than of definite evidence. But evidently your examination
  of the material has brought some new facts to light. Is it not so?"</p>

  <p>"We have elicited a few new facts; nothing very startling, however. But
  the evidence emerges when we put together, in their proper order, the facts
  that we already knew with the new ones added. Shall we go over the evidence
  together and see what we really know about the case?"</p>

  <p>I assented with enthusiasm, and, having filled my pipe, disposed myself in
  the rather ascetic laboratory chair in a posture of attention and
  receptivity; and I noticed that Polton had unobtrusively drawn a stool up to
  the opposite bench, and, having stuck a watchmaker's glass into his eye, was
  making a shameless pretence of exploring the 'innards' of an invalid carriage
  clock.</p>

  <p>"Let us begin," said Thorndyke, "by taking the evidence in order without
  going into much detail. In the first place we have established that Sir
  Edward Hardcastle was drowned in salt water in which considerable numbers of
  herring-scales were suspended."</p>

  <p>"You think there is no doubt about the drowning?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is practically certain," he replied. "The presence in the
  lungs of salt water and herring-scales, together with the presence of similar
  salt-water and herring-scales in the stomach is nearly conclusive. That the
  herring-scales were water-borne and not the remains of food eaten is proved
  by our finding them in the hair. Add to this the fairly definite signs of
  asphyxia and no signs of any other cause of death; and the fact that
  deceased's head and neck had been immersed in salt water containing suspended
  herring-scales, as proved by the scales which you found in the hair, by the
  stains on the neck of his shirt and on his collar and by the salt which I
  extracted from that collar; and I think we have very complete and conclusive
  evidence of drowning."</p>

  <p>"I agree," said I. "Excuse my interrupting."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he replied. "I want you to challenge the evidence if you do
  not find it convincing. To proceed; we find that, Sir Edward's body, dead or
  alive, had been lying on, and apparently dragged along, the dirty floor of a
  room. Among the litter on that floor were short pieces of basting-cotton and
  button-hole twist and a fragment of beeswax. These materials suggest a room
  in which garments were being made; probably a tailor's work-room, though
  other people besides tailors use these materials.</p>

  <p>"Next we find that the body was conveyed in a two-wheeled vehicle, which
  may have been a cart or gig, or perhaps a hansom cab&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Surely not a hansom, Thorndyke," I interrupted. "It had iron tyres."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't absolutely exclude it," said he. "You occasionally meet with
  iron-tired hansoms even to this day. I saw one at Fenchurch Street Station
  only a few weeks ago&mdash;a shabby old crock with the old-fashioned,
  round-backed dickey, probably driven by the owner. The reason that I incline
  to the hansom is that the dimensions of this vehicle coincide exactly with
  those of a hansom. I looked them up in my notes on the dimensions of various
  vehicles. The wheels of a hansom are fifty-five and a half inches in
  diameter. The tyres, when of iron, are one and a half inches wide, on a rim
  which is slightly thicker and which widens inwards towards the spokes. The
  track, or distance between the wheels, measured at the ground level from the
  outer edge of one tyre to the outer edge of the other, is fifty-seven inches.
  Now, these are exactly the dimensions that we noted in our measurements of
  the track of the unknown vehicle. It isn't by any means conclusive, but we
  are bound to take note of the coincidence."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed," I assented. "It is a decidedly striking coincidence; a sort
  of Bertillon measurement, at least so it appears, though I don't know to what
  extent the dimensions of vehicles are standardised."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said he, "we note the possibility that this vehicle may
  have been a hansom cab; and whatever it was, it served to convey the body of
  Sir Edward to Five Piper's Row on Sunday, the twenty-first of June, at some
  time in the evening or night, but most probably between eleven and twelve.
  The body was carried into the house by at least two persons, one of whom
  appears to have been a waterside or sea-faring person."</p>

  <p>"Is it clearly established that there was more than one person?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. There were at least two sets of muddy foot-marks&mdash;and
  apparently only two&mdash;on the floor leading from the front door to the
  kitchen. They were not Holker's, for he arrived with dry feet; they were
  certainly not Sir Edward's, as we know from the state of his shoes, apart
  from the ascertained fact that he was dead when he was taken into the house.
  There were undoubtedly two men; and we can take it that neither of them was
  the driver of the vehicle since that made merely a pause at the house and not
  a prolonged stay.</p>

  <p>"The body, then, was carried into the house by these two persons, one of
  whom&mdash;probably the nautical person&mdash;had brought with him a piece of
  rope which had been cut off a longer complete rope and which bears visible
  evidence of having been stolen."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by visible evidence?" I demanded. "Surely a rope which
  has been stolen is not visibly different from any other rope! The act of
  stealing a rope does not impress on it any new distinguishable
  properties."</p>

  <p>"That is true," he admitted; "and yet it may be possible to recognise a
  stolen rope by its visible properties. Did you ever hear of a 'rogue's'
  yarn?</p>

  <p>"Not to my knowledge."</p>

  <p>"It is a device that used formerly to be employed in the Navy to check the
  stealing of cordage. Every rope that was made in the Royal Dockyards had one
  yarn in one of the strands which was different from all the others. It was
  twisted in reverse, and, if the rope was a white rope, the rogue's yarn was
  tarred, while in a tarred rope the tell-tale yarn was left white. Later, the
  special yarn was replaced by a single coloured worsted thread, which was spun
  into the middle of a yarn and so was not visible externally, but only at the
  cut end. This was a better device, as each dockyard had its own colour, so
  that when a stolen rope was discovered it could be seen at once which
  dockyard it belonged to.</p>

  <p>"But the plan of marking rope in this way is not confined to the Navy.
  Many public, and even private bodies which use rope, have it made up with
  some distinctive mark&mdash;usually a coloured thread in one of the yarns.
  And that happens to be the case with this particular rope. It is a marked
  rope; evidently the property of some public or private body." He took the
  washed 'specimen' from the bench, and, handing it to me, continued: "You see
  this is a four-strand rope, and in two of the strands is a yarn in which has
  been twisted a coloured cotton thread, a red thread in the one and a green
  thread in the other."</p>

  <p>I examined the little length of rope closely, and, now that I had been
  told, the coloured threads were easy enough to see, though only at the cut
  ends. Now, too, I understood Thorndyke's intense interest in the rope. But
  there was another thing that I did not understand at all.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, "that it was these coloured threads that made you
  give so much attention to this rope?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," he replied; "and you must admit that they were calculated
  to attract attention."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, I do. But what puzzles me is how you came to see them at all.
  They are extremely inconspicuous, and must have been still more so before the
  rope was cleaned."</p>

  <p>"There is no mystery about that," said he. "I saw them because I looked
  for them. You remember that you&mdash;like the Superintendent&mdash;took this
  rope for a coir rope. So did I, at first. Then I saw that the texture did not
  agree with the colour; that it was really a hempen rope dyed to imitate coir.
  Then I asked myself the question that you asked just now: Why should anyone
  dye a hemp rope to imitate the less valuable coir? The natural suggestion was
  that the rope had been disguised to cover unlawful possession. It was
  probably a stolen rope. This idea suggested the possibility that it might be
  a marked rope. Accordingly I carefully examined the cut end, and behold! the
  two coloured threads; very inconspicuous, as you inferred, but visible enough
  when looked for."</p>

  <p>"But this is a very important fact, Thorndyke," said I.</p>

  <p>"It is," he agreed. "It is by far the most valuable clue that we hold. In
  fact, if the finger-prints fail us, it is the only clue that leads away from
  generalities to a definite place and set of surroundings. We shall almost
  certainly be able to trace this rope to the place from which it was stolen,
  and that alone will tell us something of the person who stole it."</p>

  <p>"Mighty little," said I.</p>

  <p>"Probably. But if we are able to add only a little to what we know, that
  little may be very illuminating."</p>

  <p>"What do we know about these men?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I should have said 'infer' rather than 'know'; but our inferences
  are fairly safe. First, we find a person evidently accustomed to handling
  cordage, and probably a seaman or waterside character; a person, probably the
  same, who has a stolen rope in his possession; a person who is in some way
  connected with a tailor's work-room or some similar establishment; and a
  person who uses, drives and probably owns some two-wheeled vehicle, either a
  gig, a light cart or possibly a hansom cab, and if the latter, an old cab,
  probably in poor condition and distinguished by the unusual character of iron
  tyres. Then there is the choice of Piper's Row. The selection of this
  particular house could hardly have been made by a complete stranger. It
  suggests a person with some knowledge of the place and of its usually
  undisturbed condition. Assuming the object to be the disposal of the body in
  some place where it would not be discovered until all traces of the
  crime&mdash;of the actual method of the murder&mdash;had disappeared, the
  hiding-place was extraordinarily well chosen. But for the mere accident of
  Holker's picking out this house for repairs, the body might have remained
  undiscovered for months and the plan have succeeded perfectly."</p>

  <p>"It has succeeded pretty perfectly as it is," said I, "so far as the
  coroner and the police are concerned."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But in another month the cause of death would have been completely
  unascertainable. But you notice that however long the interval might have
  been, the body would still have been identifiable by the contents of the
  pockets and the marking of the clothes. That seems to be worth noting."</p>

  <p>"You mean that the intention was that the body should ultimately be
  identified?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that there was no attempt to conceal the identity. The
  significance of that&mdash;such as it is&mdash;lies in the fact that in an
  ordinary murder the safety of the murderers is much greater if the identity
  of the murdered person is unknown, since, in that case, the police usually
  have nothing to indicate the identity of the murderer. But I doubt if there
  is much in it. The intention evidently was, in this case, that the death
  should not be recognised as a murder at all."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and they were very near to bringing it off. In fact, they have
  brought it off so far. They are still very decidedly birds in the bush. And
  the inquest was an absolute walk-over for them. All the evidence seemed to
  point to suicide, and that of Weeks and Brodribb must have been most
  convincing to people who already had a bias in that direction. By the way,
  did you pick up anything from the evidence besides that statement of
  Holker's?</p>

  <p>"Nothing very definite," he replied. "There were certain hints and
  suggestions in the evidence of Weeks and in that of Joseph Wood, the waiter.
  Weeks, you remember, had evidently had the feeling that there was something
  unusual in the air when Sir Edward started from home that morning; and Wood
  seemed to me to have the impression that there was someone in the cab which
  drew up for Sir Edward to enter. He didn't say so, in fact he said that he
  did not know, but he mentioned pointedly that he did not see Sir Edward hail
  the cab or give any directions to the driver. Taking what was implied rather
  than stated by these two witnesses, there seems to be a suggestion that one,
  at least, of the murderers was known to Sir Edward; and the fact that he went
  away in a hansom, whether alone or with some other person, is certainly
  significant as pointing to a definite destination. It is quite inconsistent
  with the Superintendent's suggestion of aimless wandering.</p>

  <p>"But we are straying away into a consideration of the general aspects of
  the case. To come back to the question that we were discussing, you see now
  what our position is at the moment. If Miller can give us the name of a
  person who has handled that chair at Piper's Row, we can give him sufficient
  information to enable him to put that person on trial for murder. Of course
  he would not do so off-hand. Before he moved, he would fill in detail and
  seek corroborative evidence. But there would be very little doubt of the
  result.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, if Miller cannot produce a known person, we shall be
  left with a very complete case of murder against some persons unknown. Then
  it will be our task to convert those unknown persons into known persons; and
  to do that we shall need to acquire some further facts."</p>

  <p>There were some other points that I should have liked to raise. But
  Thorndyke's very definite conclusion seemed to put an end to the discussion;
  so much so that Polton threw off all pretence, and, removing the eyeglass
  from his eye, deliberately carried the clock to a cupboard and there
  deposited it as a thing that had served its purpose.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-11"
     id="ch-11"></a>XI. &mdash; ASHDOD REVISITED</h2>

  <h3>(JASPER GRAY'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">A GOOD old proverb assures us that we may be sure our sins
  will find us out. I will not make the customary facetious commentary on this
  proposition. That joke has now worn rather thin. But the idiotic booby-trap
  that I set for poor old Ponty, rebounding on me again and again like a
  self-acting, perpetual motion boomerang, illustrated the proverb admirably,
  while the encounter on my very doorstep with a dry-faced, plain-clothes
  policeman, illustrated the joke. Most inopportunely, my sins had found me at
  home.</p>

  <p>He must have had a description of me for he addressed me tentatively by
  name. I acknowledged my identity and he then explained his business.</p>

  <p>"It's about that counterfeit half-crown that your father passed by
  mistake. I want to know, as well as you can remember, how it came into your
  possession."</p>

  <p>Now, of course I ought to have told him all I knew. I realised that. But
  my recollections of Mr. Ebbstein's establishment were so exceedingly
  unpleasant that I boggled at the idea of being any further mixed up with it.
  And then there was Miss Stella. I couldn't endure the thought of having her
  name dragged into a disreputable affair of this sort. Wherefore I temporised
  and evaded.</p>

  <p>"The man who gave it to me was a complete stranger," said I.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said the officer. "You didn't hear his name by any
  chance?"</p>

  <p>"I heard another man call him 'Jim'."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's something, though it doesn't carry us very far. But how came
  he to give it to you? Was it payment?"</p>

  <p>I described the transaction with literal truth up to the point of the
  delivery of the coin but said nothing of the subsequent events. I think he
  must have been a rather inexperienced officer, for he assumed that the
  payment concluded the business and that I then came away. I didn't say
  so.</p>

  <p>"You took the case up in Mansell Street. Do you remember what number?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I remember the house. It was on the right-hand side, going from
  the High Street, just past a tobacconist's shop&mdash;next door, in fact. The
  shop had a figure of a Red Indian on a bracket outside."</p>

  <p>He entered this statement in a large, black-covered note-book and then
  asked: "You took the case to Byles's Wharf, you say. Whereabouts is that?
  Isn't it somewhere down Wapping way?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, this end of Wapping."</p>

  <p>"And do you think you would know the man again?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure I should."</p>

  <p>He noted this down and reflected awhile. But having missed all the really
  relevant questions, he didn't seem able to think of any others. Accordingly,
  after a spell of profound thought, he put his note-book away and closed the
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>I went on my way greatly relieved at having, as I hoped, at last shaken
  myself free of that accursed make-believe, but yet by no means satisfied with
  my conduct of the affair. I knew that, as a good citizen, I ought to have
  told him about 'Chonas', and my default rankled in my bosom and again
  illustrated the proverb by haunting me in all my comings and goings. But the
  oddest effect of the working of my conscience was to develop in me a most
  inconsistent hankering to make my incriminating knowledge more complete. I
  became possessed by an unreasonable urge to revisit the scene of my
  adventure, to go down again into Ashdod, and turn my confused recollections
  into definite knowledge.</p>

  <p>The opportunity came unexpectedly. I had to deliver a parcel of stationery
  at an office appertaining to a large warehouse in Commercial Road East. It
  was a heavy parcel, but not heavy enough to demand the use of the truck. I
  carried it on my shoulder, and when I had at length dumped it down in the
  outer office and taken my receipt for it, I was free and unencumbered. And
  the weight of the parcel seemed to justify me in taking a little time off to
  spend on my own affairs.</p>

  <p>As I strolled back along Commercial Road East, I kept a sharp look-out for
  landmarks of that memorable journey with the hansom. Presently I came to the
  corner of Sidney Street, which I remembered having passed on that occasion,
  and which gave me what mariners call a "departure." I turned back, eastward,
  and, taking the first turning on the right (southerly), left the broad
  thoroughfare behind and entered a maze of small streets. They were rather
  bewildering. But it is difficult thoroughly to bewilder a seasoned Londoner
  who is accustomed to wandering about the town on foot (people who ride in
  conveyances don't count. They never become real Londoners). Presently I came
  to a corner which was marked at the kerb by an angular granite corner-stone.
  I remembered that stone. I had reason to (and so had the owner of the cab).
  Taking a fresh departure from it, I soon arrived at a little street at the
  end of which was a seedy-looking public-house distinguished by the sign of a
  lion and an inscription in Hebrew characters which suggested that the royal
  beast aforesaid was none other than the Lion of Judah.</p>

  <p>I now had my bearings. This was the place where I had found and purloined
  the hansom. Just round the corner was the empty house from which Miss Stella
  and I had dropped down into the court. That was the last house in the street
  which I had come to identify, the street which was made illustrious by the
  residence therein of Mr. Ebbstein and his tenant, the ingenious 'Chonas', to
  say nothing of the old villain whom I had knocked on the head.</p>

  <p>I sauntered round the corner, keeping my eyes skinned (as our packer would
  have expressed it) but carefully avoiding any outward manifestation of
  interest. The illustrious street I learned from a half-illegible name-plate
  rejoiced in the romantic name of Pentecost Grove. Strolling along it, I took
  in the numbers&mdash;where there were any&mdash;with the tail of my eye,
  keeping account of them, since so many were missing, until I arrived exactly
  opposite the mews, or stable-yard, which I had seen from the window of my
  prison. Thereby I learned that Mr. Ebbstein resided at Number Forty-nine, and
  the person whose cranium I had damaged was to be found&mdash;if still
  extant&mdash;at Number Fifty.</p>

  <p>If I had been content with this enlargement of my knowledge and taken
  myself off, all would have been well. But at this point, my intelligent
  interest over powered my caution. The stable-yard opposite, bearing the
  superscription, 'Zion Place', yawned invitingly and offered an alluring
  glimpse of a hansom cab, horseless and apparently in dry dock. I couldn't
  resist that hansom cab. Without doubt, it was the identical hansom with which
  I had scattered the howling and blaspheming denizens of Ashdod. Of course, it
  didn't matter a 'snide' half-crown whether it was or not. But I was sensible
  of an idiotic impulse to examine it and try to verify its identity.
  Accordingly I crossed the street and sauntered idly into Zion Place,
  gradually edging towards the object of my curiosity.</p>

  <p>It was an extraordinarily shabby old vehicle and seemed to be dropping to
  pieces from sheer senile decay. But it wasn't really. The actual robustness
  of its old age was demonstrated by the near wheel, which memory impelled me
  to inspect narrowly. On the rim including the tyre, was a deep, angular
  notch, corresponding, as I grinningly realised, with that sharp granite
  corner-stone and recalling the terrific lurch that had nearly jerked me from
  my perch. The notch was an honourable scar on which the builder and wheel
  wright might have looked with pardonable pride.</p>

  <p>I had just reached this conclusion when I became aware of a face protruded
  round a stable door and a pair of beady eyes fixed very attentively on me.
  Then the face emerged, accompanied by a suitable torso and a pair of thin,
  bandy legs, the entire outfit representing the Jehu whom I remembered as
  bearing the style and title of Louis. He advanced towards me crab-wise and
  demanded, suspiciously: "Vell. Vat you vant in here?"</p>

  <p>I replied that I was just having a look round.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said he, "zen you shall take your look outside."</p>

  <p>I expressed the hope that I had not intruded, and, turning about, strolled
  up the yard and out into the street. He followed closely at my heels, not
  only up the yard, but along the street. Finding him still clinging to me, I
  quickened my pace, deciding now to get clear of the neighbourhood without
  delay. Heading towards The Lion, I was approaching the corner when two men
  came round it. One of them, whose head was bound with a dirty rag, instantly
  riveted my attention and stirred the chords of memory. Apparently, my
  appearance affected him in a like manner, for, as soon as he saw me he
  stopped, and, after regarding me for a moment with an astonished glare, flung
  up his arms and uttered a loud cry which sounded to me like "Hoya!" At the
  same moment, his companion started forward as if to intercept me.</p>

  <p>That uncanny, Oriental alarm-cry, repeated now and echoed by the other two
  men, instantly warned me of my danger. I remembered its effect last time;
  indeed, the aid of memory was needless, for already a dozen windows were
  thrown up and a dozen shaggy heads thrust out, with open mouths repeating
  that ill-omened word, whatever it might be. Pocketing my dignity, I evaded
  the attempt to head me off and broke into a run with the cab-driver and the
  other man yelling at my heels.</p>

  <p>Past the Lion of Judah I bolted and along the street beyond for some fifty
  yards; but now my imperfect recollection of the neighbourhood played me
  false. For, coming to a narrow turning on my right, I assumed it to be the
  one by which I had come, and did not discover my error until I had covered
  more than half its length, when a sharp turn revealed a blind end. But the
  discovery came too late. Already the place was humming like an overturned
  hive, and, when I spun about to retrace my steps, behold! the end of the
  little street was blocked by a yelling crowd.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to go back, which I did at a brisk walk; and
  when the mob came forward to meet me with the obvious intention of
  obstructing my retreat, I charged valiantly enough. But, of course, it was
  hopeless. A score of dirty hands grabbed at me as I strove to push my way
  through and in a few moments I was brought to a stand with both my arms
  immovably held, and then began to be slowly pushed and dragged forward; and
  all around me were those strange, pale, greasy, alien faces with their high
  cheek bones and beady eyes, all jabbering vociferously in an uncouth, alien
  tongue. Suddenly, out of this incomprehensible babel issued the welcome sound
  of some thing resembling English speech.</p>

  <p>"Wot's the good of makin' all this rumpus? Give the bloke a clout on the
  'ed and let 'im go."</p>

  <p>I looked round at the speaker and instantly recognised the man who had
  given me the 'snide' half-crown at Byles's Wharf; and even in my
  bewilderment, I could see that he was obviously nervous and uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Let 'im go!" exclaimed a flat-faced, hairy alien who was hanging on to my
  arm. "You do not know zat he have try to kill poor Mr. Gomorrah!"</p>

  <p>"I know," said the other. "'E 'it 'im on the 'ed. And wot I says is, 'it
  'im on the 'ed and let 'im 'ook it. Wot's the good of raisin' a stink and
  bringin' the coppers round?"</p>

  <p>"He shall pay for vot he 'ave done, Mr. Trout," the other replied,
  doggedly; and at this moment, my acquaintance with the bandaged head pushed
  his way through the crowd and stood for a few moments gloating over me with
  an expression of concentrated vindictiveness; and certainly, the presence of
  the bandage after all these weeks suggested that he had some excuse for
  feeling annoyed with me. I thought that he was about to take 'consideration
  for value received' forthwith, but then he altered his mind, and, with a
  savage grin, directed his friends (as I gathered) to bring me along to some
  more convenient place.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Gomorrah," urged my friend&mdash;whose name appeared to
  be Trout. "You'll get yourself and the rest of us into the soup if you ain't
  careful. This 'ere is England, and don't you forget it."</p>

  <p>His warnings, however, had no effect, and, once more an effort was made to
  propel me in the desired direction. It was clear to me that I was being led
  to the slaughter&mdash;not, however, like a lamb (whose policy I have always
  considered a mistaken one), for I proceeded to make things as uncomfortable
  as possible for the men who were holding me; who, to do them justice,
  retaliated effectively in kind. The proceedings became distinctly boisterous
  with considerable wear and tear of my clothing and person, and our progress
  was neither dignified nor rapid. Suddenly, the man who was clinging to my
  right wrist, breathlessly addressed the still-protesting Trout.</p>

  <p>"Here come Mr. Zichlinsky. Now ye shall see."</p>

  <p>I looked anxiously at the new-comer who was thrusting through the crowd,
  and, as he came into view, I had two instantaneous impressions. First, in
  spite of his shabby, ill-fitting clothes, he was obviously of a totally
  different social class from the others. Secondly, though he was certainly a
  stranger, his face seemed to awaken some dim and vague reminiscence. It was a
  villainous face&mdash;dead white with a pair of strangely colourless eyes of
  the palest grey; and the pallor of eyes and skin was intensified by a brush
  of jet-black hair that stood straight up on his hatless head. Though not
  actually uncomely, his appearance and expression were evil to the point of
  repulsiveness.</p>

  <p>These were but momentary impressions of which I was but half aware; for
  there was matter enough of another kind to keep my attention fully occupied.
  As soon as Mr. Zichlinsky had worked his way through to me, he introduced
  himself by slapping my face and remarking, with a sort of wild-cat grin: "So
  you haf come to see us again. Zis time you shall haf a brober velcome."</p>

  <p>With this he slapped my face again, and then grabbing a handful of flesh
  and clothing together, helped the others to drag me along. Mr. Trout made yet
  one more appeal.</p>

  <p>"For Gawd's sake, Mr. Zichlinsky, don't go and do nothing stoopid. This
  ain't Russia, yer know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Zichlinsky turned on him as if he would have bitten him. "Have I ask for
  you to tell me vot I shall do? Keep your hands out of my business!"</p>

  <p>But there was yet another protestor. I could not see him, and, though I
  could hear his voice&mdash;speaking in barbarous French&mdash;I could make
  out only a word or two. But of those words, two&mdash;"la
  pucelle"&mdash;conveyed to me the gist of the matter.</p>

  <p>Zichlinsky answered him less savagely and in excellent French: "It is not
  only revenge, though this beast has robbed me of a fortune. But he knows too
  much, and you can see for yourself he is a spy."</p>

  <p>Here he refreshed himself again by slapping my face, and then, apparently
  goaded to fury by the recollection of his wrongs, snarled and bared his teeth
  like a dog, and, seizing my ear, began to pull and twist it with the ferocity
  of a madman. The pain and consequent anger scattered the last remains of my
  patience and caution. Wrenching my left hand free, I shot out my fist with
  the full strength of an uncommonly strong arm.</p>

  <p>My knuckles impinged on his countenance exactly between his eyes, and the
  weight of the blow flung him backward like a capsized ninepin. If there had
  been room, he would have measured his length on the ground. As it was, some
  of his friends caught him, and he leaned against them motionless for a few
  seconds apparently dazed, while from the crowd a deafening yell of execration
  arose. Then he recovered himself, and, with a horrid, womanish shriek, came
  at me with all his teeth exposed. And now I could see that he held a long,
  pointed knife in his hand.</p>

  <p>I suppose that, until my time comes, I shall never be so near death as I
  was at that moment. The man was within a foot of me and his arm was swung out
  to strike. The nearest wretches in the crowd glared at me with gloating,
  fascinated eyes while my own followed the outward swing of the knife.</p>

  <p>And then, in an instant, the fateful thing happened: A pair of strong
  hands&mdash;I think they were Trout's&mdash;seized and held the outswung arm.
  The din of triumphant yells died down suddenly, giving place to a strange
  silence. The hands which gripped my arms relaxed their hold so that I could
  shake myself free. I cast a bewildered glance around, and then I saw the
  cause of this singular change. Above the heads of the crowd appeared two
  constabulary helmets, and in another moment two stalwart policemen (the
  police patrol in pairs in neighbourhoods of this type) pushed their way to
  the centre of the throng. Zichlinsky hurriedly put away his knife&mdash;but
  not before one of the policemen had observed it&mdash;and was in the act of
  withdrawing when a stern official voice commanded him to stay.</p>

  <p>"Now," said the constable who had noticed the knife, "what's going on
  here?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Trout hastened to explain. "It's a parcel of foolery, constable,
  that's what it is. A silly mistake. They took this young man for somebody
  else and they was going to wallop 'im."</p>

  <p>"Seem to have done a fair amount of walloping already," the constable
  remarked apropos of my rather dishevelled condition. "And one of them," he
  added, fixing an accusing eye on Zichlinsky, "was going to do the walloping
  with a knife. I saw you putting it away. Now what might your name be?"</p>

  <p>The question was evidently anticipated for Zichlinsky replied, promptly:
  "Jacob Silberstein."</p>

  <p>"And where do you live?"</p>

  <p>"I lodge with Mr. Gomorrah."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said the constable, "you live with old Solomon Gomorrah, do you?
  That isn't much of a testimonial."</p>

  <p>He produced a large, black-covered note-book in which he entered the
  particulars while the other constable peered curiously over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" the latter asked. "Did he say he lived at Sodom and
  Gomorrah?"</p>

  <p>"No," his colleague explained. "Solomon Gomorrah is a man&mdash;at least
  he'd pass for one in the monkey-house at the Zoo. One of these cag-mag
  tailors. Makes shoddy trousers. What they call in Whitechapel a kickseys
  builder. You'll know all about Solomon when you've been a little longer on
  this beat." He ran an expert eye over the remaining bystanders (the
  production of the note-book had occasioned a rapid dwindling of the assembly,
  though curiosity still held the less cautious) and demanded: "But what was it
  all about? What did they want to wallop this young fellow for?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Trout would have essayed to explain, but he was forestalled by an
  elderly Jewess who looked as if she might have been "collected" from the
  Assyrian room at the British Museum. "He is a vicked man! He have try to kill
  poor Mr. Gomorrah."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort!" said Trout. "T'wasn't this bloke at all. They
  thought 'e was 'im, but it wasn't. It was another cove altogether. 'E 'it 'im
  on the 'ed."</p>

  <p>The constable's unsympathetic comment on this slightly confused
  explanation was that it probably served him right; "but," he asked, "where is
  Gomorrah?"</p>

  <p>"Seems to have hooked it," said Trout, looking round vaguely, and I then
  observed that Zichlinsky had also taken the opportunity to fade away. The
  constable turned to me somewhat wearily and asked:</p>

  <p>"What is your name, sonny, and where do you live?"</p>

  <p>"My name," I replied, "is Jasper Gray, and I live at 165, Great Ormond
  Street."</p>

  <p>"Quite a treat to hear a Christianlike name," said the officer, writing it
  down. "So you don't belong to this select residential neighbourhood; and if
  you will take my tip, you'll clear out of it as quickly as possible. Better
  walk with us up to Commercial Road East."</p>

  <p>I accepted the invitation gladly enough, and we turned away together from
  the now silent and rapidly emptying street, and as we went, the senior
  constable put a few judicious questions. "Do you know what the rumpus was
  about? Why did that man Silberstein want to knife you?"</p>

  <p>"He said I had robbed him of a fortune. I don't know what he meant. I have
  never seen him before, to my knowledge. But his name is not Silberstein. It
  is Zichlinsky. I heard them call him by that name."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Zichlinsky, is it?" said my friend, fishing out the note-book again.
  "Probably a 'wanted' name as he gave a false one. We must see who he is. And
  now, here we are in Commercial Road East. You'd better have a penn'orth on a
  bus. Safer than walking. Got any coppers?"</p>

  <p>He was slipping his hand into his trousers pocket, but I assured him that
  I was solvent to the extent of twopence, whereupon, waving away my thanks, he
  hailed a west-bound Blackwall omnibus and stood by to see me safely on
  board.</p>

  <p>I was not sorry to sink down restfully on a cushioned seat (the constable
  had directed me to travel inside) for I had had a strenuous finish to a
  rather fatiguing morning. And as the omnibus rumbled along west ward I
  reflected on my late experiences, and once more the voice of conscience made
  itself heard. Evidently, Pentecost Grove was a veritable nest of criminals of
  the most dangerous type. Of those criminals I knew enough to enable the
  police to lay hands, at least on some and probably on all. Hitherto I had,
  for purely selfish reasons, kept my knowledge to myself. Now it was time for
  me to consider my duties as a citizen.</p>

  <p>So I reflected as the leisurely omnibus jogged on along the familiar
  highway, and the sordid east gradually gave place to the busy west. When I
  dropped off opposite Great Turnstile my mind was made up. I would seek out
  the guardians of the law and tell them my story.</p>

  <p>But once more Fate intervened. The guardians of the law forestalled my
  intentions; and the ears into which my story was delivered were not those of
  the mere official police.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-12"
     id="ch-12"></a>XII. &mdash; OF A HANSOM CAB AND A BLACK EAGLE</h2>

  <h3>(DR. JERVIS'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">WHEN I came down to breakfast on the day after the inquest,
  I found the table laid for one; a phenomenon which Polton explained by
  informing me that "the doctor" had gone out early. "In a hansom," he added
  with a crinkly and cunning smile. "I fancy he's got something on. I saw him
  copying a lot of names out of the directory."</p>

  <p>I followed his knowing glance to a side table, whereon lay a copy of the
  Post Office Directory, and had no doubt that he was right. The Post Office
  Directory was one of Thorndyke's most potent instruments of research. In his
  hands, and used with imagination and analytical feeling, it was capable of
  throwing the most surprising amount and kind of illumination on obscure
  cases. In the present instance, its function, I had no doubt, was quite
  simple; and so, on examination, it turned out to be. Although closed, the
  volume had two places conspicuously marked by slips of paper, one at the page
  devoted to rope manufacturers and the other at the list of ship chandlers;
  and a number of light pencil marks opposite names in the two lists showed
  that a definite itinerary had been made out.</p>

  <p>"The doctor said I was to show you this," said Polton, laying an open
  envelope beside my plate.</p>

  <p>I drew out the enclosed letter, which I found to be a short and civil note
  from Mr. Northbrook, inviting us informally to lunch at the Clarendon Club.
  The invitation was for the current day, and the note was endorsed by
  Thorndyke: "I have accepted, and shall be at the club at one o'clock. Come if
  you can."</p>

  <p>I was a little surprised, for Thorndyke was evidently full of business,
  and I suspected that Northbrook merely wanted to extract comments on the
  inquest; but it was quite convenient for me to go, and, as Thorndyke clearly
  wished me to&mdash;quite possibly for some definite reason&mdash;I strolled
  forth in good time and made my way to the rendezvous by the pleasant way of
  St. James's and the Green Park.</p>

  <p>Northbrook's intentions were as I had supposed, and I have no doubt that,
  in the course of a very pleasant lunch, he may have elicited some interesting
  comments on the previous day's proceedings. But Thorndyke was an extremely
  difficult man to pump; the more so as he had the manner of discussing affairs
  without any appearance of reservation. But I noted that no inkling was
  conveyed to Northbrook of any dissent from the finding of the jury.</p>

  <p>I found myself speculating from time to time on Thorndyke's object in
  wasting rather valuable time on this leisurely and apparently purposeless
  conversation. But towards the end of the meal I received a sudden
  enlightenment. "This," he said, "I take to be the table at which Sir Edward
  usually took his meals?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Northbrook, "and a very pleasant table it is, looking out
  right across the Green Park. You judged, no doubt, by the fact that Joseph
  Wood is waiting on us?"</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," said Thorndyke; "and that reminds me that I should
  like to have a word or two with Joseph Wood, presently."</p>

  <p>"But certainly, my dear sir. You shall have an opportunity of interviewing
  him in the strictest privacy."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is not necessary at all," said Thorndyke. "There are no secrets.
  I merely wanted him to amplify one of the points in his evidence. Perhaps I
  may ask him now, as I see he is coming with the coffee."</p>

  <p>"Do so, do so, by all means," said Northbrook, evidently delighted at the
  chance of hearing the "amplification."</p>

  <p>Thus invited, Thorndyke addressed the waiter as he placed the coffee on
  the table.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to ask you one or two questions about your evidence at the
  inquest concerning the hansom in which Sir Edward drove away."</p>

  <p>"Yessir," said Wood, standing stiffly at attention.</p>

  <p>"It seemed to me that you had an impression that there was someone in it
  when it drew up for him to get in."</p>

  <p>"Yessir. I had. I didn't say so at the inquest, because I was there to
  tell what I saw, not what I thought."</p>

  <p>"You were perfectly right," said Thorndyke. "It was for the coroner to ask
  for your opinions if he wanted them. But you did think so?"</p>

  <p>"Yessir. I didn't see Sir Edward hail the cab, and I don't think he did.
  He just stopped and the cab drew up. Then he got in and the cab drove away. I
  didn't see him speak to the cabman, and I don't believe he did, for the man
  started off and whipped up his horse as if he knew where he had to go."</p>

  <p>"You said you didn't notice the number of the cab. Of course, you would
  not."</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I hadn't no occasion to."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice what the cab was like&mdash;whether there was anything
  unusual in its appearance?</p>

  <p>"Yessir, I did notice that. You couldn't help noticing it. That cab," he
  continued solemnly, "must have been the great-grandfather of all the cabs in
  London. You never see such a shabby old rattle-trap. Got an old round dickey
  with a sheet-iron back, like I remember when I was a boy, and, if you will
  believe me, sir, iron tyres! Iron tyres in this twentieth century! Why that
  cab must have been fifty years old if it was a day."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say that in your evidence, Wood?" Northbrook demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nobody asked me, sir," was the very reasonable reply.</p>

  <p>"No. And, after all, I suppose it didn't very much matter what the cab was
  like. Do you think so, doctor?</p>

  <p>"It would have been helpful if we could have identified the cab and
  ascertained if anyone was in it and where it went to. That might have enabled
  us to fill in the picture. However, we can't; but, all the same, I must thank
  you, Wood, for telling me what you noticed."</p>

  <p>After this little episode, I was not surprised when Thorndyke became
  suddenly conscious of the passage of time.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" he exclaimed with a glance at his watch, "how the minutes slip
  away in pleasant society! We shall have to get on the road, Jervis, and let
  Mr. Northbrook retire to his office. It was most kind of you to invite us,
  Mr. Northbrook, and we have both enjoyed a very agreeable interlude in the
  day's work."</p>

  <p>He finished his coffee and we both stood up; and after a few more
  exchanges of compliments, we took our departure. As we descended the steps, a
  disengaged hansom approached and drew up in response to Thorndyke's hail. I
  stepped in, and, as my colleague followed, I heard him give the destination:
  "New Scotland Yard, Whitehall Gate."</p>

  <p>"That waiter man's information was rather startling&mdash;at least, it was
  to me," I remarked as the cab horse padded away to the accompaniment of his
  softly tinkling bell.</p>

  <p>"It is a very valuable addition to our small stock of facts," Thorndyke
  replied. "And how extraordinarily opportune Northbrook's invitation was. I
  was casting about for some way of getting a talk with Wood without making a
  fuss, and behold! Northbrook solves the difficulty in the simplest fashion.
  What did you think of the other point; the possible presence of some other
  person in the cab?</p>

  <p>"I think it is more than merely possible. I should say it is very highly
  probable, especially in view of the peculiarity of the cab. And, of course,
  this new information confirms very strongly your suspicion that the Stratford
  vehicle was really a hansom."</p>

  <p>"It does," he agreed; "in fact I am assuming as a working hypothesis that
  the cab which bore Sir Edward away from the club, conveyed his body to
  Piper's Row. On that assumption I am now going to Scotland Yard to find out
  what facilities there are for tracing a cab the number of which is unknown. I
  should like to see Miller in the first place if we are lucky enough to catch
  him."</p>

  <p>By this time our 'gondola' was turning from Trafalgar Square into
  Whitehall, and I was noting how strikingly it contrasted with the
  'rattle-trap' that Wood had described. This was a typical West End hansom, as
  smart and clean as a private carriage; furnished with gay silken blinds and
  at each side with a little mirror and a flower-holder containing a bunch of
  violets; and it slid along as smoothly as a sleigh, without a sound beyond
  the gentle and musical tinkle-tinkle of the bell on the horse's collar.</p>

  <p>"If you want to catch Miller," said I, as we approached the main gateway
  of the Police Head quarters, "you are just in time. I see him coming out
  across the courtyard."</p>

  <p>In effect, the Superintendent emerged into Whitehall just as we got out of
  the hansom, and, observing us, stopped to wait for us.</p>

  <p>"Were you wanting to see me?" he asked with an inflection that subtly
  conveyed the earnest hope that we were not. Thorndyke evidently caught that
  faint overtone, for he replied: "Only for a moment. Which way are you
  going?"</p>

  <p>"Westminster Station&mdash;underground."</p>

  <p>"So are we; so we can talk as we go. What I want to know is this: there
  are still in London a few old hansom cabs with unconverted iron tyres. Now,
  could your people produce a list of those cabs?"</p>

  <p>Miller shook his head. "No," he replied. "The register doesn't give
  particulars of the furnishing of particular cabs. Of course, we could find
  out by means of what they call an ad hoc investigation. But it would be a
  troublesome business. Possibly Inspector Radcliffe might be able to give you
  some information. He is our principal specialist in public vehicles."</p>

  <p>He paused and seemed to reflect for a few moments. Then, suddenly, he
  emitted a soft laugh as if he had remembered something amusing. Which, in
  fact, turned out to be the case, for he resumed: "Talking of iron-tired cabs,
  Radcliffe told me a rather quaint story some time ago. Nothing much in it,
  but your question brought it to mind. It seems that a certain constable whose
  beat included Dorchester Square was going his round rather late one evening
  when he noticed a hansom cab drawn up about the middle of the south side of
  the square. There was no sign of the driver, and no one minding the horse;
  and as this was not quite according to Cocker, it naturally attracted his
  attention. But what specially tickled him was the way the horse was secured.
  The reins were made fast to a lamp-post with a clove hitch, just as a
  waterman makes fast his boat's painter to a railing or a thin iron post. The
  constable was a Margate man and familiar with the ways of boatmen, so it
  struck him as rather funny to see a cab moored to the lamp-post like a
  boat.</p>

  <p>"However, he didn't take any notice but went off on his beat. When he came
  round the square the next time, the cab was still there and there was still
  no sign of the driver. He began to think it a bit queer, but he didn't want
  to make a fuss unnecessarily. But when he came round the third time and found
  the cab still there, he began to look into things. First he noticed that the
  cab was a most shocking old ramshackle&mdash;battered old round-backed dickey
  and iron tires&mdash;sort of cab that Queen Elizabeth might have driven about
  in; and then he looked at the horse and saw that it looked ready to drop with
  exhaustion. Just then as the sergeant happened to come round, the constable
  drew his attention to the cab, and the sergeant detailed another constable to
  take it round to a livery stable. There they gave the poor old horse a drink
  and a feed, and they say that he went for the oats as if he'd never tasted
  any before and nearly swallowed the nose-bag.</p>

  <p>"Next morning, having found out from the register that the cab came from a
  little private yard down Mile End way, one of our men took it there and
  interviewed the owner, who drove it himself. It was a queer affair. The owner
  was a Polish Jew, about as unlike a horsey man as you can imagine. But what
  struck our man principally was that the fellow seemed to be in a blue funk.
  His story was that he had gone into a pub to get a drink, leaving the cab in
  charge of a man who happened to be loafing outside, and when he'd had his
  drink and come out, the cab was gone. Asked why he hadn't given information
  to the police, he said he hadn't thought of it, he was so upset. And that was
  all our man could get out of him. But as it was obvious that there was
  something behind the affair, our man took the fellow's name&mdash;though it
  was on the register&mdash;and reported the incident to Radcliffe.</p>

  <p>"That's the story. I don't know whether it is of any interest to you, but
  if it is, I will tell Radcliffe to let you have particulars if you care to
  look him up. And he might be able to tell you about some other cabs with iron
  tyres."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke thanked the Superintendent and said that he would certainly
  avail himself of the assistance thus kindly offered. Then, as the train began
  to slow down he rose. (I have not interrupted Miller's narrative to describe
  our movements but I may explain that, at Westminster, we had all taken
  tickets, Miller's being for Bishopsgate and ours for the Monument and that we
  had all boarded the same east-bound train.) When the train stopped we shook
  hands with the Superintendent and got out, leaving him to pursue his
  journey.</p>

  <p>"That Polish gentleman sounds suspiciously like one of our friends," I
  remarked as we made our way out of the station.</p>

  <p>"He does," Thorndyke agreed. "The man and the cab seem to fit the
  circumstances. It remains to be seen whether the date will. But I shall take
  an early opportunity of calling on Inspector Radcliffe and getting more
  precise details."</p>

  <p>"Where are we going now?" I asked, having noted that our course seemed to
  be riverward.</p>

  <p>"The Old Swan Pier," he replied, "whence we shall embark for a short
  voyage. The object of that voyage will, I hope, appear later."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke's answer, while withholding the explanation, did not
  deprecate speculation on my part, I gave the possibilities due consideration
  by the light of our further proceedings. From the Old Swan Pier we boarded
  one of the excellent and convenient river steamers which plied on the Thames
  in those days, by which we were borne eastward beneath the Tower Bridge and
  down the busy Pool. Cherry Gardens Pier was reached and left behind without
  supplying any hint, nor was I any the wiser when, as the boat headed in
  towards The Tunnel Pier, Wapping, my colleague rose and moved towards the
  gangway.</p>

  <p>From the head of the pier, Thorndyke turned west ward along High Street,
  Wapping, commenting on our surroundings as he went.</p>

  <p>"A queer, romantic old neighbourhood, this, Jervis; dull and squalid to
  look at now but rich in memories of those more stirring and eventful days
  which we think of fondly with the advantage of not having had to live in
  them. We are now passing Execution Dock, still, I believe, so called though
  it is now a mere work-a-day wharf. But a century or so ago you could have
  stood here and looked on a row of pirates hanging in chains."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't mind if you could now," I remarked, "if I could have the
  choosing of the pirates."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. "Yes," he said, "there was no nonsense about legal
  procedure in those days. If the intermediate stages were not all that could
  be desired, the final ones had the merit of conclusiveness. Here we approach
  The Town of Ramsgate Inn and Wapping Old Stairs, the latter a little
  disappointing to look at. The art of seasoning squalor with picturesqueness
  seems to have been lost. This is the goal of our pilgrimage."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he turned in at the gateway of a small dock and began to walk
  at a reduced pace along the quay. I looked around in search of some object
  that might be of interest to us but my glance met nothing beyond the craft in
  the basin&mdash;mostly lighters and Thames barges&mdash;the dreary dock
  buildings, the massive mooring-posts and bollards and here and there a
  life-buoy stand. Suddenly, however, I became aware that these last, which my
  eye had passed almost without notice, were not viewed with the same
  indifference by Thorndyke, for he walked straight up to the nearest one and
  halted before it with an air of obvious interest. And then, in a moment, I
  saw what we had come for.</p>

  <p>The lifebuoy stand was in the form of a screen supported on two
  stanchions. In the middle of the screen, under a little pent-house, was a
  massive wooden hook on which was hung the life-buoy and a coil of smallish
  rope. Neither the buoy nor the rope was secured in any way, but either or
  both could be freely lifted off the hook. I thought at first that Thorndyke
  was about to lift off the coil, but he merely sought one of the ends of the
  rope, and, having found it, looked at it for a few moments with close
  attention. Then, having spread out with his thumb the little brush of fibres
  that projected beyond the whipping, he made a more minute examination with
  the aid of his pocket lens. Finally, without comment, he handed the end of
  the rope and the lens to me.</p>

  <p>A moment's careful inspection through the glass was sufficient.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "there is no doubt about it. I can see the red and the
  green threads plainly enough through the lens though they are mighty hard to
  see with the naked eye. Which is unkind to the thief as giving him a false
  sense of security."</p>

  <p>"It is for the thief, like the rest of us, to know his job," said
  Thorndyke, producing from his pocket the invaluable calliper gauge. He took
  the rope from me, and having measured the diameter, continued: "The agreement
  is perfect. This is a four-strand rope three eighths of an inch in diameter
  and having the two 'rogues' threads' of the same colour and similarly placed.
  So we may say that the place of origin of the Piper's Row rope is established
  beyond doubt."</p>

  <p>At this moment an amphibious-looking person in a peaked cap who had been
  approaching slowly and with a somewhat stealthy manner, made his presence
  known.</p>

  <p>"What's the game?" he enquired, and then, by way of elucidation: "What are
  yer up to with that rope?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke faced him genially.</p>

  <p>"You, I take it, are the dock keeper?"</p>

  <p>"I ham," was the concise reply. "And what abaat it?"</p>

  <p>"I should like, if you would not mind," said Thorndyke, "to ask you one or
  two questions. I may explain that I am a lawyer and am, at the moment, rather
  interested in the subject of rope-stealing. These life-lines look to me very
  exposed and easy to steal."</p>

  <p>"So they are," our friend replied in a slightly truculent tone, "but what
  else can you do? Make 'em fast with a padlock, I suppose! And then you'd be
  in a pretty fine 'ole if a bloke went overboard and nobody hadn't got the
  key."</p>

  <p>"Very true," said Thorndyke. "They must be free to lift off at a moment's
  notice. I see that. But I expect you find one missing now and again."</p>

  <p>"Now and again!" repeated the dock-keeper. "I tell you, the way them ropes
  used to disappear was somethink chronic."</p>

  <p>"That was before you took to marking them, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"How did you know we marked 'em?" our friend enquired suspiciously; and as
  Thorndyke silently held up the free end, he continued: "If you spotted them
  marks, you won't be much good to the spectacle trade. But you are quite
  right. Before we took to marking 'em they used to go one after the other.
  Couldn't keep one no how. And we lost one or two&mdash;three
  altogether&mdash;after we took to the marks. But we got back two of 'em and
  dropped on the coves that pinched one of 'em; and now they've ogled that
  there's something wrong with our ropes and they leaves 'em
  alone&mdash;leastways they have for the last week or two."</p>

  <p>Here he paused, but neither of us made any comment. Guided by long
  experience, we waited for the inevitable story to emerge; and sure enough,
  after a brief interval, our friend resumed:</p>

  <p>"Three ropes we lost after the marks was put in, and we got back two. The
  first one I found in a junk shop in Shadwell 'Igh Street. The bloke said he
  bought it of a stranger, and p'raps he did. Nobody could say he didn't, so
  there was no use in makin' a rumpus. I just collared the rope and told him to
  keep a sharper look out in future. The second rope I spotted laying in a boat
  alongside Hermitage Stairs. Nearly missed it, I did, too, for the artful
  blighters had gone and dyed it with cutch. Made it look just like a ky-ar
  rope. But I looks at it a bit hard and I thinks it looks uncommon like our
  rope, barrin' the colour; four strands, same size, looked about the same
  length as ours&mdash;ten fathoms, that is, to a inch&mdash;and it seemed to
  be laying spare in the boat. So I jumps down&mdash;there wasn't nobody in the
  boat at the time&mdash;and I has a look at the cut end. And there was our
  marks quite plain in spite of the cutch.</p>

  <p>"Now it happened that while I was overhauling that rope, a bobby came out
  on the head of the stairs and stood there a-twiggin' of me.</p>

  <p>"'That your boat?' he says.</p>

  <p>"'No,' I says, 'it ain't.'</p>

  <p>"'Then,' he says, 'what are you doin' with that rope?' he says.</p>

  <p>"So I nips up the stairs with the rope in my hand and tells him how things
  is and who I am.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' says he, 'are you goin' to charge this man with stealin' the
  rope?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' I says, 'I ain't,' I says. 'I'm a-goin' to pinch this rope,' I
  says, 'and you've caught me in the very act, and you're goin' to run me in,
  and you're goin' to bring this bloke along to make the charge and to swear to
  his property.'</p>

  <p>"The copper grins at this. 'You seem to be a pretty fly old bird,' he
  says, 'but it's a sound wheeze. You'll catch him on the hop if he swears to
  the rope.'</p>

  <p>"Just then two blokes come down to the stairs. They take a long squint at
  me and the copper and then down they goes to the boat. One of 'em was a
  regler Thames water rat and the other was one of them foreign
  sheenies&mdash;hair down on his shoulders and a beard what looked as if he'd
  pinched it out of a horse hair mattress. The copper grabs hold of my wrist
  and runs me down after them.</p>

  <p>"'Here,' he says to the water rat, 'is this your boat?'</p>

  <p>"Water rat didn't seem quite sure whether it was or not, but at last he
  said he supposed it was.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' says the copper, 'I've just caught this man stealing rope out of
  your boat, and I'm going to take him along to the station, and you two have
  got to come along with me to identify your property.'</p>

  <p>"Then I saw that my wheeze wasn't going to work. Water rat bloke had
  rumbled me&mdash;seen me at the dock, I expect.</p>

  <p>"'Wot property are yer talkin' about,' says he, beginning to cast off his
  painter from the ring. 'That there rope don't belong to me. Someone must have
  dropped it into the boat while we was up at the pub.'</p>

  <p>"The copper reaches out and grabs the painter so that they couldn't hike
  off and he says: 'Well, it's somebody's rope and it's been pinched, and
  you've got to come along to the station to tell us about it.'</p>

  <p>"I thought those coves was going to give trouble, but just then a Thames
  Police gig came along and the copper beckoned to 'em. So they pulls in and
  one of the water police helped us to take the two blokes to the station. I
  went along quite quiet, myself. When we got there, the Inspector asks the
  water rat what his name was. Water rat didn't seem quite sure about it but at
  last he says: 'Frederick Walker,' he says, 'is my name,' he says.</p>

  <p>"'No, it isn't,' says the Inspector. 'Think again,' he says. 'Last time
  you was James Trout and you lived in King David Lane, Shadwell. Live there
  still?'</p>

  <p>"'Yus,' says Trout. 'If you knowed, what did you ask me for?'</p>

  <p>"'We don't want any of your sauce,' says the Inspector; and then he turns
  to the sheeny. 'What's your name and address?' he says.</p>

  <p>"The sheeny shakes his head like as if he was trundling a mop. 'No speak
  Anglish,' says he.</p>

  <p>"'Oh, rats!' says the Inspector, 'you can't have forgot the English
  language in a couple of months. Last time you was Solomon Gomorrah and you
  lived in Pentecost Grove and was a tailor by trade. Any change?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' says Solomon. 'It vas chust ze same.'</p>

  <p>"'Well,' says the Inspector, 'you'll have to stay here while I send a man
  round to see that the addresses are correct. Sure you don't want to make any
  change?'</p>

  <p>"They said no; so I left the rope with the Inspector and came away."</p>

  <p>"And what was the end of it?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"That was," our friend replied. He expectorated scornfully and continued:
  "Both of 'em swore before the beak that it wasn't their rope, and we couldn't
  prove that it was, so he dismissed the case and told 'em to be more careful
  in future."</p>

  <p>"And with regard to the third rope that you lost?"</p>

  <p>"Ah," said the dock-keeper, regretfully, "I'm afraid that's a goner. Now
  that they know it's got a secret mark, they'll most likely have traded it
  away with some foreigner."</p>

  <p>"You haven't done so badly," said Thorndyke. "I must compliment you on the
  smart way in which you found the lost sheep. And we needn't despair of the
  third rope. If you can give me the exact dates and the names and addresses, I
  may be able to help you, and you will certainly help me. I want to get a list
  of these rope thieves."</p>

  <p>Our friend hereupon produced from his pocket a portentous note-book, the
  leaves of which he turned over rapidly. Having at last found the entry of the
  transaction, he read out the particulars, which Thorndyke duly entered in his
  own note-book.</p>

  <p>"The length of these ropes, you say, is ten fathoms?"</p>

  <p>"Ten fathoms exactly to a inch. I cut 'em off the coil myself and put on
  the whippings at the ends."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought you would want them longer than ten fathoms,"
  Thorndyke remarked.</p>

  <p>"Why?" our friend demanded. "It's long enough for a man overboard. Of
  course, if he was going for a channel swim that would be a different matter.
  We haven't provided for that."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Thorndyke. "And now, perhaps I had better make a note of
  your name and address in case I have any information to give you."</p>

  <p>"My name," said the dock-keeper, "is Stephen Waters, and any letters
  addressed to me at the office here&mdash;Black Eagle Dock, Wapping&mdash;will
  find me. And I may as well have your name and address, if you don't
  mind."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke produced a card from his case and handed it to Waters with the
  remark: "Better not mention to anyone that you have been in communication
  with me. The less we tell other people, the more we are likely to learn."</p>

  <p>Mr. Waters warmly agreed with these sentiments (though his own practice
  had not been strikingly illustrative of them), and when we had thanked him
  for having so far taken us into his confidence, we bade him adieu and made
  our way out of the dock premises.</p>

  <p>"Well," I exclaimed as we turned out into the High Street, "this has been
  a regular windfall. But how did you discover the place?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that was simple enough," replied Thorndyke. "I just took a list of
  rope-merchants and ship chandlers from the Post Office Directory and started
  systematically to call on them. One was bound, sooner or later, to strike the
  right one. But I was lucky from the beginning, for the second rope-merchant
  whom I called on gave me the name of a rope-maker who made a speciality of
  private ropes of unusual construction and particularly of marked ropes. So I
  went straight off to that maker and gave him the description of our rope,
  when it turned out that it was one of his own make. He had a big coil of it
  actually in stock and was good enough to give me a sample (when I had given
  him my card) as well as a direction to Black Eagle Dock. That was a stroke of
  luck, for I obtained, after a couple of hours' search, information that I had
  been prepared to spend a week on. But this meeting with Waters is a much
  bigger stroke of luck. We could, and should, have discovered eventually all
  that he has told us, but it would have involved a long and tedious
  investigation. This has been an excellent day's work."</p>

  <p>"By Jove, it has!" I exclaimed. "With the Polish-Hebrew cab-driver and Mr.
  William Trout and the venerable Sodom-and-Gomorrah, we seem to have gathered
  up the whole party."</p>

  <p>"We mustn't let our conclusions get ahead of our facts," Thorndyke
  protested. "We are doing extremely well. Our great need was to give to
  certain unknown persons 'a local habitation and a name.' We seem to have done
  that; but we have to make sure that it is the right habitation and the right
  name. Possibly the finger-prints may dispose of that question
  definitely."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, however, they did not. As we entered the Temple by the
  Tudor Street gate, we perceived Superintendent Miller advancing towards us
  from the direction of the Mitre Court entrance. He quickened his pace on
  seeing us and we met almost on our own threshold.</p>

  <p>"Well, Doctor," he said as we turned into the entry together, "I thought I
  would come along and give you the news, though it isn't very good news. I'm
  afraid you've drawn a blank."</p>

  <p>"Finger-prints unknown or undecipherable?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Both," replied Miller. "Most of the marks are just smears, no visible
  pattern at all. There are two prints that Singleton says he could identify if
  they were in the records. But they are not. They are strangers. So that cat
  won't jump. Then there is a print&mdash;or rather part of a print, and bad at
  that&mdash;which Singleton thought, at first, that he could spot. But he
  decided afterwards that it was only a resemblance. You do get general
  resemblances in finger-prints, of course, but they don't stand systematic
  checking, character by character."</p>

  <p>"And this one failed to pass the test?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Well, it wasn't that so much," replied Miller. "It was a bad print and
  the identification was very uncertain; and when we came to look up the
  records, it didn't seem possible that the identification could be right. The
  print in the register that it resembled was taken from a man named Maurice
  Zichlinsky who was tried under extradition procedure for conspiracy to
  murder. The alleged crime was committed at St. Petersburg, and, as the
  extradition court convicted him, he was handed over to the Russian police,
  and a note on the record says that he was tried in Russia and sentenced to
  imprisonment for life. Consequently, as he is presumably in a Russian prison
  at this moment, it seems to be physically impossible that this print can be
  his. That is, if these are recent finger-prints."</p>

  <p>"They are," said Thorndyke. "So I am afraid it is an absolute blank. Can
  you show me which are the possible prints?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Miller. "Singleton marked them on the photograph and wrote
  the particulars on the back. Here they are," he continued, laying the
  photograph on the table; "these are the two possibles and this one, numbered
  'three', is the one that might have been the Russian's."</p>

  <p>"And with regard to the second photograph?"</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Miller, producing it from his pocket, "Singleton was rather
  interested in that. Thought the prints looked as if they had been taken from
  a dead body."</p>

  <p>"He was quite right," said Thorndyke. "They were; and the question was
  whether there was any trace of them on the other photograph."</p>

  <p>"There was not," said Miller. "Of course, negative evidence is not
  conclusive, but Singleton couldn't find the least sign of them and he is
  pretty sure that they are not there. You see, even a smear may give you a
  hint if you know what you are looking for."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "we have not drawn an utter blank. We can take it
  that our known prints are not among the group, and that is something
  gained."</p>

  <p>I now inducted the Superintendent into an easy chair while Thorndyke
  placed by his side a decanter of whisky, a siphon and a box of cigars. It has
  sometimes struck me that my learned colleague would have made an excellent
  innkeeper, judging by the sympathetic attention that he gave to the tastes of
  his visitors in the matter of refreshments. Brodribb delighted in a
  particular kind of dry and ancient port and Thorndyke kept a special bin for
  his exclusive gratification. Miller's more modern tastes inclined to an aged
  and mellow type of Scotch whisky and a particular brand of obese and rather
  full-flavoured cigar; and his fancy also received due consideration.</p>

  <p>"I was going to ask you," said Thorndyke, when the Superintendent's cigar
  was well alight, "at what time Radcliffe is usually to be found in his
  office."</p>

  <p>"You needn't find him at all," replied Miller. "I thought you would
  probably want particulars of that hansom I told you about, so I got them for
  you when I saw him this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"That was very thoughtful of you, Miller," said Thorndyke, watching with
  lively interest the extraction of a large pocket-book from the Millerian
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," was the reply. "You are always ready to give me a bit of
  help. The driver's name, which is also that of the owner, as they are one and
  the same person, is Louis Shemrofsky&mdash;there's a name for a hansom cab
  driver!&mdash;and he keeps his blooming antique at a stable yard in Pentecost
  Grove; that is one of those little back streets somewhere between Commercial
  Road East and Shadwell&mdash;a pretty crummy neighbourhood, if you ask
  me&mdash;full of foreign crooks and shady Jews and what they call
  refugees."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Thorndyke, "you didn't happen to note the date on which
  the cab was found in Dorchester Square?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, didn't I?" replied Miller. "Do you suppose I don't appreciate the
  importance of dates? The cab was found in the Square on Friday, the
  nineteenth of June, at about ten-fifteen p.m."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke probably experienced the faint sense of disappointment of which
  I was myself aware. For, of course, it was the wrong date. Meanwhile, Miller
  watched him narrowly, and, after a short interval, was fain to let the cloven
  hoof come plainly into view.</p>

  <p>"That interest you particularly?" he asked with suppressed eagerness.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at him thoughtfully for a few moments before replying. At
  length he answered:</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miller, it does. Jervis and I have a case in hand&mdash;a queer,
  intricate case with very important issues, and I think that this man,
  Shemrofsky, comes into the picture. We have quite a lot of evidence, but that
  evidence is in isolated patches with wide spaces between."</p>

  <p>"Why not let me try to fill up some of the spaces," said Miller, eagerly,
  evidently smelling a case with possibilities of glory.</p>

  <p>"I am going to ask for your collaboration presently," Thorndyke replied.
  "But just at the moment, the case is more suitable to my methods than to
  yours. And there is no urgency. Our activities are entirely unsuspected."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent grinned. "I know," said he. "I've seen you do it
  before. Just work away out of sight until you are ready and then pounce.
  Well, Doctor, when you want me you know where to find me, and meanwhile, I'll
  do anything you want done without troubling you with inconvenient
  questions."</p>

  <p>When the Superintendent had gone, I ventured to raise a question that had
  arisen in my mind during the conversation.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you a little over-critical, Thorndyke? You spoke of spaces between
  patches of evidence but it seems to me that the case comes together very
  completely."</p>

  <p>"No, Jervis," he replied. "It does not. We are getting on admirably, but
  we have not made out a coherent case. We have facts and we have
  probabilities. But the facts and the probabilities do not make complete
  contact."</p>

  <p>"I do not quite follow you," said I.</p>

  <p>"Let us look at our evidence critically," he replied. "The vehicle which
  went to Piper's Row was probably a hansom. Very probably but not certainly.
  That probable hansom was probably Shemrofsky's hansom and probably driven by
  Shemrofsky. We have to turn those probabilities into certainties. Again, the
  rope which was used to hang Sir Edward was stolen from Black Eagle Dock. We
  may treat that as a fact. It was dyed with cutch. That again is a fact. The
  rope found in the possession of Trout and Gomorrah was stolen from Black
  Eagle Dock and it was dyed with cutch. That is a fact. That it was stolen by,
  and was the temporary property of, one or both of them is highly probable but
  cannot be proved. The magistrate dismissed it as unproved. Gomorrah lives in
  Pentecost Grove. Shemrofsky's cab is kept in Pentecost Grove. Those are
  facts. The inference that Gomorrah and Trout and Shemrofsky were concerned in
  conveying that dyed rope (together with the body) to Piper's Row is very
  highly probable, but it cannot be certainly connected with the known
  facts.</p>

  <p>"Again, the murder of Sir Edward we may regard as a known fact. He was
  probably murdered in a house in which is a tailor's work-room. Therefore he
  was probably murdered in Gomorrah's house. Still it is only a probability.
  And here there is a considerable space in our evidence. For Sir Edward was
  murdered by being drowned in salt water in which numerous herring-scales were
  suspended. Now, we have not traced that salt water or those
  herring-scales."</p>

  <p>"No, we have not; and I can't even make a guess at what they may have
  been. Have you formed any theory on the subject?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have a very definite opinion. But that is of no use. We have an
  abundance of excellent inferences. What we want is some new facts."</p>

  <p>"But surely, Thorndyke," I protested, "a body of facts such as you have
  here, affording a series of probabilities all pointing in the same direction,
  is virtually equivalent to proof?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," he answered. "I distrust a case that rests entirely on
  circumstantial evidence. A learned judge has told us that circumstantial
  evidence, if there is enough of it, is not only as good as but better than
  direct evidence, because direct evidence may be false. I do not agree with
  him. In the first place, direct evidence which may possibly be false is not
  evidence at all. But the evil of circumstantial evidence is that it may yield
  false inferences, as it has often done, and then the whole scheme is
  illusory. My feeling is that circumstantial evidence requires at least one
  point of direct evidence to establish a real connection of its parts with the
  question that is to be proved.</p>

  <p>"For instance, if we could prove directly that Shemrofsky's cab was
  actually at Piper's Row on that Sunday night, we should link up all the other
  facts. Or again, if we could establish the fact of personal contact between
  Sir Edward and any of these suspected persons, that would connect the other
  facts with the murder. Or again, if we could prove by direct evidence that
  the remainder of that rope was or had been in the possession of Gomorrah or
  Trout or Shemrofsky, the other facts, and our inferences from them, would
  immediately become of high evidential value.</p>

  <p>"And that is what we have got to do. We have to obtain at least one
  undeniable fact which will establish incontestably the actual connection of
  one or more of these persons with Sir Edward or with Number Five Piper's
  Row."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I admitted, "I suppose you are right. It is an obscure case, after
  all. And there is one curious feature in it that puzzles me. I can't
  understand what object these men could have had in murdering Sir Edward. Nor
  can I imagine how he came to be in any way mixed up with a parcel of
  ragamuffins like these."</p>

  <p>"Exactly, Jervis," said he. "You have struck the heart of the mystery. How
  came Sir Edward to be in this neighbourhood at all? We infer that he came
  voluntarily in Shemrofsky's cab to Pentecost Grove, probably with some other
  person. But why? And who was that other person? When we ask ourselves those
  questions, we cannot but feel that there is something behind this murder that
  we have not yet got a glimpse of."</p>

  <p>"This seems to have been a conspiracy carried out by a gang of East End
  criminals of the lowest class. Legally speaking, they are no doubt the
  principals in the crime. But I have the feeling&mdash;the very strong
  feeling&mdash;that behind them was some person&mdash;or some persons&mdash;of
  a very different social class, who were pulling the strings. The motive of
  this crime has not yet come into sight. Probably if we can secure the actual
  murderer or murderers, the motive will be revealed. But until it is, our work
  will not be completed. To lay hands on the criminal puppets will not be
  enough. We have to secure the master criminal who has furnished at once the
  directing and the driving force."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-13"
     id="ch-13"></a>XIII. &mdash; MR. BRODRIBB'S DISCOVERY</h2>

  <h3>(DR. JERVIS'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">I AM not quite clear how the matter arose. We had, I
  remember, been discussing with Mr. Brodribb some of the cases in which a
  contact occurs between legal and scientific theory, and eventually the
  conversation drifted towards the subject of personal identity in connection
  with blood relationship and heredity. Mr. Brodribb quoted a novel, the title
  of which has escaped me, and asked for an opinion on the problem in heredity
  that the story presented.</p>

  <p>"I have rather forgotten the book," he said, "but, so far as my memory
  serves me, the story turns upon the appearance in a certain noble or royal
  family of a man who is completely identical in appearance and outward
  characteristics with a more or less remote ancestor&mdash;so completely
  identical that he can be passed off as a survival or re-incarnation of that
  very person. Now, I should like to know whether such a thing can be, in a
  scientific sense, admitted as possible."</p>

  <p>"So should I, and so would a good many other people," I interposed. "But I
  don't think you will get Thorndyke to commit himself to a statement as to the
  possibility or impossibility of any particular form of inheritance."</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed. "A scientist is chary of declaring anything to be
  absolutely impossible. It is better to express it in terms or probability.
  Evidently a probability of one to a thousand millions is in practice
  equivalent to impossibility. The probability is negligible. But the statement
  keeps within the limits of what is known and can be proved."</p>

  <p>"Hm," grunted Brodribb. "Seems rather a hair splitting distinction. But
  what is the answer to my question in terms of probability?"</p>

  <p>"It is not at all simple," replied Thorndyke. "There are quite a number of
  different lines of probability to follow. First there is the multiplication
  of ancestors. A man has two parents, to both of whom he is equally related;
  four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, and so on by a geometrical
  progression. The eighth ancestral generation contains two hundred and
  fifty-six ancestors, to all of whom he is equally related. Then the first
  question is, what is the probability of his completely resembling one of
  these two hundred and fifty-six and bearing no resemblance to the other two
  hundred and fifty-five?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Brodribb, "the probability is negligible. And since de
  minimis non curat lex we may say that it doesn't exist."</p>

  <p>"So it would seem," Thorndyke agreed. "But it is not quite so simple as
  that. Have you given any attention to the subject of Mendelism?</p>

  <p>"Mendelism?" repeated Brodribb, suspiciously. "What's that? Sounds like
  some sort of political claptrap."</p>

  <p>"It is a mode of inheritance," Thorndyke explained, "by which certain
  definite characteristics are transmitted unchanged and undiminished from
  generation to generation. Let us take the case of one such
  characteristic&mdash;colour-blindness, for instance. If a colour-blind man
  marries a normal woman, his children will be apparently normal. His sons will
  be really normal but of his daughters some will be carriers of
  colour-blindness. A proportion of their sons will be colour-blind. If these
  sons marry, the process will be repeated; normal sons, daughters who are
  carriers and whose sons may be colour-blind. Tracing the condition down the
  generations, we find, first a generation of colour-blind men, followed by a
  generation of normal men, followed by a generation of colour-blind men, and
  so on for ever. The defect doesn't die out, but it appears only in alternate
  generations. Now see how this affects your question. Supposing that, of my
  two hundred and fifty-six ancestors of the eighth generation, one had been
  colour-blind. That could not affect me, because I am of the odd generation.
  But my father&mdash;who would have been of the even generation&mdash;might
  have been colour-blind; and if I had had married sisters, I might have had
  colour-blind nephews."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see," said Brodribb, in a slightly depressed tone.</p>

  <p>"And you will also see," pursued Thorndyke, "that this instance will not
  fit your imaginary case. The inheritance is masked by continued change of
  family name. Colour-blind Jones has normal sons, and colour blind grandsons.
  But those grandsons are not named Jones. They are his daughter's sons.
  Suppose his daughter has married a Smith. Then the defect has apparently
  moved out of the Jones family into the Smith family. And so on at each
  reappearance. It always appears associated with a new family name. But this
  will not do for the novelist. For his purpose inheritance must usually be in
  tail male to agree with the devolution of property and titles.</p>

  <p>"But even now we have not opened up the whole problem. We have to consider
  what characteristics go to the making of a visibly distinguishable
  personality and how those characteristics are transmitted from generation to
  generation."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Brodribb admitted, wearily, "it is damned complicated. But there is
  another question, which I was discussing the other day with Middlewick. How
  far is a so-called family likeness to be considered as evidence of actual
  relationship? What do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>"If the likeness were real and would bear detailed comparison," replied
  Thorndyke, "I should attach great importance to it."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by a real likeness?" asked Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"I mean, first, that subtle resemblance of facial character that one finds
  in families. Then special resemblance in particular features, as the nose and
  ears&mdash;especially the ears&mdash;the hands and particularly the
  finger-nails. The nails are nearly as distinctive as the ears. If, added to
  these resemblances, there were similarities of voice and intonation and of
  gait and characteristic bodily movements, I should think that these
  agreements as a whole established a strong probability of blood
  relationship."</p>

  <p>"That was Middlewick's view, though he did not present it in so much
  detail. I have always had rather strong doubts as to the significance of
  apparent personal likeness and I have recently met with a very striking case
  that serves to justify my rather sceptical attitude. I told Middlewick about
  it, but, of course he was not convinced, as I could not produce my example
  for his inspection."</p>

  <p>"We aren't as unbelieving as Middlewick," said I. "Tell us about your
  case."</p>

  <p>Brodribb fortified himself with a sip from his glass and smiled
  reminiscently. "It was an odd experience," said he, "and quite romantic in a
  small way. You remember my telling you about a visit that I paid with Sir
  Giles Farnaby to the studio of my friend and client, Miss Vernet?</p>

  <p>"I remember. It was in connection with the adventure of the disappearing
  pickpocket in the convict suit."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was the occasion. Well, while Miss Vernet was assisting the
  police to search the premises, Sir Giles and I examined the picture that she
  was at work on. It was a large subject picture, called 'An Aristocrat at
  Bay,' showing a French noblewoman of the Revolution period standing in a
  doorway at the top of a flight of steps around which a hostile mob had
  gathered. Miss Vernet was apparently then working at the principal figure,
  for she had a model posed on the studio throne in the correct costume.</p>

  <p>"Now, as soon as Sir Giles clapped eyes on the picture, he uttered an
  exclamation of surprise, and then he drew my attention to what he declared to
  be a most extraordinary coincidence. It seemed that the picture of the French
  lady was an exact counterpart of a portrait by Romney that hangs in the small
  drawing-room at Bradstow, the architrave of the doorway representing the
  frame of the portrait. It was not only that the costume was similar and the
  pose nearly the same&mdash;there would have been nothing very astonishing in
  that; but he declared that the facial resemblance was so perfect that the
  figure in the picture might have been copied from the portrait. I wasn't able
  to confirm this statement at the time, for, although I remembered the
  portrait and recognised the general resemblance, I hadn't his expert eye or
  his memory for faces. But what I could see was that the figure that Miss
  Vernet was painting was a most excellent likeness of the very handsome young
  lady who was posing on the throne.</p>

  <p>"A few days later, however, I had to go down to Bradstow to see the
  bailiff and I then took the opportunity to have a good look at the
  portrait&mdash;which represented a Miss Isabel Hardcastle; and I assure you
  that Sir Giles's statement was absolutely correct. The figure in Miss
  Vernet's picture might have been a portrait of Isabel Hardcastle. But that
  figure, as I have said, was a perfectly admirable portrait of the young lady
  who was acting as the model."</p>

  <p>"That is very interesting, Brodribb," said I. "Quite a picturesque
  incident as you say. But what is it supposed to prove?"</p>

  <p>Brodribb looked at me fiercely. "The testimony of a reputable
  eye-witness," said he, "is good enough for a court of law. But apparently you
  won't accept anything short of the production in evidence of the actual
  things; the portrait, the picture and the model. Must see them with your own
  eyes."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," I protested. "I am not contesting your facts. It is your
  logic that I object to, unless I have misunderstood you. I ask again, what is
  your instance supposed to prove?"</p>

  <p>"It proves," Brodribb replied severely, "that your theory&mdash;and
  Thorndyke's and Middlewick's&mdash;that personal resemblance is evidence of
  blood-relationship, is not supported by observed facts. Here is a portrait of
  Isabel Hardcastle, by a famous painter and presumably like her; and here is a
  young lady, the model, a perfect stranger, who is exactly like that portrait,
  and therefore, presumably, exactly like Isabel Hardcastle."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "you have only proved half of your case. What evidence
  have you that this young lady&mdash;Miss Vernet's model&mdash;is not a
  blood-relation of Isabel Hardcastle?"</p>

  <p>Brodribb turned as red as a lobster (boiled) and began to gobble like a
  turkey. Then, suddenly, he stopped and gazed at me with his mouth slightly
  open.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I suppose you are right, Jervis. Of course I was taking
  that for granted."</p>

  <p>With this he let the argument drop and seemed to lose interest in the
  subject for he sat sipping his wine with a profoundly reflective air but
  speaking no word. After sitting thus for some time, he roused himself by a
  visible effort, and, having emptied his glass, rose to take his leave. But
  even as he shook our hands and moved towards the door, I had the impression
  that he was still deep in thought, and I seemed to detect in his bearing a
  certain something suggestive of a settled purpose.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Jervis," said Thorndyke, as our friend's footsteps died away
  on the stairs, "you have given Brodribb a sleepless night and perhaps sent
  him off to explore a mare's nest. I hope he has not taken you too
  seriously."</p>

  <p>"If you come to that," I retorted, "you are the real offender. It was you
  who tried to prove that ancestral characteristics might reappear after
  several generations&mdash;and you didn't do it."</p>

  <p>"No," he admitted, "the argument came to a premature end. Mendelian
  factors were too much for Brodribb. But it is an interesting problem; I mean
  the question as to the number of factors that go to the making of a
  recognisable personality and the possibilities of their transmission. The
  idea of a more or less complete re-incarnation is attractive and romantic,
  though I am afraid that the laws of chance don't offer much encouragement.
  But to return to Brodribb; I deeply suspect that you have sent him off in
  search of a re-incarnated Isabel Hardcastle. I only hope that he won't be too
  seriously disappointed."</p>

  <p>"I hope so, too. When I saw how he took my objection, I was sorry I had
  spoken. For poor old Brodribb would give his eyes to discover some hitherto
  unknown Hardcastle whose claim he could set up against that of the present
  heir presumptive, though I don't see that a young lady would help him, seeing
  that the settlement is in tail male."</p>

  <p>"No; but he is probably looking farther afield. We may safely assume the
  existence of at least one male relative, alive or dead."</p>

  <p>"Yes, she certainly must have, or have had, a father. But there again one
  doesn't see any loophole for Brodribb. There can't be any unknown members of
  the family nearer to Sir Edward than David Hardcastle, unless he is thinking
  of the elusive Gervase. Perhaps he is."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that he is," said Thorndyke, "and I wish him luck though
  it doesn't look like a very hopeful quest. But time will show."</p>

  <p>In effect, time did show and the time was not very long. Our suspicions as
  to Brodribb's activities were fully justified. He had 'gone a-angling'. But
  the fish that he landed was as great a surprise to himself as to us.</p>

  <p>The news reached us four days after the conversation which I have
  recorded. It was brought by him in person, and even before he spoke, we knew
  by the way in which he danced into the room, fairly effervescing with
  excitement, that something of more than common import had happened.</p>

  <p>"Congratulate me, gentlemen," he exclaimed. "I have made a discovery,
  thanks to Jervis's confounded leg-pulling."</p>

  <p>He flopped down in a chair, and, when we had made suitable demonstrations
  of curiosity, he continued: "I have been making enquiries about the young
  lady who was posing as the Aristocrat for Miss Vernet."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" I exclaimed. "And who is she?"</p>

  <p>"That I can't say exactly at the moment. But, to begin with, she is a he.
  The young lady turns out to be a boy."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said I, "we smell a mystery."</p>

  <p>"You smell the solution of a mystery," he corrected. "The young lady is
  not only a boy. She is the boy."</p>

  <p>"The boy?" Thorndyke repeated enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the boy. The disappearing pickpocket. The gentleman in the convict
  suit. The police were quite right, after all. He had popped in through the
  open studio window. But I had better begin the story at the beginning.</p>

  <p>"It appears that this lad&mdash;Jasper Gray by name&mdash;is employed by a
  firm of wholesale stationers, Sturt and Wopsalls, to deliver parcels. He
  seems to be a highly respectable youth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With a secret pocket in the back of his waistcoat," I murmured.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is a queer feature, I must admit," said Brodribb. "But both the
  ladies seem to have the highest opinion of his character."</p>

  <p>"Plausible young rascal, I expect," I said. "Naturally, he would be able
  to bamboozle a pair of innocent spinsters."</p>

  <p>"That is quite possible," Brodribb admitted, "and he is certainly most
  unusually good-looking. I saw that, for myself, though the wig and the
  costume may have helped. But to continue; he came to the studio to deliver a
  roll of paper, and Miss Vernet was so struck with his appearance that she
  persuaded him to pose for the principal figure in her picture. It was a
  regular arrangement. He came and took up the pose every morning before going
  to work.</p>

  <p>"Now you see how the escape was managed: When he found himself in the
  Tottenham Court Road in a prison suit, he simply made a bee-line for the
  studio. He knew about the open window and made straight for it and sprang in.
  Then the two women bundled him into the dressing-room where he made a quick
  change into his costume. They hid the prison clothes and he took up his pose
  on the throne. By the time the police arrived he had become transformed into
  a lady of the old noblesse. It was a delightful comedy. Now I can appreciate
  the solemn way in which Miss Vernet conducted the two unsuspecting constables
  over the premises to search for the missing convict."</p>

  <p>"Can you?" said I, with mock severity. "I am surprised at you, Brodribb, a
  respectable solicitor, chortling over a manifest conspiracy to defeat the
  ends of justice. You are not forgetting that secret pocket or the fact that
  Sir Edward Hardcastle's seal was found in it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am not," he replied. "That is the importance of the
  discovery. I expect he picked the seal up, though as you say, there is the
  secret pocket to be accounted for. But we shall soon know all about it. Miss
  Vernet has arranged for him to meet me at the studio the day after to-morrow.
  He was quite willing and he is prepared to tell me anything I want to know. I
  suggested that you might come with me and there was no objection to that, so
  I hope you will be able to come. It ought to be quite interesting to us all.
  What do you say?"</p>

  <p>There was no doubt in my mind as to what Thorndyke would say, for,
  evidently, this young scallywag was one of the indispensable missing
  links.</p>

  <p>"I will come with you with the greatest pleasure," he replied, "and no
  doubt Jervis will come too and add to the gaiety of the proceedings."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Brodribb. "I will let Miss Vernet know." And with this he
  took his departure with an appearance of satisfaction that seemed to me to be
  somewhat disproportionate to the results of his embassy. For, whereas to us
  the tracing of the seal held untold potentialities of enlightenment, to
  Brodribb it could appear no more than a matter of curious and trivial
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed when I commented on Brodribb's remarkable
  self-complacency. "I had the same impression. Believing as he does, that Sir
  Edward made away with himself, he can have no reason for attaching any
  special significance to the fact that the seal was in the lad's possession.
  But he is obviously extremely pleased with himself; and I suspect we shall
  find that he has not disclosed to us the whole of his discovery. But we shall
  see."</p>

  <p>And in due course we did see.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-14"
     id="ch-14"></a>XIV. &mdash; NEW LIGHT ON THE PROBLEM</h2>

  <h3>(JASPER GRAY'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was while I was carrying out some improvements on the
  studio skylight that Miss Vernet made her momentous communication. Of course,
  she didn't know that it was momentous. Neither did I. You never do.
  Providence has a way of keeping these little surprises up its sleeve and
  letting them fly at you when you are looking the other way.</p>

  <p>But it was not only her communication that held such unsuspected
  potentialities. My very occupation, trivial and commonplace as it appeared,
  was fraught with a hidden significance which it was presently to develop
  together with that of other seemingly trifling actions.</p>

  <p>At the moment, I was standing on the top of a rickety pair of steps which
  Miss Vernet was anxiously steadying while I fastened a rope to a swinging fan
  light. Hitherto that fan-light had been clumsily adjusted from below with the
  aid of a sort of boat-hook. Now, by means of the rope and a cleat on the
  wall, it could be conveniently set at any angle and securely fixed.</p>

  <p>As I came down the steps, having completed the job, Miss Vernet murmured
  her thanks, mingled with expressions of admiration at the ingenuity of the
  arrangement. Then, after a pause, she said a little hesitatingly: "I have a
  confession to make, Jasper. I hope you won't be angry, but I have to a
  certain extent broken your confidence."</p>

  <p>I looked at her in surprise but made no comment. There was nothing to say
  until I knew what she meant, so I waited for her to continue.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember Mr. Brodribb?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I think so," I replied. "Isn't he the gentleman with beautiful silky
  white hair who came with Sir Giles to look at your picture?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said eagerly. "I am glad you remember him. Well, for some
  reason, he is greatly interested in you. He came here yesterday on purpose to
  ask me about you. He put quite a lot of questions, which, of course, I
  couldn't answer, but I did let out about your coming here in those prison
  clothes."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" I exclaimed. "What does it matter? I don't mind his
  knowing. I don't care who knows now that the affair is over and we have sent
  the clothes back." (I had addressed the parcel myself to the Governor of
  Pentonville Prison and delivered it in person at the gate.)</p>

  <p>She was obviously relieved at my attitude, but I could see that there was
  something more to come.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why he is so concerned about you," she continued, "but he
  assures me that his interest is a proper and legitimate interest and not mere
  curiosity. He would very much like to meet you and ask you one or two
  questions. He thinks that you might be able to give him some information that
  would be very valuable and helpful to him. Do you think you would mind
  meeting him here one day?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I shouldn't. Why should I? But I think he must be mistaken if
  he thinks I could tell him anything that would matter to him."</p>

  <p>"Well, that is his affair," said she, "and naturally you won't tell him
  anything that you don't want to. I am sure, when you meet him, you will like
  him very much. Everybody does."</p>

  <p>Accordingly we proceeded to arrange the date of the meeting which was
  fixed for the ensuing Thursday afternoon, subject to my obtaining leave of
  absence from Sturt and Wopsalls; and then, as an afterthought, Miss Vernet
  mentioned that Mr. Brodribb would like to bring a friend and fellow lawyer
  with him. This sounded rather portentous, but I made no objection; and when I
  went away (having secured the rope on its cleat) I left Miss Vernet happy in
  having success fully carried out the negotiations on Mr. Brodribb's
  behalf.</p>

  <p>Sturt and Wopsalls raised no difficulties about the afternoon off, it
  being the first time that I had ever made such a request. I cleared up most
  of the deliveries in a strenuous morning, and, having made myself as
  presentable as the resources of my wardrobe permitted, presented myself at
  the studio punctually at three o'clock in the afternoon. I was the first
  arrival and thereby was enabled to assist the two ladies in setting out a
  tea-table that made my mouth water; and I was amused to observe that, of the
  three, I was the only one who was not in a most almighty twitter.</p>

  <p>But even my self-possession sustained a slight jar when the visitors
  arrived; for Mr. Brodribb had gone beyond the contract and brought two
  friends with him; both, as I assumed, lawyers. But it appeared that I was
  mistaken, for it turned out that they were doctors. And yet, later, it seemed
  as if they were lawyers. It was rather confusing. However, they were all very
  agreeable gentlemen and they all addressed me as "Mr. Gray," which caused me
  to swell with secret pride and induced in Miss Brandon a tendency to
  giggles.</p>

  <p>One thing which astonished me was their indifference to the delicacies
  with which the table was loaded. I had seen such things in pastry cooks'
  windows and had wondered sometimes if they tasted as well as they looked. Now
  I knew. The answer was in the affirmative. But these gentlemen trifled
  negligently with those incredible cakes and pastries as if they had been
  common 'tommy', and as for Mr. Brodribb he positively ate nothing at all.
  However, the delicacies weren't wasted. Miss Vernet knew my capacity for
  disposing of nourishment and kept a supply moving in my direction.</p>

  <p>Of course, there were no questions asked while we were having tea. The
  gentlemen mostly talked with the ladies about pictures and painting and
  models, and very entertaining their conversation was, only I found myself
  wishing that Mr. Brodribb had taken something to eat to distract his
  attention from me. For whenever I glanced at him, I met his bright blue eye
  fixed on me with an intensity of interest that would have destroyed my
  appetite if the food had not been so unusually alluring. Not that he was the
  only observer. I was distinctly conscious that his two friends, Dr. Jervis
  and Dr. Thorndyke, were 'taking stock of me', as our packer would express it;
  but they didn't devour me with their eyes as Mr. Brodribb did.</p>

  <p>As the closing phases of the meal set in, the conversation turned from the
  subject of pictures and models in general to Miss Vernet's picture and her
  model in particular, and while the two ladies were clearing away, I was
  persuaded to go to the dressing-room and put on my costume for the visitors'
  entertainment. When I came forth and took up my pose on the throne, my
  appearance was greeted with murmurs of applause by all, but especially by Mr.
  Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly amazing," he exclaimed. "I assure you Thorndyke, that the
  resemblance is positively photographic."</p>

  <p>"Do you think," Dr. Thorndyke asked, "that you are making full allowance
  for the costume and the pose?</p>

  <p>"I think so," Mr. Brodribb answered. "To me the facial resemblance seems
  most striking. I should like you to see the portrait for yourself. Nothing
  short of that I know will convince you."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said Dr. Thorndyke, "we can understand how those
  unfortunate constables were deluded. I am all agog to hear Mr. Gray's account
  of that comedy of errors."</p>

  <p>On this hint I retired once more to shed my gorgeous plumage and when I
  returned to the studio, I found half a dozen chairs arranged and the audience
  in waiting.</p>

  <p>"Now, Jasper," said Miss Vernet, "you understand that Mr. Brodribb wants
  you to tell us the story in full detail. You are not to leave anything
  out."</p>

  <p>I grinned a little uncomfortably and felt my face growing hot and red.
  "There isn't much to tell," I mumbled, "I expect Miss Vernet has told you all
  there is."</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said Mr. Brodribb, "we want the whole story. To begin with,
  what took you to the River Lea?"</p>

  <p>I explained about the parcel and the railway journey, and having thus
  broken the ice, and got fairly started, I went on to recount the successive
  events of that day of mingled joy and terror, gradually warming to my task
  under the influence of the genuine interest and amusement that my audience
  manifested. So great was their appreciation that&mdash;my shyness being now
  quite dissipated&mdash;I was quite sorry when I had brought my adventures
  down to the moment when I changed into my costume and took up my pose. For
  that was the end of my story&mdash;at least I thought it was. But my legal
  friends soon undeceived me. The end of the story was the beginning of the
  cross-examination.</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb started the ball. "When that convict ran off with your
  clothes did he take anything of value with them? Anything in the pockets, I
  mean."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "There was my return ticket in the trousers' pocket and
  an emerald in a secret pocket at the back of the waistcoat."</p>

  <p>"An emerald?" said Mr. Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was a green stone of some kind and it must have come out of a
  signet ring, because it had a seal engraved on it; a little castle with a
  motto underneath&mdash;'Strong in Defence'&mdash;and above it the head of
  some sort of animal that looked rather like a crocodile."</p>

  <p>"What is known in heraldry as a Wyvern, I think. Now would you recognise
  an impression of that seal?"</p>

  <p>I assured him that I most certainly should, where upon he carefully
  extracted from a pocket letter-case an envelope on which was a black
  seal.</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, handing it to me, "just look at that seal and tell me if
  you think it was made with the stone that you had."</p>

  <p>I looked at the seal and glanced at the address on the envelope, and then
  I grinned.</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure it was," I answered, "because I made it myself."</p>

  <p>"The deuce you did!" exclaimed Mr. Brodribb. "How was that?"</p>

  <p>I described the incident of the dropped letter and was rather surprised at
  the amount of amusement it created, for I didn't see anything particularly
  funny in it. But they did; especially Dr. Jervis, who laughed until he had to
  wipe his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, gentlemen," said he, "but the recollection of the great
  pow-wow in New Square was too much for me. Mr. Gray had us all guessing that
  time."</p>

  <p>"Yes," chuckled Mr. Brodribb, "we were a trifle out of our depth, though I
  would remind you that Thorndyke gave us practically the correct solution.
  But, now, I wonder if you would mind, Mr. Gray, telling us how that seal
  stone came into your possession?"</p>

  <p>I had been expecting this question, and obviously it had got to be
  answered. For the seal had probably been stolen and I had to make it clear
  that it had not been stolen by me. It would not he enough merely to say that
  I had found it.</p>

  <p>"I have no objection at all," said I, "but it is rather a long story."</p>

  <p>"So much the better," said Dr. Jervis, "if it is as amusing as the last.
  But tell us the whole of it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," urged Dr. Thorndyke, "begin at the beginning and don't be afraid of
  going into detail. We want to know all about that seal."</p>

  <p>My recent experience in Pentecost Grove had completely cured me of any
  tendency to reticence. Here was an opportunity to expose that nest of
  criminals and I resolved to take it. Accordingly, in obedience to Dr.
  Thorndyke's directions, I began with the incident of the truck and the
  egg-chest and recounted in full detail all the adventures and perils of that
  unforgettable day.</p>

  <p>"Bless the boy!" exclaimed Miss Vernet, as I described my entry into the
  egg-chest on the schooner's deck, "he is a regular Sindbad the Sailor! But
  don't let me interrupt."</p>

  <p>She did interrupt, nevertheless, from time to time, with ejaculations of
  astonishment and horror. But what interested me especially was the effect of
  my story on the three men. They all listened with rapt attention, especially
  Dr. Thorndyke; and I had the feeling that they were comparing what I was
  telling them with something that they already knew. For instance, when I
  described Ebbstein's house and the work-room with the goose on the fire and
  the sour smell and the big tub of herrings and cabbage, Dr. Jervis seemed to
  start; and then he turned to Dr. Thorndyke, and looked at him in a most
  singular way. And Dr. Thorndyke caught his eye and nodded as if he understood
  that look.</p>

  <p>When I came to my escape from Ebbstein's house I hesitated for a moment,
  being, for some reason, a little unwilling to tell them about Miss Stella.
  But I had promised to give them the whole story and I felt that perhaps this
  part, too, might mean more to them than it did to me. So I described the
  rescue in detail and related how we had escaped together. And very glad I was
  that I had not held anything back. For I could see at once by Dr. Jervis's
  manner and expression that there was more in my story than I had
  understood.</p>

  <p>"I hope," Miss Vernet interrupted as I was describing the escape from the
  empty house, "that you didn't kill that unfortunate wretch. It would really
  have served him right, but still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's all right," I reassured her. "I didn't kill him. I've seen him
  since."</p>

  <p>This statement Dr. Thorndyke noted in a book which he had produced from
  his pocket and in which I had observed him jotting down short notes from time
  to time with a view, as I discovered later, to cross-examination, and to
  avoid interrupting my narrative. He was evidently deeply interested; much
  more so, I noticed, than Mr. Brodribb, who, in fact, listened with an air of
  rather detached amusement.</p>

  <p>I now went on to describe our meeting with the hansom; and at the mention
  of that vehicle and the driver's name, Louis, Dr. Jervis uttered an
  exclamation of surprise or excitement. But the climax, for me, came when I
  brought my story to a close with our arrival at Miss Stella's house. Then, in
  an instant, Mr. Brodribb's detached interest gave place to the most intense
  excitement. He sat up with a jerk, and, having stared at me in astonished
  silence for a few moments, demanded:</p>

  <p>"Dorchester Square, you say? You don't remember the number, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"It was number sixty-three," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed; and then, "You didn't happen to learn the young lady's
  name?"</p>

  <p>"I heard the footman refer to her as Miss Stella."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Mr. Brodribb again. Then he turned to Dr. Thorndyke and said in
  a low, deeply impressive tone: "Stella Hardcastle. Paul's daughter, you
  know."</p>

  <p>Dr. Thorndyke nodded. I think he had already guessed who she was&mdash;and
  for a little while no one spoke. It was Mr. Brodribb who broke the silence.
  "I've been a fool, Thorndyke. For the first&mdash;and last&mdash;time, I have
  set my judgement against yours. And I was wrong. I see it plainly enough now.
  I only hope that my folly has not caused a fatal hindrance."</p>

  <p>Dr. Thorndyke looked at him with an extraordinarily pleasant smile as he
  replied: "We assumed that you would alter your mind when some of the facts
  emerged, and we have been working on that assumption." Then, turning to me,
  he said: "I have quite a number of questions to ask you, Mr. Gray. First of
  all, about that rope. You mentioned that you threw it on the foot board of
  the cab. Did you leave it there?"</p>

  <p>Now, I had already noticed Dr. Thorndyke looking rather hard, now and
  again, at the rope that hung from the skylight, so I wasn't surprised at his
  question. But what followed did surprise me most uncommonly.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "I brought it away with me."</p>

  <p>"And what has become of it?"</p>

  <p>I grinned (for I was pretty sure that he had 'ogled' it, as our packer
  would say), and pointed to the rope. "That is it," said I.</p>

  <p>"The deuce it is!" exclaimed Dr. Jervis. "And a brown rope, too. This
  looks like another windfall, Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"It does," the latter agreed; and, rising, he stepped over to the cleat
  and taking the two ends of the rope in his hands, looked at them closely.
  Then he brought a magnifying-glass out of his pocket and had a look at them
  through that.</p>

  <p>"Were both of these ends whipped when you found the rope?" he asked as Dr.
  Jervis took the glass from him and examined the ends through it.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "Only one end was whipped. I did the other end
  myself&mdash;the one with the white whipping."</p>

  <p>He nodded and glanced at Dr. Jervis, who also nodded. Then he asked: "Do
  you think, Miss Vernet, that we might have this rope down to examine a little
  more completely?"</p>

  <p>"But, of course," she replied. "Jasper will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I didn't hear the finish, for I was off, hot-foot for the steps. Evidently
  there was mystery in the air and it was a mystery that I was concerned with.
  I had the rope down in a twinkling and handed it to Dr. Thorndyke, who had
  just taken possession of the studio yard measure, which he now passed to Dr.
  Jervis.</p>

  <p>"Measure the rope carefully, Jervis, and don't pull it out too taut."</p>

  <p>I helped Dr. Jervis to take the measurement, laying the rope on the table
  and pulling it just taut but not stretching it, while Mr. Brodribb and the
  two ladies looked on, mightily interested and a good deal puzzled by the
  proceedings. When we had made the measurement, Dr. Jervis wrote the length
  down on a scrap of paper and then did the measurement over again with
  practically the same result. Then he laid the yard measure down and asked:
  "What do you say the length is, Thorndyke?"</p>

  <p>"If the whole remainder is there," was the reply, "it should be forty-six
  feet, four and a half inches."</p>

  <p>"It is forty-six feet, five inches," said Dr. Jervis, "which we may take
  as complete agreement."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Dr. Thorndyke, "the difference is negligible. We may take it
  as certain that this is the remainder."</p>

  <p>"The remainder of what?" demanded Mr. Brodribb. "I see that you have
  identified this rope. What does that identification tell you?"</p>

  <p>"It tells us," Dr. Thorndyke replied, "that this rope was stolen from
  Black Eagle Dock, Wapping, when it was sixty feet long; that a piece thirteen
  feet, seven inches long was cut off it; that that piece was taken in a
  two-wheeled vehicle&mdash;probably a hansom cab&mdash;on the night of Sunday,
  the twenty-first of June, to Number Five, Piper's Row, Stratford. Those facts
  emerge from the identification of this rope, from Mr. Gray's story and from
  certain other data that we have accumulated."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Mr. Brodribb. "Then this was the very rope!
  Horrible, horrible! But, my dear Thorndyke, you seem to have the whole of the
  case cut and dried! Can you give the villain a name?"</p>

  <p>"We shall not mention names prematurely," he replied. "But we haven't
  finished with Mr. Gray yet. I think he has something more to tell us. Isn't
  it so? You said just now that you had seen the man whom you knocked on the
  head on some later occasion. Would you mind telling us about that?"</p>

  <p>I didn't mind at all. On the contrary, I was only too delighted to put my
  new knowledge into such obviously capable hands. Therefore I embarked
  joyfully on a detailed narrative of my journey of exploration, to which Dr.
  Thorndyke listened with the closest attention, jotting down notes as I
  proceeded but never interrupting. Others, however, were less restrained,
  particularly Mr. Brodribb, who, when I had described the murderous attempt of
  the man with the knife, broke in excitedly: "You say that this man spoke in
  French to the other."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and quite good French, too."</p>

  <p>"Then we may take it that you understand French?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I speak French pretty fluently. You see, I was born in France or
  Belgium&mdash;I am not quite sure which&mdash;and we lived in France until I
  was nearly four. So French was the first language that I learnt. And my
  father speaks it perfectly, and we often converse in French to keep up our
  knowledge of the language."</p>

  <p>He nodded as if the matter were quite important. Then he asked: "You say
  that this man accused you of having robbed him of a fortune?"</p>

  <p>"Yes"; and here I repeated the exact words that the man had used.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea what he meant?"</p>

  <p>"Not the least. So far as I know, I had never seen him before."</p>

  <p>"You didn't by any chance hear what his name was?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did. He gave the name of Jacob Silberstein to the policeman. But
  that was not his name. I heard two of the people call him Mr.
  Zichlinsky."</p>

  <p>At this Mr. Brodribb fairly exploded. I have never seen a man so excited.
  He spluttered two or three times as if he was going to speak, and then,
  whisking an envelope out of his pocket, scrawled something on it, and,
  apologising to the rest of us, passed it to Dr. Thorndyke, who glanced at it
  and handed it to Dr. Jervis, remarking: "This is extremely valuable
  confirmation of what we had inferred. It seems definitely to establish the
  fact that Maurice Zichlinsky is in England&mdash;assuming this to be Maurice,
  of which I have little doubt."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb stared at him in astonishment. "How did you know that his
  name was Maurice?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"We have been looking into matters, you know," said Dr. Thorndyke. "But we
  mustn't interrupt Mr. Gray or he may overlook something important."</p>

  <p>I had not, however, much more to tell, and when that little was told, I
  waited for the inevitable cross-examination.</p>

  <p>"There are one or two points that I should like to have cleared up," said
  Dr. Thorndyke, glancing at his notes. "First, as to the cab that you saw in
  the yard. You seem to have had a good look at it. I wonder if you noticed
  anything unusual about the near wheel?"</p>

  <p>"I noticed one thing," said I, "because I looked for it. There was a deep
  notch on the edge of the tyre. I fancy I made that notch when I bumped the
  cab over a sharp corner-stone. The tyre was worn very thin. I wonder that the
  jolt didn't break the wheel."</p>

  <p>"It is a mercy that it didn't," said he. "However, the notch was what we
  wanted to know about. And now, as to the names and addresses of these people.
  Can you give us those?"</p>

  <p>"The street that I went to is Pentecost Grove. Ebbstein, and Jonas, the
  coiner, live at Number Forty nine. Gomorrah lives next door, Number Fifty,
  the house in which I found Miss Stella. Zichlinsky lives there, too. He
  lodges with Gomorrah. The cab-yard turns out of Pentecost Grove just opposite
  Ebbstein's house. It is called Zion Place. I don't know where Trout
  lives."</p>

  <p>"He lives in Shadwell," said Dr. Thorndyke. "We have his address." On
  hearing which, Mr. Brodribb chuckled and shook his head. I think he found the
  doctor as astonishing as I did. He seemed to know everything. However, this
  seemed to finish the cross-examination, for Dr. Thorndyke now rose to depart
  and took leave of the ladies with polite acknowledgments of their
  hospitality. As he shook hands with me, he gave me a few directions
  concerning the rope.</p>

  <p>"You had better put it away in a safe place," said he, "and remember that
  it is of the greatest value, as it will be produced in evidence in an
  important case. When the police take possession of it, which they will
  probably do very shortly, they will want you to certify to its identity. I
  will send you a rope to replace it for the skylight."</p>

  <p>Finally, he took down my address in case he might have to write to me, and
  then he turned to Mr. Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"You are not coming with us, are you?" he asked. "No," replied Mr.
  Brodribb. "I want to have a few words with Mr. Gray on another matter.
  Perhaps, if he is going homeward, I may walk part of the way with him."</p>

  <p>On this hint, I, too, made preparations for departure, and we issued forth
  together in the wake of the two doctors.</p>

  <p>"I want you to understand," said Mr. Brodribb as we walked up the mews,
  "that I am not poking my nose into your affairs from mere curiosity. If I
  seem to ask impertinent questions, believe me I have very good reasons."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand that, sir," said I, wondering what the deuce was
  coming next. Nothing came for a little while, but at length he opened
  fire.</p>

  <p>"You mentioned just now that you lived abroad in your early childhood.
  Have you any recollection of how and where you lived?"</p>

  <p>"Very little. I was quite a small child when we came to England. I
  remember seeing dogs harnessed in carts and I have a dim recollection of an
  old woman in a big white cap who used to look after us. I expect we were very
  poor, but a little child doesn't notice that."</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Brodribb with a sigh. "There are many advantages in being
  young. You don't remember your mother?"</p>

  <p>"No. She died when I was quite an infant. But she must have been a very
  good woman, for my father once said to me that she had been a saint on earth
  and was now an angel in heaven. I think he was very devoted to her."</p>

  <p>Rather to my surprise, Mr. Brodribb appeared to be deeply moved by my
  reply. For some time he walked on in silence, but at length, he asked: "Did
  you ever hear what your mother's name was?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Her Christian name was Phillipa."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Mr. Brodribb in a tone of deep significance; and I wondered
  why. But I was quite prepared for his next question. "Your father, I take it,
  is a man of considerable education?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir. He is quite a learned man. He is a classical
  tutor&mdash;crams fellows for examinations in classics and mathematics."</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to know if he was always a tutor, or if he ever had any
  other vocation?"</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," said I, "that he was at one time a clergyman."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Probably. Clergymen often do become tutors. You haven't any idea, I
  suppose, why he abandoned his vocation as a clergyman?"</p>

  <p>I hesitated. I didn't like the thought of disclosing poor old Ponty's
  failings, but I remembered what Mr. Brodribb had said. And, obviously, there
  was something behind these questions.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, sir," I said, at length, "there is no harm in my confiding in
  you. The fact is that my father is not very careful in the matter of
  stimulants. He doesn't ever get intoxicated, you know, but he sometimes takes
  a little more than would be quite good for a clergyman. I expect it is due to
  the rather dull, lonely life that he leads."</p>

  <p>"No doubt, no doubt," said Mr. Brodribb, speaking with a singular
  gentleness. "I have noticed that classical tutors frequently seem to feel the
  need of stimulants. And it is, as you say, a dull life for a man of
  culture."</p>

  <p>He paused, and seemed to be in a little difficulty, for after an interval
  he resumed in a slightly hesitating manner: "I have a sort of
  idea&mdash;rather vague and indefinite&mdash;but I have the feeling that I
  may have been slightly acquainted with your father many years ago, and I
  should very much like, if it could be managed, to see whether my memory is or
  is not playing me false. I don't suppose your father cares much for
  encounters with strangers?"</p>

  <p>"No, he does not. He is extremely reserved and solitary."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. Now if I could get an opportunity of seeing him without making
  any formal occasion&mdash;just a casual inspection, you know, even by passing
  him in the street&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think you might have a chance now, sir," said I. "He has a teaching
  appointment from four to six on Thursdays and usually comes straight home. It
  is now a few minutes to six, so if we step out, we shall probably meet him.
  If we do, I will point him out to you and then you would like me to leave
  you, I expect."</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind, I think it would be better," said he; "and if I may
  make a suggestion, it would be as well, for the present, if you made no
  mention of this conversation or of your having met me."</p>

  <p>I had already reached this conclusion and said so; and for a while we
  walked on at a slightly quickened pace in silence. As we crossed the top of
  Queen Square by the ancient pump that stands in the middle of the crossing, I
  began to keep a sharp look-out, for Ponty was now due; and we had hardly
  crossed to the corner of Great Ormond Street when I saw the familiar figure
  turn in from Lamb's Conduit Street and come creeping along the pavement
  towards us.</p>

  <p>"That is my father, sir," said I; "that old gentleman with the stoop and
  the walking-stick."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Mr. Brodribb. "He has something under his arm."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered; and there being no use in blinking the fact, I added:
  "I expect it is a bottle. Good evening, sir."</p>

  <p>He shook my hand warmly and I ran on ahead and dived into our entry. But I
  didn't run up the stairs. A reasonable and natural curiosity impelled me to
  linger and see what came of this meeting. For some thing told me that Mr.
  Brodribb could, if he chose, enlighten the mystery of my father's past on
  which I had often vaguely speculated, and that these presentproceedings might
  not be without some significance for me.</p>

  <p>From the entry I watched the two men approach one another and I thought
  they were going to pass. But they did not. Mr. Brodribb halted and accosted
  Ponty, apparently to ask for some direction, for I saw my father point with
  his stick. Then, instead of going on his way, Mr. Brodribb lingered as if to
  ask some further questions. A short conversation followed&mdash;a very short
  one. Then the two old gentlemen bowed to one another ceremoniously and
  separated. Mr. Brodribb strode away down the street and Pontifex came
  creeping homeward more slowly than ever with his chin on his breast and
  something rather dejected in his manner.</p>

  <p>He made no reference to the meeting when he entered the room, whither I
  had preceded him, but silently placed the bottle on the mantelpiece. He was
  very thoughtful and quiet that evening, and the matter of his thoughts did
  not appear to be exhilarating. Indeed he seemed to be in such low spirits
  that I found myself wishing that Mr. Brodribb had taken less interest in our
  affairs. And yet, as I watched poor old Pontifex despondently broaching the
  new bottle, my thoughts kept drifting back to that meeting and those few
  words of conversation; and again the suspicion would creep into my mind that
  perhaps the shadows of coming events were already falling upon me.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-15"
     id="ch-15"></a>XV. &mdash; THORNDYKE'S PLAN OF ATTACK</h2>

  <h3>(DR. JERVIS'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">"A MOST astonishing experience, Thorndyke," I commented as
  we walked away from Miss Vernet's studio after our meeting with Jasper Gray
  (recorded above in his own words).</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed; "and not the least astonishing part of it was the boy
  himself. A truly Olympian errand boy. I have never seen anything like
  him."</p>

  <p>"Nor have I. As an advertisement of democracy he would be worth his weight
  in gold to a propagandist. If he could be seen strolling across the
  quadrangle of an Oxford College, old-fashioned persons would point him out as
  a type of the young British aristocrat. Yet the amazing fact is that he is
  just a stationer's errand boy."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. "I am afraid, Jervis," said he, "that as a
  demonstration of the essential equality of men he would fail, as
  demonstrations of that kind are apt to do on going into particulars. Our
  young friend's vocabulary and accent and his manners and bearing, while they
  fit his personal appearance well enough, are quite out of character with his
  ostensible social status. There is some mystery in his background. But we
  needn't concern ourselves with it, for I can see that Brodribb's curiosity is
  at white heat. We can safely leave the private enquiries to him."</p>

  <p>"Yes. And I suspect that he is pursuing them at this moment. But, speaking
  of Brodribb, I think you rather took his breath away. He was positively
  staggered at the amount of knowledge that you disclosed. And I don't wonder.
  He was hardly exaggerating when he said that you had the whole case cut and
  dried."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't put it so high as that," said Thorndyke. "We can now be
  confident that we shall lay our hands on the murderer, but we haven't done it
  yet. We have advanced our investigations another stage and I think the end is
  in sight. But we have yet another stage before us."</p>

  <p>"It is surprising," I remarked, "how our knowledge of the case has
  advanced step by step, almost imperceptibly."</p>

  <p>"It is," he agreed, "and an intensely interesting experience it has been,
  to watch it closing in from the vaguest generalities to the most complete
  particularity. We began with a purely speculative probability of murder. Then
  the murder became an established fact and its methods and procedure
  ascertained. But the perpetrators remained totally unknown to us and even
  unguessed at. Then, as you say, step by step, our knowledge advanced. One
  figure after another came into view, first as mere contacts with the known
  circumstances, then as possible suspects, until at last we seem to have the
  whole group in view and can begin to assign to each his place in the
  conspiracy."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," said I, "that Jasper Gray's information should help us
  to do that off-hand."</p>

  <p>"It is extremely valuable," he replied. "But the enormous importance of
  what he has told us is really tactical. He has placed an invaluable weapon in
  our hands."</p>

  <p>"What weapon do you mean?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I mean the power to make an arrest whenever we please. And that, when the
  moment comes, will be the very keystone of our tactics."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see either point; how we have the power or what special
  value it is. You wouldn't suggest an arrest before you are prepared to prove
  the murder charge against a definite person."</p>

  <p>"But that, I suspect, is precisely what we shall have to do. Let me
  explain. The abduction of Miss Hardcastle is a new fact. It is very
  illuminating to us, but we can't prove that it was connected with the murder
  of Sir Edward. Nevertheless, it is a crime, and we actually know two of the
  guilty parties, Shemrofsky and Gomorrah. With Gray's assistance, we could lay
  a sworn information now; and on his and Miss Stella's evidence, we could
  secure a conviction. Of course, we shall not do anything of the kind. We have
  got to make sure of the woman who lured the girl away. Brodribb evidently
  suspects that she is Mrs. David Hardcastle&mdash;at least that is what I
  gathered when he wrote down her maiden name, Marie Zichlinsky, for our
  information&mdash;and I think he is probably right. You remember that she had
  a brother who was convicted in Russia of a conspiracy to murder. He also
  thinks that the Zichlinsky who tried to murder Gray is that brother. And
  again I suspect that he is right.</p>

  <p>"But these are only suspicions, and we cannot rush into action on
  suspicions. We have to prove them right or wrong. If we can turn our
  suspicions into demonstrable truths, we shall have our whole case complete
  and can act at once and with confidence."</p>

  <p>"Then what do you propose to do?"</p>

  <p>"First, I propose to settle the question, if I can, as to whether the
  Zichlinsky of Pentecost Grove is the Maurice Zichlinsky whose finger-prints
  are in the records at Scotland Yard. If he is the same man, I shall then try
  to ascertain if the convict, Maurice Zichlinsky, is Mrs. David Hardcastle's
  brother."</p>

  <p>"But I understood Brodribb to say that he was."</p>

  <p>"So did I," said Thorndyke. "But I must get a categorical statement with
  particulars as to the date of the extradition proceedings. If Brodribb can
  confirm his implied statement, then I shall have to test our suspicion that
  the woman who managed the abduction of Miss Stella was Marie Zichlinsky,
  alias Mrs. David Hardcastle."</p>

  <p>"You will have your work cut out," I remarked. "I don't see how you are
  going to prove either proposition."</p>

  <p>"There are no insuperable difficulties in identifying the woman," he
  replied, "though I have not yet made a definite plan. As to Zichlinsky, I
  shall ask Singleton to re-examine our finger-print."</p>

  <p>"But he has already said that he can't identify it."</p>

  <p>"That was not quite what I understood. I gathered that he recognised the
  print, but then rejected his identification on extrinsic evidence. He
  realised that a man who is in a Russian prison cannot make a finger print in
  London. But if I re-submit the print with the information that the man is
  believed to be in London and that there are circumstances which make it
  probable that the print was made by him, we may get an entirely different
  report; especially if I have previously communicated the facts to
  Miller."</p>

  <p>I laughed with malicious glee. "Really, Thorndyke," I chuckled, "I am
  surprised at you! Actually, you are going to set Miller on to ginger up
  Singleton and induce him to swear to a doubtful finger-print. And this after
  all your professions of scepticism regarding finger-print evidence!"</p>

  <p>"My dear Jervis," he replied with an indulgent smile, "let us be
  reasonable. If this finger-print conforms in pattern to the one at the Record
  Office, it is Zichlinsky's finger-print. There is no question of forgery. It
  is obviously a real finger-print. The only problem is its identity of
  pattern. And we are not proposing to ask for a conviction on it. We shall use
  it merely to enable us to secure the person of Zichlinsky and charge him with
  the crime. Nor need you be uneasy about Singleton. He won't swear to the
  print unless he is prepared to prove its identity in court, factor by factor,
  on an enlarged photograph."</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose he won't. But what plan of action is in your mind? Assuming
  that all our suspicions are confirmed, including the finger-print; what do
  you propose to do?"</p>

  <p>"I propose to make arrangements with Miller that the whereabouts of each
  of the parties shall be ascertained and an overwhelming force kept ready for
  action at a moment's notice. Then, at the appointed time, we shall swoop down
  on the whole crowd simultaneously&mdash;Mrs. David, Zichlinsky, Gomorrah,
  Shemrofsky, Ebbstein, and, if it seems practicable, James Trout."</p>

  <p>"But," I protested, "you could never charge all these people with the
  murder. The magistrate would insist on your making out a prima facie case;
  and you couldn't do it."</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "But that is where Jasper Gray's information is so
  invaluable. We don't need a prima facie case for the charge of murder against
  any of these persons, excepting Zichlinsky. And in his case, the
  finger-print, which we are assuming to be provable, will be enough. In all
  the other cases, we shall proceed on different charges, on which we can make
  out a prima facie case. Mrs. David, Gomorrah and Shemrofsky will be charged
  with the abduction. Ebbstein&mdash;against whom we have nothing but deep
  suspicion&mdash;will be roped in as an accessory of the felonous proceedings
  of his lodger, Mr. Jonas, the ingenious manufacturer of half-crowns. As to
  Trout, I am not sure whether we can get him on suspicion of having stolen the
  rope. I should like to. He would be extremely useful. I must see what Miller
  thinks about it."</p>

  <p>"But when you have got all these people by the heels? What then?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, then we shall allow the subject of the murder to leak out; and it
  will be remarkable if, among this gang of rascals, there is not, at least,
  one who will be prepared to volunteer a statement. Take the case of
  Shemrofsky; he was probably a principal in the second degree as to the
  murder. It is unlikely that he took part in the actual killing; and if he did
  not, he will probably be very willing to clear himself of the major charge by
  giving evidence as to who actually committed the murder. Again there is
  Trout. He probably selected the house at Stratford. He probably stole the
  rope, and the fisherman's bend and the running bowline look like his work. He
  is an associate of Gomorrah's, but it is very unlikely that he had a hand in
  the murder. If he could be charged, he would almost certainly make for safety
  by putting the onus on the shoulders of the actual murderers."</p>

  <p>"It seems a rather unsatisfactory method," I objected. "You are going to
  depend very largely on bluff."</p>

  <p>"It is unsatisfactory," Thorndyke admitted, "but what else can we do? We
  know that these people conspired together to commit the murder. One or more
  of them did actually commit the murder; the rest are principals in the second
  degree. The only proceeding open to us is to charge them all and let them
  sort themselves out."</p>

  <p>"But supposing they don't sort themselves out? What can you prove
  independently?"</p>

  <p>"Let us see," he answered, "what sort of case we could make out. I am
  assuming that Singleton can identify the finger-print and that Stella and
  Gray can identify Mrs. David, because without that evidence we should not
  proceed at all. We should require further investigation. But, assuming those
  identifications, we shall proceed somewhat thus:</p>

  <p>"First, we charge Mrs. David, Shemrofsky and Gomorrah with the abduction;
  and observe that we here bring into evidence the motive&mdash;the elimination
  of the principal beneficiary under Sir Edward's will, with reversion to the
  husband of Mrs. David. That charge we can prove conclusively.</p>

  <p>"We then charge the whole group with conspiracy to commit murder. Here,
  again, the motive comes into view. The murder of Sir Edward leaves&mdash;or
  is believed to leave&mdash;the succession to the property and title open to
  the husband of Mrs. David."</p>

  <p>"What about David, himself?"</p>

  <p>"At present he doesn't seem to come into the picture, though, naturally,
  he lies under suspicion of complicity. We have no direct evidence against
  him. But to continue. The abduction, with its apparent motive, connects
  itself with the murder, of which the motive is similar. Mrs. David stands to
  gain by the success of both crimes. But we have proved her to be guilty of
  one of the crimes. This is presumptive evidence of her guilt in respect of
  the other crime, since the two crimes appear to be parts of the same
  transaction. Then the evidence against Zichlinsky operates against her since
  he is her brother and has no motive excepting that of benefiting her.</p>

  <p>"Gomorrah is implicated by the facts that the rope used to hang the
  deceased is known to have been in his possession; that Zichlinsky was his
  lodger; that he is proved to have been concerned in the abduction and was
  therefore a confederate of Mrs. David.</p>

  <p>"Shemrofsky was concerned in the abduction and is thus implicated in the
  conspiracy. We can bring weighty evidence to prove that he was at Piper's Row
  on the night of Sunday, the twenty-first of June, and that he assisted to
  convey the body of the victim to that house.</p>

  <p>"Zichlinsky is proved, by his finger-print, to have been in the Stratford
  house and to have handled the chair. He is Mrs. David's brother and so stands
  to benefit, indirectly, by the deaths of Stella and Sir Edward. His
  statement, overheard by Jasper Gray, would be admitted as evidence of his
  being an interested party.</p>

  <p>"As to Trout, all that is actually against him is his connection with the
  rope. But, if the police could definitely connect him with the neighbourhood
  at Stratford, that would be a material point. The importance of getting him
  charged is that, although he was almost certainly an accessory, it is most
  improbable that he had any hand in the murder; and from what Gray has told us
  as to his efforts to restrain Zichlinsky and Gomorrah, we may suspect that he
  disapproved of their violent proceedings and would not be prepared to take
  any risk in shielding them. He is really an outsider of the gang."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "you have a better case than I thought, though it isn't up
  to your usual standard."</p>

  <p>"No," he admitted, "but it is the best that we can do. And probably we
  shall get some further detail. We have not yet ascertained how much Miss
  Stella will be able to enlarge our knowledge. But, in any event, we have a
  substantial case to start with. We can prove the fact of the murder and the
  conveyance of the body to the house at Stratford; and by means of the rope,
  we can definitely connect this group of persons with the crime. Moreover, we
  can prove that one, at least, of those persons had a very strong motive for
  committing the murder and was known to have committed another crime&mdash;the
  abduction&mdash;apparently with the same motive."</p>

  <p>"To say nothing," said I, "of the fact that the circumstances of the
  abduction strongly suggest an intention to commit another murder."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he agreed. "Zichlinsky's remark that he had been robbed of a
  fortune makes that fairly clear."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, after a pause, "that you now have a tolerably
  complete picture in your mind as to the actual course of events?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "Of course, it is largely inferential; but I think I
  can reconstruct the whole crime in outline with considerable confidence that
  my reconstruction is broadly correct. Perhaps it would be helpful to go over
  it and see exactly what we shall have to prove."</p>

  <p>"It would be extremely helpful to me," I said, "seeing that it is, in
  effect, the case for the prosecution."</p>

  <p>"Then," said he, "we will begin quite at the beginning and adopt the
  narrative style to save words. First some communication was made to Sir
  Edward, probably verbally and probably by some confidential envoy of Mrs.
  David's, begging him to grant an interview to some person who was unable to
  come to him. This person may have been her brother, who, being a fugitive
  from Russia, might naturally be in hiding and might be living in an otherwise
  unlikely neighbourhood. Sir Edward consented, with some misgivings, as we may
  judge from Weeks's description of his preoccupied state when he left home. It
  was arranged that Mrs. David should meet him with a hansom at an appointed
  place near his club and convey him to the place where the person was living.
  The approximate whereabouts of this person's place of abode was mentioned, as
  suggested by Sir Edward's precautions in leaving his valuables at the club;
  which also suggests that he was not without suspicions as to the nature of
  the transaction.</p>

  <p>"On his arrival at Pentecost Grove, in Shemrofsky's cab, he was introduced
  to Zichlinsky; and, probably almost at once, the attack was made on him. I am
  disposed to think that the original intention was to hang him, but that,
  suddenly during the struggle, it became necessary to silence him. A knock on
  the head was not practicable as it would have produced a recognisable injury,
  and made the pretence of suicide untenable. The alternative, adopted on the
  spur of the moment, was to thrust his head into the brine tub; and this
  having been done, he was held there until he was dead."</p>

  <p>"They must have been savage brutes!" I exclaimed. "But their savagery was
  their undoing. If they had hanged him, it would have been difficult to prove
  the murder, if not impossible."</p>

  <p>"Hardly impossible, Jervis," said he. "You will remember that we had
  virtually decided against suicide before we saw the body. And then there were
  the shoes and the wheel-tracks. Still, the drowning made the case much more
  conclusive."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said I. "You mentioned that you had a hypothetical
  explanation of the salt and the herring scales. Was it a brine tub that was
  in your mind?"</p>

  <p>"It occurred to me as a possibility, and the only one I could think of. I
  happened to know that it is the habit of low-class East European aliens to
  keep in their living or working rooms a tub of brine containing herrings and
  cut cabbage. The crime seemed to be associated with that part of London in
  which colonies of these people are settled, and it had a certain crude
  atrocity that was unlike English crime. Then the appearances agreed with this
  supposition and with no other. The man had been drowned, but only his head
  and neck had been wetted. He might have been held over the side of a boat or
  a landing-stage; but that theory would not account for the salt and the
  herring scales. But a receptacle containing salt water and herrings met the
  conditions exactly. And that little shred of cabbage gave strong
  confirmation. Still, it was only a hypothesis; and even now it is but an
  inference. It remains to be proved."</p>

  <p>"I don't think there is much doubt of it," said I, "though it had never
  occurred to me. Of course, when Jasper Gray mentioned the tub of herrings and
  cabbage floating in brine, the explanation came in a flash. But go on with
  your reconstruction."</p>

  <p>"There isn't much more to say. The body was kept at Gomorrah's
  house&mdash;or Ebbstein's, whichever it was. Ebbstein's house fits the
  conditions perfectly but Gomorrah's is probably exactly similar&mdash;until
  Sunday night, perhaps because then there would be fewer people about down by
  the creeks. Then one man&mdash;probably Trout&mdash;was sent on ahead to get
  the house open and see that all was clear. The body was put into Shemrofsky's
  cab&mdash;probably it was placed upright, sitting on the seat&mdash;and
  accompanied by one of the murderers, who was almost certainly Zichlinsky.
  Then, as it had been a wet evening, the glass front could be let down without
  appearing remarkable, and the two occupants, the living and the dead, would
  thus be practically invisible from the outside.</p>

  <p>"On the arrival of the cab at the house, the advance man&mdash;call him
  Trout&mdash;would give the signal 'all clear' and the body and the rope would
  then be quickly carried in by him and Zichlinsky. Probably Trout made the
  rope fast to the beam and prepared the noose while Zichlinsky held up the
  body. As soon as it was suspended, they would turn the chair over and make
  the other arrangements. Then they would go into the front room, open the
  window and drop the glove under it. Finally, they would look out to see that
  there was no one about and then come away and make for the rendezvous where
  Shemrofsky would be waiting for them with his cab. Or he may have driven
  straight home, leaving them to follow on foot or in an omnibus.</p>

  <p>"That is how I think the plan was carried out, and that is the account
  that I shall give to Miller as the basis of enquiries and of such questions
  as he may think fit to put to the prisoners."</p>

  <p>"And what do you propose to do at the moment?"</p>

  <p>"My first proceeding," he replied, "will be to see Miller and try to get
  the finger-print question settled. Then I shall consult with Brodribb as to
  the best way of ascertaining whether the woman who captured Miss Stella was
  or was not Mrs. David Hardcastle. I have a plan in my mind, but as it
  involves Brodribb's co-operation, I can't decide on it until I have secured
  his agreement."</p>

  <p>"My impression is," said I, "that Brodribb will agree gladly to anything
  that you may suggest."</p>

  <p>"That is my impression, too," said Thorndyke. And subsequent events proved
  that we were both right.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-16"
     id="ch-16"></a>XVI. &mdash; MRS. DAVID HARDCASTLE</h2>

  <h3>(Jasper Gray's Narralive)</h3>

  <p class="first">MY premonitions of some impending change in the conditions
  of my life, dimly associated with Mr. Brodribb, were revived some days later
  when I saw that gentleman coming out of our office in earnest conversation
  with Mr. Wopsall. The apparition caused me some surprise, and when Mr.
  Wopsall beckoned to me, I came forward with alacrity, bubbling over with
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"You are going off duty for a day or two, Gray," said Mr. Wopsall. "Mr.
  Brodribb wants you to attend at his office to-morrow and perhaps afterwards.
  He will give you your instructions, and you will understand that they have my
  full concurrence; and I need hardly suggest that you smarten yourself up a
  bit and try to do us credit."</p>

  <p>With this he shook hands with Mr. Brodribb and retired to his office,
  leaving us together; and we drifted out into the street to pursue our
  business. However, he had not much to say. In effect, he wished me to present
  myself at his abode in New Square, Lincoln's Inn, punctually at ten o'clock
  on the following morning, when he would give me more detailed instructions;
  and having delivered himself of this request and satisfied himself of my
  ability to find my way to his office, he shook my hand warmly and went his
  way with an air of deep satisfaction.</p>

  <p>As he had given me no hint as to the nature of the business on hand, it
  was natural that I should spend the remainder of the day in speculating with
  the most intense curiosity on the circumstances that called for my presence
  in a place so remote from the scene of my customary activities; and it was
  equally natural that I should make my appearance in the place of assignation
  with more than common punctuality. Indeed, the word 'punctuality' understates
  the case; for, although I had spent a full hour operating on my clothes with
  a sponge, a nail-brush and a flat iron, I strolled into the Square from
  Chancery Lane at the moment when the hands of the big clock showed a quarter
  past nine. (I say 'the hands' advisedly, for the joker who put up that clock
  had omitted the figures on the dial, substituting for them a dozen exactly
  similar marks.)</p>

  <p>I stood for some time inspecting that eccentric clock-face with mildly
  surprised interest. Then I transferred my attention to a fine pear-tree that
  some rural-minded lawyer had trained up the side of his house; and I was
  still contemplating this phenomenon when I became aware of a somewhat chubby
  gentleman in a broad-brimmed straw hat and slippers who was sauntering up the
  pavement smoking a very large pipe. At the moment, his head was inclined
  forward so that the hat-brim concealed his face; but as we approached, he
  raised his head, and, the hat ascending with it, disclosed the countenance of
  Mr. Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed as he caught sight of me, "You are a little before your
  time, which is a good fault, if that is not a contradiction of terms. The
  early bird catches the worm, as the rather ambiguous proverb has
  it&mdash;ambiguous, I mean, as to the moral to be conveyed. For while the
  early rising is obviously advantageous to the bird, it is obviously
  disadvantageous to the worm. He had better have stayed in bed a little
  longer. However, here you are, and it will be all to the good if we get our
  arrangements completed in advance."</p>

  <p>He pulled out a prosperous-looking gold watch (apparently, he didn't trust
  the clock) and having looked at it thoughtfully, continued: "I shall want you
  to sit at a desk in my outer office, and you are to try to look as if you'd
  been there all your life. You are supposed to be one of my clerks. Do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>I assured him (but not in those words) that I 'rumbled him', as our packer
  would say, and he went on: "I am expecting some visitors presently. They will
  come to the outer office and you will take down their names on a slip of
  paper and then come into my office and announce them. And while you are
  taking down their names, I should like you to have a good look at them so
  that you will be able to recognise them if you should see them again."</p>

  <p>This sounded agreeably mysterious, and once more, I assured him&mdash;in
  suitable terms&mdash;that I 'ogled' perfectly.</p>

  <p>"If anyone asks you any questions," he continued, "be as evasive as you
  can. Don't give any information."</p>

  <p>I remarked that I hadn't much to give, to which he replied that perhaps I
  had more than I realised. "But in any case," said he, "keep your own counsel.
  If they should ask you who you are, say you are my clerk."</p>

  <p>"That won't be quite correct, sir," I ventured to remind him.</p>

  <p>"Bless the boy!" he chuckled, "we aren't as particular as that in the law.
  But, in fact, you are my clerk. I appoint you to the post this very instant.
  Will that satisfy your scruples?"</p>

  <p>I agreed that it would, though the appointment was obviously a legal
  fiction, and, the preliminaries being thus arranged, I was presently inducted
  into the outer office, of which I seemed to be the sole occupant, and
  installed at a handsome mahogany desk, furnished with blotting-pad, an
  inkstand with three ink bottles&mdash;black, green and red&mdash;a pile of
  paper slips and a number of quill pens.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock precisely, Mr. Brodribb entered his private office and shut
  the door; and there descended on the premises a profound silence, through
  which I could hear faintly the sound of movement in the inner office with an
  occasional squeak of a quill pen; by which I judged that the communicating
  door was by no means sound-proof. But I discovered later that there was a
  second, baize-covered door which could be shut when required to ensure
  privacy.</p>

  <p>The minutes ran on. Soon the novelty of the situation exhausted itself. I
  began to be bored by the continued occupancy of the leather-seated stool and
  to be sensible of a faint yearning for a parcel to deliver. Sitting still was
  well enough when one was tired, but it was no sort of occupation for an
  active youth at ten o'clock in the morning. However, it had to be; so failing
  any opportunity for physical exercise, I directed my attention to the quill
  pens and the three bottles of ink. I had never used a quill pen and had no
  consider able experience of coloured inks. Now I proceeded to make a few
  experiments and was greatly pleased with the results. Beginning with a
  spirited portrait of Mr. Gomorrah, I discovered the surprising potentialities
  of a polychromatic medium. The green ink enabled me to do full justice to his
  complexion, while the red ink imparted a convincing surgical quality to his
  bandaged head.</p>

  <p>I was adding the finishing touches to this masterpiece of portraiture when
  I became aware of sounds penetrating the door&mdash;not Mr. Brodribb's door,
  but another which apparently gave access to an adjoining room. The sounds
  conveyed the impression of several persons moving about on an oil-clothed
  floor and were accompanied by the dragging of chairs. But after a short time
  these sounds died away, and I had just returned to my polychrome portrait
  when the crescendo music of a pair of creaky boots informed me that someone
  was approaching the outer door. A moment later, that door was flung open and
  a largish gentleman with a puffy face, not unadorned with pimples, stamped
  into the room, and having bestowed on me a disparaging stare, demanded: "Is
  Mr. Brodribb disengaged?"</p>

  <p>I sprang up from my stool and spluttered at him ambiguously. Meanwhile he
  stood, holding the door open and looking out into the lobby.</p>

  <p>"Come along!" he exclaimed impatiently addressing some person outside;
  whereupon the person addressed came along, and in a moment completed my
  confusion.</p>

  <p>I recognised her instantly, which was the more remarkable since she was
  strikingly changed since I had last seen her; changed as to her habiliments
  and even in her person, for then her hair had been jet black whereas now it
  was of a glaring red. But I knew her all the same. Hers was a face that no
  make-up could disguise. And if her hair had changed, her eyes had not; and
  now I saw why they had appeared different in colour. The pupil of the left
  eye, instead of being a round black spot, was drawn out to the shape of a key
  hole. Nor did her handsome clothing make any essential change in her
  appearance. From the moment when my glance fell on her as she entered the
  room, I never had the shadow of a doubt that she was the ill-omened nurse at
  whom I had peered through the gutter-hole in Pentecost Grove.</p>

  <p>I suppose I must have gone even beyond Mr. Brodribb's instructions to
  'have a good look at' the visitors, for the odd silence was broken by her
  voice demanding angrily and with a faint foreign accent: "Well! what are you
  staring at me like that for?"</p>

  <p>I mumbled a semi-articulate apology which she ignored, continuing: "Go at
  once to Mr. Brodribb and tell him that Mr. and Mrs. Hardcastle wish to see
  him."</p>

  <p>I pulled myself together rapidly, but incompletely, and, dimly recalling
  Mr. Brodribb's directions concerning the slips of paper, I grabbed up the
  portrait of Gomorrah, and, blundering into his private office without
  knocking, slapped it down on his writing-table. He regarded it for a moment
  with a stupefied stare and then exclaimed: "What the dev&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But at this point his eye caught the two visitors, who, waiving ceremony,
  now appeared in the doorway. He rose to receive them, and I hastily made my
  escape, leaving the door open; an omission the enormity of which I realised
  when I saw&mdash;and heard&mdash;Mr. Hardcastle ostentatiously slam it.</p>

  <p>I crept back to my stool and drew a deep breath, conscious that I had made
  rather a hash of the business, so far. Well, every man to his trade. One
  couldn't expect the practice of parcels delivery to produce expertness in the
  duties of a lawyer's clerk. Still, I must manage the next visitors better;
  and having formed this resolution, I fell, naturally enough, into deep
  reflection on the astonishing thing that had just happened.</p>

  <p>So this woman's name was Hardcastle. But Miss Stella's name was Hardcastle
  too. Very odd, this. They must be relatives, but yet they had seemed to be
  strangers, for Miss Stella had referred to her simply as "a woman." But at
  this point my train of thought was interrupted by Mr. Hardcastle's voice,
  penetrating the door. He was speaking in a loud, excited tone&mdash;not to
  say shouting&mdash;and I could hear quite distinctly what he was saying.</p>

  <p>"But, damn it, Brodribb, the man is dead! Been dead a matter of fifteen
  years or more. You know that as well as I do."</p>

  <p>There followed a sudden silence, and then I heard the thud of a closing
  door which I judged to be the baize inner door of Mr. Brodribb's office; a
  conclusion that was confirmed by the fact that, thereafter, Mr. Hardcastle's
  rather raucous voice percolated through only in a state of extreme
  attenuation. Even this I tried to ignore, and I had just resumed my
  speculations on the possible relationship of Mrs. Hardcastle and Miss Stella
  when I was rendered positively speechless by a new, and even more
  astonishing, arrival. For, without any warning of premonitory foot-falls, the
  outer door opened softly and gave entrance to none other than Miss Stella
  herself.</p>

  <p>She was not alone. Closely following her was a very pleasant-looking lady
  whom I judged, from a recognisable resemblance, to be her mother, and who
  asked me if Mr. Brodribb was at liberty. Before I could collect my wits to
  reply, Miss Stella uttered a little cry of surprise and ran to me holding out
  her hand.</p>

  <p>"You haven't forgotten me, have you?" she asked, as I took her hand rather
  shyly.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed, miss," I answered emphatically. "I shouldn't be likely to
  forget you."</p>

  <p>"This is fortunate!" she exclaimed. "I was afraid that I should never see
  you again and never be able to thank you."</p>

  <p>Here she turned to the other lady, who was gazing at us in evident
  astonishment, and explained: "This is the gentleman who rescued me and
  brought me home that night. Let me introduce my knight-errant to my
  mother."</p>

  <p>On this, the elder lady darted forward and seized both my hands. I thought
  she was going to kiss me, and shouldn't have minded if she had. What she was
  about to say I shall never know, though it is not difficult to guess; for at
  this moment the door of Mr. Brodribb's office flew open and Mr. Hardcastle's
  voice, raised to an infuriated shout, was heard proclaiming: "It's a damned
  conspiracy! You are setting up this impostor for your own ends. But you had
  better have a care, my friend. You may find it a dangerous game."</p>

  <p>He stamped out, purple and gibbering with wrath, and close behind him came
  his wife. Her ghastly white face was indescribable in its concentrated malice
  and fury; but as soon as I caught sight of it, I knew why Zichlinsky's face
  had stirred my memory. She might have been his sister. But this recognition
  came only in a half-conscious flash, for the sight of her strung me up to
  readiness for the inevitable clash. And the next moment it came. Mr.
  Hardcastle had pushed roughly past the two ladies and his wife was following,
  when, just as they came abreast, Miss Stella turned her head and looked at
  the woman. As their eyes met, she uttered a cry of terror and shrank back,
  seizing my arm and making as if she would have taken shelter behind me.</p>

  <p>For a moment there was a strange effect of arrested movement in the room,
  all the figures standing motionless as in a tableau. Mr. Hardcastle had
  turned and was staring in angry astonishment; his wife stood glaring at the
  terrified girl, and Mr. Brodribb looked on with frowning curiosity from the
  doorway of his office. It was he who broke the silence. "What is it, Miss
  Stella?"</p>

  <p>"The woman," she gasped, pointing at Mrs. Hardcastle. "The nurse who took
  me to that dreadful house."</p>

  <p>"What the devil does she mean?" demanded Mr. Hardcastle, looking in
  bewilderment from Miss Stella to his wife.</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" the latter snarled. "The girl is an idiot. Let us get
  away from this den of swindlers and lunatics."</p>

  <p>She moved towards the door with an assumed air of unconcern, though I
  could see that she was mightily shaken by the encounter. Mr. Hardcastle
  preceded her and wrenched the door open. Then he stood for a moment with the
  open door in his hand looking out.</p>

  <p>"Don't block up the door like that, man," he said, irritably. "Come in or
  get out of the way."</p>

  <p>The unseen person elected to come in, and having come in, he promptly shut
  the door and turned the key. Mr. Hardcastle looked at him fiercely and
  demanded: "What the devil is the meaning of this, sir?</p>

  <p>"I take it," replied the newcomer, "that you are Mr. David
  Hardcastle?"</p>

  <p>"And supposing I am. What then?"</p>

  <p>"And this lady is Mrs. David Hardcastle, formerly Marie Zichlinsky?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hardcastle glared at him with an expression that reminded me of a
  frightened cat. But she made no reply. The answer came from Mr. Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Superintendent, she is Mrs. David Hardcastle; and she has been
  identified by Miss Stella Hardcastle, who is here."</p>

  <p>The woman turned on him furiously. "So," she exclaimed, "this is a trap
  that you had set for us, you sly old devil! Well, Superintendent, what do you
  want with Mrs. David Hardcastle?"</p>

  <p>The Superintendent looked at Miss Stella and asked:</p>

  <p>"What do you say, Miss Hardcastle? Do you recognise this lady, and if so,
  what do you know about her?"</p>

  <p>"She is the woman who was dressed as a nurse and who enticed me by false
  pretences to a house where I was imprisoned and bound with rope and from
  which this gentleman rescued me."</p>

  <p>If a look could have killed, 'this gentleman' would have been a dead
  gentleman. As it was, he was only a deeply interested gentleman.</p>

  <p>"This," exclaimed Mrs. David, "is a parcel of foolery. The girl is
  mistaking me for some other person if she isn't merely lying."</p>

  <p>"We can't go into that here," said the Superintendent. "We are not trying
  the case. I am a police officer and I arrest you for having abducted and
  forcibly detained Miss Stella Hardcastle, and I caution you that anything
  that you say will be taken down and may be used in evidence against you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hardcastle was obviously terrified but she maintained a certain air
  of defiance, demanding angrily: "What right have you got to arrest me? Where
  is your warrant?"</p>

  <p>"No warrant is necessary in a case of abduction," the Superintendent
  explained civilly.</p>

  <p>"But you have only a bare statement. You cannot arrest without an
  information given on oath."</p>

  <p>The lady struck me as being remarkably well informed in the matter of
  police procedure. But the Superintendent knew a thing or two for he replied,
  still in the same patient and courteous manner: "Miss Hardcastle has already
  laid a sworn information as to the facts. I assure you that the arrest is
  perfectly regular and the less difficulties you make, the less unpleasant it
  will be for us all."</p>

  <p>During these proceedings Mr. Hardcastle had looked on with an air of
  stupefaction. All the bluster had gone out of his manner and his puffy face
  had suddenly turned white and haggard. He now broke in with the bewildered
  enquiry: "What is this all about? I don't understand. What are they talking
  about, Marie?"</p>

  <p>She gave him a single wild, despairing look, and then she made a sudden
  dash for the door of communication. In a moment she had wrenched it open,
  only to reveal the presence of two massive plain-clothes officers standing
  just inside. For one moment she stood gazing at them in dismay; then she
  turned back and faced the Superintendent. "Very well," she said, sullenly. "I
  will come with you if I must."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you must," said he; "and, if you take my advice, you will not
  make a disagreeable business worse by any sort of resistance."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the two officers and asked: "Have you got a cab waiting?"
  and on receiving an affirmative reply, he said, addressing the older of them;
  "Then you will take charge of this lady, and of course, you will avoid any
  appearance of having her in custody, provided she accompanies you quietly.
  You know where to go."</p>

  <p>As the two officers entered the room and shut the door Mr. Hardcastle
  turned to the Superintendent. "Is it possible for me to accompany my wife?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>The Superintendent shook his head. "I am afraid that is quite impossible,"
  said he; "but you can attend at the police court and apply for her to be
  admitted to bail. I will give you the necessary directions presently."</p>

  <p>Here the senior of the two officers indicated to Mrs. Hardcastle that he
  was ready to start; whereupon her husband stepped towards her, and, laying
  his hands on her shoulders, kissed her livid cheek. She pushed him away
  gently without looking at him, and, with a set face and a firm step, followed
  the first officer out of the room and was in turn followed by the other.</p>

  <p>As soon as they were gone Mr. Hardcastle looked at my employer, gloomily,
  but with none of his former bluster. "Is this your doing, Brodribb?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb, who looked considerably upset by what had just happened,
  replied gently: "There was no choice, Mr. Hardcastle. If there had been, you
  would have been spared the distress of witnessing this catastrophe."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Superintendent, who had taken possession of my desk and
  was writing on one of the paper slips, "we are all very sorry that this
  trouble has fallen on you. But the trouble was not of our making. Now, here
  are the particulars that you will want and the directions as to what you had
  better do. But I must warn you that the magistrate may refuse bail. Still,
  that is his affair and yours. The police can't accept bail in a case of this
  kind."</p>

  <p>He handed the paper to Mr. Hardcastle, who glanced through it, put it in
  his pocket, and, without another word, walked dejectedly to the door and
  passed out of our sight. And with his disappearance there seemed to come a
  general relaxation of tension. Mr. Brodribb especially appeared to feel the
  relief, for, as the door closed, he drew a deep breath and murmured: "Thank
  God that's over!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miss Stella's mother, "it was a dreadful experience, though it
  is difficult to feel any sort of sympathy except for her unfortunate husband.
  May I take it, Mr. Brodribb, that this was the business that required my
  presence here and Stella's?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply. "There were some other matters, but they will have
  to wait. But I shall hope to do myself the honour of calling on you in the
  course of the next day or two."</p>

  <p>"Then our business here is finished for to-day?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb glanced at the Superintendent, who replied: "I shall want
  Miss Hardcastle to identify one or two of the persons who will be charged
  with the abduction, but it is not urgent, as we have Mr. Gray here and enough
  evidence of other kinds to cover the arrests. So we need not detain these two
  ladies any longer."</p>

  <p>The two ladies accordingly made their adieux to Mr. Brodribb and then bade
  me a very cordial farewell. As she shook my hand, the elder lady said with a
  smile: "We have found you at last, Mr. Gray, and we are not going to lose
  sight of you again. We shall hold Mr. Brodribb responsible for you."</p>

  <p>With this and a gracious bow to the Superintendent, she passed out of the
  door which I held open for her, her arm linked in Miss Stella's, and both
  acknowledged my bow with a valedictory smile.</p>

  <p>"Now," said the Superintendent, glancing at his watch, "it is time for us
  to be moving, Mr. Brodribb. I told Dr. Thorndyke that we should be there by
  half-past eleven and it's nearly that now."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb went into his office where, besides securing his hat and
  stick, he apparently rang a bell, for a dry-looking gentleman&mdash;a genuine
  clerk&mdash;made his appearance from a communicating door and looked at his
  employer enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"I am going now, Bateman," said Mr. Brodribb. "Did you order the cab?"</p>

  <p>"The cab is now at the door, sir," replied Mr. Bateman; on which the
  Superintendent went out and Mr. Brodribb followed, pushing me in front of
  him. I was naturally somewhat curious as to our destination, but, as I had
  only to wait until our arrival to satisfy my curiosity, I wasted no effort on
  speculation, but gave my attention to my fellow passengers' conversation;
  from which, however, I did not gather very much.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why you want me to come," Mr. Brodribb remarked. "I don't
  know anything but what Dr. Thorndyke has told me."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent chuckled. "You are in much the same position as the
  rest of us," said he. "But you may as well see how far we can confirm his
  information. We've got most of these birds in the hand now, and it remains to
  be seen how much we shall get out of them."</p>

  <p>"But you can't interrogate prisoners concerning the crimes that they are
  charged with."</p>

  <p>"No, certainly not. But we can let them talk after they have been
  cautioned, and we can let them make statements if they want to."</p>

  <p>"Do you think they will want to?" asked Mr. Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"I shall be very surprised if some of them don't. You see, out of this
  batch, one or two, or perhaps three, are the actual principals. The rest are
  accessories. But an accessory, when he sees the rope dangling before his
  nose, is going to take uncommon care that he isn't mistaken for a principal
  in the first degree. He'll probably lie like Ananias, but it is tolerably
  easy to sort out the lies and separate the facts."</p>

  <p>At this point the cab, which had been rumbling down Whitehall, turned in
  at a large gateway and drew up at the entrance to a building which I decided
  to be the police headquarters, judging by the constabulary appearance of all
  the visible occupants. Here we disembarked and made our way to a barely
  furnished room containing a large table, furnished with writing materials,
  and a few chairs. Seated at the table with their backs to the windows were
  Dr. Thorndyke, Dr. Jervis, and a gentleman whom I did not know. Exactly
  opposite the table was a door, at each side of which a police officer in
  uniform stood stiffly on guard, which led me to surmise that 'the birds in
  hand' were not very far away.</p>

  <p>"Now," said the Superintendent when the brief greetings had been
  exchanged, "the first thing will be for Mr. Gray to identify the various
  parties. It is a mere formality, but it is necessary to connect his
  statements with actual persons. You will just look at the prisoners, Mr.
  Gray, and if you recognise any of them, you will tell us who they are and
  what you know about them."</p>

  <p>With this, he led me to the door, which was then thrown open by one of the
  guardians.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-17"
     id="ch-17"></a>XVII. &mdash; SOME STATEMENTS AND A TRAGEDY</h2>

  <h3>(JASPER GRAY'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">AS I stood for a moment in the open doorway and looked
  through into the large room beyond, I was sensible of an uncomfortable
  thrill. The grim spectacle on which I looked was an impressive illustration
  of the omnipotence of the law and its inexorable purpose when once set in
  motion. The room was as bare as the other, containing only a central table
  and a number of chairs ranged along the walls, on six of which, spaced at
  wide intervals, the prisoners were seated, each guarded by two constables. A
  single comprehensive glance took them all in; and then my eyes wandered back
  to Mrs. Hardcastle, and I hoped that Mr. Brodribb had not seen her.</p>

  <p>She sat, rigid and ghastly, a very image of despair. The misery and deadly
  fear that her haggard face expressed wrung my heart in spite of my knowledge
  of her wickedness, though, to be sure, the whole extent of her wickedness was
  not then known to me. But even if it had been, her dreadful condition would
  still have shocked me.</p>

  <p>"I recognise this lady," I said huskily in answer to the Superintendent's
  question. "I saw her in Pentecost Grove the day I escaped with Miss Stella
  Hardcastle. She was then dressed as a nurse."</p>

  <p>"It is a lie!" she exclaimed, casting a tigerish glance at me. "This young
  fool has mistaken me for some stranger."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent made no comment and we passed on to the next chair.</p>

  <p>"This is James Trout," said I. "All I know about him is that he gave me a
  bad half-crown and that he tried to prevent the other man from stabbing
  me."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen this man before?" the Superintendent asked when we
  came to the next prisoner. The man looked at me wolfishly, and as I answered
  in the affirmative, he uttered a sort of snarl. And again I was struck by his
  resemblance to Mrs. Hardcastle.</p>

  <p>"He gave the name of Jacob Silberstein to the policeman," said I, "but I
  heard some of the people address him as Mr. Zichlinsky."</p>

  <p>The three remaining prisoners were Ebbstein, Gomorrah, and the cab-driver,
  Louis, and when I had identified them we went back to the other room and once
  more the door was shut. The Superintendent took his seat at the table between
  Dr. Thorndyke and Mr. Brodribb, the strange gentleman laid a large note-book
  on the table before him and uncapped a fountain-pen, and I was given a chair
  next to Mr. Brodribb and provided with a blotting-pad, paper and pens and
  ink.</p>

  <p>"You will listen to any statements that are made, Mr. Gray," said the
  Superintendent, "and if any of them appear to you to be incorrect you will
  make no remark but write down the correction for our information later. And I
  need not say that you are to regard anything that you may hear as strictly
  secret and confidential."</p>

  <p>I signified that I clearly understood this, and the Superintendent then
  addressed Dr. Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I think we had better begin with Trout. He is the most likely
  subject."</p>

  <p>As Dr. Thorndyke agreed, the Superintendent gave the name to one of the
  constables on guard, who then opened the door, and, entering the large room,
  presently returned accompanied by Trout, who was given a chair opposite the
  middle of the table and facing the Superintendent. The latter looked at him
  doubtfully for a moment or two as if considering how he should begin; but
  Trout solved the problem by opening the proceedings himself.</p>

  <p>"You are makin' a rare to-do about that bit of rope, sir," he complained.
  "I don't see why I've been brought here along o' them foreign crooks. Suppose
  I did pinch that rope&mdash;which I didn't. But suppose I did. It's nothin'
  to make all this fuss about."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, Trout," said the Superintendent. "The mere stealing
  of the rope is no great matter. We could let the dock company deal with that.
  It is a much more serious matter that we are concerned with; and the way the
  rope question comes into it is this: a piece cut off that rope&mdash;how long
  did you say that piece was, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Thirteen feet," Dr. Thorndyke replied.</p>

  <p>"A piece thirteen feet long was cut off that rope, and this piece was
  taken to a house at Stratford&mdash;Number Five, Piper's Row."</p>

  <p>He paused and looked steadily at Trout, who in his turn gazed at the
  Superintendent with an expression of astonishment and unmistakable alarm.</p>

  <p>"The persons who took that piece of rope to that place," the
  Superintendent continued, "also conveyed there the body of a man who had been
  murdered and they used the rope to hang that body from a beam."</p>

  <p>"But," protested Trout, "that man hadn't been murdered. The inquest found
  that he hung himself."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but we have since ascertained that he was murdered&mdash;drowned in
  a very unusual way. Now wait a moment, Trout. Before you say anything I must
  caution you that whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be
  used in evidence against you at your trial."</p>

  <p>"My trial!" gasped Trout, now evidently terrified. "What do you mean, sir?
  Why are you cautioning me like this?"</p>

  <p>"Because I now charge you with the murder of this man, Sir Edward
  Hardcastle, whose body was found in that house."</p>

  <p>"Me!" shrieked Trout, turning as pale as a bladder of lard. "You charge
  me! Why I don't know nothin' about it!"</p>

  <p>"You are charged," the Superintendent continued in calm, even tones,
  "together with Maurice Zichlinsky, Solomon Gomorrah, Louis Shemrofsky and
  Marie Hardcastle, with a conspiracy to murder the person I have named. Now,
  remember my caution. You are not bound to say anything and you had better
  think carefully before you do say anything. If you wish to make a statement
  you can do so, and it will be taken down in writing and you will be required
  to sign it. But there is no need for you to say anything at all."</p>

  <p>Trout reflected with an alarmed eye on the officer. Evidently he was
  thunderstruck by the turn of events and mightily puzzled how to act. At
  length, he said cautiously: "Supposing I was prepared to make a
  statement&mdash;though I don't know nothin' about the affair, mind
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you don't know anything, your statement wouldn't help us much," the
  Superintendent remarked dryly.</p>

  <p>"Well, if I was able to tell you anything at all, would you drop this
  charge against me?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the prompt reply. "I can make no promise or bargain with you.
  But if you are innocent, it will clearly be to your advantage that the true
  facts should be known. But don't decide hastily. You had better go into the
  other room and think it over; and while you are considering whether you would
  like to make a statement, we will have Shemrofsky in."</p>

  <p>"Don't you take no notice of what Shemrofsky says," Trout implored with
  obvious apprehension. "He's the biggest liar as ever drove a cab."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," said the Superintendent. "But we shall have to listen to
  him if he wants to say anything. And if he chooses to tell lies, that is his
  look-out."</p>

  <p>Here the Superintendent nodded to Trout's custodian and uttered the single
  word, "Shemrofsky," whereupon the officer conducted his charge back to the
  other room and shut the door. There followed a short interval, during which
  we all sat looking at the closed door, awaiting the emergence of the other
  prisoner. Suddenly, a murmur of voices and a confused sound of movement was
  audible from within. Then the door flew open and a constable rushed out.</p>

  <p>"The woman prisoner, sir!" he exclaimed in a dismayed tone. "There's
  something the matter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Before he could finish, the Superintendent and the two doctors had sprung
  to their feet and darted in through the open doorway. From where I sat I got
  a glimpse of a row of prisoners and constables craning forward with horrified
  faces, and opposite to them Mrs. Hardcastle supported by two officers. When I
  first saw her, she was sitting bent forward with her head nearly on her
  knees; but then the officers raised her until she leaned back in her chair,
  when her arms fell down at her side, her head fell back and her chin dropped,
  leaving her mouth wide open. That was the last that I saw of her, for at that
  moment the door closed; and when, after a considerable interval, it opened
  again, her chair was empty.</p>

  <p>As the Superintendent and the two doctors returned to their places Mr.
  Brodribb looked at them enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Too late," said the Superintendent. "She was dead when the doctor got to
  her."</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear!" Mr. Brodribb murmured in a shocked tone. "Poor creature! I
  suppose her deathwas not&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Natural?" said Dr. Thorndyke. "No. It was apparently cyanide poisoning.
  She must have kept a little supply concealed on her person in case of an
  emergency. Probably one or two tablets."</p>

  <p>"Yes," growled the Superintendent, "and we might have expected it. Ought
  to have had her searched. However, it's too late to think of that now."</p>

  <p>But in spite of these expressed regrets, I had the feeling that he was
  less disturbed by the tragedy than I should have expected. And so with the
  others. Even the sensitive, soft-hearted Mr. Brodribb took the catastrophe
  with singularly calm resignation. Indeed, it was he who gave voice to what
  was probably the general view.</p>

  <p>"A shocking affair. Shocking. And yet, perhaps, in view of what might have
  been&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He did not finish the sentence, but I gathered that he was rather more
  relieved than shocked by what had happened. And, later, I understood why.</p>

  <p>After a decent pause, the business was resumed. Once more the door opened
  and now the cabman, Louis, was led out by an officer and brought up to the
  table; and a glance at him told me that, on him, at least, the recent tragedy
  had fallen with shattering effect. His face was blanched to a tallowy white
  and damp with sweat, his eyes stared and his thin, bandy legs trembled
  visibly.</p>

  <p>The Superintendent regarded him with a critical eye, and addressed him in
  passionless but not unfriendly tones.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Shemrofsky. The officer who arrested you has cautioned you that
  anything that you say may be used in evidence against you. Now, bear that
  caution in mind."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Shemrofsky, "I shall remember. But zere is noding against
  me. I drive a cab. Zere is no harm to drive a cab."</p>

  <p>Mr. Miller nodded but made no comment, and Shemrofsky continued: "Zey say
  I take avay ze young lady, but zat is not true. Ze young lady get into ze cab
  by herself. Madame tell me vere to drive and I drive zere. Ze young lady get
  out of ze cab and go into ze house. I do not make her go. Madame could tell
  you I know noding of vot she do. But now Madame is dead and zere is nobody to
  speak for me."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the Superintendent. "We will let that pass. But there is
  another charge; and I caution you again that anything you say may be used in
  evidence against you. Don't forget that."</p>

  <p>Shemrofsky turned, if possible, paler and stared apprehensively at the
  officer. "Anozer charge!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It refers to a gentleman who was brought from Piccadilly, near Dover
  Street, to Number Fifty Pentecost Grove. In that house he was murdered, and
  his body was taken to Number Five Piper's Row, Stratford. The murder was
  committed by Maurice Zichlinsky, Solomon Gomorrah and certain other persons;
  and I charge you with being one of those other persons. Now, remember my
  caution."</p>

  <p>For a few moments Shemrofsky gazed at the Superintendent in speechless
  consternation. Then he broke out, passionately: "You charge me zat I help to
  kill zat chentleman! I tell you I haf noding to do vid zat. I did not know
  zat anybody kill him. Somebody tell you lies about me. If Madame vas here,
  she vould tell you zat I chust drive ze cab vere I am told. Zat is all. I
  know noding of vot zey do."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent wrote down these statements, though the gentleman at
  the end of the table was apparently the official scribe. But he made no
  remark, and presently Shemrofsky continued: "Somebody have tried to put ze
  blame on me. But I shall tell you all zat I know. Zen you vill see zat I haf
  noding to do vid killing zis chentleman."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," said the Superintendent, with ill-concealed satisfaction,
  "that you wish to make a statement? You are not bound to say anything, you
  know. But if you wish to make a statement, you may; and it will be taken down
  in writing, and, when you have read it and find it correct, you will be
  required to sign it. But do exactly as you think best."</p>

  <p>"I shall tell you all vot I know," said Shemrofsky, whereupon the
  Superintendent glanced at the recording officer&mdash;who took a fresh sheet
  of paper&mdash;and advised the prisoner to stick to the truth and begin at
  the beginning.</p>

  <p>"You had better start," said he, "by telling us what you know as to how
  this gentleman came to Pentecost Grove."</p>

  <p>"He came in my cab." said Shemrofsky. "I vill tell you how it vos. Vun
  morning&mdash;it vas a Vednesday&mdash;Madame say to me zat a friend is
  coming to see Mr. Zichlinsky&mdash;zat vas her broder&mdash;and as he vould
  not know ze vay she vould fetch him in my cab. So she get in ze cab and tell
  me to drive to Dover Street, Piccadilly. Ven ve get zere, I valk ze horse
  slowly. Zen ze chentleman come. Madame push up ze trap vid her umbrella and I
  stop. Ze chentleman get into ze cab and I drive to Pentecost Grove as I haf
  been told. Madame and ze chentleman get out and go into Mr. Ebbstein's
  house."</p>

  <p>"Ebbstein's!" exclaimed the Superintendent. "I understood it was
  Gomorrah's."</p>

  <p>"No, it vos Ebbstein's. Vel, zey go in and I take my cab to ze yard. I see
  ze chentleman no more and I hear noding about him. Zen, on Sunday, Gomorrah
  come to me and say zat Mr. Zichlinsky want me to take ze chentleman to
  Stratford. He tell me to come for him at night a liddle before eleven. Ven I
  come to ze house&mdash;Mr. Ebbstein's&mdash;Gomorrah tell me ze chentleman
  haf got drunk. He vos very drunk; so Gomorrah and Ebbstein haf to help him
  out to ze cab."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by 'help him out'?" asked the Superintendent. "Was he
  able to walk?"</p>

  <p>"No, he vos too drunk. Zey haf to carry him out. Zey sit him in ze cab and
  zen Mr. Zichlinsky get in and sit by his side. Zey tell me to let down ze
  glass front, so I let it down and zen I drive to Stratford. Zey tell me to go
  up Stratford High Street, and ven I get zere I pull up ze trap and Mr.
  Zichlinsky tell me vich vay to go. Presently ve come to a row of houses vich
  seem to be empty, all but vun, vere I see a man standing at an open door. He
  make a sign to me and I stop and pull up ze glass front. Zen ze man get in
  and help Mr. Zichlinsky to take ze chentleman out of ze cab and carry him
  into ze house. Zey shut ze door and I drive avay and go home."</p>

  <p>"Was there any light in the house?" the Superintendent asked.</p>

  <p>"Zere vos a lantern on ze floor chust inside."</p>

  <p>"With regard to this man," said Mr. Miller. "Was he anyone that you
  knew?"</p>

  <p>"It vos very dark," Shemrofsky replied, evasively. "I could not see him
  plainly."</p>

  <p>"Still," said the Superintendent, "he was quite close to you when he got
  into the cab. I don't want to press you, but if you know who he was you had
  much better say so."</p>

  <p>"Vell," Shemrofsky replied, reluctantly, "it vos very dark. I could not
  see vell, but ze man seem to look a liddle like Mr. Trout."</p>

  <p>"Ha! And what happened after that?"</p>

  <p>"Noding. I go home and zat is all I know." The Superintendent reflected
  awhile. Then he held out his hand to the scribe, who passed him the written
  statement. When he had glanced through it he read it slowly aloud, including
  the questions.</p>

  <p>"Now, Shemrofsky," he said, "is that all you know? Or would you like to
  add anything to it?"</p>

  <p>"Zat is all I know," was the reply; whereupon "the deponent" was provided
  with a pen, an instrument with which he seemed unfamiliar, but with which he
  contrived to make some sort of mark, which the Superintendent countersigned
  as witness. Then Shemrofsky was conducted back to the other room, whence
  Trout was brought forth to take his place.</p>

  <p>"Well, Trout," the Superintendent said, genially. "Have you thought it
  over?"</p>

  <p>"Yus," was the reply: "and I am going to make a statement. I ain't going
  to lump in with them foreign crooks. I don't 'old with their ways and I've
  told 'em so over and over again."</p>

  <p>"Then I take it that you are going to tell us all that you know about this
  affair and that you are going to make a true statement."</p>

  <p>"I am," replied Trout, "though, mind you, I don't know anything but what
  I've been told."</p>

  <p>"What you have been told," said the Superintendent, "is not evidence.
  Still, it is your statement, so you can say what you please. You had better
  begin at the beginning and take the events in their proper order."</p>

  <p>"The beginning of the affair, as I understand," said Trout, "was when this
  gent came to Ebbstein's house. He came in Shemrofsky's cab with
  Madame&mdash;she was Zichlinsky's sister, I believe. They went in together,
  but Madame came out again almost at once and went into Gomorrah's house.
  Shemrofsky told me this. The rest of the story I had from Gomorrah.</p>

  <p>"It seems that Madame took the gent into Ebbstein's work-room. There was
  no work being done there that day, so the women what worked for him had been
  given a day off. There was three men there: Zichlinsky, Ebbstein and
  Gomorrah; and as soon as Madame was gone, the whole three set about the gent.
  But he gave 'em more trouble than they had bargained for. They had meant to
  hang him and they'd got the rope ready, but they couldn't manage him; and all
  the time, he was fairly raising Cain&mdash;hollering 'murder!' fit to fetch
  the roof off. Just then a woman runs in and says there was two coppers coming
  up the street. Ebbstein wanted to knife the gent straight away, but
  Zichlinsky wouldn't let him; but as they was close to the pickle tub, they
  got him bent down and Zichlinsky shoved his head down into the brine and held
  it there while the other two lifted his legs. They held on like that until
  the coppers had passed out of the street, and when they took his head out of
  the brine he was dead."</p>

  <p>"You had better say what you mean by 'the pickle tub'," said the
  Superintendent.</p>

  <p>"It is a big tub of brine what they pickles their herrings and cabbage in.
  There wasn't much in it but brine just then. They filled it up with fish and
  cabbage the next day."</p>

  <p>"And about this rope that you say they had ready. What do you know about
  that?"</p>

  <p>"It was a bit about a couple of fathoms long that was cut off a rope that
  belonged to Gomorrah. I don't know where he got it. But I know the rope
  because he brought the piece to me and asked me to show him how to make a
  noose in it. That was the day before they did the gent in. Of course, I
  didn't know what he wanted it for, so I made a running bowline in the end
  just to show him."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the Superintendent (and no doubt he did); "what happened
  next?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Trout, "when they'd done him in, they'd got to dispose of
  the body. For the time being they stowed it away in the cellar, and a rare
  fright they got while it was there; for some coves brought an egg-chest to
  the house in a mighty hurry. They thought Powis was inside it, but when they
  opened it a strange young man popped out. I fancy it was this young
  gentleman," he added, indicating me, "and a pretty narrow squeak he had; for
  Ebbstein thought he was a spy, and, being in a blue funk about the body that
  he'd got in his cellar, he wanted to do the young man in to make things safe.
  But the bloke what had brought the case wasn't going to be mixed up with any
  throat slitting&mdash;of course, he didn't know anything about the body
  downstairs&mdash;so they locked the young man up in Jonas Markovitch's room,
  and he got out of the window and hiked off.</p>

  <p>"However, that's another story. To come back to this job: the night they
  did the gent in, Gomorrah comes to me and says that him and Ebbstein is in
  difficulties. He says the gent was took ill&mdash;had a stroke, or
  somethink&mdash;and died suddenly, and they don't know what to do with the
  body. He asks me if I know of any safe place where they could plant it, where
  it wouldn't be found for a little while. Of course, he didn't say anything
  about the murder at that time. If he had, I wouldn't have had anything to do
  with the business. But as it seemed to be just an accident, I didn't see no
  harm in giving 'em a bit of advice.</p>

  <p>"Now, I happened to know Stratford pretty well. Got a married sister what
  lives there. And I knowed about those empty houses in Piper's Row, so I told
  Gomorrah about them and he thought they'd suit to a 'T'. So he asked me to
  take Zichlinsky and Shemrofsky down to the place and show 'em the way; and he
  gave me a bunch of skeleton keys and some tools to get in. But I didn't want
  'em; for when I went down there that night with Zichlinsky and Shemrofsky and
  picked out a likely-looking house, I found I could open the door with my own
  latch-key. So I told Zichlinsky that I would lend him the latch-key when he
  wanted to get into the house. And I did. I lent him the key on the Sunday
  afternoon and he give it me back the next morning."</p>

  <p>"You didn't go with him to Stratford when he took the body there?"</p>

  <p>"Me! Not much. He wanted me to, but I wasn't going to be mixed up in the
  business."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who did go with him?"</p>

  <p>"No. I don't know as anybody did. Anyhow, it wasn't me."</p>

  <p>"When did you first hear about the murder?"</p>

  <p>"Not until after the body was found. When I heard about it being found
  hanging in the wash'us, I smelt a rat. So I asked Gomorrah about it and then
  he let on by degrees. He wasn't quite himself just then on account of a knock
  on the head that he got from this young gentleman. First he put it all on to
  Zichlinsky, but afterwards I got the whole story out of him."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent waited for some further observations, but as none were
  forthcoming, he asked: "Is that all you've got to tell us?"</p>

  <p>"That's the lot, sir," Trout replied with cheerful finality, adding, "and
  quite enough too."</p>

  <p>"Not quite enough, Trout," the Superintendent corrected. "There's one
  other little matter that we want some information about. Have you got that
  small object about you, Mr. Brodribb?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb had, and presently produced it from an envelope which he took
  out of his letter case. As he laid it down on the clean, white blotting pad,
  I recognised with something of a thrill my long-lost and deeply lamented
  emerald.</p>

  <p>Mr. Trout regarded it stolidly, and, when the Superintendent asked him
  what he could tell us about it, he promptly replied: "Nothing."</p>

  <p>"That isn't much," the officer remarked. "Perhaps if I tell you something
  about it you'll remember something more. You probably know that Powis is in
  detention awaiting his trial. Now, this stone was in his possession, and he
  says that you sold it to him."</p>

  <p>"Well," protested Trout, "supposing I did. It ain't got nothin' to do with
  this other business."</p>

  <p>"But it has a great deal," said the Superintendent. "This stone was in a
  ring which is known to have been on the person of the gentleman who was
  murdered. This is the ring that it came from;" (here the Superintendent took
  from his pocket and laid on the blotting pad a rather massive gold ring in
  which was an empty oval space) "and this ring was found in the possession of
  Jonas Markovitch, who says that he bought it from you."</p>

  <p>"He's a liar," exclaimed Trout, indignantly. "He sold me the stone,
  himself. He took it out of the ring because it wasn't no good to him, as he
  was going to melt down the metal. I gave him a bob for it and I sold it to
  Powis for five bob. Markovitch told me he found the ring on the work-room
  floor."</p>

  <p>"Well, why didn't you say so at first, Trout?" said the Superintendent in
  a tone of mild reproach.</p>

  <p>"I forgot," replied Trout, adding irrelevantly: "besides, I couldn't see
  that it mattered."</p>

  <p>As it appeared that he had nothing further to communicate, his statement
  was read over to him, and, when he had suggested one or two trifling
  alterations, he signed it with considerable effort and the addition of two
  good-sized blots which he endeavoured to lick up. The addition of the
  Superintendent's signature completed the formalities and the prisoner was
  then conducted back to the other room. As the door closed behind him, the
  Superintendent uttered a grunt of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Not so bad," said he. "With your evidence, Doctor, and Mr. Gray's and
  these two statements, we may say that we have a complete case."</p>

  <p>"You think these two men will be willing to go into the witness box?"
  asked Mr. Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they will be willing enough," replied the Superintendent, "seeing
  that their evidence tends to clear them of being directly concerned in the
  murder."</p>

  <p>"What about Singleton?" Dr. Thorndyke asked. "Will he swear to
  Zichlinsky's finger-print?</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Superintendent answered. "He would have sworn to it before,
  only that it seemed impossible, and that he has such a holy terror of you
  since that Hornby case. But now he is ready to swear to it and give details
  as to the agreement of the separate features. So we have got a strong case
  even without these statements. But, Lord! Doctor, you haven't left us much
  glory. Here is your information," (he took a paper from his pocket and opened
  it before him) "describing the whole crime in close detail, and here are
  these two statements; and, making allowance for a few obvious lies, they are
  identical. The only weak spot was the murder charge against 'Madame,' as they
  call her; and she has solved that difficulty by throwing in her hand. Her
  suicide almost amounts to a confession&mdash;for although she hadn't been
  charged with the murder, she must have seen that she was going to
  be&mdash;and it will have put the fear of God into the others."</p>

  <p>"Speaking of the others," said Dr. Thorndyke, "do you propose to offer the
  three principals the opportunity to make voluntary statements?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, they can if they like," the Superintendent replied, "but I
  have advised them to say nothing until they have consulted their Rabbi or a
  lawyer. As they will be on trial for their lives, it would not be proper to
  encourage them to talk at this stage. No doubt they will elect to give
  evidence at their trial, and each of them will try to clear himself by
  incriminating the others. But that is their look-out."</p>

  <p>"With regard to David Hardcastle," said Mr. Brodribb, "I assume that you
  take the same view as I do: that he had no hand in the affair at all."</p>

  <p>"That is so," was the reply. "We have nothing against him. He seems to be
  right outside the picture. He would be, you know. This is not an English type
  of crime. It is pretty certain that Madame kept him entirely in the dark
  about the whole affair. And now, gentlemen, I think we have finished for the
  present and I am very much obliged to you for your help. You will be kept
  informed as to any further developments."</p>

  <p>With this, the meeting broke up; and as it seemed that my valuable
  services were no longer in demand at Mr. Brodribb's office, I was released
  (with a substantial fee for my attendance), after a cordial hand-shake with
  the four gentlemen, and went forth to view the neighbourhood of Westminster
  and to reflect upon the surprising circumstances in which I had become
  involved.</p>

     id="ch-18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE</h2>

  <h3>(JASPER GRAY'S NARRATIVE)</h3>

  <p class="first">TO most of us a retrospect of life presents a picture of a
  succession of events each of which is visibly connected with those that have
  gone before. Times change indeed and we change with them; but the changes are
  gradual, progressive, evolutionary. The child grows up to manhood and in so
  doing reacts on his environment in such a way as to set up in it responsive
  changes. But he remains the same person and his environment remains
  substantially the same environment. Though both alter insensibly from day to
  day and from year to year, there is no point at which the connection of the
  present with the past is definitely broken.</p>

  <p>This is the common experience; to which my own offers a striking
  exception. For into my life there came a break with the past so sudden and
  complete that in a few moments I not only passed into a totally new
  environment but even seemed, in a sense, to have acquired a new
  personality.</p>

  <p>The break came on the third day after my attendance at the police
  headquarters. I can recall the circumstances with the most intense vividness;
  as well I may, for, with the material gain was linked an irreparable loss
  that has left a blank in my life even unto this day. I was still on leave
  from Sturt and Wopsalls, 'standing by' at Mr. Brodribb's request, for
  possible, and unknown, duties, and having nothing to do on this particular
  morning had taken up my position in a reasonably comfortable chair to listen
  while Pontifex expounded the Latin language to one of his pupils.</p>

  <p>How clearly the picture rises before me as I write! The shabby room,
  ill-furnished and none too clean; the deal table&mdash;its excessive
  dealiness partially cloaked by a threadbare cover&mdash;invitingly furnished
  with one or two books and a little pile of scribbling paper; and the two
  figures that faced one another across the table&mdash;Pontifex, sitting
  limply in his Windsor elbow-chair and looking strangely old and frail, and
  the stolid pupil with eyes sullenly downcast at his book. I watched them
  both, but especially Pontifex, noting uneasily how he seemed to have aged and
  withered within the last week or two and wondering how much of the change was
  attributable respectively to Mr. Brodribb or Johnny Walker; and noting,
  further, that the latter was conspicuously in abeyance at the moment.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cohen, the present recipient of instruction, was not a promising
  pupil. It was not that he was a fool. By no means. I had seen him conducting
  the business of the paternal pawnbroker's shop and could certify as to his
  being most completely on the spot; so much so that my mission (as Ponty's
  agent) turned out a financial failure. But Mr. Cohen's genius was exclusively
  commercial. As a classical scholar he was hopeless. Poor Ponty groaned at the
  sound of his footsteps on the stair.</p>

  <p>This morning the subject of study was Virgil's Georgics, Book Four, of
  which the opening paragraph had been dealt with, painfully and incompletely,
  in the previous lesson.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Cohen," said Pontifex, with a cheerful and encouraging air, "we
  begin with verse eight, which introduces the subject of the poem. <I>Principio
    sedes apibus statioque petenda</I>. Let us hear how you render that into
  English."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cohen glared sulkily at his book, but rendering there was none beyond
  certain inward mutterings which had a suspiciously expletive quality.
  Pontifex waited patiently awhile, and then, as no further sound was
  forthcoming, he made a fresh start.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we shall simplify matters if we attack the translation word by
  word. Let us take the first word, <I>Principio</I>. How shall we translate
  <I>Principio</I>, Mr. Cohen?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Cohen reflected and at length pronounced the word "Principal,"
  possibly influenced unconsciously by some reminiscence of the three golden
  balls.</p>

  <p>"No," said Pontifex, "that will hardly do. Possibly, if you recall the
  opening sentence of the Gospel of St. John in the Vulgate. <I>In principio erat
    verbum</I>&mdash;ahem&mdash;" here Ponty pulled up short, suddenly realising that
  Mr. Cohen was probably not familiar with the Gospel of St. John in the
  Vulgate or any other form. After a short pause he continued: "Shall we say
  'to begin with' or 'in the first place'?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mr. Cohen agreed promptly, "that's all right."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Ponty. "Now take the next word, <I>sedes</I>."</p>

  <p>"Seeds," suggested Mr. Cohen.</p>

  <p>"Not seeds," Ponty corrected mildly. "We must not allow ourselves to be
  misled by analogies of sound. Think of the word sedentary. What is the
  distinguishing characteristic of a sedentary person, Mr. Cohen?"</p>

  <p>"Doesn't take enough exercise," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Very true," Ponty admitted; "and for the reason that he usually occupies
  a seat. 'Seats' is the word we want, not seeds. 'In the first place seats'
  <I>statioque</I>&mdash;seats and a&mdash;and a what, Mr. Cohen?"</p>

  <p>"Station," was the confident answer.</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" exclaimed Ponty. "Perfectly correct. Seats and a station
  <I>petenda</I>," he paused for a moment and then, despairing of Cohen's grammar,
  translated, "must be procured, or more correctly, sought. In the first place,
  seats and a station must be sought <I>apibus</I> the&mdash;for the what, Mr.
  Cohen?"</p>

  <p>"Apes," replied Cohen, promptly.</p>

  <p>"No, no," protested Ponty. "Not apes. Similarities of sound are misleading
  us again. Think of the English word, apiary. You know what an apiary is, Mr.
  Cohen?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Cohen said that he did, and I didn't believe him. "Well now," said
  Ponty, persuasively, "what does one keep in an apiary?"</p>

  <p>"Apes," was the dogged answer.</p>

  <p>What the end of it would have been I shall never know, for at this point
  footsteps became audible, ascending the stairs. Pontifex listened uneasily
  and laid down his book as they reached the landing. There was a short pause,
  and then a soft, apologetic tapping at the door. I sprang up, and, crossing
  the room, threw the door open, thereby disclosing the astonishing apparition
  of Mr. Brodribb and Miss Stella's mother.</p>

  <p>For a moment, I was so disconcerted that I could only stand, holding the
  door open and staring vacantly at our visitors. Not so Pontifex. At the first
  glance he had risen and now came forward to receive them with a dignified and
  rather stiff bow, and having placed chairs for them excused himself and
  turned to his gaping and inquisitive pupil.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Mr. Cohen," said he, "that we shall have to suspend our
  studies for this morning."</p>

  <p>"Right you are," replied Cohen, rising with unscholarly alacrity.
  Gleefully he snatched up his book and was off like a lamplighter. As his
  boots clattered down the stairs, Pontifex faced Mr. Brodribb with an air of
  polite and rather frosty enquiry; and the latter, who had not seated himself,
  showed less than his usual self-possession.</p>

  <p>"I feel, sir," he began hesitatingly, "that I should apologize for what
  must appear like an intrusion, especially after your clearly expressed desire
  to be left untroubled by visitors."</p>

  <p>"You need have no such feeling," replied Pontifex, "since I have no doubt
  that I am indebted for the honour of this visit to some unusual and
  sufficient circumstances."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, sir," rejoined Mr. Brodribb. "Circumstances have
  arisen which have made it imperative that I should communicate with you. I
  should have hinted at them when I had the pleasure of meeting you the other
  day, but your reception of me was not encouraging. Now, I have no choice, and
  I have ventured to ask Mrs. Paul Hardcastle to accompany me in the hope that
  her presence may&mdash;ha&mdash;lessen the force of the impact."</p>

  <p>Pontifex bowed to the lady and smiled a frosty smile. I looked at him in
  astonishment. The familiar Ponty seemed to have suffered some strange
  transformation. This cool, dignified, starchy old gentleman was a new
  phenomenon. But Mrs. Paul would have none of his starch. Starting up from her
  chair, she ran to him impulsively and took both his hands.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so cold to us, Sir Gervase?" she exclaimed. "Why do you hold
  us at arm's length in this way? Are we not old friends? It is true that the
  years have drifted in between us. But we were friends when we were young, and
  nothing has ever befallen to weaken our friendship. We both loved dear
  Phillipa and we both treasure her memory. For her dear sake, if for no other,
  let us be friends still."</p>

  <p>Pontifex softened visibly. "It is true, Constance," he said, gently, "that
  my heart should warm to you for the sake of that sweet saint, of whose
  devotion I was so unworthy. Pardon a crabbed old man who has made the world
  his enemy. One does not gather gratefully the harvest of one's own folly.
  Forgive me, cousin, and let us hear about your mission."</p>

  <p>"It is not my mission, Sir Gervase," she replied. "I came because Mr.
  Brodribb thought that my presence might make things easier for you."</p>

  <p>"That was most kind of you," said he. "But why do you call me Sir
  Gervase?"</p>

  <p>"The answer to that question," interposed Mr. Brodribb, "explains the
  occasion of this visit. I have to inform you with deep regret that your
  brother, Sir Edward, died some weeks ago. If I had then known your
  whereabouts, I should, of course, have communicated with you, not only as his
  brother but as his heir."</p>

  <p>Pontifex looked at Mr. Brodribb in a queer, bewildered fashion and then
  seemed to fall into a sort of half-conscious dreamy state.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear," he muttered, "so brother Edward is gone&mdash;and I am left.
  My old playmate gone and no word of farewell spoken."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he came out of his reverie and addressed Mr. Brodribb sharply.
  "But you spoke of me as his heir. How can that be? He had children."</p>

  <p>"He had one child," said Mr. Brodribb, "a son. That son died some ten
  years ago. Consequently, the title and the settled estate devolve on you. I
  may say, have devolved, since there is no question as to the succession."</p>

  <p>Pontifex listened to him attentively, but with the same curiously
  bewildered air. He seemed thunderstruck. After a moment or two he dropped
  into his chair and sat slowly shaking his head and muttering. Presently he
  looked up at Mr. Brodribb, and said in a weak, shaky voice: "No, no, Mr.
  Brodribb. It is too late. This is not for me."</p>

  <p>I stood somewhat in the background, watching Pontifex with growing
  anxiety. Like him, I was astounded by Mr. Brodribb's news. But in that matter
  I did not feel deeply concerned at the moment. My entire attention was
  concentrated on the change which had come over my father. It had begun in the
  very instant when our visitors had appeared in the open doorway. In spite of
  his cool, stiff bearing, I could see by his sudden change of colour, and the
  trembling of his hands, that he was intensely agitated. And now, Mr.
  Brodribb's announcement had inflicted a further shock. It was evident to me
  that the sudden accession to rank and fortune, so far from giving him
  pleasure or satisfaction, was profoundly repugnant. And dear Mrs. Paul, with
  the kindest intentions, did but make matters worse and intensify the
  shock.</p>

  <p>"It is not too late, cousin," said she. "How can it be when there are
  years of prosperity and ease before you? Think, dear Sir Gervase, think of
  the bright future which begins from to-day. You will leave all
  this"&mdash;she glanced round the shabby room&mdash;"the poverty and ill-paid
  labour and the struggle for mere daily bread, and go to live in modest
  affluence in your own fine house with your park and woodlands around you and
  your servants to minister to your comfort. And you will come back to take
  your place among your own people in the station of life which properly
  belongs to you. Think, too, of this dear boy&mdash;Phillipa's own boy, and so
  like her&mdash;who, in his turn, shall carry on the honourable traditions of
  our family. And think of her, who loved you and him and would have been so
  rejoiced to see you both come back to the inheritance of your fathers."</p>

  <p>Pontifex listened to her gravely, and, as she concluded, he looked at me
  with one of his rare, affectionate smiles.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Constance," he said weakly, "you are right. He is Phillipa's own
  boy. Faithful and loving and good like his mother."</p>

  <p>Once more, he lapsed into reverie and I stood gazing at him in dismay with
  a growing terror at my heart. For a horrible pallor was spreading over his
  face and even his poor old nose had faded to a sickly mauve. I think my alarm
  began to be shared by the others, for an uneasy silence settled on the room.
  And even as we looked at him he seemed to shrink and subside limply into his
  chair with his chin upon his breast, and so sat for a few moments. Then he
  rose slowly to his feet, his face turned upward and his trembling hands
  thrust out before him as one groping in the dark. I heard him murmur, "Domine
  non sum dignus!" and sprang forward to catch him in my arms as he fell.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>How shall I write of that time of sorrow and desolation? Of the emptiness
  that came upon my little world now that my earliest and dearest
  companion&mdash;almost, as he had sometimes seemed, my child&mdash;was gone
  from me for ever? But need I write of it at all? My tale is told; the tale of
  the destiny that came to me, all unsuspected, in the egg-chest. My father's
  death wrote Finis to one volume of my life. With that the old things passed
  away and all things became new. Jasper Gray was dead, and Sir Jasper
  Hardcastle had stepped into his shoes.</p>

  <p>Yet must I not make my exit too abruptly. The world which I had left lived
  on, and the drama in which I had played my part still claimed me as a
  dramatis persona. I pass over the quiet funeral and the solemn procession to
  the great vault in the shadow of the flint-built tower of the village church
  at Bradstow; my translation to the house at Dorchester Square, where the
  white-headed footman (whose deceptive powder I now detected) shattered my
  nerves by addressing me as "Sir Jasper," and where my cousin, Stella, openly
  worshipped me as her incomparable Galahad. It was all encompassed by an
  atmosphere of unreality through which I wandered as one in a dream.</p>

  <p>More real was the scene at the Old Bailey&mdash;the grimly sordid old
  Sessions House that is now swept away&mdash;where I gave my evidence amidst a
  breathless silence and afterwards, as the representative of the deceased, sat
  with Mr. Brodribb at the solicitors' table and listened to Dr. Thorndyke as,
  with deadly clarity, he set forth the crushing tale of incriminating facts.
  Quite unmoved, I remember, by any qualm of pity, I heard those five wretches
  frantically striving to cast the guilt on one another and each but hurrying
  himself to his own doom. Clearly, but still without a qualm, I recall the
  pusillanimous shrieks for mercy as the black-capped judge consigned the three
  murderers to the gallows; and the blubberings of Shemrofsky and the sullen
  protests of Trout as their terms of penal servitude were pronounced.</p>

  <p>It was a memorable experience, and it affected me with a curious,
  impersonal interest. As I sat at the table, I found myself again and again
  reflecting on the irony of it all; on the singular futility of this crime.
  For it was the means of defeating, finally and completely, its original
  object. The wretched woman who, in her greed and impatience to possess, had
  planned and directed it, had extinguished her husband's claim for ever. If
  she had but held her hand, poor Pontifex would have lived and died in his
  hiding-place, his very existence unsuspected, and she would in due course
  have become the Lady of Bradstow. It was the murder of my uncle Edward that
  brought my father into view.</p>

  <p>The years have rolled away since these events befell. They have been
  prosperous years of sober happiness; as they must needs have been; for a man
  can hardly fail to achieve happiness who is a hero in his wife's eyes. And
  such is my lot, though undeserved. To this day I am Stella's incomparable
  Galahad.</p>

  <p>Yet, though I would not under-value the gifts of Fortune, I am fain often
  to reflect on the inconsiderable part that mere material possessions play in
  the creation of human happiness. As I survey the fine old mansion, the shady
  park and the wide domain which is all my own, I find them good to look upon
  and to possess. But, nevertheless, there are times when I feel that I would
  gladly give much of them to look once more on dear old Ponty, sitting in his
  shabby dressing-gown, delicately tending the frizzling scallops. How little
  it cost to give us pleasure in those days! Mr. Weeks's salary would have made
  us rich, and we could have had scallops every night. But perhaps the habitual
  scallop would not have had the same flavour.</p>
