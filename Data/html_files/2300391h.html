<h2>ABOUT THIS BOOK</h2>

<p class="first">A NOVEL that is historical in the same sense as
<i>God and the Wedding Dress</i>, and <i>Mr. Tyler's Saints</i>,
that is, it seeks to reveal the springs of action behind famous
events and characters in English history; the mental and
spiritual growth of the nation as well as its outward events.</p>

<p>The characters here are William Penn, the man of peace, and
John Graham, Viscount Dundee, the soldier, the background is
composed of the highly coloured, stormy incidents that led to the
flight of James II&mdash;Killiecrankie and death for Dundee, the
failure of all his hopes of a new world for William Penn. The
terrors of witchcraft also enter into the story that moves from
England to Holland and America.</p>

<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="first">THIS is the third of the trilogy of novels
dealing with various phases in the spiritual history of Great
Britain. The endeavour has been to show in terms of action and
individual experience, varying aspects of the growth of British
thought. The first volume, <i>God and the Wedding Dress</i>, was
associated with the poetry of Henry Vaughan and the faith of an
Anglican minister of the late seventeenth century, the second,
<i>Mr. Tyler's Saints</i>, dealt with the religious conflicts of
an earlier generation, was illustrated by the poetry of Richard
Crashaw and dealt with Richard Baxter and Father Southworth. The
poetical affinity of the present volume is the folk-verse and
lore of Scotland and the historical characters introduced are
William Penn, the pacifist, John Graham of Claverhouse, and the
Cameronian Saints. In an earlier trilogy the author tried to give
three different aspects of the Renaissance in Europe, in the
present series the aim has been to give, on a narrower stage, the
same cross-sections of British history, not in the form of
swashbuckling tales nor in that of romancized biography, but as
studies in human drama played by characters profoundly affected
by the thought and superstitions of their time.</p>

<p>The present tale is told in the first person, as this method
seems best suited to the wild subject, bringing the reader close
as it does to the matter and allowing these strange events to be
related by an eye-witness.</p>

<p>The details and the background are both authentic, though in
this novel, as in the other two of the series, there is no
attempt at painful historical reconstruction; it is the spirit of
the times dealt with that has been aimed at.</p>

<h2><a name="ch00" id="ch00"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="first">
I HAVE put down this story&mdash;that is, my own
story&mdash;as I remember it; to me it is all pure truth, truth
of mind and spirit, as well as truth of material fact. But it
well may be that I have during the years that have passed since I
first went to Scotland, confused here and there, both dates and
places, making this event and that come out of sequence. It may
be also that I was mistaken in my estimates of the characters of
these great ones with whom I had to deal, I write of them as they
seemed to me. As I put together my memoranda my whole being was
made melancholy by a sense of loss, and I heard the words of the
old Scots preacher&mdash;"Build no nests here, for God has sold
the forest to Death"&mdash;but as I wrote further I became glad
of my life, my love, and resigned to all that had befallen
me.</p>

<p>The name of the noble family where I was pedagogue and of
their castle is too famous for my tale, and so I have painted
these people and this place under feigned titles.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; CASTLE DRUM</h2>

<p class="first">
"GIVE me the yellow gown, for I've a mind to wear it to-night
for the 'Witches' Gathering.'"</p>

<p>These were the first words I heard spoken in that grand yet
dreary place that was to be my home. It was followed by a break
of laughter, and standing at the foot of the dark stairs I looked
up and saw three young women standing on the first
landing-space.</p>

<p>One held a lamp, and the sound of my footsteps must have
disturbed them for she raised this above her head, and the three
of them drew quickly together and stared down the stone steps at
me.</p>

<p>I stared back in disdain, and in a manner, in rage. I had not
wished to come to this barbarous place, or to this ill-favoured
country, as I then thought it. I was melancholy, too, from the
long and tedious journey, and I leaned against the grim, cold
wall of the passage, folded my arms over my breast and eyed them
defiantly as I said:</p>

<p>"I am Thomas Maitland, who has come to tutor your
brother."</p>

<p>Upon which the three sisters moved again, as if a spell of
fear had been taken from them, and she who had spoken before
cried out:</p>

<p>"The English tutor! Why, that is only matter for a jest!"</p>

<p>And she turned again with a reckless look and gesture, at
which I wondered, to the tall dark girl standing next her and
cried:</p>

<p>"Off with the yellow gown! I tell you I've a mind to wear it
to-night!"</p>

<p>And she put her hand on the other woman's bodice, as if she
would have torn it from her back. But the third girl came between
these two, and in tones in which I detected more alarm than
modesty, bid them both be silent, for a stranger was present.
Then to me she called out, proudly:</p>

<p>"Come upstairs, and leave your portmanteaux in the passage
below, for a serving-man will see to them."</p>

<p>I obeyed sullenly enough; with every moment that passed I
liked the place less. I was really an exile, I had left England
unwillingly. I resented the bitter fact that my one asset was my
relationship to the Duke of Lauderdale; I was a distant cousin,
but we bore the same name.</p>

<p>I waited upon His Grace in my ruin and distress, hat in hand,
and gained this favour&mdash;a recommendation to Castle Drum. And
finally, after some tiresome delays, the offer of a post that no
one else wished for&mdash;that of tutor to the heir of Sir Donald
Garrie in Galloway, many weary miles from the banks of the
Solway.</p>

<p>It was full summer, but I had not liked the northern landscape
across which I had ridden. Perhaps if I had been better mounted
and more splendidly attended, Scotland had pleased me more. But I
was already angrily homesick for the quiet English pastures and
lush fields, the gardens spangled with blossoms, the houses sweet
with music and delicate odours. Here all were rude and wild, and
rude and wild, too, I thought, were the three women who stood
erect, curious, and, as I believed, hostile, to greet me.</p>

<p>She who wore the yellow dress&mdash;and it was a fine garment,
ill-suited to this stern place, of stiff satin on which the light
glimpsed in and out of the wide folds&mdash;was, I guessed,
two- or three-and-twenty years of age. Her face was handsome and
fierce, her eyes large, her nose high, her black hair lay in
untidy ringlets on her thin shoulders. Though she was young,
fresh, she had a hawklike look, and I was used to
carefully-nurtured women who cherished their beauty like a casket
of jewels. And this woman's cheeks were flayed from the meath and
her lips unpainted, and I thought that for all her fine gown she
had a coarse air.</p>

<p>The girl who had called out for the yellow gown stood beside
her and held up the lantern, looking at me curiously and
defiantly. She wore a dark, and as I suppose, a homely dress that
she might have been working in, but over her shoulders was
twisted a rich scarf of the Highland colours&mdash;tartan, or
plaid, as they termed them&mdash;and her hair was a rich colour,
too&mdash;gold with red in it, strong and gleaming, and caught
carelessly in a snood of bright blue silk. She had yellow-brown
eyes, like a pale agate, and the wind had whipped her cheeks
also. Her full lips were coarse in texture and ragged, as if she
constantly bit them. What I could see of her neck and bosom was
white and beautiful, and though her hands were rough in texture,
they were fine and shapely.</p>

<p>The third girl seemed to me to be the youngest, and her attire
was little better than that of a serving-maid, being of a coarse
material and rude in fashion. She also wore a plaid round her
shoulders, but it was of wool, and ragged at the edges. Her hair,
too, was red-gold and hung straightly to her waist in tangled
ringlets. Her eyes were soft, yellow and shining, like those I
have seen in a sleepy cat. And her features had a strange sulky
beauty that pleased me not at all. I noticed that she was
barefoot on the cold dark stones, and that the other two were but
untidily shod.</p>

<p>I was in no mood to flatter them or anyone else, I had no fear
of losing my position&mdash;it was not so easy to find a tutor to
reside in Castle Drum; I had been warned as much before I left
London; now I could see for myself.</p>

<p>"So you're Thomas Maitland," replied the girl who held the
lamp&mdash;more like a lantern it was, and fitter for a stable
than a drawing-room. "An Englishman, Elspeth, as dark as a
Highlander." They spoke with a barbarous inflection that my pen
could not imitate; though I give their speech here clearly, I was
many days in Castle Drum before I could understand immediately
what they said, and the plain English that I spoke was often to
them incomprehensible.</p>

<p>But now their looks, gestures, spoke clearly enough of enmity
and contempt. It was the dark dame who spoke first, she who wore
the brilliant and envied yellow satin gown.</p>

<p>"I am Elspeth Garrie, and these: are my stepdaughters, Jannot
and Isabelle."</p>

<p>The first of the two she had named was the youngest, the
barefoot girl, the other was she who held the lantern and who had
clamoured for the yellow dress.</p>

<p>I bowed. I had been told to expect a young mistress at Castle
Drum, the second wife of Sir Donald Garrie&mdash;a young virago,
I had been told, bitter, in her own childlessness, against the
sickly heir.</p>

<p>The prospect was not agreeable. I had miseries and failures
enough of my own to burden me without wishing to enter into the
troubles of Castle Drum. I acknowledged their scant courtesy
briefly, but I had to wait on their pleasure, for they made no
motion to direct me as to where I should go, but stood there
disputing again among themselves, as if I had not existed.</p>

<p>The argument was always about the yellow dress, the gathering
of the witches there was to be that night. I thought that they
spoke in a blasphemous and crude jesting way, and I leaned
against the wall, weary from melancholy and idleness more than
from bodily fatigue, disdaining to beg their attention and
waiting until they should see fit to dispose of me.</p>

<p>But I saw Jannot's eyes turn on me again and again,
quick-moving eyes shaded by thick gold lashes, so that the whole
of her orbit seemed filled with pale, sparkling light. She leant
towards the two others, her stepmother and sister, and whispered
something, and this seemed to stay their passion. And then I saw
that they were all looking at me with deepened enmity. And
Elspeth, who felt some responsibility no doubt as mistress of the
Castle, cried in a high voice to the others to cease their
quarrelling, "Or this foolish young Englishman may think that you
are serious when you talk of a witches' gathering."</p>

<p>"Maybe I shall," I replied disdainfully. "I have heard that
Scotland is the home of witches and warlocks, evil fairies, and
even of Satan himself."</p>

<p>They stood mute at that, and then Elspeth stepped forward and,
lifting up the yellow satin gown from her roughly-shod feet,
walked ahead, motioning to Jannot to follow with the lantern.
Isabelle, pattering on with her bare toes, came behind, and I
closed the procession.</p>

<p>I had had a glimpse, when I entered the Castle, of great
apartments on the ground floor, for one of the doors had been
standing open. These had seemed to be handsomely furnished,
though with great lack of taste.</p>

<p>But the rooms to which they showed me now were gaunt and bare
and my chamber had but few pieces in it. The uneven floor of
boards polished to a dark amber colour was covered here and there
by sheepskin rugs, yet there was a bedstead that might have come
from France, and that was hung by some excellent embroideries.
The curtains at the window were of grey serge, but between them
was a desk of Chinese workmanship on an ormolu stand. A large
press was both ancient and ugly. There was, however, a handsome
chair with arms well supplied with velvet cushions. There were
two candlesticks, one silver and one pewter, and a shelf occupied
by very ancient Latin, Greek, and Hebrew books.</p>

<p>The three women looked at me keenly, as if anxious to know my
opinion of this apartment. This I disdained to give them, but
demanded to be brought into the presence of my employer, and, if
possible, my charge.</p>

<p>"You speak boldly," said Lady Donald, but not altogether as if
this temerity displeased her. She glanced at her two
stepdaughters, with whom she now seemed to be on the best of
terms. "It's a dull life here," she added, "unfit for gentlefolk.
You must tell us all the town gossip, the London scandals and the
Paris fashions."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of such things, madam," I replied roundly.</p>

<p>"But we know something of you," replied Lady Donald, drawing
her heavy black brows together. "We know the tale that sent you
here, or part of it."</p>

<p>I was not greatly enraged at this insolence, for I had come
prepared for their malice. I had been warned by such friends as I
had left in London that I should not find this exile agreeable.
So I merely scowled in reply. In a manner I was glad to find that
courtly manners were not expected of me, my mood was
ruthless.</p>

<p>"My husband's away," said Lady Donald, after another long
scrutiny of my face, figure, and clothes. "And the boy's in bed.
You may see the old tutor&mdash;that's Richard Cameron. He is
going away to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And what can he have to tell me that I need to know?" I
asked. "Come, is this your hospitality, madam? I would have
water, clean linen napkins, some food and wine."</p>

<p>"White bread and French wine, I suppose," laughed Jannot,
maliciously.</p>

<p>"The best you have," I replied, for with the master away I
felt as if I was in command of the place. "Was this Mr. Cameron's
room?"</p>

<p>Lady Donald made an ugly grimace.</p>

<p>"No, the old man thinks this too fine. He's a saint, you know.
He sleeps hard and feeds on bread and water, and his eyes are
always turned upwards and inwards."</p>

<p>"Why did not you keep so excellent a character? I shall not be
able to emulate his virtues," I warned them with irony.</p>

<p>"He is a dangerous man to keep," said Lady Garrie sullenly. "A
learned man, a man who gives no trouble, and one who's worked for
half your fee, but Sir Donald will no longer keep him."</p>

<p>"A fanatic, I suppose," said I, for I'd heard of these stern
Presbyters, as they were termed, who were bitter against the
government of King Charles for forcing episcopacy on them. And
these things interested me not at all. What, indeed, was I
interested in at this time, save my own story?</p>

<p>I confess that I was to myself the most important person in
the world. Everything seemed as small as a grain of sand beside
the swelling magnitude of the disasters of Thomas Maitland. I
could have turned on the three women and driven them with foul
words from the room as they stood there close together, with
their considering faces and strange attire; how ugly and
incongruous the yellow satin gown of the elder looked beside the
homely garments of the other two!&mdash;staring at me,
inquisitive, insulting, spiteful. Perhaps they thought that I
desired them. Two of them, at least, possessed a gracious beauty,
and they appeared to have neither modesty nor discretion.</p>

<p>But my thoughts, my passion, my heart and soul and spirit were
entirely with Philippa, for whose sake I had had to leave
England, and who, as I then believed, I was never to see
again.</p>

<p>As the memory of this loss&mdash;that I had through my long
and painful journey into exile kept at bay&mdash;pierced me, I
was scarcely able to control a groan. Harshly and abruptly
turning aside, I began to throw down the books on the shelves in
the corner, declaring them to be of no use to me, and demanding
that the serving-man might be sent up with my valises and cases
of manuscripts. And, I added, brutally, "If the young boy whom I
am to train is like you, madam, and your stepdaughters, I think
my task of teaching Christian humility and of gentlefolk's
courtesy will be hard and maybe barren."</p>

<p>At that they seemed to realize their rudeness in staring thus
at a stranger, and a man who was, in a sense, dependent upon
them, and in another sense their guest.</p>

<p>Jannot, who seemed to take the duties of a servant upon
herself, then came forward, and drawing a flint and tinder from
her coarse apron, lit the candles&mdash;both those in the silver
and the pewter sticks.</p>

<p>I stood watching her, my arms again folded on my chest, as I
remember, and leaning against the rich desk that looked foolish
in those rude surroundings, while she drew the serge curtains
across the window. Then, taking up the lantern that she had
placed on the bed-step, she followed the other two women out of
the room.</p>

<p>They left the door ajar and I heard them laughing loudly, and,
as I thought, contemptuously in the passage.</p>

<p>When they had gone I threw off all restraint. I could no
longer control myself, though I knew how dangerous it is both to
mind and body to give way to pent-up agonies.</p>

<p>Philippa was gone, for ever lost! Like a star drowned in
endless depths of dark sea. And here was I, a landless man,
without estate or profession, unable for a long time to return to
England, forced to remain in this country that I, after a few
days' knowledge, thought detestable. I was too young, fierce, and
wilful to make allowances for my own mood, my own swelling self
filled the universe. I looked on the three women who had given me
so harsh a welcome, on the grey and solid castle built in ancient
days of bloody warfares, and a fit habitation now, as I thought,
for vultures, owls and foxes, as utterly abhorrent, as a part of
the ugly destiny that had enclosed me.</p>

<p>I was not prepared to try and suck some sweet out of this sour
grape. I saw no good, no loveliness in anything. I had travelled
meanly, without a servant, on a wretched hired nag, a hired man
changed at every posting-station, following with the baggage
horse. And these ignoble circumstances had helped to darken my
already bitter mood.</p>

<p>I remembered now, as I stood in this large, unfamiliar and
unliked room in Castle Drum, the long monotony of the journey,
those endless hills, purple and violet, that had encompassed me
on every hand. I had travelled slowly through gorge and valley,
across Cumberland, Northumberland, the Border. How gloomy had
appeared the wide waters of the Solway, how hostile the bleak
shores of Scotland!</p>

<p>Even then I had been minded to turn back and take my fate. But
youth will not easily give up, and ahead of me was a living, a
period of respite from many harassing puzzles. And despite my
sour, gloomy mood, hope was increasing, and I began to build
again a few poor schemes for the future.</p>

<p>I might, in this solitude to which I was bound, study. I was a
fair scholar. I might become famous for my learning, I might
enter the Church and reach a bishop's throne. I might&mdash;and
not for the first time did these thoughts creep and wind into my
mind&mdash;surprise some of the secrets that then seemed on the
edge of discovery. I might find out the mystery of the elements,
of fire, of water, of earth, of air. I had read the books of the
Rosicrucians, I had been the friend of that son of fire, Thomas
Vaughan, I had read many other occult works.</p>

<p>I had contrived now and then to visit the laboratories of
wealthy men and to make at their expense some studies in
chemistry, as I had always lacked both patience and means, my
time and fortune going on lusts and vanities. There had been on
me from my earliest years idleness and luxury, and I had been
proud and wilful, disdainful of any labour that did not please my
mood. My scholarship was owing to my love of learning.</p>

<p>I was proud, too, of my gentle birth, and I offended my elders
and my betters by these misplaced and dark vanities.</p>

<p>Then I had lost myself in my pursuit of Philippa, and
squandering my small estate in the purchase of those glittering
toys that best pleased my amorous youth.</p>

<p>But now I was thrifty and sober, and as I sat in the boat that
bore me across the quickly-moving waters of the Solway towards
the country that was to me one large prison, these old and
fantastic hopes rose again.</p>

<p>I had heard much of the legends of Scotland, I had read old
books found in strange places of their songs and tales. Like many
another youth for whom the world and all the world can offer is
scarcely brilliant enough, I had dreamed of Thomas the Rhymer and
the Queen of Elfland, who had taken him away to live for ever and
ever in the hidden palaces in the green hills.</p>

<p>I had thought when I reached Scotland that I would probe into
such stories, and that perhaps I, being young and comely and full
not only of lusty life, but of many warm dreams, might meet some
such stately fairy who would take me away to perpetual wantonings
beneath the glassy floor of a lake or in the sweet darkness of a
vast mountain untrodden save by lovely sheep.</p>

<p>I had thought that perhaps when I reached the gloomy castle
where my sole duty would be to teach a little Latin, a little
Greek, the use of the globes, a few tales from history, the
elements of mathematics to a sickly and a peevish lad, and that I
might find leisure to pursue my occult studies, perhaps to become
an adept in the black arts and be able myself to raise or create
the shapes that would satisfy my ambition and my lust.</p>

<p>But all these dreams were now to me but like a little dust in
the palm of my tired hand as I stood in the room at Castle Drum,
looking out at the black and fading landscape.</p>

<p>I had not been welcomed by anyone whose countenance or whose
words gave me hope that any of my desires would be fulfilled.
These were rude, barbaric people, savages almost, and I should
have to live among them as if I were amongst beasts. Their
language to me was harsh and repellent. I had seen their
serving-men, with rusty hair and beards and bare arms and short
daggers stuck in the leather belt, speaking a tongue to me
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>And the Castle itself, with its antique turrets and heavy,
half-dismantled battlements, was at that time but a prison.</p>

<p>My mood was exceedingly bitter. I was past prayer, nor did I
know of any God to whom I might put up a petition.</p>

<p>For I was, in the modern fashion, a sceptic, though I paid lip
service to the Church of England, and no man would have been
troubled by any heresy of mine. But in my soul I believed nothing
and always looked inward to wild and tumultuous fancies.</p>

<p>So I rose now, no prayer having been uttered, and pride
getting me to my feet lest one of these women should come upon me
and see my dismay.</p>

<p>I thought then of Mr. William Penn, who had been such a good
friend to me, and of his scheme, impracticable as it had always
seemed to me, for the man was in many ways harebrained, of
founding a city of brotherly love in the New World. This design
was not then ripe; he had asked me if I would wait until he might
persuade some of the great ones&mdash;the King, perhaps, or the
Duke&mdash;to give him a charter whereby he might acquire land in
America and take with him some of his people, who belonged to a
set called by the ribald nobile 'Quakers.'</p>

<p>But this design had not pleased me. I was in no mood for the
tranquillity preached by Mr. Penn, nor by the bustling activity
whereby he sought to obtain his projects. Besides, the man was
unfortunate; he had been in prison once and would be again. No, I
preferred my Scottish exile to Newgate, or possibly the halter. I
did not want to have my ears cropped or to stand in the pillory
and be killed by brickbats. And I was not a man to believe in
brotherly love.</p>

<p>But I thought of it now, that lunatic design, with regret.</p>

<p>It was Jannot who came in with the servant behind her with a
wooden tray on which was set cakes made of oatmeal, a bottle of
wine, some coarse meat and a rude, yellow earthenware bowl full
of soup that smelt savoury enough. The horn goblet was finely
mounted in pierced silver, and the napkin was of pure linen,
delicately embroidered.</p>

<p>Jannot, who made a pretence, insolently intended, as I
thought, of seeing that I was well served, stood about directing
the gaping maid. I saw that she had altered her attire; there
were latched shoes on her feet now, her bodice was more
discreetly laced, her smock drawn up to the throat and down to
the wrists. Her bright hair had been smoothly combed and twisted
into a blue snood like that which her sister had worn.</p>

<p>I could not avoid looking at her. It was a strange face to me,
a countenance that did not resemble any woman's countenance I had
seen before. The lines were pure and noble, the finely-moulded
bones showed in the cheeks and jaw. The native winds had
coarsened her carnation, but it was clear and bright, and the
peculiar colour of her eyes, the peculiar burnish of her brows
and lashes did, as I had noted before, make her eyes appear to be
of liquid gold.</p>

<p>I stood, in a disdainful courtesy, while she was on her feet,
but she bade me sit down to my supper and took the chair the
other side of the desk where the tray had been set; putting her
elbows on her knees and folding her hands under her fine chin,
she asked me if I had brought with me the things that she and her
sister had ordered from London&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wax candles," said she, "for these are but of mutton fat, and
a box of patches such as the ladies wear on their faces, and some
orris powder for the hair, and the roll of Florentine silk in
stripes of blue and red and yellow, a filigree cup and saucer in
silver, shoes for all of us in gold brocade, and a length of
dark-green silk to make me a gown?"</p>

<p>I did not answer; I was hungry and relishing my meat, coarsely
though this was cooked and served. Besides, the girl's demands
were folly. His Grace of Lauderdale's secretary had told me that
the ladies of Castle Drum had some requests to make as to
vanities that I might bring them from the Exchange, but they had
sent no precise list&mdash;I doubt if any of them could write, at
least, not English, nor any money wherewith to pay for these
foolishnesses.</p>

<p>So, when I had fortified my hunger, I told her. A quick fury
that amused me to see flashed across her face. Then her lips
quivered and her expression was that of a disappointed child.</p>

<p>"There's but one silk or satin gown in the Castle," she said,
"and that Elspeth is always wearing."</p>

<p>"I'd enough baggage of my own to bring," I replied
indifferently. "It's a long way to drag ladies' gowns and
slippers and suchlike vanities, madam," I answered. "Besides, I
am a ruined man, and there was no money sent."</p>

<p>"My father would have paid," she said stormily.</p>

<p>I was avenged now for the malice with which she had regarded
me before and I asked her what use such finery would be to her in
Castle Drum.</p>

<p>"Who is there to admire you here, madam? I heard you demand
the yellow dress that you might go to a witches' gathering. Were
all these gauds to dazzle the eyes of Satan himself?"</p>

<p>At that she looked at me very blackly like a cat going to
spit, then said violently:</p>

<p>"You're a fool, young man! I'll speak to you again in a few
weeks' time, when you've found out as much."</p>

<p>With that she rose and left me, to my great pleasure, in
peace.</p>

<p>The serving-man brought up my valises and took away the tray.
I then had some further pleasure in arranging my few possessions
in my new chamber.</p>

<p>I did not dare give myself time to reflect on my misfortunes,
or I must have fallen on some violent mood or evil passion, and I
yet wished to preserve my fortitude.</p>

<p>I was suffering from a double disappointment. First there was
the trouble that had sent me here, which was little less than the
overthrow of my entire existence. And second, there was the
disappointment of those faint hopes that had been raised when I
had been crossing the Solway and seen Scotland before me, had now
vanished when I found the country to be dull, featureless, and
rude.</p>

<p>I had brought with me such of my books as I had been able to
save from the sale of my effects, and it was with a sense,
however fleeting, of consolation, that I arranged on the desk and
the shelves from which I had cast those old tattered volumes
down, my Tacitus, my Ovid, my Erasmus, and many other of the
choicer gems of my once handsome library, from the poems of
Virgil to the pamphlets of Mr. John Milton.</p>

<p>"What," I wondered bitterly, "am I supposed to teach this
young whelp? Judging by his stepmother and his sisters, the
classics will mean little to him. Yet I know that the Scots are
able at learning, and I have met many accomplished scholars from
their ancient universities. But in this household there is no
spark of grace or letters."</p>

<p>I did not know when I was like to receive more candles, so
husbanded those I had. And the two that I allowed myself gave but
a dim and flickering light. They had, like everything else in
Castle Drum, been rudely made, and the coarse wick burned too
quickly and sent the rank-smelling mutton fat guttering down the
sides on to the silver sticks, for it was those on the pewter
stand that I had put out.</p>

<p>I felt a sense of triumph, as if I had given good proof of
steadfast courage when at length I saw my possessions fairly
arranged&mdash;my clothes in the press, my books on the shelves,
my desk supplied with inkwell, sand dish, and quill, my two
globes set out, my case of mathematical instruments in their
place.</p>

<p>I had kept one magnificent garment, a cloak of purple velvet
that I had bought in Paris, and that was very brightly adorned
with a design of acorns in bullion. I knew that I would have no
opportunity to wear anything so splendid, but though it would
have fetched a good price, and I sorely needed the money, I had
not been able to bring myself to part with it. And I was glad now
that I had preserved at least one garment that might remind me of
a past as brilliant as it was bitter.</p>

<p>I cast it now over the bed, concealing the homespun coverlet
that contrasted so rudely with the embroidered curtains that were
worked in a curious design of suns and stars. Even the ragged
yellow light from the candles showed the lustre of the rich pile
on that handsome velvet, for which I had paid so high a price,
though not more than it was worth.</p>

<p>While I was staring at the cloak and remembering the many
occasions on which I had worn it, there came a scratching at the
door. I believed it was one of the bold young women returned to
torment me, and I did not at first take any heed of this
vexation. But as the scratching became bolder I was forced to cry
out that whoever stood there might enter.</p>

<p>I heard the latch lifted, not with any very steady hand, and
it was a man well on in years who entered. His demeanour was
courteous and meek, and I was sorry that I had spoken hardly. I
took him to be the Mr. Richard Cameron whose place I had taken. I
could not have told his age, he might have been sixty years old
or more. He was thin and upright and wore the plain, and, as I
always thought it, forbidding attire of a Calvinist pastor. Even
in that outlandish place he had contrived to have his band
starched and pressed. His hair, that was the colour of wood ash
and very fine in texture, was neatly trimmed, and his face had an
aspect at once commanding and sweet.</p>

<p>As he advanced towards me I set him the chair with arms in
which I had been reclining myself, and he accepted this with a
gracious appreciation of my courtesy.</p>

<p>"I am," said he, "Richard Cameron, and I would have been in
the passage-way, or even at the gates, to welcome you, but the
women would have their will, their wilful will, I take it to
be."</p>

<p>This speech, though broad Scotch that I would not know how to
spell or put upon paper, was yet agreeable to my ear and not so
difficult to understand as had been the language of the ladies of
Castle Drum.</p>

<p>I was glad to meet him because he was a learned and, as I
believed, a civil and well-meaning gentleman. He was also a man
of a strange and, as I afterwards came to know, formidable
personality.</p>

<p>And he turned on me now eyes of a cold blue-grey colour that
reminded me of a winter scene and regarded me very keenly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Maitland," said he, "by what queer chance do you come to
Castle Drum to teach a poor young lad his Latin and his
globes?"</p>

<p>Although I liked the pastor, I was not inclined to give him my
history, and it was one that would have stung his ears. So I
answered merely that I was a ruined gentleman who had had some
influence with His Grace of Lauderdale, and through him had been
presented to this post&mdash;through one of my Lord's friends, or
panders, or hangers-on, what knew I?&mdash;to Donald Garrie of
Castle Drum.</p>

<p>"You might have been sent to a better place, Mr. Maitland,"
replied Richard Cameron, and his eyes looked as if a pale dim
flame had been lit behind them. "They are turning me out,
homeless, on to the moors. You know that, I suppose? No, never
start or raise your hand or talk of pity! I know where to go, I
have my friends, ay, and armed men, too. That is the manner of
folk the Garries are. That's the three women&mdash;have you seen
them?"</p>

<p>His last question came abruptly, like a ball from a cannon,
and was spoken with such meaning that even I, in my complacency,
was startled.</p>

<p>"Ay, I've seen them," I replied, "and ordinary pieces they
appear to be, uncouth and bold."</p>

<p>"They're more than that," replied Richard Cameron. "You are
going to live in the same house with them, and it's but fair to
you to know that two of them, at least, are witches."</p>

<p>I smiled at him. I had never thought&mdash;interested and even
absorbed as I had been in occultism, spirits,
apparitions&mdash;seriously of witches or warlocks. At best I had
considered them as crazed old women familiar with apes or cats,
but here was a grave, learned old man speaking seriously.</p>

<p>"They're young, but well favoured," I replied, not wishing to
check his talk, my curiosity alight. And to fill the pause, for
indeed I knew not well what to say, I snuffed the guttering
candles. And I was glad, though I had not told Madam Jannot as
much, that I had brought several pounds of fine English wax taken
from the hives of Devon honey bees, in my baggage.</p>

<p>"Ay, they're bonny enough," said Mr. Cameron. "But if you
should see them at night, in the ruins of the old chapel. Do you
think in London that such things are fairy-tales? I tell you,
these women met Satan himself, and one of them,
Jannot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a fair name for a witch!"</p>

<p>"Most of the witches in Scotland have been named Jannot, Mr.
Maitland&mdash;<i>she's</i> what we term the maiden, or queanes,
and sits at old Cloutie's right hand."</p>

<p>"That would be a sight I should like to see," said I, still
smiling and thinking the old man, for all his learning and piety,
was crazed in his wits.</p>

<p>"You'll see it, if you stay in Scotland&mdash;either Jannot
Garrie or some other woman. I suppose you're a Christian,
Maitland?"</p>

<p>"I belong to the Church of England," said I.</p>

<p>Then the old man began to talk against the government of King
Charles and all his ministers and all his bishops. And I was
weary and made but little of his discourse, for such matters of
politics, either in government of country or Church, interested
me not at all. It always appeared to me as if the affairs of men
were so jangled and so out of tune that no human could put them
right. What mattered to me the wrongs of Scotland or the
tyrannies of King Charles? I was as yet immersed in my own
vanity.</p>

<p>The old man saw this and stopped in his discourse, which he
had delivered with a power and a flower of rhetoric that I was
forced to admire, although I could understand but little of what
he said. Checking himself, he remarked with stately courtesy:</p>

<p>"What has the curse or the doom of Scotland to do with the
English? I was sorry for you as a young man, one whom I believed
had met with misfortune&mdash;a stranger here in this accursed
house."</p>

<p>He spoke the last words so solemnly that I was drawn up short
in my complacency as a plunging steed may be pulled up at the
edge of a precipice, and all his pride falls from him in a tremor
of fright.</p>

<p>"Accursed house!" I repeated. "And who are you to speak so of
Castle Drum? It seems to me to be but a rude habitation of
uncultured people."</p>

<p>"I go forth to-morrow," replied the old man, rising, and his
long shadow in the black gown was cast by the guttering candles
on the wall behind him, where it seemed to rise up and down and
to overshadow the whole room with menace. "Do not grieve for me.
As I told you, I have my friends, and they are armed men. I am a
power in this land, and one who will testify strongly for the
Lord. Do you think we are defeated because Charles Stuart, a
traitor and a damned son of Bel, is on the throne?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing of your tricks or your politics," I replied.
"I tell you I am a ruined gentleman who has come here for his
misfortune."</p>

<p>"For his damnation unless you are careful, Mr. Thomas
Maitland," replied Richard Cameron. "I came here for no concern
of my own. I have nothing more to do in Castle Drum, or with the
family of the Laird of Garrie. But hearing that you were here, a
young man and defenceless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Defenceless!" I caught at the word that seemed a slur upon my
manhood and my courage. "I have my sword and a case of pistols,
and my two fists also. I have not met a man who could defeat me
in bodily conflict."</p>

<p>"I'm not talking about men," replied Richard Cameron sternly,
and his pale face was yellow like the guttering candles, and his
wrinkled lips twitched as he spoke. "I am talking of the powers
of the dark. Do you know, young man, how mighty they are? Have
you ever heard of the wiles and traps of Satan? Have you ever met
the women who have yielded to his spell?"</p>

<p>"I think you talk like the actors in a playhouse," I replied.
"I am sorry to offend you, Mr. Cameron, but I have lived too long
in London, ay, and in Paris, to listen to tales of Satan and
witches."</p>

<p>Yet even as I spoke I thought of those forbidden studies that
had so attracted me, I thought of the days I had passed in the
laboratory of that son of fire and of Hermes, Thomas Vaughan. I
thought of all that I had begun to learn there and had laid
aside, half in idleness, half in fear. And leaning towards the
preacher in that dark and shadowed room where the yellow flames
of the guttering candles leapt and sank, I whispered:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mr. Cameron, what you know of these things, for I am
much interested in them, and I would give ten or fifteen years of
the wretched life I have still to live to meet the Evil One face
to face!"</p>

<p>And I laughed loud and long into those shadows.</p>

<p>The old man rose, he seemed to me a supernatural height, his
white hair and his pale face were both the colour of frost. He
looked at me with pity and with disdain, and I remembered what
Elspeth Garrie had said&mdash;"He is a saint"&mdash;and I felt
myself gross, lewd, and full of ugly lust before his frailty and
his contempt.</p>

<p>"Leave me!" I cried. "I came here for a retreat. I have left
behind me a life of what you would call sin, and defeat. I have
brought here but a few books."</p>

<p>"You will need but one book in Castle Drum," interrupted
Richard Cameron, "and that is the Holy Bible. There is no other
book worth carrying from place to place. What have the others
within their covers but vain thoughts, the vexatious disputes of
men? In the Holy Book is written the holy command of God."</p>

<p>"Would I could think so," I replied. "I have my copy of the
Holy Testament with me. It is not often that I unclasp it. Speak
to me of more practical matters. You see me here a young man,
delivered&mdash;I will not admit to witches, but to three wilful,
and I think, wanton women. What of this Sir Donald? Why is he
away? What is this boy whom I have come so far to teach?"</p>

<p>"The boy," said Richard Cameron, "is a clever lad. As to his
soul, I do not know if it is lost or saved. Sometimes he has been
under the influence of his sisters, sometimes under mine. It was
to fight for that soul that I remained in Castle Drum, enduring
malice and insult. And now the time has come when I can fight no
more. You do what you can for this poor lad. He is sickly, a
cripple, he can never fight a bodily war."</p>

<p>"I had known of it before I had left London." I was disdainful
too, for in the hot lust of my youth I despised all who were
weakly or diseased, and it was but a facile compassion that
caused me to answer:</p>

<p>"I will do what I may for David Garrie, but I suppose my
concern will be more with his father."</p>

<p>"Sir Donald is a man well on in years," replied Richard
Cameron. "He is much in the hands of his young second wife and
two daughters. It is the three women who rule Castle Drum, and
you will find them evil. They are, indeed," he added, lowering
his voice, "related with a known wizard. That is James Sharp, the
Archbishop, as they call him, of St. Andrews. Though in Scotland
since the Covenant was signed there can be neither bishop nor
archbishop, but only fiends and arch-fiends."</p>

<p>"Why, I know the Archbishop of St. Andrews," I replied. "I met
him in London. He seemed to me an amiable, though a weak,
man."</p>

<p>"He played the traitor," replied Richard Cameron in a low
voice. "But what is that to you? You have no concern in the woes
or the warning of Scotland. Archbishop Sharp, as you will have
that name for him, is a wizard. He has under his domain hundreds
of witches and warlocks. Hush, I will not speak to you, I see
that I spend my words on one who scoffs. Take care of your
sneers, young Englishman. Do not come to Scotland to gibe at dark
shapes and grim forebodings. There is more in this shadowed
island than you will understand, were you to live a hundred
years."</p>

<p>He put his lean hand before his hollow eyes, and I thought he
looked like a warlock himself, for such had I imagined these men
to seem; he was gaunt, thin, and seemed wasted by unnatural
living, and I noted that his gown was rusty and frayed at the
hem, and though his linen was clean and sweet there was poverty
and misery in all his other habiliments. And woe and desolation
at my fate seized me then as I looked round at the room so large,
so gaunt, with its grotesque assortment of furniture, rich and
modish, rude and fitted for a farmhouse. And I thought of the
time that I must spend there, and the fortune that was before me
if I left this refuge, and a cry was wrenched from me as I turned
to the window and pulled aside the curtains of coarse serge.</p>

<p>At this sign of weakness Richard Cameron's compassion rose. He
came to me where I stood and put his hand on my shoulders.</p>

<p>"You are a stranger to me and belong to those whom I should
hate, but you are young, and one has always compassion for youth,
be it ever so wilful or misled. I leave you behind in the
darkness of Castle Drum while I go out into the light of the
saints and the followers of the Covenant. But do you beware of
these three women&mdash;Isabelle, Jannot, and Elspeth. Beware,
too, of the physician, Dr. Fletcher."</p>

<p>I looked at him over my shoulder. I said:</p>

<p>"I heard the women disputing on the stairs. As I came up I
heard them arguing about the yellow satin dress, and
one&mdash;who was it, I forget now&mdash;said that she wished to
wear it for the witches' gathering. And I took it to be but the
wantonness of unlettered women."</p>

<p>"Take it to be what you will, Thomas Maitland," replied the
preacher, "there is truth behind it. These queans, go out to meet
Satan in the ruined chapel. So does that lost soul, Fletcher. If
you are abroad in the morning look at the old chapel, mark well.
Maybe you will need to know how to enter and how to escape from
those ruins built by the accursed monks of old."</p>

<p>I saw him again, his face matching the wax for yellowness as
he stood there with the guttering candles behind him; they were
falling now in their sockets, the coarse wax had made what the
waiting-maids call winding sheets, falling over the cups of
silver; and on the rough whitewashed walls on which were hung at
intervals rude pieces of cloth were the leaping shadows of the
old preacher.</p>

<p>I stared into his eyes and he into mine, and something that
could not be expressed in words passed between us. He was going
free, from what he called the accursed place, and I was to
remain. I had come from London and from Paris, from places where
men jested even about God on His throne above, where nothing was
taken solemnly, and where all was a matter for scoffing, even
birth, even death, and even love.</p>

<p>And I remembered Philippa, how I had last seen her in the
satin that was the same colour and sheen as the pearls about her
throat, stained with wine that a corrupt hand had cast on her
bosom, her eyes looking at me through a glaze of tears, her hair
falling on her rounded shoulders, the faded roses among the
tresses.</p>

<p>I remembered that, the faint timid laughter, the light of a
thousand wax candles, the glitter of a thousand gold pieces piled
upon the gaming tables, and I put a hand before my eyes, not
knowing what to credit.</p>

<p>The old man seemed to pity my distress. He muttered something
in his broad Scotch that was still like a foreign language to me,
but that I took to be a blessing, an appeal to his God, to the
guardians of his Heaven to have their watch over me. And then he
took me by the arm and asked me to walk with him to the door of
my chamber. He said that he had never seen the room before but
lodged in one as straight and narrow as the grave and where he
had but one candle and one bowl of porridge, one plate of
oatcakes, one glass of water in the day.</p>

<p>"And as for the young lad David," he said, as I parted from
him at the door, "remember that he has an immortal soul, and
fight for it as you would for your own."</p>

<p>Then he was gone from me and I heard the latch click into its
place. And I stood there watching the wicks flicker up and down
in the large pools of molten fat, and I watched how the purple
velvet on the bed which hid the coarse coverlet showed its rich
lustre in that last light.</p>

<p>That night I did not hope to sleep. I lay in the complete
darkness with no watch-light. It was the moonless week of the
month, and the darkness without invaded the darkness within, for
I had left the window open. My curtains were drawn, allowing the
soft yet chill air upon my face, cooling the blood beating in my
cheeks. Who was I to combat the perils of darkness?</p>

<p>I believed then what the old man had told me, and I wondered
where the three women had gone. Did such accursed creatures go
abroad on a moonless night?</p>

<p>I lay in my bed&mdash;the mattresses were soft, the pillows
wide and soft, and my hands were stretched out at my side and I
imagined myself in my tomb, the tomb such as my father's bones
rested in, with a painted alabaster monument above and inside all
my armorial shields arrayed, painted blue and purple, scarlet and
gold.</p>

<p>And who should lie beside me on that gorgeous tomb but
Philippa? When I first met her she had been another man's wife,
never could she belong to me save secretly in vile and sullen
passion.</p>

<p>And our private sin had been discovered and we had been put to
shame. And Philippa was her husband's penitent and I was exiled
to the Castle Drum.</p>

<p>As I lay in that thick darkness peopled by the evil fancies of
the days that were gone, how childish seemed my vices&mdash;the
jingling of the coins on the gambling-tables, the bawdy songs of
the revellers going home late, the despoiled houses, the sullen
wives, the glare of torches held by the sleepy little boys across
the courtyard, where the tired horses waited, the sedan chairs
painted in red and gold, the foul words of the greasy footmen as
they pressed in idleness about the gate.</p>

<p>And her face, not different in the eyes of others from the
faces of other wanton women, but to me beautiful, with the gold
dust in her hair, and the red paint on her lips, the satin smock
falling from her pearl-coloured shoulders that had the sheen of
the jewels round her warm, white firm throat.</p>

<p>How different from these three women!...</p>

<p>I sat up in bed, pulling the curtains yet further back and the
rings rattled on the poles.</p>

<p>I remembered Jannot's eyes like slits of golden fire, I
remembered the old preacher's warning, yet I could hardly believe
that he had really visited me in this very room, he seemed rather
like some figment of my dreams.</p>

<p>I reached out my hand and felt on the chair with arms that I
had drawn up beside the bed my sword in its scabbard and the two
pistols in their cases.</p>

<p>Clearly, sharply, yet all misty like a phantasy or dream, do I
remember that first night that I spent in Castle Drum.</p>

<p>I watched the dawn, the grey and spent fire, creep upwards
like water slowly filling a cask, until it reached the level of
my window and flowed into my strange and desolate chamber.</p>

<p>How useless now seemed my preparations of the night
before&mdash;my books so neatly arrayed, my purple cloak laid
across the bed, my sand-dish and ink-horn now meant nothing. I
was exiled in what seemed to me an 'accursed place,' as Richard
Cameron had called it.</p>

<p>And when I sat up in bed my shirt opened on my bosom, I felt
the air very cold, although it was summer, and when the cock
crowed beneath I felt an infinite melancholy, as if I was a lost
soul on the verge of Hell hearing for the last time a homely
sound of earth.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE LADIES OF CASTLE
DRUM</h2>

<p class="first">
THE next day I was presented to the young boy who was h2to be
in my charge. His father was still absent from the Castle.</p>

<p>I found the lad to my liking, though I had ever had an
abhorrence for those afflicted bodily. And David Garrie was not
agreeable to the sight with his long, distorted body, crooked
shoulders and limbs awry, and his thin pale face, his high nose
and hollowed eyes that made him look older than his years, that
were not sixteen.</p>

<p>He had the same bright-coloured hair as his sisters, but this
was often dark with sweat. What was his ailment I did not ask,
for courtesy, and was not told. I suppose that he had met some
accident in his childhood, I wondered they did not take him at
least to Edinburgh or Glasgow, if not to London, to see if some
experienced physician might not have healed some of his
hurts.</p>

<p>But there seemed to have been little care taken of him, though
one day he would be master of all their fortunes, and lord, as
far as I could understand, of many acres, although these might be
barren. At least, in this rude, wild country his position would
be a powerful one.</p>

<p>And there he lay on his couch that was drawn into the wide
window-place, with no other attendant than an ageing serving-man
and a dull boy.</p>

<p>He received me courteously, his speech and manner were
superior to those of his sisters. I noticed that his linen was
better cared for than theirs, his clothes neater, and his manner,
though not less haughty, not so coarse.</p>

<p>I found him, too, to be a considerable scholar. Richard
Cameron had taught this cripple well. The dullness of ill-health
and the constraint he felt before a stranger fell from him as he
showed me his shelves of books. He had sent as far as Paris for
copies of the classics, and had them there finely bound in tooled
leather with green and purple ties.</p>

<p>He was nearly as efficient as I was myself in the Greek and
Latin, and I believed that I should have some difficulty in
teaching one who was so little my inferior in learning. But David
Garrie assured me himself that he required more a companion than
a master. I was to read and discuss with him and help him pass
his lonely hours.</p>

<p>"For my sisters," he said, with a grim look, "give me but
little company, and my stepmother has other employments than that
of nurse."</p>

<p>I asked him if he was not sorry to lose the company of Mr.
Cameron? And he reflected a little before he gave me his answer,
which showed, I thought, a rare prudence in one so young.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cameron is too old for me," he confessed at last,
glancing at me with a chill approval, "you, Mr. Maitland, are
nearer my age. Mr. Cameron, besides, seems to belong too much to
these modern times, while I would tread backwards into extinct
glories."</p>

<p>"Not being able," I reflected compassionately, "to mingle in
the activities of your own day, poor lad."</p>

<p>But I humoured him, and in order to break the constraint
between us, sat by his side while he told me something of the
state of affairs in Scotland, a matter to which I had hitherto
given little or no attention. He told me about the Covenant, how
it had been sworn to by his present Majesty and afterwards, by
the same King's command, burnt by the common hangman. And how
black resentment had rankled in the breasts of many Presbyterian
Scots at this gross betrayal, as they termed it.</p>

<p>These facts I knew, though I allowed the boy to relate them to
me as if they were novelties. And as he spoke without passion,
yet putting the Presbyterian case fairly, I could see their side
of the question, as I had not concerned myself to see it
before.</p>

<p>"This Mr. Cameron," continued David Garrie, "is one of the
most fervent of the Presbyterians, or Covenanters, as they term
themselves. He considers himself held in a bond to resist the
King and the English to the utmost of his power. My father has
considered him as a seditious and perhaps a dangerous man, and
for that reason has sent him away."</p>

<p>"Where will he go?" I asked.</p>

<p>And David Garrie replied with a shrug of his thin, twisted
shoulders, almost in the words that Mr. Cameron had used himself
the night before when he had stood, his dark figure dim among the
shadows of my chamber.</p>

<p>"He will have protection enough over the whole of Scotland.
Ay, the protection of armed men also." Then with a rapid change
of subject that surprised me, the boy sat up on his couch and
asked me to move the velvet pillows at his back. I noticed that
these, in contrast to much that was so rude in the castle, were
as handsome as the cloak that I had bought in Paris and cast upon
my bed upstairs, and thickly embroidered in gold with the arms of
the Garries&mdash;three pierced hearts in a flowered border.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of magic, Mr. Maitland? Have you had any
strange conversation with spirits or phantoms? Have you seen
ghosts walking abroad by night or by daylight?"</p>

<p>I was a little startled by these questions, which chimed too
closely with my own thoughts. He sensed my surprise and added
slyly:</p>

<p>"I asked my father to see that one who was acquainted with
this new science was sent to me. I have heard a good deal about
it."</p>

<p>"From Mr. Cameron?" I asked cautiously.</p>

<p>"From him, too. He considers himself sent on earth
particularly to combat the tricks of Satan."</p>

<p>"Something of chemistry and the new sciences I do know," I
replied, still cautious. "These things have interested me, nay,
at times absorbed my spirit. But the affairs of the world have
been too much with me." I paused, not willing to unlock my heart
or to tell to this strange boy my own bitter tale.</p>

<p>But he had little interest in me or in my history. Clasping
his thin hands either side of him on the carved arms of his
couch, he began to talk a deal of matter that to me was
incomprehensible. It seemed that he had gone deeply into what he
termed this science of the supernatural. That he believed firmly
in all he said there could be no doubt, and much of it I believed
as firmly myself. I might be a lukewarm Christian, and on
occasion a fashionable sceptic, but I had no reason to doubt the
existence of the Devil, though I might doubt that he came as a
black man to dance on the heath amid a circle of wanton village
wives.</p>

<p>But David Garrie made no more ado about believing such tales
than if he had been present at some of these Devil's
holidays.</p>

<p>"If I were not lame," said he earnestly, leaning towards me,
and I noted the drops of sweat on his taut upper lip and his
domed brow, "I should have been abroad and seen these cantrips
myself. Mr. Cameron has seen them. The witches and the warlocks
meet in the ruined church which used to belong to my forefather.
John Knox and his men turned it over in the Reformation and laid
the vaults agape. Come&mdash;my Lord Lauderdale said that you had
some knowledge of these matters, Mr. Maitland."</p>

<p>"Maybe," I replied, withdrawn into myself, "but I came here to
teach you Greek and Latin, and I had thought of Scotland as the
home of pleasant elves and fairies the agreeable sprites of a
winter's tale. I suppose," I added cautiously, "we have in
England also these vulgar demons, but I have given little heed to
them."</p>

<p>"You do not believe them, perhaps?" asked David Garrie. "You
think they are all the babblings of ignorant old gossips who do
not know how to read and write? You do not, perhaps, believe in
the Bible? But in these antique tales that I read I come upon
wonders, too, and whom am I to dispute what wise men have set
down?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," I replied, "maybe. But what sort of place have I
gotten into, David Garrie, that our talk must be all of these
matters? The Devil may walk abroad oftener in Scotland than in
England, for all I know, but I am not to be cozened by the idle,
spiteful tattling of the ignorant."</p>

<p>The boy stared at me without replying, and I saw that this was
a serious matter to him. I felt a creeping uneasiness. Why had I
been sent for to Castle Drum? Not to read his books with this
boy, but to help him&mdash;how and why? And what part did the
father play in this cozening?</p>

<p>"Your sisters," I began, and then I saw the intent look in his
eyes deepen. He drew his pallid lips back from his teeth, the
crooked yellow teeth of a sick man, and said:</p>

<p>"What about my sisters? You saw them last night, I think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw the three ladies. They were disputing about a
yellow satin dress, and there was some jest about a witches'
revel."</p>

<p>The boy did not answer. His head drooped back on the handsome
cushion and his lids slid quickly over the eager eyes. Was it
possible, I asked myself, that he believed his sisters to be
Satan's darlings?</p>

<p>I rose and began to arrange the books he had shown me back on
their shelves; I was determined, for a while at least, to be a
pedagogue and nothing else.</p>

<p>"It is a pity," I said, with irony, "that if you believe
yourself surrounded by the legions of the damned you have parted
with Mr. Richard Cameron. A saint would be a good protection
against Satan."</p>

<p>"The old man wearied me," replied the boy indifferently, "he
talked too much of God."</p>

<p>"And what am I to talk to you about?" I asked. And as I looked
down at that forlorn figure on the couch, a deep depression came
over my own spirits.</p>

<p>I glanced past him at the window from which came the cold
light that enveloped him. It did not seem to be high summer here
in Scotland, in this room with the northern aspect. Why had they
put a sick man in a chamber where the sun never fell? How was I
to endure to live in this Castle? My pupil was obsessed by dark
fancies that I must suppose were the fumes of a sick brain. And
who else had I for company?</p>

<p>As I stood there with the books in my hand scowling at my own
fate and feeling like a man trapped, the latch was lifted and
Jannot entered. She wore a scarlet petticoat of thin silk that
fluttered when she moved like a blown flame. Her hair was free
again, curling to her waist, and her gold eyes were full of
excitement.</p>

<p>She crossed to her brother and seated herself on a corner of
his couch, and a scowl passed between them, a challenge on her
part and a defiance on his, I thought it.</p>

<p>"What have you told Mr. Maitland?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"He is here for my company, not for yours, sister," replied
the boy, with more energy than I supposed he possessed. "And this
room is mine, and while my father is away I'm master in Castle
Drum, and you shall leave me in tranquillity."</p>

<p>She threw back her head and laughed, and I could not but
admire the line of her chin and neck, the swell of her bosom
where it slipped behind the loose scarlet bodice. In that bleak
light from the tall, rudely glazed window I gazed at her under
lowered lids, thinking how strange a creature she was, how
different from Philippa, from every other gentlewoman I had
known. Gentlewoman seemed indeed an ironic term to apply to one
so wild, so discourteous, who was without either kindness or
charity or grace. And yet Jannot Garrie was the daughter of a
noble house, and must be considered by her father's numerous
tenantry as little less than a princess.</p>

<p>I spoke to her sternly now, meaning to pit my will against
hers.</p>

<p>"Madam," I said, "if your brother is to be in my charge, I
must ask you to leave me in peace during the hours that I am to
read to him."</p>

<p>"Read to him!" cried she, with a flaunting tone and a bold
look. "Who was reading when I entered this room? You were
talking, I believe, of Mr. Richard Cameron, and of witches and of
the Devil's tricks."</p>

<p>"You, madam, I suppose, were listening at the door," said I,
angrier than I wished to be.</p>

<p>"You've a deep voice," said she, rising, "and took no trouble
to lower it. Black man, indeed! You're a black man yourself, Mr.
Maitland. Your hair is like a burnt coal, and your eyes too."
Then she looked at her brother over her shoulder and added
disdainfully: "Captain Graham is coming here to-morrow. Mr.
Cameron did not leave us too soon. They've determined in London
to put down the Conventicles and to bring peace to Scotland."</p>

<p>There is no describing the disdain and scorn she put into
these simple words.</p>

<p>"Did you hear this talk in London?" she said, coming up to me
and holding her face close to mine. "You are a Scot yourself, are
you not?"</p>

<p>"I do not claim that honour," I replied. "I am a distant
relation of His Grace of Lauderdale, but I and my forebears have
lived for some while in England. And I would have you know,
madam, that I take no interest in politics or in the affairs of
Scotland. I came here to earn my bread, and I think," said I, my
temper getting out of hand again, "I shall find it hardly gained.
When does your father return?" I added.</p>

<p>She replied with her air that was at once fiery and
indifferent:</p>

<p>"He is away, he visits kinsfolk at St. Andrews."</p>

<p>"It's Dr. Sharp," said David Garrie from his couch. "He was
related to our mother, and Sir Donald, that's our father, you
know, does what any harassed man would do&mdash;he plays here and
there for safety."</p>

<p>"You talk like a fool," said Jannot. "We may have needed a
place of safety, as you term it, some years ago, now it's clear
who's master&mdash;and that's the King."</p>

<p>"I've met the new Archbishop of St. Andrews," I said, "and
I've heard of him in London."</p>

<p>"And nothing to his credit, I suppose," said David,
bitterly.</p>

<p>This was true enough. I knew of John Sharp, now the Archbishop
of St. Andrews, as a King's man, although at one time he had been
a champion of the people, a violent Presbyterian. I knew, for it
was common talk, that he had pledged himself to have the Covenant
observed, and then, like my own relative, His Grace of
Lauderdale, used all his influence to gain favour with the King,
and having gained that favour, he had turned his coat very
prettily and become a persecutor of the people whom he had once
led.</p>

<p>I believed him to be a weak and wilful man, more than an
utterly base or vile one. But I could understand that his name
must be loathed by all the Scotch Covenanters. And remembering
Richard Cameron as he had stood in my shadowed room the night
before, I felt that I would not care to be detested by these
Scots fanatics.</p>

<p>But what had any of it to do with me? I was a stranger in a
strange house, groping my way, as it seemed, through manifold
confusion.</p>

<p>"I'll wait till Sir Donald returns," said I, trying to
preserve my dignity, "to find out from him what my duties
are."</p>

<p>"You'll make yourself useful and agreeable," said Madam
Jannot, coming still closer to me and turning on me those eyes so
oddly golden.</p>

<p>I looked keenly at her to try to discover the trick of this.
Why should her orbs appear like liquid yellow fire?</p>

<p>"She's trying to enchant you," said David from the couch.
"They should not have sent one who was young and comely, but one
who was a cripple, like me. That's what I wanted&mdash;a wise
young man who was lame in body."</p>

<p>Seeing his passion roused at the wiles of the wanton girl, I
turned deliberately away from her and sat on my stool by the
couch, opening a book at random. I believed I had defeated Jannot
and she had left us, but a low meaning laugh warned me of my
mistake.</p>

<p>I turned, and there were two of them standing inside the door,
Isabelle in a gown of apple-green silk and the blue snood on her
bright curls, her lips drawn back from her pretty teeth. They
both laughed together, then went out as quietly as mice, dropping
the latch into its place behind them.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>In a few days I had come to a clear understanding of the
inhabitants of Castle Drum.</p>

<p>There were a great number of these, for the steward, the
housekeeper, and many servants lived in the large antique
building.</p>

<p>But of these I took little account, they seemed to know their
rude duties and to go about them without confusion. But for those
of us who sat at the high table, besides Madam Elspeth, her two
stepdaughters, and myself, there was an old, thin, yellow man by
the name of Doctor Fletcher who acted as physician to David
Garrie, who had been described as a warlock by Richard Cameron.
It seemed he had been a professor of medicine at St. Andrews
University and had left that place to remain in perpetual
attendance on the invalid heir of Castle Drum.</p>

<p>He was a quiet man who took little heed of what was going on
about him, but was absorbed, as I supposed, in his own studies.
He received me civilly and told me that hehad rooms set apart for
him in one of the towers that was disused by all save himself. He
invited me when I had leisure to come and see his study where he
had gathered many curios, for in his youth and mature age he had
been a great traveller.</p>

<p>I thought him now something past his prime and even shaken in
his wits. His attire was shabby and faded, the ladies treated him
with contempt, and I supposed that what the old pastor had said
of him was but malice and moonshine.</p>

<p>This Doctor Fletcher, indeed, I took to be a man who had had
many adventures and wished, in the shadow of his days, to come
upon some peace, and so he had fallen upon these odd quarters in
Castle Drum.</p>

<p>The establishment should have contained a pastor and Mr.
Richard Cameron had served this turn, but now he had gone, and I,
a layman, had taken his place, there was no Christian minister to
bless our meat or lead our prayers. These offices I was asked to
undertake, and the Bible was taken out of its large walnut-wood
box and laid by my place at every meal. I had no difficulty or
embarrassment in giving the Latin grace and reading the appointed
lessons and prayers for the day, but I was irritated by the
little undertones of laughter and whispers that came up from the
ladies seated at the board.</p>

<p>Our fare was very rude. I had never noticed before how I
relished dainty meat and cakes. But my stomach soon became used
to these coarse dishes. Our table service was like the rest of
the establishment, in some parts delicate, in others most
lacking. If it suited Madam Elspeth to concern herself with these
matters we would have pure linen napkins and silver salvers, if
she was in a forgetful mood the housekeeper would send up wooden
trenchers. Pewter wickets usually served for the candles, and
these were commonly of the tallow that I had found in my room on
my arrival. When Madam Elspeth was in the humour she would send
for some wax candles, kept in her own chamber.</p>

<p>The only other person who sat with us at the high table in the
great hall that was adorned by the antlers of great stags that
had been killed in the chase by Sir Donald Garrie and his
fathers, was a young man whom I took to be a poor dependant; a
distant relation of this house as I was a distant relation to the
House of Maitland.</p>

<p>I pitied these wretched cadets; well did I know their portion.
I had been fortunate in having had an estate from my mother.
Fortunate! it had gone too quickly to give me much benefit, and I
did not know now when in my exile I looked back upon my brief
life of splendour whether indeed I had been blessed by the
possession of the substance that had enabled me to see, to envy,
and to win Philippa.</p>

<p>This young man was named Evan Garrie, and I did not understand
his position in the household. He appeared sullen and withdrawn,
the butt for the humours of the ladies, and often, when he
visited the sick boy, for the petulance of David. The upper
servants seemed to pay him but little respect, the lower servants
were slow to do his bidding. Why, I wondered, did he not go for a
soldier? There was brisk recruiting going on just then in
Scotland, troops for the putting down of the Covenanters were
being raised in all the counties, and this Captain John Graham,
who had promised Castle Drum a visit, was, I knew, very earnest
in the service of His Majesty.</p>

<p>But young Evan Garrie passed an idle life in the Castle Drum,
keeping himself much withdrawn. He was comely, tall, and
fair-haired, but with dark eyes, his cheeks were hollowed and
gaunt, and he had a forlorn look, like a lonely young animal. I
pitied him, yet disdained him too. He had poor clothes on his
back, no money in his pockets, yet remained here without
endeavouring to go and seek his fortune in the world.</p>

<p>And then I thought of my own case, of how pitiful an object of
compassion I should be for any observer. Here was I, nearly as
young as Evan, stronger and more experienced, with more boldness
and confidence in my place, and yet I, too, remained in this
outlandish place of exile and made no effort to ward off my
fate.</p>

<p>But I promised myself that I was but gathering strength, and
that when the time came I would strike, a bold stroke, many bold
strokes if need be, to gain once more what I valued. To gain what
I loved? I asked myself that question, too, but I had an inner
hope that if I remained away from England long enough I should
cease to desire Philippa.</p>

<p>I was alarmed and a little dismayed to find that after but a
short space of time I had fallen into the routine of this strange
household.</p>

<p>That my presence was resented, I could not avoid knowing.
Everyone kept themselves&mdash;him or herself, secret and apart.
Even the boy who had so ardently desired my
companionship&mdash;and who had, as I learned, pestered his
father until he sent to England for some ruined gentleman, of
good family and fair education, to beguile his wretched
leisure&mdash;even the boy, I knew, had his secrets from me, his
deep reserve.</p>

<p>The women soon ceased to torment me. I seldom saw them; even
at the meals they would sometimes be absent and there would be
but the three of us&mdash;Doctor Fletcher, myself, and Evan, the
gaunt-faced, silent youth.</p>

<p>If I had been told during my London days that this was the
prospect ahead of me, I should have said that it was intolerable,
that I would sooner slit my throat or jump into the Thames than
support such an existence, but here I was enduring it, with my
senses, I suppose, and my emotions dulled, my own vanity clouding
every prospect for me, until at times I almost welcomed this rude
solitude that gave me so much leisure to brood upon my own
tragedy.</p>

<p>Captain Graham's visit was postponed. He had taken his troop
of horse in another direction, but he promised, appearing to be a
good friend of the Garries, to honour Castle Drum with his
presence shortly.</p>

<p>I had seen this man on one of his visits to London and been
impressed by his tranquil, almost feminine beauty. I had spoken
to him, for we were much of an age and in much of a position,
save that his estate was larger than mine and he had not been
such a fool as to lose it. He had been trying to obtain the hand
of a young heiress and had lost that and the fortune and the
title that went with it, and there was a gloom over his
comeliness when I had met him and spoken to him, we having a fair
acquaintanceship, in one of the rooms at St. James's Palace.</p>

<p>He had seen service in Holland but had left that because the
war was over and promotion hard to find, and returned to London
with letters of recommendation from the Stadtholder to the Duke
of York.</p>

<p>In order to distract myself from my own businesses I had asked
Captain Graham what he had intended to do, and he had told me
that he thought the best thing would be to ask permission to
raise a troop to put down the troubles in Scotland. It was from
him I had learnt the little I knew about the Covenanters. This
was before my own ruin, and I had no thought that I should find
myself in Scotland so soon.</p>

<p>I had asked him idly, looking at the painted ceiling on which
fleshly goddesses were reclining in the midst of curdled clouds
white as a goose's plumage:</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Captain Graham, the best thing?"</p>

<p>"For glory," said he, briefly, and turned on his heel. And the
words rang in my mind&mdash;"For Glory!"</p>

<p>I had repeated them to Mr. Penn, who had asked me to a
conference at his house soon afterwards. He did not know my exact
position and thought that I might be able to help him with money
towards the enterprise he had in hand of founding a new world in
America.</p>

<p>"Glory," said he, "there's but one glory&mdash;and that is
serving the Lord and through Him mankind."</p>

<p>"That's not the glory John Graham means," I replied, and Mr.
Penn in his eager way broke into my words and said it was not the
glory that any worldly man meant, but the only one that was fit
for an honest creature to pursue. I had amused myself amid my own
miseries and wretchednesses, and during those days when I was
parted from Philippa by pondering on this term, the glory that
Captain Graham desired, the glory that Mr. Penn desired, the
glory that I might hope to gain myself.</p>

<p>John Graham was a man of battle, he had no thought but war, no
hope but war; he wanted titles, ribbons, stars, a great name,
power. I believed he might gain all these for he was an
experienced soldier and a man of a passionate enthusiasm and a
harsh loyalty. Yes, it would be more likely that Captain Graham
would gain his desire than that Mr. Penn would gain his. There
might be glory in founding a city of brotherly love, but what man
would earn it?</p>

<p>And so I mused in these dark stone rooms where it seemed I was
to meet Captain Graham again and ask him how far he had got in
his pursuit of glory, the glory he hoped to achieve by quieting
the Lowlands of Scotland.</p>

<p>I soon learnt how quickly the summer was over in the North.
The purple heatherbell seemed to fade overnight to the colour of
dried blood, and there were no flowers left but the thistles and
their crimson crowns had changed to white. The landscape was
richly coloured by the scarlet berries of the mountain ash, and
the dark tawny gold of the fern that was like the colour of
Jannot's and Isabelle's locks.</p>

<p>It was cold at nights, and I was glad when David Garrie began
to shiver and to order fires to be lit in the great stone hearth
in the room where we worked. The stone walls were chilly and the
damp crept up at night, and I could understand how a man caught
an ague here.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>In fine rain and cold air I was walking one afternoon about
the moors that were still so alien to me when Evan Garrie begged
my company.</p>

<p>I supposed that he wished to confide in me some troubles that
I believed would be puerile and trivial compared to my own, but I
was prepared, though with a cynic air, to listen to them.</p>

<p>We walked for a while across the moors and the strangeness of
the landscape grew upon me and seemed to encompass me like a
spell. As I looked back upon the Castle it appeared to be a shell
upon the distant light sky, a dark and massive outline belonging
to older and ruder days, though in the west wing there had been
improvement and some of the latter Garries had attempted an air
of southern comfort and civilization.</p>

<p>The line of the ruined chapel, too, stood out dark against the
yellow twilight, and I asked my companion why the lords of Castle
Drum had never roofed over this sacred place and tried to protect
it from the mist and rain of heaven.</p>

<p>He replied, sullenly enough, that there was a chapel inside
the Castle where services had been conducted, that the Garries
were strange folk and spent their money on their own vices and
their errant whims, and but little on the sanctification or
beautifying of their dwelling.</p>

<p>"I suppose," cried he, as we strolled farther and farther
across the darkening moors, "you wonder at me, a lusty youth,
wasting my time in these solitudes?"</p>

<p>"Wonder?" I replied, in a mood as sombre as his own. "Sir, I
wonder at nothing. No doubt you have had your marvels at my
residing here?"</p>

<p>"I thought you," said he, shortly, "a man apart, a man of
estate, fortune, and person who might have done better than play
the tutor to a sick lad in Castle Drum."</p>

<p>I was silent in some anger. I did not care to be read so well
by a youth whom I had despised. And then Evan Garrie was to me an
object of compassion, therefore I did not care to be an object of
compassion to him.</p>

<p>But he relieved me of further vexation by saying simply and
yet with a boldness that pleased me:</p>

<p>"It may be you have guessed my misery, my story. I love to
desperation Jannot Garrie."</p>

<p>I had not guessed this, and swiftly I tried to put the two
people together in my mind&mdash;the girl with her golden eyes
and her gay frocks and her insolent, rude ways, and the gaunt,
withdrawn lad. I had not seen much of either of them, yet I felt
a pang that displeased me, for it was a sharp pinch and I
believed it might be of jealousy. Yet what concern had I in the
violent loves of Jannot Garrie and Evan Garrie, the poor,
despised dependant, as I took it, of Castle Drum?</p>

<p>"I do not know why you confide your secret to me," said I,
sullenly. "I am an Englishman, or like to think myself as such,
although I am a cadet of the House of Maitland. And I have come
here to escape tragedies of my own, and I do not care to see
another's tragedies clouding over me like so many wings."</p>

<p>"What tragedies are there," asked he, walking quickly to keep
pace with my strides, "besides that that I have confessed to
you&mdash;my love for Jannot Garrie?"</p>

<p>"You repeat those words as if you were proud of them," said I,
"but the girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say nothing of her," said he in a warning tone, "not that I
am squeamish as to her reputation, but be careful, for there are
ears in the winds and eyes in the trees. Jannot Garrie is a
witch."</p>

<p>I laughed in his face for my blood was not so warm as it had
been a few moments before. I remembered what Richard Cameron had
said to me in the shadows of my chamber, I remembered many
strange looks and broken whispers while I had been in Castle
Drum. I remembered the words I had heard the girl say the first
night I arrived at the dark castle when she had stood at the head
of the stairs trying to tear the yellow dress from the shoulders
of her stepmother.</p>

<p>"All the women are witches," said Evan Garrie in a lower tone,
"but that does not prevent one loving Jannot, does it? She may be
Satan's darling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush," said I, "I have gone some way in these matters and
have studied the supernatural science. I hope, if God gives me
grace, to see and face a phantom. I hope to investigate those
regions which lie between Heaven and Earth and Hell. But I will
not listen, Evan Garrie, to your babblings of these ladies."</p>

<p>"Ladies!" said he, and the word rang trivial and hollow across
the moors. "The ladies of Castle Drum!"</p>

<p>"And who are you," said I, stopping, and turning round and
taking him by the shoulders, "to speak so of the women of Sir
Donald Garrie who gives you house-room and food, and maybe a fee
to put in your pocket?"</p>

<p>"I am his cousin's son," said he. "I was a student and did
well in my work and I thought to make my livelihood and maybe my
fame in medicine, loathing war."</p>

<p>"You should belong," said I, "to the sect that Mr. William
Penn commands. Let me give you a letter of recommendation to him
in London. Do not remain, poor lad, in this wilderness."</p>

<p>He said passionately, leaning towards me in the waning
light:</p>

<p>"What matter of any of this, I am telling you, since I must
tell someone&mdash;or must I talk to the bandogs and the
owls?&mdash;of my love for Jannot Garrie. Have you," he added in
a lower tone, "ever seen such golden eyes? Even if they be a gift
of hell one must admire them."</p>

<p>"You talk," said I, "like a weakling. Be careful what you say,
remember that the witch hunt is up in Scotland. They burn women
who suffer under this accusation."</p>

<p>"Why," said he, in a voice that made me doubt if he was in his
wits, "I would rather see Jannot Garrie in the flames than
belonging to another man."</p>

<p>"Do you think," I cried, "to warn me? I have no love towards
any of these women, neither Madam Elspeth nor her two
stepdaughters."</p>

<p>"You are a strange fellow," said he, "I do not know why I am
minded to tell this secret to you. But I must speak to someone,
and events seem moving fast. We have been chained long in silence
and solitude here in Castle Drum. Soon Captain Graham is coming.
They are scouring the Lowlanders for these Conventicles, and
Richard Cameron has roused his people against the soldiers. Soon
there will be blood across the moon."</p>

<p>"Listen to me," said I, turning and seizing the young man by
the shoulder. "You seem a gentleman, one who might be strong in
mind and body. Listen, then! You say this girl is a
witch&mdash;leave her, go out into the world and either with gown
or sword make your way. You will meet other women as
fair...."</p>

<p>"Not," said he, interrupting stubbornly, "as fair as Jannot
Garrie."</p>

<p>"What of Isabelle?" said I, for it was she whom I had noticed
most, though Jannot had done her best to bring herself before my
eyes.</p>

<p>"Isabelle is a witch, too," said he, "and Elspeth. All three
are witches. Have you not learned as much while you have lived in
Castle Drum?"</p>

<p>"Quick," said I, "walk further away from the Castle. It seems
to me as if invisible spies are about us, carrying what we say on
the winds."</p>

<p>He looked back at the Castle and now in that dark outline were
streaks of light where the windows were. I imagined the women
within. They had their own chambers to which I had never been
invited, but I could believe that I knew how they sat there with
a great fire burning, one with a tapestry frame, and one with
perhaps a spinning-wheel, and another with a book. None of them
could read, as I supposed, but she might be turning the pages. It
would be a book bound in brass and she would be looking at the
pictures. And all of them would be silent, save now and then a
low laugh would pass between them.</p>

<p>And Doctor Fletcher would be sitting in the next room,
drowsing in his stool beside the bed of the sick boy. And the
tallow candles would flare up and flare down.</p>

<p>And in the kitchens the servants would be singing their rude
ballads while the harpist pulled the few strings of his ancient
instrument.</p>

<p>And there were we, two wind-blown figures&mdash;for the night
breeze was rising to a gale&mdash;out on the lonely moor, the
saffron streaks of the sunlight as the sun set becoming dimmer
and dimmer beyond the reaches of the purple hills. It was
solitary, it was chill, it was an evening which makes a man long
to turn to his home, to creep into his bed, whether it be straw
or down, to lay his face on the pillows and to dream.</p>

<p>I looked at the youth beside me and I felt a certain
companionship towards him, a certain sympathy and compassion. I
took him by his shoulders and I shook him, for I was much the
stronger man, though not by many years the older, and I cried
out:</p>

<p>"What would you have me do and why do you tell me you have
this passion for Jannot Garrie? If she be a witch, as you say she
is, what am I to do? Denounce her to these fierce saints whom
Captain Graham is sent to suppress?"</p>

<p>"Listen," said he. I could no longer see his face for he was
but a dark shape before me in the gathering darkness, and the
clouds flew low over the moor and that saffron light on the
horizon was soon eclipsed never to be seen again. "I love a
witch, and if I am damned for that, damned I must be. She goes
now and then to dance in the ruined Chapel of Saint Anne, where
her ancestors lie buried upright in the vaults, some in their
shrouds and some in their armour. And you have come, a stranger
from the South, and I have wondered if you could help me!"</p>

<p>"How could I help," said I, and my voice fell to a whisper, "a
man who loves a witch?"</p>

<p>"They are true," said he, sullenly, "to their gods as the
saints are true to Christ."</p>

<p>I had been, as I said, a sceptic in my thoughts, but this name
spoken now in this place made me shudder, and I had a mind to
fall on my knees and call out for mercy to some unknown God.</p>

<p>"I, too, have loved," I said, in an excess of weakness for
which I despised myself though which I had not foreseen. "I loved
a woman named Philippa in London. She was another man's wife. And
yet we loved, and that seemed to make no difference. And I
gambled that I might have more money to spend on gauds for her.
And so I lost my estate. And then she played me false and doubly
false. Well, no need to tell that tale now."</p>

<p>"I guessed," said he, in an avid tone, "that some such story
was behind your coming to some such place as Castle Drum. But
when you have seen Jannot, Isabelle, and Elspeth, have you not
forgotten Philippa?"</p>

<p>I was silent; the night winds blew across my face and I was
grateful for the chill across my brow for my blood was running as
hot as a man in a fever. Philippa? She had become moon-pale in my
mind, and the three women, the ladies of Castle Drum, were like
the suns of fairy-tale.</p>

<p>When I had first come there as a despised stranger, Jannot in
her scarlet silk that was fine and fluttering like a brown flame,
had seemed to take some notice of me and even deigned to lure me
to her side. But now many weeks had passed and she had not looked
in my direction.</p>

<p>"Let us go home," said I, "for it is chill and I think a storm
blows up. And what good do we do, discussing the ladies of Castle
Drum on these lonely moors?"</p>

<p>"Look," said he, "how the lights of the Castle burn up!"</p>

<p>And I turned and gazed over my shoulder, and there seemed to
be a light in every window.</p>

<p>"Sometimes they do that&mdash;make festival and
merriment!"</p>

<p>"And that sick boy?" said I, and I turned again and shook the
stupid youth by the shoulder. "When does Sir Donald Garrie come
home?"</p>

<p>"Soon, I hope," replied Evan Garrie. And then he began to talk
of worldly matters, of Archbishop Sharp, of the dastardly part he
had played, of the rage he had roused in the breasts of the
Covenanters. "I know a good deal," said the youth, slyly. "I have
listened to Richard Cameron talking, I have been with him to the
meetings he has held on the moors. And yet at the last minute I
drew back, not wishing to be involved in what was
dangerous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said I. "These things seem nothing in London, but here
they have a great importance."</p>

<p>What did I mean by that? I did not know. I was shocked by the
significance of my own words. Was I, who had come from the great
worlds of London and of Paris, thus far drawn into these rustic
politics?</p>

<p>I turned sharply away from the youth and made my own way back
across the darkening moors towards Castle Drum.</p>

<p>When I reached this, the lights in all the windows were
extinguished, and when I entered the great hall there was no one
there. And when I went up the stairs they were lonely, and my own
room was empty and the fire sinking into embers on the
hearth.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>David Garrie had ceased to importune me as to my knowledge of
witches. I saw that he kept to his own advice and brooded much
upon these matters that I thought dangerous for one in his state
of health. And I penned a letter to his father, still staying
with Dr. Sharp at St. Andrews, saying that I had taken up my
position and that I found the lad sickly and difficult, and that
I thought that he should have a pastor in his house and a
physician who was more modern in his ideas than Doctor Fletcher,
who, though no doubt a worthy man, spent too much time in his
laboratory in the tower.</p>

<p>But there came no answer to this epistle and I began to be
indifferent as to the health of David Garrie. For I was much
absorbed in watching the three ladies after what Evan Garrie had
told me. He had become withdrawn and sullen again after his brief
confidence on the moors and seemed to avoid me in the long
passages and dark rooms of the Castle.</p>

<p>The autumn was drawing in, the nights were long and the days
brief, and I became, as I suppose now looking back, somewhat
clouded in my intellect. This world was so different from any
world I had ever known before, these thoughts that came into my
mind were so different from any thoughts that had ever impinged
upon my consciousness before, the outside world of politics the
world in which Philippa moved&mdash;appeared with every day to
recede farther away.</p>

<p>Captain Graham visited us one evening, unexpectedly clattering
up through the dusk into the courtyard with his troop of sixty
horse. The place was large enough to accommodate all of them and
he sat at our board that evening.</p>

<p>I marked him curiously. A long time seemed to have elapsed
since I had spoken to him in the corridors of St. James's. But he
acknowledged me courteously, and I saw that he was still
practical in his mind.</p>

<p>"What of glory now, Captain Graham?" said I, leaning across
the table and looking into his beautiful face in the light of the
wax candles that Madam Elspeth had brought forth in his
honour.</p>

<p>"Glory?" said he lightly. "I do my duty." And I saw a curve in
his perfect lips and a light in his melancholy eyes that proved
he was a man doing the work he liked.</p>

<p>Then Evan Garrie began to question him and he briefly, as a
man who would not obtrude his business on the society of
gentlefolk, described how he was keeping Dumfries and Wigtown
quiet and clearing out of them those rebels the Covenanters.</p>

<p>"Have you met," I asked, "one Richard Cameron, who was tutor
in this house before he was turned adrift for his
fanaticism?"</p>

<p>"Richard Cameron? Why, he has such influence over these
Covenanters that they term themselves Cameronians in his honour.
Black Cameronian Saints," said Captain Graham, and broke his
bread into pellets and idly pushed it about on the cloth that
Madam Elspeth had laid in his honour&mdash;for often enough we
sat down at bare boards.</p>

<p>I looked at him as he sat there in his beauty, for his
comeliness was extraordinary, the curls falling either side of
his 'melancholy face and giving him an aspect delicate beyond
that of most men. And I wondered if I should resign my foolish
post with this sick boy and offer to join his troop and ride with
him across the moors, spying out these Covenanters who were no
better than rebels to His Majesty.</p>

<p>But he broke the train of my thought by turning to Madam
Jannot and saying:</p>

<p>"These Covenanters have a sharp nose for a witch."</p>

<p>At that she stared at him, and I gazed, too, from one to
another in the light of the wax candles: it was a softer glow
than we were used to at that rough board.</p>

<p>Then Madam Elspeth rose; she wore the yellow satin dress that
had been the matter of dispute the first day I had entered Castle
Drum. And she took up the branch of candles in her hand and cried
out in a high, rich voice:</p>

<p>"Captain Graham, I will light you to your room. We will have
no talk of witches, nor of Cameronian saints. We are all loyal
subjects."</p>

<p>He rose and bowed, not much moved, I think, by her high talk,
but he looked at me curiously, then at the two other girls who
stood by their places at the table&mdash;Jannot in her scarlet
and Isabelle in her green silk. These were their festival gowns,
I had learnt, and the only silk garments in the Castle; the only
satin one that was really rich and fine was that worn by Madam
Elspeth at the head of the table.</p>

<p>Before he left Castle Drum John Graham sent for me and I was
pleased to wait upon him. Not only was he a link with those old
days, but he was both a man I respected and liked. Yet I could
not forbear saying to him:</p>

<p>"I suppose, sir, that you have heard of my misfortune, how I
was ruined, both in love and fortune, and have come here to this
strange position in Castle Drum."</p>

<p>"I listen to nothing against my friends and acquaintances,"
replied he with his grand air. "Mr. Maitland, if you are weary of
a pedagogue's work, why do you not ride with me?"</p>

<p>I could not answer him, and he, always a well-bred man, did
not press me, but allowed me to demand a question of him:</p>

<p>"Why, sir, did you ask to see me?"</p>

<p>"I find myself," replied John Graham, "in a place where there
are not many men of your breeding. I speak to you as one who has
a wider experience than your fellows here in Castle Drum."</p>

<p>"What concerns you, Captain Graham, in Castle Drum, or those
who live here?"</p>

<p>"Sir Donald Garrie," he replied, "was my father's friend. And
I like you, Mr. Maitland."</p>

<p>He paused, with his cool air, but I never could suppose that
he was at a loss for what to say. I knew that he was about to
warn me, and I stiffened, as obstinate men will, resenting the
advice of those even whom they know to be their well-wishers.</p>

<p>"I wonder, Mr. Maitland, whether you understand Scotland? I
have one task&mdash;I serve the King. I am here to quiet the
Lowlands, I am here to rout out those people who term themselves
Covenanters, who are rebels, and in some cases, murderers.
Listen, Maitland, these people believe in supernatural agencies,
in witchcraft and enchantment. They believe that from my poor
buff coat bullets will rain off like harmless hail."</p>

<p>I looked into his beautiful face earnestly as he spoke. I
wondered if he was leading me to the subject of Jannot
Garrie.</p>

<p>"This is in many parts a wild country. They believe that
Doctor Sharp, the Archbishop of St. Andrews, is a warlock who
leads, like I am supposed to lead, and General Dalzell and
others, an enchanted life."</p>

<p>"What do these rude superstitions and beliefs matter to me?"
said I.</p>

<p>"You are in the midst of them," replied John Graham coolly.
"You are, in a fashion, in a strange position. I suppose you
know," he said, rising and flicking a speck of dust invisible to
me from his neat embroidered cuff, "that the three ladies of
Castle Drum are reputed to be witches? If you have any influence
over them, as an educated man and an Englishman, tell them to be
careful."</p>

<p>He looked at me keenly as he spoke and I knew not what to make
of his words.</p>

<p>"I have no influence over them," I replied at random. "And of
what should I tell them to be careful?"</p>

<p>"The law," said Captain Graham, sharply. And I laughed loudly
to cover my uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Then saints, the servants of God, and witches, the servants
of the Devil, are alike persecuted in Scotland?"</p>

<p>"Take it as you will," replied John Graham. "I have spoken,
and, as I hope, to a man of sense."</p>

<p>The next morning he was gone, and the place seemed lonely
without him. He was too fine a gentleman for Castle Drum, and I
believed him to be hard and cruel in his pursuit of glory, yet I
missed his elegance and the darkness and harshness of my exile
seemed intensified.</p>

<p>It was Jannot who found me moping by the fire and mocked me
for my gloom.</p>

<p>"Why did you not ride with John Graham of Claverhouse?" she
said. "You would have made a bold dragoon to hunt down the
whining saints upon the moss-side."</p>

<p>I looked up at her and said, as I had not meant to say: "I
suppose you know that Evan Garrie loves you? Why do you keep him
in torment?"</p>

<p>She appeared pleased at this, her eyes glittered like those of
a cat in the dark. She moved towards me, fingering the thin silk
of that scarlet gown.</p>

<p>"Put on," said I, "more womanly attire, nor flaunt in this
silly finery."</p>

<p>"You'd like to see me in linsey-woolsey, then?" she asked.
"Well, I'll wear it if it pleases you."</p>

<p>She sank down beside me on the settle by the fire and took my
hand in hers&mdash;so much boldness she had not shown before.</p>

<p>"How do you know," she said very softly under her breath,
"that Evan Garrie loves me?"</p>

<p>I was not minded to betray the boy's confidence, so I answered
brusquely:</p>

<p>"When a wanton woman and a silly lad get together it's easy
for her to have her way."</p>

<p>She laughed at that, throwing back her head and showing her
sharp white teeth and shaking from her brow the thick, red-gold
curls.</p>

<p>"Will you come to the old chapel to-night?" she whispered.
"Will you come and see us hold our revels?"</p>

<p>"John Graham warned me," I began.</p>

<p>She laughed louder and put her small hand, delicate in shape
though roughened by work, before my mouth. Then I did what she
had intended I should do, I took her into my arms and kissed her.
She laughed the louder still, and shrilly, until I put her from
me, disgusted at myself.</p>

<p>I went from her and returned to my place by the sick boy. But
he would have nothing from me that evening, being absorbed with
Doctor Fletcher, who had brought him some new medicine to assuage
the pains that attacked him lately.</p>

<p>And, indeed, I was averse from that air, infected and foul as
it seemed to me, of the sick chamber where the atmosphere was
full of the acrid odour of drugs.</p>

<p>The lean face of the doctor and the thin face of the patient
were close together on the bed, which I saw already in my mind
plumed and draped in black and silver for the last scene of
all.</p>

<p>I had not grown to love David Garrie and I much regretted the
long delay that his father made in the North. For I wished to
make to my employer a report of the boy, who was, although
learned, wise and clever in his own way, idle and wilful even
beyond what the state of his health justified.</p>

<p>So I was glad to go up to my own room and look at my own books
and the purple cloak that glowed so bravely over the bed. Even in
Castle Drum I might claim this place as my own.</p>

<p>But not for long, it seemed. There was a scratch at the
door.</p>

<p>I did not reply. I knew that my peace would be invaded,
although I never said a word.</p>

<p>The latch was lifted and Jannot entered. Into the gloom lit by
two tallow dips she came, holding aloft a branch of silver
candlesticks; in every socket was a white wax candle.</p>

<p>She did not wear the scarlet silk dress that I had spoken of
so mockingly but a plain smock of linsey-woolsey and over her
head a hood of the same dark-grey colour.</p>

<p>"I am going abroad," said she, holding her candlestick aloft
and at the same time dropping a slight and mocking curtsey, "on
an errand of mercy. Will you please accompany me across the
moors?"</p>

<p>"Going out!" cried I. "At this hour of the night?"</p>

<p>"Ay," said she, "and with witches and warlocks and
Claverhouse's dragoons and ranting saints abroad. And therefore I
have come to you, my bold and bonny gentleman, to give me your
protection."</p>

<p>I did not like the look in her golden eyes nor the curl on her
red mouth that I had kissed not long ago. But I could not refuse
her challenge. I had held her in my arms and then escaped her,
and she had followed me here to what I thought a sanctuary. But
why should I be afraid of Jannot Garrie?</p>

<p>"Bring your bonny purple cloak," said she, eyeing the garment
on the bed.</p>

<p>"What use is that," said I, "going over the moors in the dark?
And what's your errand of mercy, Madam Jannot? Since I've been in
Scotland," I added with a sideways look, "I've learnt that Jannot
is the commonest name for a witch."</p>

<p>"One might be a worse creature than a witch or a warlock,"
said she, "one might be a puling fool."</p>

<p>This I felt intended for me, and I stood still for a moment to
steady myself and turned to look at myself in the mirror that I
had brought with me. There was none provided in this grim place,
but in my dressing-case&mdash;the last remnant of my former
fortunes&mdash;was a mirror, and this I had hung by the handle to
the wall. In it now I looked at myself, to reassure my failing
confidence that I had some grace of manhood, some breadth of
shoulder and strength of limb.</p>

<p>I was glad that she had asked me, although I knew she was
lying. There was no errand of mercy she was going on, but some
dark business. And I was glad for the threat of adventure to be
away from these dark, gloomy walls, where nothing happened and
yet where there were always whispers in corners and sighs on the
corridors, and soft footsteps going to and fro from room to room.
And a sick boy with his brooding and his queasy fancies, and an
old man shut away with his great books in a tower. And Madam
Elspeth with her frowns and her tantrums, and Isabelle,
soft-footed as a mouse.</p>

<p>To torment and taunt her I turned and said:</p>

<p>"I owe my duty to your father, madam, and not to you."</p>

<p>"Oh," said she, dropping another curtsey, and I saw the wax
run down the candles she carried as they shivered with her
motion, "I speak to you, fair sir, as a lady to a gentleman, not
as an employer to a dependant."</p>

<p>I ignored the sneer she had made about the rich cloak I had
cast on the bed and took that of plain dark cloth I usually wore
from its hook on the wall. I pulled my leaf hat over my brows and
set my pistol in my belt and I was ready to follow her.</p>

<p>We went downstairs, lit by the silver candlesticks that her
fantastic whim had brought into my chamber. And there in the
lower room she quenched that, candle by candle, and brought out
from under her cloak a dark lantern. This she gave to me to
carry.</p>

<p>And so we set out from Castle Drum into the windy night. As
soon as the darkness was round us like a garment she drew close
beside me and I put my arm round her.</p>

<p>And so together under guidance we turned into the night, and
the wind was soft on my face and lifted my hair from my brow, and
for the first time since I had left England I forgot
Philippa.</p>

<p>It was towards the chapel we turned, and that was lit up, by
the light as I supposed of torches. There was a flickering and a
fitful gleam through the unglazed windows and a glow rose from
the roofless building that faintly stained the darkness of the
sky.</p>

<p>Jannot pressed close to me, I felt my blood flow freely and my
brain act quickly, as my blood had not flowed and my brain had
not acted when I first came to Castle Drum. Nay, since I had last
seen Philippa in London.</p>

<p>I declined, despite the mockery of Jannot, intended, I
believe, to lure and challenge me into a confusion and
bewilderment of mind and senses, nor despite the stern alarm of
Evan Garrie, to believe that there were satanic revels in the
ruins of the old church, though I credited that of the millions
of spirits and phantoms that walked the earth some of them are
occasionally made visible. I knew, too, something of human
credulity and ignorance, and this was a wild part of the country
in which both might well flourish.</p>

<p>I spoke of the matter to Doctor Fletcher, trying by blunt
words to call him from his abstruse studies.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to discover, Doctor Fletcher," I asked,
"in that tower room of yours? You have promised me a sight of
it."</p>

<p>"What interest have you in such things?" said he, lifting his
lips back from his shrunken gums in a way he had that gave him
the look of an old, tired animal.</p>

<p>"I like a scene full of action," I replied, "but ever the
things of the mind and spirit have haunted and tormented me."</p>

<p>And then I told him something of the tales that had been
chattered to me by Jannot, and told me with a groan by Evan
Garrie. And I added, to test him, that I had seen lights in the
chapel as I was coming home over the moors at night.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, muttering, "that might be some old man at
his need, burning turf or charcoal. What do I know?"</p>

<p>I pulled at his gown as he was turning away.</p>

<p>"You must know something. Have these women an evil reputation
beyond their own acres? Why does Sir Donald Garrie stay so long
away in St. Andrews? And is it true that the Presbyterian saints
think Dr. Sharp, the Archbishop, is a warlock?"</p>

<p>He stared at me with his weak, blinking eyes like an owl
suddenly forced into the daylight.</p>

<p>"Why did you come here, Mr. Maitland?" he
counter-questioned.</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied I, frankly. Then making a shot at
random I suggested: "Perhaps Sir Donald thought that his son
required some protection in a house full of witches and a
saint."</p>

<p>At this Doctor Fletcher suddenly laughed, throwing back his
head and cackling, so that I could see the muscles moving in his
thin throat beneath his ragged beard. I abhorred the old man,
having all lusty youth's loathing for the aged, with their
reminders of the grave.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right, Mr. Maitland," he said, "perhaps you're
right. Any time, when you have the leisure, you may come to my
room in the tower. I have a small laboratory there, some retorts
and limbecks."</p>

<p>"Well, chemistry is fashionable enough in London. It is
practised by the King and Prince Rupert," said I. "But what can
you hope to discover here, so far from all centres of
learning?"</p>

<p>I felt a wave of impatience and detestation for the foul
place. Why had I come here? I must have been a desperate man to
trust myself in so unlikely a place. An exile!</p>

<p>"I'll get me another employment," I cried. "I'm not fitted to
be a pedagogue."</p>

<p>I turned away from the old man in the windy corridor to find
myself face to face with Isabelle. How light of foot she was! It
must have been practice that enabled her to move about the place
without making a sound. She did not creep or seem to be sly in
her walk, which indeed was rather bold and upright, but she had
learned the fashion of moving as if she scarcely touched the
ground. If I had been a Papist I should have made the sign of the
Cross when Isabelle Garrie appeared before me.</p>

<p>I think she enjoyed the confusion I could not altogether
control. But she pulled at my sleeve and asked if Doctor Fletcher
had been talking of witches.</p>

<p>"There's too much talk of witches in Castle Drum," I replied.
"The magistrate's not far away, and Presbyterians who have a keen
nose for the Devil. I should be careful, my lady, how you make
these childish boasts."</p>

<p>"If we were witches," she replied, "there'd be nothing we need
fear."</p>

<p>"That's foolishly spoken," I said. "You know well enough,
madam, that however witches may vaunt and boast, the day comes
when they find themselves in the cutting-stool or at the
stake."</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "I could show you some tricks, were you not
so slow and stupid. For what do you think three women do, in a
place like Castle Drum, alone with an old imbecile man and a boy
who never leaves his couch?"</p>

<p>"Why," asked I, "is Sir Donald Garrie so often away, and for
so long?"</p>

<p>"Not so often away," she replied: "My father is here, year in,
year out. As it chances now he has gone to St. Andrews. He is
afraid, I think, of the Presbyterians since we turned off Richard
Cameron."</p>

<p>"Afraid, perhaps, I hear, that Mr. Cameron will denounce you
as witches, eh? And what were the tricks that you could show me,
madam?"</p>

<p>I disdained myself for giving her this encouragement, but the
truth was I was restless and weary in my spirit, I was glad of
anything to distract me. I did not intend to stay in Castle Drum;
I had been there a month and felt as if I had crept into my
grave. Those sunny skies, bare of cloud and revealing an infinite
distance were to me like the leaden lid of a coffin.</p>

<p>Isabelle took me by the hand, led me into the large room that
they termed their bower. It would have been, I suppose, in an
English gentlewoman's house, the great parlour or music chamber.
And Elspeth Garrie, who had lived some while in Edinburgh, had
tried to give the gaunt apartment a modish air. Two of the walls
were bare, but two were covered by French tapestries, there were
some handsome chairs of velvet fringe, and the one window was
hung with velvet also, although this was rubbed smooth in
places.</p>

<p>There was even, and this luxury did not show in any other room
in Castle Drum, a strip of Persian carpet in front of the great
hearthstone. And by the door stood a cabinet, very finely made in
ebony set with ivory.</p>

<p>Isabelle opened a drawer in this at once and with hasty
movements, as if she feared to lose my attention and interest,
she drew out a large slab of jet and laid it on the palm of her
small white hand. White, do I say! Ay, it was white enough now,
for since my first coming to Castle Drum she must have ceased
rude work and used some unguent, for her skin was no longer rough
and chafed but almost as fine as a London lady's.</p>

<p>"What trick are you going to show me with that black stone?"
said I.</p>

<p>She looked up at me straightly, I wondered if she was more
fair than Jannot. She was smaller, her hair the same colour, her
eyes not quite so golden and so bright. She had her one silk gown
on, she always wore it now and would, I think, until it was in
tatters.</p>

<p>She breathed on the slab of jet, then rubbed it lightly with
the palm of her other hand and bade me look into it.</p>

<p>"Take it in your own hand," said she, "and look into it long
and tell me what you see. Do not be hasty, for first everything
will be blank."</p>

<p>Glad of this amusement, I took the slab of jet into the
window-place where there was a stool, and seated myself
comfortably and took the slab in my palm, resting it on my knee,
and gazed into it.</p>

<p>First I tried to clear my mind of all floating fancies and
random thoughts. Then Isabelle was suddenly beside me in her
startling silent manner; she rested her hand on my shoulder, and
I thought: "If she is possessed of magic powers, in this moment
no doubt she will bewitch me. But I'll get away from the ladies
of Castle Drum."</p>

<p>I leaned forward over the slab of jet; I remember my hair fell
down and touched my hand, for I wore no periwig in Scotland.
Then, as will happen when one gazes long and intently at one
object, I became drowsy in my senses, and the slab of jet, in
which at first I had seen nothing, seemed to cloud over into a
stirring curdle of opal-coloured mist.</p>

<p>"Take your hand off my shoulder," I muttered to Isabelle, for
I believed that her touch was enchanted; but I felt the tips of
her small fingers pressed yet more firmly through my cloth coat
on to my flesh and bone. I would like to have moved, but I was
numb as well as drowsy.</p>

<p>I knew what I hoped to see in the jet, and that was Philippa,
seated in the fair England manor-house, with the red roses
climbing over the red bricks, the white pillars of the portico,
and she with her pale gown standing there with the fair soft
summer breezes blowing upon her, her fingers folded gracefully
one upon the other, brilliant rings of ruby gleaming there.</p>

<p>But I saw nothing of this. The curdling clouds parted to show
a gloomy scene.</p>

<p>"No need," I murmured, struggling to speak ironically, despite
my drowsiness, "to look into the jet to see this desolate
landscape. There's enough of it abroad round Castle Drum."</p>

<p>I thought I heard Isabelle whisper in my ear, but her voice
was no longer mocking, but keen and anxious. "What do you see?" I
thought she said. "What do you see?"</p>

<p>Over the moors came a coach with four horses, there were
outriders, all outlined in black against a fading light, as I had
seen Castle Drum and the chapel outlined against the saffron
twilight not long ago. They were coming as quickly as they might
along a rough road. Then a shot sounded deeply in my ears, the
coachman pulled up the leaders, who reared back on the wheelers.
And an old man put his head out of the coach. Then I saw that
from behind some bushes of gorses or wind had come several
figures of armed men, and they fired at the old man, who tumbled
out on the step of the coach. There was a dismal shriek from a
woman and a lady in a tawny-coloured travelling cloak came out of
the carriage and fell on her knees beside the old man.</p>

<p>I could see her face distinctly, although it was distorted by
terror. She was young and fresh, I noted her cloak of
tawny-coloured cloth with a lining of sage-green.</p>

<p>The whole thing was over me like a horror. I tried to rise and
twist as one does in the grip of a hideous dream. I heard
Isabelle whisper close through my hair into my ears: "Why do you
groan? What do you see? Tell me!"</p>

<p>They were all shadows, darkened and fused, but I could see
they were beating the old man to death and that the girl was on
her knees, screaming for mercy. There were dead men lying on the
ground.</p>

<p>Then the whole of the square of jet fused with a dark colour
of flowing blood.</p>

<p>And I shuddered so strongly that I broke the bonds of the
enchantment. The slab of jet fell out of my shaking hands, and I
heard it tinkle on the floor and the dull room was about me
again. Isabelle was resting on my shoulder, looking at me with
her yellow eyes.</p>

<p>"Did you see anything?" she asked. And I had no mind to tell
her what I had seen, for I resolved in that moment to get clear
of Castle Drum and if possible, out of pure compassion, to take
with me Evan Garrie.</p>

<p>Isabelle was angry with me because I would not tell her what I
had seen in the slab of jet, and I do not know what induced me to
keep my owl counsel so closely. I believe she had put me on this
as a test or trial, to see if I had the gift of second sight, as
they termed it. It may be that because I was new to these tricks
I had certain powers she did not possess herself, but I was not
versed in the gallimaufry of the doubtful arts.</p>

<p>The twilight was coming about her while she disputed with me,
and I stood sullen. My head was aching from the horror of what I
had seen. I was used to violence, and had fought my <i>duello</i>
and killed my man in my time when I had been in Flanders, but
there had been a dread about this lonely murder of the old man in
the sight of his daughter that had horrified me. And yet it was
but a play of shade, and they were strangers to me, both the man
who was dragged from the coach, and his daughter, as I took the
young woman to be.</p>

<p>So I tried to put it out of my mind and left Isabelle
brusquely, and went to meet Evan Garrie.</p>

<p>I found him with David, my charge, who was much petulant
because he had been left so long.</p>

<p>"Did you not come to the Castle Drum to look after me?" he
cried, and showed me a fair translation of one of Ovid's tales he
had made, neatly written out on expensive vellum and tied with
purple strings.</p>

<p>I had not then the heart to tell the boy that I was about to
leave this employment, and, indeed, prudence told me that I had
better bide where I was until I knew of a better place.</p>

<p>So I soothed the young man and lit his candles for him and
called up his servants to arrange his bed, spent half an hour
listening to his translation and correcting it here and there
with the aid of Mr. Golding's book that I had by me. And all the
while Evan Garrie sat by, not interested, but staying there
because there was no purpose in his life and he had nothing else
to do.</p>

<p>When I could at last leave my charge I took the other young
man by the arm and led him away, and gave him roundly my opinion
of Castle Drum.</p>

<p>"I will not stake my honour," said I, drily, "that these women
practise evil, but I think them wanton and headstrong, and I
believe they know some tricks of devilry that would bemuse an
honest man's mind."</p>

<p>"I've been here six years," replied he, sternly, "since I was
a little lad. And I love Jannot, as I told you, and I'll always
love her. If I can be no more than the bandog, I must stay."</p>

<p>"That," said I, "is the foolish talk of impulsive youth. Go
abroad and see other women as fair as this young
witch&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted:</p>

<p>"Witch, did you say?"</p>

<p>"I think she is!"</p>

<p>"Have you been yet to the chapel and caught them at their
satanic dances?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied grimly, "nor credit that they hold them. But I
think I'll be away from this place, nor wait Sir Donald's
return."</p>

<p>"You can't leave David," replied the young man, as if suddenly
affrighted. "You can't leave me," he added. He put out his lean
hand and gripped my arm firmly. "I think, Tom Maitland, you were
sent here for our salvation, and I'm not going to let you go
again so easily. It's been worse since Richard Cameron left. You
wouldn't notice that; you weren't here before. We had prayers
then&mdash;twice a day&mdash;and a service on Sunday."</p>

<p>"Well, I read the prayers and a grace, too," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you're not a consecrated preacher," said Evan
Garrie. "You do what you can, but we need some holy man to
sanctify this place. But leave that talk."</p>

<p>"Ay, leave it," I said sternly, "and come away with me. That
is what I intend to do&mdash;leave Castle Drum and Scotland."</p>

<p>"You've seen nothing of Scotland," said he, and I laughed at
his quick and angry defence of his own country.</p>

<p>"I know that," I replied. "I blame my own evil mood and sour
fortunes, not the place. Come with me&mdash;" And I remembered, I
know not why, the beautiful face of Captain Graham and his quiet
talk of glory. "Why don't you join Claverhouse's cavalry or come
with me?"</p>

<p>"For what end?" asked he.</p>

<p>"For glory!" said I, catching at the word, which came, I know
not why, into my mind that had been a little troubled and clouded
since I had looked into the wanton Isabelle's slab of jet.</p>

<p>"Glory!" repeated Evan Garrie. He drew his golden brows into a
frown. "I read an old book of plays that David has, and there
were many curious lines in it that chimed in with my own secret
thoughts. And one of them was about glory&mdash;it said that
glory was like a circle in the water, enlarging until it
dissolved itself into naught. Have you noticed that?&mdash;you
throw a stone into a pool and there's one ring after another
until the inmost ring reaches the bank and breaks and is
gone."</p>

<p>"Why, what of that?" said I, gloomily. "Each of us has no more
than his own life and maybe some fame after death."</p>

<p>"And what matters fame after death?" replied young Evan. "I
wish to live my life, and unless I can have Jannot..."</p>

<p>I took him by the arm, I remembered Philippa and forgot some
of my own aches in compassion for him. He was perhaps no more
than five years younger than I, but in experience there seemed a
lifetime between us. And still I urged him to get away from
Castle Drum.</p>

<p>"What can I do? What can I do?" he said. "Save a trooper, and
I've no liking for blood."</p>

<p>He confessed to me that he had a great sympathy with the
Covenanters, whom he took to be desperately wronged, that he had
hated Captain Graham when he had seen him sitting there at the
board with his cool smile and his elegant attire and his talk of
the Lowlands.</p>

<p>Mr. William Penn then came into my mind as an agreeable thing,
and I spoke of it to young Evan Garrie.</p>

<p>"There is a man," said I, "in London who may be thought
extreme in his opinions or fanatic in his enthusiasms. And when I
was with him I refused to listen to him, but now I think of him
with relish. Yes, in this sombre, cold place I like to amuse
myself with those dreams that Mr. William Penn had."</p>

<p>"What dreams were they?" said the young man, rudely. "And what
can another man's dreams mean to you or me?"</p>

<p>"Dreams of glory!" said I. I did not think of the glory that
William Penn thought was an earthly matter. "He rather thought to
please his God and to take many weary world-bitten people out of
this old country that is rotten and fretted with vices, and start
in the New World another country&mdash;a city that he said should
be termed of brotherly love."</p>

<p>Evan Garrie did not, as I expected he would, laugh at me. He
gazed back at me with serious eyes, and I sensed his youth with
compassion, and though I had not thought that I would ever again
take such trouble for another human being, yet I felt now
inclined to some exertion to save young Evan from Jannot
Garrie.</p>

<p>So I spoke to him in soothing terms of Mr. William Penn and
his scheme. I said how the man had suffered for the faith that
was in him, had been lodged, vilely and cruelly, in Newgate Gaol,
but now that he had a friend or patron in His Royal Highness the
Duke of York, the same man who had also been a friend to Captain
Graham of Claverhouse, and who held lands in America he might
farm out for this godly plan.</p>

<p>"It would be good," admitted young Evan Garrie, "to get away
from this country, which is dark and murk. Yes, it seems like
that to me&mdash;for all the skies are shining and the heather is
bright. And there is likely to be a battle here, ay, many
battles, for the Presbyterians are massed and armed with guns
hidden in towers and thatches, and I learned from Captain Graham
that it is the Government's intention to put them down with fire
and sword. They are to bring the wild Highlanders upon them, and
all are to be murdered who will not take the Oath&mdash;the Test,
as they call it, which means the denying of the Covenanter."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "it would be a man's work to join these
Presbyters, who seem at least brave and steadfast. Better that
than idling in these dreary rooms, allowing a woman to make you
fond and silly."</p>

<p>"I think," said he, "I'll take your advice. Although I've no
money, somehow I'll get to London and find this Mr. Penn. I'll
ask him if he'll take me to his new land over the Atlantic."</p>

<p>I was sorry that I had said so much, for when it came to it
the subject was wild and uncertain. And I remembered that Mr.
Penn had said that he might not be long in London, that he was
going to The Hague. I told this to Evan Garrie, told him to wait
awhile until I had written to London and had the news.</p>

<p>At this he turned sullen, as if he had lost faith in me, and I
was moved again with compassion as I saw him slouching away. I
was vexed with myself that I had taken the burden of another's
discontent on my shoulders, already bowed with my own troubles.
What was Evan Garrie to me? I wished to be free of him, and of
Jannot and Isabelle.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>It was the third of these ladies, Madam Elspeth, with whom I
had next to deal. She sent for me to the room where Isabelle had
shown me the picture in the jet; my lady was wearing the coveted
yellow satin she put on in the evening; it was a fine gown,
scalloped and embroidered with gold bullion. And she had a
falling lace collar of the fashion of the last reign, and her
hair twisted in curls and done up on the top of her head. For all
that, she was not a fine lady or a beautiful woman. She was too
thin, and the red on her cheeks served only to show the hollows
beneath. She seemed savage and restless, and though young was
gaunt and thin. She now began to complain, in a high voice, of my
behaviour in Castle Drum, declaring that I was neglecting her
stepson.</p>

<p>And I told her roundly that I cared nothing for this
employment and that I was soon leaving it. And I said at random
that I intended to go to Holland and take my fortune there at the
Courts of the Stadtholder. For I had two to recommend me there
John Graham and William Penn.</p>

<p>At this Madam Elspeth became frightened. Clasping her thin
hands together tightly she looked at me with her great eyes
glowing with some strong emotion, fear I took it to be.</p>

<p>"Don't leave Castle Drum, Mr. Maitland, yet," she implored.
"Not, at least, until my husband returns. There's trouble in the
country, you can see the signal beacons at night, if you look
out."</p>

<p>"I've seen fires burning," said I, interested in anything that
showed violent action to be likely in this gloomy country.</p>

<p>"I don't know what's going on," she said. "It's the forbidding
Conventicles again&mdash;they will meet. They gather together,
and preachers go about with armed men. It is like a rebellion.
Dalzell and Claverhouse and others, as you know, are raising
troops to put them down. And they'll send more soldiers from
England&mdash;you have this knowledge better than I. Many of the
lairds here support the Whigs, hide and feed the
preachers&mdash;and the little men get hanged for it."</p>

<p>"And why," said I, "should that make me return to Castle Drum?
Why does not your husband return? Even without your husband you
have a number of men, as I think, armed," for I had seen that
they had an arsenal in one of the lower rooms, where there were
numerous, if rude, weapons.</p>

<p>"But I want you to stay, Mr. Maitland," urged Sir Donald
Garrie's lady. "You're a gentleman, and these are but wild folk.
I can trust you, I hope," she added, in a stormy voice. "If I
spoke to you harshly just now, I am sorry for it."</p>

<p>"Why, so you should be if you're to ask a service of me," said
I. I did not feel obliged even to be courteous towards her, she
had treated me from the first harshly, and I much mistrusted both
her and her stepdaughters.</p>

<p>"I must confide in you," she admitted. "I have those two
girls, Jannot and Isabelle, under my charge."</p>

<p>"And a poor business you make of it," I thought, "letting them
trip about like wanton queans, instead of turning them into
modest gentlewomen."</p>

<p>I was not prepared for what she was going to say; these were
her next words:</p>

<p>"Mr. Maitland, as I said, I must trust you. We are surrounded
by what I can only term rebels. Preachers, among whom is Mr.
Richard Cameron, whom to our misfortune we nurtured here, have
gone abroad, rousing the countryside, not only against the
Government but what they term Devil-worship. Ay, the witch hunt
is up again in Galloway and Wig-town."</p>

<p>I was sharply interested, but tried to keep my features
composed as I replied:</p>

<p>"And how should the question of witches concern the ladies of
Castle Drum?"</p>

<p>She was ready for me and returned my challenge coolly, though
I could see that she was still deeply troubled, perhaps deeply
afraid.</p>

<p>"There is much witchcraft in Scotland," said she, "and much
secret worship of the Devil. Perhaps for years at a time nothing
will be said and nothing will be discovered. Then one man rising
up and cries of 'Vue, halloo!' and there's the hunt&mdash;and the
innocent and the guilty go to the torture and the stake. There's
not a corner of Scotland," continued Elspeth Garrie, wildly,
"where witches may not be found if they are sought for. These
Covenanters, as they term themselves, are as set against
witchcraft and the worship of Satan as they are set against the
Bishops, whom they take to be under the protection of
demons."</p>

<p>"And you think, madam, I suppose, that they may rouse the
fanatic and superstitious peasantry?"</p>

<p>"That I do," said she, "and we are three women alone. And as
we have more learning and a better education than any man for
miles around&mdash;" she checked herself, and I thought that she
was going to admit that they were, the three of them, objects of
suspicion, that they had been reckless in their sense of security
as the ladies of Castle Drum. But she was not so foolish as that;
she looked at me as if she was enjoying my disappointment as she
added:</p>

<p>"As we have a better education, we have protected in our
establishment several old women who have been suspected of
bewitching cattle and of transferring pains from which they
suffered to others. We know them to be harmless old bodies and
have protected them. They have work in the castle, but now I
think their names may be remembered. And this Mr. Cameron, when
he was here, was always protesting against their presence."</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Cameron protested against other things," said I,
grimly. I was vexed because she had asked me for my protection,
said she trusted me, then put me off with a tale like that. I did
not at that time think the three ladies of Castle Drum were
otherwise than mischievous and foolish. I believed they practised
stupid and perhaps disgusting rites, such as sticking pins into
the wax images of their enemies, making philtres to rouse love or
hate, mixing potions to increase their beauty, and suchlike
follies. But with real evil or real power I did not then connect
them.</p>

<p>The lady's terror was manifest, though I had to confess that
she kept a fair show of fortitude. And when I reflected on their
case, with the husband at St. Andrews and no one in the Castle
with them but a sick boy, an old, half-crazed man and some stupid
serving-folk who might, for all I know, turn traitors, I was
sorry for their plight. And I promised Elspeth Garrie, though
unwillingly, that I would remain in Castle Drum until Sir Donald
returned.</p>

<p>At that she seemed satisfied and thanked me in a friendly
fashion. And I noticed at the supper-table that evening that she
and the two other ladies did their best to flatter me. It was an
evening when we had the wax candles on the table, when good
French wine was served and our places were spread with linen
napery.</p>

<p>When I had been talking with Elspeth Garrie young Evan had
gone out of my mind or I would have reminded Madam Elspeth that
she had there a man on whose services she might call. I thought
of him in this connection when I saw him at the supper-table and
reminded my hostess:</p>

<p>"If you are attacked, either by Claverhouse's cavalry or by
the wild Covenanters," I said, "there is a knight ready to
protect you."</p>

<p>None of them liked the sharpness of my tone, and young Evan
reminded me sourly that I had promised to send him to some Utopia
beyond the seas, where the Golden Age might be discovered
again.</p>

<p>I was vexed at the sly and, as I thought it, evil laughter of
the women, and I championed the young man, leaning across the
light of the shining white candles, and said to him:</p>

<p>"I have promised to remain here until Sir Donald's return from
St. Andrews. Then you and I will leave Castle Drum together and
we will go to London and then straight to Holland. If no better
employment can be found we will take service with the Prince of
Orange."</p>

<p>At that the three ladies clasped their hands and laughed and
bade us both good cheer and good luck and hoped we would find
glory in the wars.</p>

<p>The word glory rang into my head again and I thought of the
simile of the circle in the water. How little any of us mattered,
how soon we should be gone from this dark-and whirling
planet&mdash;</p>

<p>I rose from the table, pushing back my chair, plunged in a
deep melancholy all of a sudden as a man may be seized by the
throat by his phantoms and thrust into the dark waters of
despair.</p>

<p>I could not endure to stay longer at that dismal board,
brightly though it was lit by the candles they had brought out in
my honour.</p>

<p>I went up to my chamber and sat there in the dark, that was
only dispersed by the dying embers of the fire on the wide
hearth.</p>

<p>And there Evan Garrie came to me after an interval and asked
if I would like to go abroad that night. He had a dark lantern,
he said, which he would conceal under his cloak. "And we might
visit the chapel." And I could see for myself some of the strange
things that were whispered about Castle Drum and the ladies.</p>

<p>As I have written, I did not at this time take any great heed
of any stories I had heard of these women. The place was
detestable to me, but I believed that this was the result of my
own humour and the savage desolateness of the countryside.</p>

<p>But as I was restless, tormented in myself, I willingly
accepted the young man's invitation. As it was usual for one or
other of us, or sometimes both, to watch by the sick boy, I asked
him how that duty was to be performed that night. And he said
that David had had one of his fits or seizures and that Doctor
Fletcher and a servant were in attendance on him, he had been let
a pint of blood and was now in a swoon. The Doctor would watch
him all night. I had little faith in the treatment of Doctor
Fletcher, his learning must have grown a little rusty in this
wilderness; but David Garrie was not my bodily charge, it was his
mind I had undertaken to keep. I had said nothing about
endeavouring to heal his disease. So I put him out of my mind and
felt no further responsibility for him.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>And the house being quiet save for the outdoor servants whom
they kept watching on the walls, we passed out, the two of us,
wrapped in our dark cloaks, through the postern gate. The
sentries were rude and ill-trained, and it was not difficult for
us to evade them for they lingered and perhaps slept on their
watch. And we were soon free both of the building and of the
grounds.</p>

<p>It appeared to be almost winter here in this grim north,
though I knew that in England the beech and the elm would be
showing golden leaves and the last lilies and roses blooming in
the well-kept gardens. Philippa would be spreading her plucked
blossoms with their spices and salts in the glow of the autumn
sun in order that she might fill her blue china bow-pots with
odours for the short December days. How odd that this thought
sprang into my mind now as we stood on the bleak moorland.</p>

<p>"What do you think to show me, sir?" I said to Evan Garrie. I
could understand that superstition must have him deep in its grip
and that he must believe in many crude tales that a child in
England would scarcely credit. How desolate was this country, how
wild the climate, these uncultivated fields and moors, the lonely
hills, the long winters, the lack of learning and books and
company&mdash;why, it was easy for these poor benighted people to
believe that the Devil walked abroad.</p>

<p>So thought I in my complacence as we-went together towards the
ruined chapel.</p>

<p>The moon had risen into a sky pale as a faded hyacinth bell,
from banks of heavy purplish cloud, and the thin pale light, like
dissolved pearl, drifted on to the sharp outlines of the ruins,
the broken arches, the defaced pillars of the papal church that
the followers of John Knox had laid low:</p>

<p>We moved towards this with cautious steps, keeping in the
shadows as best we might, though Evan Garrie said to me: "There
is no need for such caution. Many will be going to the chapel
tonight, and who is to know one from the other in the
moonlight!"</p>

<p>The air was very keen, I felt the flesh of my face chill and I
drew my cloak, not so much for diguise as for warmth, closer
round my neck.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie seemed to know the way well. He led me by divers
paths until we came to a block of fallen masonry. The moon, with
that swift spinning motion it seems to have when clouds are in
the sky, had disappeared behind a sombre band of vapour, and Evan
Garrie took advantage of this obscurity to seize me by the arm
and lead me where he would have me, into an archway that led to
some stone steps. I could just discern them, as he told me in a
whisper that they were safe and bade me mount quietly.</p>

<p>"It is the old belfry, rebuilt in later times after the church
was destroyed, though the Covenanters took the bells away in the
last King's reign."</p>

<p>Unthinking fool as I was, I followed the young man up the
stairs, my spirits raised by what I thought the triviality of the
adventure, for it reminded me of enterprises undertaken in my
youth when I had been light of heart and anything that savoured
of excitement had heightened my dancing blood. So I had gone out
at night, searching for owls' nests and I know not what senseless
trophies&mdash;to rob our fruit, may be, from a neighbour's
orchard when glasshouse pines and peaches would be placed on my
own father's table.</p>

<p>We reached the little chamber at the top of the belfry easily
enough and could look down, as my companion pointed out to me,
into the centre of the ruined church. The moon having swum clear
of the bank of clouds again, showed us these green aisles. Near
where the altar had once stood and before the ruins of a fine
window with broken tracery in the arch, grew three young beech
trees that still retained a few pale-gold leaves; harsh grass and
weeds carpeted the church; these were already bitten by the early
frost, and among them I could see the outlines of flat grey
coffin stones that covered the long-forgotten dead.</p>

<p>It was silent, not even the hoot of a bird, the rustle of a
wind broke the dense stillness, that seemed suddenly to qeat on
my ear-drums with more passion than a continuous noise.</p>

<p>What did I expect to see? I did not know, and if I had formed
any pictures of the satanic rites that Evan Garrie's excited
fancy had conjured up, I imagined that I should see a gathering
of women, headed by the ladies of Castle Drum, young and old,
poor and gentle, meet on the one sanctified ground, to dance, to
sing, to chatter, and to perform their futile, their trivial,
perhaps their obscene rites.</p>

<p>But no one appeared in that palely-lit enclosure.</p>

<p>I turned to Garrie and said:</p>

<p>"What are we waiting for? What do you think we shall see?"</p>

<p>He did not answer, and I heard a sigh pass from his lips. And
I continued to gaze from my small pointed window. The stone was
cold under my hand, and I was uncomfortable as I half leant, half
knelt, crouching in the narrow space.</p>

<p>Then, as I stared, I was conscious of something moving below.
It seemed a grey shape, as if it were of the same substance as
the weed-covered ground or the stained stone pillars. But it was
moving and detached from these, and seemed to be a human being
and yet to be crawling. It moved towards the large stone that had
once been hung with rich cloths and set with jewelled
candlesticks in the days when the Pope was lord in Scotland.</p>

<p>"Look!" I whispered. "What's that below?"</p>

<p>My companion replied only with a groan, and I felt my own
blood was not so warm in my veins. I had not expected anything
like this, and I wished myself back even in the gaunt rooms of
Castle Drum.</p>

<p>As I stared again I saw that the whole space enclosed by those
ruined walls was moving with these grey figures.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the ground heaved as I had noticed a piece of
rotten meat to heave with the maggots that were devouring it. I
could not count them, they were there so thick, these grey
palpitating shapes.</p>

<p>"It is the moon mist," I thought. "I am bewildered in my
senses." And I remembered with rage the tricks that Isabelle had
played on me with the square of polished jet. I turned my head
away and tried to steady myself by staring into the darkness.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie was clutching my hand.</p>

<p>"What do you see below?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I see death in many shapes!" he replied. "The place is full,
do not attract attention to us. This place is still blessed, they
cannot enter it. Hold this," he pushed something into my palm,
and my fingers closed on the four points of metal. He had given
me a Cross.</p>

<p>I tried to laugh, but looked down again. There were the shapes
swarming, heaving, crawling towards the altar. "Empty," said I.
"What are they worshipping? There is nothing there!"</p>

<p>Then I was angry with him for having brought me to this place
and set me in such a foul position. I tried to drag at his hand,
his arm, and pull him down the stairs again, but he stayed there
against the wall, peering out of the window beside me like one
bewitched. And I felt bewitched myself.</p>

<p>How lightly we talk of the Devil and his evils, how carelessly
we jest about the monsters of darkness! I remembered then what
Mr. Cameron had said to me about the ladies of Castle Drum, and I
wished I had him there by my side. Surely these men, these
Presbyterians, were right&mdash;the country was vile and haunted.
I felt my courage grow heavy and like a sea receding in my veins,
the sea of my warm blood that was chilling into ice.</p>

<p>The first figures had reached the altar, they overflowed it in
slow-grey waves, then mounted through the broken windows and
began to disperse like torpid rings of smoke in the dim upper
air.</p>

<p>Then I heard a little wailing music like someone playing on
the pipes that they had in this country, of someone singing.</p>

<p>I looked up at the moon to steady myself, for I thought that
the base of the ruined church was filled by globes of light that
changed and intermingled one into the other, and I would not
believe these to be anything but an illusion and so stared up
into the highest point of the heavens where the moon now shone
free, the clouds had drifted to the horizon, and the wind blew
very cold. It seemed to come directly from the moon on to my
face. I put out my hands into the white light as if I thought I
could clean them in that pure glow.</p>

<p>And then I felt Evan Garrie fall against me. He said: "Let us
come away! It is worse to-night than it has ever been."</p>

<p>I thought I should not be able to move, that my limbs were
trapped by witchcraft. And I held the little Cross that he had
given me tightly in my palm, and managed to move my stiff fingers
to my lips, then to open them and to kiss the Cross.</p>

<p>At that a little courage returned to me. I suppose he, too,
must have believed that he had the strength that was in this holy
symbol, for he was able to rise, and we turned and made our way
slowly, step by step, down the stairs that were worn and
crumbling and damp with slimy mosses and tangled with great thick
weeds, none of which I had noticed when we had come up so swiftly
and so eagerly.</p>

<p>When we reached the bottom there was one standing there like a
sentry on guard. He appeared of monstrous size, and as he turned
his face to look at us I saw it was that of a black man.</p>

<p>"Do not speak to it," moaned Evan Garrie, and his words were
hissing breath upon his lips.</p>

<p>We turned from this awful sentinel, and there was one of the
grey shapes lurking in the corner of the wall. It floated out as
we came by with a slow, sullen movement, not as if it were light
but rather like a heavy thing, solid, being dragged. And there
was a foul smell of putrefaction.</p>

<p>I stepped back from Evan Garrie, who was better used, I
thought, than I to these horrors.</p>

<p>And the shape paused by us and looked at me with the face of
Jannot, that same richly-coloured face with the tawny hair, the
eyes full of golden light, but now inhuman with stains of decay
on it that I had seen on marble statues that had long been buried
underground.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie pulled me away and we stumbled on. I tried to tell
myself that this was no more than a dream. I did not fear the
shapes roused in midnight slumbers, or in the lonely hours of the
morning as the cold dawn filled the gaunt bedchamber with a
soiled light. Cold I might be, even to the heart, even to the
marrow, but I rose from my bed to say "these are but
visions."</p>

<p>So now I must think&mdash;these were but fumes or humours of
the brain. I tried to think that they had given me at my last
meat some noisome drug. What were those boasted wines or cakes
with which they had been so eager to toast me.</p>

<p>Another shape approached us. It was decorously clad in russet.
I knew it for Doctor Fletcher and hailed him with a warm pulse of
joy. Here was another human being, a Christian man who would help
to guide us home.</p>

<p>But he drew near and turned upon us awful empty eyes, and I
saw that he, too, was one of this accursed crew.</p>

<p>Three times he passed us, kept pace with us for a while, and
then disappeared.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie was by my side, whimpering like a beaten hound.
Why had he brought me on so foul a journey, and why had I,
foolish in my complacency, allowed him to persuade me?</p>

<p>We reached that pile of fallen masonry behind which we had
hidden when the moon first shone upon us when we had left Castle
Drum. And there the two other women were waiting for
us&mdash;Elspeth and Isabelle. I knew them, being used now to
their foul trickery and their obscene shape. They appeared in
outline like those large grey slugs that I had seen crawling in
my father's garden after the rain. They were grey, too, as those
we had seen in the desecrated church, and yet shrouded and drawn
together. And that abomination that had the face of Elspeth took
no heed of us, but the shape that had the face of Isabelle moved
forward and her stained visage was pale in the pinched light of
the moon.</p>

<p>Made desperate by horror, ay, and by fear, I struck out at
this with my clenched fist, which seemed to go but into soft
cloud.</p>

<p>Then the appearances had gone and we were no more molested on
our way home, save that we saw, sitting near the confines of the
Castle grounds, a hunched figure playing upon the bagpipes, that
I took to be no mortal thing.</p>

<p>And I knew then that Castle Drum and all the ground about was
truly infested with the powers of evil.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>As I reached the Castle I thought of the sick boy and the
shape of Doctor Fletcher that I had seen walking in the ruins of
the church.</p>

<p>"He, too!" I thought. "Perhaps he, too?"</p>

<p>I turned and looked at Evan Garrie, who appeared like one
crazy with a mortal sickness.</p>

<p>I took him into the great dining-room, where they had lit the
wax candles and brought the French wine to me that evening. There
was still some of the native raw spirit in the horn and silver
goblets, standing carelessly, after their fashion, on the
serving-board. I gave him some of r this and took a draught
myself.</p>

<p>Gradually the world of reality slipped into place about me.
Reality, say I, there was but little of that in Castle Drum. Even
now this room seemed to me strange and heavy, infected
ground.</p>

<p>"We'll get away," said I. "No more after to-night." I raved
against witches and warlocks. "What have I seen?" I was angry
with the young man. "Why did you show me what I shall never be
able to forget?"</p>

<p>"Jannat holds me here," he sobbed, silly and beaten from his
manhood.</p>

<p>"Jannot! After you've seen her as you saw her to-night?" Yet I
could not wonder at the boy. I felt something of the same
bewitchment over my own dulled senses. "There's David to think
of." I tried to steady myself by this concern about the sick boy.
"If that was Doctor Fletcher whom we saw...?"</p>

<p>"Who do you think it would be?" snarled Garrie. His eyes were
shining from the strong spirit, there was a hectic red in his
cheeks and his lips were drawn back from his teeth, making him
look like a lean young mastiff.</p>

<p>I had no thought then but getting him and myself away from the
place, but I still had David on my conscience. I had been feed to
teach his mind, as I had said, and not to look after his body,
much less his soul. But he was another human being, and after the
last few hours I had begun to believe in eternal damnation. Those
two words and the thoughts they evoked blew over me like an icy
wind.</p>

<p>We crawled feebly up the large cold stone stairs to the sick
boy's room. The door was ajar and the watchlight was burning on
the table by his bed; the fire had sunk down, the strong wind
down the chimney was stirring the already cold ashes.</p>

<p>I did not know what light it was that fell between the
shutters that stood partially open, whether the light of dawn or
moon or chill rays from some other world.</p>

<p>The boy was seated on his bed with a sage-coloured cloak about
his shoulders, and his face, damp with sweat, was like that of an
old man in this unearthly light that filled the chamber.</p>

<p>The serving-man was there, but asleep, his head overcast on
his arms upon the table. The coarse tallow candles had guttered
out on his uncombed hair, his locks and the winding tallow both
fell over the table.</p>

<p>"Well, Evan," whispered the boy, leaning forward so that his
cloak and shirt fell apart and showed his thin chest, on which I
could count the ribs, "what did you see tonight? Tom Maitland! He
went with you, too, and he had a taste of their quality!"</p>

<p>I did not know if he was one of them, although I feared as
much. And I had no answer ready, nor could I understand the mind
or mood of Evan, who stood there at the foot of the bed staring
at the sick man. Was he, young Evan, trying to save the soul of
David? Or were they companions, almost accomplices, in all this
satanic vileness?</p>

<p>I felt as if I, too, like young Evan, stood on the
borderland.</p>

<p>And then all our high thoughts and resolutions, tremulous,
half-formed, were scattered by a noisy clangor and thunder on the
gates.</p>

<p>The sick boy shrieked, drawing his knees up under his heavy
coverlet. Even the weary manservant, responsive to that loud
command, rose yawning and groaning, pushing the hair, stained
with the tallow, out of his bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie fell to his knees, thinking no doubt this was a
summons from Hell. But for me it cleared my mind, and I was
Thomas Maitland again, the ruined gentleman who had been hired as
a pedagogue for this pale withered heir to a Scots lord.</p>

<p>"Who's master here when Sir Donald's away?" I said. I looked
at David, then at Evan. Neither was able to answer me, so I told
the serving-man to go down to the door and rouse the house and
see who it was without. It might be Sir Donald's return, it might
be Captain Graham and his troop, it might be the Covenanters on a
witch-hunt.</p>

<p>My faculties were sharpened above the common by the horrors I
had seen and the strong drink I had taken, yet I cared nothing to
what might befall. I knew that these days there might be a danger
in opening the gates of Castle Drum in its master's absence. What
did I know of the broils of this petty kingdom? It might be that
enemies without were coming to slit all our throats, but what did
I care for that? The place was drenched in horror for me. Could I
have seen Elspeth, Jannot and Isabelle speared as they stood I
should not have blanched.</p>

<p>The sick boy gathered up his serge cloak to his shoulders and
again shrieked with fear. And I shouted back at him and put my
hand on my sword; Evan Garrie caught at my arm, and so we stood,
the three of us, while the serving-man stared, asking me to
repeat my orders, for he seemed to look on me as the master.</p>

<p>I told him to go downstairs and to see who was outside, for
someone had passed the outer gate and was now belabouring the
inner door.</p>

<p>I peered from the window that I pushed open and there was the
light of a pine-knot torch below; the moon had long since
disappeared and the sky was black above us. A drizzle of rain was
falling, I felt it as I put out my hand, and I wondered if this
pure moisture from Heaven had scattered those hideous, swarming
shapes inside the ruined walls of the chapel. And I thought, too,
that if I could not stop my memory of this night, one day I
should go mad and gibbering or imbecile as Doctor Fletcher must
be in his unholy dotage.</p>

<p>We went downstairs together, I feeling again some confidence
in my youth and strength, and even Evan Garrie having thrown off
something of his bewitchment, and the servants were roused now
and stood together while two of them lifted the latch of the
great door.</p>

<p>Without was no warlock or devil and no shouting Covenanter
saint, but Captain Graham of Claverhouse on his famous sorrel
horse. His elegance was something marred, he had lost his hat and
his long curls were dark with sweat and rain and dust.</p>

<p>He asked where Sir Donald Garrie was as he threw himself from
the saddle and came with slow dignity up the few steps into the
great hall.</p>

<p>I told him that the Lord of Castle Drum was still away at St.
Andrews. And then John Graham told me, quietly as when we had met
that day in St. James's and he had mentioned glory, that he had
been outwitted by the rebels, as he termed them, who were
gathering in their hundreds on the moors and had outstripped his
dragoons. And he added, drawing off his gloves, pulling them
finger by finger, that he had pursued a hundred rebels for a
week, but that they had escaped, being much protected by the
farmers and gentlefolk.</p>

<p>And he said with his cool smile: "You have none hiding here? I
recall that this was Mr. Cameron's retreat. He is a dangerous and
obstinate fanatic."</p>

<p>He was much disturbed beneath his show of equanimity, I was
well convinced. And he and his misfortune&mdash;a strange one,
surely, for him and his troop to be defeated by these fanatics
and their followers&mdash;seemed to me to blend into the horror
that was that night.</p>

<p>The weary soldier would not sleep but came and sat in the
great hall where they had all the candles they could find lit and
the fire piled up and set aflare. He would not take off more of
his equipment than his gauntlets and his boots. And there he sat
in those changing and flickering lights as first one candle and
then another guttered in the strong draughts.</p>

<p>Nor would he speak of his defeat, for he had set his heart on
capturing these men, but presently towards the dawn he withdrew
himself from his moody abstraction and asked for paper and a
quill. And I brought down the equipment from my chamber, for I
had not much used it since I had come to Castle Drum&mdash;the
sand-dish and quills that I had used in London and brought with
some contempt to this outlandish place.</p>

<p>He thanked me with grave courtesy, his dark eyes were heavy
with fatigue, and I admired the air with which he put off his
humiliation.</p>

<p>"Next time," he said to me with a smile, "we shall see who is
the stronger. They killed two of my troopers and burned the home
of a woman who gave us directions."</p>

<p>"You will have troops from London, sir, perhaps," said I.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "I hope to raise sufficient men of my own. I
must enlarge my own troop. What are sixty men to quiet the
Lowlands?"</p>

<p>He would say no more nor would he take any wine. He was always
an abstemious man, and he had no interest in cards or in
wantonness or in drink, but only in this idea that he kept fixed
before him, of glory, or rather, as he would term it, of loyalty.
"The King's Service" were words often on his lips, but I knew
that he tried to win an heiress, titles, and castles for
himself.</p>

<p>And I thought again of the circle in the water as I watched
him bending to his task, which was that of writing to his
Commander in Glasgow of his complete failure. These rude,
untrained rebels, these fierce Covenanters, had killed many of
his men and escaped, and he had counted, I well knew, on clearing
the Lowlands at once and on the reward he might have for
that.</p>

<p>He said when he had finished his letter that he was so sleepy
he could scarce keep his eyes open. And he asked me why I sat
awake all night. And I told him bluntly that I did not like
Castle Drum, and I said: "I'd rather be out with yon Covenanters
on the heather, rebels as they may be, than shut up here."</p>

<p>His eyes, dim with fatigue, flashed at that; he seemed to know
what I meant, for he asked me where the ladies were. And I said
bitterly: "I suppose in their chambers."</p>

<p>I added I had a charge I did not like, and I was reminded to
return to London and go to Holland to seek out Mr. William
Penn.</p>

<p>"For I'll be free," said I, "of this country, ay, and of
England too. Here is no chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you seek glory?" asked Captain Graham, sharply. I used
words that I had never used before, nor thought to use.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I hope to save my soul."</p>

<p>John Graham made little disguise of his contempt of me, who, a
man of stalwart habit and body, was in the foolish position of
pedagogue to a sick boy instead of being a trooper. He wanted
soldiers.</p>

<p>And when he had slept an hour or so on the settle in the room
where he had written his letter&mdash;he had refused the use of
one of the bedchambers offered him by Evan Garrie&mdash;he turned
to me on his waking, and trying to conceal his scorn, endeavoured
to persuade me to join his dragoons, as his troop of mounted
infantry was termed.</p>

<p>He said that he would probably have permission to raise
another hundred men. For the whole of the Lowlands, all at least
of Wigtown and Dumfries, were likely to be armed; there was talk
of having the Highlanders down, but he did not greatly care to
lead these wild men.</p>

<p>I do not know how much he was aware of my story; he must at
least have remembered me as a gentleman of position whom he had
met in the corridors of St. James's Palace. Why I was ruined and
why I was here was probably no concern of his. But I noted the
firmness with which he kept to his own point, to get men with
which to pursue the Covenanters. And I realized his pride, which
was sharp and keen. He had been entrusted with this work by the
Government, in particular by his patron, the Duke of York, and it
was odd to think that that same man was the friend and patron of
Mr. William Penn. And he, John Graham of Claverhouse, wished to
quieten the Lowlands without calling for help from England.</p>

<p>Therefore I was to him but as was a means to his end. I had no
need to flatter him, and I looked at him straightly as I
replied:</p>

<p>"Why are you giving so much to this work, Captain Graham? You
are a man of a substantial fortune, a good position. Why do you
not enjoy yourself in tranquillity?"</p>

<p>"This is my enjoyment," said he coldly, "to do my duty as I
perceive it, to serve my loyalty as I see it. Come, will you ride
with me?"</p>

<p>"It is bloody work you do," said I. "I have heard enough tales
since I've been in Castle Drum."</p>

<p>He gave me a contemptuous glance.</p>

<p>"You have been listening to the wild ravings of Richard
Cameron. If I could catch that errant mischief-maker I should be
very glad to silence him. But as well chase a squib of
wildfire."</p>

<p>"Have you warrants," I asked, "to kill all whom you will?"</p>

<p>"I have warrant to shoot at sight those who refuse to take the
Test," replied Captain Graham, still controlling his anger at
what, no doubt, he considered my impertinence, for he hoped to
enlist me, as I was a likely man for a trooper. "These are
rebels," he added in a high tone. "Do you not understand?"</p>

<p>"Do you greatly care," said I, "about the Test or not, Captain
Graham? Do you greatly care about this fine question of theology
and the Covenant and what it means or does not mean, and whether
its presence justifies His Majesty in breaking his oath?"</p>

<p>"I do not question where I obey."</p>

<p>Captain Graham rose. I saw him as a man who was strained
almost to the limit of his endurance, fatigued, and chagrined; he
was shorter than I, with long arms, very dark, with melancholy
eyes.</p>

<p>"Next time," he said, taking up his soft tasselled gloves, "we
will not be defeated. And I take it, Mr. Maitland, that you will
not join my troop of dragoons?"</p>

<p>"No," said I, "I intend to be free of Scotland and Scotland's
troubles. I'm taking with me young Evan Garrie."</p>

<p>"That's a pity," said Claverhouse. He used no oath, being, as
I said, in his language as in his habit both abstemious. "It is a
pity," he repeated, but he gave the womanish word a deadly edge.
"Two strong young men&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But neither," said I, breaking into his speech, "inclined to
fight with you, Captain Graham. I came here, as I think it, on
false pretences. At least, I don't intend to be shut in Castle
Drum with three crazy ladies and a sick stripling. Besides, my
fancy has changed. I'll be no more a pedagogue."</p>

<p>"What will you do?" he asked, still, I could see, with a hope
of gaining me. "Why do you take the young man away? I had hopes
of him. It sickens me to the soul to see a likely youth lead a
life of idleness. Or is it possible," added Captain Graham,
shrewdly, drawing his fine brows together above his beautiful,
dreamy eyes, "that you are, both of you, tainted with this
Presbyterianism?"</p>

<p>"You can scarcely suspect me of that," said I, "since I am new
come from London."</p>

<p>"As I remember, in London you were a friend of William Penn,
who is suspected by some of Nonconformist doctrines."</p>

<p>"You've taken little trouble to study the beliefs of those
whom you've been sent to exterminate, Captain Graham, if you
confuse the tenets of Covenanters with those of William Penn.
What will you do now?" I asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Ride into Glasgow," he replied, "and there make my report. Do
not fear that I shall return soon."</p>

<p>"It's ungrateful and unpleasant work, this of yours, policing
the Lowlands," I said. "But it matters little to me." Then, to
exasperate him, for I never liked the man, I said: "Will you give
us an escort of troopers, for I intend to ride to St. Andrews to
see Sir Donald Garrie, to tell him that we will neither of us
remain in Castle Drum. We have our reasons which, if pressed, we
will explain to Sir Donald himself.'</p>

<p>"Why," asked Captain Graham, giving me hostility for
hostility, "should you demand an escort for so peaceful an
expedition?"</p>

<p>"We are but two men, we intend to take no servants, having
none of our own and not wishing to deprive the ladies," said I,
with irony, "of their protection. And we go through the country
that is, as I believe, infested by these rebels. We may be taken
for two of your troopers."</p>

<p>I had intended these remarks but to vex him, and I was
surprised when he answered gravely:</p>

<p>"It is true that my troopers are murdered when they go far
from their fellows. Even the women set on them and beat them with
stones. But I can do nothing for you, Mr. Maitland. Young Evan
Garrie must know the countryside. You had better take the less
frequented ways. Do not wear buff coats, cuirass, or sash, try to
appear ordinary travellers, and no doubt you will not be
molested."</p>

<p>I felt rebuked by his kindness and courtesy, though it was
sternly offered. And as the ladies did not appear (well I knew
why), I assumed the post of master of the house, saying that I
was acting for the sick lad David, and did what I could for the
entertainment and solace of Captain Graham and his dragoons; the
great castle had the means to refresh them all.</p>

<p>In the ill-kept yard was a standing pool, and when the
troopers were ready to ride away I took a stone and threw it into
this stagnant water and bade John Graham, who then had one foot
in the stirrup, to mark the circles that it made.</p>

<p>"Glory!" I said. "The circle in the water!"</p>

<p>He gave me a sharp, unkind look. He took my meaning, being
quick and alert in mind. But I could not avoid sending it home. I
said:</p>

<p>"Captain Graham, what is this glory for which you would give
your life and the life of so many others? Do you not pause in
your ridings to and fro and in those severities that make these
stern people think you are helped by Satan, to consider how soon
fame is gone? Look," said I, "the last circle has dissolved and
the pool is calm again as if the stone had never been."</p>

<p>"A man may leave a name behind," he said, "for after
generations to wonder at."</p>

<p>"And shall he for that," I demanded, "give his sweet life,
which is all he has?"</p>

<p>"I would rather," replied the proud soldier, "die in my youth
in pursuit of this glory that you despise, than live long and
safely, to die at length the death of a dog, utterly."</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>The troop was gone; there was a pale sunshine in the air,
flickered by a chill wind. I saw the gleams of their cuirasses,
the soft white plumes that the officers wore, and for a moment I
regretted that I was not of their company and of his mind who led
them.</p>

<p>But I had resolved that my way should not be of blood and
slaughter. What I had seen last night had shaken my spirit.
Hallucinations they might be, delusions from some fierce potent
they had put into my wine, but it mattered little whether it was
a dream or reality on which I had gazed, for it was proof,
intangible maybe, but proof that evil was about me, that evil was
possible, and might take on these tormenting and disastrous forms
to torture mankind.</p>

<p>As I was turning back into the Castle, having seen the last of
the troop and watched the clumsy and sullen serving-men close the
door, I drew back a step and sent my foot into the soiled water
into which I had thrown the stone, for there, standing in the
doorway, was a black man, whom I could not doubt was he whom I
had seen in the-ruins of the chapel the night before.</p>

<p>The Devil, no other, I had thought him then. But this man was
a blackamoor, such a creature had I often seen in London, a slave
employed as a servant in gaudy feather and turban, though the
young negroes were more favoured by the ladies for their
prettiness and docility.</p>

<p>This man looked sick and melancholy and could not have been, I
soon decided, the shape that I had seen last night. Ike was not
of such vast stature, either, being about my own height and
breadth. He was ragged and his eyes, brown with the muddy white
injected with blood, turned on me with an appealing look.</p>

<p>He spoke a few words of English and tried to make me
understand his history. How he had crept into the courtyard I do
not know, it must have been while we were all occupied with the
departure of Captain Graham's troop.</p>

<p>Seeing the terrified and malicious looks that the servants
cast on him, I took him into the house. I wondered where the
ladies of Castle Drum were now, and whether they would be glad to
see this fellow.</p>

<p>I certainly had my suspicions of him. It was strange that he
should appear so pat on the obscene rites of yesterday had he not
been a partaker in them. The poor wretch, for such he seemed at
least to be, was glad to get to the fire and warm his limbs.</p>

<p>His story as I could piece it together was that he had been a
slave in Edinburgh, in the 'Nether Bow.' He had worked in a
goldsmith's shop and been most ill-treated. His master had
brought him from London, and apart from the poor food and the
blows he received from his owner's virago of a wife, he had
endured great torment from the cold. This I could well believe,
for I had seen the wretched creatures in England; the black boys
seldom survived their first winter but would pine and wither like
those outlandish flowers some gardeners affect when first nipped
by our native frosts.</p>

<p>I asked the man why he had come to Castle Drum, and he replied
that it was the first great house he had passed. He had not dared
to show himself, for he knew that the people would stone him
wherever he went; even in Edinburgh he had been looked at
askance. Well he understood the meaning of these injuries and
insults; the blackamoor was aware that he was considered a demon,
an attendant in the train of the Prince of Darkness. This much he
had learned during his four years in Scotland.</p>

<p>I asked him how he had lived and his grin answered me; he had
stolen such poor food as had kept him alive. I was in the mood
for a grim jest and to avenge myself on all those whom I disliked
in Castle Drum, so I told the man, slowly&mdash;and he was
quick-witted like most creatures in extremity&mdash;that I would
for a while at least, take him into my service and offer him my
protection. I was aware that I could not afford to buy him from
his master, and until I could produce his purchase price he would
be the property of the goldsmith in the "Nether Bow." And yet I
thought it little likely, the times being as they were in
Scotland, that he would be traced to me. Even in the north there
were several blackamoors employed. They were brought into Leith
from the Netherlands and Germany; some of the hardy ones survived
the climate for many years, so the sight of them in cities and
towns was not so frightening to the populace. One blackamoor,
too, as I argued to myself, looked as much like another as one
sheep resembled his fellow in the flock.</p>

<p>The creatures were, too, as I knew, faithful, and this one was
powerful in stature with mighty arms and hands. So I took the
blackamoor as my servant or slave, and I thought that he would be
no ill companion if I and Evan Garrie were to ride over the
rebellious country to St. Andrews. For I remained resolute to
that loyalty, that I would let Sir Donald Garrie know that I was
leaving his service and that the three women of his family were
alone with the sick boy in Castle Drum. No consideration that I
could think of would have induced me to remain in that lonely
place, and neither would any consideration have induced me to
abandon my task without at least an explanation.</p>

<p>Besides, practical reasons impinged upon these lofty resolves.
I was almost without money, the last sale of my effects had
brought in but a few pounds, and these I had almost spent. The
residue of my possessions, a few jewels and such comfortable
vanities as the velvet cloak, I was not minded to part with. And
only, I knew, by going to St. Andrews, should I get my fee from
Sir Donald; these women would give me nothing.</p>

<p>It was Jannot who entered the room first. I wondered if she
knew that I had spied upon her last night, or that shape that had
her face. It was difficult to look at her with composure, but I
was pleased to see the recoil she gave when she noticed the black
man standing by the hearth.</p>

<p>"This is my new servant," I said, with an air as if I had
conjured the creature out of the stone flags at my feet. And I
was bewildered by her bewilderment. "This looks," I thought, "as
if the black man was present last night. Perhaps it was this poor
wretch huddled in the ruins for some manner of shelter. Yet the
creature that had affrighted me and Evan Garrie had seemed
gigantic and had a different countenance."</p>

<p>"He is a runaway slave from Edinburgh," I told her,
scornfully. "His name is Virgil, and I'll keep that, for it suits
me well. The ignorant used to think that Virgil was a warlock
because he showed Dante, the Italian poet, over Hell."</p>

<p>By this Madam Jannot had recovered her spirits. She came
mincingly to the table where our breakfast had been set, and I
asked her how it was she had slept so sound that she had not
heard the arrival and departure of Captain Graham and his troop
of horse?</p>

<p>She replied insolently enough:</p>

<p>"Why, I heard them, Mr. Maitland, and so did Isabelle and
Elspeth. But we had no thought to come down and entertain these
rude men at night."</p>

<p>While she spoke and as she sat over her oat-cakes I could see
her eyeing the black man with wonder, and, I thought,
apprehension.</p>

<p>The other two women came down presently, and she went to meet
them and whispered to them in the doorway. And I could see the
three of them throwing looks at the blackamoor who they allowed,
however, to continue kneeling by the hearth, bidding him throw on
the billets of wood from the great basket that stood there, when
the flames sunk low. They permitted me, too, to order a plate of
meat and bread for the fellow and for him to eat it and in their
presence, for I was not minded to let the blackamoor out of my
sight for fear some of the Scots should do him a mischief.</p>

<p>"Everyone will think he is an evil spirit, or Satan himself,"
said Isabelle.</p>

<p>I looked straightly into her yellow eyes. I wondered if she
knew how I had spent my night.</p>

<p>The three women accepted sullenly my decision to go to St.
Andrews and seek out Sir Donald. They admitted themselves that he
had been away a long time, and it was a good while since they had
received even a message from him.</p>

<p>I did not tell them of my designs to leave their service,
feeling sure they would raise outcries, especially if they knew
that I was taking away, and for ever, as I hoped, Evan Garrie
from the circle of their spells and enchantment.</p>

<p>I thought, at the last, that I should not have my way with
this. The youth became restless and was minded to hang back; I
saw Jannot signalling to him with her eyes and even with her
fingers as she moved quickly to and fro on her lap, inviting him,
no doubt, to more of these hellish cantrips, as they termed them,
that I had witnessed on the night before.</p>

<p>But at length I got the boy away, and the women not suspecting
that we were escaping for ever, provided us with a bag of meal
and a plate whereon to cook it, a flask of spirit, and a portion
of salt. They allowed young Evan Garrie, too, to take arms from
the arsenal that I had observed on the ground floor. I had my own
sword that I had brought with me from England, and I had taken
Captain Graham's warning not to wear a steel cuirass, a flash of
which, even, from a distance, might cause me to be taken for a
soldier.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie had a small target, or shield, that he hung on the
saddle in front of him and a Scottish dagger, or dirk, as he
termed it, that was finely set with the native yellow stones that
they call cairngorms.</p>

<p>Jannot also gave me some money to pay my fees at the inns
where we must stay. I thought it was no more than my due, and put
it in the long purse of knitted purple silk; the coins within
were, I found, golden Jacobuses of one of the old Scottish kings
that had been hoarded, I know not how long, in the coffers and
closets of Castle Drum. But I doubted not that in that rude
country they would be glad enough to take the gold without
concerning themselves with its antiquity.</p>

<p>About Virgil, the blackamoor, the ladies had made no comment
whatsoever. Either they believed that I had evoked an attendant
spirit&mdash;and this is what I intended them to believe&mdash;or
they credited the tale that Virgil was a runaway slave, or they
thought that he was some demon of their own creation. At least,
and this was the important point, they saw him provided with
clothes such as their own servants wore&mdash;homespun coat and
breeches and stockings and rawhide shoes, a shawl like a
checkerboard in black and white. They armed him, too, and Elspeth
said:</p>

<p>"I am glad you have this protection of the blackamoor's. We
have no men that we can spare."</p>

<p>"You are not likely to be attacked," said I, "in Castle Drum.
Nor are the rebels so bold," I added mockingly, "that they would
dare to undertake a gentleman of the provision and substance of
Sir Donald Garrie."</p>

<p>But I knew that it was not the rebels rising against the
Government that the ladies of Castle Drum were frightened of, but
the country-side roused in a witch-hunt by the preaching of one
of the Covenantering saints such as Richard Cameron.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>So we left them, on the fifteenth day of October, as I can
recall it. It was winter to me, there was no cloud in the sky
that was colourless as a pearl; the landscape lay rich beneath
it, dark purple and faded gold of quiet distance and dry heather
and crackling, tawny ferns.</p>

<p>The ladies of Castle Drum stood on the old battlements to see
us depart. Elspeth was wearing the yellow satin dress, I wondered
if she had worn it at the revels of the night before; it seemed
that Jannot had given up the dispute for it. She, whose face
looked heavy with fatigue and whose air now that she saw us
determined to depart was dull and lifeless, wore a grey gown and
mantle like one of the serving wenches But Isabelle who still
sought to please me and hoped, I think, to gain me in the end,
was robed brightly in her silken garment, and the universal
pallor of the light caught this in little brilliant gleams and
lingered too in the heavy bands of her hair as she watched us
depart.</p>

<p>I had to keep my hand on the bridle of Evan Garrie's horse,
for I thought even at the last moment he would turn back, and I
called out to the blackamoor to take the animal on the other
side. And I cried out to Evan Garrie: "Do not look back!" for I
did not know what tricks they might not play on him.</p>

<p>Yet I could not subdue my own curiosity. Before we were out of
eyeshot I had turned in the saddle and stared at Castle Drum.</p>

<p>What had I expected to see? Perhaps a pale flame leaping
heavenward where those dark walls had been, perhaps a dream
palace, such a fabric as we build in our half-waking hours
wherein to enshrine our dearest, most unobtainable hopes. A dream
palace, windows with fair faces looking, beckoning us to
unimaginable delight?</p>

<p>But however strong the arts of the three ladies, they had not
transformed their dwelling-place for our destruction. Grim and
cold the dark walls uprose against that pale sky, the groves of
leafless trees were of man's planting, and built by human hands
were the stained arches of the ruined chapel through which the
daylight shone, wan and delicate.</p>

<p>"Those women are not witches," said I, contemptuously, "nor
linked with any great powers. Let them be, sir, you'll forget
them at the first fresh face you see."</p>

<p>Evan Garrie did not reply, he seemed downcast and aloof as we
rode together down the rough road. But presently he brought his
horse close up to mine and, moving his head sideways, looked
without speaking at the blackamoor. This fellow was riding humbly
a place or two behind. He looked at me as a slave or a dog should
at his master; I had had as yet no instructions to give him, but
I did not doubt that he would obey the first I should issue.</p>

<p>I noticed, with a smile, how eagerly he handled his weapon. I
suppose he never had been armed before, and I believed that he
would, as was his place, die for me willingly. And I intended, at
our first halt, to show him how to fire the musket that I had
made Elspeth Garrie give him.</p>

<p>But young Evan Garrie was plainly uneasy and soon he whispered
his doubts into my ear. What could the blackamoor be but the
familiar spirit of the ladies of Castle Drum? What could it all
be but a trick?</p>

<p>"Were you not too credulous, Mr. Maitland, to take in so
easily so strange an attendant?" He sank his voice yet lower and
added: "Remember what we saw last night in the ruins of the
chapel!"</p>

<p>I smiled, yet wryly. The thought had come to me also.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>The way was lonely now, no human creature, no human habitation
was in sight on either hand, behind where Castle Drum had dropped
out of sight, nor ahead where as yet no other building had come
into view. The sky had darkened, fleeces of grey cloud obscured
the pale light that first shone upon our desolate way. A bird of
prey hovered overhead. This was Evan Garrie's native country, but
even he seemed oppressed by the dull gloom of the scene, and the
high spirits with which I had left Castle Drum had somewhat left
me.</p>

<p>I glanced over my shoulder at the humble blackamoor following
up; uncouth and rude he looked in those unaccustomed garments,
the grey of the North, worn and ill-fitting, sat clumsily upon
his Eastern strength and grace. Strange, indeed, if we had taken
the Devil for protection, if we had the Foul Fiend for company.
How would that adventure end?</p>

<p>I spoke boldly to my young companion, who was, I knew, a brave
man, afraid of nothing mortal but who was now most uneasy in his
mind.</p>

<p>"What we saw last night," I said, "were but the fumes from the
drug they had given us at the supper-table, cannot you forget
them."</p>

<p>Though I spoke roughly, I knew that the visions we had seen in
the chapel would remain long in my memory, and I hoped that I
should never look upon the faces of the ladies of Castle Drum
again.</p>

<p>"Maybe," replied young Evan, sullenly, "but I wish we had not
the blackamoor for company."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE SAINTS</h2>

<p class="first">
I CAN remember but little of that journey except that it grew
with every day more uncomfortable. The roads were worse in
Scotland than any I had seen in England, and became rougher as we
proceeded through Carrick and Ayr towards Fife.</p>

<p>I regretted what I considered now my foolish courtesy in this
journey. Why should I trouble to inform Sir Donald Garrie that I
was leaving his service? What had impelled me to take upon myself
all this trouble? I put these questions once or twice to Evan
Garrie, and he rebuked me for my sullenness and reading me more
clearly than I cared to know of, said:</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Maitland, that you go to St. Andrews really for
your own pleasure, because you are of a wild and adventurous
turn. Because you would, at any price, be away from Castle Drum.
Besides," he added, with his candid smile, "we are fee'd, are we
not?"</p>

<p>He glanced towards the pouch where I kept the golden Jacobi
given me by Jannot Garrie.</p>

<p>Virgil, the blackamoor, was a good servant to both of us, and
any mistrust that young Garrie may hare had of him was soon
dispelled by the poor creature's devotion and strength, that was
always at our service. It was easier for Evan than it was for me
to talk with the blackamoor because what Christian language he
knew was broad Scotch, and he was almost incomprehensible, but we
did, somehow, between the two of us, contrive to communicate with
him.</p>

<p>And as we rode ever further into the winter, as it seemed to
me, across that bleak and colourless landscape, Evan Garrie told
me something more of the state of affairs in Scotland than I had
ever known before. Had I better employment I had not listened to
him, but I can recall now how he, occupied like all his
countrymen in these matters of Church and State that to me were
so barren, talked to me of Test Act and Covenant.</p>

<p>The Test Act, it seemed, was not put on yet in Scotland,
though we had had it five years or more in England. It was my
Lord Shaftesbury who had got it put through Parliament; it had
been directed against the Roman Catholics and the Duke of York,
though it was operated against the Dissenters also. I had heard a
good deal of it from Mr. William Penn, who considered it unjust
and unlawful that all who held public office had to receive the
Church of England sacrament and renounce transubstantiation.</p>

<p>"They'll put the Test on here," said Evan Garrie, "and how
many men, do you think, will be shot for refusing to take
it?"</p>

<p>I little knew or cared. I was trying to think out my own
fortunes and my own future and gave but distracted attention to
the young man's talk. From what I had seen of him in Castle Drum
he had not seemed so interested in these affairs. But it seemed,
when it came to it, that every Scot seemed bitten to the bone
with this fanatic interest in Church and State.</p>

<p>Although he was not a Covenanter, young Evan was most
indignant that the Covenant had been burned by the public hangman
in London.</p>

<p>"That was many years ago," said I, "I can scarce remember it.
And was it not condemned also by your Privy Council as an
unlawful oath? And those ministers who maintained it
ejected?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Evan Garrie, "and it is these same outed
Ministers who have held conventicles on the hill-side ever
since."</p>

<p>And he reminded me that it was in that same year that the
Abjuration Oath had been brought in, by which all the Scots were
to declare that the Oath of the Covenant was unlawful.</p>

<p>"The King had betrayed them, you see," said Evan Garrie,
though without passion. "Little I care one way or another, though
these hard matters have been hammered into my head since I was a
child. But the King took the Covenant as the price of Scotland's
help, and as soon as he had come into his own again he betrayed
it. As did Doctor James Sharp, the man whom we are about to
visit, who received as his prize the archbishopric."</p>

<p>And then Evan Garrie, as I recall and not for the first time,
reminded me that my name was held in odium in Scotland, and it
would be well to conceal wherever we stayed that I was a relation
of His Grace of Lauderdale, who more than others was blamed for
the suppressing of the liberties of Scotland and who was
considered to have great influence over the King and to have
induced His Majesty to persecute the Covenanters.</p>

<p>At the first town we stayed, I do not recall its name, the
people were agog with the news that Captain Graham had been made
Sheriff-Deputy of Dumfries and Wigtown, or was about to be made
so, I forget which, and that he had raised another troop of horse
which was to be under the command of the Earl of Airlie. That
made three troops, for there were already two&mdash;one under
Lord Hulme and one under Colonel Graham, as he now was to be.
Lord Linlithgow, too, we heard, was to be commander-in-chief in
Scotland, and a great campaign against the conventicles and the
Covenanters was to be begun in Dumfries and Galloway, all to be
forced to take the abjuration oath or taken prisoner.</p>

<p>"Well, Evan Garrie," said I, "here is your chance. Think well,
again, whether you will not turn back and enlist in Captain
Graham's troop."</p>

<p>"No," said he, "though the fumes of this dispute sometimes
rise to my brain, yet on the whole I care little for them. And if
you will have me, as a guide and companion, or a secretary, or
even a servant ..."</p>

<p>"None of which I can afford," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll come with you just for the luck of the road,
whatever it may be. I'll get free of Scotland. And Scotland,"
added the young man gloomily, lowering his voice, "means Jannot
Garrie."</p>

<p>"Are you still thinking of her!" I was contemptuous of his
fidelity. I would not have cared to admit that I dreamt too often
of Castle Drum and the ladies there, at night when we wrapped
ourselves in our cloaks and used our saddles for our pillows,
sheltering behind rocks or in some deserted shepherd's hut. These
dreams would rise out of my exhausted sleep, like noisome fumes
from stagnant poisons, and turning sharply on my side I would
think that I saw the stained face of Jannot or Isabelle lying
beside me on my hard pillow. Cowardly, too, was that remembrance
of Doctor Fletcher, and I puzzled myself if it had been the man's
phantasm or the man himself that we had seen in the ruins of the
chapel. Had his body kept watch by the boy while his spirit had
wandered among the ruins to attend the obscene rites held by the
witches?</p>

<p>One night, I recall, my fancies crowded on me blackly and I
woke young Evan Garrie and made him speak to me in the dark. We
had taken shelter in a small, ruined building, a roofless cottage
that yet afforded some protection in the angle of the stone
walls. The night was bleak and the wind harsh and there was no
sparkle of heavenly light above us, the thick clouds covered the
stars and there was no moon. But I had liked the look of this
shelter better than the inn where we might have stayed, that was
kept by villainous folk&mdash;at least, if their appearance was
warrant for them.</p>

<p>Here we seemed safer with our weapons to our hand and our
horses ready, tethered to an old ash tree that grew near the
ruined hearth, and with Virgil, the blackamoor, on guard for
us.</p>

<p>We had each an inch or two of candle that we had set in a horn
lantern to light us for our meal, we had bought some food and
eaten it with relish, and now I could not sleep. I had loosened
my cravat for all the cold winds, and thrown back my cloak for
all our exposed position, for something seemed to choke and
stifle me.</p>

<p>And I roused young Evan Garrie, whom I could not see in the
dark, and bade him tell me something of what he knew of the
witches in Scotland.</p>

<p>He seemed surprised at my question, as if I had asked him
about something too common for speech.</p>

<p>"This is a dreary country," said I, "where the summer is but a
gleam and the winters are long and dreary. You must have many
moors and mountains here unknown to human inhabitants."</p>

<p>"Well," said Evan Garrie in a whisper, "I'll not deny that
there are many outposts of Hell, and that is the opinion of a
sober man. There's no ford that has not its kelpie, and on the
bare hill-side you may find the May moulach."</p>

<p>"But these," said I, "are elves and fairies; I've read of them
in England. I thought I would like to be like Thomas the Rhymer
and wander away to some of those islands you have in the west, in
the train of the Queen of Fairyland. She should have hair as
yellow as the corn and plaited with lilies of unearthly
beauty."</p>

<p>"That's the poet's talk," replied Evan Garrie, and I thought
that his voice was uneasy. "You find such fancies in the ballads
and songs the people have, I've sung them myself in the evenings
at Castle Drum to the harp, and I doubt the fairies. I think they
are but the ministers of Satan."</p>

<p>"What of the fairy gold?"</p>

<p>"They've bought many an unhappy soul with that, and within an
hour it is dust in the hand."</p>

<p>Then Evan Garrie told me how, ever since the days of John
Knox, the Presbyterian and black Genevans had set out to combat
the fairies and the Devil in Scotland. Was it not John Knox who
had forced Queen Mary to publish a statute bringing in the
penalty of death for witchcraft?</p>

<p>"How may you tell a witch?" asked I, curiously.</p>

<p>"It may be anyone," answered Evan Garrie, glancing uneasily
through the dark, "a fair young maiden or an old hioldame, a
great noble or a mean peasant. Have you heard of the lamias,
those are female devils who take the likeness of fair women?
There are human brides, too, who marry demons."</p>

<p>"One may no doubt all this, I suppose?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If you are a Christian you may no doubt it," replied Evan
Garrie. "Is there not the Witch of Endor, and Simon Magus? And
what is the holy command 'Thou shalt not suffer a witch to
live'!"</p>

<p>The young man told me, as if it was a plain matter of fact,
that there were organizations of witches all over the country,
that His late Majesty King James I of Great Britain had well
known, for had he not spent the greater part of his life
endeavouring to combat witches and warlocks and black magic?</p>

<p>I asked what these witches could do and how far their powers
extended?</p>

<p>"For even after what we saw in the ruined church," said I, "I
take it to be but delusion of the senses."</p>

<p>He did not deign to reply to this, he did not think that my
words were truthful. And he told me that the witches could raise
storms, troops of ghosts and apparitions, and that they went to
ruined churches and churchyards at night to dance with the
Devil.</p>

<p>And he added that he knew for a certainty from what Mr.
Richard Cameron had told him, that the Covenanters were pledged
together to abolish witchcraft, the Devil, and all his legions
from Scotland, and that they firmly believed that their
persecutors, as they named them, such as Colonel Graham and
Archbishop Sharp and my relation, the Duke of Lauderdale, were in
league with his Satanic Majesty and protected by his diabolical
arts.</p>

<p>More than this, that was a confusion of dark and doubtful
sayings, some of them fit for old wives' tales in the chimney
corner of a winter's night, some of them such as would be used to
frighten fractious children, did Evan Garrie tell me as he sat in
the corner of the ruined cottage that stormy night.</p>

<p>My mind was troubled and doubtful, I knew that he who spoke to
me believed these matters, as did nearly all of his countrymen.
And I had seen for myself enough horror to cause me to think
sharply before I said I did not believe the wild and curious
tales.</p>

<p>I remembered Doctor Fletcher and his experiments in the tower,
I remembered what I had learnt in my youth when I had been a
pupil of Thomas Vaughan in London. And I was weighed down by a
heaviness, partly thoughtfulness and partly dreaming, while Evan
Garrie, in an awesome tone, reminded me of the commissions that
had been set up in Scotland in the last few years for the
suppression of witchcraft and the numbers of men and women who
had been tortured, strangled and burnt for this offence. And I
had a horrid twinge at the heart as I thought of the three women
of Castle Drum. I remembered how Isabelle had looked at me.</p>

<p>"It is my duty, I think," said I, "to warn Sir Donald when I
get to St. Andrews, of the danger those women stand in. Whatever
are their tricks or cantrips, as you name them, they are in
danger, it is clear, from the Covenanters."</p>

<p>And then from the dark I heard the young man say sullenly:</p>

<p>"I wish they would burn Castle Drum and all who are in it, and
then maybe I might be in peace."</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>We did not sleep that night, but sat up until the slow
reluctant dawn, talking to one another. Virgil kept guard,
refusing to sleep even though we were awake, over the open
door.</p>

<p>I wondered who had lived in that hut, had he perhaps been
dragged out with his wife and children about him, offered the
Oath and been shot because he had refused to take it?</p>

<p>With the morning we were on our way again. A dreary rain was
falling. We had kept the horses we had taken from Castle Drum,
and this made our progress slow because we had to pause so often
to rest them. Yet even with all the care we had given them, the
beasts were now becoming weary, and, like ourselves, splashed
with mud, so that we three, riding slowly along the bad roads
through the rain, made no splendid picture of well-attended
gentlemen but appeared rather like travelling merchants of the
meaner sort, with the poor blackamoor in his sodden grey behind
us.</p>

<p>We had not gone far that morning before we fell in with a
troop of men who came up rapidly from the mist and challenged
us.</p>

<p>I knew them at once to be Presbyterians for their grim aspect
and plain clothing. One of them wore the garments that I had
noticed were affected by Mr. Richard Cameron, Genevan black and
lank beneath the russet cloak. His companions were armed men with
muskets in their hands, and I saw them look with mingled fear and
fury at poor Virgil, so that I cried out quickly:</p>

<p>"Friends, that is an escaped slave and a baptised soul?"</p>

<p>I made this statement, not knowing if it were true or not, for
I had not been able to discover from the blackamoor if he were a
Christian.</p>

<p>At that, respecting perhaps my air of authority, the men put
down their muskets, but sullenly, and rode up either side of us
as if we were prisoners, and asked us our business.</p>

<p>They did not like my English accent any more than they liked
Virgil's black face. Perhaps, too, they took amiss my swarthy
visage, which no doubt looked grim enough in the shadow of my
leaf hat dripping with moisture.</p>

<p>I thought it best to speak to them boldly, so I said:</p>

<p>"Sirs, I am an Englishman, and neither one of Colonel Graham's
troopers, nor a warlock, nor a Highlander sent for your
destruction."</p>

<p>He who appeared to be the leader then asked me what was my
name and business. The first I thought it prudent not to give. I
said that I was the pedagogue in Castle Drum. At those two last
words I saw them exchange sidelong looks.</p>

<p>"I did not like my employment," I said, "and therefore I left
it. I am going abroad, but first I have a duty to perform. And
that is to take a message to Sir Donald Garrie in St.
Andrews."</p>

<p>If they had not liked the words 'Castle Drum,' they liked
those of 'St. Andrews' less. I heard them talking among
themselves. And Evan Garrie whispered to me not to mention the
name of the Archbishop, who was the most loathed man in Scotland,
being even more feared and hated than my relative, His Grace of
Lauderdale.</p>

<p>"What matter for that?" I replied under my breath. "No doubt
they know where Sir Donald Garrie lodges in St. Andrews."</p>

<p>I thought they were like to murder us where we stood. They
stopped the horses and two of them kept guard over us, their
blunderbusses ready, while the others conferred a little way
apart.</p>

<p>I looked at the blackamoor, his eyes were rolling in his head;
I saw that he and Evan Garrie were willing to make a fight for
it. But we were outnumbered, perhaps ten to one.</p>

<p>I laughed suddenly, for it seemed to me a foolish way to die
after what my life had been, what I hoped it would be. And I
remembered Philippa. Was it possible that the same earth could
contain her and the scene where we were now? I remembered, too,
the three ladies&mdash;Elspeth, Jannot, and Isabelle&mdash;of
Castle Drum. It all seemed to me a confusion and ridiculous.</p>

<p>And I turned to those men who were so seriously discussing our
fate, and said:</p>

<p>"Why do you stay here to talk of bloodshed, for I think that
you intend to kill us."</p>

<p>The leader then rode up to me and asked me what I meant.</p>

<p>He spoke seriously, and his aspect, though stern, was not
ruffianly.</p>

<p>"I mean this," said I, looking at him through the driving mist
and rain. "There are other countries in the world besides
Scotland where a man might be free. Have you not heard of those
who sailed to the Americas in the <i>Mayflower</i>? Do you not
know that there are Protestants living quietly in the
Netherlands?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "Richard Cameron has gone there."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said I, "I might meet him. It was his place that
I took in Castle Drum. And I am going to The Hague."</p>

<p>"For what purpose?" asked the Covenanter quickly.</p>

<p>"For that, I do not know. I think to find my friend, William
Penn, and to go with him, if the matter can be arranged, to the
New World."</p>

<p>And then I asked them why they did not do the same, instead of
remaining in this infested country, planning vengeance on their
persecutors, slaughtering and being slaughtered, tormenting and
being tormented, they did not go with Mr. Penn and build up a new
city in hope.</p>

<p>And I reminded them that the persecuted and the helpless had
in every age imagined the promised land a golden city, a
Utopia.</p>

<p>"And why do not you, who are young and stalwart," said I,
"endeavour to attain it?"</p>

<p>They had not, I think, been spoken to thus before. The matter
and the manner a little surprised them, and they puzzled a little
over my English accent. But I think they were impressed with my
sincerity, for what I spoke I spoke truthfully. My own life had
been faulty, even evil, but I was minded in that moment, and had
been for some while, to end it, and all these feuds, done in the
name of Christ, God of Love, confused and sickened me.</p>

<p>"Our homes are here," said the leader of the men, still
looking at me earnestly; "we are pledged to root out the Devil
from Scotland and to overthrow the rule of that base perjured man
Charles Stuart."</p>

<p>Evan Garrie then told him that he spoke treason, and added in
friendly warning that such words were dangerous.</p>

<p>"For," said he, "I come from Dumfries, and in there, and
Wigtown, they are raising more troops every week, and it is
intended to put down the Conventicles and the outed ministers by
sword and fire. John Graham has fuller powers now."</p>

<p>The Covenanters seemed to think these bold words from one who
was in their power, and peered again at young Evan Garrie, at me,
and at the negro. Then the leader of them said:</p>

<p>"My name is David Harston of Raphillet, I have estates near
here, and I think you are honest men, even if you speak foolishly
of what concerns you not. For you," he turned to me, "you are an
Englishman and have no concern in these matters. For you," and he
spoke to Evan Garrie, "I think you are one of those who blow
neither hot nor cold. You'll not ride with Claverhouse nor fight
with us. Well, be on your way." He spoke to the man beside him,
and said: "This friend of mine, James Balfour, will go with you
and see you safely across the moor."</p>

<p>"Are we likely to be stopped by other rebels," said I, using
the word deliberately, "those who will fire at us, maybe, without
stopping to question?"</p>

<p>He did not answer, but looked at me gloomily. I cannot
reproduce his rough and strange speech, but the substance of his
emphatic talk was clear enough to me. I saw that I could not move
him from his purpose, and desolation fell upon my spirit. The
scene was so gloomy, the moor, the rain, the low sky, these
dark-faced men with their stern purpose, blood as I was sure it
was, their muskets ready to their hand, their faces intently
peering through the wet vapours. What a fool I had been to
endeavour to persuade them to go abroad and walk the world
elsewhere. How useless it would be, even if they went they would
carry their bitternesses, their quarrels, their dissensions, with
them!</p>

<p>So we went on our way with Mr. James Balfour as our surly
guide. After a while he said he would turn back, for we were
almost within sight of St. Andrews.</p>

<p>I asked him of the name of the place where we had crossed, and
he said that it was known as Magus Moor.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>Within an hour or so we reached the city of St. Andrews,
entering it by an old gate that was much chained. The mist
cleared about this hour and showed us the noble city standing
upon a rocky promontory above the bay. We passed through streets
of noble houses, antique and dignified, and the ruins of a
magnificent cathedral that had been destroyed, Evan Garrie told
me, by the fury of the followers of John Knox, the true founder.
I recalled that grim old man was himself suspected of being a
warlock, for had he not taken to himself in his extreme old age a
fair and noble young wife? and how else save by magic had he won
her?</p>

<p>In St. Andrews city had been martyred several of these
reformers, and there too had been murdered Cardinal Beaton, who
was minister to Mary, Queen of Scotland. And everywhere we looked
were ruined churches, convents, or monasteries, I know not what,
but at least fragments of popish architecture with roofless
aisles and broken arches.</p>

<p>Asking our way from some of the passers-by, who stared with
suspicion, for by now we looked uncouth and rough enough, we were
directed to the residence of Doctor Sharp, who did not live in
the castle on the cliff but in a smaller though still magnificent
house in the city.</p>

<p>The interior of this mansion was furnished in a fair fashion,
and we were courteously received, so that in a while, when I had
been able to repair my garments in a comfortable chamber that was
set at my disposal, all that had passed seemed but a wild dream,
for I had returned now to the manner of life to which I had been
used in England.</p>

<p>Doctor Sharp had about him all the appointments and service
that I had been accustomed to in the houses of those people whom
I had known before I came to Scotland.</p>

<p>And so, having, as it were, returned to that life, I could not
believe in the phantoms I thought I had seen that night in the
ruined chapel. Nay, I could scarcely believe in the existence of
the ladies of Castle Drum, or in the wild tales that Evan Garrie
had told me in the corner of the ruined cottage two or three
nights ago. It was difficult even to credit those wild figures
who had accosted us on Magus Moor, whom I had, in a moment of
madness, as it now seemed to me, endeavoured to persuade to join
Mr. Penn in his fanatic attempt to find a New World.</p>

<p>What need of a New World? Why, all was fair here. The house
was warm and pleasantly perfumed, the servants were lightfooted
and in comely liveries, there was fine meat and good French wine
on the table. No trace of savage Scotland here. I noticed that
Evan Garrie seemed uneasy, almost uncomfortable, and that he
looked uncouth and rustic among these luxurious surroundings.</p>

<p>But I was once more Tom Maitland, who had not cut so poor a
figure in St. James's and on the Mall.</p>

<p>Doctor Sharp was agreeable, but seemed, I thought, weak, for
beneath his courtesies that he dispensed very amiably, was a
certain hesitancy, an irritability that seemed to indicate a man
not sure of himself.</p>

<p>However, he played the host very graciously and presented me
to his daughter, Marjorie I think the name was, who kept house
for him I understood.</p>

<p>I discovered the reason why Sir Donald Garrie had tarried so
long in St. Andrews was because he had been ill with a quinzy.
Why he had not written was also clear, why we had not received
the letters. He had made several attempts to send messengers, but
none of these had got more than part of the way. They had all
come back, saying that the countryside was in a state of f revolt
and it was not safe to endeavour to push through to Castle
Drum.</p>

<p>After our experiences of James Balfour and David Harston and
their troop, I could believe Sir Donald.</p>

<p>He expressed some marvel that we had succeeded in gaining St.
Andrews without being molested, and I told him of the care we had
taken on our journey and that Evan Garrie had a fair knowledge of
the by-roads. He asked us if we had come upon any Conventicles or
outed ministers gathering their flocks about them in the haunts
of the fox and the eagle?</p>

<p>And I replied no, we had met none but a few men on the moors
outside the town. But I did not give the names of these,
disdaining to betray their sufferance by delivering them to their
persecutors.</p>

<p>Sir Donald, like his host, the Archbishop, was a peevish man.
I could see that he was trying hard to get himself a place in the
Government. Like all the rest, like all of us, perhaps, for I
should include myself in the same category, he wanted rewards,
honours, safety, some manner of earldom for himself.</p>

<p>And I looked at him, a man past his prime, with a wonder at
the vileness of humanity. While this dotard was cringing upon the
great prelate in St. Andrews, what were his two daughters doing,
or his sick heir? They were in the charge of that man Fletcher,
whom I took at best to be but a charlatan and at worse to be,
perhaps, a minister of Satan himself.</p>

<p>So absorbed was he in his own affairs and so brought down by
the sickness that had nearly choked him, Sir Donald did not at
first recall how strange it was that I should be there, nor ask
me my errand. And it was after we had supped and had our wine,
elegantly enough, and we had laughed over poor Virgil, who had
been taken to the servants' quarters to be fed and clothed, that
suddenly he looked at me across the table and said:</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Maitland, you are my son's pedagogue. How is it you
have left Castle Drum?"</p>

<p>I had been waiting for that question, and I had so many
answers ready that I knew not which to offer first. I gave a
sidelong glance at Evan Garrie, who looked back steadily at me. I
meant to say to him 'This is the moment to defy the enchantment,'
and he meant to say 'Speak on, I am ready.'</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "speaking in the presence of His Grace, here, I
did not like my employment in Castle Drum, and if I were in your
place, Sir Donald, I would hasten back as soon as you may get a
troop of horse to the protection of your castle."</p>

<p>"Is it likely," cried he, half rising in his chair, "to be
assailed by these bloody devils, murderous Covenanters, as they
call themselves? Greatly do I regret," he added, quickly, without
giving me time to speak, "that ever I harboured Richard Cameron,
who was like a viper on my hearth, and yet I never knew it, for
he played the gentle saint."</p>

<p>"I think he is a gentle saint," said I, "and maybe he kept
much evil from your house."</p>

<p>Sir Donald did not like these words nor their inclination. He
looked at Doctor Sharp, who sat at the head of his table,
indifferent, I think, to all of us, yet listening, as an uneasy,
nervous man will, for sounds that were not there. I had seen that
his house was very well guarded, I had been told that he wore
chainmail under his priestly robes, that he endured all the
torments of a man who goes in fear of assassination; more than
once there had been an attempt on his life.</p>

<p>I think that Sir Donald had taken something of my meaning, for
he said:</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, Mr. Maitland, for taking this long, and,
as I fear, dangerous journey, to warn me that Castle Drum is in
peril. I am glad to have had news of my ladies and to be able to
send them back messages by you, for I think that you have taken
an unnecessary fatigue. The Castle's well guarded, I must have
over two hundred able-bodied serving-men, and an arsenal of arms
there."</p>

<p>"I'm not talking," said I, "of worldly perils. Castle Drum has
inmates more dangerous to its safety than the attacks of
Covenanters."</p>

<p>I know not what he made of these dark words, but he began to
play Sir Hector with me, saying in a bullying tone: "I took you
from London, Mr. Maitland, as a ruined gambler who chanced to be
a fine scholar, and, as I thought, an honest gentleman. I took
you because you came of my Lord of Lauderdale's family."</p>

<p>"No reason why how you took me," I said, "I'll not be your
son's pedagogue nor your daughters' guardian."</p>

<p>I gave him a look that pierced through his evasions and took
from my pocket the packet of gold that Jannot Garrie had given
me.</p>

<p>"This is what is left of my fee, some of it is spent on my
journey. But little, we only bought food and bait for the horses
and slept for the most in our cloaks by the wayside. Here is
what's left of Castle Drum's gold, Sir Donald. I intend to go
abroad."</p>

<p>Doctor Sharp was now looking a little amazed at this scene,
which must have been unlike any he had seen at his elegant table.
He looked at me, to Evan, and then to Sir Donald. Being prudent,
he asked nothing of what the matter was.</p>

<p>Sir Donald turned to him with a bow, as if excusing this
uncouthness, then to me, and said, almost with a whimper:</p>

<p>"It was difficult to get anyone to teach a sick boy."</p>

<p>"Ay, and your two wayward daughters," said I, rising. "We've
done our part now."</p>

<p>"Your part!" said Sir Donald. "Why are you taking with you my
young kinsman, Evan Garrie?"</p>

<p>"Why should he stay in Castle Drum in idleness? He's too old
for a page," said I, "and does not wish to be a serving-man."</p>

<p>"Well, let him go as a trooper. Colonel Graham is raising more
men," said the Archbishop. "We want more soldiers to protect us
from these accursed rebels."</p>

<p>"I've no mind for that, Your Grace," Evan Garrie spoke for
himself. "I think to go abroad with Mr. Maitland, here. I've
lived roughly too long here."</p>

<p>"Go home, sir," said I, "and find out why we left." Then I
thanked His Grace for his hospitality, and I begged that he would
give us a room for the night and that we would be gone early in
the morning. The horses were not ours, and we were prepared to go
on foot, we intended to make our way to the nearest port, if not
from St. Andrews Bay&mdash;and so across the wintry seas to the
Low Countries. "Why," cried Sir Donald, "have you come so far to
tell me this? Why did not you go straight on your adventures from
Castle Drum?"</p>

<p>"You reminded me but now," said I, "that I am a gentleman,
albeit a ruined one, and I wished to let you know my intentions.
Now you can understand that there is no one in authority there at
your castle save your sick son and Doctor Fletcher." I could
scarce avoid retching at the name, I remembered that figure I had
seen in the chapel ruins. "Your patron, His Grace here, and your
friend, Colonel Graham, can protect Castle Drum."</p>

<p>Sir Donald made no more demur. I think he realized something
of what lay behind my words, he must have had some glimmer of the
reputation his ladies held. For all I knew he was a warlock
himself, that was certainly the reputation of Doctor Sharp.</p>

<p>After that we were silent over our wine. His Grace was very
courteous, and after a while began to give us good advice. He did
not disagree with our design of going to the Netherlands, where
he said many good and able men were gathered.</p>

<p>"And it was as well," he added shrewdly, "to have a foot in
each camp, for His Highness of Orange was in the position of
heir-apparent to the throne of England, and was well known to be
in secret chief of the opposition to His Grace of York." Some
even thought that he encouraged these rebellious Covenanters, but
that Doctor Sharp did not credit. Being one who always spoke
well, I think, of all the great ones of the earth, he had much
praise for the young Stadtholder, and even offered us, being
gentlemen of position, letters of introduction to His
Highness.</p>

<p>I said we would take these, although I did not think we should
be able to use them. We were really penniless adventurers, and
had but a small pouch of silver between us.</p>

<p>Sir Donald, frowning and uneasy, said that I must take my fee
for the few weeks I had been at Castle Drum, and I said that I
would take whatever he chose to give me, not being in a position
to show pride nor dignity.</p>

<p>So the matter was settled, something to the convenience and
comfort of us all. And we spent a night on feather beds between
fair linen, and rose in the morning much refreshed.</p>

<p>His Grace insisted on sending serving-men with us to the port,
where we might get a ship to Leith, and advised us not to
encumber ourselves with the poor blackamoor. This last I would
not listen to; I had taken an affection to Virgil and Evan Garrie
did not object to his company.</p>

<p>Sir Donald took me aside before we left the Archbishop's house
next morning and asked me, in a tone that I think was unnaturally
controlled, what was my real reason for leaving Castle Drum? He
said that I had mentioned his wayward daughters and demanded in
what way they had offended me?</p>

<p>"Offended!" I cried. "What am I, a poor pedagogue, to use such
a word! I have had my lesson, sir, and lived a wild life. I shall
not now risk offence by advising another man's women. And my
advice is this, Sir Donald, return as fast as you may to Castle
Drum and give an eye as to what is taking place there."</p>

<p>I saw that he did not care to press me further, but was most
uneasy. And he muttered with regret:</p>

<p>"I thought if I had an Englishman it would be different. I
believed a foreigner would suit."</p>

<p>His Grace asked us if we would not delay while he got other
letters from His Grace of Lauderdale and other relatives of mine,
who might also supply us with money and necessities.</p>

<p>But we were both of us impatient to be out of the country,
where we saw nothing ahead but blood and revolution. And I think
in the breast of each was a little hope that we might come upon
some peace or pleasure that till now had seemed impossible to
us.</p>

<p>Young Evan, whom I had rescued from Jannot Garrie, felt, I
believe, a lightened spirit such as had been unknown to him
before. His face looked younger, less lined and harassed than
when he had been in Castle Drum, and the strained look had gone
from his eyes, his mouth was less grim.</p>

<p>I felt I had been a benefactor to the poor lad, I might have
soothed my pride by saying the same of poor Virgil, whose cheeks
had fattened, whose eyes were less bloodshot, whose gait was less
slouching. He had been treated kindly at the Archbishop's
establishment, for the servants had come from Edinburgh and
London and were used to negroes, and did not consider them all
limbs of Satan.</p>

<p>We were, on the whole, well treated by these two gentlemen on
whom we had broken so rudely and for one of whom at least I had
brought an ungracious message. A certain amount of money I
accepted, a further sum Sir Donald gave to his young kinsman,
Evan. The negro was provided with a decent livery, and they
importuned us until we accepted horses to take us to the
port.</p>

<p>It was a day of thick mist when we left the shores of Scotland
in the Cross Keys. The passage to Holland was slow and tedious;
we encountered several gales of wind. Both I and Evan Garrie felt
queasy in the stomach and the poor blackamoor was ill, groaning
his soul out in the cabin.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; WISE YOUNG PRINCE</h2>

<p class="first">
THE sun shone fairly though out of a misted sky when we
arrived on the shores of the Lowlands, and when we reached The
Hague the snow was thick on the ground and the canals frozen. It
was difficult to make Evan Garrie believe that this country was
in the same world as Scotland; I agreed with him most heartily as
to the sharp differences between the two countries.</p>

<p>We lodged modestly and in a most clean place, and finding
William Penn in The Hague we waited upon him soon after our
arrival.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie had seen nothing but his native country and his
native customs, and he continued to be greatly astonished at the
place in which he found himself. Perhaps there could be few
contrasts more complete than that between Scotland and the
Lowlands at the time of which I am writing, when I paid my first
visit there after my horrid experiences in Castle Drum.</p>

<p>The winter was severe but the houses so comfortable and well
warmed that we did not feel the rigours of it, while the
ever-encroaching sea damp was checked by so many good housewifely
arts that there was neither unsightliness from tarnish nor
discomfort from chill.</p>

<p>The States General had signed the peace in the same year in
which I reached The Hague, and there was still signs of warlike
activity in the beautiful town, many soldiers about the streets
and many men returning to civil occupations after having been for
years under arms.</p>

<p>There was a quiet pride about this people that I could not but
admire, for they had begun this war six years ago in desperation
to defend themselves from the wanton aggression of France and
from the heroism of their young Stadtholder only and from their
own dogged determination not to lose their freedom had they
survived.</p>

<p>I have heard the Dutch spoken of with contempt and the country
referred to as the 'vomit of the sea' and the 'valiant
sand-bank,' and there was much about these people that was not
sympathetic to one of my temperament.</p>

<p>But for all that I was obliged to allow them noble and
splendid qualities. Everything they did was done well, their arts
and crafts were admirable, and I soon perceived that they had
been the first in many-inventions.</p>

<p>There was a dignity most pleasing to the eye in this
town&mdash;for it was no more than that though the seat of
government; indeed, I believe it held the status of a
village&mdash;with the flat-fronted patrician houses rising
either side the canals planted in comely fashion with wych-elms
and lime trees, all now prettily outlined with sparkling frost.
There were many skaters on the frozen waters and on the great
lake of the Yverberg that lay in front of the ancient Hall of the
Knights that was surrounded by more modern buildings, now the
seat of the Government and the Stadtholder's Palace. Swans graced
the lakes in milder weather, but now these were taken into
shelter for the winter, that was as bleak as the climate as that
of Scotland, as I have said. Ceaseless low clouds blew up from
the dunes and from the open sea that lay but an easy ride away 4
through old pleasant woods of tall trees; the land was so flat
that all was at the mercy of the winds.</p>

<p>All here was civilized to the highest point of civilization
that I had ever seen. The people were patrician in temperament,
elegant in their accomplishments, fond of music, of painting and
of games of skill; good equestrians too, and fine judges of both
dogs and horses. It was surprising in a country that had been
fighting for bare existence for years, all odds against it, that
there should be so much tranquillity, and, as far as I could see,
so much luxury.</p>

<p>My introductions gave me the entry into several houses where
the names of Doctor Sharp, the Duke of Lauderdale, and Sir Donald
Garrie were known. Some of these were the mansions of noblemen,
where one might expect magnificence, but others belonged to men
who were no more than merchants and knew the Scots through
trading with them. But even in these houses I found much elegance
and even extravagance.</p>

<p>The Dutch had long been trading with the East, and it was to
my eye, long cheated of beauty and comeliness, a great pleasure
to gaze on these rich pieces of furniture, lacquer, gilt, and
inlaid, these vases of enamel and of fine porcelain set so
precisely against the walls painted a pale pea-green colour in
these stately mirrored chambers with the glass-fronted cabinets
filled with porcelain.</p>

<p>Mr. Penn could not immediately receive us, he was, indeed, in
attendance on the Stadtholder. We heard that through the agency
of Dr. Gilbert Burnet, who gave himself the air of a personage,
he had had an introduction to the Prince of Orange from the Duke
of York, his patron, and that he was entrusted with some
half-secret mission from one prince to another; some proposal, it
was said, about the abolition of the Test.</p>

<p>But we amused our leisure well enough; all that defeated us
was lack of means, we could not ruffle it very bravely when we
had to count every penny in our pouches. But my clothes were
good, Evan Garrie was much of my height and my wardrobe served to
give us both a decent appearance. The livery that Dr. Sharp had
fitted out poor Virgil looked very well, and against this
background of The Hague no one here remarked on the blackamoor,
for most of the people kept a slave, or even more, and these
negroes might be seen in attendance on the sledges that passed
along the canals, finely painted with gay carnival scenes and
adorned with the heads of swans and peacocks, with furred ladies
within and drawn either by ponies, servants, or these lusty
blackamoors.</p>

<p>I liked this life, so ordered, so aristocratic; it cleared my
mind of many fumes and fancies, and after no more than a few
weeks of it I had found it difficult to believe that I had ever
witnessed that scene in the chapel ruins or ever seen Jannot
Garrie's stained face turn and look at me as I hastened away from
those wicked enchantments. Impossible to believe that such
abominations ever took place while moving in these cool airs,
this atmosphere of dignity and common sense.</p>

<p>I could not but admire the Dutch for their toleration, so
vivid a contrast to the bloody debates in Scotland. Here were no
jarring dissensions, no talk of persecuting a man for his faith.
The religion of the Dutch was that of John Calvin, but they
seemed to have wrought that stern faith into a gentler form than
that it was given in Scotland, and though their ministers were
grave enough in their black and white bands, though their
religious observances were severely kept, I saw nothing of those
grim furies and black hatreds that animated the Covenanters.</p>

<p>Their churches were pleasant, the large Romish buildings had
long since been stripped of all ornaments and white-washed out
with painful care. The brightly-coloured glass was gone from all
the higher windows and the clear cold daylight fell through the
water-green panes on to interiors that were, with their green
serge curtains and plain pews, more like meeting-houses than
churches.</p>

<p>But here even the taste and luxury of this wealthy people
showed, for they had magnificent tombs in alabaster for their
heroes and not a church that I went into during my residence in
the Low Country lacked a superb organ, played on by skilled
musicians and garnished with gilt figures of angels for the pipes
and fine paintings for the panels.</p>

<p>In one sense of the word neither Evan Garrie nor myself could
feel a stranger at The Hague, there were so many English and
Scots there&mdash;refugees and adventurers&mdash;more the first
than the last, because rogues and scoundrels were not encouraged
by His Highness, and those who lived by vice found it difficult
to make a livelihood there among people cool, prudent, and
decorous.</p>

<p>Many worthy and pious men were there, who had fled from
persecution or ill-treatment or the threat of injustice that had
been offered them in their native countries.</p>

<p>There were Germans there who had come to offer their services
to the Stadtholder in their various provinces of science and art;
there were a number of Jews, for this was one of the few
countries in the world where the Jews were not persecuted.
Amsterdam, I knew well, was the headquarters of the powerful Jew
bankers and great trading houses, and although this superb city
was always antagonistic to the House of Orange, yet the Prince
was on good terms with many of these Jews, and I have seen them
going to and fro the streets of The Hague in their furred gowns
and their high caps with their servants behind them and their
secretaries with portfolios under their arms.</p>

<p>I was told that much of the money that His Highness had spent
on his long war with France from which he had emerged, if' not
victorious at least safe, and that was a triumph considering the
might of France, had been produced by the Jews.</p>

<p>Here were many of the extreme Scots Covenanters, including, I
heard, Mr. Richard Cameron. Strange to think that I should meet
him in this place, so different from Castle Drum. I heard from
another Scot, whom I met at an Ordinary, of this preacher's
residence at The Hague, but for some time I did not see him.</p>

<p>I noticed other Scots, however, some of them known to Evan
Garrie; it was not clear to me if they were on peaceful purposes
of trade or because they had fled from political storms. There
were several English people of distinction also, and I surmised
that they had come to learn from his own mouth the future plans
of the Prince of Orange, who, as the husband of the heiress to
the throne of Great Britain, was of increasing importance to
English politics, and had a great reputation as a wise
statesman.</p>

<p>All these people were allowed to live as they would,
practising their several faiths. There was a chapel where the
Scots might meet and pray in peace, there was a church for those
who followed the English Communion; Papists, too, were welcome as
long as they did not meddle with others; there were Freethinkers
also, and philosophers, various clubs and organizations existed
in The Hague for the entertainment and support of these
foreigners.</p>

<p>You may believe that with all these activities and all these
strangers, the place was full of life and movement. The British
Resident, Sir William Temple, and his wife&mdash;the lively and
gracious Lady Dorothy&mdash;were continually receiving visitors
from England, and many of these stayed for several months, hiring
expensive houses in the Voor hourt, where there was always a
press of handsome carriages.</p>

<p>I did not wait on Sir William. I did not suppose that my name
would be more popular in The Hague than in Scotland. I knew that
my powerful relative, the Duke of Lauderdale, for whom I had not
any great respect myself, was not a man to be held in esteem by
the Prince of Orange or the Dutch people. Nor had I any good
reason for approaching His Highness. I did not want a troop of
horse, I had no excuse to ask for a pension, I had no news to
give him, no offer of service to make.</p>

<p>For the same reason, after my first impulse to seek the man
out had passed, I made no endeavour to approach Mr. Penn, whom I
saw on several occasions going about the streets in his plain
grey coat and flat hat that he did not take off even in the
presence of the King, walking as was his wont, quickly, as if he
had a mighty business in hand, his full, pleasant features
clouded by an anxious look, talking loudly in his thick sweet
voice.</p>

<p>I pointed him out once as he hastened along the footway to
Evan Garrie:</p>

<p>"That is the man," said I, "who is going to found a new
world."</p>

<p>And as I spoke old regrets tugged at my heartstrings. And
another man's dreams haunted me again.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie was disappointed in the appearance of Mr. Penn. He
said that he looked an ordinary enough man, scarce a gentleman,
too stolid and temperate, like an overfed clerk.</p>

<p>"It is the strange dress he affects," said I. "They call
themselves Friends, the vulgar term them Quakers, for they are
supposed to fall into tremulous fits when they receive divine
inspiration. And it may be, young Evan, that they know the truth
of it, and in following them we may find peace."</p>

<p>And the fit came upon me and I endeavoured to persuade the
boy, as I had tried once before when we were in Scotland, that we
should leave all these broils, attach ourselves to Mr. Penn and
offer him&mdash;not our fortune, for we had none&mdash;but the
strength of our hands, brains, and sense, and help him found in
that faraway country a new world and to build a city of brotherly
love.</p>

<p>"It is a fair climate," said I, although I knew but little of
the place; "there are wide streams, lush pastures, and mighty
trees, magnificent beasts. And is there not in every man's mind a
longing to start afresh on the virgin soil, cut down the timber
to build his own house, to raise his roof-tree by his own
labour?"</p>

<p>And I reminded Evan Garrie of the Pilgrim Fathers, as they
termed them, who had sailed to New England fifty-years ago, yet
from what reports I had heard of them I was bound to add, they
had fallen into nothing but broils among themselves ever since,
being transported too far in zeal and overgiven to disputes on
doctrinal points.</p>

<p>"Well, the tale I've heard," confided Evan Garrie, lowering
his voice and looking round apprehensively, as if he was not safe
from old terrors even here, "is that they took witches with them
and that it was the witches who blew up these quarrels. Besides,
there were Indians, the murdering savages. How does your Mr. Penn
intend to deal with them?"</p>

<p>"By brotherly love," I quoted. "He means to buy the land from
them on honest terms, to smoke the pipe of peace with them, to
offer them his friendship and love."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll not go, Mr. Maitland, will you? And neither
shall I! I suppose," added Evan Garrie with a sigh, "we belong to
this old world, with all its broils and halts and fears.
Sometimes I think, Mr. Maitland," added the boy earnestly, "that
I belong to Scotland. That even here in the Netherlands I hanker
for it. I am smitten with a desire to return."</p>

<p>He made the confession with a mounting colour, for he knew the
pains I had been at to rescue him from Castle Drum and the women
there, and that such an admission as this might well smack of
ingratitude. Of such, indeed, I instantly accused him, and he
told me, shamefacedly, that he regretted his words.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, bitterly, and I could see he was trying to
talk down his own desires, "should I wish to return to a country
so dark and accursed?"</p>

<p>"Dark and accursed, indeed," I agreed, for we had read of the
affairs of Scotland in the news-letters and heard of them from
the other Scots and English whom we had met.</p>

<p>"The country is ill-governed and in a state of rebellion, and
the men who are set over it&mdash;and I do not except my own
relative, His Grace of Lauderdale&mdash;are both greedy, corrupt,
and incapable. Matters are little mended," said I, getting into
my little homily as I stretched my feet out before the
earthenware stove, "by sending busy gallants like Captain John
Graham to play the Constable and to slaughter the saints, as they
term themselves."</p>

<p>We had heard something of this gentleman at The Hague, for he
had been for some years in the service of the Prince of Orange
and had proved himself a capable as well as a brave soldier. But
there had been some trouble, and no one rightly knew the story of
why it was that he had left His Highness' service and returned to
England quickly, though with letters of recommendation to that
Prince's uncle, the Duke of York. There was some story that he
had assisted the Prince at the Battle of St. Neff, mounting His
Highness on his own horse and hoping for great rewards for this;
whereas all he got was a hundred guineas for the price of the
animal he had lent the Prince, and in disdain he had scattered
this money among his stablemen.</p>

<p>There was another tale that he, jealous of an officer who had
received, as he thought, undue preferment, that he had struck
this gentleman and that the Prince had pardoned him this grave
offence that had taken place in the precincts of the Palace, but
had at once dismissed him from his service. Whatever these
stories might be, and they heard them but at the clubs and
coffee-houses at second- and third-hand, it was at least clear
that Captain Graham had acted with much arrogance and spirit; and
he being but a mercenary soldier, this had been ill-stomached by
the Dutch and not tolerated by the Stadtholder, whom I took to be
as proud a prince as any who ever stepped, for all his simplicity
of life and the fact that he was head of a republic.</p>

<p>I know not how long we should have gone on in this lazy life
for, despite all our high talk when we had left Scotland, we made
no effort to obtain adventures but lived in the rooms we had
found in The Hague, comfortable in the little circle of friends
we soon made, avoiding the Court? but going among the
coffee-houses and the clubs, talking to the wits and sages of
many nations who found it wiser to come to this tolerant
country.</p>

<p>And the days passed quickly enough.</p>

<p>I found a <i>salle d'armes</i> where I practised my
swordsmanship and where I taught Evan Garrie the use of more
civilized weapons than the dirk and the targe. I amused myself by
instructing the poor blackamoor, Virgil, in plain English, in
writing a few simple sentences.</p>

<p>And I hired a horse and rode a little through the woods,
towards the wide open sea. I played cards, billiards, and
backgammon, I made the memoranda for my Memoirs. I
talked&mdash;yes, I was not too old to talk&mdash;and ranted a
great deal of the state of the world and the state of my soul,
the history of the past and the enigma of the future, with all
whom I met.</p>

<p>And I heard the opinions and arguments of Doctors of Law,
Doctors of Theology, and Swiss philosophers and Flemish peasants,
of scarred soldiers who had been fighting for six years up and
down the Flanders borders. I spoke with engineers and
moneylenders, both of whom had been important in the last war,
with chemists and architects, none of them very great in their
professions, but keen and able men. I met fanatics, too, who
boiled over with zeal, and found themselves, even here, taken up
to prison.</p>

<p>And still out of all this babble I could not resolve my own
way. What should I be? What should I do? I had been discontented
in Scotland, where I had work to my hand, and I soon became
discontented in the comfortable idleness of The Hague, where I
felt myself but an idle jackanapes.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie seemed to wait on my mood, and that at times
exasperated me, and I would ask the boy roundly why he did not go
to the Prince of Orange and offer his sword? And he said for the
same reason that he had refused to ride with Captain Graham.</p>

<p>Then we would fall laughing, both of the same mind, for we had
no wish to begin such a bloody and useless profession as that of
war, yet I felt ashamed of my lightness and jesting mind.</p>

<p>What, then, should we do? We were young and lusty, both gently
born, though I was better bred, and I wondered if there was not
some scheme of trade whereby I might not make enough money to buy
back my estates in England. But when I thought of England I would
think of Philippa, and decided I would never see my own country
again.</p>

<p>Then I pondered if we might not engage in some merchandise,
and we began to learn the Dutch language for that end. Some of
our indulgent friends offered to give us letters to rich
merchants' houses in Amsterdam. If we had known anything of
seamanship we might have gone on some of their trading vessels
that went to and fro the Indies. But there were many highly
skilled men in the Netherlands to fill these employments.</p>

<p>The winter began to break, even in this cold climate, and the
snow to melt and even the sluggish waters in the canals stirred a
little beneath the thin ice; and we were still without resolve or
employment.</p>

<p>We should have been, at this time, hard put to it for money
had I not&mdash;in a moment of bravado and maybe of
insolence&mdash;written to His Grace of Lauderdale, upbraiding
him for the miserable employment he had gotten me in Castle Drum,
and telling him that it was a disgrace to him to have a cadet of
his house reduced as I was reduced, and, to come closer to the
point, begging him that he would send a draft on one of the banks
at The Hague in my name and for a round sum of money, adding that
a refusal would do him a great deal of wrong.</p>

<p>I made a wager with Evan Garrie that I should get no reply.
But a letter did come, and with it a draft for a sum of money
that exceeded my hopes.</p>

<p>There was also a letter of advice from His Grace, who referred
bitterly to my late misconduct, as he termed it, in London,
saying that I had brought discomfiture, if not disgrace, upon his
house. He added, however, that time enough perhaps had gone by,
and it might be reasonable for me to return to London, where he
would endeavour to find me some post about the Court. "A
sinecure," he added, "for you never had any gift, Tom, save for
your ancient learning. And what use is that to a man of breeding
if it be not joined to other matters?"</p>

<p>I had found this same knowledge of the classics, however, some
use in The Hague, for it was the passport to the company of men
better than myself. I was, though I appeared but an ordinary
gallant, a ruined gentleman of birth and one time of position, a
fair scholar, and I could hold my own with the pedagogues and
savants whom I met at The Hague.</p>

<p>With my Lord of Lauderdale's monies, we paid our expenses
until the spring. When we had made up our minds at last to wait
upon Mr. Penn, he had returned to London. It was voiced that he
would be back in The Hague in a few weeks, so we made this an
excuse to condone our idleness. We would remain there until he
returned and then put before him our plight and see if he was
able to persuade us to join him in his scheme of founding a new
city in a new world.</p>

<p>I think the happiest of the three of us in those days was the
blackamoor, who, well treated in The Hague and given as much
consideration as if he were a Christian, became fat and content,
and certainly did not now look like any imp of Satan, for his
cheeks became round and glistening, his eyes clear, his smile
perpetual and cheerful.</p>

<p>I discovered that he had been fairly well trained by the
goldsmith in the Heatherbow in Edinburgh, he knew how to look
after a gentleman's clothes and weapons, how to prepare food and
how to dress a horse. I taught him some further elegances, and he
became a most useful servant, warmly grateful for the least
kindness and strongly attached both to Evan Garrie and
myself.</p>

<p>It was in the month of April that I, like many a man who has
retreated into a backwater of life, discovered that I was in a
fool's paradise. I had endeavoured like a coward to stand aside
from all the conflicts and storms, and I was idling away my time,
my youth, and my kinsman's money in vain disputes and
arguments.</p>

<p>From this mental sloth and bodily inactivity I was shaken by
an event that to me was dreadful.</p>

<p>As I was walking by the Vyverberg the day that, as I remember,
I first felt the faint warmth of spring in the air, I saw
Philippa coming towards me, the woman whom I did not think I
should ever see again, the woman I did not wish to see again; for
her I had undergone much, and it might have been on a better
account.</p>

<p>She wore a dark-green coloured cloak, that was the first I
noted about her. Why do we observe in strong moments such petty
trivialities? And she was alone, save for a footman in attendance
a few yards behind.</p>

<p>She held in her hand a little travelling mask on a stick and
wore large doeskin gloves with tassels.</p>

<p>I kept my attention on these details, for I wished to persuade
myself that this was Philippa, indeed, and not a fantasy of my
infatuated imagination.</p>

<p>It was she, and she knew me, and stared at me with as much
amaze as I looked at her.</p>

<p>I had often wondered what we should do if we chanced to meet;
that had been my amusement in my midnight hours when I had woken,
wretched almost to madness thinking of her, counting over in my
mind what I had lost when I had lost this lady.</p>

<p>But now that I saw her so unexpectedly and in this strange
place, I stared foolishly. It was she who spoke:</p>

<p>"I did not think to see you ever again. I certainly did not
think to see you here."</p>

<p>I found my voice again, and the words I used did not seem of
my own choosing. I said:</p>

<p>"Do you speak as a friend or as an enemy?"</p>

<p>"You are in your old mood," she replied, "and intend, I see,
to make a debate of everything."</p>

<p>Then she could not let the moment be, but must tarnish it with
feminine duplicity and worldliness, for she added:</p>

<p>"If we are seen talking here they will believe we met in The
Hague by design."</p>

<p>I commended her prudence and was turning away, but she called
after me, one word, slowly spoken:</p>

<p>"Tom!"</p>

<p>I stood still and would not turn, and she came up to me, and
said quickly:</p>

<p>"Do you want to see me again? Do you want to speak to me?"</p>

<p>I remembered the three witch ladies in Castle Drum, why I do
not know. There seemed something of the expression I had noticed
on their faces in the fine-pointed countenance of Philippa
Dean.</p>

<p>Why should I want to speak to her? What could we have to say?
Had there not been arguments and questions enough between me and
this woman? Had she not broken my life in half, leaving me
sullen, discontented, and desolate?</p>

<p>"Is your husband with you?" I asked.</p>

<p>She replied, looking away, that he was, and that he had her
watched closely, seldom letting her out of sight.</p>

<p>"That is his servant following you now, I suppose," I said.
"He will go and report to his master that you were seen talking
to me. And I shall soon be known as Tom Maitland, for whose sake,
no doubt," I added bitterly, "you suffer all this espionage."</p>

<p>She then told me quickly that her husband had come to The
Hague as, he declared, to buy horses, the Prince of Orange having
some magnificent Polish horses in his stables that, now the wars
were over, he was willing to sell. But that this was a mere
excuse and that Sir John had political reasons, like most of
those who came to The Hague for such visits, under various
excuses, to the Stadtholder's Court.</p>

<p>I was so occupied by the fact that this was Philippa and that
we had again, after a not great space of time, met, that I took
little heed of what she said. I was wondering, with my usual
black selfishness, what effect this meeting would have on me and
my destiny and my future.</p>

<p>I had not told Evan Garrie my story, but I knew he had guessed
much of it, and as I watched Philippa hurrying away in her green
cloak with the footman behind her along the edge of the
Vyverberg, I thought I would return to the young Scot and tell
him my tale for the pleasure of having a listener, for I was
stirred from my spruce idleness.</p>

<p>So I went back to our lodgings, hardly noticing the world
about me, full of elation, rage and confusion of spirit, and with
nothing but these words "Philippa is here! I have found Philippa
again!" ringing in my mind, to discover that Evan Garrie was not
alone in the dark, clean room that looked on to the grey water of
the canal.</p>

<p>To my deep chagrin I found Richard Cameron was in his company.
We had not met the Covenanter often when we were in The Hague. He
kept himself much apart among a few chosen followers.</p>

<p>Why he had sought us out now when I wished for Evan Garrie's
company, I could not guess, and I gave him dismal looks. I was so
vexed to see the old man there, babbling of his own, as it seemed
to me, thin and foolish concerns, while I was smitten by the clap
that Fate had given me in this meeting with Philippa, that I sat
apart black and sullen and scarcely heard a sentence that he
spoke.</p>

<p>I had wanted Evan Garrie, who was, as it were, the
whipping-boy for my moods, to myself that night, and to pour out
before him my rage and tribulation at coming face to face with
this woman, who had been at once my joy and my ruin. And there
was the old man, looking to me half starved in his worn gown and
darned starched bands, trying, as I supposed, to persuade Evan
Garrie to return with him to Scotland to join the Covenanters,
even as Captain Graham had endeavoured to make the boy join his
dragoons.</p>

<p>"Why could they not leave the wretch alone?" I thought
bitterly, forgetting in my grim selfishness that I had used Evan
Garrie for my own ends and brought him away with me out of
Scotland, partly, no doubt, as I flattered myself, to save his
soul and his health of body, but partly also that I might have
the solace of his companionship and admiration.</p>

<p>The cold daylight waned and the serving-maid brought in the
candles and still the old man talked.</p>

<p>And I was forced at last to interrupt; I came forward into the
circle of light and, resting my arms on the table, demanded
without much respect what the matter of his discourse was?</p>

<p>Richard Cameron was suddenly silent, but Evan Garrie looked at
me then shrewdly, and I saw that he weighed me up in his mind,
comparing me, perhaps, with Richard Cameron, comparing both of us
with Colonel Graham; wondering, no doubt, where his path lay. And
he said, slowly, and in a gentle tone and in his Scots tongue,
that he had not lost even after so many months abroad, and that I
could never imitate:</p>

<p>"It is true, Mr. Maitland," (he had never lost his formal
manner of addressing me) "that I waste my time here at The Hague
in idleness, and I have told you before that I have a mind to
return to Scotland."</p>

<p>I could not speak for chagrin and disgust, so I took my head
in my hands and listened sullenly while the old man took the
word.</p>

<p>I had to admit that Mr. Cameron spoke in dulcet tones, he had
a soothing and endearing way with him, but much of what he said
to me was but dead theology; what care had I for the dry and
divers ways in which men strove to approach an invisible God?</p>

<p>Yet some of his discourse had warm human colouring and went
directly to the heart.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>"There are persecuted people, who are my people, in Scotland.
They are shooting down those who will not take the Oath against
the Covenant. It is yes or no, and then a bullet in the heart or
brain. Young boys are dying thus, and women too. Wives and
mothers are bereaved. The heather is covered with the blood and
beaten-out brains of the saints."</p>

<p>"It has always been thus," said I, wearily, "Europe has but
come to the end of a long war, and there are further warnings as
to the future. How, either in the public affairs or in the
private lives ofmen, shall there be any peace?"</p>

<p>I thought of Mr. Penn, with his schemes which, as he had told
me in fiery, eager words, were like to fail for lack of funds,
and I laughed aloud in my bitterness at all these confusions that
stumbled the moderate, and gratified, no doubt, the Devil.</p>

<p>"If I cannot save them," Mr. Cameron was saying, "I may die
with them. Blessed be the Lord."</p>

<p>"What use would you be&mdash;an aged, failing man?" asked Evan
Garrie curiously. "In this choppy sea of politics and
persecution?"</p>

<p>"No use with my hands, that is why I come to a strong youth
like you. Why do not you take up the sword for your countrymen
who are persecuted and downtrodden? Well you know&mdash;and you
too, Mr. Maitland&mdash;that Scotland is bitterly misgoverned.
And I intend," said he in quiet tones, "to excommunicate Charles
Stuart and to publish a declaration that he is no longer, by
reason of his perfidy and blasphemy and lewd living, King of
Scotland. And none of my friends will alter or warp from
this."</p>

<p>"That's a bold, and perhaps a dangerous thing to do," said I.
"It is no toy or trifle to thus defy a great King."</p>

<p>The old man's pale eyes turned on me with a tranquil look,
clear as that of a child.</p>

<p>"Well I know it," he replied. "Do you think that I can live at
The Hague in comfort and cowardice while the others suffer? The
glorious power of the Lord has wonderfully risen in me."</p>

<p>He began to recite to me what was happening in Scotland,
naming the arrests in Galloway that was under the heel of Captain
Graham and his regiment of horse, and added solemnly:</p>

<p>"These men, Claverhouse, Dalzell, and others, are under the
protection of the Devil, and they cannot by ordinary human means
be killed. One must have blessed bullets made of silver. This
cool fiend," and I understood that this was his name for Captain
Graham, "is under the direct protection of the Evil One, and not
by mortal means can he be given a stop."</p>

<p>And then, half to humour him, half because I was curious, I
asked:</p>

<p>"And what of Castle Drum and the ladies there?"</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron gave me a look out of his faded eyes, pale from
age and prayer and watching, and answered:</p>

<p>"Where there are witches in Scotland the Covenanters will root
them out. Is it not written 'Thou shalt not suffer a witch to
live'?"</p>

<p>I put out my hand and grasped Evan Garrie's wrist. I thought
perhaps this stem might serve as his cure, if the image of Jannot
was not already withered out of his simple heart. And I said
steadily, looking across the candles that were guttering on their
prickets, at the old man:</p>

<p>"Tell me, sir, you who lived in quality as pedagogue at Castle
Drum, what you think of the three ladies and of the tricks they
play? Give me, too," and I could not forbear a grimace at the
name, "your opinion of Doctor Fletcher."</p>

<p>I saw the old man's face sharpen and wrinkle with the
suspicions that he might not utter. His lids drooped over his
tired eyes as he looked from one to another of us.</p>

<p>"It is some sign of grace," he answered evasively, "to know
evil when you see it. And though I take you, Mr. Maitland, to be
a malignant, perhaps a concealed Papist, no better than a man of
blood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So!" I interrupted, "you know something of the scandals told
of me?"</p>

<p>"Something," said he. "But let that go now. I say, though I
take you to be a violent man and a man of blood, yet I have this
tenderness for you, that I would warn you not to return to Castle
Drum."</p>

<p>"Then you should have more than a tenderness. You should have
thanks&mdash;because I have rescued Mr. Garrie from that accursed
place."</p>

<p>I tried to speak with a light bitterness, but I think that
wonder sunk my tone, for I was thinking of that night that I had
passed in the watch-tower gazing down at the empty space between
the ruined walls of the old chapel, the space that was not empty
long enough.</p>

<p>Then the old man&mdash;I could not deny him sweet and gentle
ways potent to persuade the heart of any man were he not set in
black anger and near despair as I was myself, approached me,
thinking me, I believe, a soul on the brink of Hell, endeavouring
to persuade me to return to Scotland to cast in my lot with the
Covenanters, to help protect the preachers who still gathered
their flocks about them on the hill-side, against the Horse of
Claverhouse, Rosse, Balcarres and Dalzell.</p>

<p>"Do you know who I am, and my story." I cried in a
torment.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron replied again that he had heard somewhat but that
it was no concern of his, and that no matter how lost and
desperate a soul might be there was still chance for it to return
to peace.</p>

<p>And all my mind went cloudy with these conflicting beliefs and
hard sayings and grim dissensions, and I tried to send my
thoughts piercing upwards through these black and twisting
confusions to whatever God there might be enthroned above them
all.</p>

<p>So I withdrew from the circle of candlelight and sat in the
window-place, musing upon Philippa, and the dead man and the live
man who stood between us&mdash;her brother, whom they said I had
killed, and her husband, to whom she had returned, accepting his
charity and his pity sooner than share my blasted name and my
estate forfeited to folly.</p>

<p>Then I tried, dark and selfish as I was, to put myself in
place of the old man&mdash;old not perhaps in years, he was so
frail, I could not tell his age&mdash;and when I turned to look
at him now I saw how bloodless he seemed in the candlelight, how
bent and feeble.</p>

<p>And he was returning from the peace and comfort of the
Netherlands, from the little society where he was admired and
safe in The Hague, to that rude, violent land that I could not
think of without distaste, bold and strong as I boasted myself to
be, to a land not only policed by the dragoons of Captain Graham
but by, as this man firmly believed, the outposts of Hell.</p>

<p>So I leaned towards him and spoke earnestly:</p>

<p>"Sir, will you not remain where you are secure? Must you
venture on your fate with heedless boldness?"</p>

<p>"I go," he answered quickly, and as he turned his face and
hair looked ghostly in the candlelight, "where God directs. And I
had hoped that this young gentleman," he bowed courteously
towards Evan Garrie, "would have accompanied me, forming a guard
and escort."</p>

<p>"You'll not lack those," replied the youth roughly, speaking,
as I supposed, in this manner to disguise his strong feelings.
"Many men will rise from the hill-sides and the heathered plains
to greet you, Mr. Cameron."</p>

<p>"Why so I hope and so I suppose," he agreed, getting to his
feet; his voice was low and fatigued with overmuch speaking.</p>

<p>And I thought of what his fate might be if he fell into the
hands of the Government forces. And I tried, ill-used as I was to
such offices, to persuade him to remain where he would be safe.
And I asked him if he had waited on the Stadtholder and what His
Highness had said as to his return to Scotland.</p>

<p>But Mr. Cameron spoke without enthusiasm of that Prince.</p>

<p>"He is a valiant man," he admitted, "but one who blows too hot
and cold for me. 'Why, he has even Papists among his friends, and
is so much for toleration that I believe he could find it in him
to stomach the Devil himself."</p>

<p>"The Stadtholder is a young man," I replied, "but has always
proved himself a wise one."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do with the wisdom of this world," replied
Mr. Cameron, and Evan Garrie rose and offered his arm to help the
old man to the door, for he seemed exceedingly weak; a poor
wretch to go to that powder-magazine that was Galloway.</p>

<p>"Think on this," I cried, "that you will make more mischief by
returning to Scotland and rousing the Covenanters, as you term
them, against the Government. 'What can it end in but blood, and
more blood!"</p>

<p>"What matter of that," said he, "as long as the Lord is
served? There are many hiding-places on the moors and many good
friends, even among the gentlefolk."</p>

<p>And with that he left us, first pressing the hand of Evan
Garrie and bowing courteously to me. I knew that he was
disappointed, that he had hoped to take the young man with him,
and that he blamed me, probably for his failure to turn the youth
into a fanatic, willing to risk his life in a disaffected country
kept down by Government troops.</p>

<p>And I was sorry and sick for the whole business, and I turned
on Evan Garrie when he came back to the room and cried.</p>

<p>"Why must you have the old fantastic, meddling man here
to-night when I have something of moment to relate to you!"</p>

<p>But even as I spoke I felt with shame my meeting with Philippa
was not so important as the resolution of Richard Cameron to
return to Scotland.</p>

<p>The young man looked at me as if he scarcely understood what I
had said. He was still full of this preacher's words as he
muttered:</p>

<p>"Mr. Cameron is going back to Scotland, to send out a
declaration that defies the authority of the King."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose that will mean but civil war? Ay, and a
war to the end, the extermination of the Scots," said I, "when
men such as Colonel Graham are entrusted with the quieting of the
Lowlands. Why, they'll bring the wild Highlanders on them, and
more, the English troopers. What chance have they, armed peasants
and farmers and a few zealots like Mr. Cameron?"</p>

<p>"They'll be taken, these zealots, at their prayers or
preaching," said Evan Garrie, resting his elbows on the table and
his head in the hands, "and I suppose they'll be hanged and taken
down while they're alive, and quartered, and their limbs will be
set up before the gates of all the market towns in Scotland."</p>

<p>"And who's to blame for that," cried I, "save the rank fools
themselves I His Highness, the Prince of Orange, who is their
champion, has warned them against such fierce madness."</p>

<p>He did not answer me directly, but looking at me straightly
with the golden eyes that reminded me always of Jannot and
Isabelle, demanded:</p>

<p>"What ails you tonight, Mr. Maitland? Something has befallen
you since I saw you earlier in the day. Your manner is wild, your
eyes are strange."</p>

<p>"I have seen," said I, "Philippa Dean, walking by the
Vyverberg."</p>

<p>"Oh," said he, in a confusion, "that lady for whose sake you
are here?"</p>

<p>"You know, I suppose," I answered. "Remote as you've lived,
you must have heard this story. She and I were named together,
and she was married to a jealous man. Her brother came into it,
too, and I met him in a <i>duello</i>. The wound I gave him was
slight, but he died of it afterwards through his own negligence
and the lack of skill of the surgeons. But I was blamed for it,
and there was scandal at the Court. And though I had friends in
high places, they said that if I left the country all would be
forgotten.</p>

<p>"She went back to her husband, out of fear, not wishing to
lose her fame, her estates. And that is all my story, save at the
time when these misfortunes fell on me, I had lost a great deal
of money at the gambling-tables. I wished to give magnificent
presents to the lady I cradled in my heart. And my disaster
coming upon me my blood ran high and I was reckless at the cards.
That is all, though no doubt from other lips you have heard it
also, Evan Garrie."</p>

<p>He seemed impressed with my poor tale, as if there was a
certain high magnificence about it. Yet he looked at me askance,
and I saw that his brains were bewildered from the rapid talk of
Mr. Cameron that was not without its turn of nobility, and my
tale, which no doubt he had heard whispered in the various clubs
that we frequented at The Hague, and his own thoughts which were
largely thoughts of Jannot whom I named, and I have no doubt as
he named, the young witch of Castle Drum.</p>

<p>And so we sat there in the twilight, taking no heed of the
candles that ran down on the prickets in shrouds of wax, two
wretched and misguided men, for I could not count Evan Garrie
happy, for I believed that the strange girl had still her
enchantment over him, and when he spoke of going back to Scotland
he did not mean any other place but Castle Drum nor any other
person save Jannot Garrie.</p>

<p>I wondered if she had sent to him at The Hague, though I took
her to be a person who could not write or read. But it might be
that she had these accomplishments.</p>

<p>I remembered then in the drowsiness of my misery as I sat in
the twilight in the window-place, sunk and not resting, on the
seat piled with cushions, of what she had shown me in the jet
stone&mdash;the moor and the man riding across it, and the woman
whom they had dragged out of the coach. And since
then&mdash;often it would be in my dreams and when
waiting&mdash;I had put names to those shadows, and I had thought
that the man in the coach was Doctor James Sharp, the Archbishop
of St. Andrews, and that the leaders of the men who had attacked
him were those two whom we had met on Magus Moor outside the
episcopal city. The young woman, too, might well have been
Marjorie Sharp&mdash;she was married, but I forgot that name.</p>

<p>I had spoken to Evan Garrie of this more than once and he had
admitted to me that the Covenanters believed that Doctor Sharp
was a most powerful wizard and one who was responsible more than
any other for the dire persecutions that they underwent. And he
had added, half fearfully, that he believed that there were two
men who were set aside to watch the Archbishop and, if need be,
to avenge the Covenanters' blood upon him. These had a private
dispute with him, one had been his steward.</p>

<p>I had often wondered if these two men were those whom I had
met outside St. Andrews, and now all this medley of dreams and
fancy returned to me and I said sullenly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Cameron is a dangerous man to return to the Highlands.
He'll rouse them all into a flame. What will the revenge of
Colonel Graham and Doctor Sharp be on all these roaring and
preaching against the king?"</p>

<p>"You see what I think of him," replied Evan Garrie, gloomily,
"by the fact that I will not return with him. Now for your
affair, Mr. Maitland. What do you wish me to do for you? Long
since I vowed myself in service to you, and so did Virgil, the
poor blackamoor."</p>

<p>"You can do nothing for me," I replied, but the whole fibre of
my being was warmed by this offer of friendship. "I tell you I
met to-day this unhappy woman whom once I set too high."</p>

<p>And there I stayed myself, not wishing to tell the story of my
unfortunate passion to this young man, making myself thus but one
with him in his folly towards Jannot Garrie. And I tried to
soothe him and put him off from probing into my story, and I
tried to treat lightly the talk of Mr. Richard Cameron. I said
that we must forget Scotland and all her woes and evils, and all
her witches and devils, and the Covenanters and the troopers.
That we would go forward into Europe, into Germany or France, and
some way find a livelihood.</p>

<p>The young man did not reply to me, and I thought that my talk
was wasted, for he was a Scot and loved Scotland.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>So I went out into the clean air and wondered much what I
should do, where my fate was minded to lead me. And then I
thought, and it seemed at the time no more than a whim, that I
would ask for an audience of the Prince. He was young, not much
above my own age, and he had proved himself in a long and
difficult war, and I knew that he was regarded by the people over
whom he ruled as a hero, one who had saved them from annihilation
at the hands of His Most Christian Majesty. I knew, too, that he
was considered, despite his youth, one of the most wise and
skilful statesmen in Europe. And I thought that perhaps if I was
to see him and discuss with him the Covenanters in Scotland and
Mr. Penn's schemes for a city of brotherly love to be founded in
the New World, he might speak some sentence or offer some words
that would relieve me from the worst of anxieties and set me on
some manly path of useful work.</p>

<p>So far I had made myself known to few people in The Hague but,
as I have already related, remained quietly in the background,
only frequenting the usual coffeehouses and clubs where the
exiles gathered in comfort.</p>

<p>Nov I used what influence I had and waited upon Sir William
Temple, telling him of my great relation, the Duke of Lauderdale,
and begging that I might be permitted to wait upon the
Stadtholder.</p>

<p>The matter was soon arranged, for Sir William Temple was close
to His Highness' ear, and then, as always, much in his
favour.</p>

<p>I found the Prince, like so many great men, easily accessible
to those who seriously wished to see him, and it was but three
days after my application that I found myself waiting in the
salons of the Binnenhof, awaiting an audience with the
Prince.</p>

<p>The thought of this interview had somewhat put my personal
affairs out of my mind, and I was able to remember with
equanimity that Philippa Dean was also in The Hague.</p>

<p>I had not seen her since I had met her on the Vyverberg in her
dark green cloak, with the footman and spy so discreetly but so
obviously behind her. I knew where she lived and I had seen her
husband more than once going to and fro in his carriage. I
mistrusted him; not only on personal grounds did I dislike him,
for I believed him to be a sly and treacherous man, one who would
act for two or three masters at once and serve only the one who
paid him the highest fee.</p>

<p>Philippa Dean was in the spirit in my mind and in my blood, as
I thought, and never should I be able to forget her. But I had,
through the help and the companionship of Evan Garrie and through
dwelling on this interview that I was to have with His Highness,
the Stadtholder, somewhat put her in the background of my
thoughts. And I was as surprised as pleased at my clarity of
mind. I was able to think of the future with some hope.</p>

<p>Might I not yet carve out a fine fortune for myself? It was
said that the Emperor required noble volunteers to help him in
his war against the Turks. It might be, that my blood was proud
enough to enable me to volunteer to fight in the trenches beneath
Belgrade.</p>

<p>His Highness was, I reflected, as I waited for my audience, in
a curious position. He belonged to one of the oldest families in
Europe which had given emperors to the West. His quarterings were
not to be placed on one shield, nor his titles to be rehearsed by
one herald. I had always understood that he was one of the
proudest of men. He was a grandchild, too, of our King Charles I,
and married to his cousin, the Duke of York's daughter Mary. But
for all that he was the chief magistrate of a republic and
effected to live on an equality with the least of the Dutch.
Surely there was something to be learned from a man who could,
being so born and married, hold such a position.</p>

<p>His palace was in an ancient building, and the rooms wherein I
waited were handsomely decorated, the ceilings being of embossed
leather and the walls hung with handsome tapestries. If only I
could have forgotten Philippa Dean, I should have been
pleasurably concerned to this interview with a man who was then
considered the most admired personage in Europe.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, what had I to say to him?</p>

<p>I did not intend to offer him either my sword or my wit, I
would not be his soldier or his spy, and I had no news to bring
him from England. What, then, had I to do with His Highness the
Stadtholder? I knew that I had obtained the favour of this
audience only through the influence of Sir William Temple, who no
doubt had mentioned to His Highness that I was a relative of the
Duke of Lauderdale, then one of the most important men in Great
Britain, and he who had most the ear of King Charles in regard to
the affairs of Scotland.</p>

<p>The Prince did not keep me waiting long; he had none of that
arrogance that distinguished men of smaller pride. He received me
alone in his cabinet that was hung with domestic pictures by
artists of his native country.</p>

<p>When I came into his presence and thought of the cares that he
had upon him and on the futility of my own life and the
uncertainty of my future, I felt in a manner ashamed and stood,
as I did not often, even in the presence of the great, at a
loss.</p>

<p>He was a man below my own stature but of a manly countenance.
I had seen him before, but only at a distance on ceremonial
occasions, and I had marked the great likeness he bore both to
his mother, whom I remembered in youth, and to his uncle, now
dead, the Duke of Gloucester.</p>

<p>Knowing his reputation for thoroughness and shrewdness, I
could not doubt that he had my dossier, as the French term it,
under his hand, and I felt foolish as he questioned me as to why
I had asked for this audience.</p>

<p>I can see him now as I saw him then in his plain attire of
maroon coloured velvet; he was seldom out of the uniform he wore
of Colonel of the Blue Guards, but on this occasion he wore
civilian dress. His hair was of the Stuart colour, chestnut-red
and long and fine as a woman's, and his eyes for power and
brilliancy were the most remarkable I had ever seen.</p>

<p>I had but a poor tale to tell him. I said:</p>

<p>"Your Highness knows I am but a ruined gentleman of the house
of my Lord of Lauderdale, that I have been for a while in
Scotland...''</p>

<p>"A strange position," interrupted the Prince, speaking
excellent English, but slowly and with care. "You were a
pedagogue, I believe, in the establishment of Sir Donald
Garrie?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I. "And, sir, liked it but little. I have been for
some months in The Hague and have not ventured to bring myself to
the notice of Your Highness before. For in truth," I cried, "I
know not what to do nor to what turn, and though it is but an
impertinence of me to bring my troubles to Your Highness ..."</p>

<p>"Still," he interrupted again in his stately manner, "no doubt
you are aware that I am glad both to receive news from England
from any source," and these last words he emphasised, "and also
to receive the offer of the services of any worthy
gentleman."</p>

<p>And then he pressed on me, as Captain Graham had pressed on me
some months before, the offer of a troop of horse. I might have a
position in the army of the States-General immediately, and all
my tale of tragedy and present confusion of affairs
overlooked.</p>

<p>I could scarcely forbear laughing in the austere countenance
of His Highness as he made his proposition.</p>

<p>"I am a friend," said I, "of Captain Graham."</p>

<p>"And he was a most efficient officer," said the Stadtholder,
"I was sorry to lose him' from my service. He vvas also of a high
and passionate temperament and one, perhaps, who will do better
at the work he is now employed on than he would in one of my
regiments."</p>

<p>"And does Your Highness," I broke out, "approve the work that
Captain Graham is now employed on? Do you not rather support the
Covenanters?"</p>

<p>"I support neither the man of blood nor the fanatic," replied
the Prince, ready for dubious arguments. "What I work for I think
must be known to gentlemen like yourself, Mr. Maitland, who take
no great interest in politics&mdash;it is the peace of Europe,
and the resistance to the aggression of France."</p>

<p>"Your Highness does not, then, think the Covenanters are
saints?"</p>

<p>"I would persecute no man for his religion," replied the
Prince, "and those opinions of mine are too well known for me to
need to repeat them to you now, Mr. Maitland."</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock, a fine piece, as I recall, of pierced
brass that stood above his bureau, and then down at his hands. I
remarked them keenly; they lay upon his knees, and though they
were of feminine delicacy and beauty, they gave the impression of
power and authority; though they were so still I felt as if they
contained an immense energy, and it was only by an effort of will
that he held them thus tranquil; they were equally able with
sword or pen, as I knew.</p>

<p>I felt out of countenance and even a fool.</p>

<p>"I have nothing," said I, "to tell Your Highness. No espionage
talk from England has come my way, and as to what I have seen in
Scotland, it would not interest you."</p>

<p>"Ay, but it is of interest to me," said he earnestly, turning
his brilliant eyes upon me. "If you have any interest with these
fanatics, with men like Mr. Richard Cameron who go about now, as
I understand, to light flames in their native land, bid them be
peaceful and more tolerant and to look well to their warrants. If
you have any influence with men like Captain Graham, bid them not
ride too high nor be too overbearing. There is never virtue in
extreme, Mr. Maitland."</p>

<p>He then asked me if I often saw my noble kinsman, and I
replied that it was but seldom I had that honour.</p>

<p>"If you ever do see His Grace of Lauderdale, Mr. Maitland,
whisper a word in his ear of the fire and sword and the tyranny
he has created. Bid him, if it be possible to one of his temper,
to be more moderate and liberal."</p>

<p>I then asked him what he suggested I should do, and by his
answer I measured his opinion of my worth, for I knew he had but
one set proposition he made to all whom he considered useless but
perhaps bold adventurers. And he said to me graciously
enough:</p>

<p>"Go and fight the Turks, Mr. Maitland. The Emperor has need of
volunteers outside Belgrade. There may honour be acquired, and if
nothing better, a death that any man might tolerate."</p>

<p>I saw then his estimate of me, and that he had no employment
to offer in The Hague, nor should I have expected any save that
of a trooper.</p>

<p>After he had got out of me what he could with many shrewd
probings and questionings&mdash;I understood that he allowed no
one, especially an Englishman, to speak to him without
discovering something, however small, of the world's affairs that
might help him in his great design&mdash;I took my turn to
venture a question to this Prince. I asked him what he thought of
the design of Mr. William Penn, who was lately returned to The
Hague?</p>

<p>"What design?" asked the Stadtholder. I could tell by his
stately manner that he thought I was interfering beyond my
province in the matters of statecraft, that he suspected me,
after all, perhaps for a spy or a secret service agent of some
foreign government. I pitied him for his need of perpetual
watchfulness, for I knew how he must be surrounded by intrigue
and jobbery. So I relieved his doubts by saying:</p>

<p>"I do not ask Your Highness to debate statecraft with me. I
refer to the design that Mr. William Penn has for establishing a
colony in the New World and building a city that he intends to
call Philadelphia, or city of brotherly love."</p>

<p>At this His Highness smiled, and I learnt afterwards the
reason for his suspicions. Mr. Penn had been sent by the Duke of
York to endeavour to induce His Highness to assent to a repeal of
the Test, as I had heard, and the Stadtholder, though the most
tolerant of men, had refused this with a dry reference to the
little reliance to be placed on the British Government.</p>

<p>I expected, when I saw His Highness smiling at me like that,
to be rebuked for an enthusiast or a fanatic. But instead he told
me that he considered the enterprise laudable.</p>

<p>"And I," said he, "when I was a young man newly come to the
government of this country when it was threatened with
destruction by the French, had some such design myself. I thought
I would take all the shipping in the port of Amsterdam and that
sooner than live under foreign tyranny we would go and found
another country in the Indies. And so you see, Mr. Maitland, that
I am inclined to judge leniently these fantasies of Mr.
Penn."</p>

<p>"Yet, sir, you call them fantasies," I remarked.</p>

<p>"I think they be little more for one who is but a private
gentleman and has no great fortune behind him."</p>

<p>"But let Your Highness consider. The land belongs to a parcel
of Indians, who might easily be driven off or massacred, or
bought, as is Mr. Penn's intention, by a few knives and guns or
to gentlemen who will sell willingly for a low sum. Let Your
Highness remember that this land is rich in all possibilities,
with great rivers and fine timber and fertile soil."</p>

<p>"If you wish to found a new state," said the Stadtholder, "it
is not the quality of the land that matters but that of the
people you take there. Where does Mr. Penn propose to find
colonists worthy of his ideals?"</p>

<p>"Sir," replied I, "are there not enough broken soldiers and
discontented idlers and oppressed craftsmen and unemployed
artisans in Europe? And if these were gathered together and taken
out to the New World, would it not leave the Old World freer of
broils and difficulties and bloodshed?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask my opinion?" demanded His Highness, who
seemed, however, I flattered myself, interested in my discourse.
"My hands, as doubtless you know, Mr. Maitland, are full enough
with the affairs of the old world. I have plenty of trouble in
this small country of my own as likely to last me my days,
without seeking out these fresh problems. Are you a friend of Mr.
Penn's?"</p>

<p>I disclaimed that honour and I said that this scheme had taken
my fancy, and that if I had money I would have given it to the
Quakers towards his proposed colonization of America&mdash;the
Holy Enterprise, as they named it.</p>

<p>The Prince seemed to ponder a moment in his pensive way; he
was a man who went deeply into any scheme that was put before
him, and no doubt he was considering in his large, magnanimous
mind if here there was not something that could be turned to the
good of the Netherlands, shaken, if not crippled, as it was by a
war costly and bloody, and hampered by a circle of enemies and a
bad peace.</p>

<p>He said at length:</p>

<p>"Mr. Penn is not the man for such an enterprise. He is too
simple, too easily led. I think him honest, I know him full of
ardour, but such a project as this is for a great prince."</p>

<p>"And what great prince could undertake it," I asked, "seeing
all in Europe, as Your Highness says of yourself, are engaged in
domestic broils?"</p>

<p>"Until we can secure toleration," replied the Stadtholder,
"until every man in the Western hemisphere is free to follow his
own tastes, his own conscience that matter I always took to be
God's province&mdash;until he can without dread of molestation or
persecution, follow his own faith, the hands of every prince and
ruler and leader will be full. And who shall have time to
consider what may be done with the New World? Better, Mr.
Maitland, to leave it to the savages."</p>

<p>"I suppose, sir," I replied, "in the breast of every man there
is a longing for the Promised Land, for the Golden Age."</p>

<p>His Highness smiled again.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose, sir, that we shall get the Golden Age or the
Promised Land by taking a parcel of men, some of whom would
assuredly be fools and some scoundrels, from your country or my
country or France, and setting them against a fresh background?
Would they not take with them their old ills, their old vices,
their old quarrels and their ancient hatreds? No, Mr. Maitland,
it is a pretty scheme, but leave it to Mr. Penn, and do you,"
said he, returning quickly to his original point, "serve whatever
good cause you have at heart in a more active way. You are a
gentleman of leisure, as you have said, and came upon some
misfortune."</p>

<p>I saw that His Highness would still persuade me to be a
soldier. I was worth no more than that to him.</p>

<p>"I refused Captain Graham, and I must refuse his
better&mdash;that is, Your Highness. Besides, there is no war in
Europe at the moment, and I have no Wish to track down the
Covenanters in Scotland."</p>

<p>"There's better work than that," said the Prince, "the Emperor
always requires volunteers. Leave the New World to the savages
and help chase the Turks out of Europe."</p>

<p>I suppose he must have seen some merit in me, for he tried
again with that patience that he did not disdain to use on the
smallest things, to turn me in some way to his service, and I
found that he thought a little better of me than I had
supposed.</p>

<p>For he asked if I would undertake political work for him in
England, if I would report news of the various parties, and bring
messages to and fro The Hague. I marvelled at the largeness of
his designs and the attention he gave to small details and that
he should trouble about a gentleman like myself, no doubt merely
because I was a cadet of the house of Maitland and because my
reputation would cause me to be overlooked as a mere spendthrift
gambler.</p>

<p>I suppose he had found me of some intelligence, and perhaps of
unusual tolerance to take so much trouble with me. I felt I was
in the presence of a great man, yet I wanted to have nothing to
do with him; the magnitude of his burdens weighed me down, even
though they were on another's shoulders. I would not have been in
his place for all his titles and the high place he held in the
armorials of Europe.</p>

<p>When I declined to do any work for him, he, without any loss
of temper or change of countenance, asked me still patiently why
I had demanded to see him?</p>

<p>And I wondered why he had granted me this favour, seeing that
every moment of his time must have been parcelled out among vast
interests.</p>

<p>So I told him that I hoped he would not take it for insolence
that I had asked for this audience, being concerned at my own
future, my mind and spirit in a turmoil, and I took him to be the
wisest Prince&mdash;for all his youth&mdash;in Europe, and that I
had hoped he might say something that would give me some guidance
as to what to do with the rest of my life, for I was a man not
yet thirty years of age.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Maitland," said he, still with that unchanged and
stately composure that I had observed in no one else; it was
marvellous to me that a man could have so much control of his
feelings and temper, "have I not given you some guidance? I have
asked you to work for me, and when I say for me I do not speak
for myself but of the common cause."</p>

<p>I knew by this phrase, that was often on his lips and on those
of his followers, that he meant the Protestant religion, that he
was determined to champion against the aggression of France, and
by the Protestant religion he meant also the liberty of mankind.
He had no quarrel with the Roman Catholics, and was believe ii to
be on friendly terms even with His Holiness the Pope. But against
oppression and tyranny as he saw it he had firmly set his face,
and so far had won for himself in that fight an unparalleled
place in Europe, being the most admired and respected, ay, and
feared, of modern heroes.</p>

<p>But such high work was not for me. I would be neither his
soldier nor his spy, his pamphleteer or his agent.</p>

<p>Seeing there was nothing to be obtained from me, he told me
that the audience was over, still without haste or sign of
impatience, though he must have known that he had wasted his
time&mdash;time to him as valuable as gold, on a useless, wilful
man.</p>

<p>But I had still one or two questions to ask him, and taxed his
tolerance by demanding what he thought of this Mr. Richard
Cameron and his followers, Covenanters or Cameronians, as they
were termed. I knew that these men looked to the Stadtholder for
protection, and I wondered how he considered their fanaticism. It
was not likely that he would commit himself to a man like Tom
Maitland on these subjects, but he replied, in his low, tranquil
voice:</p>

<p>"There are mistakes on both sides, sir. Scotland is
ill-governed. You cannot suppress a proud people by putting
soldiers on them. And Captain Graham, whom I myself recommended
to His Royal Highness the Duke of York, is not a man for such
work. He thinks of nothing else but his own glory."</p>

<p>"Then you give the Cameronians the right of it?"</p>

<p>"What man can say he has the right of it?" asked His Highness,
rising. "These enthusiasts and fanatics do harm with their zeal.
They, too, lack tolerance."</p>

<p>"Your Highness will have none of Captain Graham, and none of
Mr. Cameron, and none of William Penn Who, then," said I, "is the
man to be admired and followed?"</p>

<p>"The moderate man," said the Prince, "he who, without
persecution or violence, sets himself a difficult task for the
good of mankind, and pursues it through all disappointments."</p>

<p>I had one more question to ask him. He had used the word
glory, that word that had of late run so often in my mind, and as
he was in his stately yet homely way ringing the bell to show me
from his cabinet&mdash;I think he liked me a little, or he would
not have tolerated me, useless as I was to him, for so
long&mdash;I asked him what he made of that word glory that one
heard so often on the mouths of men, worldly glory, heavenly
glory, glory which I had thought described best by the old poet
as a "circle in the water."</p>

<p>"And how," said I, "would Your Highness define this quality of
glory? Captain Graham seeks it by endeavouring to slay the
Covenanters, and the Covenanters seek it by allowing themselves
to be slain. The King of France seeks it by trying to overlord
Europe. And Your Highness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no time to think of it," he replied, coolly, "I do my
task as I see it set before me."</p>

<p>These words were spoken modestly, but he added others that
made me think that he, too, had his ambitions, for he said:</p>

<p>"What I do is, as I think, sent me by God."</p>

<p>And what pride, after all, can go further than that? And had
he not felt the lure of glory when he had led the charge of St.
Neff, when he had cut the dykes to free the waters with which to
roll the invader back?</p>

<p>I left him much impressed, in a way exalted and excited by his
personality, but still resolute not to involve myself in his deep
politics.</p>

<p>Years afterwards, when he was a king and I was one of the
common press, I looked at him again, but from a distance and with
the impression I had of him then&mdash;that he was unutterably
lonely. And it was partly this loneliness that frightened me from
being in his service, for I wished to be down among more human
faults and failings, not perched up on the heights of these
solitary endeavours.</p>

<p>I knew the man had those who loved him well and served him
faithfully, and there it was, the sense that he was set apart, to
labour and to suffer. For what purpose? For the good of the
others, as he thought, perhaps, something for glory, too, as I
suppose.</p>

<p>I never forgot him. His face was familiar to all of us, it was
so commonly reproduced in all the print shops, on coins and
medals, yet there was no likeness of him that gave the essence of
the man as I had noticed it when I sat in that small cabinet with
him, gazing at the pale hollow face with the dark chestnut hair,
and the very large clear hazel eyes&mdash;a sensitive face, that
of a fearless Prince.</p>

<p>I think he forgot me as soon as I had left his presence; it
was always his custom to see anyone who solicited an audience and
who had some name and a family behind him. For this curious and
valiant Prince had one great design&mdash;that of securing the
liberty and freedom of his country and resisting the domination
of France, and to this end spared no pains and undertook so much
business that he was a marvel to all who knew him.</p>

<p>When I returned to my lodging I found a letter from Philippa
Dean declaring that she must and would see me before she returned
to England.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>The weather was mild and the trees planted along the canals
began to show their first green. Light clouds still blew up from
the sea, but they were of a transparent texture and the faint
blue of the sky showed through them as they floated above the
towers and spires of The Hague. The Dutch are great gardeners,
and already the bouquets of flowers, tulips, hyacinths, and
daffodils appeared in the bow pots behind the brightly-polished
glass of the long windows.</p>

<p>Time was flowing away, it seemed to me almost as if I could
see it, like sand falling through the hour-glass or blood softly
dripping from a wound.</p>

<p>Time flowing away and no problem solved. The thoughtful people
were bewildered and silent, the careless chattered and went about
their several concerns. The news from Scotland was bad, the
country was in a state of civil war. My lord of St. Andrews, the
sheriffs and the commanders of the troops in all the different
counties went well guarded. My relative, His Grace of Lauderdale,
stayed at St. James's, where he was safe. A fresh outburst of
roaring hatred was loosened against the Government by the
execution of one James Mitchell, a man who many years before had
shot at Dr. Sharp and missed him, though he had wounded Dr.
Honeyman who was with him. This Mitchell had been in hiding since
but suddenly been discovered or betrayed, and, though he had not
as much as wounded His Grace he was put to death for the slaying
of the other gentleman, who had died of gangrene.</p>

<p>This seemed to me not only unmerciful, but impolitic, albeit
the fellow had the intention to murder.</p>

<p>I could not forget what His Highness, the Stadtholder, had
told me. I knew something of the man now and I could see the
result of his works all about me, a people inspired with loyalty,
energetic, hard-working, honest and honourable, and I remembered
that half-averted, aquiline face that I had looked at in the
little cabinet, and those eyes that had gazed at me without pride
or ostentation but that seemed to indicate a spirit contending
with the future.</p>

<p>But what was all this to me, it was but the background of my
private distress? Philippa Dean remained at The Hague. She had
been in my life, perhaps, and in this story certainly, a
featureless creature, but the symbol of distracting
womanhood.</p>

<p>I believed that I had loved her, I assured myself that this
was so again and again. I did so in order to banish from my mind
some creeping doubts that I resented the pass to which this same
love or passion had brought me. Was it not because of Philippa
Dean that I was now placed, as it were, beyond the pale, as they
would say of the wild Irish in Ireland, a man who had lost touch
with his own class, in some sense of the word an exile, living on
a kinsman's bounty?</p>

<p>But for her I should not have gambled so desperately even
endeavouring to lose my estates in my despair. But for her I
should not have met her young brother in the <i>duello</i>. I had
tried to avoid that encounter, but the lad was not to be
persuaded to reason. I had tried, superior swordsman as I was,
not to do him much hurt, and was it my fault that the slight
wound that my sword had given him had brought about his
death?</p>

<p>It had been the clumsiness of the surgeon, who had allowed
gangrene to develop, and the lad's own imprudence in eating rich
food and drinking quantities of wine when he had the fever. But
all the blame and the chagrin came upon me. I was the man who had
to leave the country, using all the influence I possessed to
escape arrest.</p>

<p>I felt I had sunk in many ways since I had left England for
that position His Grace of Lauderdale had contrived for me in
Castle Drum. I had become wild and wilful, sullen in my manners,
and had dwelt too much apart with Evan Garrie, even preferring
the company of poor Virgil, the blackamoor, to those gentlefolk
who were my equals.</p>

<p>And all this while Philippa Dean remained at The Hague, and
had written and her letters were not answered.</p>

<p>And sometimes all my wild rebellion against my fate, and my
own discontent at my present idleness, would die down as I
thought of her, not many streets of these prim houses away,
living sullenly with her suspicious lord.</p>

<p>Sometimes I saw her passing by in sedan or coach, sometimes I
dreamt of her in those dark realms that have no sound, no colour,
no perfume, the sombre, silent landscape of dreams.</p>

<p>I did not know clearly what happened in these 'visions, but
when I awoke I would have to lie still, drawing deep breaths to
quiet my anguish. For always in these unbidden imaginings she was
close to me, and always when I awoke I was once more bitterly
bereaved.</p>

<p>So April was nearly over and I remained gloomy and inactive,
and Evan Garrie fretting and inactive.</p>

<p>I could see that he wanted to return to Scotland; he began to
talk of Jannot again, to wonder how she was faring in Castle Drum
that seemed, as he said, to be at the other end of the world, for
all the space there was between him and his kinsfolk. And I
noticed a great uneasiness in him and discovered that he believed
the fair, golden witch was casting spells over him and perhaps
had an image of wax of him shut up in her chamber, over which she
would croon her incantations.</p>

<p>I tried to clear his mind of these fumes and to urge him to go
about among the acquaintances we had made at The Hague, for there
were many people still in the Dutch capital, of many persuasions,
creeds and complexions, enough to distract a young man from any
sick dreams.</p>

<p>But Evan, who had been cheerful at our first coming into
Holland, now would keep solitary in his room, refusing almost all
company save my own and that of the uncouth blackamoor. Virgil
was often called up from the closet where he slept, to sit the
other side of the yellow earthenware stove and listen to the
complaints that he scarcely understood of Evan Garrie, who would
talk a little, and pull at his long clay pipe a little, and half
doze in the overheated room.</p>

<p>There was no question yet of putting the stoves out, for
though the weather was mild the air was still damp and at night
the wet fogs would blow up strongly from the North Sea.</p>

<p>Sir Donald Garrie wrote to Evan as a cadet of his house,
urging his return, trying to persuade, nay, ordering him to take
a commission in the new troop that Captain Graham was raising to
put down the insolent Conventicles.</p>

<p>I tried to persuade him to remain as he was, but my Lord of
Lauderdale's last charity was giving out, we soon must find some
means of making money. I suggested we should turn our backs on
the North, and if we did not take His Highness the Stadtholder's
advice, at least press eastwards into lands that to us would be
new.</p>

<p>We might go to Prague, I suggested, maliciously, and see the
city of the alchemists.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie did not care for this, that he took to be but an
unkind jest on my part. I often heard him sigh and groan, and I
was often much troubled for his obvious distress of mind.</p>

<p>I became impatient with him too. Had I not my own troubles?
Might I not step into the street and see the small, pinched face
of Philippa looking between the folds of her fur hood or under
the shade of her large hat, through the glass of her coach or
sedan-chair? And what was the use to me that I should struggle to
disentangle him from his ancient enchantment.</p>

<p>I supposed that he must love or lust after the girl, although
he believed her to be no better than a witch, though he had seen
with his own eyes many such unnameable powers as that in the
ruined chapel that I had beheld but once and been stricken for
ever.</p>

<p>The lad had grown comely and strong during these months that
he had spent in Holland, with better food and lodging than he had
known before, and for the first part of the sojourn, at least,
more peace of mind.</p>

<p>He was a pleasing enough creature to look at with his ruddy
complexion and strong, red-gold hair, that he wore instead of a
peruke, curling it carefully at night round leaden ribbons, for
he had his vanity now, and with such means as he could secure and
such credit as he could command, went richly dressed like a
gentleman. I had my amusement out of that, remembering him as I
had first seen him, a rude Scot in his homespun and leather, and
when he went abroad on his rough horse with targe and dirk.</p>

<p>His mother came of a noble Highland family, but he never wore
the plaid that his relatives, the three ladies of Castle Drum
would, when the fancy took them, twist round their head or
shoulders.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>There must be an end even to the longest hesitancy and the end
of mine came when Philippa one day walked up our narrow stairs
and straight into our room with as much natural composure as if
she had been my wife or my sister.</p>

<p>It chanced that our rooms were over a small shop kept by a
china merchant who sold fragrant tea, fruits in syrup, and
delicate Eastern porcelain. When you entered his shop you were
faced by the door on the right that led to the apartment filled
by his pleasant commodities and a narrow staircase that twisted
opposite and led up to our chambers. These we had with a closet
behind the shop for Virgil.</p>

<p>I suppose it had not been difficult for Philippa, who had her
full share of feminine cunning, to enter the shop and make her
purchases and then, eluding whatever servant or escort she had,
to turn quickly up the stairs into our apartment.</p>

<p>She must have watched her time, for it fell out exactly as she
would have it. I was alone, even Virgil had gone abroad to see
after a saddle for me, and Evan Garrie was attending a gathering
at the little meetinghouse, where the Scots held their
Episcopalian services, that being, superficially, his
persuasion.</p>

<p>It was a fair day, and my room, always an agreeable place to
me, though in a strange house and a strange land, was lapped in
pale sunshine. The furniture was good, but worn, all in the Dutch
style, that is, well wrought, solid, and dark.</p>

<p>I had my papers before me and was wasting time&mdash;too much
leisure I threw away in this fashion&mdash;on putting together
notes on my travels, writing of my own insignificant life that in
my hard vanity and black pride I thought of the greatest
importance. I had written of the Covenanters, of Doctor Sharp,
and Captain Graham, even of the dream, foolish as it seemed now,
or vision that had been provoked by the gazing into the square of
jet that Isabelle Garrie had put into my hand that day already
seeming long ago in Castle Drum.</p>

<p>I had written of the speech I had had with His Highness, the
Stadtholder, of this and that, even to the snow I had noted on
the ground when first we had come to Holland, and the hymn tunes
the bells chimed overhead.</p>

<p>And here was Philippa making it all seem foolish. What had we
to say to one another?</p>

<p>So much that all words were useless.</p>

<p>Now the snow had melted almost everywhere, save in that far
North that I had not reached. Even in Scotland it would be gone,
except on the highest mountain-tops. Here there were green leaves
through which the sunshine was pouring, that I could see through
the thick shining glass of my window.</p>

<p>And there was Philippa with her hand on the door and her eyes
bright behind the lowered lids and her lips unsteady and no words
passing through them.</p>

<p>As I rose before my scattered papers I did not know if I loved
or hated her most, if I most desired her or most wished her out
of my life and forgotten.</p>

<p>"Why are you remaining here?" she asked, and I could
understand by that question that was at random and yet might be
answered a thousand ways to the satisfaction of neither of us,
that she was intending to make a long talk of all that was
between us. And even as she spoke my resolution was taken and I
said sternly:</p>

<p>"I am returning to Scotland soon, in a few days."</p>

<p>She was as surprised at this as I should have been myself even
a few moments before, for I had taken no such resolve until I had
seen Philippa Dean standing beside my door.</p>

<p>"And what do you want me to do?" I added, harshly. "Kill
another for you? Ruin myself again? For I have gathered together
some little repute and substance."</p>

<p>"Was it my fault?" she asked. "And I do not blame you that
young Harry died. It was through his own wilfulness."</p>

<p>"Whether you blame me or not, I have the censure of the
world," I replied.</p>

<p>She seemed baffled, perhaps astonished, at my attitude.</p>

<p>"I thought that you would become a soldier," she said.</p>

<p>"Am I so commonplace that I should do what every disappointed
man does?" I sneered. "I have my own thoughts about women, and
about God, and about glory."</p>

<p>"Why," said she, still holding the door ajar, ready as I
thought to escape down the stairs at the least surprising noise,
"should you return to Scotland?"</p>

<p>"It is, in a way, my native country," said I. "Though my
mother was an Englishwoman, my father was a Scot, even if he did
spend most of his days in England."</p>

<p>"And what side are you on?" she said, and I think there was
resentment both in her look and in her tone. "Are you to help the
men who uphold the Covenant, or to ride with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The persecutors!" I took the words out of her mouth, for I
knew her strain of Whiggery. "I care for nothing for either,
Philippa. I wish to go where there is action."</p>

<p>"And I think," she said, "you have become crazed since last I
knew you. Do you not understand that it took me much toil and a
long intrigue to come here to The Hague? I was told you were
here, I thought there might be opportunities&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of sly and secret meetings," I said, "in this little place?
Where everyone is godly and well-behaved. And what of your
husband and the promises you made him." As I put this into words
I was overwhelmed by bitterness, for I thought of what it might
have been if Philippa had had the courage&mdash;but what women
had ever had that amount of courage?&mdash;to leave the husband
whom she loathed, the family whom she did not like, and go abroad
with me.</p>

<p>Yet, that was why I had always been allured by Mr. William
Penn's scheme of a new world, for I thought that I and Philippa
might go there, to that visionary shining city of brotherly love.
Even though she was another man's wife some honourable divorce
might be possible. Or we might travel to such a sweet wilderness
that there would be no talk of anything but natural love, no
censuring eyes, or preaching voices. But Philippa had hung back
and left me to the commonplace tragedies, the gambling-table, and
the <i>duello</i> in my despair, and the disgrace of failure. And
then had returned cringing like a beaten spaniel to her husband
for her board and her food and her silk gowns and her place at
Court.</p>

<p>Did I want her? Did I still imagine that I could be happy with
her?</p>

<p>Happiness! The word was but a torment. It could not be
achieved, I believe, on this earth, and who was to be drugged and
surfeited with tales of happiness in Heaven?</p>

<p>"Philippa," said I, "this is but a mockery of our former
meeting. I'll not have you for my secret mistress, even if it
could be contrived in such a place as this. I'm a ruined man, my
pockets are empty and my reputation blown upon."</p>

<p>"But, Tom," said she, prudently lowering her voice. "I love
you."</p>

<p>I thought the words sounded faint and false, little better
than the accents used by Jannot or Isabelle, the witch. At least
they had not profaned something that might have been holy when
they had leered at me with their golden eyes.</p>

<p>And then a thought that was poignant, ugly, and yet
delightful, stirred in me.</p>

<p>Had I been a fool? Was it possible that I was being drawn back
to Scotland by the enchantments of the ladies of Castle Drum even
as was Evan Garrie? When I had said&mdash;and it had been like
the voice of someone else speaking and not my own accents that I
wished to return to Scotland, did I mean that I wished to see
Isabelle and Jannot again? Or Isabelle only?</p>

<p>I looked at Philippa, and she seemed frightened at my gaze,
for she drew back through the half-open door. I looked at
Philippa, her face was white and pinched and small in the tawny
velvet hood she wore, and the little hand that clasped together
at her throat was as small as a child's and yet not as small as
the little hand of Isabelle Garrie.</p>

<p>There seemed then unnatural sounds in my ears, unnatural
sights before my eyes.</p>

<p>It was a piercing melancholy that possessed me, and yet a
sweet passion. I thought I saw before me the clear light of the
North and an air that was full of cold miserable winds, the
fantastic dance on a winter night of beings that had golden eyes
and who flitted in and out the grey snowflakes.</p>

<p>I thought of the tales that Evan Garrie had told me that night
when we had sat in the ruined cottage; the old broken walls
seemed about me now, the room roofless, and overhead the dark
sky, flecked by no remote stars.</p>

<p>But fooleries were what he had told me, yet lit by the broken
light of some half-remembered fairyland. I thought of those wild
streams, distant mountains, and gloomy moors, the low screaming
of the wind in the wide chimneys of Castle Drum, and Isabelle
moving silently about, and Jannot standing at the window watching
the beating of the rain through the last light of day.</p>

<p>Had I been driven away by fear, and would I be driven back by
desire?</p>

<p>The face and form of Philippa, who was but an ordinary mortal
woman, seemed to dwindle before my sight until it had vanished
like a speck of light receding into utter darkness.</p>

<p>And I thought of the rings in the stagnant water the stone had
made that day that Claverhouse's dragoons had clattered up to
Castle Drum after the failure to track the armed men on the
moors.</p>

<p>I heard Philippa's voice say to me:</p>

<p>"You're changed, Tom! You're like a man bewitched!"</p>

<p>I felt as if my imprisoned spirit was quickening within me. I
cannot put into words that scene, and when I turn my mind back to
it I feel even now my distressed passion and bewildered
expectancy.</p>

<p>I turned aside from Philippa, my hands still held the quill,
and on the piece of paper whereon I had been writing to still my
roving thoughts such scraps of commonplace as came into my mind,
I now traced the word "Isabelle."</p>

<p>As I wrote the name it was as if I broke the spell, for my
visions, or whatever they might be, left me in eddies, like waves
of water that obscured my sight, and I was again in the plain,
comfortable room at The Hague, and there was a frightened woman
with pale lips, the lower showed, I noticed, the dry pressure of
her teeth, standing at the door, leaning forward, staring at
me.</p>

<p>I noticed the artificial crimping of her hair. I remembered
that she had always had tender sight, her eyes were slightly
reddened.</p>

<p>How bravely she had arrayed herself for me, and how quickly
her alarm at my changed appearance had withered her decked
charms!</p>

<p>"I have been through some strife," I said, "since last I saw
you, Philippa. And I've known much inner debate and listened to
much wise talk, and there has been a truce between us. I think it
would be perilous to break it."</p>

<p>"You mean," said she, plainly, "that you have forgotten me.
And I have lain in a solitary, silly bed for months, Tom,
thinking of you. My marriage and my husband, you say, I think you
know what bargain was made there. I have been faithful to you, I
have been constant."</p>

<p>I stared at her again and I wanted to say. "Why, I no longer
love you, Philippa. It is useless for you to come cringing to me
as you cringe to your husband."</p>

<p>And if she had been no man's wife I would not have taken
her.</p>

<p>She was frightened, too. Perhaps this love that she talked
about was a dead thing to her also. At least, she kept glancing
over her shoulder down the stairs. Perhaps there was a maid or a
footman waiting for her. She must, for many years now, have been
ready with lies. She was not, I think, very skilful; she was in a
constant turmoil for fear she was utterly shamed by her own
falsehoods. Shamed, that is, before her own world, not before any
imagined God.</p>

<p>How little poor Philippa Dean cared for anything, save' what
pride and what pleasure and what ease she might get out of each
day as it passed.</p>

<p>"You go to Scotland," she said, on a sigh, quite bewildered.
"And what could take you to Scotland, Tom? I thought you went
there as a place of exile. Is it a woman?" she asked, still
whispering and sighing and looking down the stairs and then round
again at me as if she would have fled and then hoped that I would
call her back and make some passionate whispered promise for the
next meeting.</p>

<p>"A woman! No!" I answered with truth, for I did not think of
Isabelle as a woman. But my bewitched mood had passed and I no
longer believed that it was because of the ladies of Castle Drum
that I wished to return to Scotland.</p>

<p>There was a sound from below, the serving-man in the shop,
perhaps, or a customer, or some other, and Philippa was gone,
light-footed, but not so light as Isabelle Garrie.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>That evening I suggested to Evan Garrie that we, taking with
us Virgil, the blackamoor, should return to Scotland.</p>

<p>He was very willing, but asked me what my mind was, if I
should go as a King's man or to help the rebels. I could not tell
him, for I did not know my own intention save in so far as I
desired to return to Scotland.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE KILLING TIME</h2>

<p class="first">
THIS is the name that I have given to this part of my
narrative, but I think that what they afterwards came to term the
killing time was '84, but these earlier years when I was present
at the battles in Scotland and saw and heard of more bloodshed
than had ever come to my knowledge before was a 'killing time'
enough in my opinion.</p>

<p>It is difficult to get the rights of things in the remem
brance; maybe I have confused the year when Captain Graham became
Colonel. Graham and commanded a troop of English Horse, I was
ever absorbed in my own matters, weighty and dark to me, and
though. I was interested in this gentleman, his affairs came to
me by hearsay, and I made no note of them as I did of other
happenings that more nearly concerned myself.</p>

<p>I marked with malice how he had missed an heiress,</p>

<p>Helen Graham, my Lord of Montieth's daughter, and later, I
recall, he married for love, as they say, Jean Cochrane, who came
of a grim Covenanting family, and had Dunhope Castle for his
pains and later still a viscountcy, but how these things fit into
my narrative I hardly recall.</p>

<p>Nor does it greatly matter&mdash;during all those years of the
reigns of the last two Stuart kings, Scotland was at war within
herself, the Government troop were few but better trained than
the Covenanters; on the other hand, they did not know the country
so well, and the Conventicles could move on foot from place to
place where the horsemen could not go.</p>

<p>Moreover, half the gentry were Whigs, too, and hid the rebels,
stuck their arms into stacks and byres, or up chimneys, and gave
them money and food.</p>

<p>That was the wrong of it, to my thinking, that the spirit of
the country was for the Covenant and that the King had broken his
sword and forsworn his oath to these fierce people. I had
disliked the country when I was penned up there, but now I
thought of it as beautiful&mdash;like some of the native gems,
golden cairngorm and purple topas and water pearls, I recalled
these moors, hills, and streams, those milky clouds and curdling
mists.</p>

<p>I wondered now at my fear and rage at Isabelle, with her
noiseless feet and eyes like torn water with the sun in it; shut
up in Castle Drum with her sick brother, the two other wilful
women, and that evil man, Dr. Cyrus Fletcher, how could she be
other than what she was?</p>

<p>Why did I who had once fled from her now want to take her
away, from her grim home, from Scotland?</p>

<p>I had received a letter from Mr. Penn before I left The Hague,
and it set me afire with hopeful longing.</p>

<p>He wrote to me from Worminghurst, where he was established
with his wife Gerli, and told of the progress the Quakers were
making in buying parcels of land in Maryland and New Jersey;
there had been a company for this end for some while, since '76 I
think, but it had lagged for lack of money and ships. Now it went
ahead and seemed as if it might be a great venture; and my spirit
could not but rise to the words that Mr. Penn quoted to me as to
the New Jersey Settlement, where already a meeting-house had been
built and bargains made peaceably with the native Indians for
land, by sale or barter.</p>

<p>There were the words&mdash;the venture was "a foundation for
after ages to understand their liberty as men and Christians,
that they might not be brought into bondage, but by their own
consent; for we put the authority in the people."</p>

<p>A brave challenge to the Old World!</p>

<p>I dreamed that I might sail to those unspoilt shores and that
there Isabelle would be no more a witch, nor Tom Maitland a
ruined gentleman with a tarnished name, for already I was
thinking of myself and Isabelle as one. But this would mean that
I must become a Quaker, and here doubts came teasing, and I
recalled the advice of the young Stadtholder, that he had so
patiently given me&mdash;"that Mr. Penn was not the man for so
large an enterprise, and that no Promised Land should be peopled
by those who brought their sorrows and faults with them."</p>

<p>So New Jersey remained a view of Pisgah to me, and I turned my
attention to matters at hand, the more readily as Mr. Penn wrote
to me that he was travelling in Germany with a company of
Quakers, among them Mr. Fox and Mr. Barclay, and that I missed
seeing him in the Lowlands by but a little.</p>

<p>For I thought that if the leaders were away the scheme would
limp and it would be wiser for me to wait until these men sailed
themselves for their Utopia. Besides, I could not endure to leave
the Old World while Isabelle remained in Castle Drum.</p>

<p>So it all stood as we contended whether or not we should sail
to Scotland, making a voluntary neglect of the advantages we
might have had in The Hague.</p>

<p>"I must go," said Evan Garrie continuously. "I must help the
persecuted, who are my own people."</p>

<p>With this delay came another letter from 'William Penn,
telling of the new sufferings of the Quakers. Where was justice
to be found in the Old 'World?</p>

<p>He broached a scheme to me, with his great vigour and
energy&mdash;the late King had owed his father, Admiral Penn, a
great sum of money, perhaps many thousands of pounds. Would His
Majesty, perhaps, be induced to grant a space of virgin land in
America to cancel this debt&mdash;a wilderness that the Quakers
might make to blossom like the rose, where there might be
freedom, justice for all?</p>

<p>"It is a dream," said young Evan, when I told him of Mr.
Penn's zeal.</p>

<p>"Ay, but men make their dreams come true, Evan. This young
Prince here had his dream when he set himself against France. He
was laughed at, but so far he triumphs&mdash;maybe Mr. Penn will
found his city yet."</p>

<p>"And maybe the time will come," said Evan, "when men can
worship as they please in Scotland."</p>

<p>"Some will have to die first, Evan, and suffer cruelly."</p>

<p>"It might as well be me. I am of little worth to anyone."</p>

<p>I was also for action, but still not clearly saw what side to
fight for; I could afford to please my conscience, for I had
nothing to lose and nothing to gain save the chance of seeing
Isabelle again.</p>

<p>I wrote to my friends in Scotland, directing the answers to be
sent to the port of Leither; among others I wrote to John Graham,
in what mood I know not, save that I wanted his news, and I knew
that he would reply, for he was exact and careful in his
business, and still wanted men, and hoped to get me and young
Garrie. I wrote to His Grace of Lauderdale, too, asking for money
to be sent to Edinburgh, and I laughed to think that I might join
the "ranting rogues," as he called them, who were so tormenting
him.</p>

<p>As soon as we had made up our minds to return to Scotland we
set about the business as if there had never been any debate
whatever.</p>

<p>I thought there was a weight off young Evan' Garrie's spirits,
and certainly mine felt lighter. But our decision brought grief
and distress to Virgil, for the blackamoor did not relish the
return to the North, where he had been so ill-treated and where,
even with two kind masters, he dreaded the climate and the
witches. We persuaded him, however, that when the sun shone
Scotland was not so ill a place.</p>

<p>Yet so desperate seemed the negro that I was minded to leave
him behind in The Hague where lie might find good service among
honest Dutch folk in a town where there were plenty of black
fellows to keep him company.</p>

<p>But the poor slave would be by no means parted from us, and at
the last the dispute was ended, and we all three set sail from
the Netherlands and arrived in Scotland at the end of April, for
we had made a bustle about our journey. We had news as soon as we
set on the shores of Scotland; there were letters waiting for me,
for. I had sent mine by the packet that set sail before the ship
in which we embarked. One was from Colonel Graham, as I had
expected.</p>

<p>The ambitious soldier was prompt to renew his offers. He told
me that he had just returned from Dunkirk, where he had gone to
the Court of France, and that he had finally given over his suit
to the heiress, Helen Graham. He told me this publicly because
the matter had been much blown abroad. He wrote to me as one man
of quality to another, and said he was resolved by all means in
his power to quiet the Lowlands, and he conjured me to join his
troop.</p>

<p>As we proceeded inland, I was still doubtful of my
destination, and met on every hand by the reports that Colonel
Graham was appealing for more soldiers with which to keep the
country down, and I was half minded to join him where he then had
his headquarters at Falkirk. It might be better for the country
if the fanatics were silenced.</p>

<p>Nor did Evan Garrie raise any objection to this plan.</p>

<p>At our first stop we had the news that was told us by the
innkeeper (I thought with relish) of the murder of Dr. Sharp, who
had now at last been paid for his double-dealing, and the
ambition that had made him betray his party.</p>

<p>This brought to my mind with much uneasiness the picture I had
seen in the slab of polished jet. Like a puzzle suddenly fitting
into place, it came to me who were the people I had seen in that
vision&mdash;the man in the coach, the woman who had been haled
forth. I could not be surprised at the murder of my Lord, who had
been for long the most loathed man in Scotland, and who always
went with soldiers about him, for lie was afraid of an attempt on
his life. It had been, as I have written, the execution of the
sentence on James Mitchell, a young man and a preacher of merit
and piety, which had roused the final fury that had destroyed the
Archbishop. This James Mitchell had missed my lord when he had
fired at him as he was entering his coach at Edinburgh, but his
companion, the Bishop of Orkney, had been wounded in the wrist
and had died, like Philippa's brother, from a gangrene, though
some years afterwards. Therefore Mitchell was, in one sense of
the word, a murderer.</p>

<p>But his brethren considered him a martyr, and some of them
resolved to avenge him in a mighty fashion that should set the
whole Government trembling.</p>

<p>The crime took place on Magus Moor; well I remembered that
gloomy place and the men who had stopped us there. Some of these,
I believed, were the same, local squires or lairds, as they
termed them in Scotland, Hackston of Rapphillet, Russell of
Kepple, and John Balfour of Kinloch. These were not men of good
character, and the last had been steward to the Archbishop and
accused of dishonesty, and Hackston was Balfour's brother-in-law,
and had been his baillee.</p>

<p>Yet it was not my lord for whom they were waiting but for the
Sheriff, whom they intended to murder.</p>

<p>These men were true fanatics and highly exalted both by their
fear of God and their dread of Satan. They believed they were the
chosen ministers of the Almighty, His weapons to purge Scotland
of the persecutors. And when they saw the coach of the Archbishop
approaching, that they knew by the liveries of the outriders,
they resolved to endeavour to kill the wizard who was the curse
of Scotland, as they named him. Not that they felt much hope for
this enterprise, for they believed that my lord was protected by
satanic powers.</p>

<p>The coachman driving six horses endeavoured to outdistance his
pursuers; by a chance, unlucky to my lord that made the attackers
believe that God had delivered the persecutor into their hands,
he was that day without his usual band of armed protectors. We
heard that he had looked out of the window and cried. "God help
my poor child, for I am gone." This being related with relish by
the murderers.</p>

<p>The horsemen gained on the coach-horses that had the heavy
vehicle to encumber them, and the coachman's desperate efforts to
keep them off with the long thong of his heavy whip was
unavailing. First a postilion was shot and then a horse lamed and
the coach being then at a standstill, the poor animals on top of
one another, these desperate men fired a volley into it, shouting
to my lord. "Come out, Judas! Come out, you cruel, bloody
traitor!"</p>

<p>At that, the old man, who had always been a formidable
personality and had his own courage&mdash;though the zealots were
not so wrong in the words they threw at him, for double-dealer
and traitor he had been&mdash;opened the door and looked at them
piteously, begging for mercy so the murderer's report went, and
that was a foul thing to hear, for he was an old man and had his
daughter with him. Balfour said, too, that the hand that he put
out to shield the poor, unconscious woman, was cut off at the
wrist-bone. Then his murderers, "worthy gentlemen of courage and
zeal for the cause of God," as the Covenanters termed them,
believing that the old man was invulnerable, hacked at him
desperately with their swords until he was but a bloody heap of
broken bones, his brains scattered on the fresh spring
heather.</p>

<p>Still they were not satisfied but plundered the coach, turning
over all the baggage they found therein, the persons, the
servants, the swooning daughter, and the clothes of the dead man,
in order to discover my lord's familiar spirit.</p>

<p>And when at length one of them opened his horn snuffbox and a
bee flew out, they thought they had it; one of them, who struck
down and trampled on the insect, was counted a saint whose piety
had defeated Satan.</p>

<p>And so they rode off, singing hymns of triumph.</p>

<p>I could understand how the rage of Colonel Graham would be
roused by this, for I heard that he had a reverence for the
Archbishop, since the days when he had been a student at St.
Andrews and Doctor Sharp set over him. Garrie asked me what I
made of this bloody killing. I could see both the right and wrong
of it, and I could not deny that if these men had been persuaded,
as it seemed they were persuaded, that Doctor Sharp was one of
Satan's captains, bringing blood and misery on Scotland, then
they did well to dispose of him, even in that barbarous manner;
the daughter and the servants had not been slain.</p>

<p>We found as we rode south-west that this murder of the
Archbishop had put great heart into the Covenanters, or rebels,
whichever one might choose to call them, who were daily becoming
stronger, many who were before timid or dubious now coming
forward to join them, now that the great wizard was slain.</p>

<p>'When by the end of May we reached Falkirk, we found
Claverhouse established there with his Horse, and good store of
munitions. Here we heard that Mr. Richard Cameron had been as
good as his word and, with some of his fellow preachers, was
excommunicating the King and declared submission to him to be
unlawful.</p>

<p>Richard Cameron had gone with a great following, in company
with Robert Hamilton and other insurgents, to Kilbryde Moor, not
far from the city of Glasgow, to hold a great meeting.</p>

<p>They had won this openly, and the Conventicle had been
appointed out of contempt for the festivals to be held on the
birthday of His Majesty.</p>

<p>We learnt, from the different tales and rumours that came our
way, that there were to be more than a thousand men there, who
were well armed and made no secret of their proceedings, which
were to consist of burning four Acts of Parliament, those that
were in favour of keeping the King's supremacy and in favour of
episcopacy. For this was but a just return, they argued, for the
perfidious and presumptuous burning of the sacred Covenant.</p>

<p>This defiance the Covenanters followed by putting all these
matters into a declaration which they pinned to the Market Cross
of Rutherglen.</p>

<p>This information was gathered while we were in Falkirk.</p>

<p>We lodged at a poor inn and attracted no attention in all the
bustle and commotion there was in the town. Though I had Colonel
Graham's letter in my pocket, I was still not sure whether I
wished to become one of his dragoons, and Evan Carrie was still
more hesitant.</p>

<p>He was the one who settled the matter by declaring that he had
at last made up his mind to join the persecutors. I think he was
considering how he stood with Jannot Garrie, and I, too, had
Isabelle in my mind, and I thought that if we joined Claverhouse,
not only should we be persecuting people whom I held in my heart
to have the right of it, but we should be in league with those
whom we had fled from in Castle Drum, one with those termed
witches, warlocks, and imps of Satan. Supposing that we drew the
sword to clear the Covenanters out of Wigtown and Galloway and
Lanarkshire?</p>

<p>Should we not set up a reign of evil in that wretched and
distracted country and lose maybe our own souls and our own wits?
If the Covenanters won we might save these women from peril and
evil.</p>

<p>So being agreed on this matter, we crept out of Falkirk though
it was not so easy for stout men to escape when Claverhouse was
clamouring for fresh troopers, but we contrived it, something I
think by the terror inspired by the appearance of Virgil that
made us respected and even feared.</p>

<p>And trusting to Evan Garrie's knowledge of the country we made
for Rutherglen, that is but a quiet village, but found that the
Covenanters had left it a little while before.</p>

<p>There we stayed a while, uncertainly; then a peddler coming in
told us that Claverhouse, with Lord Ross, whose troops he had
joined, was marching towards Rutherglen, having made some
prisoners at the town of Hamilton. And this same peddler, whom I
took to be but a Covenanter spy, learned that the rebels had gone
towards Loudon, and there we, having spent the greater part of
the money in our pouch on fresh horses, found them encamped.</p>

<p>There were nearly two thousand of these stern people, among
them many with whom I had been familiar at The Hague. Among them
was Richard Cameron, and they had with them, too, their families,
women, and even some children, whom they had encamped in the
middle of them, the fighting men being ringed about like a
wall.</p>

<p>We, even the blackamoor, were given a welcome because we were
vouched for by Richard Cameron, who rejoiced when he saw us, as
if he considered us two straying sheep returned to the flock. In
particular he was tender with Evan Garrie, whom he had taught in
his youth, and whom he regarded almost as a son. Occupied as he
was, and exalted in this moment of dreadful expectation, for all
knew that Claverhouse's dragoons were pursuing them, to break the
Conventicles, he found time to draw us aside and tell us how his
heart bounded with delight that we had escaped the vileness of
Castle Drum and all the snares and baits of the great enemy of
mankind.</p>

<p>It was strange to me to find myself in this camp. I had my
sword and they gave me a carbine and appointed me to a group of
men. Evan Garrie was allowed to remain with me, but the poor
black who showed little courage at this display of force was sent
with those who looked after the horses.</p>

<p>The Covenanters were gathered upon a barren moor which ended
in a wide purplish bog, and was on one side encompassed by a
small bare hill that had the name, I learned, of Drum Clog. We
had not long to wait for the enemy whom the scouts had warned us
were approaching (for so to me Colonel Graham and his troops had
now become), for we saw that morning of Sunday in June the
horsemen appear at the top of this rising ground.</p>

<p>We much outnumbered them I could see at a glance, for I think
that Colonel Graham had no more than a hundred and fifty men; I
suppose he looked at us through his spyglass across the bog. The
day was fair, but there was a little mist about; the foot were in
front, the horse behind. Mr. Robert Hamilton, who was a gentleman
and very zealous, led us; what he knew of soldiering I cannot
say; he had been a pupil of Gilbert Burnet, whom I have heard
speak very ill of him; but now he made at least the show of a
hero.</p>

<p>There had been much praying and singing through the night and
in the early morning; harsh and tedious, I thought it; I had
slept as well as I could, and I had been one of the first to see
that troop of foot and horse outlined against the pale sky, even
before the watchman had fired his carbine and run towards the
kneeling congregation to warn them; but they had long been in
readiness.</p>

<p>The foremost minister was one James Douglas, as I heard him
named; he was an old weather-stained man, he had taken off his
worn bonnet and his grey locks were hanging limply by the side of
his pallid face as he expounded his faith, with his ear cocked
for the soldiers.</p>

<p>There was no fear in his voice when the told the excited
people that they had now "said their prayers and sung their
praises, and it was the moment to put into practice their
theories." They knew their duties, he said, self-defence was
always lawful. Then he uttered a prayer that I had heard on the
lips of Richard Cameron. "Lord, spare the green and take the
ripe," meaning that he was willing to die.</p>

<p>Singing then the tune of a hymn termed the "Martyrs," the
elders, the women, and the children moved apart to a higher
ground where the baggage was and some spare horses.</p>

<p>I wondered if Colonel Graham would really attack us; I knew he
had large powers, but I was not aware whether he would be
permitted to bear down on these people peacefully praying on the
moors. But I learned afterwards he carried in his pocket his
permission from the Privy Council, and that told him that should
he be resisted when dispersing field preaching he should treat
the Covenanters as rebels and mow them down.</p>

<p>I recall that it was a Sunday, and that it made the work, in
the eyes of the Covenanters at least, the more dreadful.</p>

<p>I think they would have turned and gone quietly away, singing
their hymns, had not Colonel Graham and his dragoons attacked
them. Seeing the troopers, profane, rude wretches as they named
them, coming upon them, they turned to fight; a press of stout
men, armed with scythes and sickles.</p>

<p>In my company, as I name it, were many stout Scots armed with
carbines, pikes, pitchforks, and knives. One pleasant youth,
William Cleland, was in command of this band, and he bore himself
in a manly fashion and showed great skill in getting round the
bog in order that we might fall upon the dragoons on the flank.
Here, too, some of the Covenanters were in a ditch or trench with
an old, low ruined wall in front (left from some house, I
supposed, that had once stood there) that served as a parapet.
Here we stationed ourselves, and such as had carbines fired at
the dragoons until the mud and stone was piled with dead and
wounded.</p>

<p>Our young leader was a good soldier, as was the commander of
the whole force, Robert Hamilton, and some few others, but I had
little hopes of our success with such rude, untrained men.</p>

<p>This young man, Cleland, had his Bible with him; I suppose he
had been reading part of it to the Conventicle; he put it down on
the ground and tore some of the leaves out to make wads for his
musket. I heard that several of the rebels had put silver pieces
into their guns instead of bullets, in the hopes of bringing down
Claverhouse who, owing to his pact with the Devil, they believed,
no leaden bullet could slay; I felt cool, yet excited; was this,
I asked myself, a great event?</p>

<p>Bloody as it was, it seemed as futile as trivial. I stared
about me at the struggling soldiers behaving with routine
courage, I smelt the acrid odour of the powder that quenched the
fresh perfume of the heather, and leaning in my place behind the
rude parapet I asked 'William Cleland how they came to have so
many weapons?</p>

<p>"Do you fire," replied he, flushed and keen, "and be silent."
Then he laughed. "They buy the weapons instead of paying
taxes."</p>

<p>I was amused to mark out the white plume that Claverhouse wore
that tossed in the strengthening sunshine as he rode up and down
his breaking line.</p>

<p>I wondered if it would be murder if I shot him now, aiming at
him in the mle!</p>

<p>What a hero that would make of me among the Covenanters; but
the man had been kind to me, was ready to be my friend, and I
liked him well enough.</p>

<p>But this problem was not for my solving, for he never came
within my range. The noise and the smoke increased; Cleland's
face was blackened until it resembled Virgil's dark visage; I
wondered where the poor negro was, and why I, a man of some
philosophy, with nothing to gain from violence, was standing
here, trying to kill some poor devil of a trooper who fought out
of stupidity in a cause for which he could have little
stomach.</p>

<p>It was soon easy to see how the day was going. The trained
dragoons, stubbornly as they fought, were no match for these
desperate men, who so outnumbered them. Their horses were
mutilated by the pikes and scythes, even the famous sorrel
charger that Claverhouse rode was ripped up with a pike. The
agonized animal carried his rider off the field; at one moment it
seemed that lie might be captured, for the frenzied animal bore
him past our trench, and Cleland, our leader, sprang after him
and even had his hand on the bridle.</p>

<p>But Colonel Graham shook him off, and the horse fell dead half
a mile away soon afterwards, I was told, and Claverhouse made his
way off the field on the horse of his trumpeter, and so he
disappeared towards Glasgow and his troop went after him, leaving
his prisoners whom he had with him behind.</p>

<p>The Government had been worsted that day, and for a while, at
least, that was the end of what they called "that bloodthirsty
wretch Claverhouse." I believe, had not his dying horse bolted,
he would have stayed and fought to the last, perhaps choosing
sooner to be dragged down and slain, as was the Archbishop of St.
Andrews, than yield. I saw his face as the animal bore him past
us, and knew his rage by his black look as he flung Cleland down
with his bare hands.</p>

<p>"Where is his glory now?" I thought, as I heard the
Covenanters roar in triumph.</p>

<p>We came up on to the moor then, and joined in the medley. All
Claverhouse's standards were saved, though one of the Covenanters
got into the thick of the horse and had his hands on one; but it
was recovered soon after. This young man's name was Weir, the
same as that of the celebrated wizard. He dropped almost at my
feet, cut down by a flying trooper; it was I and Evan Garrie who
took him up and dragged him to the side where such surgeons as
they had were looking after the wounded, and these were many,
groaning and yelling. Yet what mattered that, or the dead
either?</p>

<p>Though I had joined the cause but recently and in a strange
mood that was certainly not one of godly enthusiasm, yet I was
moved now by the deep shouts of triumph that rose from the small
band of victorious men. I knew that it seemed to them that they
had been directly led and inspired by God and accompanied by
angels, and their battle hymn rose up above the smoke of battle
that blurred the fair day. The man whom they most loathed next to
Archbishop Sharp and Lord Lauderdale had drawn off his broken
troops in disarray to Glasgow.</p>

<p>It seemed as if God was working for them.</p>

<p>It was a strange victory, one of which I began to feel a part;
I thought that these grim men were in the right to demand the
liberty to pray as they would in the open air, as they were
beaten out of the churches, and to defend themselves with weapons
if they were attacked as they worshipped their God. I saw the
strength there was in them; fanatics or enthusiasts, they might
be termed, but was not this fire they possessed the only fire
that should make a man different from a clod or a beast?</p>

<p>I saw a look on young Evan Garrie's face that I had never seen
there before. He seemed washed, cleansed, and purified from his
residence in Castle Drum, from his sad affection for Jannot, the
witch girl. There was blood on his brow and on his hands; he had
been slightly wounded, and I had seen him bring a trooper down
with his carbine. Never would the young man be the same again, I
thought; I was a little changed myself.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>My stern companions had their grim humour, too. Presently,
when the news came in that Colonel Graham had gathered together
his dispersed soldiers, and had turned aside to avoid the rebels
gathered to meet him at Strathaven, Richard Cameron remarked that
Claverhouse "had attended one Whig meeting that day and had
disliked the sermon so much that he was unwilling to hear more of
the discourse."</p>

<p>Such of us as were mounted had pursued the retreating soldiers
as long as their horses could stay, but without being able to
approach Glasgow. There was some talk, presumptuous as I thought,
of an attack on that city, and after decently attending to the
dead and the wounded&mdash;and all this was done with much
order&mdash;and comforting the women and children and such as had
faintness of spirit, the leaders of the Covenanters went to the
house of Lord Loudon, who was a Campbell and a cautious man, not
one inclined, I think, to be a rebel but sympathetic to the
Presbyterians. My lord was not there, perhaps out of prudence,
but my lady entertained us very kindly, there were men of her
rank amongst us, besides our leader Hamilton.</p>

<p>I thought that she would be surprised if she knew my name and
standing. She would scarcely have looked for me, a cadet of the
House of Maitland, in this company.</p>

<p>Even in the hour of their triumph, an unexpected and
delectable triumph, the Covenanter captains were abstemious.
There was little wine drunk and little meat eaten, but they were
all wrought up with religious zeal.</p>

<p>I saw young Evan with William Cleland, a man whom I afterwards
learnt was a poet as well as a soldier. Bold, skilful, and
handsome, I liked him much, and I felt no jealousy, only
curiosity, when I saw that young Evan's affection was likely to
be taken from me and given to this man of his own race and
age.</p>

<p>It was pitiful to see the alarm of Virgil, who had been
deafened by the guns and blinded by the smoke, and sickened by
the sight of blood. The Covenanters, who at first had looked
askance at him because of his colour, now smiled at his terrors.
Many of them were well used to the slaves in Edinburgh, there
were even some in Glasgow, and they treated him with indulgence,
asking me only if he had been baptized?</p>

<p>I lied, as I think I had lied before on behalf of Virgil, and
said that he was a Christian. They desired then that he should
have a Christian name, and I said that he might be called after
our victorious leader, Robert, and the flourish was well
received.</p>

<p>Well I can recall that evening, a lassitude and faint nausea,
a fatigue that was more of the spirit than the body, was over me,
for I did not join in the exultation of these saints. As I have
said, I took them to be in the right, that they were misgoverned,
and had tyrants set over them, but for all that I loved them not.
They were rude, grim, and ianatic.</p>

<p>And I had seen a sight after the battle that had turned my
stomach, that was not apt to be queasy. They had found a young
officer dead on the field, a cornet of Claverhouse's troop. His
name was Graham, and this was on his shirt, so some of the more
ignorant believed that they had got Claverhouse himself. They
proceeded then to kill the devil within the hated captain, as I
suppose. They stuck their knives into the dead body and beat the
head into a jelly, scattering his brains over the stones and
moors as the brains of Archbishop Sharp had been scattered. I
thought: "He who slays by the sword shall perish by the sword,"
but where was the Christian charity?</p>

<p>So my mood was dark and gloomy as I sat in the great hall in
Loudon's House, wondering why at last my lot had cast me
here.</p>

<p>I heard a quarrel going on because the prisoners were spared,
many condemned Robert Hamilton for this clemency; the soldiers
had got off, either by mercy or mischance, and were sure to have
tales to tell of the strength and plans of the Covenanters.</p>

<p>"Evan," said I, "shall we not sleep to-night?" For no one
seemed to have any thought of that; the leaders sat about in the
great hall, that resembled the great hall at Castle Drum, the
younger talking, the elder praying, or reading their Bibles,
while the lesser sort would be heard, when one opened a door to
come to or fro, singing in the barns and sheds where they were
housed.</p>

<p>"What matter for sleep?" he replied wildly; I could see that
he was much unsettled by this bloody event, but William Cleland
answered with a smile that a good soldier should take his rest
when he could. "We may roll up our coats in a corner," he
added.</p>

<p>"Come, Evan," I took the excited youth by the shoulder. "Talk
intoxicates, like strong drink"&mdash;and I could not forbear
bending low to him where he sat and whispering in his
ear&mdash;"What of Jannot now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, accursed! Accursed!" he cried, whimpering like a
child.</p>

<p>But I thought of Isabelle; what mattered it on what side I
fought. I should get to Castle Drum and do what a man might for
her and the other two silly women, despite their spells.</p>

<p>I went to the window and set the shutters wide so that the
summer air came into that place fouled by many breaths, and
leaned out into the light of the dawn, and thought that I could
see the golden light of her eyes in the sunlit vapours that began
to brighten the vanishing night.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>Much heartened by this advantage, many thousands&mdash;and I
do not write loosely, for I remember that they were counted as
they came in&mdash;able-bodied fighting men, armed not only with
their farm implements, but with fusils, joined us, I mean the
main covenanting party under Robert Hamilton during that month of
June.</p>

<p>And the captains, consulting together in Loudon House, where
the lady still entertained us fairly, decided to make a push for
it against Glasgow before the Government had time to well
barricade and garrison that city.</p>

<p>As all the country folk and peasantry were, without exception
as I believe, on our side, we had many messengers and spies
coming in with news. There was not an old woman crossing the
bogs, a boy pulling up weeds or scaring crows, an old labourer at
his cottage door, who did not have some eyes and ears for the
doings of the Government troops.</p>

<p>So we learned that Lord Ross and Colonel Graham in Glasgow had
determined to hold the city, that they had sent riders post-haste
to Edinburgh, where Lord Linlithgow was, he being still in
command of all the Royal forces in Scotland.</p>

<p>It was not so easy for us to get news from the capital, but we
had well-wishers even there, and Robert Hamilton was informed
that the commander-in-chief would probably march towards the west
with all the soldiery in Scotland; they were not many.</p>

<p>At this time the Covenanters were so elated and proud that
they believed that they could overthrow the rule of His Majesty
King Charles, and I being in the midst of them, found it hard to
get the right perspective of their ambition. It seemed even to
me, a man of a wider experience than most of them and one who
from a long residence in London knew the power and might of the
Government, that they might succeed, and make Scotland too hot
for His Majesty's fingers to hold.</p>

<p>I noted that my noble relative, the Duke of Lauderdale, did
not come to Scotland, but remained at the King's ear in London.
Doctor Sharp now being dead they lacked a strong man to hold the
country down, and that the main feeling of Scotland was Whig and
Presbyterian I did not doubt.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie had become one of the warmest of the supporters of
Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Cleland, and I wondered at the lad who had
so long been hesitant and who had now taken up his position with
so much decision. I saw him, too, at the praying and the
hymn-singing, and marked in all his gestures and words a new-born
valiancy. Well,' said I to myself, "there is one who has found
his work. And I suppose that with these zealous and holy men he
will forget Jannot of Castle Drum."</p>

<p>But for me, could I forget?</p>

<p>I still did not know. Sometimes the mood that had come upon me
when I had seen Philippa Dean standing in the door of my room at
The Hague would torment me again, and I would feel a tingling in
my blood and a strange restlessness in my soul. Strange, I say,
for it was not to be explained, as if a magnet drew me towards
that dark and dreary castle.</p>

<p>I learned that Sir Donald Garrie had returned there now, and I
supposed he was in charge of that wild pack of womanhood. I
wondered what the sick boy was doing, and Doctor Fletcher? I
could not think of him without a creeping of the flesh.</p>

<p>I was not, as was Evan Garrie, persuaded of the rights of the
Covenanters to slay as fiercely as they did, although I was
persuaded of their rights to pray to their God in peace. I had
thought that Robert Hamilton had shown a tenderness for the
prisoners after the battle of Drumclog, as they named that
skirmish in the bog.</p>

<p>But he told me roundly to my face that he, being in command
that day, had given out word that no quarter should be given,
meaning that the prisoners should be slain. And he much blamed
the misplaced mercy, as he termed it, of those who had allowed
the Royalists to escape and take information into Glasgow. I did
not like this, as I had not liked the way they had mutilated the
body of Cornet Graham; I might have been named a ruthless man
myself, but that did not make me respect other bloody-minded men,
and I thought that these Covenanters were a long way from the
kingdom of the God of Love.</p>

<p>Yet I remained with them, out of a curious indifferency of
spirit. Here was work to do, and man's work at that, and if they
were fierce and violent the same might be said of Colonel Graham,
who carried his prisoners "bound like beasts," as we were told,
and who would have shot down the whole Conventicle, including
women and children, if he had had the power.</p>

<p>I did not use my name, one accursed to these people, of
Maitland, but termed myself after my mother's family Thomas
Findlater. I had shown sufficient zeal and forwardness at
Drumclog for my English name and accent to be overlooked, and
William Cleland, who had become so close a friend to Evan Garrie,
sought out my company during the march and the conferences. He
was a man of a sensitive spirit and liked the intelligent and the
scholarly. I could have had many profitable discourses with him
and taught him much, for he was thirsty after the classics, and
longed to improve his knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages.
But what time had we for such things?</p>

<p>At the end of the first week of June found us not far from
Glasgow. We had advanced a few miles at a time over a country
wholly friendly; there was no one against us except a few
Royalist troopers. Knowing Claverhouse as I did, I expected to
find that he had made preparations to receive us.</p>

<p>And so it was. The city was guarded and barricaded, about the
market cross, the town house, and the tolbooth, and a brisk fire
received the first attackers. We lost many in that assault but
went forward again.</p>

<p>I was with the party that tried to force up the Gallowgate,
but we found it impossible to penetrate far into the city owing
to the murderous fusillade that met us from the closes, the
street corners, and the windows of the houses. When we fell back
we had left many dead in the streets and several prisoners.</p>

<p>On gaining the open ground again we found that the other
detachment, that Hamilton had sent by the College, had also
retreated, and the entire army of the Covenanters withdrew, but
in good order.</p>

<p>We were not unduly dispirited by this reverse. The town of
Hamilton was our next headquarters, and there our numbers were so
augmented that we were nearly seven thousand armed men
strong.</p>

<p>Our scouting parties brought the news that was as welcome as
unexpected, that Ross and Claverhouse had abandoned Glasgow, on
command as one supposed, from Lord Linlithgow in Edinburgh. These
tactics seemed, to even my small experience, foolish. It appeared
to me as if the commander-in-chief was faced with a situation
with which he did not know how to deal.</p>

<p>We learned from our spies that he had called his two captains,
Ross and Claverhouse, and all their troops at Bonnybridge, there
to meet him and to discuss future operations.</p>

<p>This left the West of Scotland in our power; Robert Hamilton
lost no time in marching on Glasgow, and the undefended town was
peacefully occupied.</p>

<p>I wondered how the news of these activities sounded in London.
I had many a grim smile to myself as I considered the
countenances of His Majesty and the Duke of York and his
counsellors at St. James's when they learnt that those whom they
most loathed in the world&mdash;this was certainly true at least
on His Majesty's part&mdash;had seized the second city in the
kingdom of Scotland.</p>

<p>We were for a while unmolested, and the days fell into a
curious pattern of prayer-meetings and conferences and debates
that were sometimes cool and sometimes excited.</p>

<p>'William Cleland and Evan Garrie were always in the midst of
the deepest disputes, and I saw little enough now of the lad whom
I had taken with me from Castle Drum to The Hague.</p>

<p>The news that came from without seemed to show a curious
inaction on the part of the Government. Our numbers swelled with
every day that passed, for all those who believed in the
Covenant, and they certainly seemed the majority of the residents
in the Lowlands, rode up to Glasgow to increase our garrison.</p>

<p>I heard that my good relative, His Grace of Lauderdale, was
endeavouring to raise fresh troops as well as to call out the
militia. Those who daily rode up to Glasgow told us that all
bridges and fords were guarded and that it would not be so easy
in future for sympathisers with the Covenanters to reach Glasgow,
since all armed men were likely to be arrested.</p>

<p>'We had news, too, of a trifling reverse. Some of the
Presbyterians coming from Fife were dispersed by the Master of
Ross, who killed a good part of them and took several prisoners.
This, that was termed the skirmish of Bewly Bog, with its tale of
so many slaughtered and so many prisoners sent to meet a
criminal's death in Edinburgh, whipped up the Covenanters in
Glasgow to one of these furies that I had witnessed among them
before.</p>

<p>I marched with them to Rutherglen by the middle of the month,
where Christian burial was given to some poor miserable relics
that had fallen into the Covenanters' hands during their late
success. These were the heads of those Presbyterians who had been
put to death after the Pentland rising.</p>

<p>This epitaph was written, I forget by whom, either on these
martyrs, as they termed them, or on those others whose heads lie
at Hamilton:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">Stay, passenger, take notice<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What thou reads.<br>

At Edinboro be our bodies<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here our heads,<br>

Our right hands stood at Lanark<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These we want<br>

Because with them we swore<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Covenant.</p>

<br>

<p>Evan Garrie came to me after this ceremony, which had been
accompanied by great ecstasies of prayer and hymn-singing, and
asked me uneasily if I thought the Covenanters had not reached
the dangerous confidences given by success?</p>

<p>For he had learned by the last rebels who had ridden up that
the Duke of Monmouth was to be sent from London as
commander-in-chief in Scotland, bringing with him English troops.
It was said that there would be near six thousand of these when
the reinforcements were joined to the army under my Lord
Linlithgow; he had heard, too, and this I could only too readily
believe, that the King's bastard brought letters of fire and
blood with him and that he was instructed to enforce the law unto
the death of all who might be suspected of treason, and to pursue
the obstinate rebels who should remain in arms with all the
extremities of war until they should be absolutely reduced.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "what else did you expect? Did you think,
Evan, that the King would allow Scotland, which, after all, is a
jewel in his crown, to fall from him and make no effort to
reclaim it?"</p>

<p>Then Evan Garrie confided to me that he doubted as to the
leadership of the Covenanters. The captains argued and the
ministers disputed among themselves too much and too long; there
was no unison.</p>

<p>"I thought," said he, "that the Lord had called for this
service at my hands, and I wished to venture my all for Him. And
seeing that the Covenanters own to be for the Lord, I judge
myself obliged to own and assist them. But now sometimes I fear
that the Lord is not with them, that they have no authority and
discipline and there is much division among those that should
have guided the rest."</p>

<p>I could not stay my mockery at this.</p>

<p>"Do they not say, and the saintly Richard Cameron among them,
that the Lord will provide, the Lord will protect? Well, you have
made your choice, Evan. You thought, as you say, that you saw the
Lord's hand in this, that you are doing his service. It is a
great thing," I added, "that you have found God's hand in
anything. As well shed your blood in that cause as in
another."</p>

<p>Them I asked him roundly if he ever thought of Jannot Garrie?
He would not answer me, but turned aside.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>It was a few days after this that we in Glasgow, having news
that the King's son and his troops were advancing on us, went out
to Bothwell's Bridge to meet them. We were not yet combined into
an orderly army; there was, as Evan Garrie had said, disputes
among the leaders, and the fanatic ministers stirred up revolt
those who were in lay authority. Yet there was no breaking in the
spirits of these Presbyterians, who were resolved to fight to the
death "the King of England and the legions of Satan," as they
termed Charles Stuart.</p>

<p>All knew the Duke of Monmouth's Proclamation that had been
cast over the country. Mercy was to be offered to such as would
lay down their arms, save those who had murdered the Archbishop
of St. Andrews; we used such of these as came our way for musket
wads.</p>

<p>It was another Sunday when we came in sight of the Government
troops, who had already planted their cannon on the bridge that
spanned the River Clyde at the little town of Bothwell.</p>

<p>There was a service held before the action, and the words were
wild and inspiring and lifted even my indifferent soul for a
moment into a noble exaltation.</p>

<p>"The Lord God of gods, He knoweth in Israel, we shall know,
that if it be in rebellion or in transgression against the Lord,
save us not this day."</p>

<p>Our end of the bridge was protected by our only cannon and had
a brave man behind it; horse and foot was behind him; across the
bridge was the Government artillery being put into position.</p>

<p>I noticed that there was not the confidence among the
Covenanters that there had been at Drumclog; we were clearly
outnumbered, and Monmouth was thought to be a good captain. Many
of our men were unarmed, and we lacked ammunition. Robert
Hamilton found, to his dismay and fury, that barrels he thought
had contained gunpowder were instead full of dried fish&mdash;a
mistake or a treachery that was likely to prove highly
inconvenient.</p>

<p>When I heard, after the matter had been for an hour or so
disputed, that Robert Hamilton had offered a parley and the Duke
of Monmouth accepted, I volunteered to go with the two clergymen
who, with a drummer, rode forward to speak to the Royal
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>We crossed the bridge, and found the young Duke not many yards
from the head of it. I had seen him often enough in St. James's,
but did not suppose that he would recognize me now in my rough
attire, with my hat pulled over my eyes, my face unshaven, my air
rude and harsh. And I think His Grace was in no mood to recognize
his best friend had he seen him then, because he was deeply
troubled. A gay, light-hearted and humane man, he could not have
liked this task.</p>

<p>His face, womanish in its perfection at one time though now
slightly coarsened by debauch, was flushed and his words
hesitant, gentle, and contradictory as he spoke to the
rebels.</p>

<p>I saw Claverhouse close behind him on another roan horse, as
like as possible to that that had been slain at Drumclog, and I
thought that the scowl on his cool face was because of His
Grace's hesitancy and tenderheartedness, for Monmouth was
courteous and showed himself a moderate man. And I thought of
William Penn, there were few peacemakers in the world, and it was
surely a notable thing to have met two of them.</p>

<p>And while they were talking&mdash;the plain Scots and the
affable Duke, who, for all his cuirass and plumes, seemed to me
an easy courtier rather than a man of war&mdash;fantastic
pictures were passing through my mind of that city of brotherly
love in the New 'World where perhaps men like His Grace of
Monmouth, gentle princes might have found their ease and pleasure
in sport and art, with simple-minded, gracious men like William
Penn for their ministers.</p>

<p>Then I remembered the sharp antidotes to these sick fancies,
the words of His Highness, the Prince Stadtholder. And I knew
such thoughts&mdash;and why should they have come to me on the
eve of a battle?&mdash;to be vainillusi ons. I sat there
patiently on my rough horse, for I was not spokesman of the
party, for more than an hour while the Duke, with good-humour and
courtesy, tried to persuade the rebels to spare much slaughter by
laying down their arms.</p>

<p>This they refused to do.</p>

<p>They had, and I could not but admire their steadfast courage,
their own terms to make. And these must have been allowed just by
any reasonable man. The spokesman of the Presbyterians demanded
that they should be allowed to exercise their religion as they
pleased, that the old oaths for the abolishing of the Covenants
should in their turn be abolished, and that a new General
Assembly of free, unbiased men should be called to consider
coolly and to debate wisely the troubles of Scotland in Church
and State.</p>

<p>Well I knew that His Grace of Monmouth, if it had been in his
power, would have granted these conditions gracefully and gone
with a light heart to his wine or his repose or his sport. But he
was the tool of the Government only, and though he spun the
matter out as long as he could, being, though a brave and
efficient soldier, a man who loathed bloodshed, the moment came
when the negotiations were broken off and I had to ride back with
the envoys to the waiting army of the Covenanters.</p>

<p>There was soon a general engagement. As we had but one cannon
we were finally driven from our posts by the fire of the Duke's
artillerymen, though desperate charges and our one gunner had
chased them off at first.</p>

<p>It was a hand-to-hand engagement in the end, in which I,
beside Evan Garrie, took my part; it was soon a wild medley, so
many of us were unarmed, and could but stand and be shot, or run
like cowards.</p>

<p>Once, twice, spurred on by the roaring shouts of the old,
unarmed, unbonneted ministers who bawled to them the warrior
words of the Old Testament, the rebels rallied.</p>

<p>Rebels, say T, I found it difficult to rid myself of this word
having been bred in conventional loyalty to His Majesty King
Charles, but I was glad to be fighting in these ranks, glad,
even, to forget the noble birth of which I had been so blackly
proud and to have as my brothers in arms these poor countrymen,
many of whom had no weapons, others having nothing but scythes or
pitchforks. They believed that they struggled against the cohorts
of Satan, and I was glad to lead them again and again in that
part of the field where I found myself against Claverhouse's
troop of horse.</p>

<p>But what could we do against the cavalry and the artillery?
Our ranks broke, the dead lay about in heaps, the blood drying on
the torn flesh in the heat of the June day, and those who were
mounted rode wildly away. Hamilton among them.</p>

<p>It was Claverhouse's cavalry that drove Robert Hamilton off
the field, I heard afterwards&mdash;at the time I knew nothing
but what was happening around me. I fell back in the pursuit with
the others, I heard myself roaring a hymn. Two ministers and two
standards that the Covenanters carried about with them were
captured by an officer who rode up close to us, but I was left
for dead on the ground, I suppose. I was somewhat blinded by the
blood that was falling into my eyes from a cut on my brow; but I
was not greatly hurt, and rolled over to find beside me Evan
Garrie, who was more gravely wounded than I, and I had, as best I
could, to get him off the field. It was Virgil, the poor
blackamoor, whom I knew to be a timorous creature, who somehow
had managed to keep close to me in the press, who came up to me
now with a fresh horse, that he, quick and clever despite his
terror that his affection had overcome, had found loose on the
field and captured; he had been hiding with the baggage, but had
come out when the mass had thinned.</p>

<p>Between us we got Evan Garrie on to the horse, and I made
Virgil mount behind him and gave him my orders to ride westward
out of the affray as best he could.</p>

<p>My own horse had been killed earlier in the day, and I had
fought on foot, but I, too, secured another mount&mdash;there
were a number of riderless horses then galloping across the field
by the river-banks. And before Garrie and the negro were out of
sight I contrived to follow them.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>So I escaped from the battle of the bridge over the Clyde by
the town of Bothwell, and so avoided an ill fate. Cla verhouse
covered his name with more infamy than it already possessed in
the minds of the Lowlanders by his ruthless pursuit and slaughter
of the Cameronian saints, at least, this blame was given him by
the Whigs. A number of prisoners, no less than a thousand it was
said, were taken to Edinburgh; there being no place large enough
to contain them, they were all set under guard in the churchyard
of the Grey Friars. There, to conclude this mention of their
fate, they were kept for nearly half a year, sleeping on the
ground, living on such scraps of food as charity offered them.
Such as refused to subscribe to the Government were finally
shipped to the West Indies.</p>

<p>The two hundred of these who were lost in a storm near the
Orkneys were the most fortunate, for the rest were sold as slaves
in Barbados. Whenever I heard this tale I thought it related the
most cruel fate that could ever befall a man, for I had known the
pride, the stubbornness, the black obstinacy of these
Covenanters. Who was less fitted to play the part of a slave to
some insolent and ignorant Englishman?</p>

<p>Many active rebels were beheaded in Edinburgh, their quartered
limbs set up over various market towns.</p>

<p>As the three of us fled across the country, not knowing
whither we went we were overtaken by other fugitives from
Bothwell Bridge. And all had the same tale to tell of bloody
slaughter. I thought to myself that it might have been the same
had the Covenanters got the victory. I knew what they did, their
women as well as their men, to such of the soldiers who fell into
their hands. But that did not make the burden of death and
suffering the lighter on the wretched country-side.</p>

<p>Where were we to go? Evan Garrie was grimly wounded, and hurt,
too, in his mind, as I thought, for he was talking about the
victory of the warlocks and the witches and of Satan having got
the upper hand in Scotland, and of the Lord having forsaken his
saints.</p>

<p>I was able to give him some repose in a cottage where a woman
sheltered us at the peril of her own life for a few days and
nights. There he lay in a fever, not knowing what he said. We
nursed him as best we could. All my property and my money had
been left behind in Glasgow on the field at Bothwell Bridge; I
had only a little brandy stolen from the cellar of the Bishop at
Glasgow when we sacked the palace.</p>

<p>By chance we escaped the searching troops; the Duke of
Monmouth was riding through the rebellious districts and as none
came forward to meet him he believed that the followers of the
Covenant were dispersed for ever. So confident were the
Government in their success that the militia was disbanded and
the King's bastard returned to Edinburgh before the end of the
month.</p>

<p>I heard afterwards that he had been much abused, not only by
his uncle, His Grace of York, who had always much disliked him,
but by his father, the King, for his clemency towards the rebels;
His Majesty had always loathed the Presbyterians of Scotland, who
had inflicted many sharp humiliations upon him when he had been
in their power. And now he was reputed to have said to his son,
"Had I been at Bothwell Bridge there would have been no trouble
about prisoners."</p>

<p>But all these matters I learnt afterwards. For the moment my
concern was with my own affairs. I think I had not realized
before into what position I had put myself by joining the
Covenanters. Not all my influence with His Grace of Lauderdale
would help me now, indeed no doubt he, who was a sick and failing
man, gross of habit and dull in mind, would not endure to hear my
name mentioned again but would be glad of my rebellion in order
to wash his hands of me. I had now no hopes of regaining my
estates, even if I had been able in some way to find some money
to purchase them. All I possessed would be forfeit through my
treason had I been present at Drumclog and with the Covenanters
in Glasgow. If I was not sent to join those wretches herded in
the churchyard at Grey Friars I might be hanged in Edinburgh, as
were the ministers who had been captured at Bothwell Bridge.</p>

<p>I now fully counted the cost of my rash and, as it were,
indifferent act. I had thrown away my hopes of the future,
perhaps my life. But indeed, I did not quite understand why I
wished to preserve my life. Philippa was gone and had been lost
to me from the moment when she had stood on my threshold in that
comfortable room in The Hague. That Philippa had not been the
dear love of the English days whom I had always seen against a
gentle background of a Kentish garden with the red roses blowing
against the red bricks of her pleasant home. She had been a woman
harassed and pursued, stained by remorse and shame, offering me
not a high affection but a backstairs intrigue.</p>

<p>And there was Isabelle.</p>

<p>I thought of her every day more frequently as we made our
painful progress westward, three men on two horses&mdash;the
negro and I taking it in turn to support Evan Garrie in front of
us. I feared that he might be smitten by gangrene, for he was
wounded in the leg, the arm, and the brow. But it seemed that
these things go by chance, for I have known many a man to die in
agonies from a lesser hurt. Why, the scratch that I gave
Philippa's brother was not so severe as the least of Evan
Garrie's gaping cuts. But the washing out that I had given them
of wine at that cottage where we had first stopped seemed to have
kept the flesh wholesome, for the edges of the wound dried and
came together under the bandages, and the youth, being strong and
lusty, recovered from his loss of blood.</p>

<p>And when we had been two weeks or so going about the country,
hidden always by the country-folk who in this killing-time,' as
it was afterwards termed, offered their all to those pursued by
the Government, Evan Garrie was as healthy as he had been the day
before Bothwell Bridge. In his body that is, I thought his mind
was clouded, his senses almost overcast.</p>

<p>He seemed to have forgotten much that had happened to him
since I had taken him from Scotland. He looked askance at the
faithful negro, as if the blackamoor's face alarmed him. But the
earlier part of his life he remembered well, and he constantly
urged me to return to Castle Drum.</p>

<p>"That," said I, "would be to walk into the arms of the enemy.
We might meet Claverhouse himself there, for Sir Donald Garrie
stands for the Government."</p>

<p>"It is my home," said the boy sullenly, "and I want to see
Jannot and Isabelle again."</p>

<p>I wondered if these women would, in extremity, hide us, and a
torturing desire to put this question to the proof assailed me
through the long bitter days and nights of that pursuit that
seemed endless.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>We slept in caves and on the moors, behind what whins and
bushes we could discover. We wandered over tracts of land,
mountain passes fit only for the fox and the eagle, quite unknown
to me. We had guides, children or old women, who saw us from
place to place. We never lacked some food, even if it was but a
cup of water, a plate of oatmeal cakes. Sometimes we got a piece
of meat and even good brandy.</p>

<p>But finding myself no better than a hunted hare affected my
mind as well as my body. The last became taut, hardy, and alert,
the first became subdued and quivering at the sound of a broken
branch or a footfall in the distance.</p>

<p>And I could see no end to this slow torment.</p>

<p>Even if we could get to the coast, what money had we with
which to buy the meanest passage on the meanest ship? We had
joined in a moment, on my part at least, of utter wilfulness a
party that had been defeated. I had lost even my name, there was
no one to whom I could now appeal.</p>

<p>Evan Garrie, too, was cut off from what he still termed his
home. The negro was a wretched slave, dependent on the charity of
those who could no longer protect him.</p>

<p>We had, soon after the first week of our flight was over, to
abandon our horses, not being able to maintain them. Besides, our
paths often lay down glens and up rocks, where it would have been
impossible for the animals to have gone.</p>

<p>So, as fugitives, we existed in this country that to me was
certainly accursed, until one night when we had taken shelter in
a cave, and I slept heavily from sheer weariness of broken
spirit. And when I woke Virgil was watching by me.</p>

<p>He told me that Mr. Garrie had gone.</p>

<p>I thought, as the blackamoor gave me this news in the grey
glimmer of an ugly dawn, that I must follow this boy to whom I
had, in a manner, pledged myself. Although he had forsaken me for
the company and the affection of William Cleland, still he had
turned to me again and I had heard him say nothing of that worthy
since we had fled from Bothwell Bridge, and I had nursed him
through the sickness caused by his wounds. There was no doubt
that the attention the blackamoor and I had paid him had saved
his life. But what was any man's life worth in these times?</p>

<p>And as Virgil gave me the story, and I made him repeat it more
than once in order that I could be sure of it, I wondered if I
should follow Evan Garrie or not.</p>

<p>What did it matter if he sought shelter in Castle Drum or
whether the ladies there gave it him, or whether he was caught
and slaughtered on the heather, or dragged to Edinburgh and there
tormented before his death?</p>

<p>As happened afterwards to that man David Hackston of
Raphillet, who had murdered Archbishop Sharp, who was tried about
a year after this date, condemned and taken, bound with irons,
barebacked on a horse with his face to the animal's tail. First
his right hand was cut off, then his left, and then he was
hanged, and while still alive his heart cut out, exposed on the
point of the executioner's knife and thrown into a fire. Such
was, commonly enough, the fate of those who followed the
covenanting captains.</p>

<p>And I knew that it might be the fate of Evan Garrie were he
captured by one of Monmouth's soldiers.</p>

<p>Nay, it might have been the fate of all three of us had we not
had so many friends among the humble peasantry who were engaged
to pass us from one to another and to hide us in the glens, the
passes, and the mountains.</p>

<p>We had heard, too, the tales brought us by the whisperers, who
passed us news in secret, that the Duke of York was coming to
Edinburgh to control the country, and knowing him to be as black
a Papist as Richard Cameron and his men were black Covenanters, I
could see the fate of Scotland in the few months to come.</p>

<p>All these considerations were thrusting into my mind as I
listened to the tale told by Virgil. We now were but two and had
no horse between us, and I wondered what we should do or how
proceed on our way. And I sat musing awhile in the murk of the
cave, idly tracing with my right hand that had been no great use
to me either with pen or sword, either in fighting men or
caressing women, a name upon the damp mud on which I lay
stretched. A cluster of heather had been our sole bed and our
food but some porridge and a drink of water.</p>

<p>The blackamoor was steadfast in his tale. Evan Garrie had
roused him while it was still dark and told him that he was
impelled to go towards Castle Drum and begged him to give a
message to me when I should awake, saying that that was his
destination and nothing could keep him from it.</p>

<p>I could understand the meaning of these words; Evan Garrie had
been drawn towards Castle Drum by the incantations of Jannot, or
so at least he supposed.</p>

<p>The woman had gotten into his blood, into his mind, into his
spirit, and he could by no means resist her. Although I had taken
him away from her enchantment, although he had lived with me
peacefully for a while at The Hague, although he had joined the
fanatic Covenanters who were so many zealots out for the blood of
such witches as Jannot Garrie was reputed to be, still he had
turned again steadfast to her spell.</p>

<p>And now he was gone, to his certain death it might be, for how
did I know whether Sir Donald Garrie would shelter his kinsman or
deliver him to the Royalist troopers?</p>

<p>I looked down at the name I had written in the mud and saw it
was "Isabelle." If one golden-eyed girl lured Evan Garrie, did
not the other lure me?</p>

<p>"Virgil," said I, "we, too, will go to Castle Drum."</p>

<p>He remembered the place and began to gibber in fear. And then
I was minded, out of curiosity, to ask him if he had been present
at the ruined chapel the night before he had attracted my
attention standing in the doorway of the Castle. I could get no
sense out of him on this point.</p>

<p>He said he had been wandering for some time since he had run
away from the Netherbow in Edinburgh, and it might have been that
he had slept in a corner of the ruins of the chapel the night
before I had seen him.</p>

<p>Well, there was no bottom to be found to this. I was convinced
in my own mind that Virgil had nothing to do with the nasty
business in which Doctor Fletcher and the ladies of Castle Drum
were undoubtedly concerned. But I thought that I might have seen
him when I had supposed that the great black man at the foot of
the stairs had been Satan himself.</p>

<p>And I remember that I stretched myself out on the floor of the
cave and crossed my hands in front of my face and rested these on
my poor bed of heather and thought miserably of the tangle that
my life had been since first I had met Philippa.</p>

<p>But the blackamoor was pulling at my coat, and it was a
question of action. Yes, I would go to Castle Drum also.</p>

<p>I had not the small hope on which Evan Garrie might be
relying, for I was no kinsman of the house but a stranger, and
one whom they might consider had played the traitor and the
renegade. I had fought with the Covenanters; everything I had or
might have had was forfeited. It even gave me an ugly
satisfaction to think how stripped I was.</p>

<p>We left our place of refuge as soon as it was light enough for
us to see our way. Now that I had lost Evan Garrie I had no sure
guide, and the negro knew the country even less than I did.</p>

<p>We never failed of a welcome or a shelter at the huts where we
stayed. Once we came upon a conventicle; even after Bothwell
Bridge and the killings that followed it and the fierce revenge
taken by the Royalist troops upon the Scottish people, these
proscribed ministers went forth to hold their services of prayer
and praise in the waste lonely places, the watchman standing
above them on the rising ground and the armed men ready with
their hands upon their weapons.</p>

<p>And when I saw these people again, still valiant after their
great misfortune, my heart went out to them once more, and I was
not sorry to suffer in their cause.</p>

<p>Stern and grim as they were, they received me kindly. I was
soon able to identify myself as the Englishman who had so
suddenly and unexpectedly joined them, and they treated me, and
even the negro, well.</p>

<p>These men, too, set me on my way towards Castle Drum. They
exclaimed much that I should be going near such a dangerous
place, and they said that Sir Donald Carrie had fortified it and
that a troop of Claverhouse's soldiers were within the walls, for
they had feared an attack from the Covenanters. But the man who
told me this admitted that, for the moment, the spirit of the
Presbyterians was broken. Too many had been slain, too many made
prisoners, too many scattered, for them to be enabled to make any
attack on any place, whether fortified or not.</p>

<p>I asked after Richard Cameron and whether he had fallen into
the hands of the enemy. And they assured me no, but that aged and
valiant man was still going about the country, setting up where
he could a copy of his Declaration that excommunicated King
Charles and absolved all the Scots from allegiance to him.</p>

<p>All this matter was but dusty to me now, never had it
interested me very greatly. I pecalled with the longing of a man
in a desert for water the sweet peace that was promised by Mr.
William Penn's scheme, and I wished that I had never come to
Scotland but remained rather in London, where I might have some
hope of going to America with that gentleman. It was some while
since I had been in The Hague that I had had any news of him, but
it was pleasant in that gloomy summer&mdash;for though the sun
shone the days were dark to me&mdash;to recall that there had
been such a man and such a plan.</p>

<p>With only the negro for company I fell silent and therefore
disconsolate. There was no one to whom to voice my doubts and
fears; hopes and joy I had none.</p>

<p>We were set on our way by such peasants as succoured us, and
on the second day after we left the conventicle in the hills we
came within sight of Castle Drum.</p>

<p>I remembered with what relief, even with what joy, I had left
it, and how I had stared back at its dark outline on the horizon
with a malicious pleasure, as if I said farewell for ever to
those grim walls and all the corruption that they enclosed.</p>

<p>But I had returned, my destiny had come full circle. Useless
had been the attempt at peace and resignation in Holland, useless
the wise words of the stately Prince to whom I had spoken,
useless all the sayings and arguments of those pastors and
philosophers to whom I had listened in the clubs and at the
conferences in The Hague.</p>

<p>Here I was returning, a wild and broken man.</p>

<p>As I stood upright on the heather, I looked but a vagabond and
was, indeed, no better than I looked. I had lost all the
attributes of a gentleman, even my sword&mdash;that had been
first lost then broken and was a fitting symbol, I thought, for
my thought, for my condition. I had but a short Scotch dirk, as
they termed it, and the negro the same; our fusils, or carbines,
had long been lost, and if we had contrived to keep them they
would have been useless, for we had no ammunition. The poor
people who sheltered us were also without weapons, and we should
have met a speedy death had we chanced on any soldiers, for not
only were we without means of defence but we had been for many
days so foot-weary that we would not have been able to take to
flight.</p>

<p>So stood I, with my clothes torn and soiled, my face unshaven
and my hair tangled, looking at that domain which had been at one
time accursed to me and which I had left in a moment of pride. I
looked down at the negro and saw that his face was grey, an ugly
and a fearsome tinge that it took when he was frightened.</p>

<p>I remembered Doctor Fletcher and felt sick; I did not wish to
see the women in the state I was then in, and I wondered how it
was possible to get a message to Evan Garrie, or even if he was
still in the Castle.</p>

<p>We waited until the dark fell then made our way, by slow and
cautious marches, until we approached the building, and came
within sight of the ruined chapel.</p>

<p>The moon was high and full; it was then, so long had our
adventures taken, towards the autumn, it would be the beginning
of harvest in England, as I supposed, but here in this bitter
north I had seen no sign of reaping and garnering of the grain.
And whatever poor harvest Scotland might have usually, that year
there was little but that of blood in the Lowlands.</p>

<p>I and the negro were both exhausted from long walking and from
lack of food, we had had but little that day, and I found myself
at the foot of the tower, where, with Evan Garrie beside me, I
had looked down on those satanic revels, or whatever that
hallucination might have been.</p>

<p>There we rested, too exhausted to move, drawing ourselves away
from the moonlight as best we could, into the shadows. Virgil,
who was still in my service, as if I had been the great gentleman
that once in my black pride I had affected to be, pulled some
ferns and heather and made me the pillow to which I had been now
for many weeks accustomed; then laid himself down across my feet
in the manner of a band-dog.</p>

<p>I was soon asleep, scorning myself for this lassitude of the
flesh, for it had been in my mind to make an attempt at once to
creep up to the Castle and under disguise of my ragged appearance
to get into the kitchens and so find some news of Evan.</p>

<p>Was it Evan for whom I had come? Was it not rather for another
of whom I wished news? I did not allow myself to debate this
point but fell asleep, drawn away in that broken wall of the
chapel, away from the moonlight that streamed, for all I knew,
from the windows of Hecate, who is the goddess of all dark things
of the night.</p>

<p>My dreams were sweet and gentle as they had not been for some
time. I returned in my sleep to my earlier thoughts of Scotland
and to those strange ballads that I had read carelessly in
England, of Thomas and the Queen of Elfland, and those dark-green
shades to which she led him on her pearl-white steed.</p>

<p>Across my dreams came oddly the writing on an old posy that I
had known long since:</p>

<p>They say what likes them, let them say: I care not, but love
thou me, it's good for thee.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; ISABELLE</h2>

<p class="first">
WHEN I awoke Isabelle was gazing at me, She wore a dark-grey
hood that matched the sky, then at the dawning, and held it under
the chin as Philippa had held her rich red fox fur when I had
last seen her standing on the threshold of my room at The
Hague.</p>

<p>I raised myself on my elbow, not believing this to be true.
She motioned with her free hand for me to be silent, and sat down
upon a large block of fallen masonry.</p>

<p>The negro was asleep, his face was grey like ashes, wretched
and hollow-cheeked in that colourless light. I looked at him
without seeing him and then again at her.</p>

<p>She began to sing as if she did not see him, a little song
that I believed might be for my enchantment:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

"Oh, my love, leave me not! Leave me not! Leave me not!<br>

Oh, my love, leave me not, leave me not alone!<br>

With one burden on my back,<br>

Love this burden from me take,<br>

Or else I am gone.</p>

<p class="verse">

With sins I am laden sore. Leave me not! Leave me not;<br>

With sins I am laden sore. Leave me not alone!<br>

I pray thee, sir, therefore,<br>

Keep not my sins in store.<br>

Love me, or I be forlorn, and hear my moan."</p>

<br>

<p>"Cease," said I, "cease!"</p>

<p>And I could not raise my voice above my breath.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

"I cry, and I call to thee to leave me not, to leave me not!<br>

I cry, and I call to thee to leave me not alone!<br>

All they that laden be,<br>

Thou didst come home to me!<br>

Then shall they stay with me, through thy mercy alone!"</p>

<br>

<p>"Do you speak to me, Isabelle, or to God?"</p>

<p>I tried to rise, but could get no further than my knees. A
cold wind blew from the east, where the colourless light was
stirring, in eddies with the clouds.</p>

<p>She clasped her hands, and not looking at me, and her eyes
seeming blank indeed, whispered in her moaning song:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

"Faith, hope and charity, leave me not! Leave me not!<br>

Faith, hope and charity, leave me not alone.<br>

I pray thee, Lord, grant me<br>

These goodly gifts free.<br>

Then shall I say with Thee, doubts have I none."</p>

<br>

<p>"Why," said I, "Isabelle, do you sing this hymn to me? Or is
it a love-song? And who are you, Isabelle?&mdash;a witch? Or the
Queen of Elfland, or the daughter of Sir Donald Garrie only?"</p>

<p>She turned and looked at me then and said:</p>

<p>"Poor Tom Maitland! You are much changed since you left Castle
Drum!"</p>

<p>"Where is your kinsman, Evan Garrie?" I asked her. I had
contrived to rise, though I was weak to my very bones, and leant
in the broken arch.</p>

<p>"He's safe enough," she said, "ay, and hidden."</p>

<p>"How did you find me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd come," she said. "We go out to watch for you
every night, one by one, round the ruins, round the ramparts,
even on to the moors. Come, you must not remain here now, the
light's rising and the sentries may see us. Bring your
servant&mdash;he is faithful, I see."</p>

<p>She took my hand and led me, by her side, away from the Castle
until we came to a place behind the ruins where was a small hut
that had been built with the fallen stones. There she had
prepared a comfortable chamber; there was a low pallet bed with
blankets on it, there was a jug of milk, a plate of cakes. And
there, too, was even the travelling toilet-box that I had left
behind at Castle Drum.</p>

<p>She went away without saying anything more, neither giving me
instructions nor warnings. The negro had followed me, and when I
had eaten I gave him what was left of the food, for the fellow
would never stay his stomach until I was satisfied.</p>

<p>I did not care to look into the mirror that was let in the lid
of the toilet-box. I was sorry that she had seen me in this rough
array. I was glad to see my comb and razors and to be able to
make myself more civilized in appearance. But this seemed a
profane interlude in what had been like a dream.</p>

<p>When I had eaten and drunk&mdash;and the food, though plain,
was satisfying&mdash;when I had washed in the ewer she had set
there and dried myself on the clean rough napkin, I felt more
equal to facing her, trying to come to terms with my destiny. My
clothes were still ragged, but I had more the appearance of a
gentleman and little less that of a vagabond. I remembered the
odd luxuries there had been at Castle Drum, the days when they
used to set wax candles on the tables, the other days when there
was nothing but a tallow dip on the pricket. Now she had brought
out her best for me&mdash;linen, and the plate on which the cakes
stood was of silver with the Garrie arms engraved on it.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said I to Virgil, "what power this lady has to
hide us?"</p>

<p>I talked to the negro because there was no one else to speak
to. But he looked at me dumbly, terrified on returning to this
place but never faltering in his fidelity to me.</p>

<p>Ah, if Isabelle and I and Jannot and Garrie could escape from
Scotland, its black saints and its black witches, and its
overshadowing of Satan and its ugly murders, and go with Mr. Penn
to his New World, where there would be plain and fruitful fields
of corn, large and lightsome streets and stately buildings, and
we could live for ever in peace!</p>

<p>Isabelle came to see me with no great pretence at, nor concern
in, secrecy, and I remembered how, during my residence in Castle
Drum, the three ladies had seemed to rule there with a freedom
that at that time I attributed to unholy spells.</p>

<p>But now the master of the house was at home, and I asked
Isabelle how it came that she was able to hide me not far from
her father's residence, and come to me, as she seemed to come,
fearlessly.</p>

<p>She had brought a change of garments with her, and I noticed
that these were like everything else in Castle Drum, mingled mean
and rich. There was a purple scarf with golden tassels, a strange
gaud to bring a man in hiding; there was a hat with spangled
plumes that might have belonged to some mountebank player. And
there was, more comfortable than these, a cloak of lamb's
wool.</p>

<p>These she laid on the ground, they had concealed a basket of
the earliest apples of golden colour and fragrant smelling that
she put on the table where she had before set my food.</p>

<p>"My father, Sir Donald," she said, "is a sick man. When Doctor
Fletcher is not by his bedside he is by that of David, and there
is daily talk as to which shall die the first."</p>

<p>It did not please me to hear her speak thus coldly of her
father and her brother, although I knew she could have but little
affection for either in the nature of things. But whatever had
pleased me about Isabelle Garrie? She had nothing changed during
those months in which so much had happened to me.</p>

<p>She had come into my rude hiding-place, that I was ashamed to
take from her charity with as light a step as she had moved into
the great stone hall behind me when I had been her brother's
pedagogue. Her eyes had the same golden look as if there was a
star behind them, and her tawny-coloured hair was smooth in the
shadow of her hidden grey hood. Her thin face was a little
pinched and wan and not now, any more than it had been before,
beautiful. I noticed that the hands that she had once tended into
whiteness for my care had now been treated negligently again and
seemed stained with work.</p>

<p>And what work should Isabelle Garrie do, who had a castle full
of servants at her disposal?</p>

<p>But what I had noticed most in her discourse was this mention
of Doctor Fletcher. I said to her roundly:</p>

<p>"I take that man to be a warlock. Though he is grey-haired he
has a miserable countenance, and I take his condition to be the
most pitiful and miserable known to mankind. But," added I,
hotly, "he is indeed in league with the Devil."</p>

<p>"Leave Doctor Fletcher," said she, in a soft and dulcet tone,
that she did not always use, "tell me why you have returned
here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said I, sullenly, for I was a man trapped and
cornered like a beast taken in the net, "because you cast your
spells on me. They say that witches can raise the wind, ay, and
bring Venus out of the sea, I doubt not."</p>

<p>"Do not speak so loud," she said, "and tell your blackamoor to
keep guard at the door. I suppose he is a faithful monster?"</p>

<p>I was ashamed that I had been betrayed into a loud-voiced
protest. I gave directions to the black man, whom I did not care
to see against this background, for he reminded me of that odious
night I had spent in the chapel ruins now at my hand.</p>

<p>"I have," said I, "a difficulty to divine the dream from the
reality of these matters. I have endured many pains since I left
you, Isabelle. Indeed, I know not why I returned. My heart was
set upon another woman and she filled, as I thought, all my
thoughts. Yet when I was away from Castle Drum I saw it in
visions, and I tried to cut a path for myself through thickets of
doubts, tried this way and that to reach up to God until I joined
the Covenanters."</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, and repeated, "the Covenanters. And if they
had beaten the Royalists at Bothwell Bridge as they beat them at
Drumclog, would you have marched with them on Castle Drum, to
burn us all as witches?"</p>

<p>"There's witchcraft here," cried I. "No doubt of it! But I put
the blame on Doctor Fletcher. Was he not known for a wizard when
a student at Prague, and afterwards at St. Andrews in the days of
Doctor Sharp?"</p>

<p>"His black arts did not save him," smiled Isabelle. "He was
hacked to pieces on the moors as if he had no friend to protect
him. Tell me, Thomas Maitland," and she leaned towards me, "what
have you seen in this place that makes you talk so much of
witchcraft? You know that if you blow this reputation abroad we
could be all arrested and tormented to our several deaths."</p>

<p>"What was the vision," said I, sullenly, "that I saw in the
jet? What was it I saw "&mdash;and for the first time I brought
these evil, ugly dreams across my lips, "in the chapel the night
that Evan Garrie took me there? Loathsome things that made me
leave Castle Drum for ever."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said she, "you were bewitched."</p>

<p>"Ay," said I, "you and Jannot and your stepmother, Sir Donald
Garrie's wife, were in that enchantment."</p>

<p>"You are," said she, "touched with conceit and vain
phantasies."</p>

<p>"I am," said I, "a vagabond. What do you mean to do with
me?"</p>

<p>"So you've lost everything," said she, in a compassionate
tone. "You had little enough, Mr. Maitland, when you came here
before. It was almost charity you were taken in then. We tried to
treat you as a worthy guest, knowing your quality, and then you
must run away and join those fanatics who say that we are in the
pay of Satan."</p>

<p>Something in the way that she said these words that was wild
and beautiful brought me in sudden and bitter mind of the peril
in which she stood, not only from the Covenanters but from the
Royalists themselves. The King was as eager as were his
rebellious subjects to set Commissions up to deal with witches,
and well it was known to every sober man throughout the length
and breadth of Great Britain that Scotland was infested by the
diabolical arts.</p>

<p>Isabelle perhaps saw the terror in my face for she spoke
again, in softer tones:</p>

<p>"What is this witchcraft of which you speak? What do you think
I know? Do you think that I shall give disease to cattle or to
children? That when I hurt my hand I can give the pain of it to
another woman? Do you think that I can take a baptized cat on the
lake and raise a storm? Do you think that I go out at night and
dance naked on the heath with our witch-wives round the black man
who is Satan?"</p>

<p>I thought I heard a note of human pleading in her voice, but I
would not answer her. I said:</p>

<p>"What of Evan Garrie?"</p>

<p>Isabelle sighed and turned away. She had taken a little stool
in the corner of the hut; I noticed jealously how it was arranged
as a refuge. It was concealed behind the blocks of fallen masonry
and the wild plants, the mountain ash and fern, in such a manner
that one might pass and never see that there was a shelter there.
For whom had this secret retreat been arranged? Was it the hut
where Doctor Fletcher worked his spells?</p>

<p>"You have an affection for Evan, I think," she said at last.
"My father received him again. Sir Donald is a man who is very
troubled. He has never recovered the anguish he felt when he
heard of the murder of his friend, Doctor Sharp. But for a chance
he would have been in the coach with him, and often he wakes in
the night now groaning out that armed men are dragging him over
the heather to cut off his hands and batter out his brains. For,"
said Isabelle, sadly, "these are not merciful men whom you would
join, Mr. Maitland."</p>

<p>"Who shall find mercy in Scotland," said I, "for it is a dark
place! I came here but to hear the fortunes of Evan Garrie, if he
has returned to his bondage."</p>

<p>"Bondage." cried she, softly. "Why, he has returned to his
home, and I tell you that he has received my father's mercy. He
has forgiven him that he fought with the Covenanters at Drumclog
and Bothwell Bridge, that he was with the rebels in Glasgow. He
will hear nothing of any of those things, he thinks that the lad
was led astray, and by you, Mr. Maitland, who have played a
double part&mdash;not only in our house but in Scotland."</p>

<p>Perceiving her to be angry, I changed the discourse and spoke
to her fairly, until she had given me some account of the young
man for whose sake I had come, by such tedious marches to so
perilous a place.</p>

<p>From what I could learn from her, and she spoke as if the
subject held no great interest, Evan Garrie had returned to his
old position in Castle Drum&mdash;neither a servant nor a
retainer nor a friend, but a neglected kinsman, idle for the most
part and at a pinch doing what work was given him, content that
he might be under the same roof-tree as Jannot.</p>

<p>Yes, he had returned to the woman whose spells had, as I took
it, ruined him before. And I believed that she had found him now
an easier victim because of the wound he had received and the
scant nursing he had had.</p>

<p>I had noticed while we were on our flight together that his
speech was slow, his thoughts often confused, and that he seemed
as those do who are a little ruined in their senses, drawn nearer
to that invisible land; that world we dread to know about yet we
are sure is there, and that those who are whole in our wits only
visit when asleep.</p>

<p>"You'll not save Evan Garrie now," said Isabelle. "Jannot has
him for ever."</p>

<p>"Does she love him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I do not talk of love," said Isabelle. "I sense that there is
some bond between them that shall end only with the staying of
their breath, and you've but wasted your time by taking him away
to a strange land and to fight in the rebellion."</p>

<p>"Well, I have lost a friend," said I.</p>

<p>"Not so," said Isabelle. "He is not lost, though he shines in
another's heart."</p>

<p>And I looked at her and she at me, as well as we could see one
another in that obscure light.</p>

<p>Only a glimmer of the sun glow came here and there where the
masonry was badly joined, for over the entrance a skin had been
cunningly hung and a bank was in front, but a few feet away, so
that anyone might come in and out without being observed.</p>

<p>"You and I are old," said I, "under one demeanour or
countenance we have existed in all the ages. We are lovers
however we may be named or whatever we admit to ourselves, with
whatever cunning devices and quiddities we try to amuse
ourselves."</p>

<p>"Lovers!" said Isabelle, softly. "You came back here to name
me as a witch."</p>

<p>"Whatever I name you, you know what you are. Nothing is
explained between us, yet all is known."</p>

<p>"And what have you to offer me," said she, whom I took then,
in my weariness, to be witch or fairy, but certainly no mortal,
"if I leave Castle Drum and all these broils and follow you?"</p>

<p>"What should I have to offer? You know me a vagabond. The last
meal I had was by your charity, the next will come from your
pity. And after that I shall go, taking the poor black with me,
to wander down the breadth of Scotland until I find a man to slay
me, if I can, in honourable fight. It is more likely that I shall
receive a shot in the back or have my brains beaten out as I saw
those of Cornet Graham beaten. For I have been a double-minded,
unstable man."</p>

<p>And I thought of all my own unsettled doubts and wavering of
mind. My life had been uneven because my heart, which was the
string of my life, had been at odds with itself.</p>

<p>And I remembered what I had read in the book of some divine,
that a man that is not agreed within is like the motion of the
sea, of himself ever fluctuating to and fro according to the
natural instability of that element and at the same time exposed
to all the tossing of the waves that arose.</p>

<p>I had thought that I loved Philippa Dean. For her sake I had
ruined myself in a worldly sense, taken blood, though
unwittingly, on my foolish hands. And then when I had seen her
again I had looked upon her as but a commonplace person, of a
frail and fading nature, who had no special privilege of beauty
or grace or godliness.</p>

<p>And I had come back here to Isabelle Garrie, who sat now on
the stool in the corner and looked at me where I rested on the
poor table she had provided. And what had she that was not also
frail and doomed to fade?</p>

<p>And I thought "the grass withereth, the flower thereof falleth
away," that we were all of us at our best and brightest but
shallow streams that would run into the river, that would in its
turn run into the sea and be lost for ever.</p>

<p>"Have you," said she, "any mind to fight further with the
Covenanters?"</p>

<p>"I have no mind," said I, "to fight with or for any man. Yet
their cause is just and they have always the right of it. And I
liked the mighty words they spoke, and something of the breath of
God is in their old, wise men. There are no Doctor Fletchers
among them," said I with a grin. And there came into my mind some
of the words I had heard spoken before the battle of Bothwell
Bridge, about the desirable and beautiful sight of God's glory in
His own temple. I remembered how the old man&mdash;was it Richard
Cameron or another?&mdash;had said that "though for a small
moment He had forsaken us, yet with great mercy He will gather
us. He has lifted up our enemies that their fall may be the
greater, and that He may cast them down in desolation for ever.
Arise, and let us be doing, for the Lord of Hosts is with us, the
God of Jacob is our refuge."</p>

<p>"And who are you," said Isabelle, not with mockery but sadly,
"to think of mighty words and stirring speeches who sit now in a
dark corner like an owl, a defeated man?"</p>

<p>I was fatigued, my mind was not steady.</p>

<p>I had come to the end of a long journey, though it had been
but a journey in a circle. I had considered&mdash;lately as my
poor shallow wits allowed&mdash;many things, the nature of God's
dealing with man, the nature of man's dealing with his fellow. I
had listened to the wisdom of that heroic Prince, the
Stadtholder, in Holland, and there had been nothing in that for
me. And I had refused to fight for the great ones of the earth,
even though I thought their causes good. I had fought instead for
these zealots who in much I disliked.</p>

<p>I had considered the scheme of Mr. William Penn for shaking
off his shoes all the soiled dust of the Old World and
endeavouring to plant a new country in the New World.</p>

<p>And where had all this brought me?</p>

<p>I had lost that brilliant and now broken love that had got me
into this plight, and I found myself entangled with one who was
witch or fairy, or common clay, I knew not what. And I had
returned again to this antique, melancholy residence where I had
never been happy, sloth had softened my bones, and my plight was
no better than that described by Mr. William Cleland, by whose
side I had fought in a poem he wrote.</p>

<p>I had seen these words that he had written when we were in
Glasgow, finishing for his amusement an old poem that seemed to
have been scribbled by a madman gazing at the moon through the
grating of his cell window.</p>

<p>Mr. Cleland told me that he had written this paper when he had
been a youth of eighteen in the college of Edinburgh, and now and
then when the affairs of the world lay heavy on him and he wished
to distract his loaded spirit, he would add another verse. I
heard it the night they sacked the cathedral in Glasgow and fired
the spirit in the Bishop's cellar.</p>

<p>I said the words now to Isabelle, and she listened, and her
golden eyes sparkled as if I recited to her an incantation:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

"Fain also would I prove this:<br>

By considering<br>

What that which you call Love is:<br>

Whether it be Folly,<br>

Or a melancholy,<br>

Or some Heroic thing!</p>

<p class="verse">

Fain I'd have it proved by one whom love has wounded<br>

And fully upon one his Desire hath founded,<br>

Whom nothing else could please, tho' the world were rounded.<br>

Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou go?"</p>

<br>

<p>"By these foolish rhymes," said I, "I speak to you, for no
sense and reason can I offer you, either for my being here nor
for what I say."</p>

<p>And I added some more of the crazed verse written by the
Covenanting poet:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

"Hallo, my fancy, hallo!<br>

Stay, stay at home with me.<br>

I can thee no longer follow<br>

For thou hast betrayed me<br>

And betrayed me;<br>

It is too much for thee.</p>


<p class="verse">

"Stay, stay at home with me.<br>

Leave off thy lofty soaring;<br>

Stay thou at home with me and on thy books be poring,<br>

For he that goes abroad, lays little up in storing,<br>

Thou art welcome home, my Fancy, welcome home to me."</p>

<br>

<p>Isabelle clapped her hands and laughed when I had
finished.</p>

<p>"That is all the matter there need be between you and me," she
said. "No reason, debate or argument!"</p>

<p>It may be that we did not say all this on one occasion, it may
be that there were two or three occasions on which she visited me
in that little cell behind the ruins. But when she had gone I
used to put down in the poor sheets I had still preserved, the
highest matter of these discourses, and thus I found it written a
long while afterwards.</p>

<p>I think she came no more than two or three times to see me,
bringing food and even a few books, for she knew that I found
comfort in the written words of wise men. Greek and Latin writers
she brought me, and I remembered the volumes as being among those
that had stood by the side of the sick boy.</p>

<p>I was not greatly concerned with the health of David Garrie or
with the long, dreary illness of Sir Donald, his father, and I
soon ceased to have any interest for the affairs of Evan Garrie
and Jannot.</p>

<p>Isabelle and I were all that concerned me, and would, I
thought, in this world and the next&mdash;if there be such a
world.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>There was much freedom in this strange retreat. At night poor
Virgil and I would go and walk abroad, contentedly, and not
afraid of either the legions of Satan or Claverhouse's dragoons,
for there were many wide and waste spaces where we could walk
unperceived, and in this manner we stretched our limbs and got
fresh air into our lungs.</p>

<p>I began to think of life again. So far the sum for me of many
months of existence had been this return to Castle Drum. And now
I was here, and now I knew why I had come, I began to think how I
should continue with my days. And the more I thought of this the
more I was enamoured with Mr. William Penn's project. And I
thought if I could take Isabelle and Virgil with me, and perhaps
Evan Garrie and Jannot, we might yet have a fresh lease of days,
and that all this in the memory would seem poor and tawdry,
bloody, and ill-favoured.</p>

<p>But I, being, as I have so often said, a vagabond, did not
know how to put this design into execution. I had, too, the black
man dependent upon me. He was still the property of another man,
and might, were I to be captured, be claimed again by the
goldsmith of the Netherbow.</p>

<p>Isabelle was like a bird from a bough or an animal escaped
from its hiding-place. She had nothing to suggest as to the
future. If she loved me or would follow me for caprice, I did not
know which, I had not asked, but I felt that our destinies were
intertwined as the rose and eglantine that grew from the lovers'
graves in the ballad.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, she had nothing to say as to what the
days might bring us. She occupied herself in her tender duties to
us; we had food enough and water, and even wine. And well I knew
that her stepmother and her sister must be in a connivance with
her or she would not have been able to bring these things from
the Castle without being noted.</p>

<p>Then there came a peak in our affairs when Sir Donald Garrie
died. Isabelle did not weep for him, or mourn; she had not seen
him often, he had usually been harsh with her. But while the
funeral was taking place, and they made a long and dreary
business of it, a wild ceremony in that wild place, she did not
come to me, and I felt as if a curtain had fallen between me and
the sun.</p>

<p>"Virgil,", said I, for I had no one to talk to save the poor
black, "we must get somehow to London, and I must wash the past
away from me, and see if I can begin again."</p>

<p>I remember, I think it was when I was saying these words to
him or some other occasion soon after the death of Sir Donald
Garrie, that a hare ran past our retreat. The skin that hung in
front of the door had been drawn a little aside, for we had
become careless with much security, and the animal, so fleet and
beautiful, bounded in and bounded away again. I saw the negro, it
was at the break of the day, and I had been sleepless for many
hours, groveling on the floor in terror.</p>

<p>It flashed upon me that he believed the hare to be an
enchanted creature, and I remembered that Isabelle, mocking me,
had danced about on the wooden floor, reciting what she declared
to be a charm&mdash;"Hare, hare, God send you fear! I am in a
hare's likeness now, but I shall be a woman e'en now! Hare, hare,
God send you fear!"</p>

<p>When Virgil could recover his speech he babbled out his fear
that the hare had been one of the ladies of Castle Drum.</p>

<p>I looked out into the light that was strengthening over the
ruined chapel, and the beast was no longer in sight. Her swift
leaps had carried her, I hope, safely to her forme. And if it
should have been Isabelle, would I have held her nestling in my
bosom or cast her to the dogs, who, maybe, were behind her, as a
thing accursed?</p>

<p>I believe that this made me consider with great seriousness my
position. And I decided that I would, once and for all, solve the
problem of the future. If not by untying of the knot, then by
cutting of it, as Alexander did the Gordian twist.</p>

<p>Isabelle came down that morning&mdash;I had seen her once only
since her father died&mdash;and seated herself on the stool in
the corner, as was her wont, to make with me random discourse.
But I was changed, by I knew what subtle alchemy of the spirit,
and though I still had not a penny in my pouch nor a sword by my
side, I was resolute to try my own fate.</p>

<p>"Isabelle," said I, "I remember there was an arsenal on one of
the great rooms on the ground floor of the Castle, find me there
a sword that is not too old-fashioned a make and bring it down
here to me, with the belt appertaining, if you may find it."</p>

<p>"And to whom will you do a mischief?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have no wish," said I, "to shed anyone's blood. I find
myself in peace towards all mankind, but it is fitting that I
should go armed as a gentleman for what I am about to do."</p>

<p>She seemed frightened at that and asked if I would deliver her
up for a witch.</p>

<p>I did not answer, and her fears increased, and she spoke like
a child when she confessed piteously:</p>

<p>"Doctor Fletcher has offered to teach me many strange things,
and I have been out with him at night on the heath. And I have
seen faces in the smoke that forms in the spray cast up by his
crucible. And at times he has blinded my sight and made my speech
unsteady. But I could swear to you by any god you like to name
that I am no witch, that I know no evil arts."</p>

<p>I remembered how she had been bred in that lonely Castle among
superstitious folk. I did not care to dwell on the strange powers
that Doctor Fletcher might possess; nay, I believed that Isabelle
herself might have them, but all I could answer was that all this
was nothing to me.</p>

<p>She brought me the sword; by then she never refused to do my
bidding, not that I asked much of her. It was the most modern
weapon that she could find in her late father's arsenal, but
dated back to the time of the father of His present Majesty.
Still, it was fitted with a baldrick, and I was glad to feel the
leather over my shoulder again.</p>

<p>Thus armed according to my gentility, and my attire made as
neat as the care of Virgil, still a good body-servant, in these
adverse circumstances could make me, I took Isabelle by her
little wrist and bade her take me to the next gathering of
witches, the <i>Sabats</i>, as they termed them, that might be
held within a man's walk of Castle Drum.</p>

<p>She looked at me long and earnestly with those eyes of liquid
golden light, and I could only read in her glance the keen
questioning of bewildered child in asking whether what she does
is right or wrong?</p>

<p>"You might hold me cursed," she said, "you might deliver me up
to the tar-barrel."</p>

<p>I comforted her away from thoughts of such foul treachery by
saying that as we went to meet the Devil and his legions, and as
I was but one human man, and not godly at that, all the force
would be on her side.</p>

<p>She seemed hesitant and reluctant, and I knew not yet whether
I was in the right of it or no. I seemed to see a light, but it
was far distant and much clouded over.</p>

<p>Still, at length she was persuaded. She came to me one chilly
night in October; no snow had fallen yet for the northern summer
had been long and sweet in the Lowlands, though the Highland
hills were white. I told her that Virgil must be of our company,
for the poor wretch was too affrighted to remain alone and would
have become a howling madman by the morning had he been abandoned
by the ruins of the old church that he declared to be haunted by
a hundred foul goblins. None of these sprites had I seen, but
they were very apparent to the rolling eyeballs of the
blackamoor.</p>

<p>So we set out, and there was an odd pain in my heart to think
that the girl should be taking me to what she admitted was a
gathering of witches ruled over by some infernal demon. I had set
the request to test her, to pierce to the heart this confusing,
fantastic, and doubtful tale that had been tormenting me ever
since I came to Castle Drum.</p>

<p>I had thought perhaps it would end in moonshine, that like the
fairy gold it would be nothing but a handful of dead leaves in
the morning, and here we were&mdash;Isabelle with her dark
lantern&mdash;and I reflected jealously how easily she came and
went from the Castle, now masterless save for the sick
boy&mdash;Virgil behind us, towards the accursed place where
abominable rites would be held, and Isabelle the centre of them.
The small hand put into mine was like that of a child, and it was
hard to think of her as smirched by those obscene ceremonies that
I had heard the witches held.</p>

<p>We came at last to the place. It was a hollow, boggy as I
should suppose in foul weather, but yet dry and guarded by a
shield of ash trees. The moon that had not shone upon our early
journey had now parted the heavy clouds and the pale light that I
never liked was lying over the scene, a colourless glow that
seemed soiled in its substance.</p>

<p>"Is Jannot coming here tonight?" I whispered to the girl by my
side as we slipped between the smooth trunks of the rowan
trees.</p>

<p>"No," said she. "She seldom comes now, she is occupied in
tending Evan."</p>

<p>And then she told me what I had long guessed, the boy was
becoming daily more cloudy in his mind, and though sweet, gentle,
and happy too, seemed to have lost much of his reason or to be at
the least of it dimmed in his intellect. He was strong still in
his body, and gave no sign of physical disease. And he had
become, Isabelle told me, increasingly dependent upon Jannot, who
had asked her brother's permission for their marriage.</p>

<p>"And so, you see, being a betrothed maiden," said Isabelle,
"she comes no longer to these ceremonies. And I have not been for
a while, thinking you would not countenance it."</p>

<p>"Why did you ever come, Isabelle?" I said. I sat beside her on
a long stone that had been placed there, I think, as a seat for
spectators at these satanic revels.</p>

<p>She did not know. It had been her stepmother who had brought
her first; there had been old women in the Castle too who were
supposed to be possessed of magic powers. All the women for miles
round came.</p>

<p>Virgil stood behind us, I heard him groaning prayers, and when
I looked up I could see his eyes rolling, showing their whites. I
was afraid that with a shriek and a clatter he might fly the
scene of what he supposed would be monstrous iniquities, so with
a stern word I bade him be quiet.</p>

<p>"We must go down and join them," said Isabelle. "We must not
sit here as if we meant to spy on them."</p>

<p>I thought of Mr. Richard Cameron and his courage and his
holiness, I thought of the young Prince, the most admired man of
Europe, to whom I had spoken at The Hague, and I smiled to myself
when I considered what these two men who had found me not
unworthy of serious discourse would think of me were they to see
me now.</p>

<p>I was soon aware of a group of people gathered in the hollow.
They were all darkly dressed, but many of them carried torches or
lanterns. I peered at them keenly, and soon had a chance of close
observation, for Isabelle tugged at my hand as Virgil tugged at
my cloak, and between the two of them I found myself among the
chattering crowd.</p>

<p>There was enough light from the various pine-knots and
lanterns for me to observe closely those gathered in this lonely
and desolate place.</p>

<p>Most of them were old folk, clutching tattered garments about
them from the keen night wind, labouring men and cottage wives,
not to be distinguished from those who had helped us on our
flight after the battle of Bothwell Bridge.</p>

<p>Here and there was the fresh face of a younger woman, younger
men I did not see. Everyone there was credulous, ignorant,
bemused, I thought, with idle tales and sick fancies, and the
horrors of these bloody times.</p>

<p>Very different was this from the scene that I had observed
from the old tower of the ruined church. All was commonplace,
there was no sense of evil, of dread, or of the marvellous. I
could not believe that here were gathered any envoys either from
Hell or ambassadors from Fairyland.</p>

<p>Amid these wretches, many of whom I doubted not were doomed to
torture and the stake, moved Doctor Fletcher, whose weak, keen
face was drawn in fretful lines. He had on some kind of tawdry
robe stuck with stars and held a staff in his hand.</p>

<p>I kept well out of his way; no doubt he would recognize me,
though I was much changed since first I had come to Castle
Drum.</p>

<p>But he was in some manner of trance or swoon, and going round
and round with staggering steps, with closed eyes and slavering
lips was reciting some gibberish charm.</p>

<p>His audience soon formed a circle round him, and with slow,
capering motions began to execute a clumsy dance. As their old
and tired feet stamped the soft earth I began to feel something
of the vibration of their rhythm, I began to understand, as
uncouth words left their quivering throats, chanting in some
language older than even the rude Scots tongue, that this was the
wretched remnant of some ancient religion far older than
Christianity, and that these were the priests of some god whom
they would not allow to drop into decay, though in the eyes of
most of mankind he was already dead.</p>

<p>Doctor Fletcher seemed the high priest of these poor rites,
but I saw among them a leading fanatic, with a face either
blackened or covered by a. black taffeta mask.</p>

<p>I thought by his gait, for he limped even as he tried to leap
in the dance that became every moment more lively, that he was a
wounded soldier whom I knew, who lived near Castle Drum. Perhaps
the man was a charlatan, and for the sake of a few pence and the
little power he might gain had set himself up as a messenger of
Satan among these rude and ignorant people, who were lonely and
afraid.</p>

<p>And I thought again of glory, the little loathsome glory that
this fellow gained in deluding the wretched, the poor, and the
foolish.</p>

<p>What power had been over me before when I had looked in the
chapel I know not; I think it was some drug that had been put
into my wine by Doctor Fletcher that evening. No doubt, for I was
not discreet, he had learned that I intended to spy upon his
ceremonial and thus had prepared visions to frighten me away, as
he had most successfully done.</p>

<p>Or else in some other way my spirit had been bewitched and
hallucinations put upon me.</p>

<p>For this evening, as I looked with the eyes of clear common
sense, there was nothing to be seen but these mean and distressed
people celebrating, with an enthusiasm that quickly rose to a
frenzy equal to the Covenanters, the long-forgotten rites of some
long-forgotten god.</p>

<p>The old soldier, for such I took him to be, was soon
enthroned. He thrust out his wooden peg-leg and the women
trooping past kissed it. Doctor Fletcher stood by his right hand,
like his priest, and there were howling songs and chants. One
there had the pipes, and these began skirling away.</p>

<p>Then pipkins of drink that I doubt not was strong enough were
passed round, and the people began to screech and sing in a
different key, bending and bowing before those two
figures&mdash;the black man enthroned upon the stone, the vile
and degraded scholar standing beside him.</p>

<p>Was there any difference, I asked myself, between these
worshippers and the Covenanters whom I had heard defying the
powers of evil at Drumclog and Bothwell Bridge?</p>

<p>This, at least, I knew&mdash;that the cavalry of Claverhouse
would ride down these as they had ridden down the Cameronian
saints, for there would be the stake as for the others the
halter.</p>

<p>The moon went behind a cloud and the wind rose, but these
zealots did not seem to feel the discomfort of the bitter
winds.</p>

<p>I drew Isabelle close to me and so got her apart from the
throng that was beginning to whirl and sway in fantastic
patterns.</p>

<p>"There's nothing here," said I. "There's nothing here,
Isabelle, my dear love, but such as are wretched and miserable,
trying to forget themselves even for half an hour."</p>

<p>"There's the Devil in the midst," said she coolly. By her
tranquillity I could gauge for how long&mdash;no doubt since she
had been in arms&mdash;that she, living enclosed, had been
accustomed to these barbarous superstitions.</p>

<p>"There's magic in the world," I whispered in her ear, "but not
here or now. There's strange things done, but not here. Doctor
Fletcher knows some tricks, and has even taken me with them, but
they are nothing."</p>

<p>The blackamoor had followed me. We stood apart, but no one
noticed, I think, our withdrawal, for they were by then, I am
sure, all drunk with their own furies, and the strong drink that
was handed from one to another in the wooden bowls. This seemed
to be brewed by some of the company who were crouched behind the
stone on which the one-legged soldier sat.</p>

<p>I wonder if the man himself believed in his dark and paltry
glory, or whether he was laughing at these poor fools, and knew
well enough that he was but some blear-eyed relic of the late
wars, who had been abroad in his time and learnt enough&mdash;not
to dissipate his own ignorance&mdash;but to bewilder these poor
folk.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, he played his part, and I had to admit that
there was a dignity about him in his tattered red mantle and his
black-horned mask that might have convinced many whose minds were
bemused by ignorance and superstition that here indeed was one of
Satan's lieutenants.</p>

<p>And what was Doctor Fletcher's part in this, I wondered?</p>

<p>That he was a man of great learning I could not doubt. He was
an adept in chemistry, and I knew from the time I had served with
Thomas Vaughan, that son of fire, what strange things were to be
discovered in that science, things that in their effect seemed
magical, but in their causes, as I had seen proved, were but
effects of Nature and logical in their demonstration.</p>

<p>I could not be surprised if these people worshipped the Devil.
The God of the Covenanters was violent and bloody. The Iove and
peace preached by Christ were hard to find, indeed, I think they
were not known at all in Scotland. And it seemed as likely, nay,
as reasonable, to me that men should fall into this extreme of
devil worship as that they should become zealous in the cause of
the God of battle whom the Covenanters served.</p>

<p>These poor fools, at least, did not beat out the brains of men
whom they suspected of magic powers. They would not, I thought,
have the ferocious courage to do so even if they had the chance.
I found them more harmless either than the rebels, the captains
of the Covenanters, or the Royalist troops.</p>

<p>I saw, moving in that murky throng, some women of the better
sort, and that caused me a sickly qualm, and I questioned
Isabelle in whispers as to what part she had ever taken in these
revels? And she replied with great pride of birth that never had
she mingled with them, but when the ladies came she and her
mother and sister sat apart and were treated as queens.</p>

<p>And I remembered that no one had taught her to read or to
write nor taken any concern over her spirit or her mind, and that
it was not strange that she had fallen into these practices, and
I had no marvel that when Mr. Richard Cameron had come to Castle
Drum he had found her as far beyond his grasp as any gauzy summer
butterfly that fed on the honey-heather in the summer.</p>

<p>I put my cloak about her face and led her away, and she came
willingly.</p>

<p>"These junketings and prancings are but folly," said I, and I
spoke with some melancholy and regret, too. "Here is no bravery
of fairyland, or no dark magnificence of Hell, only a number of
poor wretches beguiling their present miseries by thought of
power. And what power have they, Isabelle? Consider that! When
they are captured, can any of them escape the torture and the
stake?"</p>

<p>"They have some power," said she, drawing close to me for
protection against the night wind and looking up at me through
the dark. And I could believe that, I had evidence of it. What of
the slab of polished jet? Both these sisters possessed strange
gifts.</p>

<p>They might be, for all I knew, of fairy birth, as they call
it, lamias or women half immortal, born without souls. All these
things were dark, confused, and inexplicable, and I was not
minded to probe them but take my fortune as it came, and trust
that God would forgive a mortal man his errors.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>I took Isabelle back to Castle Drum that night and left her
within sight of the sentry, for Scotland was still in a state of
lively unrest, and Ross' dragoons still garrisoned Castle Drum,
where now the three women lived lonely with a sick lad.</p>

<p>I slept that night better than I had slept for many nights
before, and in the morning I made my attire as cleanly as
possible, helped by the toilet-box that Isabelle had brought me
and with the help of the blackamoor. And with him arrayed as my
body-servant, with his livery brushed and mended&mdash;he was
skilful in such matters&mdash;I went openly to Castle Drum.</p>

<p>The sentries allowed me to pass, thinking from my demeanour
that I was a friend of the young lord. For, with my newly-spruced
clothes and the black behind me, I did not cut so ill a figure.
And it made me smile at the paltry, shifting fortunes of men to
think that I had lain hidden, a fugitive, for so many weeks
behind the chapel, who had only but to appear decently arrayed
before the castle to be admitted immediately.</p>

<p>The family were at meat, as I knew, seated in the great hall
where I had often broken my rough bread on a silver platter and
eyed Isabelle and Jannot's golden curls across the tapers of
French wax.</p>

<p>At the head, in the chair of the master, that he had only
lately occupied, sat David, the sick lad, his bright hair falling
on his bent shoulders, his face worn beyond his years, and set in
sullen lines of pain.</p>

<p>To his right sat Elspeth; she wore the yellow satin gown and
had a long-stemmed glass in her long hand.</p>

<p>I faced the boy whom I had tried to teach, the learning, it
seemed to me, he would never need now, for I thought that he was
going to a place where all tongues would be alike. Yet perhaps he
had gained some virtue, in the Latin sense of the word, from the
old books that he had read so constantly. He looked at me
straightly now, like a gentleman and master of the place, as I
came in with Isabelle in my hand and Virgil behind me. Elspeth
looked at me keenly also; there was no fear in any of them, yet
they might have thought that I was but the forerunner of some
murdering band of Covenanters, or leading the country-side roused
on a witch-hunt.</p>

<p>Before I spoke to them I took pains to look at Sannot and
Evan. She was by his side, their hands were interlocked, their
eyes turned towards me, not with the intentness of the others,
but rather with a gentle peace, as if withdrawn into their own
companionship they saw the rest of the world but as an immense
solitude. But the youth was happier now than he had ever been, in
this long twilight of his mind, I could not doubt. And witch or
no, Jannot was purged of most of her spells and wantonness, and I
could see nothing between them but pure affection.</p>

<p>And so I came to the foot of the long heavy table and stood
there, a landless, penniless man, and could not but help laugh at
myself.</p>

<p>"I am Thomas Maitland," I said, "who was your pedagogue, since
then I joined the Covenanters and did no good, either to them or
to myself. Now I'm taking Isabelle away with me."</p>

<p>"What old dream is this?" answered Elspeth, and I thought that
there was a note of longing in her voice. "Do you take her away
to some palace in the hills, or has she beguiled you to follow
her across a sea that has no shore?"</p>

<p>"Do not speak to me in riddles," I replied. "I am at no pains
now to sift out the values of these earthly and unearthly things.
Lamiaor witch or Devil's maiden, Isabelle belongs to me."</p>

<p>"It is true," said she, breaking the little silence that fell
after I had spoken. "Wherever he wishes I will go."</p>

<p>"I was at the witch-gathering last night," said I, "and saw
but a parcel of poor wretches, maddened by drink and despair and
cozened by a lame soldier with a blackened face. But it may be
that there are other and more tremendous revels of which I know
nothing."</p>

<p>Then the young lord answered me.</p>

<p>He spoke bravely and with a grave air. Indeed, there was none
at that table who seemed cowed but Doctor Fletcher, who was
fingering the napery in front of him with crooked fingers and
looking at me aslant. I suppose that he was thinking of the
torture chamber and the staple with the iron chain that might be
his fate yet. I had no mind to denounce him or to save the other
occupants of Castle Drum from his spell, for I took him to be a
man of much cunning and deep learning in evil ways.</p>

<p>David Garrie said:</p>

<p>"Take her, Mr. Maitland. I would not stay anyone who would try
to escape from Castle Drum. There are horses in the stable, and
you may take your choice."</p>

<p>He pulled a key from a chain around his neck and sent it
spinning down the table towards us. It stayed half-way, but
Elspeth's hand sent it further to the end of the board and within
my reach.</p>

<p>"Go to the room," said he, "that you know of and is kept as an
arsenal. There is an iron-bound chest at the end, open it, and
you will find some bags of gold. Take what you will for
Isabelle's dowry, for I do not think that I shall need this
earth's coinage much longer."</p>

<p>Doctor Fletcher made a movement as if he would stay his pupil
and his patient, but the boy's pale narrow eyes gave him a sharp
look and the old man fell back, fingering his beard.</p>

<p>"I'll take something," said I. "Nothing is owing to me, I was
paid my fee when I worked here, but for Isabelle's sake I will
take a few pieces of gold to get us safe out of the realm of
Scotland."</p>

<p>I turned to the girl and asked her if she would say good-bye
to her kinsfolk, and she held my hand tightly as she said in the
high clear voice that was like the trilling of a small bird:</p>

<p>"Good-bye to you all, David, my brother, and Jannot, my
sister, and Garrie, her love, and Elspeth, who was a mother to
me! Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"The password," said David Garrie, sinking back into his chair
as if exhausted, "is United in Time. And if any of the soldiers
stay you give them that and say I know of your going."</p>

<p>And so I, Thomas Maitland, and Isabelle Garrie, and Virgil,
the blackamoor, left Castle Drum on borrowed horses and with
borrowed money.</p>

<p>We rode through the darkness and a drifting rain until we came
to Hamilton, where the heads of the Covenanters were buried. We
slept in our cloaks, Isabelle was as hardy as a mountain falcon,
and in the morning we read the epitaph of these men who had been
dead nearly twenty years.</p>

<p>'Why do I recall it now? It seems to chime in with my flight
with my love.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p>That is not the end of the story, but it is all that I care to
set down, save for such general particulars that little touch my
own life.</p>

<p>I married Isabelle in London, and my kinsman, the Duke of
Lauderdale, dying soon afterwards, left me a pretty portion.</p>

<p>This I put into Mr. William Penn's scheme for his plantation
in America, that he was to call Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This proved but a material business, after all. There was
parcelling out of land and buying and bargaining from His Grace
the Duke of York and Lord Baltimore, who had the grants over
those parts.</p>

<p>While this business was going on we lived quietly in London in
a small house that I took furnished in Golden Square, and
Isabelle never left my side day or night, save when I was on the
most pressing affairs about the Court. And I can say no more than
that.</p>

<p>She was my first wife, and has been these thirty years
dead.</p>

<p>While I was urging on the business of our settlement in</p>

<p>Philadelphia, as the city of brotherly love was to be named,
and envisaging a life that was to be sweet and pleasant, where
Isabelle's children and mine might grow up about our knees in a
comely mansion set about with prolific gardens that reached to
fields of noble corn and fine timbered forests, there came the
news to me of how Richard Cameron had been slain in a skirmish at
Aird's Moss, in Ayrshire, and how his hands and head had been set
up over different market towns in Scotland.</p>

<p>Then the plague took Isabelle; laemia or witch or fairy, she
was gone from me in a day and a night and dust lay on the golden
eyes, and I. had no heart nor interest any more in the schemes of
Mr. 'William Penn.</p>

<p>It was as if the finer part of me, all that was capable of
wonder and ecstasy, rapture and delight, had died with Isabelle,
and been laid with her in her linen shroud, her eyes shut with
the first cold-coloured windflowers of the year.</p>

<p>Mr. Penn's plans went awry, too. God did not seem to bless
that undertaking any more than he had blessed the
Covenanters.</p>

<p>I left England and returned again to The Hague, moving like an
automaton, doing my business, eating, drinking, smoking, but with
little heart in any of it.</p>

<p>And as I was a man of substance, some traders got hold of me
and I entered a substantial business, banking and exchange. The
house was situate at Amsterdam, and there I lived for many
years.</p>

<p>Like echoes from a far-off planet I heard of the death of
Claverhouse, Lord Dundee he was then, in the dark defiles of
Killicranky. This was the end of his glory, cut down by a silver
bullet fired by his servant, so they said, and like Archbishop
Sharp had been, to lie mangled on the heather.</p>

<p>And Mr. Penn's glory was but a circle in the water, too, for
all his schemes ended in disputes and difficulties.</p>

<p>And I lived well out of it all, industrious and comfortable, a
man of substance, with a kind and pretty wife who bore me noble
children.</p>

<p>But where was it all&mdash;the worldly glory, the spiritual
glory, the lust for power, the search for God?</p>

<p>I often pondered as I smoked my pipe and gazed into the
fire.</p>

<p>Time soon chilled the old torments, and with every year that
passed they grew less, until I was able with patience to set down
on paper what broken memories I had of Isabelle, of the yellow
satin gown, of the day I had first gone to Castle Drum.</p>

<p>And until he died of an ague caught in that inhospitable
climate, I kept with me always Virgil, the blackamoor, for though
I could not speak to him of these matters, he had been through
these adventures with me, and was one who had been my companion
in those days of pain and ecstasy.</p>

<p>I avoided news of Scotland, but I chanced to hear that David
died not long after my second marriage and that Jannot and Evan
