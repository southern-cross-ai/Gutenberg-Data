  <br>

  <p class="first">THE hoarse striking of a distant clock broke in upon his
  meditations. Nine o'clock! His day of slavery had commenced. He laid down the
  book upon the wooden stall before which it was his custom to linger for a
  minute or two most mornings. Something had lodged in his throat; it might
  have been a sob! He had been so absorbed that he had forgotten where he
  stood, whither he was bound, it all came back to him with such grim yet
  facile insistence. London Bridge Station, disgorging its crowd of suburban
  business men, the heavy atmosphere of Bermondsey down the steps below&mdash;
  Bermondsey, with its nauseous odors, its smoke-stained warehouses, in one of
  which his own stool was awaiting him. It was disillusion, complete,
  entire&mdash;a veritable mud bath after the breath of roses.</p>

  <p>For this book had spoken of very different things. It had spoken of
  heather-crowned hills, of gorse bushes yellow with sprinkled gold, of a west
  wind, fragrant, melodious in the pines; of flower-wreathed hedges and
  blossoming trees; of the song of birds and the glad murmuring of insects.</p>

  <p>A dull flush stained his sallow cheeks. For once he lost his stoop and
  stood almost upright. It was the one moment of inspiration which seems to be
  the heritage even of the very meanest creature who ever walks the earth. The
  spirit of rebellion leaped up in him like a flame. His way lay, as it had
  ever done, down those fateful steps. Nine o'clock had struck, and 9 o'clock
  was his hour. He ignored it. He crossed the station yard and entered the
  booking hall.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"Then you won't tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Won't tell you what?"</p>

  <p>"Why you come here, in those clothes, and with no luggage. You must have
  some friends in Lidford."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I never heard of the place before," he assured her. "I
  picked the name out from the time-table. It sounded like the country, and it
  was a long way off."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with incredulity plainly written in her sedate,
  beautiful face. "Of course," she murmured, making a pretence at rising, "if
  you don't want to tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please don't go!" he interrupted, in alarm. "It is the truth, really! I
  know no one here. I only wanted to get away."</p>

  <p>"To get away," she repeated, thoughtfully. "Do you mean that you have been
  doing something wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Something wrong!" He repeated the words vaguely, with his eyes fixed upon
  her all the time. She had risen and was looking at him seriously. Her eyes
  were blue&mdash;such a wonderful blue, like the sky which he had been
  watching lazily all the afternoon, lying on his back in the deep cool grass;
  and her hair&mdash;ah! there was nothing which he had seen so beautiful as
  that! Then, warmed by her obvious gravity, he hastened to reassure her.</p>

  <p>"No," he declared, "I have done nothing wrong. I have run away from my
  work, that is all. I read in a book this morning of the country, of the,
  sunshine, and the wind, and the birds, and&mdash;all this." He waved his arm
  aimlessly about. "I had to come&mdash;I couldn't help it."</p>

  <p>"You have come from London&mdash;here?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"And your luggage?"</p>

  <p>"I brought none."</p>

  <p>"And your hat?"</p>

  <p>"I threw it away. It was a very old, shiny hat, with ink on the bare
  places. What would have thought of me wandering about the fields in such a
  thing? It is bad enough as I am."</p>

  <p>He glanced disparagingly down at his shabby black clothes and dark
  trousers, frayed at the ends, but carefully pressed and cleaned. She shook
  her head. She was a little bewildered.</p>

  <p>"I am sure that your clothes are very nice." she said, "and you were wrong
  to throw away your hat. What are you going to do without one?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," he answered. "But, then, I have no Idea what I am going
  to do with myself, so it really doesn't matter, does it?"</p>

  <p>"I think." she said, deliberately, "that you are the very queerest person
  I ever met. Do go on talking to me! Tell me some more
  about&mdash;yourself."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing interesting to tell," he assured her, a little wearily.
  "I would rather listen to you. Tell me some more about the birds."</p>

  <p>She shook her head impatiently.</p>

  <p>"What is your name, please?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Stephen Marwood," he answered. "I am an orphan, and a clerk in a
  warehouse. I get twenty-five shillings a week, and I add up figures and make
  out invoices from 9 till 6 in a cellar, with the gas burning all the time. I
  live in a long, ugly street, surrounded by miles of other streets. I am just
  one of a million. I work and I sleep, and I work again, and all the time my
  lungs are choked with fog and smoke and bad smells."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't sound nice," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"It isn't!" he assured her.</p>

  <p>"And yet." she added, with a little, wistful sigh, "it is London."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly London," he declared. "It might as well be hell."</p>

  <p>She looked at him wonderingly. After all, he must be a little mad.</p>

  <p>"And where," she asked, reverting once more to the practical, "are you
  going to sleep?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know." he answered, dreamily, "and I don't care, if only I can
  smell this honeysuckle all night."</p>

  <p>"And your tea and supper?" she asked, scornfully. "Will the scent of the
  honeysuckle satisfy your hunger as well?"</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes for a moment. Removed from all distractions, he was
  forced to admit that he was hungry. "I shall go down to the inn." he decided.
  "I suppose there is an inn here. But you?"</p>

  <p>She pointed downward to where the gray smoke rose in a straight, thin line
  from a red-tiled cottage. "There is no inn," she told him. "but my aunt will
  get you some tea, if you like. We often have parties."</p>

  <p>"We will have it together, then?" he begged, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she answered, laughing.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A month afterward they met almost in the same place.</p>

  <p>"Let us climb to the top and watch the reapers," he begged. "There is a
  field on the other side where the poppies are all in clusters, like specks of
  blood in a waving, yellow sea. I was watching them all this morning. By
  to-morrow they will be gone. The men seem to creep like insects, but all the
  time the grain falls."</p>

  <p>She sighed. She was dressed in black. She looked thin and there were tears
  in her eyes. But more wonderful still was the change in him. He carried
  himself like a man; a healthy tan bad burnt his cheeks, his eyes were bright
  with health. Even his voice had acquired a new firmnesss. The drudge was no
  more. The yoke of his servitude was cast aside. To-morrow he might starve.
  His small savings, in fact, were almost spent. To-day, at least, he was a
  man.</p>

  <p>"What strange fancies you have!" she declared. "The farmers hate the
  poppies, and these overgrown hedges which you admire so much ought all to be
  cut down and trimmed."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Give me the honeysuckle and the creepers," he declared. "I
  have seen enough of the ugly and the useful to last me all my life. Come, it
  is only a few steps further. Give me your hand."</p>

  <p>Breathless, they reached the summit of the hill and the shelter of the
  little grove of pine trees. She sat down with her back to the trunk of one of
  them. He threw himself by her side. Below them the slumbering landscape, warm
  and mellow in the afternoon sunshine, and in their faces th« west wind.</p>

  <p>"I believe in heaven," he murmured. "I have found it."</p>

  <p>A delight, almost a fervor, was in his eyes as they wandered on and on to
  where the limits of his vision ended in a faint blue mist. She looked at him
  as one who seeks to read a book written in a strange language.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand," she said. "It is beautiful here. I know, because
  everyone says so, and it is pleasant to sit and watch it all for a while. But
  I have sat here all my life, and I am weary of it."</p>

  <p>"Weary!" he repeated, in amazement. "Weary of this country, of this
  life!"</p>

  <p>"Sick to death of it!" she answered, with a vigor which was almost
  bluntness. "Who can sit and look at one picture all their lives, however
  beautiful? The fields and the hedges change only from winter to summer, from
  summer to winter. And the people change never."</p>

  <p>He pointed to the little graveyard away in the valley. "It is not true,"
  he declared. "They have their joys and their sorrows also. There was
  merriment enough at the harvest home the other day, and the whole village
  wept over that last little mound in the churchyard."</p>

  <p>She shook her head impatiently. A strand or two of her hair was loosened;
  the sun flecked it with gold. He realized then that she was beautiful. She
  sat there like a self-enthroned goddess.</p>

  <p>"The people are all very dull and very ignorant," she said. "Their lives
  are narrow; they sleep and they eat, and they die&mdash;but they do not live.
  They never live."</p>

  <p>He was alarmed. "Go on," he said, in a low tone. "You, have something in
  your mind?"</p>

  <p>"It is true," she admitted. "While aunt was alive, I was a prisoner. Now,
  I am free. I want to escape."</p>

  <p>"Escape&mdash;from here?" he murmured. "Why, this is Paradise!"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly, but with her mirth was mingled a subtle note of
  mockery.</p>

  <p>"You are a very foolish person." she said, "you do not know what ambition
  is. I do not want to sit upon the bank all my life."</p>

  <p>"There are many who drown," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"I will take the risk," she answered.</p>

  <p>All the joy and freshness seemed to fade away from his face. Something of
  the old haggard despair came back to him. This was the end, then, of all his
  dreams.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," he said, in a low tone, "I walked to Market Deeping. I got a
  situation with Sheppards', the auctioneers, and Mrs. Green, in the village,
  has promised me a room."</p>

  <p>Her lips curled a little. "If it satisfies you&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>He interrupted her. "Don't mock me!" he cried, roughly. "Nothing satisfies
  me if you go away. You know that."</p>

  <p>"That is foolish," she said, "for I am most surely going away."</p>

  <p>"To&mdash;London?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have written to my cousin there."</p>

  <p>"It would have broken your aunt's heart," he said.</p>

  <p>"While she was alive I obeyed her," the girl answered, defiantly. "Now she
  is gone my life, is my own."</p>

  <p>"Yes." he murmured, "yes. Our lives are all our own. See how the corn
  falls, Esther. . . . They have reached the last belt, and all the poppies are
  gone."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At first she wrote to him. He carried her letters with him backward and
  forward, reading them, studying them, always treasuring them. Save only for
  this one sorrow , the sorrow of her absence and his constant anxiety
  concerning her, his life had become a joy to him. His work was simple, and he
  did it better than it had ever been done before. His little office was bright
  and clean, his window looked out upon a quaint old cobbled market-place. In
  front was a garden, bright even in these late autumn days with simple
  flowers. Backward and forward he walked to and from his work, and the wind
  and rain and sun seemed each in their turn the sweetest things he had known.
  He grew in stature and in breadth: the latent possibilities of his manhood
  asserted themselves. In the little village he became a popular person. He
  attempted gardening, and every one was willing to help him with advice and
  bulbs, and the promise of seeds. He even ventured to discuss the crops with
  the farmers whom he met on the way . He remembered that he had once, before
  the evil days, called himself a Christian, and one Sunday morning he found
  his way to the village church. He came out with a curious sense of removal
  from that part of his life which was still something of a nightmare to him.
  Henceforth the memory of it never troubled him. He had come into real and
  intimate kinship with these simple folk among whom chance had brought
  him.</p>

  <p>And then her letters ceased. He wrote and wrote again, but there came no
  reply. He bore it as well as he could, and then, one day, a chance remark
  brought the stinging color into his cheeks, and his heart for a moment stood
  still. He applied for leave of absence and went to London.</p>

  <p>The address which she had given him was No. 127 West-st., Edgware Road.
  But when he reached it he felt again for the letter in his pocket. No. 127
  was a public house. Yet that was the number at the head of her letter. He
  pushed open the swing doors and entered.</p>

  <p>There was a smell of stale beer and fresh sawdust. An unwholesome looking
  youth, collarless and unwashed, was cleaning the stains of beer pots from the
  marble-topped tables. A couple of carmen were wrangling in a corner, a
  dissolute looking person in seedy black was drinking at the counter and
  carrying on a desultory conversation with a young person, behind the bar.
  Marwood addressed himself to her.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me if Miss Day lives here?" he asked. The young person
  looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Used to!" she answered. "She's gone away now."</p>

  <p>It was true, then. Esther had really lived in a place like this. He looked
  about him wondering, and back at the young person behind the bar, who seemed
  undecided whether to resent his scrutiny or to encourage him as a possible
  admirer.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me&mdash;her present address?", he asked.</p>

  <p>The young person jerked her head toward a swing door, leading apparently
  into an inner bar. "Don't know," she said. "I dersay Mrs. Molesworth can tell
  you. She's in there."</p>

  <p>Marwood pushed open the swing door. A stout, florid woman stood behind a
  circular counter flanked with a gorgeous array of mirrors and glasses. She
  was apparently engaged in the task of turning sundry black bottles upside
  down and holding them up to the light to estimate their contents.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon." he said. "I believe that Miss Day has been staying
  here. Can you give me her present address?"</p>

  <p>The woman set down the particular bottle which she was examining and
  looked at him fixedly.</p>

  <p>"And what might be your business with Miss Day?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"My name is Marwood," he said. "I knew Miss Day down in Somerset."</p>

  <p>The lady nodded her head vigorously. She became, if possible, a little
  redder in the face.</p>

  <p>"Then all I can say is that it's a great pity you didn't keep her in
  Somerset." she answered. "What's the use of a girl like her, with scarcely a
  rag to her back, coming up here with such notions? Wouldn't do this, and
  wouldn't do that&mdash;as particular and finicky all the time as you please.
  Drat the girl, I say, niece or no niece!"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Marwood said timidly. "I daresay it was a great change for
  her up here. Can you tell me where I shall find her?"</p>

  <p>"No, I cannot," the lady answered, as though incensed at the question.
  "And, what's more, if I could I wouldn't, and good-day to you, sir."</p>

  <p>She swung around and disappeared through a door leading to an inner
  room.</p>

  <p>Marwood left the place with hot cheeks. Some shadow of the humiliation
  which he could well imagine had been her lot seemed also to have fallen upon
  him. For two days and two nights he sought her in all manner of places and
  thoroughfares. Then chance befriended him. She was standing beneath a lamp
  post, and he was in the shadows. There was no one to see the tears which
  filled his eyes, to hear the sob which rose hot in his throat. She was tall
  and thin and pale. Her eyes, were larger, there was a pinched look about her
  features. Her clothes were shabby. He thanked God for that. She was talking
  with a man&mdash;a gentleman, he seemed to be, well dressed, good humored,
  debonaire. Marwood listened.</p>

  <p>"And how does the show go?" the man asked her.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I am no judge," she answered, wearily. "It seems stupid enough from
  the wings. I am only in the chorus, you know. I have nothing to do,
  really."</p>

  <p>"We are going to alter all that," the man said, swinging his cane. "I
  shall speak to Randall and hammer a small part out of him, somehow. But, by
  Jove, Miss Day, you look awfully pale!"</p>

  <p>Then Marwood saw her stumble for a moment, as though she.were dizzy. She
  recovered herself almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"I am&mdash;quite well," she said. "A little tired, perhaps."</p>

  <p>The man suddenly threw away his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Miss Day," he said, "you've done a very foolish thing! You've
  missed your luncheon. You girls are always forgetting your meals. I never do.
  Come along. No, I insist!"</p>

  <p>Her faint protestations were of no avail, and Marwood felt the blood run
  cold in his veins, for he had seen for a second what no one can ever see and
  mistake&mdash;the wolfish gleam of hunger in her eyes, come and gone like a
  flash, but more eloquent than any spoken words. Then the restaurant doors
  before which they had been standing opened and they disappeared Inside.
  Marwood waited. It was an hour before they came out. The transformation in
  her was amazing. The lines seemed to have been smoothed from her face: there
  was color in her cheeks and light In her eyes. Marwood, who had been standing
  on the opposite side of the street, started to cross the way, but he was too
  late. Somewhat unwillingly, as it seemed to him, her companion hurried her
  into a hansom, and followed.</p>

  <p>Marwood caught a glimpse of the man's face under the gas-lamp&mdash;it was
  sufficient. When the cab drew up before a row of flats a little west of Pall
  Mall he was already turning the corner. He saw Esther alight, hold, out her
  hand: he could see her hesitation, her reluctant footsteps. He caught the
  man's eager tone as he bent over her hand&mdash;</p>

  <p>"For a moment&mdash;not more than five minutes. I must show you the little
  play&mdash;and I believe that the part would suit you admirably. We will keep
  the hansom, it you like. I will send you home."</p>

  <p>Marwood called out, but his voice sounded weak even to himself. The door
  was closed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>He leaned for a few moments against the palings. He was out of breath, and
  to him there had been something tragic in the disappearance of those two, the
  man and the girl, behind that closed door. His imagination ran rife. He saw
  hideous things. Almost he was ready to creep away&mdash;to escape&mdash;to
  forget. Then, as he returned to a more sane state of mind, he saw her as she
  came first to him, her hands clasped behind, her head. thrown back as she
  walked blithely through the clover-scented meadows, humming some forgotten
  tune. With an oath, he trod the flags and rang the bell. A liveried servant
  let him in and led the way toward the lift.</p>

  <p>"Which floor, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I want the gentleman's rooms who has just come in with the lady," Marwood
  answered, his hand in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Borrodale&mdash;fourth floor, sir," the man remarked, closing the
  gates of the lift.</p>

  <p>The man servant in plain black livery blandly denied Mr. Borrodale's
  presence. His coat and hat on the hall table, however, emboldened Marwood. He
  pushed his way in.</p>

  <p>"It's no use; you can't see the governor!" the man declared, angrily. "Out
  you go!"</p>

  <p>The veneer of civility had departed. He attempted the bully. Marwood heard
  a woman's cry, and he struck the man on the mouth. Then with an oak chair he
  thundered upon the closed door of the room from which the cry had come. A man
  swore and a woman sobbed. Marwood sent a panel crashing out of the door,
  which was suddenly thrown open. He caught one glimpse of her face, pale and
  terror-stricken, as she flitted by. He would have followed, but master and
  servant were too many for him. The latter struck him from behind, and he
  spent the night in a hospital. When he sought her again it was in vain.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>So Marwood returned to his country life and his routine work. One day, old
  Mr. Sheppard, his employer, called him into his private office.</p>

  <p>"Marwood." he said bluntly. "I am getting on in years, and I want a rest.
  I have saved a little and I have only my daughter to think of. Will you take
  the business&mdash;and marry her?"</p>

  <p>Marwood sat still and thought. He watched the dusty floor specked into
  gold by a long shaft of sunlight, and he saw things there which the four
  walls of that room had never held. Presently he looked up.</p>

  <p>"I want a month's holiday," he said. "When I return I will answer
  you."</p>

  <p>The old man grunted, but gave his consent. Once more Marwood travelled up
  to London, and renewed his search. This time he succeeded very easily. Esther
  Day was well known now. Her name and her pictures were in all the papers. She
  was acting at the Frivolity, and she had made a "hit."</p>

  <p>He called upon her, and he felt his courage oozing away. He felt the slow
  dissipation of the one romance of his life as they talked together. She was
  well dressed, prosperous, more beautiful than ever, with all the light
  smartness of the modern Londoner. To their last strange meeting she made no
  allusion. She gave him tea, and showed him her new poodle. She talked of
  theatrical matters as one in the know&mdash;and to him it was jargon. When he
  stood up to go, he made one effort to break down the barriers which seemed to
  have grown up between them.</p>

  <p>"And you have, found," he asked, holding her hand for a moment, "the
  things you sought for?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"I have learned wisdom," she answered. "I have learned how much to
  expect."</p>

  <p>He fancied that she hurried him away. As he left the door a brougham drove
  up, and a young man alighted&mdash;a young man of the type he knew nothing
  of&mdash;immaculate in dress and person, good-looking, languid. Marwood went
  back to the country that night.</p>

  <p>Yet he delayed his answer, though old Sheppard grew more and more
  impatient every day. Marwood passed through a curious phase of his emotional
  life. Mary Sheppard was pretty in her way, and waited only for him to speak.
  Yet he hung back with something of the feeling of a man called upon to sign
  his own death warrant. An impending sense of the finality of life seemed to
  him to be inevitably coupled with the decision which the old man and the girl
  were now awaiting with almost obvious eagerness. He had no great aspirations,
  nothing which could rank as ambitions. Yet behind the trend of his daily
  life, his ordinary, well-performed tasks and simple pleasures, he felt at
  times the dim, unrealized presence of greater things, a more quickening and
  satisfying life. Sometimes, in the night, he sat up in bed and stretched out
  his arms&mdash;for what he scarcely knew. He wandered up on to the hilltop
  and watched the reapers. Some shadow of a far distant, impossible dream
  seemed to still torment him with intangible and unsatisfying longings. And
  all the time the old man and the girl waited. In the end they had their
  way.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>She came into his little office&mdash;a curiously incongruous presence in
  her fashionable clothes, bringing with her the subtle air of the city and of
  all those nameless things, the presence of which had so estranged him on his
  last visit to her. But this time he had no consciousness of them, for she
  looked into his eyes and it was the look for which he had prayed so
  often.</p>

  <p>"My friend." she murmured, "you were right. I am weary of it all. When you
  came to me I was brutal. I owe you so much, and I wanted to escape the debt.
  I have come to pay it, if I can."</p>

  <p>Her hands had stolen into his. It was, after all, like a dream&mdash;a
  beautiful dream poignant with unutterable bitterness.</p>

  <p>"Come out with me." she murmured. "I want you to take me through the
  meadows and up to the hill where we watched the reapers. Will you come?"</p>

  <p>He let fall her hands, and a great sob rose to his throat.</p>

  <p>"I cannot!" he said.</p>

  <p>A fear stole Into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me that you have changed!" she pleaded.</p>

  <p>"I have never changed," he answered gravely; "but I am married to Mary
  Sheppard. It was her father's last wish, and it seemed to matter so
  little."</p>

  <p>She laughed&mdash;a curious, dry, mirthless laugh.</p>

  <p>"I hope that you will be happy," she said. "Somehow, I never thought of
  this. And, after all, my coming was only a whim. I must act to-night, and
  to-morrow night&mdash;and all the days of my life."</p>

  <p>He heard the rustling of her gown as she left him. He heard the office
  door swing to and close. He sat on his hard chair, and once more he looked
  steadily with fixed, sightless eyes into that long shaft of golden dust. Then
  his head sank lower and lower&mdash;into his hands. He leaned forward upon
  the desk. Before him stretched the long, level vista of weary days&mdash;the
  treadmill of an unlived life. Some one shouted to him from the top of the
  stairs. It was like the sentence of his doom&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Stephen, are you coming up to dinner or are you not?. Everything will be
  cold!"</p>

  <p>He rose slowly and ascended the stairs.</p>

  <h2><a id="story2">THE GREAT FORTUNA MINE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The London Harmsworth Magazine</i>, Jun 1903</h3>
  <br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">"Mr. Anderson, I am sure. I recognised you directly. What a
  strange chance that we should come across one another in this out-of-the-way
  part of the world!"</p>

  <p>I had risen to my feet, of course, immediately she had taken me by
  surprise by halting in front of my small table. It was not possible to avoid
  taking the delicate long hand with its white fingers so frankly held out to
  me. We shook hands solemnly while I ransacked my brain for some coherent
  speech of apologetic denial. And then something in the expression of her
  wonderful brown eyes, a faint meaningful contraction of the eyebrows as she
  looked straight at me, altered the whole situation. She knew quite well that
  my name was not Anderson; she was perfectly well aware of the indubitable
  fact that these were the first words which we had ever exchanged.</p>

  <p>I mumbled something idiotic, and she turned to glance down the room. The
  old man with whom she had entered, a decrepit, weak-faced, but
  aristocratic-looking, Englishman was shaking hands with an Italian, whom I
  had been told was a native of the place, and who had evidently come in to
  dine. They were out of earshot, and for the moment were not observing us.</p>

  <p>She leaned over towards me.</p>

  <p>"I have seen you here for the last few evenings," she said, hurriedly.
  "Tell me your real name."</p>

  <p>"John P. Shrive," I answered. "I am an American."</p>

  <p>The corners of her lips twitched slightly, and those wonderful eyes, which
  for several evenings I had done little else save sit and admire from a
  respectful distance, were filled with laughter.</p>

  <p>"So I thought," she answered. "I wonder&mdash;I wonder whether you would
  care to do me a service?"</p>

  <p>My words tripped one another up. I was incoherent, but earnest. For two
  days I had been vainly trying to find some excuse to speak to her. I had
  attempted a conversation with her father, and suffered the ignominy of a
  chilling repulse. A service. There was a very little in the world which I
  would not have attempted for her.</p>

  <p>"After dinner, then," she said, "do not sit out in the front. You will
  find some seats at the back of the house. Order your coffee there, and I will
  come when I can. And remember this. If my father or Count Perlitto should
  speak to you don't be drawn into any conversation at all. Be rude to them if
  you can. Don't tell them anything about yourself or your business."</p>

  <p>"Count Perlitto," I observed, "is the little dark gentleman with the
  brushed-up moustache?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! But it is my father who is most likely to ask you questions. Please
  don't think that this is a conspiracy, or anything very terrible. I will
  explain it all to you presently."</p>

  <p>With a little smile and a nod she turned away and joined the two men at
  the other end of the room. I ordered double my usual quantity of wine and
  began my dinner.</p>

  <p>Now, for two evenings I had dined alone at this same little table, which I
  had carefully chosen because it afforded me the most satisfactory view of the
  most beautiful girl I had ever seen in my life. She was tall and very slight,
  her hair was lightish brown, and here and there a glint of gold, and she had
  that French trick of laughing with her eyes which I never could resist. She
  wore delightfully cool muslin gowns, and about her whole person, her
  jewellery, her shoes, and the care of her hands, there was a certain
  inexplicable daintiness which was as much a part of her as that delightful
  little laugh which seemed to me the most musical thing I had ever heard in my
  life. But to-night things were different. I myself had become an object of
  the most surprising interest to her two companions. I saw the girl lean
  forward and talk to them as she trifled with some new and highly-seasoned
  <i>hors d'oeuvre</i>, and the effect of her words was instantaneous. Her
  father fumbled for a moment with an enormous horn-rimmed monocle, having
  successfully fixed which in his left eye, he turned and transfixed me with a
  most tremendous stare. The little Italian displayed a similar interest in
  slightly different fashion. He kept darting sidelong glances towards me,
  showing his white teeth and curling his black moustache, and all the while
  talking in most animated fashion to his two companions. This sort of thing
  went on more or less during the entire progress of the meal, to my great
  discomfort. No sooner did I raise my eyes to steal one of my customary
  glances towards the young lady than either the horn monocle with its blank,
  unwavering stare, or the little Italian's keen black eyes were fixed upon me.
  Between curiosity and annoyance, my dinner was completely spoilt. I missed a
  course, and was in the act of rising when I saw the whole party hurriedly
  leave their places and bear down upon me.</p>

  <p>Her father, who only yesterday had responded to some attempted advances on
  my part with truly British <i>hauteur</i>, stopped at my table and smiled
  genially upon me.</p>

  <p>"If you are taking your coffee outside this evening," he said, "will you
  join us? This is my friend, Count Perlitto, who is a large landowner in the
  neighbourhood; my daughter I believe you have already met."</p>

  <p>I glanced towards her and found a decided negative engraven upon her
  frowning forehead. On the whole, though I was burning with curiosity to know
  what the whole thing meant, I was glad to have an opportunity of asserting my
  independence.</p>

  <p>"I'm very much obliged to you, sir, for the suggestion," I said, "but I'm
  afraid it's quite impossible. I have a great deal of writing to do to-night,
  and the mails out here are a trifle scanty."</p>

  <p>I distinctly saw the two men exchange rapid glances as I mentioned the
  writing.</p>

  <p>The Count interposed. "The writing. Oh, yes," he said, "but afterwards?
  The evening is positively too fine to be spent within the doors&mdash;beneath
  the roof&mdash;ah, you understand? Besides, you are a tourist, is it not so,
  from a great country? We would wish, we who live here, to show hospitality to
  those who come so far from the large cities where all the sightseers find
  their way. Here it is very different. Here you see the true Italy. You will
  do us the honour, signor? There is some liqueur, not of the house, which is
  to be recommended."</p>

  <p>Guidance was before me in the frown, now even more forbidding.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry, Count," I said firmly. "It is quite impossible for me to join
  you this evening."</p>

  <p>He departed with a polite expression of regret. The girl smiled at me over
  her shoulder, which I took to mean that so far I had done the correct thing.
  I sat down in my chair, poured out a glass of wine and tried to puzzle out
  where I stood. The Count, who was, as I well knew, the great landowner of the
  place, and whose aversion to tourists was a byword, and who had several times
  passed me on the road with an insolent stare, was suddenly more than commonly
  anxious to make my acquaintance. The father of the young lady who had been
  the object of my respectful, but vehement, admiration, after repulsing my
  advances in the most freezing manner, was displaying at least a similar
  anxiety. The change in both of them dated from the moment when the young lady
  herself had directed their attention towards me. The undoubted inference then
  was that she had told them something or other concerning me which had aroused
  their interest. I determined to go and find out what it was.</p>

  <p>The place to which I had been directed was deserted when I arrived there,
  and deservedly so. There were a few iron chairs, a patch of scanty grass, a
  long line of outbuildings, and beyond the sloping vineyards. I lit a
  cigarette, but decided not to advertise my presence there by ordering coffee.
  In a very few moments I heard the soft rustle of advancing skirts, and she
  came round the corner of the grey stone building.</p>

  <p>Whatever this matter was in which I was becoming involved, it apparently
  savoured more of comedy than tragedy, to judge by the suppressed laughter in
  the girl's face. I wiped the dust from a chair with my handkerchief, and she
  sat down beside me with the utmost composure.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Mr.&mdash;Shrive," she began, "you have made up your mind that
  I am a most forward young person."</p>

  <p>"If you want me to tell you exactly what I think of you," I answered,
  moving a little nearer, "all I can say is that I'm ready to go straight
  ahead."</p>

  <p>She nodded composedly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "you look like that sort of person."</p>

  <p>"What sort of person?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The sort of person who goes straight ahead. It's a characteristic of your
  country-people, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"When one's mind is made up," I said, firmly, touching, as though by
  accident, the back of her chair.</p>

  <p>"There are some necessary explanations," she murmured.
  "Afterwards&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She looked at me. I withdrew my hand.</p>

  <p>"Please go on," I said.</p>

  <p>"My father's name is Derwent," she said. "He has come out here to look at
  a silver mine belonging to Count Perlitto. He wants to buy it."</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, encouragingly. "The Count looks like the sort who have
  silver mines to sell. We get plenty of them out in Boston."</p>

  <p>"My father thinks he is a good business man," she continued. "As a matter
  of fact, he has lost nearly all his money speculating in things which he
  doesn't understand a bit. He has about twenty-thousand pounds left. That is
  all we have to live upon. The Count is asking twenty-thousand pounds for this
  mine. If my father buys it we shall be penniless."</p>

  <p>"Sure the mine's no good?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," she answered, with the first note of impatience in her tone.
  "Ask yourself what the probabilities are. My father knows nothing about
  mining himself, and he has not even an expert's opinion upon it. He goes
  entirely upon the Count's word, and what the Count chooses to show him. Why,
  the mine isn't being worked&mdash;hasn't been worked for thirty years."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," I suggested, "the Count hasn't the capital to work it. Labour
  out here's mighty cheap, but up-to-date mining takes a lot of money."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a faint frown. The smile had gone from her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"The mine is worthless," she said, simply. "I am sure of it. I have read
  up its past history, and if ever there were silver there at all it has been
  exhausted long ago. But even granted that there is a chance in favour of the
  mine&mdash;which there isn't&mdash;I want you to remember that this twenty-
  thousand pounds is all that stands between us and beggary."</p>

  <p>"In that case," I said, decidedly, "your father is mad even to think about
  the deal."</p>

  <p>"I knew," she said, "that you would agree with me. You can understand, can
  you not, the trouble I am in? My father's mind is practically made up. He
  means to buy the mine. I saw a telegram to his lawyers, ordering them to
  realise our last securities. The moment the money comes, my father will sign
  the deed of purchase."</p>

  <p>"Has he no friends," I asked, "whose opinion he would take?"</p>

  <p>"Not one," she answered. "He has always been so foolish that I think
  everyone is tired of advising him. He always goes his own way in the long
  run. He is so painfully obstinate. I do not think that there is anybody who
  can help me&mdash;except you."</p>

  <p>Her hand fell upon my coat-sleeve, and mine promptly closed over it. She
  made no movement to draw it away. I felt that I would have pitched the Count
  down one of his own shafts with pleasure if she had asked me.</p>

  <p>"What can I do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," she said. "A plan came into my head when I saw you
  sitting there alone this evening. Somehow&mdash;you looked helpful,
  and&mdash;I had an idea that&mdash;you know you behaved rather badly, haven't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"You mean that I have looked at you a good deal," I answered. "I couldn't
  help it, Miss Derwent, indeed. It wasn't impertinence. I just felt that I
  wanted to know you badly, and the next best thing was to sit in my corner and
  watch you. You are rather nice to watch."</p>

  <p>"Am I?" she asked, softly.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't give me greater happiness," I said, "than to help
  you&mdash;if, indeed, that is possible. You see, helping implies a reward,
  doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You want bribing, then?" she asked, with affected coldness.</p>

  <p>"Call it an incentive," I answered.</p>

  <p>"At least&mdash;if it is all I can get&mdash;a word of gratitude from you
  will be worth all the trouble you can give me."</p>

  <p>"Is that all&mdash;you will expect?" she asked softly.</p>

  <p>I felt my heart thumping against my ribs. I wanted to raise her fingers to
  my lips, and draw her close to me, and I dared do nothing of the sort. I knew
  well that she was half playing with me, that she permitted herself this
  badinage because she had decided rightly or wrongly that I was a person to be
  trusted.</p>

  <p>"If I dared to ask all that I would wish to claim," I said, earnestly, "I
  am afraid that you would say that my service was not worth the price."</p>

  <p>An incomprehensible smile played about her lips. I have often wondered
  since exactly what she was thinking of at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Supposing," she suggested, softly, "that we waive the question of
  incentive&mdash;or reward."</p>

  <p>"I will willingly leave it," I said, "to your generosity."</p>

  <p>She sighed. Her tone when she spoke again was more practical. I felt that
  a delightful little interlude was over.</p>

  <p>"To go back to my plan," she said. "What I want you to do is very simple.
  I want you to transform yourself into one of those creatures who go about and
  report on mines&mdash;experts you know."</p>

  <p>I looked at her steadily.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" I said.</p>

  <p>"In fact," she continued, "so far as my father and the Count are
  concerned, you are one already. I told them that your real name was Anderson,
  that I met you at Mrs. Murgatroyd's, and that you were something to do with
  mining. You must have noticed their sudden change of manner towards you."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I admitted, "I noticed that."</p>

  <p>"Of course," she continued, "you won't want to give yourself away all at
  once. Keep up the tourist as long as you can. But in the end I want you to
  let father think that you have been sent here by another syndicate to report
  upon the property, and that your decision is most unfavourable. That ought to
  stop him buying it, and, in short, that is my plan."</p>

  <p>I remained silent. I felt her eyes upon me.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind?" she asked timidly. "Is it too difficult? Or perhaps you
  don't like saying what isn't true?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mind a bit," I assured her. "I think that your plan is wonderful,
  and I will do my best to carry it out."</p>

  <p>"I shall never be able to thank you enough," she murmured. "Poverty is
  hard enough as it is, but destitution!"</p>

  <p>I took her hand again. It was soft and cool, and faintly responsive. I
  felt that I would have lied till I was black in the face for her. But I
  wondered&mdash;</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">The Count was the first upon the field. He caught me smoking
  an early cigarette in the cobbled square of the little town, and at once
  waved his hand in friendly salute.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he cried, as though the sight of me were some unexpected boon
  conferred upon him by Providence. "It is Mr. Anderson, is it not? Good
  morning! Good morning!"</p>

  <p>"My name," I answered, "is Shrive. John P. Shrive!"</p>

  <p>The Count shrugged his shoulders. Suddenly he came close up to my side and
  looked round to be sure that we were alone.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "you are an American; you are a people of great affairs;
  you like, I think, that one talks business with you. Whatever your name may
  be, you are here to make a report upon my mine&mdash;the Great Fortuna Mine.
  Is it not so?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Count," I said, "I guess you are a long way off this time. I know
  no more about mines than a babe unborn. I'm junior partner and buyer in a
  firm of dry goods men in Boston, and I'm on my way to Genoa to buy silk. I
  just stopped over a day or so to get a bit of your country at first hand, and
  to see your pictures."</p>

  <p>The Count listened to me with marked impatience, tapping his leg all the
  while with his long riding whip. When I had finished he smiled at me
  serenely.</p>

  <p>"Very good, very good, my dear sir. I understand perfectly that it is
  necessary for you to act secretly. But I will be frank with you. The mine is
  as good as sold."</p>

  <p>I was careful to let an instantly smothered little exclamation of dismay
  escape me. The Count heard it with a smile of triumph.</p>

  <p>"To whom?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"To the Englishman, Mr. Derwent," the Count answered promptly. "I am quite
  open with you&mdash;as you see. I cannot treat with your principals, whoever
  they may be."</p>

  <p>"My principals," I answered, "don't buy mines. We deal in dry goods."</p>

  <p>"Yes! Yes!" he ejaculated impatiently. "I know all about that. But let us
  talk like sensible men, eh? The mine being sold, your report is useless, is
  it not so? Come, you shall not have your labour for nothing. I will buy it
  from you."</p>

  <p>"If the mine is already sold," I remarked, "of what value can my report
  be&mdash;supposing I have made one?"</p>

  <p>"As good as sold," he interrupted. "It is the formalities only which await
  completion."</p>

  <p>"Then I still do not see," I said, "of what value my supposed report could
  be."</p>

  <p>The Count fixed me with his little black eyes.</p>

  <p>"For the purposes of business," he said slowly, "no! It is not worth the
  paper on which it is written. But I will show you how frank I am. Mr.
  Derwent, he, too, knows that you are Mr. Anderson, the mining expert. He will
  come to you for your verdict. He will, perhaps, try to buy your report. Now,
  you have had no opportunity to inspect the property properly. It may
  be&mdash;I cannot tell&mdash;that you have even prepared an unfavourable
  report. If so I will buy it from you. I do not wish to cause the good Mr.
  Derwent any uneasiness."</p>

  <p>"The uneasiness," I remarked, "will come later on."</p>

  <p>"What you mean?" he asked, quickly.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about mines," I said. "I am a dry goods man. But somehow I
  don't take much stock in the Fortuna Mine."</p>

  <p>"For how much you not say that again?" he asked. "Not any more at all. For
  how much you say it is a good mine?"</p>

  <p>The little Count had got there at last. I pursed up my lips and stood as
  though thinking. The Count watched my face anxiously.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for me intervention came in the shape of Mr. Derwent and his
  daughter, who called to us from the front of the hotel. I could not but
  admire the ease and grace with which the Count cloaked his annoyance. He took
  me by the arm and let me across the square, all smiles and bows.</p>

  <p>"For how much, dear friend?" he whispered in my ear.</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"You're rushing this a bit, Count," I answered. "I'll think it over."</p>

  <p>The Count muttered something which sounded very much like "damn," but was
  probably something worse. A moment afterwards we were shaking hands with the
  Derwents.</p>

  <p>Miss Derwent, in a broad-brimmed picture hat trimmed with roses, and a
  white flannel gown, looked more charming than ever. Her greeting, too, with
  its delicate insinuation of our secret understanding, was exactly what I had
  looked for. She had talked to me in undertones of the beauty of the place,
  the clearness of the sky, the wonderful early sunlight in which the distant
  vine-covered hills were bathed. But of the other things which lay between us
  she made no mention, nor did she attempt in any way to draw me apart from the
  others.</p>

  <p>Our <i>déjeuner</i>&mdash;I seemed to be included in the meal as a matter
  of course&mdash;was quite a success. The Count chatted gaily and well of the
  beauties of the country where, he told us, with a little burst of pardonable
  pride, his family had ruled for ten centuries. He spoke of art and the things
  appertaining to it with the ease and fluency of one who was master of his
  subject. Of his mine, too, he spoke vaguely as the repository of hidden
  treasures which would long ago have been dragged to light but for his love of
  the quiet countryside.</p>

  <p>"You English," he said, "and you," he added, addressing me, "you do not
  understand that feeling. It is well for you that you do not. You are a
  utilitarian people. It is you who work hand-in-hand to-day with the great
  forces of the world. But with us here it is different. We are guilty of the
  terrible weakness of leaning upon our past. The people round here are my
  people. I want to see them husbandmen and wine-growers, not miners with pale
  faces, sowing the seeds of weakness in the next generation. I love to see my
  hillsides covered with vineyards as they have ever been. I do not love the
  tall shafts, the roar of machinery, the country made black and scarred with
  the entrails torn out of the earth. And yet these things must come," he
  murmured, leaning back and lighting a cigarette. "For many years I have
  struggled against it, but no longer. Ah, it is not possible."</p>

  <p>I looked across at the Count with unfeigned admiration. His beautiful eyes
  were filled with sadness. He leaned back in his chair, looking out upon the
  distant hillside as though already those shafts had come into existence. Miss
  Derwent permitted herself the faintest of smiles as she glanced across at me.
  Mr. Derwent seemed intent upon the great dish of strawberries which the Count
  had sent down from his own villa.</p>

  <p>After breakfast we were served with coffee and some delicate green
  liqueur, and then Mr. Derwent took his hand in the game. He began by moving
  his chair close to mine, and making clumsy efforts to get rid of the Count
  and his daughter. At this sort of game the Count was his master, and with
  very faint help from Veronica (I knew her name now), his attempts for some
  time were unsuccessful. At last, however, in obedience, as I suspect, to a
  vigorous under-the-table injunction from her father, Veronica rose languidly
  to her feet.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," she said, "that I am in an extravagant frame of mind this
  morning. After all, I think that I must have that ivory cross. Count, will
  you come and interpret for me?"</p>

  <p>The Count rose to his feet with much less than his usual gallantry.</p>

  <p>"Will you not charge me with the commission, signorina," he said. "My
  shop-people, when they see an English lady or an American, are, I fear,
  inclined to be exorbitant. Leave it to me, and I will promise you the cross
  at much less cost."</p>

  <p>Veronica hesitated. Mr. Derwent interposed.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, my dear!" he exclaimed. "I have seen the cross, and I think the
  price very reasonable. Go with the Count at once and secure it. I insist! It
  is only fair that we should spend a little money in a town where we have been
  so well entertained."</p>

  <p>Veronica lifted her white skirts just far enough to show me a delightful
  little foot, and turned toward the Count. It was not possible for him to
  hesitate any longer. He made a vigorous effort, however, to include me in the
  party.</p>

  <p>"You, too, Mr. Anderson," he said passing his arm through mine. "Oh, I
  insist. There are, indeed, some valuable curios to be seen. It is an
  opportunity which you must not miss."</p>

  <p>I am convinced that Mr. Derwent would have detained me by main force had I
  not saved him the trouble. I rose from my chair as Veronica passed, but
  excused myself with some emphasis.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Count," I said, "but I'm afraid I'm very unlike most of my
  countrypeople in that respect. I've no use for curios. I like my ornaments
  and my furniture clean and modern. I'll keep Mr. Derwent company."</p>

  <p>The Count threw me a look over his shoulder, evidently intended to remind
  me of our uncompleted bargain. Veronica nodded to me from underneath her
  parasol, and crossed the square at a pace which the Count must have found
  maddeningly slow. Mr. Derwent leaned over towards me and opened the ball
  straight off.</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">"I&mdash;er&mdash;was hoping to have a few minutes'
  conversation with you this morning, Mr. Anderson," he said, slowly adjusting
  his eye-glass. "From something which my daughter let drop
  in&mdash;er&mdash;the course of conversation, I gathered that you were to
  some extent interested in&mdash;in short, in mining properties."</p>

  <p>"You wanted to ask me," I suggested, "about this mine of the Count's?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" he admitted. "Now I am free to confess that I am not a mining
  expert. I came out to have a look at the property, meaning&mdash;er&mdash;to
  have an independent opinion in case I thought it likely to interest me. I
  find, however, that there is no room for any delay in the matter. Our good
  friend the Count&mdash;very decent, hospitable sort of fellow he
  seems&mdash;is, between ourselves, hard pressed. He means to sell, and to
  sell at once. He says that his brother is even now in London with a power of
  attorney. However that may be, it is certain that I have no time to get an
  expert out. I must rely upon my own judgment and the Count's honesty."</p>

  <p>"Of the two&mdash;" I murmured.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Mr. Derwent interrupted.</p>

  <p>I stirred my coffee vigorously and disclaimed speech. Mr. Derwent glared
  at me from behind his monocle.</p>

  <p>"It occurred to me," he went on, "that you might in this dilemma be
  inclined to help me with a word of advice. I am aware," he went on with a
  little wave of the hand, "that such a course is a little unusual. I refrain
  from asking you any personal questions. What your position here may be I do
  not know. I do not enquire. It is not my business. You may
  be&mdash;er&mdash;representing other interests. I will take my risk of that.
  I have ventured to make out this cheque for one hundred guineas;" he pushed
  it towards me. "Consider me for the moment as a client. Is the Great Fortuna
  Mine worth twenty-thousand pounds?"</p>

  <p>I tore the cheque into small pieces. "It is not worth twenty-thousand
  pence," I answered.</p>

  <p>He suddenly dropped his eye-glass and leaned forward. I scarcely knew him.
  A certain vagueness of expression was gone. He spoke and looked like a
  wide-awake astute man.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "I don't like your tearing that cheque up. You could have
  given me value for the money, and no man should be ashamed to take what he
  has earned."</p>

  <p>"No man," I answered, "can serve two masters. That's a mighty true saying,
  Mr. Derwent."</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing I'm afraid of about you," he said, eyeing me
  keenly. "I can't be altogether sure that Veronica hasn't been getting at
  you."</p>

  <p>"Do you allude," I asked guardedly, "to your daughter?"</p>

  <p>He ignored my question, but I could see that his suspicions were
  growing.</p>

  <p>"For some reason or other," he remarked thoughtfully, "Veronica is dead
  set against this deal. I never knew her to interfere in a business matter
  before. I can't understand it at all."</p>

  <p>"Your daughter," I said gravely, "may surely be pardoned if she takes some
  interest in a matter concerning her so closely."</p>

  <p>"But for the life of me," he protested, "I cannot see how it does concern
  her."</p>

  <p>"Speculations such as this," I said severely, "may be the pastime of the
  rich; but to gamble with the shreds of one's fortune is unpardonable."</p>

  <p>He looked at me in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;I&mdash;but you must be acquainted with my daughter, I suppose.
  You must have some idea of what you are talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," I answered tersely.</p>

  <p>"Then upon my word, for an intelligent young man," he said, "you're about
  the best hand at talking nonsense I've come across."</p>

  <p>"You ought to be a judge," I answered. "However, for your daughter's sake,
  here's the best and safest tip you've ever had. Let the mine alone."</p>

  <p>"I'm inclined to think you're right," he admitted with a sigh. "It is a
  risk, especially if your people, whoever they might be, are 'bears.' I hate
  to come all this way and do no business, though."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you stay at home, then," I said, severely, "and for your
  daughter's sake put the little you have in a good railroad stock?"</p>

  <p>He set down the liqueur glass which he had been in the act of raising to
  his lips, and looked at me for a moment in utter astonishment. Then he leaned
  back in his chair and laughed till the tears came into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who you are," he said weakly, "but you're the funniest young
  man I ever came across. Never mind. I believe you're right about the mine.
  We'll start back to London this morning."</p>

  <p>I was perhaps as astonished as he was, but I said nothing, for the Count
  and Veronica were close at hand. The former looked at us both anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Come," he called out, "we have triumphed. The ivory cross is ours. And
  now, if you are ready, Mr. Derwent, my carriage is here. The notary will be
  at my villa in an hour's time."</p>

  <p>Mr. Derwent rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Count," he said.</p>

  <p>They stepped aside. Veronica turned to me. There was the most becoming
  little pink flush upon her cheek.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I think that your father is persuaded," I said. "He will not buy. He is
  telling the Count so now."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"My friend," she said, "I shall be for ever in your debt."</p>

  <p>"I would rather," I answered, "that you paid."</p>

  <p>She looked at me and down at her feet.</p>

  <p>"He would have signed last night," she said, "if I had not invented
  you."</p>

  <p>The Count and Mr. Derwent came towards us. The former was pale with rage.
  I am convinced that nothing but the arrival of a telegraph message at that
  instant prevented his assaulting me. He tore open his message, and as he read
  he became a changed man.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" he exclaimed, turning towards Mr. Derwent with ill-concealed
  triumph, "I can no longer argue this matter with you. Your time was up last
  night. You have exceeded it, and, behold, the mine is no longer mine to deal
  with. It is sold."</p>

  <p>Mr. Derwent looked sharply at me.</p>

  <p>"Sold to whom?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Count shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is my brother in London who has arranged the matter," he said. "He has
  power of attorney, and he has received the money. The purchaser is a Mr.
  Charles Ellicot."</p>

  <p>Mr. Derwent looked at his daughter.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about this, Veronica?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Tell you presently, father," she answered. "Just at present I want to
  talk to Mr. Anderson. Please come here."</p>

  <p>I followed her obediently round the hotel to the gardens in the rear. She
  made me sit down, and took the seat next to mine. As though afraid that I
  might seek to escape, she laid her hand upon mine. It was not necessary.</p>

  <p>"First of all," she began, boldly, "I'm engaged to Charlie."</p>

  <p>I held her hand tightly. I was not capable of articulate speech just
  then.</p>

  <p>"Father wouldn't hear of it," she went on. "He said that Charlie was too
  poor, and had never done anything. He didn't believe in Charlie. I did."</p>

  <p>She paused. I think she found my silence a little disconcerting.</p>

  <p>"Charlie heard of this mine," she went on. "He sent over two experts and
  got two magnificent reports. Then he sent about trying to raise the money to
  buy it. Unfortunately, father heard about the mine too, and he decided to
  come over and look at it. I came with him to try to stop his buying it, if I
  could. All the time Charlie was trying to raise the money in London.
  Yesterday he wired me, 'All promised. Shall conclude to-morrow.' I was almost
  at my wit's end, for father had arranged to conclude the purchase last
  night."</p>

  <p>"This is where I come in, I suppose," I remarked feebly.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"They really put the idea into my head," she said. "My father wondered
  whether you were not here in connection with the mine, and the Count looked
  mysterious and smiled to himself. So I spoke to you last night, and
  afterwards I told them that you were a mining-engineer. That put father off
  at once, for he saw a chance of getting an expert opinion."</p>

  <p>"He had it," I murmured.</p>

  <p>"It was awfully sweet of you," she declared. "You see how beautifully it
  has all come off!"</p>

  <p>"Then it wasn't your father's last twenty-thousand pounds!" I remarked,
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," she murmured. "My father is really Lord Derwent. He
  prefers to travel <i>incognito</i> because people bother him so."</p>

  <p>For a moment the humour of this thing possessed me. I recalled my sound
  advice to a multi-millionaire, and I laughed till the tears stood in my eyes.
  Suddenly I remembered that I, too, had a confession to make.</p>

  <p>"By-the-by," I said slowly, "did you say that your&mdash;your
  friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Charlie," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Had had two favourable reports on the mine?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And has bought it?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. I looked at her sympathetically. After all, it was impossible
  for her marry a pauper.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry to hear it," I said hypocritically. "Perhaps the most
  extraordinary part of this affair is that I am really a mining engineer, and
  have been preparing a secret report upon this property."</p>

  <p>She looked at me in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Are you in earnest?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say I am," I answered. "I came over on behalf of a New York
  syndicate, and I posted my report to them last night. I told your father the
  literal truth. The Great Fortuna Mine is not worth twenty thousand
  pence."</p>

  <p>"What a fraud the Count is," she sighed, "and what a lot of money people
  will lose."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but Charlie!"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it makes no difference to Charlie," she said. "I believe he had to
  pay an awful lot of money for those favourable reports, but he's sold out to
  a syndicate for a hundred-thousand pounds. He got the signatories and raised
  the money of them to buy the mine. The syndicate will sell to a company, and,
  of course, the public who buys shares will be the people who will lose their
  money. I think Charlie's quite clever, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I should imagine there's no doubt about it," I assured her.</p>

  <p>We sat for a few minutes in silence. Our hands were still very close
  together. I was feeling exceedingly depressed.</p>

  <p>"We spoke," I remarked, "of something in the nature of a reward."</p>

  <p>"It is quite true," she admitted. "You have earned it. Please sit
  still."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet and bent over me.</p>

  <p>"Close your eyes," she whispered.</p>

  <p>I obeyed her. To this moment I can remember the touch of the sun upon my
  shut eyelids, the rustling of the soft, lazy air through the orange trees,
  the drowsy humming of bees in the garden. I felt her face close to
  mine&mdash;and suddenly the touch of her lips, one whispered word in my ear!
  I had had my reward.</p>

  <p>For a second I remained there, motionless. I lacked the power or the will
  to tear myself away. Then with a little cry I sprang to my feet and hurried
  round the corner of the hotel. I was too late. The hotel omnibus, laden with
  luggage, was rumbling across the square, the Count stood upon the pavement
  waving a florid farewell. A little white hand flashed out of the window. It
  was the last I ever saw of Veronica.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>But one morning, some two months later, I received a packet in an
  unfamiliar handwriting. When I opened it I found one hundred shares in the
  Great Fortuna Silver Mine, and a little scrawl of paper:</p>

  <p>"Charlie says these are very good to sell&mdash;quickly!"</p>

<br>

  <h2><a id="story3">THE HUNDREDTH NIGHT</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Smart Set</i>, Dec 1903</h3>
  <br>

  <p class="first">THE woman sat alone in her dressing-room. For the second
  act, her costume needed no change&mdash;a dash of powder, a trifling
  rearrangement of the hair, had completed in a few seconds her necessary
  preparations. She had dismissed her maid, and denied herself to a lady
  journalist who represented a fashion paper, and wanted to talk about her
  dresses. She felt the need of solitude.</p>

  <p>The girl with the large dark eyes&mdash; who was she? Had she been looking
  into a mirror, back down the long avenue of years to the days of her own
  girlhood, when she, too, had gazed out upon life with, something of the same
  mysterious wonder? Fashions move always in a circle. She, too, had twisted
  her hair somewhat in that fashion, had worn a rose instead of a ribbon, had
  sought with something of the same almost plaintive eagerness to understand,
  if only dimly, the life which throbbed on every side of her.</p>

  <p>Who was she? A ghost? An actual unit of the audience, a living and
  breathing person, or a creature of the fancy only? The violins of the
  orchestra swayed less and less, the music died away. There was silence, and
  then the tinkling of a little bell. The curtain had risen.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes, she was on the stage again, face to face with a
  situation round which, even in these days of the play's assured success,
  controversy raged fiercely. A false note, and daring became grossness; a
  gesture, even a look, and the forbidden was manifest. To conceal it utterly
  was the most exquisite triumph of art. That night, perhaps for the first time
  in her life, the woman wholly succeeded.</p>

  <p>Again the curtain fell amidst a storm of applause, and again the woman sat
  abstracted and thoughtful in her dressing-room. This time she was not left
  undisturbed. A man came in to her, tall, graceful, but with the tired face
  and wrinkled brows of premature age.</p>

  <p>She took no notice of his entrance. He paused to light a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate you," he remarked, drily.</p>

  <p>"Upon what?"</p>

  <p>"Your versatility. You have given a new rendering of Mona to-night. You
  have stripped her of the flesh, lifted her wholly off the clogging earth. But
  I warn you, Emily, the critics won't like it."</p>

  <p>"The critics!"</p>

  <p>"People are so like sheep. They need some one to direct them. They do not
  see the ass's skin, only the mantle of the prophet. And our friends of the
  press do not like to be trifled with."</p>

  <p>The woman sat still, with her back to him. The perfume of his cigarette,
  his presence in her room, the easy nonchalance of his manner, stung her.</p>

  <p>She still looked into the mirror, and still she saw the same things.</p>

  <p>"I must play the part," she said, in a low tone, " as I feel it."</p>

  <p>"Is not that," he remarked, holding his cigarette thoughtfully between his
  fingers, "a little hard upon those who have to play up to you? Last night you
  were flesh and blood, the arrogant courtesan, a marvelous creation. You
  almost frightened me with the reality of it, and one could hear the audience
  holding their breaths&mdash;it was supreme. To-night you rise phoenix-like to
  a virtue which holds evil things abashed. If you are the actual courtesan,
  you are also the embodiment of all the opposite things in life. It may be a
  triumph in originality&mdash;your rendering, I mean&mdash;but it is deuced
  uncomfortable for me."</p>

  <p>The woman smiled, faintly. She understood quite well the reason of his
  annoyance. He was the puppet-actor, born of the times, only possible in this
  period of uninspired plays, a man of graceful presence and musical voice, who
  owed his position to these things, and these things only. The genius that
  made it possible for her suddenly to purify a situation which it was rumored
  had worried the King's censor, had fired no answering impulse in his slower
  wits. His acting had been constrained and unimpressive. He had felt himself
  at sea, and he had shown it. Man-like, he was aggrieved. He had been robbed
  of his meed of applause, the only stimulant not wholly physical which
  appealed to him. This was the hundredth night, too, and the critics were in
  the stalls.</p>

  <p>"I am glad that you felt the change," the woman said, slowly. "Why not
  adapt yourself to it?"</p>

  <p>"Why change?" he answered, irritably. "The piece went well enough before.
  You seem to be trying to transform a magnificent piece of realism into an
  idyll. At this theatre, we do not play to school-children."</p>

  <p>She abandoned the subject a little abruptly. It did not interest her to
  discuss these things with him.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she said, "if you know who some people are, in the third row
  of the stalls&mdash;two elderly ladies, rather oddly dressed, and a child
  with large eyes."</p>

  <p>He prided himself upon knowing everybody, and he did not fail her.</p>

  <p>"Two old maids from the wilds of Scotland, and their niece," he answered.
  "Nugent Campbell, their name is, I think&mdash;the girl's father is the Sir
  Henry Nugent Campbell who did so well out at the war. Beautiful eyes, hasn't
  she?"</p>

  <p>He was examining himself negligently in the mirror; the fold of his tie
  did not altogether please him, or was it his pin that was a trifle crooked?
  Presently, however, he glanced toward her. She was sitting quite still, and
  her hands were clasping the arms of the chair. The natural pallor of her
  complexion seemed intensified. There were things in her face which he did not
  understand.</p>

  <p>"You're seedy, Emily," he exclaimed. "Let me ring for your woman. Have
  some wine, will you?"</p>

  <p>She moved her head toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Go away!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! I can't leave you like this. The curtain will be up in five
  minutes. Let me get you a glass of champagne."</p>

  <p>"Cannot you see that I wish to be alone?" she said. "I am quite well.
  Please go away."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders and departed, closing the door behind him.</p>

  <p>From outside came a momentary wave of strangely mingled sounds, the
  shifting of heavy scenery, the murmur of conversation from the audience, of
  muffled laughter from the wings, the throbbing of violins from the orchestra.
  Then the door closed, and there was silence. The woman rose swiftly, and
  turned the key in the lock.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The duke stopped his sisters on their way out. He addressed them with a
  severity which was belied by the twinkle in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Amelia!" he exclaimed. "I am astonished. Fancy bringing the child to see
  a play like this!"</p>

  <p>Amelia, who had had qualms, looked at him, anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, Robert, but I had no one to consult, and they assured me
  at the library that it was quite the thing to see. If you had kept your
  promise and come in to tea yesterday afternoon, I had a list of plays which I
  had intended to submit to you."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't scold aunt," the girl declared, smiling up at him. "I have
  never enjoyed anything so much in my life. If only it were not so sad!"</p>

  <p>"You were lucky to-night, anyhow," he remarked. " I have never seen Emily
  Royce act like that before."</p>

  <p>"She is beautiful," the girl murmured. " How I should love to see her off
  the stage!"</p>

  <p>The duke hesitated, and then laughed to himself.</p>

  <p>"You shall," he said. "I'm going behind. Hundredth-night celebration, you
  know, and I'll take you if you like."</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes were bright with joy.</p>

  <p>"Auntie, do you hear?" she exclaimed. "Isn't it glorious? Do you mean that
  I shall really see her to speak to?"</p>

  <p>"Robert! You are joking, of course," Miss Amelia exclaimed. "You do not
  seriously propose to take that child behind the scenes?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "Why not? I'll take all of you. Huntingdon will be delighted,
  and it's quite the thing to do, I assure you. Your friend, Lady Martin, and
  her daughters have gone."</p>

  <p>Miss Amelia sighed. "I am sorry to disappoint Esther," she said, "and I do
  not dispute what you say, Robert, but I cannot part with all my old
  prejudices so easily. I do not approve of the theatre. I will not sacrifice
  my principles to the extent of accepting hospitality from the ladies and
  gentlemen who have been kind enough to amuse us."</p>

  <p>The duke nodded his head approvingly. He thoroughly enjoyed his
  sisters.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he remarked, "quite right. Never mind, Esther," he added,
  seeing her gallant effort to hide her disappointment, "I'll take you. You'll
  find my carriage outside, Amelia. Take it home, and send it back to the stage
  door for us. I'll look after Esther."</p>

  <p>"You dear!" the child exclaimed, clinging to his arm. "You don't mind,
  Aunt Amelia?"</p>

  <p>Miss Amelia sighed. "Your uncle would not suggest anything unbefitting, my
  dear," she said. "Our approval is, of course, quite another matter."</p>

  <p>So, presently, Esther found herself in the strangest place she had ever
  imagined in her life. She was on the stage, shut off now from the house by
  the drop-curtain, and thronged with crowds of men and women in evening dress.
  Servants in livery were handing round champagne and sandwiches; all present
  seemed to be talking a great deal, and enjoying themselves immensely.
  Leverson caught sight of the new-comers presently, and came hurrying up.</p>

  <p>"A little niece of mine from the wilds of Scotland, Leverson," the duke
  remarked. "Stage-struck, of course. I've brought her to see what ordinary
  people you all are with your war-paint off. Mr. Arthur Leverson, Miss Nugent
  Campbell."</p>

  <p>The child was shy at first, but Leverson laid himself out to amuse her,
  and it was very easy. He showed her how the lime-light was worked, and
  explained the moving of the scenery.</p>

  <p>They were standing a little apart, talking, when Emily Royce came in.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wonder&mdash;!" the girl exclaimed, eagerly.</p>

  <p>He looked down at her with an amused smile.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Could I&mdash;would she speak to me just for a moment?"</p>

  <p>He was a little annoyed, but he hid it admirably.</p>

  <p>"Of course. I'll take you to her."</p>

  <p>Emily spared him the effort. She detached herself from a little group, and
  came toward them. Leverson murmured the girl's name.</p>

  <p>"I saw you in front, didn't I?" Emily said, smiling. "Somehow, I fancied
  that the theatre was almost a new place to you. Was I right?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," the child answered.</p>

  <p>She was no longer in the least shy. No one had ever looked at her quite so
  kindly as this wonderful woman.</p>

  <p>"I have never been inside the theatre before," Esther admitted. "My aunts
  are&mdash;a little old-fashioned, and we live so far off from everywhere.</p>

  <p>"Go and talk to the Esholts, Mr. Leverson," Emily said. "I am going to
  take possession of Miss Campbell for a little time."</p>

  <p>Leverson withdrew with a subdued grumble meant to sound good-natured, but
  not altogether successful. Emily made the girl sit down on a lounge by her
  side.</p>

  <p>"I noticed you quite at the beginning of the play," she said, smiling.
  "You seemed so absorbed, and you know we people on the stage love to act to
  people who are interested."</p>

  <p>"I think it is marvelous," the child said, still a little shyly, "to think
  that any one can act like you do. I can scarcely believe that I am really
  here talking to you."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about your home in Scotland, and your life there," Emily said.
  "Do you mind? I should so like to hear about it all."</p>

  <p>The child was ready enough to talk. She spoke of the old, gray castle,
  with its prim, well-ordered life; the wonderful hills, with the mystery of
  their inaccessible, mist-wreathed summits; the deep, tree-hung glens; the
  salmon river which came rushing down from some hidden spot; the purple moors
  always so lonely, and growing bleaker and bleaker as they rolled away
  northward. The woman by her side smiled and listened and prompted her every
  now and then with some questions. Behind it all was the strange background of
  gay conversation, the popping of corks, the ceaseless hurrying hither and
  thither of servants.</p>

  <p>"You have very few friends, then?"</p>

  <p>"Very few. My aunts are not fond of strangers or visitors. Sometimes it is
  very dull, especially when the rains come, and the whole country is hidden in
  mists."</p>

  <p>"But your father&mdash;is he never with you?"</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head, gravely.</p>

  <p>"Very, very seldom. He is a soldier, you know, and he is always away
  fighting somewhere. I think that he does not like being at home."</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes, very grave and steadfast, were suddenly troubled.
  Something in the set immobility of Emily's features chilled her.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," she said, "that I am wearying you. I do not know why I have
  talked so much of my little concerns, when I Would so much rather have had
  you tell me about your own wonderful life."</p>

  <p>Emily shook her head. The faint smile which parted her lips was at least
  reassuring.</p>

  <p>"You do not know how interested I have been," she said. "Some day, I hope
  that we shall have another talk."</p>

  <p>"We are in London for two months," Esther said. "Might I come and see
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I think&mdash;we must see," was the unexpectedly evasive answer. "I shall
  write to you."</p>

  <p>A man who had just come in looked at the pair for a moment or two with a
  curious expression. Then he went up to the duke.</p>

  <p>"Ernham," he said, "did you bring your niece here?</p>

  <p>"By Jove, I did, and I've forgotten all about her," the duke answered.
  "Where is she?</p>

  <p>"Sitting on the sofa there, talking to Emily Royce. You had better take
  her home."</p>

  <p>The duke raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know what Emily Royce's name was when she first came on the
  stage?"</p>

  <p>"No idea," the duke admitted, cheerfully. "Never can remember those
  things."</p>

  <p>"Some one might have reminded you," his friend remarked. "It was Emily
  Heddon."</p>

  <p>The duke was staggered. He looked toward the couch. This was the woman,
  then, whom his brother had married, and Esther&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Great heavens!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Esther, I am sorry to interrupt you, but we must go at once," he added, a
  moment later.</p>

  <p>The girl held out her hand to Emily. "Good-bye," she said, simply. "I hope
  that I shall see you again." She felt the touch of her fingers warmly enough
  returned, but for some reason Emily was silent.</p>

  <p>II</p>

  <p>THEY were sitting together in the Park&mdash;not for the first time. The
  girl looked very sweet and fresh in her plain muslin gown and large hat, but
  her clear eyes were a little troubled.</p>

  <p>"You are so much older and wiser than I am," she said, "that I suppose you
  must be right. But I do not like it. I do not think I can come any more."</p>

  <p>"But how else can I see you?" he protested. "You know that your aunts
  dislike the stage and everything connected with it. They would never allow me
  to visit them."</p>

  <p>"It is very perplexing," she admitted. "Aunt Amelia is really very kind to
  me, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he whispered, leaning over toward her, "you do not want to see
  me any more."</p>

  <p>She looked at him a little shyly. Her eyes were full of reproach. She was
  adorably pretty."</p>

  <p>"It is not kind of you to say that," she murmured, "because you know that
  I do."</p>

  <p>He touched her fingers for a moment, and she felt a guilty thrill of joy,
  inexplicable, wonderful. He had had so much experience in these matters,
  every little move was known to him.</p>

  <p>He began to talk, and she to listen, the color coming and going in her
  cheeks, a whole world of new emotions roused, quivering into life by the
  soft, passionate words which came so readily to his lips. Of course, he
  triumphed. It was a foregone conclusion, the battle altogether too one-sided.
  Soon he was walking by her side toward the gates.</p>

  <p>A victoria was stopped close to them, and a woman all in white descended.
  She was paler even than the chiffon which hung from her parasol, but her eyes
  seemed lighted with smoldering fire. Leverson swore under his breath. Even
  Esther felt that there was something inappropriate in the glad little cry of
  welcome which sprang to her lips.</p>

  <p>"How fortunate that I should see you both!" Emily exclaimed. "Miss
  Campbell, I want you to do me a favor. I want you to jump straight into my
  carriage, and let my people take you home."</p>

  <p>"Alone?" the child exclaimed. "But you are coming, too! May I not drive
  with you?"</p>

  <p>Emily shook her head. She denied herself a great deal.</p>

  <p>"The carriage will return for me here," she answered. "I have something
  particular to say to Mr. Leverson."</p>

  <p>Mr. Leverson did not seem at all enchanted at the prospect. His appearance
  was, to say the least, sulky. Nevertheless, his protest was almost
  inarticulate, and Emily simply turned her back upon him. She saw the child
  into the little victoria, and waved her hand in adieu. Then she returned to
  Leverson. They stood face to face upon the broad path.</p>

  <p>"My friend," she said, drily, "I hope you will believe that your
  flirtations and liaisons, of which I am told you are somewhat proud, are, in
  a general way, matters of supreme unimportance to me. In this particular
  case, however, I have something to say. I insist upon it that you discontinue
  your clandestine meetings and all correspondence with that child."</p>

  <p>There were times when Leverson was not handsome, and this was one of them.
  His manner was shifty, his indignation petulant.</p>

  <p>"Really, Mrs. Royce," he said, "I scarcely see that our relations are such
  as to give you the right to dictate to me in such matters."</p>

  <p>She smiled, faintly. She had been the humiliation of his life of amours,
  and she knew it.</p>

  <p>"We will not discuss that," she answered. "I know you through and through,
  Arthur Leverson, and I am going to appeal to your only vulnerable
  spot&mdash;your self-interest. You obey my wishes in this matter, or you
  leave the theatre."</p>

  <p>"You are not serious?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I am very serious indeed. I can do without you&mdash;you cannot do
  without me. Our play is the biggest success London has known for years, and
  your share in it is not worth a snap of the fingers. Yet you share with me
  the honors and the profit. So it shall continue unless you disobey my wishes
  in this matter. If you meet or speak to that child again unchaperoned, you
  go."</p>

  <p>"This is monstrous!" he exclaimed. "I have a vested right in the
  play."</p>

  <p>"You might force me to withdraw it," she answered, "but that would not
  trouble me in the least. I am a rich woman."</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel with a little exclamation, and walked away. Emily
  sat down and waited for her carriage. The immediate effect of Emily's
  intervention was the following note duly delivered at Leverson's rooms on the
  next evening:</p>

  <p class="letter">16, MERSHAM STREET, W.</p>

  <p class="letter">MY DEAREST,</p>

  <p class="letter">I have been so unhappy ever since yesterday, and you have
  not sent me a line. Do write and tell me what it all means. Why should Mrs.
  Royce mind our being together?&mdash;for I feel sure now that she did. You
  are not angry with me for obeying her? I was not sure what you wished me to
  do. You said nothing! You did not even come with me to the carriage. She
  stood between us, and though, when she looked at me, she seemed kind, I felt
  that she was very angry with you. Why? Do write me, dear, and tell me. You
  know that nothing could change me. I shall always be your loving,</p>

  <p class="letter">ESTHER.</p>

  <p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;Aunt Amelia has been so kind today. I felt that
  I must tell her about you. Would it matter very much, do you think?</p>

  <p>Leverson received this note on his return from a supper-party after the
  theatre. He spent a few minutes in deliberation, and then sat down and
  answered it.</p>

  <p class="letter">55, BLENHEIM MANSIONS, W. C.</p>

  <p class="letter">MY OWN DEAREST CHILD,</p>

  <p class="letter">You ask me to explain a very difficult thing, but I shall
  try. I am obliged to see a great deal of Mrs. Royce, aind I have so few other
  women friends that I fancy she has fallen into the way of considering me her
  own special property, to be ordered about and made use of just as suits her
  convenience. I swear to you, dear, that there has never been anything at all
  between us. I have never given her the least cause to believe that I cared
  for her, but you know the great fault of all the women on the stage is
  jealousy, and I fancy that something of that sort was the cause of Mrs.
  Royce's bad temper on Thursday. Please do not think me a conceited ass, dear,
  to tell you these things, but you asked me for the truth, and you have
  it.</p>

  <p class="letter">How I have missed you! Yesterday, I really believe, was the
  longest and dreariest day I have ever spent. What a little witch you are, to
  come and steal your way so easily into my heart!</p>

  <p class="letter">You must not tell your aunt anything yet. I shall explain
  all when we meet, but it would spoil everything to be in too much of a hurry.
  You are going down the river for Sunday, so we cannot meet till Monday. I
  have a little plan for then, which I hope you will like. I want you to come
  here, and have tea with me. There! It sounds terrible, doesn't it, but there
  is really nothing to fear, and it is much the safest way of meeting. I have
  wired to my sister to come up and stay with me so as to make everything quite
  right for you, but, of course, in London no one pretends to be quite so
  conventional as in the country. I would not ask you if it really mattered in
  the least, but I can assure you that up here it is quite a common thing. Do
  you realize, sweetheart, that, as yet, I have never really had you quite to
  myself? Perhaps that is why I am looking forward to Monday more than I have
  ever looked forward to anything in my life. You will not disappoint me, dear?
  No; I am sure that you will not. Get here about four o'clock, and I shall be
  waiting to open the door myself. Ever your fond lover,</p>

  <p class="letter">ARTHUR.</p>

  <p>He despatched the note, and laughed softly to himself as he lighted a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"She will come," he murmured. "She is such a dear little fool."</p>

  <p>He was right. She came, but it had cost her a great effort, and even his
  most impressive greeting, and the touch of his arm about her waist, did not
  wholly reassure her. Her hands were cold, and she was trembling a little.</p>

  <p>"Where is your sister, Arthur?" she asked, looking round the room with
  dark, anxious eyes.</p>

  <p>"She will be here directly, dearest," he answered. "Her train is a little
  late. Come and sit down in my own easy-chair, and tell all about these last
  few days. Do you know that I have not yet had even one tiny little kiss from
  you!"</p>

  <p>She kept him away from her for a moment. She was looking very grave, and
  there was even a suspicion of tears in her dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"Arthur," she faltered, "of course, it is delightful to be here with you,
  but I have all the time the feeling that I have done something dreadful. Tell
  me, dear&mdash;please tell me the truth. Is it very horrid of me to come?
  Listen! Is that your sister, do you think?"</p>

  <p>He smiled reassuringly at her, and opened his arms. For the moment, he
  wished that he had not invented that sister.</p>

  <p>"Very likely, dear," he answered. "My man has orders to let no one else
  in. We are quite safe."</p>

  <p>But Leverson had not reckoned with the temptation of gold to a servant
  whose wages were very much in arrears.</p>

  <p>The door was thrown open, and Mrs. Royce entered. Behind her was the duke.
  Leverson felt his ro1e of heroic lover slipping away from him. His knees
  began to shake. He did not like the way the duke closed the door.</p>

  <p>Emily went straight up to the child.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she said, "you ought not to be here. You must go away."</p>

  <p>Esther disengaged herself, not without a certain quiet dignity.</p>

  <p>"I know that I have done wrong, Mrs. Royce," she said, "but I really do
  not see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She could not finish her sentence. Emily was humanized. Even the child saw
  the tenderness quivering in her soft eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know you mean kindly," she cried, " but why do you want to come
  between Arthur and me? His sister will be here directly."</p>

  <p>His sister! Emily held the child's hands tightly. The quickest blow was
  the kindest.</p>

  <p>"He has told you, then, of a sister whom he does not possess; has he told
  you, I wonder, of a wife whom he does?"</p>

  <p>The girl turned deathly pale. Leverson, without means of defense, turned
  his back upon them.</p>

  <p>"A&mdash;a wife!"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Leverson," Emily continued, "has a wife, singing, I believe, in an
  East End music-hall, and from whom he cannot procure a divorce owing to their
  mutual irregularities. He is a coward, and a liar, and a dishonorable person.
  Ask him any questions you like. I want this parting to be final."</p>

  <p>"Will you turn around, please, Arthur?" the girl asked, quietly.</p>

  <p>He faced them&mdash;self-proclaimed a craven. The girl looked into his
  face, and she turned very white. Then she turned to Emily. She did not ask
  him any question at all.</p>

  <p>"I have been very foolish," she said, softly. " I did not know&mdash;that
  there were people like this in the world. Will you take me away?"</p>

  <p>The duke remained behind. He was a strong man, and Leverson was a coward.
  Leverson did not play that night, nor for many succeeding ones.</p>

  <p>III</p>

  <p>A CRITIC in the stall shook open his programme.</p>

  <p>"These revivals," he murmured, "should be prohibited. There are no plays
  written nowadays which can stand the test."</p>

  <p>"You chaps always talk like that," grumbled his companion. "What do you
  come for?"</p>

  <p>"Bread and cheese, of course. But come, I will be honest," the critic
  continued, settling down in his seat. "It is not altogether so with me in
  this case. If the chief hadn't sent me, I should have paid my own
  ten-and-six, and come, and if there hadn't been a stall, I should have
  brought my own camp-stool, and joined the cranks who besiege the pit."</p>

  <p>"And if you had overslept yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I should have taken my chance at the gallery. Failing that, I should have
  pawned my watch and secured a box."</p>

  <p>"In plain words," his companion remarked, "you meant to come."</p>

  <p>"I was bound to come," the critic said, almost gravely. "Wild horses could
  not have kept me away."</p>

  <p>"Of course, you will explain," his friend murmured. " I always looked upon
  a real professional critic as superior to enthusiasm, curiosity or honesty.
  Are you going to disillusionize me?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," the critic answered. "Do you really want to know why I was so
  keen to come?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>The critic folded up his programme. The orchestra were beginning to tune
  their violins.</p>

  <p>"I will try and tell you, then. Forgive me if I am not very lucid. It is a
  very hard thing to put it all into words. The play was always a remarkable
  one. From the first, Emily Royce gave us a wonderful representation of the
  heroine. But here comes the point of it all. Up to the night of its hundredth
  celebration, we came to one play; from that to its three-hundredth, we came
  to an entirely different one. I do not believe that a single word of the play
  was altered. The cast, except for Leverson, who never counted seriously,
  remained precisely the same. And yet it was a different play. One woman's
  supreme genius transformed it all."</p>

  <p>"Go on!" his companion begged. "I am interested."</p>

  <p>"There is so little more to say," the critic continued. "For some reason
  or other, on the night of the hundredth performance, Emily Royce chose to
  transform her whole rendering of the part. That accounts for the
  extraordinary diversity of opinion you meet with concerning the play. There
  are women who say that when they came they preferred a dark seat, and would
  sooner have taken their daughters to the old Moulin Rouge. There are others
  of equal discernment and judgment, who protest that it is the purest and most
  moral play they have ever seen. Both are right. A woman's genius lifted it
  from the grim fascination of inimitable, but awful, realism to an idyll.
  Psychologically, I have never met with such an interesting circumstance. I
  have the idea, somehow, that the change was a momentary inspiration of Emily
  Royce's. I do not believe that Leverson, for instance, on that hundredth
  night, knew where he was. He had not the wit to adapt himself, and he
  floundered horribly. Emily Royce did well to get rid of him. He was always an
  overrated man. Now, we shall see."</p>

  <p>Half-way through the first act, his friend whispered to the critic: "Which
  is it going to be?"</p>

  <p>"The realism!" the critic answered. "Look at that gesture! Ugh!"</p>

  <p>A little party who had arrived late stole into their places, a tall,
  gray-haired man, followed by a younger one, both deeply bronzed, both
  obviously soldiers&mdash;a beautiful girl with wonderful eyes, and the duke.
  The critic reached suddenly for his glasses.</p>

  <p>"Watch Emily Royce," he whispered. "She is ill."</p>

  <p>She certainly swayed for a moment, and seemed to forget her part. The time
  for her exit had arrived. She cut a wonderful speech and departed, leaving
  the audience unimpressed. The curtain fell upon the act, and the critic
  sighed.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry I came," he said. "She has lost her power. That speech was the
  crucial point, and she lost her nerve. What a pity."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, an hour or so later the critic showed that he was human. He,
  too, with all those others, stood up and shouted till the roof seemed to
  shake with the thunder of acclaiming voices. He, too, felt his eyes dim, a
  curious lump in his throat. It was marvelous that a woman could play like
  this upon the heartstrings of hardened men.</p>

  <p>Emily Royce did not answer the shouts which seemed almost to demand her
  presence. A great actor, who for once in his life felt himself a nonentity,
  presented her excuses. Mrs. Royce was only just recovered from a serious
  illness. She had acted against her physician's advice. She was very deeply
  grateful to them for their magnificent summons, but she was not able to
  answer it. So the lights went out, and the people unwillingly departed. The
  hush of a wonderful enthusiasm seemed to hover still over the house like a
  live thing, compelling reverence, forbidding the interchange of all
  after-theatre inanities. The critic strode into the street, and walked
  straight to his club without saying a word.</p>

  <p>Emily Royce sat in her room, trembling in every limb, very white and very
  miserable.</p>

  <p>"It was cruel of her to come!" she murmured. "She must know!"</p>

  <p>She did not hear the knock at the door. Swift footsteps crossed the floor,
  a pair of arms were thrown around her neck. The child was there on her
  knees.</p>

  <p>"I have never thanked you," the child cried. " I never could. I have
  brought&mdash;somebody else."</p>

  <p>A bronzed man held out his hands.</p>

  <p>"It was my wretched temper, Emily," he declared. "You saved our
  child&mdash;God bless you! Won't you take pity on me?"</p>

  <p>The duke stole out, and drew the young man after him."</p>

  <p>"Here, Morton," he said, "Esther can spare you for a moment. Cut round to
  the Savoy, private room for five. Tell Joseph I give him <i>carte
  blanche</i>. I'll bring the family party along presently. Tell him I'll break
  his head if it isn't the best supper he's ever served."</p>

  <p>The duke listened anxiously at the door for a moment. Then he drew a sigh
  of relief, and lighted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"It'll be all right," he declared, softly.</p>

    "I have no wish at all," she answered stiffly, "to intrude upon your
    hospitality."</li>

    <li><a href="#picLGL3">Illustration 3.</a><br>
    What followed was probably the most amazing thing Esther had ever
    witnessed.</li>
  </ul><br>

  <p class="first">STOURTON forgot at once the gloomy, half-lit appearance of
  the house, the cold, uninhabited air of the hall and passages, the sombre
  bearing of the solitary manservant who had ushered him in. This grey-headed
  old lady, with the delightful face and quaint air of having stepped out of
  some mediaeval picture, but whose unfortunate deformity was only too
  apparent, charmed him at first sight. She sat in a great chair before a fire
  heaped with logs of wood, whose pleasant heat seemed to strike a reassuring
  note after the draughts and general chilliness through which he had passed.
  Her smile of welcome lent her features a sweetness which was more than
  sufficient compensation for those misshapen shoulders. A cloud of vague
  misgivings vanished as he bent over her outstretched hands.</p>

  <p>"It is Mr. Ronald Stourton, I am sure!" she murmured. "You've done me so
  great a kindness that I scarcely know how to welcome you."</p>

  <p>He laughed good-humouredly and began to unfasten his travelling coat.</p>

  <p>"You expected me, then?"</p>

  <p>"Max, my nephew, telegraphed that you would bring me the letter. I cannot
  tell you how important it is to me, how thankful I am to you."</p>

  <p>He produced a long, leather case, and taking a letter from it, carefully
  replaced the portfolio in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"It is a very small matter, this, for gratitude," he said. "Only I am
  afraid that I must ask you to excuse my remaining here, even for a moment.
  Technically I believe that I am guilty of a misdemeanour in paying even this
  hurried call. I have to be in Downing Street as quickly as possible."</p>

  <p>She poured out a cup of coffee from an arrangement of wonderful appearance
  which stood by her side.</p>

  <p><a id="picLGL1"
     name="picLGL1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><img src=

        title="Illustration">

  <p>"Do not stay for a moment longer than you wish," she murmured: "but you
  must positively have something to warm you before you go. I am sure that you
  are cold. I know what crossing is like in such weather. Ah! I see that you
  are smiling at my machine. Well, coffee is one of my hobbies. I always make
  it myself, and my friends are so good-natured as to pretend that they like
  it. You must give me your honest opinion. Will you pardon me if I just glance
  through this letter? There is a question, then, which I want to ask you about
  Max."</p>

  <p>He accepted the cup of coffee, as he would have accepted almost anything
  from such a delightful old lady. He sipped it first. It was strong and of a
  delicious flavour. He drank it off and set down the cup. Suddenly, as he
  stood upright again, a queer giddiness assailed him. His hand went up to his
  head and he staggered back. The floor rose beneath his feet. Strange sounds
  throbbed in his ears. He clutched at the air with outstretched hands. He
  tried in vain to drag his limbs towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens!" he cried. "Let me out! I am ill! Let me out!
  Send&mdash;for a cab! Eighteen&mdash;Downing Street!"</p>

  <p>He collapsed and lay stretched upon the floor. The little old lady sat and
  watched him over the top of her letter. The smile which parted her lips now
  was of altogether another order.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"For your muscles," the girl said, looking up at his averted face with a
  quiet smile, "I must always entertain a most profound respect. But as for
  your manners, I think that they are abominable!"</p>

  <p>The man was a little startled. He looked at her quickly, and meeting the
  laughter in her eyes, drew himself up stiffly.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry if I have given offence," he said. "May I ask in what way I
  have laid myself open to such a rebuke?"</p>

  <p>She leaned a little forward, as though to look into his face, but his
  broad-brimmed hat was pulled well over his forehead, and his profile was as
  expressionless as though carved out of stone. She raised her eyebrows
  humorous self-expostulation, The man was impossible but so tantalising.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "your first appearance upon the scene was opportune
  enough. I came round the corner running for my life, and after me the tramp.
  I was so overjoyed to see you that I forgot to look where I was going, caught
  my foot in the root of a tree, or something horrid, and over I went."</p>

  <p>"I trust," he said, "that you are not going to attribute your sprained
  ankle to my appearance."</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish!" she answered. "It is your manners I am attacking now.
  There I lay stretched upon the ground&mdash;a pretty object I must have
  looked&mdash;waiting for someone to help me up, and you, well, you ignored me
  in favour of the tramp. It is detestable!"</p>

  <p>He bit his lip&mdash;it might have been to check a smile.</p>

  <p>"I had an idea," he said, "that you were in no hurry. The tramp was!"</p>

  <p>"In no hurry!" she repeated. "Heavens! have you ever tried lying on your
  face, with half of you in a furze bush, your skirts all disarranged, and no
  positive assurance that your leg wasn't broken?"</p>

  <p>"I have never tried it," he answered "but I was very anxious to make the
  acquaintance of your tramp."</p>

  <p>"So anxious that you ignored me!" she retorted.</p>

  <p>"I thought," he said, "that you would wait."</p>

  <p>The girl leaned right forward this time, and to look into her companion's
  face. What she saw to some extent satisfied her.</p>

  <p>"You took a great deal for granted," she replied. " And I think you were
  very brutal to the tramp."</p>

  <p>The man's lip curled slightly.</p>

  <p>"Shall I go back and apologise?" he asked. "As for being brutal to him
  that is nonsense. He deserved punishing, and he got it."</p>

  <p>"And I had to pick myself up!"</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," he exclaimed [...], "the other affair was more
  important."</p>

  <p>The girl frowned slightly. After all, there was something of the boor
  about this man.</p>

  <p>"My name," she said, "is Esther Stanmore. My father will wish to add his
  thanks to mine. Will you let me know your name, and where he will find you
  when he returns?"</p>

  <p>Then the man really smiled. He seemed for the first time to find a grim
  humour in the situation.</p>

  <p>"My name is John Paulton," he said. "I am a friend of your father's
  gamekeeper, Heggs, and he has lent me his cottage for the summer. I believe
  your father has taken him up to Scotland for a few months."</p>

  <p>If he had expected to surprise her, he was disappointed. She accepted his
  information as the most natural in the world.</p>

  <p>"I remember hearing about your coming, Mr. Paulton," she said, "and I have
  seen you in the woods. I am ever so grateful to you, of course, but I wish
  you would notice that I am limping."</p>

  <p>He slackened his pace at once.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," he said." Is there anything I can do to relieve you?
  Will you rest here while I go up to the house for a pony?"</p>

  <p>"How can you think of such a thing," she exclaimed, "after the fright I
  have had?"</p>

  <p>"Then I really don't see&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"You might offer me your arm," she suggested. "I don't think that I can
  walk any further alone."</p>

  <p>He did as she asked in silence. She leaned heavily upon him, and they
  moved slowly along the path. He seemed determined not to encourage any
  conversation. She, however, was of another mind.</p>

  <p>"Are you quite alone in Heggs's cottage?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have a friend with me," he answered.</p>

  <p>"A dark, clean-shaven man, rather pale?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He was standing at the gate when I came by," she remarked.</p>

  <p>He frowned.</p>

  <p>"And I recognised him," she continued.</p>

  <p>"Indeed!"</p>

  <p>"He used to be my cousin's servant," she remarked. "The best man he ever
  had, I have heard him say."</p>

  <p>He bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"It is quite probable," he answered shortly. "I believe that he used to be
  in service, before&mdash;before he saved some money."</p>

  <p>They emerged from the wood. The footpath which crossed the field in front
  of them led past a cottage built of grey stone, and with an ancient,
  red-tiled roof. A man was leaning over the gate, smoking a pipe. Directly he
  saw them, he thrust the pipe in his pocket and disappeared. The girl
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your friend," she remarked, "is shy."</p>

  <p>The man muttered something underneath his breath. The girl's smile
  deepened. She pointed to the cottage.</p>

  <p>"I shall not try to walk any further," she said. "I am going to beg the
  hospitality of your porch. Do you think that if we asked your friend very
  nicely, he would go up to the Hall for me, and tell them to send a groom down
  with a pony and a side-saddle?"</p>

  <p>He opened the gate and motioned her to enter, with a gesture of grave
  politeness.</p>

  <p>"I will find you a chair," he said, "and then, if you will permit me, I
  will go myself to the Hall."</p>

  <p>His anxiety to escape was a little too obvious. She answered him
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"That must be altogether as you wish," she declared. "I am only sorry to
  give you so much trouble. If my foot were not very painful, I would struggle
  on somehow or other; but I am sure that I could not manage the stiles."</p>

  <p>"If you will excuse me for a moment," he answered, "I will fetch you a
  chair. There is not the slightest necessity for you to walk any further."</p>

  <p>She heard his voice inside&mdash;quick, imperative, alert, the other man's
  smooth and respectfully acquiescent. The girl smiled to herself. This was so
  like the conversation of two friends! Did he really think that she was to be
  so easily hoodwinked?</p>

  <p>Presently he came out, carrying a chair, which he placed carefully in a
  corner of the tiny lawn overgrown with wild flowers.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse my not asking you in," he said shortly. "The rooms are
  small and stuffy. It is much pleasanter out here."</p>

  <p>"I have no wish at all," she answered stiffly, "to intrude upon your
  hospitality. Thanks very much for the chair, though."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything I can do for your&mdash;ankle?" he asked uncomfortably.
  "Would you like some&mdash;er&mdash;some hot water?"</p>

  <p>She looked down at her foot gravely.</p>

  <p>"You might feel whether it seems to you very much swollen," she answered,
  lifting it a few inches from the ground.</p>

  <p>He stooped down and took it carefully into his hand. It was a long,
  slender foot, very soundly but daintily shod, and there was a faint silken
  rustle as she moved it carefully backwards and forwards. He held it for a
  moment very lightly&mdash;perhaps for a little more than a moment. Then he
  rose abruptly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I cannot feel any swelling at all," he announced.</p>

  <p>She was much relieved.</p>

  <p>"I dare say, then, that it is nothing serious," she declared cheerfully.
  "I am so glad. If there is anything I detest, it is having to stay
  indoors."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly tedious," he admitted. "I do not think that you need fear
  anything of the sort in this case, though."</p>

  <p>"I am so fond of walking&mdash;in the woods," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Left rather abruptly alone, the girl found herself confronted with a moral
  problem. Mr. John Paulton, as he had called himself, had excited her
  curiosity. The means of gratifying it were close at band. Was she justified
  in using them? The man inside the cottage was, of course, his servant. He had
  stayed once at the Hall with her cousin, and would doubtless answer any of
  her questions. It was not, she admitted to herself reluctantly, a nice thing
  to do; but, on the other hand, Heggs had no right to lend his cottage to
  mysterious strangers who might be biding from their creditors, or from even
  worse things. It was inconsiderate of Heggs, especially as she was alone at
  the Hall. She decided that she had the right to investigate the matter
  thoroughly. And of course she did nothing of the sort. Even when the man came
  out a few minutes later to once more offer her some tea, she let him go
  without a single question. It was not possible.</p>

  <p>He was back again in less than half an hour, followed by the groom with a
  pony. He helped her into the saddle and stood bareheaded to see her go.</p>

  <p>"I feel," she said, looking down at him with a very expressive light in
  her soft, grey eyes, "that I haven't thanked you half enough."</p>

  <p>"Please do not think any more of such a trifle," he protested. "Your game
  keeper would have done all that I did just as effectually."</p>

  <p>"But my gamekeeper was not there," she objected.</p>

  <p>"It was my good fortune," he answered gravely. "Nothing more."</p>

  <p>She gathered up the reins and smiled down at him. The men whom Esther
  Stanmore smiled upon seldom forgot it.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to confine my afternoon walks to the home woods," she
  remarked. "They are just as pretty, really. Good afternoon, Mr. Paulton. We
  are such close neighbours that we are certain to come across one another
  again soon, I hope."</p>

  <p>But Paulton, though he bowed, did not echo her wish.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>And yet in less than three weeks they had reached the end, the last
  barrier through which one looks into Paradise.</p>

  <p>"They were seated on the trunk of a fallen tree, the sunshine distorted
  into queer, zigzag stripes and gleams playing away from their feet into the
  heart of the silent wood. A squirrel had just scampered across the path. From
  the hidden places beyond, a pigeon was calling softly to his mate, a
  woodpecker was busy amongst the branches of a beech-tree, and all the while
  the west wind sang in the rustling canopy above their heads. They alone of
  all the living things were silent.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, at last, "that up to now I have dreamed, not lived.
  The commencement of life is here."</p>

  <p>She looked at him a little wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"You are losing your sense of proportion," she remarked, smiling. "It is
  here, if you will, that one may dream of life and be happy. Yet it can be
  nothing save an interlude. Life is not in these woods&mdash;no, not the
  commencement or the end of life. It is the Paradise of dumb beasts, this. We,
  alas! have to seek for our Paradise in different places."</p>

  <p>"A month ago," he said slowly, keeping his eye fixed upon the ground, "I
  should have needed no one to have told me where Paradise lay. If I were the
  Ronald Stourton of a month ago, I should not hesitate for a single second to
  grasp it&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>"Ronald Stourton!" she repeated softly. So you are Ronald Stourton!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered. "I have heard you speak of my people."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were in Paris."</p>

  <p>"I was. I came to England on an important mission from the chief to the
  Prime Minister a month ago. I bungled it hopelessly. I was taken in by a
  trick which should not have deceived a child. There isn't any particular
  secret about it now. I brought across a draft of the proposed understanding
  between France and England as to their neutrality in the Russo-Japanese war.
  The draft was stolen from me by an agent of the Russian Government or by
  someone who means to dispose of it to the Russian Government. I am suspended
  for the present. Immediately the draft is transferred to the Russian
  Ambassador, and the thing comes out, I shall be dismissed the service."</p>

  <p>She looked at him? as a woman knows how to look at such times. Her hand
  rested lightly upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am so sorry," she said softly. "I felt all the time that you were
  in trouble. But can nothing be done? Can't the person be found who stole the
  paper?"</p>

  <p>"The cleverest detective in England has the matter in hand," he answered,
  "and it was at his particular request that I disappeared. The person whom he
  strongly suspects is being watched day and night, and it is supposed that he
  has not yet had an opportunity of disposing of the papers. That is why I am
  still merely on leave. It is a sickening story, but I am glad that you know
  the truth. You will understand now why I must go away."</p>

  <p>"I understand nothing of the sort," she answered decisively. "Of course,
  it is shocking bad luck; but even if you have to give up your profession,
  there is plenty of other work in the world for a man, isn't there? How old
  are you?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. He thought her manner charming, but it was certainly
  original.</p>

  <p>"I am thirty-four next birthday. Too old, you see, for any of the
  services. I might go abroad, of course; but it is a far cry from diplomacy to
  ranching."</p>

  <p>She looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You are well off, aren't you?" she remarked. " Most of your family
  are."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered drily, " I am well off. I am spared the luxury of
  having to work for a living, at any rate. But I am a sorry idler."</p>

  <p>"Quite right!" she assented. "I detest men who do nothing. It always ends
  in their dabbling in things which they don't understand at all."</p>

  <p>He groaned.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" he begged, digging his stick savagely into the ground. "I can see
  myself &mdash;a J.P., perhaps a county councillor, a director of City
  companies&mdash;Heaven knows what!"</p>

  <p>"Aren't you a little premature?" she said, smiling. "You are not sure yet
  that you have finished with diplomacy."</p>

  <p>"I am perfectly certain that diplomacy has finished with me," he answered
  ruefully. "Pardon me!"</p>

  <p>He picked up the letter which had slipped from her waistband and handed it
  to her. His eyes by chance fell upon the address, and he started.</p>

  <p>"Miss de Poulgasky!" he repeated. "Forgive me, but I could not help
  seeing. It seems strange to see that name here."</p>

  <p>She nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"It is her father, of course, to whom those papers will be sent," she
  remarked. "I was at school with Corona, and we write to one another now and
  then. My uncle, who came down last night, seems very friendly with them. This
  letter is really from him. And that reminds me. I am no longer without a
  chaperon. I want you to come and dine with us to-night."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me! I am not in a fit humour to meet people."</p>

  <p>"There is only my uncle, and I think that perhaps he may amuse you. He is
  such a thorough cosmopolitan. I believe that he is equally at home in every
  capital of Europe, and he has the most marvellous collection of anecdotes.
  Come and dine, and afterwards I will show you my rose-garden."</p>

  <p>"If you will&mdash;" Their heads came very close together. He seemed to
  have a good deal to say, and she was very well content to listen. In the end
  he forgot for a brief space of time all hid troubles. And she forgot to post
  her letter.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>He was watching the sunset from the terrace. Behind him was the empty
  drawing-room. He had arrived, after all, a little early; eight o'clock was
  only just striking by the stable clock. She could scarcely be down yet. He
  had left her barely an hour ago, and he was in no humour for a
  <i>tête-à-tête</i> with this wonderful uncle. So he leaned over the worn,
  grey balustrade and wondered which way the rose-garden might he. Were other
  men so much the sport of Fate as this, he asked himself bitterly, that the
  greatest joy of life should shine down upon him whose feet were fast set in
  the quagmires&mdash;a tantalising dream&mdash;an impossible&mdash;yes, an
  impossible&mdash;?</p>

  <p>Then the chain of his thoughts was snapped. Every pulse of his body seemed
  to cease beating. He was listening. Behind, in the drawing-room, someone was
  talking to Esther, and the voice&mdash;what folly! He turned slowly round as
  one who expects to confront a ghost. Esther was standing in the window, and
  by her side a smooth, clean-shaven old gentleman in glasses, who smiled
  benevolently upon him and went on talking. What folly! He dragged himself to
  meet them. He was ill at ease, scarcely conscious of where he was. But he
  watched Esther's uncle. His manner was certainly queer, but he watched. He
  saw things which sent the blood rushing through his veins at fever heat.</p>

  <p>Dinner was served at a small, round table drawn close up to the open
  window. The Stanmore cook was famous, and Esther's uncle had had a word or
  two with the butler about the wines. Nevertheless, it was an ill-balanced
  trio, and Stourton especially was talking all the time at random. Mr. Heslop
  Stanmore was quietly entertaining, but Esther was too worried at her guest's
  strange demeanour to find much pleasure in her uncle's conversation. She made
  several attempts to establish more natural relations between the two men, but
  without the least success. She felt all the time that there was nothing they
  both of them desired so much as her absence. At last she got up and left
  them.</p>

  <p>"I shall give you a quarter of an hour, no more," she said, glancing at
  Stourton. "You can smoke where you choose here."</p>

  <p>The butler with great care set the Château Yquem and port upon the table
  and withdrew. Then Mr. Heslop Stanmore leaned back in his chair and laughed
  softly.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he exclaimed, "you have my sympathy. You have indeed.
  All the time you have been getting surer and surer, longing to get up and
  take me by the throat; and instead you have had to swallow your dinner and
  make polite speeches. Come, you can relieve yourself now. All your suspicions
  are correct. I am the little, hunchbacked lady of Hyde Park Terrace. I stole
  those papers? it is my profession, you see. I am very sorry indeed to have
  inconvenienced you; but one must live, and I am a younger son."</p>

  <p>"Where are they?" Stourton asked between his teeth.</p>

  <p>Mr. Heslop Stanmore shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "I am thankful that you did not ask me that
  question a few hours ago, or I might have been compelled to have resorted to
  subterfuge. I have had the utmost difficulty&mdash;by the by, you really
  ought to try this Château Yquem. No?&mdash;the utmost difficulty in disposing
  of them. I have been watched day and night, and so has Poulgasky's house.
  However, I have managed it at last. My niece Esther, with whom, by the by,
  you seem to be on remarkably good terms, is an old school-friend of Corona
  Poulgasky's, and I got her to enclose my papers this morning in a letter to
  her. The post went out, 1 believe," he continued, raising his wineglass and
  looking critically at its contents, "at four o'clock. A delivery is made in
  London to-night. It is just a question&mdash;rather a near thing, I should
  imagine&mdash;whether those papers are not already in Poulgasky's hands."</p>

  <p>"Did Es&mdash; Miss Stanmore know what she was doing?" Stourton
  groaned.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," her uncle remonstrated, "do you think that I should dare
  to give away my secrets to a child? She has not the slightest idea!"</p>

  <p>Esther stepped suddenly in through the window. Her forehead was slightly
  wrinkled. She held something in her hand.</p>

  <p>"My dear uncle, will you ever forgive me?" she exclaimed. "I started for
  the post, but I forgot all about my letter."</p>

  <p>What followed was probably the most amazing thing Esther had ever
  witnessed. Her uncle made a spring for the letter which she held in her hand,
  only to find himself caught by the throat and flung back into his chair.
  Stourton stood over him, grim and threatening. Just in time he saw the glint
  of steel. The revolver fell harmlessly upon the floor; a strong hand held him
  like a vice. Then Ronald turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Esther," he said, "will you give me that letter?"</p>

  <p>She was very pale, but she did not hesitate for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand why," she answered; "but if you ask for it, of course
  I will."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heslop Stanmore, with Stourton's knuckles very near his throat, did
  not find speech easy. But he said one word!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They opened his wedding present a little dubiously. It was a copy of
  Harrison's "First Steps in Diplomacy." They looked at one another and
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," she said, wiping the tears from her eyes, "that my uncle is
  a very black sheep, but he certainly has a sense of humour."</p>

  <p>Stourton put the book carefully on one side.</p>

  <p>"We will treasure this volume," he remarked. "Some day, when your uncle
  has a birthday, I will send him a little text-book I have on the art of
  'Making Up.'"</p>

    Stourton threw the note into the flames.</li>
  </ul><br>

  <p class="first">STOURTON, for the first time since he had left Downing
  Street, released his hold of the despatch-box. Both doors of the railway
  carriage in which he was seated were locked, on both windows was pasted a
  modest oblong label announcing that the compartment was reserved. There was
  no lavatory, and he had already looked carefully under the seats. Outside on
  the platform a liberally tipped servant of the company stood before the
  carriage door to prevent any attempt at intrusion. Stourton, with a little
  sigh of relief, set down the box on the middle seat opposite to him, lit a
  cigar, and opened the evening paper.</p>

  <p>The great black headlines, which for the the last four hours had been
  placarded all over London, took up one half of the paper.</p><br>

  <p class="headline">CHINA AND JAPAN.<br>
  DECLARATION OF WAR.<br>
  JAPAN APPEALS TO HER ALLY.<br>
  BARON NAGASKI AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE.<br>
  CABINET COUNCIL NOW SITTING.</p><br>

  <p>The headlines themselves told all that was known. The news had come
  without warning, and following hard upon a slight Japanese reverse on the
  Yalu. But the news itself was incomplete. Already the mighty engines of Fleet
  Street were at work. To-morrow morning's papers would provide even more
  sensational reading. Barely two hours ago startling intelligence had been
  flashed across the Channel. Orders for the mobilisation of the French Fleet
  had already been posted. The two great Powers, who had, only a few weeks ago,
  amidst a shower of congratulations, concluded an agreement which seemed
  likely to ensure a permanent peace, were, with a suddenness which had no
  parallel in the modern history of nations, on the very brink of war.</p>

  <p>The whistle sounded for the departure of the train. Suddenly Stourton was
  aware of some disturbance upon the platform. A tall, fair-haired woman, whose
  long opera-cloak imperfectly concealed her evening clothes, was trying to
  make her way past the official who stood before the carriage door. Stourton,
  with an exclamation of alarm, sprang to his feet and let down the window.
  Even in that moment of astonishment he did not forget his caution. He caught
  up the despatch-box and held it in his left hand.</p>

  <p>"Esther!" he exclaimed. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>The official stood aside. The train was already moving. She had almost to
  run to keep up with it.</p>

  <p>"Heslop Stanmore is in Paris!" she cried breathlessly. "I found my maid
  sending him a telegram. He wanted to know-- exactly--when you left. Take
  care!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic2AM1"
     name="pic2AM1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300341h-images/TheTwoAmbassadors1.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>She could keep up no longer. She was already flushed and panting. He waved
  his hand reassuring and shouted a farewell. Then he fastened the window and
  resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"The little grey lady," he muttered to himself. "Esther's maid
  bribed--made friends with her down at ---- of course. He can't think that I'm
  such a blithering fool as to walk into another trap. If he tries it--"</p>

  <p>Stourton's fingers clasped something in the pocket of his overcoat, and
  his face was suddenly hard. He was thinking of the weeks of misery which this
  man had caused him less than a year ago. Another conflict might end
  differently.</p>

  <p>Stourton's nerves were almost perfect, but he would scarcely have been
  human if he had not been conscious of some anxiety. Any successful tampering
  with his mission might mean the kindling of the war-torch throughout the
  world. It might mean the pouring out to waste of the accumulated millions of
  centuries of industry, it might retard the whole progress of civilisation for
  many decades. The bare possibility of the thing was appalling. And yet when
  he stopped for a moment to reflect, the absolute security of his position was
  borne in upon him. He carried a fateful message with him, but it was a verbal
  one. There were no means of wresting from him words which his memory and
  tongue could alone make real. He had important papers, too, but they were in
  cipher...</p>

  <p>[-- Portion of text missing from source file --]</p>

  <p>...brought him a certain amount of consolation, but he did not for a
  moment relax him watchfulness, though the train was speeding now on its way
  to Dover without any intervening stop. He sat quite still. The despatch-box
  was within his reach, a loaded revolver upon his knee.</p>

  <p>At the pier station he descended, making his way along the platform and
  across the gangway to the steamer. Two men of unobtrusive appearance, quietly
  but unfashionably dressed, were his nearest neighbours, one walking a little
  behind, and one in front. No sign of recognition passed between Stourton and
  them, yet he knew very well who they were and what their presence meant. On
  board the steamer he made his way at once to the cabin which had been
  reserved for him. The two men ordered deck-chairs outside. With the cabin
  door locked, and two of the shrewdest detectives from Scotland Yard within a
  few feet of him, Stourton felt fairly secure against even such a man as
  Heslop Stanmore, yet he never relaxed his watchfulness. He neither ate nor
  drank. He simply sat and watched the despatch-box.</p>

  <p>At Calais the same programme was repeated, only this time, without speech
  but as though by previous arrangement, the two man shared his <i>coupé</i> in
  the train. Stourton, ignoring their presence, behaved exactly as though he
  had only himself to rely upon. With the despatch-box upon his knees, covered
  over by a thick travelling-rug, he sat alert and sleepless throughout the
  whole of the journey. Still nothing happened. Paris was reached without
  incident.</p>

  <p>Here on the platform the two men closed in upon him, one on either side.
  Although they had no luggage, they chartered a small station omnibus, and a
  few minutes after the arrival of the train they were on their way to the
  British Embassy. The grey twilight of dawn was already breaking over the
  city, but there were traces still on the boulevards of the excitement which
  throughout the night had kept the streets and cafés thronged with people. The
  news from the East had stirred Paris in the same degree as London. Everywhere
  it was agreed that a favourable reply from England to the appeal of her ally
  must mean war, and already momentous steps had been taken. Stourton smiled
  slightly as he looked in upon one of the still brilliantly lit cafés. He
  carried the news which was to decide the question of peace and war. A word
  from him, and these people might have gone quietly home to their beds. And
  that word was to be spoken during the next few minutes.</p>

  <p>The omnibus drew up at last before the great white stone front of the
  Embassy. The three men alighted, and his two companions watched Stourton
  admitted. Then, raising their hats slightly, they turned away. Their errand
  was finished.</p>

  <p>Stourton breathed a sigh of relief as he stepped inside the hall.</p>

  <p>"Is Sir Charles better, Morton?" he asked the man who admitted him.</p>

  <p>"His Excellency is complaining of his head a good deal, Mr. Stourton," the
  man answered. "Monsieur Camillon sent for him about midnight, and has only
  just returned. You will find him in the study, sir. He gave orders that you
  were to go straight in immediately you arrived."</p>

  <p>Stourton did not hesitate for a moment.</p>

  <p>Already he was beginning to think of his bath and a whisky-and-soda. A few
  more such errands as this, and even his nerves would suffer. He crossed the
  hall at once and entered the study.</p>

  <p>The room was dimly lit, but a familiar figure rose at once from the
  couch.</p>

  <p>"At last, Stourton. Come here to my desk, and we'll have some more light.
  You have the despatches?"</p>

  <p>"You are better, Sir Charles?" Stourton asked, as he drew out his keys and
  laid the box before him.</p>

  <p>"Better, but abominably ill," the Ambassador answered wearily. "Everything
  here is in a ferment. Camillon has lost his head. There isn't a man in the
  Cabinet who can discuss the position of affairs calmly. What is it to be,
  Stourton?"</p>

  <p>"Peace, Sir Charles," Stourton answered. "The whole thing will fizzle out
  in a few days. As a matter of fact, I think even you will be surprised at the
  message you will have to carry to Camillon."</p>

  <p>"You have it there? Good! Ring the bell and order a carriage. I am nearly
  beside myself with pain, but Camillon is waiting."</p>

  <p>Stourton glanced at the clock. It was barely six. Sir Charles was
  certainly in a very queer way. His voice sounded hoarse and unnatural. His
  movements were the movements of a man racked with pain.</p>

  <p>"It will take me an hour, sir, to reset the cipher," Stourton said. "In
  case of urgency I have the gist of the whole matter in a verbal message.
  Would it not be well if you delivered that unofficially to Monsieur Camillon,
  and I would undertake to have the despatch copied for you by eight
  o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"It is a good idea," Sir Charles said wearily. " Give me your
  message."</p>

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"It is short enough," Stourton answered. "You are to assure Monsieur
  Camillon that England refuses absolutely to recognise China as a Power, and
  the fact of her alliance with Russia, although a source of regret to us, does
  not come within the scope of our obligations. We pledge ourselves not to move
  a single warship eastwards or to act in any way so as to disturb the present
  balance of power."</p>

  <p>"The news," Sir Charles said quietly, "is good. Be so kind, Stourton, as
  to ring the bell. I will be off at once."</p>

  <p>Stourton moved to the bell, and Sir Charles, drawing up the blind, for a
  moment looked down upon the street below. But though his fingers rested for a
  moment upon the knob, Stourton never pressed it. When Sir Charles turned
  round, he looked into the muzzle of a revolver.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad, Stourton?" the Ambassador asked, taking a quick step
  back.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," was the calm answer. "At any rate, I am taking no risks.
  If you move a step backwards or forwards, I shall fire!"</p>

  <p>Sir Charles became at once as motionless as a lay figure. Stourton leaned
  forward and switched on the electric light all round the room. Then he moved
  towards Sir Charles. He was beset by a horrible perplexity. He had either
  made a must ghastly blunder, or he was the victim of an extraordinary piece
  of necromancy.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the cipher exchange for March!" he asked with dry lips.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Your journey seems to have upset you, Mr. Stourton," he said calmly. "Be
  so good as to address me, if at all, with more respect."</p>

  <p>"The cipher exchange--for March," Stourton repeat«d doggedly.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles laughed shortly,</p>

  <p>"Do you imagine," he said, "that I am going to submit to a
  cross-examination from you? Have done with this folly, Mr. Stourton. Stand
  aside and let me pass!"</p>

  <p>"You do not go alive from this room," Stourton answered hoarsely,
  "until--until--"</p>

  <p>He leaned forward, and a sudden cry broke from his lips.</p>

  <p>"If you attempt to escape, I shall shoot you like a dog!" he cried. "You
  are not Sir Charles. You are a wonderful masquerader, I admit, but that is
  what you are--an impostor. Come, off with your mask! Who are you, and what do
  you expect to get by this? Remember, you are covered, and I shoot straight.
  What have you to say?"</p>

  <p>Sir Charles laughed--and at the sound the sweat broke out on Stourton's
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"You there I" he gasped. "Where is Sir Charles? If you try to escape, I'll
  kill you!"</p>

  <p>"Escape, my dear nephew-in-law?" was the smiling reply. "How is it
  possible? I am not armed, and I am not fond of firearms. Escape! Why should I
  think of such a thing? I am interested here--interested and even amused."</p>

  <p>Stourton was past taunts. To think that he had been outwitted after all
  was maddening, but his anxiety kept him cool.</p>

  <p>"Where is Sir Charles?"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless at Monsieur Camillon's," was the suave answer. "I believe that
  the first arrangement was that he should wait there for your coming.
  Unfortunately a violent attack of headache compelled Sir Charles--in my
  person--to return unexpectedly."</p>

  <p>"And what do you propose to do now?" Stourton asked grimly.</p>

  <p>Heslop Stanmore shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "I have no plans. I am in your hands. Lock me
  up if you will. Put me anywhere, so that, it is not necessary for you to
  stand with that diabolical little weapon pointed at my head."</p>

  <p>Stourton walked to the door, locked it, and put the key in his pocket.
  Then he sat down in an easy-chair and tried to think.</p>

  <p>All the time his eyes were fixed upon the pseudo-Ambassador.</p>

  <p>"By means of a trick, more or less ingenious, certainly lucky," he said
  thoughtfully, "you have obtained from me some very valuable information. The
  question which puzzles me is, how are you going to profit by it? That
  information will be placarded all over Paris by midday, and until midday you
  will certainly remain--my guest."</p>

  <p>Stanmore smiled.</p>

  <p>"I see your difficulty, my young friend," he remarked. "Let me help you,
  if I may. I had a use for your information, provided its tenor had been
  different. Five minutes earlier knowledge of war might have meant a good deal
  to me. The pacific intentions of your government are simply of no interest to
  me. Take my parole, dispose of me as you will. I simply am not interested. If
  it had been more fateful news--that which you have so kindly vouchsafed to
  me--it might have been worth my while to have risked something to have got
  away. As it is, you may treat me as a harmless lunatic."</p>

  <p>Stourton suddenly sprang up. He heard a familiar voice in the hall and a
  sound of footsteps. He unlocked the door, and almost immediately it was
  thrown open. Sir Charles entered. He addressed Stourton sharply.</p>

  <p>"What infernal muddle is this?" he exclaimed. "Surely my instructions were
  clear enough? I have been waiting for you at Monsieur Camillon's."</p>

  <p>"The explanation, sir, is there," Stourton answered, pointing to the
  further end of the room.</p>

  <p>The Ambassador and the pseudo-Ambassador were face to face. Sir Charles
  gazed at his double in horrified silence. The latter, with a gently
  deprecating smile, appeared to be making a deliberate examination of the
  details of Sir Charles's dress and person.</p>

  <p>"Heavens, sir! who are you?" Sir Charles exclaimed at last.</p>

  <p>Stanmore waved his hand towards Stourton.</p>

  <p>"This young gentleman will explain," he said suavely. "Forgive my close
  observation; I am always interested in these little studies of mine. I
  perceive that I have libelled you in one or two small details. The height and
  presence I could not hope to gain--I was obliged to remain seated; but it
  vexes me extremely that I should have parted my hair at least an inch too
  much to the left. Nevertheless, Sir Charles, I trust that you will not
  consider me altogether a caricature."</p>

  <p><a id="pic2AM3"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Sir Charles had regained his composure. He eyed him up and down
  grimly.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, sir," he said, " I congratulate you. The resemblance is
  at any rate close enough to warrant your acquaintance with a French prison.
  Now, Stourton."</p>

  <p>Stourton explained rapidly. An immense relief came into the Ambassador's
  face as he delivered his message.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven!" he exclaimed fervently. "I will go at once to Monsieur
  Camillon's, and take this effigy with me. No, I can't do that. We mustn't
  give ourselves a way. Keep him under lock and key, Stourton, till the news is
  on the boulevards, and then kick him out. Work out your draft despatch and
  send Blount round with it. He will be here in half an hour."</p>

  <p>Sir Charles hurried away. Stourton took his troublesome connection up to
  his own quarters, made him relinquish his wig and moustache, and brought him
  back to the study. He established himself in an easy-chair with a little sigh
  of relief.</p>

  <p>"If one might venture to suggest a cup of coffee--" he remarked; "and--Sir
  Charles does not smoke. I do. I have been suffering for the last two
  hours."</p>

  <p>Stourton ordered the coffee and threw him his cigarette-case. He made
  himself quite at home. When he had finished his work, Stourton rose and faced
  him sternly. Already the din on the boulevards had commenced.</p>

  <p>"Stanmore," he said, "this is the second time you have tried to ruin me.
  Now it is my turn. What is to prevent my handing you over to the police? You
  are here under false pretences. In the eyes of the law you are a
  burglar."</p>

  <p>Stanmore shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said quietly, "you know very well that you cannot do
  it. You dare not admit that you were--pardon me--so easily deceived. Your
  Embassy would be the laughing-stock of your fellow-diplomats. Besides, the
  French police know me. They would examine the charge with perfect
  gravity--and release me!"</p>

  <p>"If I let you go," Stourton said, "will you give me your word of honour to
  leave me alone in future? Try your tricks on someone else, if you will. I've
  had my share. I am fond of the Service, and I have had two narrow
  escapes--through you. Give me your word of honour that this shall be your
  last escapade where I am concerned, and you can go."</p>

  <p>Stanmore shook his head gravely.</p>

  <p>"My dear Stourton," he said, "believe me, in your own interests, I cannot
  do this. You are, I am pleased to say, a connection of mine, and I am very
  much interested in your career. The two--er--incidents to which you have
  referred have brightened you up amazingly. You have no idea how much you have
  improved already. If I were to give you that promise, you would relax your
  vigilance at once. No, no! It is much better as it is. Always be on your
  guard against me. I may turn up at any moment."</p>

  <p>Stourton opened the door in silence. His uncle-in-law walked out.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Sir Charles asked Stourton to lunch with him next day. The Ambassador was
  in the nervous state of a man just recovering from an immense strain, and in
  the midst of a shower of congratulations there was one point on which he was
  particularly irritable. He alluded to it as soon as they were alone.</p>

  <p>"I don't like these stories of enormous buying of English Consols and
  French <i>Rentes</i> just an hour before Camillon issued the news," he said.
  "They say that it was one man on both markets. They watch that sort of thing
  at Downing Street. I only hope they don't suspect a leakage."</p>

  <p>Stourton answered Sir Charles's unspoken thought.</p>

  <p>"I did not let him go," he said, "till the news was on the
  boulevards."</p>

  <p>Sir Charles grunted and dismissed the subject. But it came into Stourton's
  mind again when at breakfast-time one morning, about a fortnight later,
  Esther, with a cry of delight, opened a large morocco case.</p>

  <p>"Ronald! Did you ever see anything so beautiful?" she exclaimed
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>Stourton was reading the note.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">My dear Niece--and Nephew-in-law--</p>

  <p class="letter">I have always felt that my wedding present was a most
  inadequate offering, and I hope that you will allow me, now that Fortune has
  been more kind, to make atonement. I do not often speculate, but I am
  thankful to say that my last venture was crowned with complete success.</p>

  <p class="letter">My best regards to your husband. I envy his luxurious
  quarters at the Place Diplomatique. The view from Sir Charles's library down
  the Boulevard St. Antoine especially commends itself to me.</p>

  <p class="letter">Believe me, my dear<br>
  Ever your affectionate Uncle.</p><br>

  <p>Esther looked over her husband's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"What does he mean, Ronald?" she asked, perplexed.</p>

  <p>Stourton threw the note into the flames.</p>

    She gave a little start, and looked doubtfully at the tall, dripping
    figure.</li>

    <li><a href="#picJG2">Illustration 2.</a><br>
    "Why," she gasped, "you are John Garland&mdash;John who ran away from
    home!"</li>

    <li><a href="#picJG3">Illustration 3.</a><br>
    Sewell flung himself out of the room...</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <p class="first">A DOZEN lanterns showed him the sea-stained, rotting steps.
  A chorus of hoarse, cheerful voices bade him welcome. A score of willing
  hands dragged him through a cloud of spray on to the wave-swept, creaking
  jetty. Then, as he stood for a moment to regain his breath, from somewhere
  behind in that thick, black gulf through which he had journeyed came the
  sound of a dull grinding, the crashing of timbers, the hideous, far-off
  shrieking of human voices. A rocket went hissing up into the darkness,
  piercing with a momentary splendour the black veil.</p>

  <p>"By Heaven, she's broken in two!" a voice cried. "She's gone!"</p>

  <p>The rescued man turned sharply round. The light of the rocket was waning,
  yet he was just in time to see the slow heeling over of the huge,
  indistinguishable mass which a few hours ago had been a splendid liner.</p>

  <p>"You're the last one saved," someone muttered at his elbow. "The boat's
  going back, but it will be too late. God help the others!" The rescued man
  nodded solemnly.</p>

  <p>"There are less than half-a-dozen left," he said, "and they had their
  chance. It was a big jump into the boats," he added. "Queer little
  cockle-shells they looked, too, from the deck. I've stood there for the last
  two hours, worrying the people in. I've thrown over a dozen, who dared not
  jump."</p>

  <p>A clergyman pushed his way through the group. He was drenched to the skin,
  bare-headed, and breathless. He carried an old-fashioned lantern in his left
  hand. His right he extended to the dripping man, who stood there looking like
  a giant amongst them.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of you, sir!" he exclaimed. "You're John Waters, I'm sure. You
  did a man's work there. There's a mother up at the vicarage now, with her two
  children saved, sobbing over them and blessing you. You rigged up a windlass,
  they tell me, and let them down. I only wish that I had room at my house for
  you, sir, but the whole village is packed."</p>

  <p>"You're very good," the man answered. "I'm used to roughing it, and any
  place'll do for me. Somewhere near a fire, for choice; your salt water's
  chilly."</p>

  <p>The clergyman raised his lantern and looked anxiously round the little
  circle of faces.</p>

  <p>"We're seventy souls in the village," he said; "it's nothing but a hamlet,
  and we've found beds for over two hundred. We'll fix you up directly. I've
  one or two names left yet upon my list."</p>

  <p>A slim woman's figure came battling her way along the jetty. She heard the
  clergyman's last words, and laid her fingers upon his arm. He turned sharply
  round. There were not many women about that night, and this one seemed frail
  and small to battle her way alone in the storm.</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Cressley!" he exclaimed. "How ever did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't rest at home," was the quiet answer. "It was too terrible. And
  I had no one to send. I want to be of use. Can't I take someone in&mdash;a
  woman, or some children? I have a spare room and a fire lit ready."</p>

  <p>The clergyman gave a little exclamation of relief.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," he declared, "you are just in time. Here's our last man,
  and I was at my wits' end to know what to do with him. A hero!" he whispered
  in her ear. "He has saved no end of lives there. Bless you for coming, my
  dear, brave Miss Cressley," he added. "It's just like you&mdash;just the sort
  of thing you would do."</p>

  <p>She gave a little start, and looked doubtfully at the tall, dripping
  figure. In his soaked clothes, his long brown beard, and his hair tossed
  wildly all over his face, he presented a somewhat singular appearance.</p>

  <p><a id="picJG1"

  </div>

  <p>"My dear madam," he said, in his deep bass voice, "don't please refuse me
  because I am not a woman or a child. I'll give you less trouble than either,
  I promise you. I won't smoke or swear. I'll do whatever I am told, if I can
  only see something to eat, a bed, and a fire."</p>

  <p>She held on to the railing of the jetty with both hands. Her voice sounded
  thin and quavery against the background of the storm.</p>

  <p>"I shall be very glad to take you, and to do what I can," she said, a
  little doubtfully. "I mentioned a woman or child because I know more about
  them and their needs, and because I live alone. Will you come this way,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>He turned and followed her, waving his hand in answer to a chorus of "Good
  nights." They passed down the sea-soaked jetty between a little line of
  curious, sympathetic faces, and reached the village. She led the way up the
  steep street, and looked into his face a little timidly.</p>

  <p>"My cottage is close here, sir," she said. "It will only take us a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>A gust of wind almost swept her off her feet. He put out a great
  protecting hand and steadied her.</p>

  <p>"One moment," he said. "Let me help you. So!"</p>

  <p>He turned for a last gaze seaward. There was no sign of light or life upon
  the black chaos of waters&mdash;nothing save the clouds of white foam, flung
  up almost into their faces, and the sullen roar of the breaking waves.</p>

  <p>"God help the rest of them!" he said, with a sudden note of reverence in
  his tone. Then he turned to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said, "I am ready."</p>

  <p>Together they climbed to the summit of the hill. She gently disengaged her
  arm from his.</p>

  <p>"I am so much stronger than I look," she declared, apologetically.
  "Really, I can manage quite well alone. My cottage is last upon the left. You
  can see the light. We shall be there in a moment."</p>

  <p>He walked by her side in silence. She wondered, with a sudden
  perturbation, whether he were offended. His face was invisible; she could not
  tell that he was laughing softly to himself. Perhaps he was mistaken in her
  years. He had taken her for sixty, at least.</p>

  <p>They reached a little wooden gate, over which he calmly stepped while she
  fumbled with the latch, passed up a trim garden path, and into the tiny hall
  of the tiniest cottage he had ever seen. Despite her warning, he bumped his
  head upon the ceiling. She turned up the lamp, and he looked around him a
  little ruefully. His size made the place appear like a doll's house.</p>

  <p>"If you will step upstairs," she said, bravely disregarding his dripping
  state, "I will show you your room."</p>

  <p>He looked at the stairs, with their neat carpet and shining brass rods,
  and he looked down at himself.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "haven't you a back kitchen where I can strip and
  have a rub down? You'll have to lend me a blanket while my clothes dry. Good
  Lord!"</p>

  <p>He was looking at her in blank surprise.</p>

  <p>"Is anything&mdash;the matter?" she asked, frightened.</p>

  <p>He burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"Nothing!" he answered. "Only I thought that you were a little old
  lady."</p>

  <p>She blushed desperately, and thrust back the curly waves of fair hair
  which had escaped in the wind. She was certainly not more than thirty or
  thirty-five, slim, with nice features and grey eyes, colourless, perhaps a
  little unnoticeable.</p>

  <p>The laugh died away. He stood and looked at her as she turned to ascend
  the stairs, as one might look at a ghost.</p>

  <p>"There are some clothes here which belonged to my father," she said. "Will
  you go to the room on the left? It is the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"It is the little Cressley girl, of course," he said to himself, as he
  stood on the red tiles and reached out towards the fire. "Little Mary
  Cressley! Shy little baby she used to be."</p>

  <p>Suddenly the smile spread once more over his face.</p>

  <p>"Great Scot! I kissed her once!" he muttered. "Good thing she doesn't
  recognize me!"</p>

  <p>She came back in a few moments with a bottle and an armful of clothes. He
  decided that she had been practicing a severe expression in the glass, but
  she avoided meeting his eyes.</p>

  <p>"My father was a minister," she said, "and he was not quite so large as
  you; but you must please do the best you can with these clothes. There is a
  bottle of brandy here, and some hot water in the kettle there. When you have
  changed your clothes, if you call out, I will come and get supper ready."</p>

  <p>He looked at the clothes, clerical and severe in cut, with a grin. She
  turned her back upon him and went out. He helped himself to the brandy and
  hot water, and then commenced to strip off his things. All the time he
  laughed to himself softly. He remembered the Rev. Hiram Cressley well, and
  the idea of wearing his garments appealed to his sense of humour.</p>

  <p>He called out to her as soon as he was ready. She kept her face averted
  when she entered, but he could have sworn that he saw the corners of her
  mouth twitch.</p>

  <p>"If you would step into the sitting-room," she said, "I will prepare
  supper."</p>

  <p>He shuddered at the thought of the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"I'm such a clumsy fellow," he said. "I shall break half your pretty
  things. Couldn't we have supper in here?"</p>

  <p>"Just as you like," she said, struggling to hide her relief.</p>

  <p>He dragged the table into the middle of the room.</p>

  <p>"Come on," he said; "I'm going to help."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>In the night the wind died away, and the storm passed down the Channel,
  leaving behind a piteous trail of disasters, small and large. John Garland
  opened his window, and looked out with a little exclamation of amazement. The
  sky was a soft deep blue; the sunshine lay everywhere upon the picturesque
  village, with its red roofs and grey cottages, its background of hills and
  rolling moors. From the little garden below, all ablaze with colour, came
  sweet rushes of perfume&mdash;of lavender, of rose and pinks, all dashed and
  drooping with their burden of raindrops, glittering like diamonds in the
  sunshine. Garland drank it all in with delight.</p>

  <p>"England at last!" he murmured, as he began to prepare for his ablutions.
  "Lord, what a doll's house this is! I feel as though I were going through the
  floor."</p>

  <p>He dressed rapidly and hurried into the garden. Miss Cressley was there,
  busy tying up some of her dashed flowers. She started a little at his hearty
  greeting, and avoided his eyes. All night long her conscience had been
  troubling her. The memory of that supper was like a delightful scourge. She
  had been much too friendly. She had quite forgotten the impropriety of the
  whole thing, and had laughed and talked almost like a girl again. With the
  morning reflection had come&mdash;reflection like a cold douche. And with it
  other things! The perfume of the flowers, the soft west wind, the aftermath,
  perhaps, of the joyous evening, were creeping into her blood. Had she done
  anything so desperately wrong after all? It was the vicar himself who had
  sent this man to her. As she well knew, every cottage in the village was
  full. Still, her cheeks went furiously red at the sound of his voice.</p>

  <p>"Why!" he exclaimed, "forgive me! Good morning!"</p>

  <p>"You look different, somehow," he explained. "Forgive my noticing it. I've
  been so long in a world where manners don't count, that I've forgotten
  mine."</p>

  <p>Her cheeks burned. She could not remain unconscious of what he meant. She
  had arranged her hair differently&mdash;she was tired of the old
  way&mdash;and her white dress was certainly her most becoming one. The
  cluster of lilac, too, which she had drawn through her waistband&mdash;it was
  so seldom that it pleased her to wear flowers!</p>

  <p>"Won't you come in to breakfast?" she said, shyly.</p>

  <p>"Breakfast! Hurrah!" he answered. "I'm afraid I'm eating you out of house
  and home, Miss Cressley."</p>

  <p>She led the way into the sitting room, which seemed to him more than ever
  like a chamber in a doll's house. He sat very gingerly upon his chair, and
  was afraid even to move his legs. The moment the meal was over he escaped
  into the garden and produced a pipe.</p>

  <p>"I'm off to the village," he announced, "to see some of the people. Won't
  you come?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she answered, "I have things to do in the house."</p>

  <p>"I'll do the marketing," he announced. "I'll send some things up for
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"It is not in the least necessary," she declared, with her chin in the
  air.</p>

  <p>He laughed in her face.</p>

  <p>"Necessary or not," he declared, "either I do the marketing or I dine at
  the inn."</p>

  <p>He was an impossible person to argue with&mdash;so big and strong and
  forceful. The things he said seemed somehow right because he said them. She
  gave in, and the magnitude of his purchases amazed her. He brought them up
  himself, wearing a ready-made suit of fisherman's clothes, and carrying the
  clerical garments in which he had started the day in a parcel under his arm.
  He took not the slightest notice of her protests, and he spent the next hour
  between the kitchen and the garden, strolling with his hands in his pockets
  and an air of being absolutely at home.</p>

  <p>Three days passed&mdash;four. As yet he had not even alluded to his
  possible departure. At first she had wondered, had been gently troubled as to
  what the villagers might be saying about her entertainment of this
  good-humoured, easy-going giant. Gradually the place was being emptied of its
  unusual crowds. Surely, she thought, he must speak soon of his departure!
  And, with a sudden start of mingled shame and alarm, she realized that she
  dreaded the very thought of his absence.</p>

  <p>She fled into her room and locked the door. With blurred eyes and beating
  heart she looked out seawards and fought against this folly&mdash;this folly
  which seemed to her so egregious, so unmaidenly. For ten years&mdash;ever
  since her father's death&mdash;she had lived there alone a life of prim and
  delicate orderliness, quietly useful to many people&mdash;a life, it seemed
  to her now, colourless, flat, impossible. She looked in the glass. Yes, she
  was a young woman still! Her cheeks were still pink, her eyes bright, her
  hair soft and full. With trembling fingers she took it down, rearranged it
  more after the fashion of her youthful days, and pinned a ribbon around her
  throat&mdash;ribbon of the colour which matched her eyes. After all, she was
  a woman. She had not sought this thing&mdash;it had come unbidden, undesired,
  she told herself, breathlessly. She had a right to do what she was doing.
  Nevertheless, her cheeks were hot with shame when she saw him again.</p>

  <p>He was standing in the garden, reading a telegram, with a frown upon his
  face. She went out to him shyly, and he looked at her for a moment in
  amazement&mdash;as one might look at a ghost.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why, what have you done to yourself?" he exclaimed. "You grow
  younger every day! If only I could do the same," he continued, with a twinkle
  in his eyes, "you might remember the farmer's son as well as I remember the
  minister's daughter!"</p>

  <p>She stared. Then a wave of recollection came to her. There had always
  seemed something familiar about his tone and manner.</p>

  <p>"Why," she gasped, "you are John Garland&mdash;John who ran away from
  home!"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I kissed you once, Mary," he said, "up the lane there."</p>

  <p>She blushed furiously.</p>

  <p>"I do not remember it," she said, menda­ciously&mdash;a statement which
  was scarcely likely to be true, considering that it was the only embrace to
  which she had ever submitted.</p>

  <p>"I'd like&mdash;" he began, and stopped. She was stooping over her
  roses.</p>

  <p>"You have been away a long time," she said, softly.</p>

  <p>"A long time," he repeated. "Everyone seems to be dead and gone. I am
  afraid I shall find the old country a lonely place."</p>

  <p>"Luncheon is ready," she said. "Shall we go in?"</p>

  <p>Afterwards he produced the telegram.</p>

  <p>"This afternoon," he said, calmly, "I must go."</p>

  <p>She caught at her breath. She could not keep the frightened look from her
  eyes, but she was able to control her tone.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it a little sudden," she asked.</p>

  <p>He nodded gloomily.</p>

  <p>"I'm a man of affairs now," he said, "and I'm wanted."</p>

  <p>She saw him off. She scarcely heard his farewell words. Every faculty she
  possessed was devoted to the desperate effort of preserving her secret. She
  saw him go, felt the touch of his fingers, heard the sound of his kindly
  voice, and turned away a little abruptly, just in time to hide the blinding
  tears. Then she walked back to her cottage, seeing no one, walking like one
  stumbling through a dream. It was very quiet, very peaceful, there. The smell
  of tobacco still lingered about her tiny hall. There was nothing else. Her
  knees shook as she fled up the stairs to her room.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Tragedy that year came not only from the sea, but from the land, to the
  little village of Pargeth. Dinneford's bank failed in the neighboring town,
  and half the village lost their savings. Mary Cressley lost more. She lost
  everything. When the winter came, and the worst was known, she found herself
  face to face with ruin.</p>

  <p>She went to her landlord, a red-faced sporting solicitor of bibulous
  habits. She had known him all her life, and hated him. He had been expecting
  her visit, and received her a little grimly in his bare, untidy office.</p>

  <p>He interrupted her timid explanations.</p>

  <p>"I know all about it, Mary Cressley," he said. "Your money is
  lost&mdash;Dinneford's will never pay a farthing&mdash;and you can't pay your
  rent, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Not just yet," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Not just yet or ever," he interrupted. "How should you pay it? You've got
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"I was going to ask you to wait for a little time, and I would try and get
  some lodgers," she said.</p>

  <p>He laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"You'd get no one before the summer," he said; "and how do you suppose
  you're going to live and pay your rent out of boarders?"</p>

  <p>"I can't think of anything else," she said, desperately.</p>

  <p>"I can," he answered. "You must do what you'd have done years ago if you'd
  been a sensible woman&mdash;marry me!"</p>

  <p>She rose at once to her feet.</p>

  <p>"That," she declared, "is impossible."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" he answered. "Well, then, it's also impossible for me to wait for
  my rent. I'll give you a week."</p>

  <p>She went away without a word. For three days she hesitated. Then she sat
  down and wrote to John Garland. He had spoken truthfully when he said that he
  had become a man of affairs. His name was everywhere in the papers
  lately&mdash;the new Colonial millionaire, the owner of gold-mines and
  townships. Pargeth, it seemed, had entertained a Prince in disguise.</p>

  <p>She wrote the letter, and as soon as she had finished it she tore it up.
  Her head was buried in her arms.</p>

  <p>"I can't!" she moaned. "I can't!"</p>

  <p>Then legal documents came to terrify her. A man made an inventory of all
  she possessed&mdash;a man who handled her precious pieces of china as though
  they had been jam-pots, and even counted her household linen. The terror came
  again! She thought of the workhouse&mdash;the cold, grey building on the
  hillside&mdash;its bare rooms, the long-drawn-out days of agony. Again she
  wrote to John Garland. This time she would have posted the letter, but Fate
  sent in her way a newspaper. She learned that he had purchased a great county
  estate, and announced his intention of marrying. The name of the lady was
  mentioned&mdash;the daughter of a poverty-stricken peer, a reigning beauty
  for several seasons.</p>

  <p>Mary tore up her letter and went down to look at the sea. If only she had
  the courage!</p>

  <p>Her landlord, Peter Sewell, came once more&mdash;the night before the
  sale. He was flushed, and he smelt of drink. He talked in a loud voice, and
  he had a good deal to say about her folly. In the end she turned him out of
  the house. It was her last luxury, and she enjoyed it.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>There were barely a score of people at the sale. Amongst them was the
  vicar, flushed and anxious, with a little list in his hand which he kept
  consulting. When the auctioneer mounted his chair the vicar for a moment
  intervened.</p>

  <p>"May I," he said, turning to face the few people, "say just one word? You
  all know the painful circumstances under which this sale has become
  necessary. You all know very well our dear friend, Miss Mary Cressley. A few
  of us have subscribed to buy her furniture, and thus keep a home for her
  amongst us until the spring. Pargeth, unfortunately, is not a rich place, and
  the sum which we have been able to collect is, after all, very small. But I
  should like you all to know that when I bid, I bid for those who wish to
  return to this dear lady her few household goods."</p>

  <p>There was a sympathetic murmur from the bystanders, a nod of approval from
  the auctioneer, and a growl from Sewell. A red-faced lady, who kept the inn,
  turned indignantly towards him.</p>

  <p>"What I say is, let the poor lady keep her bits and bobs of furniture!"
  she exclaimed. "Who'd be the better off for them, I should like to know? And
  what's a matter of a bit of rent behind, eh? Hasn't she lived here
  respectable, and paid her way, all her life? Shame on them as is pressing her
  like this, I say."</p>

  <p>Sewell turned upon them all a little fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "there's been enough of this sentimental rot. This
  is a business meeting. Get on with the sale, Cobb. If any of you think you're
  going to indulge in a little cheap charity, you're wrong. I'm here to buy
  myself. Now then, Cobb."</p>

  <p>The sale proceeded. The vicar bid timidly for the first few lots. Sewell
  scornfully outbid him and secured them. Then there was a commotion outside. A
  great motor-car had swung up to the door. A man, head and shoulders taller
  than most of them, pushed his way in.</p>

  <p>"What the devil's the meaning of this?" he exclaimed, looking around.</p>

  <p>The vicar recognized the new-comer and scented a friend. He ignored the
  expletive. In a few words he made the situation clear.</p>

  <p>"Right!" John Garland said, leaning his back against the wall. "You can
  leave the bidding to me, vicar. I'll take a hand in this."</p>

  <p>Sewell glared across the room.</p>

  <p>"Cobb," he said, turning to the auctioneer, "remember this is a cash
  affair. You can't take bids from strangers without the money." John Garland
  laughed dryly, though there was little sign of humour in his face.</p>

  <p>"My name is John Garland," he said. "I've a thousand pounds in my pocket,
  a few hundred thousands in the bank, and a few million behind that. Like to
  examine these notes, Mr. Auctioneer?" he added, holding a packet out to
  him.</p>

  <p>The auctioneer waved them away.</p>

  <p>"Quite satisfactory, Mr. Garland," he said.</p>

  <p>"Go on with the sale," Sewell shouted. "Confound you! I'll make you pay
  for your interference!"</p>

  <p>No one else thought of bidding. Without turning a hair John Garland paid
  twenty pounds for a tea-pot and seventeen for a china ornament. Then came the
  piano. Sewell started it with an evil smile.</p>

  <p>"Ten pounds!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Absurd!" Garland murmured. "Twenty!"</p>

  <p>"Thirty!" Sewell replied.</p>

  <p>"Fifty!" Garland bid.</p>

  <p>The room became breathlessly still. These were sums which belonged to
  fairyland. The last bid was Sewell's&mdash;one hundred and forty pounds.
  Garland paused for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Is that Mr. Sewell's bid?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the auctioneer answered, waiting.</p>

  <p>Garland leaned over and struck a few notes upon the piano&mdash;a
  miserable, worn-out affair, barely worth the amount of the first bid. He
  shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe Miss Cressley cares about this piano much," he said.
  "Half the notes seem to be gone, too. I think I'll let Mr. Sewell have
  it."</p>

  <p>There was an instant's breathless silence&mdash;then an angry exclamation
  from Sewell, drowned in a roar of laughter from the company. The auctioneer's
  hammer descended.</p>

  <p>"It's a rascally swindle!" Sewell roared. "I sha'n't pay for it. Put it up
  again."</p>

  <p>John Garland smiled.</p>

  <p>"I certainly didn't pledge my word to buy everything," he said. "I dare
  say there'll be pickings for you, Mr. Sewell."</p>

  <p>Sewell flung himself out of the room, and the sale was over in half an
  hour. The vicar wrung John Garland's hand.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"God bless you, sir!" he said. "You couldn't find a better use for your
  money than this, I promise you. She's the sweetest, most unselfish little
  lady that ever breathed."</p>

  <p>"Glad to hear you say so, sir," Garland answered. "I'm going to marry her
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>The vicar looked amazed.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Garland!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Quite correct," Garland continued. "I've a special licence here. I
  suppose you can arrange it some time to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>The vicar took the document into his fingers.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow is Christmas Eve," he said, "and they'll be busy decorating all
  day. But I dare say we can manage it," he added, with a smile. "By the by, is
  it a secret?"</p>

  <p>"You can tell anyone you like," John Garland answered, "except Miss
  Cressley, in case you should see her first."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't she know?" the vicar gasped.</p>

  <p>"Not yet!" John Garland answered.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Late in the evening Mary Cressley came stealing back from the farm on the
  moors where she had spent most of the day. A fine snow was falling, and a
  cold wind blew through her thin clothes. She remembered that there would be
  no furniture nor any fire in her stripped home, and a sob came into her
  throat. Perhaps they would have left a rug or something&mdash;her clothes she
  was not sure about. Tears dimmed her eyes as she made her way down the little
  lane. It was her last home-coming.</p>

  <p>Below were the lights of the village&mdash;cheerful enough&mdash;the
  ringers were practising a Christmas peal, the sound of the bells came with
  extraordinary distinctness through the clear air. Then she turned the corner
  and gave a little start of surprise. There were lights in her own cottage.
  Some neighbors must be there!</p>

  <p>She walked more slowly. When she reached the gate she peered in, and her
  heart almost stopped beating. The furniture was all there! Nothing had been
  taken away!</p>

  <p>She began to tremble. She scarcely knew how she pushed open the door. From
  the kitchen came a pleasant smell of cooking&mdash;the parlour door was open.
  She peered in. A great figure rose from his knees.</p>

  <p>"It's this infernal grate again," said a familiar voice. "I can't make the
  thing go. Never mind. Supper's ready in the kitchen."</p>

  <p>She swayed upon her feet.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Garland!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"May as well call me John," he answered, "as we're going to be married
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>She fell into his arms. Her hat was crushed, and the little fair curls
  came tumbling out over her ears. He took the pale face in her strong hands,
  and kissed her upon the lips.</p>

  <p>"Mary, you little fool," he said, "why didn't you send for me?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," she murmured, weakly. "I thought you were going to be
  married."</p>

  <p>"So I am, to you, to-morrow," he answered. "I've fixed it up with the
  vicar. Come in to supper and I'll tell you all about it."</p>

  <p>He led her out of the room, his arm around her waist. She forgot that she
  had ever been wet and cold and lonely. For a moment she believed that she had
  died upon the moor and been taken up into heaven. And then he kissed her once
  more upon the lips, and she knew that she was on earth!</p>

  <p class="first">THE MAN who was lurking in the shadows, close to the heavy
  curtains which shielded the windows, glanced impatiently at the clock for the
  third time. It seemed impossible that time could move so slowly. It was
  barely five minutes since he had clambered in through the window and hidden
  himself in the silent room. Five minutes! Surely an eternity!</p>

  <p>He had none of the coolness of the practised criminal. He was forty-seven
  years old, and for the first time in his life he was prepared to lift his
  hand against his country's laws. No wonder that his lips were dry and his
  breath came in a little short. It was no small thing, this, which he had in
  his mind. A man's life lay at the end of it.</p>

  <p>The room was large, and handsomely furnished. Save for the somewhat
  conspicuous absence of books, it was the typical library of an English
  suburban residence. There were handsome prints upon the wall, little
  statuettes--not ill-chose--upon the mantelpiece, a soft, rich carpet, and
  several pieces of heavy, solid furniture. In a corner of the room stood a
  writing-table of dark walnut wood. There were papers there--laid out as
  though in readiness, a green-shaded lamp, the photograph of a woman, a bowl
  of roses.</p>

  <p>The man who waited felt himself grow harder and colder as the moments went
  by. So this was where he sat, then, this enemy of his! In this room,
  probably, that his own ruin had been worked. John Wilkinson felt in his
  pocket, and his finger closed upon the butt of his revolver. There was no
  pity in his heart for the man whom he had come to kill. There was nothing but
  an intense desire to get the thing over--to meet him face to face, to say
  those few words, and to shoot! Others might call it murder. He knew very well
  that it was but an act of common justice.</p>

  <p>The clock ticked, and a corner of the burning log fell on to the open
  fireplace. Then at last came a sound from beyond. A door somewhere in the
  house was opened and closed. Footsteps were coming along the passage. The
  man's whole frame stiffened. He stole out from his hiding-place and stood
  waiting.</p>

  <p>It was a woman who entered, a woman tall and fair, dressed for the
  evening, with jewels upon her throat and bosom, only partially concealed by
  the open cloak of white lace which she wore. The man would have stolen back
  to his hiding-place, but it was too late. The woman saw him, and stopped
  short. She looked at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she asked. "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"A few words with your husband," the man answered.</p>

  <p>"With my husband?" the woman repeated. "But he told me that he was
  expecting no one except his secretary to-night. Does he know that you are
  here?"</p>

  <p>"No!" the man answered.</p>

  <p>She turned up the lamp and looked at him more closely. He was tall and
  thin, and, although his face was not the face of a criminal, there was
  something in his expression and the nervous tenseness of his answers which
  alarmed her. She moved swiftly towards the bell, only to find her arm grasped
  by his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said, "you must not ring that bell. I have a few words to say
  to your husband. If he knew that I were here he would not see me. I cannot
  allow you to interfere."</p>

  <p>The woman stood for a moment looking at him, and the fear in her heart
  grew.</p>

  <p>"How did you get in?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Through the window," he answered, grimly.</p>

  <p>She opened her lips, but his hand swiftly closed them.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said, "I am not going to allow you to ring the bell. If you
  call out, you know very well what will happen. Your husband is in the
  adjoining room, and he will be the first to rush in. The moment he crosses
  the threshold I shall shoot him through the heart. Understand that. If you
  call out, you bring him to his death."</p>

  <p>He released her. She stood looking at him with white, scared face, but his
  words had had their effect. She made no further attempt to raise an
  alarm.</p>

  <p>"Sit down in that chair," he said, "and be quiet. I am sorry you came, but
  since you are here I cannot afford to let you go." She recovered a little of
  her courage. After all, the man's face was not an evil one.</p>

  <p>"What do you want with my husband?" she asked. "What are you going to
  do?"</p>

  <p>The man laughed--a little nervous, dry laugh.</p>

  <p>"An act of justice," he answered. "It's rough luck on you that you should
  be here, especially as he is your husband. You'd better go over to the window
  when you hear him coming."</p>

  <p>Once more the horror seized her. She read the purpose in his face.</p>

  <p>"You have come here to commit murder?" she cried.</p>

  <p>The man smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I have come to kill your husband, madam," he said, "if that can be
  counted as murder."</p>

  <p><a id="picMS1"

  <p>She shrank away from him.</p>

  <p>"You are mad," she faltered. "You know what happens to murderers. You will
  be hung!"</p>

  <p>"I think not," he answered, indifferently. "I have friends below waiting
  to help me, and I shall try to escape. If I fail, I shall shoot myself. As
  well that as a beggar! Listen!"</p>

  <p>He leaned forward towards the door. The woman, too, strained her ears. At
  the moment she would have screamed, but her voice seemed paralyzed. The man's
  eyes were upon her. She opened her lips, but no sound came.</p>

  <p>"A false alarm!" he remarked, coolly. "Never mind. He cannot be much
  longer."</p>

  <p>"Tell me why you want to kill him?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Because he is Philip Angus, millionaire, and I am John Wilkinson,
  beggar," the man answered, bitterly.</p>

  <p>The woman's courage seemed to be returning. Her eyes flashed; she drew
  herself a little more erect.</p>

  <p>"You coward!" she exclaimed. "Because my husband has been fortunate, where
  you have been unfortunate, you would steal in here like a thief, and kill him
  without a moment's warning! You shall not do it. I will throw myself in the
  way. You shall kill me, if you want a victim."</p>

  <p>The man listened as one might listen to a child.</p>

  <p>"If you have a life to throw away, madam," he said, "pray risk it if you
  will, but you will not save your husband. My revolver has six chambers, and
  it is very carefully loaded."</p>

  <p>Once more the courage left her. She listened frantically for the footfall
  outside that she knew so well. He could not be more than a few minutes now!
  There seemed to be no sound whatever in the house, no sound to break the
  stillness but the ticking of the little clock which stood upon the table. A
  wild thought came to her.</p>

  <p>"You want money!" she exclaimed. "Of course it is money that you want! You
  shall have it. Take my jewels. They are very valuable--very valuable indeed.
  They will make you rich."</p>

  <p>Her hands were at her throat, but he stopped her with a gesture of
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"You do me an injustice," he declared, coldly. "It is not money that I
  want, or your jewels. I want your husband's life. Let me tell you this--it is
  a terrible thing to say, it is a shameful thing for you to hear, but it is
  the truth. There are hundreds of men and women who, when they read to-morrow
  morning that Philip Angus is dead, will breathe the more freely."</p>

  <p>"It is not true!" she muttered.</p>

  <p>His face darkened.</p>

  <p>"Madam, it is the God's truth!" he said, with a sudden note of fierceness
  in his tone. "Your husband is one of those who have made the name of a
  millionaire infamous. He has made a great fortune. Do you know how? I will
  tell you. He has built it up by lies, by deceit, by treachery. He hasn't even
  been faithful to his friends. He has filled his pockets with the savings of
  the working people whom he has ruined."</p>

  <p>A shadow of indignation passed across the white, terrified face of the
  woman to whom he spoke.</p>

  <p>"It is not true!" she declared. "It is not true!"</p>

  <p>The long, lean figure of the man seemed suddenly to expand. His eyes
  blazed. He reminded her for the moment of some Biblical character--some
  prophet, whose words were charged with woe.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he cried, softly, "it is God's truth! Do you need to be told what
  your husband's reputation is? Are there no newspapers? Isn't it in the air
  wherever you go? Can you look me in the eyes and pretend to be ignorant of
  it? There isn't a jewel on your body that's honestly earned. Oh, I daren't
  think of it, or I know that I should kill you, too, where you stand, for the
  things you represent!"</p>

  <p>Once more the woman looked toward the door. His coming was long delayed.
  Was it a good or evil omen, this? "Shoot me, then!" she muttered. "I am not
  afraid."</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said. "I have no quarrel with you. It is your husband whom I am
  going to save from one last sin. I am going to kill him before he can sign
  those papers."</p>

  <p>"What papers?" she demanded, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing that you would understand," he answered. "They simply represent
  just one more of those wonderful deals which go to the loading of your body
  with jewels, and bring honest men to this."</p>

  <p>He dropped his hand for a moment. Her eyes were fixed upon his face almost
  hungrily. All the time she sought for some sign of weakness.</p>

  <p>"You mean the Bridgport hills amalgamation?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he answered. "You know something of his affairs, after all,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes--yes, I know something!" she admitted. "What have you to do with the
  Bridgport Mills?"</p>

  <p>The man's whole frame stiffened. His eyes flashed. He spoke
  rapidly--almost fiercely.</p>

  <p>"What have I to do with them? God in heaven! Why, they're my mills. I am
  John Wilkinson, who went to Bridgport with two hundred pounds, saved from my
  wages, and started business twenty-five years ago in a shed. I made money
  honestly. I found employment for hundreds of poor people, who earned wages
  which they had never dreamed of earning before. Bridgport was a poor place
  when I went to it. I have made it a prosperous city. My works are the finest
  in the country. My workpeople are the best paid. I was prosperous, honest,
  and respected. Then your husband comes upon the scene! He knows nothing of
  manufacturing, nothing of those honest and legitimate means by which a man
  can earn wealth for himself, and at the same time add to his country's
  prosperity. Your husband came like a great spider, hungry for blood, for
  money with him is the blood of all things. One by one he bought up my
  competitors. Before I had time to realize what was happening, there was a
  great trust formed against me. I had money and I had credit, the money and
  credit of an honest man. But what are these against the weapons with which
  your husband fights? They are gone, both of them. My mills will close down
  this week until he chooses to open them. Even my name will be his, to wheedle
  money out of poor investors, to make a great gambling scheme of an honest
  business. You were right, madam. It is your husband who has been fortunate,
  and I unfortunate. But there is a price that he must pay."</p>

  <p>The man paused, breathless. She leaned towards him.</p>

  <p>"Supposing he doesn't sign those papers?" she asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"He never will," the man answered.</p>

  <p>She listened once more, and wrung her hands.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you can't mean this!" she exclaimed. "It is too horrible! Besides,
  what do you gain? If you kill him, this deal will go through all the same. It
  VAR make no difference to you; someone else will take his place. The papers
  will surely be signed--if not by him, by another. Give me a few minutes. Let
  me talk to him. I have influence. Often he does as I wish. I will plead with
  him."</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Many have tried to plead with Philip Angus," he said. "What have they
  gained by it?"</p>

  <p>"But I am his wife!" she cried. "I can do more than anyone else in the
  world with him. Give me ten, five, even three minutes!"</p>

  <p>The man laughed--a hoarse, unpleasant sound.</p>

  <p>"Three minutes," he exclaimed, "to melt Philip Angus!"</p>

  <p>The woman clutched at his arm.</p>

  <p>"Remember that I am his wife," she cried. "Let me try. Oh, let me try! A
  few minutes can make no difference to you. If you stand over there by the
  curtains, he will never see you. He is almost blind."</p>

  <p>She stopped suddenly and turned her head towards the door. A little moan
  broke from her lips.</p>

  <p>"He is coming," she whispered, hoarsely. "You will give me those five
  minutes! You must--you must!"</p>

  <p>The man hesitated--hesitated gravely and deliberately. One gathered from
  his appearance that it was not a matter of weakness--only of calculation. In
  the end he pointed toward the clock.</p>

  <p>"You see the time? When the clock strikes, your husband dies. Until then,
  I will hear what you and he have to say together. Hush!"</p>

  <p>He stole softly away towards the curtains. The advancing footsteps were
  now clearly audible. The woman turned towards the door with a little sob.</p>

  <p>"So few minutes," she said to herself, "and Philip sometimes is so
  difficult. God help me! God give me words--show me how to move him. Ah,
  Philip!"</p>

  <p>The door was opened at last. A tall, thin man, in dinner-clothes and
  smoking jacket, entered and paused for a moment on the threshold. He wore
  heavy spectacles and carried a stick, with which he seemed to feel his
  way.</p>

  <p>"Margaret!" he exclaimed. "Where on earth are you? They told me that you
  were here."</p>

  <p>She moved towards him impulsively.</p>

  <p>"I have been waiting for you, Philip," she said. "I came in to say
  good-bye. How long you have been! Let me take you to your chair."</p>

  <p>He suffered her arm to rest upon his shoulder, but he frowned a little at
  the inference of her speech.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said. "But I am not quite blind yet. You are alone, then?
  I thought I heard voices."</p>

  <p>He seated himself before the table and took up the topmost of the papers
  that lay there in readiness. She lingered by his side.</p>

  <p>"Quite alone, dear," she said. "I was reading. I have been reading those
  documents."</p>

  <p>"Dry work for you, my dear," he answered, calmly.</p>

  <p>"I have been reading," she continued, a little tremulously, "of the
  Bridgport Mills amalgamation. You are not angry, are you?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Angry? Of course not! But why do you bother your pretty head about
  business? Where are you going to-night?"</p>

  <p>"I was going," she began, "to Lady Purcell's box at the Opera,
  but--but--"</p>

  <p>"Ah, to the Opera!" he interrupted. "I see you have your jewels on. Good
  girl! They look well on you, Margaret."</p>

  <p>"Do they, Philip?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"No one in the world, mind," he continued, impressively, "can have finer
  stones than you have in that necklace. In a few days' time, perhaps," he
  added, glancing fixedly at the paper upon which his hand was still resting,
  "I may be able to make you a little Christmas present which you will find
  worth accepting."</p>

  <p>She shuddered a little.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she said, "I want no more presents. I told you that I was going
  to the Opera. I have changed my mind. I have a headache. I don't want to go.
  I want to talk to you instead."</p>

  <p>He accepted her decision with the equanimity of a man of placid
  temperament married to a woman of many caprices. "Capital!" he said. "Well,
  I'll just sign these things, and then we'll have a cosy chat."</p>

  <p>He took up his pen, but her hand suddenly covered the place where he would
  have set his signature.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"Philip," she said, "it's about those papers I want to talk to you. Don't
  sign them."</p>

  <p>He turned round in his chair, looking at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Don't sign them!" he exclaimed. "Why, my dear girl, what do you
  mean?"</p>

  <p>She kept her hand firmly pressed upon the blank space.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she said, "you know that I read these over to you when they came
  up from the office. I have been thinking it all over. You are to buy the
  mills and machinery and everything, aren't you, for a trifle--seven thousand
  pounds, or something like that--just as much as the people owe?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"And they are worth?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"To us," he answered, "to the corporation, that is, anything up to a
  hundred and fifty thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>She drew a little breath, and glanced behind her uneasily. That
  somber-looking figure had drawn a little closer, or was it only her
  fancy?</p>

  <p>"I suppose, then, Philip," she went on, feverishly, "that you have these
  people--these Bridgport Mills people, I mean--cornered? They can't keep on in
  business against you? They must either sell or fail?"</p>

  <p>Her husband nodded.</p>

  <p>"Precisely!" he remarked. "The thing has been engineered in a thoroughly
  satisfactory manner. They never really had the ghost of a chance."</p>

  <p>She drew a little closer to him. Her right arm had stolen around his
  neck.</p>

  <p>"But, Philip," she protested, "I do not understand. These are honest men,
  are they not, who built up this concern? They had a right to refuse to join
  you if your terms did not suit them."</p>

  <p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"A right? They had a right, of course. The only trouble was that they ran
  up against a stronger corporation."</p>

  <p>She looked earnestly into his face.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Philip, is this quite honest?" she asked, fearfully.</p>

  <p>The slight frown upon his forehead deepened. His voice became almost
  harsh.</p>

  <p>"Honest? What on earth do you mean, Margaret? Honest? I don't recognize
  your use of the word."</p>

  <p>She took up the papers for a moment and replaced them.</p>

  <p>"I am thinking of the man whose name appears here--John Wilkinson," she
  said. "You are ruining him to make another fortune for yourself. I am
  thinking of his wife and family, Philip. Is it worth while? We don't need the
  money."</p>

  <p>He looked at her as one might look at a child.</p>

  <p>"My dear Margaret," he said, "everyone needs money. Very often the more
  you have the more you need. We'll talk about this presently. Harrison wants
  these papers down to-night."</p>

  <p>He turned a little round in his chair, took up his pen, and dipped it in
  the ink. Her hand closed upon his feverishly. She glanced around into the
  shadows of the room. Slowly creeping nearer, she saw the figure she
  dreaded.</p>

  <p>"Philip, you shall not--you shall not!" she exclaimed. "I don't want you
  to sign those papers."</p>

  <p>For the first time he showed signs of distinct annoyance.</p>

  <p>"You are hysterical!" he exclaimed, shortly. "The papers must be
  signed--and in a very few minutes."</p>

  <p>"Philip, don't do it," she begged. "Call it a whim of mine. We have enough
  money. Send for this man Wilkinson, and let him run his mills for himself; or
  give him a fair price for them."</p>

  <p>A fair price! He stroked his wife's hair indulgently. How could one reason
  with a person so ignorant of every law of finance?</p>

  <p>"My dear heart," he said, soothingly, "this comes of a woman trying to
  understand business. You don't even understand the first axioms of barter. A
  fair price is the very least you can get the other man to take. It has no
  relation whatever to value. That is another matter."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the clock, and back into the room. The ineffectiveness of
  her words made her almost hysterical.</p>

  <p>"Philip, you are wrong, dear!" she exclaimed. "I do not often ask you for
  anything," she continued, a little wildly. "I beg you to listen to me now.
  See, I am on my knees. I have been thinking of the wives and children of
  these men. The jewels you gave me would seem always like their tears. I could
  not wear them. I should hate them. Think, Philip, if you were this man John
  Wilkinson, and I your wife. Think what it would mean if we had to go out into
  the world again, penniless."</p>

  <p>He laughed dryly.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl," he said, "you do not flatter me. I can assure you that I
  should never have placed myself in such a position."</p>

  <p>"Dear, you cannot tell!" she exclaimed. "Don't you think that sometimes
  we--you and I--take life a little too easily? It is all so engrossing. It
  runs away with us. If we were to die to-night," she continued, nervously, and
  with a quick glance behind; "if we were to die to-night, Philip, you or I,
  would you feel that your hands were quite clean if you had signed those
  papers?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he answered, sharply. "We are all here to do the best we can
  for ourselves."</p>

  <p>"And for others, Philip!" she cried.</p>

  <p>He drew a little sigh, as of one anxious to be tolerant, and yet tried
  beyond his powers of endurance.</p>

  <p>"The man who was in business with those Utopian ideas, my dear Margaret,"
  he said, "would very soon go under. You are talking about matters which you
  do not understand. Business is a great duel, in which the weapons are brains
  and opportunity. The man who fails to make use of both goes down. The rules
  of the game are thoroughly understood. Both sides go in with their eyes open.
  There is no quarter to be given or expected. The man who allowed sentiment to
  even creep into his calculations, to weaken for one moment his arm when the
  time came to strike, would be crushed to death on the spot. The fittest
  survive, the weakest go under. I don't make the rules, but there they are. If
  you play the game you must abide by them."</p>

  <p>Once more he took up the pen. Despair held her nerveless for a moment. The
  clock had begun to strike! She dared not look round. Already she fancied she
  could hear stealthy footsteps.</p>

  <p>She waved her hand frantically towards the unseen intruder. Then she wound
  her arms around her husband's neck and breathed for a moment more freely.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she cried, "listen to me. I have been a good wife to you. I have
  begged for nothing as I am begging now. I may know nothing about business,
  but sometimes we women see the truth, even when it is hidden away in the
  darkest corner. I see the truth now, Philip," she continued, straining his
  face towards her. "I see it as though heaven itself were open. What are all
  these things worth--gold and jewels, the pride of great possessions, the
  power of wealth? Even if you stand to-day with your hands upon the levers
  that guide the world, death may come to-morrow; death may come at this moment
  to you, to me, to either of us. What about your rules then? What advantage
  has the strong man over the weak? Whose tale will reach God's ear the
  sooner--the cry of the beggared victim or the triumph of the conqueror?
  Philip, my husband, my love! You are so wonderful, so clever. I am very
  ignorant, but I have seen the truth. Tear up those papers, dear. For God's
  sake, tear them up! Let us have done for ever with this accursed
  money-making, with these bargains which leave behind the trail of misery and
  broken hearts. Give them to me, Philip. Only an hour ago you asked me what I
  would have for my Christmas present. I \trill have those papers. I will have
  you promise me that this man John Wilkinson shall come into your trust on
  fair terms, or that he shall be allowed to run his mills in his own way and
  for his own good."</p>

  <p>Angus hesitated. For her it was a moment of agony. Already, in
  imagination, she could see close behind her the shining muzzle of that
  levelled revolver. He was signing his own death-warrant! If only she could
  make him understand!</p>

  <p>The seconds ticked on. With a little shrug of the shoulders he handed over
  the papers.</p>

  <p>"You are trying me pretty high, my dear Margaret," he said.</p>

  <p>"You consent?" she cried. "You must consent!"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"You have always chosen your Christmas gift," he said. "We cannot break
  precedent."</p>

  <p>The pieces of torn paper fluttered down on to the carpet. She fell on her
  knees with a little sob of relief. He stooped down and kissed her lips.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you have any idea," he said, "how much that little Christmas
  present of yours has cost me?" She shook her head. Already her nervously
  strained ears had detected the closing of the window.</p>

  <p>"There is another price," she murmured. "Thank God!"</p>

    "By Jove, it's Richard!" he exclaimed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="first">THE two young men stood on the Embankment pavement. On their
  left the dark, turgid river, framed on the far side with a curving row of
  lamps; in the background a brilliant medley of sky signs; on their right, the
  two huge hotels, alight from basement to attic, pouring out warmth and
  brilliancy upon the chill November air. The younger and thinner of the
  two&mdash;also, by the way, the shabbier&mdash;pulled his companion by the
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Richard," he exclaimed, "look! Our first walk in London is, after all,
  allegorical. We stand between the dark waters of despair and all the fire and
  splendour of life. We stand here with wet feet, cold, half starved, amongst
  the outcasts. Enough of it, Richard. There is no middle way. For me, at any
  rate, it shall be the pinnacles&mdash;or that!"</p>

  <p>He pointed with a fierce downward gesture to the river. His
  companion&mdash;a youth of stouter build and more phlegmatic
  appearance&mdash;shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I agree with you, David," he said, slowly, "you want
  so much&mdash;you always have. I am ambitious, too, but I should be satisfied
  with something less than the topmost places, and nothing in the world would
  ever induce me to take my own life&mdash;nothing whatever!"</p>

  <p>His companion laughed and dragged him along.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said; "this is one of the backwaters of life. The whole place
  depresses me. Let us see what is on the other side of those palaces. Come
  quickly, Richard. You are always so slow."</p>

  <p><a id="picFG1"

  <p>They climbed the Savoy hill&mdash;tragical figures had they but known
  it&mdash;country lads called like moths to the candle by the far-off tumult
  of life. Three hundred miles north, the mother of David, wife of the Reverend
  David Barstow, Methodist and boot-maker, prayed by candle-light in her tiny
  bedroom for her truant son. And within a few hundred yards, Mr. Richard
  Skelmore, a grocer and coal-dealer, brooded in silence over his pipe,
  glancing sometimes into the fire, sometimes into the worn face of the woman
  who sat at the opposite corner of the hearth, pretending to darn his socks,
  weeping silently behind the shelter of her spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Them boys'll come to no harm, mother," he said once. "They're young and
  strong. They can stand a lot of knocking about. Besides, from what one hears
  London's no such a bad place. There's money to be made there, and Richard's a
  shrewd lad. They'll come to no harm, mother."</p>

  <p>His ++fife's reply was choked by a sob.</p>

  <p>"Please God!" she murmured. "Please God!"...</p>

  <p>Up the Savoy hill to the Strand, a few steps to the left, and they became
  entangled with the stream of carriages and motors turning slowly into the
  courtyard of the great hotel. Richard, diffident though stolid, would have
  hung back, but David laughed at his hesitation. Together they joined the
  supper-going throng. Speechless, they marvelled at the glossy silk hats, the
  white gloves, the strange uniformity of the men. But more wonderful still
  were the women&mdash;beautiful, fairy-like creatures, their lace skirts
  upraised as though to show their silk-clad ankles and satin slippers; women
  with golden hair and black, marvellously coiffured, flashing with ribbons or
  jewels, shaking perfume from their clothes which robbed the November night
  even of its dourness. Their voices, their laughter, their gestures were all
  strange. It was Venusberg to the peasant; the magic of it leaped through
  their veins. They pressed closer to the great glass front. They saw the
  splendour of the spreading vestibule, the blaze of lights, the banks of
  flowers, the women without their cloaks&mdash;bare-necked save for their
  jewels, the men in their immaculate dress-coats and white waist-coats, the
  servants with powdered hair and gorgeous livery. They even caught a whisper
  of the distant music&mdash;music which seemed to strike a keynote of this
  sudden glimpse of Paradise&mdash;thrilling, voluptuous, inspiring. David drew
  a long breath, a breath that came through his teeth like a sob.</p>

  <p>"My father would call this Hell!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Mine would never believe in such things," Richard muttered. "Man, it is
  wonderful."</p>

  <p>Their presence became noticed, and a person in uniform&mdash;tall and
  splendid&mdash;swept them away. Loiterers were not allowed. Back into the
  Strand, into the streets, to the river&mdash;where they chose. David laughed
  harshly.</p>

  <p>"Shall you ever forget that, Richard?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I shall never forget it!" Richard answered.</p>

  <p>"They turn us away because we are poor!" David cried. "They are right!
  There is no place in this world for the poor! Some day we will come back, you
  and I, Richard! Some way or other we will forge the golden key!"</p>

  <p>But Richard said nothing. His face was set and hard, and his eyes seemed
  to have grown closer together. But he, too, had sworn an oath!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Ten years of solid, strenuous labour, of dogged persistence, of mechanical
  industry which one by one overcame the barriers which guard promotion, slowly
  but surely Richard moved upwards. His clothes&mdash;characteristic clothes
  they were, too&mdash;marked his progress. He wore a silk hat now&mdash;a silk
  hat carefully chosen, bargained for, ironed every night himself by some
  secret process, glossier always than any other in the office, although none
  cost less. His trousers were freshly creased every morning in a home-made
  press. The age of his black coat&mdash;second-hand to start with&mdash;was
  incredible when one considered its smoothness and fit. His linen was a fraud,
  though its defects were hidden. His gloves&mdash;carried and never actually
  worn&mdash;seemed likely to remain new to all eternity. The great Mr. Driver,
  of Holmes and Driver, Holborn Viaduct, found nothing to complain of in the
  appearance of this young man whom he had just met by appointment in Spiers
  and Pond's bar at Cannon Street Station. He shook hands condescendingly.
  Richard had raised his hat.</p>

  <p>"Until we have settled this little matter of business, Mr. Skelmore," the
  great merchant said, "it is just as well, perhaps, for your sake, that we are
  not seen too much together. My motor is outside, and, if convenient, I
  propose that we take our luncheon in the West-end."</p>

  <p>"Just as you wish, Mr. Driver," Richard answered. "I am quite at your
  service."</p>

  <p>So then, for the first time, Richard passed the threshold of the Milan
  Restaurant. A commonplace, insignificant young man, looking exactly what he
  was&mdash;a City clerk, a son of the people&mdash;took his place for the
  first time with those gayer and brighter children from the world he knew
  nothing of. He showed no signs of what he was feeling. His attitude of
  respectful attention to every word which fell from his companion's lips never
  wavered. And yet his heart was thumping against his ribs. It was
  premature&mdash;this. He had not meant to breathe this atmosphere as an
  outsider. He did his best to render himself unconscious of it&mdash;to forget
  the pleasant sense of warmth, the flutter of women's dresses, their soft
  laughter, the delicate cooking, the yellow wine. So far as he could, he
  steeled himself against his environment. Every day he lunched for sevenpence
  in a grimy hole underground, where the smells of countless dinners hung about
  the walls, where the few waiters were listless and dirty, where the
  appointments were coarse, the linen none too clean, and the gas burnt day and
  night. It was an interlude, this&mdash;no more. His day had not yet come.</p>

  <p>"I see no reason, Mr. Skelmore," his host said, while they were waiting
  for a moment between courses, "why we should delay entering upon the subject
  which has brought us together. I understand that you are thinking of leaving
  the services of Messrs. Medbury, Smith, and Co.?"</p>

  <p>"I am prepared to do so," Richard answered, cautiously, "if I can find a
  suitable position."</p>

  <p>"And what," Mr. Driver asked, "should you consider a suitable
  position?"</p>

  <p>Richard was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"A suitable position," he said, slowly, "would be one where I should be
  paid, in actual salary or prospects, what I am worth."</p>

  <p>Mr. Driver smiled. He had been told that this was a confident young
  man.</p>

  <p>"Who is to decide," he asked, "that important question?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be content to leave it to you, sir," Richard answered. "I will
  tell you only what I can do."</p>

  <p>Mr. Driver nodded.</p>

  <p>"That sounds reasonable," he said. "Please go on."</p>

  <p>"Your turnover last year," Richard said, "was three hundred and
  forty-seven thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"How the deuce do you know that?" Mr. Driver exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," Richard answered. "The point is this. Next year I could
  raise your turnover to five hundred thousand pounds; the year after to seven
  hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Mr. Driver raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"That's tall talking," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I speak within my figures," the young man said, calmly, producing a piece
  of paper from his pocket and laying it upon the table. "You will see
  transactions here, sir, to the value of two hundred thousand pounds. They
  have all been arranged by me. The blanks represent the source of supply and
  the customers' names. The day I joined your firm I could fill them in."</p>

  <p>Mr. Driver glanced through the papers which his companion had gently
  pushed across towards him. He checked off item after item, and his opinion of
  the young man with the wooden face and close-set eyes underwent a sudden
  change. It was genius. There was no other word for it.</p>

  <p><a id="picFG2"
     name="picFG2"></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300341h-images/FalseGods3.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"I might add, also," Richard said, "that the credit of your firm being
  better than the credit of Messrs. Medbury, Smith, and Co., I could doubtless
  obtain more liberal terms for you than those figures show. I refer more
  particularly to the export department, of which I have had sole control, and
  where cash payments are much appreciated."</p>

  <p>"Supposing we come to terms and take over this business," Mr. Driver
  asked, after a short pause, "what would become of Medbury, Smith, and
  Co.?"</p>

  <p>"Their business would be ruined," Richard answered, calmly. "They would be
  in the Gazette in two years' time."</p>

  <p>Mr. Driver looked curiously across the table at his guest. He was a hard,
  unscrupulous man himself, but such callousness moved even him. "I wonder you
  haven't approached them," he remarked. "They might give you a
  partnership."</p>

  <p>"I should not accept it," Richard answered, deliberately. "They are on the
  downward grade. I prefer to associate with capital and enterprise. I
  want&mdash;to get on."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't wonder if you didn't," Mr. Driver remarked. "What salary are
  you getting now?"</p>

  <p>"Four hundred a year," Richard answered.</p>

  <p>"Married?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"What do you want from us?" Mr. Driver continued.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred a year, one per cent on the increase of your turnover, and a
  junior partnership in three years," Richard said, glibly.</p>

  <p>"Prove your figures and it's a bargain," his companion declared.</p>

  <p>Richard smiled for the first time.</p>

  <p>"I am alone at the office after five this evening," he said. "You shall
  see the books. You can take any one of the items on that list and verify
  it."</p>

  <p>They went out together half an hour later. A young man&mdash;pale, with
  dark eyes, clean-shaven, and with slightly worn features, rose suddenly from
  his chair and caught Richard by the arm.</p>

  <p>"By Heaven, it's Richard!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"David!" the other exclaimed.</p>

  <p>They shook hands. There was a moment's embarrassed silence. They had seen
  nothing of one another lately. Richard had been too engrossed for
  friendships.</p>

  <p>"Curious that we should meet here, David," he remarked.</p>

  <p>David laughed gaily, and pointed out of the window.</p>

  <p>"That is where we stood," he remarked. "Have you been down below yet? Have
  you penetrated into the holy of holies?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Richard answered.</p>

  <p>"Nor I," David declared. "I'm afraid poetry will never take me there. You
  are doing all right?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty well, thank you," Richard answered.</p>

  <p>"We'll meet there some day yet," David declared, laughing. "Look me up
  when you've time. I change my abode pretty often, but I'm always to be heard
  of at the Wanderers' Club."</p>

  <p>So they met and passed on, these two who had once been swayed by a common
  and passionate impulse. David was thoughtful for a moment. Then he turned to
  his companion&mdash;a middle-aged man, with classic features and flowing grey
  hair.</p>

  <p>"Studley," he said, "that young man and I came from the same village in
  Westmorland. We literally ran away from home to make our fortunes. I remember
  the night after our arrival. We were walking along the Embankment&mdash;the
  river on one side, these palaces of light on the other. It was all fairyland
  to us. We were excited, emotional. We came over here, pressed our noses
  against the great windows, and watched the people going into the
  restaurant."</p>

  <p>His companion laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have seen you," he said.</p>

  <p>"We were queer youngsters," David continued. "Remember that we came
  straight from a tiny village, that we had never even been in a town larger
  than Kendal, or seen a woman in evening dress. It was a sort of Arabian
  Nights to us&mdash;a Paradise, if you like. I remember even now how thrilled
  we were. I think we joined hands on our way homeward, and swore a common oath
  to attack the great citadel of Life from that moment. We went for our
  fortunes hammer and tongs, and I think that the height of our ambition at
  that time was to wear a swallow-tail coat, a white waistcoat, a white tie,
  and attend a lady with fair hair, a low-necked dress, black silk stockings,
  and high-heeled shoes down the corridor there and into the restaurant."</p>

  <p>Studley laughed quietly.</p>

  <p>"Your friend," he remarked, "seems to be still climbing. You, my dear
  David, might realize your ambition when you chose. If only you'll promise to
  write that story for me in the way I have pointed out, I'll advance you five
  hundred pounds on account."</p>

  <p>David smiled. His eyes were suddenly fixed&mdash;reminiscent. He saw a
  country lane whose hedges were wreathed with honeysuckle and wild rose, a low
  privet hedge, more roses, pinks, and clematis, a cottage, and a girl. He
  smelt the new-mown hay. He heard the drowsy evening sounds. He heard the
  whisper of his own name as the girl came down the trim garden path. His lips
  parted&mdash;his smile became a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to accept my offer?" Studley asked.</p>

  <p>"Not I!" David answered. "I was just trying to think how Anna would look
  in a low-necked gown!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>There is a little space above the foyer at the Milan where the men-folk
  wait while their womenkind leave their theatre coats, smooth their hair,
  arrange their jewels, and bestow a final glance upon themselves in the long
  gilt mirrors before sallying forth to conquer. There David and Richard met
  once more, stared at one another doubtfully for a moment, and then exchanged
  embarrassed greetings. Richard had grown portly, his hair was a little grey,
  his cheeks were still pale, his eyes deeper set than ever. He was dressed in
  the very height of fashion&mdash;dressed, too, by a good tailor. His links
  and studs were all that they should be. His white waist coat was cut
  according to the fashion of the moment. His tie and collar were both correct.
  David, alas! fell very far short of such perfection. His dress-coat was a
  little shabby; his shirt had only one stud-hole and a distinct bulge; his
  tie, carefully arranged though it was, had evidently been through the
  cleaner's hands. His face, still thin, still a little worn, was brown with
  health; his mass of dark hair, sprinkled with grey, picturesque; his mouth
  and expression as delightful as ever.</p>

  <p>"Queer thing that we should meet here, Richard!" he exclaimed, with a
  little laugh.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly a coincidence," Richard declared.</p>

  <p>David patted him on the back.</p>

  <p>"I hear that you are a merchant prince," he said. "You look the
  part&mdash;you do, indeed, old man!"</p>

  <p>Richard accepted the compliment unmoved.</p>

  <p>"I have been fortunate," he admitted. "You remember we set our hands to
  the plough the same night."</p>

  <p>"Remember! Of course I do," David answered, gaily. "Well, we've neither of
  us done so badly, eh? I'm a pauper still, but here and there a fool buys a
  copy of my poems, or an editor lets me spoil his pages. So I live! What can a
  man do more?"</p>

  <p>Richard looked for a moment as though he scarcely understood.</p>

  <p>"I am glad," he said, slowly, "that you are content."</p>

  <p>David laughed.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid my small measure of prosperity," he said, "would never
  satisfy you. Mine is a tiny income; but down in the country one doesn't need
  much. Studley is giving us some dinner here to-night&mdash;the editor I
  impose myself upon most frequently."</p>

  <p>Richard&mdash;by the by, he was Sir Richard now&mdash;toyed with his gold
  chain for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Your views on life," he said, with some show of curiosity, "have altered
  since we stood in the gutter and recorded our vow."</p>

  <p>"Again and again," David laughed. "Thank God for it! What was a real
  picture to me that night has become allegorical. The gods have touched my
  eyes." Sir Richard said nothing. He did not understand. But it was envy, no
  doubt, which made his less fortunate friend of former days change his point
  of view. "You are married?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To the dearest little girl in the world," David declared. "You'll see her
  directly. By the by, I remember reading of your wedding. Half a column in the
  Morning Post, you lucky fellow!"</p>

  <p>"I married the widow of my late partner," Sir Richard declared. "I am
  sorry that we are giving a dinner-party to-night, or I should have been glad
  for you to have joined us. We are entertaining the Lord Mayor
  unofficially&mdash;my wife's cousin. You will see our table as you go
  in&mdash;on the left, covered with pink roses."</p>

  <p>"I'll look out for it," David declared, good-humouredly. "Ah, here's
  Anna!"</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p>The women, curiously enough, came out together&mdash;as strange a contrast
  as any two figures in the ever-moving crowd. Lady Skelmore was short and
  stout. Her face, for all its coating of powder, was red; her hair, for all
  its blaze of diamonds, was stiff and ungainly; her gown of white satin was
  cut by a celebrated dressmaker, but her ladyship's instructions had been
  followed blindly and her figure was scarcely adapted to the Directoire style.
  Her neck blazed with jewels. She was very confident, very self-satisfied. And
  by her side came a tall girl, with large brown eyes and a sensitive, humorous
  mouth. She wore a simple black gown, which certainly was cut after the
  fashion of a few seasons ago. Her uncoiffured hair was arranged with the
  utmost simplicity. She wore no ornament nor any jewellery. Sir Richard did
  not flinch. The introductions followed and were duly acknowledged. Lady
  Skelmore, however, looked in something like amazement at this young woman
  whose acquaintance she had made. What was Richard about, she wondered! A girl
  here at the Milan in a home-made gown&mdash;such a cut&mdash;and not even a
  brooch! Lady Skelmore did not linger. She did not think it necessary to make
  any apology for her haste.</p>

  <p>"My dear Richard!" she exclaimed, as they sailed through the foyer.
  "Whatever induced you to introduce me to such people?"</p>

  <p>"I ran away to London as a boy with Barstow," he answered, apologetically.
  "I am afraid he has made rather a failure of things. But I came face to face
  with him there, and it was a little awkward."</p>

  <p>His wife shrugged her profuse shoulders.</p>

  <p>"One isn't likely to see them again," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Anna was almost disturbed. The pleasure of her evening was threatened.</p>

  <p>"David," she pleaded, "Is there anything wrong with me? Am I so very
  dowdy?"</p>

  <p>David threw back his head and laughed&mdash;laughed like an angel.</p>

  <p>"Here's old Studley!" he exclaimed. "Let's ask him!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Southwards over the white roads, through the scented twilight, the great
  car with its two blazing eyes leaped and tore, always on fourth speed, always
  reckless alike of the police who challenged and the scattering crowds. On the
  front seat the chauffeur, leaning a little forward, and with face like a
  mask, sat alone. Inside was but one passenger&mdash;Sir Richard Skelmore,
  knight and member of Parliament. Richard was a little older now&mdash;a
  little shaken. The starch seemed to have gone from his frame, his cheeks were
  flabby, an unpleasant light was in his eyes. Sometimes he lifted the flap and
  looked behind. Sometimes he pored over the papers with which the little table
  in front of him was strewn. Sir Richard was ill at ease. He raised the
  india-rubber tube to his lips and spoke to the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"How far are we from Southampton, Murray?" he asked.</p>

  <p>His tone was apologetic, for it was a question which he had asked often
  before. The man's answer, however, betrayed no sign of impatience.
  "Thirty-seven miles, sir. Good road all the way."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard laid down the speaking-tube and drew a little breath between
  his clenched teeth. After all, there might be a chance! Then there was a
  sharp corner, a grinding of brakes, a shout, a crash, chaos! The car had run
  into a half-a-dozen stray cows. Sir Richard crawled out. The chauffeur,
  covered with dust, limped his way to the engine.</p>

  <p>"We're done, sir," he announced, half sobbing. "I did my best, but we had
  to take risks."</p>

  <p>"Can't you tinker her up?" Sir Richard asked, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>The man almost laughed.</p>

  <p>"Not in a week, sir," he answered. "If it could be done, I should do it,
  you may be sure. A hundred pounds was a fortune to me. I did my best."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard filled his hand with gold. Money was of little use to him now.
  Then he started down the lane. He had some vague idea of walking, he scarcely
  knew where. Perhaps he would come to a town where he could hire a car.</p>

  <p>He walked swiftly, but he was unused to exercise. There were no lights in
  front&mdash;no sign even of a village. How far could he walk, he wondered.
  Already his feet were weary. Perhaps there would be an inn soon. Then he came
  to a sharp corner in the road, and immediately afterwards a small house lying
  a little way back&mdash;a long greystone building, almost covered with
  clematis and creeping shrubs. He paused in front of it for a minute and
  looked in. The air was almost faint with the perfume of roses. There were
  sweet peas and clematis, tall hollyhocks and fragrant borders of mignonette.
  Sir Richard hesitated for a moment. Then he lifted the latch and walked
  quietly up the path. There were no blinds. The curtains of the little
  drawing-room were undrawn. He could see a man lying in a basket chair. A lady
  at a piano was just finishing a song, the last word of which floated out to
  him as he walked softly up the grass border. She came toward the man, who
  rose from his chair holding out his hands. He passed his arm around her waist
  and suddenly pushed open the French windows.</p>

  <p>"Come out and listen, Anna," he said. "Perhaps our nightingale is
  singing."</p>

  <p>They came face to face with Richard, standing like a statue in the middle
  of their narrow path&mdash;Sir Richard, bare-headed (for he had lost his hat
  in the accident) and with the rising moonlight full in his face. The two men
  gazed at one another in amazement, and David removed his pipe from his
  teeth.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, it's Richard!" he exclaimed. "Sir Richard, I beg your pardon,"
  he continued, with a whimsical laugh. "Do you really mean that you have come
  to see us? You must have dropped out of a flying machine," he added, looking
  outside for some trace of a vehicle.</p>

  <p><a id="picFG4"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Sir Richard cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"I was motoring to Southampton," he said. "We had an accident a quarter of
  a mile back. I was walking to where I could find a vehicle to take me where I
  could hire another motor."</p>

  <p>David laughed reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "you can't get any farther to-night. There's no
  town within miles of us, and no one round here has a motor-car. We can put
  you up, and glad to. Come along in and let me give you a drink to start
  with."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard shook his head. The black fear was upon him. He showed it in
  his white face and twitching lips.</p>

  <p>"I can't stop," he said. "I must get on board my yacht to-night. To-morrow
  will be too late."</p>

  <p>"To-night!" David repeated, in amazement. "But, my dear fellow, be
  reasonable. It isn't possible. Make the best of things and have a shake-down
  with us."</p>

  <p>"Do, please, stay, Sir Richard," the lady begged, and, even in his
  terrible plight, Sir Richard knew that the voice was sweet.</p>

  <p>"We will do our best to make you comfortable. I will see about some dinner
  at once."</p>

  <p>She turned toward the house. Sir Richard let her go.</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong, Richard?" David asked.</p>

  <p>"Everything is wrong," the other answered. "Don't you read the
  papers?"</p>

  <p>"Never, if I can help it," David declared.</p>

  <p>"I am ruined, and worse than ruined!" Sir Richard said, unsteadily. "Worse
  than ruined! Do you hear that? Can you understand now why I must be on my
  yacht to-night? It is that or a convict prison!"</p>

  <p>David dropped the pipe he was holding. All the natural gaiety seemed to
  have faded from his face.</p>

  <p>"Richard," he said, gravely, "is it as bad as that, really?"</p>

  <p>"It is that&mdash;no more nor less," Sir Richard declared. "Have you a
  telephone to your house?"</p>

  <p>"There is no telephone within ten miles," David answered. "Perhaps you
  could rest quietly here, and they would not find you."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard looked about him alike a hunted man. A cart drove by, and he
  drew back into the shadow. The two men were close up against the window of
  the little drawing-room. Suddenly he gripped David by the shoulder and
  pointed in.</p>

  <p>"You are a weak creature, David," he muttered. "Don't you remember that
  night when you dragged me up from the Embankment? Don't you remember swearing
  that for you it should be the pinnacles or the river? Why, man," he
  continued, "your words ate into my brain. They rang in my ears year after
  year. They were the motto of my life. Didn't I set myself to conquer
  fate&mdash;to become one of those whom we saw? Thousands by thousands I built
  up my fortune. I cared not a whit for the stepping stones. I made myself into
  a machine for money-making. The rungs of the ladder for me were as though
  they had never existed. Every action of my life was shaped toward that one
  end. I reached the pinnacles, David. I have been there. And you&mdash;you
  whose words spurred me on&mdash;you have been content with the lesser things.
  Curse you, David! I wish that I had never seen your face, or heard you
  speak!"</p>

  <p>He had turned toward the road, listening once more, but David rested his
  hand lightly upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Richard," he said, "I was a young fool in those days; but you, too, you
  were not over wise. You did not understand. When we looked in through the
  windows that night, what we saw&mdash;what we both saw&mdash;seemed to me to
  represent everything that was best in life. There was beauty and luxury,
  freedom from care, happiness. It was for that I strove, and, as the years go,
  the material goal changes, but the desire remains. I, Richard, I never sought
  anything less than the pinnacles, and I have found them&mdash;in there."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard gazed, and his narrow eyes grew narrower. It was a long, low
  drawing-room, with a grand piano in one corner, water-colours hanging upon
  the white walls, bowls of flowers everywhere, red-shaded lamps, comfortable
  chairs. And coming toward them the beautiful woman, whose smile still brought
  the light into the younger man's eyes. Sir Richard turned away. He had no
  words. He walked a little into the shadow, and David did not follow him. Then
  an unfamiliar sound broke the summer silence. A great car with flashing
  lights pulled up at the door. Two men sprang down. The voice of one of them
  rang out distinctly upon the silence.</p>

  <p>"He must be here!" one said. "Watch the lane, Gregory."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard held out his hand to his friend.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are," he said. "It shall not be here, I promise you that.
  It shall not be here!"</p>

  <p>He moved farther back into the shadow&mdash;they heard him go crashing
  through the hedge. The two men stopped to listen. Then there was a sharp
  report, a groan, and silence! They all moved toward the spot. Anna came
  running out of the house.</p>

  <p>"What is it, David?" she cried. "What has happened?"</p>

  <p>He led her back.</p>

  <p>"Nothing that you or I can help, dear," he said. "Nothing that concerns
  us."</p>

  <p>"But Sir Richard? What has happened to him?" she asked, fearfully.</p>

  <p>David shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Dear," he answered, "he set up the false gods. Come into the house. There
  is nothing that we can do."</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">"THAT," Felix declared, pointing from the club window down
  into the square below, "is the one thing from which all the resources of our
  civilization seems powerless to save us. It is in that revolutions have been
  born."</p>

  <p>His companions followed his gesture, and looked up at him as though for an
  explanation.</p>

  <p>"We have school-boards," Felix continued, "charitable institutions,
  philanthropists without number in every great city. Theoretically there
  should be no such class as those who sit there. Yet there isn't a city that
  hasn't something of this sort to show."</p>

  <p>The elder of his two companions, Mayne Richards, a lawyer, wealthy, and a
  professed cynic, smiled a little scornfully. "My dear Felix," he said, "no
  system of life can ever provide for people who declined to be provided for.
  The men who sit around down there are the men who will not help themselves.
  You will find them in every great city, and you will find exactly the same
  look in their faces. They are the men who will not be helped. They are the
  lazy good-for-nothings of life, the victims of drunkenness and the other
  vices of their order."</p>

  <p>"You don't believe in such a thing as ill luck, then?" Felix asked
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"Not to any extent," the other answered. "Nowadays, if a man comes to
  that, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it is his own fault. The very
  faces and attitudes of those people speak for themselves. They are a
  shiftless, impossible lot."</p>

  <p>"I think Richards is right," the third man remarked, taking a cigar from
  his mouth. `All this talk about the unemployed, and the hard life the
  laboring classes lead, is mostly electioneering trash. I bet you there isn't
  one of those fellows who couldn't get work if he wanted it."</p>

  <p>"Put it this way," Richards said. "I should say there wasn't one of them
  who would do the work honestly if it was offered to him. There aren't many
  things which an employer demands of the British workman&mdash;reasonable
  honesty, reasonable sobriety, reasonable intelligence. I bet you'd find there
  isn't one of those fellows who spend their days lounging there who is to be
  trusted half a yard.</p>

  <p>"I am willing to make a bet with you about that," Felix declared.</p>

  <p>"Formulate it, then," Richards answered. "I'll back my opinion, with
  pleasure."</p>

  <p>"Come down into the square with me," Felix said. "We will walk slowly
  round past the seats where the men are sitting. I will select three, and I
  will entrust them, each of them, with a different commission. Then I will
  make a bet with you that each one of those three will fulfill his errand
  honestly."</p>

  <p>"They might deliver a letter," Richards said, "or anything of that sort,
  because there would be nothing to be gained by doing otherwise."</p>

  <p>Felix laughed. "I mean a real test," he said. "The three men whom I select
  shall each have a sum of money to take to a certain place."</p>

  <p>"Then I trust," Richards said, "that you will make the sum small, for you
  will certainly lose it as well as your bet."</p>

  <p>"We shall see about that," Felix answered. "Remember, I choose the men and
  I choose the stakes. I \rill bet you fifty pounds that the three men whom I
  pick out will do their errands honestly."</p>

  <p>"I will give you odds," Richards answered. "The bet as it stands isn't
  fair. I will bet you that two out of the three will not deliver the money
  with which you entrust them, and that you never hear of them again except by
  accident."</p>

  <p>"Done!" Felix declared. "Get your hat, and we will go down into the
  square. Come, Andrewes," he added, turning to their companion, "you shall
  come, too, and be umpire."</p>

  <p>The three men left the club, crossed the street, and entered the square
  together. It was by no means a cheerful-looking place. There were three or
  four flower-beds, empty now, for it was midwinter, and a deserted
  fountain-basin standing in the middle of the waste of asphalt. At regular
  intervals within the railing were iron seats, and upon these were dotted
  about here and there a miserable little company of human beings. At first
  glance they seemed all the same class&mdash;men upon whom misfortune had had
  a pernicious effect, men whose eyes were either fixed upon vacancy with dull,
  unseeing persistence, or who looked downward to the ground under their feet,
  most of them with their heads supported by their hands. They were of all
  ages, too, although the man who was a little past middle-age seemed to
  predominate. There was very little conversation among them, very little
  curiosity, very little interest in the passers-by or the traffic in the
  streets beyond.</p>

  <p>Felix drew a little breath. "Poor chaps!" he said softly. "They look
  hungry, too, most of them. We must pretend to be talking as we walk round.
  I've picked out one already&mdash;and another. I shall take that boy for the
  third. Now I am going to ask them to come into the club while we explain what
  we want."</p>

  <p>He went back and spoke to a strongly built, middle-aged man with hollow
  eyes and iron-grey beard.</p>

  <p>"My man," he said, "do you want a job?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" was the prompt reply. "When?"</p>

  <p>"At once," Felix answered. "Get up, please, and come with us. I want three
  altogether. I am going to speak to the other two."</p>

  <p>He moved on a few seats, and spoke to a tall boy, thin and haggard of
  feature, miserably clothed, and with great holes in his shoes. "Do you want a
  job?" he asked him.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" was the quick, almost feverish, reply.</p>

  <p>"Come with us, then," Felix said.</p>

  <p>Then he stopped to speak to the third whom he had chosen&mdash;a tall,
  powerful-looking young man, apparently about twenty-five. He had a fair,
  smooth face, a little strained as though with hunger, a little reckless about
  the mouth and eyes, a little hard, too, about the jaw.</p>

  <p>"Want a job?" Felix asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" the man answered, almost fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Come with us," Felix answered. "You see, there are two other of you. I
  want three altogether. Please follow us across to the club there."</p>

  <p>Felix and his friends reentered the club, followed by the three men. They
  led the way into a small room on the ground floor. Felix placed three chairs
  in a row, and bade the men sit down. Then he rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Presently," he said to them, "I am going to give you something to eat.
  First of all, I am going to give you a cup of coffee. Then I will tell you
  what this job is."</p>

  <p>"Is it something I can do?" the young man asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"And I?" the older one exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I will do it," the boy muttered, "whatever it is, if there's money to be
  earned!"</p>

  <p>Felix smiled at them encouragingly. "It will be the easiest thing in the
  world," he said.</p>

  <p>"We shall leave you for five minutes while you drink your coffee. I will
  tell the waiter to bring you some rolls with it. Afterward you shall have
  something more substantial."</p>

  <p>They went out into the hall and entered the smoking-room. Richards was
  laughing softly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Felix," he said, "you are the strangest mortal I ever met. There
  is no end to your experiments, but some day I think there will be an end to
  your optimism. However, why should I grumble?" he added, lighting a cigar. "I
  am going to make fifty pounds&mdash;fifty pounds, that is, I suppose, less
  the cost of the dinner, which I shall have to stand you."</p>

  <p>"It's a foolish bet, Felix," the younger man declared. "There aren't many
  of those young fellows hanging about unless there is a reason for it."</p>

  <p>"You don't believe that a man can have ill luck, then?" Felix asked.</p>

  <p>"Not to that extent," Andrews answered. "Odd bits of bad luck we all have
  now and then, but the man who's sober and honest, and who wants work, gets
  it. That's my experience, anyway."</p>

  <p>Felix smiled. "My young friend," he said, "as you have been down from
  college only a year, and spend half of your time in town, I don't believe you
  know a thing about it. As for Richards, well, he has formed his opinions and
  I have formed mine. We shall see. I think we can go back to them now."</p>

  <p>They were sitting just where they had been left. In front of each was an
  empty cup and an empty plate. Felix sat upon the edge of the table, a few
  feet away from them.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said. "I will tell you what I want you to do. I have three
  letters which I want delivered, one in London, one in Kettering, and one in
  Cambridge. These letters each contain a small sum of money, which I wish
  conveyed to the person to whom the letter is addressed. I shall give you your
  train-fare, and enough money for all your expenses. All that I ask is that at
  exactly this time, or as near it as possible, the day after to-morrow, you
  bring me back, from the people to whom the letters are addressed, a reply,
  and I shall then give you each a sovereign."</p>

  <p>They were all clearly puzzled. The elderly man looked at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I ought to explain," Felix continued, feeling for the first time
  a little diffidence, "that this offer of mine is the result of a bet. It
  doesn't make any difference to you, does it? All you have to do is to take
  the train to the place the letter is addressed to, and bring a reply back to
  me. It's easy work, and you will be well paid for it."</p>

  <p>The elderly man and the boy rose to their feet eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Are the letters ready?" the former asked.</p>

  <p>"Will there be enough money for the night's lodging?" the boy
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Plenty," Felix answered. "While you sit there, I am going to write the
  letters."</p>

  <p>The third man rose to his feet. There was something in his eyes which
  Felix did not altogether like. His lips were tightly drawn, and for the first
  time his unusual height seemed to become noticeable.</p>

  <p>"So this is a bet, is it?" he asked, "a bet upon our honesty?"</p>

  <p>Felix assented gravely. "One of my friends," he said, "has offered to
  wager me fifty pounds that I could not select three men from among you out
  there who would perform an errand like this honestly. I have accepted his
  bet. I have chosen you three, and I am quite sure that you will deliver your
  letters, bring me back the receipts, and earn the sovereigns which I promise
  you."</p>

  <p>"And what about the fifty pounds that you win?" the man asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"That is my business," Felix answered. "It is nothing to do with you. Will
  you take your letter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated. "Yes, I'll take it," he answered shortly.</p>

  <p>Felix went to the writing-table. He wrote three letters, and in each,
  without any concealment of the fact, he placed two five-pound notes. Then he
  sealed and addressed them, and took them back to the writing table.</p>

  <p>"Now listen," he said, "if you cannot find the person to whom these
  letters are addressed, you can bring them back here. To-day is Monday. I
  shall expect you here on Wednesday afternoon between four and five o'clock. I
  am going to give you each a little more than you should need for your
  expenses. You can tell me what you have spent, and we can arrange for the
  balance."</p>

  <p>He place a letter and two sovereigns in the hand of each one of them. The
  boy and the gray-haired man grasped theirs eagerly and went out with scarcely
  a word. The other one lingered.</p>

  <p>"You don't ask for any promise from us?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," Felix answered. "The promise goes without saying."</p>

  <p>"Mind, I give none," the man said. "I do not promise to return. I do not
  promise I will not steal the notes which I saw you place in this letter."</p>

  <p>"If you do so, it will be dishonest," Felix said. "I can only say that I
  hope you will do nothing of the sort."</p>

  <p>The man wheeled about without a word and left the room. Richards, who was
  sitting in an easy chair, slapped his knee and burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"You silly ass, Felix!" he exclaimed. "Eighty-six pounds you have thrown
  away this afternoon. Eighty-six pound! Well, all I can hope is that you mill
  learn a little wisdom from it."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At a quarter to four on Wednesday afternoon, Felix drove up in his
  motor-car and entered the club.</p>

  <p>"Anyone been asking for me?" he inquired of the doorkeeper.</p>

  <p>"No one special, sir," the man answered. "Mr. Andrewes and Mr. Richards
  said that they were in the smoking-room when you came in." Felix nodded, and
  joined his friends.</p>

  <p>"I've ordered the dinner," Richards said. "I suppose we may as well have
  it tonight."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Felix answered; "only I am not at all prepared to say that I
  shall not be host. Wait a moment."</p>

  <p>He sent a message down to the doorkeeper that anyone who asked for him
  should be admitted.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," Richards remarked, "we'll have a rubber of bridge."</p>

  <p>At six o'clock Felix sent down another message, but the doorkeeper
  announced that no one had inquired after him. At seven o'clock he asked
  again, and met with the same reply. At eight o'clock they sat down to dinner.
  Richards raised his glass and proposed a toast.</p>

  <p>"This is my wish for you," he said, "that to-night's lesson may teach you
  to keep your head from the clouds."</p>

  <p>"And your feet upon the earth," Andrewes echoed.</p>

  <p>Felix sighed. "I am disappointed," he admitted simply.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"It's just about a year," Richards remarked, turning away from the club
  window, "since our friend Felix looked down into the square there and make
  the most ridiculous bet that was ever proposed."</p>

  <p>"Three days before Christmas, wasn't it?" Andrews remarked. "How the
  fellows did chaff him for weeks afterward!"</p>

  <p>"He is an impossible person," Richards declared. "He needed just such a
  lesson as that. I only wish, for his own sake, that he'd learn a little
  common sense in the management of his business."</p>

  <p>Andrewes nodded sympathetically. "Not doing over well, is he?"</p>

  <p>Richards sighed, but made no answer. Almost at that moment Felix entered.
  Something of the old blitheness seemed to have gone from his manner. He
  looked much older, and there were lines in his face.</p>

  <p>"Cut in for a rubber of bridge, old chap?" Andrewes asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know!" Felix answered. "Anything you like."</p>

  <p>A servant from below came up with a letter upon a tray. Felix opened it
  listlessly enough, but as he read his face changed. He sat suddenly up in his
  chair. Something of the old enthusiasm lit up his features.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Andrewes!" he exclaimed. "Listen, Richards! I want to read you
  this letter."</p>

  <p>"It's from one of the three?" Richards exclaimed suddenly.</p>

  <p>"It is," Felix admitted. "It's from the middle-aged man&mdash;the one with
  the iron-gray beard. His name is John Elwick. Listen to what he
  says:"</p><br>

  <p class="letter">33 High Street, Barnet.<br>
  <br>
  Sir: I write you these few lines at last with much misgiving, and yet I
  cannot keep silence any longer.<br>
  <br>
  You will doubtless remember who I am. A year ago you gave me a letter to
  deliver at an address in Kettering. I went there and found that there was no
  such place and no such person. I knew quite well what I ought to do&mdash;to
  go back to you and help you to win your bet. I didn't do it. I will tell you
  the truth. I was very angry. I had had a hard struggle, fighting against
  misfortune year after year. I have a wife, who has been my devoted companion,
  and who on the day I saw you was practically dying of starvation. I thought
  of her. I thought of my long fight against ill luck. And I thought of you,
  with your comfortable life and wealthy friends, to whom the sufferings of
  such as myself had become a jest. Never before had I done a dishonest act,
  but I did one then. I tore open your letter, and found, as I had expected,
  nothing but the two five-pound notes. I went for my wife, and I came to this
  place in search of work. I had had a small drapery business until I lost it
  through no fault of my own, and with your ten pounds I bought a share in a
  very small business in a side street here, from a man who was consumptive and
  could not work it himself.<br>
  <br>
  Now I come to the strange part of this. Once when I was in a situation I
  saved sixty pounds. I bought a business with it, and I worked, I and my poor
  wife, till we were shadows, and it was all in vain. We lost our money, and I
  came to be what I was when you found me. Now, with this ten pounds which I
  stole from you, I made money from the first. Nothing could go wrong with me.
  I have moved three times during these twelve months, into larger premises. My
  wife is restored to health. I am sure now of a living for the rest of my
  days.</p>

  <p class="letter">A week ago, for the first time, I told my wife the truth
  about that ten pounds&mdash;there was a distant relative from whom I had
  sworn that it had come. A few nights ago, as I say, I told her the truth. It
  is she who has made me do this. I send you back your ten pounds, with
  interest, and the address at which I live is at the head of this letter. If
  you think it worth while, you can send me to prison. You know my story, and
  from what I remember of you, you did not look like a man who would be too
  severe upon his fellow creatures. Let me off, sir, and send me a line to set
  our minds at ease. If it is any pleasure for you to know it, that ten pounds
  has been the making of me, and saved my wife's life.<br>
  <br>
  I am, sir,<br>
  Your obedient servant,<br>
  John Elwick.</p><br>

  <p>"What do you think of that?" Felix exclaimed breathlessly.</p>

  <p>Richards laughed. "Well," he said, "I should call it a lucky theft."</p>

  <p>"I don't care what you call it," Felix declared, rising and making his way
  to the writing-table. "I'm thankful now that I made the bet, and I'm thankful
  that I lost it. I shall write and tell the poor fellow so tonight."</p>

  <p>"What about the other two?" Andrewes asked.</p>

  <p>"A young man is in the hall, wishing to see you, sir," the servant who had
  brought up the letter announced.</p>

  <p>Felix went down-stairs. From the first, he had a presentiment as to whom
  it would be. A tall, ungainly figure was waiting in the hall. Felix threw
  open the door of the strangers' room and bade him enter. Then he pulled up
  the blind and shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "what have you come to say?"</p>

  <p>"I've come to see," the boy said sullenly, hanging his head, "whether you
  can't do something for me."</p>

  <p>Felix shook his head slowly. He was an optimist, he had been an enthusiast
  all his days, but there are things which no man can mistake. The boy who
  stood before him bore, in his face and attitude and manner, every sign of
  evil. His hair was close cropped; his speech was sullen, almost defiant; his
  eyes were shifty; his clothes were ragged and untidy.</p>

  <p>"Why should I do anything for you?" Felix asked.</p>

  <p>"Because it was you that made me a thief," the boy answered. "I wasn't
  much of a chap, but I'd never stolen before until you played that silly trick
  on us. I dunno what the other two did. I know I just took out those two
  five-pound notes, and went for having a bit of fun. I'd starved long enough.
  When it had gone I stole more. I've been in prison twice. Give us something,
  guv'nor, to help me along."</p>

  <p>"Until you can find an opportunity to steal again?" Felix asked
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"I'll make a fresh start," the young fellow whined.</p>

  <p>Felix rang the bell. There were limits even to his optimism. "You can go,"
  he said. "I have nothing for you."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Felix knew that he was ruined. He sat in his office, and looked at the
  figures which a sympathetic but plain-spoken accountant had just laid before
  him.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, Mr. Felix," the later said. "There is nothing for it but
  to call a meeting of your creditors at once. I should advise your doing so
  without any delay. Times have been bad, and there has been no one in your
  business who seems to have got a proper grip of things. You have given away a
  great deal more than you could afford, if you will allow me to say
  so&mdash;not only of your money, but of your time and thoughts. The result, I
  am afraid, has been disastrous."</p>

  <p>"If you will come back in an hour, Mr. Malcolm," Felix said, "I will tell
  you exactly what I propose to do."</p>

  <p>Mr. Malcolm took up his hat and went out. As he left the office, a tall
  man pushed his way in, followed by a protesting clerk.</p>

  <p>"I cannot see anyone to-night," Felix said, rising to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You will see me," the newcomer answered. "I shall not keep you long."</p>

  <p>Felix was suddenly silent. It was the third man. He signed to the clerk to
  close the door and leave them.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>The newcomer took a seat. "You remember me?" he said. "My name is John
  Watts."</p>

  <p>"I remember you," Felix answered. "Have you brought me back my ten
  pounds?"</p>

  <p>"It would serve you right," John Watts said slowly, "if you never saw that
  ten pounds again. I am not sure that it would not serve you right if I took
  you by the shoulders and shook you. Do you know that you made a thief of
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I deny it," Felix answered. "I put you to a test, and you failed."</p>

  <p>"It was an unfair test," John Watts said. "Never mind, I made a deliberate
  choice. The fates have been against me all my life, although I had played the
  game straight. I thought I'd try my luck a little differently. I have done
  fairly well," he continued, "and so have you."</p>

  <p>"So have I?" Felix repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes," John Watts answered. "I was an honest thief&mdash;I will say that
  for myself. You and I went into business together over in Mexico. You'll know
  all about it later. We've done well."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Have we?" Felix answered.</p>

  <p>"I put your ten pounds together with my muscle and experience," John Watts
  said, "but where the luck came from God only knows, for I've had the
  wickedest luck of any man that ever breathed&mdash;I should say that we
  had."</p>

  <p>"You are not talking nonsense by any chance, are you?" Felix asked.</p>

  <p>"You may call it nonsense if you like," John Watts said, "but the fact
  remains that you and I are the owners of the Infanta Silver Mine, and if you
  like to take three hundred thousand pounds for your shares, you can have it
  to-morrow. I'm not selling mine."</p>

  <p>"You're mad!" Felix faltered.</p>

  <p>"I'm not nearly so mad as I was at you once," John Watts said, "but I
  think we'd better shake hands and forget it. My lawyer's down at the hotel.
  You'd better put on your hat and come along with me. He'll show you just how
  things are. But first of all, let me ask you this. What became of the other
  two?"</p>

  <p>Felix told him. John Watts nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, after all," he said, "two of us were honest thieves. I'm not sure
  that you didn't win your bet."</p>

  <p>Felix arose with sparkling eyes. "We'll call in at the club and find
  Richards," he declared. "Come on."</p>

  <p>Mr. Philip Letheringcourt, as he stepped out of his electric brougham and
  entered the premises of the London and Westminster Banking Company in Lombard
  Street, had certainly more the air of a man of fashion than of one interested
  in the everyday affairs of City life. He was immaculately dressed, handsome,
  debonair, from the tips of his patent boots to the bunch of violets which
  adorned his button-hole. He entered the bank with the air of one a little
  unaccustomed to his surroundings, and, approaching a vacant spot at the
  counter, drew a cheque from his waistcoat-pocket and carelessly filled it in
  for five hundred pounds.</p>

  <p>"I'd like plenty of ten-pound notes, please," he said, holding it out to
  one of the clerks, "and one fifty."</p>

  <p>The clerk accepted the cheque with a little bow, glanced at the amount,
  and then palpably hesitated.</p>

  <p>"One moment, if you please, Mr. Letheringcourt," he said, turning away.
  "You want this in notes, I understand?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Philip Letheringcourt raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I certainly don't want gold, if that is what you mean," he replied.</p>

  <p>The clerk hastened to a desk at the farther end of the bank and talked for
  a moment to a grey-headed man who sat there apparently entering up a
  ceaseless stream of amounts into a grand ledger. It was clear, even to Philip
  Letheringcourt&mdash;who felt only fairly interested&mdash;that the cheque
  which the clerk held in his hand was the subject of their conversation. The
  elder gentleman took up a telephone which stood by his side and spoke into
  it. When he replaced the receiver he nodded curtly to the clerk, who returned
  to his former place at the desk.</p>

  <p>"One fifty, you said, and plenty of tens, I believe, Mr. Letheringcourt?"
  the latter remarked, beginning to count out the notes.</p>

  <p>"That's right," Letheringcourt answered. "Why did you take the cheque up
  to the old gentleman? You didn't doubt my signature, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least, sir," the man answered, civilly. "By the by, Mr.
  Jarndyse would like to speak to you, if you can spare half a moment."</p>

  <p>"I haven't much time," Letheringcourt remarked, doubtfully. "If it's a
  matter of business, hadn't he better send for Weare? I don't interfere, you
  know, in the financial part of our affairs."</p>

  <p>"I think Mr. Jarndyse would like to see you, sir," the clerk answered, "if
  you can spare half a minute. He is disengaged now, if you will come this
  way." Letheringcourt stuffed the notes into his pocket and followed his guide
  into the private office of the bank manager. Mr. Jarndyse rose to his feet as
  they entered, and motioned the clerk to leave them.</p>

  <p>"Some time since we met, Mr. Letheringcourt," the banker remarked,
  pleasantly. "You do not often favour us with a visit."</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt smiled.</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" he answered. "I leave everything connected with the
  financial conduct of our business to Weare. Your young man said that you
  would like to have a word with me."</p>

  <p>"Just so, Mr. Letheringcourt," the bank manager said. "Sit down for a
  moment, will you?"</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt sat down a little unwillingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can only spare you a moment," he said.</p>

  <p>"I shall not detain you," the bank manager answered. "The fact of it is,
  Mr. Letheringcourt, I was looking into the figures connected with your firm
  this morning. You have, as doubtless you are aware, an authorized overdraft
  with us of twenty-five thousand pounds, against which we hold various
  securities. I find that you are overdrawn at the moment rather more than
  thirty thousand pounds, and that there is a draft of fifty-five thousand
  pounds to Cunliffe and Peabody due to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt looked across at the manager in blank amazement.</p>

  <p><a id="picAW1"

  </div>

  <p>"Really, Mr. Jarndyse," he said, "these are matters in which I never
  interfere at all. I presume that whatever obligations the firm has entered
  into will be duly met."</p>

  <p>"I trust so, Mr. Letheringcourt," the bank manager answered. "At the same
  time I do not think that you should allow matters to be run quite so close.
  If you will pardon my saying so, I think that you ought to keep a stricter
  personal control over the financial side of your business."</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt was a little taken aback.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to imply, Mr. Jarndyse," he said, "that Ambrose Weare is
  not so careful as he ought to be? He has been in our employ for over fifteen
  years, and for the last ten years, at least, he has absolutely controlled our
  finances."</p>

  <p>"I wish to imply nothing," the bank manger answered; "but I do not think
  it is good financing to leave so large a sum as nearly sixty thousand pounds
  to be provided on the very day when the draft is due."</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"I agree with you," he answered. "It doesn't sound exactly the thing. I'll
  speak to Weare about it. Very likely he has a number of bills of exchange
  which he did not wish to discount until the last moment. Bank rate's pretty
  stiff just now, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"There are, no doubt, explanations," the bank manager remarked. "At the
  same time, Mr. Letheringcourt, if you will pardon my saying so, I think that
  you will be well advised to take a little more personal interest in your
  business."</p>

  <p>"Thanks!" Letheringcourt answered, a little curtly. "I'll remember what
  you say."</p>

  <p>He was thoughtful during the drive home; he was thoughtful during the one
  rubber he had time for at the club; and he was even thoughtful over the
  <i>tête-à-tête</i> dinner alone with his wife, for which a series of
  mischances was responsible. Mrs. Letheringcourt, at the conclusion of the
  meal, rose to her feet with a little yawn and strolled to the
  mantle-piece.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she remarked, lighting a cigarette, "a dinner <i>à deux</i>
  doesn't seem to amuse you."</p>

  <p>He sat up with a little start; he had been gazing fixedly at the
  tablecloth, speechless, for the last five minutes.</p>

  <p>"I am awfully sorry, Joan," he said. "I am afraid that you must have
  thought me a perfect bear."</p>

  <p>"Your conversation certainly hasn't been brilliant," she remarked,
  quietly. "Please tell me what it is that you have been thinking about." He
  shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The affairs of Holt and Letheringcourt!" he answered.</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Business?" she repeated. "Well, it isn't very often you allow that to
  trouble you."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," he admitted. "It is very seldom that I think about
  it at all. And yet this afternoon something happened&mdash;just a
  trifle&mdash;which gave me a most unpleasant quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>"Go on," she said. "Tell me about it."</p>

  <p>They were sitting in one of the smaller rooms of their house in Berkeley
  Square, half study, half morning-room. It was an evening on which they had
  planned to dine out and to go to the theatre, but some friends had
  disappointed them, and at the last moment Letheringcourt himself had begged
  for a quiet evening. His wife, always good-natured, had acceded readily
  enough&mdash;it was not often that their social engagements permitted them to
  spend an evening together. A small dinner had been served to them in an
  impromptu fashion.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Philip," she said, "exactly what it is that is bothering
  you."</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt threw away the cigar which had burned out between his
  fingers and lit a cigarette. In a few words he told his wife of his visit to
  the bank that afternoon. When he had finished she looked across at him with
  wide-open eyes.</p>

  <p>"It certainly seems most odd!" she exclaimed. "What did you say to Mr.
  Jarndyse, Philip?"</p>

  <p>"I told him, of course," Letheringcourt continued, "that for a great many
  years Ambrose Weare had had the sole control of the finances of my firm, that
  during all that time no complaint had been made, and that the business
  generally had been exceedingly prosperous. Yet I don't fancy that he was
  satisfied. I didn't like the way he twice advised me to take a more personal
  interest in my own affairs."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that he mistrusts Ambrose Weare?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Such an idea is preposterous," Letheringcourt declared.</p>

  <p>"You believe in him implicitly yourself, then?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Implicitly!" Letheringcourt answered. "The man is as honest as the day. I
  am sure of it."</p>

  <p>"I don't know much about business," his wife said, hesitatingly, "but to
  be thirty thousand pounds overdrawn at your bank and have nearly sixty
  thousand pounds to find the next day doesn't sound exactly comfortable to
  me."</p>

  <p>"I agree with you," her husband answered. "I didn't like it at all."</p>

  <p>"What have you done?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I rang Weare up from the club," Letheringcourt answered, "and asked him
  to come here to-night."</p>

  <p>His wife nodded.</p>

  <p>"He didn't make any difficulties, I suppose?" she asked. "He was willing
  enough to come?"</p>

  <p>"Curiously enough, he wasn't," her husband replied. "He reminded me that
  never during the whole of our association had we transacted any business, or
  spoken of it, after office hours. He added that he personally, during all
  that time, had never set foot west of Temple Bar. He asked me to wait until
  the morning."</p>

  <p>"You insisted upon his coming, I hope?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I did," he answered. "He evidently did not like it, but he agreed to be
  here at half-past nine."</p>

  <p>"What a curious sort of person he must be!" Mrs. Letheringcourt remarked.
  "Tell me, what is he like?"</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"He might have stepped out from some book of Dickens's or Anthony
  Trollope's," he answered. "Trim, grey-headed, old-fashioned, with formal
  manners; always dressed in black, never been known to be sixpence wrong in
  any account in his life. Everyone at the office swears by him."</p>

  <p>"Ambrose Weare!" she remarked. "It's a singular name."</p>

  <p>"He's a singular person," Letheringcourt answered. "I have never heard of
  his having a friend or a relative; no one even knows where he came from! By
  the by, there is someone in the hall now. He is coming up, I believe."</p>

  <p>Joan Letheringcourt picked up her novel.</p>

  <p>"I am going to my room for a little time," she said. "I shall be down
  again&mdash;perhaps before your man has gone. I am rather curious to see
  him."</p>

  <p>She swept out of the room with a little farewell nod&mdash;graceful,
  good-natured, beautiful&mdash;a delightful wife and hostess. Outside, she
  passed with a pleasant smile a little man following a tall footman. The
  little old man started, but she had already gone by. The footman threw open
  the door. "Mr. Ambrose Weare, sir, from the office," he announced.</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt turned in his chair and welcomed his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Come and sit down, Weare," he said. "Will you have a glass of port or
  some coffee? It is your first visit here and I shall expect you to take
  something." The clerk bowed a little stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," he answered. "I am afraid that I must ask you to excuse
  me."</p>

  <p>"As you will," Letheringcourt answered, carelessly. "Sit down there by the
  table, please. There are just one or two questions I wanted to ask you. I am
  sorry to have fetched you up after office hours, but the fact is that I have
  been a little uneasy."</p>

  <p>The footman had left them; the two men were alone. Ambrose Weare was
  certainly a somewhat curious character. His face was white, and dry as
  parchment. His eyes were very bright, although he wore spectacles, and he had
  still an abundance of grey hair neatly parted in the middle. His clothes were
  old-fashioned, considering his position as head cashier of a well-known City
  firm. He wore a frock-coat, pepper-and-salt trousers, a black satin tie which
  resembled a stock, and a collar of ancient shape. He folded his gloves
  deliberately and placed them inside his silk hat. Then he turned towards his
  employer.</p>

  <p>"I have come to answer any questions, sir," he said, "which you may care
  to ask."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am not going to put you through a catechism!" Letheringcourt
  declared. "You know much more about the conduct of the business than I do, of
  course. I will tell you exactly what it is that made me send for you. I
  happened to go into the bank this afternoon, and Jarndyse called me into his
  office. He pointed out that our account was thirty thousand pounds overdrawn,
  and that we had a draft due to-morrow for fifty-five thousand pounds. Of
  course, he didn't doubt but that it would be all right, for a moment, but he
  simply thought that it would be a great deal better not to run things so
  close. I must say that I agreed with him. It didn't seem to me to be exactly
  in accord with your methods, Weare, to leave so large a sum to be covered on
  the actual day."</p>

  <p>Ambrose Weare inclined his head slowly. His fingers were interlocked. He
  was leaning a little across the table.</p>

  <p>"There is not the slightest chance, sir," he said, "of its being
  covered!"</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt looked at him for a moment as a man might look at a
  visitant from another world. It was impossible that Ambrose Weare should have
  said this. His hearing must have played him some strange trick.</p>

         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"Do you mind repeating that, Weare?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," the clerk answered. "I regret to say that there is not
  the faintest chance of Messrs. Cunliffe and Peabody's draft for fifty-five
  thousand pounds being honoured to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt sat like a man only half conscious of his surroundings.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," he said. "Do you mean to tell me that we are short
  of money, Weare?&mdash;that there is any real difficulty about meeting our
  engagements?"</p>

  <p>"We are very short indeed, sir," the clerk answered. "We have been very
  short for a long time. The financing of your business has been an exceedingly
  difficult operation during the last few years. I must admit that the task has
  now grown beyond me."</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt grasped the sides of his chair and looked around him
  wildly. For a moment he thought that he had fallen asleep and been visited by
  a nightmare. Everything else about him was as usual. There were all the
  evidences on every side of his luxurious home. And in the midst of it sat
  this strange, still figure&mdash;the Ambrose Weare whom he had known all
  these years, and yet&mdash;another man!</p>

  <p>"If this is a joke," Letheringcourt exclaimed, hoarsely, "it's a&mdash;a
  bad one! Do you know what you're saying, Weare? You should know your place
  better&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know it far too well," the man interrupted, "to joke upon such a
  subject. Your firm, sir&mdash;the firm of Holt, Letheringcourt, and
  Company&mdash;has been losing money for something like twelve years. Chiefly
  owning to my efforts, your credit has remained unimpaired. It is impossible,
  however, to preserve it any longer. To-morrow the crisis comes!"</p>

  <p>"You must be mad!" Letheringcourt exclaimed, rising unsteadily to his
  feet. "Why, no one has ever breathed a word of this to me! You yourself have
  said nothing! Year by year you have brought me into my private office
  balance-sheets showing large profits. Last year you told me that we had made
  seventeen thousand pounds. I have been extravagant, but I have not spent
  money like this. What has become of it? Where is all this money? Our capital
  stood at one hundred and seventy thousand pounds seven years ago."</p>

  <p>"It is all gone," Ambrose Weare said, calmly. "Perhaps it was never as
  much as that."</p>

  <p>"But the balance-sheets!" Letheringcourt exclaimed&mdash;"the
  balance-sheets! You have brought them to me year by year. Not one has ever
  shown a loss."</p>

  <p>"They were made out, alas," Ambrose Weare answered, "from the ledger of my
  imagination."</p>

  <p>"In plain words, then," Letheringcourt cried, "we are ruined!&mdash;we
  have to fail! Is that what you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely!" Ambrose Weare declared. "I have not the figures with me, but
  I believe that we could not, at the moment, pay a fraction more than two
  shillings in the pound."</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt swayed upon his feet. Then he leaned forward and struck the
  table before which the other man was sitting.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" he said, fiercely, "if you are in earnest, answer me this.
  Why have you deceived me, year by year, with false balance-sheets? Why have
  you let me believe that the business was making large profits? Why have you
  even urged me to spend money&mdash;placed sums to my private account, time
  after time, which I scarcely needed? Tell me why you have done these things,
  Ambrose Weare?"</p>

  <p>"It is a long story," the clerk answered, calmly.</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt broke loose. Nothing but the sense of his own great
  strength and the other man's fail physique prevented his taking him by the
  throat and shaking the words from his lips.</p>

  <p>"Long or short," he cried, "I must have it! Do you know what you have
  done? For the last ten years I have spent something like fifteen or sixteen
  thousand pounds a year, believing honestly that I was living within my
  income. I saved not a penny. Why should I? I knew nothing of the business
  myself. I have no idea how to do even a clerk's work. What am I to do? What
  am I to say to my wife?"</p>

  <p>Ambrose Weare rose slowly to his feet. There was something almost
  spectral-like about his long, grey figure as he stood there, leaning slightly
  forward, his manner unruffled, his tone still calm and even.</p>

  <p>"You have no wife!" he said.</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt stared at him for a moment and then burst out laughing.
  After all, perhaps this was the explanation.</p>

  <p>"You're mad!" he exclaimed&mdash;"mad or drunk, Weare! What is the matter
  with you, man? Has your mind given way?"</p>

  <p>"I am sane enough," Ambrose Weare answered. "Better pray that you remain
  so. I repeat&mdash;you have no wife."</p>

  <p>There was the sound of a trailing skirt. The door was softly opened. Joan
  Letheringcourt, humming a light tune, came in.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she said, "have you nearly finished your talk? Shall I be in the
  way? I am tired of being alone."</p>

  <p>"Yes, come in!" Letheringcourt answered. "Come here, Joan. Now tell me,
  Ambrose Weare," he added, pointing to his wife, who was crossing the room
  toward the two men, "who is that lady if she is not my wife?"</p>

  <p>"She is mine!" Ambrose Weare answered, calmly.</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt took him by the shoulders, lifted him up, and finding him
  as helpless as a baby flung him back into his chair. His wife ran forward
  with a little scream.</p>

  <p>"Philip!" she cried. "Philip! What is the meaning of this? Who is this
  person? Why does he say these things?"</p>

  <p><a id="picAW3"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"God knows!" Letheringcourt answered. "For fifteen years he has called
  himself Ambrose Weare. If all that he has told me is true, I should say that
  he is the very Devil himself! Look at him, Joan. Have you seen him
  before?"</p>

  <p>She bent forward, scanning his features eagerly. Ambrose Weare was pale
  and breathless, but he had strength enough left to rise to his feet. There
  was still no colour in his cheeks, no sign of emotion save the breath which
  came in little pants through his clenched teeth.</p>

  <p>"Let her look!" he said. "Let her look! Perhaps she will understand."</p>

  <p>There was an instant's breathless silence. Then her eyes seemed to be lit
  with a sudden, strange fear. She staggered back, holding her hands in front
  of her face as though to shut out some awful sight. She, too, was pale now.
  She, too, had the air of one who looks upon terrible things.</p>

  <p>"No!" she cried. "No; it can't&mdash;it couldn't be!"</p>

  <p>"Madam," Ambrose Weare said, "The impossible has happened. You have
  believed what you wished to believe&mdash;that the Nicholas Seton who died at
  St. Thomas's Hospital sixteen years ago was the man to whom you had been
  married. It was not so. I am Nicholas Seton, and, whatever you may call
  yourself, you are still my wife."</p>

  <p>She shrank away to a corner of the sofa and sat there, sobbing quietly,
  pale, stricken, absolutely dazed. All the time she was muttering to herself.
  All the time she kept her back to the man who had told her this terrible
  thing.</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt staggered toward the side-board and poured himself out some
  brandy. Then he came back and stood by the table, looking down upon the other
  man.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "let us understand this matter. You are the Ambrose Weare
  who came to my firm as a cashier fifteen years ago whilst I was at college.
  My father trusted you implicitly; my uncle trusted you. When they were dead
  and I came into the business I found you all-powerful. There wasn't a clerk
  or a manager in the place who didn't speak of you with respect. I have
  believed in you&mdash;I have believed in the figures you have shown me; I
  have thought myself always a rich man. Now you sit there and tell me that
  your connection from the first with the firm has been one long tissue of lies
  and deceit. Why? What is the meaning of it all? Why has it pleased you to
  keep silent&mdash;to drive me on towards ruin?"</p>

  <p>The man turned half round and pointed towards the woman who sat still upon
  the sofa. He pointed with long, trembling forefinger; but he said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"I have done you no harm," Letheringcourt cried.</p>

  <p>"She was my wife," Ambrose Weare answered.</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt was a strong man, and he kept sane.</p>

  <p>"Even if this horrible thing were true," he said, "why should you seek to
  revenge yourself upon me? You deserted her. She had every reason to believe
  that you were dead. When I first knew her she told me of her former marriage.
  She honestly believed you dead."</p>

  <p>"It is a lie!" Ambrose Weare said, slowly. "She saw luxury, and she
  stretched out her hand to grasp it. She took her risks. Things have gone her
  way for a good many years. I wrote to her. I told her that I would return
  when I had earned enough to keep her and the child in comfort. Her father
  hated me because I was poor. He allowed them enough to live on so long as I
  was out of the way."</p>

  <p>"I had no letter," she sobbed. "If it came, my father destroyed it. He
  swore always that you had ruined my life&mdash;you knew that."</p>

  <p>"So it is for these fancied wrongs that you have set yourself to ruin me!"
  Letheringcourt said, bitterly. "Well, there shall be a reckoning yet. If my
  money has gone as you say, where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Safe," Ambrose Weare muttered, "in Paris, in Frankfort, in New
  York&mdash;a thousand or so here, a thousand or so there. For twelve years I
  have stripped the business. There is little enough now left for anyone except
  the bones. She left me once because I was poor," he cried, pointing to the
  woman who sat shivering upon the sofa. "To-day I am rich, if I choose, and
  you are a beggar!"</p>

  <p>Letheringcourt laughed harshly. He touched the telephone which stood on
  the table by his side.</p>

  <p>"Do you imagine," he said, "that I shall let you go scot-free? Do you
  imagine that I shall ever let you leave this room?"</p>

  <p>"It makes no difference," the clerk answered. "I tell you to your face
  that I have robbed you, but I am the only one who knows. There are no books,
  no papers to prove it. On the contrary, there are bundles of accounts in the
  safe which I shall swear have been submitted to you year by year, and which
  show a steady loss. Those which it has been necessary to destroy I shall
  swear that you destroyed. You know you told me not long ago that I was the
  Napoleon of figures. It is true. I have used them like soldiers, and they
  have won my battle!"</p>

  <p>Some new thing seemed to have come into Letheringcourt's face. Those of
  his friends who had known him for the last ten years might almost have failed
  to have recognised him now. At heart he was a man. He stood looking down at
  the thin, frail figure at the table with a curiosity almost impersonal.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said, grimly, "that I can stand here and listen to you. I
  wonder I don't shake the life from your miserable bones. In all the world
  there cannot breathe a creature so despicable as you! You deserted your
  wife&mdash;you let her believe that you were dead," he added, pointing to the
  figure upon the sofa. "What kind of a creature can you be to bear an eternal
  grudge against me because I have tried to make her happy?"</p>

  <p>"There was the child," Ambrose Weare said, and for the first time his
  thin, precise tone seemed to shake. "She deserted him."</p>

  <p>The hands fell away from before her face. She looked across the room with
  blazing eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is a lie!" she answered. "My husband has been as good a father to him
  as ever man could be. He is at Rugby now, captain of the school. Look!"</p>

  <p>She sprang to her feet, and taking a photograph from the mantelpiece, she
  laid it on the table before him. Ambrose Weare staggered to his feet. He was
  like a man who has received a blow, but still withholds belief in the thing
  which he has heard.</p>

  <p>"Look!" she cried again. "There is Nicholas! Don't you recognize him?
  Won't you believe now? He was going into the Army, and now, and now&mdash;"
  She sobbed.</p>

  <p>Ambrose Weare took the photograph and turned his back upon them both. For
  a few moments there was nothing to be heard in the room but the ticking of
  the clock. Then there was another sound&mdash;the sound of a dry, hard sob.
  Ambrose Weare laid down the photograph and took up his carefully-brushed silk
  hat and gloves. There was no sign of emotion in his face. It seemed
  impossible that the sob could have come from him. He turned as though in
  farewell to Letheringcourt. His manner was once more the manner of the
  confidential clerk of fifteen years' service.</p>

  <p>"There has been a mistake," he said. "You will be so kind, sir, as to
  overlook my rash statements. I have thought it better for the interests of
  the firm to invest large sums of money abroad. You will find the particulars
  here," he added, laying a roll of papers upon the table. "There are one
  hundred and forty thousand pounds invested in European banks, and nearly
  sixty thousand in New York. You can obtain credit to-morrow by cabling. You
  will excuse me, sir, if I hurry away? There is a little matter&mdash;a little
  matter left."</p>

  <p>He was at the door before they could stop him. Husband and wife looked at
  one another in fear and wonder. The shadow of this terrible thing was still
  between them&mdash;the man who had left the room&mdash;Ambrose Weare, her
  husband!</p>

  <p>"In God's name," she cried, "what can we do?"</p>

  <p>From outside came the answer to her question. They heard the shot, the
  sound of a fall, the hurrying of servants. They did not need to be told! A
  white-faced footman threw open the door.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman who has just left, sir!" he exclaimed, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Letheringcourt asked.</p>

  <p>"He has shot himself in the hall, sir," the man answered. "He is
  dead!"</p>

    He held his breath. The man on the piazza had moved.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="first">"Of all the absurd proceedings, Dick," the woman said,
  yawning, "I think that this is absolutely the maddest I ever heard of. For
  heaven's sake, be reasonable and tell me why you have dragged me out of bed
  before sunrise to bring me to this scene of desolation."</p>

  <p>The man shipped his oars and, jumping from the boat, pulled it up on to
  the bench. Then he held out his hand to the woman.</p>

  <p>"If you will allow me," he said quietly, "I think that you can land now
  without wetting your feet."</p>

  <p>"But why on earth should I land at all?" she asked impatiently, "Why have
  you brought me to this wilderness of a place? Do you expect me to play Man
  Friday to your Robinson Crusoe?"</p>

  <p>He held out his hand again&mdash;a little insistently.</p>

  <p>"With your permission," he said, "I will offer you an explanation when you
  are landed. I do not think that a sea bath would be altogether&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She jumped lightly out&mdash;a very dainty person, indeed, and not at all
  inclined to spoil her white flannel dress and trim patent leather shoes by
  the immersion which seemed imminent. He secured the boat and quietly lit a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"We will sit here," he said, motioning her to a flat rock, and, contrary
  to her custom, she obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have taken the liberty of bringing you here," he said, "in order to
  secure an undisturbed <i>tête-à-tête</i> with you."</p>

  <p>"Really," she murmured, "you might have been more considerate."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," he answered coolly. "The hour after breakfast belongs,
  believe, to Major Duncan. Then there is your game of shuffleboard with
  Ellison, with which, I believe, nothing is allowed to interfere, and Forsyth
  is invariably waiting to claim you directly afterward. After luncheon Duncan,
  I believe, reads to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that will do," she interrupted, looking at him curiously. "You desire
  a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with me, and you have secured it in a somewhat original
  manner. I am waiting to bear what you have to say."</p>

  <p>He nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said, "you shall hear. We have been married five years, I
  think, Louise?"</p>

  <p>"What a memory!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"From the third day of our honeymoon until today," he continued coolly, "I
  have apparently shared your society&mdash;that is, if I can be said to have
  shared it at all&mdash;with a long array of admirers in, whose number there
  may have been safety, but whose continual presence&mdash;you must forgive
  me&mdash;I have found a little bewildering. Don't misunderstand me, I make no
  serious charge against you. Only I am weary&mdash;weary to death of seeing
  you day after day monopolized by whatever good-looking or interesting man may
  be around."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"You are&mdash;jealous?" ?</p>

  <p>He looked steadily at the yacht moored a little way out in the bay.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "perhaps I am. At any rate, I have brought you here to
  explain exactly how I feel and to ask you whether you are disposed to make a
  clean sweep of the whole thing. I am weary of seeing other men hang over your
  chair and offer you the attentions of a lover. I propose to land them all at
  Newton and take you for a cruise alone. Do you agree?"</p>

  <p>"My dear man," she exclaimed, "you are joking!"</p>

  <p>"I was never," he assured her, "more in earnest in my life."</p>

  <p>"You mean it&mdash;seriously?"</p>

  <p>"Subject to your consent, I mean it seriously."</p>

  <p>"It is absurd," she answered. "We should be bored to death &mdash;both of
  us."</p>

  <p>For a moment he seemed to wince, but he recovered himself almost
  Immediately. His tone was a shade colder perhaps&mdash;a certain almost
  imperceptible nervousness had passed from his manner.</p>

  <p>"Ah," he saId, "there is always that possibility, of course. Nevertheless,
  Louise," he continued, turning slowly toward her. "I feel that I have played
  the part of complaisant husband long enough. I am sick of your affairs and
  your followers. I propose to end it."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly, yet a little uneasily. She studied him for a moment.
  Really he was almost good looking, A certain amount of grimness became him.
  She smoothed her skirts over her knees and, suddenly looking up, laughed in
  his face.</p>

  <p>"And how," she asked, "do you propose to accomplish the miracle?"</p>

  <p>"Stand up," he said. "I want to show you something."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet, and her eyes followed his outstretched forefinger.
  On the slope of a slight eminence was a long, one-story house, built of wood,
  with a veranda thrown out toward the sea.</p>

  <p>"Why, I thought that the place was uninhabited!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"It is," he answered, "save for the man and woman who look after that
  shanty for me."</p>

  <p>"For you?"</p>

  <p>"For me. I should explain that the island belongs to me. I bought it for a
  mere song a few years ago for the sake of the sea bird shooting."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" she remarked. "I had no idea that your possessions were so
  extensive."</p>

  <p>"The place is a stony waste," he said. "It did not cost me so much as the
  simplest of the jewels which have the privilege of adorning your person every
  evening."</p>

  <p>She was a little uneasy. He was talking in a manner which was strange to
  her.</p>

  <p>"I still," she said, "do not understand why you have brought me here. And,
  see, there is another boat putting out from the yacht What is it, I
  wonder?"</p>

  <p>"It is your luggage," he answered, "your maid has packed everything you
  are likely to want"</p>

  <p>She looked at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"My luggage! What on earth for?"</p>

  <p>"You are going to stay here for a little time," he said coolly.</p>

  <p>"I am going to stay here!" she repeated, "is this a ghastly joke, Dick? I
  never heard anything so absurd in my life."</p>

  <p>"You are going to stay here," he repeated steadily. "You will. And the
  bungalow fairly comfortable, and Peters and his wife are very civil people.
  I'm landing your friends this afternoon at Port Newton on account of your
  sudden indisposition. They will believe you to be in your cabin."</p>

  <p>She burst into a fit of uncontrollable yet not altogether natural
  laughter. She was in reality in a state bordering on hysterics.</p>

  <p>"A delightful scheme!" she cried. "You and I alone in a
  paradise&mdash;such a paradise!" with a little wave of her white hand. "Dick,
  you must be mad!"</p>

  <p>"You mistake me," he answered quietly. "I am not proposing to inflict my
  company on you."</p>

  <p>"Alone! Am I to be left here alone?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he agreed, rising to his feet. "Now listen to me,
  Louise."&mdash;</p>

  <p>He stood over her, and the lines about his mouth were hard and merciless.
  He was tall, well over six feet, and she suddenly remembered that she had
  always admired tall men.</p>

  <p>"You will be dull here," he said, "in a certain way. So far as the
  capacity lies In you, you will suffer. Yet I would have you remember this:
  All your little pains and weariness will never amount to anything compared
  with the torture with which you have blackened my days. I married you for
  love. The misfortune is that I must love you for all time. I have done what I
  could to make you happy. It is obvious that I have failed. You see, I am
  frank with you. I hate the sight of the men who accept my hospitality and
  think it sport to make love to my wife before my eyes. I choose to end it in
  this fashion. After a time I shall come or send for you. For the present,
  goodbye!"</p>

  <p>He turned away to escape the outburst which he regarded as inevitable. To
  his surprise, she did not speak. Her silence unnerved him. He lingered and
  looked behind. She was still sitting on the rock, and her face was
  inscrutable.</p>

  <p>"I think you have said goodbye," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Your luggage is there upon the beach," he said, and Peters and his wife
  are waiting on the balcony. They will come down directly we have all gone.
  You will find them very decent people. I hope&mdash;that you will be
  comfortable."</p>

  <p>It was very lame, but the unexpectedness of her manner confused him
  altogether. Suddenly she held out her hand and raised those wonderful eyes to
  his. There was the ghost of a smile upon her lips, but her manner was quite
  serious.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind shaking hands?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He set his teeth hard and slowly retraced his steps. For the storm of
  tears and passionate anger which he had expected he was prepared. This was
  different&mdash;far worse. He took the little hand in his, and then, suddenly
  bending over her, he kissed her passionately on the lips. Then he hurried
  away, steeling himself all the while against the appeal which never came. He
  looked back from the boat. She was still sitting upon the rock, a strange and
  somewhat desolate object, her face still turned seaward. She waved her hand
  to him. He bent over his oars and groaned. Louise as she rose to her feet and
  shook out her skirts was in a curious mood. She had expected to be furiously
  angry. She was intensely surprised to find herself on the brink of tears. She
  watched the two boats until they were out of sight, and then she walked
  aimlessly along the beach toward her trunks. A tall, stalwart man had already
  taken possession of them. He touched his cap awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"I'm taking your things up right along, ma'am," he said. "My missis is
  waiting to see to them for you. She was a lady's maid before we were married,
  and I'm sure we'll do our best to make you comfortable, though it's a
  roughish sort of a place for them as aren't used to it"</p>

  <p>Louise nodded absently.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very&gt; much," she said. "You can tell your wife to unpack all
  she can and get me some breakfast."</p>

  <p>Like a good many other people who have never known what solitude means,
  Louise found the first few days almost refreshing in their complete novelty.
  She read and slept and walked&mdash; and finally yawned. At the end of a week
  she was bored.</p>

  <p>Then the wonderful thing happened. She was awakened one morning by the
  sound of guns. She jumped out of bed and, throwing on a dressing gown,
  stepped on to the piazza. A strange yacht was in the bay. Below, in a
  sheltered spot near the beach some men were busy erecting a couple of tents.
  Louise dressed hastily and went outside. Peters was there, looking at the
  yacht in amazement.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean, Peters?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea, ma'am," he answered. "I was just going down to see."</p>

  <p>"We will go together," Louise said.</p>

  <p>On the beach three or four sailors were busy erecting a tent Another man
  was bending over an oil cooking stove. There were several others standing
  about with guns under their arms. Louise stood upon a hillock, looking down.
  She raised her voice and addressed them.</p>

  <p>"May I ask what you arc doing here? You are perhaps not aware that this
  island is private property?"</p>

  <p>A dozen faces were turned toward her in blank amazement. Then several caps
  were furtively raised. A tall, dark man in tweed shooting clothes and gaiters
  moved a step forward.</p>

  <p>"We are really extremely sorry." he said. "We understood that the island
  was uninhabited. Mr. Curtels, to whom it belongs, I believe, gave us
  permission to shoot here."</p>

  <p>"Did Mr. Curtels know that you were coming just now?" Louise added, with a
  faint smile at the corners of her lips.</p>

  <p>"I must admit that he did not" the spokesman of the party answered. "It
  was about this time last year that I told him we thought of yachting In these
  waters, and he gave me permission then to land here at any time I chose. My
  name is Lord Willerton. May I ask whom I have the pleasure of
  addressing?"</p>

  <p>"I am Mrs. Curtels," Louise answered. "If my husband gave you permission
  to come here, that is, of course, quite sufficient. I have often heard him
  speak of you, Lord Willerton. lsn't that&mdash;why, how do you do, Mr.
  Hammersly?"</p>

  <p>A tall, fair-haired young man suddenly started forward with outstretched
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Why. Mrs. Curtels," he exclaimed, "you surely cannot blame any of us for
  not recognizing you for the moment! Who would have expected to find you
  here?"</p>

  <p>Louise smiled upon them all very sweetly,</p>

  <p>"I suppose it la rather surprising," she remarked. "You see, I was a
  little bored, and I am trying the antidote of complete solitude."</p>

  <p>"We have come then, I am afraid, to spoil the cure," Lord Willerton said,
  with a smile. "Perhaps, after all, we shall be on the way. Say the word. Mrs
  Curtels, and we will strike our tents and pack up." "It is not, she murmured.
  "in the least necessary. I think&mdash; in fact, I am sure," she added with a
  smile&mdash;"that I am very glad to see you all. Won't you let that nasty,
  smelly stove alone and come and have breakfast with me?"</p>

  <p>Willerton, who had been eying the stove with some apprehension, breathed a
  sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," he said, "if you are in earnest we will come with
  pleasure. But there are five of us."</p>

  <p>"I think," Louise answered, with a smile, "that Mrs. Peters can find us
  enough to eat."</p>

  <p>She led the way to the bungalow, Willerton and Hammersly on either side.
  Several times she laughed&mdash;quite irrelevantly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Curtels himself was suffering from a most profound dejection and weariness
  of spirits. London was empty, his club a desert Wherever he went he carried
  with him the memory of that wan little figure perched so daintily upon the
  rock in the midst of that island of desolation. Perhaps, after all, his
  scheme would only make things worse. She would never forgive him. He
  shuddered at the thought&mdash;he, who at that moment was hungering for a
  sight of her, the touch of her fingers, her lips, the sound of her voice. In
  a week the time which he had fixed would be up. In a week he would know his
  fate.</p>

  <p>A man came in, bronzed and sunburnt, who greeted him cheerily. Curtels at
  that moment was glad to see anybody.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Robertson?" he said. "Been up north?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer, who was settling himself down in an easy-chair, shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I've been yachting with Willerton and Hammersly. By the bye, when I left
  them they were just off to some desert island of yours, up in the North Sea
  somewhere, to shoot gray geese."</p>

  <p>The paper which Curtels bad been holding slipped through his fingers He
  leaned a little forward in his chair.</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;how long ago&mdash;when did you leave them?"</p>

  <p>"Tuesday week," Robertson answered. "They were within a day's steam of the
  place then."</p>

  <p>Curtels moistened his lips. They seemed unaccountably dry.</p>

  <p>"Willerton and Hammersly," he said hoarsely. "Who else?"</p>

  <p>"Franks and Appleby and a chap of no particular account&mdash; I've
  forgotten his name," Robertson answered, looking curiously over the top of
  his paper at Curtels. "Rather a warm lot. I'm not a prig, but I found them
  just a little too advanced for my taste. Willerton showed up shockingly in
  that Wardlaw suit."</p>

  <p>Curtels left the room abruptly. In the hall he sent a telegram to the
  captain of his yacht. In an hour he was on his way north.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"Let's turn in," Hammersly said, yawning. "It's evidently no good waiting
  for Willerton. He's up spooning the little Curtels woman, and Lord knows what
  that'll lead to!"</p>

  <p>"What's that?" one of the other men asked, suddenly sitting up.</p>

  <p>They all listened. The measured beat of oars came to them through the
  darkness. A moment later they heard the scrunching of a boat's keel on the
  beach. Hammersly pointed to a light about half a tulle out.</p>

  <p>"There's a yacht anchored there." he remarked: "must have come in since it
  got dark. I wonder who on earth it can be. I hope it isn't Curtels," he went
  on nervously. "Willerton's making a perfect ass of himself with that little
  woman."</p>

  <p>They heard the sound of footsteps on the beach. A man was passing the camp
  on his way to the bungalow. Hammersly sprang up.</p>

  <p>"If it's Curtels," he muttered, "there'll be murder. Hello there!" he
  shouted. "Who's that?"</p>

  <p>The footsteps stopped at once. Hammersly lit the two lanterns which hung
  from the tent poles They burned steadily in the windless air, and almost
  immediately a dark figure stepped lute the little circle of light.</p>

  <p>"Curtels, by all that's amazing," Hammersly exclaimed, with well-assumed
  heartiness. "Johnson, bring out the whisky and four glasses."</p>

  <p>Curtels shook his head. His eyes were traveling round the little circle as
  though seeking for some one.</p>

  <p>"You are perfectly welcome here," he said shortly. "By the bye, where's
  Willerton?"</p>

  <p>Hammersly also glanced around carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Somewhere about," he answered. "I fancy he's turned in. I heard him say
  that he was very tired."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Hammersly's heart sank, for in the dim light
  he watched the sudden blaze in his questioner's eyes&mdash;heard the quick,
  sobbing breath which kept him speechless. Then Curtels moved a step forward,
  and the words seemed to leap from his lips&mdash;quick, tense things.</p>

  <p>"Show me Willerton's tent."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," Hammersly drawled, "don't disturb him at this hour of
  night. I remember now that he was complaining of a headache."</p>

  <p>"Stand out of the way!"</p>

  <p>Hammersly was whizzed backward, for Curtels was a strong man and Hammersly
  little more than a boy. He caught up one of the lanterns and lifted the flap
  of each tent. Then, without a word, he dashed the lantern upon the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"If you dare to follow me," he said to Hammersly, "you or any of the
  others, I will shoot you like a dog."</p>

  <p>The bungalow was sheltered from the wind by a grassy knoll. Curtels,
  though every drop of blood in his body went tingling through his veins in a
  wild fever, walked stealthily and finally sank on his knees. He was within a
  few feet of the broad piazza, and there, pressed against the side of the
  wall, his straining eyes saw plainly the figure of a man.</p>

  <p>She was very dear to him. this dainty little woman, with her endearing
  ways, her delicate mannerisms, her quaint, almost wistful beauty. And it was
  his fault harm had come to her&mdash;­ his own stupendous folly. He
  remembered his courtship, all the shyness of her wonderful girlhood,
  afterward the admiration she had everywhere excited, the burden of his own
  silence and aching heart. He ought to have been frank with her, have taken
  her into his arms and pleaded for the old days together. And now there had
  come the agony of this moment&mdash;this moment of dumb, midnight silence,
  broken only by the low thunder of the sea rolling in upon the stones below.
  Curtels felt his self-possession going. He must call out. In a
  moment&mdash;</p>

  <p>He held his breath. The man on the piazza had moved. He was tapping upon
  the window, which all the while had remained dark and unresponsive. Still
  silence. The man leaned over and tapped again. Curtels' finger-nails were
  buried in the soft ground, and there was blood upon his lips. A blind bad
  been drawn up. The window was open. Louise stood there, a slim white
  figure.</p>

         title="The Subjection of Louise">
  </div>

  <p>"Who is that?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>Willerton laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"At last" he murmured, stepping forward. "Louise!"</p>

  <p>His arm touched her, but she evaded him.</p>

  <p>"You, Lord Willerton! How dare you come here? How dare you knock at my
  window?"</p>

  <p>The man's hot whisper came like the muffled singing of a night insect to
  Curtels' ears:</p>

  <p>"A man dares a great deal, Louise, for the woman he loves. All these days
  you have been cruel to me. You will not speak to me alone. I could not sleep
  and think that you were here, only a few yards off. I had to come."</p>

  <p>"You knocked at my window?to tell me this!"</p>

  <p>His voice sank so low that Curtels caught only the passionate murmur of
  his pleading tones. He tried to take her into his arms. For the third time
  she stepped back.</p>

  <p>"Lord Willerton," she said, "you talk about a man daring a great deal for
  the woman he loves. You have dared a good deal indeed, but it is I who am to
  pay. Do your friends know where you are? What do they think?"</p>

  <p>"They think that I have gone for a stroll. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Liar! Coward!" she exclaimed, leaning suddenly toward him. "Listen! You
  and your friends will leave this island before sunrise tomorrow. Go!"</p>

  <p>She would have slammed the window, but he caught it.</p>

  <p>"No. by heavens, I won't!" he exclaimed, suddenly thrusting his hand upon
  her mouth. I&mdash;Good Cod, Louise!</p>

  <p>There was a sharp report, a puff of smoke, and he sprang back with a
  little cry of terror. Louise stood once more in the window, and the steel of
  a revolver glittered in her hand.</p>

  <p>"I am not quite foolish enough," she said quietly, "to open nay window to
  such a man as you without being prepared to defend myself. You and your
  friends wondered the other day why I practiced with my revolver for half an
  hour a day. Now you know."</p>

  <p>Lord Willerton had at least breeding.</p>

  <p>"Madam. I congratulate your husband," he said. "I perceive that you are in
  earnest. You have deceived&mdash;a good many people."</p>

  <p>He turned and walked into Curtels' arms.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Curtels strode into the little camp and flung upon the
  ground a soft, groaning burden.</p>

  <p>"I've brought you Willerton back," he said shortly. "Don't speak to me,
  Hammersly. If I find a single one of you on this island after sunrise
  tomorrow morning I'll shoot you without further warning."</p>

  <p>He wandered on to the seashore and sat upon the rock where only a few
  weeks ago he had expounded his miserable scheme to her. There were faint
  signs of coming dawn across the waters. A chilly wind had sprung up, and he
  shivered. Suddenly he started. Louise, hatless, but with a great fur mantle
  wrapped around her, was sitting by his side.</p>

  <p>"I don't think much of your experiment, Dick," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>He was so staggered by her presence that for the moment he was speechless.
  Then something in the faint smile with which she was regarding him loosened
  his tongue.</p>

  <p>"Louise!" he exclaimed, "you can't forgive me! Oh, you never can! I have
  been the biggest brute in the world."</p>

  <p>"I might try," she murmured. "I have learned one thing, at
  least&mdash;that a husband can be a very useful person. Did you hurt him very
  much. Dick?"</p>

  <p>"He is alive," he answered.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I like&mdash;other men quite so much, Dick," she whispered,
  nestling up to him. "Don't dare ever to boast about your experiment, but I
  think&mdash;if you would carry me up to the bungalow; my slippers are cut all
  to pieces on these rocks, and I am very cold&mdash;I might try&mdash;I might
  try, I said&mdash;Oh, Dick!"</p>

  <p class="first">"I SAY, aren't we going on to Bushey at all?"</p>

  <p>The boy stirred his head, lazy, yet impatient.</p>

  <p>"Why should we?" he asked. "We won't find a better place than this."</p>

  <p>The girl was apparently disappointed.</p>

  <p>"A young lady in our room was there last week and said that the chestnuts
  were glorious," she announced.</p>

  <p>"Think of the crowds!" he murmured, half-closing his eyes. "We have it
  almost to ourselves here."</p>

  <p>The girl looked around with an air of mild discontent. Her back was
  against the trunk of an ancient oak. Her companion was stretched upon the
  ground by her side with his head in her lap. Their clothes, bicycles, and the
  fact that they had so disposed themselves within a few yards of one of the
  roads leading through Richmond Park sufficiently proclaimed their status.
  They were the toilers whom the June sunshine had drawn out from the hidden
  places of the great city.</p>

  <p>"I have never known it so quiet here on a fine Sunday," the girl
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"So much the better," the youth muttered. "Heavens! Don't we see enough of
  our fellow-creatures and hear their voice often enough six days in the week?
  It's a treat to hear something else&mdash;the wind in the leaves and the
  grasses, and the singing of the birds."</p>

  <p>The subject was manifestly one which, if argued, might lead to
  misunderstandings. The girl stifled a yawn and changed her position a little,
  as though cramped. The boy, flat on his back, his hands pressed deep down in
  the cool grass, looked upward through the green leaves to the sky, dotted all
  over with little fleecy specks of white clouds.</p>

  <p>"Cant you feel the quiet of it?" he asked. "No hum of machinery, no
  foreman rushing about the place to know when that work will be finished. I
  wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short. The frown upon his forehead deepened. He changed his
  position so that he could see into the pale, anaemic face of the girl with
  whom he sat.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what we do it for?" he remarked, curiously.</p>

  <p>"Do what?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Make bond-slaves of ourselves," he answered. "Ten hours a day for me, and
  nearly as much for you, and I don't suppose that my engineer's shop is a much
  livelier place than your dressmaker's room. One day's peace, of a sort, and
  six days with both feet upon the mill. What do we do it for, Agnes?"</p>

  <p>"To live," she answered, with a hard little laugh. "Do you suppose I'd
  stand a single hour of the life if I hadn't got to?"</p>

  <p>The boy was answered, but unsatisfied. He looked away from his companion,
  but the frown remained deep-graven upon his face.</p>

  <p>"To live!" he repeated. "I'm not so sure. It seems to me that we do it so
  that other people may live. It isn't for ourselves we work&mdash;it's for the
  others."</p>

  <p>"I work for fourteen shillings a week," the girl said, bluntly.</p>

  <p>The boy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You don't," he declared. "You work so that the woman who employs you, and
  who calls herself a modiste, and has a flat in town and a little cottage up
  the river, can get all there is to be got out of life. You are one of the
  parts of the machine, and so am I. I think that we are foolish."</p>

  <p>"What would you do?" the girl asked, curiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he answered. "I haven't thought about it."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't bother," the girl said.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are satisfied with your life," he went on, pulling out a
  handful of grass and throwing it from him. "I'm not. Three times last week I
  thought of things which improved the working of the room. I reckoned it out
  on the back of an old envelope. Someone must have made pounds and pounds by
  my idea. I altered one of our filing machines on Monday, and it's done its
  work a lot better since. What do I get for it?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-eight shillings a week," the girl answered. "You see, we are
  labourers. I suppose you are one of them who call themselves Socialist?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think I am," the boy answered. "I never talked with one, that I
  know of, in my life. And as for books, I never look inside them. But there's
  something wrong. If only one had time I would try and think out what it
  is."</p>

  <p>"Better rest," the girl said, curtly. "You look as though you need
  it."</p>

  <p>"And what about yourself?" he answered. "I haven't seen you with a speck
  of colour in your cheeks since the first time we met up on the hill
  there."</p>

  <p>"What chance should I have to get colour in my cheeks, I wonder?" she
  asked. "Anyhow, it doesn't matter; I'm strong enough."</p>

  <p>He turned his head and looked at her with new-born criticism in his eyes.
  Her cheeks were pallid, her eyes lustreless. Even her hair was dull and
  without life. Her mouth, well shaped once, had taken to itself a discontented
  turn. Her features, though good enough, were expressionless. Yet she was not
  without a certain natural prettiness, barely surviving the environment of her
  life. She bridled a little under his scrutiny and threw some grass into his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Impertinent," she said, "what do you think of me?"</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"You are well enough, Agnes," he said, "but you've got the brand upon you.
  So have I. So has every man in my workshop. So has every girl, I expect, in
  your room. I don't understand it."</p>

  <p>"Let's go down and get some tea," the girl suggested, yawning. "It won't
  do you no good to lie there puzzling your head about things that don't amount
  to anything. My, that's a fine motor-car."</p>

  <p>The boy turned his head. The car had come to a standstill in the road, a
  few yards away. The man and the girl who were its sole occupants had turned
  to look at the view. In front, the chauffeur and footman, immaculate both in
  spotless livery, looked stolidly into space.</p>

  <p>"In many respects," the man in the car was saying, "London is wonderfully
  fortunate. Our parks are magnificent. Fancy these thousands of acres free for
  all Londoners to come and sit about and enjoy themselves!"</p>

  <p>His companion inclined her head faintly towards the boy and girl beneath
  the tree.</p>

  <p>"Like that," she remarked, smiling. "Yes, I suppose they find pleasure in
  it."</p>

  <p>The man at her side followed her gesture. It seemed as though the eyes of
  the four met at the same moment.</p>

  <p>"Quite an idyll," he remarked, good-humouredly. "These people must do
  their love-making somewhere, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" the girl answered, nonchalantly. "How tired they look,
  though!"</p>

  <p>She withdrew her eyes, into which, perhaps, for a moment, had passed some
  faint glint of pity. The man touched a button and the car glided on. The boy
  raised his head from the girl's lap and followed it with his eyes. His gaze
  was no ordinary one. It seemed as though within these last few minutes he had
  seen farther into life, as though the passing of these two, denizens of an
  unknown world, had kindled in him a new seriousness.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand it," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Then you're a fool," the girl declared, hardly. "It's simple enough.
  They're rich and we're poor. They ride in motor-cars and we on hired
  bicycles. The girl wears silks and laces, and I have to be thankful for cheap
  linen. The man smokes cigars, and you can just run to a packet of Woodbines.
  It's easy enough to understand. They're rich and we're poor."</p>

  <p>The boy seemed as though he scarcely heard her.</p>

  <p>"I wonder!" he said to himself.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to stand tea or aren't you?" the girl asked, a little
  wearily. "I'm almost famished, and the places'll be full unless we
  hurry."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet&mdash;five feet ten of long, lanky humanity, dressed
  in a ready-made blue serge suit, a clean collar, and a black tie,
  good-looking enough in his way, but with his shoulders already bowed beneath
  the burden&mdash;the burden of the toiler. Even as he held his companion's
  bicycle for her to mount, his eyes watched the cloud of dust left by the
  motor-car.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A year later he stood, perfectly at his ease, in the prisoners' dock,
  waiting for the sentence which was obviously deserved and would certainly be
  forthcoming. Throughout the brief proceeding he had listened to the evidence
  against him with the intelligent interest of someone quite removed from
  personal association with the case. The speech for his defence he had
  ignored. His attitude, in fact, for a first offender, had been so puzzling
  that the magistrate was prompted to ask whether he had anything to say on his
  own behalf. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman who was kind enough to defend me," he remarked, "said a
  great deal more for me than I should have ventured to say for myself. It is
  quite true that I took the money&mdash;a hundred and seventy pounds, I think
  it was. I hoped to have got away with it, but the luck was against me."</p>

  <p>"You realized," the magistrate asked, "that you were committing a
  dishonest action?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," was the prompt reply. "The money to which I
  endeavoured to help myself was a very small portion of a great fortune which
  had been amassed by my employers by means of my brains and the brains of
  others like me. I have no personal grudge against the gentlemen who are
  prosecuting me, but morally I consider them at least as guilty as myself.
  They are not productive members of society in any sense of the word. They
  have left us, I and my fellow-labourers, to do the work, and they have spent
  the results in luxuries whilst we have been starved for necessities. I
  myself, in one room of that man's factory"&mdash;pointing to the somewhat
  pompous figure of the prosecutor&mdash;"have inaugurated changes and
  improvements which must have saved him in a single year ten times the sum I
  am accused of stealing. For this my wages were advanced two shillings a week.
  I am not saying," he continued, "that I could have got more elsewhere. None
  of my ideas were worth anything without the capital to buy the machinery and
  the established business in which to make use of it. But the fact remains
  that mine were the brains and his the opportunity. I was the worker and he
  the parasite. It didn't seem to me to be a fair bargain, and I saw no way of
  getting it set right, so I helped myself. I am willing to serve any sentence
  you may give me, but if you, sir, and the society proclaim me dishonest, I
  venture, with the utmost heartiness, to disagree with you."</p>

  <p>The magistrate stared at him. There was a little ripple of interest though
  the court. A moment or two later the sentence was pronounced: "Six months'
  imprisonment in the second division!"</p>

  <p>The youth, as he was being led from the dock, met the eyes of his employer
  fixed a little curiously upon him. It was thus almost that they had exchanged
  glances in Richmond Park twelve months before. There was nothing threatening
  about the appearance of this younger man, who followed the policeman
  obediently from the dock, yet his late employer went back to his works with
  an uneasy feeling that a new force was abroad in the world&mdash;something
  which he did not understand. He thought of it at dinner that night, and his
  daughter feared that things had gone ill in the City, and felt a moment's
  alarm lest anything might happen to prevent the purchase of a new steam yacht
  in which they had planned a cruise.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong in the City, I hope?" she asked, after the servants had
  left.</p>

  <p>Her father shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all," he answered. "Rather a curious thing happened today,
  though. Do you remember driving through the Richmond Park a year ago? We
  stopped to look at the view, and a boy and a girl who were lying on the grass
  under one of the trees stared at us curiously. I told you at the time the
  boy's face seemed familiar to me. I discovered afterwards that he was one of
  my employees."</p>

  <p>"I remember perfectly," the girl answered, with interest. "I told you that
  I liked his face."</p>

  <p>"To-day I had to prosecute him," her father continued. "He robbed us of a
  hundred and seventy pounds, and very nearly got away." She raised her
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," she remarked, quietly. "He didn't look like a thief."</p>

  <p>"Nor did he look like one in the dock," her father answered. "Nor did he
  talk like one. He even tried to justify himself. It's this infernal Socialism
  that's doing all the mischief with the half-educated working classes. Young
  men like this take it up and imbibe the most absurd ideas."</p>

  <p>"Did he have to go to prison?" the girl asked, anxiously.</p>

  <p>Her father nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he declared. "I couldn't have got him off if I would. He's gone to
  prison for six months."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Being naturally of a law-abiding temperament, and conducting himself,
  therefore, in prison with rare discretion, John Selwyn was a free man again
  in five months and eight days. Twenty-four hours after that period, however,
  he stood once more in the dock upon another and very different charge. This
  time he was certainly paler, and he was dressed in borrowed clothes, but his
  manner had lost nothing of its earnest composure.</p>

  <p>"The most determined case, sir, I ever did see," a policeman explained.
  "Got on the steamboat pier and threw himself off in the deepest part of the
  river."</p>

  <p>The magistrate nodded.</p>

  <p>"I read the particulars," he said. "I understand that he even struggled
  with the lighterman who saved his life."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," the young man in the dock interrupted. "I did not throw
  myself into the river with the object of being picked out again." The
  magistrate looked at him earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Do you consider," he asked, "that you have a right to dispose of your own
  life in this fashion."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" the young man answered. "It appears to me that for anyone in my
  position it is the most sensible and reasonable thing to do. I lived like a
  slave for a great many years. I made an attempt to better myself, and it
  failed. Now that I have been in prison my chances of getting on in the world
  are certainly less than they were. I really do not feel under the slightest
  compulsion to continue an unequal struggle."</p>

  <p>"There is a place for every man in the world," the magistrate said, "if
  only he has the courage and wit enough to find it."</p>

  <p>"You are doubtless right, sir," the prisoner answered, politely. "I would
  suggest, in that case, that a few signposts would be an advantage. I have
  never considered myself lacking in intelligence, but, so far as I am
  concerned, I have failed to find that place."</p>

  <p>"You became a thief," the magistrate reminded him.</p>

  <p>"That is a point," the prisoner answered, "upon which I regret to say that
  we disagree. But, in any case, I was driven to it. The day before I took that
  money, if it interests you to know this, I went to a physician. He explained
  to me that ten hours' work a day in an unwholesome atmosphere, without proper
  food or under sanitary conditions of life, was rapidly undermining my
  constitution. Another year of it and I should have been a dead man. I felt
  that it was time for me to make a change."</p>

  <p>"If I discharge you," the magistrate asked, "will you promise not to
  repeat the attempt?"</p>

  <p>The young man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "I have no wish to become a burden to the State, and I
  do not exactly see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The magistrate stopped him.</p>

  <p>"There has come into my hands," he said, gravely, "a sum of twenty pounds.
  That sum is yours if you will promise to leave the country at once and not to
  repeat the offence with which you are at present charged."</p>

  <p>"My I inquire the price of a third-class ticket to New York, and the sum
  of money I should be required to have to be allowed to land?" the prisoner
  asked.</p>

  <p>"The police-court missionary," the magistrate answered, "will take you
  from here to an emigrant office, when you can learn all particulars."</p>

  <p>"In that case," the young man declared, "I am willing to give my
  promise."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Eight years later Sir Henry Rathbone and his daughter stood talking
  together in the reception-room of one of London's principal restaurants. The
  eight years had dealt kindly enough with the girl, who had become a beautiful
  woman. The man had not improved. His face bore the marks of a life of
  pleasure. Here and there were lines which seemed to indicate anxiety. Just at
  present he had very little the look of a prosperous man.</p>

  <p>"You can have the car for Ranelagh, of course, Violet," he said, "but I am
  quite sure that I shall not be able to go. My luncheon appointment here is a
  very important one."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I wonder you men don't do all your business in the City," she
  remarked.</p>

  <p>Her father laughed hardly.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl," he said, "It is only with the utmost difficulty that I
  have managed to get this fellow Selwyn to meet me at all. He declined to come
  to the works, and it is only to oblige Haregood, his solicitor, that he
  agreed to lunch here to-day."</p>

  <p>"I really cannot understand," she remarked, watching the people as they
  came in, "why a little machinery should be so important to you." Her father
  frowned irritably&mdash;his temper had not improved during the last few
  years.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand anything about it, you see, Violet," he declared.
  "This man has invented some machines by which he can make my screws at about
  half the price it costs me to turn them out. Unless he'll lease me some
  machines, or sell me some, or amalgamate, Messrs. Rathbone and Co. may as
  well close their doors."</p>

  <p>"What does it matter?" the girl answered, carelessly. "You have plenty of
  money."</p>

  <p>Her father seemed to grow pale underneath his flushed cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Plenty of money," he agreed, "but every penny in the business. Here they
  come."</p>

  <p>"And here," the girl remarked, "is Lady Angerton. Good-bye for the
  present, then."</p>

  <p>She went forward to meet her hostess at the same time that her father
  shook hands with his two guests. Selwyn had changed beyond recognition, yet
  as they took their places at the table Sir Henry was conscious of a vague
  sense of familiarity.</p>

  <p>"Where did you learn the practical part of our industry, may I ask, Mr.
  Selwyn?" he inquired, as soon as it was possible to turn the conversation
  toward business.</p>

  <p>"In your workshops, Sir Henry," the young man answered. "I was there eight
  years ago. By the by, perhaps I ought to remind you before I accept your
  invitation that I have been in prison. I stole a hundred and seventy pounds
  of yours once, you know. You got the money back again, but some people have
  prejudices about that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>Sir Henry shook in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he muttered, "I remember. I remember you now."</p>

  <p>There was an awkward pause.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have explained before," the young man murmured, with a quiet
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Not at all&mdash;not at all," his host declared, hastily. "These things
  are best forgotten. This is a business meeting, Mr. Selwyn. I want to talk to
  you about those machines of yours."</p>

  <p>"I shall be glad," the young man said, "to hear what you have to say."</p>

  <p>They talked throughout luncheon, and in the smoking-room afterwards, and
  Mr. John Selwyn only resisted with difficulty an attempt on the part of his
  host to take him round to his club. He declined politely but firmly to pledge
  himself to anything. His idea in coming to England, he admitted, was to set
  down the machines to manufacture screws for himself. Sir Henry felt the
  perspiration break out on his forehead at the mere idea.</p>

  <p>"Between ourselves," he said, "we need not mince words. You know, and I
  know, that if you do so, and if you refuse to sell or lease your machines, my
  firm will have to close their doors."</p>

  </div>

  <p>"Precisely," Mr. Selwyn admitted. "The fact had occurred to me."</p>

  <p>"You mean to make us do it, by God!" Sir Henry exclaimed, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"If you want the truth," the young man answered, "I do."</p>

  <p>Sir Henry went away from the interview disturbed and uneasy. Nevertheless,
  negotiations were not wholly broken off. There were times when Selwyn seemed
  on the point of accepting some of the offers which the solicitors of Messrs.
  Rathbone and Co., Limited, were continually making him. Sir Henry himself
  spared no effort to win the good-will of his former employé. He invited him
  to his house&mdash;an invitation which, curiously enough, John Selwyn
  accepted. On one of these occasions he met Violet, and their mutual interest
  was so obvious a thing that she was feverishly incited by her father to take
  a hand in the game. Mr. Selwyn listened to all that she had to say, and was
  very polite. He even accepted further invitations, and more than once he was
  seen about with Violet Rathbone.</p>

  <p>They sat together one Sunday morning in the Park. Her father, at the first
  opportunity, had made some excuse to hurry off and leave them alone. They
  talked the usual banalities, watched the people, and made remarks about them.
  Finally, Violet rose a little suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Come and sit further back, Mr. Selwyn," she said. "I want to talk to
  you."</p>

  <p>He obeyed at once. No one could have judged from his face what effect her
  words had upon him. They found two seats a little apart from the others. She
  looked for a moment at the lace of her parasol and then into his
  expressionless eyes.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Selwyn," she said, "I am beginning to find the present position
  embarrassing. You know very well why my father leaves me alone with you, why
  he is always asking you to the house. I do not see why we should play at
  misunderstanding one another. My father tells me that it rests with you
  whether or not he is to lose the whole of his fortune and to watch the ruin
  of his business."</p>

  <p>The young man nodded his head thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Your father is quite right, Miss Rathbone," he said. "It rests entirely
  with me."</p>

  <p>"There are ways," she continued, "of avoiding this, are there not?
  Compromises, I mean, which could be made? You would lose very little, for
  instance, if you leased your machines to my father or went into partnership
  with Rathbone and Co., Limited?"</p>

  <p>"So far as the financial side of the matter is concerned," the young man
  admitted, blandly, "it would be a very reasonable and satisfactory
  settlement."</p>

  <p>"It does not appeal to you, though?" she continued.</p>

  <p>"It does not," he admitted.</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows. They were coming to it at last, then!</p>

  <p>"From your manner," she said, "one would imagine that you had some
  grievance against my father."</p>

  <p>"I have," he admitted. "Not a personal one altogether, and yet, perhaps,
  it is a personal one. I have been in prison, you know, Miss Rathbone, for
  stealing from your father."</p>

  <p>She laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"You must not talk about it, please," she said. "We have forgotten all
  that."</p>

  <p>She did not move her fingers for a moment. She was twenty-six years old,
  very beautiful, but as yet heart-whole. She was beginning to feel that there
  was something remarkably attractive about this young man, if only he would be
  reasonable.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you remember," he said, "somewhere about nine years ago,
  driving through Richmond Park and stopping on the hill?"</p>

  <p>"I remember perfectly," she agreed. "You sat on the grass with your head
  in a young woman's lap. I considered it at the time most shocking
  behaviour."</p>

  <p>"It was the way of the world in which I moved," he answered, "the way of
  the world in which Fate and your father kept me. It is not that I have a
  personal animus against Sir Henry. He was my employer in those days, and he
  only did what others did and are doing; but, none the less, the wealth which
  he is so anxious that I should preserve for him has been built up on the
  bodies and the souls of hundreds such as I. Labour to him was labour, a
  weapon towards his end&mdash;some dead, inanimate thing, to be used as
  cheaply as possible and as effectively as could be. I had my brains picked
  week by week for your father's benefit. Those days are hard to forget, Miss
  Rathbone."</p>

  <p>"I am not a political economist," the girl said, "but you must surely
  understand that it was not my father who fixed the conditions. What he did,
  he did because others were doing it. It is not possible, Mr. Selwyn, that you
  bear him a real and personal grudge for those days?"</p>

  <p>The young man looked out across the Park, but he said nothing.</p>

  <p>"It is an opportunity which makes the employer," the girl went on. "You
  yourself speak of starting great works. Will your men be better treated than
  my father treated you?"</p>

  <p>"I intend to make some efforts, Miss Rathbone, in that direction," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>She looked down at her little patent shoe and beat the ground impatiently
  for a moment or two.</p>

  <p>"You are so enigmatic," she protested, softly. "Can't we understand one
  another, Mr. Selwyn? Please speak out and tell me what is in your mind."</p>

  <p>He looked at her thoughtfully. She represented the last word in wealth and
  elegance and education. Her delightful carriage was the outcome of her
  healthy, untrammeled life. No trouble had ever dimmed her beautiful eyes or
  carved a single line upon her still girlish face.</p>

  <p>"Miss Rathbone," he said, "you and your father are both anxious to know my
  plans. It is better, perhaps, that I should tell you them. I will not admit
  that I have any personal feelings against your father. On the other hand, I
  hate, with a hatred which has been absolutely the mainspring of these recent
  years of my life, the means by which he made his wealth, the means by which
  he holds it. You have been very kind to me. Perhaps I have not deserved it.
  You beg for peace and I tell you that it must be war. I am here for that
  purpose and no other. Already the plans are out for my new factories. In two
  years' time&mdash;before, if your father is wise&mdash;he will close his
  doors. I shall find employment for his workpeople, and I promise you that I
  shall find it on very different conditions to any that Messrs. Rathbone,
  Limited, ever offered."</p>

  <p>She looked at him, suddenly pale to the lips.</p>

  <p>"Is this final?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"It is final," he answered.</p>

  <p>They were very nearly alone, and she leaned so closely towards him that
  her soft breath fell upon his cheek.</p>

  <p>"You are very hard, Mr. Selwyn. Could nothing&mdash;could nobody move
  you?"</p>

  <p>She was offering herself to him&mdash;he knew that quite well.</p>

  <p>"Nobody," he answered. "Not even the woman whom, in a few weeks' time, I
  hope to make my wife."</p>

  <p>For a moment she neither moved nor spoke. Then she drew away and rose to
  her feet with a little shiver. Amongst the crowd at the corner came her
  father. She hurried toward him.</p>

  <p>"Please leave me," she begged her companion. "I am going home. I have
  taken too much of your time already. Forgive me."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Late on the following afternoon John Selwyn set out to pay a call which he
  had already delayed for several weeks. He found his way to a certain address
  in Hanover Street, mounted to the first floor, and knocked at the door. A
  young woman dressed in black, with pins and needles stuck all over the front
  of her dress, threw it open. She stared at the visitor in surprise.</p>

  <p>"The shop's downstairs," she remarked, "There's no one allowed up here.
  Madame is very strict about it."</p>

  <p>John Selwyn's eyes travelled down the room. There were at least twenty
  girls sitting there at work&mdash;twenty girls with pale cheeks, and only one
  small window open. His conscience smote him because of those three weeks'
  delay.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said. "I came to make inquiries about a Miss Agnes
  Carton."</p>

  <p>".Agnes Carton!" the young woman exclaimed. "Why, she left nearly four
  years ago. You'll find her at No. 55, Grosvenor Street." John Selwyn raised
  his hat and departed.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have come before," he said to himself, repentantly. "Perhaps
  it is too late."</p>

  <p>He walked quickly to No. 55, Grosvenor Street. The appearance of the place
  was a distinct relief to him. It was a neat little milliner's shop, clean and
  smart. He opened the door and found himself in a cool, handsomely-furnished
  apartment, which to his inexperience seemed almost like the drawing-room of a
  private house. A young lady came hurrying forward.</p>

  <p>"I am in search of Miss Agnes Carton," he announced. "I was told that she
  was to be heard of here."</p>

  <p>The girl was puzzled for a moment, then she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Why, you mean madame!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Madame?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," the girl answered. "That was her name before she was married.
  Here she is. It is a gentleman, madame, who asks for you."</p>

  <p>A tall young lady, very elegant, very stylishly dressed, and apparently
  very prosperous, came towards him with an inquiring smile. John Selwyn
  recognized her with a little gasp.</p>

  <p>"My dear Agnes!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's&mdash;it's John Selwyn!" she declared.</p>

  <p>The assistant slipped discreetly away. They shook hands a little
  perfunctorily.</p>

  <p>"I have come to ask you to marry me," he announced.</p>

  <p>She laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>"Well, if it isn't just like you!" she answered. "You haven't changed a
  bit."</p>

  <p>"I mean it," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"But you're three years too late," she laughed. "The idea of going away
  like you did and never writing me a single line, and then walking in one
  morning and expecting me to marry you off-hand!"</p>

  <p>"I had no time for letters," he said. "I have been working hard."</p>

  <p>"From your appearance, I should say that you've been making money," she
  declared.</p>

  <p>"More than I shall ever be able to spend," he assured her. "If only you'd
  waited."</p>

  <p>She laughed again.</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish," she said. "I want you to meet my husband. He's such a
  dear. We should never have been able to marry, though, but for&mdash;" A
  sudden change came into her face.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course," she continued, "you were there. Let me tell you of my
  adventure. About a year after you left for America I was called down into the
  showroom one day and found a young lady there, looking at evening gowns. I
  was very tired&mdash;we had been up late the night before&mdash;and she was
  very impatient and hard to please. Well, I got trying on things for half an
  hour or so, and at last I fainted. I couldn't help it, but madame was very
  angry."</p>

  <p>"And the girl?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Madame sent me away the next day, and I saw her in the street on my way
  home. She stopped her carriage and came up to me. I told her that I had lost
  my situation, and she was so angry that she went straight back to madame and
  told her that she would never set foot in her shop again. Afterwards she sent
  me to Hastings for two months, and when I was quite strong again she lent me
  the money to start in business here. I am proud to say that in less than
  eighteen months I was able to pay her back every penny."</p>

  <p>"But what about this husband?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You remember my telling you about Mr. Mallison," she said. "He used to
  travel in silks, and I saw him now and then at madame's. He called here when
  I started and was very attentive. In a business like this, you know, one
  needs a man."</p>

  <p>John Selwyn laughed. He was astonished to find how relieved he was.</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," he said, "but I consider you've treated me
  shamefully."</p>

  <p>"You shall tell my husband so," she declared. "He'll be here in a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"We'll all go out to lunch," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime," madame said, "let me tell you something strange. Do
  you know who the young lady was?"</p>

  <p>"Howe should I?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember sitting in Richmond Park one Sunday afternoon when two
  people went by in a motor-car&mdash;a man and a girl? We all stared at one
  another rather strangely, and you told me afterwards that the man was your
  employer."</p>

  <p>John Selwyn stood perfectly still.</p>

  <p>"I remember," he said. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"That was the girl&mdash;Miss Rathbone&mdash;who has done all this for
  me," madame declared, with tears in her eyes. John Selwyn sat down in one of
  the padded chairs.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word," he said, slowly, "in those days I used to admit that I
  couldn't understand life. I don't understand it now."</p>

  <p>Late that afternoon he called at Berkeley Square. Miss Rathbone was at
  home, the butler thought, after a moment's hesitation, but she had gone to
  her room with a headache, and was refusing to see callers. Selwyn persisted,
  and twenty minutes later she came to him in the darkened drawing-room. He was
  standing when she entered, and she did not ask him to take a seat.</p>

  <p>"I did not expect to see you here again, Mr. Selwyn," she said. "Under the
  circumstances, I think perhaps you might have stayed away."</p>

  <p>"I could not," he answered, simply.</p>

  <p>She gave a little start.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was my father whom you wished to see?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, "it was you."</p>

  <p>She came a few steps farther into the room. He saw then that she was paler
  than he had ever seen her. It was the beginning of trouble, this&mdash;the
  beginning of the blow which he had dealt.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," she said, "what you can have to say to me."</p>

  <p>"You look tired!" he exclaimed, abruptly. "Won't you sit down?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated and then obeyed him, sinking on to a couch with a little
  gesture of weariness.</p>

  <p>"Miss Rathbone," he said, "I have come to thank you for your kindness to
  the woman whom I was expecting to marry."</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment without comprehension.</p>

  <p>"I mean the young lady," he reminded her, "whom you set up in business in
  Grosvenor Street, whom you saw with me nine years ago in Richmond Park."</p>

  <p>She suddenly understood.</p>

  <p>"It was she, then, whom you spoke of in the Park yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," he answered. "I was going to marry her. It was only right.
  She and I were sufferers together. We belonged to the same world. My
  prosperity was to have been her prosperity. You know," he continued, with a
  sudden smile, "even amongst the lower orders you can't sit in Richmond Park
  with your head on a girl's lap for nothing."</p>

  <p>"You were going to marry her, but you didn't care," she said, in a broken
  voice.</p>

  <p>"I certainly did not care," he admitted. "I did not know," he continued,
  coming close to her, "that I cared for anybody. I did not believe that there
  was any room in my life for that sort of thing. I rather fancy that I have
  been mistaken."</p>

  <p>"It's horribly like the end of a story," she murmured, loosening her arms
  for a moment from around his neck.</p>

  <p>"Not the end, sweetheart," he answered; "the beginning."</p>

  <p>It was over at last, the five days' <i>cause célèbre</i>, the five days'
  long-drawn-out agony. To the man who sat alone upon the hard bench fixed
  close to the whitewashed wall of the little cell the whole thing seemed, now
  that it was over, very much like a dream. He was plunged once more into
  solitude. The distant sounds came to his ears in a sort of muffled chaos. The
  crowded court with its insufferable atmosphere; the white, parchment-like
  face of the judge; the bewigged barristers with their strange callousness,
  their slight jests, their artificial earnestness; the sea of closely-packed
  faces extending even to the door; the faces of friends, acquaintances,
  enemies&mdash;all seemed, now that the curtain had fallen, as though they
  were but images of what might have been, as though they had never
  had&mdash;never could have had&mdash;any real existence. And then the
  story&mdash;the hateful, impossible story&mdash;twisted and turned against
  him at every point, the lies of another man put into his mouth, the evil
  deeds of his partner heaped upon his shoulders. His first sense of fierce
  martyrdom had burned away into ashes through the furnace of those long days
  of torture and suffering. The result had come at last scarcely even as a
  blow. The horror of it had been discounted a hundred times over, discounted
  by all those curious, inimical faces, the scathing words of the prosecuting
  barrister&mdash;a member of his club, once a guest at his
  house&mdash;discounted even by the cold, carefully-balanced words of the
  judge himself, so studiously impartial, so weightily censorious. It seemed to
  him that nothing remained&mdash;no pain, no loneliness, no humiliation. His
  senses were steeped in a sort of torpor. He was barely conscious of the
  opening of his door, of the entrance of the visitor, fresh from the court,
  who was sitting now by his side in grave silence.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, indeed, Mr. Harewood," the lawyer was saying, "that the
  case went so badly. Personally, I am quite convinced that a serious injustice
  has been done. If Carelton had only been alive, he would have been able to
  clear you in many ways. Without his evidence the Court, of course, have
  assumed that you shared equally with him in his speculations and rash
  schemes."</p>

  <p>The convicted man made no reply. He appeared indeed almost to have lost
  the power of speech. The solicitor, who was really exceedingly sorry for his
  client, and honestly believed him guilty of little more than the folly of a
  pleasure-loving man of the world who has left his affairs to an unscrupulous
  partner, tried to impart a consoling note to his next speech.</p>

  <p>"The sentence," he declared, "was far too severe. I have heard it
  universally condemned. I can assure you that we do not intend to let the
  matter remain here. There will be a petition to the Home Secretary, and I
  believe I may say that it will be signed by the principal counsel for the
  prosecution. In the meantime, if you have any messages, you will be allowed
  to see your wife for a few minutes. And as to letters&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a considerable space of wooden bench between the two men, and
  Harewood's fist suddenly smote it a terrible blow. "Enough!" he said. "The
  thing is finished&mdash;my life is finished! I have no wife&mdash;no
  children! I wish to see no one. I will see no one."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Harewood!" the lawyer protested.</p>

  <p>A sudden fire flashed in the eves of the convicted man.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" he ordered. "You did your best. I am grateful. For the rest, I
  repeat that what has happened takes me out of this world as surely as death
  itself. You can tell my people that from me. They had better make their minds
  up to it, for it is inevitable. My wife is a widow and my children
  fatherless. I suppose there is a little money left somewhere. They must shift
  for themselves, as well as they can. But as for visits or letters, no! Not
  the thinnest thread shall bind me to the past when once I enter the convict
  prison. Understand that finally."</p>

  <p>"In a few months' time&mdash;," the lawyer began, soothingly.</p>

  <p>"In a few months' time," Harewood repeated, "things will be with me
  exactly as they are now. I have been hardly judged, perhaps, yet according to
  my strict deserts. Mine was the sin of omission. I left Carelton to play
  ducks and drakes with our clients' money while I enjoyed life in my own way.
  I trusted Carelton and I had no right to trust him, or any man, with other
  people's money. It was more than foolish&mdash;it was wicked. I admit the
  justice of my sentence. I am prepared to pay."</p>

  <p>"With regards to Mrs. Harewood&mdash;," the lawyer recommenced.</p>

  <p>"So far as I am concerned," the convicted man interrupted, "there is no
  such person. Let her understand that, and let my children understand it. God
  himself could not blot out these last five days, or the memory of them. They
  have come and gone like an avalanche, and they have swept me from the face of
  the earth. You understand?" he wound up, rising to his feet at the sound of a
  key in the door. "Letters I shall not open. Visitors I will not receive. I
  shall enter the convict prison without a name, and if ever I leave it I shall
  leave it without a name."</p>

  <p>"You will leave it a good deal before fifteen years," the lawyer
  declared.</p>

  <p>"As to that I am indifferent," Harewood answered. "Indifferent, that is to
  say," he added, slowly, "save for one thing."</p>

  <p>"Your children?" the lawyer murmured.</p>

  <p>"No," Harewood answered, with a note of repressed passion in his tone;
  "the children of Stephen Carelton!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The sovereign lay on the edge of the kerbstone, half hidden by a little
  sprinkling of dust. Carelton's companion pointed it out to him.</p>

  <p>"Your sovereign, Stephen," he remarked. "Lucky fellow, as usual! A few
  more rolls and it would have gone down the drain."</p>

  <p>Carleton stood on the middle of the pavement looking at the spot where the
  glittering edge of the coin was clearly visible. He made no motion to pick it
  up. His friend looked at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I know you're a veritable Croesus, Stephen," he remarked, "making, money
  hand over fist, and all the rest of it, but I presume you don't intend to
  leave that sovereign for the sweepers?"</p>

  <p>The young man drew a cigarette-case from his pocket and, selecting one,
  tapped it against the side and calmly lit it.</p>

  <p>"For the sweepers, my dear Cyril," he answered, "I think not. To tell you
  the truth, I believe that Providence has some other destination in view for
  that luckless coin. That is the fourth time within the last five minutes that
  I have dropped it."</p>

  <p>His companion adopted a practical attitude.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you keep your gold in your waistcoat pocket?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"You are missing the whole point of my statement," Carelton declared. "I
  am convinced that it was not carelessness alone which caused the coin to drop
  from my fingers twice in the taxi-cab and twice when I sought for that loose
  silver to pay the man. Depend upon it, Cyril, Fate has its own use for that
  sovereign. I am clearly dispossessed."</p>

  <p>His friend looked at him doubtfully. Carelton was a man of whims; but
  surely this was absurd!</p>

  <p>"You can't mean," he said, "that you are going to leave it there?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely what I do mean, my dear fellow," Carelton answered. "Come into
  the club and stand in the bay window. We shall be able to see the person whom
  Fortune has taken under her wing."</p>

  <p>"There is not the slightest doubt about it," his friend remarked,
  decisively, "that you are more or less a fool, Stephen."</p>

  <p>"I hope so," Carelton declared, fervently. "This world was not made for \
  vise men. The workhouses and prisons are full of them. Come inside, Cyril,
  there's a good fellow. I am really interested to see into whose hands my
  sovereign is fated to pass."</p>

  <p>The two men stood in the bay window of the club and watched. Stephen
  Carelton was tall and dark, with pale face, humorous mouth, and keen, grey
  eyes deep-set under his level eyebrows. He was still a young man, but ten
  years of exceptionally hard work, successful though it had been, had left its
  traces upon his features. Cyril Hanneford, his companion, was a man of
  slighter physique, more carefully dressed, a person of less marked
  characteristics, a loiterer amongst the byways of life, in the broad
  thoroughfares of which Carelton had already found for himself a place. As
  regards this particular incident, however, the two seemed to have changed
  identities. Carelton, the practical man of affairs, had yielded to the idlest
  of superstitions. Hanneford, the person to whom such things might well have
  seemed likely to appeal, was adopting the pose and tone of a cynic.</p>

  <p>"A sovereign," he remarked, looking out upon the pavement, "is relatively
  a small sum. Yet, after all, my dear Stephen, there are possibilities about
  it. It is the price of a bottle of wine, a basket of violets for your
  good-looking typist, a stall at the Opera, a tip to a <i>maitre d'hôtel</i>.
  You might, even," he added, "entertain me modestly to luncheon upon that sum.
  And behold! there it lies," he wound up, pointing out of the window, "chucked
  away as a thing of no worth, left there to gratify the vaguest of
  superstitions. Upon my word, I've a good mind to go out and fetch it
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk rot, Cyril," Carelton declared, good-humouredly. "Stay here
  with me instead and watch for the lucky person. See, there is someone coming
  now."</p>

  <p>A boy went by with a parcel under his arm, whistling loudly, with his eyes
  fixed upon the windows of the great club. He did not even look upon the
  pavement. Then there came a couple of men, arm in arm, talking intently as
  though engrossed upon some matter of business. They, too, passed on without a
  downward glance. A woman leading a dog by a string followed, but she only
  looked at the ground to admire her well-shod feet. A beggar-woman came slowly
  along, and Carelton found it hard work to prevent his friend from rushing
  out.</p>

  <p>"If someone's going to pick it up," he protested, "why not that poor
  woman? It looks as though it might do her a bit of good."</p>

  <p>Carelton held his arm.</p>

  <p>"If it is meant for her, she will see it," he declared.</p>

  <p>"You are not such a superstitious ass," Hanneford demanded, "as to
  believe&mdash;"</p>

  <p><a id="picSov2"
     name="picSov2"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>
  <img src="1300341h-images/TheSovereign3.jpg"
        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"I believe nothing," Carelton assured him. "Only I intend that Chance,
  which four times brought that particular coin from my pocket, shall choose
  the person into whose hands it shall pass."</p>

  <p>"To judge by his walk, then, here he comes," Hanneford declared. "He's got
  his eyes glued on the pavement all right. Two to one he'll see it! No, he's
  going by! By Jove, he's stopped! He's got it, Stephen! Did you see him pick
  it up? You can say good-bye to your sovereign now, old man. He doesn't look
  the sort of chap to part easily."</p>

  <p>Carelton was watching eagerly the face of the man who, after a covert
  glance around, was preparing to quit the scene. He was certainly not a person
  of prepossessing appearance; but, on the other hand, his clothes and general
  air seemed to indicate the fact of his belonging to that class to whom a
  sovereign is a distinct consideration. He was of powerful build, thin but
  sinewy, with hard, weather-stained face and undistinguished slouch. He wore a
  ready-made suit of clothes, and he carried no gloves or stick. Yet there was
  something about him a little different from the ordinary wayfarer, something
  which excited the curiosity of both men as they watched him hurry off.</p>

  <p>"The sort of man, that, who would take a great deal of placing," Carelton
  remarked, thoughtfully. "He was no ordinary waster, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"It's good-bye to your sovereign, at any rate," Hanneford laughed. "Hadn't
  you better order those whiskies and sodas?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The man with a sovereign gripped in his hand passed down the street and
  disappeared. There was a curious lack of vitality about him and the way he
  moved. His walk was a tired plod&mdash;a physical action which seemed purely
  mechanical. If he brushed the sleeve of a passer-by, he started, as though
  alarmed, and shrank away. Notwithstanding his somewhat forbidding appearance,
  he had an air which was almost timid. An acute physiognomist might easily
  have placed him. His were the mannerisms and deportment of a man finding
  himself once more amongst his fellows after a long period of solitude.</p>

  <p>He reached the Strand and pursued his way steadily along as far as
  Chancery Lane. Here he turned into a little square and came to a sudden
  standstill before a venerable pile of offices. Then, for the first time since
  he had stopped to pick up that sovereign, the light swept across his face.
  Exactly opposite to him was a large brass plate, on which was engraved the
  name of Mr. Stephen Carelton, Junior, with a list of legal distinctions in
  smaller type. The place had an undoubtedly thriving appearance. Through the
  wire blinds of the offices he could see rows of clerks. There were visitors
  coming and going all the time&mdash;barristers' clerks with silk hats and
  small black bags, and others more obviously clients. The man stood there for
  several minutes, motionless. His lips were slightly parted, his face had
  gradually become hard and cruel. He spoke to himself for the first time.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stephen Carelton, Junior!" he muttered; "the boy who was at Oxford.
  It is well that one of them is alive."</p>

  <p>He hesitated for a moment as though about to enter the offices. Then he
  looked at the sovereign in his hand and changed his mind. Slowly he turned
  round to face another shock before he had taken half-a-dozen steps. A
  carriage was drawn up close to the kerb in Chancery Lane. A woman with
  uplifted skirts was in the act of descending from it. She was tall, graceful,
  and young; fashionably dressed, with pleasant smile and clear brown eyes,
  which rested for a moment upon the man who was staring at her. She was
  suddenly perplexed. A frown wrinkled her forehead. She even stood still in
  the middle of the pavement. The man shuffled on and her eyes followed him.
  Then she went on her way slowly. She entered the offices of Mr. Stephen
  Carelton, Junior, with a puzzled frown lingering upon her face.</p>

  <p>Harewood strode on towards the Strand, with the fires of hate suddenly
  loosed within him&mdash;the yearning of a moment changed already to that
  passionate desire to kill which for many years had been all that had remained
  to him of sensation. He came to a standstill in front of a small shop in the
  Strand, where various secondhand articles were for sale. He looked in at the
  window, and after a casual glance entered the shop.</p>

  <p>"How much for the small revolver?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The shopman took it from the window and examined it.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen and sixpence," he answered, laying it upon the counter. "Nice
  little weapon, too&mdash;good as new."</p>

  <p>Harewood took it up and examined it.</p>

  <p>"What about cartridges?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to buy those at a gunsmith's," the man told him; "but there
  are three or four here somewhere which came with it. You can have them, if
  you like."</p>

  <p>He rummaged about for several minutes and produced them at last from a
  large box filled with oddments.</p>

  <p>"They've been lying here for some time," he remarked, "but I expect you'll
  find them all right."</p>

  <p>Harewood inserted them into the chambers of the revolver, thrust it into
  his pocket, and placed the sovereign upon the table. The shopman handed him
  four and sixpence.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't carry it like that if I were you," he advised. "A loaded
  revolver's not too safe a thing to have loose in the pocket."</p>

  <p>Harewood nodded, but left the place without making any answer. In the
  street he was conscious of a sudden giddiness. He stopped short for a moment,
  and remembered that as yet he had tasted no food that day. His hand was
  shaking like a drunken man's. Reluctantly he crossed the road and entered a
  small eating-house. It was a waste of time this, but it was necessary. When
  he emerged, half an hour later, he walked with a new decision and with more
  rapid footsteps. In a few moments he had found his way once more to the
  little square off Chancery Lane, and, presenting himself at the offices of
  Mr. Stephen Carelton, Junior, made his inquiry at the clerk's desk.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stephen Carelton has just come in from lunch, sir," the boy told him.
  "Have you an appointment?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Harewood answered.</p>

  <p>The youth took up a book and glanced down it searchingly.</p>

  <p>"We can't seem to have any record of an appointment with anyone of your
  name," he remarked. "When was it made?"</p>

  <p>"A long time ago," Harewood answered, grimly; "perhaps before you were in
  a position to record it. Tell Mr. Carelton that Mr. Harewood wishes to see
  him at once."</p>

  <p>The name, audible this time to the other clerks, elicited a slight stir of
  interest, but it did not occur to anyone to connect the speaker with the
  quondam head of the firm. After a brief delay Harewood was shown upstairs.
  Trembling a little at the knees, he passed along the familiar way. Soon he
  was ushered into the private office which had once been his. Stephen Carelton
  looked up and greeted him with a brief nod.</p>

  <p>"You wished to see me I understand?" he said. "I am Mr. Stephen Carelton.
  I didn't quite catch your name."</p>

  <p>The boy had disappeared and closed the door behind him. Harewood calmly
  seated himself in the empty chair opposite to the young lawyer.</p>

  <p>"My name is Harewood," he announced.</p>

  <p>They looked at one another across the table. Stephen Carelton's expression
  was at first one of puzzled doubt. Suddenly a light seemed to break in upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he exclaimed. "You are Julian Harewood?"</p>

  <p>"Julian Harewood&mdash;yes!"</p>

  <p>The younger man held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"You have taken us completely by surprise, sir," he said. "Allow me to
  say, however, that I am very glad to see you. We had no idea that&mdash;that
  you would be here so soon. Your behaviour as to letters has been a little
  extraordinary, you know."</p>

  <p>Harewood looked at the outstretched hand as though at some poisonous
  thing. Carelton slowly withdrew it.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to bear malice against me, I hope, Mr. Harewood?" he
  said, frankly. "I know that my father used you ill, but it was before my
  time. I know, too&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be quiet!" Harewood ordered.</p>

  <p>He drew the revolver from his pocket and fingered it almost
  affectionately.</p>

  <p>"I was released from prison early this morning," he said, slowly. "I had
  only one desire when I came out; I have had only one desire all the time I
  have been a prisoner, and that was that I might kill you, or anyone else who
  bore your name, before night."</p>

  <p>"What have I done to injure you, Mr. Harewood?" the young man asked,
  calmly.</p>

  <p>"You are your father's son," Harewood answered. "Look at me. I am the
  broken-down wreck of a man, the shell of a man in whom the heart and the soul
  are dead. I am what your father made me. Fortunately for him, he is dead.
  Unfortunately for you, you are alive. Stephen Carelton's son, indeed! I, too,
  had children. What has become of them God only knows! A wife&mdash;she is
  dead, I hope. Say your prayers quickly, young man. A word will have to do. A
  few hours ago I was terrified lest I should lack the strength of this thing.
  I feared that I might have to kill you with my hands. Chance sent me the
  money to buy this," he added, patting the revolver; "a blessed chance. My
  curses on you, Stephen Carelton!"</p>

  <p>He raised the revolver and, pointing it deliberately at the other's head,
  pulled the trigger. There was an empty click. He tried once more. Again the
  fall of the hammer upon some unresponsive substance. Carelton, who had been
  paralyzed by the unexpectedness of the attack, sprang up and gripped his
  assailant's wrists so that the revolver fell on to the office table.</p>

  <p>"Harewood!" he exclaimed. "My God, are you mad?"</p>

  <p>Harewood answered nothing. He seemed suddenly turned into stone. The
  failure of his weapon was a thing uncontemplated&mdash;an unimaginable
  catastrophe. He suffered himself to be pushed back into his chair. Carelton
  looked at him wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"I know you now!" he exclaimed. "You are the man who picked up my
  sovereign in Pall Mall! Is that what you bought with it?" he asked, pointing
  to the revolver.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Harewood answered mechanically, "that and a meal. I wish I had
  never seen the sovereign. I should have killed you then, sure enough."</p>

  <p>The young man felt his forehead. He was scarcely surprised to discover
  that it was wet.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Harewood," he said, "if you had killed me you would have killed your
  son-in-law. I was married to Louise two years ago. I know that my father
  treated you badly, but I have done all that I can to make up for it. And so
  far as regards the business, why, I have been more successful than I deserved
  even. There's money for you and a new life, and there isn't one of your
  people, or even your old friends, who won't be glad to see you. There isn't a
  soul who hasn't come to the conclusion that your sentence was ridiculously
  severe, and for the last twelve months there has been quite a series of
  agitations for your release. It's your own fault that we haven't been able to
  let you know. We've tried every means in vain. One moment."</p>

  <p>He walked to the door of an inner room and called to somebody. Harewood
  pressed the barrel of the revolver against his own temple.</p>

  <p>"One of them must be good," he muttered.</p>

  <p>He pulled the trigger&mdash;again the empty click.</p>

  <p>"One more&mdash;the last one!" he whispered to himself, and stiffened his
  finger.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the weapon was wrenched from his hand. He turned swiftly round.
  The girl whom he had seen stepping from the carriage was there on her knees
  by his side; her arms were around his neck; marvellous, incredible words were
  pouring from her lips; her cheek, even her lips themselves were pressed to
  his. He rocked in his chair. There was a lump in his throat, burning fire
  behind his eyes. The years were falling away with the hot tears&mdash;nothing
  could stop them now. It was a nightmare which had passed...</p>

  <p>Carelton walked to the window which overlooked the square, with the
  revolver in his hand. He pulled the trigger idly. It went off at once with a
  loud report. He stood gazing at it in amazement&mdash;it was the fourth
  cartridge which had been good! Through the little cloud of smoke he seemed to
  see the sovereign lying in the gutter below.</p>

  </ul>
  <br>

  <p>The man looked up from his writing-table impatiently. Once more the door
  had opened and closed. He forgot even to be polite.</p>

  <p>"What the dickens do you want?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am your new secretary, Mr. Hardrow," the girl announced.</p>

  <p>He laid down his pen and looked at her. She was very neatly though
  shabbily dressed, and very pretty.</p>

  <p>"My new what?" he replied.</p>

  <p>"Secretary," she answered, calmly.</p>

  <p>"There's some mistake," he protested. "I haven't got a secretary; don't
  want one. I'm not looking for one."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"Pardon me, you do want one," she objected, firmly. "I arrived here an
  hour ago on quite different business, and found you were keeping no end of
  people waiting while you answered a few rubbishy letters yourself. Of course
  you want a secretary. A man who has just come back to England with a great
  fortune, and is getting invitations every minute, and visits from
  politicians, and all that sort of thing, must want a secretary. The only
  trouble seems to be that you did not know it. Shall I fetch my
  typewriter?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her steadfastly for several moments. Notwithstanding the trim
  sobriety of her toilet, she was a most attractive-looking young person. She
  met his gaze quite fearlessly, and seemed to be absolutely unconscious that
  there was anything at all unusual about her attitude.</p>

  <p>"What salary do you require?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She considered the subject briefly.</p>

  <p>"I get twenty-eight shillings a week at present," she said, "as I am a
  very rapid typist. You would doubtless be able to give more than that, but I
  am not sure how much. Suppose you give me thirty shillings a week for a
  month, and at the end of that time, if you keep me on, I expect I shall be
  worth a great deal more to you."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I should think it very probable," he agreed, pushing a pile of letters
  away from him with an obvious air of relief. "By the by, what is your
  name?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a moment, and there was something a little unconvincing
  about her statement.</p>

  <p>"Miss Robinson," she said.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, Miss Robinson," he continued, "you may as well get your
  typewriter, and I will leave these letters until you return. The people who
  are waiting outside had better be shown in&mdash;one at a time, of course.
  Will you leave word as you go out?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she answered. "I shall be back in less than an hour. By the
  by," she added, with a slight rush of colour to her cheeks, "would you mind
  advancing me two shillings?"</p>

  <p>"Two shillings!" he gasped. "Why, with pleasure! What for?"</p>

  <p>"To pay my cab," she told him, composedly. "It's Friday morning, you know,
  and I have spent my last week's salary. Thank you. I shall come back as
  quickly as I can."</p>

  <p>She went out, and Hardrow looked after her with amazement.</p>

  <p>"If she had asked for two pounds," he said to himself, "I should be pretty
  sure that she never meant turning up again. But two shillings! She is the
  most extraordinary young person&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In rather less than an hour Hardrow returned to his rooms after a
  temporary absence to find his new secretary already installed, carefully
  wiping the keys of her instrument. She had taken off her hat, and looked very
  neat and workmanlike.</p>

  <p>"Halloa! So you've come back?" he remarked, a little tritely.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," she answered. "If you are ready to give me down those
  letters, I shall be glad to have something to do. You can give them down in
  shorthand, if you like, but I am afraid I am not very quick."</p>

  <p>He frowned. A confession of incompetency from her seemed somehow out of
  place.</p>

  <p>"A secretary should be quick at everything," he grumbled.</p>

  <p>"Very likely I shall be able to take them down as fast as you are able to
  dictate them," she declared, with composure. "At any rate, we shall be
  through them in half the time you have been taking. Some of those, I should
  think," she added, glancing at the pile in his hand, "you can tell me what to
  say and leave the wording to me."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There are at least forty letters amongst this pile," he said, "asking for
  donations to some institution or another. You had better go through those and
  mark them according to your idea of their deserts. Begging letters you can
  destroy at once."</p>

  <p>"There is one here," she remarked, "from a man who says that he used to
  know you before you went abroad."</p>

  <p>He glanced it through.</p>

  <p>"Can't remember him," he declared. "Tear it up."</p>

  <p>"He seems in a very bad way," she said, doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Send him ten pounds, then!" Hardrow exclaimed, with a note of impatience
  in his voice. "By the by, there is an envelope there with the Stoke Pagnall
  post-mark."</p>

  <p>She knew very well where it was, and she slipped it underneath the
  rest.</p>

  <p>"I'll let you know when I come across it," she promised.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget," he said. "It's a begging letter, I suppose," he went on,
  carelessly, "but it comes from the place where I used to live before I went
  abroad. It's astonishing how people remember you when you've done well in the
  world, especially those who've made a mess of things themselves."</p>

  <p>She bent a little lower over the machine. There was a dull streak of
  colour in her cheeks of which, however, he remained unconscious. If he had
  only known it, he had effectually destroyed all chances of ever seeing the
  contents of the letter in question.</p>

  <p>"The invitations?" he said, dubiously. "Well, I scarcely know what to do
  about them. They're a hideous nuisance."</p>

  <p>"I will get a plain calendar," she suggested, "and write them all in on
  the proper dates. Then you can just put your pencil through those you wish to
  refuse and a tick against those I am to accept."</p>

  <p>"Good idea," he answered. "Excellent! I am going out now. I shall be back
  at four o'clock. You had better ring the bell and order lunch up here when
  you want some."</p>

  <p>"Before you go," she said, looking fixedly at the sheet of paper which she
  had thrust into her machine, "I think that I ought to tell you
  something."</p>

  <p>He stopped short in his journey toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She went on without looking at him.</p>

  <p>"I told you that I had been getting twenty-eight shillings a week. It
  wasn't exactly true. It was what I wanted; but I have never had a permanent
  situation."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that that matters," he answered. "You're engaged to me,
  anyhow, for a month at thirty shillings a week."</p>

  <p>"And then as regards references?" she continued.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't bother me about trifles," he answered, turning abruptly away.
  "I'll take you on spec."</p>

  <p>Miss Robinson went home that night with a smile playing around her lips
  and an entire absence of that strained look about the eyes with which she had
  commenced the day. She rode on top of a bus to Camberwell, and afterwards
  walked briskly for a quarter of an hour. She soon arrived at a tiny cottage
  at the end of a row&mdash;little creations of brick and mortar, all
  brand-new, which seemed as though they had come out of a German toy-box, and
  the road to which was as yet barely made. The front door, which she could
  easily reach from the street, opened into a sitting room, where she was
  welcomed with a shriek of delight by a very much smaller edition of
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Mary, is it all right?" the child exclaimed. "Did you find him, and is he
  nice? Do tell me! And I'm so hungry!"</p>

  <p>Miss Robinson smiled, and the sigh of relief which followed came from the
  bottom of her heart.</p>

  <p>"It's absolutely all right, dear," she answered, kissing the child.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what he was like, and everything about him!" the latter
  exclaimed. "Did he recognize you? What did he say? And when shall I see him?
  Is he coming here?"</p>

  <p>Miss Robinson looked for a moment grave.</p>

  <p>"Nora, dear," she said, "to tell you the honest truth, he hasn't any idea
  who I am. He didn't recognize me and he hadn't even opened my letter. When I
  found myself in the room and saw that he didn't know who I was, I simply
  couldn't tell him. I engaged myself to him as his secretary instead."</p>

  <p>The child clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>"How clever!" she exclaimed. "Did he mind?"</p>

  <p>Miss Robinson laughed outright. It could not have been for vanity, because
  there was no one there to see, but her laugh certainly made her appear an
  extraordinarily attractive young woman.</p>

  <p>"I rather took him by storm, I'm afraid," she confessed, throwing off her
  hat, "but I can see that I am going to be exceedingly useful to him. He was
  trying to deal with his correspondence himself, without a typist or anything.
  I was only just in time. It absolutely must have occurred either to him or to
  someone else, before the day was over, that he needed a secretary."</p>

  <p>"But what fun his not recognizing you, Mary!" the child exclaimed, "and
  all the time you know who he was and all about him."</p>

  <p>Miss Robinson turned away and hid her head in a cupboard. The humour of
  this non-recognition seemed scarcely to appeal to her; in fact, her lip had
  quivered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Now, I'm just going to make one cup of tea," she said, "and then I'll go
  out and get something to eat."</p>

  <p>"But have you any money, Mary?" the child asked.</p>

  <p>Miss Robinson looked searchingly around the sitting-room. Her eyes rested
  upon a little water-colour&mdash;their last&mdash;and she sighed.</p>

  <p>"We soon shall have," she declared, cheerfully. "To-morrow I am going to
  ask him to pay me a week's money in advance. I've had to borrow two shillings
  already to get my machine taken up on a barrow. I told him a cab, because it
  sounded better."</p>

  <p>The child looked perplexed.</p>

  <p>"But why don't you tell him, Mary, who you are and all about us? I believe
  he'd give you a great deal more money. You always said that he was such a
  nice boy."</p>

  <p>Miss Robinson let her hand rest for a moment on her sister's head.</p>

  <p>"Dear," she said, "you are wonderfully wise for your years, but there are
  some things which you cannot understand, and this is one of them. Unless Mr.
  Hardrow finds out for himself, I would rather not tell him."</p>

  <p>The child sighed and remained puzzled. She was only nine years old, but
  life had already shown her something of its complex side. The change from a
  comfortable country house, with large gardens and plenty of young friends, to
  a cottage on the outskirts of London at two shillings a week, with no
  servant, a few scraps of furniture, sometimes barely enough to eat, sometimes
  a grim suspicion that Mary had less even than she, was a change such as could
  scarcely fail to leave its mark. Somehow or other she had looked forward to
  Hardrow's return as likely to alter all this. He was to have been the fairy
  prince who provided all manner of desirable things. On the whole, she was a
  little disappointed with her sister's visit.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, wistfully, "I hope he finds out."</p>

  <p>Miss Robinson laughed.</p>

  <p>"If he doesn't," she declared bravely, "we are going to have quite a good
  time now. Thirty shillings a week! One can do a great deal with thirty
  shillings a week. You must go to school&mdash;even if it is only a very tiny
  school&mdash;in the mornings. And perhaps, later on, we may be able to take a
  cottage out in the country."</p>

  <p>"Supposing," the child asked, shrewdly, "Mr. Hardrow goes back to Africa
  and doesn't want you any more?"</p>

  <p>Miss Robinson was a little disturbed at the thought, but she only
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"He'll want me, right enough," she declared. "I'm going to make myself so
  useful that he won't be able to do without me."</p>

  <p>In a sense, her words undoubtedly came true. Hardrow scarcely realised
  even himself how much easier the days went because of her rigorous
  supervision of his affairs. He was always seeking her advice, too, and
  continually adopting it. One day he leaned back from a mass of correspondence
  with a perplexed frown upon his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Stop that for a moment, Miss Robinson," he said. "I want to ask you
  something."</p>

  <p>She ceased her work and turned around on her stool.</p>

  <p>"You know that I have been refusing all invitations of a certain sort," he
  began. "I find that I shall have to change my front. It is necessary for me
  to go into society more or less. Some of my schemes&mdash;one in
  particular&mdash;must be pushed by people who have influence there."</p>

  <p>She nodded and touched the keys of her instrument carelessly.</p>

  <p>"There is not much difficulty about that," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," he admitted; "but I have got out of the way of it. I've
  lived in the open air too long, in wooden shanties or in a tent, fed out of
  tin things, cooked for myself, and played the boor generally. I want
  civilizing. How should you start about it?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him critically.</p>

  <p>"I should take off that ugly beard of yours," she declared.</p>

  <p>He stroked it for a moment, and looked at himself in the glass.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right," he admitted. "Anyhow, there's no need to keep
  the thing over here. Telephone down for the barber, please. Anything
  else?"</p>

  <p>"You don't dress very well," she told him.</p>

  <p>"Hang it all!" he objected. "I went to the best tailor in London."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I can see you there," she said, with a faint smile at the corner
  of her lips. "You probably marched into the place, caught hold of
  half-a-dozen bales of cloth, told them to make you a suit of each, and came
  out again in about three minutes."</p>

  <p>"Just what I did," he agreed. "What do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"Let the tailor choose for you, if he's a good one," she answered, "and
  ask him about the ties and shirts to go with the clothes he sends you."</p>

  <p>"You're a jewel," he declared; "I'll do it. And you'd better accept those
  last five or six invitations I gave you."</p>

  <p>Thenceforth Miss Robinson saw a deal less of her employer. Vastly improved
  in his bearing, he became quite a popular figure at a great many social
  gatherings. The appearance, toward the end of a rather dull London season, of
  a good-looking bachelor, who was reputed to be a millionaire, and who had
  acquired his wealth in an exceedingly romantic fashion, was almost a godsend.
  Invitations came faster and faster, so that even Hardrow, whose energy was
  boundless and whose zest for this new amusement extraordinary, found it
  impossible to keep pace with them. Nevertheless, he managed fairly well, and
  kept in touch, too, with his affairs in the City. One day he suddenly
  realized how invaluable Miss Robinson was to him. He turned abruptly in the
  act of leaving the room.</p>

  <p>"Miss Robinson," he said, "I don't know what I should do without you."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you would," she agreed.</p>

  <p>"Our month has been up for some time," he continued. "Please double your
  salary."</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged," she answered, with beating heart. "Do you mean
  really double it?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he declared. "You're very cheap at that."</p>

  <p>He stood looking down at her. It seemed to him that he had forgotten for
  weeks how pretty she was. Her slim figure, too, looked at its best in the
  absolutely plain, tight-fitting black dress that she wore at her work. Her
  hand was resting upon the table. He took it up and held it in his. She
  snatched it away.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hardrow!" she exclaimed, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>He laughed, and looked at her for a moment as though half deriding her
  agitation. Just then there was a knock at the door. He turned away. In a few
  minutes he left the room with his visitor, and when he reappeared the
  incident seemed to have escaped his memory.</p>

  <p>Hardrow was by no means a bad fellow, but he was more or less what is
  usually described as being a man of the world. If Miss Robinson had been a
  trifle less good-looking, or the fascination of her quiet, demure speech a
  little less apparent, he would probably, in a few weeks more, have forgotten
  that she was a woman at all, and looked upon her as a very excellent part of
  his well-ordered life, whose use to him was purely a mechanical one.
  Unfortunately, she forgot one morning the strict control which she usually
  kept over her features, and laughed at some remark of his in perfectly
  dazzling fashion. Perhaps he considered the few words which she flung out,
  the quick upward glance which came naturally enough at that moment, as an
  invitation. At any rate, he stooped and kissed her. For a moment she seemed
  almost passive. Then she rose slowly to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hardrow&mdash;" she began, with trembling voice.</p>

  <p>He took her face between his hands and kissed her again.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a goose!" he exclaimed, and went out.</p>

  <p>When he came back she was gone. Not only had she departed, but she had
  taken her typewriter with her. Upon his desk was a neat little statement of
  her account and a little pile of money, from which he noticed that, although
  it was Friday morning, she had omitted to draw any salary for the week. For
  several minutes he stood and swore profusely. He remembered with dismay that
  he did not know her address. His servant, whom he summoned at once, was
  equally ignorant of it. He dashed off two advertisements to the evening
  papers, commanding&mdash;begging for her return. He even sought out for
  himself the hall-porter of the residential hotel in which his quarters were
  situated, and endeavoured to discover whether in her comings and goings she
  had ever left any trace of her abode. But the suburb in which Miss Robinson
  lived was a very long way from Mayfair, and she certainly had no money now to
  spend in evening papers. The days passed by and he heard nothing. He
  advertised for a temporary secretary and selected a young man, who robbed
  him; replaced him with another, who was honest but stupid; and finally,
  leaving him behind to mismanage his affairs, went off to Scotland in
  disgust.</p>

  <p>And in the meantime things went very ill indeed for Miss Robinson.
  Naturally of a sanguine disposition, and over-anxious to provide once more
  the necessary comforts for the child whom she loved so dearly, she found that
  she had saved very little. Early the next morning she recommenced the search
  for work in which she had been engaged when she read of the return of Mr.
  Hardrow to his native land and paid him that eventful visit. Alas! the search
  was no more successful than it had been before. Never, it seemed, were there
  so many typists wanting situations; never so few people who wanted typing
  done. The child Nora, too, was fretful and pale. The summer had been a long
  one and hotter than usual. In a week's time Miss Robinson had made up her
  mind to ask her employer for a fortnight's holiday, and to have taken the
  child into the country. All that, of course, was out of the question now.
  There was no holiday because there was no work to take a holiday from. And no
  work came. September passed away, and the tiny house was barer than ever.
  Nora was becoming alarmingly thin and often peevish. She was never tired of
  asking what had become of fir. Hardrow, why Mary had left, why she did not go
  back and ask him to help her find another place.</p>

  <p>At last the time came when the rent was not forthcoming. With a little sob
  Miss Robinson put her pride in her pocket and walked to Mayfair. Mr. Hardrow
  was still away, she was told, travelling on the Continent. His secretary was
  upstairs in his rooms, and she could go up if she chose. She presented
  herself at the familiar door and, knocking timidly, turned the handle. She
  was a very different-looking person to the trim young woman who had taken Mr.
  Hardrow by storm a few months ago. Her clothes were worse than shabby now.
  She was much paler, her cheeks were hollow, and her eyes had lost all their
  brightness. The immaculate young man who occupied her former position
  scrutinized her closely though his eyeglass, and formed by no means a
  favourable opinion of her or of her errand.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hardrow is away," he announced, in reply to her inquiry. "It is quite
  impossible to say when he will be back in London."</p>

  <p>"Will you give me his address, please?" Miss Robinson asked.</p>

  <p>The young man dropped his eyeglass and stroked his chin.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" he declared. "Mr. Hardrow is away for a holiday. He gets too
  much&mdash;er&mdash;correspondence and that sort of thing when he is in
  England."</p>

  <p>"Will you send on a note to him?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>The young man was bored, and showed it.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hardrow does not wish letters forwarded," he said. "Do you mind
  closing the door as you go out?"</p>

  <p>As Miss Robinson stepped out of the lift and passed from the hotel a new
  fear came to her. The streets and buildings seemed, somehow, strange. There
  was a pain in her head. Her knees shook so that people stared at her, and for
  a moment she had even to clutch at a lamp-post. She told herself that this
  was madness. If she were to give in now, what would happen? Then she
  remembered that she had had very little food that day, and less still the day
  before. She entered a shop, and, though her heart ached to part with it, she
  laid down sixpence and ordered some milk and a bun. Afterwards she walked
  back to Camberwell&mdash;a long walk and not a very cheerful one. Nora met
  her with red eyes. The man had called again for the rent and had been very
  rude. The child was trembling and obviously terrified.</p>

  <p>"Mary, dear," she cried, "we must get some money! We must! Is there no one
  we can write to?"</p>

  <p>"We've tried everyone," Mary reminded her, sinking into a chair. "I don't
  know, just for the moment, what there is that we can do."</p>

  <p>"I know that I am very hungry!" the child exclaimed, bursting into
  tears.</p>

  <p>It was the last blow. The room went suddenly round, and the rumbling in
  her ears became like thunder. Mary was unconscious for nearly an hour. When
  she recovered, the child was still by her side, almost in an agony of
  terror.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mary, Mary!" she cried. "What are we to do? You're going to be ill,
  I'm sure! I'm so frightened!"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to be nothing of the sort," Miss Robinson declared. "I was just
  a little tired. You'll find three pence in my pocket. Do stop that milkman
  and buy three-penny worth of milk for your supper. Afterwards, we'll go to
  bed."</p>

  <p>The child sighed.</p>

  <p>"I should like something to eat," she murmured. "I'm so tired of milk, and
  so hungry."</p>

  <p>They went to bed, and Nora, at any rate, slept. Mary lay awake most of the
  night, with hot eyes and a pain at her heart.</p>

  <p>She got up in the morning, trembling a little and terrified. Before midday
  they were in the streets and the key turned against them. Their few remaining
  scraps of furniture would never pay the rent that was owing. The typewriter
  had long ago gone. Mary made a supreme effort.</p>

  <p>"This must be the worst that can happen to us, dear," she said to Nora.
  "We'll go somewhere and sit down, and I'm sure we shall be able to think of
  something."</p>

  <p>The child was half terrified, half starved. They walked wearily from the
  first&mdash;footsore and tired to death before they arrived at their
  destination. Somehow or other, they reached the Embankment and sank down upon
  one of the seats, and a few minutes later, though he was supposed to be on
  the Continent, Hardrow came along taking his first lesson at driving his new
  motor-car. By chance she turned and saw him, and, staggering to her feet,
  came out into the road, waving her hand. He barely escaped running over her,
  and the chauffeur shouted angrily. Just at that moment, however, Hardrow
  recognized her and sprang from the car.</p>

  <p>"Miss Robinson!" he exclaimed, and suddenly took it all in. "Good
  heavens!"</p>

  </div>

  <p>She had meant to greet him with, at any rate, some attempt at dignity, to
  explain that a series of misfortunes of a temporary character had placed her
  in a very uncomfortable position&mdash;any rubbish so that she might have
  looked him in the face and held her own in words at least. But it was all of
  no use and all quite unnecessary. The faces of the two girls told their own
  story with pitiless truth. In a minute or two she found herself in the back
  of the car, with Nora by her side holding her fingers tightly. Hardrow
  relinquished his place at the wheel and ordered the chauffeur to drive to
  some restaurant.</p>
