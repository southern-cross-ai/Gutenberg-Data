<p class="cp">
<i>He told how murders walk the earth<br>
Beneath the curse of Cain,<br>
With crimson clouds before their eyes<br>
And flames about their brain:<br>
For blood has left upon their souls<br>
Its everlasting stain.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:55%">&mdash;Hood.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THERE are two roads to Torkertown. One, the
shorter and more direct route, leads across a barren upland moor,
and the other, which is much longer, winds its tortuous way in and
out among the hummocks and quagmires of the swamps, skirting the
low hills to the east. It was a dangerous and tedious trail; so
Solomon Kane halted in amazement when a breathless youth from the
village he had just left, overtook him and implored him for God's
sake to take the swamp road.</p>

<p>"The swamp road!" Kane stared at the boy.</p>

<p>He was a tall, gaunt man, was Solomon Kane, his darkly pallid
face and deep brooding eyes, made more sombre by the drab
Puritanical garb he affected.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, 'tis far safer," the youngster answered to his
surprised exclamation.</p>

<p>"Then the moor road must be haunted by Satan himself, for your
townsmen warned me against traversing the other."</p>

<p>"Because of the quagmires, sir, that you might not see in the
dark. You had better return to the village and continue your
journey in the morning, sir."</p>

<p>"Taking the swamp road?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Kane shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.</p>

<p>"The moon rises almost as soon as twilight dies. By its light I can reach Torkertown in a few hours, across the moor."</p>

<p>"Sir, you had better not. No one ever goes that way. There are
no houses at all upon the moor, while in the swamp there is the
house of old Ezra who lives there all alone since his maniac
cousin, Gideon, wandered off and died in the swamp and was never
found&mdash;and old Ezra though a miser would not refuse you
lodging should you decide to stop until morning. Since you must go,
you had better go the swamp road."</p>

<p>Kane eyed the boy piercingly. The lad squirmed and shuffled his
feet.</p>

<p>"Since this moor road is so dour to wayfarers," said the
Puritan, "why did not the villagers tell me the whole tale, instead
of vague mouthings?"</p>

<p>"Men like not to talk of it, sir. We hoped that you would take
the swamp road after the men advised you to, but when we watched
and saw that you turned not at the forks, they sent me to run after
you and beg you to reconsider."</p>

<p>"Name of the Devil!" exclaimed Kane sharply, the unaccustomed
oath showing his irritation; "the swamp road and the moor
road&mdash;what is it that threatens me and why should I go miles
out of my way and risk the bogs and mires?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said the boy, dropping his voice and drawing closer, "we
be simple villagers who like not to talk of such things lest foul
fortune befall us, but the moor road is a way accurst and hath not
been traversed by any of the countryside for a year or more. It is
death to walk those moors by night, as hath been found by some
score of unfortunates. Some foul horror haunts the way and claims
men for his victims."</p>

<p>"So? And what is this thing like?"</p>

<p>"No man knows. None has ever seen it and lived, but late-farers
have heard terrible laughter far out on the fen and men have heard
the horrid shrieks of its victims. Sir, in God's name return to the
village, there pass the night, and tomorrow take the swamp trail to
Torkertown."</p>

<p>Far back in Kane's gloomy eyes a scintillant light had begun to
glimmer, like a witch's torch glinting under fathoms of cold grey
ice. His blood quickened. Adventure! The lure of life-risk and
drama! Not that Kane recognized his sensations as such. He
sincerely considered that he voiced his real feelings when he
said:</p>

<p>"These things be deeds of some power of evil. The lords of
darkness have laid a curse upon the country. A strong man is needed
to combat Satan and his might. Therefore I go, who have defied him
many a time."</p>

<p>"Sir," the boy began, then closed his mouth as he saw the
futility of argument. He only added, "The corpses of the victims
are bruised and torn, sir."</p>

<p>He stood there at the crossroads, sighing regretfully as he
watched the tall, rangy figure swinging up the road that led toward
the moors.</p>


<p><br>
THE sun was setting as Kane came over the brow of the low hill
which debouched into the upland fen. Huge and blood-red it sank
down behind the sullen horizon of the moors, seeming to touch the
rank grass with fire; so for a moment the watcher seemed to be
gazing out across a sea of blood. Then the dark shadows came
gliding from the east, the western blaze faded, and Solomon Kane
struck out, boldly in the gathering darkness.</p>

<p>The road was dim from disuse but was clearly defined. Kane went
swiftly but warily, sword and pistols at hand. Stars blinked out
and night winds whispered among the grass like weeping spectres.
The moon began to rise, lean and haggard, like a skull among the
stars.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Kane stopped short. From somewhere in front of him
sounded a strange and eery echo&mdash;or something like an echo.
Again, this time louder. Kane started forward again. Were his
senses deceiving him? No!</p>

<p>Far out, there pealed a whisper of frightful laughter. And
again, closer this time. No human being ever laughed like
that&mdash;there was no mirth in it, only hatred and horror and
soul-destroying terror. Kane halted. He was not afraid, but for the
second he was almost unnerved. Then, stabbing through that awesome
laughter, came the sound of a scream that was undoubtedly human.
Kane started forward, increasing his gait. He cursed the illusive
lights and flickering shadows which veiled the moor in the rising
moon and made accurate sight impossible. The laughter continued,
growing louder, as did the screams. Then sounded faintly the drum
of frantic human feet. Kane broke into a run.</p>

<p>Some human was being hunted to death out there on the fen, and
by what manner of horror God only knew. The sound of the flying
feet halted abruptly and the screaming rose unbearably, mingled
with other sounds unnameable and hideous. Evidently the man had
been overtaken, and Kane, his flesh crawling, visualized some
ghastly fiend of the darkness crouching on the back of its
victim&mdash;crouching and tearing.</p>

<p>Then the noise of a terrible and short struggle came clearly
through the abysmal silence of the night and the footfalls began
again, but stumbling and uneven. The screaming continued, but with
a gasping gurgle. The sweat stood cold on Kane's forehead and body.
This was heaping horror on horror in an intolerable manner.</p>

<p>God, for a moment's clear light! The frightful drama was being
enacted within a very short distance of him, to judge by the ease
with which the sounds reached him. But this hellish half-light
veiled all in shifting shadows, so that the moors appeared a haze
of blurred illusions, and stunted trees and bushes seemed like
giants.</p>

<p>Kane shouted, striving to increase the speed of his advance. The
shrieks of the unknown broke into a hideous shrill squealing; again
there was the sound of a struggle, and then from the shadows of the
tall grass a thing came reeling&mdash;a thing that had once been a
man&mdash;a gore-covered, frightful thing that fell at Kane's feet
and writhed and grovelled and raised its terrible face to the
rising moon, and gibbered and yammered, and fell down again and
died in its own blood.</p>

<p>The moon was up now and the light was better. Kane bent above
the body, which lay stark in its unnameable mutilation, and he
shuddered&mdash;a rare thing for him, who had seen the deeds of the
Spanish Inquisition and the witch-finders.</p>

<p>Some wayfarer, he supposed. Then like a hand of ice on his spine
he was aware that he was not alone. He looked up, his cold eyes
piercing the shadows whence the dead man had staggered. He saw
nothing, but he knew&mdash;he felt&mdash;that other eyes gave back
his stare, terrible eyes not of this earth. He straightened and
drew a pistol, waiting. The moonlight spread like a lake of pale
blood over the moor, and trees and grasses took on their proper
sizes.</p>

<p>The shadows melted, and Kane saw! At first he thought it only a
shadow of mist, a wisp of moor fog that swayed in the tall grass
before him. He gazed. More illusion, he thought. Then the thing
began to take on shape, vague and indistinct. Two hideous eyes
flamed at him&mdash;eyes which held all the stark horror which has
been the heritage of man since the fearful dawn ages&mdash;eyes
frightful and insane, with an insanity transcending earthly
insanity. The form of the thing was misty and vague, a
brain-shattering travesty on the human form, like, yet horribly
unlike. The grass and bushes beyond showed clearly through it.</p>

<p>Kane felt the blood pound in his temples, yet he was as cold as
ice. How such an unstable being as that which wavered before him
could harm a man in a physical way was more than he could
understand, yet the red horror at his feet gave mute testimony that
the fiend could act with terrible material effect.</p>

<p>Of one thing Kane was sure; there would be no hunting of him
across the dreary moors, no screaming and fleeing to be dragged
down again and again. If he must die he would die in his tracks,
his wounds in front.</p>

<p>Now a vague and grisly mouth gaped wide and the demoniac
laughter again shrieked out, soul-shaking in its nearness. And in
the midst of that threat of doom, Kane deliberately levelled his
long pistol and fired. A maniacal yell of rage and mockery answered
the report, and the thing came at him like a flying sheet of smoke,
long shadowy arms stretched to drag him down.</p>

<p>Kane, moving with the dynamic speed of a famished wolf, fired
the second pistol with as little effect, snatched his long rapier
from its sheath and thrust into the centre of the misty attacker.
The blade sang as it passed clear through, encountering no solid
resistance, and Kane felt icy fingers grip his limbs, bestial
talons tear his garments and the skin beneath.</p>

<p>He dropped the useless sword and sought to grapple with his foe.
It was like fighting a floating mist, a flying shadow armed with
daggerlike claws. His savage blows met empty air, his leanly mighty
arms, in whose grasp strong men had died, swept nothingness and
clutched emptiness. Naught was solid or real save the flaying,
apelike fingers with their crooked talons, and the crazy eyes which
burned into the shuddering depths of his soul.</p>

<p>Kane realized that he was in a desperate plight indeed. Already
his garments hung in tatters and he bled from a score of deep
wounds. But he never flinched, and the thought of flight never
entered his mind. He had never fled from a single foe, and had the
thought occurred to him he would have flushed with shame.</p>

<p>He saw no help for it now, but that his form should lie there
beside the fragments of the other victim, but the thought held no
terrors for him. His only wish was to give as good an account of
himself as possible before the end came, and if he could, to
inflict some damage on his unearthly foe.</p>

<p>There above the dead man's torn body, man fought with demon
under the pale light of the rising moon, with all the advantages
with the demon, save one. And that one was enough to overcome the
others. For if abstract hate may bring into material substance a
ghostly thing, may not courage, equally abstract, form a concrete
weapon to combat that ghost?</p>

<p>Kane fought with his arms and his feet and his hands, and he was
aware at last that the ghost began to give back before him, and the
fearful laughter changed to screams of baffled fury. For man's only
weapon is courage that flinches not from the gates of Hell itself,
and against such not even the legions of Hell can stand.</p>

<p>Of this Kane knew nothing; he only knew that the talons which
tore and rended him seemed to grow weaker and wavering, that a wild
light grew and grew in the horrible eyes. And reeling and gasping,
he rushed in, grappled the thing at last and threw it, and as they
tumbled about on the moor and it writhed and lapped his limbs like
a serpent of smoke, his flesh crawled and his hair stood on end,
for he began to understand its gibbering.</p>

<p>He did not hear and comprehend as a man hears and comprehends
the speech of a man, but the frightful secrets it imparted in
whisperings and yammerings and screaming silences sank fingers of
ice into his soul, and he <i>knew</i>.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="first">THE HUT of old Ezra the miser stood by the road in
the midst of the swamp, half screened by the sullen trees which
grew about it. The walls were rotting, the roof crumbling, and
great pallid and green fungus-monsters clung to it and writhed
about the doors and windows, as if seeking to peer within. The
trees leaned above it and their grey branches intertwined so that
it crouched in semi-darkness like a monstrous dwarf over whose
shoulder ogres leer.</p>

<p>The road, which wound down into the swamp among rotting stumps
and rank hummocks and scummy, snake-haunted pools and bogs, crawled
past the hut. Many people passed that way these days, but few saw
old Ezra, save a glimpse of a yellow face, peering through the
fungus-screened windows, itself like an ugly fungus.</p>

<p>Old Ezra the miser partook much of the quality of the swamp, for
he was gnarled and bent and sullen; his fingers were like clutching
parasitic plants and his locks hung like drab moss above eyes
trained to the murk of the swamplands. His eyes were like a dead
man's, yet hinted of depths abysmal and loathsome as the dead lakes
of the swamplands.</p>

<p>These eyes gleamed now at the man who stood in front of his hut.
This man was tall and gaunt and dark, his face was haggard and
claw-marked, and he was bandaged of arm and leg. Somewhat behind
this man stood a number of villagers.</p>

<p>"You are Ezra of the swamp road?"</p>

<p>"Aye, and what want ye of me?"</p>

<p>"Where is your cousin Gideon, the maniac youth who abode with
you?"</p>

<p>"Gideon?"</p>

<p>"Aye."</p>

<p>"He wandered away into the swamp and never came back. No doubt
he lost his way and was set upon by wolves or died in a quagmire or
was struck by an adder."</p>

<p>"How long ago?"</p>

<p>"Over a year."</p>

<p>"Aye. Hark ye, Ezra the miser. Soon after your cousin's
disappearance, a countryman, coming home across the moors, was set
upon by some unknown fiend and torn to pieces, and thereafter it
became death to cross those moors. First men of the countryside,
then strangers who wandered over the fen, fell to the clutches of
the thing. Many men have died, since the first one.</p>

<p>"Last night I crossed the moors, and heard the flight and
pursuing of another victim, a stranger who knew not the evil of the
moors. Ezra the miser, it was a fearful thing, for the wretch twice
broke from the fiend, terribly wounded, and each time the demon
caught and dragged him down again. And at last he fell dead at my
very feet, done to death in a manner that would freeze the statue
of a saint."</p>

<p>The villagers moved restlessly and murmured fearfully to each
other, and old Ezra's eyes shifted furtively. Yet the sombre
expression of Solomon Kane never altered, and his condor-like stare
seemed to transfix the miser.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" muttered old Ezra hurriedly; "a bad thing, a bad
thing! Yet why do you tell this thing to me?"</p>

<p>"Aye, a sad thing. Harken further, Ezra. The fiend came out of
the shadows and I fought with it over the body of its victim. Aye,
how I overcame it, I know not, for the battle was hard and long but
the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier
than the powers of Hell.</p>

<p>"At the last I was stronger, and it broke from me and fled, and
I followed to no avail. Yet before it fled it whispered to me a
monstrous truth."</p>

<p>Old Ezra started, stared wildly, seemed to shrink into
himself.</p>

<p>"Nay, why tell me this?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"I returned to the village and told my tale," said Kane, "for I
knew that now I had the power to rid the moors of its curse
forever. Ezra, come with us!"</p>

<p>"Where?" gasped the miser.</p>

<p>"<i>To the rotting oak on the moors.</i>"</p>

<p>Ezra reeled as though struck; he screamed incoherently and
turned to flee.</p>

<p>On the instant, at Kane's sharp order, two brawny villagers
sprang forward and seized the miser. They twisted the dagger from
his withered hand, and pinioned his arms, shuddering as their
fingers encountered his clammy flesh.</p>

<p>Kane motioned them to follow, and turning strode up the trail,
followed by the villagers, who found their strength taxed to the
utmost in their task of bearing their prisoner along. Through the
swamp they went and out, taking a little-used trail which led up
over the low hills and out on the moors.</p>

<p><br>
THE sun was sliding down the horizon and old Ezra stared at it
with bulging eyes&mdash;stared as if he could not gaze enough. Far
out on the moors reared up the great oak tree, like a gibbet, now
only a decaying shell. There Solomon Kane halted.</p>

<p>Old Ezra writhed in his captor's grasp and made inarticulate
noises.</p>

<p>"Over a year ago," said Solomon Kane, "you, fearing that your
insane cousin Gideon would tell men of your cruelties to him,
brought him away from the swamp by the very trail by which we came,
and murdered him here in the night."</p>

<p>Ezra cringed and snarled.</p>

<p>"You cannot prove this lie!"</p>

<p>Kane spoke a few words to an agile villager. The youth clambered
up the rotting bole of the tree and from a crevice, high up,
dragged something that fell with a clatter at the feet of the
miser. Ezra went limp with a terrible shriek.</p>

<p>The object was a man's skeleton, the skull cleft.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;how knew you this? You are Satan!" gibbered old
Ezra.</p>

<p>Kane folded his arms.</p>

<p>"The thing I fought last night told me this thing as we reeled
in battle, and I followed it to this tree. <i>For the fiend is
Gideon's ghost.</i>"</p>

<p>Ezra shrieked again and fought savagely.</p>

<p>"You knew," said Kane sombrely, "you knew what thing did these
deeds. You feared the ghost of the maniac, and that is why you
chose to leave his body on the fen instead of concealing it in the
swamp. For you knew the ghost would haunt the place of his death.
He was insane in life, and in death he did not know where to find
his slayer; else he had come to you in your hut. He hates no man
but you, but his mazed spirit cannot tell one man from another, and
he slays all, lest he let his killer escape. Yet he will know you
and rest in peace forever after. Hate hath made of his ghost a
solid thing that can rend and slay, and though he feared you
terribly in life, in death he fears you not at all."</p>

<p>Kane halted. He glanced at the sun.</p>

<p>"All this I had from Gideon's ghost, in his yammerings and his
whisperings and his shrieking silences. Naught but your death will
lay that ghost."</p>

<p>Ezra listened in breathless silence and Kane pronounced the
words of his doom.</p>

<p>"A hard thing it is," said Kane sombrely, "to sentence a man to
death in cold blood and in such a manner as I have in mind, but you
must die that others may live&mdash;and God knoweth you deserve
death.</p>

<p>"You shall not die by noose, bullet or sword, but at the talons
of him you slew&mdash;for naught else will satiate him."</p>

<p>At these words Ezra's brain shattered, his knees gave way and he
fell grovelling and screaming for death, begging them to burn him
at the stake, to flay him alive. Kane's face was set like death,
and the villagers, the fear rousing their cruelty, bound the
screeching wretch to the oak tree, and one of them bade him make
his peace with God. But Ezra made no answer, shrieking in a high
shrill voice with unbearable monotony. Then the villager would have
struck the miser across the face, but Kane stayed him.</p>

<p>"Let him make his peace with Satan, whom he is more like to
meet," said the Puritan grimly. "The sun is about to set. Loose his
cords so that he may work loose by dark, since it is better to meet
death free and unshackled than bound like a sacrifice."</p>

<p>As they turned to leave him, old Ezra yammered and gibbered
unhuman sounds and then fell silent, staring at the sun with
terrible intensity.</p>

<p>They walked away across the fen, and Kane flung a last look at
the grotesque form bound to the tree, seeming in the uncertain
light like a great fungus growing to the bole. And suddenly the
miser screamed hideously:</p>

<p>"Death! Death! There are skulls in the tars!"</p>

<p>"Life was good to him, though he was gnarled and churlish and
evil," Kane sighed. "Mayhap God has a place for such souls where
fire and sacrifice may cleanse them of their dross as fire cleans
the forest of fungus things. Yet my heart is heavy within me."</p>

<p>"Nay, sir," one of the villagers spoke, "you have done but the
will of God, and good alone shall come of this night's deed."</p>

<p>"Nay," answered Kane heavily. "I know not&mdash;I know not."</p>

<p><br>
THE sun had gone down and night spread with amazing swiftness,
as if great shadows came rushing down from unknown voids to cloak
the world with hurrying darkness. Through the thick night came a
weird echo, and the men halted and looked back the way they had
come.</p>

<p>Nothing could be seen. The moor was an ocean of shadows and the
tall grass about them bent in long waves before the faint wind,
breaking the deathly stillness with breathless murmurings.</p>

<p>Then far away the red disk of the moon rose over the fen, and
for an instant a grim silhouette was etched blackly against it. A
shape came flying across the face of the moon&mdash;a bent,
grotesque thing whose feet seemed scarcely to touch the earth; and
close behind came a thing like a flying shadow&mdash;a nameless,
shapeless horror.</p>

<p>A moment the racing twain stood out boldly against the moon;
then they merged into one unnameable, formless mass, and vanished
in the shadows.</p>

<p>Far across the fen sounded a single shriek of terrible
laughter.</p>
