  <h2><a id="story1-1"
     name="story1-1"></a>I. &mdash; THE CASE OF LADY PURSEYENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">TWO years ago I received a letter signed Olga Purseyence
  asking me if I would give the lady an interview on a certain date at a
  certain hour. I looked up the lady's credentials in my books of reference,
  and found that she was the widow of Sir George Purseyence, and I wrote back
  fixing the time and date.</p>

  <p>Now, I daresay "Lady Olga Purseyence" suggests to you a tall, willowy,
  refined-looking lady with sad dark eyes. That is the picture I got of her,
  and I was very much surprised to find a very stout, dumpy woman,
  coarse-featured and heavy-eyed. When she opened her mouth the final illusion
  was gone. She had the vilest Cockney accent, and insisted throughout our
  interview in referring to me as "young man",</p>

  <p>I learnt afterwards that she was the third wife of the eccentric baronet,
  and that she had been his cook-housekeeper for ten years before, in a moment
  of mental aberration, he took her to wife. Her original name had been Mary
  Ann Sopper, and "Olga" was quite a new creation, having been decided upon by
  her after her husband's death. I expect she got the name from a novel, but
  that is by the way.</p>

  <p>She started pretty badly from my point of view.</p>

  <p>"I wish you to understand, young man," she said, planting herself squarely
  in the armchair which I had pushed forward for her, "that I don't believe in
  private, detectives. I never did and I never shall."</p>

  <p>"That's good," said I. "Now let's hear your story and let's see if I
  believe in you."</p>

  <p>She frowned at me.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget, young man," she said warningly, "that you're dealing with a
  member of the British aristocracy. If I have any cheek from you I'll take my
  custom elsewhere."</p>

  <p>Of course, the only thing to do was to tell her to take her "custom"
  elsewhere, but she must have made pretty thorough inquiries into our business
  before she came, and she was by no means prepared to follow my advice.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," I said, "in the very chair in which you are sitting I have
  had dukes, duchesses, countesses and earls beyond number."</p>

  <p>This seemed to mollify her, and I thought she eyed the chair with greater
  respect.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll cut a long story short," she said (which in women of this
  class means that they are going to make a short story long). "I married Sir
  George rather late in life. A good many people can't understand why he
  married me," she said with unconscious humour. "I'm not going to boast, but
  you'll see that Sir George wasn't the only gooseberry on the bush." She
  positively bridled with pride as she opened her capacious handbag and
  produced a letter.</p>

  <p>It was written in a foreign hand and the postmark was Liverpool. I
  gathered from the calligraphy that the writer was of one of the Latin races.
  It would be indiscreet to give the opening of the letter, which dealt with a
  mad and foolish adventure of a chance meeting at a concert, of other
  meetings, and finally the greatest adventure of all. The letter
  concluded:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"And now, my darling, my love, misfortune has come to me,
  alas! I am without engagement, I am poor, I need money to take me to my land
  and to give me the rest I need. Will you not send it to me, sweetheart? Five
  hundred English pounds. It is so little to you, so much to me. Or shall I
  bring my beautiful violin and play outside your house until you throw it into
  my hands?"</p><br>

  <p>It was signed "Thy Lover."</p>

  <p>"He gives the Post Restante as his address," said I. "Well, it is a simple
  matter to inform the police, but I suppose you do not want to take that
  step?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed. I don't," said the woman violently, "do you think I want the
  whole of this county to know? It's bad enough as it is, young man. I'm
  snubbed here and there, and I'm not going to give them any other handle. Why,
  I'd have to clear out. I dare not show my nose in the village as it is."</p>

  <p>"He addresses you as 'My Darling Mary Ann'." said I, pointing to one
  passage in the preamble; "is that the name you gave to him?"</p>

  <p>She flushed. "That was my name originally," she admitted. "I took on Olga
  because it sounded more classy. That bit puzzled me, because I never told him
  my name was Mary Ann, and he must have wormed it out of somebody."</p>

  <p>"Now, tell me all about the facts of the case, Lady Purseyence," said I.
  "We have the man's side of the story, what is yours?"</p>

  <p>She had met a "gentlemanly" foreigner at a promenade concert, it appeared.
  He had sat by her side, had lent her a programme, and had spoken to her
  entertainingly and interestingly upon the music.</p>

  <p>They had afterwards met, and learning that he was a musician&mdash;she did
  not explain exactly what kind of a musician he was, but I afterwards
  discovered that he played second violin in the orchestra of a Blackpool
  hotel&mdash;she had agreed to spend her summer holiday at Blackpool where he
  had an engagement. And that, she swore, was as far as the matter had gone.
  She admitted that she thought he was a distinguished nobleman, or at least a
  great artiste, who was giving a series of concerts at Blackpool, and when she
  discovered that he was merely a plebeian hotel fiddler she left Blackpool in
  a hurry, lest her aristocratic friends should discover her acquaintance with
  so common a person.</p>

  <p>"Now Lady Purseyence, you've got to be very frank with me," said I;
  "you'll swear to me that nothing else happened, that you did
  not&mdash;er&mdash;hold hands or anything of that sort,"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, no," she exploded.</p>

  <p>I stopped her with a wave of my hand. "You see, I must know all the
  facts."</p>

  <p>"You know all the facts," she said tartly, "now what am I to do?"</p>

  <p>"What is his name?" I asked her.</p>

  <p>"Festier," she said, "Jules Festier."</p>

  <p>"Do you know his London address?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him since?"</p>

  <p>"No." she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, leave the matter with me. Lady Purseyence," I said. "and I will do
  the very best I can for you."</p>

  <p>Being rather slack at the time I took the case into my own hands, and did
  not, as I ordinarily would have done, hand it over to my assistants. My first
  business was to inquire after Festier, and here I had many channels of
  information. One of my informants in Soho discovered a man who knew Festier,
  and to my amazement this man gave Festier a very excellent character.</p>

  <p>"A most respectable man," he said, "and a pretty good musician. He went
  back to France three months ago." I stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" He was a man whose opinion I valued.</p>

  <p>"Quite sure," he said emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Has he a good record?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Excellent," he said. Then, after a moment's pause: "Wait a moment.
  There's a woman in this street, Madame Visconti, who knew his wife when she
  was alive and with whom he corresponds. Maybe she has heard from him."</p>

  <p>I sat down in the little restaurant where the conversation had taken
  place, as my informant knew the proprietor of the restaurant, and presently
  he came back in triumph with a letter.</p>

  <p>"By good luck." he said, "Festier wrote to Madame only this morning. Here
  is the letter."</p>

  <p>The first thing I saw when I took the letter in my hand was that it was in
  absolutely different writing to that which Lady Purseyence had received.</p>

  <p>To confirm the certainty that the writers were different men there
  occurred by good fortune the following sentence in the middle of the
  letter:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"I suppose you have not seen that kind lady whom I met at
  the concert. I often think about her goodness to me. You remember, dear
  friend, that she came to Blackpool to hear me play, but had to leave owing to
  the illness of her mother."</p><br>

  <p>I made a mental note of this passage, and handed the letter back. That
  evening I telephoned to Lady Purseyence.</p>

  <p>"What excuse did you give to Festier for returning to London from
  Blackpool?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I forget now." she said. "Oh, yes, I remember, I told him that my mother
  was ill."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I come down to see you?"</p>

  <p>"Do," she replied. "You will easily find my house. It is the biggest for
  miles around."</p>

  <p>I smiled to myself.</p>

  <p>Even the vulgarity of Lady Purseyence could not obliterate the good taste
  which the late Sir George had shown in furnishing this wonderful house of
  his, and though her ladyship had added one or two articles of furniture to
  the beautiful drawing room into which I was shown, articles which made one
  shudder to look upon, so utterly out of harmony were they with the general
  furnishing, it was still a noble and tasteful apartment.</p>

  <p>She was dressed for dinner when I arrived, and cane to me in a
  plum-coloured velvet, cut low.</p>

  <p>"There were one or two questions I wanted to ask," I explained.</p>

  <p>After a seven course dinner, which bored me unutterably, and when the
  servants had gone, I began my cross-examination.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what strikes me as curious, Lady Purseyence," I said, "and you
  mustn't be offended at anything I say. We're talking in confidence as man to
  man, so to speak."</p>

  <p>"Straightforward dealing is my weakness," she said, "say what you like,
  young man,</p>

  <p>She was flushed and in a more communicative mood than she had been on the
  afternoon of my interview. "Why did you go to the promenade concert?" I
  asked. "Are you a lover of music?"</p>

  <p>"I like a rag," she said, "and I've got a mechanical piano that plays all
  the latest jazz tunes."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," said I, "but I'm talking about music &mdash;real classical
  music. Do you like it?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"I think it's muck," she said.</p>

  <p>"Then you went out of curiosity?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She laughed again.</p>

  <p>"No. I didn't," she said. "I'll tell you the truth. I should have gone to
  sleep if I hadn't talked to that fellow. No. I'll tell you why I went."</p>

  <p>She folded up her serviette, resolutely.</p>

  <p>"There's a lot of women in this county who look down on me, a lot of cats,
  I ought to say, and them not better than they ought to be. They are always
  trying to show and put me in my place, and the worst of them is Mrs. Deston
  Power. Yes, I must admit she's pretty, but handsome is as handsome does, say
  I. Well, one day, we had a bazaar, and this Power woman, whose husband is in
  India and who's got nothing to do but gad around, started talking about the
  wonderful music of Froli. I think that was the man's name."</p>

  <p>I nodded. I knew Antonio Froli by repute. He was what is known in police
  circles as a "bad lad". A brilliant musician, with a vicious temperament, he
  had recently been in trouble, and had seen his engagements cancelled because
  of certain incidents in his private life which had come to light.</p>

  <p>Lady Purseyence went on: "I said to myself: 'I'm going to learn something
  about music.' And up to London I went. I went to hear this fellow Froli, but
  I spotted Mrs. Deston Power sitting in the front row, and I cleared out,
  though I needn't have done, for she hadn't any eyes for any but this
  long-haired Eytalian"</p>

  <p>"There's another question I'd like to ask you, Lady Purseyence," said I.
  "Does any of your relations call you Mary Ann, any of your sisters?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Nobody," she said. "I've got no relations in the world, thank God!"</p>

  <p>She stopped and hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Nobody?" I asked again.</p>

  <p>"Well, she said after a pause, "I'll tell you the truth. It's a
  humiliating thing for a lady like me to admit, but these&mdash;she paused as
  though to eradicate a violent adjective&mdash;"these people around here, the
  Deston Powers and people of that kind, call me Mary Ann. That's my nickname,"
  she said. "Pretty rotten, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Very unkind." said I</p>

  <p>"They call me 'Mary Ann the Cook', 'The Duchess of Cuisine', and things
  like that, but I'll show 'em one of these days," she said grimly. "I tell
  you, Mr. What's-Yer-Name, the women round here are cats."</p>

  <p>From that moment I had in my mind the explanation of a difficulty. I went
  straight away back to town and saw Bob Fenning, of Scotland Yard. Bob is an
  old friend of mine. We have worked together unofficially on many, remarkable
  occasions, and Bob would always go out of his way to help me, as I would go
  out of my way to help him.</p>

  <p>"What was this Froli case? I saw it in the papers some time ago," said
  I.</p>

  <p>"Froli? You mean the Dago musician?"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, it isn't a pleasant case, but he was charged with breaking a
  champagne bottle on the head of a waiter at the Star Restaurant," said Bob.
  "Behind that, of course, there was a pretty bad case which didn't come into
  Court. He's a bad lot that young fellow."</p>

  <p>"Is he good looking?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very good looking," said Bob, "in an effeminate kind of way. The
  women raved about him, and when he was brought up you couldn't get into the
  court for frou-frou."</p>

  <p>"You're the man I want, if you know anything about him." I said. .</p>

  <p>"I know a great deal about him," said Bob. "Now just tell me what you want
  to know."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me the names of any of his woman admirers?"</p>

  <p>"Their name is legion," said Bob, "but I can give you half a dozen of his
  dining, wining and piping friends," and he rattled off a list.</p>

  <p>"Anybody else, I asked, and he must have heard the disappointment in my
  tone.</p>

  <p>"There was one girl, who was the most devoted of the lot." said he, "and
  when I say girl I mean woman, whose name I don't know. I think she lives
  somewhere in the country, but she was always with him, dining in these
  hole-and-corner restaurants that people like Froli affect."</p>

  <p>"You don't know her name?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No, but I can tell you what she's like. because I saw her one night when
  I was shadowing Froli&mdash;we had had one or two complaints in London about
  him. She was a tall, willowy creature, very pale and drawly. She very seldom
  stays in town&mdash;never, so far as I know&mdash;and that made it difficult
to
  trace her name. Anyway, we didn't want her name. We were more concerned with
  another matter in which Froli figured."</p>

  <p>"Can you give me any other characteristics about this woman?"</p>

  <p>"None, except that she wore her hair, which she parted in the middle and
  whirled down over her ears, in the Edna May style; that she smoked
  incessantly out of a long black cigarette holder, which had a band of
  diamonds about the centre&mdash;I think that's about all."</p>

  <p>I thanked Bob and went back to my office.</p>

  <p>The case now could be very easily settled, and I could relieve Lady Mary
  Ann Purseyence of any further annoyance; but since it is my task not only to
  serve my clients but to serve the ends of justice, and particularly not to
  help one woman at the expense of another, I did not feel that my work was
  completed.</p>

  <p>I found Froli's address, and sent Gibbons, my assistant. up to interview
  him I always send Bully Gibbons on a job like that. He looks so ferocious,
  and in his angry moments, or even when he simulates anger, he is perhaps the
  most terrifying person that a nervous young fiddler with an artistic soul
  could wish to avoid.</p>

  <p>"If there are any letters get then," I said. "I don't think that kind of
  bird will give you any trouble."</p>

  <p>"I bet he won't," said Gibbons grimly, and off he went looking very
  pleased with himself.</p>

  <p>It was seven o'clock the next evening when I presented myself at Hall
  Manor House, in the village of Tesserham, in Kent. Certainly Hall Manor House
  was small, so small as scarcely to justify its magnificent title.</p>

  <p>A trim maid opened the door to me, and showed me into a drawing room where
  she left me. Presently she returned.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Deston Power wishes to know what is your business?" she asked, still
  handling my card. "She is lying down, and does not feel very well. Could you
  not write?"</p>

  <p>"I must see Mrs. Deston Power herself." said I, "and will you be kind
  enough to tell her that my business is urgent and cannot wait?"</p>

  <p>Presently the maid came back again.</p>

  <p>"My lady says that she cannot see you," she said, and handed me back my
  card. I had written on the back "Business&mdash;In reference to Lady
  Purseyence," and I suppose this reference to the Duchess de Cuisine had been
  quite sufficient to prevent Mrs. Deston Power condescending to see me.</p>

  <p>"Very good." said L "and now will you kindly go to Mrs. Deston Power and
  tell her that if she does not come down she will miss the treat of her
  life&mdash;I want to play her one of Froli's sonatas."</p>

  <p>The girl looked askance at me, and hesitated to take the message.</p>

  <p>"Go along and tell her that," said I, in such a tone of authority that she
  obeyed.</p>

  <p>I knew this would be sufficient, and presently Mrs. Deston Power strolled
  into the room with that look of high-bred insolence on her face which is the
  peculiar prerogative of the more or less worthless classes.</p>

  <p>For if ever I have seen a bad woman in the making that woman was Mrs.
  Deston Power, and I say God help her husband (she is divorced now) or anyone
  who has ever placed their honour in her hands. She was smoking a cigarette
  through a long black holder, and about that holder was a tiny band of
  diamonds. Also her hair was parted in the middle and banded-I think that is
  the word &mdash;over each ear.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, and what do you want," she demand. haughtily.</p>

  <p>"I am a private detective employed by Lady Purseyence," said I, "and I am
  tracing the origin of certain blackmailing letters which have been received
  by her."</p>

  <p>She raised her pencilled eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Do you suggest that I sent Mary Ann blackmailing letters? The idea is too
  absurd."</p>

  <p>"I suggest nothing of the kind, Mrs. Deston Power," said I merely suggest
  that these letters were sent to her by a man named Froli under the impression
  that they were being sent to you."</p>

  <p>The colour in her face changed.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean," she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"I mean this, Mrs. Deston Power: that my client has the option if she
  wishes of prosecuting you for impersonation."</p>

  <p>"How dare you," she asked, but I could see the fear in her eyes. "Please
  explain yourself."</p>

  <p>"The explanation is quite simple, madam," said I quietly. "In London you
  met a man named Froli. Into your relationships with that man I will not
  inquire. Adoring ladies of position who run after musicians are not uncommon
  phenomena."</p>

  <p>"Do you dare," she cried. "If my husband were here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If your husband were here, Mrs. Deston Power," said I with a smile, "you
  would be very glad if he were somewhere else. Now, I'm not going to make any
  trouble, and I hope you're not either. The truth is that you met this
  musician, that you went about with him, you dined with him, and that you left
  London with him on one occasion. The truth is also that he was ignorant of
  your identity, and when he pressed you to give him your name you gave him the
  name of Lady Purseyence."</p>

  <p>She stared at me open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Has he&mdash;has be written to Lady Purseyence?" she whispered,
  horror-stricken.</p>

  <p>I nodded. "He has written demanding money and threatening to expose her if
  she does not send that money &mdash;that is what his letter amounts to."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" she said. "What a fool, what a fool I have been!"</p>

  <p>"I think you have been something more than a fool, Mrs. Deston Power,"
  said I, "but for the moment I am not concerned with the ethical side of the
  case. Will you tell me this? Have you written any letters to Froli? Before
  you reply I might say that I have no right to ask you, but I am merely acting
  in your best interests."</p>

  <p>"I wrote him no letters," she shook her head. "He has turned out a
  dreadful man, hasn't he? He was in the Courts some time ago."</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"So that's why you dropped him, eh?" I smiled. "Well, I think you would
  have been wiser if you had dropped him before."</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?" she asked, and she had me in a dilemma.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I want you to do," said I, "unless it is if this case
  goes any further, and this Froli gives Lady Purseyence any more trouble, that
  you will write to him and say that you are the person concerned. Personally,
  I do not think he will bother you. I have sent a man up to see him, and I
  have undertaken on your behalf to pay his fare out of the country if he will
  leave Britain immediately."</p>

  <p>She had collapsed into a chair, and sat with her face in her hands, the
  tell-tale cigarette holder on her lap, and the cigarette itself was
  smouldering in the fireplace where she had thrown it when I made my
  revelation.</p>

  <p>"You'll not tell Mary&mdash;Lady Purseyence?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"I don't see that I can without betraying you, Mrs. Deston Power, and I
  have no desire to benefit my client at your expense. But I do suggest that
  you should make some kind of reparation to Lady Purseyence."</p>

  <p>"What am I do?"</p>

  <p>"Ask her to dinner, and cook the dinner yourself," said I brutally.</p>

  <h2><a id="story1-2"
     name="story1-2"></a>II. &mdash; THE WIFE OF SIR RALPH CRETAPACE</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is true that conscience makes cowards of us all, but only
  true of a bad conscience. There is no greater asset in life than the
  possession of a fearless mind. The bad conscience is the blackmailer's
  banking account. It is queer what little things worry some people, and how
  others have big and serious offences to their discredit and yet can go
  through life with a smiling face and an untroubled mind. One man will worry
  himself to death because, as a youth, he fell into temptation and stole a few
  pounds from his employer, another will rob people all his life and sleep nine
  hours every night.</p>

  <p>The true blackmailer is a man or woman who appreciates the psychology of
  the victim he or she may tackle. It is not a question of knowing a great deal
  about their victims' past acts so much as knowing something of their present
  state of mind, their prospects and their ambitions. One of the most
  extraordinary cases, extraordinary because of its bizarre features, that ever
  came my way, was the Cretapace affair. I knew Sir Ralph Cretapace (I am not
  giving real names of persons or places) by repute, though it had never been
  my lot to meet him. From all I had heard of him he was a shy, retiring man
  who hated publicity, and never went in for politics or public life of any
  kind, and whose name was certainly the last in the world I expected to ever
  have upon my books.</p>

  <p>At the time the events which I am now describing occurred, I had a little
  office in Bond Street, and I was living in Acacia Road, St. John's Wood.
  Though my name and office address were to be found in the telephone book, my
  home address was omitted at my request, and this for obvious reasons. One
  does not want to be called up all hours of the day and night by people who,
  in a fit of remorse or terror, decide to invoke the aid of a detective
  agency. My experience is that there are very few cases of this kind which
  will not wait till the morning.</p>

  <p>Therefore I was a little annoyed just before I was going to bed at night
  to receive a call from somebody who was not on the list of my intimate
  acquaintances. As a matter of fact I used my home telephone to call
  others&mdash;not for then, to call me, and it was very seldom my bell rang on
  genuine business, though it was not at all infrequent to be called through
  the error of the telephone exchange. Thinking it was such a mistake. I was
  ignoring the call and closing my study door on the jangling, noise, when,
  half in irritation and half obeying a "hunch", I went back and took down the
  receiver.</p>

  <p>To my surprise I was called by name.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is I," I replied.</p>

  <p>"I am Lady Cretapace," said the voice, "and I want to see you most
  urgently."</p>

  <p>"Your ladyship doesn't want to see me tonight?" I said good-
  humouredly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, tonight," she replied, to my surprise. "I have put off calling you
  to the very last moment. but I cannot stand it any longer."</p>

  <p>I was not very tired, and I certainly was curious. "Where can I see you?"
  I said.</p>

  <p>"Will you come to 603 Park Lane?" she replied, and I promised I would.</p>

  <p>I had some difficulty in finding a taxicab at that time of night, but I
  picked one up in the Edgware Road and drove down to Park Lane. No. 603 was
  one of those little houses with enormous rents which are to be found at the
  Piccadilly end, and I was shown straight into a beautiful little drawing
  room.</p>

  <p>I had pictured Lady Cretapace as a well-developed matron, grey-haired and
  lorgnetted, and I was agreeably surprised to find a lady of twenty-five and a
  remarkably, pretty one, too. She was evidently in a state of agitation, and
  after she had apologised to me for bringing me out at that time of night, she
  found some difficulty in beginning her story.</p>

  <p>"Don't apologise, Lady Cretapace." said I, more with the idea of making
  conversation than anything else; "we are like doctors. People put off seeing
  us till the last moment and then send for us in a hurry."</p>

  <p>"It was my doctor who suggested I should send for you." she said. "Mr.
  Furnival, do you know him?"</p>

  <p>I knew Mr. Furnival very well, and what she said explained the mystery of
  her knowing my private address. "Is it about yourself you wish to see me,
  Lady Cretapace?" I asked tentatively.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied with a faint smile; "I hope I never shall have to see
  you about myself. It is about my husband."</p>

  <p>There was another little pause, during which she seemed to be considering
  which was the best way of telling me the story.</p>

  <p>"You have doubtless heard of my husband. Have you ever met him?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"Sir Ralph. as you know, is a very retiring man. He has one of the
  sweetest dispositions of any human being I have ever met." she added; and I
  did not need to be a psychologist to know that this lady was very much in
  love with her husband and that she had not engaged me, as wives have engaged
  me before, to operate against her lord and master.</p>

  <p>"I married Sir Ralph five years ago," she said; "he is fifteen years my
  senior, and I am his second wife." This was news to me.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know there had been another Lady Cretapace," I said.</p>

  <p>"Neither was there," said she. "My husband married before he came into the
  title and his wife died some years ago. My husband is a very sensitive man,
  and, like many literary men, spends nine months of the year in the country.
  He does not like London; and if we are not in our home in Sussex we are in
  Scotland fishing."</p>

  <p>"I knew Sir Ralph wrote something or other," said I. "I myself am not a
  literary man."</p>

  <p>"He writes poems." she said, "and songs. You know his 'Love Lyrics of
  Fez', 'The Purple Temple' and 'The Desert Way'. I suppose they have been
  played on every piano organ in London. My husband hates that sort of thing,
  and I think one of the reasons he so seldom comes to London is because he so
  constantly hears his songs murdered on the street instruments."</p>

  <p>So far she was only fencing or, as I thought, excusing her husband, and I
  waited.</p>

  <p>"Until a year ago Sir Ralph was a very abstemious man," she said. "He
  seldom took wine, and I certainly have never seen him the worse for drink.
  Moreover, he was carefree and did not worry, in fact he was a little too
  careless." She stopped, and her lips quivered. "That was a year ago," she
  said significantly; "today Sir Ralph has changed, oh so terribly. About
  twelve months ago something happened, I don't know what, which distressed
  him. The first I knew of the matter was when he came home from town looking a
  perfect wreck. I questioned him as to what had happened, but he asked me not
  to press him. He was very gentle and kind, but he would give me no
  information whatever. Then he started drinking. The first I knew of this was
  when I found a whisky decanter, which had been filled the day before for some
  guests who were coming but who were detained at the last moment, was empty. I
  questioned the servants and very reluctantly, because he is very fond of Sir
  Ralph, the butler told me that my husband had drunk it all. I was surprised.
  I did not think it was my business to remonstrate with Sir Ralph, but from
  open drinking he took to secret drinking. He lived practically in his room
  and I saw very little of him."</p>

  <p>"Nobody called on him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Nobody," she said. "At regular intervals be went to town, on the first of
  every month to be exact, was absent for one day and came back. I was very
  distressed and spoke to him about his habits, but as that only seemed to
  worry him more I desisted. His friends have done their best to check it, and
  I must say that he has been drinking less of late, but he is becoming more
  and more melancholy. He does no work. He has not touched his piano for
  months, and this evening I think I have found the solution."</p>

  <p>She walked to a desk and unlocked it.</p>

  <p>"This is my husband's desk," she said, "and usually he lets me keep it
  tidy for him, but of late, on one excuse or another, he has refused to give
  me the key. I had no idea that the desk held any solution, but having some
  time on my hands I decided to clear it up if any of my own keys fitted the
  lock. You see this one does." She inserted a small key into the secretaire
  and pulled down the flap.</p>

  <p>"There was nothing very startling to be found until I came upon two
  cheque-book counterfoils, each containing sixty cheques. As you will see,"
  she handed one to me, "of these sixty, ten have been made out to a person
  whom he calls X for £500. You will observe that each is made out on the first
  day of the month&mdash;the days he came to London."</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Well. Lady Cretapace," said I, "on the face of it, it looks as though
  your husband is being blackmailed by somebody, that the blackmailing started
  a year ago, and that, of course, accounts for his change of habits."</p>

  <p>"That is my view, too," said the girl, nodding. "When I made this
  discovery I went round to see Mr. Furnival, who is a dear friend of mine and
  a friend of my father, and it was he who advised me to send for you without
  delay. It isn't the money," she went on to explain; "Sir Ralph is very rich
  and I have private means. It is the danger to his health and this constant
  strain which is breaking my heart."</p>

  <p>I took a note of the cheques and their numbers, and when I had finished
  this I asked:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you do not want me to see Sir Ralph himself,"</p>

  <p>She shook her head vigorously.</p>

  <p>"That is the one thing I do not wish you to do." she said. "I want you to
  undertake the work of discovering what is the secret of his terror, and
  believe me, whatever it is, however bad, I will be loyal and faithful to him.
  If he has committed some folly in his past I am sure it is a folly and no
  more. You have unlimited money to carry out your investigations. Do your
  best."</p>

  <p>It was a novel kind of commission, because the information on which I
  usually worked, namely, that supplied by the person blackmailed, was denied
  me; and I had to begin not so much at the bottom of the ladder, but to dig
  out of the ground before I reached the bottom of the ladder.</p>

  <p>The next morning I paid a visit to Sir Ralph's publishers and had the good
  luck to find Mr. Morello, whom I knew.</p>

  <p>"Cretapace," he said, "I cannot tell you much about him except that his
  music sells very well. I haven't seen him for over a year. I'll get you some
  of his pieces." He went into the store-room and came back with about twenty
  numbers.</p>

  <p>"I see these are all Eastern songs," said I.</p>

  <p>Morello nodded.</p>

  <p>"He specialises on Eastern subjects, and he really gets the Eastern spirit
  in his music very well indeed."</p>

  <p>"Has he lived in the East?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"In Morocco. He was for some time the British Attaché in Fez."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a man is he?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Very romantic, very impulsive. and I should say the soul of honour." said
  Nora, "You will find more about him in 'Who's Who' than I can tell you. I've
  got a copy here somewhere."</p>

  <p>He found the book and I turned up the name.</p>

  <p>"I don't see any reference to his first marriage here." I said, and
  Morello looked at me sharply.</p>

  <p>"His first marriage," he said; "did you know about that? I don't suppose
  there are half a dozen people in the world who know he was married
  before."</p>

  <p>Then he asked suspiciously: "What are you making inquiries about?"</p>

  <p>I assured him that it was in Sir Ralph's own interest.</p>

  <p>"Well, you've been very fortunate in coming to the one man who knows all
  about that marriage," he said. "I doubt whether Lady Cretapace herself can
  tell you more than I know. I happen to have all the facts, because
  immediately on his return from Morocco on leave Sir Ralph brought me his
  first lyrics. He was little more than a boy at the time. It was a very
  romantic affair. The British have no Ambassador at Fez; the British Minister
  lives at Tangier. Cretapace was secretary to the British Commissioner in the
  Moorish city, and from what I heard&mdash;and from what he told me&mdash;he
had a
  pretty dull time at first. Then, one evening, whilst dozing on the roof of
  his house in Fez&mdash;everybody goes on the roof for their siesta&mdash;he
saw a
  beautiful girl on the roof of the adjoining building, which was the palace of
  El Menchi, the Moorish Minister of War. It was the Moor's daughter."</p>

  <p>"A Moor!" said I in surprise.</p>

  <p>"A Moor," said Morello; "not a nigger, you understand, as white as you or
  I. The Moors range from pure white to jet black. I have never understood why
  it is. Old Menchi, for example, whom I have seen, is black as the ace of
  spades. Of course, there was a great fuss about an unbeliever seeing a
  daughter of the Faithful without her veil; but Cretapace was so crazy about
  the girl that he embraced Mohammedanism and married her.</p>

  <p>"It was after he was married that he came to England to sell me the
  lyrics, and it was whilst here that the rebellion occurred and his wife was
  killed by a chance shot whilst she was on the very roof where he had first
  seen her. I believe he was nearly beside himself with grief. They had not
  been long married and they were perfectly happy."</p>

  <p>But why did he leave her in Fez?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"He was sent on a mission to Persia, and from Persia was ordered home. He
  was actually telling me how he felt the absence&mdash;he had not seen her for
  six months&mdash;when the news of her death arrived."</p>

  <p>"That was eighteen months after their marriage?"</p>

  <p>"About then; I am not certain to a month or two," said Morello.</p>

  <p>"Suppose the story that she was killed was not true, and that she is still
  alive," said I.</p>

  <p>Morello shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt whatever about it. The British Agent himself sent the
  news, and he had seen the body. Sir Ralph never went back to Morocco
  again."</p>

  <p>This Conversation occurred on the 31st of the month, and that night Lady
  Cretapace called me up on the telephone and told me that she had heard from
  her husband, and that he was coming up to town and begged her to go back to
  the country.</p>

  <p>"I should do as he wishes," said I. "Will he stay in Park Lane?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," she said; "but don't you think it would be best if I
  stayed?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," I urged; "go back to Sussex. I'll look after Sir Ralph whilst he
  is in London."</p>

  <p>I sent one of my best men to pick him up at Victoria, and on the following
  morning I myself took up my station within view of the house. It was not
  until three o'clock in the afternoon that I had my first glimpse of Sir
  Ralph. He was a spare man, with a delicate face and a moustache that was fast
  turning grey. I strolled across the road to get him under better observation,
  and I noticed that beyond the fact that his hand shook when he raised it to
  his lips, as he did every few minutes, there were none of the telltale signs
  of excessive drinking. He walked rapidly down Park Lane to Piccadilly, and I
  followed him. In Piccadilly he turned, walked eastward, and disappeared up
  the steps of the Orient Club.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment I became conscious&mdash;a sort of instinct that is
  difficult to fathom or analyse&mdash;that somebody else was watching Sir
Ralph.
  Maybe it was the knowledge that somebody was sauntering along at the same
  pace as myself that made me turn my head to the other side of the road, and
  there I saw a very resplendent gentleman in a top hat, smoking a fat cigar
  and swinging his cane as he strolled. Now, top-hatted gentlemen are not so
  common in the West End of London as people imagine, and this fellow was so
  "brand new" that he would have excited attention anywhere.</p>

  <p>He was evidently dressed as he thought the people of the West End ought to
  dress, which marked him down as an outsider; but my interest turned to joy
  when I recognised him. It was Dodo Johnson. Half the Cretapace mystery was
  solved, to my mind, when I laid my eyes on Dodo, for of all the professional
  blackmailers in the world he is the best known to the English police.</p>

  <p>Dodo has served three terms of imprisonment, and has only escaped penal
  servitude by the skin of his teeth. I did not trouble any more about Sir
  Ralph; I went to the nearest telephone booth and called my friend at Scotland
  Yard.</p>

  <p>"Is Dodo back?" he said in surprise. "I didn't know it."</p>

  <p>"Has he been out of the country?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he has been in the South of Spain." was the reply. "He cleared out
  after that Turnbull trouble and he has been away for about five years. Where
  can we pick him up?"</p>

  <p>"Is he wanted?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No. be isn't wanted on any specific charge, but we like to keep our eye
  on him."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you later." said I grimly. "I want to pick him up myself
  first."</p>

  <p>Dodo Johnson, that complacent man with the twirling moustaches (I never
  knew how he got his name) had disappeared when I got back to Piccadilly. I
  strolled past the club and looking up saw that Sir Ralph had taken up a place
  near the big plate-glass window which overlooked the street. I had not long
  to wait. Presently I saw the figure of Dodo swaggering towards the club, and
  with him was a negro youth of about seventeen, very well dressed and, I
  thought, rather uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>They walked past the club and Dodo glanced up. I, who had followed behind
  them, also looked to see Sir Ralph sitting, his chin on his breast, his eyes
  closed. I waited till we were some distance past the club, and then I
  overtook Dodo and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned round with a start
  and some of the colour left his face,</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Dixon," he said uneasily; "what do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Five minutes of earnest conversation," said I.</p>

  <p>He looked at the native boy and then looked at me.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't see you just now," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you can," said I. "Tell the coon to go into the park and wait
  for you."</p>

  <p>He spoke to the native in Spanish and the young man walked away, and I
  took Dodo's arm very firmly in mine.</p>

  <p>"Dodo," I said, "you have got five minutes to spill the beans."</p>

  <p>"Spill the beans?" said the innocent Dodo. "I don't understand you, Mr.
  Dixon."</p>

  <p>"Where did you find this interesting native?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"He's a friend of mine," said Dodo.</p>

  <p>"Any relation to Sir Ralph Cretapace?"</p>

  <p>He shot a glance at me full of apprehension.</p>

  <p>"Has he put you on to me?" he said, and then recovering himself. "I really
  don't know what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Dodo," I said gently, "you have been staying in the South of
  Spain, and from the South of Spain to Morocco is not even a Sabbath day's
  journey; the old <i>Gible Musa</i>, which is a slow boat, does the journey in
  three and a half hours. Now you've got one chance of saving yourself from
  serious trouble. I am not going to ask you how much money you have got out of
  Sir Ralph Cretapace; and, so far as that's concerned, we will let bygones be
  bygones, because I am not a member of the regular police force and it is not
  my business to gaol you."</p>

  <p>"How much do you know," he asked, after a pause.</p>

  <p>"I know you have been to Morocco, and in some way you have got the story
  of Sir Ralph's early marriage and conceived the ingenious idea of fostering a
  son upon Sir Ralph, a nigger son of whom he would be ashamed."</p>

  <p>"Suppose it is his son?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Suppose nothing." said I; "let's keep to the truth. This Moorish wife of
  his had a child," it was then that I put my big bluff on him, "and it died,"
  I said; "we have all the certificates. In fact, I've enough evidence to send
  you down to Dartmoor. Now be sensible. Dodo, and tell me all the facts."</p>

  <p>It was a bold guess of mine. Indeed, to this day, I am not certain whether
  the first wife of Sir Ralph had a child or not, and I don't think that Dodo
  knew either, for he was thrown off his balance.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll own up," he said. "I heard this yarn in Casablanca, and I
  worked the idea out, made a few inquiries, and brought the kid back to
  London. I was not certain how Sir Ralph would take it, but he fell for the
  story like a starving robin falls for a breadcrumb. Mind you," said Dodo,
  with that quaint pride in his illegal practices which always amuses me, "I
  was taking a risk, though I was ready to bolt if he turned the story down.
  Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"You are coming along to my office," said I. "You are going to make a
  signed statement, and then I am going to give you twenty-four hours to get
  out of the country with your coon."</p>

  <p>"Don't call him a coon," pleaded Dodo; "he's a nice little fellow, and I'm
  teaching him to play the banjo."</p>

  <p>That evening I called upon Sir Ralph and placed the statement before him,
  and I have never seen a man so relieved as he was. I left it to him to tell
  the story to his wife.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="story1-3"
     name="story1-3"></a>III. &mdash; THE CASE OF MRS. ANTHONY STATMORE</h2>

  <p class="first">ONE of the most extraordinary cases which it has been my lot
  to investigate was that of Tony Statmore. I need hardly say that my object in
  all the affairs with which I am connected is to keep the case out of
  Court,</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, it is not my duty to bring a blackmailer to justice,
  though in the course of my life my investigations have had that result. My
  first duty is to my clients, and as a rule I am engaged for the very reason
  that the person who seeks my services is frantically anxious to avoid
  publicity.</p>

  <p>It looked at one time impossible that this happy result could follow my
  work on the Statmore case. and, curiously enough, this "blackmail", though
  blackmail it was in the true sense of the word, was in the legal sense not
  blackmail at all!</p>

  <p>If I were giving real names and addresses, which, of course, I am not,
  every reader would know Statmore's shipbuilding firm. It is one of the most
  famous in the country. It employs its thousands of workmen, and puts into the
  water every year thousands of tons of shipping. John Statmore, who was plain
  Mr. Statmore, having refused, so I am told. the offer of a peerage, was, like
  many another man in the war, the most fortunate and the most unfortunate.
  That is to say, he added to his millions, but lost his two sons in the early
  fighting in Flanders.</p>

  <p>I remembered him many years before as a very strict, hard man, who had no
  sympathy with those who fell by the way. He was a Churchman and the president
  of many philanthropic societies, and prouder of his name than many an
  aristocrat.</p>

  <p>I will say that he and his sons lived according to their principles, and
  no breath of scandal ever touched them. Dearly as he loved his boys, Statmore
  would have cast them out if they had been guilty of half the follies which
  the young men of the day would commit and never think twice about.</p>

  <p>All the Statmores were cast in the same mould and Anthony Statmore, if he
  was a little weaker than his cousins, had views as rigid as old "Iron John"
  his uncle. Tony Statmore was working in a draughtsman's office in London
  learning the rudiments of his profession when the war broke out. He threw up
  his work after telegraphing to his uncle and receiving his approval, enlisted
  straightaway into a line regiment, and was drafted out to the front in a few
  weeks. He was one of the heroic band which held the Ypres salient through
  that dreadful winter of 1914-15. He was wounded twice and later gassed, after
  which he came back to London on a long sick leave. Now, the effects of gas
  upon the men vary considerably, but I understand that one of the most common
  results of this terrible experience is to bring about a state of depression
  which produces in some cases suicidal tendencies. Ordered to rejoin his unit,
  Anthony Statmore did so with the assurance that he was going out to his
  death. He believed implicitly that he would never return to his native land
  again. He had come up from Brighton, where he had been recuperating, and was
  spending his last few days in town, and in this mood he met Elsie Cave.</p>

  <p>She was a shop girl in one of the big West End stores, very pretty and
  fragile, and with a most plausible little tongue. As a matter of fact, and as
  I discovered, at the time she met Tony, she was under suspicion at the stores
  where she was working for stealing, and she had a conviction against her at
  Reading for obtaining money by a trick.</p>

  <p>You would never think it to look at her, but that is the kind of girl she
  was. Tony met her at a picture-house, where she was sitting by his side, and
  was struck, not only by her prettiness, but by her general forlorn and
  pitiful attitude.</p>

  <p>He spoke to her and took her out to supper. He was glad enough of the
  diversion.</p>

  <p>According to her statement she was half-starved, and she finished by
  telling him in the strictest confidence that she was contemplating
  suicide.</p>

  <p>Tony, in a burst of splendid generosity, with the certain knowledge that
  he was going to his death, proposed marriage to the girl, and the next
  morning the ceremony was performed at the Marylebone Registrar's office. He
  had money of his own, and arranged with the bank to allow her a certain sum a
  week, whilst he also notified the authorities that he was a married man and
  wished his wife to receive the small allowance which the Government
  granted.</p>

  <p>If he had also notified his uncle he might have saved himself a good deal
  of trouble; but for some reason, either shyness or being conscious that he
  had been rather precipitate, stopped him writing to the North, and he went
  out of England feeling that it was time enough that they should know when the
  news of his death came through. In justice to him it may be said that it was
  really nobody's business but his own. He was not dependent upon his uncle in
  any way, and he had no prospects of inheriting John Statmore's fortune.</p>

  <p>Well, what might be expected happened. He was not killed, but he was taken
  prisoner by the Germans. He was only six months in Germany before he escaped
  and returned to England.</p>

  <p>In the meantime his two cousins had been killed, and John Statmore had
  notified him, whilst he was in Germany, that Tony was to be his heir. He came
  back to England and sought his wife vainly for three months.</p>

  <p>Then he found her. It was after the armistice that I first met him in a
  professional capacity. A tall, good looking young man, rather pinched and
  very worried, he came to me with a letter of introduction from an old client
  of mine, and then it was that he told me frankly the story I have
  narrated.</p>

  <p>"I found her in May." he said. "She was living in Reading with her mother,
  who is a charwoman, though the class of her relatives does not worry me at
  all. She was very surprised to see me, and I thought, a little
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I think she would have been glad to have seen the back of me, because
  apparently I was a poverty stricken Tommy, but like a fool I told her that I
  was in the way of being a wealthy man, and that some day I should be a
  millionaire. Fortunately I did not tell her who my relations were, but she
  was a shrewd little Cockney, and very soon connected me with John Statmore. I
  think at first she thought I was lying to her, and I shall remember to my
  dying day the second she was convinced. I saw her eyes narrow, and a curious
  look come into her face. " 'Well, dearie,' she said, 'there's no reason why I
  should live in this hole any longer. I'm going up to London to stay at the
  best hotel.'</p>

  <p>" 'But I haven't any money yet,' I said in consternation; I have only very
  little in the bank and my pay.'</p>

  <p>" 'You can borrow it.' she said promptly; 'there are lots of people in
  London who will lend you money when they know that you will inherit your
  uncle's property. Who is he?'</p>

  <p>"I didn't tell her who he was; but, as I say, she subsequently discovered
  for herself. To cut a long story short, she went to London, and, not content
  with living at the best hotel, the Green Park Hotel, she must live there in
  style. She and her mother had a suite, the rent of which alone was £40 a
  week. I expostulated with her, and like a silly ass I told her that if my
  uncle heard of the marriage he would possibly disinherit me."</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"That was a fatal mistake to make. Mr. Statmore," I said, and he agreed
  with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"Don't I know it," he said in despair. "From that time onwards, the real
  blackmailing started. In the past three months I have got my name into every
  big moneylender, books in London."</p>

  <p>"How much have you drawn?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Close on £20.000," he said with a groan. "Of course. I can well afford to
  pay it back, if my uncle died; but he is still a hale man and. honestly, I
  like him so much that I would sooner have my own trouble than to learn he was
  dead."</p>

  <p>There were one or two points about this, of course, which made my work
  almost impossible; but out of curiosity I ask. him "In what way does she
  blackmail you?"</p>

  <p>He groaned.</p>

  <p>"Every time she wants money she threatens to give a big dinner party and
  invite all her former associates, sending an account of the party to the
  newspapers." I nodded.</p>

  <p>"She has made no attempt to approach your uncle?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no; she knows better than that," said the young man with a laugh;
  "that would be killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. And yet I am sure
  that if I refused her there is no step too desperate for her to take." I
  shook my head.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course. Mr. Statmore, you know that I can do nothing for
  you."</p>

  <p>"But why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because." I replied, "a wife cannot, in law, blackmail her husband. A
  wife can commit no offence, short of murder or any of those which lead to the
  divorce court. She can steal, deceive, conspire. blackmail, in fact almost
  anything for which another woman would receive penal servitude, and no charge
  can be made against her bemuse she is your wife."</p>

  <p>He sat in a chair and covered his face with his hands. I thought for a
  while. Personally, I like a forlorn hope, and an easy case never appeals to
  me.</p>

  <p>"Where is she now?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"At the Green Park Hotel," said he, looking up with a gleam of hope.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "I will do my best. though I warn you that that best is
  not likely to give you much relief. Still, there's a chance."</p>

  <p>He gave me the name of the firm for which she was working when he met her,
  and it was from them that I learnt of her dubious antecedents, but that only
  made matters worse for poor Tony Statmore if his marriage came to the ears of
  his strict relatives. That afternoon I called at the Green Park Hotel and
  found Mrs. Statmore and her mother, a stout, coarse-looking female,
  expensively dressed, taking tea in their private sitting room. I sent up a
  card, just my name, and wondered what excuse I should make. I was half way up
  in the lift when the idea occurred to me and I determined, at any rare to try
  it. She was pretty in a shrewish kind of way, this girl, and she looked old
  fashioned at me as I came in.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" she asked pertly. "Have you come about the furniture
  for my new house?"</p>

  <p>It was the first news to me that she was having a new house, and I shook
  my head.</p>

  <p>"No, Mrs. Glion," I said. That was the name she had registered in, for,
  like the shrewd little beggar she was, she was taking no risks. So long as
  she was not known as Mrs. Anthony Statmore she had a lever.</p>

  <p>"Then what do you want?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am a detective." I replied, and I saw her face go pale. "Oh, indeed."
  she said in bravado. "Well, I really don't know why you have called on me. I
  have done nothing to be afraid of."</p>

  <p>Of course she gave her low origin away in that speech and I could have
  laughed, for I knew just how that kind of people, when they are jumped up
  into a superior position. fear the revelation of their unsavoury past.</p>

  <p>I smiled.</p>

  <p>"Of course you have done nothing, Mrs. Glion," said I. "The point is, I
  thought I might be able to render you a service. It has been brought to my
  notice that a gang of blackmailers in London have secured certain information
  about you which they intend exploiting."</p>

  <p>She was perturbed and silent.</p>

  <p>"What do they know about me?" said the girl at last. "Well," I said, "they
  believe your husband is a rich man, who has married you without the knowledge
  of his relatives, and, as I understand, they threaten to expose the marriage
  to your husband's friends."</p>

  <p>She looked aghast at this remarkable possibility. "They also say that you
  have been convicted at the police court of theft."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," said the girl. "I am an honest woman, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Elsie." said the mother. "I knew there was going to be trouble."</p>

  <p>"Will you shut up?" hissed the girl. "What can I do?" she asked again.</p>

  <p>"Well. it occurred to me," said I, "that the best thing you can do is to
  employ a detective to protect your interests. Have you received any letters?"
  She shook her head."</p>

  <p>"I didn't want this to happen," she said half to herself, "with the old
  man so ill."</p>

  <p>"Which old man?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"His uncle," she said shortly, and that was news to me too. As I say, she
  was a shrewd little Cockney, and I found afterwards that she was very well
  informed as to John Statmore's state of health and movements.</p>

  <p>The next morning, to my surprise, I received an urgent Telegram from her
  saying, ''Come at once." I say "to my surprise" because I certainly did not
  think she was the first person who would jump off the handle at the first
  point of danger. She was terribly agitated and her face betrayed genuine
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Look at this letter! Look at this letter!" she stormed. "What shall I
  do?"</p>

  <p>I took the letter. It was typewritten and began without any
  preliminary:</p>

  <p><tt>I happen to know that you are the wife of Anthony Statmore. I wonder
  if he knows that you were convicted at Reading on a charge of theft? I wonder
  if his wealthy uncle is also aware of that fact, and that two other charges
  were made against you in London? It will be worth a lot of money to keep this
  from your husband and his friends, and unless I receive £5,000 by tomorrow
  afternoon I shall place all the facts in the hands of your husband. The money
  must be in notes and sent to No. 309 Stamford Street, Blackfriars. The man
  who takes it will know nothing whatever of its contents, so you can save
  yourself the trouble of putting splits on to watch me. if you fail me, or if
  you send for the police, I will immediately notify your husband."</tt></p>

  <p>It was signed, "Joe."</p>

  <p>"£5,000; £5,000!" she raved. "How can I get the money? Its like getting
  blood out of a stone anyway to get it from Anthony."</p>

  <p>"What do you suggest doing?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She walked up and down the apartment wringing her hands.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to pay it," she said wildly. "Of course, I shall have to pay
  it. But can't you get on to these people?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to see him," she said.</p>

  <p>"Him," I knew, was the unfortunate Tony Statmore. "Do what you can," she
  pleaded; "perhaps you can see them and talk them over."</p>

  <p>I went into the corridor, and as I opened the door I nearly collided with
  a red faced young man who looked like a coachman in his master's best
  clothes, and who was evidently going into the room I had left. I was a little
  surprised, especially when I noticed, out of the corner of my eye, that he
  went in without knocking.</p>

  <p>I waited for a while for him to get settled. then I opened the door. They
  sprang apart as the door turned, and both looked so foolish that it was
  obvious he had had her in his arms. I made some excuse for resuming and went
  out again. The young man was a side line, but he had to be traced, and I put
  one of my assistants on to track him immediately.</p>

  <p>Another week passed, and I had reason to believe that the girl had paid
  the money. John Statmore was sinking fast, and evidently the girl was
  preparing for her last big coup. Whilst Statmore lived she had a hold over
  Tony. On the Monday rooming she went to see her husband at his office in
  Cannon Street. She demanded £10,000 this time, and added: "Either I get it,
  or I go to your uncle." He nodded and opened the door.</p>

  <p>"I will see what I can do." he said curtly and showed her out.</p>

  <p>At five o'clock that evening as I was preparing to leave my office Mrs.
  Statmore flounced in. She was in a condition of hysteria between her rage and
  her fear.</p>

  <p>"Can you beat this?" she as., slamming down a letter on my desk. "They've
  asked for another £10.000. £10.000, mark you! They have sent me a copy of the
  letter they are writing to Anthony and his uncle."</p>

  <p>"How long do they give you?"</p>

  <p>"Read the letter yourself!" she snapped. "Till twelve o'clock tomorrow.
  Can't you see?"</p>

  <p>I handed the letter back.</p>

  <p>"Don't pay them," said I.</p>

  <p>"Don't pay them! she raved, she almost screamed, "don't pay them! Why,
  what does that mean? It means they go straight to Anthony&mdash;I've got to
pay
  them! I must, I tell you! Anthony can raise money. He'll be a rich man soon.
  He could raise £100,000 without any difficulty, couldn't he, Mr. Dixon?"</p>

  <p>I shrugged my shoulders. "I haven't any idea," said I diplomatically.</p>

  <p>"But he could," she said, and seemed to brighten up at the thought. "Why,
  I was asking a friend of mine, Mr. Stenton, the gentleman you saw in my
  rooms, who came to call on my mother the other day," she said with certain
  emphasis; "he told me that Anthony could raise half a million if he wanted
  to. And Mr. Stenton knows. He's been in a moneylender's office before he went
  on the Turf. Can't you catch this man Joe? Can't you shoot him or something,"
  she demanded fiercely. "What do you think I'm paying you for?"</p>

  <p>"Not to commit murder, Mrs. Glion," said I.</p>

  <p>The next morning she 'phoned to me and asked me to come round urgently. I
  found her pacing up and down the room like a tigress.</p>

  <p>"I want you to come up with me to the North," she said. "I am going to see
  my husband's uncle. My husband has refused to give me any more money. I mean
  it, I tell you. I have told him I mean it, and you shall come up with
  me."</p>

  <p>"But Mr. Statmore is very ill, I understand," said I.</p>

  <p>"What do I care?" she asked. "I am going to pay that mean hound in his own
  coin."</p>

  <p>There was nothing for me to do but to accompany her. I was determined that
  she should make no revelation, but I did not see exactly how I should stop
  it. I found out afterwards that. recognising the game was up, or nearly up,
  she had arranged to fly the country with the red faced gentleman who was such
  a constant visitor at the hotel, and that she had demanded a sum which can
  only be described as colossal.</p>

  <p>Acting on advice, Tony refused. We reached our destination in the evening
  of a very dull December day, and took a taxicab to the great mansion which
  Mr. Statmore occupied. But we were not allowed to see the dying man, and when
  she wrote a note to him I found means to change it for a blank sheet of
  paper, which I had prepared myself with.</p>

  <p>We returned to London by the late train, and the first news I received on
  arrival was a telephone message from Anthony saying that his uncle was dead.
  Mrs. Anthony Statmore had heard the news, too, and she 'phoned me in the
  morning.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, Tony's got to pay," she said determinedly, "This case is going to
  get into the newspapers otherwise, and that isn't going to do him any
  good."</p>

  <p>I laughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't see exactly how they can put it into the papers, Mrs. Statmore."
  I said; "more likely your divorce proceedings will go into the
  newspapers."</p>

  <p>"Oh, so that's it." she said; "you were working with him all the time,
  were you? And that's why you couldn't catch Joe."</p>

  <p>I heard her laugh.</p>

  <p>"Come round and see me, I have a little surprise for you."</p>

  <p>I pricked up my ears at that.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I said, and took a cab straight away to the Green Park Hotel.
  When I got there. I found to my amazement that not only was the red faced
  Stenton there, but two men who were strangers to me.</p>

  <p>"You don't know these gentlemen, Mr. Dixon, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't," I replied.</p>

  <p>"They are private detectives." she sneered. "You are not the only
  detective in London, you know, and when I found you couldn't catch Joe I put
  these two men on. They've been following him for a week, since I sent the
  last lot of money to him. He goes every morning to a little office in the
  West End, doesn't he?"</p>

  <p>One of the men nodded.</p>

  <p>"From ten till eleven he's there, miss. Nobody knows his name."</p>

  <p>"And from ten till eleven I'll be there," she said; "and you can come
  alone and see him pinched. This other gentleman," she pointed to the second
  stranger, "is a detective from Scotland Yard. Perhaps you'd like to be in at
  the death, Mr. Clever Dixon."</p>

  <p>"I certainly should," said I.</p>

  <p>"But what do you mean by divorce" she demanded, and I laughed.</p>

  <p>"Come, come. Mrs. Statmore. I've evidence enough to get three divorces,
  and I'm citing your friend here as one of the causes." I nodded to the red
  faced person, who looked uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>She said nothing more, but a taxicab was hired and we all drove off to a
  point in Piccadilly, where we descended. We turned up a side street, the
  private detective leading the way, to a small block which was let off in
  flats and offices, and up the stairs.</p>

  <p>"This way, madam." said the detective. She pushed past him and, flinging
  open the door, walked in.</p>

  <p>"Now, Joe," she said triumphantly, and stopped&mdash;for, sitting at the
  table reading his correspondence, was her husband.</p>

  <p>"You!" she gasped. "Is that the man?"</p>

  <p>The detective nodded, and I saw a malignant light dawn in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"That's better than ever I thought," she said. "Officer, this is the man.
  I charge him with robbing me of £15,000."</p>

  <p>The Scotland Yard man pushed his way to the office and looked down at Tony
  who was smiling.</p>

  <p>"Do you know this person, madam?" asked the Scotland Yard man.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I know him," she said; "he is my husband!"</p>

  <p>"Your husband!" The policeman shook his head. "I'm afraid I can't execute
  this warrant."</p>

  <p>"Well, madam, said the detective, "a husband cannot blackmail his wife,
  nor a wife her husband. Didn't you know that?"</p>

  <p>She was silent.</p>

  <p>"Or a wife her husband," I repeated gently.</p>

  <p>She turned on me with a look of hate, and sweeping through the door passed
  out of Anthony Statmore's life. I heard that she sailed the next week with
  Stenton for New York. At any rate, she did not defend the divorce action
  which Anthony so successfully brought.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story1-4"
     name="story1-4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE MYSTERY OF BISHOP'S CHAIR</h2>

  <p class="first">TURNING over a file of miscellaneous papers the other day,
  having in my mind the urgent necessity for getting rid of a lot of rubbish
  which accumulates at an amazing rate in my office, I came upon a typewritten
  sheet of paper which had the appearance of being a very amateurish attempt to
  advertise a book, save that certain features in that advertisement were
  remarkable.</p>

  <p>It is seven years ago since that document came into my hands. and I was
  surprised to see it, being under the impression that it was in the dossier of
  the Public Prosecutor. On reflection, however, I remembered that there were
  many of these announcements which came my way, and although I thought I
  handed them all to the proper authorities, this had evidently been
  overlooked.</p>

  <p>My first introduction to Mrs. Pellon Page came in a conventional way. I
  received a letter from her couched in the most guarded language, asking me if
  I would care to undertake delicate negotiations&mdash;the "delicate" being
  underlined. As was usual in such cases, she wrote in a false name&mdash;I
think
  it was Morris&mdash;and gave me as address a little shop off the Haymarket to
  which letters could be addressed.</p>

  <p>I replied in the usual matter-of-fact manner, telling her that we were in
  the habit of dealing with very delicate matters indeed, and that she need
  have no apprehension as to my discretion or probity. I enclosed, as is usual,
  the names of my solicitor and banker for reference. It happened, fortunately
  for the lady, that my solicitor was hers, though I think that this fact
  almost determined her to go no farther in the matter, since she was anxious
  that her solicitor should know nothing.</p>

  <p>Eventually, however, she overcame her fears, and I met her in the
  Piccadilly tea rooms. She was a tall, graceful woman of forty-five, quietly
  but handsomely dressed, and still very beautiful. I think she was relieved to
  discover that the detective she had engaged was not one of the down at heel
  people she had been led to believe would meet her, and that he was at least
  presentable and did not excite attention; and I would here remark in passing
  for the benefit of a younger generation that the art of being well dressed is
  to be so dressed that you do not look out of the common. The man is badly
  dressed who is dressed so finely that people turn their heads to look at him,
  or so poorly that he shows up against those who are normally costumed.</p>

  <p>"I am going to be frank," she said; "my name is not Morris." and she
  handed me her card.</p>

  <p>I recognised the name at once as the wife of a member of Parliament, not
  very well known outside his constituency, it is true, but a man of some
  substance. In these revelations I am not giving the real names of persons and
  places.</p>

  <p>"I am being blackmailed." She blurted out the very important fact to start
  with.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who is blackmailing you?" I asked. She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know the man's name, though I do not remember ever having met him."</p>

  <p>"Or his address?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He writes to me from an accommodation address."</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"So then, I take it, you have no desire that this man should be arrested
  or charged?"</p>

  <p>"Great Heavens, no!" she said. "That is the last thing in the world I
  want, and before I go any further I must ask you whether that is to be the
  outcome of your work."</p>

  <p>"Not unless you wish it. madam," I said. "Though, in a sense, I am
  condoning a felony by refraining from placing the police in possession of the
  facts, such a condonation is permissible."</p>

  <p>That seemed to satisfy her, and she took from her handbag a typewritten
  announcement similar to that which I discovered in turning over my papers
  last week. It ran:</p><br>

  <p class="sign"><tt>Soon To Be On Sale<br>
  The Wonderful Storz<br>
  <br>
  THE BISHOP'S CHAIR<br>
  Quarto Size. Price £100.<br>
  Don't Miss This.<br>
  It Will Create a Sensation.<br>
  <br>
  Apply to<br>
  TOMMY DODD,<br>
  397, Theobalds Place, N.</tt></p><br>

  <p>I read the announcement carefully, and noticed that he had obviously
  written "storz" for "story." I also observed that the word "size" had
  originally been written "siye," and that the "z" had been put on over the top
  of the "y." Also, I noticed that the small "e" was crooked, and had evidently
  been set on to its bar slightly out of the true. Otherwise the type looked
  new, and from the spacing it was evident that the writer knew something about
  typewriting, and therefore his slip with the "z" and the "y" was all the more
  remarkable.</p>

  <p>I put the paper down in front of me.</p>

  <p>"What is the Bishop's Chair?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"That is the one thing I do not want to tell you," she said. and I shook
  my head smilingly.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, madam, you will have to tell me everything if I am to be of
  any service to You"</p>

  <p>But on this point she was obdurate, and I thought that my investigations
  were due to stop, to use an Irishism, before they commenced.</p>

  <p>"All I want you to do," she said, "is to see this man and ask him whether
  he will take a lump sum and cease his persecutions. This is the fourth I have
  received, and each has been for £100."</p>

  <p>"How long has this been going on?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"For twelve months." she said.</p>

  <p>Again I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"It is a very difficult, indeed almost an impossible task you have set me,
  Mrs. Pellon Page," said I, "I presume that this man, if man it is," she
  nodded, "is in possession of letters which you have written&mdash;indiscreet
  letters to a man."</p>

  <p>She smiled scornfully.</p>

  <p>"You suppose wrong, Mr. Dixon," she said. "I have never written a letter
  which I would not mind the world reading, and I have certainly never done
  anything in my life, anything of that kind," she added, hastily, "which I am
  ashamed of people knowing."</p>

  <p>"And that is all you wish me to do? Find the man, interview him, offer him
  a net sum to cease persecuting you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, madam," said I, "that you are doing a very foolish thing.
  There never was a blackmailer who would let up on a man or woman who was rich
  enough to pay him. Suppose you gave him a large sum. Do you imagine that he
  would let up on you? He will be back again in twelve months' time demanding
  even a bigger sum. There is no honour amongst thieves, and less amongst
  blackmailers."</p>

  <p>She raised her hands in a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"This is killing me," she said in a low voice; "it is killing me. It is
  brutally wicked. But I must pay; I must pay!"</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I would like to ask you," I said at parting, "how long
  have you been married?"</p>

  <p>She shot me a suspicious glance.</p>

  <p>"Ten years," she said.</p>

  <p>"Can you give me the date?"</p>

  <p>She was surprised into laughing.</p>

  <p>"My husband is not the solution to your difficulty," she said. "I was
  married at the Westminster Registry Office," and she gave me the date.</p>

  <p>She seemed so loth to give me any further information that I did not press
  the matter. I might say in passing that the fee she offered me was a very
  handsome one, and the size of one's fee, in spite of the heroic stuff that is
  written about detectives, does certainly determine the amount of work one is
  prepared to put into a case.</p>

  <p>My first step was to go to Theobalds Place and make a few inquiries. As
  the lady suspected, and as I was pretty well sure, the address was that of a
  little tobacconist, and against one of the shelves was nailed a sign "Letters
  may be addressed here. Fee 3d."</p>

  <p>I had a talk with the proprietor, a reticent man. and asked him whether I
  could have a few letters addressed there. He growled his agreement and told
  me his charge. "What is the most convenient time to call for the letters?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Any hour you like," he replied, "as long as the shop's open; but don't
  you expect me to come down and give you your letters, because I wouldn't do
  that for anybody."</p>

  <p>"I'll call about the same time as Tommy calls," I said.</p>

  <p>"Tommy who?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Tommy Dodd," said I; "He is a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"Tommy Dodd," he frowned; "oh, I know the fellow, he calls as a rule about
  seven. He's still boozing, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head sadly and admitted he was.</p>

  <p>"A funny fellow," said the tobacconist; "spends half his time abroad,
  doesn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He is abroad a lot," said I cautiously.</p>

  <p>"He sent me lots of postcards from Switzerland. It must be a very
  beautiful country." said he.</p>

  <p>So Tommy was a traveller, presumably his life was a long holiday, and he
  returned at odd intervals to replenish his funds. I hung about the
  neighbourhood till nearly seven. Then seven. There were not so many customers
  going into the tobacconist, that I could make much mistake. The working men
  with their bags of tools, their red handkerchiefs and dinner pails were
  obviously not in Tommy's class. So that when I saw a young man, well dressed,
  wearing gloves and carrying a walking stick, stepping briskly along the road
  and turning into the 'tobacconist's, I guessed that this was my man.</p>

  <p>I went in after him, expecting the explanation which I would have to make
  would be made in the shop; but the tobacconist was not on duty, so Mr. "Tommy
  Dodd" was not informed that somebody had been there claiming to be his
  friend.</p>

  <p>A girl answered his rap on the counter.</p>

  <p>"Any letters for T.D.?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Dodd." said the girl; "none at all."</p>

  <p>He frowned.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly sure," said the girl.</p>

  <p>I had a good look at him. He was one of those "puffy" faced young men,
  hands and face had the plumpness which only comes from an abuse of appetite.
  His eyes were small and shifty, his mouth thick and loose-lipped.</p>

  <p>He made a little grimace and ordered a cigar, which he lit at the counter,
  and taking no notice of me, walked out. I did not trouble to make any excuse
  for coming in, but turned to follow him. As he turned the corner I put my arm
  through his.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Tommy Dodd," said I pleasantly, "I would like a little talk
  with you."</p>

  <p>He turned a sickly green and sagged against me so that I thought he was
  falling, but with an effort he pulled himself up.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he demanded in a voice from which the quaver of fear was
  not wholly eliminated.</p>

  <p>"I am a detective." I said.</p>

  <p>I thought he was going to swoon.</p>

  <p>"A private detective," I added, to relieve his mind. Men of this character
  have different ways of recovering their equilibrium. Mr. Tommy Dodd followed
  a very normal course with cowards of this kind in breaking into a string of
  the vilest abuse.</p>

  <p>"So she has put a detective on me, has she?" he stormed. "Well, I'll show
  her something! You do as you like. Take me to the station! You have nothing
  against me; but I've got something against her, by God!"</p>

  <p>"Unless you want to be pinched," said I, "you will be a sensible man and
  come for a little walk and see if we can't arrange matters. I have not come
  to arrest, but to arrange."</p>

  <p>As it dawned upon him that he was no longer in any danger his self
  assurance returned. I verily believe that had I made a bluff that he was
  pinched, and offered him an opportunity of getting out of the country he
  would have fallen for it. As it was, however, I was merely carrying out
  instructions.</p>

  <p>His assurance had so far returned that he invited me to his lodgings. He
  had a first floor suite in a boarding house in Manor Gardens, and I
  accompanied him thither. In the pleasant sitting room which he occupied I
  observed a trunk bearing French and Swiss railway labels which had been
  applied only recently.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and have a whisky and soda," he said. "Don't you think I was
  scared of you, because I wasn't!"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said I. "What have you got to be scared about? These are my
  proposals. Mr. Dodd."</p>

  <p>I took from my pocket a little leather case which I had brought with me
  and extracted a card on which I had scribbled a tentative suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Just read that."</p>

  <p>He took the card in his hand and read with a puzzled face.</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand this."</p>

  <p>"Well then, read this," said I, giving him another card where I had
  briefly written the proposal which Mrs. Pellon Page had made, namely, that he
  should receive a net sum.</p>

  <p>But what he did not know was this, that at the back of the first card I
  had pasted an ordinary carbon paper which had blackened his fingers, and that
  as he read the proposal he was putting his fingerprints on the back of the
  second card.</p>

  <p>He handed this to me and shook his head with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"No good." he said. "What I want is £1000 a year sent to a foreign
  address, and you are wasting your time asking me to take anything less."</p>

  <p>He had poured two whiskies and sodas and was reaching for his own when
  accidentally I upset mine and the whisky fell over his hand. With an apology
  I gripped his hand and wiped it with my handkerchief, for I was anxious that
  he should not observe his blackened fingerprints. He was quite congenial
  about the accident and was quite prepared to talk; but he would not talk
  about the matter which interested me, namely, what had Mrs. Pellon Page done
  which gave him such a hold over her.</p>

  <p>"That's my business," he said, when I asked him what was the meaning of
  the Bishop's Chair. "If she hasn't told you, I am not going to. We can't have
  two people drawing money." he said with a coarse laugh; "and that information
  is worth a lot."</p>

  <p>I left him at last, satisfied that I had got everything I could get from
  him. I promised to meet him the next day. He was living in the house under
  the name of Thomas Clinton. I got on to one of the servants that night, but
  she had not very much to say to Mr. Thomas Clinton's credit. He drank
  heavily, he kept vicious society, and he was a man of the most violent
  temper.</p>

  <p>"But he's crazy about his young lady," she said; "though she isn't much
  good, by all accounts."</p>

  <p>Nothing is too small for a detective to investigate, and I went after the
  young lady, who proved to be a third rate music hall artiste with an
  unsavoury reputation.</p>

  <p>I met Mrs. Pellon Page by appointment and told her the results of my
  interview. She drew a long sigh.</p>

  <p>"Well, I shall have to pay, I suppose," she said; "thank you, Mr. Dixon,
  you have done your best, but he is insatiable."</p>

  <p>I made another attempt to get information from her, but she was adamant.
  She paid me my fee, and there the matter rested so far as she was
  concerned.</p>

  <p>But by this time I was interested. I do not like to be baffled, and
  although I was no longer in her employ, I went out to get news. I inquired at
  the registry office, and a copy of her marriage certificate enlightened me.
  When she married Pellon Page she was a widow&mdash;a Mrs. Clinton. I did not
  think there was very much connection between her previous name and the name
  which this rascal had given me. In fact. I guessed from the first that
  Clinton was an alias of his, though he was probably influenced in adopting it
  by reason of the fact that it was familiar to him.</p>

  <p>I dropped into my club to see a friend of mine, who is one of those men
  who are veritable encyclopaedias of the landed gentry. He knows who is
  married to whom, and why. He knows every family history back to the
  Conqueror, their relations and their intricate inter-marriages.</p>

  <p>"Clinton!" he said; "well, there are lots of Clintons. What was Clinton's
  front name?"</p>

  <p>"Stenton Meredith Clinton," said I and he whistled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's one of the Clintons of Stokes Bisset. I remember him very well.
  Terrible fellow; he used to drink and knock his wife about. She married
  Pellon Page."</p>

  <p>"That's the fellow," I said, "do you know anything about him&mdash;Clinton.
  I mean?"</p>

  <p>"No; except that he committed suicide in the presence of his wife. Shot
  himself on an old stone seat in front of the house which was called the
  Bishop's Chairs."</p>

  <p>"That's it, that's it," I said.</p>

  <p>"What's it?" he asked puzz1ed.</p>

  <p>"That's the man," said I, regaining my composure.</p>

  <p>"A bad lot, a very bad. lot." My friend shook his head solemnly and
  branched forth into a long history of the Clintons and their
  eccentricities.</p>

  <p>I wrote to Mrs. Pellon Page and asked her if she would, come to my office,
  telling her that I had made a certain discovery. She obeyed the summons, and
  I could see that she was very nervous. I went straight to the heart of the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Pellon Page," I said, "I am going to ask you a straight question.
  Who killed your husband, Stenton Meredith Clinton?"</p>

  <p>I thought she was going to faint. She gripped the edge of the table, and
  her face went ghastly.</p>

  <p>Presently she said in a low voice&mdash;"I did."</p>

  <p>"Wilfully?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It was an accident. He threatened to kill me. He had the revolver in his
  hand, and I struggled with him for its possession. Just as I was twisting it
  round it went off. Oh, it was horrible, horrible!" She covered her eyes with
  her hands.</p>

  <p>"Who saw this?" I asked after a while. "The man?" She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It was my old nurse. She kept my secret, and the jury, returned a verdict
  of 'Suicide'. It was mad of me. I could have told the truth. but I suppose I
  was a coward."</p>

  <p>"Then how does this man come into it&mdash;this man who called himself
Tommy
  Dodd?"</p>

  <p>"His name is Dodling." she said; "he is the son of my old nurse."</p>

  <p>"And she told him?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"On her death bed the poor creature was troubled and she had to tell
  somebody. She did not know that the boy was out and out bad. He kept the
  information, but later he got into some trouble with the bank where he was
  employed as a shorthand typist, and wrote to me for my assistance,
  mentioning, that his mother had told him something. I was frantic with
  terror, and I made the mistake of sending him a large sum of money. Since
  then," she spread out her hands hopelessly, "it would ruin my husband if it
  came to light, even though I know I should not be punished. I am glad you
  know, Mr. Dixon." she said. "and I suppose it was foolish of me not to tell
  you in the first place. Nothing can be done nothing, nothing."</p>

  <p>I let the matter go at that, having satisfied my own curiosity, and,
  beyond wondering sometimes whether she was still paying him, or whether he
  had increased his demands. the matter went out of my head.</p>

  <p>I heard once that Mr. Tommy Dodd was still in England, and then occurred
  the Rolls Road murder. A girl was found in this unsavoury thoroughfare,
  lying, in the middle of the road, stabbed in a dozen places. She was
  identified as a frequenter of cheap dance halls and no good was known of her.
  But her moral character did not interest the police. They were after the man,
  or woman, who had committed this terrible crime. Of clues there were none.
  The night of the murder was a particularly foggy one, and she might have been
  carried a mile without anybody being any the wiser.</p>

  <p>The underworld hang together, and though from the finery in which she was
  dressed it was evident she had been out to some party, a careful search of
  all the rendezvous where people of this character assembled failed to give
  the police any clue. It was almost impossible to trace the man she had been
  seen with in the previous weeks&mdash;there had been so many who had danced
  with her.</p>

  <p>I was talking to Inspector Follingham about the case, of which he had
  charge.</p>

  <p>"It is evidently a crime committed by a man who is half insane and who, at
  the time of the murder, was half drunk," he said.</p>

  <p>The insanity theory worked out and a few days later Scotland Yard received
  a boastful letter signed "The Avenger." It was full of threats as to the next
  person he would "do in." "There are certain so called stars I am going to
  fix," one passage ran; "The Avenger is on their trail," and it concluded
  "Yours till Hell freezes."</p>

  <p>A hint dropped by one of the Headquarters men to me sent me to Scotland
  Yard in a hurry. I saw Follingham.</p>

  <p>"I've come to see you about that murder," said I. "Can I see the
  letter?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly." said Follingham. "There's a nice dirty little fingerprint on
  one corner that I'd give a lot of money to have the duplicate of, so put on
  your gloves before you handle the epistle."</p>

  <p>I slipped on my gloves and took the letter in my hand.</p>

  <p>"Can't you trace it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"There are fifty million sets of fingers in this country," he said, "and
  our record is well under a million. What chance have we of tracing it unless
  the man is a criminal?"</p>

  <p>I read the letter through.</p>

  <p>"This was written on a typewriter purchased in Switzerland," I said.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" he asked, interested.</p>

  <p>I laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm not making a mystery of it," I said; "but if I were to point out the
  fact that he often writes 'z' for 'y'. and vice versa, that is because the
  machines supplied to Switzerland have the keys reversed, and even the most
  expert typist makes a mistake. As to your fingerprint"&mdash;I had kept a
  certain card locked away in my safe and I had brought it with me, and now I
  laid it on the table&mdash;"I think you will find they correspond. The
murderer
  is a man who calls himself Tommy Dodd. His address is No. 916 Manor Gardens.
  He calls himself Thomas Clinton there."</p>

  <p>"How do you know this?" asked Follingham suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I have reason to know," said I. "I had charge of a case in which he was
  connected."</p>

  <p>They arrested Clinton that night and he fought like the maniac he was. Of
  course after he was pinched, everybody remembered seeing him dancing with the
  girl. He had had a quarrel with his own lady love, who, if the truth be told,
  was as much involved in the murder as any, though she escaped conviction, and
  the quarrel had extended to his new inamorata. There had been a free for all
  fight in the street, and probably the music hall artiste was involved,
  although it was never brought home to her.</p>

  <p>Clinton died before his trial, in the prison infirmary at Brixton, and
  when I took the news to Mrs. Pellon Page she was wrapping up ten £100 notes
  to send to the murderer. quite ignorant of the fact that he bad been
  arrested.</p>

  <h2><a id="story1-5"
     name="story1-5"></a>V. &mdash; THE TWENTY-THOUSAND-POUND KISS</h2>

  <p class="first">OF all the cases I have had to deal with, none probably
  offered quite the same features as did the Trusome affair. In many respects
  it was, of course, a typical case of blackmail. That is to say, the blackmail
  took a very familiar, though a very unpleasant form.</p>

  <p>Harold Trusome was the son of a very rich manufacturer established for
  many years in the West of England. He inherited his father's enormous fortune
  and his leaning for philanthropy.</p>

  <p>Young Trusome, even at Oxford, had associated himself with the work of
  uplifting the socially oppressed. He devoted himself to a mission operating
  in the East End of London. He was a patron and an energetic supporter of a
  dozen other philanthropic enterprises. and gave very large monetary support
  to others with which his name was not associated.</p>

  <p>A good looking, broad shouldered specimen of muscular Christianity, he was
  blessed with a fund of good humour, was something of an athlete, and the last
  man in the world one would have suspect of worrying about what other people
  thought of him. But, alas! for frail human nature, he had the vanity of
  virtue, or possibly he was blessed with too keen an imagination.</p>

  <p>The first time I met him was in relation to an inquiry about a man who was
  employed by him as an inspector in the East End of London. The man's duty was
  to go round the slums and discover genuine cases of distress. But
  unfortunately for Mr. Trusome, the person selected was a rascal without any
  redeeming features. He was wanted by the police on certain charges, and some
  of his criminal activities had brought him within my purview. It was then
  that I had to see Mr. Trusome, and he was genuinely shocked.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I'll get rid of the man at once." he said. "What a paltry
  scoundrel he must be! But can you understand, Mr. Dixon, why people allow
  themselves to be blackmailed? Doesn't it argue an extraordinary want of moral
  courage on the part of the victims?"</p>

  <p>I smiled.</p>

  <p>"That is an outsider's point of view, Mr. Trusome." I said; "personally, I
  have every sympathy with the blackmailed. You see, a man argues that though
  seventy people out of a hundred believe him innocent of the offence on which
  the blackmailer is working, the other thirty will say there is no smoke
  without fire. And in course of time those thirty, having the strongest
  convictions, will come to make the other seventy believe that there was
  'something in it.' "</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I see that," said he. "Nevertheless, I do not think that the opinion of
  other people would weigh against my own sense of justice and rectitude."</p>

  <p>I had no occasion to see Mr. Trusome again, and the story as I tell it is
  mainly picked up from a narrative subsequently supplied to me, the most
  important information, of course, being given to me by Mr. Trusome himself. I
  ought to state that the real names of persons and places are not given.</p>

  <p>There are blackmailers and blackmailers. The big "professionals" are
  satisfied to make one coup in two years, but that coup must be a big one, and
  must offer wonderful profits. The swell mob is always the most difficult to
  get after, because, naturally, they cover their tracks, they spend money by
  the thousands, and as a rule they do not operate in the same country twice in
  succession. Their plans are laid with the utmost cleverness and deliberation.
  They study the character, the habits, even the idiosyncrasies of speech of
  their victim; and a real big blackmailing campaign is as carefully thought
  out and planned as is a great battle.</p>

  <p>Mr. Trusome had a big house at Chislehurst, in the suburbs of London. He
  was a bachelor and a man who liked the good things of life. And here it might
  be remarked that, because a man is a good Christian, he is not necessarily a
  dull companion. Because he believes in the uplifting of his fellows he is not
  necessarily narrow or mean, or, if it comes to that, frugal or temperate. The
  latter Trusome undoubtedly was, though he kept a good table and his wine
  cellar was well stocked.</p>

  <p>If he had a fault, it was, as I detected at our first meeting, an
  inclination to self righteousness. He was inclined to despise people who
  succumbed to temptations which were never offered to him.</p>

  <p>In May, 19&mdash;, the big house next to Mr. Trusome was let furnished to a
  rich American named Dudley Some. Mr. Dudley Some was a youngish, well spoken,
  quiet, good looking American, and his wife as radiantly a beautiful creature
  as any human being has a right to be. She might have stood as a model for
  Gibson with her big eyes and aristocratic features, and in her movements she
  was grace itself.</p>

  <p>The two "families" became acquainted. Mr. Trusome had some wonderful old
  cartoons of the Renaissance period, and, curious enough, Dudley Some had also
  a few cartoons by the great Leonardo. Now Leonardo cartoons are very rare;
  there is only one collection in Britain, as far as I know: namely, that
  possessed by the King at Windsor Castle, and Trusome was naturally
  interested.</p>

  <p>They dined with one another, and undoubtedly Trusome was attracted by the
  beauty and vivacity of his charming neighbour. He found that she was
  interested in social work and offered to accompany her round the slums of
  London. This offer was eagerly accepted and the visit occurred, Mr. Dudley
  Some being one of the party. This was followed by another excursion, from
  which the American excused himself, as he had an important engagement in
  Manchester.</p>

  <p>Things went on like this through the summer, and then, on the 14th
  September, occurred the event which brings me to the story. In the first week
  of September it was announced in the newspapers that the honour of a
  knighthood had been bestowed upon Harold Trusome. It was an honour which was
  quite expected by those who knew the splendid work which Trusome had done,
  and there is no disguising the fact that the new Sir Harold was as pleased as
  anybody by this mark of his Sovereign's favour. He gave a dinner party at
  Chislehurst, to which the Dudley Somes were invited. They returned the
  honour, Sir Harold dining with the couple en famille.</p>

  <p>Sir Harold, as I say, had a large house and a fairly large staff of
  servants. There were eight or nine in all. On the morning of the 14th he
  summoned his butler to his study.</p>

  <p>"Perkins," he said with a smile. "I have given the servants a lot of extra
  work this last month, and I'm rewarding you all with a great treat."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir?" said the butler, interested.</p>

  <p>"I have taken two boxes for you at the Middlesex," Sir Harold went on,
  "and I am sending you all up by car this evening."</p>

  <p>"That's very good, sir." said the butler, hesitating; "but who is to look
  after you?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be all right," said Sir Harold, laughing; "I think I shall manage
  without assistance for a few hours. You take them along and give them a good
  time. You can either have dinner in town, or you can dine at the house before
  you go."</p>

  <p>This was not the first time that their employer had prepared an unexpected
  little treat for the household. Once he had taken a house for them at
  Brighton, and had sent his whole staff down for a change.</p>

  <p>After lunch Dudley Some called.</p>

  <p>"I want you to do me a favour, Sir Harold." he said; I'm called to another
  of those infernal conferences at Manchester, and I shall be away all night.
  Will you give eye to my wife"?</p>

  <p>"With the greatest pleasure," said Sir Harold heartily.</p>

  <p>"She is rather scared of burglars," Dudley Some. went on, "and I have told
  her that if she gets nervous she is either to telephone to you, or put a
  light in the window, which you can see from your study, as you were remarking
  the other day."</p>

  <p>Sir Harold rose and slapped him on the back.</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry, my dear chap." he said. "I'll be on hand all the
  evening. It so happens that I am staying at home."</p>

  <p>Nothing unusual happened during the rest of the day. The servants went on
  their treat, and Sir Harold settled down for an evening's quiet work. His
  study window, as Dudley Some had said, overlooked the side of the American's
  house; and from where he sat at his desk he could see the big window at
  which, it had been agreed, a light should be placed in the event of Mrs.
  Dudley Some feeling nervous or requiring assistance of any kind. It was a
  stormy night; rain fell in buckets, and a shrill wind moaned round the house.
  Once or twice he looked up to see whether the light was showing, but all was
  darkness. About ten o'clock, when he had switched on the electric kettle and
  was making himself a cup of cocoa, he glanced up, and to his surprise saw a
  light shining clearly in the hall window. He turned off the kettle and
  hurried downstairs into the hall, slipped on his raincoat, and opened the
  door. As he did so he started back, for there on the porch stood Mrs. Dudley
  Some.</p>

  <p>"Oh. I'm so frightened!" she said in a trembling voice, "please let me
  come in!"</p>

  <p>He stood aside and let her pass, closing the doer behind him.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," he said, "whatever is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she quavered, "but I heard all sorts of queer sounds, and
  I have sent my servants to the cinema tonight, and&mdash;oh. I am so
  frightened!"</p>

  <p>He led her upstairs to his study. To his surprise she was in night attire,
  with a big fur coat over her nightdress. She looked amazingly beautiful, but
  this did not concern him so much as the fact that her feet were wet, the thin
  slippers she wore being sodden. Presently she jumped up to her feet with a
  nervous little laugh.</p>

  <p>"I have been awfully foolish, Sir Harold," she said, "I'll go back now. It
  was just a little hysteria, I think."</p>

  <p>"I'll take you back." said he rising.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no," she said emphatically, "you will stay here. I won't allow
  you to leave this room. Promise you won't come out. or I'll stay here all
  night," she challenged.</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you're so emphatic, and you are certain that you're all right,"
  said Trusome, "I won't press the point. But I shall feel awfully
  uncomfortable&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can watch me through the window," she interrupted; "from there you
  can see me go across the lawn to my own door."</p>

  <p>He had to be satisfied with that, and as she disappeared from the room he
  walked to the window. He waited some time without seeing her, and presently,
  to his surprise, she walked again into his study with a mischievous smile on
  her beautiful face.</p>

  <p>"I haven't gone," she laughed, "and really, I feel ever so much better
  now. Will you forgive me, Sir Harold, for my folly?"</p>

  <p>"Why, there's nothing to forgive," said the other.</p>

  <p>"And you won't tell anybody about my having come?"</p>

  <p>"Why, surely not," he said with an involuntary glance at her scanty
  attire, "but do please get back quickly and change your slippers."</p>

  <p>"You won't breathe a word to my husband? He's awfully jealous."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed!" said Sir Harold. after a moment's uncomfortable pause.
  "that's awkward. But still, I promise you I won't tell him."</p>

  <p>She smiled in his face and laid both of her hands on his shoulders. Their
  faces were only a few inches apart, and I think Sir Harold Trusome would have
  been less than human if he did not sacrifice some of his high principles at
  that moment. Of course, by all the strict canons of morality, it was wrong
  for him to kiss her, and was indefensible from every point of view, except
  the human view. Kiss her he undoubtedly did, and instantly her arms were
  about his neck.</p>

  <p>"You are a dear," she breathed.</p>

  <p>At that moment the door opened and Mr. Dudley Some came into the room. He
  stood as though spellbound, and Harold was the first to see him. Slowly he
  disengaged the girl's arms from his neck and faced the outraged husband. The
  scene which followed was violent, to say the least of it. The girl slipped
  out in the confusion and made the best of her way to her own house.</p>

  <p>"Explain nothing!" roared Dudley Some, striking the desk with his fist,
  "it wants some explaining! You're a blackguard. Trusome! I've suspected
  something like this all along. If I hadn't lost the train to the North
  tonight. I should have been ignorant of this treachery. It doesn't want
  explaining. it explains itself!"</p>

  <p>This and more in the same strain; and at last Dudley Some took his
  departure, leaving a man facing what to him was final and absolute
  disgrace.</p>

  <p>It was three days afterwards when I came into the case. I received a
  telephone message from Trusome's office and repaired there without delay,
  wondering exactly what trouble he was in that would make my services
  necessary. Of course. I realised that every big man like him is a mark for
  villainy, but I certainly did not expect to hear the story which he told
  me.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you, before we go any further." he said, "that this is not a
  case of blackmail that I am asking your advice upon. It is simply a matter
  which ordinarily I should have taken to my solicitor. For a reason which you
  will quite understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In fact," I said, "you don't think he would believe you."</p>

  <p>"That's exactly it." said Sir Harold.</p>

  <p>Very carefully and conscientiously he related the particulars of his
  association with the Dudley Somes. He led up to the night of the fourteenth,
  and described in detail all that had happened, coming at last to the scene
  between himself and the husband.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it was simply terrible. I shudder now when I think of it," he
  said with a little shiver. "I had nothing to say&mdash;what could I say? It
was
  unpardonable of me to kiss Mrs. Dudley Some&mdash;absolutely unpardonable.
But,
  as I say, her face was close to mine, and I obeyed a mad impulse&mdash;" he
  stopped and shrugged his shoulders in despair.</p>

  <p>"It looks bad, of course," said I, "I will not disguise that fact from
  you. You sent all your servants out for the night, she comes to your house
  scantily clad, and is discovered by her husband in your arms. In fact," I
  said, "the circumstances look as black as they possibly can be. Now what has
  happened since?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to tell you." he nodded. "The next morning Dudley Some called
  upon me, would hear no explanations, and indeed I was not inclined to offer
  any. He was much calmer than he had been the day before, and was willing,
  apparently, to listen to reason. When I say 'listen to reason,' " said Sir
  Harold with a faint smile, "he was prepared to talk like a rational being. He
  said I had hopelessly compromised his wife and compromised him. Her maid and
  another servant saw her come back, and apparently saw her leave my
  house."</p>

  <p>"Where is Mrs. Dudley Some now?"</p>

  <p>"She has gone away into the country&mdash;in fact to Bournemouth. She left
  the morning after," said Sir Harold; "she has written me a frantic letter,
  asking me to make peace with her husband, and blaming herself for
  everything."</p>

  <p>"That makes it worse instead of better," said I. "What is he
  doing&mdash;Dudley Some, I mean?"</p>

  <p>Sir Harold shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He is instituting divorce proceedings." he said shortly. "Of course, this
  means something more than my social ruin. Dixon. If I were an ordinary
  society man I suppose I could live the scandal down in twelve months. But I
  am not a society man. I have a great number of enterprises which are founded
  on my character. I am known as a social worker; I have just received a
  knighthood for that work, as you know; and to figure as corespondent in a
  divorce suit is altogether repugnant to me."</p>

  <p>He was greatly moved, and paced up and down the room for a few minutes in
  absolute silence. I saw what the wreckage of this man's work meant to him,
  and I confess was sympathetic, for I believed his story. Still, there was
  more to come, as I realised, and presently Sir Harold flung himself down in
  his chair at his desk and told me the rest.</p>

  <p>"This morning Dudley Some came to see me, and said that he was concerned
  about his wife's future.</p>

  <p>" 'In the event of my divorcing her,' he said, 'do you intend marrying
  her?'</p>

  <p>" 'Certainly not,' I replied. 'I like Mrs. Some, but there is nothing
  between us and no obligation on my part whatever to make her my wife. I admit
  I have been foolish, and, if you will, dishonourable.'</p>

  <p>"Then he stopped me.</p>

  <p>" 'Then do you intend my wife, who is absolutely dependent upon me, to be
  left to the mercy of the world? Remember, she has no income of her own. She
  was a comparatively poor girl when I married her in New York, and her small
  income went out with a bank failure. No, I want to be reasonable, Sir
  Harold,' he said. 'I am passionately fond of my wife, and you have wrecked my
  whole career. I should be doing justice to my feelings if I shot you both.
  But deep down in my heart I have a real affection for the woman who has
  betrayed me. I purpose settling twenty thousand pounds upon her right away,
  and I suggest you do the same. I will even go so far,' he added, 'as to make
  this concession that I will spare her the humiliation of taking her into
  court.'</p>

  <p>" 'Do you mean you'll drop the divorce proceedings?' I asked.</p>

  <p>" 'Exactly,' said Dudley Some. 'After all, I have no desire to be
  divorced. I shall never marry again. If you do not want to marry her, there
  is no reason why she should be divorced at all. She can go her way and I will
  go mine. But I can only gain perfect peace of mind if I feel that she is well
  provided for, and that she will be if you agree to my scheme.' "</p>

  <p>Sir Harold finished.</p>

  <p>"And what did you do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I asked for twenty-four hours to think it over," said Sir Harold. "The
  money, of course, will not ruin me. In fact, I can very well afford to have
  paid the whole of the forty thousand pounds. What is troubling me is whether
  I ought not, as the result of this terrible misunderstanding, to do the
  honourable thing&mdash;allow the divorce to go through and marry Mrs. Dudley
  Some."</p>

  <p>"You mean," said I, "let the case go through undefended?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"In such circumstances," he said, "I think it is quite possible to keep
  names out. Now, Dixon, you're a man of the world and are used to all sorts of
  cases of this character. What am I to do?"</p>

  <p>"First of all." I said. "you can answer a few questions. Take your mind
  back to the morning of the 14th of September, when you decided to send your
  servants to the theatre. I take it that you had already purchased the tickets
  or arranged for the seats? Now, when did that idea of sending them strike
  you?"</p>

  <p>He knit his forehead in thought.</p>

  <p>"About three days before. I was dining with the Dudley Somes, and Mrs.
  Some was saying what an excellent show it was, but not quite the kind that
  she or I would enjoy to the full." He thought a while.</p>

  <p>"Go on," I encouraged.</p>

  <p>"Then I remember," said Sir Harold slowly, "that Mrs. Some said that she
  had sent her maid&mdash;by Jove, yes, it was Mrs. Some who gave me the
  idea."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said I dryly; "it was Mrs. Some, I should imagine, who fixed
  the night?"</p>

  <p>Sir Harold nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was, yes." He looked at me. "You don't mean to suggest," he said
  sternly, "that that unfortunate woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I suggest nothing, Sir Harold," I said, "except that, where money comes
  into these cases, one is entitled to suspect anybody of anything. I have not
  the slightest doubt in my own mind," I went on. "that you are being
  blackmailed."</p>

  <p>"Blackmailed?" he said. "By whom?"</p>

  <p>"By Dudley Some," said I.</p>

  <p>"Impossible! he said; "absolutely absurd, Dudley Some is, I should
  imagine, the soul of honour. He is a man of some wealth."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about him?" I asked. "I mean, do you really know
  anything about him that he hasn't told you himself?"</p>

  <p>"No," he confessed after a pause, "I don't. But I've looked him up in the
  New York list and I know they have a house on Long Island."</p>

  <p>"Possession of a house on Long Island," said I, "does not guarantee the
  integrity of its owner. Don't you see, the whole thing is a ramp, Sir
  Harold?"</p>

  <p>"I confess I don't," he admitted; "if it is, then that poor woman is a
  victim, you may be sure, and I want her name kept out of it."</p>

  <p>"It is my business to carry out the wishes of my clients, and if you
  instruct me to go ahead in this matter I will do all I possibly can to get to
  the bottom of it."</p>

  <p>Very reluctantly he commissioned me to proceed, and my first step was to
  interview a New Yorker who knew everybody who was anybody on or about
  Manhattan Island.</p>

  <p>"The Dudley Somes?" he said; "yes, I know them well. They're a pretty rich
  family who live in the west for the greater part of the year. The old man is
  a naturalist, or something of the sort."</p>

  <p>"Old man?" I said, "how old is he?"</p>

  <p>"About sixty," said my New York friend.</p>

  <p>"Isn't there a Mrs. and Mr. Dudley Some, a little younger?"</p>

  <p>"Never heard of them." said my friend promptly. "There are two daughters
  and both of them are unmarried."</p>

  <p>"But the house on Long Island?"</p>

  <p>"That is theirs undoubtedly. I have been them several times. It is a
  beautiful estate, but the Dudley Somes are very seldom in residence."</p>

  <p>I only called at Dudley Some's office to identify him, or to photograph
  him in my eye, as the saying goes. That afternoon I picked him up and trailed
  him to Waterloo Station. I saw him go into a booking office, and I didn't
  trouble to overhear the station he took his ticket for, but took my place in
  the queue and a ticket to Bournemouth.</p>

  <p>As I expected, he alighted at Bournemouth West. He gave the name of a
  hotel, one of the smartest hotels on the south coast, and was driven off. I
  gave him time to disappear before I mounted a cab and followed him. I got to
  the hotel in time to see him and his bag disappearing down the corridor. He,
  at any rate, was the last person to sign his name on the register. and it was
  not "Dudley Some" he had signed, but "Henry B. Smith, of Birmingham." That
  puzzled me a little until I made an inquiry. There was no Mrs. Dudley Some
  staying there, but there was a Mrs. Smith, of Birmingham. They occupied Suite
  112, and after I had seen my bag to my room, it was to Suite 112 that I went.
  I did not trouble to knock at the door of the sitting room but walked boldly
  in. I saw Dudley Some engaged in earnest conversation with his wife. They
  were standing in one of the long windows, and looked round at the sound of
  the door opening. Some frowned and walked towards me</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked briskly.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to Mr. Smith," said I.</p>

  <p>"That is my name," said Some.</p>

  <p>"And this, I presume, is Mrs. Smith?"</p>

  <p>I saw the girl, and really I was astounded at her beauty. She was all that
  Sir Harold had said&mdash;the most lovely being that the imagination of man
  could conceive. "That is my wife," said Smith. "Tell me your business and get
  out. You've no right to come into this room without knocking, anyway."</p>

  <p>"You ought never to have a private conference unless you lock the door,
  Mr. Some," said I. and he started back. "Oh. I see," he said slowly, "so
  you've been sent down by Trusome?"</p>

  <p>I heard an exclamation from the girl, and turned in time to see a look
  which I shall never forget to my dying day. It was a look of anger, which
  transfigured the beautiful face and made it almost demoniac. With an effort
  of will she controlled herself and again presented that look of classic,
  innocent beauty, which had met my eyes when I entered the room.</p>

  <p>"I am Mr. Some," said the other after a pause. "and I presume you are Sir
  Harold Trusome's lawyer?"</p>

  <p>"Far from it." said I, coolly annexing a chair and seating myself; "I am a
  detective."</p>

  <p>There was a silence.</p>

  <p>"I have come down to pinch you both on a charge of blackmail. There is a
  second charge against you of impersonating Mr. and Mrs. Dudley Some, but that
  I do not think it will be necessary to proceed with. Get your hat,"</p>

  <p>It was the old formula of the New York detective, that "Get your hat," and
  I depended upon it to bring my bluff to a successful end. Suddenly the girl
  stepped forward. I saw her hand go up, and&mdash;smack!</p>

  <p>Dudley Some stepped back with his hand to his face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you Jake!" she hissed. "Oh, you clever fellow! You poor slusher!
  Didn't I tell you to keep away from here? It is my own fault. Lew told me not
  to take you as a side partner, you poor, dippy boob!"</p>

  <p>"I did my best," growled the man surlily; "I thought Trusome would
  fall."</p>

  <p>"Of course he'd have fallen if you'd given him time. Gee! You got under
  him and caught him, you poor fish," She turned to me.</p>

  <p>"Ferdinand," she said, "I call that bluff of yours, All you know about me
  is that I'm not Mrs. Dudley Some. You've got nothing on me&mdash;and,
anyway, I
  don't think you're a regular cop; and if you're not a regular cop you can't
  pinch me in this country."</p>

  <p>"You're quite right, Mrs.&mdash;whatever your name is," said I, "but there
  are plenty of regular cops who will."</p>

  <p>"Not on your life," she said brightly. "Trusome isn't the kind of man to
  take the case into court, or I shouldn't have been in this at all, at
  all."</p>

  <p>She looked round at her crestfallen "husband."</p>

  <p>"Git, you Jake!" she said contemptuously. "Hit the trail for home, pack
  all my clothes and get 'em on board the <i>Mauretania</i>. This try on set me
  back nearly ten thousand dollars. I suppose Trusome wouldn't like to pay my
  expenses to that extent?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps if your husband asked him&mdash;" I began.</p>

  <p>"Husband!" she laughed contemptuously; "now do you think, my poor man,
  that I would lock myself to something who looks like the leading man in
  <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>? No, sir," she said briskly.</p>

  <p>"Now go you back to your Sir Harold and tell him from me that the least he
  can do is to send five thousand dollars on account of expenses. And say I'll
  sell him those Leonardo cartoons for another five thousand&mdash;they're
  genuine. I pinched 'em in New York."</p>

  <p>To my surprise, Trusome was not indignant, he was amused.</p>

  <p>"I won't buy the cartoons," he said, "but I'll send her a thousand pounds.
  But what made you jump at this being a hold-up?" he asked, "that's the word,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's the word, Sir Harold." I said; "it was very clear to me from the
  first. It was doubly clear when you told me how Mrs. Some left the room,
  intending to go back to her house, and then returned to you, having
  apparently changed her mind."</p>

  <p>"But how did that tell you anything?"</p>

  <p>"It told me this," said I with a smile. "that the lady had simply gone
  downstairs to let in her husband, who was waiting on the mat so to speak.
  That is why she would not allow you to go out with her. The whole thing was
  very carefully planned. Your habits, your interest in cartoons of the
  Renaissance, were all discovered. Probably they were discovered in America
  before these people left their native shores."</p>

  <p>"It will be a lesson to me." said Sir Harold after a pause. "The next time
  I have to see a woman alone I'll wear a muzzle,"</p>

  <p>"Another good way is not to see them alone." said I.</p>

  <h2><a id="story1-6"
     name="story1-6"></a>VI. &mdash; HOW A CROOK SPOOFED ANOTHER CROOK</h2>

  <p class="first">IF you were to ask me who was the most remarkable client I
  ever had, I should answer without hesitation, Mr. Lee Royder. The name of
  that extraordinary gentleman is perhaps unknown to the majority of my
  readers, but there are several intelligent people who live in a big grey
  building on the Thames Embankment who know Mr. L. Royder backward, as the
  saying is.</p>

  <p>L. Royder was born in Australia, but might be truthfully described as a
  citizen of the world. There was not a town in Europe or America that he had
  not visited. He had "operated" in Capetown, Johannesburg, Durban and E.
  London; whilst in Australian police circles his name was a household word.
  Even in the Pacific Islands he was not without fame; but I confess. such is
  my ignorance of these matters, that the first time I met him I neither
  recognized him by the name he gave nor did I associate him with this
  redoubtable person, the echo of whose fame had penetrated even to my remote
  London office.</p>

  <p>One morning a stoutish, good looking man drifted into my office, wearing a
  big grey felt hat and a large cigar which stuck up at an angle of forty-five
  degrees from his white teeth. He was well, even expensively, dressed; he had
  a large, heavy gold watch-guard across his ample chest, and a big white pearl
  gleamed in his cravat. They brought a card in to me, upon which was written
  only the words "A possible client."</p>

  <p>"Show him in," said I with a smile, and he came into my office, gave a
  quick professional glance round, closed the door himself and pulled up a
  chair to my desk.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dixon, I understand that you're a whale on blackmail cases," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what kind of fish I am," said I good humouredly, "but I have
  had some success with that type of crime."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "You're the man I want, then," said he; "my name is Lee
  Royder."</p>

  <p>I thought he said "Ryder" and that he was pronouncing the word with a
  Cockney accent.</p>

  <p>"Ryder?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Royder&mdash;R-o-y-d-e-r," said he. "I should have though that a gentlemen
  in your line of business would have heard of me&mdash;Lee Royder."</p>

  <p>And then the name came to me.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course." said I, though I was taken aback, for this was certainly
  not the type of client I expected; "Lee Royder. You're a&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A repentant and reformed criminal." said he, with a broad grin. "Yes, I
  thought you'd have heard of me. I should have been disappointed if you
  hadn't. The fact is, Mr. Dixon, I have had a very stormy career and have been
  in prison as you probably know, once or twice&mdash;maybe three times," he
  added cheerfully; "but that's all long ago and far behind me, and I am now
  living the chaste and sober life. I do harm to no man, I repent of my evil
  deeds&mdash;in fact." he said, in a burst of confidence, "I am having a
  holiday."</p>

  <p>I was forced to smile.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to suggest that you're being blackmailed?" said I.</p>

  <p>"That's the size of it," said he. "Of course, there's a way of dealing
  with that kind of crook, but in a law abiding country like Britain it would
  mean trouble for everybody concerned."</p>

  <p>I did not ask him what was his method, but I could guess. It was not the
  first time that Lee Royder had shot a way out of his difficulties, if report
  be true.</p>

  <p>"I have just arrived from Australia on the Royal Mail steamer
  <i>Orlando</i>," said he. "When I say 'Australia' I mean that I've come by
  easy stages, dropping off at Colombo and Bombay. At Gibraltar a party of
  Englishmen came on board, and amongst them was a fellow named, Serpilot." (I
  am, of course, not giving real names of persons or places.)</p>

  <p>"Bogey Serpilot?" said 1.</p>

  <p>"Bogey Serpilot," said Mr. Royder with an approving nod. "He's a
  three-card trickster, shyster, and general sneak-thief. Now I need hardly
  tell you," he said emphasising his points with the end of his cigar, "that I
  did not travel on the <i>Orlando</i> in my own name. I travel like
  Royalty&mdash;incognito. I suppose Bogey found trade very dull, for there
  wasn't a sport on the boat, as I had discovered long before I got to
  Gibraltar, and he started nosing round the cabins seeking what he might
  devour.</p>

  <p>"One night, after a very late seance in the smoke room, I got back to my
  cabin to discover that somebody had been giving it the 'once over.' If you
  don't know what 'once over' means I will explain. It is an American
  term&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what 'once over' means," said I. "It means somebody had been
  having a look round."</p>

  <p>"Exactly, and not only a look round," said Mr. Royder, "but a look-under
  and a look-over and a look-into. It was the look-into which annoyed me most,
  because in one of the drawers underneath my bunk there were certain
  confidential documents which I had no desire should be exposed to the light
  of day, or even to the light of night."</p>

  <p>"Those documents being&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"That is immaterial to the issue," said Mr. Royder. "Think of them as you
  will&mdash;old love letters, confessions of murder, birth certificates, or the
  plan of the long-lost South Sea Island where Captain Oodlum, the far-famed
  pirate, buried his treasure on a night of storm."</p>

  <p>I nodded laughingly. "Well, never mind what they were. You think they were
  seen?"</p>

  <p>"I am certain they were seen, because they were gone." said Royder, "and
  they wouldn't have been gone unless they'd been seen. If I had any doubts on
  the subject, they were dispelled the next morning," Royder went on, "when
  this lob-craw1ing son of sin sidled up to me, gave me the grip and sign of
  the Loyal and Ancient Honour Among Thieves League, Lodge 247. I'm not saying
  there is such a league, and therefore it would be absurd to say there is such
  a lodge," Royder went on imperturbably, "and therefore it follows that
  there's neither grip nor sign. And if I speak in parables it is because I am
  naturally talkative and like to hear the sound of my own voice.</p>

  <p>"He said he understood that I had lost something, and that I would not be
  above paying a small but tasty sum to make good the same losses. I mentioned
  fifty pounds and a quick death as an alternative proposition, but he accepted
  the fifty pounds and dropped the secret of my birth, or the lease of my
  house, or whatever it was he had pinched, and there the matter ended. We
  parted good friends&mdash;me and my money.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was an ungenerous thing for him to do. 'Live and let live'
  has always been my motto. But the English crook, and the London crook
  particularly, is notoriously white-livered and low, and I was prepared to
  pity his ignorance and let it go at that; only, unfortunately. for both of
  us. I received a letter this morning from him, addressed to me at my hotel.
  and in my hotel name, which you can read."</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Friend,</p>

  <p class="letter">Ten pounds a day and my share when you pull it off. Send
  the stuff to the Flowering Arms, Nags Road, Islington. I'll be waiting for my
  little bit outside&mdash;understand?</p>

  <p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;Care of the potman. George Jennings.</p><br>

  <p>"Ten pounds a day," said the irrepressible Mr. Royder, "may seem little to
  you, sitting as you do in this office and receiving large sums of money from
  panic stricken pie-cans, but to me it is a monstrous extortion, and I want to
  hire you to go after Mr. Bogey, and hand him a few wise words of warning, but
  not in such a manner as to get his dander up or cause him to take steps which
  we may both regret."</p>

  <p>"Does Bogey know you're Royder, or know anything about you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Royder shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am travelling, as I say, disguised as a Brown&mdash;one of the Browns of
  Townsville, Queensland, not to be confused with the Browns of Colorado."</p>

  <p>"And you do not feel inclined to tell me what were the documents this man
  took and restored."</p>

  <p>Mr. Royder shook his head. "It were better not, he said gently, "for your
  sake and for mine."</p>

  <p>"But why don't you see him yourself." I asked. "Because," said Mr. Royder
  more gently than ever "I do not think he would see me."</p>

  <p>"I don't think he would," laughed I, for Bogey was not the most courageous
  man in the world.</p>

  <p>It was a queer commission; One of the queerest I had ever been offered.
  But something about the case rather amused me, and my fatal curiosity was
  piqued. I knew where to find Bogey&mdash;not in Nags Road, but in a little
  public house off the New Cut, Lambeth. That was his favourite rendezvous, and
  there I found him, supporting the private bar, but drinking abstemiously.</p>

  <p>He wasn't best pleased to see me, and I think his mind must have done some
  quick surveying to discover the cause of my visit. He was a little fellow,
  mean faced and meagre, and slippery as an eel, and about as reliable as the
  legendary viper. I beckoned him outside. and he came reluctantly. In a few
  words I told him my business. He stopped me with a loud guffaw.</p>

  <p>"Brown, eh? So Brown's sent you? Well, if that doesn't beat the band!" he
  roared with laughter. "Well that fellow's got a nerve;" he said admiringly,
  "to put a 'split, on me. Did he tell you what I pinched?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't, but probably you will enlighten me," said I.</p>

  <p>"Not on your life," said Bogey emphatically; "that'd make you as wise as
  me. I've heard a lot about these Australians; they're supposed to be clever,
  aren't they? Well, we'll see how clever this one is."</p>

  <p>"You're not allowed to blackmail even a crook," said I.</p>

  <p>"Oh, aren't I?" said he.</p>

  <p>"And how did you know he was a crook?" I asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"That's telling." said Bogey. "Now, you go back to him and tell him to be
  a good boy and pay up. It ain't blackmail. Mr. Dixon. I've just engaged
  myself as a silent assistant, and he must pay my wages regularly. Anyway, he
  sent the first instalment this morning," he said.</p>

  <p>"Well I've warned you," said I. "And I think that about lets me out."</p>

  <p>"Look here. Mr. Dixon," said Bogey, touching my arm, "you know the sort of
  life I live&mdash;a dog's life, in gaol and out of gaol, and all the time
  scheming to make a couple of pounds. Here's a chance of me getting next to a
  lot of money, and you're not going to tell me that it isn't fair to take a
  chance. I've offered to help him in a certain matter, but he wants to work
  lonely and hog the lot. I ask you is that gentlemanly?"</p>

  <p>It was, as I say, a queer interview, and a queer case, and in my mind I
  washed my hands of it when I returned to the office that evening.</p>

  <p>Royder came down the next morning to see me to discover the result of my
  interview.</p>

  <p>"He's lying, of course," he said, "if he suggests I've come to this
  country with felonious intentions; he is merely trying to prejudice me in the
  eyes of my favourite detective. That's you." he explained.</p>

  <p>"It isn't what he threatens, you understand." Mr. Royder went on slowly;
  "there's something behind his little criminal activities, something which may
  touch the very safety of the State."</p>

  <p>He said this solemnly, and leant back to observe the effect of his words.
  I laughed.</p>

  <p>"As that doesn't seem to impress you," he went on, unconcerned, "I will
  come down to hard facts, and say that this man's activities threaten my own
  life which is infinitely more important to me than the salvation of Great
  Britain and Ireland and the Dominions beyond the Seas. Now I want this man
  watched day and night, and I wish you to take it on for me, Mr. Dixon. Put
  the best men you can find on his trail and report to me day and night. I will
  pay any sum in reason, and I will grant unlimited expenses."</p>

  <p>I hesitated. There was no reason why I shouldn't take on the job, the more
  so as I had privately informed my friends at Scotland Yard that day that Lee
  Royder was in town&mdash;information that was unnecessary since they had
  already marked his coming. Moreover, they had informed me that Lee Royder was
  apparently a reformed character, and had had no trouble at all with the
  police for several years, thus confirming much that Mr. Royder had told me
  about himself.</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said after a while, "I will take on this commission. But
  you understand, of course, that if I discover there is any hokey-pokey trick
  I shall drop the case like a hot brick and assist the regulars in bringing an
  end to your perfect day."</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a gentleman," said Royder heartily. "My lad, you can go as
  far as you like. I am an honest and innocent tourist, with no object in life
  save to live down my sinful past. If you find me deviating by a hair's
  breadth from the straight and narrow path or the broad and winding
  path&mdash;I've got it rather mixed up&mdash;which leadeth to a venerable old
  age, respected by my fellow citizens, pinch me without compunction.'</p>

  <p>He left a respectable sum to cover expenses, and I put Morris and Simpson,
  my two best men, on the trail of Bogey. Bogey was not an easy man to shadow,
  as a rule, but this time he gave no trouble. He spent most of his day in the
  little public house in Lambeth, and when he moved out at all it was to go to
  another public house in Islington, where apparently he interviewed his potman
  friend and received any correspondence which might be addressed to him
  there.</p>

  <p>At night it was his practice to take a walk in the city, and it was a
  curious fact, which my men reported to me, that he invariably reached the
  corner of Billiter Street as the clock boomed nine. This remarkable
  proceeding interested me so much that I went myself to the corner of Billiter
  Street and saw Bogey make his appearance and return the way he had come.</p>

  <p>Now in Billiter Street is the Third National Bank; and at nine o'clock a
  small army of commissionaires who have been guarding, the bank by day, are
  relieved by a night guard of the same corps, who enter the bank about ten
  minutes to nine.</p>

  <p>It was when the day guard was streaming out, which they did at the first
  stroke of the clock, that Bogey used to turn and walk to meet them. I counted
  the commissionaires&mdash;there were twelve&mdash;and I wondered whether
Bogey's
  object was also to count them. At any rate, he used to take up such a
  position, with his back to the light, that every one of the guard had to pass
  him and be visible to him. It was when they had all gone that he made his way
  back to his Lambeth public house.</p>

  <p>The circumstances were so remarkable that I asked Mr. Royder to come over
  and see me.</p>

  <p>"Yes", he said. "I know what he's been doing. Your men have been reporting
  to me, you know. I can't understand this strange interest in my bank."</p>

  <p>"Your bank?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, mine. At least, when I say 'mine' it is the bank which has the
  privilege of looking after my ill-gotten wealth," he said. He considered for
  a time, and then he said: "Mr. Dixon, I wish you would do me a favour. Will
  you attend at the corner of Billiter Street on Thursday night and shadow
  Bogey to his home?"</p>

  <p>"Why Thursday night?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Because on Thursday night." said Royder thoughtfully, "I have an idea he
  will not go back to Lambeth. or to any other place that you know of. When you
  have discovered his whereabouts I want you to telephone to me to my hotel. On
  Thursday morning, too, I should be glad if you will give me your bill and I
  will pay you."</p>

  <p>"Are you leaving London?" I asked with interest. "That depends largely
  upon Mr. Bogey. The truth is he's annoying me, and he's spoiling what
  otherwise might be a very pleasant holiday. I admit I have been indiscreet,"
  he said, half talking to himself. "It was indiscreet to leave things in my
  bottom drawer, and sheer lunacy to trust to the lock. By the way, did you
  ever hear of a man named Everard?"</p>

  <p>I seemed to remember the name, but I could not place him for the
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Everard was a London crook who died in Australia. He had the biggest
  brain of any man in our profession that I have known," said Lee Royder, and
  for once he was serious. "The man might have justified the title of 'Napoleon
  of Crime' if he hadn't had a kink. He was, in fact, the only man who ever
  elaborated criminal schemes with the same care and foresight as a general
  prepares a plan of battle. .</p>

  <p>"He died on my farm in Queensland?" continued Royder, "and he bequeathed
  to me&mdash;I'm not pulling your leg, but telling you gospel truth, Mr.
  Dixon&mdash;he bequeathed to me the most wonderful collection of get-rich-
quick
  schemes that you or I have ever seen or ever will see. Every detail worked
  out down to the last button on the last gaiter, so to speak. Some of them, of
  course, required a terrific capital. Some of them were flavoured with murder,
  which isn't my game. Some of them depended upon the help of men who are no
  longer available. But they were all first class schemes, believe me, written
  out in his own beautiful writing, with drawings, illustrations, plans,
  diagrams, distances&mdash;even notes, on possible changes of the plans due to
  bad weather. I tell you that fellow was a genius."</p>

  <p>A light dawned on me.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was one of these schemes which was seen by friend
  Bogey?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's it, sir, and that's why I'm scared. I'm afraid of that bungling
  jackass trying to carry out Everard's plan and getting me in bad. But," he
  said with his big smile, "I am paying him to be honest. Do you believe
  that?"</p>

  <p>"No." said I; "I don't."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, be on hand on Thursday,"</p>

  <p>I did not promise him, but I made up my mind that I would be there. On
  Thursday morning, as requested, I sent my bill, which was promptly settled in
  notes. Whatever else Lee Royder was, he was a generous paymaster. To be on
  the safe side. I went up to Scotland Yard and saw Inspector Manning and put
  the facts before him.</p>

  <p>"It looks suspicious, but I don't see what we can do," he said. "The bank
  is pretty well guarded by men who have been used to the game for years. I'll
  send one of my sergeants down to keep you company tonight."</p>

  <p>The sergeant called for me at my office, and together we made our way to
  the corner of Billiter Street, and were there at a quarter to nine and saw
  the commissionaires march up and pass into the bank through the narrow side
  door in Billiter Street.</p>

  <p>Then, just before the clock boomed out the hour, we saw Bogey slouching
  along. We had taken up our 'position in a dark doorway, left especially dark
  by arrangement with the police, on the opposite side of the road. We saw
  Bogey come to the street lamp and wait. Then the side door in Billiter Court
  opened, and out came the commissionaires who had been relieved.</p>

  <p>Bogey began to walk towards them, and simultaneously I crossed the road
  and paced leisurely on his trail. I counted the commissionaires as they
  passed me, and there 'were thirteen. Whether there should be twelve or
  thirteen or twenty, for the matter of that, I had no means of knowing.</p>

  <p>The last of the commissionaires jolted against Bogey and apologised. He
  was a well made man, his left breast glittering with medals&mdash;that I saw,
  but I did not see his face, the light being rather bad at the point where I
  passed him on the opposite side of the street. As Royder had predicted, Bogey
  did not go back to his accustomed haunt. He turned eastward, quickening his
  pace, and jumped on a 'bus at Aldgate.</p>

  <p>I might have missed him but for a providential taxicab. As it was, I
  overran him. I had no difficulty, however, in picking him up again and traced
  him to the famous Sidney Street and a block of tenements. Having marked the
  number of the apartment, I made my way to the nearest telephone box and
  'phoned Mr. Royder. His cheery voice immediately answered me.</p>

  <p>"Sidney Buildings? Thanks very much," he said; "so that is where he lives.
  I wish you would make a note of this, Mr. Dixon. The police may be
  tremendously interested to learn where our young friend hangs out."</p>

  <p>"But why?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll learn all about that in time," he said evasively; "by the way,
  do weather reports interest you?"</p>

  <p>"Not very much." I replied, somewhat surprised by the extraordinary
  question.</p>

  <p>"Well. they interest me," said Royder's voice. "I've just been on to the
  Meteorological Department by telephone, and you'll be interested to learn
  that tomorrow will be a fine day, with light, variable winds, with an
  anticyclone approaching these blessed isles from the Azores."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for the information;' I replied, "have you any instructions for
  tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>There was a silence.</p>

  <p>"No, no, you are released from your duties tonight. By the way, I observed
  that you had an official split with you."</p>

  <p>"You observed?" I said in surprise. "were you there?"</p>

  <p>"I was knocking about." replied Royder vaguely; "I was glad you were
  there. You see, I wasn't quite sure whether Bogy was a man of his word. He
  might have brought a pal and there might have been some gunning, especially
  if he had interfered with the commissionaires&mdash;that was what I was afraid
  of."</p>

  <p>"You're growing law-abiding in your old age, Royder." I said.</p>

  <p>"Cut out that stuff about my 'old age'," said the voice; "good-night!" I
  heard the click of the receiver as it was hung up.</p>

  <p>I confess the business puzzled me considerably. Why had Royder engaged me
  to watch Bogey? Why had he been so fearful for the safety of the Bank's
  custodians? And how did he know that Bogey would not return that night to his
  usual habitat? All these mysteries were destined to be cleared up on the next
  day.</p>

  <p>I had reached my office and was looking through some questionable
  correspondence which had been sent to another client of mine, when the
  telephone bell rang and I heard the voice of my friend at Scotland Yard,
  which sounded urgent.</p>

  <p>"I am coming along to see you." he said. "Wait for me."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes after he strode into my office, a very agitated man.</p>

  <p>"Dixon," he said, "the Third National Bank was robbed last night. Nearly a
  hundred thousand pounds in cash and another hundred thousand pounds in
  Chilian bonds, was removed from No. 6 Vault.</p>

  <p>"From what I can gather, the crime was committed at about eight o'clock.
  The vault was opened by somebody who had concealed himself on the premises;
  possibly the thief was a client of the Bank who had an opportunity of gaining
  access to the vaults during the day and escaped when the commissionaires were
  relieved."</p>

  <p>I gasped. "How many commissionaires are there?" I asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Twelve." said the inspector; "anyway, I'm going to pinch Royder and
  Bogey. Have you any idea where I can find either of them?"</p>

  <p>I gave both addresses&mdash;Royder at his hotel and Bogey at his apartment
  in Sidney Street. But Royder was not caught. He had left his hotel at six
  o'clock that morning, carrying a light suit-case, and wearing a long, heavy
  overcoat. He had travelled by taxi and had directed the man, in the hearing
  of the hotel porter, to drive to the Great Northern Hotel.</p>

  <p>"That's obviously a blind," said the Scotland Yard man.</p>

  <p>A search of his room saved us the bother of hunting the taxi driver. We
  found a crumpled telegram, handed in at a suburb of London and signed by a
  well known firm which said:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">YOUR MACHINE WILL BE READY AT SEVEN FIFTEEN. THE WEATHER
  PROMISES TO BE GOOD AND YOU SHOULD HAVE EXCELLENT FLIGHT.</p><br>

  <p>"An aeroplane," I gasped. "Of course, that is why he was kidding me about
  the weather."</p>

  <p>Wires and wireless were set working, though we had little hope that Royder
  would be found, because, as the aeroplane company told us, their passenger
  was not sure that he was going to Paris, and told them whimsically that he
  would "make up his mind in the air."</p>

  <p>I have reason to believe, however, that Royder already had his plans cut
  and dried. The machine actually descended near Liege, from whence all trace
  of the man was lost. Bogey was less fortunate. They captured him at eleven
  o'clock in the morning whilst he was still in bed, and under his pillow they
  found the missing bonds. "What I can't understand," said the Scotland Yard
  man to me after the capture was effected and a wailing Bogey had been
  conveyed to durance, "is why the other fellow gave him the Chilian bonds?
  They're almost impossible to negotiate unless you're very clever; they're so
  easily identified; and they're almost certain to bring their possessor to
  justice."</p>

  <p>I smiled, for I knew why Bogey had been the recipient of those impassable
  bonds, and three months later I received a letter, bearing the postmark of
  Buenos Aires, which confirmed me in my suspicions.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"I feel I owe you an apology for making such an improper
  use of you," it ran, "but Bogey got on to my scheme for smashing the Third
  National. It really wasn't mine, but the man, of whom I spoke, and he
  demanded to stand in halves. He knew the robbery would occur at nine o'clock,
  and I agreed to split the swag on the spot.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I despise Bogey. who is a vulgar blackmailer, and it is
  some relief to my conscience to know that 50 per cent of scoundrels engaged
  in this appalling crime are, or<br>
  is, now under lock and key. I don't think Bogey will blackmail for a long,
  long time. The weather here is very fine. It has been like this for a month
  and the weather reports promise us another fine day tomorrow, with light,
  variable winds."</p><br>

  <p>I was really annoyed with Lee Royder for that last bit. He need not have
  rubbed it in.</p>

  <h2><a id="story1-7"
     name="story1-7"></a>VII. &mdash; A DOCTOR'S JOLLIFICATION AND ITS
     SEQUEL</h2>

  <p class="first">I will now tell you the story of Dr. George Willerby, partly
  to demonstrate the fact that blackmailers are made and not born, and partly
  to show how the keenest of brains can become so dulled by fear that they
  depart from all the methods which common sense dictate and submit to the most
  infamous system of spoliation at the hands of the criminal classes. .</p>

  <p>Dr. George Willerby was, and is, a fashionable physician. He had a house
  in Harley Street, an estate in Kent, and a set of chambers in Northumberland
  Court. (I do not give the real names of persons or places in this
  series.)</p>

  <p>In addition to being a great physician he was a bright, witty companion.
  He had a host of friends in London society, and because he was such a good
  fellow he was constantly in demand at dinner parties. A rapid diagonist of
  high esteem, and altogether a brilliant healer, he did not confine himself
  exclusively to the wealthy classes. He had a little practice of his own,
  which had grown up in the course of the years amongst people of a humbler
  position in life, and he gave these the same care and attention he would have
  given to a Park Lane millionaire.</p>

  <p>If he had a fault&mdash;and it is a fault which has long since been
  corrected&mdash;it was that at one time of his life he was inclined to look
  upon the wine when it was bubbling. He was a connoisseur of champagne, and
  though he very seldom overstepped the rigid line, there were moments when he
  fell from grace.</p>

  <p>It happened one night that a number of doctors, very well known West End
  physicians and surgeons, foregathered at the house of a friend to celebrate
  the bestowal of a baronetcy upon one of their number. It was a Friday night,
  and Dr. Willerby had given notice to all his patients, high and low, that he
  would be out of town for the weekend, and had arranged for another doctor to
  take his work whilst he was away. He was, in fact, going to Brighton, but the
  main point is that there was an excuse for his casting aside all caution and
  letting himself go.</p>

  <p>It was the merriest of parties, which did not break up until the morning.
  Dr. Willerby was admittedly slightly the worse for wine&mdash;or the better,
  whichever way you look at it&mdash;and another very famous doctor suggest. a
  "soberer" in the shape of a small injection of strychnine. It is not an
  uncommon remedy, and was there and then applied though the surgeon who
  supplied the dose, being more than ordinarily cautious, made that dose the
  minimum.</p>

  <p>"Enough to get you home." he said laughingly.</p>

  <p>It is pretty certain that it was insufficient to have a sobering effect
  upon Willerby. He returned to his flat in Northumberland Court, and
  discovered. to his annoyance, one of his poorer clients literally sitting on
  the doorstep. "What the dickens do you want?" asked Willerby, who was still
  in a jovial frame of mind. "Didn't I leave word that I shouldn't be in town
  until Tuesday? You must go to Dr. Manson."</p>

  <p>Willerby recognised the man as a dissolute fellow who had come down in the
  world through drink and gambling, which had led him to speculation and a
  sentence of six months in gaol.</p>

  <p>"I'm extremely sorry. sir," said the caller, "but my little nephew is
  worse than ever tonight, and I think he's dying. I don't know where Dr.
  Manson's house is, and&mdash;" Willerby interrupted him with a genial laugh.
He
  was still feeling bright and cheerful, for the effects of the wine had been
  by no means modified as the result of the antidote.</p>

  <p>"All right; come along." he said.</p>

  <p>His car was waiting whilst this conversation was taking place. and
  together they drove to Camden Town. There were several children in the house,
  and Dr. Willerby suspected, not without reason. that these "nephews" of
  Smith's were children his sour-faced wife had adopted for a
  consideration.</p>

  <p>He made an examination of his little patient and saw that the case was a
  serious one. The child had heart trouble and was subject to fainting fits.
  Such remedies as he could apply or suggest, he suggested and applied. He was
  there for an hour, and at the end of that time he had the satisfaction of
  seeing the little sufferer take a decided turn for the better.</p>

  <p>He was still cheery, even garrulous.</p>

  <p>"You needn't have sent for me tonight at all." he exclaimed; "all you had
  to do was to carry out the instructions I gave you when I was here yesterday.
  I will write you a prescription. You had better go down to the chemist and
  get it made up. Get it at once."</p>

  <p>He wrote briefly on a sheet of paper and handed the prescription to the
  man.</p>

  <p>"And now, for heaven's sake. don't bother me till Tuesday."</p>

  <p>He drove home and went to bed, thinking no more of the incident. He was
  due to catch the 12 o'clock train front Victoria on Saturday morning, and he
  was half dressed when his valet came to say that a man had called and must
  see him at once on very urgent business.</p>

  <p>"What is his name?" asked Willerby.</p>

  <p>"Smith, sir." said the valet.</p>

  <p>"Smith?" frowned the doctor. "I told him to go to Manson. Confound the
  fellow. Show him in."</p>

  <p>So into the doctor's dressing room came the apologetic Smith, a lank,
  shifty man who spoke very good English, and as I found out afterwards, was a
  man who possessed a very superior education.</p>

  <p>"Well, Smith," asked Willerby, "how's the boy?"</p>

  <p>"He's dead. sir." said Smith.</p>

  <p>"Dead?" the doctor said incredulously, and Smith nodded.</p>

  <p>"When did he die?"</p>

  <p>"About four o'clock this morning, sir. He had a fainting fit."</p>

  <p>"Did you give him the medicine?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. sir," said the man meaningly. "I gave him the medicine."</p>

  <p>He emphasised the words, and Dr. Willerby looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"But he shouldn't have died," said the doctor emphatically, "even if he
  hadn't had the medicine. The wet fomentations would have brought him round.
  Did you use them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, we used them," said the man, and still there was a certain
  significance in his tone which the doctor did not like and could not
  understand.</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry," he said after a pause. "you want a certificate I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I want, sir," said the man. "Of course," he hesitated, "you
  understand, sir, that in the circumstances it is not usual."</p>

  <p>The doctor thrust his pin into his tie, thrust his hands into his pockets
  and stared at the man.</p>

  <p>"Not usual to give a death certificate to a patient I've been looking
  after for months? What do you mean, Smith?"</p>

  <p>The man licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he said. "You were very bright and fresh last night, and
  that's no business of mine. I don't see why a doctor shouldn't enjoy himself
  as well as anybody else in the world. Besides, you didn't expect to be called
  out, did you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said the doctor after a pause, and walked across to his
  dressing room and closed the door. "Now, be good enough to tell me what
  you're driving at."</p>

  <p>"I was saying, sir," said Smith. not meeting his eyes, "that you were a
  bit jolly last night."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I was," said Willerby, "but I don't see what that has got to do
  with the death of your nephew." The man put his hand in his inside pocket and
  deliberately drew out a white envelope. This he handed to the doctor.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" asked Willerby.</p>

  <p>"That's your prescription, sir."</p>

  <p>"The one I gave you last night&mdash;the digitalis mixture? I don't want to
  see it."</p>

  <p>"You didn't order digitalis at all, sir," said Smith in a hollow voice and
  the doctor snatched the paper from his hand, opened it and walked to the
  window.</p>

  <p>He remembered writing the description. "Liquor Digitalis" had been the
  first item. He read, then turned white.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he gasped, and well he might, for instead of "Digitalis" he
  had written "Strychninae." And, what is more he remembered writing it.</p>

  <p>In a flash it came back to him how strychnine had been on his mind. He
  even remembered forming the "s" with a flourish without having been conscious
  of doing so. He looked at the man.</p>

  <p>"Strychnine," he said dully. "I prescribed strychnine?" Smith nodded.</p>

  <p>The mystery of the child's death was no longer a mystery to Dr. Willerby.
  He folded the prescription methodically and put it on the table; then walking
  to the window, he stared out, his hands clasped behind him. "There'll have to
  be an inquest," he said at last; "this is a case of misadventure."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have an inquest if I were you, sir," said Smith. "It will all
  come out."</p>

  <p>"What will come out?" demanded Willerby.</p>

  <p>"It'll come out about your being drunk, sir," Smith said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to suggest that I was drunk when I gave that prescription?"
  demanded Willerby.</p>

  <p>"Well, I wouldn't say drunk, sir," said Smith, "let's say jolly&mdash;but
  that'll have to come out, anyway." Willerby knew that it was ruin, but ruin
  as it was he might have taken the step had not the insinuating Smith broken
  in upon his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Why worry about it, doctor?" he said. "It was an accident, and nothing
  could have saved the child&mdash;you've said that yourself a dozen times."</p>

  <p>"Where is the mixture?" asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I've got it here," said the other, and took a small phial of colourless
  liquid from his pocket.</p>

  <p>The doctor examined it. One dose had gone. He walked into his bathroom and
  emptied the contents. When he came back he found Smith pocketing the
  prescription. "I'll have that, too." said Willerby.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I don't think so." said the other, "I think under the
  circumstances I had better keep it, because it reflects somewhat upon
  me."</p>

  <p>"What do you think I'm going to do?" asked Willerby. "I think you're going
  to give a certificate that the child died of a heart disease," said Smith.
  "You'll be a lunatic if you don't."</p>

  <p>There was no mention of money or any consideration. If there had been any
  talk of money, the matter might have ended then and there, but there was not.
  Willerby was admittedly in a panic and taken off his feet. After so thick a
  night he was probably not in a position to think as clearly as otherwise he
  might have done. It is certain that he signed the certificate and that on
  that certificate the child was buried. It is also certain that he gave the
  man £50 in bank notes. This was on Saturday, the 18th of May, and the date is
  rather important.</p>

  <p>From thence onwards Smith became a regular pensioner. He started by asking
  for a loan a month after the occurrence, and the loan, the sum of £50, was
  immediately forwarded by the doctor. A month later he asked for another £50,
  this time without making any reference whatever to loans. From thence onwards
  it became a simple case of blackmail, which was borne by Dr. Willerby without
  complaint. £50 a month was not a great deal of money to him, but what
  troubled him was his unprofessional and illegal conduct, and there were times
  when he was on the point of consulting his colleagues as to the best course
  he should pursue. As a matter of fact, he need not have consulted anybody,
  because he knew in his heart just what he ought to have done. But now he was
  in the toils. He had taken the irrevocable step and must continue, and might,
  indeed, have continued had not the bold Smith suddenly without warning
  increased his demands from £50 to £100, and had followed the receipt of the
  first £100 by a request that the doctor should give him £5,000 to go away to
  America and "forget all about it." to use his own language.</p>

  <p>It was at this point that the doctor decided to consult me, and I received
  a letter requesting an interview at his flat. If I had been a doctor instead
  of a detective, I should have probably diagnosed him as a bad nerve case and
  ordered him away to the country. That's how he struck me when I first met
  him. It was clear from the first that he was distressed more than even the
  average victims of the blackmailers are.</p>

  <p>He told me his story haltingly, but, once he had made the plunge and had
  admitted that he was drunk, the rest seemed to become easy. The fact that he
  was worse for liquor when he gave the prescription naturally worried him much
  more than giving the certificate of death.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I haven't drunk anything since, and don't intend to," he said.
  "Now, Mr. Dixon, you understand these things. What do you advise?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"It all depends on what you want, doctor. If all you wish is to bring the
  man to justice, that is very simple. But I gather that, like the remainder of
  my clients, you have no desire for a Court case, and that you want the matter
  settled privately and amicably,"</p>

  <p>"If you mean that I want to be sure the man will not blackmail me again,
  or make any further demands upon me, you are partly right." he said. "Why I
  really sent for you was to ask you whether, in your opinion, I should brave
  the exposure, settling with this man and letting him get away to Australia or
  America, before I make my statement to the British Medical Council, or
  whether I should go on maintaining silence?"</p>

  <p>It was a very difficult problem he set me, and one which I had no desire
  to answer offhand. I doubt if any other man, similarly circumstanced, would
  have taken a different line. As I pointed out, there were so many people
  involved. There were, for example, the other doctors who had been at the
  party, and the doctor who had administered the strychnine, or who had
  suggested the strychnine, all of whom would come into the inquiry.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I realise all that," he said, "though I didn't realise it so vividly as I
  do at this moment. At all costs those gentlemen's names must be kept
  out."</p>

  <p>I thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Before I can advise you, doctor," I said, "I must ask you to let me
  conduct a little private investigation of my own. I want, for example, to
  know whether Smith is really going to America or whether this demand for five
  thousand pounds is one of many which will be put forward."</p>

  <p>Smith lived at 83 Bayham Place, Camden Town. It was a tiny little
  thoroughfare&mdash;or rather a <i>cul de sac</i>&mdash;the houses being mainly
  occupied by people of the respectable artisan class. No. 83 differed from
  none of its fellows in any respect.</p>

  <p>The door was opened at my knock by a yellow faced woman, who looked at me,
  I thought, a little nervously, for it is my misfortune that I <i>look</i>
  like a detective. "Is your husband in, Mrs. Smith?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," she said, after considering. "What is your business?"</p>

  <p>"I wish to see him on a little matter," said I. "Perhaps he would like to
  come for a walk?"</p>

  <p>I saw her eyes narrow.</p>

  <p>"Come for a walk?" she asked suspiciously. "Where,</p>

  <p>"It is nothing very serious;' I laughed, knowing that "Come for a walk" is
  to the English crook what "Get your hat" is to the American.</p>

  <p>I heard a voice behind her in the passage making an inquiry, and presently
  she was pushed aside and I saw the lanky Mr. Smith for the first time.</p>

  <p>"You want to see me, sir?" he asked, and his shifty eyes danced from side
  to side.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do, rather," I said, "will you get your hat and coat on?" (He was
  in his shirt sleeves.)</p>

  <p>He disappeared, to come back dressed for the street. "Now, I'm going to be
  very frank with you Mr. Smith,"</p>

  <p>I said. "I am a detective acting on behalf Dr. Willerby."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Willerby's got nothing against me." he said in a quavering voice, "I
  owe him a little money, but there's nothing in that, is there? But I've got
  something against him."</p>

  <p>"That's the very thing I've come to see you about," said I; "you're
  wanting the loan of five thousand pounds from the doctor. That is rather a
  large sum, Mr. Smith."</p>

  <p>"It is no more than I deserve," said the man, plucking up courage. when he
  discovered how mild a tone I was adopting, "if you know the case. you know
  very well that I'm saving that man from absolute ruin."</p>

  <p>I looked at him curiously. There was something in his modulated voice
  which almost suggested that there was a time when he would have described
  himself as a gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Still, five thousand pounds is a lot of money," I went on, at the same
  time eyeing him and allowing my thoughts to rove, "and I think he's done
  rather well for you, Mr. Smith&mdash;it doesn't cost you a lot to live, and it
  seems that fifty pounds a month is just about as much as you can spend."</p>

  <p>"Oh, is it?" said the man sarcastically, "you must let me be the best
  judge of that."</p>

  <p>"Suppose the doctor makes a confession; suppose he charges you with
  blackmail," said I, "it would go rather hard with you. Smith, with your
  previous conviction&mdash;by the way, what were you imprisoned for?"</p>

  <p>"Mind your own business," he growled, and I laughed. "It is a very simple
  matter to find out as you are so disobliging. It will only mean that I shall
  wander down to Scotland Yard and make a few independent inquiries."</p>

  <p>"Embezzlement," he said, and promptly changed his tone. "I was the
  unfortunate victim of circumstances."</p>

  <p>"What was your trade at the time?" I asked, and he looked at me steadily
  for about the space of a second.</p>

  <p>"Clerk," he replied, so emphatically that I knew he was lying. Then he
  went on: "I want the money to get away. I'm tired of this beastly life. How
  would you like to live here in these squalid surroundings? Five thousand
  pounds will set me up. I could open a shop in New York&mdash;the examinations
  are not difficult to pass." He stopped himself.</p>

  <p>"What examinations?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Customs examinations." he replied glibly. "I thought of setting up as an
  importer."</p>

  <p>"So five thousand is your price," said I, changing the subject. "I have to
  take that as your final offer to the doctor?"</p>

  <p>"You can tell him from me that if he gives me five thousand he'll never
  hear from me again."</p>

  <p>"Unless you go broke." said I, "and then he'll hear pretty quickly. All
  right, Smith, I'll see what can be done."</p>

  <p>It took me a couple of days to discover from Scotland Yard Smith's earlier
  offence. It had occurred years before, when he had borne another name.
  Fortunately, Dr. Willerby remembered that the man had been tried at the Old
  Street Police Court on the same day that he had been giving evidence in a
  murder case. That narrowed the inquiry down, and I had no difficulty in
  identifying Smith. I came back to the doctor with my discovery.</p>

  <p>"I have found a very curious fact, doctor," said I. "Did you know Smith's
  profession?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest idea," said he.</p>

  <p>"He was a chemist," said I, "in the employ of one of the big drug
  companies."</p>

  <p>"Well, what is there remarkable about that?" asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see," I said in triumph. "that Smith would have seen the
  prescription you wrote, and would have known that strychnine was a mistake.
  Therefore, he was an accessory, and indeed, more culpable than you, since he
  did what he did knowingly."</p>

  <p>"How does that help me?" asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>"That remains to be seen," said I, "but I rather think it will help you a
  lot."</p>

  <p>That day I pursued my inquiries, and in the evening I telephoned to the
  doctor, asking his permission to bring Smith along to the flat. The more
  delicate matter was to persuade Smith to come. He was suspicious, smelling a
  trap and refused point blank to go.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose I'm going to say anything in front of a third person,
  do you?" he asked. "No, Mr. Policeman, that dog doesn't bark."</p>

  <p>"You will not be asked to say anything." said I. "All I want you to do is
  to bring along the prescription." He looked at me, smiled slowly and
  winked.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "I'll oblige you."</p>

  <p>I certainly didn't expect that he would take the matter so easily, and
  when I turned up that evening opposite Cobden's statue, which I had fixed as
  our rendezvous, I very much doubted whether he would put in an appearance. To
  my surprise, however, he arrived at the moment, fortified with a large,
  defiant cigar.</p>

  <p>"What made him bring you into the case?" he asked when we got into the
  cab.</p>

  <p>"Self defence," said I. "If you had stuck at your fifty a month, you might
  have drawn a pension all your life. As it is, you stand in considerable
  danger of spending the next ten years of your life in Portland Gaol."</p>

  <p>He laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," said he. "don't you worry! It would be a clever man who
  could get me gaoled again!"</p>

  <p>"That may be the case," said I. "At any rate, my friend, you're going to
  lose your very comfortable pension."</p>

  <p>"Am I?" he said, significantly, "you wait till I see the doctor."</p>

  <p>We had not long to wait. Presently the cab drew up before the block of
  flats where the doctor lived, and we mounted to the second floor. The doctor
  was waiting to receive us, so unlike his old self that even Smith was taken
  aback. The doctor greeted him with a nod, and drew me into an inner room.</p>

  <p>"I have decided, Dixon," he said, "to make a full confession to the
  British Medical Council and then go away for two or three years, unless, of
  course, I am prosecuted."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it will come to that," said I, but he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am losing my nerve," he said, "and I am no longer fit to carry on my
  profession. The other consultants are talking about me, and the best thing I
  can do is to get out. Anyway, I have arranged for a locum to take over my
  practice for three months. If we can settle with this brute, and I am
  persuaded that a confession to the Medical Council is not desirable, then I
  shall certainly take a holiday and sell my practice."</p>

  <p>I said nothing, knowing what I knew. We returned to the room where we had
  left Smith, who was evidently uneasy at our conference and suspected all
  manner of plots.</p>

  <p>"Now, Smith." said I, "I want to talk to you very plainly. You understand
  that nothing which may be said in this room will go outside, unless it is
  repeated in a court of law. In the first place, doctor," said I, "how much
  money has this man actually had from you?"</p>

  <p>"About two thousand pounds," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"That is a respectable sun, Smith. most of which, I should imagine, you
  have put away in the bank. You are living very frugally&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What I do with my money is no concern of yours," said Smith calmly.</p>

  <p>"It is no concern of mine, but it may be of yours, if you have some money
  saved, and the doctor, in a forgiving frame of mind, refrains from
  prosecuting you."</p>

  <p>Smith grunted something&mdash;what it was I could not catch.</p>

  <p>"Now, perhaps you will show me the prescription which you promised to
  bring along?"</p>

  <p>Again Smith smiled and took from his pocket an envelope, from which he
  extracted&mdash;a photograph.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose I was going to bring the original along, do you?" he
  said&mdash;that wise fellow.</p>

  <p>I took the photograph in my hands.</p>

  <p>"This will do." said I; "in fact it will do just as well as the original
  document."</p>

  <p>It was a photograph of the fatal prescription which the doctor had signed,
  and I handed it to Willerby. He glanced at it and nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is it," he said.</p>

  <p>"It was given by you in the early morning of the 18th of May," said I. I
  pointed to the impression of a rubber stamp on the original prescription.
  "That is the chemist's name, put on all prescriptions that are made up, I
  understand?"</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded again. Smith had his eyes on me and never took them
  off.</p>

  <p>"The child died at four o'clock in the morning, didn't he?" I asked,
  turning to Smith.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"After taking one dose of this medicine?" I tapped the prescription.</p>

  <p>Smith nodded again.</p>

  <p>"Then." said I, speaking with emphasis, "will you explain how it comes
  about that that prescription was not made up until nine o'clock in the
  morning, five hours after the child's death?"</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," said Smith hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly true," said I. "The chemist was on duty himself that
  night, and showed me his night book to prove that he had not been called out.
  He also showed me his prescription book, which gave the hour at which the
  prescription was handed in by you, and dispensed by him."</p>

  <p>I looked at Willerby. His mouth was open wide as the significance of the
  revelation dawned upon him. "Then&mdash;then&mdash;" he gasped, "the child did
  not die from poison?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"He died, I should imagine, from heart disease," I said. "Smith, who is a
  chemist, saw the prescription and knew that you had made a mistake. He kept
  it by him, hoping probably to do a little blackmailing on your error. When
  the child died, possibly as the result of his or his wife's neglect, he saw
  the bigger chance, went to the chemist the first thing in the morning, got
  the prescription made up, and brought a portion of it to you. The certificate
  you signed was proper and valid; at any rate, the child did not die of
  strychnine poisoning."</p>

  <p>Smith had sunk back in his chair shaking like a leaf. "Is that true,
  Smith?" I asked sternly. "You've got one minute to decide whether you'll tell
  the truth or whether you'll take your trial for blackmail. The doctor has
  nothing to fear, and there is absolutely no reason why he shouldn't go into
  the box."</p>

  <p>It was some time before the man could speak.</p>

  <p>"Give me some water," he said faintly, and when he had taken a big gulp he
  told the story:</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly true, sir," he wailed, "I saw the prescription after
  you'd given it, and I knew you'd made a mistake. The idea of pretending that
  the child had been poisoned came to me after. You're not going to prosecute
  me, sir?" he pleaded.</p>

  <p>Dr. Willerby pointed to the door with an unsteady hand. "Get out," he
  said.</p>

  <p>What he said to me after the man had left, modesty prevents my
  writing.</p>

  <h2><a id="story1-8"
     name="story1-8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE MILLIONAIRE'S SECRET</h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. MIDDLETON, returning to her Park Lane residence at one
  o'clock in the morning, was surprised to see a light in her drawing room, and
  surprised because her husband usually retired to bed early. She herself had
  gone to a charity ball at the Albert Hall and had not expected to return, as
  she had intended staying with her sister-in-law in Hans Crescent (I am giving
  the dry details as they were roughly noted by me in my case book, but, of
  course, I am not giving real names of persons or places).</p>

  <p>She opened the door with her key, closed it noiselessly, and went up the
  heavily carpeted stairs to the first floor, on which the drawing room was
  situated. She expected nothing sensational except to find, perhaps, that her
  husband had fallen asleep over his paper, as he did occasionally, and opened
  the door of the drawing room with a word of reproof on her lips. That word
  was never spoken.</p>

  <p>Instead, she stood struck dumb with amazement at the sight which met her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Seated at the table in the middle&mdash;of the room were two
persons&mdash;her
  husband and a girl. The girl was poorly dressed, or, as Mrs. Middleton
  described it, she was dressed "commonly." She was neither pretty nor plain.
  They sat on either side of the table, and between them was a huge pile of
  bank notes which Mr. Middleton was counting. He was speaking, and Mrs.
  Middleton heard him make a reference to "Constance."</p>

  <p>He looked up suddenly and saw his wife. and his face went pale.</p>

  <p>"Why, Agnes," he stammered. "I thought you were&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is this woman?" demanded Mrs. Middleton with pardonable acerbity.</p>

  <p>"This is a&mdash;a&mdash;friend of mine," said Mr. Middleton awkwardly; "or
  rather, her father is a friend of mine; he does some work for me&mdash;and she
  called for payment."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Middleton's eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"At one o'clock in the morning?" she asked incredulously, "And do you
  usually pay your friends in bank notes&mdash;at one o'clock in the
  morning,"</p>

  <p>Mr. Middleton licked his lips, and, according to his wife, was incapable
  of speech. Nevertheless, he was not incapable of action. Very carefully he
  wrapped up the bank notes and handed them to the girl, who had not broken
  silence.</p>

  <p>"That will be all, Miss Jones." he said. "Tell your father I hope that
  settles our account."</p>

  <p>The girl. with no look at the indignant wife, walked out of the room, down
  the stairs and let herself out of the front door, in a manner, as Mrs.
  Middleton told me, that suggested that this was not the first visit she had
  paid to 604 Park Lane.</p>

  <p>Waiting until the door closed, Mrs. Middleton turned upon her husband.</p>

  <p>"Now, perhaps, you will explain this extraordinary scene," she
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"It requires no further explanation than that which I have given you,"
  said her husband doggedly.</p>

  <p>"And who is 'Constance,' might I ask?" asked Mrs. Middleton, tapping her
  foot&mdash;an ominous sign, "Constancy, or whatever the creature's name
  is?"</p>

  <p>Middleton stared at her.</p>

  <p>"You heard that, did you? Oh, well, she's another friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have some queer friends, Frederick." said his wife. "Is
  'Constance' also in the habit of seeing you at one o'clock in the
  morning?"</p>

  <p>Middleton shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"This is not a matter which concerns you at all, Agnes, and I beg of you
  to keep out of it," he said. "I'm doing a great deal to save you from worry,
  and I am entitled to some better reward than your suspicions."</p>

  <p>"Will you explain&mdash;" began his wife.</p>

  <p>"I will explain nothing," said Middleton sharply. "You can either take my
  word that this is a transaction which does not concern you, or else you
  needn't. I certainly am not going to tell you any more, either now or at any
  other time."</p>

  <p>Again Mrs. Middleton's eyebrows rose, and without a word she left the
  room. Behold, next morning, her electric landaulette outside my office door,
  and Mrs. Middleton sitting opposite to me, in my private office.</p>

  <p>"I should never, of course, have employed a private detective unless I was
  certain that something was very wrong," she said. "You understand, Mr. Dixon,
  that my connections are such that I cannot tolerate even a breath of scandal
  associated with my name. My father was the son of Lord&mdash;". She gave me a
  long string of aristocratic connections, and lectured me for ten minutes on
  the stainlessness of a hundred family escutcheons to which she might claim
  relationship, and ended by haggling with me over the cost of my services.
  This discussion, however, I brought to a quick conclusion.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Middleton," said I, "I am a fairly busy man, and I do not care to
  undertake any new commissions. If you wish to have your husband watched I
  will undertake to carry out the work, but it must be done in a proper manner,
  and you must be prepared to pay the cost. When we are watching a millionaire
  we must employ a man who, in appearance, in dress, and in social manner, is
  fit to go into the company which millionaires keep. You quite understand
  that?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shall have to pay it," she grumbled. "Now you quite
  understand. I want my husband followed. I want to know first of all who this
  'Constance' is, because I am certain that the wretched woman I saw with my
  husband was her servant, who had come to collect money from him."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you can give me a little information before you go, Mrs.
  Middleton. Your husband is, of course. well known to me. He is the chairman
  of several West Australian Gold Mining Companies. Would it be indiscreet to
  ask how he made his money?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Middleton hesitated. Her aristocratic soul recoiled from admitting
  that her millionaire husband had not been born a millionaire, the son of a
  millionaire, and the last of a long line of millionaires.</p>

  <p>"He made his money in Western Australia," she said. "He has always been
  interested in mining propositions, and as a young man spent some years in
  South Africa. It was from South Africa that he went to Western Australia, and
  there he made his lucky strike."</p>

  <p>"Has he any enemies, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"None," she answered in surprise. "What makes you ask such a question like
  that? It is his friends that I'm complaining of, not his enemies."</p>

  <p>"Is there a possibility that he is being blackmailed?" said I and she
  laughed scornfully at the very idea.</p>

  <p>Trailing Mr. Middleton was not a very difficult business, because he was a
  man of regular habits. He arrived at his office in Throgmorton Street at a
  certain hour, left for lunch at another hour, dined at the same restaurant at
  the identical table every day of his life, and went home to Park Line, never
  failing to arrive between five o'clock and ten minutes past. He had a
  manager, an assistant manager, a secretary, and four clerks, all males; there
  were three stenographers in his office, none of whom were named. "Constance,"
  and all bore irreproachable characters.</p>

  <p>My experience is that such scandals, as Mrs. Middleton knows for herself,
  are very easily revealed. They begin and end in a man's office, and if they
  adventure abroad at all are usually reported.</p>

  <p>But Middleton, thickset, slightly bald, dark moustached (I guessed that
  was dyed), sober of demeanour and speech, was not one of that kind. He
  devoted the whole of his time to business, and was accounted in the City as
  one of the brightest intellects engaged in commerce. At the end of a week
  Mrs. Middleton called upon me as by arrangement, expecting I do not know what
  horrid disclosures.</p>

  <p>"Nothing!" she said shrilly. "You found nothing! What do you think I pay
  you for?"</p>

  <p>"I can assure you, madam, that you are not paying me to manufacture
  evidence against your husband," said I. "You are paying me to discover the
  truth and the truth is, as I have told you, that he has not met any woman
  named Constance or Jenny or Jane, other than his stenographer, that he has
  come straight to his office every morning and gone straight home every
  evening. The only night he has been out was on Thursday last, when he
  accompanied a lady to the Empire. The lady in question was a rather florid
  woman, somewhat overdressed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are speaking of my dear sister," said Mrs. Middleton coldly. "I know
  all about that."</p>

  <p>"Well," She said, rising, with a sigh of disappointment, "we'll have to
  see what the next week reveals."</p>

  <p>"But I am not prepared to reveal it, Mrs. Middleton." said I. "You must
  find another agency."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" said the energetic lady. "You started the work and you've got
  to carry it out; besides; Lady Granger tells me that you are the best agency
  in London and the most reliable."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless&mdash; I began, when Mrs. Middleton, who had walked to the
  window and was looking out upon the street, interrupted me with a cry.</p>

  <p>"Look! Look!" she said. "Quick, quick!"</p>

  <p>I ran to her. She was pointing to the opposite side of the street.</p>

  <p>"That's the girl," she said excitedly, "the girl who came to my husband.
  Oh, do, please, please, Mr. Dixon, bring her in and ask her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I snatched up my hat and ran down the stairs. Opposite my office is a
  large drapery emporium, and the girl Mrs. Middleton had indicated was looking
  at the window. I had no difficulty in picking her up again, but did not
  intend following Mrs. Middleton's suggestion and ask her into my office.
  Instead I trailed her for two hours, without much difficulty, because she was
  in a sauntering, shopping mood. I followed her from one store to another, and
  noted that she had plenty of money. Her purchases she stuffed into a taxi cab
  which crawled about after her from shop to shop.</p>

  <p>At the end she gave the driver his final instructions.</p>

  <p>"99 Lexington Gardens," she said. And I followed her in another taxi.</p>

  <p>Lexington Gardens is a quiet street in Bayswater, once the abiding place
  of middle class plutocracy, but now entirely given up to boarding houses. It
  was to one of these boarding houses she drove, commanding a scowling maid to
  carry in her multitudinous purchases.</p>

  <p>"Can I give you a hand?" said I, having by this time descended.</p>

  <p>The maid looked up, caught my smile and grinned.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, sir; I can manage. Too much of a lady to carry in
  her own stuff," she replied bitterly, "I tell you, when the lower orders get
  on in the world they're unbearable."</p>

  <p>I was busy piling the parcels in her arms.</p>

  <p>"You mean that lady that just went in?"</p>

  <p>"Lady!" she scoffed. "Why, she's as common as Saturday afternoon!"</p>

  <p>I laughed at this novel comparison, and she went on.</p>

  <p>"Her and her old man are a pair, they are. The way they order you about,
  you'd think you were dirt."</p>

  <p>"I thought I recognised her," said I. "She's a Miss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mincing her name is. They've come into a lot of money lately. They're no
  more fit to be in a decent boarding house than I'm fit to be in the Zoo.
  There's the old man now." she said, lowering her voice.</p>

  <p>A man was coming down the steps to assist with the parcels; a hard faced
  thin lipped man, with a settled frown puckering his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up with them parcels," he said loudly. "Don't stand gossiping, or
  I'll complain to your missus."</p>

  <p>"For my part," said the exasperated maid, "you can go to&mdash;!" and she
  flounced up the steps and disappeared into the wide hall.</p>

  <p>"I'd give a 'undred pounds," said Mr. Mincing thoughtfully, "to take her
  by the scruff of the neck and shake her life out of her. The cheek of these
  slaveys! Are you a boarder?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I thought of becoming one," said I. "In fact, I have just driven up to
  find out if there is a room vacant."</p>

  <p>"It's not much of a place." said Mr. Mincing deprecatingly; "I'm thinking
  of changing to a better class neighbourhood. I've come into a lot of money,"
  he said unnecessarily.</p>

  <p>"So I understand," said I.</p>

  <p>"Who told you?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, everybody in the neighbourhood knows," I replied. hoping that he
  would not wonder how I, a stranger, came to know the gossip of Lexington
  Gardens.</p>

  <p>He changed the conversation abruptly, and obeying an impulse, I walked
  into the house, interviewed the harassed little landlady and booked a room.
  This gave me the opportunity of interviewing the maid again and putting a few
  questions to her.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," she said. "there's no other woman in that party, only Mr.
  Mincing and his daughter."</p>

  <p>"Nobody named Constance?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Two's enough, and more than enough for Clara," she said grimly. "If there
  was a family of Mincings staying here, I shouldn't be that's all."</p>

  <p>"Where do they come from?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Somewhere down Walworth way," said the girl, busily making my bed. "I
  know that because the young man who serves us with groceries used to live in
  the same street. Old Mincing was as poor as a church mouse. Him and his
  daughter lived in a couple of rooms.'</p>

  <p>"When did they come into money?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"About six months ago," said the girl. "At least, that's when they moved
  in here. He's got a big income from somewhere&mdash;he gets it once a
  quarter&mdash;and when the stuff comes in you can't get into their rooms for
  the muck they buy."</p>

  <p>I made a few more inquiries, and then went out and telephoned to my house,
  telling my man to pack my bag and send it to Lexington Gardens by special
  messenger. I had also to telephone to my office to relieve Mrs. Middleton of
  anxiety. She wanted me to give her a full account of the morning's work over
  the telephone, but this I respectfully declined. I would have thrown the case
  up then and there but for the fact that there was an element of mystery in
  the business which particularly appealed to me. I wanted to spend at least
  one night under the same roof that sheltered Mr. Mincing, and to know
  something more of his habits. As to these, the maid Clara was very
  communicative.</p>

  <p>"They go out every night to a cinema," she said; "sometimes to a music
  hall, but generally to one of the picture shows."</p>

  <p>That suited me down to the ground. I met them at dinner that night&mdash;an
  awkward, self conscious pair. After dinner I managed to get into conversation
  with Mr. Mincing. I told him that I had just returned from America, and spoke
  enthusiastically of that country. He was apathetic. I said I did not like it
  as much as Australia, and raved of the wonderful climate of that great
  oversea State. He said yes and no, and was obviously bored.</p>

  <p>"But perhaps," I suggested, "Australia wasn't a patch on South Africa." I
  saw his eyes light up.</p>

  <p>"In a way," he admitted grudgingly, "but I never want to go to South
  Africa again."</p>

  <p>"You've been there, then?" said I.</p>

  <p>"For a little while," he said.</p>

  <p>I spoke of Johannesburg; he did not know it. Of Durban; he had been there
  once for a day or two on a ship. Capetown&mdash;obviously he knew Capetown
  inside out. Happily, so do I. We talk. about Adderly Street, of the Kloof, of
  the wonders of Wynberg and Simonstown and the railway that skirts the
  sea.</p>

  <p>"How long is it since you left there?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, twenty years," said he carelessly. "The place must have changed a lot
  since I came away,</p>

  <p>"Were you there long?"</p>

  <p>"About ten years," he said shortly, and changed the subject.</p>

  <p>If my theory was correct, it was in South Africa that Mincing had met
  Middleton. I had already dismissed from my mind his vacant faced daughter as
  being anything but an agent. But who was Constance? Was there another
  daughter?</p>

  <p>I went up to my room, which was on the same floor as the Mincings', and
  presently I heard his deep bass voice calling his daughter impatiently, and
  they descended the stairs together and passed out of the house. He had locked
  his door, but that presented no great difficulty. In houses of this character
  the key of one room will open most. I called the maid and took her into my
  confidence. She was thrilled at the idea of my being a detective, and wildly
  excited at the possibility of my investigations being directed to the undoing
  of the hated Mincings. She was a sensible kind of shrewd, Cockney girl, that
  one could trust; otherwise I should not have told her, but it was necessary
  that my investigations should not be interrupted, and I gave her instructions
  to keep guard on the stairs whilst I conducted a search through such private
  documents as the Mincings possessed.</p>

  <p>In truth, there was very little documentary evidence either for or against
  the man. Except what papers he had in a shabby little red morocco satchel,
  fastened by one of those patent locks which any average hairpin can open.
  There were letters, apparently from his dead wife, which told me nothing; and
  there was a photograph of a landscape, a glorious landscape it must have
  been, with its high, upstanding hills in the background, its pine-covered
  slopes and white roads. There was no inscription on the mount, and it was
  evidently the work of an amateur.</p>

  <p>What I did discover was a small notebook in which were scrawled six pages
  of more or less unintelligible notes. Some of these it was impossible to
  decipher, but towards the end I came upon this:</p>

  <p>"Good idea. If Med won't part, send picture con and break."</p>

  <p>Con and break! Where was Con's picture? I searched again, without result.
  Again I looked through his letters. There were no envelopes, but as one of
  the epistles was signed "Jane Mincing" I gathered that the man was not
  passing under any other name than his own. The search for the girl's
  photograph was in vain, the only photograph of any kind in the satchel being
  that pleasant landscape which had excited my admiration.</p>

  <p>I was replacing the letters when a triangular scrap of fell from between
  them. It was evidently a torn portion of an envelope, one of those thin, grey
  envelopes which are used for foreign postage. I flashed my electric lamp upon
  it, but saw no more than a row of figures, "718-11911." I put this in my
  waistcoat pocket, replaced the case, and came out to relieve the frantic
  anxiety of the. maid.</p>

  <p>My investigations did not promise well, for all that I had in the shape of
  a clue was a scrap of paper on which somebody had jotted a number, which
  might mean anything or nothing, a reference to a "Con" and to "break", which
  was obscure; and I was as far off discovering Mr. Middleton's secret as ever.
  I summoned the maid and told her that I should be out all night, asking her
  not to mention the fact to her mistress. Then I made my way slowly
  homeward.</p>

  <p>It was as I was standing at the Piccadilly Tube bookstall that the mystery
  was partially solved. I was looking at the books arrayed in shelves at the
  back, behind the masses of current literature, and Kipling's new volume
  caught my eye. The name of the writer set my thoughts wandering to his
  poetry, which I love, and I found myself repeating favourite old stanzas of
  mine&mdash;and then the revelation came.</p>

  <p>I called a cab and drove down to the Eastern Cable Company's office and
  dispatched an urgent wire. My next step was the boldest. I would see Mr.
  Middleton himself, although it was against all the instructions which I had
  received from his wife.</p>

  <p>Middleton was at home and alone. However much he might stand in awe of his
  wife, he had a short, sharp way with strangers.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked brusquely.</p>

  <p>"A private interview," said I, looking meaningly at the butler.</p>

  <p>He hesitated, then dismissed the servant with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir," he said. "I don't do business in my house; and however urgent
  your errand is, it could wait until tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Not this," said I coolly. "because I am most anxious to finish my
  interview with you before your wife returns from the opera."</p>

  <p>"What is it about?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is about John Mincing," said I slowly and speaking with emphasis.</p>

  <p>His start was almost imperceptible.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he said.</p>

  <p>"First of all," said I, "I must tell you, Mr. Middleton, that I am
  betraying the confidence of your wife. I am a private detective employed by
  her to watch you; but I hope that when you have heard all the circumstances
  you will not be distressed by that apparent want of faith."</p>

  <p>"Watch?" he said incredulously. "My wife asked you to watch me? In
  heaven's name, why?"</p>

  <p>Before I could answer, a light dawn. on him and he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Good God! Yes, that girl whom she saw me with here. So that aroused her
  suspicions, eh? I thought it might, but I didn't believe she would go to the
  length of watching me. Now what have you got to say about John Mincing? That
  seems to be the more important."</p>

  <p>"I have been following you," said "to discover the whereabouts of a
  mysterious lady named Constance&mdash;a name, by the way, which your wife
heard
  when she came in upon you the other evening."</p>

  <p>"Constance?" said he puzzled. "What Constance? I don't know any girl named
  Constance."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I have reason to believe that you did not say
  Constance," said I. "The word you used was 'Constantia'."</p>

  <p>He stared at me and bit his lips.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Constantia is a beautiful suburb of Capetown," I continued. "One is
  Constantia and the other is the Breakwater, and I have reason to believe, Mr.
  Middleton, that you have made the acquaintance of both places."</p>

  <p>His face was drawn, and he was evidently in great distress of mind. He did
  not speak for some time, but sat at the table, his head in his hands.
  Presently he looked up.</p>

  <p>"You're quite right," he said, "and I congratulate you upon your acumen. I
  served five years in those two hells for illicit diamond buying in
  Kimberley."</p>

  <p>"And a fellow convict was John Mincing." I suggested.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I should like to say that I was wrongfully accused and that I was
  punished unjustly," said Middleton, "but if I did, I should be telling a lie.
  I did buy diamonds from the natives at Kimberley against the law, and I was
  caught with the goods and sent down for seven years. I served five years of
  my sentence, partly on the Breakwater, partly at Constantia, and at the end
  of that time I left for Australia, where I made my strike. Mincing was a
  fellow convict. We worked in the same gang. In fact, we were chained together
  for work on the roads. I was not convicted in my own name, you understand,
  and I have always hoped and prayed that the rich Middleton would never be
  associated with the poor devil who worked in broad arrows for the Cape
  Government for five long and weary years. Mincing was serving twenty years
  for murder. He was a bad character, and feared even by the warders."</p>

  <p>"His number," I interrupted. "was 718-11911."</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is right," he said. "I remember it perfectly. Well, as I was saying,
  I left for Australia and made my strike. I never expected to be identified,
  and should not have been if my wife hadn't dragged me off to a garden party,
  where I was photographed as one of the celebrities. By a curious trick of
  photography the picture made me look younger than I was, and Mincing, looking
  over an old copy of the illustrated weekly in which it appeared, recognised
  me instantly, and through his daughter began to blackmail me."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you inform the police?" I asked. "After all, Mr. Middleton,
  the police are very humane, and they would not hold up against you your past
  folly."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You forget my wife," he said shortly. "I dared not risk the truth coming
  out, and it was easier to pay than to be exposed."</p>

  <p>I rose.</p>

  <p>"So that's that," I said. "Now I've got to find a story for your wife, and
  that's going to be the most difficult of all."</p>

  <p>"What about Mincing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll settle with Mincing." said I, "You'll never be troubled with him
  again. He has only to believe that you have placed the matter in the hands of
  the police for him to fade away and never be heard of again. But your wife is
  difficult. She is determined to find a Constance, and won't be satisfied with
  any substitute."</p>

  <p>"I think you may leave my wife to me." said Middleton after a moment's
  thought, and I was content to do so. I never saw Mrs. Middleton again, but at
  the end of the week she sent me a very handsome cheque and a simple line of
  thanks. I should imagine that Middleton told his wife, relying upon the
  goodness which is within the heart of every woman, however acidulated. I have
  often wondered, in the course of the years I have been following my
  profession, why husbands do not tell wives, and wives tell husbands much more
  than they do. If there were a little more frankness between married people, I
  should lose seventy-five per cent of my work, so on the whole perhaps, things
  are better as they are&mdash;from my point of view!</p>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2"></a>WARM AND DRY</h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p>I WENT down to see Superintendent Minter just before the election began.
  He heard that I was going to participate in the fray with a visible sneer on
  his homely face. "Politics!" he said. "Good Lord! At your time of life! Well,
  well, well! I've known a lot of fellows who took up that game, but nobody
  that ever made it pay, except Nippy the Nose, who used to travel the country
  and burgle the candidates' rooms when they were out addressing meetings.</p>

  <p>"You know a lot about the hooks and the getabits of life, and you know
  that they're all specialists. If a man's a lob crawler&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's a lob crawler? I've forgotten."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent shook his dead sadly. "You're forgetting everything,"
  he said. "I suppose it's these politics. A lob crawler's a man who goes into
  a little shop on his hands and knees, passes round the counter and pinches
  the till. There's not much of it nowadays, and anyway in these bad times
  there's nothing in the till to pinch. But once a lob crawler, always a lob
  crawler. If you go on the whizz&mdash;and I don't suppose you want me to tell
  you that whizzing is pocket-picking&mdash;you spend your life on the whizz. If
  you're a burglar, you're always a burglar. I've never yet met a burglar who
  was also a con man. That's the criminal's trouble he's got no originality,
  and thank the Lord for it! If they didn't catch themselves we'd never catch
  'em. Nippy was an exception. He'd try everything once. If you went into the
  Record Office at Scotland Yard and turned up his M.O. card, which
  means&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what a modus operandi card is," I said.</p>

  <p>The Superintendent nodded his head approvingly. "That's right. Don't let
  these politics put business out of your mind. As I say, if you turned up his
  M.O. card you'd have a shock. He's been convicted of larceny, burglary,
  obtaining money by a trick, pocket-picking. luggage- pinching&mdash;everything
  except blackmail. It's a funny thing that none of the regulars will ever
  admit they've committed blackmail, and there's not one of them that wouldn't
  if he had the chance and the intelligence.</p>

  <p>"I used to know Nippy; in fact I got two of his convictions. Nothing
  upsets a police officer more than these general practitioners, because we are
  always looking for specialists. We know there are about six classes of
  burglars. There's a class that never attempts to break into a live shop, by
  which I mean a shop where people are living in the rooms upstairs; and
  there's a class that never goes into a dead joint, which, you will remember,
  is a lockup shop with nobody on the premises. And naturally, when we get a
  burglary with any peculiar features, we go through the M.O. cards and pick
  out a dozen men who are likely to have done the job, and after we've sorted
  'em out and found which of 'em were in stir and which of 'em are out of the
  neighbourhood, we'll pull in the remainder one by one and give them the once
  over.</p>

  <p>"So that when there was a real big bust in Brockley, and we went over the
  M.O. cards, we never dreamt of looking for Nippy, because he hadn't done that
  sort of thing before; and we wouldn't have found him, but we got the office
  from a fence in Islington that Nippy had tried to sell him a diamond brooch.
  When you get a squeak from a fence its because he has offered too low a price
  for stolen property, and the thief has taken it elsewhere. "Nippy got a
  stretch, and the next time he came into our hands it was for something
  altogether different&mdash;trying to persuade a Manchester cotton man to buy a
  tenth share in a Mexican oilfield. Nippy would have got away with the loot,
  but unfortunately he knew nothing about geography, and when he said that
  Mexico was in South Africa the cotton man was a little suspicious and looked
  up the map.</p>

  <p>"Nippy was a nice fellow, always affable, generally well-dressed. and a
  great favourite with the ladies. When I say 'ladies' I mean anybody that wore
  silk stockings and used lipstick.</p>

  <p>"Nippy used to do a bit of nosing, too, but I didn't know he was making a
  regular business of it. Now, a nose is a very useful fellow. Without a nose
  the police wouldn't be able to find half the criminals that come through
  their hands. I suppose I'm being vulgar and ought to call them police
  informers, but 'nose' has always been good enough for me, because, naturally,
  I'm a man without any refinement.</p>

  <p>"I happened to be walking down Piccadilly towards Hyde Park Corner when I
  saw Nippy. He tipped his hat and was going on when I claimed him. 'Good
  morning, Sooper,' he said. 'I'm just on me way to the office. I'm going
  straight now; I'm an agent, and everything's warm and dry. I've opened a
  little business in Wardour Street,' he said.</p>

  <p>"Nippy had opened lots of businesses, mostly with a chisel and a
  three-piece jemmy, but I gathered that he had opened this one by paying the
  rent in advance. All criminals tell you they're going straight. Usually
  they're going straight from one prison to another. There are exceptions, but
  I've never heard of 'em,</p>

  <p>"We had a few minutes' conversation. He told me where his office was, and
  I promised to look him up. He was so happy about me calling that I thought he
  was lying, but when I dropped in a few days afterwards I found that he had a
  room on the third floor. I expected to find that he was the managing director
  of the Mountains in the Moon Exploration Company, or else the secretary of a
  new invention for getting gold out of the sea. It was a bit surprising to
  find his real name, Norman Ignatius Percival Young, on the glass panel. It
  was now that I found what he was agent for. He was standing in with the very
  fence who had given him away on his last conviction, and I suspected he was
  doing the same job. Anyway, he was full of information about various people,
  and he gave me a tip that afternoon to prove his&mdash;what's the word? Yes,
  bona fides&mdash;that's French, isn't it? I made a pretty good capture&mdash;a
  man called Juggy Jones, who did a lot of motor-car pinching, and was in with
  a big crowd up at Shadwell, who took the cars, repaired them and shipped them
  off to India. There's many a grand family car running round Madras, loaded to
  the water-line with little Eurasians.</p>

  <p>"Anyway. Juggy was a very sensible man, and if ever a thief could be
  described as intelligent that man was Juggy. He didn't talk much. He was a
  big fellow, about six feet two, with a face as cheerful as the ace of spades.
  But if he didn't say much he did a lot of thinking. I took him out of a cafe,
  where he was having dinner with a lady friend, and we walked down to the
  station together and I charged him. He said nothing, but when he came up
  before the magistrate and heard the evidence and was committed for trial, he
  asked me to see him in his cell.</p>

  <p>" 'I shouldn't be at all surprised, Sooper,' he said, 'if I know the name
  of the man who shopped me.'</p>

  <p>" 'And I shouldn't be surprised either, Juggy,' I said, 'because you've
  known me for years.'</p>

  <p>"But he shook his head and said nothing else. Somebody got at the
  witnesses for the Crown, and when they went into the box at the Old Bailey
  they gave the sort of evidence that wouldn't bring about a conviction, and it
  looked as if he was going to get an acquittal and something out of the poor
  box to compensate him for his wounded feelings, when the prosecuting counsel
  took a pretty strong line with one witness, who, after he had changed his
  evidence three times, said just enough to convict Juggy on one count. He went
  down for a carpet. Am I being vulgar? Let me say he went down for six months;
  a very lucky man. If we could have convicted him on the other indictments
  he'd have taken a dose of penal servitude. Naturally Nippy didn't appear in
  court. I wondered what he was getting out of it. It was a long time
  afterwards that I found out that there was a quarrel between the two rings as
  to who the stuff should be shipped to, and Nippy had been put in to make the
  killing. He gave us one or two bits of information which were useful, but you
  could see that he was just acting for the fence. I made a few inquiries up
  Islington way, and I found out that whenever the police went to him to find
  out about stolen property he referred them to the gentleman in Wardour Street
  who'd be able to tell them something.</p>

  <p>"Now a thief who's earning a regular living has never got enough money,
  and I was pretty certain that Nippy was doing something on the side. because
  he began to have his old prosperous look and attend the races. As a matter of
  fact, though I didn't know it, he was working up a connection with a gang of
  luggage thieves. I found this out when he came on to my manor&mdash;into my
  division, I mean. I found him at a railway station acting in a suspicious
  manner, and I could have pinched him, but, being naturally very kind-hearted
  with all criminals if I haven't enough evidence to get a conviction, I just
  warned him. Nippy was very hurt.</p>

  <p>" 'Why, Sooper,' he said. 'I've got a good job. I'm warm and dry up in
  Wardour Street. Why should I lower myself to go back to my old and sinful
  life? I haven't had a drink for three months, and I never pass the Old Bailey
  without taking, off me hat to it.'</p>

  <p>" 'There are two ways of being warm and dry, Nippy,' I said. 'One is to be
  honest, and the other is to get to Dartmoor, where I understand there is a
  fine system of central heating.'</p>

  <p>"While this was going on, Juggy Jones came out of stir and reported to me.
  He'd got out with his usual remissions and I had a little chat with him.</p>

  <p>" 'It's all right, Sooper,' he said. 'I'm going straight. I've had enough
  of the other game. How's Nippy&mdash;warm and dry?'</p>

  <p>" 'Do you know him?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"He thought a long time. 'I've heard about him,' he said.</p>

  <p>"I should imagine he'd been doing a lot of thinking while he was in
  prison, and when I heard that he and Nippy had been seen together having a
  drink in the long bar, I thought it advisable to see Nippy and give him a few
  words of fatherly advice. But you couldn't tell anything to Nippy. He knew it
  all, and a lot more. He just smiled. 'Thank you, Sooper,' he said, 'but Juggy
  and I have always been good pals, and you couldn't wish to meet a nicer
  man.'</p>

  <p>"According to his story, they had met by accident in the Haymarket. They
  had had a drink together. I think Nippy was a bit jealous of him, because he
  was one of the few crooks I have met who saved money. He had enough money,
  anyway, when he was at the Old Bailey to engage a good mouthpiece, and he'd
  got a little flat in Maida Vale. One of my men shadowed Nippy and found he
  was in the habit of calling there, so I knew if Nippy disappeared and his
  right ear was found on the Thames Embankment, where the rest of the body
  would be. Not that crooks are that kind: they never commit murder.</p>

  <p>"I only heard the rest of the story in scraps and pieces. But so far as I
  can make out, Nippy had been trying to get the man into the luggage crowd,
  which was silly, because. as I have said before, a man who knocks oft
  motor-cars doesn't knock off anything else. Jaggy said he would like to try
  the business, and he must have looked it over pretty, thoroughly and taken an
  interest in it, because one day he sent for Nippy to come to his flat in
  Maida Vale, and put him on an easy job that came off and brought him about
  £150. It's a simple trick. You have a motor-car outside the station, and in
  it a little hand stamp and a case of type. You hang about the cloak room till
  you see a man coming along carrying a bag in and taking his ticket. You've
  got a little bag of your own, containing a few well-worn bricks wrapped up in
  your favourite newspaper. You edge up behind him, and when he takes a ticket
  you put in your bag and you receive a ticket. Now, suppose you receive No.
  431; you know the ticket that went before was 430. You go outside to your
  little car. You have got a lot of blank tickets of all colours&mdash;they
  sometimes change the colour&mdash;and you just make up the stamp to 430 and
you
  stamp it. About three or four hours later along comes a gentlemanly looking
  person, hands in the ticket and claims the bag, and that's the end of it.</p>

  <p>"One night, just as Nippy was going to bed, Juggy rang him up and asked
  him to come round to see him. When he got to the flat he told Nippy a grand
  story. It was about a man who travelled in jewellery and who was in the habit
  of taking one over the eight, and sometimes two. This fellow, according to
  Juggy, when he felt the inebriation, if you'll excuse the word, overtaking
  him, used to go to the nearest cloak room and deposit all his samples in a
  bag which was kept in a safe that you could open with a blunt knife.</p>

  <p>"According to Juggy, this fellow was coming to London from Birmingham, and
  the two arranged to shadow him. They picked him up at a railway
station&mdash;a
  large, fat man, who was slightly oiled. You may not have heard the expression
  before, but it means a man who has been lubricating&mdash;which is also a
  foreign expression, but you must go with the times. They tailed him till he
  went into a restaurant and met another man. He carried a bag, and he took out
  of this bag, and showed to the world, a large leather roll which he opened on
  the table. There were more diamonds in that roll than Nippy had ever heard
  of. When he saw it he began to breathe heavily through his nose.</p>

  <p>"When they got outside the restaurant he said to Juggy: 'Can't we get him
  in a quiet place and convert him to free trade? It's warm and dry.'</p>

  <p>"But Juggy wouldn't have it. He said that this man, because he was in the
  habit of getting soused&mdash;which is another expression you may not have
  heard before, but it means the same thing&mdash;was always followed by a
  detective to watch him. Apparently, he wasn't an ordinary traveller; he was
  the head of the firm. They followed him for a bit. He went into a bar and
  when he came out he couldn't have driven a car without having his licence
  suspended for ten years. Sure enough he made for a railway station in the
  Euston Road, handed over the stock, and they watched it being locked in the
  safe.</p>

  <p>" 'He'll do that every day this week,' said Juggy, 'but no time's like the
  present. You're a peter-man, I'm not.'</p>

  <p>"And then he told Nippy his plan. It was to put him in a packing case and
  deposit him in the cloak room. 'It's Saturday night. They close the office at
  twelve, and all you've got to do is to get out in the night, open the safe,
  claim the stuff, and I'll be down to collect you in the morning.'</p>

  <p>"Nippy wasn't what I might describe as keen on the job, but he'd seen the
  diamonds and he couldn't keep his mind off them. Juggy took him down to a
  little garage off the Waterloo Bridge Road and showed him the case he'd had
  made.</p>

  <p>" 'If you don't like to do it, I can get one of my lads who'll do the job
  for a pony and be glad of the chance. It's going to be easy to get, and we'll
  share fifty-fifty.'</p>

  <p>"Nippy was still a bit uncertain. 'Suppose they put me upside down?'</p>

  <p>" 'Don't be silly,' said Juggy. I'll put a label on it: <i>This side
  up&mdash;glass</i>.'</p>

  <p>"Nippy had a look at the case. It was all lined; there was a nice seat,
  and although it was going to be a little uncomfortable, there was a neat
  little pocket inside, with a flask of whisky and a little tin of
  sandwiches.</p>

  <p>" 'You won't be able to smoke, of course, but you won't be there more than
  seven hours. I'll notify the left-luggage people that I'm bringing the case
  in, and slip the fellow a dollar and tell him not to put anything on top. All
  you've got to do is open the side of the case and step out. It'll be like
  falling off a log.'</p>

  <p>"Nippy had a good look at the case. The side opened like a door. It didn't
  look hard at all. The only danger was that when they came in the morning to
  the cloakroom they'd find out that the safe had been opened.</p>

  <p>" 'That's all right.' said Juggy. 'You needn't bust it. I've got a squeeze
  of the key.' He took it out of his pocket.</p>

  <p>" 'That's all right.' said Nippy. 'It's an easy job. We'll be warm and dry
  on this.'</p>

  <p>"About seven o'clock that night Nippy got inside the case and tried it
  out. The air holes all worked; everything was as the heart could desire. He
  bolted the door on the inside, and then he heard somebody putting in screws
  on the outside.</p>

  <p>" 'Hi!' said Nippy, 'what's the idea?'</p>

  <p>" 'It's all right.' said Juggy. 'They're only fakes; they come out the
  moment you push'</p>

  <p>"I don't know what happened to Nippy in the night, and I can't describe
  his feelings, because I'm not a novel writer. He heard cranes going and
  people shouting, felt himself lifted up in the air, heard somebody say 'Lower
  away!' and he went down farther than he thought it was possible to go. And
  then Nippy began to realize that something had to be done.</p>

  <p>"It was two hours before anybody heard him shout, and at last the
  stevedores broke open the case and got him out. He was in the hold of a ship,
  and the packing case was labelled on the top: 'Bombay. Stow away from
  boilers. Keep warm and dry.'</p>

     name="story3"></a>THE SOOPER SPEAKING</h2>

  <p class="note">A different story with the same title was published in
  <i>Collier's</i> magazine, April 28, 1928 and reprinted in the collection
  <i>The Lone House Mystery and Other Stories</i>, William Collins &amp; Sons,
  London, 1929</p><br>

  <p class="first">"ITS a queer thing," said the Superintendent, "that when I
  explain to outsiders the method and system of criminal investigation as
  practised by the well-known academy of arts at Scotland Yard, they always
  seem a bit disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I've shown a lot of people over the building, and they all want to see
  the room where the scientific detectives are looking at mud stains through
  microscopes, or puttin' cigar ash in test tubes, or deducting or
  deducing&mdash;I don't know which is the right word&mdash;from a bit of glue
that
  was found in the keyhole that the burglar was a tall, dark man who drove a
  grey touring car and had been crossed in love.</p>

  <p>"I believe there am detectives like that. I've read about 'em. When you
  walk into their room or bureau or boudoir, as the case may be, they give you
  a sharp, penetrating look from their cold, grey eyes and they say: 'You came
  up Oxford Street in a motor-bus; I can smell it. You had an argument with
  your wife this morning; I can see the place where the plate hit you. You're
  going a long journey across water; beware of a blue-eyed nippy&mdash;she
  bites."</p>

  <p>"I believe that the best way to detect a man who's committed a crime is to
  see him do it. It isn't necessary even to see him do it. In nine cases out of
  ten the right man will come along sooner or later and tell you be did it, and
  what he did it with. Most criminals catch themselves. And I'll tell you why.
  Not nine out of ten, but ninety-nine out of every hundred of these birds of
  paradise don't know where to stop, and as they don't know where to stop they
  stop half-way. I've never met a crook who was a whole hogger and could carry
  any job he started to a clean an' tidy finish. There never was a burglar who
  didn't leave something valuable behind, but that's understandable, for
  burglars are the most nervous criminals in the world. They lose heart
  half-way through and there's a lot of people like 'em. As Mr. Rudyard
  Kipling. the well-known poet. says:</p>

  <p class="verse">'All along of doing things<br>
  Rather more or less.'</p>

  <p>"The most interesting more or less crime I ever saw was the Bidderley Hall
  affair. Bidderley Hall is a country house in the Metropolitan Police
  area&mdash;right on the edge of "T" Division near Staines. It was an old Queen
  Anne house&mdash;it's been pulled down lately&mdash;standing in a ten acre
park,
  and it was owned by a gentleman named Costino. Mr. Charles Costino. He was a
  rich man, having inherited about half a million from his brother Peter. Funny
  name Costino, but that's what it was. I don't make the names, I simply put
  'em on record. Their great great grandfather had been a Roumanian, or
  something of the sort, but they'd grown out of it.</p>

  <p>"Peter was rich and Charles was poor. Peter boozed but Charles never got
  gay on anything stronger than barley water. He was artistic and knew a lot
  about old masters. He never bought any but he knew about 'em. His brother
  Peter knew nothing except that two pints made a quart and two quarts made you
  so that you wasn't responsible for your actions.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, he was a bit of a bad egg&mdash;gave funny parties at
  his home in Eastbourne and was pinched once or twice for bein' tight when in
  charge of a motor-car.</p>

  <p>"One morning the coastguards found Peter's car at the foot of a two
  hundred foot cliff, smashed to blazes. They never found Peter. The tide was
  pretty high when his car went over&mdash;about three in the morning according
  to a revenue boat that saw the lights, and after a time Charles got leave to
  presume his death and took over all that Peter had left of a million.</p>

  <p>"I saw Peter once. He was one of those blue-faced soakers who keep
  insurance companies awake at night.</p>

  <p>"It was a grand bit of luck for Charles, who had this old house on his
  hands and found it a bit difficult to pay the rates.</p>

  <p>"When he came into money he didn't live much better than when he was poor.
  The only time he broke out was when he took in a man of all work, who was
  butler, footman, valet and fed the chickens. In a way it was not a good
  break. as I could have told him if I had only known at the time. Mr. Costino,
  it seems, had had an old lady looking after him&mdash;I forget her name, but
  anyway it doesn't matter. She'd been in the family for four generations, and
  she either left to better herself or died. Whatever she did she bettered
  herself. Anyway, Mr. Charles Costino was without a servant. He only lived in
  four rooms of the house since he came into the money and there wasn't much
  cleaning to be done, but he did have a bit of silver to clean, and there were
  the chickens to look after. The silver used to be locked in a cupboard in the
  dining-room and was pretty valuable as I happen to know.</p>

  <p>"Now, the new man he employed was named Simon. He's no relation to anybody
  you know, and I very much whether that was his name anyway. He was a graduate
  of the University of Dartmoor where he had spent three happy years at the
  ratepayers' expense. I knew him as well as the back of my right hand.</p>

  <p>"One day by accident I was passing through the Minories and I saw Simon
  come out of a shop that buys a bit of other people's silver now and again, so
  I pulled him up. According to his story he had been to this pawn-broker's
  shop to buy a ring for his young lady, but they hadn't got one to fit. I know
  most of the young ladies Simon has promised to marry&mdash;they've all been
  through my hands at one time or another&mdash;but I've never met one that he
  bought anything for, except a bit of stickin' plaster. So I took him back to
  the shop, and the fence blew it and showed me the silver Mr. Simon parted
  with.</p>

  <p>"It was not in my division at all and perhaps I had no right to interfere.
  To tell you the truth, the Divisional Inspector was a bit nasty about it
  afterwards, but what made it all right for me was when Simon said it was a
  cop and volunteered to come back with me to Staines. He didn't want any
  trouble and he told me he was tired of working for Mr. Costino and would be
  glad to get back amongst the boys at the dear old college. He said he had
  sold six pieces and got four hidden in the house ready to bring away.</p>

  <p>" 'Costino wouldn't notice them going.' he said. 'He's soused half the
  time and the other half he's in delirium tremens.'</p>

  <p>"It was news to me. because I didn't know Costino drank.</p>

  <p>"We drove from the station to the house in a cab and on the way there
  Simon told me how slick he'd had to be to get the stuff out of the house at
  all. Apparently he slept in a room over a stable, some distance front the
  house but in the grounds. Nobody slept in the house but Charles Costino.</p>

  <p>"We drove up to the Hall&mdash;and a miserable looking building it was. I
  think I told you it was a Queen Anne house. Queen Anne is dead and this house
  was ready to pop off at any minute. None of the windows was clean, except a
  couple on the ground floor. It took us a quarter of an hour to wake up
  Costino and even then he only opened the door on the chain and wouldn't have
  let us in but he recognised me.</p>

  <p>"I have never seen such a change in a man. The last time I saw him he was
  a quiet, sober feller and his idea of a happy evening was to drink lemonade
  and listen to the wireless. Now he was the colour of a bad lobster. He stared
  at Simon, and when I told him what the man had told me, he sat down in a
  chair and turned grey&mdash;well it wasn't grey, but a sort of putty colour.
  After a bit he says:</p>

  <p>" 'I'd like to speak to this man. I think I can persuade him to tell me
  the truth.'</p>

  <p>"I don't like people comin' between me and my lawful prey, but I humoured
  him, and he took Simon into the other corner of the room and talked to him
  for a long time in an undertone.</p>

  <p>"When he finished he said:</p>

  <p>" 'I think this man has made a mistake. There are only four pieces of
  silver stolen, and those are the four pieces he has sold. I can tell you in a
  minute.'</p>

  <p>"With that he unlocked the door of a high cupboard. It was so crowded with
  silver that it was impossible for any man to count the stuff that was in it.
  But he only looked at it for a minute and then he said:</p>

  <p>" 'He's quite right. Only four pieces are missing.'</p>

  <p>"So far as I was concerned it didn't matter to me whether it was four or
  ten, so long as he gave me enough for a conviction. It was not my business to
  argue the point. I took Simon down to the cooler and I could tell something
  had happened, because he was not his usual bright and cheery self. Usually
  when you take an old con to the station he is either tellin' you that when he
  comes out what he's goin' to do to your heart, lungs and important blood
  vessels, or else he's all friendly and jolly boys. But Simon said nothing and
  sort of looked dazed and surprised. He was hardly recovered the next morning
  when I met him at the police court and got my remand.</p>

  <p>"It was a very simple case. It came up at the Sessions, and Mr. Costino
  went into the box and said Simon was one of the best servants that had ever
  blown into a country house. You expect perjury at the Assizes but not that
  kind of perjury. But that was his business. Anyway, Costino made such a scene
  about what a grand feller Simon was, how he fed the chickens so regular that
  they followed him down the street, that he got off with six months hard
  labour, and that, so far as I was concerned, was the end of it till it came
  my turn to take him again.</p>

  <p>"About seven months after this I was on duty on the Great West Road,
  watching for a stolen motor-car. It was one of those typical English summer
  days you read about&mdash;raining cats and dogs, with a cold north wind
  blowing&mdash;and I was getting a bit fed up with waitin' when I saw a car
  coming along following a course that a yachtsman takes when he is tacking
  into the breeze. The last tack was against an iron lamp standard, which
  smashed the radiator and most of the glass, but it didn't apparently kill the
  driver, for he opened the door and staggered out. I had only to look at him
  to see that he had had about twenty-five over the eight. My first inclination
  was to hand him over to my sergeant on a charge of being drunk in charge. It
  would mean a lot of bother, because if he had plenty of money he'd produce
  three Harley Street doctors and fourteen independent witnesses to prove that
  the only thing he'd drunk since yesterday morning was a small glass of cider
  diluted with tonic water.</p>

  <p>"I was deciding whether it would be better to pinch him or push him under
  a motor-bus when I recognised him. It was Simon.</p>

  <p>" 'Hello,' I said. 'How long is it since you came out of the home for
  dirty dogs?'</p>

  <p>"He didn't know me at first, and I oughtn't to have known him at all,
  because he was beautifully dressed, with a green tie and a brown hat, and a
  bunch of forget-me-nots in his buttonhole, not that anybody who had ever put
  their lamps on his dial would ever forget him. When he didn't answer I asked
  him if it was his car, and he admitted it.</p>

  <p>''While I was talking to him one of my men came up and told me that they
  had stopped the stolen car about a hundred yards down the road, so I was able
  to devote myself to my little friend.</p>

  <p>"We helped him along and got him into the sub-station round the corner. He
  was, so to speak, flush with wine. He got over his shock and he began to talk
  big, flash his money about, and gradually, as he recognised the old familiar
  surroundings&mdash;the sergeant's desk and the notice on the wall telling
  people not to spit on the floor&mdash;he saw he was in the presence of law and
  order and it gradually dawned on him that I was me.</p>

  <p>" 'What bank have you been robbing?' says I.</p>

  <p>"He laughed in my face.</p>

  <p>" 'Costino gave that to me for saying that I only pinched four bits of
  silver.'</p>

  <p>"He started to laugh again and stopped. I have an idea that in the thing
  he called his mind he realised that he had said too much. Anyway, he wouldn't
  say any more. We took his money away from him, counted it and put him in a
  nice, clean cell.</p>

  <p>"Now I am not a man who is easily puzzled. Things in life are too
  straightforward for anybody to have anything to puzzle about, but this
  certainly got me thinking. Costino must have given him the best part of a
  thousand pounds to admit that he had stolen only four pieces of silver. Why
  did he do that?</p>

  <p>"I thought it out. At about eleven o'clock that night I said to my
  sergeant:</p>

  <p>" 'Let's go and do a real bit of detective work'</p>

  <p>"I drove him down in my car to the road in front of Bidderley Hall. We
  parked the car in the drive, just inside the old gates, and we walked up to
  the house. The rain was pelting down. I don't remember a worse night. The
  wind howled through the trees and gave me one of those bogey feelings I
  haven't had since I was a boy.</p>

  <p>"When we got up to the house, we made a sort of reconnaissance. All the
  windows were dark; there was no sign of life; if there had been any sound we
  couldn't have heard it. We went all round, trying to find a way in, and just
  as we got back to the front of the house one of the worst thunderstorms I can
  remember started up without any warning. My sergeant was all for knocking up
  Mr. Costino and puttin' the matter, to him plump and plain, but I saw all
  sorts of difficulties and my scheme was to pretend that We found a window
  open and being good policemen and not being able to make Costino hear we had
  got in through the window and had a look round. There was only one place
  possible, we decided, after we tried every window on the ground floor, and
  that was a window on a small balcony at the back of the house.</p>

  <p>"We searched round and found a ladder, and put it against the balcony. I
  went up first and I just put my leg over the parapet and was facing the
  window when there came a blinding flash of lightning that made my head spin.
  It was one of those flashes of lightning that seem to last two or three
  seconds, and in the light of it, as plain as day, I saw right in front of me,
  staring through the window, a horribly white face with a long untidy beard. I
  was so startled I nearly dropped back. I called my sergeant up the ladder. I
  wasn't afraid, but I wanted somebody with me. I don't know whether you have
  ever had that feeling. Two can be frightened to death better than one.</p>

  <p>"I told him just what I had seen, and then I got my pocket lamp and
  flashed it into the room. As far as I could see through the dirty window the
  room was empty. Between the window and the room was a set of iron bars. They
  weren't very thick; they looked the kind that were put up in West End houses
  so that children can't escape from nurseries when they catch fire. We got the
  window open. The sergeant and I not only bent the bar, but we bent the whole
  frame It was not very securely fastened; a bit of carpentry work done by
  somebody who understood plumbing.</p>

  <p>"There was no furniture in the room. It was thick with dust. On the wall
  was a picture hanging cockeyed. The door was open and we went on and found a
  landing and a narrow flight of stairs leading down. But the curious thing
  about those stairs was that they didn't stop on the ground floor. In fact,
  there was no door opening until we got to the basement. There had been a
  door, but it had been bricked up.</p>

  <p>"We were going down the last flight of steps when we heard a door bang and
  the sound of a bolt being shot. When we got to the basement level we found a
  door. It was shut, and we couldn't move it. I could find nothing on the
  stairs in the light of my lamp except that somebody was in the habit of going
  up and down.</p>

  <p>"When I went up to the room with the balcony and examined the bars we had
  bent, I made rather an interesting discovery. Three of the screws on the
  lower left-hand corner had been taken out, and they had been taken out with a
  jagged top of a sardine tin. We found the 'opener' lying on the floor. It
  must have taken a long time to loosen those screws, for one of the
  screw-holes was quite dark, and must have been out for months.</p>

  <p>"There were two courses left to us; one was to come the next day with a
  search warrant, which no magistrate would grant on the information we had,
  and the other was to go round and wake up Costino and ask him to let us go
  through the house. There was a good reason for not doing that.</p>

  <p>"I took off my boots and went down the stairs in my stockinged feet, with
  my sergeant behind me. We crept up to the door and listened. For a little
  time I heard nothing partly because the thunder was still turning the house
  into a drum, and partly because we could not quite tune in. But after a while
  I heard a man breathing very quickly, like somebody who had been running. We
  waited for a quarter of an hour and then another quarter of an hour. It
  seemed like a week. And then we heard the bolt being very gently pushed back.
  A man on the other side of the door opened it an inch. In another second I
  was through. He ran like the wind along the cellar and was just reaching
  another door when I grabbed him. He fought like six men, but we got him down.
  And then he said:</p>

  <p>" 'Don't kill me, Charles. I'll give you half the money.'</p>

  <p>"And that was all I wanted to know here.</p>

  <p>"We pulled him up and sat him on an old box, and I explained that we were
  just innocent police officers, that we very seldom kill anybody except under
  the greatest provocation, and after a while we got Mr. Peter Costino calm,
  and he told us how his brother had come down to Eastbourne to see him and
  borrow some money, and how he got him drunk and intended driving him and the
  car over the cliff. Peter wouldn't have known this but his brother told him
  afterwards. Charles lost heart and let the car go by itself, and brought
  Peter back to Bidderley Hall, and shut him up in the cellar. Peter didn't
  know very much about it till he woke up the next morning and found himself a
  prisoner, and after about two years of this kind of life he got more or less
  reconciled, especially as he was allowed to go up to the room with the
  balcony. It was the only bit of the world he was allowed to see, and then
  only at nights.</p>

  <p>"That's the trouble with criminals: they never go along the whole hog.
  Charles didn't have the nerve to kill his brother. He just locked him up. He
  got the house and half a million pounds, but he got about two million
  worries. That two years made Peter a sober man and turned Charles into a
  drunkard. Peter might have died in this cellar if Mr. Charles Costino hadn't
  given Simon the hook a thousand quid to keep his mouth shut about the
  property he had stolen and hidden in the house. Charles was in mortal terror
  that we would search the house for the missing silver, and if we had searched
  the house we'd have found Peter.</p>

  <p>"Charles is in Dartmoor now. So is Simon. He got a lagging for a big smash
  and grab raid, and got five. From what I've heard he and Charles are quite
  good friends. The last I heard of Charles he was painting angels in the
  prison chapel. As I say, he was always a bit artistic."</p>
