  <p class="blurb">When the most powerful artillery, deadly bacteria and
  explosives known, and the most destructive methods available fail to be
  effective against some enemy's unknown weapon of war, it is time, very
  frequently, to turn to some simple means of combat and attack. Paradoxically,
  though, it is the simple thing that is so difficult to hit upon. In fact,
  like some of the greatest discoveries and inventions, the most destructive
  chemical solutions are often discovered by sheer accident. For instance, who
  could ever have thought purposefully of the chemical that was finally adopted
  by the hero of this story?&mdash;Ed.</p>

  <h2><a id="fore"
     name="fore">FOREWORD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MUCH has been written about the terrific cataclysm of
  1960&mdash;the eruption of the volcano, Coseguina, with its accompaniment of
  earthquakes, fires, floods and storms, which carried death and destruction
  into Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.</p>

  <p>The world has been told by a thousand writers, with a thousand different
  viewpoints, of the awful blackness, so much more intense and so far greater
  in extent than "La Oscuridad Grande"&mdash;"The Great Darkness" of
  1835&mdash;as to relegate the former event, awe-inspiring as it was, to
  insignificance.</p>

  <p>Eyewitnesses who were fortunate enough to escape with their lives from the
  devastated cities, have described their varying sensations when, with noon
  and midnight alike, tiles slid from the roofs, walls crumbled, buildings
  crashed to the shaking earth like houses of cards, bells tolled futilely in
  cracked towers, and the air was filled with shrieks, prayers and choking
  dust.</p>

  <p>But, immense and devastating as it was, it is not of this cataclysm that I
  would write, but of that infinitely more terrible menace to all mankind which
  closely followed it&mdash;which was, in fact, loosed on the inhabitants of
  the earth's crust as a direct result of the eruption. For I was an eyewitness
  of the first appearance of the Metal Menace, as well as a direct participant
  in the action that followed, as men struggled to shake off the fetters with
  which the slimy intelligences of the nether world were slowly and surely
  shackling and enslaving them.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to attempt to write in an orderly fashion of those nerve-
  racking, reason-destroying events when they are yet so close to me, but life
  is fleeting, death may come to me at any moment, and there are many facts
  which are known to me alone, and which should be preserved for posterity. For
  this reason, I begin my task as chronicler now, instead of waiting for time
  to bring order and clarity to the vision. -Walter Stuart.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; THE METAL BEINGS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"HOOVER," I shouted through the control room phone, and my
  pilot, Art Reeves, skillfully banked, returning the Blettendorf electroplane
  almost to the exact spot and holding it there suspended with helicopters
  whirring.</p>

  <p>We were directly above the crater of Coseguina. But six months had passed
  since its eruption, the most spectacular and destructive in the history of
  the world, yet it had not only ceased to smoke, but the hot lava, which had
  bubbled and seethed for some months in this immense cauldron of Mother
  Nature, had suddenly receded, and there remained a yawning black shaft, the
  bottom of which was sunk so far into the bowels of the earth as to be
  invisible.</p>

  <p>It was to investigate this singular and previously unheard of phenomenon
  that my chief, the secretary of the American Geographic Association, had sent
  me from Chicago in the Blettendorf, together with Pat Higgins, my
  photographer and assistant, and Pilot Reeves.</p>

  <p>"Descend," I said, and we began swiftly and smoothly to drop toward the
  yawning blackness beneath us.</p>

  <p>Pat flashed on his keel and side lights and started his automatic cameras
  clicking. Four of them, like the lights, were trained on the crater walls,
  and the fifth was pointed straight down through the floor.</p>

  <p>The top of the crater was fully a mile in diameter, but as we descended,
  the walls gradually drew closer together. Presently, when our magnetic
  altimeter showed that we were nearly five thousand feet below sea level, the
  shaft assumed a uniform diameter of about two hundred feet.</p>

  <p>"Faith," said Pat with a grin, "this must be where the bottom dropped out
  of the kettle. If this keeps up, we'll be having tea with the devil in a
  couple of hours." I mopped the perspiration from my brow. The air in the
  cabin had grown uncomfortably warm. A glance at the thermometer showed a
  temperature of 120 degrees.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we won't be able to get much closer to His Plutonic Majesty
  without asbestos suits," I replied. "Besides, the heat will thin our oil
  until its lubricating value will be nil. If we burn out a couple of
  helicopter bearings, we're due for a long, hard drop.</p>

  <p>"Sure, we'd be old and gray by the time we hit the bottom," said Pat.</p>

  <p>Watching the thermometer and magnetic altimeter, I saw that the heat was
  increasing at the rate of about one degree to every hundred feet of descent.
  When it reached 135 degrees I ordered Reeves to hover.</p>

  <p>"We've come as far as we dare in this machine," I told Pat. "I'll take a
  look through the binoculars before we ascend."</p>

  <p>I pointed my 50X Zeiss glasses downward in an effort to see the bottom of
  the shaft. But adjust them as I would, I could see only a tiny black speck
  where the seemingly converging walls&mdash;due to perspective&mdash;of the
  pit ended. I did notice something else, however, which caused me to utter an
  involuntary exclamation of surprise. The walls of the pit beneath us were of
  gleaming, silvery looking metal, and winding up around them was a railed
  metal stairway. On this stairway there was a movement&mdash;a constant flow
  of shiny metal globes rolling upward.</p>

  <p>Rapidly shifting the focus for a nearer view I looked for the top of the
  metal wall. I found it in a moment, and the powerful glasses brought every
  detail so close that it seemed as if I could almost reach out and touch the
  gleaming railing of the spiral stairway. Never, so long as I live, will I
  forget the strange, almost unbelievable sight that greeted my eyes.</p>

  <p>Standing along the railing near the end of the stairway, were four
  grotesque creatures, somewhat man-like in form. Their bodies were glistening
  metal globes, like Osage oranges, from which, in lieu of arms and legs, there
  projected four tentacles, apparently constructed of many little globes strung
  together like beads. Perched on similar but shorter tentacles above the body
  spheres were smaller globes, evidently the heads of the creatures. They had
  enormous goggling eyes, literally like headlights, both in shape, and from
  the fact that they cast their own rays before them.</p>

  <p>The first three of these strange beings carried long pipes slightly curved
  at the upper ends. The lower ends were attached to flexible tubes greatly
  resembling conduit, which trailed down the stairway. The fourth held a
  straight cylinder about three inches in diameter and four feet in length.</p>

  <p>The first three individuals were exceedingly busy. In fact they seemed to
  be the sole structural workers on the stupendous metal shaft that was swiftly
  rising from the bowels of the earth. The metal globes which were rolling up
  the stairway were of three sizes, and appeared to be living creatures, for
  when they reached the ends of their respective lines, all sprouted the queer
  tentacle-like arms and legs of the four larger creatures, and projected
  globular heads from their round interiors. Then those of the largest size
  sprang up, one by one, to the top of the unfinished wall, where they
  retracted their heads and limbs and rolled closely together.</p>

  <p>AS soon as each new globe was in position, the foremost of the three large
  workers cemented it in place with a stream of gleaming liquid resembling
  quicksilver, that poured from the tube he carried, and filled in the
  interstices until a glistening, pebble-grained wall resulted.</p>

  <p>The rolling globes of the middle size leaped from the end of their line to
  make the stairway in the same manner, cemented in place by the second tube-
  bearer, while those of the smallest size formed the railing and its
  supporting bars, and were fused into place by the third large worker.</p>

  <p>I was dumbfounded. The idea of a race of metal beings building a structure
  with their own bodies, cheerfully and willingly, was almost unthinkable for
  me. It was something quite beyond my point of view. But then, a coral polyp's
  viewpoint as it fuses its body in with millions of others to form an atoll of
  a reef is also far from the understanding of individualistic men.</p>

  <p>"Haven't seen a banshee, have you, chief?" asked Pat. who had noticed my
  startled expression.</p>

  <p>"Take a look for yourself," I responded. "I want to know if you can see
  what I see."</p>

  <p>Focusing his own binoculars he looked, then exclaimed: "Holy smokes! And I
  thought all the fairies were in Ireland! It's the Little People, sure as my
  name's Pat Higgins!"</p>

  <p>I was looking at the fourth of the larger individuals, the one that
  carried the tube, wondering what his function was. Suddenly, as if attracted
  by the intensity of my gaze, he flashed his great goggle eyes upward. For an
  instant he gazed at the electroplane. Then he pointed his cylinder upward,
  and there was a crash of broken glass as a projectile struck the floor
  window.</p>

  <p>As we were without weapons, I shouted an order to Reeves:</p>

  <p>"Ascend! Full speed!"</p>

  <p>"Sure, that one must have been a guard," said Pat, shutting off his
  clicking cameras. "Wonder what that was he fired at us."</p>

  <p>The floor lurched as our craft shot swiftly upward. Something rolled
  against my foot. It was a shiny metal globe about two inches in
  diameter&mdash;evidently the missile which had been fired from the
  cylinder.</p>

  <p>"Here it is, Pat," I said, and picked it up.</p>

  <p>But scarcely had I done so, when it shot out segmented, tentacle-like arms
  and legs, and- a head that was a tiny, goggle-eyed miniature of the creature
  which had fired it. One of the metal tentacles whipped down on the back of my
  hand with a stinging blow, so startling me that I dropped the thing. It
  instantly scurried for the broken floor window, but Pat with a "No you
  don't!" scooped it up in his empty binocular case and fastened down the
  lid.</p>

  <p>"My grandfather once caught a fairy," said Pat, "and devil a bit of good
  luck did he have after that. It brought him to an early grave in his
  ninety-seventh year."</p>

  <p>We emerged into the light of day, and Pat shut off his lights.</p>

  <p>"Back to Leon," I ordered, and Reeves started the three propellers roaring
  as he pointed the nose of our craft up over the crater rim.</p>

  <p>For our powerful electroplane, capable of a speed of five hundred miles an
  hour, the sixty-mile trip back to Leon would only have been a matter of a few
  minutes. But we were not destined to complete it, for scarcely had we passed
  over the ruins of Viejo, a little more than half the distance, ere Pat, who
  had been looking backward toward Coseguina, called my attention to the fact
  that an immense metal globe had shot up out of the crater and was following
  us through the air at a pace so much swifter than our own that we seemed, by
  comparison, to be standing still.</p>

  <p>I focused my glasses on the big globe as it hurtled swiftly toward us. It
  was about a hundred and fifty feet in diameter, and constructed of the same
  gleaming metal that we had noted in the shaft. A minute, and it loomed,
  immense and menacing, almost upon us.</p>

  <p>"Drop," I ordered Reeves.</p>

  <p>He shut off the forward propellers, set the wings at perpendicular, and
  reversed the helicopters. We dropped, just in time, the immense globe
  hurtling over us with terrific speed. Its momentum must have carried it at
  least five miles ahead of us before it could turn to come back. In the
  meantime, we had descended to within a thousand feet of the earth.</p>

  <p>"Hover," I shouted to Reeves, but scarcely had he checked our downward
  progress, less than five hundred feet from the ground, when the globe
  returned, plunging straight at us.</p>

  <p>Reeves managed to swerve slightly to one side before it struck, but our
  left wing was torn off, and we spun crazily beneath the supporting
  helicopters. Then a blade broke, and we went into a swift nose dive.</p>

  <p>I caught a fleeting glimpse of the ash-covered ruins of a great hacienda
  rushing up to meet us. Then there was a terrific crash&mdash;and
  darkness.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; CAPTURED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AN immense cloud of volcanic dust arose as we crashed
  through the tile-less frame of the hacienda roof. Our second helicopter had
  retarded our fall sufficiently to prevent fatalities, but we were badly
  shaken up.</p>

  <p>The dust was so thick that I could scarcely see my hand before my eyes.
  The helicopter had ceased to whirl as we struck. The motor was dead.</p>

  <p>"All right, Pat?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Safe and sound, chief," he replied.</p>

  <p>"And you, Reeves?"</p>

  <p>"Not hurt a bit."</p>

  <p>"Good. We'd better get out of here at once and try to find a place to
  hide. That globe will be right back after us, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>Scarcely had I spoken, ere something ground against the roof, and there
  was a metallic clank as if a chain had been tossed to the floor.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," I called, softly, and leaping out of the side door, groped my
  way through the dust cloud which was beginning to settle a little. The floor
  was covered to depth of more than a foot with fluffy volcanic ash, making the
  going difficult.</p>

  <p>Presently my outstretched hands encountered a wall, and I followed this to
  a doorway. Stumbling through, I entered a large room that was in
  semi-darkness. I felt a hand on my arm. Then Pat whispered:</p>

  <p>"They're after us! Hear 'em clanking around in the next room?"</p>

  <p>"Where's Reeves?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't know. Must have found a place to hide."</p>

  <p>We came to another doorway. The door was half ajar, and we squeezed
  through. We found ourselves in a small clothes closet.</p>

  <p>I peered through the interstice between door and frame. The dust was
  settling rapidly, and the room into which we had crashed was partly visible
  through the first doorway we had entered. A number of metal creatures like
  those we had seen in the shaft were swarming over the wreck. Their globular
  bodies gleamed in the sunlight which filtered through the dust into the hole
  we had smashed in the roof. And hanging down through that hole was a thick
  metal cable or tentacle composed of globular segments which tapered slightly
  toward the tip.</p>

  <p>The creatures investigating the wreck of the electroplane were about four
  feet in height&mdash;the same stature as the structural workers we had
  observed in the shaft. Suddenly I heard the voice of Reeves:</p>

  <p>"Let go of me, damn you!"</p>

  <p>In a cloud of swirling dust he was dragged by two of the creatures, each
  of which had hold of an arm, out into the sunlight. His head and clothing
  were thickly covered with volcanic ash. Evidently he had missed the doorway,
  had dug in, and had just been discovered.</p>

  <p>Twisting, kicking and cursing, he was dragged up toward the huge tentacle.
  It whipped around his waist, then jerked him aloft, out of our sight. In a
  moment it dropped once more. With remarkable agility, the metal beings
  swarmed up. Then it was withdrawn, there was a clank like that of huge metal
  door being closed, and the roof creaked as if a great weight had been lifted
  from it.</p>

  <p>"They've gone," said Pat, "and they've got Reeves!"</p>

  <p>"Poor devil! And we couldn't do a thing! Come on." I led the way to the
  room into which the ship had crashed. Quickly mounting to its top, I climbed
  up on the unbroken helicopter blade and leaped to the roof. The huge metal
  sphere had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Pat came up beside me.</p>

  <p>"It's a long walk to Leon," he said, "and my wrist radiophone is smashed.
  How's yours?"</p>

  <p>I tested it. It was tuned for just such an emergency, with that of my
  secretary, Miss Davis, who was back in the Hotel Soledade at Leon.</p>

  <p>It worked. Her answer came back, clear and distinct.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Stuart."</p>

  <p>"Higgins and I cracked up on the roof of a large hacienda, about ten miles
  northwest of Leon. Send a helicopter taxi for us at once.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr, Stuart. Right away."</p>

  <p>I broke the connection, then turned to Pat.</p>

  <p>"Think we can save any of those pictures?" I asked. "Why not, chief? The
  fuselage wasn't wrecked. I'll go down and get them."</p>

  <p>The helicopter taxi arrived just as Pat came up with the cameras. We got
  aboard.</p>

  <p>"Soledade Hotel," I told the driver.</p>

  <p>In five minutes he lowered us to the flat hotel roof. I paid him while Pat
  unloaded the cameras. We passed them to a couple of liveried attendants, who
  led the way to our suite.</p>

  <p>Miss Davis arose from her typewriter desk, concern in her eyes, as we
  entered.</p>

  <p>"Was anyone injured? Why, where's Mr. Reeves?</p>

  <p>He's not-"</p>

  <p>"Not dead, so far as we know," I replied. "Captured. I'll explain later.
  Get me the secretary of the Association at once, on the radiovisiphone. Then
  the President of Nicaragua."</p>

  <p>"But President Monteiro and his daughter are here in the hotel," said Miss
  Davis. "They came from Managua, today. Relief work, you know."</p>

  <p>"All right. Get Secretary Black. Then I'll look up President
  Monteiro."</p>

  <p>The face of my chief presently appeared in the radiovisiphone disc.</p>

  <p>"Stuart!" he exclaimed. "What are you up to now?"</p>

  <p>"Turn on your recorder," I replied. "Then I'll tell you."</p>

  <p>"It's on. Go ahead."</p>

  <p>I DID. I related every detail of the strange sights we had just witnessed,
  and the incredible experience through which we had just passed.</p>

  <p>When I finished, he said:</p>

  <p>"If anyone but you had told me this. Stuart, I'd think it some sort of a
  practical joke. But you are such a serious person, I believe you. Yet it's
  possible that you were suffering from an hallucination."</p>

  <p>"I'll send you photographs within ten hours," I said. "Cameras don't have
  hallucinations."</p>

  <p>"Right. I'll notify the War Department. Remain within call. Off."</p>

  <p>As he spoke the word "Off," the connection was automatically broken. His
  face faded from the disc.</p>

  <p>Miss Davis had gotten the President of Nicaragua on the room
  visiphone.</p>

  <p>"President Monteiro will see you in ten minutes," she said. "He is in
  Parlor L."</p>

  <p>I went into the next room, where Pat was busy developing his films. He had
  taken his small metal captive from his binocular case and confined it in a
  stout bird cage with a small padlock on the door. It was leaning against the
  bars, watching him with its round, headlight eyes, as I entered.</p>

  <p>"Get your stuff in shape so you can leave it, Pat," I said. "We're going
  to call on President Monteiro in ten minutes, and take the prisoner with
  us."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later I knocked on the door of President Monteiro's suite. Pat
  stood behind me with his caged prisoner. We were ushered in by an attendant.
  The president, a small dark man with a carefully trimmed iron gray beard, was
  seated behind a large mahogany table. Beside him, with her hand on his
  shoulder, stood a slender, brown-eyed girl, apparently about twenty years of
  age. I recognized her instantly from the photographs I had seen of her, as
  Dolores Monteiro, daughter of the president, and the most famous beauty in
  the two Americas.</p>

  <p>The president greeted me cordially. I introduced my assistant, and he
  presented us to his daughter. An attendant placed chairs.</p>

  <p>Selecting a long, thin cigar from a humidor, and pushing it toward me with
  a gesture of invitation, the president said:</p>

  <p>"And now, Señor Stuart, what is this important message you have for
  me?"</p>

  <p>Briefly I told him of our strange experience&mdash;the astounding sights
  we had witnessed, and our narrow escape. He smoked with countenance unruffled
  until the end. Then he said:</p>

  <p>"Understand me, señor, I am not doubting your word. But a story so strange
  as yours needs substantiation. You will not mind if
  I&mdash;ah&mdash;investigate further?"</p>

  <p>"That is precisely what I hope you will do," I replied. "We have brought
  an exhibit, however, which I believe will convince you&mdash;a miniature
  specimen of the strange race of metal creatures we saw."</p>

  <p>I lifted the cage, and put it on the table. The little creature inside it
  focused its huge headlight eyes inquiringly on each of us in turn, as if
  wondering what to expect next.</p>

  <p>"Looks like a man-made automaton," commented the president.</p>

  <p>"True," I replied, "yet it, and its larger fellows which we encountered,
  acted as if endowed with intelligence."</p>

  <p>"You think these creatures will be&mdash;hostile?"</p>

  <p>"Judging by their past actions, yes."</p>

  <p>"Hum. We'll try them a little further."</p>

  <p>He pressed a button on the table. A buzzer sounded in the next room and a
  uniformed aide came in.</p>

  <p>"Dispatch three combat ships, fully armed and manned, to the crater
  Coseguina at once," he ordered. "Tell them to be on the lookout for flying
  globes and strange metal beings, but to make no hostile move unless attacked.
  Have one descend as far as possible into the crater while the other two stand
  by to guard it. If attacked, they are to defend themselves to the best of
  their ability. And let me hear their reports."</p>

  <p>The aide bowed and withdrew.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would like to see some photographs," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"With pleasure," replied the president.</p>

  <p>"I'll make some quick prints and bring them up," said Pat, rising. "Shall
  I leave the prisoner here?"</p>

  <p>" Yes, leave him," said Monteiro. "I want to examine him further."</p>

  <p>Pat went out and closed the door. The president poked an inquiring finger
  through the bars at the little creature in the cage, then withdrew it hastily
  with an exclamation of surprise as it struck at the encroaching digit with
  one of its tentacle arms.</p>

  <p>"Per Dios!" he exclaimed. "This one, at least, is hostile. We shall soon
  find out about the others."</p>

  <p>We did not have long to wait. The radiovisiphone hummed, and the face of
  the squadron commander's operator appeared in the disc.</p>

  <p>"We are hovering over the southern rim of Coseguina. RX-337 hang? over the
  northern rim. RN-339 is above the shaft. It descends. A huge sphere has come
  out to meet it. They collide. The 339 falls, a mass of wreckage. Our machine
  gunners are spraying the globe with bullets, as are those of the 337. It
  darts for the 337, which tries to elude it, but is brought down with one side
  torn off. It is coming at us. Our commander has ordered a retreat. It is too
  swift for us. It is almost upon us.</p>

  <p>We are d-"</p>

  <p>There was a terrific crash, and the disc went blank. Tensely, we waited in
  front of the disc&mdash;the president, the girl and I. It continued blank.
  Monteiro rushed into the next room. I could hear him volleying orders.</p>

  <p>Suddenly I was aware that my wrist was tingling. Someone was trying to
  call me. I pressed the connection of my wrist radiophone.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stuart Mr. Stuart!" It was the voice of Reeves.</p>

  <p>"Art Reeves!" I exclaimed, "where are you?"</p>

  <p>"Not much tine. Called to warn you. That little metal man guided them to
  you. Keep him in darkness. Leave at once. They're coming for me. Must-"</p>

  <p>"Quick!" I said. "We must get out of here!"</p>

  <p>Stripping the scarf from the table, I was about to muffle the cage when
  something struck the window-screen&mdash;ripped it away. A huge tentacle
  whipped into the room. Clinging to it were four of the globular metal
  creatures. One picked up the cage, a second seized the girl, and the other
  two pounced upon me, gripping my arms with their powerful tentacles. As
  helpless as if I had been held in a steel vise, I saw girl and cage jerked
  out of the window and upward. Then the big tentacle returned, wrapped around
  my waist, and dragged me after them.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; THE CITY OF METAL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I WAS thrown into a small, brilliantly lighted room. A heavy
  metal door clanged shut behind me. To all appearances the floor, walls and
  ceiling were constructed of seamless brown metal, without windows or doors.
  Even the source of the light was invisible. It seemed to radiate from the six
  metal surfaces that surrounded me.</p>

  <p>On the floor lay the girl, a look of terror in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Bending over, I lifted her to a sitting posture. The floor lurched
  suddenly, and I sprawled beside her. Recovering my balance, I asked:</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt, señorita?"</p>

  <p>"No, señor, but I am very frightened. Where are we?"</p>

  <p>"If I'm not mistaken," I replied, "we're riding in one of the swift flying
  globes of the metal people."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes there was a second lurch, followed by a sudden jolt that
  threw us both flat. Then a door opened in the apparently solid wall, and four
  of the metal creatures came in. Helping us to our feet, they hustled us out
  upon a platform constructed from brown metal. It was part of an extensive
  system of docks, along which hundreds of the globes rested. Countless others
  were arriving and leaving, from and for all points of the compass. Far above
  these flying globes I could see, through a dim haze, a great self-luminous
  dome&mdash;the ceiling of this tremendous underground world.</p>

  <p>But most amazing of all was the immense city of gleaming white metal which
  surrounded the docks&mdash;a city of glistening towers, walls and
  battlements, all metal.</p>

  <p>But conductors led us to a queer brown-metal vehicle&mdash;flat, with a
  hand-rail traversing the center longitudinally. In lieu of wheels, it
  traveled on four spheres, which supported it on idling bearings. There were
  no seats. Our captors, after bundling us aboard, indicated that we must
  stand, gripping the rail in the center.</p>

  <p>The vehicle started smoothly, accelerating with great rapidity. I was
  unable to see any controls, and none of our captors seemed to be driving or
  steering it. Emerging from the dock, we rolled out on a broad, smooth street,
  paved with brown metal. Many vehicles like that we occupied were traversing
  this street, some of them at terrific rates of speed. Some had passengers,
  some carried materials of various kinds, and some were empty.</p>

  <p>Moving in and out among the vehicles, and often traveling at even greater
  speeds, were thousands of silvery metal globes of divers sizes. I noticed
  some of them no larger than buckshot, while others were easily ten feet in
  diameter. I saw them, from time to time, stop at the entrances of buildings,
  put forth arms, legs and heads, and enter. Others, coming out of the
  buildings, retracted their limbs and heads and rolled swiftly away. I judged
  them to be factories, and afterward confirmed this belief.</p>

  <p>We passed a building under construction, and I saw that it was being put
  together in the same manner as the metal shaft I had seen rising in
  Coseguina&mdash;the bodies of thousands of these strange creatures being
  utilized as building material.</p>

  <p>Presently we drew up before a metal wall about fifty feet in height. Two
  massive gates, which had previously appeared as part of the wall itself,
  swung back, revealing a winding metal roadway which led to an immense
  building that stood in the center of the most unusual garden I have ever
  seen.</p>

  <p>Instead of grass, flowers, shrubs and trees, it was filled with mosses,
  moulds, fungae, lichens and other thallophytic growths. Short velvety gray
  moss carpeted the lawn. There were clumps of huge mushrooms and morels, of
  many shapes, sizes and colors. But the most striking of all were the
  varieties of gigantic slime moulds.</p>

  <p>The <i>leocarpus fragilis</i> with its gleaming golden spore cases shaped
  like elongated eggs, a mycetozoan on the borderland between the animal and
  vegetable kingdoms, grew to a height of ten feet. Globe-shaped physariums
  attained a diameter of three to four feet. And the dusky plumes of the
  stemonitis, massed in large clumps, waved twenty feet above our heads. Not so
  pleasing to look upon were the slimy, gelatinous plasmodia of the various
  species, flowing sluggishly about in the areas to which they had been
  confined, questing the food which they must have in order to produce the
  beautiful plumes, globes, baskets and ovoid spore cases of mature ones.</p>

  <p>They were all creatures of the darkness&mdash;conceived and developed
  without sunlight&mdash;unable even to exist in the direct rays of the lord of
  the solar system, but multiplying and growing prodigiously, here in this
  weird, pale light of the nether world.</p>

  <p>We came to a stop before what looked like the unbroken wall of the
  building, but here again a previously invisible door opened, revealing a
  circular doorway about fifteen feet in diameter.</p>

  <p>Here we left our strange vehicle, and walked between our guards along a
  narrow corridor until we came to a great central foyer which evidently
  reached to the top of the building. Looking up, I could see galleries
  encircling it at each level, clear to the top. On the floor of this room near
  its center was a ring of black discs, each about ten feet in diameter,
  encircled by a narrow railing. Our captors led us out on one of these and
  directed us to grip the railing, whereupon it shot up into the air with
  considerable speed, then slanted over toward one of the higher balconies.</p>

  <p>Peering over the railing, I saw that we were being lifted by a gigantic
  segmented tentacle emerging from the floor where the disc had been. After we
  had been deposited on the balcony the disc swiftly returned to its original
  position.</p>

  <p>MANY round doors opened on the balcony, and we were conducted through one
  of these along a corridor to a second, much larger doorway, on each side of
  which stood two guards carrying metal tubes. They paid no attention to us as
  we were ushered into a magnificently furnished room which contrasted oddly
  with the plain brown metal corridors and foyer. The foyer was thickly and
  richly carpeted, the walls were decorated with murals near the bottom and bas
  reliefs above, and the ceiling was of luminous yellow metal, which shed a
  soft, amber light over the whole scene.</p>

  <p>At the far end of the room a figure reclined beneath a green and gold
  canopy, upon a luxuriously cushioned dais raised about three feet above the
  level of the floor. As we drew near the throne, the figure sat up. I gazed
  aghast at the thing that confronted us.</p>

  <p>At first I thought it a living human skeleton, but as we drew closer, I
  saw that its flesh and skin were transparent, its bones and teeth
  translucent, and its viscera and nervous system opaque. Its immense head,
  fully twice as large in proportion to its size as that of any earthly man,
  was encircled by a jewel- encrusted gold band, which supported an immense
  emerald at the center of the forehead. It wore no clothing, but its waist was
  encircled by a belt of golden links from which a dagger with a jeweled hilt,
  and several other instruments or weapons, I knew not which, depended. Its
  feet were enclosed in pointed golden slippers.</p>

  <p>The horrible creature arose as our conductors brought us to a halt, and
  stepped forward to examine us. It poked me in the midriff with an
  inquisitive, gelatinous finger, pulled down my chin to look into my mouth,
  and felt my arms and legs. Wherever it touched me, it left prints of slime
  very much like those left by a garden slug. Its fingers felt cold and
  clammy.</p>

  <p>Having completed its examination of me, the thing returned to its dais and
  reclined. Then, to my surprise, it addressed, or seemed to address me in
  English.</p>

  <p>"I am disappointed in you, Walter Stuart. Although my other prisoner,
  Arthur Reeves, looked up to you as a leader, you are one of the creatures of
  the lower order. And your cranial capacity precludes the possibility of a
  brain large enough to receive and retain the higher training. Are there no
  creatures of the higher order upon the outer crust of the earth?"</p>

  <p>"I take it," I replied, "that you consider yourself a creature of the
  higher order."</p>

  <p>"I rule the creatures of the higher order," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"These men of metal?"</p>

  <p>"No, small-brained one. They are machines of my invention. I rule the
  people of my race&mdash;the higher order of creatures&mdash;the Snals. With
  the aid of my metal creatures, my Teks, I conquered the inner
  world&mdash;brought every Snal nation under my rule. They are irresistible,
  my Teks, when I direct them. I am Zet, conqueror and emperor of the inner
  world."</p>

  <p>"I am puzzled to know," I said, "how you learned English."</p>

  <p>"Your brain is even more deficient than I suspected," said Zet. "Our
  conversation is one of thoughts, not words."</p>

  <p>"But I am speaking, and you seem to speak," I insisted. "I can hear
  you."</p>

  <p>"You can speak and hear in a dream," said Zet, "yet you actually do
  neither. Call this a dream if you like. Or bring up, if you wish, those other
  words in your mind&mdash;telepathy or clairaudience. Our subjective minds are
  conversing without the employment of physical means. The conversation is
  instantly transferred to the objective consciousness.</p>

  <p>"But who are you to question Zet, ruler of the inner world? Answer my
  question."</p>

  <p>"There are no Snals on the outer crust of the earth," I said. "It is
  dominated by creatures called men, of which I am a specimen."</p>

  <p>"That is unfortunate," said Zet. "I had hoped to find creatures of a
  higher order to conquer. But the outer crust will make a mighty
  empire&mdash;and I can set my Snals to rule over these inferior animals
  called men. It may be, too, that we can improve the race. Perhaps my nobles
  will take some of your females into their seraglios, thus founding a new
  race. Our bodies are more fragile than yours. Your brains are inferior to
  ours. A fusion of the races may prove of great benefit to both. It is worth
  trying."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure that our brains are inferior," I retorted. "On the outer
  crust people born with heads as large as yours are usually imbeciles."</p>

  <p>"And in the inner world, people born with heads as small as yours are
  invariably microcephalous idiots," he said, apparently unruffled. "But it may
  be that I can use you. I'll have you examined by my scientists. I couldn't
  use your assistant, Reeves. He disobeyed my first order and communicated with
  you. To disobey is death."</p>

  <p>"You mean you killed him?"</p>

  <p>"I did not slay him in anger, as you seem to think. He was turned over to
  my scientists for a thorough physical examination which they were very
  anxious to make. He was the first man they had ever seen, and they desired to
  take him apart."</p>

  <p>"And they did this while he lived?"</p>

  <p>"Partly. I understand that he died shortly after the examination
  began."</p>

  <p>Vivisection! Poor Art Reeves cut open alive! And at the order of this big-
  headed, slimy monstrosity before me. Furious anger fired me&mdash;quadrupled
  my strength for the moment. With a sudden jerk, I twisted my arms free of the
  metal tentacles that held them, and leaped for the dais. My fingers ached to
  clutch the gelatinous throat of the thing that had ordered his death.</p>

  <p>With lightning quickness, the hand of Zet jerked a small tube from his
  belt&mdash;pointed it at my breast. I felt a terrific shock, as if a powerful
  electric current were passing through my body. My muscles grew
  rigid&mdash;immobile. I seemed rooted to the floor. Then the two Teks leaped
  forward, seized my arms and dragged me back to my original position.</p>

  <p>Zet replaced the tube in his belt.</p>

  <p>"So," he said, "you are even more of an animal than I suspected. In one
  instant, you permitted your emotions to completely overthrow your reason. I
  doubt if I can use you. But my scientists will find out while I examine this
  other creature, which appears to be a female."</p>

  <p>I saw the girl shudder as Zet arose and walked toward her. Then,
  struggling futilely, I was dragged away by the two Teks.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; THE BATTLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MY TWO metal captors took me down the corridor and out upon
  the balcony. Here they placed me on a railed black metal disc similar to that
  which had lifted us from the first floor, and we were hoisted to the second
  balcony above. Then they led me down another corridor, and through a circular
  door into a large room in which more, than a hundred Snals were working, some
  seated at tables, others standing before high benches on which were flasks,
  tubes, retorts, immense magnifying glasses, and much other paraphernalia I
  did not recognize.</p>

  <p>I was conducted to a square, glassed-in room in the center of this vast
  laboratory, where a Snal with a head even larger than that of Zet, sat at a
  metal table. This room, with its glass partitions, was so situated that he
  could look into any corner of the laboratory without leaving his seat.</p>

  <p>Fastened to a metal band that encircled his head was an immense lens that
  covered both eyes and most of his nose, so magnifying those hideous features
  that they were out of proportion with the others, and creating a most
  grotesque effect.</p>

  <p>The two Teks forcibly seated me in a gray metal chair across the table
  from the Snal, and departed. I was surprised that this slimy, gelatinous
  individual would allow me in his presence without the Teks to guard me, but
  learned the reason when, under his steady gaze, I tried to shift to a more
  comfortable position. I was as firmly attached to the metal chair, which was
  in turn attached to the floor, as if I had been bound with steel bands. Yet
  the invisible force that held me did not manifest itself except when I tried
  to shift my position on the chair.</p>

  <p>The Snal stood up, squinting at me through his huge lens. Through his
  transparent body and his translucent ribs, I could see his heart beating, his
  lungs inflating and deflating, and his stomach expanding and contracting as
  it disposed of his last meal. It was evident from his demeanor that he
  thought me an exceedingly queer looking creature. The feeling was mutual.</p>

  <p>"You have been sent to me for examination, Walter Stuart," he said,
  finally. "I am Hax, chief scientist of the Snal empire."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll take me apart to find out what makes me go, as you did
  poor Reeves," I replied.</p>

  <p>"You say 'poor Reeves,'", he answered. "That is bad. It indicates the
  exercise of emotion, rather than reason. No, I do not intend taking you
  apart&mdash;not just now, at least. You are to be tested mentally."</p>

  <p>He pushed a shiny metal sphere on the table before me. Suddenly it
  appeared to become transparent.</p>

  <p>"A good beginning," said Hax. "You have the vision. It may be that we can
  use you. Step into this scene."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, as I gazed into that metal globe, I felt myself drawn into
  it&mdash;felt that it had enlarged until it was as high as the sky.</p>

  <p>I was moving&mdash;walking on a metal stairway. Globes were rolling up
  beside me, becoming Teks, springing up to the top of a wall. In my
  hands&mdash;not hands, tentacles&mdash;I held a bent tube from which gleaming
  liquid metal poured forth each time I pressed a small button on the side. My
  torso was spherical&mdash;a shining globe of metal.</p>

  <p>When I had cemented the globe in place I waited for another to climb up
  beside it. Meanwhile, I glanced over the rim of the wall. It was level with
  the crater rim of Coseguina. And between me and that rim, thousands of other
  workers like myself were building a metal city on the sloping sides of the
  crater. Their animated building material was coming up the shaft in a steady
  stream, rolling up a spiral ramp that had been constructed at one side. On
  the crater rim, a great metal dome was rising&mdash;swiftly closing inward
  and upward toward the center with amazing rapidity&mdash;shutting out the
  daylight from above.</p>

  <p>Reflecting the sunlight from their shimmering sides, a dozen huge, flying
  globes slowly circled overhead.</p>

  <p>The vision suddenly faded. I was back in the laboratory, glued to the
  metal chair&mdash;a human being once more.</p>

  <p>"You have followed well," said Hax. "Now let me see if you can
  control."</p>

  <p>From beneath the table he produced two electrodes on insulated wires. He
  directed me to grasp one in each hand. Then once more the globe before me
  became clear&mdash;expanded.</p>

  <p>I was in a huge warehouse at the peak of a pile of metal globes. I was a
  metal globe! I could look out through my own metal torso as if it had been a
  pane of glass.</p>

  <p>"Descend." A voice came from somewhere beside me, yet I saw no one.</p>

  <p>I rolled from my position, and down the side of the pyramid of globes.
  When I was half way down, the voice said: "Stop."</p>

  <p>I halted, clinging to the slanting surface by some magnetic force which I
  was able to control.</p>

  <p>"Let go."</p>

  <p>I shut off the force, and rolled to the floor,</p>

  <p>"Walk."</p>

  <p>I thrust out leg and arm tentacles, put forth my metal head with its great
  goggling eyes, and scrambled to my feet.</p>

  <p>"Back to your place."</p>

  <p>Suddenly retracting head and limbs, I rolled back to the top of the
  pyramid and lay still.</p>

  <p>The vision faded. Once more I sat in the laboratory before this strange
  scientist.</p>

  <p>"You can control," he said. "That is good. If you can do this there are
  others of your race who can also do it. Your mind is unusually strong
  considering the smallness of your brain. We can use you."</p>

  <p>"For what?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"For that which you have just done. To control a Tek. Every Tek, large or
  small, is controlled by a Snal. By using your people to control the Teks, we
  will release thousands of Snals for other, more intellectual duties, to which
  their greater minds are suited."</p>

  <p>"You mean," I said, "that you intend to make slaves of my
  people&mdash;slaves who will labor with their minds rather than their
  bodies?"</p>

  <p>"Of those who can pass the test, yes. The others will go to feed the
  plasmodia of the slime moulds which we cultivate for food. Thus we can make
  use of all. There will be no waste. We are efficient, we Snals."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. But you haven't conquered mankind, and I don't believe you
  will."</p>

  <p>"In order that you may entertain no false hopes," said Hax, "I'll show you
  what is now transpiring. Watch the globe."</p>

  <p>I did. It suddenly became transparent. I was a goggle-eyed Tek, seated
  high in the air in a metal room situated in a great dome which covered the
  crater Coseguina. The work of building had been completed with incredible
  swiftness. I was surrounded by metal, yet I had the power of looking through
  it at any point by flashing a special ray from between my eyes.</p>

  <p>A FLEET of twelve battleships was approaching from the south. They flew
  the flag of Nicaragua. Another fleet of seven, flying the flag of Honduras,
  approached from the north, across the Gulf of Fonseca. The two fleets
  deployed, and formed a semicircle, fronting the isthmus on which the volcano
  was situated. From the land side an immense army approached behind a long
  line of great, rumbling tanks. And two fleets of mighty aerial battleships
  closed in above, attended by several hundred relatively small but exceedingly
  swift helicopter electroplanes.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, as if every gun in the attacking force were under single
  control, a terrific bombardment began. Shells from the battleships and
  artillery rained on that metal dome. Immense bombs were dropped by the aerial
  battleships and electroplanes. Projectiles of smaller caliber, from
  seventy-fives down to thirty-forties, rattled against that great hemisphere
  of gleaming metal. But not one shell or projectile so much as dented it.</p>

  <p>This bombardment lasted for perhaps five minutes without interruption, and
  without any visible effect on the great dome. Then, suddenly, a thousand
  doors that had hitherto appeared to be a part of the solid metal, opened.
  From each door emerged a flying globe. Like a swarm of angry bees defending a
  hive, they hurtled at the attackers. Bullets rattled and shells burst against
  them without effect.</p>

  <p>Two globes descended on a Nicaraguan battleship, one above the fore deck,
  the other near the stern. Long metal tentacles slithered down, gripping the
  front and rear turrets. And down these tentacles swarmed the Teks. They
  plunged into the turrets&mdash;down the ladders. Each Tek, as it emerged,
  dragged a human prisoner. One by one these prisoners were passed up into the
  globes. The Teks followed. The tentacles were drawn up. And the battleship,
  out of control, traveled aimlessly in a circle as the globes returned with
  their prisoners.</p>

  <p>This scene was, at the same time, being enacted on all the other
  battleships. Other globes seized the aerial battleships with their powerful
  tentacles, boarded them, took off the men, and left them to drift unguided,
  or to crash. One by one the electroplanes were caught and denuded of men. The
  army attempted to retreat, but this was quickly prevented by a row of globes
  which formed on the ground, stretching across the peninsula. The Teks swarmed
  everywhere. Men were pulled out of the tanks&mdash;dragged away from the
  field pieces, or caught as they attempted to flee or hide.</p>

  <p>All the battleships were circling erratically. There were several
  collisions. One ship went down, rammed by another. Aerial battleships and
  electroplanes were continually crashing to the ground or falling into the
  Gulf and the ocean. Huge tanks, driverless, climbed the peak as far as the
  edge of the dome, stood up, grinding at the shimmering metal, and fell over
  backward, their motors roaring, to tumble down the steep slope they had
  climbed, and smash to masses of twisted wreckage at the bottom.</p>

  <p>In less than thirty minutes after the bombardment began, the last globe
  returned to the dome. And so far as I could see, not a single one of the
  fighters who had attacked so valiantly by land, sea and air, was left to tell
  the tale.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; SLAVERY OF THE MIND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE scene faded. Once more I was back in the laboratory with
  Hax. His colorless, glass-like eyes leered at me through the huge lens.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, "how hopeless it is for mankind to resist us. We are
  invincible."</p>

  <p>"You have but defeated the forces of two small nations," I replied. "The
  earth has not yet begun to fight. Her scientists will find a way to defeat
  you."</p>

  <p>"Her scientists are weak-minded children, compared to the most ignorant
  Snals," he said, contemptuously. "They are creatures of a lower order, fit
  only for slaves. And you will go now to begin your slavery with the
  rest."</p>

  <p>Two Teks suddenly appeared behind me. Seizing my arms, they lifted me from
  the chair and hurried me away. As I left the laboratory the mocking laughter
  of Hax followed me.</p>

  <p>The Teks took me out of the building the way I had come. One of the queer,
  rolling vehicles was waiting. My hands were forced down on the central rail,
  which glowed as if with some radioactive force. They stuck there, and try as
  I could, I was unable to remove them.</p>

  <p>We passed through the gates in the wall, and threaded the city streets to
  a great, large structure near the cocks. A number of other similar vehicles
  with glowing handrails were waiting around the building. And thousands of
  prisoners, disembarking from arriving globes, were being herded into this
  building by the Teks.</p>

  <p>Others were being driven out of another entrance I noticed that some were
  forced to grasp the shining hand rails, while others were bound, hand and
  foot, with wire, and stacked on the vehicles like cord wood. At first I saw
  only soldiers, sailors and airmen, wearing the uniforms of Nicaragua and
  Honduras. But the globes presently began to disgorge loads of
  civilians&mdash;-men, women and children, whites, mestizos, Indians and
  Negroes, evidently taken in raids on the nearby territory.</p>

  <p>The vehicles, loaded with their human freight and each presided over by a
  Tek, began to form in a long line. When a train of about six hundred had been
  formed, we left. All traffic had evidently been stopped to let us through,
  for although I could see many vehicles on the other streets those through
  which our leader piloted us were deserted.</p>

  <p>The vehicle in which I was riding was a half mile or so behind the one
  which led the procession. About half of the vehicles were loaded with the
  bound prisoner; and half with those held by the luminous hand rails. A load
  of the poor bound wretches was just ahead of me. I could hear their piteous
  moans. Their wrists and ankles were so tightly bound with wire that they were
  cut and bleeding. And those at the bottom of the pile were crushed by the
  weight of the ones above them.</p>

  <p>Our train soon passed through the city, ani out upon a great metal
  causeway that stretched above a weird and unusual landscape of grotesque
  thallophytic growths. These were in orderly array, and tended by Teks. Among
  the cultivated plants I saw a number of varieties of gigantic slime moulds.
  They were cultivated in pits about twelve feet in diameter, set in rows with
  metal runways between them. Some of the pits contained great masses of naked,
  polynuclear protoplasm&mdash;the plasmodia which would later develop into
  adult slime moulds.</p>

  <p>As we passed along through these fields I noticed that, from time to time,
  one of the cars containing the bound human beings was shunted off the
  causeway and along one of the tracks which ran between the plasmodium pits.
  Watching one of these as we sped past, I saw the Tek lift a bound human being
  and hurl his helpless victim into one of the pits. At the next pit he stopped
  and repeated the process. The grim prophecy of Hax was already coming to
  pass.</p>

  <p>The men who were fastened on the vehicle on which I rode numbered about
  twenty. There were five naval officers, five seamen, eight Indians and two
  Negroes. The man just ahead of me wore the uniform of a lieutenant.</p>

  <p>"What did they do to you in the round building, Señor?" I asked him in
  Spanish.</p>

  <p>"We were given a test to see if we could control those metal creatures,
  señor," he replied. "Those who could not pass the test&mdash;many of them
  women and children&mdash;were bound with wire. It is horrible. What are they
  doing with them?"</p>

  <p>I told him. He ground his teeth and cursed luridly. Presently he
  asked:</p>

  <p>"And what will they do with the rest of us?"</p>

  <p>"As long as we can serve," I replied, "we'll probably be slaves. After
  that, food for the plasmodia."</p>

  <p>Of the six hundred vehicles that left the city, about three hundred drew
  up before a great, dome-like building. The others, with their wire-bound
  victims, had been shunted away to the slime mould farms.</p>

  <p>A great circular door opened in the apparently solid wall of the building.
  The Tek who presided over our vehicle shut off the current in the rail,
  releasing our hands. Then we were herded into the building with the
  others&mdash;whites, mestizos, Indians and Negroes, men and women, mixed
  indiscriminately.</p>

  <p>The first room in which we found ourselves was an immense lobby which
  encircled the building. This room proved to be the living and sleeping
  quarters of the Snal workers, whose places we human slaves were to take.
  While one-half of the workers labored in the inner rooms, the other half
  slept and took recreation in this apartment. Their bunks were metal cylinders
  about three feet in diameter and seven feet long, stacked three rows high
  along the outer wall. They contained no padding or covers, and were as
  private as gold-fish bowls. The tired workers, without bothering to disrobe,
  crawled into them and stretched out on the cold metal when ordered to do so
  by their overseers. They crawled out again to receive their meagre rations
  and to resume work when their sleep period had elapsed.</p>

  <p>The overseers wore round, pointed helmets and complete . suits of
  scale-armor made from a dull-surfaced, dark brown metal. Their weapons were
  paralyzing ray tubes, like that which Zet had used on me, and queer,
  double-edge weapons, the blades of which looked like two meat-axes welded
  together, back to back, with handles about eighteen inches in length hooked
  at the end to hang from their belts; they carried slender metal rods about
  eight feet in length, the pointed ends of which continually glowed at a red
  heat.</p>

  <p>WE were forced to disrobe and don the coarse aprons. In each apron were
  two pockets, one of which contained a glass flask and the other a shallow
  bowl. As fast as we donned our slave raiment, we were driven in single file
  past a counter, where we were issued water in our flasks and a thick, jet
  black porridge, which I afterward learned was made from the spores of a
  species of slime mould, in our bowls. It had a rank, musty flavor, and I
  could not stomach it at first, but as it was the only food given us, we had
  to eat it or starve. Most of us eventually got so we could consume the
  portions served us, although I doubt if anyone really learned to like the
  stuff.</p>

  <p>After we had been given our garments and rations, we were herded into the
  immense central control room. The floor of this room rose in circular
  concentric terraces conforming to the contour of the domed roof above, and
  ending in a small round platform occupied by the chief overseer, who could
  thus look down on the entire workroom.</p>

  <p>Set against the faces of the terraces were curved tables. Twenty workers
  were seated at each table, gazing into their control globes and gripping
  their electrodes. Each table was presided over by an armed and armored
  overseer, who gazed into a large globe mounted on a tripod, in which he could
  watch the collective activities of the Teks controlled by his workers. A
  worker, caught shirking or making an error, was punished by a searing touch
  from the red-hot point of the overseer's long rod.</p>

  <p>I was assigned to a seat between two Snal workers, and noticed that this
  arrangement was maintained with the other slaves&mdash;first a Snal, then a
  human slave. The young lieutenant who had ridden on the same vehicle with me
  was seated just beyond the Snal at my right.</p>

  <p>At a sharp command from the overseer, I grasped my controls and gazed into
  my globe. I instantly found myself a Tek, operating a gigantic mechanical
  shovel that was scooping up what looked like white sand from the floor and
  walls of a huge pit and dropping it into vehicles with globe-wheels and
  hopper-shaped bodies. These vehicles, each operated by one Tek, moved past in
  a steady stream as fast as I filled them with the white sand. One immense
  shovelful sufficed to fill each vehicle.</p>

  <p>Other Teks labored nearby with similar mechanical shovels. The vehicles, I
  noticed, were all moving toward a great structure some distance away, from
  which columns of smoke or vapor were rising, and from which, at times, lurid
  flashes of light gave a blood-orange tint to the surrounding landscape and to
  the vapors that floated beneath the great vault, high overhead.</p>

  <p>It dawned on me that this white sand must be a metallic ore&mdash;a salt
  of some metal&mdash;and that the building to which it was being taken was a
  smelter or refinery.</p>

  <p>As I sat there working, it seemed that I developed the faculty of being
  two places at once&mdash;thinking two sets of thoughts at the same time.
  Objectively, I sat and worked in the control room. Subjectively, I operated
  the mechanical shovel. It was like playing a piano and singing at the same
  time&mdash;or perhaps more like singing an air and playing a violin
  obbligato. Doing two things at once, one objectively, the other subjectively,
  yet conscious of doing both.</p>

  <p>The Snals had permitted me to retain my wrist chronometer, though my
  radiophone was taken from me. They had learned its use when Art Reeves had
  sacrificed his life to warn me&mdash;all to no avail.</p>

  <p>The chronometer showed that our day was divided into two periods of about
  ten hours each&mdash;a work period and a rest period. The work period lasted
  for ten solid hours without intermission, nor were we permitted to take our
  hands from the electrodes even for an instant during that period. When the
  work period was finished, the second shift of workers was ready to take our
  places. We were then issued water and black porridge, and permitted to roam
  about in our living quarters for about an hour. At the end of the hour,
  however, we were peremptorily ordered into our sleeping cylinders for eight
  hours. We were then ordered out, fed and watered, and at the end of another
  hour, marched into the control room to relieve the shift that had been
  working while we slept and rested.</p>

  <p>The division in which I worked, labored unremittingly at digging and
  loading a seemingly endless desert of white ore. I learned from workers in
  other divisions that some of them were engaged in smelting the ore, some in
  building metal cities and warehouses, others in building flying globes, and
  still others in transporting materials and prisoners through the streets of
  the subterranean cities and along the metal causeways that connected
  them.</p>

  <p>With the aid of my chronometer I kept careful track of the outer world
  time.</p>

  <p>Within two weeks after my arrival, every worker Snal in the building had
  been replaced by a human slave. The only Snals remaining were the armed and
  armored overseers.</p>

  <p>I often thought of Dolores Monteiro as I had last seen her, shuddering
  before Zet, the slimy emperor of the nether world, and wondered what had
  become of her. She was a lovely creature, and unspoiled, despite the
  adulation she had always received.</p>

  <p>Although certainly not human, Zet greatly resembled a human being in form.
  He had spoken of an experiment&mdash;an attempt at crossing the races. And I
  feared that the beauty of this girl might have tempted him to force her into
  his own seraglio. The thought was revolting. And the uncertainty was almost
  as maddening as the definite knowledge would have been.</p>

  <p>During the hours after and before the sleeping periods, I used to walk
  around the building, scanning the faces of all the white females. At the end
  of a month I was still looking for her, but looking hopelessly.</p>

  <p>Then, one day, I was startled by the familiar sound of a girl's voice
  behind me!</p>

  <p>"Señor!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; THE TREACHERY OF LAK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was Dolores Monteiro who had called to me. She was
  wearing the coarse slave apron, but even in this rough garment she was
  ravishingly beautiful. My heart stood still as I looked down into her eyes
  for a moment, scarcely realizing that the object of my long quest stood
  before me.</p>

  <p>"Señorita!" I exclaimed. "I've been looking for you everywhere."</p>

  <p>"And I for you," she replied. "When were you sent here?"</p>

  <p>"That first day," I answered. "And you?"</p>

  <p>"Shortly after you left me standing before Zet," she replied. "But this is
  an immense place&mdash;almost a city."</p>

  <p>"Then Zet did not harm you?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied, "but I will never forget the feel of his cold, slimy
  hands on me." She shuddered at the memory. "It was nauseating. Ugh!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," I said. "But didn't he do or say anything else?"</p>

  <p>She answered me, almost in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"That is the reason I had to find you. He did say something else, and
  ordered me not to tell. To disobey him is death, they say, but I must confide
  in you."</p>

  <p>"Don't say it," I warned her.</p>

  <p>"But I must. There is a reason. He said I would be sent away with the
  other slaves for the time being, to learn to work and to become accustomed to
  the ways of his people. But he said, also, that he would give positive orders
  that I should not be harmed, for someday soon he would honor me by sending
  for me."</p>

  <p>"You mean-"</p>

  <p>She nodded despairingly.</p>

  <p>"I should kill myself at the first opportunity, of course, but I wanted to
  find you first&mdash;to tell you, the one person I know and can trust in this
  horrible place, so that if you live and some day meet my father and mother
  you can tell them the truth. They might otherwise think that I&mdash;that I
  went willingly. And there is no hope of escape. So you see why I had to tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"'While there is life there is hope,'" I quoted. "Don't give up. Will you
  meet me at this spot after the work period?"</p>

  <p>The call to work sounded as I spoke.</p>

  <p>"I'll be here," she replied, and hurried away.</p>

  <p>Some moments later I sat down at my work table, my senses in a whirl. My
  electrodes lay untouched before me, until a searing pain on my bare shoulder
  and the smell of my own burning flesh brought me to a realization of my
  surrroundings.</p>

  <p>"To work, quickly!" snarled my overseer, "or there will be a worse
  burn."</p>

  <p>I snatched the electrodes, and with my shoulder smarting from the touch of
  the red hot rod started my Tek at its apparently endless task of shoveling
  white ore.</p>

  <p>The young naval lieutenant, whose alert, snapping, black eyes missed very
  little, saw my punishment and forgot, for a moment, to watch his globe.
  During that moment I saw his Tek topple from the platform on which it was
  working and fall into the pit.</p>

  <p>With an angry roar the overseer seared the lieutenant's back.</p>

  <p>"Dolt!" he thundered. "Get that Tek up at once, or I'll burn you to a
  crisp."</p>

  <p>What happened after that took place so quickly that it was all over in
  less than a minute.</p>

  <p>With a roar as angry as that of the overseer the peppery young lieutenant
  dropped his electrodes, stood erect, and sprang at the throat of his
  tormenter. So quick and unexpected was the attack that he was almost upon the
  astonished overseer before the latter realized what had happened.</p>

  <p>Snatching his paralyzing ray cylinder from his belt, the Snal pointed it
  at the lieutenant, freezing him in his tracks. Then he stepped back and with
  a fiendish grin at his helpless victim thrust the red hot point through the
  brave lad's heart. Withdrawing it deliberately, he shut off the paralyzing
  ray, permitting the body to slump to the floor.</p>

  <p>This exhibition of cruelty so filled me with rage and revulsion that I was
  tempted to hurl my globe at the Snal's head, and follow the throw with an
  attack. But the thought of Dolores deterred me. She would be waiting for
  me&mdash;expecting me to meet and help her.</p>

  <p>Another slave was thrust into the lieutenant's place, and his body was
  carried out by two Teks.</p>

  <p>"Take heed, slaves, from the death of your fellow," said the overseer,
  "and rebel not against authority lest you share his fate."</p>

  <p>Dolores met me at the beginning of the rest period, and we went together
  for our food and water, then sat down on the stone floor to eat.</p>

  <p>Before we had finished eating, a number of Teks came in, bearing the
  sections of a huge metal screen, which they welded smoothly together and set
  up in the middle of the floor. Several Snals came a short time thereafter,
  and connected it with a complicated-appearing machine, while the slaves
  flocked curiously around.</p>

  <p>When their work was finished, a life size image appeared on the screen. It
  was Zet, ruler of the nether world, his emerald diadem sparkling above his
  slimy features.</p>

  <p>He began to speak and every voice was hushed. To me, he seemed to be
  speaking English. Dolores told me afterward that she thought he was speaking
  Spanish. And a Misskito Indian I later interrogated was positive the great
  "Glass Face" had spoken his native dialect.</p>

  <p>Zet told us that the screen had been installed for our entertainment and
  information, and that, through it, he would keep us constantly posted on the
  progress of his conquest of the world. We would thus be made to realize, he
  said, how hopeless it would be for us to rebel against the fate which nature
  had intended for us&mdash;that of serving the Snals, who were as superior to
  us as we were to the beasts we had domesticated. He ended by promising that
  those of us who served faithfully and well would be rewarded later, when his
  empire was established, by easier work and positions of power among our
  fellows.</p>

  <p>Zet's image faded from the screen. It was followed by that of another
  Snal&mdash;a short, stocky individual, whose ornaments were richly powdered
  with jewels.</p>

  <p>"I am the Voice," he said. " I speak for Zet, Lord of the Inner and Outer
  Worlds. Behold the progress of his conquests."</p>

  <p>THE image faded and a large map of the Americas appeared on the
  screen,</p>

  <p>"The portions marked in green are under the dominion of Zet," said the
  Voice. "He moves slowly but surely, taking what he wants when he wants
  it."</p>

  <p>From the northern border of Mexico, through Central America, Colombia,
  Ecuador and Venezuela, the map was shaded green! And all this in thirty
  days!</p>

  <p>The map faded, and in its place we were shown moving pictures in full
  color. Managua, rebuilt capital of Nicaragua, was shown first. In the heart
  of the city rose an immense metal dome&mdash;shiny and incongruous, like some
  false growth appearing on the fair body of the earth. We were shown a glimpse
  of an inner room of the great dome. President Monteiro and his staff were
  here, guarded by Teks and bullied by an armored Snal who seemed to be Zet's
  vice-regent of the nation. There were other, flatter domes near the outskirts
  of the city. Beneath these, beds of slime mould had been planted. They were
  being tended by human slaves, and fed both with the bodies of men and
  domestic animals. Just outside this ring was another, in which were taller
  domes like the one we were in&mdash;control buildings in which human slaves
  toiled with their minds, that the Teks might work the will of their Snal
  masters.</p>

  <p>We saw flashes of other capitals, each with its great shining dome
  centrally located, and its encircling rings of metal-covered slime mould beds
  and control buildings. Bogota, Caracas, Quito, Mexico City, San Jose, San
  Salvador and the rest, all were under the yoke of the conquerors.</p>

  <p>Teks rolled about the streets&mdash;swarmed everywhere, searching out
  human victims to be dragged before the conquering Snals, who remained in
  their huge metal buildings or in the flying globes. Tiny Teks no larger than
  pin heads spied on the people unseen. Conspirators against the tyranny were
  thus quickly detected, captured and fed to the plasmodia.</p>

  <p>We were shown the northern battle front, where the United States had
  stretched a huge army from gulf to ocean to protect its territory. It was not
  a battle, but a farce, in which the Teks were sent out at will of the
  controlling Snals, to drag men from the trenches, the tanks, or the decks and
  cabins of aircraft, and whirl them away in the flying globes, against which
  the most powerful weapons of the world were powerless. New weapons were being
  tried&mdash;oxy- acetylene flame-throwers&mdash;that would cut through steel
  plates as if they had been paper&mdash;bombs, loaded both with nitric and
  sulphuric acids, in the hope that these might prevail against the obstinate
  metal. But they had no more effect on it than water has on glass.</p>

  <p>Some of these things we saw. Some were told to us by the Voice. But I do
  not think there was a man or woman in the building who was not convinced of
  the truth of all of them, and the utter hopelessness of our situation. Man's
  knell of doom had sounded. His place in the sun was being slowly but surely
  wrested from him by these slimy intelligences of the nether world.</p>

  <p>The South American republics had also extended a great defensive line
  across their continent. But it was even less of an obstruction to the
  conquerors than that of the United States.</p>

  <p>After each work and sleep period, Dolores and I met at the same spot. We
  would eat our block porridge together, then go and stand in front of the
  screen to learn the latest news of the earth's conquest.</p>

  <p>In another thirty days the southern half of the United States and more
  than half of South America were under the sway of the Snals. The opposing
  armies had been completely routed, and most of their field equipment
  destroyed. Our screen was tuned in with exploring globes flying over the
  areas as yet unconquered. And they showed people fleeing northward in every
  means of conveyance at their disposal. Canada swarmed with refugees. Air- and
  water-liners loaded to capacity were leaving for Europe, Africa and Asia. And
  the advance of the metal menace continued steadily, relentlessly.</p>

  <p>Dolores came to mean much to me&mdash;more than the whole world. I had
  never told her, had not more than touched her hand. But she could do more
  with her eyes than can most girls with arms and lips.</p>

  <p>It was because of the hopelessness of our situation that I did not speak
  to her of love or marriage. I suspected, however, that she knew of my love,
  and dared to hope that she returned it.</p>

  <p>I always looked forward to my meetings with her as the only bright spots
  in this career of mental drudgery. Like those of the other slaves, my brain
  was being turned into a machine to work the will of the Snals. And it might
  have become as dulled and listless as did the others had it not been for her
  bright companionship.</p>

  <p>During those first two months the Snal overseers began to select women
  from among the slaves to share their quarters with them. Each overseer had a
  private apartment, jutting out from the outer wall of the building at its
  base. These apartments were set at intervals, clear around the building, and
  where their round doors were placed, no sleeping cylinders were piled. Some
  went fearfully, under the threat of the red hot torture rods. But many
  preferred to die in agony.</p>

  <p>A number of overseers had asked for Dolores&mdash;my own, a tall fellow
  named Lak, among them. But the head overseer had his orders. She was to be
  saved for Zet until such time as the ruler should send for her, unless- Every
  overseer knew that she had been commanded to keep this secret from the other
  slaves&mdash;that if she disobeyed, death would be the penalty. And each
  overseer combined in his person, the powers of judge, jury and
  executioner.</p>

  <p>Many times I noticed Lak watching us furtively when we were together. Once
  I turned, and saw him standing close behind us as we watched the news screen.
  But even then, I did not guess his purpose.</p>

  <p>It was, when I had computed that about two months of earth time had
  passed, that I eagerly sought our rendezvous after a work period, but Dolores
  was not there. I waited more than ten minutes, but she did not put in an
  appearance. Then I noticed a Misskito Indian, seated nearby licking his
  porridge&mdash;smudged fingers and eyeing me significantly.</p>

  <p>"You look for white señorita?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Have you seen her?"</p>

  <p>"In there," was the laconic answer. He pointed with his porridge-smeared
  thumb to the door of Lak's apartment</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; THE SUBTERRANEAN JUNGLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I LOOKED cautiously about me. None of the Snals seemed to be
  watching my movements. Endeavoring to appear unconcerned, I walked slowly
  toward the door of Lak's apartment. It took less than a minute to reach the
  edge of the pile of sleeping cylinders. Again I glanced slowly around. So far
  as I could see, neither Snal nor slave was paying any attention to my
  movements.</p>

  <p>Dodging into the passageway between the piles of cylinders, I tiptoed to
  the door. It was closed, but gave when I tried the fastening. I opened it
  cautiously for a little way, Lak was standing with his back to me, holding
  Dolores by her shoulders. Neither could see me.</p>

  <p>Entering soundlessly, I closed the door.</p>

  <p>Lak was saying:</p>

  <p>"You have earned death, slave-girl, but I can save you. Only I heard you
  tell the secret of Zet to the slave-man. You must make your choice
  now&mdash;your life or the love of Lak."</p>

  <p>I had heard more than enough. With a single bound, I stood beside them.
  Seizing the armored shoulder of the Snal, I spun him half around.</p>

  <p>His burning rod stood in a rack, but his chopper and paralyzing ray
  cylinder still hung from his belt. With a grunt of surprise and anger, he
  grabbed for the latter. But his visor was up and I swung for his face.</p>

  <p>The result was astounding&mdash;and sickening. My arm was buried, half way
  up to my elbow in his great round head. My fist had crashed through his nose
  and the frontal bones of his face, clear into his, huge, mushy brain.</p>

  <p>With a feeling of intense disgust, I withdrew my arm, and the metal-clad
  body clanked to the floor. As best I could, I cleaned the slime from my arm
  with a coverlet dragged from Lak's luxurious sleeping cylinder.</p>

  <p>Dolores, who had bravely faced her persecutor to the end, now collapsed,
  with her face in her hands, and began weeping softly. I was about to try to
  comfort her, when I noticed something sputtering on the floor at her feet.
  Puzzled, I bent forward to investigate. A great tear trickled down between
  her fingers&mdash;fell to the metal floor. And where it struck, the
  sputtering commenced anew, while beneath it a patch of white crystals was
  forming.</p>

  <p>The floor, unlike that of the main building, was made of the white metal
  that had defied shells, solid shot, oxy-acetylene flames and two of the
  strongest acids known to man, yet here it was, changing to a white powder
  beneath a woman's tears. After each tear drop fell the sputtering soon
  ceased. But the white spots spread with amazing rapidity. Presently, several
  of them ran together, then collapsed, revealing the wild thallophytic growths
  of subterranean jungle about ten feet below the floor. The hole widened
  rapidly, the metal flaking away in white crystals. It undermined the body of
  Lak, and it fell into the undergrowth while Dolores and I looked on
  amazed.</p>

  <p>"A way out!" I exclaimed. "Come on!"</p>

  <p>After dropping Lak's burning rod, I swung down on the edge of the still-
  widening orifice, and let go, alighting in the muck among the soft growths,
  with scarcely a perceptible jar.</p>

  <p>Dolores bravely followed, and I caught her in my arms.</p>

  <p>I stripped off the overseer's belt, which contained his paralyzing ray
  cylinder and chopper. When I had it strapped around my waist, I caught up the
  burning rod, and we hurried away through the grotesque fungoid growths.</p>

  <p>A few steps took us out from beneath the building, which stood on metal
  stilts set into the soggy soil. As we emerged under the luminous dome of this
  strange underground world, the light grew much stronger and the vegetation
  taller.</p>

  <p>Soon we were hurrying through a forest of thick slimy trunks, some of them
  eight to ten feet in diameter at the base and fifty to sixty feet in
  height&mdash;the stems of colossal mushrooms. Often we found our way blocked
  by these immense fungoids which had crashed to the ground, and for the
  remains of which, lichens and slime moulds of many varieties contended. Giant
  mosses of endless shapes and hues formed most of the undergrowth, and algae
  dominated the thousands of stagnant pools. From time to time the immense,
  umbrella-shaped caps overhead opened their gills to discharge millions of
  spores that glittered in the queer phosphorescent light as they swirled
  downward to settle over the weird landscape.</p>

  <p>The animal, as well as the vegetable kingdom, was represented in variety
  and profusion. The lower orders dominated in size as well as in numbers. Fat,
  gray slugs, three feet and more in length, fed on the juices of the various
  plants about us. Snails of infinite variety and immense size left their slimy
  trails everywhere. I recognized glass snails, amber snails, agate snails, and
  most striking of all, great rams-horn snails as tall as camels.</p>

  <p>Insect monstrosities buzzed busily about, or scampered over the moss. An
  immense thousand-legged worm, fully twenty feet in length, startled us as it
  crossed our path. A huge green beetle as large as a Shetland pony charged us
  with its huge four-foot mandibles distended, but backed up and hastily
  scampered away at a touch from my searing rod. A mosquito, as large as a
  crane, buzzed about us for some time, until I killed it with a lucky thrust
  through the head.</p>

  <p>The air was heavy with the musty odors of the fungoid growths, the
  sickening charnel scent of the slimy creatures that lived in their moist
  depths, and the reek of decaying organic matter.</p>

  <p>Stumbling, slipping, sliding, sometimes sinking knee-deep in clinging muck
  or splashing through water above our waists, we pressed onward, our sole
  desire being to put as much distance as possible between ourselves and the
  slave quarters.</p>

  <p>As we hurried along I pondered much on the miracle that had wrought our
  deliverance from the apartment of Lak. What could there be, I wondered, in
  this woman's tears, that had destroyed a metal which had defied projectiles,
  explosives, heat, and powerful acids? In this solution of this mystery lay
  the key to the door of knowledge which, if once opened, would deliver the
  world from bondage.</p>

  <p>And why, I wondered further, had this miracle not been wrought before?
  Surely many of the captured woman and children had dropped tears in the metal
  globes, on the metal vehicles in which they had been hauled, and on the
  tentacle-like arms of their captors. Then I recalled that the room in the
  globe that had brought me in, a prisoner, was of brown metal, as were the
  bodies of the vehicles in which we had been carried, and the highways over
  which we had traveled. The arms of the Teks, although of white metal, were of
  a duller cast than the globes and heads, as were the tables, globes and
  electrodes in the control room. The floor of the building, except in the
  private apartments of the overseers which jutted out over the jungle, were of
  stone.</p>

  <p>But all this did not explain the enigma.</p>

  <p>After five hours of wearisome travel, we were glad to stop and sit down on
  the moss for a breathing spell. I took a drink of water from my flask. It was
  nearly half full. I shuddered at the thought of having to drink the foul,
  stagnant water we had encountered. Dolores also drank some water and replaced
  her flask in her apron pocket.</p>

  <p>"I'm hungry," she announced. "Do you suppose any of these plants are
  edible?"</p>

  <p>"No doubt," I replied, "and it's equally probable that some of them are so
  poisonous that a mouthful or two would prove fatal. The question is, which
  are poisonous and which are edible. We have no way of knowing."</p>

  <p>"Then what are we to do?"</p>

  <p>"We may run across some of the varieties of slime moulds that the Snals
  cultivate for food," I replied. "Their spores are good to eat. And in the
  palace gardens I saw some gigantic morels. I think we would be safe in using
  these for food if we could find any. In the outer world the morel is the one
  mushroom form that is never poisonous."</p>

  <p>"In that case," she said, "let us look for morels."</p>

  <p>Rested by our brief pause, we resumed our journey. Presently the character
  of the vegetation changed as we came out of the marshy country to higher and
  drier ground. The moss was replaced by short, white snake grass. And huge,
  jointed reeds began to take the place of the tall mushrooms.</p>

  <p>We had not gone far when we came to a group of large mounds uniformly
  about fifty feet in diameter and twenty feet high.</p>

  <p>"I'm going up and have a look around," said Dolores, and suited her action
  to her words by scampering up the side of the mound. She had not taken more
  than five steps when one foot broke through into a compartment underneath.
  She withdrew it with a scream of pain, and came running toward me, her knee
  bleeding. Then a white thing about eighteen inches in height, popped out
  after her and pursued her on six rapidly moving legs. Behind it came another
  and another, and I recognized them for what they were&mdash;giant termite as
  large as pet bulldogs and ten times as dangerous.</p>

  <p>I ran toward her, my burning rod ready for action, but before I reached
  her a veritable army of the formidable creatures came rushing toward us from
  around both sides of the mound, their great hooked mandibles snapping
  menacingly.</p>

  <p>"No use to argue with those things," I shouted. "We wouldn't have a
  Chinaman's chance. Can you run?"</p>

  <p>"And how!" she replied, passing me like a bullet.</p>

  <p>I was not slow to follow, but I soon saw that we were being outstripped by
  the swift, six-legged creatures behind us, and that it would only be a matter
  of a few moments before we would be pulled down and torn to pieces.</p>

  <p>"Climb something," I cried. "It will be our only chance to hold them
  off."</p>

  <p>Dolores leaped for the nearest jointed stalk, and scrambled up, I at her
  heels, just as the foremost termites came snapping up behind us.</p>

  <p>I thrust the point of my burning rod into the open mouth of the leader,
  and sent it tumbling back on those behind it. Then an astounding thing
  happened. There was a roar overhead as if a dozen helicopter blades had
  suddenly gone into action, and the stalk to which we were clinging left the
  ground with amazing rapidity.</p>

  <p>I glanced upward and saw the reason. Instead of a scaly plant stalk, we
  were clinging to the slender, segmented body of an immense insect! And
  already we were so high above the ground that to let go would mean certain
  death!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; MONSTERS OF THE NETHER WORLD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE huge insect to which we were clinging flew off with
  incredible speed. Its immense wings, which when quiescent I had taken for the
  spatulate leaves of a strange subterranean plant, whirred so rapidly that
  they were invisible. The creature itself greatly resembled a titanic dragon
  fly, with its massive head, great bulging eyes, and long, relatively slender
  body. It flew at an elevation of about a thousand feet, and watching the
  ground, I calculated that it was carrying us at a speed of over a hundred
  miles an hour.</p>

  <p>Clinging to the rim of the huge segment with one hand, and gripping the
  round body with both legs, I watched the rapidly changing landscape beneath
  us. Presently, all signs of vegetation ceased, and we were flying over a
  barren, gleaming white area of dunes and hollows.</p>

  <p>On the next segment in front, Dolores was clinging tightly with hands and
  arms, and I noticed that she, too, was anxiously watching the landscape
  below. I shouted to her, but she could not hear me because of the whirring of
  the huge wings. And I could not creep nearer to her without danger of losing
  my grip on our living aircraft and pitching to sudden death below.</p>

  <p>So occupied was I in watching the landscape beneath that I did not notice
  the immense black thing, flashing downward at us from above, until it struck.
  Huge teeth sunk into the thorax of the giant dragon fly, just back of the
  head. Its wings quivered, then hung limply. It was a swift, clean kill. We
  were borne swiftly aloft in a steep spiral and I had an opportunity to
  observe the thing that was carrying us. It was an immense, black-skinned
  hairless bat. The body of the insect trailed almost vertically, making it
  much more difficult to hang on than when it had been flying horizontally. It
  appeared that the giant bat had not even noticed us, taking us for part of
  its victim's body.</p>

  <p>As we spiraled higher and higher, the light grew stronger above us, while
  the outlines of the ground below became more and more blurred and
  indistinct.</p>

  <p>Up and up we went through the drifting, diaphanous mists until we were
  just under the luminous dome of this weird nether world, fully five miles
  above the ground. My eyes were dazzled by the brightness of the rugged,
  luminous, and probably radioactive stone that formed the vault.</p>

  <p>The bat hovered for a moment beneath a huge jagged opening in the dome. As
  it did so I saw that there were a number of similar openings nearby. Then it
  flew upward and to one side, alighting in a self-illuminated cave about a
  hundred feet square.</p>

  <p>I wondered why the monster had not devoured its victim on the wing as
  outer world bats habitually do, but I realized the reason when two of its
  offspring, which had been hanging upside down from a ledge at the back of the
  cave, fluttered to the floor and rushed toward the parent, screeching and
  flapping excitedly.</p>

  <p>The adult bat laid the insect on the floor with us still clinging to it,
  then turned and dived back through the opening.</p>

  <p>Judging by the size of the parent, the two youngsters that were rushing
  toward us were about a quarter grown. But this did not prevent them from
  being exceedingly formidable antagonists, for each stood more than ten feet
  in height, and was armed with long sharp teeth as well as wicked looking
  claws on wing joints and hind feet. Dolores and I both sprang to our feet and
  backed away as they pounced on the insect and began feeding voraciously, as
  if each feared that it would get less than the other would.</p>

  <p>My first impulse was to look for some way of escape while the two immense
  youngsters were occupied with their feast. Bidding Dolores secrete herself
  behind one of the boulders that cluttered the floor, I made a careful search,
  circling behind the young bats and returning in front of them. They watched
  me with their black, beady eyes, but evidently did not think me quite as
  tempting a morsel as the insect.</p>

  <p>Having assured myself that there was no way out of the cave except that by
  which we had come, I returned to the boulder with the beady eyes of the bats
  still following me as they finished the remains of the ill-fated dragon
  fly.</p>

  <p>Our situation appeared utterly hopeless. There we were, five miles above
  the surface of the nether world, and we knew not how many uncounted miles
  below the surface of the earth, imprisoned with two hungry beasts larger and
  more formidable than the greatest of the outer world carnivora. Moreover, we
  might expect at any moment, the arrival of one or both of the
  parents&mdash;creatures four times as large as the ones we now faced.</p>

  <p>There seemed little question but that the young bats would attack us, and
  that was quickly resolved, for as soon as they had finished their feast and
  licked their chops for a moment, they came hopping and flapping toward
  us.</p>

  <p>With Lak's paralyzing ray cylinder in my left hand, and his burning rod in
  my right, I leaped up on the boulder, behind which Dolores crouched.</p>

  <p>As soon as they were within striking distance, both of them reached out to
  seize me, whereupon I held the one on my left with the paralyzing ray and
  lunged at the other with the burning rod. I struck for the eye, but the beast
  dodged and the point seared itself into the hunched shoulder, instead.</p>

  <p>With a siren-like shriek of rage and pain the burned creature jerked back
  out of reach of the point, toppled on the edge of the entrance for a moment,
  and then fell, squawking and fluttering, down the steep shaft. As it had not
  learned to fly, it was undoubtedly dashed to pieces on the ground five miles
  below. At any rate, I did not see it again.</p>

  <p>The other young bat, held by the powerful paralyzing ray, stood helplessly
  while I plunged the point of the burning rod into its heart. Then, as I
  withdrew the rod and shut off the ray, a shudder ran through its frame and it
  toppled over on its back, dead.</p>

  <p>ALTHOUGH we had vanquished our immediate enemies, we were a long way from
  being out of our predicament.</p>

  <p>Dolores came out from behind the boulder, and together we examined the
  fallen monster.</p>

  <p>Presently she said:</p>

  <p>"Tell me the truth, Wallace. Is there no way out? No hope of escape?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Then we are to die here together. It doesn't matter how. We'll be slain
  by the mother bat when she returns, or perhaps by her mate. Even if you
  conquer both monsters with the weapons of Lak, we're trapped here to die of
  hunger and thirst. In one case it will be a matter of a few hours, the other
  a few days. Am I not right?"</p>

  <p>"It looks that way," I replied, kicking absently at the tip of one of the
  webbed wings, my head turned away to hide my feelings.</p>

  <p>"Wallace! Look at me!"</p>

  <p>I turned, and she came up very close, her glorious face upturned to
  mine.</p>

  <p>"Wallace, isn't there something you would like to say to me before
  we&mdash;are taken by death?"</p>

  <p>There was that in her eyes which sent the hot blood coursing through my
  veins, and made me forget the peril in which we stood. The burning rod
  clattered to the floor of the cave as I crushed her to me&mdash;claimed her
  sweet lips.</p>

  <p>"But, Wallace. You have said nothing," she panted.</p>

  <p>"I can't make you pretty speeches," I replied, "nor can I croon sweet love
  songs. But I love you, Dolores. You know that now."</p>

  <p>"I have known it all along," she confessed, "but I wanted to hear you say
  it. Dios, how I love you, my big American! And we are to die so soon."</p>

  <p>Her arms went around my neck&mdash;clung there, and she buried her face in
  my shoulder, weeping softly.</p>

  <p>Desperately I looked about me. There must be a way out. I must think. I
  must plan.</p>

  <p>Suddenly an idea came to me.</p>

  <p>"Don't cry, dear," I said. "I think I've hit on a plan."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked eagerly,</p>

  <p>"There is enough material in the webbed wing of that young bat to make a
  parachute that will carry us both to the ground," I said, "and I'm going to
  try to make one."</p>

  <p>"I'll help you," she replied. "Let's work fast. The mother bat may come
  back at any moment."</p>

  <p>Using Lak's keen, two-edged chopper, I quickly severed the immense wings
  from the body. In the webs there was material enough for our purpose, and to
  spare. I cut a number of long strips to serve as rope, and with these,
  Dolores stitched the larger pieces together, punching the holes with the tip
  of the burning rod.</p>

  <p>When I had exhausted the supply of web which we could spare for this
  purpose, I skinned the immense carcass, and cut the hide into strips two
  inches in width. I fastened the ends of these around the edge of the
  parachute, while Dolores finished her job of fastening the larger pieces
  together.</p>

  <p>This work completed I drew all of our guy straps together, and tied them
  to a ring-strap, cut trebly wide that it might stand the extra strain. To
  this I added a strong loop on each side, forming a swing seat for each of us,
  and we stepped back to view the result of our labor.</p>

  <p>It appeared exceeding crude and awkward, but it would be strong
  enough.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready to make the jump?" I asked.</p>

  <p>I slipped the loop of her swing strap around her, cautioning her to hold
  on with both hands.</p>

  <p>"We'll drag the whole thing clear up to the edge," I said, "then jump out
  away from the ledge as far as possible. Otherwise the 'chute may catch on the
  edge and swing us back against the face of the rock."</p>

  <p>Luck had favored us thus far by the prolonged absence of the mother bat,
  and I wondered, as I arranged the folds of the 'chute on the rim of the abyss
  if it would fail us now.</p>

  <p>For a moment I strained Dolores to me in a farewell kiss. Then I caught up
  the burning rod, and with a: "one, two, three!" we leaped.</p>

  <p>For several seconds we hurtled downward at a breathtaking speed. The walls
  of the shaft vanished, and we were shooting down through the mists of the
  nether world sky, our speed unslackened. "It hasn't opened," I thought.
  "We're doomed." But even as this thought came to me, the guy straps suddenly
  tightened with a jerk. One of them snapped and fell down, trailing its wet
  inner surface over my shoulder. Our speed slackened. A few seconds more, and
  we were gliding smoothly downward. The immense web that had been designed to
  support the huge body of the bat in flight easily sustained us.</p>

  <p>A CRY of exultation came to my lips, but it quickly changed to an
  exclamation of horror as I suddenly saw, flapping toward us, the immense
  black bulk of the mother bat. She was carrying a huge beetle in her mouth,
  but dropped it as she came closer and scented the hide of her dead offspring.
  With a horrible shriek, more powerful and ear-splitting than the sound of a
  steam siren, she dived straight at us, her immense maw gaping, her lips drawn
  back in a hideous snarl that revealed her big, ugly teeth.</p>

  <p>I whipped the paralyzing ray cylinder from my belt, and gripped both it
  and the strap at my left with my left hand, while I couched the burning rod
  beneath my right arm. I had my misgivings as to whether or not the rays would
  have any effect on so huge a bulk, but it was our only hope.</p>

  <p>To my surprise and relief, it worked. The giant bat, unable to move her
  wings, turned over and began hurtling groundward in a nose dive. But she had
  not fallen far before the rays ceased to affect her, whereupon she righted
  herself and came back at us.</p>

  <p>Again I turned the rays on her and again she plunged downward, only to
  right herself and come back as fiercely as ever. She repeated the process
  persistently, and to my horror I noticed that she was able to get a little
  closer each time. The battery was growing weaker.</p>

  <p>Presently she came so close that I thrust the burning rod into her mouth.
  With a snarl, she clamped her huge teeth down on it, snapping the metal shaft
  as if it had been matchwood. She opened her mouth once more and shook her
  head, attempting to dislodge the searing point, but it had already passed her
  throat, and was burning its way down into her vitals.</p>

  <p>With a horrid, gurgling scream, she went into her last nose dive, falling
  like a plummet. I saw her strike the ground several seconds later, but we
  were drifting in an air current that had, in the meantime, carried us some
  distance to one side. I noticed for the first time that we were above a huge
  expanse of glistening, barren white dunes. A short time thereafter we
  alighted, sinking to our ankles in a substance which I readily
  recognized&mdash;the white crystals which my Tek had been loading these many
  days, to be hauled to the smelter. It was the material from which the Snals
  manufactured their miraculously hard metal.</p>

  <p>Disentangling ourselves from our straps, we set out over the rolling
  dunes. As all directions were alike to us, we set our faces toward what
  looked like a rugged mountain range, some of the jagged peaks of which
  pierced the clouds. Our water supply had dwindled to a swallow apiece. And we
  were ravenously hungry.</p>

  <p>For hour after hour, we plunged onward, through the weird light of the
  changeless day. We stopped once, exhausted, and slept for twelve hours by my
  chronometer. Upon awakening, we drained our water flasks, and pressed forward
  once more. But so great was the distance of these mountains, which at first
  had only seemed a few miles away, that they appeared to recede as we advanced
  toward them.</p>

  <p>Another four hours of walking, however, made the outlines of the mountains
  bulk much nearer. And where there are mountains, there are usually springs or
  streams. After a brief rest, we set forth once more. But it was not long
  before Dolores staggered and fell. I tried to pick her up, and fell beside
  her. My strength was fast waning. I tried to murmur a few words of
  encouragement to her, but my lips were dry&mdash;my tongue so swollen that
  they sounded like the muttering of a drunken man. It did not matter, however,
  as she had swooned away.</p>

  <p>After a brief breathing spell, I arose, and taking Dolores in my arms,
  proceeded, carefully conserving my strength and pausing at short intervals to
  rest.</p>

  <p>We were less than a mile from the nearest mountain when Dolores regained
  consciousness. She immediately insisted that I set her on her feet. I did so,
  and found that, after her rest she could make better progress than I.</p>

  <p>I was floundering along, so exhausted that I staggered as if intoxicated,
  when suddenly she clutched my arm.</p>

  <p>"Look!" she cried. "Water, just ahead!"</p>

  <p>Together we stumbled out of the loose sands of the white desert to a flat
  formation of lava rock. About half way between us and the mountain we had
  made our objective, a small circular pool of water gleamed in the weird
  light.</p>

  <p>The sight renewed my strength, yet it seemed ages before we reached the
  side of the sparkling pool.</p>

  <p>"Take it easy," I cautioned. "Bathe your face first, and sip slowly."</p>

  <p>We threw ourselves flat at the-edge of the pool. I bathed my parched face,
  then sipped up a few drops from the hollow of my hand. But scarcely had the
  liquid entered my mouth than I spat it out in dismay. It was loaded with
  salt. Glancing at Dolores, I saw that she had made the same disappointing
  discovery.</p>

  <p>I sat up wearily&mdash;despondently&mdash;and she crept over to me,
  resting her head against my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"What a dreadful disappointment," she said.</p>

  <p>Suddenly I heard a familiar clanking sound behind me. Glancing back, I saw
  a flying globe which had descended, not fifty feet from us. The clanking
  sound was caused by the long, segmented cable it had dropped. Down this cable
  swarmed a score of Teks. Then they spread out in a wide semicircle and ran
  toward us. There was no mistaking their purpose. And no question but what, if
  we were captured, Zet would impose the death penalty on both. It would be as
  well to die fighting.</p>

  <p>I stood up, and with Lak's chopper in my hand, awaited the attack.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; THE ESCAPE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS I stood in front of the briny pool, defiantly shaking the
  chopper of Lak at the advancing Teks, an idea came to me&mdash;an idea born
  of a theory which I had been pondering since the tears of Dolores
  miraculously opened our way to escape from the slave quarters.</p>

  <p>Our metal enemies were almost upon us when I bent and, with my arm about
  her waist, helped Dolores up.</p>

  <p>"Come," I whispered. "Into the water."</p>

  <p>We turned and ran, splashing through the heavy brine. A few steps, and it
  reached our waists. The Teks splashed in after us. The circle was closing in
  at both ends. Suddenly their metal torsos began to sputter and pop, flaking
  away in a white powder wherever the brine had spattered.</p>

  <p>"Splash them," I told Dolores, and used the flat of the chopper to deluge
  those nearest me. She bravely-splashed those on her side. Presently a Tek
  stumbled&mdash;sank beneath the surface. Above the spot the water effervesced
  like champagne. Another sank&mdash;a third. Two that had only been slightly
  splashed tried to make the shore. I followed them, deluging them with brine.
  They sank down, sputtering and melting away in the shallows.</p>

  <p>In less than five minutes the twenty Teks were a semicircle of wreckage,
  consisting mostly of neck, arm and leg tentacles, covered with masses of
  fluffy white crystals.</p>

  <p>Dolores and I climbed up on the bank. Despite our thirst and weariness we
  felt refreshed by our salt-water plunge.</p>

  <p>"If I could only fly that globe," I said, "we might still have a chance to
  get away."</p>

  <p>"Why, I can do that," she said. "For the past forty work-periods I have
  controlled a Tek flying a freighter, which carried liquid metal from a
  smelter to a factory."</p>

  <p>"Suppose there are more Teks aboard," I said.</p>

  <p>"Not likely," she replied. "A crew always consists of twenty. The pilot
  could lock the controls and land with the rest."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll take a chance, but with a little preliminary preparedness," I
  said. "Let me have your flask."</p>

  <p>She handed me her glass flask, and I filled both hers and mine with salt
  water. Pocketing one, and carrying the other in my hand, I walked up beneath
  the globe. The cable did not, as I expected, whip around my waist. "I guess
  you were right, after all," I said. "Come on." She came up beside me, but
  scarcely had she done so ere the cable swiftly wrapped around both of us,
  jerking us up through the round door. It put us down upon a floor of brown
  metal in front of a Tek that had one tentacle on the control board.</p>

  <p>"So, small-brained ones, you thought to escape me!" The voice issued from
  the metal mouth, but I recognized it instantly. - It was the voice of Zet,
  emperor of the nether world.</p>

  <p>"We came near doing it, Zet," I replied. "For small-brained ones we didn't
  do so badly."</p>

  <p>"Ha! Ha! Ha! What foolish bunglers you are, to be sure. To pit your puny
  intellects against mine. Ho! Ho! Ho! But I must bring you before me. I would
  pass judgment in person."</p>

  <p>The tentacle of the Tek jerked a lever and the door clanged shut behind
  us. Our waists were still gripped by the huge tentacle, but I could move my
  arms freely. Suddenly uncorking the flask I held in my hand, I splashed brine
  on the spherical body in front of me and on the round head. Some of it ran
  down the head-hole into the mechanism.</p>

  <p>Globe and head began sputtering furiously&mdash;flaking away as white
  powder.</p>

  <p>"Fool!" said the metal mouth in the voice of Zet. "I pass judgment
  now!"</p>

  <p>The arm tentacle jerked a lever, and the huge cable that encircled us,
  slowly tightened its folds, squeezing the breath out of us. Drawing the
  chopper from my belt, I struck at the tentacle that clung to the lever. It
  sagged, but hung on. Again I struck, exerting all my strength, and the blade
  severed it. Not being of the hard, white metal, it was vulnerable.</p>

  <p>With a corner of the blade I struck up the lever. The coils of the cables
  instantly loosed us. The Tek attempted to swing around&mdash;to use the other
  arm tentacle. But it was too far gone. It staggered and fell to the floor
  with a shower of white powder.</p>

  <p>Dolores sprang to the control board. She pressed a lever, and the globe
  lurched violently as it sprang upward. She moved another lever, and we
  settled down to a straight course.</p>

  <p>Above the controls two round lights hung on head-straps. Dolores took them
  down, handed one to me, and strapped the other around her head.</p>

  <p>"If you will put that on," she said, "you can look out through any part of
  the globe with it. The invisible rays are turned on or off simply by raising
  your eyebrows."</p>

  <p>I strapped on my light and found that it worked as she had said.</p>

  <p>"Funny they left these things hanging here," I said "when the Teks have
  them already built into their heads."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes the Snals fly these globes in person," she replied. "They are
  kept here for that purpose."</p>

  <p>I raised my eyebrows and my light clicked on. The rays which emanated from
  it must have been effective only for a short distance, for, though they made
  the globe appear transparent, everything beyond it looked perfectly natural.
  Looking downward through the floor, I saw that we were above a jungle of
  primordial growths. I was gazing at the queer plants and beasts beneath us,
  when Dolores suddenly cried:</p>

  <p>"A globe pursues us! We are discovered!"</p>

  <p>"Slow up and let it come close to us," I said. "Then open the door."</p>

  <p>I had corked, and was holding Dolores' flask, still half full of brine.
  The other globe shot swiftly up behind us.</p>

  <p>I lurched over to the door and grasped the rail beside it, holding the
  flask poised in my other hand.</p>

  <p>"All right," I shouted.</p>

  <p>The door swung open. The other globe was now less than fifty feet from us.
  I hurled the flask and had the satisfaction of seeing it break against the
  pursuing globe, scattering its contents over the gleaming surface.</p>

  <p>The door clanged shut, but I continued to watch the pursuing globe by
  means of my penetrating head light. A sputtering white patch instantly
  appeared where the brine had struck. Soon this was replaced by a gaping hole
  with rapidly widening white edges, from which fluffy crystals were
  flaking.</p>

  <p>Dolores accelerated our speed and shot upward. The other globe attempted
  to follow, but it was rapidly losing power. Soon more than half of its
  surface had disappeared, exposing its mechanism and inner room, swarming with
  Teks. Another moment, and it hurtled groundward, burying itself in the soft
  muck of the swamp.</p>

  <p>DOLORES straightened our course once more Ahead of us lay the metal city
  to which we had first been brought&mdash;the capital of the nether world. And
  about five miles to our right was a great cone of lava nearly two miles high.
  Above this cone was the gleaming mouth of a metal shaft which thousands of
  globes were constantly entering and leaving.</p>

  <p>"Steer for the shaft," I said. "Perhaps we can bluff our way through to
  the outer world. They can't tell who is in this globe, can they?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless they use the penetrating rays," she replied, "and they can
  only do that at close range. I don't think we can make our way through.
  However, Zet will expect us to try, and will be prepared."</p>

  <p>"Then we'll try another way," I said.</p>

  <p>A moment later we plunged into the shaft&mdash;shot swiftly upward. The
  speed of the globe was terrific. I had no means of computing it. And because
  of this, I had no idea how many miles of shaft we had traversed when we
  suddenly shot up beneath the huge metal dome that covered Coseguina.</p>

  <p>Dolores brought the globe almost to a stop&mdash;hovering uncertainly.</p>

  <p>"Now where?" she asked.</p>

  <p>I recalled my two visions of this dome&mdash;the first when it was in the
  process of building&mdash;the second after it was completed.</p>

  <p>"Not the ports," I said. "They'll surely catch us there. Fly close to the
  wall."</p>

  <p>She instantly brought the globe to within ten feet of the arching
  wall.</p>

  <p>"Open the door."</p>

  <p>As the door flew open I hurled my flask of salt water at the wall. The
  flask shattered, spreading the brine over an area about ten feet in
  diameter.</p>

  <p>Another globe, apparently noting our strange actions, shot upward toward
  us to investigate. Dolores saw it, closed the door, and flew away, circling
  the huge dome. A second globe rose to cut us off. Then a third and a fourth.
  Dolores managed, somehow, to dodge all of them. Soon the dome swarmed with
  flying globes, all of which looked alike. We were darting in and out among
  the others, and I doubt whether more than one or two of their pilots had any
  idea which globe we were in. Several globes collided, bouncing apart like
  billiard balls, but undented and apparently unharmed.</p>

  <p>Twice we flew past the rapidly widening hole in the dome where I had
  hurled the salt water, but each time it was too small for us to squeeze
  through. Then we were herded away from it by the other globes for several
  minutes. By dint of much skillful manipulation on the part of Dolores, we
  managed to get back to it. This time there was room to spare.</p>

  <p>"At last!" I cried, as we shot out into the sunlight which we had not seen
  for more than two months.</p>

  <p>"Beautiful, isn't it?" said Dolores. "Now where shall we go?"</p>

  <p>"Get some altitude," I replied. "Then we'll look around. We must find a
  place to hide, first of all."</p>

  <p>Far out on the Pacific, I saw a rain storm coming.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" I said. "Into that storm!"</p>

  <p>A long trail of globes was after us, and more were continually emerging
  from the dome like a cloud of angry wasps. We plunged toward the storm. In
  less than two minutes we were in it. At least a thousand globes were on our
  trail by that time, but once we got into the thick clouds, they could not see
  us, nor we them. We veered off sharply to the right, traveling at tremendous
  speed. Presently our globe popped out of the clouds into the sunlight once
  more.</p>

  <p>Coseguina had been left at least a hundred miles behind, and we were
  traveling toward the northwest, near the coast of Salvador.</p>

  <p>Looking downward, I suddenly spied beneath the water, the slender, shadowy
  forms of a fleet of submarines&mdash;about twenty in number.</p>

  <p>"If I only had my wrist-radiophone," I said.</p>

  <p>"I managed to keep mine," said Dolores, and reaching into the coils of her
  dark hair, she extracted it and handed it to me. "I thought it might be
  useful in an emergency" she added.</p>

  <p>"It certainly will," I responded, working the call plunger and constantly
  changing the wave lengths, saying each time: "Ahoy, submarine fleet."</p>

  <p>Presently I got a reply. "Who calls the fleet?"</p>

  <p>"Wallace Stuart," I responded, "in the flying globe above you with
  Señorita Monteiro. We just escaped from the Snals."</p>

  <p>"Come closer, and show yourself at the door, Wallace Stuart," was the
  reply.</p>

  <p>Dolores dropped the globe to within a hundred feet of the water. She
  pressed the lever that opened the door, and I leaned out gripping the hand
  rail. Then the submarine just beneath us began to rise. Presently its tower
  emerged from the water. Then up came its turrets, rails and deck. A hatch
  swung open, and two men came out. One wore the uniform of a U. S. naval
  officer. The other was in civilian clothes. To my surprise I recognized my
  former assistant, Pat Higgins.</p>

  <p>"Pat!" I shouted down to him. "What the devil are you doing on the iron
  fish?"</p>

  <p>"Secretary Black ordered me to bring him the Coseguina films in person,"
  he said, "when he heard you were captured. But after I got back I enlisted in
  the naval air service and came down here to do some scrapping. I was lucky
  enough to dodge the globes until yesterday. Then one, bad cess to it, cut me
  down. My pontoons saved me until this ship came along and took me off. So
  here I am. It's sure good to see you alive and well again, chief."</p>

  <p>While he was talking, Dolores had gently lowered our globe until it swung
  just a few feet above the deck. She locked the controls, and came over beside
  me, whereupon both men instantly doffed their hats. I dropped to the deck of
  the submarine and gave her a hand down. Pat introduced me to the officer,
  Rear Admiral Eldridge, in command of the fleet. I introduced the officer to
  Dolores, and we all went below. A few moments later the ship submerged,
  leaving the globe to drift aimlessly a few feet above the surface of the
  Pacific.</p>

  <p>Our first request, as we were ushered into the admiral's cabin, was for
  water. We drank eagerly, but sparingly. Then I told the admiral the amazing
  secret of the supposedly indestructible metal.</p>

  <p>"Salt!" he exclaimed. "Who would have thought it? And here we have had
  millions of tons at our disposal without thinking to try it!"</p>

  <p>"I believe it's really the chlorine that does the trick," I replied. "The
  metal, I know not what to call it, must be an element unknown to our outer
  world chemists. In its natural state it is combined with chlorine, forming a
  white salt. This white salt is mined, with the chlorine removed, leaving the
  basic metal, which is in the form of an impalapable powder. This powder is
  mixed with a liquid preparation, forming a colloidal solution that acts much
  like cement. The liquid evaporates quickly, leaving the solid metal, the
  particles cohering because they have regained the water of crystalization
  lost in the refining process."</p>

  <p>"But what causes the rapid action of the salt on the metal?" asked the
  admiral.</p>

  <p>"The chlorine in the salt," I said, "apparently has a much stronger
  affinity for the strange metal than it has for sodium. As soon as the two
  come in contact in an aqueous solution, the chlorine is torn away from the
  sodium, to unite with the other metal, forming the white crystals which are
  the chloride of the metal, and in which state it is stable in nature. The
  effervescing is caused by the escaping hydrogen displaced by the sodium as it
  unites with the water to form sodium hydroxide. It is plain that but very
  small quantities of of chlorine are necessary for the conversion of large
  areas of metal. It may be, also, that the process, once started, mysteriously
  rejuvenates itself in some way, like the mysterious 'disease' which attacks
  and often destroys old bronzes that have come in contact with saline
  solutions."</p>

  <p>"We'll let the theories go for the present," he replied, "and broadcast
  the news. We'll tell 'em to use salt water, but also to try chlorinated
  water, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, hydrochloric acid&mdash;anything
  they happen to have handy that is a chlorine compound or solution."</p>

  <p>"Have they captured Chicago yet?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"They have every big city in the United States," he replied, "and many of
  the smaller ones. But they haven't taken the radios out of the homes, nor the
  salt. Excuse me while I broadcast. Boy, there's going to be some
  revolution!"</p>

  <p>He went out to the radio room, and a steward brought in two large, juicy
  steaks, to which Dolores and I did full justice during his absence.</p>

  <p>When he returned I submitted a plan which had occurred to me for attacking
  Coseguina. If it worked as I hoped it would, the communication between the
  upper and lower worlds would be severed forever.</p>

  <p>All the rest of that day we were preparing for the attack&mdash;loading
  shells with wet salt and preparing special salt water bombs for the six small
  diving electroplanes which clung to the deck of each submarine. And while we
  made our preparations, we cruised slowly toward our objective.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; THE REVOLT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was dark, and a steady rain was falling when we hove to
  about a mile from Coseguina Point. The huge metal dome above the crater
  gleamed brightly with each recurring flash of lightning. The rest of the time
  it showed merely as an immense, dark bulk, except at rare intervals when its
  lighted ports opened to admit or let out flying globes, speeding on the
  errands of the slimy lord of the nether world.</p>

  <p>The upper works of twenty-four submarines silently emerged from the
  surface of the water. And like a frightened covey of quail there suddenly
  rose from the decks a hundred and forty-four diving electroplanes, their
  props and helicopters whirring.</p>

  <p>There was an interval of four minutes, during which every submarine swung
  broadside, thus presenting simultaneously its front and rear turret guns
  toward the enemy.</p>

  <p>When the four minutes were up the bombardment commenced. At first only the
  flashing of the guns and the bursting of the shells and bombs were visible,
  but soon great holes through which the light escaped began to appear in the
  dome.</p>

  <p>Out of the dome swarmed the globes by thousands. But after a few volleys,
  the fleet again began to submerge. By the time the globes arrived, all were
  safely beneath the surface. The electroplanes, also, were well concealed,
  flying about in the rain clouds, high above the fast-dissolving dome.</p>

  <p>The fleet now lined up with every prow pointed toward a narrow inlet that
  cut into the shore line. Something shot from the prow of the flagship and,
  traveling just beneath the surface, streaked straight for the inlet. It had
  not gone more than a quarter of a mile before a second torpedo from the boat
  next to it shot out with the same objective. The other boats discharged their
  torpedoes, each in turn, keeping them about a quarter of a mile apart.</p>

  <p>Just as the fifth torpedo was launched, the first one struck the shore.
  There was a terrific explosion the shock of which came back through the
  water, jarring our ship tremendously. But when the debris had settled, the
  inlet was deeper by a full eighth of a mile. The second torpedo, following
  the path of the other unswervingly despite the agitation of the water,
  blasted away another eighth of a mile of earth, leaving a great hole into
  which the water rushed. And following these in rapid succession came the
  others, swiftly cutting a huge canal an eighth of a mile in width from the
  Pacific straight through the lava- clad shoulder of the volcano.</p>

  <p>The great dome, meanwhile, was swiftly melting away&mdash;crumbling to
  white powder which was washed down by the rain. And whirling erratically
  about it, like mayflies around a street light, were the mighty fighting
  globes of Zet&mdash;impotent, utterly helpless against this attack by enemies
  they could not see or reach.</p>

  <p>It took forty-five torpedos to blast the canal all the way to the shaft.
  But long before this was accomplished most of the huge metal dome had melted
  away.</p>

  <p>With a swift rush of swirling waters, the mighty Pacific surged into the
  crater&mdash;formed a whirlpool just above the mouth of the shaft.</p>

  <p>The diving electroplanes, no longer concerned about the dome, began
  attacking the globes, using hollow bullets filled with salt water in their
  machine guns. The submarines stuck the muzzles of their anti-aircraft guns up
  out of the water, and at_ each explosion of a well-aimed shell one or more of
  the globes was spattered with thick brine.</p>

  <p>Flying globes, their shells eaten away as if by immense white cankers,
  fell into the water around us by hundreds. A few of them dived into the
  water-filled shaft. Several others hurtled away, to escape in the darkness.
  But most of them were destroyed.</p>

  <p>The battle over, Dolores, Pat and I flew to Managua in one of the diving
  electroplanes. We found that the people had received our radio message and
  had acted promptly. The ring of flat domes that had encircled the city was a
  circle of white ruins. And the immense dome that had arisen in the center of
  the town was a mass of brown metal wreckage covered with white powder and
  strewed with the arm, neck and leg tentacles of defunct Teks.</p>

  <p>Much of this had been accomplished by wet salt, fired from shotguns,
  rifles and pistols and much by hurled bottles filled with brine.</p>

  <p>WE found President Monteiro established in temporary quarters until such
  time as a new capitol building could be constructed. He wept as he embraced
  Dolores and wrung the hands of Pat and me.</p>

  <p>Messages were coming in over the radiovisiphone. Everywhere the Teks,
  globes, domes and equipment were being destroyed by the simple means we had
  discovered, and the Snal overlords were being killed or captured. In New York
  fireboats had sprayed brine on the great dome that dominated Manhattan from
  its place on the Battery. Everywhere globes and Teks had been destroyed with
  brine-filled shells and hollow projectiles filled with wet salt.</p>

  <p>In Chicago the fire department had melted away the huge dome that squatted
  in the center of the Loop, by using chlorinated water. The metal shackles
  were dropping from the world. Millions of human slaves were being set free to
  return to homes and families.</p>

  <p>While we were seated in President Monteiro's office, listening to the
  radiovisiphone announcements, a tall, huge-headed Snal prisoner was brought
  in. He had been riding in a flying globe, shot down by a band of Misskito
  Indians. To my surprise I recognized Hax, chief scientist of the Snals, who
  had been on a tour of inspection.</p>

  <p>"So," he said, eyeing me coolly as I stared at him in surprise, "you
  discovered the secret of the metal. You have done well for a small-brained
  creature."</p>

  <p>"The tears of a woman revealed it to me," I replied. "I don't profess to
  understand the thing now."</p>

  <p>"The power of Zet is destroyed," he said, "nor do I greatly care. I was
  opposed to this conquest from the beginning. Now I am cut off from my world
  forever. I am willing to trade my scientific knowledge for a chance to live
  and continue my experiments."</p>

  <p>"I believe the Associated Governments of the Earth will grant you that,"
  said President Monteiro.</p>

  <p>"I can make you flying globes," said Hax, "that will utilize the terrific
  power of the Earth's magnetic lines of force. I can show you how to construct
  metal servants&mdash;Teks&mdash;that will respond to your thought waves as
  readily as your own bodies. I can make you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I doubt," said the president, dryly, "whether the world will want any of
  these. We'll see."</p>

  <p>"One thing I can't understand," I said, "is why the crater of Coseguina
  cooled so rapidly."</p>

  <p>"I'll explain that," said Hax, blinking at me through his huge lens. "We
  had always suspected the existence of the outer world, but never were we able
  to reach it. Our borings invariably entered strata of molten rock too hot to
  work. We had experienced many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but ours
  were always above, rather than below us. The vents always sealed themselves
  eventually by the slow cooling of the lava. But after the terrific eruption
  of Coseguina, which had poured out millions of tons of hot lava on the
  surface of our world, forming an immense cone that reached almost to the
  vault, our investigating scientists noticed that the vent did not seal itself
  after the lava flow ceased, and that our atmospheric pressure had increased
  as if another atmosphere had been superimposed on it.</p>

  <p>"The vent was, at first, too hot for the Snals to investigate, but we sent
  our proxies, the Teks, in flying globes. Having ascertained that it led to an
  outer world, we cooled it swiftly with a spray of liquid helium&mdash;then
  lined it with a metal shaft impervious to further incursions of hot lava.
  What happened later was inevitable.</p>

  <p>"As soon as we discovered that there were living, intelligent creatures in
  the outer world, Zet, ambitious conqueror of our world, laid his plans to
  conquer yours. I objected, but I was overruled.</p>

  <p>"You know the rest, and I am hungry, thirsty and weary."</p>

  <p>The president signed to the guards, who took him away.</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>Two years have passed since those events took place, yet I can see them as
  clearly as if they had occurred but yesterday. For three months after the
  canal was blasted through the wall of Coseguina, the Pacific continued to
  flow into the shaft. Then the whirlpool disappeared, and a level crater lake
  was formed. Hax told us that it was impossible for the nether world to have
  been completely filled with water in that time&mdash;that its inhabitants
  must have found some way to stem the flow.</p>

  <p>He may be right. I do not know, nor do I care much, so long as its slimy
  intelligences are kept where they belong&mdash;in the dank, musty regions
  where they were evolved. For then I will feel more assurance about the future
  of a certain little curly-headed, brown-eyed fellow Dolores has just brought
  to my study, pajama-clad, to say "good night" to his daddy.</p>

  <p>The years pass quickly, and it will not be long before Wallace, Jr., must
  shift for himself in the world that was saved by his mother's tears.</p><br>

  <p class="note">
  Note&mdash;Mycetozoan is formed from two Greek words, the first meaning
  "fungus" and the other meaning "animal." This won an old name for the fungus,
  myxomycetes, which was considered by some authorities to be an animal. The
  name myomycetes means slime fungus; the idea of the animal relationship is
  generally thrown out, although some still consider the fungus as belonging to
  the lowest order of animals. The dispute indicated is an old one. The English
  language name is slime moulds. They increase by division and finally
  aggregate or fuse into masses of protoplasm, called plasmodia. These masses
  are often found on decaying logs.</p>
