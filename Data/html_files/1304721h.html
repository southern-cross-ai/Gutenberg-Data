  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; MESSENGER OF HORROR</h2>

  <p class="first">It was ball-shaped and about the size of a five-year-old's
  fist. Its color was the yellow-tainted white of a corpse dead a day. It was
  so weightless that although the lightest of breezes breathed down Stalton's
  elm-lined Blossom Street it fled before the zephyr, curiously swift,
  curiously without sound.</p>

  <p>In the dusk's dim grey hush the thing was at first noticed by no one, so
  that for minutes no one thought its presence strange, though the hamlet lay
  in the midst of rolling fields, and the nearest spot sunless and dank enough
  for the fungus to grow was Roget's Wood, a full five miles away.</p>

  <p>It darted along the narrow, sod-bordered walk, leaping the grass-shoots
  between the worn flagstones, flitting beneath the feet of the strollers in
  the dreamy twilight.</p>

  <p>None had any hint of how soon all laughter would be stifled in Stalton, of
  how soon eyes now sparkling with gaiety would be dark and brooding with
  dread.</p>

  <p>It was Hilda Mead who first saw the round thing as it scudded past her
  along a picket fence pale in the evening's greyness. "Look!" she exclaimed,
  snatching her slim hand from Hal Curtin's warm clasp to point at it. "Look,
  darling! What <i>is</i> that?"</p>

  <p>"What?" her stalwart lover asked, his gaze reluctant to drag itself from
  her olive, elfin face, from the sweet promise of her velvet lips. "What is
  what, dear?"</p>

  <p>"That... Oh, I don't like it, Hal." A tiny shudder went through her
  small-boned, round little body. "I don't like the way it's running along as
  though it were alive with a queer kind of life, and <i>knows</i> where it's
  going."</p>

  <p>"Silly," the young man exclaimed, his teeth flashing in a fond smile as he
  peered after that at which Hilda pointed. "It's nothing but a puffball. It's
  a common fungus, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I still don't like it," the girl interrupted, pouting prettily at
  Curtin. "I'm afraid of it."</p>

  <p>"Afraid!" Instinctively wise in the ways of love, Hal Curtin had sense
  enough not to laugh, had sense enough to draw Hilda within the strong curve
  of his arm, to hold her close against his body's slender strength and say,
  deep-voiced: "You need never be afraid of anything while I'm alive to protect
  you."</p>

  <p>The puffball veered sharply from its course, almost as if possessed of the
  weird sentience Hilda had ascribed to it. It leaped at a dim-seen gate,
  struck a paling and vanished in the spurt of spore-smoke that gives its kind
  their name.</p>

  <p>In the next moment the cottage beyond that gate seemed blotted out by a
  dark pall; its outlines merged with the night, the yellow rectangles of its
  windows gone...</p>

  <p>Something's happened to the lights, Hal Curtin thought...</p>

  <p>In the blackened house someone laughed. The laugh was edged with
  shrillness and utterly humorless, and threaded by a mad sort of agony. More
  appalling than any scream, it held Blossom Street in thrall to a sudden, icy
  paralysis so that there was no movement under the elms but only blanching
  faces and the gasp of caught breaths.</p>

  <p>Then there was light again in those windows, a burst of lurid light that
  lay in whirling sheets against the panes and smashed through them with a
  great shattering of glass, and spouted out of the gaping holes thus made in
  huge roaring tongues of flame. There was light in the street and on the
  ivy-clad small homes in the gardens, the terrifying orange-red light of fire.
  There were shadows; the gigantic black shadows of the trees wavering as the
  flames wavered; the shadows of humans, arms flung overhead&mdash;shouting
  shadows, screaming shadows pelting toward the blaze.</p>

  <p>Shouts and screams and the roar of the flames, and always through the roar
  that terrible laugh...</p>

  <p>"God!" Hal Curtin gasped, Hilda tight within his arm. "They haven't the
  ghost of a chance!" Those who had been strolling on Blossom Street were past
  them, those coming from farther off had not yet reached them, and for
  breathless seconds the lovers were isolated. "They're done for..."</p>

  <p>"Look!" the girl throbbed. "Look!" Her free hand flung out to the
  ridgepole of the blazing house. "There..."</p>

  <p>Against sky-glare was blackly silhouetted a thing man-form yet grotesquely
  not a man. On the narrow crest of the slanted roof that was not yet alight,
  it capered in a queerly simian frenzy and it was from that capering
  monstrosity that the brain-curdling laugh came.</p>

  <p>From the dark human mass surging against the fence of the doomed house,
  surging away from the blasting heat of that furnace, a shout went up. Curtin
  could not know whether it was evoked by sight of the thing on the roof or by
  the explosion of flame through the black roof-slant. The house was a vast
  torch now, a pillar of seething orange and crimson and strange greens
  supporting on its apex the affrighted vault of the sky, within which nothing
  could live.</p>

  <p>Nothing... Hal tore himself away from Hilda's clinging hands, a strange
  cry in his throat! He vaulted the pickets beside them, his leap a lithe and
  effortless bound, was hurtling away from her.</p>

  <p>His feet thudded into soft garden loam and in his nostrils was the sweet
  fragrance of honeysuckle. His toes flung the crunch of path-cinders behind
  him. He whipped past the red-bathed porch of a small home, past its end wall
  whose dark ivy strove to shield it from the lurid glare. He was beyond it, on
  the soft turf of its kitchen yard, angling toward the roar whence that glare
  came and had plunged into the shadow of the next house, stygian by
  contrast.</p>

  <p>Blinded, Curtin battered into a back hedge he did not see, was ripped by
  its stems, its stiff leaves, as he burst through it into blackness. Tall
  grass whipped his legs and he knew he was in the vacant lots that lie between
  Stalton and the fields. He halted for a moment to get his bearings, projected
  almost useless sight, taut hearing, into the gloom that was the deeper
  because overlaid by the rubid heavens.</p>

  <p>Somewhere within that murk was furtive movement... There! Almost straight
  ahead was a darkening of the black. Hal launched himself at the vague forms,
  wrath wrenching a shout from his lips.</p>

  <p>The forms were plainer... his ankle was caught by some ground-creeper,
  pulled from under him. He lurched forward into a blow that exploded white
  light within his skull...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">HILDA MEAD squatted in the tall grass, reckless of her filmy
  white frock. "Hal!" she whimpered. "Hal. I thought I'd never find you." Her
  hands tugged at the recumbent form, tugged its head on to her knees. "Hal!"
  Her fingers found wetness on that head, viscid wetness matting the hair,
  staining her fingers.</p>

  <p>"Ouch!" Curtin winced, jerking his head from the fierce pain of that
  touch. "Don't..." then, "Hilda. You..."</p>

  <p>"Hal! What was it? What were you chasing? What&mdash;who did this to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I saw..." he checked himself. "Hilda! Don't ask me what I saw. Don't let
  me tell you."</p>

  <p>"Hal, you're still dazed. You're talking wildly."</p>

  <p>"No." Curtin pushed hands against the ground, pushed himself to a sitting
  posture. "No. I'm not dazed. I... Hilda, you must not know. It would be
  dangerous for you to know." Something in his tone told the girl there was
  utter truth in the words that otherwise were so mad. "And listen. Tell no one
  it was I... How I got this cut on my head. Say that I started to run to the
  fire, tripped, banged my skull. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps I was not seen clearly,
  was not recognized." It was fear that sounded in Hal's voice, and Hilda had
  not dreamed that he could ever be afraid. "Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "I don't understand. But I'll do as you say."</p>

  <p>A crash pulled their eyes to where the fire had blazed. Sparks fountained
  above the dull red glow that was all that was left of the blaze. High into
  the sky they went, till they were golden stars dancing in the heavens, and
  then they were drifting down again upon Stalton. Hilda Mead had a queer fancy
  that they were tiny lanterns guiding a horde of imps to their landing
  place.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; DISASTER!</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was not till long after dawn that the ruins of the house
  on Blossom Street had cooled sufficiently to permit inspection, and the full
  extent of the horror made certain.</p>

  <p>The searchers found the skeletons then, in the jumble of charred timbers
  that once had been a home, enough of the incinerated bones to identify whose
  they were when the holocaust seared life from them. There were five of them,
  five heaps of whitened ashes.</p>

  <p>"That's the full count," the haggard-faced Fire Chief said when he had
  received the last report from one of his men. "Not one escaped."</p>

  <p>"How could they," John Wayne, village president, responded, "the way that
  fire burst out?" He was tall and gnarled and sturdy as an oak. His hatless
  white hair was smudged by the embers that had drifted into it while the blaze
  still burned, for he had been early on the scene. "They tell me it was
  everywhere at once, upstairs and down." His grizzled, kindly countenance was
  grey with his distress. "Everywhere."</p>

  <p>"That's what's got me," Chief Rail muttered. "It was a wooden house sure
  enough, but it was well built and should have resisted the flames if I know
  anything at all. I'd understand it if they'd been cut off in a single room,
  but from the position of the&mdash;bodies and the things around them, the
  maid was in the kitchen washing dishes. Bob Dutton and the boy were in the
  living room, Mary upstairs in the nursery."</p>

  <p>"And the baby?"</p>

  <p>"The baby was in its crib," Rail said softly. "Mary&mdash;the way she lies
  tells us&mdash;threw herself over it to save it. Even with the flames around
  her, as they must have been, the mother did that."</p>

  <p>A murmur went through the group of mourning neighbors that, silent save
  for a shifting of uneasy feet and an occasional muffled sob, had been
  listening to the report. In the depths of Hal Curtin's brown eyes a smolder
  of wrath deepened and the line of his blunt jaw hardened to a knotted
  ridge.</p>

  <p>He moved closer to Wayne and Rail, addressed the latter. "Chief," he
  asked, low-toned, "are you sure that was all who were in the house?"</p>

  <p>The tired man turned to him. "We've raked the ashes clean and that's all
  we've found."</p>

  <p>"That isn't what I mean. I thought there might&mdash;that someone might
  have escaped. I know the family's all accounted for, but there might have
  been some visitor..."</p>

  <p>"There wasn't none," a pillow-bosomed woman, Lena Corbitt, put in. "I was
  just in there to ask Mary for a dress pattern I knew she had, and there
  wasn't anyone but Bob and little Bob and her around. And there couldn't have
  been anybody come in because I was scarcely back to my own gate, two doors
  away, when the thing happened."</p>

  <p>"In the kitchen maybe? Someone calling on the maid?"</p>

  <p>"No. I went to the door to ask Jennie for a glass of water and I saw the
  whole room. There wasn't anybody!"</p>

  <p>That was that, then. The capering figure on the roof was unexplained. The
  figure that had laughed not in glee but in agony. No one had mentioned it,
  hence no one but he and Hilda had seen it; but that was reasonable. The
  spectators' gaze had been riveted on the flame-filled, windows.</p>

  <p>"Why did you ask that?" Rail inquired. "What's on your mind, Hal?"</p>

  <p>Curtin shrugged. "Nothing." Now why had he lied? He had intended to tell
  them of what he'd seen. "Just a hunch I had." He glanced at the watch on his
  wrist. "It's late. I've got to be getting to work much as I don't feel like
  it."</p>

  <p>The knot of watchers broke up as he walked away, reminded of waiting
  offices and workrooms, of housework to be done and children to be sent off to
  school. But those children were kissed more lingeringly that morning, more
  reluctantly dispatched. Infants too young for school were held tightly to
  their mothers' breasts.</p>

  <p>"Hal!" Hilda's dear voice called his name. She was at the gate of her
  home, halfway down the block, fresh and sweet in a filmy negligee, her eyes
  still dewy with sleep.</p>

  <p>"Hal! I saw you... Is your head all right?" She touched the plastered
  bandage that made a white patch in his shock of chestnut hair. "I had to run
  out and ask."</p>

  <p>"Quite all right, darling." His brown, strong hand closed on her fingers,
  took them to his lips. "I haven't even a headache left."</p>

  <p>"Hal, I was awake for a long time. I was thinking... could that thing we
  saw have had anything to do with&mdash;what happened? That puff ball?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, what a queer idea!" Curtin was queerly uneasy. "How on earth
  could it?" He had an obscure sensation as of eyes upon him, watching, evil
  eyes. He half turned to the street with careful carelessness calculated not
  to alarm his sweetheart.</p>

  <p>"It couldn't, of course," he heard her. "Of course it couldn't."</p>

  <p>Nobody was watching him. There was no one who had any reason to watch him.
  They were all familiar, all friendly, warmhearted people who had been his
  neighbors and friends.</p>

  <p>"That's more sensible." He leaned over the gate, kissed Hilda full on her
  sweet, warm mouth. "'Bye, love. I've got to go and tend to business."</p>

  <p>She held him a moment longer. "Hal," she breathed, "I want to ask you
  something."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Did you mean what you said last night? That you'll protect me from
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"All my life. From the devil and all his imps." His voice was deep, as if
  he suddenly had some prescience of how soon he was to be called upon to
  fulfill almost literally that promise.</p>

  <p>The second puffball was seen by many of the townspeople. It appeared in
  Main Street at three-fifteen that afternoon, when traffic there was at its
  height. It bounded straight down the center of the street, and it was the way
  that it avoided the rolling wheels of the autos, the trampling hooves of the
  farmers' horses that drew amused eyes, pointing fingers, to it.</p>

  <p>The wind was stronger than it had been on the previous evening and the bit
  of fungus was much like a tiny, pallid animal scudding legless and armless
  before it. It was shooting across the intersection of Apple Street when Hal
  Curtin, driving back to his law office from the Town Hall, spied it.</p>

  <p>Unaccountably his skin crawled with sudden apprehension. Almost without
  volition he skidded his roadster into Main Street and darted after the
  swiftly rolling thing like a terrier after a rat.</p>

  <p>The instant before his mind had still been filled with the scene in the
  village's Council Room. John Wayne had presided with unaccustomed solemnity,
  the morning's tragedy brooding in his eyes. Curtin himself, butcher Rudolph
  Schalk, portly, ruddy-cheeked; gaunt and acidulous Doctor Adam Ranier, and
  Stephen Brinn, pompous with the dignity of his bank, had sat slouched deep in
  their chairs, attentive but wordless. But there had been debate verging on
  acrimony at that meeting.</p>

  <p>The protagonists had been fussy little Mark Yarrow the druggist, and
  realtor Reddon Gast; the issue, approval by the Council of a great trunk
  highway proposed to run through Stalton's very center.</p>

  <p>Gast was violently in favor, Yarrow opposed. Brinn and Ranier were lined
  up with the realtor, Schalk and Curtin with Yarrow. That left Wayne with the
  deciding vote, and there was no doubt of how that vote would be cast.</p>

  <p>Stalton was the old man's very life: its tree-lined streets, its neat,
  white homes, its peaceful atmosphere of neighborliness created almost by his
  very hands. When first he'd come here the town had been a rambling, dingy
  hamlet, a trading center for the farmers' roundabout, and nothing more. By
  his influence, by his unremitting toil, it had become what it was. A trunk
  route through it would bring turmoil and confusion, a mushroom growth of gas
  stations and hotdog stands and roadhouses, a stench of exhaust fumes by day
  and a clamor of honking horns by night.</p>

  <p>Yet such was the fairness, the passion for justice of the man that,
  because Gast and his party saw prosperity for Stalton in the change, he had
  agreed to reserve the vote given him only in case of a tie, till they had had
  every opportunity to win over one of those who thought as he.</p>

  <p>Wayne had gone further. He had offered to resign from his presidency and
  call a special election in which he would run against any one Gast chose.
  This, however, the realtor had refused, knowing well enough that, no matter
  what the question, John Wayne would be re-elected by an overwhelming margin,
  so dearly loved was he by the people of Stalton.</p>

  <p>Gast preferred, however, to attempt to win to his side one of those who
  was not too strongly opposed to the idea. If he succeeded, his paltry land
  holdings would become a veritable gold mine.</p>

  <p>Wealth, then, had been the gage for which Reddon Gast had battled, his
  alpaca coat hanging in loose folds on his huge, rawboned frame, his
  countenance granite-hard and expressionless except for the faint sneer of his
  lifted lip at Mark Yarrow, his predatory eyes contemptuous of the little man
  whose Vandyke had bristled and voice grown shrill and stuttering.</p>

  <p>Hal Curtin had watched the dispute with a curious intentness he was
  careful to mask, with a curious excitement manifested only by the throb of a
  pulse in his temple. If he could only be sure of what he had seen last night,
  just before that terrific blow had smashed him into oblivion...</p>

  <p>There had been no decision. Gast, sensing that he had made no progress,
  had demanded another week's consideration. Curtin had left the Town Hall with
  that pump of blood still in his temple, had driven mechanically east with a
  strange, unbelievable speculation throbbing in his skull. Then he saw that
  small puffball scuttering up Main Street, and Hilda's queer remark of the
  morning flashed out of memory.</p>

  <p>It kept just ahead of his car's hood, a bounding, irregular sphere all but
  animate. He recalled Hilda's words: "... alive with a queer kind of life. It
  <i>knows</i> where it's going." Something grated along the side of his
  roadster, caught a fender, let go...</p>

  <p>The puffball leaped sidewise, darted toward the sidewalk, darted across it
  and straight into the lobby of a movie theatre whose canopy was overhung with
  flamboyant signs proclaiming: Kiddies' Matinee&mdash;Mickie
  Mouse&mdash;Rustlers of Sunset Range, Episode 8&mdash;Kiddies' Matinee.</p>

  <p>Hal jammed his brakes, hurled out of his car, hurtled into the lobby. A
  swirl of gray smoke, spore-puff of the fungus, lay against the white base of
  the door into the auditorium.</p>

  <p>Curtin's palm slapped the door&mdash;fingers grabbed his arm and a voice
  rasped, "Ticket, mister."</p>

  <p>Blackness billowed through the aperture between door-edge and jamb, as if
  an inky fog that filled the interior were finding exit. "Where's your...?"
  <i>The door was blasted outward by a thunderous crash!</i> Screams came with
  the thunder and the black fog was suddenly solid with plaster dust. These
  were children screaming, children in terror, children in pain...</p>

  <p>A laugh threaded the chorus of agony! It was the same chattering, mad
  laugh he had heard not many hours before, the laugh whose sound had never
  quite died out of Hal Curtin's brain...</p>

  <p>The doorman's clutch was a desperate, insensate grip on his arm. He ripped
  loose from it, battered the door out of his way, plunged through it into an
  impenetrable darkness, dust-filled and filled with shrill cries, with
  whimpers, with other sounds indescribable&mdash;</p>

  <p>And with that damned laugh!</p>

  <p>Curtin jerked to a halt, bewildered by that sightless void. Abruptly the
  black fog seemed to dissipate. A glow spread through it and he could make out
  jumbled timbers, small forms inextricably entangled with them; small forms
  struggling, jerking feebly, and not moving at all.</p>

  <p>Realization of what had happened beat in on Hal. The balcony had fallen
  with its load of children on the children below... Not all the balcony...</p>

  <p>The projection booth was still erect on its stilts, light streaming from
  its square window, white light which caught the swirling dust and cast a
  murky glow by which he saw the broken little bodies. Horrified, he saw a tiny
  hand reach out from between two shattered beams, its wee fingers gloved with
  blood, twitching...</p>

  <p>The laugh beat at his brain, the laugh so weirdly evil with insane pain.
  Where did it come from? Who could be laughing in this hell?</p>

  <p>Men and shouts poured through the door behind Curtin, battered him, and
  caught him up in their swirl. Men were clawing at the chaos; cursing,
  sobbing, frantic with horror and with grief. A voice, scarcely human,
  jabbered, "Lila. Where's my Lila. She's in here."</p>

  <p>The dust swirl, heavy, was settling, the cloud thinning. The light from
  the projection booth was gathering into a sharp-edged beam boring through the
  terrible darkness. Its end was a great white square on the further wall. This
  was the screen that should be displaying an antic rodent. On it, black,
  shaggy and grotesque, capered the gigantic shadow of that which laughed!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE THIRD PUFFBALL</h2>

  <p class="first">HAL CURTIN was abruptly aware that somehow he had struggled
  far down toward that screen, dragged there perhaps by his stunned, unthinking
  search for the source of the laugh. He must have clambered over the worst of
  the wreckage for there was little here. The seats were empty, open exit doors
  showing where those who had occupied these seats, and still were able to
  move, had gone.</p>

  <p>Behind him was the terrible clamor of disaster and rescue. Ahead of him
  that shadow on the screen and, on the stage-like narrow platform just before
  the screen, the&mdash;thing&mdash;that cast it.</p>

  <p>It danced its evil rigadoon, laughing&mdash;Curtin vented an incoherent
  shout&mdash;threw himself down the aisle. His weaponless fingers were clawed,
  his throat swollen with the terrible anger that possessed him. Beneath his
  tongue was the salt-sweet taste of blood. He passed, the final seat-row,
  glanced up at the high rise of the stage-front close before him, jumped for
  its summit.</p>

  <p>His hands caught the platform edge, clung. The momentum of his leap
  carried his torso high enough so that he could straighten his arms, get a
  toe-hold, lift and come erect on the little stage.</p>

  <p>He was alone on it! The laughter had vanished.</p>

  <p>Dazzled by the reflection from the screen's silver surface, Curtin started
  to turn&mdash;the flooring went from beneath his feet. <i>He dropped
  plummet-like into darkness!</i></p>

  <p>There is no consciousness of time in a sudden fall, only marrow-freezing
  terror.</p>

  <p>A split-second or many minutes might have elapsed before Hal crashed on
  solid support.</p>

  <p>Jarred, half-dazed, he contrived to flail gritty hands, already fisted, to
  fight whatever it was that had trapped him. He was on his feet...
  surprisingly...</p>

  <p>A black shape loomed in the blackness! Before Curtin could move there was
  a click, yellow light...</p>

  <p>Reddon Gast, his hand on a switch panted. "What is it? What's happened in
  the theatre? I heard a crash from my office... ran out the back way, through
  the alley and in here..." Metal armored cables twisted reptilian in the
  confined space, undulated upward to black, conelike objects, over Gast's
  head. "What's happened, Hal? You look..." Hal realized they were
  loud-speakers, behind the screen. This was the chamber beneath it where they were
  adjusted. That fall of Hal's had brought him only level with the theatre
  floor.</p>

  <p>"Happened?" he gasped. "Enough. But&mdash;did you see anyone coming out of
  here? A man&mdash;like a huge ape?"</p>

  <p>"Ape!" The realtor stared at him, his eyes widening, as though with doubt
  of the other's sanity. "No. Of course not. No one passed me. <i>What's
  that?"</i> A woman's wail, pent with excruciating suffering, came through the
  overhead aperture through which Hal had fallen. "What's going on in
  there?"</p>

  <p>"The balcony fell." The answer came absently, without intonation.
  "Hundreds of children killed."</p>

  <p>"Great Jupiter!" Gast lurched past Curtin, was heaving up a vertical iron
  ladder that came down from the trapdoor through which the lawyer had
  fallen...</p>

  <p>The rest of that afternoon was a blur to Curtin. Afterwards he had a dim
  memory of helping to lift great beams, of carrying limp and moaning small
  forms tenderly in his arms, of laying lifeless bodies in a lengthening,
  terrible row.</p>

  <p>He was not quite clear-minded again till he found himself in the kitchen
  of Hilda's home on Blossom Street, weariness a dull ache in his muscles and
  his bones, his brain a boil of dark and dreadful thoughts, black as the night
  pressing against the unshaded windows.</p>

  <p>"Eat this salad, darling," Hilda was saying. "Look, I made it for you just
  the way you like; only white meat, nice, crisp lettuce and plenty of
  mayonnaise. And here's iced tea. You must eat or you'll be sick."</p>

  <p>He looked up at her from his chair at the kitchen table. "You made it," he
  said dully. "Where's Ethel?"</p>

  <p>The girl smiled through the glimmer of tears in her eyes. "I told you,"
  she answered with tender patience, "that Ethel went to the hospital where her
  little brother is, and that dad and mother are out seeing what they can do to
  help the Widow Simpson, whose son and daughter both were killed this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Yes," her lover muttered. "Yes. I remember." Because Hilda seemed to want
  it so much he reached for the dainty plate she had prepared. His sleeve
  brushed a crumpled newspaper on the table.</p>

  <p>The lurid headlines leaped from the page at him:</p>

  <p class="headline">Forty Killed, Scores Hurt in Theatre Crash<br>
  Balcony Collapse Blamed on Lax Inspection<br>
  Gast Accuses President Wayne to Weakness<br>
  Links Failure to Find Cause of Blossom St. Fire<br>
  and Demands Thorough Investigation</p><br>

  <p><i>"Gast</i> accuses!" Curtin exclaimed, jumping to his feet. <i>"Gast</i>
  demands!" He stared wild-eyed at the startled girl. "But it was Gast who was
  in the sound room, Gast who said he saw no one come out of it. I've got it,
  Hilda. By God, I've got it and I'm going to stop it." He whirled, was running
  through the dining room, was through the hall and out on the porch. He was in
  his roadster, parked outside, and was pounding his heel on the starter.</p>

  <p>The car jumped away from the curb, roared off, roared past the blackened
  ruins of the house where five had been seared to death, past houses still
  standing that were blackened with heart-rending grief or with an anguish of
  doubt more poignant than mourning. Last night, Hal Curtin thought, little
  children were laughing inside those houses...</p>

  <p>Laughing! Twice he had heard another kind of laugh&mdash;how did that fit
  into the dark pattern that had formed in his mind?</p>

  <p>He twisted his wheel, changing his course. To fill out that pattern there
  was a bit of information he must obtain, and Mark Yarrow would have it for
  him. The little druggist was the village gossip...</p>

  <p>The loungers in the pharmacy were pallid tonight, their faces sultry with
  recollection of the scenes they had witnessed not long since. There was
  little talk from their tight-lipped mouths, but what there was, was of John
  Wayne and how he had failed them.</p>

  <p>"I've got a hunch there's plenty more due to happen," someone said. "The
  way the town's gone to rack and ruin lately. I got a feeling in my bones this
  ain't the last."</p>

  <p>"Cut it, Bill," another protested. "Ain't we got enough to think about?"
  But the first speaker had voiced the sense of impending doom, the prescience
  of further disaster that brooded over all Stalton.</p>

  <p>Ancestral fears were revived tonight in the mourning town, inchoate as
  these might have been in the souls of their ancestors. The gods were wroth
  with them, and prepared their destruction. The gods must be appeased by a
  human sacrifice, and that sacrifice was ready to their hand.</p>

  <p>"I say we all ought to go up to John Wayne's and..."</p>

  <p>The sentence was interrupted by the entrance of Hal Curtin. Disheveled,
  his eyes burned-out coals in a yeasty mask, he strode stiff-legged through
  them. He shouldered them aside from his path, and none took offense because
  it was so evident he did not know he had done so. He went straight back
  through the store, past the end of the counter that closed off its public
  space, through the swinging door in the partition behind it.</p>

  <p>Mark Yarrow, dapper in a white half-smock, looked up from the pills he was
  rolling to see the apparition stride into his prescription room. Before his
  indignation at the intrusion could find more expression than a pursing of his
  lips, a hand had clutched his collar and thick words were choking off his own
  utterance.</p>

  <p>"Mark," Curtin demanded. "Tell me. Has Reddon Gast any connection with the
  county madhouse?"</p>

  <p>He gasped, "Yes. He's on the Board and he leased the place to the county.
  That's one of his little grafts. Why...?"</p>

  <p>He was left with the question unfinished, his mouth gaping like a pouter
  fish's. Hal Curtin had wheeled away and was gone.</p>

  <p>"Gawd," he heard an exclamation from outside. "What's eating you..." and
  then the hammer of heels across the floor out there was ended, to be
  succeeded an instant later by the <i>thrrrrr</i> of an auto starter and the
  clash of gears viciously meshed.</p>

  <p>The night seemed darker to Hal Curtin, and more foreboding, as he
  catapulted through the village, retracing his course. A block from Hilda's he
  braked again, sat for a minute with clenched hands, with lips biting hard on
  one another. He must get control of himself, must speak coherently,
  convincingly. That which he was about to say would be difficult enough to get
  across without the impediment of its being said by one who looked as if he
  were on the brink of madness.</p>

  <p>Mark Yarrow's expression had told him what he looked like.</p>

  <p>There was a comb somewhere in his pocket. He fumbled for it, used it. He
  adjusted his tie, straightened his coat. These small actions helped to reduce
  the fever in his blood, the pound in his temples. Now he could trust
  himself.</p>

  <p>He got out of the roadster, walked quite slowly up the path that led
  through a garden to the Colonial entrance of a small but somehow stately
  white house. He read the name in letters of wrought iron set in the weathered
  boards of the door:</p>

  <p>John Wayne</p>

  <p>His hand did not tremble as he lifted the knocker and rapped once with
  it.</p>

  <p>The door opened more quickly than he had expected. It was Wayne himself
  who opened it. The sight of his countenance, ashen, haggard, the visage of an
  almost senile ancient now, and not that of gracious age, undid all Hal Curtin
  had accomplished with himself.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wayne," he blurted. "I've come to tell you... I know who's behind
  what's happening in town. I've seen..."</p>

  <p>Something flared into Wayne's sunken eyes, something that silenced Curtin
  more surely than the old man's, "Wait a minute, Hal! Come in..."</p>

  <p>And then there was another voice, from behind Wayne. "Looks like I'd
  better cut my good-night short, John. Well, we understand each other, don't
  we?" The old man turned... to Reddon Gast!</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "Yes, Reddon. I understand. Thank you for coming." They
  were shaking hands. Gast was passing Curtin with a curt nod. Did Hal imagine
  it or was there dark flame in the pouch-underlaid eyes that caught his own
  briefly, flame of a hellish hate?</p>

  <p>"What was he doing here?" Curtin croaked. "What did he want?"</p>

  <p>Wayne smiled wearily. "He came to apologize for what he said to the
  Gazette's reporter. He was excited, didn't mean it. He does not honestly
  blame me for&mdash;the fire and the accident, and he's going to make a
  statement tomorrow retracting what he said today."</p>

  <p>"After the damage is done," Curtin commented, bitterly. "After he's set
  Stalton against you as he planned from the beginning. You're through now.
  They'll demand your resignation, and some creature of his will be elected.
  Which is exactly why he's done what he has. He wants that highway and the
  fortune it means for him, and he's stopped at nothing to get it. Not even at
  murder."</p>

  <p>John Wayne took a step backward into the open doorway, one almost
  transparent hand lifting as if to ward off an attack.</p>

  <p>"What?" the old man whispered.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Just that. Gast is responsible for the fire on Blossom Street, for the
  collapse of the theatre balcony. And if those are not enough, he's ready to
  perpetrate another outrage. All this to discredit you, to get you out of the
  way."</p>

  <p>"You're&mdash;you're upset, my boy. What you say is&mdash;impossible.
  Those were accidents."</p>

  <p>"The hell they were accidents. Look!" The words were tumbling out of
  Curtin's mouth now, the words that had been pounding in his skull. "If that
  house were filled with lycopodium, a haze of fine powder, no one would have
  noticed. If a match were struck, it would have blazed up all at once, the way
  it did. A very little dynamite, placed under the supporting pillars of the
  theatre balcony, would have brought it down. Gast had access to dynamite.
  He's blasting foundations for that office building on Apple Street and he
  could have..."</p>

  <p>"What are you saying? I've known Reddon for years. Gast couldn't..."</p>

  <p>"No. Not Gast with his own hands. But Gast in the person of some madman he
  released from the asylum. I've seen him, I'd know him anywhere. I saw him in
  the theatre and he got away. I saw him before that, on the roof of the
  burning house, saw him leap for the telephone wires just before the final
  burst of flame came, and drop to the ground. I almost caught him that time,
  would have if there hadn't been someone with him who clouted me..."</p>

  <p>"Hal!" Wayne interrupted. "That's it! You were hurt more badly than you
  thought when you fell that night, and your experience today finished the job.
  Go home. Get some sleep. Tomorrow you'll be rid of these wild ideas."</p>

  <p>"I can prove it to you. I can, I'm almost certain, show you the madman.
  I've got an idea where he's hiding. Those puff-balls that have been appearing
  just before each thing happens, can come only from Roget's Wood. He brings
  them&mdash;that's where his lair is. We'll organize a posse and go there and
  capture him, and that will prove my ideas aren't as wild as you think."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Yes I know. They seem so logical now, but after you've slept you'll
  see how fantastic they are. Look, I'll go get my hat and take you home. Wait
  here." The door shut between them, as if the old man were frightened of his
  visitor and wished a solid barrier for protection.</p>

  <p>"God!" Curtin groaned, his hands fisting at his sides. "God help me. God
  help Stalton..." He turned to go back to his roadster, some idea of running
  back to Yarrow's, of telling his tale to the men there, beginning to form in
  his desperation...</p>

  <p>On the sidewalk, bounding along with a noiseless swiftness now terrible to
  him, was a puffball. It shot by, went on up the street.</p>

  <p>Something more was about to happen! Some new horror was coming to one of
  the houses on Blossom Street! <i>Hilda Mead's house was in the direction the
  puffball fled. Was that the house that was marked for doom?</i></p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE DARK CLOAKS DEATH</h2>

  <p class="first">HAL CURTIN was running, but it seemed to him he made no
  progress at all along that quiet street, that as in a nightmare the faster he
  ran the more firmly was he rooted to the spot where he was.</p>

  <p>And always fifty feet before him bounded the pallid bit of fluff he could
  not overtake, though overtaking it meant so terribly much.</p>

  <p>Abruptly it veered, as he'd seen two exactly like it veer. It <i>was</i>
  Hilda's gate, open as he himself had left it, through which the thing darted.
  It was Hilda's garden pathway up which it scuttered, Hilda's porch steps it
  struck to puff out of existence in a gray swirl of spore dust.</p>

  <p>As he flung himself up the path icy terror jelled Hal Curtin's veins. But
  nothing happened. The structure that housed the girl he loved did not burst
  into flame, did not collapse, did not, as he half-expected, vanish as the
  puffball had in a swirl of grey smoke.</p>

  <p>He gasped with relief as he leaped the porch steps, seized the doorknob,
  jerked the portal open and flung through into the foyer that had known the
  kisses and the whisperings of so many lingering good-nights... And gasped
  again with terror, finding himself in black darkness, even the street-lamp
  light close behind blotted out!</p>

  <p>This was not merely the absence of light. This was blackness that
  swallowed sight, which swallowed reality itself and left nothing but terror.
  This was the black fog that had filled the house up the road just before the
  lurid flames had made it a roaring furnace, the fog that had swirled out of
  the theatre auditorium just before its balcony had crashed! Now it was here,
  and somewhere within it was...</p>

  <p>"Hilda!" Her name burst from Hal Curtin's clamped throat. "Hilda!"</p>

  <p>There was no answer!</p>

  <p><i>"Hilda!"</i></p>

  <p>His cry was quenched by vacant silence, by the muffled hush of doom... Was
  there, somewhere ahead, the faint shadow of a laugh, of a chattering, mad
  laugh...? Ahead... from the kitchen where he had left Hilda... there was a
  glow, vague, vertical and narrow. It was light, blessed light, seeping past
  the edge of the kitchen door.</p>

  <p>Curtin's footfalls made hollow, empty echoes in the empty house. He flung
  into the kitchen&mdash;the <i>lighted</i> kitchen... halted...</p>

  <p>No Hilda. Not even her body, as he had feared, dead in some awful way. No
  sign of her at all. But the table at which he'd sat was overturned. A chair
  was smashed by a struggle, a fragment of her flowered dress caught in its
  splinters&mdash;and the back-door swung open to the mystery of the night.</p>

  <p>That was all, the table, the chair, the door... not quite all. There was
  something chalked on the scrubbed white tile of the floor, letters scrawled
  crudely in crimson chalk and obscured by the breakfast cloth that had slid
  from the table.</p>

  <p>Hal Curtin twitched the gay cloth away. He read the message:</p>

  <p>Curtin</p>

  <p>You keep your dam mouth shut if you want to see her again</p>

  <p>He stood there, looking at it, the tablecloth trailing from his clenched
  hand, his mouth working. He had brought this upon her. He... His "dam mouth"
  blurting a warning to Reddon Gast, not waiting to ascertain that he was alone
  with Wayne. Giving Gast time to hasten here and...</p>

  <p>How had Gast dared? If he'd been seen entering or found here when Hilda's
  parents returned...</p>

  <p>It was not Gast who'd entered here. Not Gast. A clearing of Curtin's
  vision had revealed to him something more caught in the splintered end of
  that chair rung than the bit torn from Hilda's dress. Not very much. Just a
  wisp of black hair, of short hairs black and coarse and kinked.</p>

  <p>It was not Reddon Gast who held Hilda Mead prisoner, but Gast's tool, his
  mad creature who had capered in the midst of horror laughing a weird and
  insane laugh!</p>

  <p>That was worse, far worse. A madman knows no set design, no fixed purpose.
  He is swayed by sudden impulses, by the surge of mindless frenzies, <i>of
  insane lusts...</i></p>

  <p>"I will protect you always," Curtin's own oath sounded in his ears.
  "Against Satan and all his imps."</p>

  <p>Protect her! She was in the hands of a mad thing. His Hilda, her rounded,
  warm body, her soft curves, prisoner to a thing half-human perhaps, perhaps
  all beast, subject to his whims, his will.</p>

  <p>Find her! Save her! Save her before it was too late from&mdash;Curtin's
  mind shuddered away from thought of the peril his loved one was in. Find her!
  But where? How?</p>

  <p>Gast knew. He whirled, about to dash out to Gast, to choke the truth from
  him, to tear him limb from limb if he would not give it. It would take time,
  valuable time. Hilda's captor could not have gotten far as yet, by the time
  he had dragged the truth from Reddon Gast they would be God knew how far
  away. God knew what would have occurred before he could reach them. But he
  had no choice...</p>

  <p>Wait! Once more the tortured man recalled his own words, more recently
  spoken. "Those puffballs&mdash;Roget's Wood&mdash;That's where his lair
  is&mdash;I'll take you there."</p>

  <p><i>Roget's Wood!</i> Five miles across the fields. But they were gone only
  ten minutes, fifteen at the most. That was all it was since Gast had left
  Wayne's. If he went after them at once&mdash;no time to get help, no time to
  get a weapon&mdash;he might overtake them, might reach the madman's lair, at
  least, before...</p>

  <p>Hal Curtin whirled again, went sprinting out of the kitchen door, out into
  the lonely night.</p>

  <p>Hal Curtin never knew how long it took him to run those five lightless
  miles over rough fields, up hills that became mountains in the dark,
  splashing through streams, sliding gasping, torn by his own breathing, torn
  by thorns of berry bushes, by barbed wire unseen till he was upon it... But
  he raced through, a featureless chiaroscuro of shadows, feeling his hurts not
  at all, feeling not at all that the clothes were torn from him, that he was
  lacerated and bleeding, that an iron band was about his chest and the hammers
  of hell beating upon his skull.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE HOUSE OF HORROR</h2>

  <p class="first">SOMEWHERE in that nightmare flight there was the thrumming
  of a far-off auto. Somewhere in that Gethsemane there were twin beams of
  distant headlights scything the darkness... and then there was the loom of
  black woods ahead of him, and he was in their earth-odorous dankness, and he
  was slowing to a halt.</p>

  <p>Careful now. He must be careful. If the madman heard him, got warning of
  his approach, Hilda would be... Hal was weaponless, he had only his arms, and
  his fists to use against the Lord alone knew what insane strength. The
  advantage of surprise must be his.</p>

  <p>Surprise. But how? There was impenetrable darkness here. There was only
  the shrill piping of cicadas and the scutterings of the woods' night-kind...
  <i>There was a glimmer of light, far within the tree-deepened
  blackness.</i></p>

  <p>Cautiously, with an instinctive woods-manship called out of racial memory
  by his great need, with a taut check on his urge to run, shouting, to the
  source of that light, Hal Curtin crept up on it. He reached it at long last,
  at last was crouched at the edge of a tiny clearing, was gazing with aching
  eyes at a tumbledown cabin of crumbling logs, some shelter left by ancient
  lumbermen, through whose gaping chinks came the gleam that had brought him
  here.</p>

  <p>Only an instant Curtin crouched there, then he stole across the narrow
  space between and flattened himself against the moss-slimy wall.</p>

  <p>He peered through a crack into the shack's interior. He could see only a
  small portion of it, but that was enough.</p>

  <p>A candle guttered within the hovel. By its wavering, weird luminance he
  saw Hilda.</p>

  <p>Two roughly hewn beams had sometime fallen from the decrepit cabin's roof.
  They slanted now from roof to earthen floor. The girl lay on one of these,
  lashed to it hand and foot, half-covered by the rags to which her neat, crisp
  frock, her dainty undergarments had been reduced.</p>

  <p>She was as yet unharmed. Physically at least. All concealment had been
  torn from one rounded breast. Her arms, her olive, rounded thighs, strained
  at the lashings that cut into their soft, warm flesh. In her fear-widened
  eyes there was ineffable terror.</p>

  <p>Grotesque and horrible as the creature had appeared when capering on a
  blazing roof, when laughing from the stage of a smashed theatre, he was now
  utterly appalling.</p>

  <p>Clad only in ragged trousers, his body was the scarred wreck of a frame
  once clean-cut and stalwart. It was malformed with a rottenness not so much
  of its tissues as of the soul within it, and shaggy with hair black and
  kinked and matted as a wild beast's fur. His straddled, columnar legs, his
  big-thewed arms, bulged with swollen muscles. His unshaved, black-bristled
  countenance was high-browed, its features finely chiseled, but it was empty
  of all intelligence, of all emotion save the vapid, long-toothed grin of a
  mindless idiot, while its skin twitched with tiny spasms as though beneath it
  vermin scuttered and pinched it with their microscopic jaws.</p>

  <p>He towered above the bound, half-naked girl, his lips drooling, his
  soulless eyes repeating their imbecile grin. It was as if he were calling
  upon her to witness the cleverness of that which he was about.</p>

  <p>With a curious deftness one of his great paws juggled three of the puff
  balls that had accumulated so much of terrible meaning for Hal Curtin,
  catching and tossing the fragile globules so that they did not burst but
  danced like down in the wavering light. In and out and about the flickering
  balls he flashed the braided metal lash of a small whip in gleaming intricate
  maneuvers.</p>

  <p>The madman missed one of the puff-balls. It dropped on Hilda, touched her
  just where the ragged edge of her torn slip lay against her abdomen's
  throbbing skin. Her captor snatched at it. His spatulate fingers, clumsy now,
  caught in the pink fabric. There was a ripping sound...</p>

  <p>The ball struck the floor, burst. Not spore dust but a black cloud spurted
  from it, billowed upward to meet the other two that still were floating
  down...</p>

  <p>The madman's frenzied fingers were ripping the last vestige of clothing
  from Hilda. She screamed...</p>

  <p>Her scream came to Curtin out of blackness that enveloped her, that was
  filling the cabin, the blackness that had been spewed from the burst puff
  ball, from the two others. He thrust himself away from the wall, whirled to
  hurl himself along it to search for a door&mdash;there must be a door
  somewhere by which he could get inside, get to Hilda, fight for her...</p>

  <p>There was no longer any light. The candle must have gone out. No, not out.
  Its light quenched by the black fog of the puffballs, by the material
  blackness that was pouring out through the chinks between the logs, clouds
  darker than the forest darkness, darker than evil. There was no light, so
  Curtin had to guide himself by a hand against the log wall, while from behind
  the wall came the screams of the girl he loved, and the bestial snufflings of
  the man-beast who...</p>

  <p>He came to a corner, whirled around it; saw a billow of the stygian vapor
  pouring out of the door he sought. He vented something between a groan and a
  shout, plunged through it...</p>

  <p>Into sightlessness that was alive with sound, Hilda's shrieks, fainter
  now, the sound of rending cloth, snuffling, and horrible snarls.</p>

  <p>"Stop it!" the yell tore Hal's throat. "God blast you," he yelled, "stop
  it!" Hurtling toward those sounds, blinded by the eye-blinding black.
  "Stop..." A heavy blow smashed the back of his head, smashed into his skull.
  He spun down and down into oblivion...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">HAL CURTIN'S head ballooned with pain that expanded within
  it, as though to burst it. Because of the pain he could not move though he
  tried to lift his hand to his head, to still that throbbing torture.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because of the pain that he could not lift his hand! As
  returning consciousness became surer he was aware of tightness about his
  wrists. He was bound, wrists and ankles, to a heavy beam.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes. A wall slanted toward him at a mad angle, an earthen
  floor slanted up toward him. The guttering light through which he saw them
  held a curious quality of darkness, as though it were strained through a
  black mist. This was unreal, dreamlike.</p>

  <p>Someone moaned, beside him. Curtin's head rolled to the sound... It was
  Hilda who moaned! Hilda naked, a grey pallor underlying her skin that was
  crisscrossed with red and angry weals. Her eyes were closed. She was lashed
  to a beam that slanted downward from above. Curtin realized that he too was
  lashed to a beam similarly slanted, that it was he and not the wall, the
  floor, that lay at this unaccustomed angle.</p>

  <p>"Hilda!" He managed only a whisper. She did not move.</p>

  <p>There were ropes around her ankles, her wrists. But there was also a rope
  about her neck. This did not go around the beam on which she lay. It went
  straight up. It went over a hook in the broken ceiling and came down again.
  Its other end was fastened to the beam to which Hal Curtin himself was bound,
  and it was just short of tautness. Beneath Hilda's ear the looped rope was
  tied with a hangman's slipknot.</p>

  <p>"Hilda!"</p>

  <p>She did not hear him. Could she hear him? Was she...?</p>

  <p>"She has fainted," someone said, the voice oddly familiar. "But she will
  come out of it in a moment." Curtin jumped, hearing it. The timber supporting
  him rocked. Its upper end started to slip from the cross-beam holding
  it...</p>

  <p><i>It was slipping off that cross-beam! A quarter inch more and it would
  come down&mdash;jerking tight the rope fastened to it, jerking tight the
  noose around Hilda's neck. Strangling her!</i></p>

  <p>It didn't. Not this time. Something steadied it, stopped that fearful
  rocking. A hand, Curtin saw as his head rolled, a great calloused paw with
  black, kinky hair on the backs of its fingers. He saw the owner of that hand,
  the madman!</p>

  <p>That fatuous, leering grin was still on the creature's face. In his other
  hand was still the metal lash with which he had toyed with the puffballs that
  had spewed the blackness.</p>

  <p>The same voice spoke again, from behind Curtin, where he could not see the
  speaker. "The next time Jock will let the timber come down," it said, "and
  you know what that will do. It may interest you to know also that the cords
  with which you are tied may be broken with not too great effort. You can free
  yourself, but not quickly enough to stop the beam from falling."</p>

  <p>There it was. Hal Curtin was imprisoned not by lashings that he might
  break, but by the knowledge that his escape meant&mdash;Hilda's death.</p>

  <p>"You fiend!" he grunted. "Who are you?" He had heard that voice before,
  many times. Was it because of his physical and mental agony that he could not
  identify it? It was&mdash;no, it could not be Reddon Gast's. Whose then?
  "Come around here where I can see you." The madman Jock was drawing his whip
  between his fingers, lovingly. What did he mean to do with it? What in the
  name of Satan was he going to do with that braided metal thong?</p>

  <p>"So that you can see me?" the Voice mused. "Well, it hardly matters now
  whether you see me or not, you will tell no one who I am. And your reaction
  will amuse us, perhaps, while we wait for your&mdash;sweetheart&mdash;to
  waken."</p>

  <p>There was a shuffle of feet on the hard-packed earthen floor. There was a
  flicker of Jock's eyes to the sound, the look of a fawning dog coming into
  them. And then a man moved into the range of Hal Curtin's vision.</p>

  <p>He was tall and gnarled. His hair was a lustrous white mane crowning a
  face seamed by deep lines, sunken-cheeked, with eyes that now gleamed
  wildly.</p>

  <p>"Wayne!" burst from Hal Curtin's lips.</p>

  <p>Wayne gave a humorless smile. "Clever of you to recognize me. As clever as
  your guessing how that fire was started, and how the theatre balcony was
  brought down, and that this was Jock's lair. You are a very clever man, Hal
  Curtin. I wonder if you have reasoned out the connection of the puffballs
  with all that has happened."</p>

  <p>Curtin's brow knitted. Perhaps by humoring his captor he would gain enough
  time to work out some escape for Hilda, from this imprisonment, from the
  threat of the lash Jock fondled. "They're not quite&mdash;natural. The
  blackness. Some variation in them has increased their spore-puff to a vast
  cloud of blackness. Perhaps the puffballs were treated chemically, carefully
  grown, crossed with unknown varieties. This cloud cloaked Jock when he was
  setting the fire, when he was mining the theatre balcony.</p>

  <p>"Not Jock," Wayne grinned. "Not Jock. He was to be the scapegoat, the
  whipping boy, taking the blame if some human agency were uncovered in
  connection with the disasters. The spore-cloud cloaked me, Hal Curtin. It was
  I who..."</p>

  <p>"You!" the bound man gasped, the unbelievable truth against which his mind
  had rebelled was now stark and inescapable. "You are the one..."</p>

  <p>"Yes." Wayne's features were no longer kindly. They were dark and
  contorted with evil triumph, and evil leered from beneath his shaggy brow. "I
  set the fire, I mined the balcony..." He laughed, and there was the same
  fierce pain in his laugh as in Jock's.</p>

  <p>"You," Curtin groaned. "But why...?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" Tiny light worms crawled in Wayne's slitted eyes. "You can ask
  that, when... But I forgot. You were not born when Stalton damned my brother
  to horror."</p>

  <p>"Your brother?"</p>

  <p>The old man's tortured look went to Jock, who was leaning forward now, his
  avid tongue licking his lips, his burning look fastened on Hilda's nude
  beauty.</p>

  <p>"They were too penurious to pave the streets," Wayne grated. "Jock, a fine
  young lad, slipped in the mud as he played, sprawled into the gutter. The
  hoof of a passing horse just flicked his skull&mdash;and made him what you
  see.</p>

  <p>"It was murder, the assassination of a soul, but they called it an
  accident, and I believed them. Dreamer that I was, I dedicated my life to
  making certain no such accident should occur again, to making Stalton a safe
  place for its children, for their lives, and a beautiful place for their
  play. Stalton thanked me with its lips but always behind their eyes, behind
  the eyes of Gast and Yarrow and the others who knew, I could see the taunting
  mockery, the reminder of my brother, an animal imprisoned within the asylum's
  grey walls.</p>

  <p>"He was the only human I ever loved; I was lonely, and they had made me
  so. I grieved, and it was because of what they had done that I grieved. But I
  forgave them, because I thought they knew not what they had done. I forgave
  them&mdash;till once more, because of greed, they were determined to enrich
  themselves at the price of the soul of that which I loved, of this town I had
  created&mdash;my all. If I allowed that road to be put through it would have
  taken the town from me.</p>

  <p>"I knew then what I had to do. <i>They</i> should not kill Stalton, I
  would, and swiftly. Station's soul was its children; its children should
  die... Stalton had taken the soul of my brother&mdash;I would take the limbs
  and lives of its children."</p>

  <p>Jock grunted. His shaggy, muscled arm thrust out, jabbing a thumb at
  Hilda. She stirred, and her eyes opened...</p>

  <p>"Hal!" she exclaimed, joy flaring into her tear-streaked countenance.
  "Hal...! You've come for..." and then all the joy was gone; terror, anguish
  were replacing it. "But you're tied up too. He's got you...!"</p>

  <p>"I've got him," Wayne broke in. "As I planned. I've got him to punish him
  for interfering with me in the way that will hurt him most, and Jock will
  take the blame for that as he would have done for all else if he had been
  caught. Jock! Go ahead."</p>

  <p>The madman whimpered, like a grateful dog, sprang forward. The whip in his
  hand lifted. The metal lash whistled up, whistled down...</p>

  <p>Struck Hilda's flesh! A fiery circle sprang out upon it, a bleeding
  cincture belting her palpitating breast. She screamed...</p>

  <p>Hal screamed too, screamed mad blasphemy as that biting whip flashed up,
  flashed down again on the naked flesh of the girl he loved. Screamed wild
  oaths at the madman, at the white-haired man who stood, impassive, eyes
  glittering, and lips tight and white. Hal yelled his protests, but he did not
  dare to move, did not dare to stir so much as a finger lest he rock the beam
  upon which he lay and bring it thundering down to strangle the life out of
  her.</p>

  <p>Whirr, <i>smack!</i> Whirr, <i>smack!</i> The madman was laughing now, was
  laughing and capering as he had laughed and capered before. He was dancing
  about his victim, her flesh netted with weals now, with spurting wounds, her
  round soft body clothed with scarlet from her wounds... He laughed...</p>

  <p>And Hilda moaned; "Kill me, Hal! Kill me! I want to die."</p>

  <p>There it was! That was the way he could save her from this agony.
  Death&mdash;the only gift for her lover to give her. His muscles knotted,
  ready for the leap...</p>

  <p>And still he waited while that whistling lash cut, and cut again, winding
  itself about an olive, quivering thigh, slashing across a taut abdomen. While
  a beast-man capered...</p>

  <p>Then Hal Curtin leaped, tearing loose from the cords that lashed him. The
  beam leaped with him, crashed down...</p>

  <p>On the head, the shoulders, of the madman, crushing Jock's skull and
  pulping his addled brain! It was held for a moment, as Hal had planned it, by
  the great shaggy form that had danced beneath its slant, held there long
  enough for Hal to tear free the noose from his sweetheart's neck&mdash;and
  then it crashed, with the bulk of the creature it had slain, to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>But Curtin had whirled, had thrown himself, ravening and mad himself in
  that moment, at the white-haired Wayne. Curtin's fists, sledge-hammers of
  vengeance, catapulted&mdash;smash&mdash;smash&mdash;into the hollow-cheeked
  countenance of the madman's brother.</p>

  <p><i>Smash!</i> There was the crack of snapped bone. Those furious blows had
  broken John Wayne's jaw&mdash;had broken John Wayne's spine...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">LONG after, Hilda Curtin would wake from a dream of
  never-to-be-forgotten terror, and Hal would wake with her.</p>

  <p>She would turn to him, and he would take her in his arms and hold her
  close to him, knowing as lovers always know, why she was trembling so. And
  after awhile the trembling would cease, and Hilda would whisper, "Hold me,
  Hal. Hold me close, close, so I'll know you're here, so I'll know that
  always, always, you will protect me against..."</p>

  <p>"Satan and all his imps," Hal would whisper. "Forever, my dear."</p>

  <p>And he would hold her close...</p>
