<h2>The Cuneiform Inscription<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Melville Davisson Post</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Published 1922</h3>

<hr>

<p>It was the signal that I had so long awaited. I had just come in
when the porter brought me the telegram. I was wet, my riding boots
were covered with mud, and I was tired. I had been all day in the
saddle at a distant meet of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds. We
had killed in a great wooded gorge beyond Porlock; the rain had
fallen constantly, and the vast moors, covered with heather and
gorse, swept by the gusts of rain, were like a sponge. A call to a
ninety-mile run in a motor on this evening of early September was a
thing to shudder at. But I received it with a great upward sweep of
the heart! The thing which I knew would eventually happen had
arrived, and it was bringing my golden hour with its wreckage.</p>

<p>I sat in the long hall of the hotel; a rain-drenched,
mud-splashed figure with a sun-filled face. I must have seemed a
strange creature to the hunting folk who passed and the servants
who came to take my directions. I was a strange creature; one is
always a strange creature when the event on which his life is
turning begins to come up in the sky line!</p>

<p>I ordered the best in the kitchen and the cellar, and went up to
my rooms for a hot bath and clothes for the road.</p>

<p>Her house was falling in about her, and she had sent for me! At
last the thing I had to offer would have a value. That which was
nothing to her when she thought her fortune was inexhaustible would
now mean the things she could not give up: the stud of hunters in
the Dukes country; the string of polo ponies here in Somerset; the
gowns, the jewels, all the extravaganza of a gilded life! Two hours
later I was on the road north. The big American roadster moved
under my hands like a live thing. My driver was in the box behind.
I wished some outlet for the inexhaustible vigor that possessed me.
The day in the saddle had been nothing; this night in the rain and
the dark was nothing. I had the strength of ten like the Galahad of
legend&mdash;but not for his noble reason. The love of a woman
moved me. Would she take, now, what I had vainly offered for three
months in England?</p>

<p>For what else could her cryptic telegram say&mdash;come?</p>

<p>I knew something from the daily press. Her man of business had
hanged himself in London and she was bankrupt; the very house over
her head would go. The thing had fallen like an arrow out of the
sky; in a moment, as at a witch word; as at the striking of a
clock, she had only a pumpkin coach, mice, and the rags of an
evening dress&mdash;and I raced to her with the fairy lamp that
would restore them!</p>

<p>It was a devil's night; a cold chill on the fields, rain, no
breath of wind, a vague darkness that seemed to make the visible
objects only more indistinct. But it was a night in character with
the event. The evil spirit of that hanged man of business would
have some favor of the elements&mdash;some luck yet. He had
surprised every solicitor in London.</p>

<p>His father and his father's father had handled the business of
this family for a century with care, with that extreme caution that
one can find only in a dingy English office, up two flights of
stairs. The hanged man had, in particular, an exclusive control of
this estate. The girl's uncle, that eccentric old antiquarian Sir
Hector Bartlett, would not be bothered with a business matter. His
signature was all the concern Sir Hector granted, and that went
over finally to the man of business in a power of attorney to sign.
Sir Hector was usually in the East, engrossed with the lost
languages of Asia.</p>

<p>He was the greatest authority in the world on these lost
languages; he was the one authority. When one mentioned Sir Hector,
the learned societies about in the world, so to speak, uncovered.
But they had a notion, these learned societies, that toward the end
he was mad&mdash;perhaps it was out of his bitter contempt for a
slower wit; perhaps it was the puzzle he left them for an
inheritance, after he had deciphered the great inscription of
Darius on the rocks at Behistun and got what it concealed. The
learned men said the inscription Sir Hector left for them was an
absurdity; but Sir Hector, dying, said it would fit their wits, and
the one that could decipher it would get what he had dug up in
Asia.</p>

<p>At any rate, unfortunately, the power to sign given by Sir
Hector had been extended by his niece, and the man of business had
flung the fortune into every wild thing that the intelligence of
crooks could bring in to him&mdash;as though caution in his race,
pressed too far, had gone awfully drunken. The thing had the
completeness of a curse&mdash;as though the gods of the ancient
races, violated in their sanctuaries by Sir Hector, had taken their
vengeance on his heir. I smiled in the darkness. If such powers
were the authors of this disaster they would not stand aside while
I came in to the rescue; they would ditch the car. And the next
moment the car very nearly was ditched. A human figure appeared
suddenly in the road before me, and to avoid it I skirted the
coping of an open bridge. The car skidded and stopped, with a rear
wheel within an inch of the edge.</p>

<p>The figure came forward into the light and hailed me. Would I
take him up? I could not see the man's face distinctly, but there
was something in the voice that was familiar; somewhere, in some
distant memory, I had known that voice. It was the voice of a
gentleman by some vague quality remaining in it. And so, uncertain
whom I had before me, I took him up. But when he had climbed beside
me into the seat I was disillusioned. His drenched clothes had
about them the odors of a dirty ship, and the man was drunk. His
voice was thick, and he had the abominable familiarity of
rum-soaked creatures.</p>

<p>He talked; he was going a long way; he had landed in England on
this afternoon; he was going to see his godchild. I would be
surprised, I would be amazed to know who his godchild was! How far
did I go on the road? I hoped to get rid of him, and so told the
truth. I would turn at the next crossing for Red House, sixty miles
to the north.</p>

<p>The creature tittered. "That's luck," he stuttered in the laugh;
"there's where I'm going."</p>

<p>I stopped the car and turned a flash on him. What mysterious
creature had I taken up?</p>

<p>At first I was unable to attach a memory; a foul, sodden face
appeared under a dirty cap; red-lidded eyes, blue sagging jowls, a
nose swollen with liquor, and a slack mouth. It was the face of the
worst human derelict I ever saw, and yet its abominations were laid
down over something that was well bred in the beast. The creature
had one time been a gentleman, but a gentleman gone with every
loathsome bestiality to the pit.</p>

<p>"Do you know me, eh, what?" The sodden voice was in a sort of
friendly whine.</p>

<p>And all at once I did know him.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" I said. "It's Backmartin!"</p>

<p>"Righto!" The whine went up into a little triumphant note. "Lord
Backmartin of the Downs in the old day." He buttoned his
rain-soaked rag of a coat, and drew his flabby body together in the
seat.</p>

<p>"The best back in England, if I do say it...did you see me in
the match with the Americans in 'ninety? Great polo, believe
me...they win now, these Americans, but we rode 'em off in 'ninety.
Did you see me pick out the ball in the last chukker and carry it
through to their goal with every devil's son of them after
me?...Did you see that game, eh, what? Were you there?" I was
there, and I did see it!</p>

<p>The goals were coming up slowly, and one-all was the score up to
within three minutes of the last bell. Hudson of the Americans was
carrying the ball toward the English end. Victory was in their
hands, when Lord Rose cut the ball out by a sort of accident and
shouted to Backmartin to take it. And he did take it like a god;
the ball went like an arrow; near-side and off-side were alike to
him. He had the fastest pony in England; no one of the Americans
could reach him; the ball, speeding like a bullet, crossed the goal
before the bell rang.</p>

<p>Backmartin was the hero of England on that day.</p>

<p>The Downs joined Red House, where a daughter was newly born to
the sporting squire who was brother to Sir Hector Bartlett, and so
Backmartin had stood&mdash;at the next weekend&mdash;in the little
chapel at Red House, as godfather to her. And here he was!</p>

<p>I fumbled about the levers and got the car ahead.</p>

<p>What should I do with him?</p>

<p>He was unspeakable. His reputation for seven years in England
had been beyond words; and for seven more years his name had not
been mentioned. He had been in China, in the Malay Peninsula, in
the South Seas. Word of the creature came only when some of the
great missionary organizations asked to have him expelled from a
district for pretending to be a member of its order. The wrath of
God was in their insistence to the Foreign Office. Backmartin and
his abominations must get out; and he would journey to some new
field of endeavor.</p>

<p>The creature was unspeakable.</p>

<p>And here he was riding with me on a journey to his goddaughter.
I was twisted in Satan's fingers. If I put him down I would have no
line on the hell plan that he came with. And how could I take him
on?</p>

<p>I considered the damned thing as we raced north, and while the
creature driveled.</p>

<p>He would be going out of his missionary trade&mdash;true it had
its benefits, and the customs of the patriarchs as he taught them
in the old book of the Scriptures came easy to the savage&mdash;but
there was a fortune in rum running just now northwest of the
Barbados if he could fit a ship. His goddaughter would no doubt be
glad to help him&mdash;he mentioned a pensioner in her house as the
alternative. So that was what the beast was after. And I carried
him forward on that purpose; to force a levy for his rum running by
the threat of sitting in her door! I could have killed the creature
and thrown his rotten carcass into a ditch. My fingers itched for a
clutch on him. But when I thought the matter calmly out, there
seemed, after all, only one thing to do. I must hold him under my
eye until I could get him out of England&mdash;when one fought the
devil one needed to keep him in the light.</p>

<p>I took him on!</p>

<p>There is a long flag-paved terrace on the garden side of Red
House, with casement doors entering the library and the
drawing-room. It was very nearly midnight, and the strange events
that I set out to write down here were on their way. The night had
cleared; the air was warm and sweet as from distant hayfields; the
stars were out.</p>

<p>And I waited on this terrace for the woman God denied me!</p>

<p>She had gone a moment to make sure that Backmartin had every
comfort the house could give. He had already levied upon it for
every use; and now dined and bathed and shaven and in the old
squire's evening clothes, he sat in a great leather chair smoking a
Havana, with a bottle of Burgundy opened beside him. I could see
the smug creature through the glass doors to the library.</p>

<p>It raised the bristles on me. The transformation in this
derelict seemed only to make him more perfidious. He blew the smoke
thinly out at the corners of his slack mouth, lying back in the
chair, his half-closed, red-lidded eyes on the little long-smoked
frame above the mantelshelf containing the cuneiform inscription
that Sir Hector had left, as a jest, for his contemporaries.</p>

<p>It was painted in India ink on a strip of vellum.</p>

<p>Two things had reduced me from the starry spaces: that
Backmartin should be welcomed as a royal guest, and that I should
be called here to be thanked for all my courtesies, and dismissed
out of her life. My suit was now impossible. She would go up to
London on tomorrow to seek some way to live and keep her
selfrespect.</p>

<p>She wished to see me while a day of the old life remained. It
was a whim I must forgive her. It had put me to some discomfort and
a heavy journey; but she wished to say good-by while she remained
an equal.</p>

<p>I offered my fairy lamp in vain to her.</p>

<p>I had far more than she imagined. I was, in fact, absurdly rich.
What would be needed to clear off every debt I could advance out of
an idle income. But she only shook her heavenly head at me. It
would be a bribe now! And on that, as on an iron pike, I was
impaled. If the thing had been possible before, did I not see that
it was now out of the question? When she had a fortune, too, it was
myself I offered, and she could consider that, but I offered a
bribe now, and she could not take a bribe!</p>

<p>Did I not see how the bribe would taint her? When my blood had
cooled, something would whisper to me, "And so it was these baubles
that she wanted." She could not face a life against that whisper.
And the abominable thing about it was that I was permitted to see
how very nearly I had won her. All along she had been extremely
fond of me; my admiration of her had not gone unnoticed. She had
been attracted to me. We had tastes in common. She might have come
in time to consider what I offered. That I was older by some twenty
years had been no matter. Women wished experience of life in men
and a tough fiber; one could not trust oneself to a callow boy.
Youth was selfish, and it was, in particular, this unselfishness of
man that a woman longed for.</p>

<p>I walked the great length of the terrace with my fingers locked
behind me. What sort of devil was it that ran the world?</p>

<p>In my abstraction I struck my foot against the square of tiles
laid down on the terrace as a sort of step before the library door
and caught the latch to keep my balance. The noise brought
Backmartin up in his chair, and he called to me.</p>

<p>"Oh! I say, come in."</p>

<p>And I had to go in. I could not have the beast feel that I was
spying on him. I pretended to be seeking a match for my cigarette.
I got one from his candlestick on the table and turned to go out,
but he stopped me.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it was a word or a gesture that arrested
my attention. I thought the beast, at his ease and with his cocky
air, was now more loathsome. One could bear with him, perhaps, in
his misery and in his habiliments of squalor, but cleaned and fed
and comfortable and turned out for a gentleman he was beyond the
patience of the saints. And yet I had to treat him with the
courtesies of a guest&mdash;a distinguished guest in this country
house; a godfather of this girl welcomed back to England!</p>

<p>He made a little gesture toward the framed strip of vellum on
the mantelpiece. "Is that the old cock's secret cipher?"</p>

<p>I said it was the puzzle Sir Hector Bartlett had left to his
contemporaries: two crowned Assyrian figures preceded by two
wedge-signs; followed by a cuneiform inscription, all painted in
India ink on a strip of vellum.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," he said.</p>

<p>I loathed the creature, but I could not fail in what my hostess
would expect of me with a guest. And I told him what was well known
about the thing.</p>

<p>Sir Hector Bartlett had been the ablest Assyriologist in Europe.
Under his hands the ancient writing in Asia had taken the
completeness and the uniformity of a national language; before him
these languages had been mere fragments puzzled out; and with a
large conception he had welded these fragments together and shown
this to have been the learned written speech of a great vanished
age in Asia. This big conception had lifted the whole thing onto an
elevated plane; it had laid forever the claims of Halévy that this
wedge-writing was a mere cabalistic script of the Sumerian priests.
He had shown it to be the speech of a people.</p>

<p>But the little skepticisms of his contemporaries had enraged Sir
Hector. He said they were pretentious persons fit to work out
puzzles, and so he had left a puzzle for them in his will. Let them
work it out and they would find the treasure that he had found by
deciphering the great inscription of Darius on the rocks of
Behistun.</p>

<p>"Did he find a treasure?"</p>

<p>Backmartin cut in, shooting out his head with a sort of
reptilian eagerness. I explained that such was the common rumor at
the time. He was known to have got some concession from the Crown
to confirm his right in what he might discover, and a report was
current that the Louvre had offered him seventy thousand pounds for
what he had shown the director of fine arts in Paris on his way
home.</p>

<p>"What did he show him?"</p>

<p>The reptilian gesture was even, if possible, more eager in its
appeal.</p>

<p>One did not know, I went on; there was every conjecture.
Backmartin's big, loose face worked like soft rubber.</p>

<p>"And he said that thing up there," he indicated the mantel with
his hand, "would tell where he hid it, if anybody could understand
what it meant?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And what did the other learned Johnnies say about it?"</p>

<p>They said it was nonsense, I continued. They said it was an
absurdity on its face. No inscription ever had two royal figures
drawn in; the wedge was never inclined to the left; it was always
pointed toward the right, or downward or aslant to the right, or
two combined at their heads to form an angle. They said no word or
syllable or gunu-sign of either the Persian, Susian, or Babylonian
language was indicated; they said the thing was a hoax.</p>

<p>"But the old cock said they were only fit for puzzles, didn't
he?&mdash;an' he would make one to fit their wits&mdash;eh,
what?"</p>

<p>It was what Sir Hector had uttered about it, I told him. He held
these learned men in a bitter contempt. Their knowledge of
deciphering inscriptions, he said, was confined to the Black
Cabinets of Berlin and Vienna, and their knowledge of Assyriology
to the sacred books of the Jews&mdash;he would leave them an
inscription within the zone of their intelligence.</p>

<p>I heard the casement door of the drawing-room to the terrace
open, and I went out, Backmartin followed me with a sharp look. He
had grasped the situation. He knew that things had gone to pieces
and why I came; some of it by inquiry, no doubt, and the remainder
by a sort of instinct. He was slack and despicable&mdash; baggy in
the chair&mdash;and the glance seemed to emerge from a trace, in
the beast, of something firmer.</p>

<p>I found Marjorie on the terrace; and I advanced toward her as
toward something heavenly and denied. She was lovely beyond any
descriptive words that I can write here. To catalogue her would be
to give no adequate impression. Dark hair, and great deep eyes, and
the alluring figure of a Nereid are not descriptive phrases, but
they are fragments of fancy that another man&mdash;to know the
thing I mean&mdash;must fit his own beloved woman into.</p>

<p>I loved her, and, to me, she possessed the charm of dreams.</p>

<p>And now that God denied her to me I adored her more. There is
this quality, strange and bitter, in a loss, that it doubles the
value of the thing removed; when it is gone once, wholly, one sees
with an uncanny clearness how incomparable it was. To-night this
terrace was some delicate, vague kingdom of illusion. It would
presently vanish. There would be only an hour of it with her. And
it seemed to me, as I walked slowly beside her the length of the
flag-paved terrace, that this hour was priceless. Into it the
mysterious purpose of every day that I had lived, of every day that
I would yet live, seemed to converge, and to escape with the sound
of my footsteps moving on the flag. I must convince her! And I
labored to that end with every argument, with every insistence. And
in the vague light I noted every detail of her: the long lashes,
the exquisite mouth, the slender body. But it was not these visible
things, however potent, that so wholly overcame me. It was a thing
for which we have no word, of which there is no material evidence,
that moved subtly from this girl into every fiber of me. The
perennial charm of romance attended her. She came forth from haze,
from shadow; there clung about her the freshness, the mystery of
those fairy women that the soul of a man eternally longs for.</p>

<p>And unless I could persuade her, she was lost to me!</p>

<p>I cannot remember what I said; it must have been to offer what I
had, to replace the things this disaster had swept out. My
insistence must have revolved about this fixed idea; for she would
only shake her heavenly head. I must not bribe her&mdash;she could
not take a bribe.</p>

<p>I looked up finally like a man sinking in the pit, and I saw,
beyond her across the terrace, a face pressed against the glass
door of the library. For a moment the face seemed
unfamiliar&mdash;or was I unhinged by my emotion?&mdash;there was
something fine in it; something having a momentary control;
something that had no proper being in the sodden features;
something long submerged, trodden down, filth-covered, in a sort of
awful effort to get on its feet.</p>

<p>Then the face relaxed into its vacuous abominations, and
Backmartin opened the door.</p>

<p>"Oh! I say," he called to us, "if I might have a Bible I would
read a chapter before I turn in&mdash;it's a sort of habit, y'
know."</p>

<p>I had to turn, sharp, to conceal the disgust in me. But Marjorie
went in to him with some courteous word&mdash;I don't
remember&mdash;found a big old family Bible on a shelf among the
dictionaries, and put it on his table. He was stooping over it when
she came out to me.</p>

<p>She made no comment.</p>

<p>And I returned to my labor of a cursed Sisyphus. But I changed
the tenor of it. If we must be equal before she would listen to me,
then I would make us equal. If she would not be as well off as I
was, then I would be as poor as she. I would abandon what I had,
and we would go empty-handed into some new land. I was as good a
man as that first one in Asia. I would till the earth and build a
home and face the wilderness for her. And I would do it like one
who finds a kingdom! We would go this very night, the two of us,
with nothing. We would step out of the world leaving forever the
rubbish of these great possessions!</p>

<p>She looked at me with a high face.</p>

<p>She stood with her arms hanging, her lips parted, her slender
face gleaming like a flower; her hair spun darkness&mdash;her great
eyes on me as though she saw a man there that she had never seen
before.</p>

<p>Then a voice startled us as from another world.</p>

<p>Backmartin was standing before the library, with his hand on the
latch of the closed door behind him. He was speaking to us, he was
making some interrogation. Whether he had come out at that moment,
or been there a long time, I do not know.</p>

<p>My forbearance with the beast very nearly went to pieces; but
something in the voice, something strange, peculiar, unlike the
creature, restrained me. "Is any place about this house paved with
stones?"</p>

<p>There was an unstable quality in Backmartin's voice, as though
it issued from one holding himself together with an immense effort.
And there was sincerity in it. I could not see the man's face.</p>

<p>"This terrace," I said, "is paved."</p>

<p>He came running out, at that, and over the whole length of the
terrace. Then he came back to the library door and stood with his
hand pressed against his mouth as in some reflection.</p>

<p>"But upon it!" he said. "There is nothing upon it."</p>

<p>Then he flung the door open.</p>

<p>"Come in here," he said.</p>

<p>We went in behind him.</p>

<p>I was astonished at the man when the light uncovered him. He was
the Backmartin of the old days; a ruin of that man, surely, and yet
the man returned as by some sorcery into a brief, unstable control
of this debauched, abandoned creature. That this control was
unstable, at the virtue of a breaking effort, and uncertain of
continuance, the aspect of him and the quavering voice evidenced.
But while it held the ruin of the man together it gave that ruin a
certain authority of life and a certain dignity of manner.</p>

<p>"And put it upon a pavement of stones!" he repeated; "that's the
direction, 'upon a pavement of stones.'"</p>

<p>"What direction?" I said. "What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>He indicated the vellum with its cuneiform inscription above the
mantel.</p>

<p>"The direction in that cipher," he replied. "It says, 'upon a
pavement of stones.'"</p>

<p>"You have deciphered that inscription?" I was incredulous.
"After all the learned men in Europe failed on it?"</p>

<p>A faint smile struggled into his tense, hard-held face.</p>

<p>"Did not Sir Hector say that their knowledge of Assyriology was
confined to the sacred books of the Jews, and that they were only
fit to work out puzzles?&mdash; well, that's what it is, a puzzle,
connected with the sacred books of the Jews!"</p>

<p>He went over to the mantel and took up the framed inscription.
He put his finger on the two royal Assyrian figures.</p>

<p>"That's a 'King,'" he said; "there are two of them, that would
be 'Kings,' and there are two wedges before them, that would be two
'Kings.' And the remainder of it is made up of cuneiform characters
put together to form the reference in Roman numerals: sixteen,
seventeen, five. That is to say: 'Two Kings, sixteen, seventeen,
five.' That would be 'Second Kings, chapter sixteen, verse
seventeen, line five.'"</p>

<p>He turned about and put his big finger on a line of the Bible
open on the table before him.</p>

<p>"And that line says: 'And put it upon a pavement of stones.'" He
turned about to us. "Somewhere on a pavement of stones Sir Hector
has concealed whatever it was that he brought out of Asia."</p>

<p>We looked at him in a sort of wonder. The girl's fingers were on
my arm; she was tense now in a consuming interest.</p>

<p>Backmartin went on: "The terrace out there is paved with stones,
and if this verse said under a pavement of stones I would know
where to look. But it doesn't say under; it says upon...now, how
could it be upon that terrace? There's nothing upon it."</p>

<p>Marjorie suddenly cried out as with an inspiration. "But there
is something 'upon it'; there is a square of tiles laid down before
this door; they would be 'upon' it."</p>

<p>Backmartin stood up at that; he looked a moment at the mosaic
making a wide step before the door. Then he turned to me.</p>

<p>"Your car is standing out there; get a chisel and a hammer from
the tool box."</p>

<p>I got the implements and we raised the tiles. Under them, upon
the flag pavement, was a thin, square copper box. We took it into
the library and put it on the table. No one spoke.</p>

<p>Backmartin carried the box, and we followed after him. He put it
on the table. And then he did an inexplicable thing. He went on
through the library door into the hall. I thought he went to seek a
tool to cut the copper, and I followed. I found him in the hall
putting on my greatcoat. In the light his contorted face was
covered with sweat.</p>

<p>"Awaken your driver," he said, "and get me to the coast."</p>

<p>I hesitated in my profound astonishment.</p>

<p>And he turned suddenly on me, the sweat trickling in the lines
of his hardpressed, dreadful face.</p>

<p>"Hurry, man." He very nearly spat on me in his extremity.</p>

<p>I stood outside, with my head uncovered, until the roar of the
car racing south was a faint echo. Then I went in. Marjorie was
standing by the library table. She had got the lid of the box
unfastened, and within were row upon row of emeralds, big,
gleaming, priceless.</p>

<p>But I was not happy. I felt a little man beside the big one who
was gone. God, only, in His heaven knew the mortal struggle of this
damned creature, or the dreadful thing he had considered and been
held back from by the thin line of something noble that never
wholly dies in us.</p>

<p>I spoke to the girl, looking strangely at me, from her place
beyond the box of jewels.</p>

<p>"You will never love me?"</p>

<p>"Never!" she said, "...never, but for what has happened on this
night."</p>

<p>"The finding of the emeralds?"</p>

<p>She made a gesture as of one who tosses away a bauble.</p>

<p>"The finding of a man...out there on the terrace...when I was
poor."</p>
