<h2><a id="shadows1" name="shadows1">CHAPTER 1</a></h2>

<p class="first">A SWIFT crashing of horses through the tall
reeds; a heavy fall, a despairing cry. From the dying steed there
staggered up its rider, a slender girl in sandals and girdled
tunic. Her dark hair fell over her white shoulders, her eyes were
those of a trapped animal. She did not look at the jungle of
reeds that hemmed in the little clearing, nor at the blue waters
that lapped the low shore behind her. Her wide-eyed gaze was
fixed in agonized intensity on the horseman who pushed through
the reedy screen and dismounted before her.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, slender, but hard as steel. From head to
heel he was clad in light silvered mesh-mail that fitted his
supple form like a glove. From under the dome-shaped, gold-chased
helmet his brown eyes regarded her mockingly.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" her voice shrilled with terror. "Touch me not,
Shah Amurath, or I will throw myself into the water and
drown!"</p>

<p>He laughed, and his laughter was like the purr of a sword
sliding from a silken sheath.</p>

<p>"No, you will not drown, Olivia, daughter of confusion, for
the marge is too shallow, and I can catch you before you can
reach the deeps. You gave me a merry chase, by the gods, and all
my men are far behind us. But there is no horse west of Vilayet
that can distance Irem for long." He nodded at the tall, slender-legged desert stallion behind him.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" begged the girl, tears of despair staining her
face. "Have I not suffered enough? Is there any humiliation, pain
or degradation you have not heaped on me? How long must my
torment last?"</p>

<p>"As long as I find pleasure in your whimperings, your pleas,
tears and writhings," he answered with a smile that would have
seemed gentle to a stranger. "You are strangely virile, Olivia. I
wonder if I shall ever weary of you, as I have always wearied of
women before. You are ever fresh and unsullied, in spite of me.
Each new day with you brings a new delight.</p>

<p>"But come&mdash;let us return to Akif, where the people are
still feting the conqueror of the miserable kozaki; while he, the
conqueror, is engaged in recapturing a wretched fugitive, a
foolish, lovely, idiotic runaway!"</p>

<p>"No!" She recoiled, turning toward the waters lapping bluely
among the reeds.</p>

<p>"Yes!" His flash of open anger was like a spark struck from
flint. With a quickness her tender limbs could not approximate,
he caught her wrist, twisting it in pure wanton cruelty until she
screamed and sank to her knees.</p>

<p>"Slut! I should drag you back to Akif at my horse's tail, but
I will be merciful and carry you on my saddle-bow, for which
favor you shall humbly thank me, while&mdash;"</p>

<p>He released her with a startled oath and sprang back, his
saber flashing out, as a terrible apparition burst from the reedy
jungle sounding an inarticulate cry of hate.</p>

<p>Olivia, staring up from the ground, saw what she took to be
either a savage or a madman advancing on Shah Amurath in an
attitude of deadly menace. He was powerfully built, naked but for
a girdled loin-cloth, which was stained with blood and crusted
with dried mire. His black mane was matted with mud and clotted
blood; there were streaks of dried blood on his chest and limbs,
dried blood on the long straight sword he gripped in his right
hand. From under the tangle of his locks, bloodshot eyes glared
like coals of blue fire.</p>

<p>"You Hyrkanian dog!" mouthed this apparition in a barbarous
accent. "The devils of vengeance have brought you here!"</p>

<p>"Kozak!" ejaculated Shah Amurath, recoiling. "I did not know a
dog of you escaped! I thought you all lay stiff on the steppe, by
Ilbars River."</p>

<p>"All but me, damn you!" cried the other. "Oh, I've dreamed of
such a meeting as this, while I crawled on my belly through the
brambles, or lay under rocks while the ants gnawed my flesh, or
crouched in the mire up to my mouth&mdash;I dreamed, but never
hoped it would come to pass. Oh, gods of Hell, how I have yearned
for this!"</p>

<p>The stranger's bloodthirsty joy was terrible to behold. His
jaws champed spasmodically, froth appeared on his blackened
lips.</p>

<p>"Keep back!" ordered Shah Amurath, watching him narrowly.</p>

<p>"Ha!" It was like the bark of a timber wolf. "Shah Amurath,
the great Lord of Akif! Oh, damn you, how I love the sight of
you&mdash;you, who fed my comrades to the vultures, who tore them
between wild horses, blinded and maimed and mutilated them all,
you dog, you filthy dog!" His voice rose to a maddened scream,
and he charged.</p>

<p>In spite of the terror of his wild appearance, Olivia looked
to see him fall at the first crossing of the blades. Madman or
savage, what could he do, naked, against the mailed chief of
Akif?</p>

<p>There was an instant when the blades flamed and licked,
seeming barely to touch each other and leap apart; then the
broadsword flashed past the saber and descended terrifically on
Shah Amurath's shoulder. Olivia cried out at the fury of that
stroke. Above the crunch of the rending mail, she distinctly
heard the snap of the shoulder-bone. The Hyrkanian reeled back,
suddenly ashen, blood spurting over the links of his hauberk; his
saber slipped from his nerveless fingers.</p>

<p>"Quarter!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Quarter?" There was a quiver of frenzy in the stranger's
voice. "Quarter such as you gave us, you swine!"</p>

<p>Olivia closed her eyes. This was no longer battle, but
butchery, frantic, bloody, impelled by an hysteria of fury and
hate, in which culminated the sufferings of battle, massacre,
torture, and fear-ridden, thirst-maddened, hunger-haunted flight.
Though Olivia knew that Shah Amurath deserved no mercy or pity
from any living creature, yet she closed her eyes and pressed her
hands over her ears, to shut out the sight of that dripping sword
that rose and fell with the sound of a butcher's cleaver, and the
gurgling cries that dwindled away and ceased.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes, to see the stranger turning away from a
gory travesty that only vaguely resembled a human being. The
man's breast heaved with exhaustion or passion; his brow was
beaded with sweat; his right hand was splashed with blood.</p>

<p>He did not speak to her, or even glance toward her. She saw
him stride through the reeds that grew at the water's edge,
stoop, and tug at something. A boat wallowed out of its hiding
place among the stalks. Then she divined his intention, and was
galvanized into action.</p>

<p>"Oh, wait!" she wailed, staggering up and running toward him.
"Do not leave me! Take me with you!"</p>

<p>He wheeled and stared at her. There was a difference in his
bearing. His bloodshot eyes were sane. It was as if the blood he
had just shed had quenched the fire of his frenzy.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am called Olivia. I was his captive. I ran away. He
followed me. That's why he came here. Oh, do not leave me here!
His warriors are not far behind him. They will find his
corpse&mdash;they will find me near it&mdash;oh!" She moaned in
her terror and wrung her white hands.</p>

<p>He stared at her in perplexity.</p>

<p>"Would you be better off with me?" he demanded. "I am a
barbarian, and I know from your looks that you fear me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I fear you," she replied, too distracted to dissemble.
"My flesh crawls at the horror of your aspect. But I fear the
Hyrkanians more. Oh, let me go with you! They will put me to the
torture if they find me beside their dead lord."</p>

<p>"Come, then." He drew aside, and she stepped quickly into the
boat, shrinking from contact with him. She seated herself in the
bow, and he stepped into the boat, pushed off with an oar, and
using it as a paddle, worked his way tortuously among the tall
stalks until they glided out into open water. Then he set to work
with both oars, rowing with great, smooth, even strokes, the
heavy muscles of arms and shoulders and back rippling in rhythm
to his exertions.</p>

<p>There was silence for some time, the girl crouching in the
bows, the man tugging at the oars. She watched him with timorous
fascination. It was evident that he was not an Hyrkanian, and he
did not resemble the Hyborian races. There was a wolfish hardness
about him that marked the barbarian. His features, allowing for
the strains and stains of battle and his hiding in the marshes,
reflected that same untamed wildness, but they were neither evil
nor degenerate.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked. "Shah Amurath called you a kozak;
were you of that band?"</p>

<p>"I am Conan, of Cimmeria," he grunted. "I was with the kozaki,
as the Hyrkanian dogs called us."</p>

<p>She knew vaguely that the land he named lay far to the
northwest, beyond the farthest boundaries of the different
kingdoms of her race.</p>

<p>"I am a daughter of the King of Ophir," she said. "My father
sold me to a Shemite chief, because I would not marry a prince of
Koth."</p>

<p>The Cimmerian grunted in surprize.</p>

<p>Her lips twisted in a bitter smile. "Aye, civilized men sell
their children as slaves to savages, sometimes. They call your
race barbaric, Conan of Cimmeria."</p>

<p>"We do not sell our children," he growled, his chin jutting
truculently.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I was sold. But the desert man did not misuse me.
He wished to buy the good will of Shah Amurath, and I was among
the gifts he brought to Akif of the purple gardens. Then&mdash;"
She shuddered and hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"I should be lost to all shame," she said presently. "Yet each
memory stings me like a slaver's whip. I abode in Shah Amurath's
palace, until some weeks agone he rode out with his hosts to do
battle with a band of invaders who were ravaging the borders of
Turan. Yesterday he returned in triumph, and a great fete was
made to honor him. In the drunkenness and rejoicing, I found an
opportunity to steal out of the city on a stolen horse. I had
thought to escape&mdash;but he followed, and about midday came up
with me. I outran his vassals, but him I could not escape. Then
you came."</p>

<p>"I was lying hid in the reeds," grunted the barbarian. "I was
one of those dissolute rogues, the Free Companions, who burned
and looted along the borders. There were five thousand of us,
from a score of races and tribes. We had been serving as
mercenaries for a rebel prince in eastern Koth, most of us, and
when he made peace with his cursed sovereign, we were out of
employment; so we took to plundering the outlying dominions of
Koth, Zamora and Turan impartially. A week ago Shah Amurath
trapped us near the banks of Ilbars with fifteen thousand men.
Mitra! The skies were black with vultures. When the lines broke,
after a whole day of fighting, some tried to break through to the
north, some to the west. I doubt if any escaped. The steppes were
covered with horsemen riding down the fugitives. I broke for the
east, and finally reached the edge of the marshes that border
this part of Vilayet.</p>

<p>"I've been hiding in the morasses ever since. Only the day
before yesterday the riders ceased beating up the reed-brakes,
searching for just such fugitives as I. I've squirmed and
burrowed and hidden like a snake, feasting on muskrats I caught
and ate raw, for lack of fire to cook them. This dawn I found
this boat hidden among the reeds. I hadn't intended going out on
the sea until night, but after I killed Shah Amurath, I knew his
mailed dogs would be close at hand."</p>

<p>"And what now?"</p>

<p>"We shall doubtless be pursued. If they fail to see the marks
left by the boat, which I covered as well as I could, they'll
guess anyway that we took to sea, after they fail to find us
among the marshes. But we have a start, and I'm going to haul at
these oars until we reach a safe place."</p>

<p>"Where shall we find that?" she asked hopelessly. "Vilayet is
an Hyrkanian pond."</p>

<p>"Some folk don't think so," grinned Conan grimly; "notably the
slaves that have escaped from galleys and become pirates."</p>

<p>"But what are your plans?"</p>

<p>"The southwestern shore is held by the Hyrkanians for hundreds
of miles. We still have a long way to go before we pass beyond
their northern boundaries. I intend to go northward until I think
we have passed them. Then we'll turn westward, and try to land on
the shore bordered by the uninhabited steppes."</p>

<p>"Suppose we meet pirates, or a storm?" she asked. "And we
shall starve on the steppes."</p>

<p>"Well," he reminded her, "I didn't ask you to come with
me."</p>

<p>"I am sorry." She bowed her shapely dark head. "Pirates,
storms, starvation&mdash;they are&mdash;all kinder than the
people of Turan."</p>

<p>"Aye." His dark face grew somber. "I haven't done with them
yet. Be at ease, girl. Storms are rare on Vilayet at this time of
year. If we make the steppes, we shall not starve. I was reared
in a naked land. It was those cursed marshes, with their stench
and stinging flies, that nigh unmanned me. I am at home in the
high lands. As for pirates&mdash;" He grinned enigmatically, and
bent to the oars.</p>

<p>The sun sank like a dull-glowing copper ball into a lake of
fire. The blue of the sea merged with the blue of the sky, and
both turned to soft dark velvet, clustered with stars and the
mirrors of stars. Olivia reclined in the bows of the gently
rocking boat, in a state dreamy and unreal. She experienced an
illusion that she was floating in midair, stars beneath her as
well as above. Her silent companion was etched vaguely against
the softer darkness. There was no break or falter in the rhythm
of his oars; he might have been a fantasmal oarsman, rowing her
across the dark lake of Death. But the edge of her fear was
dulled, and, lulled by the monotony of motion, she passed into a
quiet slumber.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>Dawn was in her eyes when she awakened, aware of a ravenous
hunger. It was a change in the motion of the boat that had roused
her; Conan was resting on his oars, gazing beyond her. She
realized that he had rowed all night without pause, and marvelled
at his iron endurance. She twisted about to follow his stare, and
saw a green wall of trees and shrubbery rising from the water's
edge and sweeping away in a wide curve, enclosing a small bay
whose waters lay still as blue glass.</p>

<p>"This is one of the many islands that dot this inland sea,"
said Conan. "They are supposed to be uninhabited. I've heard the
Hyrkanians seldom visit them. Besides, they generally hug the
shores in their galleys, and we have come a long way. Before
sunset we were out of sight of the mainland."</p>

<p>With a few strokes he brought the boat in to shore and made
the painter fast to the arching root of a tree which rose from
the water's edge. Stepping ashore, he reached out a hand to help
Olivia. She took it, wincing slightly at the bloodstains upon it,
feeling a hint of the dynamic strength that lurked in the
barbarian's thews.</p>

<p>A dreamy quiet lay over the woods that bordered the blue bay.
Then somewhere, far back among the trees, a bird lifted its
morning song. A breeze whispered through the leaves, and set them
to murmuring. Olivia found herself listening intently for
something, she knew not what. What might be lurking amid those
nameless woodlands?</p>

<p>As she peered timidly into the shadows between the trees,
something swept into the sunlight with a swift whirl of wings: a
great parrot which dropped on to a leafy branch and swayed there,
a gleaming image of jade and crimson. It turned its crested head
sidewise and regarded the invaders with glittering eyes of
jet.</p>

<p>"Crom!" muttered the Cimmerian. "Here is the grandfather of
all parrots. He must be a thousand years old! Look at the evil
wisdom of his eyes. What mysteries do you guard, Wise Devil?"</p>

<p>Abruptly the bird spread its flaming wings and, soaring from
its perch, cried out harshly: "Yagkoolan yok tha, xuthalla!" and
with a wild screech of horribly human laughter, rushed away
through the trees to vanish in the opalescent shadows.</p>

<p>Olivia stared after it, feeling the cold hand of nameless
foreboding touch her supple spine.</p>

<p>"What did it say?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Human words, I'll swear," answered Conan; "but in what tongue
I can't say."</p>

<p>"Nor I," returned the girl. "Yet it must have learned them
from human lips. Human, or&mdash;" she gazed into the leafy
fastness and shuddered slightly, without knowing why.</p>

<p>"Crom, I'm hungry!" grunted the Cimmerian. "I could eat a
whole buffalo. We'll look for fruit; but first I'm going to
cleanse myself of this dried mud and blood. Hiding in marshes is
foul business."</p>

<p>So saying, he laid aside his sword, and wading out shoulder-deep into the blue water, went about his ablutions. When he
emerged, his clean-cut bronze limbs shone, his streaming black
mane was no longer matted. His blue eyes, though they smoldered
with unquenchable fire, were no longer murky or bloodshot. But
the tigerish suppleness of limb and the dangerous aspect of
feature were not altered.</p>

<p>Strapping on his sword once more, he motioned the girl to
follow him, and they left the shore, passing under the leafy
arches of the great branches. Underfoot lay a short green sward
which cushioned their tread. Between the trunks of the trees they
caught glimpses of faery-like vistas.</p>

<p>Presently Conan grunted in pleasure at the sight of golden and
russet globes hanging in clusters among the leaves. Indicating
that the girl should seat herself on a fallen tree, he filled her
lap with the exotic delicacies, and then himself fell to with
unconcealed gusto.</p>

<p>"Ishtar!" said he, between mouthfuls. "Since Ilbars I have
lived on rats, and roots I dug out of the stinking mud. This is
sweet to the palate, though not very filling. Still, it will
serve if we eat enough."</p>

<p>Olivia was too busy to reply. The sharp edge of the
Cimmerian's hunger blunted, he began to gaze at his fair
companion with more interest than previously, noting the lustrous
clusters of her dark hair, the peach-bloom tints of her dainty
skin, and the rounded contours of her lithe figure which the
scanty silk tunic displayed to full advantage.</p>

<p>Finishing her meal, the object of his scrutiny looked up, and
meeting his burning, slit-eyed gaze, she changed color and the
remnants of the fruit slipped from her fingers.</p>

<p>Without comment, he indicated with a gesture that they should
continue their explorations, and rising, she followed him out of
the trees and into a glade, the farther end of which was bounded
by a dense thicket. As they stepped into the open there was a
ripping crash in this thicket, and Conan, bounding aside and
carrying the girl with him, narrowly saved them from something
that rushed through the air and struck a tree-trunk with a
thunderous impact.</p>

<p>Whipping out his sword, Conan bounded across the glade and
plunged into the thicket. Silence ensued, while Olivia crouched
on the sward, terrified and bewildered. Presently Conan emerged,
a puzzled scowl on his face.</p>

<p>"Nothing in that thicket," he growled. "But there was
something&mdash;"</p>

<p>He studied the missile that had so narrowly missed them, and
grunted incredulously, as if unable to credit his own senses. It
was a huge block of greenish stone which lay on the sward at the
foot of the tree, whose wood its impact had splintered.</p>

<p>"A strange stone to find on an uninhabited island," growled
Conan.</p>

<p>Olivia's lovely eyes dilated in wonder. The stone was a
symmetrical block, indisputably cut and shaped by human hands.
And it was astonishingly massive. The Cimmerian grasped it with
both hands, and with legs braced and the muscles standing out on
his arms and back in straining knots, he heaved it above his head
and cast it from him, exerting every ounce of nerve and sinew. It
fell a few feet in front of him. Conan swore.</p>

<p>"No man living could throw that rock across this glade. It's a
task for siege engines. Yet here there are no mangonels or
ballistas."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was thrown by some such engine from afar," she
suggested.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "It didn't fall from above. It came from
yonder thicket. See how the twigs are broken? It was thrown as a
man might throw a pebble. But who? What? Come!"</p>

<p>She hesitantly followed him into the thicket. Inside the outer
ring of leafy brush, the undergrowth was less dense. Utter
silence brooded over all. The springy sward gave no sign of
footprint. Yet from this mysterious thicket had hurtled that
boulder, swift and deadly. Conan bent closer to the sward, where
the grass was crushed down here and there. He shook his head
angrily. Even to his keen eyes it gave no clue as to what had
stood or trodden there. His gaze roved to the green roof above
their heads, a solid ceiling of thick leaves and interwoven
arches. And he froze suddenly.</p>

<p>Then rising, sword in hand, he began to back away, thrusting
Olivia behind him.</p>

<p>"Out of here, quick!" he urged in a whisper that congealed the
girl's blood.</p>

<p>"What is it? What do you see?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he answered guardedly, not halting his wary
retreat.</p>

<p>"But what is it, then? What lurks in this thicket?"</p>

<p>"Death!" he answered, his gaze still fixed on the brooding
jade arches that shut out the sky.</p>

<p>Once out of the thicket, he took her hand and led her swiftly
through the thinning trees, until they mounted a grassy slope,
sparsely treed, and emerged upon a low plateau, where the grass
grew taller and the trees were few and scattered. And in the
midst of that plateau rose a long broad structure of crumbling
greenish stone.</p>

<p>They gazed in wonder. No legends named such a building on any
island of Vilayet. They approached it warily, seeing that moss
and lichen crawled over the stones, and the broken roof gaped to
the sky. On all sides lay bits and shards of masonry, half hidden
in the waving grass, giving the impression that once many
buildings rose there, perhaps a whole town. But now only the long
hall-like structure rose against the sky, and its walls leaned
drunkenly among the crawling vines.</p>

<p>Whatever doors had once guarded its portals had long rotted
away. Conan and his companion stood in the broad entrance and
stared inside. Sunlight streamed in through gaps in the walls and
roof, making the interior a dim weave of light and shadow.
Grasping his sword firmly, Conan entered, with the slouching gait
of a hunting panther, sunken head and noiseless feet. Olivia
tiptoed after him.</p>

<p>Once within, Conan grunted in surprize, and Olivia stifled a
scream.</p>

<p>"Look! Oh, look!"</p>

<p>"I see," he answered. "Nothing to fear. They are statues."</p>

<p>"But how life-like&mdash;and how evil!" she whispered, drawing
close to him.</p>

<p>They stood in a great hall, whose floor was of polished stone,
littered with dust and broken stones, which had fallen from the
ceiling. Vines, growing between the stones, masked the apertures.
The lofty roof, flat and undomed, was upheld by thick columns,
marching in rows down the sides of the walls. And in each space
between these columns stood a strange figure.</p>

<p>They were statues, apparently of iron, black and shining as if
continually polished. They were life-sized, depicting tall,
lithely powerful men, with cruel hawk-like faces. They were
naked, and every swell, depression and contour of joint and sinew
was represented with incredible realism. But the most life-like
feature was their proud, intolerant faces. These features were
not cast in the same mold. Each face possessed its own individual
characteristics, though there was a tribal likeness between them
all. There was none of the monotonous uniformity of decorative
art, in the faces at least.</p>

<p>"They seem to be listening&mdash;and waiting!" whispered the
girl uneasily.</p>

<p>Conan rang his hilt against one of the images.</p>

<p>"Iron," he pronounced. "But Crom! In what molds were they
cast?"</p>

<p>He shook his head and shrugged his massive shoulders in
puzzlement.</p>

<p>Olivia glanced timidly about the great silent hall. Only the
ivy-grown stones, the tendril-clasped pillars, with the dark
figures brooding between them, met her gaze. She shifted uneasily
and wished to be gone, but the images held a strange fascination
for her companion. He examined them in detail, and barbarian-like, tried to break off their limbs. But their material resisted
his best efforts. He could neither disfigure nor dislodge from
its niche a single image. At last he desisted, swearing in his
wonder.</p>

<p>"What manner of men were these copied from?" he inquired of
the world at large. "These figures are black, yet they are not
like negroes. I have never seen their like."</p>

<p>"Let us go into the sunlight," urged Olivia, and he nodded,
with a baffled glance at the brooding shapes along the walls.</p>

<p>So they passed out of the dusky hall into the clear blaze of
the summer sun. She was surprized to note its position in the
sky; they had spent more time in the ruins than she had
guessed.</p>

<p>"Let us take to the boat again," she suggested. "I am afraid
here. It is a strange evil place. We do not know when we may be
attacked by whatever cast the rock."</p>

<p>"I think we're safe as long as we're not under the trees," he
answered. "Come."</p>

<p>The plateau, whose sides fell away toward the wooded shores on
the east, west and south, sloped upward toward the north to abut
on a tangle of rocky cliffs, the highest point of the island.
Thither Conan took his way, suiting his long stride to his
companion's gait. From time to time his glance rested inscrutably
upon her, and she was aware of it.</p>

<p>They reached the northern extremity of the plateau, and stood
gazing up the steep pitch of the cliffs. Trees grew thickly along
the rim of the plateau east and west of the cliffs, and clung to
the precipitous incline. Conan glanced at these trees
suspiciously, but he began the ascent, helping his companion on
the climb. The slope was not sheer, and was broken by ledges and
boulders. The Cimmerian, born in a hill country, could have run
up it like a cat, but Olivia found the going difficult. Again and
again she felt herself lifted lightly off her feet and over some
obstacle that would have taxed her strength to surmount, and her
wonder grew at the sheer physical power of the man. She no longer
found his touch repugnant. There was a promise of protection in
his iron clasp.</p>

<p>At last they stood on the ultimate pinnacle, their hair
stirring in the sea wind. From their feet the cliffs fell away
sheerly three or four hundred feet to a narrow tangle of
woodlands bordering the beach. Looking southward they saw the
whole island lying like a great oval mirror, its bevelled edges
sloping down swiftly into a rim of green, except where it broke
in the pitch of the cliffs. As far as they could see, on all
sides stretched the blue waters, still, placid, fading into
dreamy hazes of distance.</p>

<p>"The sea is still," sighed Olivia. "Why should we not take up
our journey again?"</p>

<p>Conan, poised like a bronze statue on the cliffs, pointed
northward. Straining her eyes, Olivia saw a white fleck that
seemed to hang suspended in the aching haze.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"A sail."</p>

<p>"Hyrkanians?"</p>

<p>"Who can tell, at this distance?"</p>

<p>"They will anchor here&mdash;search the island for us!" she
cried in quick panic.</p>

<p>"I doubt it. They come from the north, so they can not be
searching for us. They may stop for some other reason, in which
case we'll have to hide as best we can. But I believe it's either
pirate, or an Hyrkanian galley returning from some northern raid.
In the latter case they are not likely to anchor here. But we
can't put to sea until they've gone out of sight, for they're
coming from the direction in which we must go. Doubtless they'll
pass the island tonight, and at dawn we can go on our way."</p>

<p>"Then we must spend the night here?" she shivered.</p>

<p>"It's safest."</p>

<p>"Then let us sleep here, on the crags," she urged.</p>

<p>He shook his head, glancing at the stunted trees, at the
marching woods below, a green mass which seemed to send out
tendrils straggling up the sides of the cliffs.</p>

<p>"Here are too many trees. We'll sleep in the ruins."</p>

<p>She cried out in protest.</p>

<p>"Nothing will harm you there," he soothed. "Whatever threw the
stone at us did not follow us out of the woods. There was nothing
to show that any wild thing lairs in the ruins. Besides, you are
soft-skinned, and used to shelter and dainties. I could sleep
naked in the snow and feel no discomfort, but the dew would give
you cramps, were we to sleep in the open."</p>

<p>Olivia helplessly acquiesced, and they descended the cliffs,
crossed the plateau and once more approached the gloomy, age-haunted ruins. By this time the sun was sinking below the plateau
rim. They had found fruit in the trees near the cliffs, and these
formed their supper, both food and drink.</p>

<p>The southern night swept down quickly, littering the dark blue
sky with great white stars, and Conan entered the shadowy ruins,
drawing the reluctant Olivia after him. She shivered at the sight
of those tense black shadows in their niches along the walls. In
the darkness that the starlight only faintly touched, she could
not make out their outlines; she could only sense their attitude
of waiting&mdash;waiting as they had waited for untold
centuries.</p>

<p>Conan had brought a great armful of tender branches, well
leafed. These he heaped to make a couch for her, and she lay upon
it, with a curious sensation as of one lying down to sleep in a
serpent's lair.</p>

<p>Whatever her forebodings, Conan did not share them. The
Cimmerian sat down near her, his back against a pillar, his sword
across his knees. His eyes gleamed like a panther's in the
dusk.</p>

<p>"Sleep, girl," said he. "My slumber is light as a wolf's.
Nothing can enter this hall without awaking me."</p>

<p>Olivia did not reply. From her bed of leaves she watched the
immobile figure, indistinct in the soft darkness. How strange, to
move in fellowship with a barbarian, to be cared for and
protected by one of a race, tales of which had frightened her as
a child! He came of a people bloody, grim and ferocious. His
kinship to the wild was apparent in his every action; it burned
in his smoldering eyes. Yet he had not harmed her, and her worst
oppressor had been a man the world called civilized. As a
delicious languor stole over her relaxing limbs and she sank into
foamy billows of slumber, her last waking thought was a drowsy
recollection of the firm touch of Conan's fingers on her soft
flesh.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="shadows2" name="shadows2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

<p class="first">OLIVIA dreamed, and through her dreams crawled a
suggestion of lurking evil, like a black serpent writhing through
flower gardens. Her dreams were fragmentary and colorful, exotic
shards of a broken, unknown pattern, until they crystalized into
a scene of horror and madness, etched against a background of
cyclopean stones and pillars.</p>

<p>She saw a great hall, whose lofty ceiling was upheld by stone
columns marching in even rows along the massive walls. Among
these pillars fluttered great green and scarlet parrots, and the
hall was thronged with black-skinned, hawk-faced warriors. They
were not negroes. Neither they nor their garments nor weapons
resembled anything of the world the dreamer knew.</p>

<p>They were pressing about one bound to a pillar: a slender
white-skinned youth, with a cluster of golden curls about his
alabaster brow. His beauty was not altogether human&mdash;like
the dream of a god, chiseled out of living marble.</p>

<p>The black warriors laughed at him, jeered and taunted in a
strange tongue. The lithe naked form writhed beneath their cruel
hands. Blood trickled down the ivory thighs to spatter on the
polished floor. The screams of the victim echoed through the
hall; then lifting his head toward the ceiling and the skies
beyond, he cried out a name in an awful voice. A dagger in an
ebon hand cut short his cry, and the golden head rolled on the
ivory breast.</p>

<p>As if in answer to that desperate cry, there was a rolling
thunder as of celestial chariot-wheels, and a figure stood before
the slayers, as if materialized out of empty air. The form was of
a man, but no mortal man ever wore such an aspect of inhuman
beauty. There was an unmistakable resemblance between him and the
youth who dropped lifeless in his chains, but the alloy of
humanity that softened the godliness of the youth was lacking in
the features of the stranger, awful and immobile in their
beauty.</p>

<p>The blacks shrank back before him, their eyes slits of fire.
Lifting a hand, he spoke, and his tones echoed through the silent
halls in deep rich waves of sound. Like men in a trance the black
warriors fell back until they were ranged along the walls in
regular lines. Then from the stranger's chiseled lips rang a
terrible invocation and command: "Yagkoolan yok tha,
xuthalla!"</p>

<p>At the blast of that awful cry, the black figures stiffened
and froze. Over their limbs crept a curious rigidity, an
unnatural petrification. The stranger touched the limp body of
the youth, and the chains fell away from it. He lifted the corpse
in his arms; then ere he turned away, his tranquil gaze swept
again over the silent rows of ebony figures, and he pointed to
the moon, which gleamed in through the casements. And they
understood, those tense, waiting statues that had been men...</p>

<p>Olivia awoke, starting up on her couch of branches, a cold
sweat beading her skin. Her heart pounded loud in the silence.
She glanced wildly about. Conan slept against his pillar, his
head fallen upon his massive breast. The silvery radiance of the
late moon crept through the gaping roof, throwing long white
lines along the dusty floor. She could see the images dimly,
black, tense&mdash;waiting. Fighting down a rising hysteria, she
saw the moonbeams rest lightly on the pillars and the shapes
between.</p>

<p>What was that? A tremor among the shadows where the moonlight
fell. A paralysis of horror gripped her, for where there should
have been the immobility of death, there was movement: a slow
twitching, a flexing and writhing of ebon limbs&mdash;an awful
scream burst from her lips as she broke the bonds that held her
mute and motionless. At her shriek Conan shot erect, teeth
gleaming, sword lifted.</p>

<p>"The statues! The statues!&mdash;Oh my God, the statues are
coming to life!"</p>

<p>And with the cry she sprang through a crevice in the wall,
burst madly through the hindering vines, and ran, ran, ran blind,
screaming, witless&mdash;until a grasp on her arm brought her up
short and she shrieked and fought against the arms that caught
her, until a familiar voice penetrated the mists of her terror,
and she saw Conan's face, a mask of bewilderment in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>"What in Crom's name, girl? Did you have a nightmare?" His
voice sounded strange and far away. With a sobbing gasp she threw
her arms about his thick neck and clung to him convulsively,
crying in panting catches.</p>

<p>"Where are they? Did they follow us?"</p>

<p>"Nobody followed us," he answered.</p>

<p>She sat up, still clinging to him, and looked fearfully about.
Her blind flight had carried her to the southern edge of the
plateau. Just below them was the slope, its foot masked in the
thick shadows of the woods. Behind them she saw the ruins looming
in the high-swinging moon.</p>

<p>"Did you not see them?&mdash;The statues, moving, lifting
their hands, their eyes glaring in the shadows?"</p>

<p>"I saw nothing," answered the barbarian uneasily. "I slept
more soundly than usual, because it has been so long since I have
slumbered the night through; yet I don't think anything could
have entered the hall without waking me."</p>

<p>"Nothing entered," a laugh of hysteria escaped her. "It was
something there already. Ah, Mitra, we lay down to sleep among
them, like sheep making their bed in the shambles!"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" he demanded. "I woke at your
cry, but before I had time to look about me, I saw you rush out
through the crack in the wall. I pursued you, lest you come to
harm. I thought you had a nightmare."</p>

<p>"So I did!" she shivered. "But the reality was more grisly
than the dream. Listen!" And she narrated all that she had
dreamed and thought to see.</p>

<p>Conan listened attentively. The natural skepticism of the
sophisticated man was not his. His mythology contained ghouls,
goblins, and necromancers. After she had finished, he sat silent,
absently toying with his sword.</p>

<p>"The youth they tortured was like the tall man who came?" he
asked at last.</p>

<p>"As like as son to father," she answered, and hesitantly: "If
the mind could conceive of the offspring of a union of divinity
with humanity, it would picture that youth. The gods of old times
mated sometimes with mortal women, our legends tell us."</p>

<p>"What gods?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"The nameless, forgotten ones. Who knows? They have gone back
into the still waters of the lakes, the quiet hearts of the
hills, the gulfs beyond the stars. Gods are no more stable than
men."</p>

<p>"But if these shapes were men, blasted into iron images by
some god or devil, how can they come to life?"</p>

<p>"There is witchcraft in the moon," she shuddered. "He pointed
at the moon; while the moon shines on them, they live. So I
believe."</p>

<p>"But we were not pursued," muttered Conan, glancing toward the
brooding ruins. "You might have dreamed they moved. I am of a
mind to return and see."</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried, clutching him desperately. "Perhaps the
spell upon them holds them in the hall. Do not go back! They will
rend you limb from limb! Oh, Conan, let us go into our boat and
flee this awful island! Surely the Hyrkanian ship has passed us
now! Let us go!"</p>

<p>So frantic was her pleading that Conan was impressed. His
curiosity in regard to the images was balanced by his
superstition. Foes of flesh and blood he did not fear, however
great the odds, but any hint of the supernatural roused all the
dim monstrous instincts of fear that are the heritage of the
barbarian.</p>

<p>He took the girl's hand and they went down the slope and
plunged into the dense woods, where the leaves whispered, and
nameless night-birds murmured drowsily. Under the trees the
shadows clustered thick, and Conan swerved to avoid the denser
patches. His eyes roved continuously from side to side, and often
flitted into the branches above them. He went quickly yet warily,
his arm girdling the girl's waist so strongly that she felt as if
she were being carried rather than guided. Neither spoke. The
only sound was the girl's quick nervous panting, the rustle of
her small feet in the grass. So they came through the trees to
the edge of the water, shimmering like molten silver in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>"We should have brought fruit for food," muttered Conan; "but
doubtless we'll find other islands. As well leave now as later;
it's but a few hours till dawn&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice trailed away. The painter was still made fast to the
looping root. But at the other end was only a smashed and
shattered ruin, half submerged in the shallow water.</p>

<p>A stifled cry escaped Olivia. Conan wheeled and faced the
dense shadows, a crouching image of menace. The noise of the
night-birds was suddenly silent. A brooding stillness reigned
over the woods. No breeze moved the branches, yet somewhere the
leaves stirred faintly.</p>

<p>Quick as a great cat Conan caught up Olivia and ran. Through
the shadows he raced like a phantom, while somewhere above and
behind them sounded a curious rushing among the leaves, that
implacably drew closer and closer. Then the moonlight burst full
upon their faces, and they were speeding up the slope of the
plateau.</p>

<p>At the crest Conan laid Olivia down, and turned to glare back
at the gulf of shadows they had just quitted. The leaves shook in
a sudden breeze; that was all. He shook his mane with an angry
growl. Olivia crept to his feet like a frightened child. Her eyes
looked up at him, dark wells of horror.</p>

<p>"What are we to do, Conan?" she whispered.</p>

<p>He looked at the ruins, stared again into the woods below.</p>

<p>"We'll go to the cliffs," he declared, lifting her to her
feet. "Tomorrow I'll make a raft, and we'll trust our luck to the
sea again."</p>

<p>"It was not&mdash;not they that destroyed our boat?" It was
half question, half assertion.</p>

<p>He shook his head, grimly taciturn.</p>

<p>Every step of the way across that moon-haunted plateau was a
sweating terror for Olivia, but no black shapes stole subtly from
the looming ruins, and at last they reached the foot of the
crags, which rose stark and gloomily majestic above them. There
Conan halted in some uncertainty, at last selecting a place
sheltered by a broad ledge, nowhere near any trees.</p>

<p>"Lie down and sleep if you can, Olivia," he said. "I'll keep
watch."</p>

<p>But no sleep came to Olivia, and she lay watching the distant
ruins and the wooded rim until the stars paled, the east
whitened, and dawn in rose and gold struck fire from the dew on
the grassblades.</p>

<p>She rose stiffly, her mind reverting to all the happenings of
the night. In the morning light some of its terrors seemed like
figments of an overwrought imagination. Conan strode over to her,
and his words electrified her.</p>

<p>"Just before dawn I heard the creak of timbers and the rasp
and clack of cordage and oars. A ship has put in and anchored at
the beach not far away&mdash;probably the ship whose sail we saw
yesterday. We'll go up the cliffs and spy on her."</p>

<p>Up they went, and lying on their bellies among the boulders,
saw a painted mast jutting up beyond the trees to the west.</p>

<p>"An Hyrkanian craft, from the cut of her rigging," muttered
Conan. "I wonder if the crew&mdash;"</p>

<p>A distant medley of voices reached their ears, and creeping to
the southern edge of the cliffs, they saw a motley horde emerge
from the fringe of trees along the western rim of the plateau,
and stand there a space in debate. There was much flourishing of
arms, brandishing of swords, and loud rough argument. Then the
whole band started across the plateau toward the ruins, at a
slant that would take them close by the foot of the cliffs.</p>

<p>"Pirates!" whispered Conan, a grim smile on his thin lips.
"It's an Hyrkanian galley they've captured. Here&mdash;crawl
among these rocks.</p>

<p>"Don't show yourself unless I call to you," he instructed,
having secreted her to his satisfaction among a tangle of
boulders along the crest of the cliffs. "I'm going to meet these
dogs. If I succeed in my plan, all will be well, and we'll sail
away with them. If I don't succeed&mdash;well, hide yourself in
the rocks until they're gone, for no devils on this island are as
cruel as these sea-wolves."</p>

<p>And tearing himself from her reluctant grasp, he swung quickly
down the cliffs.</p>

<p>Looking fearfully from her eyrie, Olivia saw the band had
neared the foot of the cliffs. Even as she looked, Conan stepped
out from among the boulders and faced them, sword in hand. They
gave back with yells of menace and surprize; then halted
uncertainly to glare at this figure which had appeared so
suddenly from the rocks. There were some seventy of them, a wild
horde made up of men from many nations: Kothians, Zamorians,
Brythunians, Corinthians, Shemites. Their features reflected the
wildness of their natures. Many bore the scars of the lash or the
branding-iron. There were cropped ears, slit noses, gaping eye-sockets, stumps of wrists&mdash;marks of the hangman as well as
scars of battle. Most of them were half naked, but the garments
they wore were fine; gold-braided jackets, satin girdles, silken
breeches, tattered, stained with tar and blood, vied with pieces
of silver-chased armor. Jewels glittered in nose-rings and
earrings, and in the hilts of their daggers.</p>

<p>Over against this bizarre mob stood the tall Cimmerian in
strong contrast with his hard bronzed limbs and clean-cut vital
features.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" they roared.</p>

<p>"Conan the Cimmerian!" His voice was like the deep challenge
of a lion. "One of the Free Companions. I mean to try my luck
with the Red Brotherhood. Who's your chief?"</p>

<p>"I, by Ishtar!" bellowed a bull-like voice, as a huge figure
swaggered forward: a giant, naked to the waist, where his
capacious belly was girdled by a wide sash that upheld voluminous
silken pantaloons. His head was shaven except for a scalplock,
his mustaches dropped over a rat-trap mouth. Green Shemitish
slippers with upturned toes were on his feet, a long straight
sword in his hand.</p>

<p>Conan stared and glared.</p>

<p>"Sergius of Khrosha, by Crom!"</p>

<p>"Aye, by Ishtar!" boomed the giant, his small black eyes
glittering with hate. "Did you think I had forgot? Ha! Sergius
never forgets an enemy. Now I'll hang you up by the heels and
skin you alive. At him, lads!"</p>

<p>"Aye, send your dogs at me, big-belly," sneered Conan with
bitter scorn, "You were always a coward, you Kothic cur."</p>

<p>"Coward! To me?" The broad face turned black with passion. "On
guard, you northern dog! I'll cut out your heart!"</p>

<p>In an instant the pirates had formed a circle about the
rivals, their eyes blazing, their breath sucking between their
teeth in bloodthirsty enjoyment. High up among the crags Olivia
watched, sinking her nails into her palms in her painful
excitement.</p>

<p>Without formality the combatants engaged, Sergius coming in
with a rush, quick on his feet as a giant cat, for all his bulk.
Curses hissed between his clenched teeth as he lustily swung and
parried. Conan fought in silence, his eyes slits of blue bale-fire.</p>

<p>The Kothian ceased his oaths to save his breath. The only
sounds were the quick scuff of feet on the sward, the panting of
the pirate, the ring and clash of steel. The swords flashed like
white fire in the early sun, wheeling and circling. They seemed
to recoil from each other's contact, then leap together again
instantly. Sergius was giving back; only his superlative skill
had saved him thus far from the blinding speed of the Cimmerian's
onslaught. A louder clash of steel, a sliding rasp, a choking
cry&mdash;from the pirate horde a fierce yell split the morning
as Conan's sword plunged through their captain's massive body.
The point quivered an instant from between Sergius's shoulders, a
hand's breadth of white fire in the sunlight; then the Cimmerian
wrenched back his steel and the pirate chief fell heavily, face
down, and lay in a widening pool of blood, his broad hands
twitching for an instant.</p>

<p>Conan wheeled toward the gaping corsairs.</p>

<p>"Well, you dogs!" he roared. "I've sent your chief to hell.
What says the law of the Red Brotherhood?"</p>

<p>Before any could answer, a rat-faced Brythunian, standing
behind his fellows, whirled a sling swiftly and deadly. Straight
as an arrow sped the stone to its mark, and Conan reeled and fell
as a tall tree falls to the woodsman's ax. Up on the cliff Olivia
caught at the boulders for support. The scene swam dizzily before
her eyes; all she could see was the Cimmerian lying limply on the
sward, blood oozing from his head.</p>

<p>The rat-faced one yelped in triumph and ran to stab the
prostrate man, but a lean Corinthian thrust him back.</p>

<p>"What, Aratus, would you break the law of the Brotherhood, you
dog?"</p>

<p>"No law is broken," snarled the Brythunian.</p>

<p>"No law? Why, you dog, this man you have just struck down is
by just rights our captain!"</p>

<p>"Nay!" shouted Aratus. "He was not of our band, but an
outsider. He had not been admitted to fellowship. Slaying Sergius
does not make him captain, as would have been the case had one of
us killed him."</p>

<p>"But he wished to join us," retorted the Corinthian. "He said
so."</p>

<p>At that a great clamor arose, some siding with Aratus, some
with the Corinthian, whom they called Ivanos. Oaths flew thick,
challenges were passed, hands fumbled at sword-hilts.</p>

<p>At last a Shemite spoke up above the clamor: "Why do you argue
over a dead man?"</p>

<p>"He's not dead," answered the Corinthian, rising from beside
the prostrate Cimmerian. "It was a glancing blow; he's only
stunned."</p>

<p>At that the clamor rose anew, Aratus trying to get at the
senseless man and Ivanos finally bestriding him, sword in hand,
and defying all and sundry. Olivia sensed that it was not so much
in defense of Conan that the Corinthian took his stand, but in
opposition to Aratus. Evidently these men had been Sergius's
lieutenants, and there was no love lost between them. After more
arguments, it was decided to bind Conan and take him along with
them, his fate to be voted on later.</p>

<p>The Cimmerian, who was beginning to regain consciousness, was
bound with leather girdles, and then four pirates lifted him, and
with many complaints and curses, carried him along with the band,
which took up its journey across the plateau once more. The body
of Sergius was left where it had fallen; a sprawling, unlovely
shape on the sun-washed sward.</p>

<p>Up among the rocks, Olivia lay stunned by the disaster. She
was incapable of speech or action, and could only lie there and
stare with horrified eyes as the brutal horde dragged her
protector away.</p>

<p>How long she lay there, she did not know. Across the plateau
she saw the pirates reach the ruins and enter, dragging their
captive. She saw them swarming in and out of the doors and
crevices, prodding into the heaps of debris, and clambering about
the walls. After awhile a score of them came back across the
plateau and vanished among the trees on the western rim, dragging
the body of Sergius after them, presumably to cast into the sea.
About the ruins the others were cutting down trees and securing
material for a fire. Olivia heard their shouts, unintelligible in
the distance, and she heard the voices of those who had gone into
the woods, echoing among the trees. Presently they came back into
sight, bearing casks of liquor and leathern sacks of food. They
headed for the ruins, cursing lustily under their burdens.</p>

<p>Of all this Olivia was but mechanically cognizant. Her
overwrought brain was almost ready to collapse. Left alone and
unprotected, she realized how much the protection of the
Cimmerian had meant to her. There intruded vaguely a wonderment
at the mad pranks of Fate, that could make the daughter of a king
the companion of a red-handed barbarian. With it came a revulsion
toward her own kind. Her father, and Shah Amurath, they were
civilized men. And from them she had had only suffering. She had
never encountered any civilized man who treated her with kindness
unless there was an ulterior motive behind his actions. Conan had
shielded her, protected her, and&mdash;so far &mdash; demanded
nothing in return. Laying her head in her rounded arms she wept,
until distant shouts of ribald revelry roused her to her own
danger.</p>

<p>She glanced from the dark ruins about which the fantastic
figures, small in the distance, weaved and staggered, to the
dusky depths of the green forest. Even if her terrors in the
ruins the night before had been only dreams, the menace that
lurked in those green leafy depths below was no figment of
nightmare. Were Conan slain or carried away captive, her only
choice would lie between giving herself up to the human wolves of
the sea, or remaining alone on that devil-haunted island.</p>

<p>As the full horror of her situation swept over her, she fell
forward in a swoon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="shadows3" name="shadows3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE sun was hanging low when Olivia regained her
senses. A faint wind wafted to her ears distant shouts and
snatches of ribald song. Rising cautiously, she looked out across
the plateau. She saw the pirates clustered about a great fire
outside the ruins, and her heart leaped as a group emerged from
the interior dragging some object she knew was Conan. They
propped him against the wall, still evidently bound fast, and
there ensued a long discussion, with much brandishing of weapons.
At last they dragged him back into the hall, and took up anew the
business of ale-guzzling. Olivia sighed; at least she knew that
the Cimmerian still lived. Fresh determination steeled her. As
soon as night fell, she would steal to those grim ruins and free
him or be taken herself in the attempt. And she knew it was not
selfish interest alone which prompted her decision.</p>

<p>With this in mind she ventured to creep from her refuge to
pluck and eat nuts which grew sparsely near at hand. She had not
eaten since the day before. It was while so occupied that she was
troubled by a sensation of being watched. She scanned the rocks
nervously, then, with a shuddering suspicion, crept to the north
edge of the cliff and gazed down into the waving green mass
below, already dusky with the sunset. She saw nothing; it was
impossible that she could be seen, when not on the cliff's edge,
by anything lurking in those woods. Yet she distinctly felt the
glare of hidden eyes, and felt that something animate and
sentient was aware of her presence and her hiding-place.</p>

<p>Stealing back to her rocky eyrie, she lay watching the distant
ruins until the dusk of night masked them, and she marked their
position by the flickering flames about which black figures
leaped and cavorted groggily.</p>

<p>Then she rose. It was time to make her attempt. But first she
stole back to the northern edge of the cliffs, and looked down
into the woods that bordered the beach. And as she strained her
eyes in the dim starlight, she stiffened, and an icy hand touched
her heart.</p>

<p>Far below her something moved. It was as if a black shadow
detached itself from the gulf of shadows below her. It moved
slowly up the sheer face of the cliff&mdash;a vague bulk,
shapeless in the semi-darkness. Panic caught Olivia by the
throat, and she struggled with the scream that tugged at her
lips. Turning, she fled down the southern slope.</p>

<p>That flight down the shadowed cliffs was a nightmare in which
she slid and scrambled, catching at jagged rocks with cold
fingers. As she tore her tender skin and bruised her soft limbs
on the rugged boulders over which Conan had so lightly lifted
her, she realized again her dependence on the iron-thewed
barbarian. But this thought was but one in a fluttering maelstrom
of dizzy fright.</p>

<p>The descent seemed endless, but at last her feet struck the
grassy levels, and in a very frenzy of eagerness she sped away
toward the fire that burned like the red heart of night. Behind
her, as she fled, she heard a shower of stones rattle down the
steep slope, and the sound lent wings to her heels. What grisly
climber dislodged those stones she dared not try to think.</p>

<p>Strenuous physical action dissipated her blind terror somewhat
and before she had reached the ruin, her mind was clear, her
reasoning faculties alert, though her limbs trembled from her
efforts.</p>

<p>She dropped to the sward and wriggled along on her belly
until, from behind a small tree that had escaped the axes of the
pirates, she watched her enemies. They had completed their
supper, but were still drinking, dipping pewter mugs or jewelled
goblets into the broken heads of the wine-casks. Some were
already snoring drunkenly on the grass, while others had
staggered into the ruins. Of Conan she saw nothing. She lay
there, while the dew formed on the grass about her and the leaves
overhead, and the men about the fire cursed, gambled and argued.
There were only a few about the fire; most of them had gone into
the ruins to sleep.</p>

<p>She lay watching them, her nerves taut with the strain of
waiting, the flesh crawling between her shoulders at the thought
of what might be watching her in turn&mdash;of what might be
stealing up behind her. Time dragged on leaden feet. One by one
the revellers sank down in drunken slumber, until all were
stretched senseless beside the dying fire.</p>

<p>Olivia hesitated&mdash;then was galvanized by a distant glow
rising through the trees. The moon was rising!</p>

<p>With a gasp she rose and hurried toward the ruins. Her flesh
crawled as she tiptoed among the drunken shapes that sprawled
beside the gaping portal. Inside were many more; they shifted and
mumbled in their besotted dreams, but none awakened as she glided
among them. A sob of joy rose to her lips as she saw Conan. The
Cimmerian was wide awake, bound upright to a pillar, his eyes
gleaming in the faint reflection of the waning fire outside.</p>

<p>Picking her way among the sleepers, she approached him.
Lightly as she had come, he had heard her; had seen her when
first framed in the portal. A faint grin touched his hard
lips.</p>

<p>She reached him and clung to him an instant. He felt the quick
beating of her heart against his breast. Through a broad crevice
in the wall stole a beam of moonlight, and the air was instantly
supercharged with subtle tension. Conan felt it and stiffened.
Olivia felt it and gasped. The sleepers snored on. Bending
quickly, she drew a dagger from its senseless owner's belt, and
set to work on Conan's bonds. They were sail cords, thick and
heavy, and tied with the craft of a sailor. She toiled
desperately, while the tide of moonlight crept slowly across the
floor toward the feet of the crouching black figures between the
pillars.</p>

<p>Her breath came in gasps; Conan's wrists were free, but his
elbows and legs were still bound fast. She glanced fleetingly at
the figures along the walls&mdash;waiting, waiting. They seemed
to watch her with the awful patience of the undead. The drunkards
beneath her feet began to stir and groan in their sleep. The
moonlight crept down the hall, touching the black feet. The cords
fell from Conan's arms, and taking the dagger from her, he ripped
the bonds from his legs with a single quick slash. He stepped out
from the pillar, flexing his limbs, stoically enduring the agony
of returning circulation. Olivia crouched against him, shaking
like a leaf. Was it some trick of the moonlight that touched the
eyes of the black figures with fire, so that they glimmered redly
in the shadows?</p>

<p>Conan moved with the abruptness of a jungle cat. Catching up
his sword from where it lay in a stack of weapons near by, he
lifted Olivia lightly from her feet and glided through an opening
that gaped in the ivy-grown wall.</p>

<p>No word passed between them. Lifting her in his arms he set
off swiftly across the moon-bathed sward. Her arms about his iron
neck, the Ophirean closed her eyes, cradling her dark curly head
against his massive shoulder. A delicious sense of security stole
over her.</p>

<p>In spite of his burden, the Cimmerian crossed the plateau
swiftly, and Olivia, opening her eyes, saw that they were passing
under the shadow of the cliffs.</p>

<p>"Something climbed the cliffs," she whispered. "I heard it
scrambling behind me as I came down."</p>

<p>"We'll have to chance it," he grunted.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid&mdash;now," she sighed.</p>

<p>"You were not afraid when you came to free me, either," he
answered. "Crom, what a day it has been! Such haggling and
wrangling I never heard. I'm nearly deaf. Aratus wished to cut
out my heart, and Ivanos refused, to spite Aratus, whom he hates.
All day long they snarled and spat at one another, and the crew
quickly grew too drunk to vote either way&mdash;"</p>

<p>He halted suddenly, an image of bronze in the moonlight. With
a quick gesture he tossed the girl lightly to one side and behind
him. Rising to her knees on the soft sward, she screamed at what
she saw.</p>

<p>Out of the shadows of the cliffs moved a monstrous shambling
bulk&mdash;an anthropomorphic horror, a grotesque travesty of
creation.</p>

<p>In general outline it was not unlike a man. But its face,
limned in the bright moonlight, was bestial, with close-set ears,
flaring nostrils, and a great flabby-lipped mouth in which
gleamed white tusk-like fangs. It was covered with shaggy grayish
hair, shot with silver which shone in the moonlight, and its
great misshapen paws hung nearly to the earth. Its bulk was
tremendous; as it stood on its short bowed legs, its bullet-head
rose above that of the man who faced it; the sweep of the hairy
breast and giant shoulders was breathtaking; the huge arms were
like knotted trees.</p>

<p>The moonlight scene swam, to Olivia's sight. This, then, was
the end of the trail&mdash;for what human being could withstand
the fury of that hairy mountain of thews and ferocity? Yet as she
stared in wide-eyed horror at the bronzed figure facing the
monster, she sensed a kinship in the antagonists that was almost
appalling. This was less a struggle between man and beast than a
conflict between two creatures of the wild, equally merciless and
ferocious. With a flash of white tusks, the monster charged.</p>

<p>The mighty arms spread wide as the beast plunged, stupefyingly
quick for all his vast bulk and stunted legs.</p>

<p>Conan's action was a blur of speed Olivia's eye could not
follow. She only saw that he evaded that deadly grasp, and his
sword, flashing like a jet of white lightning, sheared through
one of those massive arms between shoulder and elbow. A great
spout of blood deluged the sward as the severed member fell,
twitching horribly, but even as the sword bit through, the other
malformed hand locked in Conan's black mane.</p>

<p>Only the iron neck-muscles of the Cimmerian saved him from a
broken neck that instant. His left hand darted out to clamp on
the beast's squat throat, his left knee was jammed hard against
the brute's hairy belly. Then began a terrific struggle, which
lasted only seconds, but which seemed like ages to the paralyzed
girl.</p>

<p>The ape maintained his grasp in Conan's hair, dragging him
toward the tusks that glistened in the moonlight. The Cimmerian
resisted this effort, with his left arm rigid as iron, while the
sword in his right hand, wielded like a butcher-knife, sank again
and again into the groin, breast and belly of his captor. The
beast took its punishment in awful silence, apparently unweakened
by the blood that gushed from its ghastly wounds. Swiftly the
terrible strength of the anthropoid overcame the leverage of
braced arm and knee. Inexorably Conan's arm bent under the
strain; nearer and nearer he was drawn to the slavering jaws that
gaped for his life. Now the blazing eyes of the barbarian glared
into the bloodshot eyes of the ape. But as Conan tugged vainly at
his sword, wedged deep in the hairy body, the frothing jaws
snapped spasmodically shut, an inch from the Cimmerian's face,
and he was hurled to the sward by the dying convulsions of the
monster.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>Olivia, half fainting, saw the ape heaving, thrashing and
writhing, gripping, man-like, the hilt that jutted from its body.
A sickening instant of this, then the great bulk quivered and lay
still.</p>

<p>Conan rose and limped over to the corpse. The Cimmerian
breathed heavily, and walked like a man whose joints and muscles
have been wrenched and twisted almost to their limit of
endurance. He felt his bloody scalp and swore at the sight of the
long black red-stained strands still grasped in the monster's
shaggy hand.</p>

<p>"Crom!" he panted. "I feel as if I'd been racked! I'd rather
fight a dozen men. Another instant and he'd have bitten off my
head. Blast him, he's torn a handful of my hair out by the
roots."</p>

<p>Gripping his hilt with both hands he tugged and worked it
free. Olivia stole close to clasp his arm and stare down wide-eyed at the sprawling monster.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what is it?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"A gray man-ape," he grunted. "Dumb, and man-eating. They
dwell in the hills that border the eastern shore of this sea. How
this one got to this island, I can't say. Maybe he floated here
on driftwood, blown out from the mainland in a storm."</p>

<p>"And it was he that threw the stone?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I suspected what it was when we stood in the thicket and
I saw the boughs bending over our heads. These creatures always
lurk in the deepest woods they can find, and seldom emerge. What
brought him into the open, I can't say, but it was lucky for us;
I'd have had no chance with him among the trees."</p>

<p>"It followed me," she shivered. "I saw it climbing the
cliffs."</p>

<p>"And following his instinct, he lurked in the shadow of the
cliff, instead of following you out across the plateau. His kind
are creatures of darkness and the silent places, haters of sun
and moon."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose there are others?"</p>

<p>"No, else the pirates had been attacked when they went through
the woods. The gray ape is wary, for all his strength, as shown
by his hesitancy in falling upon us in the thicket. His lust for
you must have been great, to have driven him to attack us finally
in the open. What&mdash;"</p>

<p>He started and wheeled back toward the way they had come. The
night had been split by an awful scream. It came from the
ruins.</p>

<p>Instantly there followed a mad medley of yells, shrieks and
cries of blasphemous agony. Though accompanied by a ringing of
steel, the sounds were of massacre rather than battle.</p>

<p>Conan stood frozen, the girl clinging to him in a frenzy of
terror. The clamor rose to a crescendo of madness, and then the
Cimmerian turned and went swiftly toward the rim of the plateau,
with its fringe of moon-limned trees. Olivia's legs were
trembling so that she could not walk; so he carried her, and her
heart calmed its frantic pounding as she nestled into his
cradling arms.</p>

<p>They passed under the shadowy forest, but the clusters of
blackness held no terrors, the rifts of silver discovered no
grisly shape. Night-birds murmured slumberously. The yells of
slaughter dwindled behind them, masked in the distance to a
confused jumble of sound. Somewhere a parrot called, like an eery
echo: "Yagkoolan yok tha, xuthalla!" So they came to the tree-fringed water's edge and saw the galley lying at anchor, her sail
shining white in the moonlight. Already the stars were paling for
dawn.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="shadows4" name="shadows4">CHAPTER 4</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN the ghastly whiteness of dawn a handful of
tattered, bloodstained figures staggered through the trees and
out on to the narrow beach. There were forty-four of them, and
they were a cowed and demoralized band. With panting haste they
plunged into the water and began to wade toward the galley, when
a stern challenge brought them up standing.</p>

<p>Etched against the whitening sky they saw Conan the Cimmerian
standing in the bows, sword in hand, his black mane tossing in
the dawn wind.</p>

<p>"Stand!" he ordered. "Come no nearer. What would you have,
dogs?"</p>

<p>"Let us come aboard!" croaked a hairy rogue fingering a bloody
stump of ear. "We'd be gone from this devil's island."</p>

<p>"The first man who tries to climb over the side, I'll split
his skull," promised Conan.</p>

<p>They were forty-four to one, but he held the whip-hand. The
fight had been hammered out of them.</p>

<p>"Let us come aboard, good Conan," whined a red-sashed
Zamorian, glancing fearfully over his shoulder at the silent
woods. "We have been so mauled, bitten, scratched and rended, and
are so weary from fighting and running, that not one of us can
lift a sword."</p>

<p>"Where is that dog Aratus?" demanded Conan.</p>

<p>"Dead, with the others! It was devils fell upon us! They were
rending us to pieces before we could awake&mdash;a dozen good
rovers died in their sleep. The ruins were full of flame-eyed
shadows, with tearing fangs and sharp talons."</p>

<p>"Aye!" put in another corsair. "They were the demons of the
isle, which took the forms of molten images, to befool us.
Ishtar! We lay down to sleep among them. We are no cowards. We
fought them as long as mortal man may strive against the powers
of darkness. Then we broke away and left them tearing at the
corpses like jackals. But surely they'll pursue us."</p>

<p>"Aye, let us come aboard!" clamored a lean Shemite. "Let us
come in peace, or we must come sword in hand, and though we be so
weary you will doubtless slay many of us, yet you can not prevail
against us many."</p>

<p>"Then I'll knock a hole in the planks and sink her," answered
Conan grimly. A frantic chorus of expostulation rose, which Conan
silenced with a lion-like roar.</p>

<p>"Dogs! Must I aid my enemies? Shall I let you come aboard and
cut out my heart?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay!" they cried eagerly. "Friends&mdash;friends, Conan.
We are thy comrades! We be all lusty rogues together. We hate the
king of Turan, not each other."</p>

<p>Their gaze hung on his brown, frowning face.</p>

<p>"Then if I am one of the Brotherhood," he grunted, "the laws
of the Trade apply to me; and since I killed your chief in fair
fight, then I am your captain!"</p>

<p>There was no dissent. The pirates were too cowed and battered
to have any thought except a desire to get away from that island
of fear. Conan's gaze sought out the bloodstained figure of the
Corinthian.</p>

<p>"How, Ivanos!" he challenged. "You took my part, once. Will
you uphold my claims again?"</p>

<p>"Aye, by Mitra!" The pirate, sensing the trend of feeling, was
eager to ingratiate himself with the Cimmerian. "He is right,
lads; he is our lawful captain!"</p>

<p>A medley of acquiescence rose, lacking enthusiasm perhaps, but
with sincerity accentuated by the feel of the silent woods behind
them which might mask creeping ebony devils with red eyes and
dripping talons.</p>

<p>"Swear by the hilt," Conan demanded.</p>

<p>Forty-four sword-hilts were lifted toward him, and forty-four
voices blended in the corsair's oath of allegiance.</p>

<p>Conan grinned and sheathed his sword. "Come aboard, my bold
swashbucklers, and take the oars."</p>

<p>He turned and lifted Olivia to her feet, from where she had
crouched shielded by the gunwales.</p>

<p>"And what of me, sir?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What would you?" he countered, watching her narrowly.</p>

<p>"To go with you, wherever your path may lie!" she cried,
throwing her white arms about his bronzed neck.</p>

<p>The pirates, clambering over the rail, gasped in
amazement.</p>

<p>"To sail a road of blood and slaughter?" he questioned. "This
keel will stain the blue waves crimson wherever it plows."</p>

<p>"Aye, to sail with you on blue seas or red," she answered
passionately. "You are a barbarian, and I am an outcast, denied
by my people. We are both pariahs, wanderers of earth. Oh, take
me with you!"</p>

<p>With a gusty laugh he lifted her to his fierce lips.</p>

<p>"I'll make you Queen of the Blue Sea! Cast off there, dogs!
We'll scorch King Yildiz's pantaloons yet, by Crom!"</p>
