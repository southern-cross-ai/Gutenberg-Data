<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01">I. &mdash; THE PASSING OF JOHN
MILLINBORN</a></h2>

<p class="first">"I DON'T know whether there's a law that stops
my doing this, Jim; but if there is, you've got to get round
it. You're a lawyer and you know the game. You're my pal and the
best pal I've had, Jim, and you'll do it for me."</p>

<p>The dying man looked up into the old eyes that were watching
him with such compassion and read their acquiescence.</p>

<p>No greater difference could be imagined than existed between
the man on the bed and the slim neat figure who sat by his side.
John Millinborn, broad-shouldered, big-featured, a veritable
giant in frame and even in his last days suggesting the
enormous strength which had been his in his prime, had been an
outdoor man, a man of large voice and large capable hands; James
Kitson had been a student from his youth up and had spent his
manhood in musty offices, stuffy courts, surrounded by crackling
briefs and calf-bound law-books.</p>

<p>Yet, between these two men, the millionaire ship-builder and
the successful solicitor, utterly different in their tastes and
their modes of life, was a friendship deep and true. Strange
that death should take the strong and leave the weak; so thought
James Kitson as he watched his friend.</p>

<p>"I'll do what can be done, John. You leave a great
responsibility upon the girl&mdash;a million and a half of
money."</p>

<p>The sick man nodded. "I get rid of a greater one, Jim. When
my father died he left a hundred thousand between us, my sister
and I. I've turned my share into a million, but that is by the
way. Because she was a fairly rich girl and a wilful girl, Jim,
she broke her heart. Because they knew she had the money the
worst men were attracted to her&mdash;and she chose the worst of
the worst!" He stopped speaking to get his breath. "She married
a plausible villain who ruined her&mdash;spent every sou and
left her with a mountain of debt and a month-old baby. Poor
Grace died and he married again. I tried to get the baby, but he
held it as a hostage. I could never trace the child after it was
two years old. It was only a month ago I learnt the reason. The
man was an international swindler and was wanted by the police.
He was arrested in Paris and charged in his true name&mdash;the
name he had married in was false. When he came out of prison he
took his own name&mdash;and of course the child's name changed,
too."</p>

<p>The lawyer nodded. "You want me to&mdash;?</p>

<p>"Get the will proved and begin your search for Oliva
Predeaux. There is no such person. The girl's name you know, and
I have told you where she is living. You'll find nobody who
knows Oliva Predeaux&mdash;her father disappeared when she was
six&mdash;he's probably dead, and her stepmother brought her up
without knowing her relationship to me&mdash;then she died and
the girl has been working ever since she was fifteen."</p>

<p>"She is not to be found?"</p>

<p>"Until she is married. Watch her, Jim, spend all the money
you wish&mdash;don't influence her unless you see she is
getting the wrong kind of man..."</p>

<p>His voice, which had grown to something of the old strength,
suddenly dropped and the great head rolled sideways on the
pillow.</p>

<p>Kitson rose and crossed to the door. It opened upon a
spacious sitting-room, through the big open windows of which
could be seen the broad acres of the Sussex Weald. A man was
sitting in the window-seat, chin in hand, looking across to the
chequered fields on the slope of the downs. He was a man of
thirty, with a pointed beard, and he rose as the lawyer stepped
quickly into the room.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think he has fainted&mdash;will you go to him,
doctor?"</p>

<p>The young man passed swiftly and noiselessly to the bedside
and made a brief examination. From a shelf near the head of the
bed he took a hypodermic syringe and filled it from a small
bottle. Baring the patient's side he slowly injected the drug.
He stood for a moment looking down at the unconscious man, then
came back to the big hall where James Kitson was waiting.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to form a judgment," he said quietly, "his
heart is all gone to pieces. Has he a family doctor?"</p>

<p>"Not so far as I know&mdash;he hated doctors, and has never
been ill in his life. I wonder he tolerated you."</p>

<p>Dr. van Heerden smiled.</p>

<p>"He couldn't help himself. He was taken ill in the train on
the way to this place and I happened to be a fellow-passenger.
He asked me to bring him here and I have been here ever since.
It is strange," he added, "that so rich a man as Mr. Millinborn
had no servant travelling with him and should live practically
alone in this&mdash;well, it is little better than a
cottage."</p>

<p>Despite his anxiety, James Kitson smiled.</p>

<p>"He is the type of man who hates ostentation. I doubt if he
has ever spent a thousand a year on himself all his
life&mdash;do you think it is wise to leave him?"</p>

<p>The doctor spread out his hands.</p>

<p>"I can do nothing. He refused to allow me to send for a
specialist and I think he was right. Nothing can be done for
him. Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>He walked back to the bedside, and the lawyer came behind
him. John Millinborn seemed to be in an uneasy sleep, and after
an examination by the doctor the two men walked back to the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>"The excitement has been rather much for him. I suppose he
has been making his will?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kitson shortly.</p>

<p>"I gathered as much when I saw you bring the gardener and the
cook in to witness a document," said Dr. van Heerden.</p>

<p>He tapped his teeth with the tip of his fingers&mdash;a
nervous trick of his.</p>

<p>"I wish I had some strychnine," he said suddenly. "I ought to
have some by me&mdash;in case."</p>

<p>"Can't you send a servant&mdash;or I'll go," said Kitson. "Is
it procurable in the village?"</p>

<p>The doctor nodded.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to go," he demurred. "I have sent the car
to Eastbourne to get a few things I cannot buy here. It's a
stiff walk to the village and yet I doubt whether the chemist
would supply the quantity I require to a servant, even with my
prescription&mdash;you see," he smiled, "I am a stranger
here."</p>

<p>"I'll go with pleasure&mdash;the walk will do me good," said
the lawyer energetically. "If there is anything we can do to
prolong my poor friend's life&mdash;"</p>

<p>The doctor sat at the table and wrote his prescription and
handed it to the other with an apology.</p>

<p>Hill Lodge, John Millinborn's big cottage, stood on the crest
of a hill, and the way to the village was steep and long, for
Alfronston lay nearly a mile away. Halfway down the slope the
path ran through a plantation of young ash. Here John Millinborn
had preserved a few pheasants in the early days of his occupancy
of the Lodge on the hill. As Kitson entered one side of the
plantation he heard a rustling noise, as though somebody were
moving through the undergrowth. It was too heavy a noise for a
bolting rabbit or a startled bird to make, and he peered into
the thick foliage. He was a little nearsighted, and at first he
did not see the cause of the commotion. Then:</p>

<p>"I suppose I'm trespassing," said a husky voice, and a man
stepped out toward him.</p>

<p>The stranger carried himself with a certain jauntiness, and
he had need of what assistance artifice could lend him, for he
was singularly unprepossessing. He was a man who might as well
have been sixty as fifty. His clothes soiled, torn and greasy,
were of good cut. The shirt was filthy, but it was attached to a
frayed collar, and the crumpled cravat was ornamented with a
cameo pin.</p>

<p>But it was the face which attracted Kitson's attention. There
was something inherently evil in that puffed face, in the dull
eyes that blinked under the thick black eyebrows. The lips, full
and loose, parted in a smile as the lawyer stepped back to avoid
contact with the unsavoury visitor.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'm trespassing&mdash;good gad! Me
trespassing&mdash;funny, very funny!" He indulged in a hoarse
wheezy laugh and broke suddenly into a torrent of the foulest
language that this hardened lawyer had ever heard.</p>

<p>"Pardon, pardon," he said, stopping as suddenly. "Man of the
world, eh? You'll understand that when a gentleman has
grievances..." He fumbled in his waistcoat-pocket and found a
black-rimmed monocle and inserted it in his eye. There was an
obscenity in the appearance of this foul wreck of a man which
made the lawyer feel physically sick.</p>

<p>"Trespassing, by gad!" He went back to his first conceit and
his voice rasped with malignity. "Gad! If I had my way with
people! I'd slit their throats, I would, sir. I'd stick pins in
their eyes&mdash;red-hot pins. I'd boil them alive&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hitherto the lawyer had not spoken, but now his repulsion got
the better of his usually equable temper.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he asked sternly. "You're on
private property&mdash;take your beastliness elsewhere."</p>

<p>The man glared at him and laughed.</p>

<p>"Trespassing!" he sneered. "Trespassing! Very good&mdash;your
servant, sir!"</p>

<p>He swept his derby hat from his head (the lawyer saw that he
was bald), and turning, strutted back through the plantation the
way he had come. It was not the way out and Kitson was
half-inclined to follow and see the man off the estate. Then he
remembered the urgency of his errand and continued his journey to
the village. On his way back he looked about, but there was no
trace of the unpleasant intruder. Who was he? he wondered. Some
broken derelict with nothing but the memory of former vain
splendours and the rags of old fineries, nursing a dear hatred
for some more fortunate fellow.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour had passed before he again panted up to the
levelled shelf on which the cottage stood.</p>

<p>The doctor was sitting at the window as Kitson passed.</p>

<p>"How is he?"</p>

<p>"About the same. He had one paroxysm. Is that the strychnine?
I can't tell you how much obliged I am to you."</p>

<p>He took the small packet and placed it on the window-ledge
and Mr. Kitson passed into the house.</p>

<p>"Honestly, doctor, what do you think of his chance?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Dr. van Heerden shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Honestly, I do not think he will recover consciousness."</p>

<p>"Heavens!"</p>

<p>The lawyer was shocked. The tragic suddenness of it all
stunned him. He had thought vaguely that days, even weeks, might
pass before the end came.</p>

<p>"Not recover consciousness?" he repeated in a whisper.</p>

<p>Instinctively he was drawn to the room where his friend lay
and the doctor followed him.</p>

<p>John Millinborn lay on his back, his eyes closed, his face a
ghastly grey. His big hands were clutching at his throat, his
shirt was torn open at the breast. The two windows, one at each
end of the room, were wide, and a gentle breeze blew the
casement curtains. The lawyer stooped, his eyes moist, and laid
his hand upon the burning forehead.</p>

<p>"John, John," he murmured, and turned away, blinded with
tears.</p>

<p>He wiped his face with a pocket-handkerchief and walked to
the window, staring out at the serene loveliness of the scene.
Over the weald a great aeroplane droned to the sea. The green
downs were dappled white with grazing flocks, and beneath the
windows the ordered beds blazed and flamed with flowers, crimson
and gold and white.</p>

<p>As he stood there the man he had met in the plantation came
to his mind and he was half-inclined to speak to the doctor of
the incident. But he was in no mood for the description and the
speculation which would follow. Restlessly he paced into the
bedroom. The sick man had not moved and again the lawyer
returned. He thought of the girl, that girl whose name and
relationship with John Millinborn he alone knew. What use would
she make of the millions which, all unknown to her, she would
soon inherit? What...</p>

<p>"Jim, Jim!"</p>

<p>He turned swiftly.</p>

<p>It was John Millinborn's voice.</p>

<p>"Quick&mdash;come..."</p>

<p>The doctor had leapt into the room and made his way to the
bed.</p>

<p>Millinborn was sitting up, and as the lawyer moved swiftly in
the doctor's tracks he saw his wide eyes staring.</p>

<p>"Jim, he has..."</p>

<p>His head dropped forward on his breast and the doctor lowered
him slowly to the pillow.</p>

<p>"What is it, John? Speak to me, old man..."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there is nothing to be done," said the doctor as
he drew up the bedclothes.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" whispered the lawyer fearfully.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He beckoned the other into the big room and, after a glance
at the motionless figure, Kitson followed.</p>

<p>"There's something very strange&mdash;who is that?"</p>

<p>He pointed through the open window at the clumsy figure of a
man who was blundering wildly down the slope which led to the
plantation.</p>

<p>Kitson recognized the man immediately. It was the uninvited
visitor whom he had met in the plantation. But there was
something in the haste of the shabby man, a hint of terror in
the wide-thrown arms, that made the lawyer forget his tragic
environment.</p>

<p>"Where has he been?" he asked. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>The doctor's face was white and drawn as though he, too,
sensed some horror in that frantic flight.</p>

<p>Kitson walked back to the room where the dying man lay, but
was frozen stiff upon the threshold.</p>

<p>"Doctor&mdash;doctor!"</p>

<p>The doctor followed the eyes of the other. Something was
dripping from the bed to the floor&mdash;something red and
horrible. Kitson set his teeth and, stepping to the bedside,
pulled down the covers.</p>

<p>He stepped back with a cry, for from the side of John
Millinborn protruded the ivory handle of a knife.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02">II. &mdash; THE DRUNKEN MR.
BEALE</a></h2>

<p class="first">DR. VAN HEERDEN'S surgery occupied one of the
four shops which formed the ground floor of the Krooman
Chambers. This edifice had been erected by a wealthy
philanthropist to provide small model flats for the professional
classes who needed limited accommodation and a good address
(they were in the vicinity of Oxford Street) at a moderate
rental. Like many philanthropists, the owner had wearied of his
hobby and had sold the block to a syndicate, whose management on
more occasions than one had been the subject of police
inquiry.</p>

<p>They had then fallen into the hands of an intelligent woman,
who had turned out the undesirable tenants, furnished the flats
plainly, but comfortably, and had let them to tenants who might
be described as solvent, but honest. Krooman Chambers had
gradually rehabilitated itself in the eyes of the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Dr. van Heerden had had his surgery in the building for six
years. During the war he was temporarily under suspicion for
sympathies with the enemy, but no proof was adduced of his
enmity and, though he had undoubtedly been born on the wrong
side of the Border at Cranenburg, which is the Prussian frontier
station on the Rotterdam-Cologne line, his name was undoubtedly
van Heerden, which was Dutch. Change the "van" to "von", said
the carping critics, and he was a Hun, and undoubtedly Germany
was full of von Heerens and von Heerdens.</p>

<p>The doctor lived down criticism, lived down suspicion, and
got together a remunerative practice. He had the largest flat in
the building, one room of which was fitted up as a laboratory,
for he had a passion for research. The mysterious murder of John
Millinborn had given him a certain advertisement which had not
been without its advantages. The fact that he had been in
attendance on the millionaire had brought him a larger fame.</p>

<p>His theories as to how the murder had been committed by some
one who had got through the open window whilst the two men were
out of the room had been generally accepted, for the police had
found footmarks on the flowerbeds, over which the murderer must
have passed. They had not, however, traced the seedy-looking
personage whom Mr. Kitson had seen. This person had disappeared
as mysteriously as he had arrived.</p>

<p>Three months after the murder the doctor stood on the steps
of the broad entrance-hall which led to the flats, watching the
stream of pedestrians passing. It was six o'clock in the evening
and the streets were alive with shopgirls and workers on their
way home from business.</p>

<p>He smoked a cigarette and his interest was, perhaps, more
apparent than real. He had attended his last surgery case and
the door of the "shop," with its sage-green windows, had been
locked for the night.</p>

<p>His eyes wandered idly to the Oxford Street end of the
thoroughfare, and suddenly he started. A girl was walking toward
him. At this hour there was very little wheeled traffic, for
Lattice Street is almost a cul-de-sac, and she had taken the
middle of the road. She was dressed with that effective neatness
which brings the wealthy and the work-girl to a baffling level,
in a blue serge costume of severe cut; a plain white linen
coat-collar and a small hat, which covered, but did not hide, a
mass of hair which, against the slanting sunlight at her back, lent
the illusion of a golden nimbus about her head.</p>

<p>The eyes were deep-set and wise with the wisdom which is
found alike in those who have suffered and those who have
watched suffering. The nose was straight, the lips scarlet and
full. You might catalogue every feature of Oliva Cresswell and
yet arrive at no satisfactory explanation for her charm.</p>

<p>Not in the clear ivory pallor of complexion did her charm
lie. Nor in the trim figure with its promising lines, nor in the
poise of head nor pride of carriage, nor in the ready laughter
that came to those quiet eyes. In no one particular quality of
attraction did she excel. Rather was her charm the charm of the
perfect agglomeration of all those characteristics which men
find alluring and challenging.</p>

<p>She raised her hand with a free unaffected gesture, and
greeted the doctor with a flashing smile.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Cresswell, I haven't seen you for quite a long
time."</p>

<p>"Two days," she said solemnly, "but I suppose doctors who
know all the secrets of nature have some very special drug to
sustain them in trials like that."</p>

<p>"Don't be unkind to the profession," he laughed, "and don't
be sarcastic, to one so young. By the way, I have never asked
you-did you get your flat changed?"</p>

<p>She shook her head and frowned.</p>

<p>"Miss Millit says she cannot move me."</p>

<p>"Abominable," he said, and was annoyed. "Did you tell her
about Beale?"</p>

<p>She nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>"I said to her, says I," she had a trick of mimicry and
dropped easily into the southern English accent, "'Miss Millit,
are you aware that the gentleman who lives opposite to me has
been, to my knowledge, consistently drunk for two
months&mdash;ever since he came to live at Kroomans?' 'Does he
annoy you?' says she. 'Drunken people always annoy me,' says I.
'Mr. Beale arrives home every evening in a condition which I can
only describe as deplorable.'"</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>The girl made a little grimace and became serious.</p>

<p>"She said if he did not speak to me or interfere with me or
frighten me it was none of my business, or something to that
effect." She laughed helplessly. "Really, the flat is so
wonderful and so cheap that one cannot afford to get
out&mdash;you don't know how grateful I am to you, doctor, for
having got diggings here at all&mdash;Miss Millit isn't keen on
single young ladies."</p>

<p>She sniffed and laughed.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was thinking how queerly you and I met."</p>

<p>The circumstances of their meeting had indeed been curious.
She was employed as a cashier at one of the great West End
stores. He had made some sort of purchase and made payment in a
five-pound note which had proved to be counterfeit. It was a sad
moment for the girl when the forgery was discovered, for she had
to make up the loss from her own pocket and that was no small
matter.</p>

<p>Then the miracle had happened. The doctor had arrived full of
apologies, had presented his card and explained. The note was
one which he had been keeping as a curiosity. It has been passed
on him and was such an excellent specimen that he intended
having it framed but it had got mixed up with his other
money.</p>

<p>"You started by being the villain of the piece and ended by
being my good fairy," she said. "I should never have known there
was a vacancy here but for you. I should not have been admitted
by the proper Miss Millit but for the terror of your name."</p>

<p>She dropped her little hand lightly on his shoulder. It was a
gesture of good-comradeship.</p>

<p>She half-turned to go when an angry exclamation held her.</p>

<p>"What is it? Oh, I see&mdash;No. 4!"</p>

<p>She drew a little closer to the doctor's side and watched
with narrowing lids the approaching figure.</p>

<p>"Why does he do it&mdash;oh, why does he do it?" she demanded
impatiently. "How can a man be so weak, so wretchedly weak?
There's nothing justifies that!"</p>

<p>"That" was apparently trying to walk the opposite kerb as
though it were a tight-rope. Save for a certain disorder of
attire, a protruding necktie and a muddy hat, he was respectable
enough. He was young and, under other conditions, passably good
looking. But with his fair hair streaming over his forehead and
his hat at the back of his head he lacked fascination. His
attempt, aided by a walking-stick used as a balancing-pole, to
keep his equilibrium on six inches of kerbing, might have been
funny to a less sensitive soul than Oliva's.</p>

<p>He slipped, recovered himself with a little whoop, slipped
again, and finally gave up the attempt, crossing the road to his
home.</p>

<p>He recognized the doctor with a flourish of his hat.</p>

<p>"Glorious weather, my Escu-escu-lapius," he said, with a
little slur in his voice but a merry smile in his eye; "simply
wonderful weather for bacteria trypanosomes (got it) an' all the
jolly little microbes."</p>

<p>He smiled at the doctor blandly, ignoring the other's
significant glance at the girl, who had drawn back so that she
might not find herself included in the conversation.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to leave you, doctor," he went on, "goin' top
floor, away from the evil smells of science an' fatal lure of
beauty. Top floor jolly stiff climb when a fellow's all lit up
like the Hotel Doodledum&mdash;per arduis ad astra&mdash;through
labour to the stars&mdash;fine motto. Flying Corps'
motto&mdash;my motto. Goo' night!"</p>

<p>Oft came his hat again and he staggered up the broad stone
stairs and disappeared round a turn. Later they heard his door
slam.</p>

<p>"Awful&mdash;and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet?" echoed the doctor.</p>

<p>"I thought he was funny. I nearly laughed. But how terrible!
He's so young and he has had a decent education."</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>Presently she took leave of the doctor and made her way
upstairs. Three doors opened from the landing. Numbers 4, 6 and
8.</p>

<p>She glanced a little apprehensively at No. 4 as she passed,
but there was no sound or sign of the reveller, and she passed
into No. 6 and closed the door.</p>

<p>The accommodation consisted of two rooms, a bed- and a
sitting-room, a bath-room and a tiny kitchen. The rent was
remarkably low, less than a quarter of her weekly earnings, and
she managed to live comfortably.</p>

<p>She lit the gas-stove and put on the kettle and began to lay
the table. There was a "tin of something" in the diminutive
pantry, a small loaf and a jug of milk, a tomato or two and a
bottle of dressing&mdash;the high tea to which she sat down (a
little flushed of the face and quite happy) was seasoned with
content. She thought of the doctor and accounted herself lucky
to have so good a friend. He was so sensible, there was no
"nonsense" about him. He never tried to hold her hand as the
stupid buyers did, nor make clumsy attempts to kiss her as one
of the partners had done.</p>

<p>The doctor was different from them all. She could not imagine
him sitting by the side of a girl in a bus pressing her foot
with his, or accosting her in the street with a "Haven't we met
before?"</p>

<p>She ate her meal slowly, reading the evening newspaper and
dreaming at intervals. It was dusk when she had finished and she
switched on the electric light. There was a shilling-in-the-slot
meter in the bath-room that acted eccentrically. Sometimes one
shilling would supply light for a week, at other times after two
days the lights would flicker spasmodically and expire.</p>

<p>She remembered that it was a perilous long time since she had
bribed the meter and searched her purse for a shilling. She
found that she had half-crowns, florins and sixpences, but she
had no shillings. This, of course, is the chronic condition of
all users of the slot-meters, and she accepted the discovery
with the calm of the fatalist. She considered. Should she go out
and get change from the obliging tobacconist at the corner or
should she take a chance?</p>

<p>"If I don't go out you will," she said addressing the light,
and it winked ominously.</p>

<p>She opened the door and stepped into the passage, and as she
did so the lights behind her went out. There was one small lamp
on the landing, a plutocratic affair independent of shilling
meters. She closed the door behind her and walked to the head of
the stairs. As she passed No. 4, she noted the door was ajar and
she stopped. She did not wish to risk meeting the drunkard, and
she turned back.</p>

<p>Then she remembered the doctor, he lived in No. 8. Usually
when he was at home there was a light in his hall which showed
through the fanlight. Now, however, the place was in darkness.
She saw a card on the door and walking closer she read it in the
dim light.</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">BACK AT 12. WAIT.</p>

<br>

<p>He was out and was evidently expecting a caller. So there was
nothing for it but to risk meeting the exuberant Mr. Beale. She
flew down the stairs and gained the street with a feeling of
relief.</p>

<p>The obliging tobacconist, who was loquacious on the subject
of Germans and Germany, detained her until her stock of patience
was exhausted; but at last she made her escape. Half-way across
the street she saw the figure of a man standing in the dark
hallway of the chambers, and her heart sank.</p>

<p>"Matilda, you're a fool," she said to herself.</p>

<p>Her name was not Matilda, but in moments of self-depreciation
she was wont to address herself as such.</p>

<p>She walked boldly up to the entrance and passed through. The
man she saw out of the corner of her eye but did not recognize.
He seemed as little desirous of attracting attention as she. She
thought he was rather stout and short, but as to this she was
not sure. She raced up the stairs and turned on the landing to
her room. The door of No. 4 was still ajar&mdash;but what was
much more important, so was her door. There was no doubt about
it, between the edge of the door and the jamb there was a good
two inches of space, and she distinctly remembered not only
closing it, but also pushing it to make sure that it was fast.
What should she do? To her annoyance she felt a cold little
feeling inside her and her hands were trembling.</p>

<p>"If the lights were only on I'd take the risk," she thought;
but the lights were not on and it was necessary to pass into the
dark interior and into a darker bath-room&mdash;a room which is
notoriously adaptable for murder&mdash;before she could reach
the meter.</p>

<p>"Rubbish, Matilda!" she scoffed quaveringly, "go in, you
frightened little rabbit&mdash;you forgot to shut the door,
that's all."</p>

<p>She pushed the door open and with a shiver stepped
inside.</p>

<p>Then a sound made her stop dead. It was a shuffle and a creak
such as a dog might make if he brushed against the chair.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" she demanded.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>She took one step forward and then something reached out at
her. A big hand gripped her by the sleeve of her blouse and she
heard a deep breathing.</p>

<p>She bit her lips to stop the scream that arose, and with a
wrench tore herself free, leaving a portion of a sleeve in the
hands of the unknown.</p>

<p>She darted backward, slamming the door behind her. In two
flying strides she was at the door of No. 4, hammering with both
her fists.</p>

<p>"Drunk or sober he is a man! Drunk or sober he is a man!" she
muttered incoherently.</p>

<p>Only twice she beat upon the door when it opened suddenly and
Mr. Beale stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>She hardly noticed his tone.</p>

<p>"A man&mdash;a man, in my flat," she gasped, and showed her
torn sleeve, "a man...!"</p>

<p>He pushed her aside and made for the door.</p>

<p>"The key?" he said quickly.</p>

<p>With trembling fingers she extracted it from her pocket.</p>

<p>"One moment."</p>

<p>He disappeared into his own flat and presently came out
holding an electric torch. He snapped back the lock, put the key
in his pocket and then, to her amazement, he slipped a
short-barrelled revolver from his hip-pocket.</p>

<p>With his foot he pushed open the door and she watched him
vanish into the gloomy interior.</p>

<p>Presently came his voice, sharp and menacing:</p>

<p>"Hands up!"</p>

<p>A voice jabbered something excitedly and then she heard Mr.
Beale speak.</p>

<p>"Is your light working?&mdash;you can come in. I have him in
the dining-room."</p>

<p>She stepped into the bath-room, the shilling dropped through
the aperture, the screw grated as she turned it and the lights
sprang to life.</p>

<p>In one corner of the room was a man, a white-faced, sickly
looking man with a head too big for his body. His hands were
above his bead, his lower lip trembled in terror.</p>

<p>Mr. Beale was searching him with thoroughness and
rapidity.</p>

<p>"No gun, all right, put your hands down. Now turn out your
pockets."</p>

<p>The man said something in a language which the girl could not
understand, and Mr. Beale replied in the same tongue. He put the
contents, first of one pocket then of the other, upon the table,
and the girl watched the proceedings with open eyes.</p>

<p>"Hello, what's this?"</p>

<p>Beale picked up a card. Thereon was scribbled a figure which
might have been 6 or 4.</p>

<p>"I see," said Beale, "now the other pocket&mdash;you
understand English, my friend?"</p>

<p>Stupidly the man obeyed. A leather pocket-case came from an
inside pocket and this Beale opened.</p>

<p>Therein was a small packet which resembled the familiar
wrapper of a seidlitz powder. Beale spoke sharply in a language
which the girl realized was German, and the man shook his head.
He said something which sounded like "No good," several
times.</p>

<p>"I'm going to leave you here alone for awhile," said Beale,
"my friend and I are going downstairs together&mdash;I shall not
be long."</p>

<p>They went out of the flat together, the little man with the
big head protesting, and she heard their footsteps descending
the stairs. Presently Beale came up alone and walked into the
sitting-room. And then the strange unaccountable fact dawned on
her&mdash;he was perfectly sober.</p>

<p>His eyes were clear, his lips firm, and the fair hair whose
tendencies to bedragglement had emphasized his disgrace was
brushed back over his head. He looked at her so earnestly that
she grew embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Miss Cresswell," he said quietly. "I am going to ask you to
do me a great favour."</p>

<p>"If it is one that I can grant, you may be sure that I will,"
she smiled, and he nodded.</p>

<p>"I shall not ask you to do anything that is impossible in
spite of the humorist's view of women," he said. "I merely want
you to tell nobody about what has happened to-night."</p>

<p>"Nobody?" she looked at him in astonishment. "But the
doctor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not even the doctor," he said with a twinkle in his eye. "I
ask you this as a special favour&mdash;word of honour?"</p>

<p>She thought a moment.</p>

<p>"I promise," she said. "I'm to tell nobody about that horrid
man from whom you so kindly saved me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lifted his head.</p>

<p>"Understand this. Miss Cresswell, please," he said: "I don't
want you to be under any misapprehension about that 'horrid
man'&mdash;he was just as scared as you, and he would not have
harmed you. I have been waiting for him all the evening."</p>

<p>"Waiting for him?"</p>

<p>He nodded again,</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the doctor's flat," he said calmly, "you see, the doctor
and I are deadly rivals. We are rival scientists, and I was
waiting for the hairy man to steal a march on him."</p>

<p>"But, but&mdash;how did you get in."</p>

<p>"I had this key," he said holding up a small key, "remember,
word of honour! The man whom I have just left came up and wasn't
certain whether he had to go in No. 8, that's the doctor's, or
No. 6&mdash;and the one key fits both doors."</p>

<p>He inserted the key which was in the lock of her door and it
turned easily.</p>

<p>"And this is what I was waiting for&mdash;it was the best the
poor devil could do."</p>

<p>He lifted the paper package and broke the seals. Unfolding
the paper carefully he laid it on the table, revealing a
teaspoonful of what looked like fine green sawdust.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she whispered fearfully.</p>

<p>Somehow she knew that she was in the presence of a big
elementary danger&mdash;something gross and terrible in its
primitive force.</p>

<p>"That," said Mr. Beale, choosing his words nicely, "that is a
passable imitation of the Green Rust, or, as it is to me, the
Green Terror."</p>

<p>"The Green Rust? What is the Green Rust&mdash;what can it
do?" she asked in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall never know," he said, and in his clear eyes
was a hint of terror.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03">III. &mdash; PUNSONBY'S
DISCHARGE AN EMPLOYEE</a></h2>

<p class="first">OLIVA CRESSWELL rose with the final despairing
buzz of her alarm clock and conquered the almost irresistible
temptation to close her eyes, just to see what it felt like. Her
first impression was that she had had no sleep all night. She
remembered going to bed at one and turning from side to side
until three. She remembered deciding that the best thing to do
was to get up, make some tea and watch the sun rise, and that
whilst she was deciding whether such a step was romantic or just
silly, she must have gone to sleep.</p>

<p>Still, four hours of slumber is practically no slumber to a
healthy girl and she swung her pyjamaed legs over the side of
the bed and spent quite five minutes in a fatuous admiration of
her little white feet. With an effort she dragged herself to the
bath-room and let the tap run. Then she put on the kettle. Half
an hour later she was feeling well but unenthusiastic.</p>

<p>When she became fully conscious, which was on her way to
business, she realized she was worried. She had been made a
party to a secret without her wish&mdash;and the drunken Mr.
Beale, that youthful profligate, had really forced this
confidence upon her. Only, and this she recalled with a start
which sent her chin jerking upward (she was in the bus at the
time and the conductor, thinking she was signalling him to stop,
pulled the bell), only Mr. Beale was surprisingly sober and
masterful for one so weak of character.</p>

<p>Ought she to tell the doctor&mdash;Dr. van Heerden, who had
been so good a friend of hers? It seemed disloyal, it was
disloyal, horribly disloyal to him, to hide the fact that Mr.
Beale had actually been in the doctor's room at night.</p>

<p>But was it a coincidence that the same key opened her door
and the doctor's? If it were so, it was an embarrassing
coincidence. She must change the locks without delay.</p>

<p>The bus set her down at the corner of Punsonby's great block.
Punsonby's is one of the most successful and at the same time
one of the most exclusive dress-houses in London, and Oliva had
indeed been fortunate in securing her present position, for
employment at Punsonby's was almost equal to Government
employment in its permanency, as it was certainly more lucrative
in its pay.</p>

<p>As she stepped on to the pavement she glanced up at the big
ornate clock. She was in good time, she said to herself, and was
pushing open the big glass door through which employees pass to
the various departments when a hand touched her gently on the
arm.</p>

<p>She turned in surprise to face Mr. Beale, looking
particularly smart in a well-fitting grey suit, a grey felt hat
and a large bunch of violets in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>"Excuse me. Miss Cresswell," he said pleasantly, "may I have
one word with you?"</p>

<p>She looked at him doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I rather wish you had chosen another time and another place,
Mr. Beale," she said frankly.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"I realize it is rather embarrassing," he said, "but
unfortunately my business cannot wait. I am a business man, you
know," he smiled, "in spite of my dissolute habits."</p>

<p>She looked at him closely, for she thought she detected a
gentle mockery behind his words, but he was not smiling now.</p>

<p>"I won't keep you more than two minutes," he went on, "but in
that two minutes I have a great deal to tell you. I won't bore
you with the story of my life."</p>

<p>This time she saw the amusement in his eyes and smiled
against her will, because she was not feeling particularly
amused.</p>

<p>"I have a business in the city of London," he said, "and
again I would ask you to respect my confidence. I am a wheat
expert."</p>

<p>"A wheat expert?" she repeated with a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>"It's a queer job, isn't it? but that's what I am. I have a
vacancy in my office for a confidential secretary. It is a nice
office, the pay is good, the hours are few and the work is
light. I want to know whether you will accept the position."</p>

<p>She shook her head, regarding him with a new interest, from
which suspicion was not altogether absent.</p>

<p>"It is awfully kind of you, Mr. Beale, and adds another to
the debts I owe you," she said, "but I have no desire to leave
Punsonby's. It is work I like, and although I am sure you are
not interested in my private business "&mdash;he could have told
her that he was very much interested in her private business,
but he refrained&mdash;"I do not mind telling you that I am
earning a very good salary said I. have no intention or desire
to change my situation."</p>

<p>His eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"Ah well, that's my misfortune," he said, "there are only two
things I can say. The first is that if you work for me you will
neither be distressed nor annoyed by any habits of mine which
you may have observed and which may perhaps have prejudiced you
against me. In the second place, I want you to promise me that
if you ever leave Punsonby's you will give me the first offer of
your services."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"I think you are very funny, Mr. Beale, but I feel sure that
you mean what you say, and that you would confine
your&mdash;er&mdash;little eccentricities to times outside of
business hours. As far as leaving Punsonby's is concerned I
promise you that I will give you the first offer of my
invaluable services if ever I leave. And now I am afraid I must
run away. I am awfully obliged to you for what you did for me
last night."</p>

<p>He looked at her steadily in the eye.</p>

<p>"I have no recollection of anything that happened last
night," he said, "and I should be glad if your memory would
suffer the same lapse."</p>

<p>He shook hands with her, lifted his hat and turned abruptly
away, and she looked after him till the boom of the clock
recalled her to the fact that the head of the firm of Punsonby
was a stickler for punctuality.</p>

<p>She went into the great cloak-room and hung up her coat and
hat. As she turned to the mirror to straighten her hair she came
face to face with a tall, dark girl who had been eyeing her
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Oliva, and there was in her tone more of
politeness than friendship, for although these two girls had
occupied the same office for more than a year, there was between
them an incompatibility which no length of acquaintance could
remove. Hilda Glaum was of Swiss extraction, and something of a
mystery. She was good looking in a sulky, saturnine way, but her
known virtues stopped short at her appearance. She neither
invited nor gave confidence, and in this respect suited Oliva,
but unlike Oliva, she made no friends, entered into none of the
periodical movements amongst the girls, was impervious to the
attractions of the river in summer and of the Proms in winter,
neither visited nor received.</p>

<p>"'Morning," replied the girl shortly; then; "Have you been
upstairs?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing."</p>

<p>Oliva mounted to the floor where her little office was. She
and Hilda dealt with the registered mail, extracted and checked
the money that came from the post-shoppers and sent on the
orders to the various departments.</p>

<p>Three sealed bags lay on her desk, and a youth from the
postal department waited to receive a receipt for them. This she
scribbled, after comparing the numbers attached to the seals
with those inscribed on the boy's receipt-book.</p>

<p>For some reason Hilda had not followed her, and she was alone
and had tumbled the contents of the first bag on to her desk
when the managing director of Punsonby's made a surprising
appearance at the glass-panelled door of her office.</p>

<p>He was a large, stout and important-looking man, bald and
bearded. He enjoyed an episcopal manner, and had a trick of
pulling back his head when he asked questions, as though he
desired to evade the full force of the answer.</p>

<p>He stood in the doorway and beckoned her out, and she went
without any premonition of what was in store for her.</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Cresswell," he said. "I&mdash;ah&mdash;am sorry I
did not see you before you had taken off your coat and hat. Will
you come to my office?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. White," said the girl, wondering what had
happened. He led the way with his majestic stride, dangling a
pair of pince-nez by their cord, as a fastidious person might
carry a mouse by its tail, and ushered her into his
rosewood-panelled office.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down. Miss Cresswell," he said, and seating
himself at his desk he put the tips of his fingers together and
looked up to the ceiling for inspiration. "I am afraid. Miss
Cresswell," he said, "that I have&mdash;ah&mdash;an unpleasant
task."</p>

<p>"An unpleasant task, Mr. White?" she said, with a sinking
feeling inside her. He nodded.</p>

<p>"I have to tell you that Punsonby's no longer require your
services."</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, looking down at him open-mouthed with
wonder and consternation.</p>

<p>"Not require my services?" she said slowly. "Do you mean that
I am discharged?"</p>

<p>He nodded again.</p>

<p>"In lieu of a month's notice I will give you a cheque 'for a
month's salary, plus the unexpired portion of this week's
salary."</p>

<p>"But why am I being discharged? Why? Why?" Mr. White, who had
opened his eyes for a moment to watch the effect of his
lightning stroke, closed them again.</p>

<p>"It is not the practice of Punsonby's to give any reason for
dispensing with the services of its employees," he said
oracularly, "it is sufficient that I should tell you that
hitherto you have given every satisfaction, but for reasons
which I am not prepared to discuss we must dispense with your
services."</p>

<p>Her head was in a whirl. She could not grasp what had
happened. For five years she had worked in the happiest
circumstances in this great store, where everybody had been kind
to her and where her tasks had been congenial. She had never
thought of going elsewhere. She regarded herself, as did all the
better-class employees, as a fixture.</p>

<p>"Do I understand," she asked, "that I am to leave&mdash;at
once?"</p>

<p>Mr. White nodded. He pushed the cheque across the table and
she took it up and folded it mechanically.</p>

<p>"And you are not going to tell me why?"</p>

<p>Mr. White shook his head.</p>

<p>"Punsonby's do nothing without a good reason," he said
solemnly, feeling that whatever happened he must make a good
case for Punsonby's, and that whoever was to blame for this
unhappy incident it was not an august firm which paid its
fourteen per cent. with monotonous regularity. "We
lack&mdash;ah&mdash;definite knowledge to proceed any further in
this matter than&mdash;in fact, than we have proceeded. Definite
knowledge" (the girl was all the more bewildered by his
cumbersome diplomacy) "definite knowledge was promised but has
not&mdash;in fact, has not come to hand. It is all very
unpleasant&mdash;very unpleasant," and he shook his head.</p>

<p>She bowed and turning, walked quickly from the room, passed
to the lobby where her coat was hung, put on her hat and left
Punsonby's for ever.</p>

<p>It was when she had reached the street that, with a shock,
she remembered Beale's words and she stood stock-still, pinching
her lip thoughtfully. Had he known? Why had he come that
morning, hours before he was ordinarily visible&mdash;if the
common gossip of Krooman Mansions be worthy of
credence?&mdash;and then as though to cap the amazing events of
the morning she saw him. He was standing on the corner of the
street, leaning on his cane, smoking a long cigarette through a
much longer holder, and he seemed wholly absorbed in watching a
linesman, perched high above the street, repairing a telegraph
wire.</p>

<p>She made a step toward him, but stopped. He was so evidently
engrossed in the acrobatics of the honest workman in mid-air
that he could not have seen her and she turned swiftly and
walked the other way.</p>

<p>She had not reached the end of the block before he was at her
side.</p>

<p>"You are going home early. Miss Cresswell," he smiled.</p>

<p>She turned to him.</p>

<p>"Do you know why?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know why&mdash;unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"Unless you have been discharged," he said coolly.</p>

<p>Her brows knit. "What do you know about my discharge?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Such things are possible," said Mr. Beale.</p>

<p>"Did you know I was going to be discharged?" she asked again.
He nodded.</p>

<p>"I didn't exactly know you would be discharged this morning,
but I had an idea you would be discharged at some time or other.
That is why I came with my offer."</p>

<p>"Which, of course, I won't accept," she snapped.</p>

<p>"Which, of course, you have accepted," he said quietly.
"Believe me, I know nothing more than that Punsonby's have been
prevailed upon to discharge you. What reason induced them to
take that step, honestly I don't know."</p>

<p>"But why did you think so?"</p>

<p>He was grave of a sudden. "I just thought so," he said. "I am
not going to be mysterious with you and I can only tell you that
I had reasons to believe that some such step would be
taken."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders wearily. "It is quite mysterious
enough," she said. "Do you seriously want me to work for you?"
He nodded. "You didn't tell me your city address."</p>

<p>"That is why I came back," he said.</p>

<p>"Then you knew I was coming out?"</p>

<p>"I knew you would come out some time in the day." She stared
at him.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that you would have waited all day to
give me your address?"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"I only mean this," he replied, "that I should nave waited
all day."</p>

<p>It was a helpless laugh which echoed his. "My address is 342
Lothbury," he went on, "342. You may begin work this afternoon
and&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

<p>"And?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"And I think it would be wise if you didn't tell your friend,
the doctor, that I am employing you."</p>

<p>He was examining his finger-nails attentively as he spoke,
and he did not meet her eye.</p>

<p>"There are many reasons," he went on. "In the first place, I
have blotted my copy-book, as they say, in Krooman Mansions, and
it might not rebound to your credit."</p>

<p>"You should have thought of that before you asked me to come
to you," she said.</p>

<p>"I thought of it a great deal," he replied calmly.</p>

<p>There was much in what he said, as the girl recognized. She
blamed herself for her hasty promise, but somehow the events of
the previous night had placed him on a different footing, had
given him a certain indefinable position to which the inebriate
Mr. Beale had not aspired.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am rather bewildered by all the mystery of
it," she said, "and I don't think I will come to the office
to-day. To-morrow morning, at what hour?"</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock," he said, "I will be there to explain your
duties. Your salary will be &pound;5 a week. You will be in
charge of the office, to which I very seldom go, by the way, and
your work will be preparing statistical returns of the
wheat-crops in all the wheat-fields of the world for the last fifty
years."</p>

<p>"It sounds thrilling," she said, and a quick smile flashed
across his face.</p>

<p>"It is much more thrilling than you imagine," were his
parting words.</p>

<p>She reached Krooman Mansions just as the doctor was coming
out, and he looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>"You are back early!"</p>

<p>Should she tell him? There was no reason why she shouldn't.
He had been a good friend of hers and she felt sure of his
sympathy. It occurred to her at that moment that Mr. Beale had
been most unsympathetic, and had not expressed one word of
regret.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been discharged," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Discharged? Impossible!"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"To prove that it is possible it has happened," she said
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, this is monstrous! What excuse did they
give?"</p>

<p>"None." This was said with a lightness of tone which did not
reflect the indignation she felt at heart.</p>

<p>"Did they give you no reason?"</p>

<p>"They gave me none. They gave me my month's cheque and just
told me to go off, and off I came like the well-disciplined
wage-earner I am."</p>

<p>"But it is monstrous," he said indignantly. "I will go and
see them. I know one of the heads of the firm&mdash;at least, he
is a patient of mine."</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the kind," she replied firmly. "It
really doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do? By Jove!" he said suddenly, "what
a splendid idea! I want a clinical secretary."</p>

<p>The humour of it got the better of her, and she laughed in
his face.</p>

<p>"What is the joke?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry, doctor, but you mustn't think I am
ungrateful, but I am beginning to regard myself as one of the
plums in the labour market."</p>

<p>"Have you another position?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"I have just accepted one," she said, and he did not disguise
his disappointment, which might even have been interpreted, were
Oliva more conceited, into absolute chagrin.</p>

<p>"You are very quick," said he, and his voice had lost some of
its enthusiasm. "What position have you taken?"</p>

<p>"I am going into an office in the city," she said.</p>

<p>"That will be dull. If you have settled it in your mind, of
course, I cannot alter your decision, but I would be quite
willing to give you &pound;5 or &pound;6 a week, and the work
would be very light."</p>

<p>She held out her hand, and there was a twinkle in her eye.
"London is simply filled with people who want to give me 5 a
week for work which is very light; really I am awfully grateful
to you, doctor."</p>

<p>She felt more cheerful as she mounted the stairs than she
thought would have been possible had such a position been
forecast and had she to speculate upon the attitude of mind with
which she would meet such a misfortune.</p>

<p>Punsonby's, for all the humiliation of her dismissal, seemed
fairly unimportant. Some day she would discover the
circumstances which had decided the high gods who presided over
the ready-made clothing business in their action.</p>

<p>She unlocked the door and passed in, not without a
comprehensive and an amused glance which took in the sober front
doors of her new employer and her would-be employer.</p>

<p>"Sarah, your luck's in," she said, as she banged the
door&mdash;Sarah was the approving version of Matilda. "If the
wheezy man fires you, be sure there'll be a good angel waiting
on the doorstep to offer you &pound;20 a week for 'phoning the
office once a day."</p>

<p>It occurred to her that it would be wise to place on record
her protest against her summary dismissal, and she went to the
little bookshelf-writing-table where she kept her
writing-material to indite the epistle whilst she thought of it.
It was one of those little fumed-oak contraptions where the desk is
formed by a hinged flap which serves when not in use to close
the desk.</p>

<p>She pulled out the two little supports, inserted the key in
the lock, but it refused to turn, for the simple reason that it
was unlocked. She had distinctly remembered that morning locking
it after putting away the bill which had arrived with the
morning post.</p>

<p>She pulled down the flap slowly and stared in amazement at
the little which it hid. Every pigeon-hole had been ransacked
and the contents were piled up in a confused heap. The two tiny
drawers in which she kept stamps and nibs were out and
emptied.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04">IV. &mdash; THE LETTERS THAT
WERE NOT THERE</a></h2>

<p class="first">SHE made a rapid survey of the documents. They
were unimportant, and consisted mainly of letters from the few
girl friends she had made during her stay at
Punsonby's&mdash;old theatre programmes, recipes copied from
newspapers and bunches of snapshots taken on her last summer
excursion.</p>

<p>She arranged the things in some sort of rough order and made
an inspection of her bedroom. Here, too, there was evidence that
somebody had been searching the room. The drawers of her
dressing-table were open, and though the contents had been
little disturbed, it was clear that they had been searched. She
made another discovery. The window of the bedroom was open at
the bottom. Usually it was open half-way down from the top, and
was fastened in that position by a patent catch. This precaution
was necessary, because the window looked upon a narrow iron
parapet which ran along the building and communicated with the
fire-escape. She looked out. Evidently the intruder had both
come and gone this way, and as evidently her return had
disturbed him in his inspection, for it was hardly likely he
would leave her papers and bureau in that state of
confusion.</p>

<p>She made a brief inspection of the drawers in the
dressing-table, and so far as she could see nothing was missing.
She went back to the writing-bureau, mechanically put away the
papers, little memorandum-books and letters which had been
dragged from their pigeon-holes, then resting her elbow on the
desk she sat, chin in hand, her pretty forehead wrinkled in a
frown, recalling the events of the morning.</p>

<p>Who had searched her desk? What did they hope to discover?
She had no illusions that this was the work of a common thief.
There was something behind all this, something sinister and
terrifying.</p>

<p>What association had the search with her summary dismissal
and what did the pompous Mr. White mean when he talked about
definite knowledge? Definite knowledge of what? She gave it up
with a shrug. She was not as much alarmed as disturbed. Life was
grating a little, and she resented this departure from the
smooth course which it had hitherto run. She resented the
intrusion of Mr. Beale, who was drunk one moment and sober the
next, who had offices in the city which he did not visit and who
took such an inordinate interest in her affairs, and she
resented him all the more because, in some indefinable way, he
had shaken her faith&mdash;no, not shaken her faith, that was
too strong a term&mdash;he had pared the mild romance which Dr.
van Heerden's friendship represented.</p>

<p>She got up from the table and paced the room, planning her
day. She would go out to lunch and indulge in the dissipation of
a matinee. Perhaps she would stay out to dinner and come
back&mdash;she shivered unconsciously and looked round the room.
Somehow she did not look forward to an evening spent alone in
her flat.</p>

<p>"Matilda, you're getting maudlin," she said, "you are getting
romantic, too. You are reading too many sensational novels and
seeing too many sensational films."</p>

<p>She walked briskly into her bedroom, unhooked a suit from the
wardrobe and laid it on the bed.</p>

<p>At that moment there came a knock at the door. She put down
the clothes-brush which was in her hand, walked out into the
hall, opened the door and stepped back. Three men stood in the
passage without. Two were strangers with that curious official
look which the plain-clothes policeman can never wholly
eradicate from his bearing. The third was Mr. White, more
pompous and more solemn than ever.</p>

<p>"Miss Cresswell?" asked one of the strangers.</p>

<p>"That is my name."</p>

<p>"May we come inside? I want to see you."</p>

<p>She led the way to her little sitting-room. Mr. White
followed in the rear.</p>

<p>"Your name is Oliva Cresswell. You were recently employed by
Punsonby's, Limited, as cashier."</p>

<p>"That is true," she said, wondering what was coming next.</p>

<p>"Certain information was laid against you," said the
spokesman, "as a result of which you were discharged from the
firm this morning?"</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows in indignant surprise.</p>

<p>"Information laid against me?" she said haughtily. "What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean, that a charge was made against you that you were
converting money belonging to the firm to your own use. That was
the charge, I believe, sir?" He turned to Mr. White.</p>

<p>Mr. White nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"It is a lie. It is an outrageous lie," cried the girl,
turning naming eyes upon the stout managing director of
Punsonby's. "You know it's a lie, Mr. White! Thousands of pounds
have passed through my hands and I have never&mdash;oh, it's
cruel."</p>

<p>"If you will only keep calm for a little while, miss," said
the man, who was not unused to such outbreaks, "I will explain
that at the moment of your dismissal there was no evidence
against you."</p>

<p>"No definite knowledge of your offence," murmured Mr.
White.</p>

<p>"And now?" demanded the girl.</p>

<p>"Now we have information, miss, to the effect that three
registered letters, containing in all the sum of
&pound;63&mdash;"</p>

<p>"... Fourteen and sevenpence," murmured Mr. White.</p>

<p>"Sixty-three pounds odd," said the detective, "which were
abstracted by you yesterday are concealed in this flat."</p>

<p>"In the left-hand bottom drawer of your bureau," murmured Mr.
White. "That is the definite knowledge which has come to
us&mdash;it is a great pity."</p>

<p>The girl stared from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Three registered envelopes," she said incredulously; "in
this flat?"</p>

<p>"In the bottom drawer of your bureau," mumbled Mr. White, who
stood throughout the interview with his eyes closed, his hands
clasped in front of him, a picture of a man performing a most
painful act of duty.</p>

<p>"I have a warrant&mdash;" began the detective.</p>

<p>"You need no warrant," said the girl quietly, "you are at
liberty to search this flat or bring a woman to search me. I
have nothing in these rooms which I am ashamed that you should
see."</p>

<p>The detective turned to his companion.</p>

<p>"Fred," he said, "just have a look over that writing-bureau.
Is it locked, miss?"</p>

<p>She had closed and locked the secretaire and she handed the
man the key. The detective who had done the speaking passed into
the bedroom, and the girl heard him pulling out the drawers. She
did not move from where she stood confronting her late employer,
still preserving his attitude of somnolent detachment.</p>

<p>"Mr. White," she asked quietly, "I have a right to know who
accused me of stealing from your firm."</p>

<p>He made no reply.</p>

<p>"Even a criminal has a right to that, you know," she said,
recovering some of her poise. "I suppose that you have been
missing things for quite a long while&mdash;people always miss
things for quite a long while before the thief is discovered,
according to the Sunday papers."</p>

<p>"I do not read newspapers published on the Lord's Day," said
Mr. White reproachfully. "I do not know the habits of the
criminal classes, but as you say, and I fear I must convey the
gist of your speech to the officers of the law, money has been
missed from your department for a considerable time. As to your
accuser, acting as&mdash;ah&mdash;as a good citizen and
performing the duties which are associated with good-citizenship,
I cannot reveal his, her, or their name."</p>

<p>She was eyeing him curiously with a gleam of dormant laughter
in her clear eyes. Then she heard a hurried footstep in the
little passage and remembered that the door had been left open
and she looked round.</p>

<p>The new-corner was Dr. van Heerden.</p>

<p>"What is this I hear?" he demanded fiercely, addressing
White. "You dare accuse Miss Cresswell of theft?"</p>

<p>"My dear doctor," began White.</p>

<p>"It is an outrage," said the doctor. "It is disgraceful, Mr.
White. I will vouch for Miss Cresswell with my life."</p>

<p>The girl stopped him with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Please don't be dramatic, doctor. It's really a stupid
mistake. I didn't know you knew Mr. White."</p>

<p>"It is a disgraceful mistake," said the doctor violently. "I
am surprised at you, White."</p>

<p>Mr. White could not close his eyes any tighter than they were
closed. He passed the responsibility for the situation upon an
invisible Providence with one heaving shrug of his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is awfully kind of you to take this interest, doctor,"
said the girl, putting out her hands to him, "it was just like
you."</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do?" he asked earnestly. "You can
depend upon me to the last shilling if any trouble arises out of
this."</p>

<p>"No trouble will arise out of it," she said. "Mr. White
thinks that I have stolen money and that that money is hidden in
the flat&mdash;by the way, who told you that I had been
accused?"</p>

<p>For a moment he was taken aback; then: "I saw the police
officers go into your flat. I recognized them, and as they were
accompanied by White, and you had been dismissed this morning, I
drew my own conclusions."</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the detective came back from the
bedroom.</p>

<p>"There's nothing there," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. White opened his eyes to their fullest extent.</p>

<p>"In the bottom drawer of the bureau?" he asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Neither in the bottom drawer nor the top drawer," said the
detective. "Have you found anything, Fred?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the other man.</p>

<p>"Have a look behind those pictures."</p>

<p>They turned up the comers of the carpets, searched her one
little bookcase, looked under the tables, an unnecessary and
amusing proceeding in the girl's eyes till the detective
explained with that display of friendliness which all policemen
show to suspected persons whom they do not at heart suspect, it
was not an uncommon process for criminals to tack the proceeds
of bank-note robberies to the underside of the table.</p>

<p>"Well, miss," said the detective at last, with a smile, "I
hope we haven't worried you very much. What do you intend doing,
sir?" He addressed White.</p>

<p>"Did you search the bottom drawer of the bureau?" said Mr.
White again.</p>

<p>"I searched the bottom drawer of the bureau, the top drawer
and the middle drawer," said the detective patiently. "I
searched the back of the bureau, the trinket-drawer, the
trinket-boxes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And it was not there?" said Mr. White, as though he could
not believe his ears.</p>

<p>"It was not there. What I want to know is, do you charge this
young lady? If you charge her, of course you take all the
responsibility for the act, and if you fail to convict her you
will be liable to an action for false arrest."</p>

<p>"I know, I know, I know," said Mr. White, with remarkable
asperity in one so placid. "No, I do not charge her. I am sorry
you have been inconvenienced,"&mdash;he turned to the girl in
his most majestic manner&mdash;"and I trust that you bear no
ill-will."</p>

<p>He offered a large and flabby hand, but Oliva ignored it.</p>

<p>"Mind you don't trip over the mat as you go out," she said,
"the passage is rather dark."</p>

<p>Mr. White left the room, breathing heavily.</p>

<p>"Excuse me one moment," said the doctor in a low voice. "I
have a few words to say to White."</p>

<p>"Please don't make a fuss," said Oliva, "I would rather the
matter dropped where it is."</p>

<p>He nodded, and strode out after the managing director of
Punsonby's. They made a little group of four.</p>

<p>"Can I see you in my flat for a moment, Mr. White?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mr. White cheerfully.</p>

<p>"You don't want us any more?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. White; then: "Are you quite sure you searched
the bottom drawer of the bureau?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly sure," said the detective irritably, "you don't
suppose I've been at this job for twenty years and should
overlook the one place where I expected to find the
letters."</p>

<p>Mr. White was saved the labour of framing a suitable retort,
for the door of Mr. Beale's flat was flung open and Mr. Beale
came forth. His grey hat was on the back of his head and he
stood erect with the aid of the door-post, surveying with a
bland and inane smile the little knot of men.</p>

<p>"Why," he said jovially, "it's the dear old doctor, and if my
eyes don't deceive me, it's the jolly old Archbishop."</p>

<p>Mr. White brindled. That he was known as the Archbishop in
the intimate circles of his acquaintances afforded him a certain
satisfaction. That a perfect stranger, and a perfectly drunken
stranger at that, should employ a nickname which was for the use
of a privileged few, distressed him.</p>

<p>"And," said the swaying man by the door, peering through the
half-darkness: "Is it not Detective-Sergeant Peterson and
Constable Fairbank? Welcome to this home of virtue."</p>

<p>The detective-sergeant smiled but said nothing. The doctor
fingered his beard indecisively, but Mr. White essayed to stride
past, his chin in the air, ignoring the greeting, but Mr. Beale
was too quick for him. He lurched forward, caught the lapels of
the other's immaculate frock-coat and held himself erect
thereby.</p>

<p>"My dear old Whitey," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't know you, sir," cried Mr. White, "will you please
unhand me?"</p>

<p>"Don't know me, Whitey? Why you astonishing old thing!"</p>

<p>He slipped his arm over the other's shoulder in an attitude
of affectionate regard. "Don't know old Beale?"</p>

<p>"I never met you before," said Mr. White, struggling to
escape.</p>

<p>"Bless my life and soul," said Mr. Beale, stepping back,
shocked and hurt, "I call you to witnesh, Detective-Sergeant
Peterson and amiable Constable Fairbank and learned Dr. van
Heerden, that he has denied me. And it has come to this," he
said bitterly, and leaning his head against the door-post he
howled like a dog.</p>

<p>"I say, stop your fooling, Beale," said the doctor angrily,
"there's been very serious business here, and I should thank you
not to interfere."</p>

<p>Mr. Beale wiped imaginary tears from his eyes, grasped Mr.
White's unwilling hand and shook it vigorously, staggered back
to his flat and slammed the door behind him.</p>

<p>"Do you know that man?" asked the doctor, turning to the
detective.</p>

<p>"I seem to remember his face," said the sergeant. "Come on,
Fred. Good morning, gentlemen."</p>

<p>They waited till the officers were downstairs and out of
sight, and then the doctor turned to the other and in a
different tone from any he had employed, said:</p>

<p>"Come into my room for a moment, White," and Mr. White
followed him obediently.</p>

<p>They shut the door and passed into the study, with its rows
of heavily bound books, its long table covered with test-tubes
and the paraphernalia of medical research.</p>

<p>"Well," said White, dropping into a chair, "what
happened?"</p>

<p>"That is what I want to know," said the doctor.</p>

<p>He took a cigarette from a box on the table and lit it and
the two men looked at one another without speaking.</p>

<p>"Do you think she had the letters and hid them?"</p>

<p>"Impossible," replied the doctor briefly.</p>

<p>White grunted, took a cigar from a long leather case, bit off
the end savagely and reached out his hand for a match.</p>

<p>"'The best-laid schemes of mice and men!'" he quoted.</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up," said the doctor savagely.</p>

<p>He was pacing the study with long strides. He stopped at one
end of the room staring moodily through the window, his hands
thrust in his pockets.</p>

<p>"I wonder what happened," he said again. "Well, that can
wait. Now just tell me exactly how matters stand in regard to
you and Punsonby's."</p>

<p>"I have all the figures here," said Mr. White, as he thrust
his hand into the inside pocket of his frock-coat, "I can raise
&pound;40,000 by debentures and&mdash;hello, what's this?"</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a white packet, fastened about by a
rubber band. This he slipped off and gasped, for in his hands
were three registered letters, and they were addressed to
Messrs. Punsonby, and each had been slit open.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05">V. &mdash; THE MAN WITH THE BIG
HEAD</a></h2>

<p class="first">No. 342, Lothbury, is a block of business
offices somewhat unpretentious in their approach but of
surprising depth and importance when explored. Oliva Cresswell
stood for awhile in the great lobby, inspecting the names of the
occupants, which were inscribed on porcelain slips in two big
frames on each wall of the vestibule.</p>

<p>After a lengthy search she discovered the name of the Beale
Agency under the heading "fourth floor" and made her way to the
elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. Beale's office was at the end of a seemingly interminable
corridor and consisted, as she was to find, of an outer and an
inner chamber. The outer was simply furnished with a table, two
chairs and a railed fence bisected with a little wooden
gateway.</p>

<p>A boy sat at one table, engaged in laborious exercise on a
typewriter with one finger of one hand.</p>

<p>He jumped up as she came through the door.</p>

<p>"Miss Cresswell?" he asked. "Mr. Beale will see you."</p>

<p>He opened the wicket-gate and led the way to a door marked
"Private."</p>

<p>It was Beale who opened the door in response to the
knock.</p>

<p>"Come in, Miss Cresswell," he said cheerily, "I didn't expect
you for half an hour."</p>

<p>"I thought I'd start well," she smiled.</p>

<p>She had had many misgivings that morning, and had spent a
restless night debating the wisdom of engaging herself to an
employer whose known weakness had made his name a by-word. But a
promise was a promise and, after all, she told herself, her
promise was fulfilled when she had given the new work a
trial.</p>

<p>"Here is your desk," he said, indicating a large office table
in the centre of the room, "and here is my little library. You
will note that it mainly consists of agricultural returns and
reports&mdash;do you read French?" She nodded. "Good, and
Spanish&mdash;that's rather too much to expect, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I speak and read Spanish very well," she said. "When I was a
little girl I lived around in Paris, Lyons, and
Barcelona&mdash;my first regular work&mdash;the first I was paid
for&mdash;was in the Anglo-Spanish Cable office in
Barcelona."</p>

<p>"That's lucky," he said, apparently relieved, "though I could
have taught you the few words that it is necessary you should
know to understand the Argentine reports. What I particularly
want you to discover&mdash;and you will find two or three
hundred local guide-books on that shelf at the far end of the
room, and these will help you a great deal&mdash;is the exact
locations of all the big wheat-growing districts, the number of
hectares under cultivation in normal times, the method by which
the wheat areas are divided&mdash;by fences, roads,
etc.&mdash;the average size of the unbroken blocks of wheatland
and, if possible, the width of the roads or paths which divide
them."</p>

<p>"Gracious!" she cried in dismay.</p>

<p>"It sounds a monumental business, but I think you will find
it simple. The Agricultural Department of the United States
Government, for instance, tabulate all those facts. For example,
they compel farmers in certain districts to keep a clear space
between each lot so that in case of the crops being fired, the
fire may be isolated. Canada, the Argentine and Australia have
other methods."</p>

<p>She had seated herself at the desk and was jotting down a
note of her duties.</p>

<p>"Anything more?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I want the names of the towns in the centre of the
wheat-growing areas, a list of the hotels in those towns. The
guide-books you will find up to date, and these will inform you
on this subject. Particularly do I want hotels noted where
automobiles can be hired, the address of the local bank and the
name of the manager and, where the information is available, the
name of the chief constable, sheriff or chef d'gendarmerie in
each district."</p>

<p>She looked up at him, her pencil poised.</p>

<p>"Are you serious&mdash;of course, I'll do all this, but
somehow it reminds me of a story I once read&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know it," said Beale promptly, "it is 'The Case of the
Red-Haired Man,' one of Doyle's stories about a man who, to keep
him away from his shop, was employed on the useless task of
copying the Encyclopaedia Britannica&mdash;no, I am asking you
to do serious work, Miss Cresswell&mdash;work which I do not
want spoken about."</p>

<p>He sat on the edge of the table, looking down at her, and if
his eyes were smiling it was because that was their natural
expression. She had never seen them when they did not hold the
ghost of some joke inwardly enjoyed.</p>

<p>But her instinct told her that he was very much in earnest
and that the task he had set her was one which had reason behind
it.</p>

<p>"Take the districts first and work up the hotels, et cetera,"
he suggested, "you will find it more interesting than a novel.
Those little books," he pointed to the crowded shelf by the
window, "will carry you to stations and ranches and farms all
over the world. You shall be wafted through Manitoba, and cross
the United States from New England to California. You will know
Sydney and Melbourne and the great cornland at the back of
beyond. And you'll sit in cool patios and sip iced drinks with
Senor Don Perfecto de Cuba who has ridden in from his rancio to
inquire the price of May wheat, or maybe you'll just amble
through India on an elephant, sleeping in bungalows, listening
to the howling of tigers, mosquitoes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now I know you're laughing at me," she smiled.</p>

<p>"Not altogether," he said quietly; then: "Is there any
question you'd like to ask me? By the way, the key of the office
is in the right-hand drawer; go to lunch when you like and stay
away as long as you like. Your cheque will be paid you every
Friday morning."</p>

<p>"But where&mdash;?" She looked round the room. "Where do you
work?"</p>

<p>"I don't work," he said promptly, "you do the work and I get
the honour and glory. When I come in I will sit on the edge of
your desk, which is not graceful but it is very comfortable.
There is one question I meant to ask you. You said you were in a
cable office&mdash;do you add to your accomplishments a working
knowledge of the Morse Code?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I can see you being useful. If you need me"&mdash;he jerked
his head toward a telephone on a small table&mdash;"call 8761
Gerrard."</p>

<p>"And where is that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"If I thought you were anything but a very sane young lady, I
should tell you that it is the number of my favourite bar," he
said gravely. "I will not, however, practise that harmless
deception upon you."</p>

<p>Again she saw the dancing light of mischief in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You're a queer man," she said, "and I will not make myself
ridiculous by speaking to you for your good."</p>

<p>She heard his soft laughter as the door closed behind him
and, gathering an armful of the guide-books, she settled down
for a morning's work which proved even more fascinating than his
fanciful pictures had suggested. She found herself wondering to
what use all this information she extracted could be put. Was
Mr. Beale really a buyer or was he interested in the sale of
agricultural machinery? Why should he want to know that Jonas
Scobbs was the proprietor of Scobbs' Hotel and General Emporium
in the town of Red Horse Valley, Alberta, and what significance
attached to the fact that he had an automobile for hire or that
he ran a coach every Wednesday to Regina?</p>

<p>Then she fell to speculating upon the identity and appearance
of this man who bore this weird name of Scobbs. She pictured him
an elderly man with chin whiskers who wore his pants thrust into
top-boots. And why was Red Horse Valley so called? These
unexpected and, to her, hitherto unknown names of places and
people set in train most interesting processions of thought that
slid through the noisy jangle of traffic, and coloured the drab
walls of all that was visible of the City of London through the
window with the white lights and purple shadows of dream
prairies.</p>

<p>When she looked at her watch&mdash;being impelled to that act
by the indescribable sensation of hunger&mdash;she was amazed to
discover that it was three o'clock.</p>

<p>She jumped up and went to the outer office in search of the
boy who, she faintly remembered, had erupted into her presence
hours before with a request which she had granted without
properly hearing. He was not in evidence. Evidently his petition
had also been associated with the gnawing pangs which assail
boyhood at one o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>She was turning back to her office, undecided as to whether
she should remain until his return or close the office entirely,
when the shuffle of feet brought her round.</p>

<p>The outer office was partitioned from the entrance by a long
"fence," the farther end of which was hidden by a screen of wood
and frosted glass. It was from behind that screen that the noise
came and she remembered that she had noted a chair
there&mdash;evidently a place where callers waited.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" she asked.</p>

<p>There was a creak as the visitor rose. "Eggscuse, mattam,"
said a wheezy voice, "I gall to engvire for Mister Peale, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>He shuffled forward into view, a small man with a dead white
face and a head of monstrous size.</p>

<p>She was bereft of speech and could only look at him, for this
was the man she had found in her rooms the night before her
dismissal&mdash;the man who carried the Green Rust.</p>

<p>Evidently he did not recognize her.</p>

<p>"Mister Peale, he tolt me, I must gall him mit der telephone,
but der nomber she vas gone oudt of mine head!"</p>

<p>He blinked at her with his short-sighted eyes and laid a big
hairy hand on the gate.</p>

<p>"You must&mdash;you mustn't come in," she said breathlessly.
"I will call Mr. Beale&mdash;sit&mdash;sit down again."</p>

<p>"Sch," he said obediently, and shuffled back to his chair,
"dell him der Herr Brofessor it was."</p>

<p>The girl took up the telephone receiver with a shaking hand
and gave the number. It was Beale's voice that answered her.</p>

<p>"There's a man here," she said hurriedly,
"a&mdash;a&mdash;the man&mdash;who was in my room&mdash;the Herr
Professor."</p>

<p>She heard his exclamation of annoyance.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," and if she could judge by the inflection of his
voice his sorrow was genuine. "I'll be with you in ten
minutes&mdash;he's quite a harmless old gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hurry, please."</p>

<p>She heard the "click" of his receiver and replaced her own
slowly. She did not attempt to go back to the outer office, but
waited by the closed door. She recalled the night, the terror of
that unknown presence in her darkened flat, and shuddered. Then
Beale, surprisingly sober, had come in and he and the "burglar"
had gone away together.</p>

<p>What had these two, Mr. Beale and the "Herr Professor," in
common? She heard the snap of the outer door, and Beale's voice
speaking quickly. It was probably German&mdash;she had never
acquired the language and hardly recognized it, though the
guttural "Zu befel, Herr Peale" was distinct.</p>

<p>She heard the shuffle of the man's feet and the closing of
the outer door and then Beale came in, and his face was
troubled.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you how sorry I am that the old man
called&mdash;I'd forgotten that he was likely to come."</p>

<p>She leant against the table, both hands behind her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Beale," she said, "will you give me straightforward
answers to a number of plain questions?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "If I can," he said.</p>

<p>"Is the Herr Professor a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I know him and in a way I am sorry for him. He is a
German who pretends to be Russian. Immensely poor and
unprepossessing to a painful degree, but a very clever
scientist. In fact, a truly great analytical chemist who ought
to be holding a good position. He told me that he had the best
qualifications, and I quite believe him, but that his physical
infirmities, his very freakishness had ruined him."</p>

<p>Her eyes softened with pity&mdash;the pity of the strong for
the weak, of the beautiful for the hideous.</p>

<p>"If that is true&mdash;" she began, and his chin went up. "I
beg your pardon, I know it is true. It is tragic, but&mdash;did
you know him before you met him in my room?"</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>"I knew him both by repute and by sight," he said. "I knew
the work he was engaged on and I guessed why he was engaged. But
I had never spoken to him."</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;now for question number two. You needn't
answer unless you wish."</p>

<p>"I shan't," he said.</p>

<p>"That's frank, anyway. Now tell me, Mr. Beale, what is all
this mystery about? What is the Green Rust? Why do you pretend
to be a&mdash;a drunkard when you're not one?" (It needed some
boldness to say this, and she flushed with the effort to shape
the sentence.) "Why are you always around so providentially when
you're needed, and," here she smiled (as he thought)
deliciously, "why weren't you round yesterday, when I was nearly
arrested for theft?"</p>

<p>He was back on the edge of the table, evidently his favourite
resting-place, she thought, and he ticked her questions off on
his fingers.</p>

<p>"Question number one cannot be answered. Question number two,
why do I pretend to be a&mdash;a drunkard?" he mimicked her
audaciously. "There are other things which intoxicate a man
beside love and beer, Miss Cresswell."</p>

<p>"How gross!" she protested. "What are they?"</p>

<p>"Work, the chase, scientific research and the first spring
scent of the hawthorn," he said solemnly. "As to the third
question, why was I not around when you were nearly arrested?
Well, I was around. I was in your flat when you came in and
escaped along the fire parapet."</p>

<p>"Mr. Beale!" she gasped. "Then it was you&mdash;you are a
detective!"</p>

<p>"I turned your desk and dressing-chest upside down? Yes, it
was I," he said without shame, ignoring the latter part of the
sentence. "I was looking for something."</p>

<p>"You were looking for something?" she repeated. "What were
you looking for?"</p>

<p>"Three registered envelopes which were planted in your flat
yesterday morning," he said, "and what's more I found 'em!"</p>

<p>She put her hand to her forehead in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Then you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Saved you from a cold, cold prison cell. Have you had any
lunch? Why, you're starving!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bread and butter is what you want," said the practical Mr.
Beale, "with a large crisp slice of chicken and stacks of
various vegetables."</p>

<p>And he hustled her from the office.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06">VI. &mdash; MR. SCOBBS OF RED
HORSE VALLEY</a></h2>

<p class="first">MR. WHITE, managing director of Punsonby's
Store, was a man of simple tastes. He had a horror of
extravagance and it was his boast that he had never ridden in a
taxi-cab save as the guest of some other person who paid. He
travelled by tube or omnibus from the Bayswater Road, where he
lived what he described as his private life. He lunched in the
staff dining-room, punctiliously paying his bill; he dined at
home in solitary state, for he had neither chick nor child, heir
or wife. Once an elder sister had lived with him and had died
(according to the popularly accepted idea) of slow starvation,
for he was a frugal man.</p>

<p>It seems the fate of apparently rich and frugal men that they
either die and leave their hoardings to the State or else they
disappear, leaving behind them monumental debts. The latter have
apparently no vices; even the harassed accountant who
disentangles their estates cannot discover the channel through
which their hundreds of thousands have poured. The money has
gone and, if astute detectives bring back the defaulter from the
pleasant life which the Southern American cities offer to rich
idlers, he is hopelessly vague as to the method by which it
went.</p>

<p>Mr. Lassimus White was the managing director and general
manager of Punsonby's. He held, or was supposed to hold, a third
of the shares in that concern, shares which he had inherited
from John Punsonby, his uncle, and the founder of the firm. He
drew a princely salary and a substantial dividend, he was listed
as a debenture holder and was accounted a rich man.</p>

<p>But Mr. White was not rich. His salary and his dividends were
absorbed by a mysterious agency which called itself the Union
Jack Investment and Mortgage Corporation, which paid premiums on
Mr. White's heavy life insurance and collected the whole or
nearly the whole of his income. His secret, well guarded as it
was, need be no secret to the reader. Mr. White, who had never
touched a playing-card in his life and who grew apoplectic at
the sin and shame of playing the races, was an inveterate
gambler. His passion was for Sunken Treasure Syndicates, formed
to recover golden ingots from ships of the Spanish Armada; for
companies that set forth to harness the horse-power of the sea
to the services of commerce; for optimistic companies that
discovered radium mines in the Ural Mountains&mdash;anything
which promised a steady three hundred per cent. per annum on an
initial investment had an irresistible attraction for Mr. White,
who argued that some day something would really fulfil
expectations and his losses would be recovered.</p>

<p>In the meantime he was in the hands of Moss Ibramovitch,
trading as the Union Jack Investment and Mortgage Corporation,
licensed and registered as a moneylender according to law. And
being in the hands of this gentleman was much less satisfactory
and infinitely more expensive than being in the hands of the
bankruptcy officials.</p>

<p>In the evening of the day Oliva Cresswell had started working
for her new employer, Mr. White stalked forth from his gloomy
house and his departure was watched by the two tough females who
kept house for him, with every pleasure. He strutted eastward
swinging his umbrella, his head well back, his eyes half-closed,
his massive waistcoat curving regally. His silk hat was pushed
back from his forehead and the pince-nez he carried, but so
seldom wore, swung from the cord he held before him in that
dead-mouse manner which important men affect.</p>

<p>He had often been mistaken for a Fellow of the Royal Society,
so learned and detached was his bearing. Yet no speculation upon
the origin of species or the function of the nebulae filled his
mind.</p>

<p>At a moment of great stress and distraction, Dr. van Heerden
had arisen above his horizon, and there was something in Dr. van
Heerden's manner which inspired confidence and respect. They had
met by accident at a meeting held to liquidate the Shining
Strand Alluvial Gold Mining Company&mdash;a concern which had
started forth in the happiest circumstances to extract the
fabulous riches which had been discovered by an American
philanthropist (he is now selling Real Estate by correspondence)
on a Southern Pacific island.</p>

<p>Van Heerden was not a shareholder, but he was intensely
interested in the kind of people who subscribe for shares in
Dreamland Gold mines. Mr. White had attended incognito&mdash;his
shares were held in the name of his lawyer, who was thinking
seriously of building an annex to hold the unprofitable
scrip.</p>

<p>Mr. White was gratified to discover a kindred soul who
believed in this kind of speculation.</p>

<p>It was to the doctor's apartment that he was now walking.
That gentleman met him in the entrance and accompanied him to
his room. There was a light in the fanlight of Oliva's flat, for
she had brought some of her work home to finish, but Mr. Beale's
flat was dark.</p>

<p>This the doctor noted before he closed his own door, and
switched on the light.</p>

<p>"Well, White, have you made up your mind?" he demanded
without preliminary.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ah&mdash;have and I&mdash;ah&mdash;have not," said
the cautious adventurer. "Forty thousand is a lot of
money&mdash;a fortune, one might say&mdash;yes, a fortune."</p>

<p>"Have you raised it?"</p>

<p>Mr. White sniffed his objection to this direct
examination.</p>

<p>"My broker has very kindly realized the debentures&mdash;I am
&mdash;ah&mdash;somewhat indebted to him, and it was necessary
to secure his permission and&mdash;yes, I have the money at my
bank."</p>

<p>He gazed benignly at the other, as one who conferred a favour
by the mere bestowal of his confidences.</p>

<p>"First, doctor&mdash;forgive me if I am a little cautious;
first I say, it is necessary that I should know a little more
about your remarkable scheme, for remarkable I am sure it
is."</p>

<p>The doctor poured out a whisky and soda and passed the glass
to his visitor, who smilingly waved it aside.</p>

<p>"Wine is a mocker," he said, "nothing stronger than cider has
ever passed my lips&mdash;pray do not be offended."</p>

<p>"And yet I seem to remember that you held shares in the
Northern Saloon Trust," said the doctor, with a little curl of
his bearded lips.</p>

<p>"That," said Mr. White hastily, "was a purely
commercial&mdash;ah&mdash;affair. In business one must exploit
even the&mdash;ah&mdash;sins and weaknesses of our fellows."</p>

<p>"As to my scheme," said the doctor, changing the subject,
"I'm afraid I must ask you to invest in the dark. I can promise
you that you will get your capital back a hundred times over. I
realize that you have heard that sort of thing before, and that
my suggestion has all the appearance of a confidence trick,
except that I do not offer you even the substantial security of
a gold brick. I may not use your money&mdash;I believe that I
shall not. On the other hand, I may. If it is to be of any use
to me it must be in my hands very soon&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

<p>He wandered restlessly about the room as he spoke, and jerked
his sentences out now to Mr. White's face, now over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I will tell you this," he went on, "my scheme within the
narrow interpretation of the law is illegal&mdash;don't mistake
me, there is no danger to those who invest in ignorance. I will
bear the full burden of responsibility. You can come in or you
can stay out, but if you come in I shall ask you never to
mention the name of the enterprise to a living soul."</p>

<p>"The Green Rust Syndicate?" whispered Mr. White fearfully.
"What&mdash;ah&mdash;is Green Rust?"</p>

<p>"I have offered the scheme to my&mdash;to a Government. But
they are scared of touching it. Scared, by Jove!" He threw up
his arms to the ceiling and his voice trembled with passion.
"Germany scared! And there was a time when Europe cringed at the
clank of the Prussian sword! When the lightest word of Potsdam
set ministries trembling in Petrograd and London. You told me
the other day you were a pacifist during the war and that you
sympathized with Prussia in her humiliation. I am a Prussian,
why should I deny it? I glory in the religion of might&mdash;I
believe it were better that the old civilization were stamped
into the mud of oblivion than that Prussian Kultur should be
swept away by the licentious French, the mercenary
English&mdash;"</p>

<p>"British," murmured Mr. White.</p>

<p>"And the dollar-hunting Yankees&mdash;but I'm making a fool
of myself." With an effort he regained his calm.</p>

<p>"The war's over and done with. As I say, I offered my
Government my secret. They thought it good but could not help
me. They were afraid that the League would come to learn they
were supporting it. They'll help me in other ways&mdash;innocent
ways. If this scheme goes through they will put the full
resources of the State at my disposal."</p>

<p>Mr. White rose, groped for his hat and cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>"Dr.&mdash;ah&mdash;van Heerden, you may be sure that I shall
&mdash;ah&mdash;respect your confidence. With your very natural
indignation I am in complete sympathy.</p>

<p>"But let us forget, ah&mdash;that you have spoken at all
about the scheme in any detail&mdash;especially in so far as to
its legality or otherwise. Let us forget, sir "&mdash;Mr. White
thrust his hand into the bosom of his coat, an attitude he
associated with the subtle rhetoric of statesmanship. "Let us
forget all, save this, that you invite me to subscribe
&pound;40,000 to a syndicate for&mdash;ah&mdash;let us say model
dwellings for the working classes, and that I am willing to
subscribe, and in proof of my willingness will send you by the
night's post a cheque for that amount. Good night, doctor."</p>

<p>He shook hands, pulled his hat down upon his head, opened the
door and ran into the arms of a man whose hand was at that
moment raised to press the electric bell-push by the side of the
door.</p>

<p>Both started back.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," mumbled Mr. White, and hurried down the
stairs.</p>

<p>Dr. van Heerden glared at the visitor, white with rage. "Come
in, you fool!" he hissed, and half-dragged the man into his
room, "what made you leave Scotland?"</p>

<p>"Scotland I hate!" said the visitor huskily. "Sticking a
fellow away in the wilds of the beastly mountains, eh? That's
not playing the game, my cheery sportsman."</p>

<p>"When did you arrive?" asked van Heerden quickly.</p>

<p>"Seven p.m. Travelled third class! Me! Is it not the most
absurd position for a man of my parts&mdash;third class, with
foul and common people&mdash;I'd like to rip them all up&mdash;I
would, by heavens!"</p>

<p>The doctor surveyed the coarse, drink-bloated face, the
loose, weak mouth, half-smiled at the vanity of the dangling
monocle and pointed to the decanter.</p>

<p>"You did wrong to come," he said, "I have arranged your
passage to Canada next week."</p>

<p>"I'll not go!" said the man, tossing down a drink and wiping
his lips with a not over-clean handkerchief. "Curse me, van
Heerden, why should I hide and fly like a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like a man who escaped from Cayenne," suggested the doctor,
"or like a man who is wanted by the police of three countries
for crimes ranging from arson to wilful murder."</p>

<p>The man shuddered.</p>

<p>"All fair fights, my dear fellow," he said more mildly, "if I
hadn't been a boastful, drunken sot, you wouldn't have heard of
'em&mdash;you wouldn't, curse you. I was mad! I had you in my
hand like that!" He closed a not over-clean fist under van
Heerden's nose. "I saw it all, all, I saw you bullying the poor
devil, shaking some secret out of him, I saw you knife
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" hissed van Heerden. "You fool&mdash;people can hear
through these walls."</p>

<p>"But there are no windows to see through," leered the man,
"and I saw! He came out of his death-trance to denounce you, by
Jove! I heard him shout and I saw you run in and lay him
down&mdash;lay him down! Lay him out is better! You killed him
to shut his mouth, my bonnie doctor!"</p>

<p>Van Heerden's face was as white as a sheet, but the hand he
raised to his lips was without a tremor.</p>

<p>"You were lucky to find me that night, dear lad," the man
went on. "I was in a mind to split on you."</p>

<p>"You have no cause to regret my finding you, Jackson," said
the doctor. "I suppose you still call yourself by that
name?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jackson," said the other promptly. "Jack&mdash;son, son
of Jack. Fine name, eh&mdash;good enough for me and good enough
for anybody else. Yes, you found me and done me well. I wish you
hadn't. How I wish you hadn't."</p>

<p>"Ungrateful fool!" said van Heerden. "I probably saved your
life&mdash;hid you in Eastbourne, took you to London, whilst
the police were searching for you."</p>

<p>"For me!" snarled the other. "A low trick, by the Everlasting
Virtues&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Don't be an idiot&mdash;whose word would they have taken,
yours or mine? Now let's talk&mdash;on Thursday next you sail
for Quebec..."</p>

<p>He detailed his instructions at length and the man called
Jackson, mellowed by repeated visits to the decanter, listened
and even approved.</p>

<p>On the other side of the hallway, behind the closed door,
Oliva Cresswell, her dining-table covered with papers and books,
was working hard.</p>

<p>She was particularly anxious to show Mr. Beale a sample of
her work in the morning and was making a fair copy of what she
had described to him that afternoon as her "hotel list."</p>

<p>"They are such queer names," she said; "there is one called
Scobbs of Red Horse Valley&mdash;Scobbs!"</p>

<p>He had laughed.</p>

<p>"Strangely enough, I know Mr. Scobbs, who is quite a
personage in that part of the world. He owns a chain of hotels
in Western Canada. You mustn't leave him out."</p>

<p>Even had she wished to, or even had the name been overlooked
once, she could not have escaped it. For Jonas Scobbs was the
proprietor of Scobbs' Hotel in Falling Star City; of the
Bellevue in Snakefence, of the Palace Hotel in Portage.</p>

<p>After awhile it began to lose its novelty and she accepted
the discovery of unsuspected properties of Mr. Scobbs as
inevitable.</p>

<p>She filled in the last ruled sheet and blotted it, gathered
the sheets together and fastened them with a clip.</p>

<p>She yawned as she rose and realized that her previous night's
sleep had been fitful.</p>

<p>She wondered as she began to undress if she would dream of
Scobbs or&mdash;no, she didn't want to dream of big-headed men
with white faces, and the thought awoke a doubt in her mind. Had
she bolted the door of the flat? She went along the passage in
her stockinged feet, shot the bolts smoothly and was aware of
voices outside. They came to her clearly through the ventilator
above the fanlight.</p>

<p>She heard the doctor say something and then a voice which she
had not heard before.</p>

<p>"Don't worry&mdash;I've a wonderful memory, by Jove!..." The
murmur of the doctor did not reach her, but&mdash;"Yes, yes...
Scobbs' Hotel, Red Horse Valley... know the place well... good
night, dear old thing..."</p>

<p>A door banged, an uncertain footstep died away in the well of
the stairs below, and she was left to recover from her
amazement.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07">VII. &mdash; PLAIN WORDS FROM
MR. BEALE</a></h2>

<p class="first">OLIVA CRESSWELL did not feel at all sleepy, so
she discovered, by the time she was ready for bed. To retire in
that condition of wakefulness meant another sleepless night, and
she slipped a kimono over her, found a book and settled into the
big wicker-chair under the light for the half-hour's reading
which would reduce her to the necessary state of drowsiness. The
book at any other time would have held her attention, but now
she found her thoughts wandering. On the other side of the wall
(she regarded it with a new interest) was the young man who had
so strangely intruded himself into her life. Or was he out? What
would a man like that do with his evenings? He was not the sort
of person who could find any pleasure in making a round of
music-halls or sitting up half the night in a card-room.</p>

<p>She heard a dull knock, and it came from the wall. Mr. Beale
was at home then, he had pushed a chair against the wall, or he
was knocking in nails at this hour of the night.</p>

<p>"Thud&mdash;thud&mdash;thud "&mdash;a pause&mdash;"thud, tap,
thud, tap."</p>

<p>The dull sound was as if made by a fist, the tap by a
finger-tip.</p>

<p>It was repeated.</p>

<p>Suddenly the girl jumped up with a little laugh. He was
signalling to her and had sent "O.C."&mdash;her initials.</p>

<p>Sue tapped three times with her finger, struck once with the
flat of her hand and tapped again. She had sent the "Understood"
message.</p>

<p>Presently he began and she jotted the message on the margin
of her book.</p>

<p>"Most urgent: Don't use soap. Bring it to office."</p>

<p>She smiled faintly. She expected something more brilliant in
the way of humour even from Mr. Beale. She tapped "acknowledged"
and went to bed.</p>

<p>"Matilda, my innocent child," she said to herself, as she
snuggled up under the bed-clothes, "exchanging midnight signals
with a lodger is neither proper nor ladylike."</p>

<p>She had agreed with herself that in spite of the latitude she
was allowed in the matter of office hours, that she would put in
an appearance punctually at ten. This meant rising not later
than eight, for she had her little household to put in order
before she left.</p>

<p>It was the postman's insistent knocking at eight-thirty that
woke her from a dreamless sleep, and, half-awake, she dragged
herself into her dressing-gown and went to the door.</p>

<p>"Parcel, miss," said the invisible official, and put into the
hand that came round the edge of the door a letter and a small
package. She brought them to the sitting-room and pulled back
the curtains. The letter was typewritten and was on the
note-paper of a well-known firm of perfumers. It was addressed to
"Miss Oliva Cresswell," and ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="typewriter">DEAR MADAME,&mdash;</p>

<p class="typewriter">We have pleasure in sending you for your
use a sample cake of our new Complexion Soap, which we trust
will meet with your approval.</p>

<br>

<p>"But how nice," she said, and wondered why she had been
singled out for the favour. She opened the package. In a small
carton, carefully wrapped in the thinnest of paper, was an oval
tablet of lavender-coloured soap that exhaled a delicate
fragrance.</p>

<p>"But how nice," she said again, and put the gift in the
bath-room.</p>

<p>This was starting the day well&mdash;a small enough
foundation for happiness, yet one which every woman knows, for
happiness is made up of small and acceptable things and, given
the psychological moment, a bunch of primroses has a greater
value than a rope of pearls.</p>

<p>In her bath she picked up the soap and dropped it back in the
tidy again quickly.</p>

<p>"Don't use soap; bring it to office."</p>

<p>She remembered the message in a flash. Beale had known that
this parcel was coming then, and his "most urgent" warning was
not a joke. She dressed quickly, made a poor breakfast and was
at the office ten minutes before the hour.</p>

<p>She found her employer waiting, sitting in his accustomed
place on the edge of the table in her office. He gave her a
little nod of welcome, and without a word stretched out his
hand.</p>

<p>"The soap?" she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>She opened her bag.</p>

<p>"Good," he said. "I see you have kept the wrappings, and
that, I presume, is the letter which accompanied the&mdash;what
shall I say&mdash;gift? Don't touch it with your bare hand," he
said quickly. "Handle it with the paper."</p>

<p>He pulled his gloves from his pocket and slipped them on,
then took the cake of soap in his hand and carried it to the
light, smelt it and returned it to its paper.</p>

<p>"Now let me see the letter." She handed it to him, and he
read it.</p>

<p>"From Brandan, the perfumers. They wouldn't be in it, but we
had better make sure."</p>

<p>He walked to the telephone and gave a number, and the girl
heard him speaking in a low tone to somebody at the other end.
Presently he put down the receiver and walked back, his hands
thrust into his pockets.</p>

<p>"They know nothing about this act of generosity," he
said.</p>

<p>By this time she had removed her coat and hat and hung them
up, and had taken her place at her desk. She sat with her elbows
on the blotting-pad, her chin on her clasped hands, looking up
at him.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's fair that things should be kept from me
any longer," she said. "Many mysterious things have happened in
the past few days, and since they have all directly affected me,
I think I am entitled to some sort of explanation."</p>

<p>"I think you are," said Mr. Beale, with a twinkle in his grey
eyes, "but I am not prepared to explain everything just yet.
Thus much I will tell you, that had you used this soap this
morning, by the evening you would have been covered from head to
foot in a rather alarming and irritating rash."</p>

<p>She gasped.</p>

<p>"But who dared to send me this?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Who knows? But first let me ask you this, Miss Cresswell.
Suppose to-night when you had looked at yourself in the glass
you had discovered your face was covered with red blotches and,
on further examination, you found your arms and, indeed, the
whole of your body similarly disfigured, what would you have
done?"</p>

<p>She thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, I should have sent for the doctor."</p>

<p>"Which doctor?" he asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"Doctor van Heerden&mdash;oh!" She looked at him resentfully.
"You don't suggest that Doctor van Heerden sent that hideous
thing to me?"</p>

<p>"I don't suggest anything," said Mr. Beale coolly. "I merely
say that you would have sent for a doctor, and that that doctor
would have been Doctor van Heerden. I say further, that he would
have come to you and been very sympathetic, and would have
ordered you to remain in bed for four or five days. I think,
too," he said, looking up at the ceiling and speaking slowly, as
though he were working out the possible consequence in his mind,
"that he would have given you some very palatable medicine."</p>

<p>"What are you insinuating?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>He did not reply immediately.</p>

<p>"If you will get out of your mind the idea that I have any
particular grievance against Doctor van Heerden, that I regard
him as a rival, a business rival let us say, or that I have some
secret grudge against him, and if in place of that suspicion you
would believe that I am serving a much larger interest than is
apparent to you, I think we might discuss"&mdash;he
smiled&mdash;"even Doctor van Heerden without such a discussion
giving offence to you."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"I am really not offended. I am rather distressed, if
anything," she said, knitting her brows. "You see, Doctor van
Heerden has always been most kind to me."</p>

<p>Beale nodded.</p>

<p>"He got you your rooms at the flats," he replied quietly; "he
was also ready to give you employment the moment you were
providentially discharged from Punsonby's. Does it not strike
you, Miss Cresswell, that every kind act of Doctor van Heerden's
has had a tendency to bring you together, into closer
association, I mean? Does it not appear to you that the net
result of all the things that might have happened to you in the
past few days would have been to make you more and more
dependent upon Doctor van Heerden? For example, if you had gone
into his employ as he planned that you should?"</p>

<p>"Planned!" she gasped.</p>

<p>His face was grave now and the laughter had gone out of his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Planned," he said quietly. "You were discharged from
Punsonby's at Doctor van Heerden's instigation."</p>

<p>"I will not believe it."</p>

<p>"That will not make it any less the fact," said Mr. Beale.
"You were nearly arrested&mdash;again at Doctor van Heerden's
instigation. He was waiting for you when you came back from
Punsonby's, ready to offer you his job. When he discovered you
had already engaged yourself he telephoned to White, instructing
him to have you arrested so that you might be disgraced and
might turn to him, your one loyal friend."</p>

<p>She listened speechless. She could only stare at him and
could not even interrupt him. For her shrewd woman instinct told
her so convincingly that even her sense of loyalty could not
eject the doubt which assailed her mind, that if there was not
truth in what he was saying there was at least probability.</p>

<p>"I suggest even more," Beale went on. "I suggest that for
some purpose, Doctor van Heerden desires to secure a mental,
physical and moral ascendancy over you. In other words, he
wishes to enslave you to his will."</p>

<p>She looked at him in wonder and burst into a peal of ringing
laughter.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Beale, you are too absurd," she said.</p>

<p>"Aren't I?" he smiled. "It sounds like something out of a
melodrama."</p>

<p>"Why on earth should he want to secure a mental ascendancy
over me? Do you suggest&mdash;" She flushed.</p>

<p>"I suggest nothing any longer," said Beale, slipping off from
the end of the table. "I merely make a statement of fact. I do
not think he has any designs on you, within the conventional
meaning of that phrase, indeed, I think he wants to marry
you&mdash;what do you think about that?"</p>

<p>She had recovered something of her poise, and her sense of
humour was helping her out of a situation which, without such a
gift, might have been an embarrassing one.</p>

<p>"I think you have been seeing too many plays and reading too
many exciting books, Mr. Beale," she said. "I confess I have
never regarded Doctor van Heerden as a possible suitor, and if I
thought he was I should be immensely flattered. But may I
suggest to you that there are other ways of winning a girl than
by giving her nettle-rash!"</p>

<p>They laughed together.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, swinging up his hat, "proceed with the
good work and seek out the various domiciles of Mr. Scobbs."</p>

<p>Then she remembered. "Do you know&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He was at the door when she spoke and he stopped and
turned.</p>

<p>"The name of Mr. Scobbs gives me a cold shiver."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Answer me this," she said: "why should I who have never
heard of him before until yesterday hear his name mentioned by a
perfect stranger?"</p>

<p>The smile died away from his face. "Who mentioned him? No, it
isn't idle curiosity," he said in face of her derisive finger.
"I am really serious. Who mentioned his name?"</p>

<p>"A visitor of Doctor van Heerden's. I heard them talking
through the ventilator when I was bolting my door."</p>

<p>"A visitor to Doctor van Heerden, and he mentioned Mr. Scobbs
of Red Horse Valley." he said half to himself. "You didn't see
the man?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You just heard him. No names were mentioned?"</p>

<p>"None," she said. "Is it a frightfully important matter?"</p>

<p>"It is rather," he replied. "We have got to get busy," and
with this cryptic remark he left her.</p>

<p>The day passed as quickly as its predecessor. The tabulation
at which she was working grew until by the evening there was a
pile of sheets in the left-hand cupboard covered with her fine
writing. She might have done more but for the search she had to
make for a missing report to verify one of her facts. It was not
on the shelf, and she was about to abandon her search and
postpone the confirmation till she saw Beale, when she noticed a
cupboard beneath the shelves. It was unlocked and she opened it
and found, as she had expected, that it was full of books,
amongst which was the missing documentation she sought.</p>

<p>With a view to future contingencies, she examined the
contents of the cupboard and was arrested by a thin volume which
bore no inscription or title on its blank cover. She opened it,
and on the title page read: "The Millinborn Murder." The
author's name was not given and the contents were made up of
very careful analysis of evidence given by the various witnesses
at the inquest, and plans and diagrams with little red crosses
to show where every actor in that tragedy had been.</p>

<p>She read the first page idly and turned it. She was half-way
down the second page when she uttered a little exclamation, for
a familiar name was there, the name of Dr. van Heerden.</p>

<p>Fascinated, she read the story to the end, half-expecting
that the name of Mr. Beale would occur.</p>

<p>There were many names all unknown to her and one that
occurred with the greatest frequency was that of James Kitson.
Mr. Beale did not appear to have played any part. She read for
an hour, sitting on the floor by the cupboard. She reached the
last page, closed the book and slipped it back in the cupboard.
She wondered why Beale had preserved this record and whether his
antagonism to the doctor was founded on that case. At first she
thought she identified him with the mysterious man who had
appeared in the plantation before the murder, but a glance back
at the description of the stranger dispelled that idea. For all
the reputation he had, Mr. Beale did not have "an inflamed,
swollen countenance, colourless bloodshot eyes," nor was he
bald.</p>

<p>She was annoyed with herself that she had allowed her work to
be interrupted, and in penance decided to remain on until six
instead of five o'clock as she had intended. Besides, she half
expected that Mr. Beale would return, and was surprised to
discover that she was disappointed that he had not.</p>

<p>At six o'clock she dismissed the boy, closed and locked the
office, and made her way downstairs into the crowded street.</p>

<p>To her surprise she heard her name spoken, and turned to face
Dr. van Heerden.</p>

<p>"I have been waiting for you for nearly an hour," he said
with good-humoured reproach.</p>

<p>"And your patients are probably dying like flies," she
countered.</p>

<p>It was in her mind to make some excuse and go home alone, but
curiosity got the better of her and impelled her to wait to
discover the object of this unexpected visitation.</p>

<p>"How did you know where I was working?" she asked, as the
thought occurred to her.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"It was a very simple matter. I was on my way to a patient
and I saw you coming out to lunch," he said, "and as I found
myself in the neighbourhood an hour ago I thought I would wait
and take you home. You are doing a very foolish thing," he
added.</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;in stopping to talk to you when I
ought to be on my way home to tea?"</p>

<p>"No, in engaging yourself to a man like Beale. You know the
reputation he has! My dear girl, I was shocked when I discovered
who your employer was."</p>

<p>"I don't think you need distress yourself on my account,
doctor," she said quietly. "Really, Mr. Beale is quite
pleasant&mdash;in his lucid moments," she smiled to herself.</p>

<p>She was not being disloyal to her employer. If he chose to
encourage suspicion in his mode of life he must abide by the
consequences.</p>

<p>"But a drunkard, faugh!" The exquisite doctor shivered. "I
have always tried to be a friend of yours, Miss Cresswell, and I
hope you are going to let me continue to be, and my advice to
you in that capacity is&mdash;give Mr. Beale notice."</p>

<p>"How absurd you are!" she laughed. "There is no reason in the
world why I should do anything of the sort. Mr. Beale has
treated me with the greatest consideration."</p>

<p>"What is he, by the way?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"He's an agent of some sort," said the girl, "but I am sure
you don't want me to discuss his business. And now I must go,
doctor, if you will excuse me."</p>

<p>"One moment," he begged, "I have a cab here. Won't you come
and have tea somewhere?"</p>

<p>"Where is somewhere?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The Grand Alliance?" he suggested. She nodded slowly.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="chap08" id="chap08">VIII. &mdash; THE CRIME OF THE
GRAND ALLIANCE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE hotel and the caf of the Grand Alliance
was London's newest rendezvous. Its great palm-court was crowded
at the tea-hour and if, as the mysterious Mr. Beale had hinted,
any danger was to be apprehended from Dr. van Heerden, it could
not come to her in that most open of public places.</p>

<p>She had no fear, but that eighth sense of armed caution,
which is the possession of every girl who has to work for her
living and is conscious of the perils which await her on every
side, reviewed with lightning speed all the possibilities and
gave her the passport of approval.</p>

<p>It was later than she had thought. Only a few tables were
occupied, but he had evidently reserved one, for immediately on
his appearance the waiter with a smirk led him to one of the
alcoves and pulled back a chair for the girl. She looked round
as she stripped her gloves. The place was not unfamiliar to her.
It was here she came at rare intervals, when her finances
admitted of such an hilarious recreation, to find comfort for
jangled nerves, to sit and sip her tea to the sound of violins
and watch the happy crowd at her leisure, absorbing something of
the happiness they diffused.</p>

<p>The palm-court was a spacious marble hall, a big circle of
polished pillars supporting the dome, through the tinted glass
of which the light was filtered in soft hues upon the marble
floor below. "Doctor," she said, suddenly remembering, "I have
been reading quite a lot about you to-day."</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows. "About me?"</p>

<p>She nodded, smiling mischievously. "I didn't know that you
were such a famous person&mdash;I have been reading about the
Millinborn murder."</p>

<p>"You have been reading about the Millinborn murder?" he said
steadily, looking into her eyes. "An unpleasant case and one I
should like to forget."</p>

<p>"I thought it was awfully thrilling," she said. "It read like
a detective story without a satisfactory end."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"What a perfectly gruesome subject for tea-table talk," he
said lightly, and beckoned the head-waiter. "You are keeping us
waiting, Jacques."</p>

<p>"Doctor, it will be but a few minutes," pleaded the waiter,
and then in a low voice, which was not so low that it did not
reach the girl. "We have had some trouble this afternoon,
doctor, with your friend."</p>

<p>"My friend?"</p>

<p>The doctor looked up sharply.</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>"With Mr. Jackson."</p>

<p>"Jackson," said the doctor, startled. "I thought he had
left."</p>

<p>"He was to leave this morning by the ten o'clock train, but
he had a fainting-fit. We recovered him with brandy and he was
not too well, for this afternoon he faint again."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?" asked van Heerden, after a pause.</p>

<p>"In his room, monsieur. To-night he leave for
Ireland&mdash;this he tell me&mdash;to catch the mail steamer at
Queenstown."</p>

<p>"Don't let him know I am here," said the doctor.</p>

<p>He turned to the girl with a shrug.</p>

<p>"A dissolute friend of mine whom I am sending out to the
colonies," he said.</p>

<p>"Won't you go and see him?" she asked. "He must be very ill
if he faints."</p>

<p>"I think not," said Dr. van Heerden quietly, "these little
attacks are not serious&mdash;he had one in my room the other
night. It is a result of over-indulgence, and six months in
Canada will make a man of him."</p>

<p>She did not reply. With difficulty she restrained an
exclamation. So that was the man who had been in the doctor's
room and who was going to Red Horse Valley! She would have
dearly loved to supplement her information about Mr. Scobbs,
proprietor of many hotels, and to have mystified him with her
knowledge of Western Canada, but she refrained.</p>

<p>Instead, she took up the conversation where he had tried to
break it off.</p>

<p>"Do you know Mr. Kitson?"</p>

<p>"Kitson? Oh yes, you mean the lawyer man," he replied
reluctantly. "I know him, but I am afraid I don't know much that
is good about him. Now, I'm going to tell you, Miss
Cresswell"&mdash;he leant across the table and spoke in a lower
tone&mdash;"something that I have never told to a human being.
You raised the question of the Millinborn murder. My view is
that Kitson, the lawyer, knew much more about that murder than
any man in this world. If there is anybody who knows more it is
Beale."</p>

<p>"Mr. Beale?" she said incredulously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Beale," he repeated. "You know the story of the murder:
you say you have read it. Millinborn was dying and I had left
the room with Kitson when somebody entered the window and
stabbed John Millinborn to the heart. I have every reason to
believe that that murder was witnessed by this very man I am
sending to Canada. He persists in denying that he saw anything,
but later be may change his tune."</p>

<p>A light dawned upon her.</p>

<p>"Then Jackson is the man who was seen by Mr. Kitson in the
plantation?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," she said, perplexed. "Aren't the
police searching for Jackson?"</p>

<p>"I do not think that it is in the interests of justice that
they should find him," he said gravely. "I place the utmost
reliance on him. I am sending Mr. Jackson to a farm in Ontario
kept by a medical friend of mine who has made a hobby of dealing
with dipsomaniacs."</p>

<p>He met her eyes unfalteringly.</p>

<p>"Dr. van Heerden," she said slowly, "you are sending Mr.
Jackson to Red Horse Valley."</p>

<p>He started back as if he had been struck in the face, and for
a moment was inarticulate.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what do you know?" he asked incoherently.</p>

<p>His face had grown white, his eyes tragic with fear. She was
alarmed at the effect of her words and hastened to remove the
impression she had created.</p>

<p>"I only know that I heard Mr. Jackson through the ventilator
of my flat, saying good-bye to you the other night. He mentioned
Red Horse Valley&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath and was master of himself again, but
his face was still pale.</p>

<p>"Oh, that," he said, "that is a polite fiction. Jackson knows
of this inebriates' home in Ontario and I had to provide him
with a destination. He will go no farther than&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, curse my life, if it isn't the doctor!"</p>

<p>At the sound of the raucous voice both looked up. The man
called Jackson had hailed them from the centre of the hall. He
was well dressed, but no tailor could compensate for the
repulsiveness of that puckered and swollen face, those malignant
eyes which peered out into the world through two slits. He was
wearing his loud-check suit, his new hat was in his hand and the
conical-shaped dome of his head glistened baldly.</p>

<p>"I'm cursed if this isn't amiable of you, doctor!"</p>

<p>He did not look at the girl, but grinned complacently upon
her angry companion.</p>

<p>"Here I am,"&mdash;he threw out his arms with an extravagant
gesture&mdash;"leaving the country of my adoption, if not birth,
without one solitary soul to see me off or take farewell of me.
I, who have been&mdash;well, you know, what I've been, van
Heerden. The world has treated me very badly. By heaven! I'd
like to come back a billionaire and ruin all of 'em. I'd like to
cut their throats and amputate 'em limb from limb, I would
like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be silent!" said van Heerden angrily. "Have you no decency?
Do you not realize I am with a lady?"</p>

<p>"Pardon." The man called Jackson leapt up from the chair into
which he had fallen and bowed extravagantly in the direction of
the girl. "I cannot see your face because of your hat, my dear
lady," he said gallantly, "but I am sure my friend van Heerden,
whose taste&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you be quiet?" said van Heerden. "Go to your room and I
will come up to you."</p>

<p>"Go to my room!" scoffed the other. "By Jove! I like that!
That any whipper-snapper of a sawbones should tell me to go to
my room. After what I have been, after the position I have held
in society. I have had ambassadors' carriages at my door, my
dear fellow, princes of the royal blood, and to be told to go to
my room like a naughty little boy! It's too much!"</p>

<p>"Then behave yourself," said van Heerden, "and at least wait
until I am free before you approach me again."</p>

<p>But the man showed no inclination to move; rather did this
rebuff stimulate his power of reminiscence.</p>

<p>"Ignore me, miss&mdash;I have not your name, but I am sure it
is a noble one," he said. "You see before you one who in his
time has been a squire of dames, by Jove! I can't remember 'em.
They must number thousands and only one of them was worth two
sous. Yes," he shook his head in melancholy, "only one of 'em.
By Jove! The rest were"&mdash;he snapped his fingers&mdash;"
that for 'em!"</p>

<p>The girl listened against her will.</p>

<p>"Jackson!"&mdash;and van Heerden's voice trembled with
passion&mdash;"will you go or must I force you to go?"</p>

<p>Jackson rose with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"Evidently I am de trop," he said with heavy sarcasm.</p>

<p>He held out a swollen hand which van Heerden ignored.</p>

<p>"Farewell, mademoiselle." He thrust the hand forward, so that
she could not miss it.</p>

<p>She took it, a cold flabby thing which sent a shudder of
loathing through her frame, and raised her face to his for the
first time.</p>

<p>He let the hand drop. He was staring at her with open mouth
and features distorted with horror.</p>

<p>"You!" he croaked.</p>

<p>She shrunk back against the wall of the alcove, but he made
no movement. She sensed the terror and agony in his voice.</p>

<p>"You!" he gasped. "Mary!"</p>

<p>"Hang you! Go!" roared van Heerden, and thrust him back.</p>

<p>But though he staggered back a pace under the weight of the
other's arm, his eyes did not leave the girl's face, and she,
fascinated by the appeal in the face of the wreck, could not
turn hers away.</p>

<p>"Mary!" he whispered, "what is your other name?"</p>

<p>With an effort the girl recovered herself.</p>

<p>"My name is not Mary," she said quietly. "My name is Oliva
Cresswell."</p>

<p>"Oliva Cresswell," he repeated. "Oliva Cresswell!"</p>

<p>He made a movement toward her but van Heerden barred his way.
She heard Jackson say something in a strangled voice and heard
van Heerden's sharp "What!" and there was a fierce exchange of
words.</p>

<p>The attention of the few people in the palm-court had been
attracted to the unusual spectacle of two men engaged in what
appeared to be a struggle.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down, you fool! Sit over there. I will come to
you in a minute. Can you swear what you say is true?"</p>

<p>Jackson nodded. He was shaking from head to foot.</p>

<p>"My name is Predeaux," he said; "that is my daughter&mdash;I
married in the name of Cresswell. My daughter," he repeated.
"How wonderful!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked van Heerden.</p>

<p>He had half-led, half-pushed the other to a chair near one of
the pillars of the rotunda.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell her," said the wreck. "What are you doing
with her?" he demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>"That is no business of yours," replied van Heerden
sharply.</p>

<p>"No business of mine, eh! I'll show you it's some business of
mine. I am going to tell her all I know about you. I have been a
rotter and worse than a rotter." The old flippancy had gone and
the harsh voice was vibrant with purpose. "My path has been
littered with the wrecks of human lives," he said bitterly, "and
they are mostly women. I broke the heart of the best woman in
the world, and I am going to see that you don't break the heart
of her daughter."</p>

<p>"Will you be quiet?" hissed van Heerden. "I will go and get
her away and then I will come back to you."</p>

<p>Jackson did not reply. He sat huddled up in his chair,
muttering to himself, and van Heerden walked quickly back to the
girl.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I shall have to let you go back by yourself. He
is having one of his fits. I think it is delirium tremens."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you had better send for&mdash;" she began.
She was going to say "send for a doctor," and the absurdity of
the request struck her.</p>

<p>"I think you had better go," he said hastily, with a glance
at the man who was struggling to his feet. "I can't tell you how
sorry I am that we've had this scene."</p>

<p>"Stop!"&mdash;it was Jackson's voice.</p>

<p>He stood swaying half-way between the chair he had left and
the alcove, and his trembling finger was pointing at them.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he said in a commanding voice. "Stop! I've got
something to say to you. I know... he's making you pay for the
Green Rust..."</p>

<p>So far he got when he reeled and collapsed in a heap on the
floor. The doctor sprang forward, lifted him and carried him to
the chair by the pillar. He picked up the overcoat that the man
had been wearing and spread it over him.</p>

<p>"It's a fainting-fit, nothing to be alarmed about," he said
to the little knot of people from the tables who had gathered
about the limp figure. "Jacques"&mdash;he called the
head-waiter&mdash;"get some brandy, he must be kept warm."</p>

<p>"Shall I ring for an ambulance, m'sieur?"</p>

<p>"It is not necessary," said van Heerden. "He will recover in
a few moments. Just leave him," and he walked back to the
alcove.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked the girl, and her voice was shaking in
spite of herself.</p>

<p>"He is a man I knew in his better days," said van Heerden,
"and now I think you must go."</p>

<p>"I would rather wait to see if he recovers," she said with
some obstinacy.</p>

<p>"I want you to go," he said earnestly; "you would please me
very much if you would do as I ask."</p>

<p>"There's the waiter!" she interrupted, "he has the brandy.
Won't you give it to him?"</p>

<p>It was the doctor who in the presence of the assembled
visitors dissolved a white pellet in the brandy before he forced
the clenched teeth apart and poured the liquor to the last drop
down the man's throat.</p>

<p>Jackson or Predeaux, to give him his real name, shuddered as
he drank, shuddered again a few seconds later and then went
suddenly limp.</p>

<p>The doctor bent down and lifted his eyelid.</p>

<p>"I am afraid&mdash;he is dead," he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Dead!" the girl stared at him. "Oh no! Not dead!"</p>

<p>Van Heerden nodded.</p>

<p>"Heart failure," he said.</p>

<p>"The same kind of heart failure that killed John Millinborn,"
said a voice behind him. "The cost of the Green Rust is
totalling up, doctor."</p>

<p>The girl swung round. Mr. Beale was standing at her elbow,
but his steady eyes were fixed upon van Heerden.</p>

<p class="first">"WHAT do you mean?" asked Dr. van Heerden.</p>

<p>"I merely repeat the words of the dead man," answered Beale,
"heart failure!"</p>

<p>He picked up from the table the leather case which the doctor
had taken from his pocket. There were four little phials and one
of these was uncorked.</p>

<p>"Digitalis!" he read. "That shouldn't kill him, doctor."</p>

<p>He looked at van Heerden thoughtfully, then picked up the
phial again. It bore the label of a well-known firm of wholesale
chemists, and the seal had apparently been broken for the first
time when van Heerden opened the tiny bottle.</p>

<p>"You have sent for the police?" Beale asked the agitated
manager.</p>

<p>"Oui, m'sieur&mdash;directly. They come now, I think."</p>

<p>He walked to the vestibule to meet three men in plain clothes
who had just come through the swing-doors. There was something
about van Heerden's attitude which struck Beale as strange. He
was standing in the exact spot he had stood when the detective
had addressed him. It seemed as if something rooted him to the
spot. He did not move even when the ambulance men were lifting
the body nor when the police were taking particulars of the
circumstances of the death. And Beale, escorting the shaken girl
up the broad staircase to a room where she could rest and
recover, looked back over his shoulder and saw him still
standing, his head bent, his fingers smoothing his beard.</p>

<p>"It was dreadful, dreadful," said the girl with a shiver. "I
have never seen anybody&mdash;die. It was awful."</p>

<p>Beale nodded. His thoughts were set on the doctor. Why had he
stood so motionless? He was not the kind of man to be shocked by
so normal a phenomenon as death. He was a doctor and such sights
were common to him. What was the reason for this strange
paralysis which kept him chained to the spot even after the body
had been removed?</p>

<p>The girl was talking, but he did not hear her. He knew
instinctively that in van Heerden's curious attitude was a
solution of Predeaux's death.</p>

<p>"Excuse me a moment," he said.</p>

<p>He passed with rapid strides from the room, down the broad
stairway and into the palm-court.</p>

<p>Van Heerden had gone.</p>

<p>The explanation flashed upon him and he hurried to the spot
where the doctor had stood.</p>

<p>On the tessellated floor was a little patch no bigger than a
saucer which had been recently washed.</p>

<p>He beckoned the manager.</p>

<p>"Who has been cleaning this tile?" he asked.</p>

<p>The manager shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It was the doctor, sare&mdash;so eccentric! He call for a
glass of water and he dip his handkerchief in and then lift up
his foot and with rapidity incredible he wash the floor with his
handkerchief!"</p>

<p>"Fool!" snapped Beale. "Oh, hopeless fool!"</p>

<p>"Sare!" said the startled manager.</p>

<p>"It's all right, M'sieur Barri," smiled Beale ruefully. "I
was addressing myself&mdash;oh, what a fool I've been!"</p>

<p>He went down on his knees and examined the floor.</p>

<p>"I want this tile, don't let anybody touch it," he said.</p>

<p>Of course, van Heerden had stood because under his foot he
had crushed the digitalis tablet he had taken from the phial,
and for which he had substituted something more deadly. Had he
moved, the powdered tablet would have been seen. It was
simple&mdash;horribly simple.</p>

<p>He walked slowly back to where he had left Oliva.</p>

<p>What followed seemed ever after like a bad dream to the girl.
She was stunned by the tragedy which had happened under her eyes
and could offer no evidence which in any way assisted the police
in their subsequent investigation, the sum of which was ably set
forth in the columns of the <i>Post Record</i>.</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">"The tragedy which occurred in the Palm-Court
of the Grand Alliance Hotel yesterday must be added to the
already long list of London's unravelled mysteries. The
deceased, a man named Jackson, has been staying at the hotel for
a week and was on the point of departure for Canada. At the last
moment Dr. van Heerden, who was assisting the unfortunate man,
discovered that Jackson was no other than the wanted man in the
Millinborn murder, a crime which most of our readers will
recall.</p>

<p class="quote">"Dr. van Heerden stated to our representative
that the man had represented that he was a friend of the late
John Millinborn, but was anxious to get to Canada. He had
produced excellent credentials, and Dr. van Heerden, in a spirit
of generosity, offered to assist him. At the eleventh hour,
however, he was struck with the likeness the man bore to the
published description of the missing man in the Millinborn case,
and was on the point of telegraphing to the authorities at
Liverpool, when he discovered that Jackson had missed the
train.</p>

<p class="quote">"The present tragedy points to suicide. The
man, it will be remembered, collapsed, and Dr. van Heerden
rendered first aid, administering to the man a perfectly
harmless drug. The post-mortem examination reveals the presence
in the body of a considerable quantity of cyanide of potassium,
and the police theory is that this was self-administered before
the collapse. In the man's pocket was discovered a number of
cyanide tablets.</p>

<p class="quote">"'I am satisfied,' said Dr. van Heerden, 'that
the man already contemplated the deed, and when I voiced my
suspicions in the palm-court he decided upon the action. The
presence in his pocket of cyanide&mdash;one of the deadliest and
quickest of poisons&mdash;suggests that he had the project in
his mind. I did not see his action or, of course, I should have
stopped him!'"</p>

<br>

<p>Oliva Cresswell read this account in her room two nights
following the tragedy and was struck by certain curious
inaccuracies, if all that the doctor had told her was true.</p>

<p>Mr. Beale read the account, smiled across the table grimly to
the bearded superintendent of the Criminal Investigation
Department.</p>

<p>"How does that strike you for ingenuity?" he said, pushing
the paper over the table.</p>

<p>"I have read it," said the other laconically, "I think we
have sufficient evidence to arrest van Heerden. The tile from
the Grand Alliance shows traces of digitalis."</p>

<p>Beale shook his head. "The case would fall," he said. "What
evidence have you? We did not confiscate his medicine-case. He
might have dropped a tablet of digitalis by accident. The only
evidence you could convict van Heerden on is proof that he
brought with him cyanide tablets which he slipped into
Predeaux's pocket. No, we can prove nothing."</p>

<p>"What is your theory in connection with the crime?"</p>

<p>"I have many theories," said Mr. Beale, rising and pacing the
room, "and one certainty. I am satisfied that Millinborn was
killed by Doctor van Heerden. He was killed because, during the
absence of Mr. Kitson in the village, the doctor forced from the
dying man a secret which up till then he had jealously
preserved. When Kitson returned he found his friend, as he
thought, in extremis, and van Heerden also thought that John
Millinborn would not speak again. To his surprise Millinborn did
speak and van Heerden, fearful of having his villainy exposed,
stabbed him to the heart under the pretext of assisting him to
lie down.</p>

<p>"Something different occurred at the Grand Alliance Hotel. A
man swoons, immediately he is picked up by the doctor, who gives
him a harmless drug&mdash;that is to say, harmless in small
quantities. In five seconds the man is dead. At the inquest we
find he has been poisoned&mdash;cyanide is found in his pocket.
And who is this man? Obviously the identical person who
witnessed the murder of John Millinborn and whom we have been
trying to find ever since that crime."</p>

<p>"Van Heerden won't escape the third time. His presence will
be a little more than a coincidence," said the
superintendent.</p>

<p>Beale laughed.</p>

<p>"There will be no third time," he said shortly, "van Heerden
is not a fool."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what the secret was that he wanted to get
from old Millinborn?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>Beale nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know pretty well," he said, "and in course of time
you will know, too."</p>

<p>The detective was glancing over the newspaper account.</p>

<p>"I see the jury returned a verdict of 'Suicide whilst of
unsound mind!'" he said. "This case ought to injure van Heerden,
anyway."</p>

<p>"That is where you are wrong," said Beale, stopping in his
stride, "van Heerden has so manoeuvred the Pressmen that he
comes out with an enhanced reputation. You will probably find
articles in the weekly papers written and signed by him, giving
his views on the indiscriminate sale of poisons. He will move in
a glamour of romance, and his consulting-rooms will be thronged
by new admirers."</p>

<p>"It's a rum case," said the superintendent, rising, "and if
you don't mind my saying so, Mr. Beale, you're one of the
rummiest men that figure in it. I can't quite make you out. You
are not a policeman and yet we have orders from the Foreign
Office to give you every assistance. What's the game?"</p>

<p>"The biggest game in the world," said Beale promptly, "a
game which, if it succeeds, will bring misery and suffering to
thousands, and will bring great businesses tumbling, and set you
and your children and your children's children working for
hundreds of years to pay off a new national debt."</p>

<p>"Man alive!" said the other, "are you serious?"</p>

<p>Beale nodded.</p>

<p>"I was never more serious in my life," he said, "that is why
I don't want the police to be too inquisitive in regard to this
murder of Jackson, whose real name, as I say, is Predeaux. I can
tell you this, chief, that you are seeing the development of the
most damnable plot that has ever been hatched in the brain of
the worst miscreant that history knows. Sit down again. Do you
know what happened last year?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Last year?" said the superintendent. "Why, the war ended
last year."</p>

<p>"The war ended, Germany was beaten, and had to accept terms
humiliating for a proud nation, but fortunately for her Prussia
was not proud, she was merely arrogant. Her worst blow was the
impoverishing conditions which the Entente Powers imposed. That
is to say, they demanded certain concessions of territory and
money which, added to the enormous interest of war stock which
the Germans had to pay, promised to cripple Prussia for a
hundred years."</p>

<p>"Well?" said the detective, when the other had stopped.</p>

<p>"Well?" repeated Beale, with a hard little smile. "Germany is
going to get that money back."</p>

<p>"War?"</p>

<p>Beale laughed.</p>

<p>"No, nothing so foolish as war. Germany has had all the war
she wants. Oh no, there'll be no war. Do you imagine that we
should go to war because I came to the Foreign Office with a
crazy story? I can tell you this, that officially the German
Government have no knowledge of this plot and are quite willing
to repudiate those people who are engaged in it. Indeed, if the
truth be told, the Government has not contributed a single mark
to bring the scheme to fruition, but when it is working all the
money required will be instantly found. At present the inventor
of this delightful little scheme finds himself with insufficient
capital to go ahead. It is his intention to secure that capital.
There are many ways by which this can be done. He has already
borrowed &pound;40,000 from White, of Punsonby's."</p>

<p>Superintendent McNorton whistled.</p>

<p>"There are other ways," Beale went on, "and he is at liberty
to try them all except one. The day he secures control of that
fortune, that day I shoot him."</p>

<p>"The deuce you will?" said the startled Mr. McNorton.</p>

<p>"The deuce I will," repeated Beale.</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door and McNorton rose.</p>

<p>"Don't go," said Beale, "I would like to introduce you to
this gentleman."</p>

<p>He opened the door and a grey-haired man with a lean, ascetic
face came in. Beale closed the door behind him and led the way
to the dining-room. "Mr. Kitson, I should like you to know
Superintendent McNorton."</p>

<p>The two men shook hands.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Kitson, "our medical friend seems to have got
away with it." He sat at the table, nervously drumming with his
fingers. "Does the superintendent know everything?"</p>

<p>"Nearly everything," replied Beale.</p>

<p>"Nearly everything," repeated the superintendent with a
smile, "except this great Green Rust business. There I admit I
am puzzled."</p>

<p>"Even I know nothing about that," said Kitson, looking
curiously at Beale. "I suppose one of these days you will tell
us all about it. It is a discovery Mr. Beale happed upon whilst
he was engaged in protecting Miss&mdash;" He looked at Beale and
Beale nodded&mdash;"Miss Cresswell," said Kitson.</p>

<p>"The lady who was present at the murder of Jackson?"</p>

<p>"There is no reason why we should not take you into our
confidence, the more so since the necessity for secrecy is
rapidly passing. Miss Oliva Cresswell is the niece of John
Millinborn. Her mother married a scamp who called himself
Cresswell but whose real name was Predeaux. He first spent every
penny she had and then left her and her infant child."</p>

<p>"Predeaux!" cried the detective. "Why you told me that was
Jackson's real name."</p>

<p>"Jackson, or Predeaux, was her father," said Kitson, "it was
believed that he was dead; but after John Millinborn's death I
set inquiries on foot and discovered that he had been serving a
life sentence in Cayenne and had been released when the French
President proclaimed a general amnesty at the close of the war.
He was evidently on his way to see John Millinborn the day my
unhappy friend was murdered, and it was the recognition of his
daughter in the palm-court of the Grand Alliance which produced
a fainting-fit to which he was subject."</p>

<p>"But how could he recognize the daughter? Had he seen her
before?"</p>

<p>For answer Kitson took from his pocket a leather folder and
opened it. There were two photographs. One of a beautiful woman
in the fashion of 25 years before; and one a snapshot of a girl
in a modern costume, whom McNorton bad no difficulty in
recognizing as Oliva Cresswell. "Yes," he said, "they might be
the same person."</p>

<p>"That's the mother on the left," explained Kitson, "the
resemblance is remarkable. When Jackson saw the girl he called
her Mary&mdash;that was his wife's name. Millinborn left the
whole of his fortune to Miss Cresswell, but he placed upon me a
solemn charge that she was not to benefit or to know of her
inheritance until she was married. He had a horror of
fortune-hunters. This was the secret which van Heerden
surprised&mdash;I fear with violence&mdash;from poor John as he lay
dying. Since then he has been plotting to many the girl. To do
him justice, I believe that the cold-blooded hound has no other
wish than to secure her money. His acquaintance with White, who
is on the verge of ruin, enabled him to get to know the girl. He
persuaded her to come here and a flat was found for her.
Partly," said the lawyer dryly, "because this block of flats
happens to be her own property and the lady who is supposed to
be the landlady is a nominee of mine."</p>

<p>"And I suppose that explains Mr. Beale," smiled the
inspector.</p>

<p>"That explains Mr. Beale," said Kitson, "whom I brought from
New York especially to shadow van Heerden and to protect the
girl. In the course of investigations Mr. Beale has made another
discovery, the particulars of which I do not know."</p>

<p>There was a little pause.</p>

<p>"Why not tell the girl?" said the superintendent.</p>

<p>Kitson shook his head.</p>

<p>"I have thought it out, and to tell the girl would be
tantamount to breaking my faith with John Millinborn. No, I must
simply shepherd her. The first step we must take "&mdash;he
turned to Beale&mdash;"is to get her away from this place. Can't
you shift your offices to&mdash;say New York?"</p>

<p>Beale shook his head. "I can and I can't," he said. "If you
will forgive my saying so, the matter of the Green Rust is of
infinitely greater importance than Miss Cresswell's safety."</p>

<p>James Kitson frowned.</p>

<p>"I don't like to hear you say that, Beale."</p>

<p>"I don't like hearing myself say it," confessed the other,
"but let me put it this way. I believe by staying here I can
afford her greater protection and at the same time put a spoke
in the wheel of Mr. van Heerden's larger scheme."</p>

<p>Kitson pinched his lips thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," he said. "Now I want to see this
young lady, that is why I have come. I suppose there will be no
difficulty?"</p>

<p>"None at all. I think," said Beale. "I will tell her that you
are interested in the work she is doing. I might introduce you
as Mr. Scobbs," he smiled.</p>

<p>"Who is Scobbs?"</p>

<p>"He is a proprietor of a series of hotels in Western Canada,
and is, I should imagine, a most praiseworthy and inoffensive
captain of minor industry, but Miss Cresswell is rather
interested in him," he laughed. "She found the name occurring in
Canadian guide-books and was struck by its quaintness."</p>

<p>"Scobbs," said the lawyer slowly. "I seem to know that
name."</p>

<p>"You had better know it if I am going to introduce you as
Scobbs himself," laughed Beale.</p>

<p>"Shall I be in the way?" asked the superintendent.</p>

<p>"No, please stay," said Beale. "I would like you to see this
lady. We may want your official assistance one of these days to
get her out of a scrape."</p>

<p>Mr. Beale passed out of the flat and pressed the bell of the
door next to his. There was no response. He pressed it again
after an interval, and stepped back to look at the fanlight. No
light showed and he took out his watch. It was nine o'clock. He
had not seen the girl all day, having been present at the
inquest, but he had heard her door close two hours before. No
reply came to his second ring, and he went back to his flat.</p>

<p>"She's out," he said. "I don't quite understand it. I
particularly requested her yesterday not to go out after dark
for a day or two."</p>

<p>He walked into his bedroom and opened the window. The light
of day was still in the sky, but he took a small electric lamp
to guide him along the narrow steel balcony which connected all
the flats with the fire-escape. He found her window closed and
bolted, but with the skill of a professional burglar he
unfastened the catch and stepped inside.</p>

<p>The room was in darkness. He switched on the light and
glanced round. It was Oliva's bedroom, and her workday hat and
coat were lying on the bed. He opened the long cupboard where
she kept her limited wardrobe. He knew, because it was his
business to know, every dress she possessed. They were all there
as, also, were the three hats which she kept on a shelf. All the
drawers of the bureau were closed and there was no sign of any
disorder such as might be expected if she had changed and gone
out. He opened the door of the bedroom and walked into the
sitting-room, lighting his way across to the electric switch
by means of his lamp.</p>

<p>The moment the light flooded the room he realized that
something was wrong. There was no disorder, but the room
conveyed in some indescribable manner a suggestion of violence.
An object on the floor attracted his attention and he stooped
and picked it up. It was a shoe, and the strap which had held it
in place was broken. He looked at it, slipped it in his pocket
and passed rapidly through the other rooms to the little kitchen
and the tiny bath-room, put on the light in the hall and made a
careful scrutiny of the walls and the floor.</p>

<p>The mat was twisted out of its place, and on the left side of
the wall there were two long scratches. There was a faint sickly
odour. "Ether," he noted mentally.</p>

<p>He went quickly into the dining-room. The little bureau-desk
was open and a letter half-finished was lying on the pad, and it
was addressed to him and ran:</p>

<p class="letter">DEAR MR. BEALE,&mdash;Circumstances beyond my
control make it necessary for me to leave to-night for
Liverpool.</p>

<p>That was all. It was obviously half finished. He picked it
up, folded it carefully and slipped it in his pocket. Then he
returned to the hall, opened the door and passed out.</p>

<p>He explained briefly what had happened and crossed to the
doctor's flat, and rang the bell.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X. &mdash; A FRUITLESS
SEARCH</a></h2>

<p class="first">A LIGHT glowed in the hall, the door was opened
and the doctor, in slippers and velvet coat, stood in the
entrance. He showed no resentment nor did he have time to show
it.</p>

<p>"I want a word with you," said Beale.</p>

<p>"Twenty if you wish," said the doctor cheerfully. "Won't you
come in?"</p>

<p>Beale was half-way in before the invitation was issued and
followed the doctor to his study.</p>

<p>"Are you alone?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Quite alone. I have very few visitors. In fact, my last
visitor was that unhappy man Jackson."</p>

<p>"When did you see Miss Cresswell last?"</p>

<p>The doctor raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"By what right&mdash;? he began.</p>

<p>"Cut all that out," said Beale roughly. "When did you see
Miss Cresswell last?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen her to-day," said the doctor. "I have not
been out of my flat since I came back from the inquest."</p>

<p>"I should like to search your flat," said Beale.</p>

<p>"Policeman, eh?" smiled the doctor. "Certainly you can search
the flat if you have a warrant."</p>

<p>"I have no warrant, but I shall search your flat."</p>

<p>The doctor's face went dull red. "I suppose you know you are
liable to an action for trespass?"</p>

<p>"I know all about that," said Beale, "but if you have nothing
to conceal, Dr. van Heerden, I don't see why you should object."</p>

<p>"I don't object," shrugged the doctor, "search by all means.
Where would you like to start? Here?"</p>

<p>He pointed to three upright cases which stood at the end of
the room nearest the door.</p>

<p>"You will see nothing very pleasant here, they are anatomical
models which have just arrived from Berlin. In fact, I have been
trading with the enemy," he smiled. "They are screwed up, but I
have a screwdriver here."</p>

<p>Beale hesitated.</p>

<p>"There is only another room," the doctor went on, "my
bedroom, but you will not find her there."</p>

<p>Beale twisted round like lightning.</p>

<p>"Her?" he asked. "Who said Her?"</p>

<p>"I gather you are looking for Miss Cresswell," said the
doctor coolly. "You are searching for something, and you ask me
when I saw her last. Who else could you be looking for?"</p>

<p>"Quite right," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Let me show you the way." The doctor walked ahead and turned
on the light in the inner bedroom.</p>

<p>It was a large apartment, simply furnished with a small steel
bed, a hanging wardrobe and a dressing-chest. Beyond that was
his bath-room.</p>

<p>Beale was making a casual survey of this when he heard the
door of the bedroom click behind him. He turned round, jumped
for the door, turned the handle and pulled, but it did not
yield. As he did so he thought he heard a mutter of voices.</p>

<p>"Open the door!" he cried, hammering on the panel. There was
no answer. Then: "Mr. Beale!"</p>

<p>His blood froze at the wild appeal in the tone, for it was
the voice of Oliva Cresswell, and it came from the room he had
quitted.</p>

<p>He smashed at the panel but it was made of tough oak. His
revolver was in his hand and the muzzle was against the lock
when the handle turned and the door opened.</p>

<p>"Did you lock yourself in?" smiled the doctor, looking
blandly at the other's pale face.</p>

<p>"Where is the girl, where is Miss Cresswell?" he demanded. "I
heard her voice."</p>

<p>"You are mad, my friend."</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Cresswell?"</p>

<p>His hand dropped on the other's shoulder and gripped it with
a force that made the other shrink. With an oath the doctor
flung him off.</p>

<p>"Hang you, you madman! How should I know?"</p>

<p>"I heard her voice."</p>

<p>"It was imagination," said the doctor. "I would have opened
the door to you before but I had walked out into the passage and
had rung Miss Cresswell's bell. I found the door open. I suppose
you had been in. I just shut the door and came back here."</p>

<p>Without a word Beale thrust him aside. He had taken one step
to the door when he stopped: At the end of the room had been the
three long anatomical cases. Now there were only two. One had
gone. He did not stop to question the man. He bounded through
the door and raced down the stairs. There was no vehicle in
sight and only a few pedestrians. At the corner of the street he
found a policeman who had witnessed nothing unusual and had not
seen any conveyance carrying a box.</p>

<p>As he returned slowly to the entrance of Krooman Mansions
something made him look up. The doctor was leaning out of the
window smoking a cigar.</p>

<p>"Found her?" he asked mockingly.</p>

<p>Beale made no reply. He came up the stairs, walked straight
through the open door of the doctor's flat and confronted that
calm man as he leant against the table, his hands gripping the
edge, a cigar in the corner of his mouth and a smile of quiet
amusement on his bearded lips.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, "did you find her?"</p>

<p>"I did not find her, but I am satisfied that you will."</p>

<p>Van Heerden's eyes did not falter. "I am beginning to think,
Mr. Beale, that over-indulgence in alcoholic stimulants has
turned your brain," he said mockingly. "You come into my
apartment and demand, with an heroic gesture, where I am
concealing a beautiful young lady, in whose welfare I am at
least as much interested as you, since that lady is my fiancee
and is going to be my wife."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"She is going to be your wife, is she?" said Beale softly. "I
congratulate you if I cannot congratulate her. And when is this
interesting engagement to be announced?"</p>

<p>"It is announced at this moment," said the doctor. "The lady
is on her way to Liverpool, where she will stay with an aunt of
mine. You need not trouble to ask me for her address, because I
shall not give it to you."</p>

<p>"I see," said Beale.</p>

<p>"You come in here, I repeat, demanding with all the gesture
and voice of melodrama, the hiding-place of my
fiancee,"&mdash;he enunciated the two last words with great
relish&mdash;"you ask to search my rooms and I give you
permission. You lock yourself in through your own carelessness
and when I release you you have a revolver in your hand, and are
even more melodramatic than ever. I know what you are going to
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are a clever man," interrupted Beale, "for I don't know
myself."</p>

<p>"You were going to say, or you think, that I have some
sinister purpose in concealing this lady. Well, to resume my
narrative, and to show you your conduct from my point of view, I
no sooner release you than you stare like a lunatic at my
anatomical cases and dash wildly out, to return full of menace
in your tone and attitude. Why?"</p>

<p>"Doctor van Heerden, when I came into your flat there were
three anatomical cases at the end of that room. When I came out
there were two. What happened to the third whilst I was locked
in the room?"</p>

<p>Doctor van Heerden shook his head pityingly. "I am afraid, I
am very much afraid, that you are not right in your head," he
said, and nodded toward the place where the cases stood.</p>

<p>Beale followed the direction of his head and gasped, for
there were three cases.</p>

<p>"I admit that I deceived you when I said they contained
specimens. As a matter of fact, they are empty," said the
doctor. "If you like to inspect them, you can. You may find
some&mdash;clue!"</p>

<p>Beale wanted no invitation. He walked to the cases one by one
and sounded them. Their lids were screwed on but the screws were
dummies. He found in the side of each a minute hole under the
cover of the lid and, taking out his knife, he pressed in the
bodkin with which the knife was equipped and with a click the
lid flew open. The box was empty. The second one answered the
same test and was also empty. The third gave no better result.
He flashed his lamp on the bottom of the box, but there was no
trace of footmarks.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"Far from satisfied," said Beale, and with no other word he
walked out and down the stairs again.</p>

<p>Half-way down he saw something lying on one of the stairs and
picked it up. It was a shoe, the fellow of that which he had in
his pocket, and it had not been there when he came up.</p>

<p>Oliva Cresswell had read the story of the crime in the Post
Record, had folded up the paper with a little shiver and was at
her tiny writing-bureau when a knock came at the door. It was
Dr. van Heerden.</p>

<p>"Can I come in for a moment?" he asked.</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"I shan't eat you," he smiled, "but I am so distressed by
what has happened and I feel that an explanation is due to
you."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't trouble about that," she smiled, "but if you
want to come in, please do."</p>

<p>She closed the door behind him and left the light burning in
the hall. She did not ask him to sit down.</p>

<p>"You have seen the account in the Post Record?" he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"And I suppose you are rather struck with the discrepancy
between what I told you and what I told the reporters, but I
feel you ought to know that I had a very special reason for
protecting this man."</p>

<p>"Of that I have no doubt," she said coldly.</p>

<p>"Miss Cresswell, you must be patient and kind to me," he said
earnestly. "I have devoted a great deal of time and I have run
very considerable dangers in order to save you."</p>

<p>"To save me?" she repeated in surprise.</p>

<p>"Miss Cresswell," he asked, "did you ever know your
father?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, so impressed by the gravity of his tone
that she did not cut the conversation short as she had
intended.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I was a girl when he died. I know nothing of
him. Even his own people who brought him up never spoke of
him."</p>

<p>"Are you sure he is dead?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sure? I have never doubted it. Why do you ask me? Is he
alive?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"What I am going to tell you will be rather painful," he
said: "your father was a notorious swindler." He paused, but she
did not protest.</p>

<p>In her life she had heard many hints which did not redound to
her father's credit, and she had purposely refrained from
pursuing her inquiries.</p>

<p>"Some time ago your father escaped from Cayenne. He is, you
will be surprised to know, a French subject, and the police have
been searching for him for twelve months, including our friend
Mr. Beale."</p>

<p>"It isn't true," she flamed. "How dare you
suggest&mdash;?</p>

<p>"I am merely telling you the facts, Miss Cresswell, and you
must judge them for yourself," said the doctor. "Your father
robbed a bank in France and hid the money in England. Because
they knew that sooner or later he would send for you the police
have been watching you day and night. Your father is at
Liverpool. I had a letter from him this morning. He is dying and
he begs you to go to him."</p>

<p>She sat at the table, stunned. There was in this story a
hideous probability. Her first inclination was to consult Beale,
but instantly she saw that if what the doctor had said was true
such a course would be fatal.</p>

<p>"How do I know you are speaking the truth?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You cannot know until you have seen your father," he said.
"It is a very simple matter."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket an envelope and laid it before
her.</p>

<p>"Here is the address&mdash;64 Hope Street. I advise you to
commit it to memory and tear it up. After all, what possible
interest could I have in your going to Liverpool, or anywhere
else for the matter of that?"</p>

<p>"When is the next train?" she asked.</p>

<p>"One leaves in an hour from Euston."</p>

<p>She thought a moment.</p>

<p>"I'll go," she said decidedly.</p>

<p>She was walking back to her room to put on her coat when he
called her back.</p>

<p>"There's no reason in the world why you should not write to
Beale to tell him where you have gone," he said. "You can leave
a note with me and I will deliver it."</p>

<p>She hesitated again, sat down at her desk and scribbled the
few lines which Beale had found. Then she twisted round in her
chair in perplexity.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it all," she said. "If Mr. Beale is on
the track of my father, surely he will understand from this
letter that I have gone to meet him."</p>

<p>"Let me see what you have written," said van Heerden coolly,
and looked over her shoulder. "Yes, that's enough," he said.</p>

<p>"Enough?"</p>

<p>"Quite enough. You see, my idea was that you should write
sufficient to put him off the track."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you&mdash;there's somebody in the
passage," she said suddenly, and was walking to the door leading
to the hall when he intercepted her.</p>

<p>"Miss Cresswell, I think you will understand me when I tell
you that your father is dead, that the story I have told you
about Beale being on his track is quite untrue, and that it is
necessary for a purpose which I will not disclose to you that
you should be my wife."</p>

<p>She sprang back out of his reach, white as death.
Instinctively she realized that she was in some terrible danger,
and the knowledge turned her cold.</p>

<p>"Your wife?" she repeated. "I think you must be mad,
doctor."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I am perfectly sane. I would have asked you
before, but I knew that you would refuse me. Had our friend
Beale not interfered, the course of true love might have run a
little more smoothly than it has. Now I am going to speak
plainly to you. Miss Cresswell. It is necessary that I should
marry you, and if you agree I shall take you away and place you
in safe keeping. I will marry you at the registrar's office and
part from you the moment the ceremony is completed. I will agree
to allow you a thousand a year and I will promise that I will
not interfere with you or in any way seek your society."</p>

<p>Her courage had revived during this recital of her
future.</p>

<p>"What do you expect me to do," she asked
contemptuously&mdash;"fall on your neck and thank you, you with
your thousand a year and your church-door partings? No, doctor,
if you are sane then you are either a great fool or a great
scoundrel. I would never dream of marrying you under any
circumstances. And now I think you had better go."</p>

<p>This time he did not stop her as she walked to the door and
flung it open. She started back with an exclamation of fear, for
there were two men in the hall.</p>

<p>"What do you&mdash;"</p>

<p>So far she got when the doctor's arm was round her and his
hand was pressed against her mouth. One of the men was carrying
what looked like a rubber bottle with a conical-shaped
mouthpiece. She struggled, but the doctor held her in a grip of
steel. She was thrown to the ground, the rubber cap of the
bottle was pressed over her face, there came a rush of cold air
heavily charged with a sickly scent, and she felt life slipping
away...</p>

<p>"I think she's off now," said the doctor, lifting up her
eyelid, "see if the coast is dear, Gregory, and open the door of
my flat."</p>

<p>The man departed. The doctor lifted the unconscious girl in
his arms. He was in the hall when he felt her move.
Half-conscious as she was, she was struggling to prevent her
abduction. "Quick, the door!" he gasped.</p>

<p>He carried her across the landing into his room, and the door
closed quietly behind him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI. &mdash; THE HOUSE NEAR
STAINES</a></h2>

<p class="first">OLIVA CRESSWELL remembered nothing. She did not
remember being thrust limply into a long narrow box, nor hearing
Beale's voice, nor the click of the door that fastened him in
Dr. van Heerden's bedroom. If she cried out, as she did, she had
no recollection of the fact.</p>

<p>"Carry her, box and all, to her flat. The door is open,"
whispered van Heerden to the two men who had made their
lightning disappearance into the anatomical cases at the sound
of Beale's knock.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Wait till I come to you. Hurry!"</p>

<p>They crossed the landing and passed through the open door of
Oliva's flat and the doctor closed the door behind them and
returned in time to release the savage Beale.</p>

<p>He watched him racing down the stairs, darted to the door of
Oliva's rooms, opened it and went in. In ten seconds she had
been lifted from her narrow prison and laid on her bed, the box
had been returned to the place where it had stood in the
doctor's study and the men had returned to join van Heerden in
Oliva's darkened sitting-room.</p>

<p>Van Heerden had switched on the light in the girl's room and
then noticed for the first time that one of her shoes was
missing. Quickly he slipped off the remaining shoe.</p>

<p>"You wait here," he told the men, "until you hear Beale
return. Then make your escape. On your way down leave the shoe
on the stairs. It will help to put our friend off the
trail."</p>

<p>Half an hour after the discovery of the shoe on the stairs
Beale went out accompanied by his visitors.</p>

<p>The doctor watched the dark figures disappear into the night
from the window of his sitting-room and made his way back to the
girl's flat. She was lying where he had left her, feeling dizzy
and sick. Her eyes closed in a little grimace of distaste as he
put on the light.</p>

<p>"How does my little friend feel now?" he asked coolly.</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>"Really, you must not sulk," he said chidingly, "and you must
get used to being polite because you are going to see a great
deal of me. You had better get up and put your coat on."</p>

<p>She noticed that he had a medicine glass in his hand,
half-filled with a milky-white liquor.</p>

<p>"Drink this," he said.</p>

<p>She pushed it away.</p>

<p>"Come, drink it," he said, "you don't suppose I want to
poison you, do you? I don't even want to drug you, otherwise it
would have been simple to have given you a little more ether.
Drink it. It will take that hazy feeling out of your head."</p>

<p>She took the glass with an unsteady hand and swallowed its
contents. It was bitter and hot and burnt her throat, but its
effects were magical. In three minutes her mind had cleared and
when she sat up she could do so without her head swimming.</p>

<p>"You will now put on your coat and hat, pack a few things
that you want for a journey, and come along with me."</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," she said, "I advise you to
go, Dr. van Heerden, before I inform the police of your
outrageous conduct."</p>

<p>"Put on your hat and coat," he repeated calmly, "and don't
talk nonsense. You don't suppose that I have risked all that I
have risked to let you go at this hour."</p>

<p>"Dr. van Heerden," she said, "if you have any spark of
decency or manhood you will leave me."</p>

<p>He laughed a little. "Now you are talking like a heroine of
Lyceum drama," he said. "Any appeal you might make, Miss
Cresswell, is a waste of time and a waste of breath. I shall
have no hesitation in using violence of the most unpleasant
character unless you do as I tell you."</p>

<p>His voice was quiet, but there was about him a convincing air
of purpose.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to take me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am going to take you to a place of safety. When I say
safety," he added, "I mean safety for me. You yourself need fear
nothing unless you act foolishly, in which case you have
everything to fear. Disabuse your mind of one thought. Miss
Cresswell," he said, "and that is that I am in love with you and
that there is any quality or charm in your admirable person
which would prevent my cutting your throat if it was necessary
for my safety. I am not a brute. I will treat you decently, as
well as any lady could wish to be treated, if you do not cross
me, but I warn you that if in the street you call for help or
attempt to escape you will never know what happened to you."</p>

<p>She stood at the end of her bed, one hand gripping the rail,
her white teeth showing against the red lower lip. "Don't bite
your lips, it does not stimulate thought. I can tell you that as
a medical man, and I can also tell you that this is not the
moment for you to consider plans for outwitting me. Get your
coat and hat on."</p>

<p>His voice was now peremptory, and she obeyed. In a few
minutes she was dressed ready for the street. He led the way out
and holding her arm lightly they passed out into the street. He
turned sharply to the left, the girl keeping in step by his
side. To the casual observer, and few could observe them in the
gloom of the ill-lit thoroughfares through which they passed,
they were a couple on affectionate terms, but the arm locked in
hers was the arm of a gaoler, and once when they stood waiting
to cross busy Oxford Circus, and she had seen a policeman a few
yards away and had cautiously tried to slip her arm from his,
she found her wrist gripped with a hand of steel.</p>

<p>At the Marylebone Road end of Portland Place a car was
waiting and the doctor opened the door and pushed her in,
following immediately.</p>

<p>"I had to keep the car some distance from Krooman Mansions or
Beale would have spotted it immediately," he said in an easy
conversational tone.</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To a highly desirable residence in the Thames Valley," he
said, "in the days when I thought you might be wooed and wed, as
the saying goes, I thought it might make an excellent place for
a honeymoon." He felt her shrink from him.</p>

<p>"Please don't be distressed, I am rather glad that matters
have turned out as they have. I do not like women very much, and
I should have been inexpressibly bored if I had to keep up the
fiction of being in love with you."</p>

<p>"What do you intend doing?" she asked. "You cannot hope to
escape from Mr. Beale. He will find me."</p>

<p>He chuckled.</p>

<p>"As a sleuth-hound, Mr. Beale has his points," he said, "but
they are not points which keep me awake at night. I have always
suspected he was a detective, and, of course, it was he who
planted the registered envelopes on poor old White&mdash;that
was clever," he admitted handsomely, "but Beale, if you will
excuse my hurting your feelings&mdash;and I know you are half
in love with him&mdash;"</p>

<p>She felt her face go hot. "How dare you!" she flamed.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," he begged. "I dare anything in these
circumstances, the greater outrage includes the less. If I
abduct you I feel myself entitled to tease you. No, I think you
had better not place too much faith in Mr. Beale, who doesn't
seem to be a member of the regular police force, and is, I
presume, one of those amateur gentlemen who figure in divorce
cases."</p>

<p>She did not reply. Inwardly she was boiling, and she
recognized with a little feeling of dismay that it was not so
much the indignity which he was offering her, as his undisguised
contempt for the genius of Beale, which enraged her.</p>

<p>They had left the town and were spinning through the country
when she spoke again.</p>

<p>"Will you be kind enough to tell me what you intend
doing?"</p>

<p>He had fallen into a reverie and it was evidently a pleasant
reverie, for he came back to the realities of life with an air
of reluctance.</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, what am I going to do with you? Why, I am going to
marry you."</p>

<p>"Suppose I refuse?"</p>

<p>"You won't refuse. I am offering you the easiest way out.
When you are married to me your danger is at an end. Until you
marry me your hold on life is somewhat precarious."</p>

<p>"But why do you insist upon this?" she asked, bewildered. "If
you don't love me, what is there in marriage for you? There are
plenty of women who would be delighted to have you. Why should
you want to marry a girl without any influence or
position&mdash;a shop-girl, absolutely penniless?"</p>

<p>"It's a whim of mine," he said lightly, "and it's a whim I
mean to gratify."</p>

<p>"Suppose I refuse at the last moment?"</p>

<p>"Then," he said significantly, "you will be awry. I tell you,
no harm is coming to you if you are sensible. If you are not
sensible, imagine the worst that can happen to you, and that
will be the least. I will treat you so that you will not think
of your experience, let alone talk of it."</p>

<p>There was a cold malignity in his voice that made her
shudder. For a moment, and a moment only, she was beaten down by
the horrible hopelessness of her situation, then her natural
courage, her indomitable, self-reliance overcame fear. If he
expected an outburst of anger and incoherent reproach, or if he
expected her to break down into hysterical supplication, he was
disappointed. She had a firm grip upon herself, perfect command
of voice and words.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are one of those clever criminals one reads
about," she said, "prepared for all emergencies, perfectly
self-confident, capable and satisfied that there is nobody quite
so clever as themselves."</p>

<p>"Very likely," he smiled. "It is a form of egotism," he said
quietly. "I read a book once about criminals. It was written by
an Italian and he said that was the chief characteristic of them
all."</p>

<p>"Vanity? And they always do such clever things and such
stupid things at the same time, and their beautiful plans are so
full of absurd miscalculations, just as yours are."</p>

<p>"Just as mine are," he said mockingly.</p>

<p>"Just as yours are," she repeated; "you are so satisfied that
because you are educated and you are a scientist, that you are
ever so much more clever than all the rest of the world."</p>

<p>"Go on," he said. "I like to hear you talking. Your analysis
is nearly perfect and certainly there is a lot of truth in what
you say."</p>

<p>She held down the surging anger which almost choked her and
retained a calm level. Sooner or later she would find the joint
in his harness.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have everything ready?"</p>

<p>"My staff work is always good," he murmured, "marriage
licence, parson, even the place where you will spend your
solitary honeymoon after signing a few documents."</p>

<p>She turned toward him slowly. Against the window of the big
limousine his head was faintly outlined and she imagined the
smile which was on his face at that moment.</p>

<p>"So that is it?" she said. "I must sign a few documents
saying that I married you of my own free will!"</p>

<p>"No, madam," he said, "the circumstances under which you
marry me require no justification and that doesn't worry me in
the slightest."</p>

<p>"What documents have I to sign?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You will discover in time," said he. "Here is the house,
unless my eyesight has gone wrong."</p>

<p>The car turned from the road, seemed to plunge into a high
hedge, though in reality, as the girl saw for a second as the
lamps caught the stone gate-posts, it was the entrance to a
drive, and presently came to a stop before a big rambling house.
Van Heerden jumped down and assisted her to alight. The house
was in darkness, but as they reached the door it was opened.</p>

<p>"Go in," said van Heerden, and pushed her ahead. She found
herself in an old-fashioned hall, the walls panelled of oak, the
floor made of closely mortised stone flags. She recognized the
man who had admitted them as one of those she had seen in her
flat that same night. He was a cadaverous man with high
cheekbones and short, bristly black hair and a tiny black
moustache.</p>

<p>"I won't introduce you," said the doctor, "but you may call
this man Gregory. It is not his name, but it is good
enough."</p>

<p>The man smiled furtively and eyed her furtively, took up the
candle and led the way to a room which opened off the hall at
the farther end.</p>

<p>"This is the dining-room," said van Heerden. "It is chiefly
interesting to you as the place where the ceremony will be
performed. Your room is immediately above. I am sorry I did not
engage a maid for you, but I cannot afford to observe the
proprieties or consider your reputation. The fact is, I know no
woman I could trust to perform that duty, and you will have to
look after yourself."</p>

<p>He led the way upstairs, unlocked a door and passed in. There
was one window which was heavily curtained. He saw her glance
and nodded.</p>

<p>"You will find the windows barred," he said. "This was
evidently the nursery and is admirably suited to my purpose. In
addition, I might tell you that the house is a very old one and
that it is impossible to walk about the room without the door
creaking and, as I spend most of my time in the dining-room
below, you will find it extremely difficult even to make
preparations for escape without my being aware of the fact."</p>

<p>The room was comfortably furnished. A small fire was alight
in the tiny grate and a table had been laid, on which were
displayed sandwiches, a thermos flask and a small silver basket
of confectionery.</p>

<p>There was a door by the big four-poster bed.</p>

<p>"You may consider yourself fortunate in having the only room
in the house with a bath-room attached," he said. "You English
people are rather particular about that kind of thing."</p>

<p>"And you German people aren't," she said coolly.</p>

<p>"German?" he laughed. "So you guessed that, did you?"</p>

<p>"Guessed it?"&mdash;it was her turn to laugh scornfully.
"Isn't the fact self-evident? Who but a Hun&mdash;"</p>

<p>His face went a dull red.</p>

<p>"That is a word you must not use to me," he said
roughly&mdash;"hang your arrogance! Huns! We, who gave the world
its kultur, who lead in every department of science, art and
literature!"</p>

<p>She stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"You are joking, of course," she said, forgetting her danger
for the moment in face of this extraordinary phenomenon. "If you
are a German, and I suppose you are, and an educated German at
that, you don't for a moment imagine you gave the world
anything. Why, the Germans have never been anything but
exploiters of other men's brains."</p>

<p>From dull red, his face had gone white, his lip was trembling
with passion and when he spoke he could scarcely control his
voice.</p>

<p>"We were of all people ordained by God to save the world
through the German spirit."</p>

<p>So far he got when she burst into a fit of uncontrollable
laughter. It was so like all the caricatures of German character
she had read or seen depicted. He looked at her, his face
distorted with rage, and before she had realized what had
happened he had raised his hand and struck her across the
mouth.</p>

<p>She staggered back, speechless. To her had happened the most
incredible thing in the world, more incredible than her
abduction, more incredible than all the villainies known or
suspected, in this man.</p>

<p>He stood there glowering at her, unrepentant, half-tempted,
it seemed, to repeat the blow. He had struck a woman and was not
overwhelmed by shame. All her views of men and things, all her
conceptions of the codes which govern mankind in their dealings
one with the other, crumbled away. If he had fallen on his knees
and asked her pardon, if he had shown any contrition, any fear,
any shame, she might have gone back to her old standards.</p>

<p>"You swine cat!" he said in German, "Herr Gott, but I will
punish you if you laugh at me!"</p>

<p>She was staring at him in intense curiosity. Her lip was
bleeding a little, the red mark of his fingers showed against
her white face, but she seemed to have forgotten the pain or the
shock of the actual blow and was wholly concerned in this new
revelation.</p>

<p>"A Hun," she said, but she seemed to be speaking to herself,
"of course he's a Hun. They do that sort of thing, but I never
believed it before."</p>

<p>He took a step toward her, but she did not flinch, and he
turned and walked quickly from the room, locking the door behind
him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII. &mdash; INTRODUCING PARSON
HOMO</a></h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Beale left Krooman Mansions with his two
companions he had only the haziest idea as to where he should
begin his search. Perhaps the personal interest he had in his
client, an interest revealed by the momentary panic into which
her disappearance had thrown this usually collected young man,
clouded his better judgment.</p>

<p>A vague discomfort possessed him and he paused irresolutely
at the corner of the street. There was a chance that she might
still be concealed in the building, but a greater chance that if
he followed one of the three plans which were rapidly forming in
his mind he might save the girl from whatever danger threatened
her.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly sure you heard her voice?"</p>

<p>"Certain," replied Beale shortly, "just as I am sure that I
smelt the ether."</p>

<p>"She may have been using it for some other purpose. Women put
these drugs to all sorts of weird purposes, like cleaning
gloves, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That may be," interrupted Beale, "but I wasn't mistaken
about her voice. I am not subject to illusions of that
kind."</p>

<p>He whistled. A man who had been lurking in the shadow of a
building on the opposite side of the road crossed to him.</p>

<p>"Fenson," said Beale, "watch these flats. If you see a car
drive up just go along and stand in front of the door. Don't let
anybody enter that car or carry any bundle into that car until
you are sure that Miss Cresswell is not one of the party or the
bundle. If necessary you can pull a gun&mdash;I know it isn't
done in law-abiding London," he smiled at Superintendent
McNorton, "but I guess you've got to let me do a little
law-breaking."</p>

<p>"Go all the way," said the superintendent easily,</p>

<p>"That will do, Fenson. You know Miss Cresswell?"</p>

<p>"Sure, sir," said the man, and melted back into the
shadows.</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?" asked Kitson.</p>

<p>"I am going to interview a gentleman who will probably give
me a great deal of information about van Heerden's other
residences."</p>

<p>"Has he many?" asked Kitson, in surprise.</p>

<p>Beale nodded.</p>

<p>"He has been hiring buildings and houses for the past three
months," he said quietly, "and he has been so clever that I will
defy you to trace one of them. All his hiring has been done
through various lawyers he has employed, and they are all taken
in fictitious names."</p>

<p>"Do you know any of them?"</p>

<p>"Not one," said Beale, with a baffled little laugh, "didn't I
tell you he's mighty clever? I got track of two of them but they
were the only two where the sale didn't go through."</p>

<p>"What does he want houses for?"</p>

<p>"We shall learn one of these days," said Beale cryptically.
"I can tell you something else, gentlemen, and this is more of a
suspicion than a certainty, that there is not a crank scientist
who has ever gone under through drink or crime in the whole of
this country, aye, and America and France, too, that isn't
working for him. And now, gentlemen, if you will excuse
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't want any assistance?" asked the
superintendent.</p>

<p>"I guess not," said Beale, with a smile, "I guess I can
manage the Herr Professor."</p>

<p>On the south side of the River Thames is a congested and
thickly populated area lying between the Waterloo and the
Blackfriars Roads. Here old houses, which are gauntly
picturesque because of their age, stand cheek-by-jowl with great
blocks of model dwellings, which make up in utility all that
they lack in beauty. Such dwelling-places have a double
advantage. Their rent is low and they are close to the centre of
London. Few of the houses are occupied by one family, and indeed
it is the exception that one family rents in its entirety so
much as a floor.</p>

<p>In a basement room in one of those houses sat two men as
unlike one another as it is possible to conceive. The room
itself was strangely tidy and bare of anything but the necessary
furniture. A camp bed was under the window in such a position as
to give its occupant a view of the ankles of those people who
trod the pavement of the little street.</p>

<p>A faded cretonne curtain hid an inner and probably a smaller
room where the elder of the men slept. They sat on either side
of a table, a kerosene lamp placed exactly in the centre
supplying light for their various occupations.</p>

<p>The elder of the two was bent forward over a microscope, his
big hands adjusting the focus screw. Presently he would break
off his work of observation and jot down a few notes in crabbed
German characters. His big head, his squat body, his long
ungainly arms, his pale face with its little wisp of beard,
would have been recognized by Oliva Cresswell, for this was
Professor Heyler&mdash;"the Herr Professor," as Beale called
him.</p>

<p>The man sitting opposite was cast in a different mould. He
was tall, spare, almost aesthetic. The clean-shaven face, the
well-moulded nose and chin hinted at a refinement which his
shabby threadbare suit and his collarless shirt freakishly
accentuated. Now and again he would raise his deep-set eyes from
the book he was reading, survey the absorbed professor with a
speculative glance and then return to his reading.</p>

<p>They had sat in silence for the greater part of an hour, when
Beale's tap on the door brought the reader round with narrow
eyes.</p>

<p>"Expecting a visitor, professor?" he asked in German.</p>

<p>"Nein, nein," rambled the old man, "who shall visit me? Ah
yes "&mdash;he tapped his fat forefinger&mdash;"I remember, the
Fraulein was to call."</p>

<p>He got up and, shuffling to the door, slipped back the bolt
and turned it. His face fell when he saw Beale, and the man at
the table rose.</p>

<p>"Hope I am not disturbing you," said the detective. "I
thought you lived alone."</p>

<p>He, too, spoke in the language which the professor understood
best.</p>

<p>"That is a friend of mine," said old Heyler uncomfortably,
"we live together. I did not think you knew my address."</p>

<p>"Introduce me," said the man at the table coolly.</p>

<p>The old professor looked dubiously from one to the other.</p>

<p>"It is my friend, Herr Homo."</p>

<p>"Herr Homo," repeated Beale, offering his hand, "my name is
Beale."</p>

<p>Homo shot a keen glance at him.</p>

<p>"A split! or my criminal instincts fail me," he said,
pleasantly enough.</p>

<p>"Split?" repeated Beale, puzzled.</p>

<p>"American I gather from your accent," said Mr. Homo; "pray
sit down. 'Split' is the phrase employed by the criminal classes
to describe a gentleman who in your country is known as a 'fly
cop'!"</p>

<p>"Oh, a detective," smiled Beale. "No, in the sense you mean I
am not a detective. At any rate, I have not come on
business."</p>

<p>"So I gather," said the other, seating himself, "or you would
have brought one of the 'busy fellows' with you. Here again
you must pardon the slang but we call the detective the 'busy
fellow' to distinguish him from the 'flattie,' who is the
regular cop. Unless you should be under any misapprehension, Mr.
Beale, it is my duty to tell you that I am a representative of
the criminal classes, a fact which our learned friend," he
nodded toward the distressed professor, "never ceases to
deplore," and he smiled blandly.</p>

<p>They had dropped into English and the professor after waiting
uncomfortably for the visitor to explain his business had
dropped back to his work with a grunt.</p>

<p>"I am Parson Homo and this is my pied-a-terre. We
professional criminals must have somewhere to go when we are not
in prison, you know."</p>

<p>The voice was that of an educated man, its modulation, the
confidence and the perfect poise of the speaker suggested the
college man.</p>

<p>"So that you shall not be shocked by revelations I must tell
you that I have just come out of prison. I am by way of being a
professional burglar."</p>

<p>"I am not easily shocked," said Beale. He glanced at the
professor.</p>

<p>"I see," said Parson Homo, rising, "that I am de trop.
Unfortunately I cannot go into the street without risking
arrest. In this country, you know, there is a law which is
called the Prevention of Crimes Act, which empowers the
unemployed members of the constabulary who find time hanging on
their hands to arrest known criminals on suspicion if they are
seen out in questionable circumstances. And as all circumstances
are questionable to the unimaginative 'flattie,' and his no less
obtuse friend the 'split,' I will retire to the bedroom and
stuff my ears with cotton-wool."</p>

<p>"You needn't," smiled Beale, "I guess the professor hasn't
many secrets from you."</p>

<p>"Go on guessing, my ingenious friend," said the parson,
smiling with his eyes, "my own secrets I am willing to reveal
but&mdash;adios!"</p>

<p>He waved his hand and passed behind the cretonne curtain and
the old man looked up from his instrument. "It is the Donovan
Leichmann body that I search for," he said solemnly; "there was
a case of sleeping-sickness at the docks, and the Herr Professor
of the Tropical School so kindly let me have a little blood for
testing."</p>

<p>"Professor," said Beale, sitting down in the place which
Parson Homo had vacated and leaning across the table, "are you
still working for van Heerden?"</p>

<p>The old man rolled his big head from side to side in an agony
of protest.</p>

<p>"Of the learned doctor I do not want to speak," he said, "to
me he has been most kind. Consider, Herr Peale, I was starving
in this country which hates Germans and regard as a mad old fool
and an ugly old devil, and none helped me until the learned
doctor discovered me. I am a German, yes. Yet I have no
nationality, being absorbed in the larger brotherhood of
science. As for me I am indifferent whether the Kaiser or the
Socialists live in Potsdam, but I am loyal, Herr Peale, to all
who help me. To you, also," he said hastily, "for you have been
most kind, and once when in foolishness I went into a room where
I ought not to have been you saved me from the police." He
shrugged his massive shoulders again. "I am grateful, but must I
not also be grateful to the learned doctor?"</p>

<p>"Tell me this, professor," said Beale, "where can I find the
learned doctor to-night?"</p>

<p>"At his so-well-known laboratory, where else?" asked the
professor.</p>

<p>"Where else?" repeated Beale. The old man was silent.</p>

<p>"It is forbidden that I should speak," he said; "the Herr
Doctor is engaged in a great experiment which will bring him
fortune. If I betray his secrets he may be ruined. Such
ingratitude, Herr Peale!"</p>

<p>There was a silence, the old professor, obviously distressed
and ill at ease, looking anxiously at the younger man.</p>

<p>"Suppose I tell you that the Herr Doctor is engaged in a
dangerous conspiracy," said Beale, "and that you yourself are
running a considerable risk by assisting him?"</p>

<p>The big hands were outspread in despair. "The Herr Doctor has
many enemies," mumbled Heyler. "I can tell you nothing, Herr
Peale."</p>

<p>"Tell me this," said Beale: "is there any place you know of
where the doctor may have taken a lady&mdash;the young lady into
whose room you went the night I found you?"</p>

<p>"A young lady?" The old man was obviously surprised. "No, no,
Herr Peale, there is no place where a young lady could go. Ach!
No!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Beale, after a pause, "I guess I can do no more
with you, professor." He glanced round at the cretonne recess.
"I won't inconvenience you any longer, Mr. Homo."</p>

<p>The curtains were pushed aside and the aesthetic-looking man
stepped out, the half-smile on his thin lips.</p>

<p>"I fear you have had a disappointing visit," he said
pleasantly, "and it is on the tip of your tongue to ask me if I
can help you. I will save you the trouble of asking&mdash;I
can't."</p>

<p>Beale laughed. "You are a bad thought-reader," he said. "I
had no intention of asking you."</p>

<p>He nodded to the old man, and with another nod to his
companion was turning when a rap came at the door. He saw the
two men exchange glances and noted in the face of the professor
a look of blank dismay. The knock was repeated impatiently.</p>

<p>"Permit me," said Beale, and stepped to the door. "Wait,
wait," stammered the professor, "if Mr. Peale will
permit&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shuffled forward, but Beale had turned the latch and
opened the door wide. Standing in the entrance was a girl whom
he had no difficulty in recognizing as Hilda Glaum, sometime
desk companion of Oliva Cresswell. His back was to the light and
she did not recognize him.</p>

<p>"Why did you not open more quickly?" she asked in German, and
swung the heavy bag she carried into the room, "every moment I
thought I should be intercepted. Here is the bag. It will be
called for to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was then that she saw Beale for the first time and her
face went white.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who are you?" she asked; then quickly, "I know
you. You are the man Beale. The drunken man&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked from him to the bag at her feet and to him again,
then before he could divine her intention she had stooped and
grasped the handle of the bag. Instantly all his attention was
riveted upon that leather case and its secret. His hand shot out
and gripped her arm, but she wrenched herself free. In doing so
the bag was carried by the momentum of its release and was
driven heavily against the wall. He heard a shivering crash as
though a hundred little glasses had broken simultaneously.</p>

<p>Before he could reach the bag she snatched it up, leapt
through the open door and slammed it to behind her. His hand was
on the latch...</p>

<p>"Put 'em up, Mr. Beale, put 'em up," said a voice behind him.
"Right above your head, Mr. Beale, where we can see them."</p>

<p>He turned slowly, his hands rising mechanically to face
Parson Homo, who still sat at the table, but he had discarded
his Greek book and was handling a business-like revolver, the
muzzle of which covered the detective.</p>

<p>"Smells rotten, doesn't it?" said Homo pleasantly.</p>

<p>Beale, too, had sniffed the musty odour, and knew that it
came from the bag the girl had wrenched from his grasp. It was
the sickly scent of the Green Rust!</p>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; AT DEANS
FOLLY</a></h2>

<p class="first">WITH her elbows resting on the broad
window-ledge and her cheeks against the cold steel bars which
covered the window, Oliva Cresswell watched the mists slowly
dissipate in the gentle warmth of the morning sun. She had spent
the night dozing in a rocking-chair and at the first light of
day she had bathed and redressed ready for any emergency. She
had not heard any sound during the night and she guessed that
van Heerden had returned to London.</p>

<p>The room in which she was imprisoned was on the first floor
at the back of the house and the view she had of the grounds was
restricted to a glimpse between two big lilac bushes which were
planted almost on a level with her room.</p>

<p>The house had been built on the slope of a gentle rise so
that you might walk from the first-floor window on to the grassy
lawn at the back of the house but for two important obstacles,
the first being represented by the bars which protected the
window and the second by a deep area, concrete-lined, which
formed a trench too wide to jump.</p>

<p>She could see, however, that the grounds were extensive. The
high wall which, apparently, separated the garden from the road
was a hundred yards away. She knew it must be the road because
of a little brown gate which from time to time she saw between
the swaying bushes. She turned wearily from the window and sat
on the edge of the bed. She was not afraid&mdash;irritated
would be a better word to describe her emotion. She was
mystified, too, and that was an added irritation.</p>

<p>Why should this man, van Heerden, who admittedly did not love
her, who indeed loved her so little that he could strike her and
show no signs of remorse&mdash;why did this man want to marry
her? If he wanted to marry her, why did he kidnap her?</p>

<p>There was another question, too, which she had debated that
night. Why did his reference to the American detective, Beale,
so greatly embarrass her?</p>

<p>She had reached the point where even such tremendous subjects
of debate had become less interesting than the answer to that
question which was furnished, when a knock came to her door and
a gruff voice said:</p>

<p>"Breakfast!"</p>

<p>She unlocked the door and pulled it open. The man called
Gregory was standing on the landing. He jerked his thumb to the
room opposite.</p>

<p>"You can use both these rooms," he said, "but you can't come
downstairs. I have put your breakfast in there."</p>

<p>She followed the thumb across the landing and found herself
in a plainly furnished sitting-room. The table had been laid
with a respectable breakfast, and until she had appeased her
healthy young appetite she took very little stock of her
surroundings.</p>

<p>The man came up in half an hour to clear away the table.</p>

<p>"Will you be kind enough to tell me where I am?" asked
Oliva.</p>

<p>"I am not going to tell you anything," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know that by detaining me here you are
committing a very serious crime?"</p>

<p>"Tell it to the doctor," said the man, with a queer little
smile.</p>

<p>She followed him out to the landing. She wanted to see what
sort of guard was kept and what possibilities there were of
escape. Somehow it seemed easier to make a reconnaissance now
under his very eyes than it had been in the night, when in every
shadow had lurked a menace.</p>

<p>She did not follow him far, however. He put down the tray at
the head of the stairs and reaching out both his hands drew two
sliding doors from the wall and snapped them in her face. She
heard the click of a door and knew that any chance of escape
from this direction was hopeless. The doors had slid noiselessly
on their oiled runners and had formed for her a little lobby of
the landing. She guessed that the sliding doors had been closed
after van Heerden's departure. She had exhausted all the
possibilities of her bedroom and now began an inspection of the
other.</p>

<p>Like its fellow, the windows were barred. There was a
bookshelf, crowded with old volumes, mostly on matters
ecclesiastical or theological. She looked at it
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Now, if I were clever like Mr. Beale," she said aloud, "I
could deduce quite a lot from this room."</p>

<p>A distant church bell began to clang and she realized with a
start that the day was Sunday. She looked at her watch and was
amazed to see it was nearly eleven. She must have slept longer
than she had thought.</p>

<p>This window afforded her no better view than did that of the
bedroom, except that she could see the gate more plainly and
what looked to be the end of a low-roofed brick building which
had been erected against the wall. She craned her neck, looking
left and right, but the bushes had been carefully planted to
give the previous occupants of these two rooms greater
privacy.</p>

<p>Presently the bell stopped and she addressed herself again to
an examination of the room. In an old-fashioned sloping desk she
found a few sheets of paper, a pen and a bottle half-filled with
thick ink. There were also two telegraph forms, and these gave
her an idea. She went back to the table in the middle of the
room. With paper before her she began to note the contents of
the apartment.</p>

<p>"I am trying to be Bealish," she admitted.</p>

<p>She might also have confessed that she was trying to keep her
mind off her possibly perilous position and that though she was
not afraid she had a fear of fear.</p>

<p>"A case full of very dull good books. That means that the
person who lived here before was very serious-minded."</p>

<p>She walked over and examined the titles, pulled out a few
books and looked at their title pages. They all bore the same
name, "L.T.B. Stringer." She uttered an exclamation. Wasn't
there some directory of clergymen's names?&mdash;she was sure
this was a clergyman, nobody else would have a library of such
weighty volumes.</p>

<p>Her fingers ran along the shelves and presently she found
what she wanted&mdash;Crocker's Clergy List of 1879. She opened
the book and presently found, "Stringer, Laurence Thomas
Benjamin, Vicar of Upper Staines, Deans Folly, Upper Reach
Village, near Staines."</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled. Instinctively she knew that she had
located her prison. Van Heerden had certainly hired the house
furnished, probably from the clergyman or his widow. She began
to search the room with feverish haste. Near the window was a
cupboard built out. She opened it and found that it was a small
service lift, apparently communicating with the kitchen. In a
corner of the room was an invalid chair on wheels.</p>

<p>She sat down at the table and reconstructed the character of
its occupant. She saw an invalid clergyman who had lived
permanently in this part of the house. He was probably wheeled
from his bedroom to his sitting-room, and in this cheerless
chamber had spent the last years of his life. And this place was
Deans Folly? She took up the telegraph form and after a few
minutes' deliberation wrote:</p>

<p>"To Beale, Krooman Mansions."</p>

<p>She scratched that out, remembering that he had a telegraphic
address and substituted:</p>

<p>"Belocity, London." She thought a moment, then wrote: "Am
imprisoned at Deans Folly, Upper Reach Village, near Staines.
Oliva." That looked too bold; and she added "Cresswell."</p>

<p>She took a florin from her bag and wrapped it up in the
telegraph form. She had no exact idea as to how she should get
the message sent to the telegraph office, and it was Sunday,
when all telegraph offices would be closed. Nor was there any
immediate prospect of her finding a messenger. She supposed that
tradesmen came to the house and that the kitchen door was
somewhere under her window, but tradesmen do not call on
Sundays. She held the little package irresolutely in her hand.
She must take her chance to-day. To-morrow would be Monday and
it was certain somebody would call.</p>

<p>With this assurance she tucked the message into her blouse.
She was in no mood to continue her inspection of the room, and
it was only because in looking again from the window she pulled
it from its hook that she saw the strange-looking instrument
which hung between the window and the service lift. She picked
it up, a dusty-looking thing. It consisted of a short vulcanite
handle, from which extended two flat steel supports, terminating
in vulcanite ear-plates. The handle was connected by a green
cord with a plug in the wall.</p>

<p>Oliva recognized it. It was an electrophone. One of those
instruments by which stay-at-home people can listen to an opera,
a theatrical entertainment or&mdash;a sermon. Of course it was a
church. It was a very common practice for invalids to be
connected up with their favourite pulpit, and doubtless the Rev.
Mr. Stringer had derived considerable comfort from this
invention.</p>

<p>She dusted the receiver and put them to her ears. She heard
nothing. Beneath the plug was a little switch. She turned this
over and instantly her ears were filled with a strange hollow
sound&mdash;the sound which a bad gramophone record makes.</p>

<p>Then she realized that she was listening to a congregation
singing. This ceased after awhile and she heard a cough, so
surprisingly near and loud that she started. Of course, the
transmitter would be in the pulpit, she thought. Then a voice
spoke, clear and distinct, yet with that drawl which is the
peculiar property of ministers of the Established Church. She
smiled as the first words came to her.</p>

<p>"I publish the banns of marriage between Henry Colebrook, and
Jane Maria Smith both of this parish. This is the second time of
asking." A pause, then: "Also between Henry Victor Vanden and
Oliva Cresswell Predeaux, both of this parish. This is the third
time of asking. If any of you know cause or just impediment why
these persons should not be joined together in holy matrimony,
ye are to declare it."</p>

<p>She dropped the instrument with a crash and stood staring
down at it. She had been listening to the publication of her own
wedding-notice.</p>

<p>"Vanden" was van Heerden. "Oliva Cresswell Predeaux" was
herself. The strangeness of the names meant nothing. She guessed
rather than knew that the false name would not be any
insuperable bar to the ceremony. She must get away. For the
first time she had a horrible sense of being trapped, and for a
few seconds she must have lost her head, for she tugged at the
iron bars, dashed wildly out and hammered at the sliding door.
Presently her reason took charge. She heard the heavy step of
Gregory on the stairs and recovered her calm by the time he had
unlocked the bar and pulled the doors apart.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I want you to let me out of here."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all?" he said sarcastically, and for the second
time that day slammed the door in her face.</p>

<p>She waited until he was out of hearing, then she went back
noiselessly to the sitting-room. She pushed open the door of the
service lift and tested the ropes. There were two, one which
supported the lift and one by which it was hauled up, and she
gathered that these with the lift itself formed an endless
chain.</p>

<p>Gripping both ropes firmly she crept into the confined space
of the cupboard and let herself down hand over hand. She had
about twelve feet to descend before she reached the kitchen
entrance of the elevator. She squeezed through the narrow
opening and found herself in a stone-flagged kitchen. It was
empty. A small fire glowed in the grate. Her own tray with all
the crockery unwashed was on the dresser, and there were the
remnants of a meal at one end of the plain table. She tiptoed
across the kitchen to the door. It was bolted top and bottom and
locked. Fortunately the key was in the lock, and in two minutes
she was outside in a small courtyard beneath the level of the
ground.</p>

<p>One end of the courtyard led past another window, and that
she could not risk. To her right was a flight of stone steps,
and that was obviously the safer way. She found herself in a
little park which fortunately for her was plentifully sprinkled
with clumps of rhododendrons, and she crept from bush to bush,
taking care to keep out of sight of the house. She had the
telegram and the money in her hand, and her first object was to
get this outside. It took her twenty minutes to reach the wall.
It was too high to scale and there was no sign of a ladder. The
only way out was the little brown door she had seen from her
bedroom window, and cautiously she made her way back, flitting
from bush to bush until she came to the place where a clear view
of the door and the building to its left could be obtained.</p>

<p>The low-roofed shed she had seen was much longer than she had
expected and evidently had recently been built. Its black face
was punctured at intervals with square windows, and a roughly
painted door to the left of the brown garden gate was the only
entrance she could see. She looked for a key but without hope of
finding one. She must take her chance, she thought, and a quick
run brought her from the cover of the bushes to the brown portal
which stood between her and liberty.</p>

<p>With trembling hands she slid back the bolts and turned the
handle. Her heart leapt as it gave a little. Evidently it had
not been used for years and she found it was only held fast by
the gravel which had accumulated beneath it. Eagerly she scraped
the gravel aside with her foot and her hand was on the knob when
she heard a muffled voice behind her. She turned and then with a
gasp of horror fell back. Standing in the doorway of the shed
was a thing which was neither man nor beast. It was covered in a
wrap which had once been white but was now dappled with green.
The face and head were covered with rubber, two green staring
eyes surveyed her, and a great snout-like nose was uplifted as
in amazement. She was paralysed for a moment. For the
beastliness of the figure was appalling.</p>

<p>Then realizing that it was merely a man whose face was hidden
by a hideous mask, she sprang again for the door, but a hand
gripped her arm and pulled her back. She heard a cheerful
whistle from the road without and remembering the package in her
hand she flung it high over the wall and heard its soft thud,
and the whistle stop.</p>

<p>Then as the hideous figure slipped his arm about her and
pressed a musty hand over her mouth she fainted.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; MR. BEALE SUGGESTS
MARRIAGE</a></h2>

<p class="first">"HELD up by a gunman?" asked James Kitson
incredulously, "why, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't sound right, does it?" smiled Beale, "especially
after McNorton telling us the other day that there was no such
thing as a gunman in England. Do you remember his long
dissertation on the law-abiding criminals of this little old
country?" he laughed.</p>

<p>"But a gunman," protested Mr. Kitson&mdash;"by the way, have
you had breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Hours ago," replied Beale, "but don't let me interrupt
you."</p>

<p>Mr. James Kitson pulled his chair to the table and unfolded
his napkin. It was almost at this hour that Oliva Cresswell had
performed a similar act.</p>

<p>"You are not interrupting me," said Kitson, "go on."</p>

<p>Beale was frowning down at deserted Piccadilly which Mr.
Kitson's palatial suite at the Ritz-Carlton overlooked.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he said absently, "oh yes, the gunman&mdash;a sure
enough gunman."</p>

<p>He related in a few words his experience of the previous
night.</p>

<p>"This man Homo." said Kitson, "is he one of the gang?"</p>

<p>Beale shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. He may be one of van Heerden's
ambassadors."</p>

<p>"Ambassadors?"</p>

<p>"I will explain van Heerden's game one of these days and you
will understand what I mean," said Beale. "No, I don't think
that Parson Homo is being any more than a gentle knight
succouring a distressed lady, whether for love of the lady, out
of respect for the professor or from a general sense of
antagonism to all detectives, I can only speculate. Anyway, he
held me until the lady was out of hearing and presumably out of
sight. And then there was no need for me to go. I just sat down
and talked, and a more amiable and cultured gentleman it would
be impossible to meet."</p>

<p>Kitson looked at his companion through narrowed lids.</p>

<p>"Why, that's not like you, Beale," he said. "I thought you
were too hot on the scent to waste time."</p>

<p>"So I am," said the other, thrusting his hands deep into his
pockets, "that's just what I am." He turned suddenly to the
older man. "Mr. Kitson, I've got to know a little more about
John Millinborn's will than I know at present."</p>

<p>The lawyer looked up, fixed his glasses and regarded the
younger man with a troubled look.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to jump in on you like this, but I'm rattled. I
don't understand much about the English law though I know that
marriages aren't as easy to make here in London as they are in
our country. But here as everywhere else it is fairly difficult
to force a girl into marriage against her will, and the marriage
of course is not good in law."</p>

<p>He sat down on the arm of a couch, dangling his hat between
his legs, and ran his fingers through his hair with a nervous
little laugh.</p>

<p>"Here I'm telling you all that I came to ask you."</p>

<p>"Have a cup of tea," said Kitson, with a smile, "everybody in
England rushes to tea and I hope I shall get you in the
habit."</p>

<p>Beale shook his head.</p>

<p>"You are right about the marriage," Kitson went on, "but I'll
give you the law on the subject. A marriage can only be
solemnized if due notice is given by the parties who must be
resident in the district where it is to take place&mdash;three
weeks is the period of notice."</p>

<p>"Is there no other way?"</p>

<p>"Yes. By paying special fees and offering a good and
sufficient reason a faculty can be secured from the Archbishop
of Canterbury, or rather from his officials, authorizing a
marriage without notice. It is called a special licence, and the
marriage may occur at any hour and at any place."</p>

<p>"Is there a register of applications?" asked Beale
quickly.</p>

<p>"I've thought of that," nodded the lawyer, "yes, I'm keeping
that side under observation. It is difficult because officialdom
isn't as obliging as it might be. My own view is that van
Heerden will be married in the ordinary way, that is to say by
giving notice. To secure his special licence he would be obliged
to give his own name and be vouched for; he can be married in
the ordinary way even if he gives a false name, which in all
probability he will."</p>

<p>"Would the marriage be legal if it was in a false name?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. In English law you may commit an offence by
marrying in a wrong name, but it would not invalidate the
marriage."</p>

<p>Stanford Beale sat studying the pattern of the carpet.</p>

<p>"Is there any chance of two special licences being issued to
marry the same girl?" he asked.</p>

<p>"None&mdash;why do you ask?"</p>

<p>Beale did not reply immediately.</p>

<p>"Something Homo said last night when I told him frankly that
I was searching for Miss Cresswell. 'Oh,' said he, 'that's the
lady that's marrying the doctor.' He wouldn't tell me more. But
he gave me an idea to make sure that no special licence is
issued to van Heerden. I shall apply for one myself."</p>

<p>The lawyer stared at him.</p>

<p>"To marry the girl?" he gasped. "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stanford Beale laughed a little bitterly.</p>

<p>"Say, don't get up in the air, Mr. Kitson&mdash;I'm only
thinking of Miss Cresswell. A special licence in my name would
stop one of van Heerden's paths to easy money. Tell me, and this
is what I came to ask you, under Millinborn's will, does the
husband benefit directly by the marriage, or is he dependent
upon what his wife gives him?'</p>

<p>"He benefits directly," said Kitson after a pause, "on his
marriage he receives exactly one-half of the girl's fortune.
That was Millinborn's idea. 'Make the husband independent,' he
said, 'do not put him in the humiliating position of dependence
on his wife's generosity, and there will be a chance of
happiness for them both.'"</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;of course, van Heerden knows that. He has only
to produce a marriage certificate to scoop in two and a half
million dollars&mdash;that is half a million in English money.
This is the secret of it all. He wants money immediately, and
under the terms of the will&mdash;?</p>

<p>"He gets it," said Kitson. "If he came to me to-morrow with
proof of his marriage, even if I knew that he had coerced the
girl into marriage, I must give him his share&mdash;van Heerden
was pretty thorough when he put my dying friend through his
examination." His face hardened. "Heavens, I'd give every penny
I had in the world to bring that fiend to the gallows,
Beale!"</p>

<p>His voice shook, and rising abruptly he walked to the window.
Presently he turned. "I think there is something in your idea.
Get the licence."</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;and marry her," said Beale quickly. "Marry her
&mdash;I don't quite understand you?" For the first time there
was suspicion in his voice.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kitson, I'm going to put all my cards on the table,"
said Beale quietly, "will you sit down a moment? There are
certain facts which we cannot ignore. Fact one is that Oliva
Cresswell is in the hands of a man who is absolutely
unscrupulous, but has no other object in view than marriage. Her
beauty, her charm, all the attractive qualities which appeal to
most men and to all brutes have no appeal for him&mdash;to him
she is just a money proposition. If he can't marry her, she has
no further interest for him."</p>

<p>"I see that," agreed the lawyer, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, please. If we knew where she was we could stop the
marriage and indict van Heerden&mdash;but I've an idea that we
shan't locate her until it is too late or nearly too late. I
can't go hunting with a pack of policemen. I must play a lone
hand, or nearly a lone hand. When I find her I must be in a
position to marry her without losing a moment."</p>

<p>"You mean to marry her to foil van Heerden, and
after&mdash;to dissolve the marriage?" asked the lawyer, shaking
his head. "I don't like that solution, Beale&mdash;I tell you
frankly, I don't like it. You're a good man and I have every
faith in you, but if I consented, even though I were confident
that you would play fair, which I am, I should feel that I had
betrayed John Millinborn's trust. It isn't because it is you, my
son," he said kindly enough, "but if you were the Archangel
Gabriel I'd kick at that plan. Marriage is a difficult business
to get out of once you are in it, especially in this
country."</p>

<p>Beale did not interrupt the older man. "Right, and now if
you've finished I'll tell you my scheme," he said, "as I see it
there's only a ghost of a chance of our saving this girl from
marriage. I've done my best and we&mdash;McNorton and
I&mdash;have taken all the facts before a judge this morning. We
got a special interview with the idea of securing a warrant for
van Heerden's arrest. But there is no evidence to convict him on
any single charge. We cannot connect him with the disappearance
of Miss Cresswell, and although I pointed out that van Heerden
admits that he knows where the girl is, the judge said, fairly I
thought, that there was no law which compelled a man to divulge
the address of his fiancee to one who was a possible rival. The
girl is of an age when she can do as she wishes, and as I
understand the matter you have no legal status as a
guardian."</p>

<p>"None," said James Kitson, "that is our weak point. I am
merely the custodian of her money. Officially I am supposed to
be ignorant of the fact that Oliva Cresswell is Oliva Predeaux,
the heiress."</p>

<p>"Therefore our hands are tied," concluded Beale quietly.
"Don't you see that my plan is the only one&mdash;but I haven't
told you what it is. There's a man, a criminal, this Parson Homo
who can help; I am satisfied that he does not know where the
girl is&mdash;but he'll help for a consideration. As a matter of
fact, he was pulled again. I am seeing him this afternoon."</p>

<p>Mr. Kitson frowned.</p>

<p>"The gunman&mdash;how can he help you?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. This man, as I say, is known to the police
as Parson Homo. Apparently he is an unfrocked priest, one who
has gone under. He still preserves the resemblance to a
gentleman;" he spoke slowly and deliberately; "in decent clothes
he would look like a parson. I propose that he shall marry me to
Miss Cresswell. The marriage will be a fake, but neither the
girl nor Van Heerden will know this. If my surmise is right,
when van Heerden finds she is married he will take no further
steps&mdash;except, perhaps," he smiled, "to make her a widow.
Sooner or later we are bound to get him under lock and key, and
then we can tell Miss Cresswell the truth."</p>

<p>"In other words, you intend breaking the law and committing a
serious offence," said Kitson, shaking his head. "I can't be a
party to that&mdash;besides, she may not marry you."</p>

<p>"I see that danger&mdash;van Heerden is a mighty clever
fellow. He may be married before I trace them."</p>

<p>"You say that Homo doesn't know about the girl, what does he
know?"</p>

<p>"He has heard of van Heerden. He has heard probably from the
girl Hilda Glaum that van Heerden is getting married&mdash;the
underworld do not get their news out of special
editions&mdash;he probably knows too that van Heerden is engaged
in some swindle which is outside the parson's line of
business."</p>

<p>"Will he help you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," Beale said with quiet confidence, "the man is broke
and desperate. The police watch him like a cat, and would get
him sooner or later. McNorton told me that much. I have offered
him passage to Australia and &pound;500, and he is ready to jump
at it."</p>

<p>"You have explained the scheme?"</p>

<p>"I had to," confessed Beale, "there was no time to be lost.
To my surprise he didn't like it. It appears that even a
double-dyed crook has scruples, and even when I told him the
whole of my plan he still didn't like it, but eventually agreed.
He has gone to Whitechapel to get the necessary kit. I am
putting him up in my flat. Of course, it may not be necessary,"
he went on, "but somehow I think it will be."</p>

<p>Kitson spread out his hands in despair.</p>

<p>"I shall have to consent," he said, "the whole thing was a
mistake from the beginning. I trust you, Stanford," he went on,
looking the other in the eye, "you have no feeling beyond an
ordinary professional interest in this young lady?"</p>

<p>Beale dropped his eyes.</p>

<p>"If I said that, Mr. Kitson, I should be telling a lie," he
said quietly. "I have a very deep interest in Miss Cresswell,
but that is not going to make any difference to me and she will
never know."</p>

<p>He left soon after this and went back to his rooms. At four
o'clock he received a visitor. Parson Homo, cleanly shaved and
attired in a well-fitting black coat and white choker, seemed
more real to the detective than the Parson Homo he had met on
the previous night.</p>

<p>"You look the part all right," said Beale.</p>

<p>"I suppose I do," said the other shortly; "what am I to do
next?"</p>

<p>"You stay here. I have made up a bed for you in my study,"
said Beale.</p>

<p>"I would like to know a little more of this before I go any
further," Homo said, "there are many reasons why I want
information."</p>

<p>"I have told you the story," said Beale patiently, "and I am
going to say right here that I do not intend telling you any
more. You carry this thing through and I'll pay you what I
agreed. Nobody will be injured by your deception, that I promise
you."</p>

<p>"That doesn't worry me so much," said "the other coolly,
"as&mdash;"</p>

<p>There came a knock at the door, an agitated hurried knock,
and Beale immediately answered it. It was McNorton, and from
force of habit Parson Homo drew back into the shadows.</p>

<p>"All right, Parson," said McNorton, "I knew you were here.
What do you make of this?"</p>

<p>He turned to Beale and laid on the table a piece of paper
which had been badly crumpled and which he now smoothed out. It
was the top half of a telegraph form, the lower half had been
torn away.</p>

<p>"'To Belocity, London,'" Beale read aloud.</p>

<p>"That's you," interrupted McNorton, and the other nodded.</p>

<p>"'To Belocity, London,'" he read slowly. "'Am imprisoned at
Deans&mdash;'"</p>

<p>At this point the remainder of the message had been torn
off.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15">XV. &mdash; THE GOOD HERR
STARDT</a></h2>

<p class="first">"WHERE is the rest?" said Beale.</p>

<p>"That's the lot," replied McNorton grimly. "It's the only
information you will get from this source for twenty-four
hours."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand, it is undoubtedly Miss Cresswell's
handwriting."</p>

<p>"And 'Belocity' is as undoubtedly your telegraphic address.
This paper," he went on, "was taken from a drunken
tramp&mdash;'hobo' you call 'em, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At Kingston-on-Thames," said McNorton&mdash;"the man was
picked up in the street, fighting drunk, and taken to the police
station, where he developed delirium tremens. Apparently he has
been on the jag all the week, and to-day's booze finished him
off. The local inspector in searching him found this piece of
paper in his pocket and connected it with the disappearance of
Miss Cresswell, the matter being fresh in his mind, as only this
morning we had circulated a new description throughout the home
counties. He got me on the 'phone and sent a constable up to
town with the paper this afternoon."</p>

<p>"H'm," said Beale, biting his lips thoughtfully, "she
evidently gave the man the telegram, telling him to dispatch it.
She probably gave him money, too, which was the explanation of
his final drunk."</p>

<p>"I don't think that is the case," said McNorton, "he had one
lucid moment at the station when he was cross-examined as to
where he got the money to get drunk, and he affirmed that he
found it wrapped up in a piece of paper. That sounds true to me.
She either dropped it from a car or threw it from a house."</p>

<p>"Is the man very ill?"</p>

<p>"Pretty bad," said the other, " you will get nothing out of
him before the morning. The doctors had to dope him to get him
quiet, and he will be some time before he is right."</p>

<p>He looked up at the other occupant of the room.</p>

<p>"Well, Parson, you are helping Mr. Beale, I understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other easily.</p>

<p>"Returning to your old profession, I see," said McNorton.</p>

<p>Parson Homo drew himself up a little stiffly.</p>

<p>"If you have anything against me you can pull me for it," he
said insolently: "that's your business. As to the profession I
followed before I started on that career of crime which brought
me into contact with the crude representatives of what is
amusingly called 'the law,' is entirely my affair."</p>

<p>"Don't get your wool off. Parson," said the other
good-humouredly. "You have lost your sense of humour."</p>

<p>"That's where you are wrong," said Homo coolly: "I have
merely lost my sense of decency."</p>

<p>McNorton turned to the other.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"'I am imprisoned at Deans,'" repeated Beale. "What 'Deans'
have you in this country?"</p>

<p>"There are a dozen of them," replied the police chief:
"there's Deansgate in Manchester, Deanston in Perth, Deansboro',
Deans Abbey&mdash;I've been looking them up, there is a whole
crowd of them."</p>

<p>"Are there any 'Deans' near Kingston?"</p>

<p>"None," replied the other.</p>

<p>"Then it is obviously the name of a house," said Beale. "I
have noticed that in England you are in the habit of naming
rather than numbering your houses, especially in the suburbs."
He looked across to Parson Homo, "Can you help?"</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"If I were a vulgar burglar I might assist you," he said,
"but my branch of the profession does not take me to the
suburbs."</p>

<p>"We will get a Kingston Directory and go through it," said
McNorton; "we have one on the file at Scotland Yard.
If&mdash;"</p>

<p>Beale suddenly raised his hand to enjoin silence: he had
heard a familiar step in the corridor outside. "That's van
Heerden," he said in a low voice, "he has been out all the
morning."</p>

<p>"Has he been shadowed?" asked McNorton in the same tone.</p>

<p>"My man lost him," he said.</p>

<p>He tiptoed along the passage and stood listening behind the
door. Presently he heard the doctor's door close and came
back.</p>

<p>"I have had the best sleuth in America trailing him," he
said, "and he has slipped him every time."</p>

<p>"Anyway," said McNorton, "this telegram disposes of the idea
that she has gone to Liverpool. It also settles the question as
to whether she went of her own free will. If his name were on
that telegram," he said thoughtfully, "I would take a risk and
pull him in."</p>

<p>"I will give you something bigger to pull him for," Beale
said, "once I have placed Miss Cresswell in safety."</p>

<p>"The Green Rust?" smiled the police chief.</p>

<p>"The Green Rust," said Beale, but he did not smile, "that's
van Heerden's big game. The abduction of Miss Cresswell is
merely a means to an end. He wants her money and may want it
very badly. The more urgent is his need the sooner that marriage
takes place."</p>

<p>"But there is no clergyman in England who would marry them
"&mdash;it was Homo who interrupted. "My dear friend, that sort
of thing is not done except in story books. If the woman refuses
her consent the marriage cannot possibly occur. As I understand,
the lady is not likely to be cowed."</p>

<p>"That is what I am afraid of," said Beale, "she is all
pluck&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, for he had heard the doctor's door close. In
three strides he had crossed the hallway and was in the
corridor, confronting his suave neighbour. Dr. van Heerden,
carefully attired, was pulling on his gloves and smiled into the
stem face of his rival.</p>

<p>"Well," he asked pleasantly, "any news of Miss Cresswell?"</p>

<p>"If I had any news of Miss Cresswell you would not be here,"
said Beale.</p>

<p>"But how interesting," drawled the doctor. "Where should I
be?"</p>

<p>"You would be under lock and key, my friend," said Beale.</p>

<p>The doctor threw back his head and laughed softly. "What a
lover!" he said, "and how reluctant to accept his dismissal! It
may ease your mind to know that Miss Cresswell, whom I hope very
soon to call Mrs. van Heerden, is perfectly happy, and is very
annoyed at your persistence. I had a telegram from her this
morning, begging me to come to Liverpool at the earliest
opportunity."</p>

<p>"That's a lie," said Beale quietly, "but one lie more or
less, I suppose, doesn't count."</p>

<p>"A thoroughly immoral view to take," said the doctor with
much severity, "but I see there is nothing to be gained by
arguing with you, and I can only make one request."</p>

<p>Beale said nothing but stood waiting. "It is this," said the
doctor, choosing his words with great care: "that you call off
the gentleman who has been dogging my footsteps to-day. It was
amusing at first but now it is becoming annoying. Some of my
patients have complained of this man watching their houses."</p>

<p>"You've not seen a patient to-day, van Heerden," said Beale,
"and, anyway, I guess you had better get used to being shadowed.
It isn't your first experience."</p>

<p>The doctor looked at him under lowered lids and smiled
again.</p>

<p>"I could save your man a great deal of trouble," he said,
"and myself considerable exertion by giving him a list of the
places where I intend calling."</p>

<p>"He will find that out for himself," said Beale.</p>

<p>"I wish him greater success than be has had," replied the
other, and passed on, descending the stairs slowly.</p>

<p>Beale went back to his flat, passed to his bedroom and looked
down into the street. He made a signal to a man at the corner
and received an almost imperceptible answer. Then he returned to
the two men.</p>

<p>"This fellow is too clever for us, I am afraid, and London
with its tubes, its underground stations and taxi-cabs is a
pretty difficult proposition."</p>

<p>"I suppose your man lost him in the tube," said McNorton.</p>

<p>"There are two ways down, the elevator and the stairs, and it
is mighty difficult to follow a man unless you know which way he
is going."</p>

<p>"But you were interrupted at an interesting moment. What are
you going to tell us about the Green Rust?"</p>

<p>"I can only tell you this," said Beale, "that the Green Rust
is the greatest conspiracy against the civilized world that has
ever been hatched."</p>

<p>He looked sharply at Homo.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me," said the Parson, "I know nothing about
it, unless&mdash;" He stopped and frowned. "The Green Rust," he
repeated, "is that old man Heyler's secret?"</p>

<p>"He's in it," said Beale shortly.</p>

<p>"Is it a swindle of some kind?" asked the Parson curiously.
"It never struck me that Heyler was that kind of man."</p>

<p>"There is no swindle in it so far as Heyler's concerned,"
said Beale, "it is something bigger than a swindle."</p>

<p>A telephone bell rang and he took up the receiver and
listened, only interjecting a query or two. Then he hung up the
instrument.</p>

<p>"It is as I thought," he said: "the doctor's slipped again.
Had a car waiting for him in Oxford Street and when he saw there
were no taxi-cabs about, jumped in and was driven
eastward."</p>

<p>"Did you get the number of the car?" asked McNorton.</p>

<p>Beale smiled.</p>

<p>"That's not much use," he said. "He's probably got two or
three number-plates."</p>

<p>He looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I'll go along to Kingston," he said.</p>

<p>"I shan't be able to come with you," said McNorton, "I have a
meeting with the commissioner at five."</p>

<p>"Before you go," remarked Beale, "you might put your
signature to this declaration of my bona fides."</p>

<p>He laid on the table a blue foolscap blank.</p>

<p>"What's this?" asked the surprised McNorton, "an application
for a special licence&mdash;are you going to be married?"</p>

<p>"I hope so," said the other cautiously.</p>

<p>"You don't seem very cheerful about it. I presume you want me
to testify to the urgency of the case. I am probably perjuring
myself." He signed his name with a flourish. "When are you
getting the licence and what's the hurry?"</p>

<p>"I am getting the licence to-morrow," said Beale.</p>

<p>"And the lady's name is&mdash;?</p>

<p>"I thought you had noticed it," smiled the other, deftly
blotting and folding the form.</p>

<p>"Not Miss Cresswell?" demanded the police chief in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Miss Cresswell it is."</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are circumstances which may be brought to your
official notice, McNorton," said the detective, "for the present
it is necessary to keep my plan a secret."</p>

<p>"Has it anything to do with the Green Rust?" asked the other
jokingly.</p>

<p>"A great deal to do with the Green Rust."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll get along," said McNorton. "I will telephone the
Kingston police to give you all the assistance possible, but I
am afraid you will learn nothing from the tramp till the
morning, and perhaps not then."</p>

<p>He took his leave soon after.</p>

<p>"Now, Homo, it is up to you and me," said Beale. "You will
have to keep close to me after to-morrow. Make yourself at home
here until I come back."</p>

<p>"One moment," said Homo, as Beale rose and gathered up his
hat and gloves to depart. "Before you go I want you to
understand clearly that I am taking on this job because it
offers me a chance that I haven't had since I fell from grace,
if you will excuse the cliche."</p>

<p>"That I understand," said Beale.</p>

<p>"I may be doing you a very bad turn."</p>

<p>"I'll take that risk," said Beale.</p>

<p>"On your own head be it," said Homo, his hard face creased in
a fleeting smile.</p>

<p>Beale's car was waiting, but his departure was unexpectedly
decayed. As he passed down the stairs into the vestibule he saw
a stranger standing near the door reading the enamelled
name-plates affixed to the wall. Something in his appearance
arrested Beale. The man was well dressed in the sense that his
clothes were new and well cut, but the pattern of the cloth, no
less than the startling yellowness of the boots and that
unmistakable sign-manual of the foreigner, the shape and colour
of the cravat, stamped him as being neither American nor
British.</p>

<p>"Can I be of any assistance?" asked Beale. "Are you looking
for somebody?"</p>

<p>The visitor turned a pink face to him. "You are very good,"
he said with the faint trace of an accent. "I understand that
Doctor van Heerden lives here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he lives here," said Beale, "but I am afraid he is not
at home."</p>

<p>He thought it might be a patient or a summons to a
patient.</p>

<p>"Not at home?" The man's face fell. "But how unfortunate!
Could you tell me where I can find him, my business is immediate
and I have come a long way."</p>

<p>From Germany, guessed Beale. The mail train was due at
Charing Cross half an hour before.</p>

<p>"I am a friend of Doctor van Heerden and possibly I can
assist you. Is the business very important? Does it concern," he
hesitated, "the Green Rust?"</p>

<p>He spoke the last sentence in German and the man started and
looked at him with mingled suspicion and uncertainty.</p>

<p>"It is a matter of the greatest importance." he repeated, "it
is of vital importance." He spoke in German.</p>

<p>"About the Green Rust?" asked Beale, in the same
language.</p>

<p>"I do not know anything of the Green Rust," said the man
hurriedly. "I am merely the bearer of a communication which is
of the greatest importance." He repeated the words&mdash;"the
greatest importance."</p>

<p>"If you give me the letter," said Beale, "I will see that it
is sent on to him," and he held out his hand with the assurance
of one who shared the dearest secrets of the doctor. The
stranger's hand wandered to his breast pocket, but came back
empty.</p>

<p>"No, it must be given&mdash;I must see the doctor himself,"
he said. "He does not expect me and I will wait."</p>

<p>Beale thought quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you will come upstairs to my flat and wait,"
he said genially, and led the way, and the man, still showing
evidence of uneasiness, was ushered into his room, where the
sight of the Rev. Parson Homo tended to reassure him.</p>

<p>Would he have tea? He would not have tea. Would he take
coffee? He would not take coffee. A glass of wine perhaps? No,
he did not drink wine nor beer, nor would he take any
refreshment whatever.</p>

<p>"My man," thought the desperate Beale, "I either chloroform
you or hit you on the head with the poker, but I am going to see
that letter."</p>

<p>As if divining his thought, but placing thereon a wrong
construction, the man said: "I should avail myself of your
kindness to deliver my letter to Doctor van Heerden, but of what
service would it be since it is only a letter introducing me to
the good doctor?"</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all?" said Beale, disappointed, and somehow he
knew the man spoke the truth.</p>

<p>"That is all," he said, "except of course my message, which
is verbal. My name is Stardt, you may have heard the doctor
speak of me. We have had some correspondence."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I remember," lied Beale.</p>

<p>"The message is for him alone, of course, as you will
understand, and if I deliver it to you," smiled Herr Stardt.
"you should not understand it, because it is one word."</p>

<p>"One word?" said Beale blankly.</p>

<p>"A code&mdash;hang!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16">XVI. &mdash; THE PAWN
TICKET</a></h2>

<p class="first">OLIVA CRESSWELL awoke to consciousness as she
was being carried up the stairs of the house. She may have
recovered sooner, for she retained a confused impression of
being laid down amidst waving grasses and of hearing somebody
grunt that she was heavier than he thought.</p>

<p>Also she remembered as dimly the presence of Dr. van Heerden
standing over her, and he was wearing a long grey dust-coat.</p>

<p>As her captor kicked open the door of her room she scrambled
out of his arms and leant against the bed-rail for support.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," she said breathlessly, "it was foolish, to
faint, but&mdash;but you frightened me."</p>

<p>The man grinned, and seemed about to speak, but a sharp voice
from the landing called him, and he went out, slamming the door
behind him. She crossed to the bathroom, bathed her face in cold
water and felt better, though she was still a little giddy.</p>

<p>Then she sat down to review the situation, and in that review
two figures came alternately into prominence&mdash;van Heerden
and Beale.</p>

<p>She was an eminently sane girl. She had had the beginnings of
what might have been an unusually fine education, had it not
been interrupted by the death of her foster-mother. She had,
too, the advantage which the finished young lady does not
possess, of having grafted to the wisdom of the schools the sure
understanding of men and things which personal contact with
struggling humanity can alone give to us.</p>

<p>The great problems of life had been sprung upon her with all
their hideous realism, and through all she had retained her
poise and her dear vision. Many of the phenomena represented by
man's attitude to woman she could understand, but that a man who
admittedly did not love her and had no other apparent desire
than to rid himself of the incubus of a wife as soon as he was
wed, should wish to marry her was incomprehensible. That he had
already published the banns of her marriage left her gasping at
his audacity. Strange how her thoughts leapt all the events of
the morning: the wild rush to escape, the struggle with the
hideously masked man, and all that went before or followed, and
went back to the night before.</p>

<p>Somehow she knew that van Heerden had told her the truth, and
that there was behind this act of his a deeper significance than
she could grasp. She remembered what he had said about Beale,
and flushed.</p>

<p>"You're silly, Matilda," she said to herself, employing the
term of address which she reserved for moments of
self-deprecation, "here is a young man you have only met half a
dozen times, who is probably a very nice married policeman with
a growing family and you are going hot and cold at the
suggestion that you're in love with him." She shook her head
reproachfully.</p>

<p>And yet upon Beale all her thoughts were centred, and however
they might wander it was to Beale they returned. She could
analyse that buoyancy which had asserted itself, that confidence
which had suddenly become a mental armour, which repelled every
terrifying thought, to this faith she had in a man, who a few
weeks before she had looked upon as an incorrigible
drunkard.</p>

<p>She had time for thought, and really, though this she did not
acknowledge, she desperately needed the occupation of that
thought. What was Beale's business? Why did he employ her to
copy out this list of American and Canadian statistics? Why did
he want to know all these hotels, their proprietors, the chief
of the police and the like? She wished she had her papers and
books so that she might go on extracting that interminable
list.</p>

<p>What would van Heerden do now? Would her attempted escape
change his plans? How would he overcome the difficulty of
marrying a girl who was certain to denounce him in the presence
of so independent a witness as a clergyman? She would die before
she married him, she told herself.</p>

<p>She could not rest, and walked about the room examining the
framed prints and looking at the books, and occasionally walking
to the glass above the dressing-chest to see if any sign was
left of the red mark on her cheek where van Heerden's hand had
fallen. This exercise gave her a curious satisfaction, and when
she saw that the mark had subsided and was blending more to the
colour of her skin she felt disappointed. Startled, she analysed
this curious mental attitude and again came to Beale. She wanted
Beale to see the place. She wanted Beale's sympathy. She wanted
Beale's rage&mdash;she was sure he would rage.</p>

<p>She laughed to herself and for want of other and better
amusement walked to the drawers in the dressing-bureau and
examined their contents. They were empty and unlocked save one,
which refused to respond to her tug. She remembered she had a
small bunch of keys in her bag.</p>

<p>"I am going to be impertinent. Forgive the liberty," she
said, as she felt the lock give to the first attempt.</p>

<p>She pulled the drawer open. It contained a few articles of
feminine attire and a thick black leather portfolio. She lifted
this out, laid it on the table and opened it. It was filled with
foolscap. Written on the cover was the word "Argentine" and
somehow the writing was familiar to her. It was a bold hand,
obviously feminine.</p>

<p>"Where have I seen that before?" she asked, and knit her
forehead.</p>

<p>She turned the first leaf and read: "Alsigar Hotel, Foumos,
Proprietor, Miguel Porcorini Index 2."</p>

<p>Her mouth opened in astonishment and she ran down the list.
She took out another folder. It was marked "Canada," and she
turned the leaves rapidly. She recognized this work. It was the
same work that Beale had given to her, a list of the hotels,
their proprietors and means of conveyance, but there was no
reference to the police. And then it dawned upon her. An
unusually long description produced certain characteristics of
writing which she recognized.</p>

<p>"Hilda Glaum!" she said. "I wonder what this means!"</p>

<p>She examined the contents of the drawer again and some of
them puzzled her. Not the little stack of handkerchiefs, the
folded collars and the like. If Hilda Glaum was in the habit of
visiting Deans Folly and used this room it was natural that
these things should be here. If this were her bureau the little
carton of nibs and the spare note book were to be expected. It
was the steel box which set her wondering. This she discovered
in the far corner of the drawer. If she could have imagined
anything so fantastic she might have believed that the box had
been specially made to hold the thing it contained and preserve
it from the dangers of fire. The lid, which closed with a spring
catch, released by the pressure of a tiny button, was perfectly
fitted so that the box was in all probability air-tight.</p>

<p>She opened it without difficulty. The sides were lined with
what seemed to be at first sight thick cardboard but which
proved on closer inspection to be asbestos. She opened it with a
sense of eager anticipation, but her face fell. Save for a tiny
square blue envelope at the bottom, the box was empty!</p>

<p>She lifted it in her hand to shake out the envelope and it
was then that the idea occurred to her that the box had been
made for the envelope, which refused to budge until she lifted
one end with a hairpin.</p>

<p>It was unsealed, and she slipped in her finger and pulled out
&mdash;a pawn ticket!</p>

<p>She had an inclination to laugh which she checked. She
examined the ticket curiously. It announced the fact that
Messrs. Rosenblaum Bros., of Commercial Road, London, had
advanced ten shillings on a "Gents' Silver Hunter Watch," and
the pledge had been made in the name of van Heerden!</p>

<p>She gazed at it bewildered. He was not a man who needed ten
shillings or ten dollars or ten pounds. Why should he pledge a
watch and why having pledged it should he keep the ticket with
such care?</p>

<p>Oliva hesitated a moment, then slipped the ticket from its
cover, put back the envelope at the bottom of the box and closed
the lid. She found a hiding-place for the little square
pasteboard before she returned the box and portfolio to the
drawer and locked it.</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door and hastily she replaced the key
in her bag.</p>

<p>"Come in," she said.</p>

<p>She recognized the man who stood in the doorway as he who had
carried her back to the room.</p>

<p>There was a strangeness in his bearing which made her uneasy,
a certain subdued hilarity which suggested drunkenness.</p>

<p>"Don't make a noise," he whispered with a stifled chuckle,
"if Gregory hears he'll raise fire."</p>

<p>She saw that the key was in the lock on the outside of the
door and this she watched. But he made no attempt to withdraw it
and closed the door behind him softly.</p>

<p>"My name is Bridgers," he whispered, "van Heerden has told
you about me&mdash;Horace Bridgers, do you&mdash;?" He took a
little tortoiseshell box from the pocket of his frayed waistcoat
and opened it with a little kick of his middle finger. It was
half-full of white powder that glittered in a stray ray of
sunlight. "Try a sniff," he begged eagerly, "and all your
troubles will go&mdash;phutt!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, no "&mdash;she shook her head, looking at him
with a perplexed smile&mdash;"I don't know what it is."</p>

<p>"It's the white terror," he chuckled again, "better than the
green&mdash;not so horribly musty as the green, eh?"</p>

<p>"I'm not in the mood for terrors of any kind," she said, with
a half-smile. She wondered why he had come, and had a momentary
hope that he was ignorant of van Heerden's character.</p>

<p>"All right"&mdash;he stuffed the box back into his waistcoat
pocket&mdash;"you're the loser, you'll never find heaven on
earth!"</p>

<p>She waited.</p>

<p>All the time he was speaking, it seemed to her that he was on
the qui vive for some interruption from below. He would stop in
his speech to turn a listening ear to the door. Moreover, she
was relieved to see he made no attempt to advance any farther
into the room. That he was under the influence of some drug she
guessed. His eyes glittered with unnatural brilliance, his
hands, discoloured uncleanly, moved nervously and were never
still.</p>

<p>"I'm Bridgers," he said again. "I'm van Heerden's best
man&mdash;rather a come down for the best analytical chemist
that the school ever turned out, eh? Doing odd jobs for a dirty
Deutscher!" He walked to the door, opened it and listened, then
tiptoed across the room to her.</p>

<p>"You know," he whispered, "you're van Heerden's
girl&mdash;what is the game?"</p>

<p>"What is&mdash;? she stammered.</p>

<p>"What is the game? What is it all about? I've tried to pump
Gregory and Milsom, but they're mysterious. Curse all mysteries,
my dear. What is the game? Why are they sending men to America,
Canada, Australia and India? Come along and be a pal! Tell me!
I've seen the office, I know all about it. Thousands of sealed
envelopes filled with steamship tickets and money. Thousands of
telegraph forms already addressed. You don't fool me!" He hissed
the last words almost in her face. "Why is he employing the
crocks and the throw-outs of science? Perrilli, Maxon, Boyd
Heyler&mdash;and me? If the game's square why doesn't he take
the new men from the schools?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, being, by now, less interested in such
revelations as he might make, than in her own personal comfort.
For his attitude was grown menacing... then the great idea came
to her. Evidently this man knew nothing of the circumstances
under which she had come to the house. To him she was a wilful
but willing assistant of the doctor, who for some reason or
other it had been necessary to place under restraint.</p>

<p>"I will tell you everything if you will take me back to my
home," she said. "I cannot give you proofs here."</p>

<p>She saw suspicion gather in his eyes. Then he laughed.</p>

<p>"That won't wash," he sneered&mdash;"you know it all. I can't
leave here," he said; "besides, you told me last time that there
was nothing. I used to watch you working away at night," he went
on to the girl's amazement. "I've sat looking at you for hours,
writing and writing and writing."</p>

<p>She understood now. She and Hilda Glaum were of about the
same build, and she was mistaken for Hilda by this bemused man
who had, in all probability, never seen the other girl face to
face.</p>

<p>"What made you run away?" he asked suddenly; but with a
sudden resolve she brought him back to the subject he had
started to discuss.</p>

<p>"What is the use of my telling you?" she asked. "You know as
much as I."</p>

<p>"Only bits," he replied eagerly, "but I don't know van
Heerden's game. I know why he's marrying this other girl,
everybody knows that. When is the wedding?"</p>

<p>"What other girl?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Cresswell or Predeaux, whatever she calls herself," said
Bridgers carelessly. "She was a store girl, wasn't she?"</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;she tried to speak calmly&mdash;"why do you think
he wants to marry her?"</p>

<p>He laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," he said, "you can't fool me. Everybody
knows she's worth a million."</p>

<p>"Worth a million?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Worth a million." He smacked his lips and fumbled for the
little box in his waistcoat pocket. "Try a sniff&mdash;you'll
know what it feels like to be old man Millinborn's heiress."</p>

<p>There was a sound in the hall below and he turned with an
exaggerated start (she thought it theatrical but could not know
of the jangled nerves of the drug-soddened man which magnified
all sound to an intensity which was almost painful).</p>

<p>He opened the door and slid out&mdash;and did not close the
door behind him.</p>

<p>Swiftly she followed, and as she reached the landing saw his
head disappear down the stairs. She was in a blind panic; a
thousand formless terrors gripped her and turned her resolute
soul to water. She could have screamed her relief when she saw
that the sliding door was half-open&mdash;the man had not
stopped to close it&mdash;and she passed through and down the
first flight. He had vanished before she reached the half-way
landing and the hall below was empty. It was a wide hall,
stone-flagged, with a glass door between her and the open
portal.</p>

<p>She flew down the stairs, pulled open the door and ran
straight into van Heerden's arms.</p>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17">XVII. &mdash; THE JEW OF
CRACOW</a></h2>

<p class="first">IF there were committed in London the crime of
the century&mdash;a crime so tremendous that the names of the
chief actors in this grisly drama were on the lips of every man,
woman and talkative child in Europe&mdash;you might walk into a
certain department of Scotland Yard with the assurance that you
would not meet within the confining walls of that bureau any
police officer who was interested in the slightest, or who,
indeed, had even heard of the occurrence save by accident. This
department is known as the Parley Voos or P.V. Department, and
concerns itself only in suspicious events beyond the territorial
waters of Great Britain and Ireland. Its body is on the Thames
Embankment, but its soul is at the Central Office, or at the
Surete or even at the Yamen of the police minister of Pekin.</p>

<p>It is sublimely ignorant of the masters of crime who dwell
beneath the shadows of the Yard, but it could tell you, without
stopping to look up reference, not only the names of the known
gunmen of New York, but the composition of almost every secret
society in China.</p>

<p>A Pole had a quarrel with a Jew in the streets of Cracow, and
they quarrelled over the only matter which is worthy of quarrel
in that part of Poland. The sum in dispute was the comparatively
paltry one of 260 Kronen, but when the Jew was taken in a dying
condition to the hospital he made a statement which was so
curious that the Chief of Police in Cracow sent it on to Vienna
and Vienna sent it to Berne and Berne scratched its chin
thoughtfully and sent it forward to Paris, where it was
distributed to Rio de Janeiro, New York, and London.</p>

<p>The Assistant Chief of the P.V. Department came out of his
room and drifted aimlessly into the uncomfortable bureau of Mr.
McNorton.</p>

<p>"There's a curious yarn through from Cracow," he said, "which
might interest your friend Beale."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked McNorton, who invariably found the
stories of the P.V. Department fascinating but profitless.</p>

<p>"A man was murdered," said the P.V. man lightly, as though
that were the least important feature of the story, "but before
he pegged out he made a will or an assignment of his property to
his son, in the course of which he said that none of his
stocks&mdash;he was a corn factor&mdash;were to be sold under
one thousand Kronen a bushel. That's about 30."</p>

<p>"Corn at 30 a bushel?" said McNorton. "Was he delirious?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the other. "He was a very well-known man
in Cracow, one Zibowski, who during the late war was principal
buying agent for the German Government. The Chief of the Police
at Cracow apparently asked him if he wasn't suffering from
illusions, and the man then made a statement that the German
Government had an option on all the grain in Galicia, Hungary
and the Ukraine at a lower price. Zibowski held out for better
terms. It is believed that he was working with a member of the
German Government who made a fortune in the war out of army
contracts. In fact, he as good as let this out just before he
died, when he spoke in his delirium of a wonderful invention
which was being worked on behalf of the German Government, an
invention called the Green Rust."</p>

<p>McNorton whistled.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" he said.</p>

<p>"That's all," said the P.V. man. "I seem to remember that
Beale had made one or two mysterious references to the Rust.
Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"He left town last night," replied McNorton.</p>

<p>"Can you get in touch with him?"</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are sending on a copy of this communication to
the Cabinet," he said&mdash;"it may be rather serious. Whatever
the scheme is, it is being worked in London, and van Heerden is
the chief operator."</p>

<p>He took down his hat and went out in search of Kitson, whom
he found in the lobby of the hotel. James Kitson came toward him
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Have you news of Beale?"</p>

<p>"He was at Kingston this morning," said McNorton, "with
Parson Homo, but he had left. I was on the 'phone to the
inspector at Kingston, who did not know very much and could give
me no very definite news as to whether Beale had made his
discovery. He interviewed the tramp early this morning, but
apparently extracted very little that was helpful. As a matter
of fact, I came to you to ask if he had got in touch with
you."</p>

<p>Kitson shook his head.</p>

<p>"I want to see him about his Green Rust scare&mdash;Beale has
gone single-handed into this matter," said the superintendent,
shaking his head, "and he has played the lone game a little too
long."</p>

<p>"Is it very serious?"</p>

<p>"It may be an international matter," replied McNorton
gravely, "all that we know at present is this. A big plot is on
foot to tamper with the food supplies of the world and the chief
plotter is van Heerden. Beale knows more about the matter than
any of us, but he only gives us occasional glimpses of the real
situation. I have been digging out van Heerden's record without,
however, finding anything very incriminating. Up to a point he
seems to have been a model citizen, though his associates were
not always of the best. He has been seen in the company of at
least three people with a bad history. Milsom, a doctor,
convicted of murder in the 'nineties; Bridgers, an American
chemist with two convictions for illicit trading in drugs;
Gregory&mdash;who seems to be his factotum and general
assistant, convicted in Manchester for saccharine smuggling; and
a girl called Glaum, who is an alien, charged during the war for
failing to register."</p>

<p>"But against van Heerden?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. He has travelled a great deal in America and on the
Continent. He was in Spain a few years ago and was suspected of
being associated with the German Embassy. His association with
the Millinborn murder you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that," said James Kitson bitterly.</p>

<p>"Beale will have to tell us all he knows," McNorton went on,
"and probably we can tell him something he doesn't know; namely,
that van Heerden conducts a pretty expensive correspondence by
cable with all parts of the world. Something has happened in
Cracow which gives a value to all Beale's suspicions."</p>

<p>Briefly he related the gist of the story which had reached
him that morning.</p>

<p>"It is incredible," said Kitson when the chief had finished.
"It would be humanly impossible for the world to buy at that
price. And there is no reason for it. It happens that I am
interested in a milling corporation and I know that the world's
crops are good&mdash;in fact, the harvest will be well above the
average. I should say that the Cracow Jew was talking in
delirium."</p>

<p>But McNorton smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>"I hope you're right," he said. "I hope the whole thing is a
mare's nest and for once in my life I trust that the police
clues are as wrong as hell. But, anyway, van Heerden is cabling
mighty freely&mdash;and I want Beale!"</p>

<p>But Beale was unreachable. A visit to his apartment produced
no results. The "foreign gentleman" who on the previous day had
called on van Heerden had been seen there that morning, but he,
too, had vanished, and none of McNorton's watchers had been able
to pick him up.</p>

<p>McNorton shifted the direction of his search and dropped into
the palatial establishment of Punsonby's. He strolled past the
grill-hidden desk which had once held Oliva Cresswell, and saw
out of the tail of his eye a stranger in her place and by her
side the darkly taciturn Hilda Glaum.</p>

<p>Mr. White, that pompous man, greeted him strangely. As the
police chief came into the private office Mr. White half-rose,
turned deadly pale and became of a sudden bereft of speech.
McNorton recognized the symptoms from long acquaintance with the
characteristics of detected criminals, and wondered how deeply
this pompous man was committed to whatever scheme was
hatching.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;Mr. McNorton!" stammered White, shaking
like a leaf, "won't you sit down, please? To what&mdash;to
what," he swallowed twice before he could get the words out, "to
what am I indebted?"</p>

<p>"Just called in to look you up," said McNorton genially.
"Have you been losing any more&mdash;registered letters
lately?"</p>

<p>Mr. White subsided again into his chair.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;no, I mean," he said,
"no&mdash;ah&mdash;thank you. It was kind of you to call,
inspector&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Superintendent," corrected the other good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons, superintendent," said Mr. White hastily,
"no, sir, nothing so unfortunate."</p>

<p>He shot a look half-fearful, half-resentful at the police
officer.</p>

<p>"And how is your friend Doctor van Heerden?"</p>

<p>Mr. White twisted uncomfortably in his chair. Again his look
of nervousness and apprehension.</p>

<p>"Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;van Heerden is not a friend of mine," he
said, "a business acquaintance," he sighed heavily, "just a
business acquaintance."</p>

<p>The White he had known was not the White of to-day. The man
looked older, his face was more heavily lined and his eyes were
dark with weariness.</p>

<p>"I suppose he's a pretty shrewd fellow," he remarked
carelessly. "You are interested in some of his concerns, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Only one, only one," replied White sharply, "and I wish to
Heaven&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped himself.</p>

<p>"And you wish you weren't, eh?"</p>

<p>Again the older man wriggled in his chair.</p>

<p>"Doctor van Heerden is very clever," he said; "he has great
schemes, in one of which I am&mdash;ah&mdash;financially
interested, That is all&mdash;I have put money into
his&mdash;ah&mdash;syndicate, without, of course, knowing the
nature of the work which is being carried out. That I would
impress upon you."</p>

<p>"You are a trusting investor," said the good-humoured
McNorton.</p>

<p>"I am a child in matters of finance," admitted Mr. White, but
added quickly, "except, of course, in so far as the finance of
Punsonby's, which is one of the soundest business concerns in
London, Mr. McNorton. We pay our dividends regularly and our
balance sheets are a model for the industrial world."</p>

<p>"So I have heard," said McNorton dryly. "I am interested in
syndicates, too. By the way, what is Doctor van Heerden's
scheme?"</p>

<p>Mr. White shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea," he confessed with a
melancholy smile. "I suppose it is very foolish of me, but I
have such faith in the doctor's genius that when he came to me
and said: 'My dear White, I want you to invest a few thousand in
one of my concerns,' I said: 'My dear doctor, here is my cheque,
don't bother me about the details but send in my dividends
regularly.' Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>His laugh was hollow, and would not have deceived a child of
ten.</p>

<p>"So you invested &pound;40,000&mdash;" began McNorton.</p>

<p>"Forty thousand!" gasped Mr. White, "how did you know?"</p>

<p>He went a trifle paler.</p>

<p>"These things get about," said McNorton, "as I was going to
say, you invested &pound;40,000 without troubling to discover
what sort of work the syndicate was undertaking. I am not
speaking now as a police officer, Mr. White," he went on, and
White did not disguise his relief, "but as an old acquaintance
of yours."</p>

<p>"Say friend," said the fervent Mr. White. "I have always
regarded you, Mr. McNorton, as a friend of mine. Let me see, how
long have we known one another? I think the first time we met
was when Punsonby's was burgled in '93."</p>

<p>"It's a long time," said McNorton; "but don't let us get off
the subject of your investment, which interests me as a friend.
You gave Doctor van Heerden all this money without even
troubling to discover whether his enterprise was a legal one. I
am not suggesting it was illegal," he said, as White opened his
mouth to protest, "but it seems strange that you did not trouble
to inquire."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I inquired, naturally I inquired, Mr.
McNorton," said White eagerly, "it was for some chemical process
and I know nothing about chemistry. I don't mind admitting to
you," he lowered his voice, though there was no necessity, "that
I regret my investment very much. We business men have many
calls. We cannot allow our money to be tied up for too long a
time, and it happens&mdash;ah&mdash;that just at this moment I
should be very glad, very glad indeed, to liquidate that
investment."</p>

<p>McNorton nodded. He knew a great deal more about White's
financial embarrassments than that gentleman gave him credit
for. He knew, for example, that the immaculate managing director
of Punsonby's was in the hands of moneylenders, and that those
moneylenders were squeezing him. He suspected that all was not
well with Punsonby's. There had been curious rumours in the City
amongst the bill discounters that Punsonby's "paper" left much
to be desired.</p>

<p>"Do you know the nationality of van Heerden?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Dutch," replied Mr. White promptly.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of this?"</p>

<p>"I would stake my life on it," answered the heroic Mr.
White.</p>

<p>"As I came through to your office I saw a young lady at the
cashier's desk&mdash;Miss Glaum, I think her name is. Is she
Dutch, too?"</p>

<p>"Miss Glaum&mdash;ah&mdash;well Miss Glaum." White hesitated.
"A very nice, industrious girl, and a friend of Doctor van
Heerden's. As a matter of fact, I engaged her at his
recommendation. You see, I was under an obligation to the
doctor. He had&mdash;ah&mdash;attended me in my illness."</p>

<p>That this was untrue McNorton knew. White was one of those
financial shuttlecocks which shrewd moneylenders toss from one
to the other. White had been introduced by van Heerden to
capital in a moment of hectic despair and had responded when his
financial horizon was clearer by pledging his credit for the
furtherance of van Heerden's scheme.</p>

<p>"Of course you know that as a shareholder in van Heerden's
syndicate you cannot escape responsibility for the purposes to
which your money is put," he said, as he rose to go. "I hope you
get your money back."</p>

<p>"Do you think there is any doubt?" demanded White, in
consternation.</p>

<p>"There is always a doubt about getting money back from
syndicates," said McNorton cryptically.</p>

<p>"Please don't go yet." Mr. White passed round the end of his
desk and intercepted the detective with unexpected agility,
taking, so to speak, the door out of his hands and closing it.
"I am alarmed, Mr. McNorton," he said, as he led the other back
to his chair, "I won't disguise it. I am seriously alarmed by
what you have said. It is not the thought of losing the money,
oh dear, no. Punsonby's would not be ruined by&mdash;ah&mdash;a
paltry &pound;40,000. It is, if I may be allowed to say so, the
sinister suggestion in your speech,
inspector&mdash;superintendent I mean. Is it possible,"&mdash;he
stood squarely in front of McNorton, his hands on his hips, his
eyeglass dangling from his fastidious fingers and his head
pulled back as though he wished to avoid contact with the
possibility, "is it possible that in my ignorance I have been
assisting to finance a scheme which is&mdash;ah&mdash;illegal,
immoral, improper and contrary&mdash;ah&mdash;to the best
interests of the common weal?"</p>

<p>He shook his head as though he were unable to believe his own
words.</p>

<p>"Everything is possible in finance," said McNorton with a
smile. "I am not saying that Doctor van Heerden's syndicate is
an iniquitous one, I have not even seen a copy of his articles
of association. Doubtless you could oblige me in that
respect."</p>

<p>"I haven't got such a thing," denied Mr. White vigorously,
"the syndicate was not registered. It was, so to speak, a
private concern."</p>

<p>"But the exploitation of Green Rust?" suggested the
superintendent, and the man's face lost the last vestige of
colour it possessed.</p>

<p>"The Green Rust?" he faltered. "I have heard the phrase. I
know nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know nothing, but suspect the worst," said McNorton.
"Now I am going to speak plainly to you. The reason you know
nothing about this syndicate of van Heerden's is because you had
a suspicion that it was being formed for an illegal
purpose&mdash;please don't interrupt me&mdash;you know nothing
because you did not want to know. I doubt even whether you
deceived yourself. You saw a chance of making big money, Mr.
White, and big money has always had an attraction for you. There
isn't a fool's scheme that was ever hatched in a back alley bar
that you haven't dropped money over. And you saw a chance here,
more tangible than any that had been presented to you."</p>

<p>"I swear to you&mdash;" began White.</p>

<p>"The time has not come for you to swear anything," said
McNorton sternly, "there is only one place where a man need
take his oath, and that is on the witness-stand. I will tell you
this frankly, that we are as much in the dark as you pretend to
be. There is only one man who knows or guesses the secret of the
Green Rust, and that man is Beale."</p>

<p>"Beale!"</p>

<p>"You have met the gentleman, I believe? I hope you don't have
to meet him again. The Green Rust may mean little. It may mean
no more than that you will lose your money, and I should imagine
that is the least which will happen to you. On the other hand,
Mr. White, I do not disguise from you the fact that it may also
mean your death at the hands of the law."</p>

<p>White made a gurgling noise in his throat and held on to the
desk for support.</p>

<p>"I have only the haziest information as to what it is all
about, but somehow "&mdash;McNorton knit his brows in a frown
and was speaking half to himself&mdash;"I seem to feel that it
is a bad business&mdash;a damnably bad business."</p>

<p>He took up his hat from the table and walked to the door.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether to say an revoir or good-bye." he said
with twitching lips.</p>

<p>"Good-bye&mdash;ah&mdash;is a very good old-fashioned word."
said Mr. White, in an heroic attempt to imitate the other's good
humour.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; BRIDGERS BREAKS
LOOSE</a></h2>

<p class="first">DR. VAN HEERDEN sat by the side of the big
four-poster bed, where the girl lay, and his cold blue eyes held
a spark of amusement.</p>

<p>"You look very foolish," he said.</p>

<p>Oliva Cresswell turned her head sharply so as to remove the
man from her line of vision.</p>

<p>More than this she could not do, for her hands and feet were
strapped, and on the pillow, near her head was a big bath-towel
saturated with water which had been employed in stifling her
healthy screams which marked her return to understanding.</p>

<p>"You look very foolish," said the doctor, chewing at the end
of his cigar, "and you look no more foolish than you have been.
Bridgers let you out, eh? Nice man, Mr. Bridgers; what had he
been telling you?"</p>

<p>She turned her head again and favoured him with a stare. Then
she looked at the angry red mark on her wrists where the straps
chafed.</p>

<p>"How Hun-like!" she said; but this time he smiled. "You will
not make me lose my temper again. Little-wife-to-be," he mocked
her; "you may call me Hun or Heinz or Fritz or any of the
barbarous and vulgar names which the outside world employ to
vilify my countrymen, but nothing you say will distress or annoy
me. To-morrow you and I will be man and wife."</p>

<p>"This is not Germany," she said scornfully. "You cannot make
a woman marry you against her will, this is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The land of the free," he interrupted suavely. "Yes&mdash;I
know those lands, on both sides of the Atlantic. But even there
curious things happen. And you're going to marry me&mdash;you
will say 'Yes' to the sleek English clergyman when he asks you
whether you will take this man to be your married husband, to
love and cherish and all that sort of thing, you'll say
'Yes.'"</p>

<p>"I shall say 'No!'" she said steadily.</p>

<p>"You will say 'Yes,'" he smiled. "I had hoped to be able to
give sufficient time to you so that I might persuade you to act
sensibly. I could have employed arguments which I think would
have convinced you that there are worse things than marriage
with me."</p>

<p>"I cannot think of any," she replied coldly.</p>

<p>"Then you are singularly dense," said the doctor. "I have
already told you the conditions under which that marriage will
take place. There might be no marriage, you know, and a
different end to this adventure," he said, significantly, and
she shivered.</p>

<p>He said nothing more for five minutes, simply sitting biting
at the cigar between his teeth and looking at her blankly, as
though his thoughts were far away and she was the least of the
problems which confronted him.</p>

<p>"I know it is absurd to ask you," he said suddenly, "but I
presume you have not devoted any of your studies to the question
of capital punishment. I see you haven't; but there is one
interesting fact about the execution of criminals which is not
generally known to the public, and it is that in many countries,
my own for example, before a man is led to execution he is doped
with a drug which I will call 'Bromocine.' Does that interest
you?" She made no reply, and he laughed quietly.</p>

<p>"It should interest you very much," he said. "The effect of
Bromocine," he went on, speaking with the quiet precision of one
who was lecturing on the subject to an interested audience, "is
peculiar. It reduces the subject to a condition of extreme
lassitude, so that really nothing matters or seems to matter.
Whilst perfectly conscious the subject goes obediently to his
death, behaves normally and does just what he is told&mdash;in
fact, it destroys the will."</p>

<p>"Why do you tell me this?" she asked, a sudden fear gripping
her heart.</p>

<p>He half-turned in his chair, reached out his hand and took a
little black case from the table near the window. This he laid
on the bed and opened, and she watched him, fascinated. He took
a tiny bottle containing a colourless liquid, and with great
care laid it on the coverlet. Then he extracted a small
hypodermic syringe and a needle-pointed nozzle. He uncorked the
bottle, inserted the syringe and filled it, then he screwed on
the needle, pressed the plunger until a fine jet leapt in the
air, then he laid it carefully back in the case.</p>

<p>"You say you will not marry me and I presume that you would
make a scene when I bring in the good English parson to perform
the ceremony. I had hoped," he said apologetically, "to have
given you a wedding with all the pomp and circumstance which
women, as I understand, love. Failing that, I hoped for a quiet
wedding in the little church out yonder." He jerked his head
toward the window. "But now I am afraid that I must ask his
reverence to carry out the ceremony in this house."</p>

<p>He rose, leant over her and deftly pulled back her
sleeve.</p>

<p>"If you scream I shall smother you with the towel," he said.
"This won't hurt you very much. As I was going to say, you will
be married here because you are in a delicate state of health
and you will say 'Yes.'"</p>

<p>She winced as the needle punctured the skin. "It won't hurt
you for very long," he said calmly. "You will say 'Yes', I
repeat, because I shall tell you to say 'Yes.'"</p>

<p>Suddenly the sharp pricking pain in her arm ceased. She was
conscious of a sensation as though her arm was being blown up
like a bicycle tyre, but it was not unpleasant. He withdrew the
needle and kept his finger pressed upon the little red wound
where it had gone in.</p>

<p>"I shall do this to you again to-night," he said, "and you
will not feel it at all, and to-morrow morning, and you will not
care very much what happens. I hope it will not be necessary to
give you a dose to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>"I shall not always be under the influence of this drug," she
said between her teeth, "and there will be a time of reckoning
for you. Dr. van Heerden."</p>

<p>"By which time," he said calmly, "I shall have committed a
crime so wonderful and so enormous that the mere offence of
'administering a noxious drug'&mdash;that is the terminology
which describes the offence&mdash;will be of no importance and
hardly worth the consideration of the Crown officers. Now I
think I can unfasten you." He loosened and removed the straps at
her wrists and about her feet and put them in his pocket.</p>

<p>"You had better get up and walk about," he said, "or you will
be stiff. I am really being very kind to you if you only knew
it. I am too big to be vindictive. And, by the way, I had an
interesting talk with your friend, Mr. Beale, this afternoon, a
persistent young man who has been having me shadowed all day."
He laughed quietly. "If I hadn't to go back to the surgery for
the Bromocine I should have missed our very interesting
conversation. That young man is very much in love with you
"&mdash;he looked amusedly at the growing red in her face. "He
is very much in love with you," he repeated. "What a pity! What
a thousand pities!"</p>

<p>"How soon will this drug begin to act?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Are you frightened?"</p>

<p>"No, but I should welcome anything which made me oblivious to
your presence&mdash;you are not exactly a pleasant companion,"
she said, with a return to the old tone he knew so well.</p>

<p>"Content yourself, little person," he said with simulated
affection. "You will soon be rid of me."</p>

<p>She made no reply, and he laughed quietly.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to marry me?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you that now," he said: "Because you are a very
rich woman and I want your money, half of which comes to me on
my marriage."</p>

<p>"Then the man spoke the truth!" She sat up suddenly, but the
effort made her head swim.</p>

<p>He caught her by the shoulders and laid her gently down.</p>

<p>"What man&mdash;not that babbling idiot, Bridgers?" He said
something, but instantly recovered his self-possession. "Keep
quiet," he said with professional sternness. "Yes, you are the
heiress of an interesting gentleman named John Millinborn."</p>

<p>"John Millinborn!" she gasped. "The man who was
murdered!"</p>

<p>"The man who was killed," he corrected. "'Murder' is a
stupid, vulgar word. Yes, my dear, you are his heiress. He was
your uncle, and he left you something over six million dollars.
That is to say he left us that colossal sum."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand. What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Your name is Predeaux. Your father was the
ruffian&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know," she cried. '"The man in the hotel. The man
who died. My father!"</p>

<p>"Interesting, isn't it?" he said calmly, "like something out
of a book. Yes, my dear, that was your parent, a dissolute
ruffian whom you will do well to forget. I heard John Millinborn
tell his lawyer that your mother died of a broken heart,
penniless, as a result of your father's cruelty and
unscrupulousness, and I should imagine that that was the
truth."</p>

<p>"My father!" she murmured.</p>

<p>She lay, her face as white as the pillow, her eyes
closed.</p>

<p>"John Millinborn left a fortune for you&mdash;and I think
that you might as well know the truth now&mdash;the money was
left in trust. You were not to know that you were an heiress
until you were married. He was afraid of some fortune-hunter
ruining your young life as Predeaux ruined your mother's. That
was thoughtful of him. Now I don't intend ruining your life, I
intend leaving you with half your uncle's fortune and the
capacity for enjoying all that life can hold for a high-spirited
young woman."</p>

<p>"I'll not do it, I'll not do it, I'll not do it," she
muttered.</p>

<p>He rose from the chair and bent over her.</p>

<p>"My young friend, you are going to sleep," he said to
himself, waited a little longer and left the room, closing the
door behind him.</p>

<p>He descended to the hall and passed into the big dining-hall
beneath the girl's bedroom. The room had two occupants, a stout,
hairless man who had neither hair, eyebrows, nor vestige of
beard, and a younger man.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bridgers," said van Heerden addressing the latter,
"you've been talking."</p>

<p>"Well, who doesn't?" snarled the man.</p>

<p>He pulled the tortoiseshell box from his pocket, opened the
lid and took a pinch from its contents, snuffling the powder
luxuriously.</p>

<p>"That stuff will kill you one of these days," said van
Heerden.</p>

<p>"It will make him better-tempered," growled the hairless man.
"I don't mind people who take cocaine as long as they are taking
it. It's between dopes that they get on my nerves."</p>

<p>"Dr. Milsom speaks like a Christian and an artist," said
Bridgers, with sudden cheerfulness. "If I didn't dope, Van
Heerden, I should not be working in your beastly factory, but
would probably be one of the leading analytical chemists in
America. But I'll go back to do my chore," he said rising. "I
suppose I get a little commission for restoring your palpitating
bride? Milsom tells me that it is she. I thought it was the
other dame&mdash;the Dutch girl. I guess I was a bit dopey."</p>

<p>Van Heerden frowned.</p>

<p>"You take too keen an interest in my affairs," he said.</p>

<p>"Aw! You're getting touchy. If I didn't get interested in
something I'd go mad," chuckled Bridgers.</p>

<p>He had reached that stage of cocaine intoxication when the
world was a very pleasant place indeed and full of subject for
jocularity. "This place is getting right on my nerves," he went
on, "couldn't I go to London? I'm stagnating here. Why, some of
the stuff I cultivated the other day wouldn't react. Isn't that
so, Milsom? I get so dull in this hole that all bugs look alike
to me."</p>

<p>Van Heerden glanced at the man who was addressed as Dr.
Milsom and the latter nodded.</p>

<p>"Let him go back," he said, "I'll look after him. How's the
lady?" asked Milsom when they were alone.</p>

<p>The other made a gesture and Dr. Milsom nodded.</p>

<p>"It's good stuff," he said. "I used to give it to lunatics in
the days of long ago."</p>

<p>Van Heerden did not ask him what those days were. He never
pried too closely into the early lives of his associates, but
Milsom's history was public property. Four years before he had
completed a "life sentence" of fifteen years for a crime which
had startled the world in '99.</p>

<p>"How are things generally?" he asked.</p>

<p>Van Heerden shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"For the first time I am getting nervous," he said. "It isn't
so much the fear of Beale that rattles me, but the sordid
question of money. The expenses are colossal and
continuous."</p>

<p>"Hasn't your&mdash;Government"&mdash;Milsom balked at the
word&mdash;"haven't your friends abroad moved in the matter
yet?"</p>

<p>Van Heerden shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am very hopeful there," he said. "I have been watching the
papers very closely, especially the Agrarian papers, and, unless
I am mistaken, there is a decided movement in the direction of
support. But I can't depend on that. The marriage must go
through to-morrow."</p>

<p>"White is getting nervous, too," he went on. "He is pestering
me about the money I owe him, or rather the syndicate owes him.
He's on the verge of ruin."</p>

<p>Milsom made a little grimace.</p>

<p>"Then he'll squeal," he said, "those kind of people always
do. You'll have to keep him quiet. You say the marriage is
coming off to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I have notified the parson," said van Heerden. "I told him
my fiancee is too ill to attend the church and the ceremony must
be performed here."</p>

<p>Milsom nodded. He had risen from the table and was looking
out upon the pleasant garden at the rear of the house.</p>

<p>"A man could do worse than put in three or four weeks here,"
he said. "Look at that spread of green."</p>

<p>He pointed to an expanse of waving grasses, starred with the
vari-coloured blossoms of wild flowers.</p>

<p>"I was never a lover of nature," said van Heerden
carelessly.</p>

<p>Milsom grunted.</p>

<p>"You have never been in prison," he said cryptically. "Is it
time to give your lady another dose?"</p>

<p>"Not for two hours," said van Heerden. "I will play you at
piquet."</p>

<p>The cards were shuffled and the hands dealt when there was a
scamper of feet in the hall, the door burst open and a man ran
in. He was wearing a soiled white smock and his face was
distorted with terror.</p>

<p>"M'sieur, m'sieur," he cried, "that imbecile Bridgers!"</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Van Heerden sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"I think he is mad. He is dancing about the grounds, singing,
and he has with him the preparation!"</p>

<p>Van Heerden rapped out an oath and leapt through the door,
the doctor at his heels. They took the short cut and ran up the
steps leading from the well courtyard, and bursting through the
bushes came within sight of the offender.</p>

<p>But he was not dancing now. He was standing with open mouth,
staring stupidly about him.</p>

<p>"I dropped it, I dropped it!" he stammered.</p>

<p>There was no need for van Heerden to ask what he had dropped,
for the green lawn which had excited Milsom's admiration was no
longer to be seen. In its place was a black irregular patch of
earth which looked as though it had been blasted in the furnaces
of hell, and the air was filled with the pungent mustiness of
decay.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19">XIX. &mdash; OLIVA IS
WILLING</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT seemed that a grey curtain of mist hung
before Oliva's eyes. It was a curtain spangled with tiny globes
of dazzling light which grew from nothing and faded to nothing.
Whenever she fixed her eyes upon one of these it straightway
became two and three and then an uncountable quantity.</p>

<p>She felt that she ought to see faces of people she knew, for
one half of her brain had cleared and was calmly diagnosing her
condition, but doing so as though she were somebody else. She
was emerging from a drugged sleep; she could regard herself in a
curious impersonal fashion which was most interesting. And
people who are drugged see things and people. Strange mirages of
the mind arise and stranger illusions are suffered. Yet she saw
nothing save this silvery grey curtain with its drifting spots
of light and heard nothing except a voice saying, "Come along,
come along, wake up." A hundred, a thousand times this
monotonous order was repeated, and then the grey curtain faded
and she was lying on the bed, her head throbbing, her eyes hot
and prickly, and two men were looking down at her, one of them a
big barefaced man with a coarse mouth and sunken eyes.</p>

<p>"Was it my father really?" she asked drowsily.</p>

<p>"I was afraid of that second dose you gave her last night,"
said Milsom. "You are getting a condition of coma and that's the
last thing you want."</p>

<p>"She'll be all right now," replied van Heerden, but his face
was troubled. "The dose was severe&mdash;yet she seemed healthy
enough to stand a three-minim injection."</p>

<p>Milsom shook his head.</p>

<p>"She'll be all right now, but she might as easily have died,"
he said. "I shouldn't repeat the dose."</p>

<p>"There's no need," said van Heerden.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" asked the girl, and sat up. She felt very
weak and weary, but she experienced no giddiness.</p>

<p>"It is twelve o'clock; you have been sleeping since seven
last night. Let me see if you can stand. Get up."</p>

<p>She obeyed meekly. She had no desire to do anything but what
she was told. Her mental condition was one of complete
dependence, and had she been left to herself she would have been
content to lie down again.</p>

<p>Yet she felt for a moment a most intense desire to propound
some sort of plan which would give this man the money without
going through a marriage ceremony. That desire lasted a minute
and was succeeded by an added weariness as though this effort at
independent thought had added a new burden to her strength. She
knew and was mildly amazed at the knowledge that she was under
the influence of a drug which was destroying her will, yet she
felt no particular urge to make a fight for freedom of
determination. "Freedom of determination." She repeated the
words, having framed her thoughts with punctilious exactness,
and remembered that that was a great war phrase which one was
constantly discovering in the newspapers. All her thoughts were
like this&mdash;they had the form of marshalled language, so
that even her speculations were punctuated.</p>

<p>"Walk over to the window," said the doctor, and she obeyed,
though her knees gave way with every step she took. "Now come
back&mdash;good, you're all right."</p>

<p>She looked at him, and did not flinch when he laid his two
hands on her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You are going to be married this afternoon&mdash;that's all
right, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "that is all right."</p>

<p>"And you'll say 'yes' when I tell you to say 'yes,' won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll say that," she said.</p>

<p>All the time she knew that this was monstrously absurd. All
the time she knew that she did not wish to marry this man. Fine
sentences, pompously framed, slowly formed in her mind such as:
"This outrage will not go unpunished, comma, and you will suffer
for this, comma. Dr. van Heerden, full stop." But the effort of
creating the protest exhausted her so that she could not utter
it. And she knew that the words were stilted and artificial, and
the working-cells of her brain whispered that she was recalling
and adapting something she had heard at the theatre. She wanted
to do the easiest thing, and it seemed absurdly easy to say
"yes."</p>

<p>"You will stay here until the parson comes," said van
Heerden, "and you will not attempt to escape, will you?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't attempt to escape," she said.</p>

<p>"Lie down."</p>

<p>She sat on the bed and swung her feet clear of the ground,
settling herself comfortably.</p>

<p>"She'll do," said van Heerden, satisfied. "Come downstairs,
Milsom, I have something to say to you."</p>

<p>So they left her, lying with her cheek on her hand, more
absorbed in the pattern on the wall-paper than in the tremendous
events which threatened.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the trouble?" asked Milsom, seating himself in
his accustomed place by the table.</p>

<p>"This," said van Heerden, and threw a letter across to him.
"It came by one of my scouts this morning&mdash;I didn't go home
last night. I cannot risk being shadowed here."</p>

<p>Milsom opened the letter slowly and read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"A man called upon you yesterday afternoon and
has made several calls since. He was seen by Beale, who
cross-examined him. Man calls himself Stardt, but is apparently
not British. He is staying at Saraband Hotel, Berners Street."</p>

<br>

<p>"Who is this?" asked Milsom.</p>

<p>"I dare not hope&mdash;" replied the doctor, pacing the room
nervously.</p>

<p>"Suppose you dared, what form would your hope take?"</p>

<p>"I told you the other day," said van Heerden, stopping before
his companion, "that I had asked my Government to assist me.
Hitherto they have refused, that is why I am so desperately
anxious to get this marriage through. I must have money. The
Paddington place costs a small fortune&mdash;you go back there
to-night, by the way&mdash;"</p>

<p>Milsom nodded.</p>

<p>"Has the Government relented?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I told you that certain significant items in
the East Prussian newspapers seemed to hint that they were
coming to my assistance. They have sent no word to me, but if
they should agree they would send their agreement by
messenger."</p>

<p>"And you think this may be the man?"</p>

<p>"It is likely."</p>

<p>"What have you done?"</p>

<p>"I have sent Gregory up to see the man. If he is what I hope
he may be, Gregory will bring him here&mdash;I have given him
the password."</p>

<p>"What difference will it make?" asked Milsom. "You are on to
a big fortune, anyway."</p>

<p>"Fortune?" The eyes of Dr. van Heerden sparkled and he seemed
to expand at the splendour of the vision which was conjured to
his eyes. "No fortune which mortal man has ever possessed will
be comparable. All the riches of all the world will lie at my
feet. Milliards upon milliards&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In fact, a lot of money," said the practical Dr. Milsom.
"'Umph! I don't quite see how you are going to do it. You
haven't taken me very much into your confidence, van
Heerden."</p>

<p>"You know everything."</p>

<p>Milsom chuckled.</p>

<p>"I know that in the safe of my office you have a thousand
sealed envelopes addressed, as I gather, to all the scallywags
of the world, and I know pretty well what you intend doing; but
how do you benefit? And how do I benefit?"</p>

<p>Van Heerden had recovered his self-possession.</p>

<p>"You have already benefited," he said shortly, "more than you
could have hoped."</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause; then Milsom asked: "What effect
is it going to have upon this country?"</p>

<p>"It will ruin England," said van Heerden fervently, and the
old criminal's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"'Umph!" he said again, and there was a note in his voice
which made van Heerden look at him quickly.</p>

<p>"This country hasn't done very much for you," he sneered.</p>

<p>"And I haven't done much for this country&mdash;yet,"
countered the other.</p>

<p>The doctor laughed. "You're turning into a patriot in your
old age," he said.</p>

<p>"Something like that," said Milsom easily. "There used to be
a fellow at Portland&mdash;you have probably run across
him&mdash;a clever crook named Homo, who used to be a parson
before he got into trouble."</p>

<p>"I never met the gentleman, and talking of parsons," he said,
looking at his watch, "our own padre is late. But I interrupted
you."</p>

<p>"He was a man whose tongue I loathed, and he hated me
poisonously," said Milsom, with a little grimace, "but he used
to say that patriotism was the only form of religion which
survived penal servitude. And I suppose that's the case. I hate
the thought of putting this country in wrong."</p>

<p>"You'll get over your scruples," said the other easily. "You
are putting yourself in right, anyway. Think of the beautiful
time you're going to have, my friend."</p>

<p>"I think of nothing else," said Milsom, "but still&mdash;" He
shook his head.</p>

<p>Van Heerden had taken up the paper he had brought down and
was reading it, and Milsom noted that he was perusing the
produce columns.</p>

<p>"When do we make a start?"</p>

<p>"Next week," said the doctor. "I want to finish up the
Paddington factory and get away."</p>

<p>"Where will you go?"</p>

<p>"I shall go to the Continent." replied van Heerden, folding
up the paper and laying it on the table. "I can conduct
operations from there with greater ease. Gregory goes to Canada.
Mitchell and Samps have already organized Australia, and our
three men in India will have ready workers."</p>

<p>"What about the States?"</p>

<p>"That has an organization of its own," Van Heerden said; "it
is costing me a lot of money. All the men except you are at
their stations waiting for the word 'Go.' You will take the
Canadian supplies with you."</p>

<p>"Do I take Bridgers?"</p>

<p>Van Heerden shook his head. "I can't trust that fool.
Otherwise he would be an ideal assistant for you. Your work is
simple. Before you leave I will give you a sealed envelope
containing a list of all our Canadian agents. You will also find
two code sentences, one of which means 'Commence operations,'
and the other, 'Cancel all instructions and destroy
apparatus.'"</p>

<p>"Will the latter be necessary?" asked Milsom.</p>

<p>"It may be, though it is very unlikely. But I must provide
against all contingencies. I have made the organization as
simple as possible. I have a chief agent in every country, and
on receipt of my message by the chief of the organization, it
will be repeated to the agents, who also have a copy of the
code."</p>

<p>"It seems too easy," said Milsom. "What chance is there of
detection?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," said the doctor promptly. "Our only danger
for the moment is this man Beale, but he knows nothing, and so
long as we only have him guessing there is no great harm
done&mdash;and, anyway, he hasn't much longer to guess."</p>

<p>"It seems much too simple," said Milsom, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>Van Heerden had heard a footfall in the hall, stepped quickly
to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>"Well, Gregory?" he said.</p>

<p>"He is here," replied the other, and waved his hand to a
figure who stood behind him. "Also, the parson is coming down
the road."</p>

<p>"Good, let us have our friend in."</p>

<p>The pink-faced foreigner with his stiff little moustache and
his yellow boots stepped into the room, clicked his heels and
bowed.</p>

<p>"Have I the honour of addressing Doctor von Heerden?"</p>

<p>"Van Heerden," corrected the doctor with a smile "that is my
name."</p>

<p>Both men spoke in German.</p>

<p>"I have a letter for your excellency," said the messenger. "I
have been seeking you for many days and I wish to report that
unauthorized persons have attempted to take this from me."</p>

<p>Van Heerden nodded, tore open the envelope and read the half
a dozen lines.</p>

<p>"The test-word is 'Breslau,'" he said in a low voice, and the
messenger beamed.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to convey to you the word." He whispered
something in van Heerden's ear and Milsom, who did not
understand German very well and had been trying to pick up a
word or two, saw the look of exultation that came to the
doctor's face.</p>

<p>He leapt back and threw out his arms, and his strong voice
rang with the words which the German hymnal has made famous:</p>

<p>"Gott sei Dank durch alle Welt, Gott sei Dank durch alle
Welt!"</p>

<p>"What are you thanking God about?" asked Milsom.</p>

<p>"It's come, it's come!" cried van Heerden, his eyes ablaze.
"The Government is with me; behind me, my beautiful country. Oh,
Gott sei Dank!"</p>

<p>"The parson," warned Milsom.</p>

<p>A young man stood looking through the open door.</p>

<p>"The parson, yes," said van Heerden, "there's no need for it,
but we'll have this wedding. Yes, we'll have it! Come in,
sir."</p>

<p>He was almost boyishly jovial. Milsom had never seen him like
that before.</p>

<p>"Come in, sir."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear your fiancee is ill," said the
curate.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but that will not hinder the ceremony. I'll go
myself and prepare her." Milsom had walked round the table to
the window, and it was he who checked the doctor as he was
leaving the room.</p>

<p>"Doctor," he said, "come here."</p>

<p>Van Heerden detected a strain of anxiety in the other's
voice.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Do you hear somebody speaking?"</p>

<p>They stood by the window and listened intently.</p>

<p>"Come with me," said the doctor, and he walked noiselessly
and ascended the stairs, followed more slowly by his heavier
companion.</p>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20">XX. &mdash; THE
MARRIAGE</a></h2>

<p class="first">A QUARTER of a mile from Deans Folly a motorcar
was halted on the side of a hill overlooking the valley in which
van Heerden's house was set.</p>

<p>"That's the house," said Beale, consulting the map, "and that
wall that runs along the road is the wall the tramp
described."</p>

<p>"You seem to put a lot of faith in the statement of a man
suffering from delirium tremens," said Parson Homo dryly.</p>

<p>"He was not suffering from delirium tremens this morning. You
didn't see him?"</p>

<p>Homo shook his head.</p>

<p>"I was in London fixing the preliminaries of your nuptials,"
he said sarcastically. "It may be the house," he admitted;
"where is the entrance?"</p>

<p>"There's a road midway between here and the river and a
private road leading off," said Beale; "the gate, I presume, is
hidden somewhere in those bushes."</p>

<p>He raised a pair of field-glasses and focused them.</p>

<p>"Yes, the gate's there," he said. "Do you see that man?"</p>

<p>Homo took the glasses and looked.</p>

<p>"Looks like a watcher," he said, "and if it is your friend's
place the gate will be locked and barred. Why don't you get a
warrant?"</p>

<p>Beale shook his head.</p>

<p>"He'd get wind of it and be gone. No, our way in is over the
wall. The 'hobo' said there's a garden door somewhere."</p>

<p>They left the car and walked down the hill and presently came
to a corner of the high wall which surrounded Deans Folly.</p>

<p>Beale passed on ahead.</p>

<p>"Here's the door," he said.</p>

<p>He tried it gingerly and it gave a little.</p>

<p>"It's clogged, and you won't get it open," said Homo; "it's
the wall or nothing."</p>

<p>Beale looked up and down the road. There was nobody in sight
and he made a leap, caught the top of the wall and drew himself
up. Luckily the usual chevaux de frise was absent. Beneath him
and a little to the right was a shed built against the wall, the
door of which was closed.</p>

<p>He signalled Homo to follow and dropped to the ground. In a
minute both men were sheltering in the clump of bushes where on
the previous day Oliva had waited before making a dart for the
garden door.</p>

<p>"There's been a fire here," said Homo in a low voice, and
pointed to a big ugly patch of black amidst the green.</p>

<p>Beale surveyed it carefully, then wormed his way through the
bushes until he was within reach of the ruined plot. He
stretched out his hand and pulled in a handful of the debris,
examined it carefully and stuffed it into his pocket.</p>

<p>"You are greatly interested in a grass fire," said Homo
curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, aren't I?" replied Beale.</p>

<p>They spent the next hour reconnoitring the ground. Once the
door of the wall-shed opened, two men came out and walked to the
house, and they had to lie motionless until after a seemingly
interminable interval they returned again, stopping in the
middle of the black patch to talk. Beale saw one pointing to the
ruin and the other shook his head and they both returned to the
shed and the door closed behind them.</p>

<p>"There's somebody coming down the main drive," whispered
Homo.</p>

<p>They were now near the house and from where they lay had a
clear view of fifty yards of the drive.</p>

<p>"It's a brother brush!" said Homo, in a chuckling
whisper.</p>

<p>"A what?" asked Beale.</p>

<p>"A parson."</p>

<p>"A parson?"</p>

<p>He focused his glasses. Someone in clerical attire
accompanied by the man whom Beale recognized as the guard of the
gate, was walking quickly down the drive. There was no time to
be lost. But now for the first time doubts assailed him. His
great scheme seemed more fantastic and its difficulties more
real. What could be easier than to spring out and intercept the
clergyman, but would that save the girl? What force did the
house hold? He had to deal with men who would stop short at
nothing to achieve their purpose and in particular one man who
had not hesitated at murder.</p>

<p>He felt his heart thumping, not at the thought of danger,
though danger he knew was all round, but from sheer panic that
he himself was about to play an unworthy part. Whatever fears or
doubts he may have had suddenly fail away from him and he rose
to his knees, for not twenty yards away at a window, her hands
grasping the bars, her apathetic eyes looking listlessly toward
where he crouched, was Oliva Cresswell.</p>

<p>Regardless of danger, he broke cover and ran toward her.</p>

<p>"Miss Cresswell," he called.</p>

<p>She looked at him across the concrete well without
astonishment and without interest.</p>

<p>"It is you," she said, with extraordinary calm.</p>

<p>He stood on the brink of the well hesitating. It was too far
to leap and he remembered that behind the lilac bush he had seen
a builder's plank. This he dragged out and passed it across the
chasm, leaning the other end upon a ledge of brickwork which
butted from the house.</p>

<p>He stepped quickly across, gripped the bars and found a
foothold on the ledge, the girl standing watching him without
any sign of interest. He knew something was wrong. He could not
even guess what that something was. This was not the girl he
knew, but an Oliva Cresswell from whom all vitality and life had
been sapped.</p>

<p>"You know me?" he said. "I am Mr. Beale."</p>

<p>"I know you are Mr. Beale," she replied evenly.</p>

<p>"I have come to save you," he said rapidly. "Will you trust
me? I want you to trust me," he said earnestly. "I want you to
summon every atom of faith you have in human nature and invest
it in me. Will you do this for me?"</p>

<p>"I will do this for you," she said, like a child repeating a
lesson.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I want you to marry me." He realized as he said
these words in what his fear was founded. He knew now that it
was her refusal even to go through the form of marriage which he
dared not face.</p>

<p>The truth leapt up to him and sent the blood pulsing through
his head, that behind and beyond his professional care for her
he loved her. He waited with bated breath, expecting her
amazement, her indignation, her distress. But she was serene and
untroubled, did not so much as raise her eyelids by the fraction
of an inch as she answered: "I will marry you."</p>

<p>He tried to speak but could only mutter a hoarse, "Thank
you."</p>

<p>He turned his head. Homo stood at the end of the plank and he
beckoned him.</p>

<p>Parson Homo came to the centre of the frail bridge, slipped a
Prayer Book from his tail pocket and opened it.</p>

<p>"Dearly beloved, we are come together here in the sight of
God to join together this Man and this Woman in Holy
Matrimony...</p>

<p>"I require and charge you both as ye will answer at the
dreadful Day of Judgment when the secret of all hearts shall be
disclosed that if either of you know any impediment why ye may
not be joined together in Matrimony ye do now confess it."</p>

<p>Beale's lips were tight pressed. The girl was looking
serenely upward to a white cloud that sailed across the western
skies.</p>

<p>Homo read quickly, his enunciation beautifully clear, and
Beale found himself wondering when last this man had performed
so sacred an office. He asked the inevitable question and Beale
answered. Homo hesitated, then turned to the girl.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband to live
together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony?
Wilt thou obey him and serve him, love, honour and keep him in
sickness and in health; and forsaking all others keep thee only
unto him, so long as ye both shall live?"</p>

<p>The girl did not immediately answer, and the pause was
painful to the two men, but for different reasons. Then she
suddenly withdrew her gaze from the sky and looked Homo straight
in the face.</p>

<p>"I will," she said.</p>

<p>The next question in the service he dispensed with. He placed
their hands together, and together repeating his words, they
plighted their troth. Homo leant forward and again joined their
hands and a note of unexpected solemnity vibrated in his voice
when he spoke.</p>

<p>"Those whom God hath joined together let no man put
asunder."</p>

<p>Beale drew a deep breath then: "Very pretty indeed," said a
voice.</p>

<p>The detective swung across the window to bring the speaker
into a line of fire.</p>

<p>"Put down your gun, admirable Mr. Beale." Van Heerden stood
in the centre of the room and the bulky figure of Milsom filled
the doorway.</p>

<p>"Very pretty indeed, and most picturesque," said van Heerden.
"I didn't like to interrupt the ceremony. Perhaps you will now
come into the house, Mr. Beale, and I will explain a few things
to you. You need not trouble about your&mdash;wife. She will not
be harmed."</p>

<p>Beale, revolver still in hand, made his way to the door and
was admitted.</p>

<p>"You had better come along. Homo," he said, "we may have to
bluff this out."</p>

<p>Van Heerden was waiting for him in the hall and invited him
no farther.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly at liberty to take away your wife," said
van Heerden; "she will probably explain to you that I have
treated her with every consideration. Here she is."</p>

<p>Oliva was descending the stairs with slow, deliberate
steps.</p>

<p>"I might have been very angry with you," van Heerden went on,
with that insolent drawl of his; "happily I do not find it any
longer necessary to marry Miss Cresswell. I was just explaining
to this gentleman"&mdash;he pointed to the pallid young curate
in the background&mdash;"when your voices reached me.
Nevertheless, I think it only right to tell you that your
marriage is not a legal one, though I presume you are provided
with a special licence."</p>

<p>"Why is it illegal?" asked Beale.</p>

<p>He wondered if Parson Homo had been recognized.</p>

<p>"In the first place because it was not conducted in the
presence of witnesses," said van Heerden.</p>

<p>It was Homo who laughed. "I am afraid that would make it
illegal but for the fact that you witnessed the ceremony by your
own confession, and so presumably did your fat friend behind
you."</p>

<p>Mr. Milsom scowled.</p>

<p>"You were always a bitter dog to me, Parson," he said, "but I
can give you a reason why it's illegal," he said triumphantly.
"That man is Parson Homo, a well-known crook who was kicked out
of the Church fifteen years ago. I worked alongside him in
Portland."</p>

<p>Homo smiled crookedly.</p>

<p>"You are right up to a certain point, Milsom," he said, "but
you are wrong in one essential. By a curious oversight I was
never unfrocked, and I am still legally a priest of the Church
of England."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" gasped Beale, "then this marriage is legal!"</p>

<p>"It's as legal as it can possibly be," said Parson Homo
complacently.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21">XXI. &mdash; BEALE SEES
WHITE</a></h2>

<p class="first">"IN a sense," said Lawyer Kitson, "it is a
tragedy. In a sense it is a comedy. The most fatal comedy of
errors that could be imagined."</p>

<p>Stanford Beale sat on a low chair, his head in his hands, the
picture of dejection.</p>

<p>"I don't mind your kicks," he said, without looking up; "you
can't say anything worse about me than I am saying about myself.
Oh, I've been a fool, an arrogant mad fool."</p>

<p>Kitson, his hands clasped behind his back under his tail
coat, his gold-rimmed pince-nez perched on his nose, looked down
at the young man.</p>

<p>"I am not going to tell you that I was against the idea from
the beginning, because that is unnecessary. I ought to have put
my foot down and stopped it. I heard you were pretty clever with
a gun, Stanford. Why didn't you sail in and rescue the girl as
soon as you found where she was?"</p>

<p>"I don't think there would have been a ghost of a chance,"
said the other, looking up. "I am not finding excuses, but I am
telling you what I know. There were four or five men in the
house and they were all pretty tough citizens&mdash;I doubt if I
would have made it that way.</p>

<p>"You think he would have married her?"</p>

<p>"He admitted as much," said Stanford Beale, "the parson was
already there when I butted in."</p>

<p>"What steps are you taking to deal with this man van
Heerden?"</p>

<p>Beale laughed helplessly.</p>

<p>"I cannot take any until Miss Cresswell recovers."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Beale," murmured Kitson, and the other went red.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll call her Miss Cresswell, if you don't mind,"
he said sharply, "see here, Mr. Kitson, you needn't make things
worse than they are. I can do nothing until she recovers and can
give us a statement as to what happened. McNorton will execute
the warrant just as soon as we can formulate a charge. In fact,
he is waiting downstairs in the hope of seeing&mdash;" he
paused, "Miss Cresswell. What does the doctor say?"</p>

<p>"She's sleeping now."</p>

<p>"It's maddening, maddening," groaned Beale, "and yet if it
weren't so horrible I could laugh. Yesterday I was waiting for a
'hobo' to come out of delirium tremens. To-day I am waiting for
Miss Cresswell to recover from some devilish drug. I've made a
failure of it, Mr. Kitson."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you have," said the other dryly; "what do you
intend doing?"</p>

<p>"But does it occur to you," asked Kitson slowly, "that this
lady is not aware that she has married you and that we've got to
break the news to her? That's the part I don't like."</p>

<p>"And you can bet it doesn't fill me with rollicking high
spirits," snapped Beale; "it's a most awful situation."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked the other again.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" replied the exasperated Beale,
"after all, you're her lawyer."</p>

<p>"And you're her husband," said Kitson grimly, "which reminds
me." He walked to his desk and took up a slip of paper. "I drew
this out against your coming. This is a certified cheque for
&pound;400,000, that is nearly two million dollars, which I am
authorized to hand to Oliva's husband on the day of her
wedding."</p>

<p>Beale took it from the other's fingers, read it carefully and
tore it into little pieces, after which conversation flagged.
After a while Beale asked:</p>

<p>"What do I have to do to get a divorce?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the lawyer, "by the English law if you leave
your wife and go away, and refuse to return to her she can apply
to a judge of the High Court, who will order you to return
within fourteen days."</p>

<p>"I'd come back in fourteen seconds if she wanted me," said
Beale fervently.</p>

<p>"You're hopeless," said Kitson, "you asked how you could get
a divorce. I presume you want one."</p>

<p>"Of course I do. I want to undo the whole of this horrible
tangle. It's absurd and undignified. Can nothing be done without
Miss Cresswell knowing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing can be done without your wife's knowledge," said
Kitson.</p>

<p>He seemed to take a fiendish pleasure in reminding the
unhappy young man of his misfortune.</p>

<p>"I am not blaming you," he said more soberly, "I blame
myself. When I took this trust from poor John Millinborn I never
realized all that it meant or all the responsibility it
entailed. How could I imagine that the detective I employed to
protect the girl from fortune hunters would marry her? I am not
complaining," he said hastily, seeing the wrath rise in Beale's
face, "it is very unfortunate, and you are as much the victim of
circumstances as I. But unhappily we have not been the real
victims."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Beale, looking up at the ceiling, "if I
were one of those grand little mediaeval knights or one of those
gallant gentlemen one reads about I should blow my brains
out."</p>

<p>"That would be a solution," said Mr. Kitson, "but we should
still have to explain to your wife that she was a widow."</p>

<p>"Then what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Have a cigar," said Kitson.</p>

<p>He took two from his vest pocket and handed one to his
companion, and his shrewd old eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"It's years and years since I read a romantic story," he
said, "and I haven't followed the trend of modern literature
very closely, but I think that your job is to sail in and make
the lady love you."</p>

<p>Beale jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that? Pshaw! It's absurd! It's ridiculous! She
would never love me."</p>

<p>"I don't see why anybody should, least of all your wife,"
said Kitson, "but it would certainly simplify matters."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Marry her all over again," said Kitson, sending a big ring
of smoke into the air, "there's no law against it. You can marry
as many times as you like, providing you marry the same
woman."</p>

<p>"But, suppose&mdash;suppose she loves somebody else?" asked
Beale hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Why then it will be tough on you," said Kitson, "but tougher
on her. Your business is to see that she doesn't love somebody
else."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>A look of infinite weariness passed across Kitson's face. He
removed his glasses and put them carefully into their case.</p>

<p>"Really, as a detective," he said, "you may be a prize
exhibit, but as an ordinary human being you wouldn't even get a
consolation prize. You have got me into a mess and you have got
to get me out. John Millinborn was concerned only with one
thing&mdash;the happiness of his niece. If you can make your
wife, Mrs. Stanford Beale" (Beale groaned), "if you can make
your good lady happy," said the remorseless lawyer, "my trust is
fulfilled. I believe you are a white man, Beale," he said with a
change in his tone, "and that her money means nothing to you. I
may not be able to give a young man advice as to the best method
of courting his wife, but I know something about human nature,
and if you are not straight, I have made one of my biggest
mistakes. My advice to you is to leave her alone for a day or
two until she's quite recovered. You have plenty to occupy your
mind. Go out and fix van Heerden, but not for his treatment of
the girl&mdash;she mustn't figure in a case of that kind, for
all the facts will come out. You think you have another charge
against him; well, prove it. That man killed John Millinborn and
I believe you can put him behind bars. As the guardian angel of
Oliva Cresswell you have shown certain lamentable
deficiencies."&mdash;the smile in his eyes was infectious, and
Stanford Beale smiled in sympathy. "In that capacity I have no
further use for your services and you are fired, but you can
consider yourself re-engaged on the spot to settle with van
Heerden. I will pay all the expenses of the chase&mdash;but get
him."</p>

<p>He put out his hand and Stanford gripped it.</p>

<p>"You're a great man, sir," he breathed. The old man
chuckled.</p>

<p>"And you may even be a great detective," he said. "In five
minutes your Mr. Lassimus White will be here. You suggested I
should send for him&mdash;who is he, by the way?"</p>

<p>"The managing director of Punsonby's. A friend of van
Heerden's and a shareholder in his Great Adventure."</p>

<p>"But he knows nothing?"</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door and a page-boy came into the
sitting-room with a card.</p>

<p>"Show the gentleman up," said Kitson; "it is our friend," he
explained.</p>

<p>"And he may know a great deal," said Beale.</p>

<p>Mr. White stalked into the room dangling his glasses with the
one hand and holding his shiny silk hat with the other. He
invariably carried his hat as though it were a rifle he were
shouldering.</p>

<p>He bowed ceremoniously and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>"Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Kitson?" he said, and advanced a big
hand. "I received your note and am, as you will observe,
punctual. I may say that my favourite motto is 'Punctuality is
the politeness of princes.'"</p>

<p>"You know Mr. Beale?"</p>

<p>Mr. White bowed stiffly.</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;ah&mdash;met Mr. Beale."</p>

<p>"In my unregenerate days," said Beale cheerfully, "but I am
quite sober now."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to learn this," said Mr. White. "I am
extremely glad to learn this."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kitson asked you to come, Mr. White, but really it is I
who want to see you," said Beale. "To be perfectly frank, I
learnt that you were in some slight difficulty."</p>

<p>"Difficulty?" Mr. White bristled. "Me, sir, in difficulty?
The head of the firm of Punsonby's, whose credit stands, sir, as
a model of sound industrial finance? Oh no, sir."</p>

<p>Beale was taken aback. He had depended upon information which
came from unimpeachable sources to secure the co-operation of
this pompous windbag.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said. "I understood that you had called a
meeting of creditors and had offered to sell certain shares in a
syndicate which I had hoped to take off your hands."</p>

<p>Mr. White inclined his head graciously.</p>

<p>"It is true, sir," he said, "that I asked a
few&mdash;ah&mdash;wholesale firms to meet me and to talk over
things. It is also true that I&mdash;ah&mdash;had shares which
had ceased to interest me, but those shares are sold."</p>

<p>"Sold! Has van Heerden bought them in?" asked Beale eagerly;
and Mr. White nodded.</p>

<p>"Doctor van Heerden, a remarkable man, a truly remarkable
man." He shook his head as if he could not bring himself and
never would bring himself to understand how remarkable a man the
doctor was. "Doctor van Heerden has repurchased my shares and
they have made me a very handsome profit."</p>

<p>"When was this?" asked Beale.</p>

<p>"I really cannot allow myself to be cross-examined, young
man," he said severely, "by your accent I perceive that you are
of trans-Atlantic origin, but I cannot allow you to hustle
me&mdash;hustle I believe is the word. The firm of
Punsonby's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget 'em," said Beale tersely. "Punsonby's has been on the
verge of collapse for eight years. Let's get square, Mr. White.
Punsonby's is a one man company and you're that man. Its balance
sheets are faked, its reserves are non-existent. Its sinking
fund is spurlos versenkt."</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"I tell you I know Punsonby's&mdash;I've had the best
accountants in London working out your position, and I know you
live from hand to mouth and that the margin between your
business and bankruptcy is as near as the margin between you and
prison."</p>

<p>Mr. White was very pale.</p>

<p>"But that isn't my business and I dare say that the money van
Heerden paid you this morning will stave off your creditors.
Anyway, I'm not running a Pure Business Campaign. I'm running a
campaign against your German friend van Heerden."</p>

<p>"A German?" said the virtuous Mr. White in loud astonishment.
"Surely not&mdash;a Holland gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's a German and you know it. You've been financing him in
a scheme to ruin the greater part of Europe and the United
States, to say nothing of Canada, South America, India and
Australia."</p>

<p>"I protest against such an inhuman charge," said Mr. White
solemnly, and he rose. "I cannot stay here any
longer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you go I'll lay information against you," said Beale.
"I'm in dead earnest, so you can go or stay. First of all, I
want to know in what form you received the money?"</p>

<p>"By cheque," replied White in a flurry.</p>

<p>"On what bank?"</p>

<p>"The London branch of the Swedland National Bank."</p>

<p>"A secret branch of the Dresdner Bank," said Beale. "That's
promising. Has Doctor Van Heerden ever paid you money
before?"</p>

<p>By now Mr. White was the most tractable of witnesses. All his
old assurance had vanished, and his answers were almost
apologetic in tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Beale, small sums."</p>

<p>"On what bank?"</p>

<p>"On my own bank."</p>

<p>"Good again. Have you ever known that he had an account
elsewhere&mdash;for example, you advanced him a very
considerable sum of money; was your cheque cleared through the
Swedland National Bank?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;through my own bank." Beale fingered his
chin.</p>

<p>"Money this morning and he took his loss in good
part&mdash;that can only mean one thing." He nodded. "Mr. White,
you have supplied me with valuable information."</p>

<p>"I trust I have said nothing which
may&mdash;ah&mdash;incriminate one who has invariably treated me
with the highest respect," Mr. White hastened to say.</p>

<p>"Not more than he is incriminated," smiled Stanford. "One
more question. You know that van Heerden is engaged in some sort
of business&mdash;the business in which you invested your
money. Where are his factories?"</p>

<p>But here Mr. White protested he could offer no information.
He recalled, not without a sinking of heart, a similar
cross-examination on the previous day at the hands of McNorton.
There were factories&mdash;van Heerden had hinted as much&mdash;
but as to where they were located&mdash;well, confessed Mr.
White, he hadn't the slightest idea.</p>

<p>"That's rubbish," said Beale roughly, "you know. Where did
you communicate with van Heerden? He wasn't always at his flat
and you only came there twice."</p>

<p>"I assure you&mdash;" began Mr. White, alarmed by the other's
vehemence.</p>

<p>"Assure nothing," thundered Beale, "your policies won't
sell&mdash;where did you see him?"</p>

<p>"On my honour!"</p>

<p>"Let's keep jokes outside of the argument," said Beale
truculently, "where did you see him?"</p>

<p>"Believe me, I never saw him&mdash;if I had a message to
send, my cashier&mdash;ah&mdash;Miss Glaum, an admirable young
lady&mdash;carried it for me."</p>

<p>"Hilda Glaum!"</p>

<p>Beale struck his palm. Why had he not thought of Hilda Glaum
before?</p>

<p>"That's about all I want to ask you, Mr. White," he said
mildly; "you're a lucky man."</p>

<p>"Lucky, sir!" Mr. White recovered his hauteur as quickly as
Beale's aggressiveness passed. "I fail to perceive my fortune. I
fail to see, sir, where luck comes in."</p>

<p>"You have your money back," said Beale significantly, "if you
hadn't been pressed for money and had not pressed van Heerden
you would have whistled for it."</p>

<p>"Do you suggest," demanded White, in his best judicial
manner, "do you suggest in the presence of a witness with a due
appreciation of the actionable character of your words that
Doctor van Heerden is a common swindler?"</p>

<p>"Not common," replied Beale, "thank goodness!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22">XXII. &mdash; HILDA GLAUM LEADS
THE WAY</a></h2>

<p class="first">BEALE had a long consultation with McNorton at
Scotland Yard, and on his return to the hotel, had his dinner
sent up to Kitson's private room and dined amidst a litter of
open newspapers. They were representative journals of the past
week, and he scanned their columns carefully. Now and again he
would cut out a paragraph and in one case half a column.</p>

<p>Kitson, who was dining with a friend in the restaurant of the
hotel, came up toward nine o'clock and stood looking with
amusement at the detective's silent labours.</p>

<p>"You're making a deplorable litter in my room," he said, "but
I suppose there is something very mysterious and terrible behind
it all. Do you mind my reading your cuttings?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Beale, without raising his eyes from his
newspaper.</p>

<p>Kitson took up a slip and read aloud:</p>

<p>"The reserves of the Land Bank of the Ukraine have been
increased by ten million roubles. This increase has very
considerably eased the situation in Southern Ukraine and in
Galicia, where there has been considerable unrest amongst the
peasants due to the high cost of textiles."</p>

<p>"That is fascinating news," said Kitson sardonically. "Are
you running a scrap-book on high finance?"</p>

<p>"No," said the other shortly, "the Land Bank is a Loan Bank.
It finances peasant proprietors."</p>

<p>"You a shareholder?" asked Mr. Kitson wonderingly.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Kitson picked up another cutting. It was a telegraphic
dispatch dated from Berlin:</p>


<br>

<p class="quote">"As evidence of the healthy industrial tone
which prevails in Germany and the rapidity with which the
Government is recovering from the effects of the war, I may
instance the fact that an order has been placed with the
Leipziger Spoorwagen-Gesellschaft* for 60,000 box-cars. The
order has been placed by the L.S.G. with thirty firms, and the
first delivery is due in six weeks."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The Leipzig Rolling Stock Company. The
name used by Wallace is a mixture of Dutch and German.
"Spoorwagen" is Dutch for "rail-car" or "rolling stock."
The German equivalent of "Spoorwagen" is "Schienenfahrzeug,"
and "Gesellschaft" is the German word for "company" or
"society."&mdash;RG.]</p>

<br>

<p>"That's exciting," said Kitson, "but why cut it out?" The
next cutting was also dated "Berlin" and announced the revival
of the "War Purchase Council" of the old belligerent days as "a
temporary measure."</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">"It is not intended," said the dispatch, "to invest the
committee with all its old functions, and the step has been
taken in view of the bad potato crop to organize
distribution."</p>

<br>

<p>"What's the joke about that?" asked Kitson, now puzzled.</p>

<p>"The joke is that there is no potato shortage&mdash;there
never was such a good harvest," said Beale. "I keep tag of these
things and I know. The Western Mail had an article from its
Berlin correspondent last week saying that potatoes were so
plentiful that they were a drug on the market."</p>

<p>"H'm!"</p>

<p>"Did you read about the Zeppelin sheds?" asked Beale. "You
will find it amongst the others. All the old Zepp hangars
throughout Germany are to be put in a state of repair and turned
into skating-rinks for the physical development of young
Germany. Wonderful concrete floors are to be laid down, all the
dilapidations are to be made good, and the bands will play
daily, wet or fine."</p>

<p>"What does it all mean?" asked the bewildered lawyer.</p>

<p>"That The Day&mdash;the real Day is near at hand," said Beale
soberly.</p>

<p>"War?"</p>

<p>"Against the world, but without the flash of a bayonet or the
boom of a cannon. A war fought by men sitting in their little
offices and pulling the strings that will choke you and me, Mr.
Kitson. To-night I am going after van Heerden. I may catch him
and yet fail to arrest his evil work&mdash;that's a funny word,
'evil,' for everyday people to use, but there's no other like
it. To-morrow, whether I catch him or not, I will tell you the
story of the plot I accidentally discovered. The British
Government thinks that I have got on the track of a big
thing&mdash;so does Washington, and I'm having all the help I
want."</p>

<p>"It's a queer world," said Kitson.</p>

<p>"It may be queerer," responded Beale, then boldly; "How is my
wife?"</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;well, I like your nerve!" gasped Kitson.</p>

<p>"I thought you preferred it that way&mdash;how is Miss
Cresswell?"</p>

<p>"The nurse says she is doing famously. She is sleeping now;
but she woke up for food and is nearly normal. She did not ask
for you," he added pointedly.</p>

<p>Beale flushed and laughed.</p>

<p>"My last attempt to be merry," he said. "I suppose that
to-morrow she will be well."</p>

<p>"But not receiving visitors," Kitson was careful to warn him.
"You will keep your mind off Oliva and keep your eye fixed on van
Heerden if you are wise. No man can serve two masters."</p>

<p>Stanford Beale looked at his watch. "It is the hour," he said
oracularly, and got up.</p>

<p>"I'll leave this untidiness for your man to clear," said
Kitson. "Where do you go now?"</p>

<p>"To see Hilda Glaum&mdash;if the fates are kind," said Beale.
"I'm going to put up a bluff, believing that in her panic she
will lead me into the lion's den with the idea of van Heerden
making one mouthful of me. I've got to take that risk. If she is
what I think she is, she'll lay a trap for me&mdash;I'll fall
for it, but I'm going to get next to van Heerden to-night."</p>

<p>Kitson accompanied him to the door of the hotel.</p>

<p>"Take no unnecessary risks," he said at parting, "don't
forget that you're a married man."</p>

<p>"That's one of the things I want to forget if you'll let me,"
said the exasperated young man.</p>

<p>Outside the hotel he hailed a passing taxi and was soon
speeding through Piccadilly westward. He turned by Hyde Park
Corner, skirted the grounds of Buckingham Palace and plunged
into the maze of Pimlico. He pulled up before a dreary-looking
house in a blank and dreary street, and telling the cabman to
wait, mounted the steps and rang the bell.</p>

<p>A diminutive maid opened the door.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Glaum in?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Will you step into the drawing-room? All the other
boarders are out. What name shall I say?"</p>

<p>"Tell her a gentleman from Krooman Mansions," he answered
diplomatically.</p>

<p>He walked into the tawdry parlour and put down his hat and
stick, and waited. Presently the door opened and the girl came
in. She stopped open-mouthed with surprise at the sight of him,
and her surprise deepened to suspicion.</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;" she began, and checked herself.</p>

<p>"You thought I was Doctor van Heerden? Well, I am not."</p>

<p>"You're the man I saw at Heyler's," she said, glowering at
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, my name is Beale."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've heard about you. You'll get nothing by prying
here," she cried.</p>

<p>"I shall get a great deal by prying here, I think," he said
calmly. "Sit down. Miss Hilda Glaum, and let us understand one
another. You are a friend of Doctor van Heerden's?"</p>

<p>"I shall answer no questions," she snapped.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will answer this question," he said, "why did
Doctor van Heerden secure an appointment for you at Punsonby's,
and why, when you were there, did you steal three registered
envelopes which you conveyed to the doctor?"</p>

<p>Her face went red and white.</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"You might tell a judge and jury that and then they wouldn't
believe you," he smiled. "Come, Miss Glaum, let us be absolutely
frank with one another. I am telling you that I don't intend
bringing your action to the notice of the police, and you can
give me a little information which will be very useful to
me."</p>

<p>"It's a lie," she repeated, visibly agitated, "I did not
steal anything. If Miss Cresswell says so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Cresswell is quite ignorant of your treachery," said
the other quietly; "but as you are determined to deny that much,
perhaps you will tell me this, what business brings you to
Doctor van Heerden's flat in the small hours of the
morning?"</p>

<p>"Do you insinuate&mdash;?</p>

<p>"I insinuate nothing. And least of all do I insinuate that
you have any love affair with the doctor, who does not strike me
as that kind of person."</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed and for a moment it seemed that her natural
vanity would overcome her discretion.</p>

<p>"Who says I go to Doctor van Heerden's?"</p>

<p>"I say so, because I have seen you. Surely you don't forget
that I live opposite the amiable doctor?"</p>

<p>"I am not going to discuss my business or his," she said,
"and I don't care what you threaten me with or what you do."</p>

<p>"I will do something more than threaten you," he said
ominously, "you will not fool me. Miss Glaum, and the sooner you
realize the fact the better. I am going all the way with you if
you give me any trouble, and if you don't answer my questions. I
might tell you that unless this interview is a very satisfactory
one to me I shall not only arrest Doctor van Heerden to-night
but I shall take you as an accomplice."</p>

<p>"You can't, you can't." She almost screamed the words. All
the sullen restraint fell away from her and she was electric in
the violence of her protest. "Arrest him? That wonderful man?
Arrest me? You dare not! You dare not!"</p>

<p>"I shall dare do lots of things unless you tell me what I
want to know."</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?" she demanded defiantly.</p>

<p>"I want to know the most likely address at which your friend
the doctor can be found&mdash;the fact is. Miss Glaum, the game
is up&mdash;we know all about the Green Rust."</p>

<p>She stepped back, her hand raised to her mouth.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the Green Rust!" she gasped. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I have every reason to believe that Doctor van
Heerden is engaged in a conspiracy against this State. He has
disappeared, but is still in London. I want to take him
quietly&mdash;without fuss."</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed on his. He saw doubt, rage, a hint of
fear and finally a steady light of resolution shining. When she
spoke her voice was calm.</p>

<p>"Very good. I will take you to the place," she said.</p>

<p>She went out of the room and came back five minutes later
with her hat and coat on.</p>

<p>"It's a long way," she began.</p>

<p>"I have a taxi at the door."</p>

<p>"We cannot go all the way by taxi. Tell the man to drive to
Baker Street," she said.</p>

<p>She spoke no word during the journey, nor was Beale inclined
for conversation. At Baker Street Station they stopped and the
cab was dismissed. Together they walked in silence, turning from
the main road, passing the Central Station and plunging into a
labyrinth of streets which was foreign territory to the
American.</p>

<p>It seemed that he had passed in one step from one of the
best-class quarters of the town to one of the worst. One minute
he was passing through a sedate square, lined with the houses of
the well-to-do, another minute he was in a slum.</p>

<p>"The place is at the end of this street," she said.</p>

<p>They came to what seemed to be a stable-yard. There was a
blank wall with one door and a pair of gates. The girl took a
key from her bag, opened the small door and stepped in, and
Beale followed.</p>

<p>They were in a yard littered with casks. On two sides of the
yard ran low-roofed buildings which had apparently been used as
stables. She locked the door behind her, walked across the yard
to the corner and opened another door.</p>

<p>"There are fourteen steps down," she said, "have you a light
of any kind?"</p>

<p>He took his electric torch from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Give it to me," she said, "I will lead the way."</p>

<p>"What is this place?" he asked, after she had locked the
door.</p>

<p>"It used to be a wine merchant's," she said shortly, "we have
the cellars."</p>

<p>"We?" he repeated.</p>

<p>She made no reply. At the bottom of the steps was a short
passage and another door which was opened, and apparently the
same key fitted them all, or else as Beale suspected she carried
a pass key.</p>

<p>They walked through, and again she closed the door behind
them.</p>

<p>"Another?" he said, as her light flashed upon a steel door a
dozen paces ahead.</p>

<p>"It is the last one," she said, and went on.</p>

<p>Suddenly the light was extinguished.</p>

<p>"Your lamp's gone wrong," he heard her say, "but I can find
the lock."</p>

<p>He heard a click, but did not see the door open and did not
realize what had happened until he heard a click again. The
light was suddenly flashed on him, level with his eyes.</p>

<p>"You can't see me," said a mocking voice, "I'm looking at you
through the little spy-hole. Did you see the spyhole, clever Mr.
Beale? And I am on the other side of the door." He heard her
laugh. "Are you going to arrest the doctor to-night?" she
mocked. "Are you going to discover the secret of the Green
Rust&mdash;ah! That is what you want, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"My dear little friend," said Beale smoothly, "you will be
very sensible and open that door. You don't suppose that I came
here alone. I was shadowed all the way."</p>

<p>"You lie," she said coolly, "why did I dismiss the cab and
make you walk? Oh, clever Mr. Beale!"</p>

<p>He chuckled, though he was in no chuckling mood.</p>

<p>"What a sense of humour!" he said admiringly, "now just
listen to me!"</p>

<p>He made one stride to the door, his revolver had flicked out
of his hip-pocket, when he heard the snap of a shutter, and the
barrel that he thrust between the bars met steel. Then came the
grind of bolts and he pocketed his gun.</p>

<p>"So that's that," he said.</p>

<p>Then he walked back to the other door. Struck a match and
examined it. It was sheathed with iron. He tapped the walls with
his stick, but found nothing to encourage him. The floor was
solidly flagged, the low roof of the passage was vaulted and
cased with stone.</p>

<p>He stopped in his search suddenly and listened. Above his
head he heard a light patter of feet, and smiled. It was his
boast that he never forgot a voice or a footfall.</p>

<p>"That's my little friend on her way back, running like the
deuce, to tell the doctor," he said. "I have something under an
hour before the shooting starts!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23">XXIII. &mdash; AT THE DOCTOR'S
FLAT</a></h2>

<p class="first">DR. VAN HEERDEN did not hurry his departure
from his Staines house. He spent the morning following Oliva's
marriage in town, transacting certain important business and
making no attempt to conceal his comings and goings, though he
knew that he was shadowed. Yet he was well aware that every hour
that passed brought danger nearer. He judged (and rightly) that
his peril was not to be found in the consequences to his
detention of Oliva Cresswell.</p>

<p>"I may have a week's grace," he said to Milsom, "and in the
space of a week I can do all that I want."</p>

<p>He spent the evening superintending the dismantling of
apparatus in the shed, and it was past ten o'clock on Tuesday
before he finished.</p>

<p>It was not until he was seated by Milsom's side in the big
limousine and the car was running smoothly through Kingston that
he made any further reference to the previous afternoon.</p>

<p>"Is Beale content?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>Milsom, dozing in the corner of the car, awoke with a
start.</p>

<p>"Is Beale content with his prize&mdash;and his predicament?"
asked van Heerden.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess he should be. That little job brings him a
million. He shouldn't worry about anything further."</p>

<p>But van Heerden shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't think you have things quite right, Milsom," he said.
"Beale is a better man than I thought, and knows my mind a
little too well. He was astounded when Homo claimed to be a
priest&mdash;I never saw a man more stunned in my life. He
intended the marriage as a bluff to keep me away from the girl.
He analysed the situation exactly, for he knew I was after her
money, and that she as a woman had no attraction for me. He
believed&mdash;and there he was justified&mdash;that if I could
not marry her I had no interest in detaining her, and engaged
Homo to follow him around with a special licence. He timed
everything too well for my comfort."</p>

<p>Milsom shifted round and peered anxiously at his
companion.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" he asked. "It was only by a fluke that he
made it in time."</p>

<p>"That isn't what I mean. It is the fact that he knew that
every second was vital, that he guessed I was keen on a quick
marriage and that to forestall me he carried his (as he thought)
pseudo-clergyman with him so that he need not lose a minute:
these are the disturbing factors."</p>

<p>"I don't see it," said Milsom, "the fellow's a crook, all
these Yankee detectives are grafters. He saw a chance of a big
rake off and took it, fifty-fifty of a million fortune is fine
commission!"</p>

<p>"You're wrong. I'd like to think as you do. Man! Can't you
see that his every action proves that he knows all about the
Green Rust?"</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>Milsom sat up.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;what makes you say that?"</p>

<p>"It's clear enough. He has already some idea of the scheme.
He has been pumping old Heyler; he even secured a sample of the
stuff&mdash;it was a faulty cultivation, but it might have been
enough for him. He surmised that I had a special use for old
Millinborn's money and why I was in a hurry to get it."</p>

<p>The silence which followed lasted several minutes.</p>

<p>"Does anybody except Beale know? If you settled him...?"</p>

<p>"We should have to finish him to-night" said van Heerden,
"that is what I have been thinking about all day."</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p>"Well, why not?" asked Milsom, "it is all one to me. The
stake is worth a little extra risk."</p>

<p>"It must be done before he finds the Paddington place; that
is the danger which haunts me." Van Heerden was uneasy, and he
had lost the note of calm assurance which ordinarily
characterized his speech. "There is sufficient evidence there to
spoil everything."</p>

<p>"There is that," breathed Milsom, "it was madness to go on.
You have all the stuff you want, you could have closed down the
factory a week ago."</p>

<p>"I must have a margin of safety&mdash;besides, how could I do
anything else? I was nearly broke and any sign of closing down
would have brought my hungry workers to Krooman Mansions."</p>

<p>"That's true," agreed the other, "I've had to stall 'em off,
but I didn't know that it was because you were broke. It seemed
to me just a natural reluctance to part with good money."</p>

<p>Further conversation was arrested by the sudden stoppage of
the car. Van Heerden peered through the window ahead and caught
a glimpse of a red lamp.</p>

<p>"It is all right," he said, "this must be Putney Common, and
I told Gregory to meet me with any news."</p>

<p>A man came into the rays of the head-lamp and passed to the
door.</p>

<p>"Well," asked the doctor, "is there any trouble?"</p>

<p>"I saw the green lamp on the bonnet," said Gregory (Milsom no
longer wondered how the man had recognized the car from the
score of others which pass over the common), "there is no news
of importance."</p>

<p>"Where is Beale?"</p>

<p>"At the old man's hotel. He has been there all day."</p>

<p>"Has he made any further visits to the police?"</p>

<p>"He was at Scotland Yard this afternoon."</p>

<p>"And the young lady?"</p>

<p>"One of the waiters at the hotel, a friend of mine, told me
that she is much better. She has had two doctors."</p>

<p>"And still lives?" said the cynical Milsom. "That makes four
doctors she has seen in two days."</p>

<p>Van Heerden leant out of the car window and lowered his
voice. "The Fraulein Glaum, you saw her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I told her that she must not come to your laboratory
again until you sent for her. She asked when you leave."</p>

<p>"That she must not know, Gregory&mdash;please remember."</p>

<p>He withdrew his head, tapped at the window and the car moved
on.</p>

<p>"There's another problem for you, van Heerden,' said Milsom
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"What?" demanded the other sharply.</p>

<p>"Hilda Glaum. I've only seen the girl twice or so, but she
adores you. What are you going to do with her?"</p>

<p>Van Heerden lit a cigarette, and in the play of the flame
Milsom saw him smiling.</p>

<p>"She comes on after me," he said, "by which I mean that I
have a place for her in my country, but not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not the sort of place she expects," finished Milsom bluntly.
"You may have trouble there."</p>

<p>"Bah!"</p>

<p>"That's foolish," said Milsom, "the convict establishments of
England are filled with men who said 'Bah' when they were warned
against jealous women. If," he went on, "if you could eliminate
jealousy from the human outfit, you'd have half the prison
warders of England unemployed."</p>

<p>"Hilda is a good girl," said the other complacently, "she is
also a good German girl, and in Germany women know their place
in the system. She will be satisfied with what I give her."</p>

<p>"There aren't any women like that," said Milsom with
decision, and the subject dropped.</p>

<p>The car stopped near the Marble Arch to put down Milsom, and
van Heerden continued his journey alone, reaching his apartments
a little before midnight. As he stepped out of the car a man
strolled across the street. It was Beale's watcher. Van Heerden
looked round with a smile, realizing the significance of this
nonchalant figure, and passed through the lobby and up the
stairs.</p>

<p>He had left his lights full on for the benefit of watchers,
and the hall-lamp glowed convincingly through the fanlight.
Beale's flat was in darkness, and a slip of paper fastened to
the door gave his address. The doctor let himself into his own
rooms, closed the door, switched out the light and stepped into
his bureau.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said angrily, "what are you doing here?&mdash;I
told you not to come."</p>

<p>The girl who was sitting at the table and who now rose to
meet him was breathless, and he read trouble in her face. He
could have read pride there, too, that she had so well served
the man whom she idolized as a god.</p>

<p>"I've got him, I've got him, Julius!"</p>

<p>"Got him! Got whom?" he asked, with a frown.</p>

<p>"Beale!" she said eagerly, "the great Beale!"</p>

<p>She gurgled with hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>"He came to me, he was going to arrest me to-night, but I got
him."</p>

<p>"Sit down," he said firmly, "and try to be coherent, Hilda.
Who came to you?"</p>

<p>"Beale. He came to my boarding-house and wanted to know where
you had taken Oliva Cresswell. Have you taken her?" she asked
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said.</p>

<p>"He came to me full of arrogance and threats. He was going to
have me arrested, Julius, because of those letters which I gave
you. But I didn't worry about myself, Julius. It was all for you
that I thought. The thought that you, my dear, great man, should
be put in one of these horrible English prisons&mdash;oh,
Julius!"</p>

<p>She rose, her eyes filled with tears, but he stood over her,
laid his hands on her shoulders and pressed her back.</p>

<p>"Now, now. You must tell me everything. This is very serious.
What happened then?"</p>

<p>"He wanted me to take him to one of the places."</p>

<p>"One of what places?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't know. He only said that he knew that you had other
houses&mdash;I don't even know that he said that, but that was
the impression that he gave me, that he knew you were to be
found somewhere."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"And so I thought and I thought," said the girl, her hands
clasped in front of her, her eyes looking up into his, "and I
prayed God would give me some idea to help you. And then the
scheme came to me, Julius. I said I would lead him to you."</p>

<p>"You said you would lead him to me?" he said steadily, "and
where did you lead him?"</p>

<p>"To the factory in Paddington," she said.</p>

<p>"There!" he stared at her.</p>

<p>"Wait, wait, wait!" she said, "oh, please don't blame me! I
took him into the passage with the doors. I borrowed his light,
and after we had passed and locked the second door I slipped
through the third and slammed it in his face."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is there! Caught! Oh, Julius, did I do well? Please don't
be angry with me! I was so afraid for you!"</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not ten minutes, perhaps five minutes, I don't know. I have
no knowledge of time. I came straight back to see you."</p>

<p>He stood by the table, gnawing his finger, his head bowed in
concentrated thought.</p>

<p>"There, of all places!" he muttered; "there, of all
places!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Julius, I did my best," she said tearfully.</p>

<p>He looked down at her with a little sneer.</p>

<p>"Of course you did your best. You're a woman and you haven't
brains."</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You thought!" he sneered. "Who told you you could think? You
fool! Don't you know it was a bluff, that he could no more
arrest me than I could arrest him? Don't you realize&mdash;did
he know you were in the habit of coming here?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said van Heerden with a bitter laugh. "He
knows you are in love with me and he played upon your fears. You
poor little fool! Don't cry or I shall do something unpleasant.
There, there. Help yourself to some wine, you'll find it in the
tantalus."</p>

<p>He strode up and down the room. "There's nothing to be done
but to settle accounts with Mr. Beale," he said grimly. "Do you
think he was watched?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no, Julius "&mdash;she checked her sobs&mdash;"I was
so careful."</p>

<p>She gave him a description of the journey and the precautions
she had taken.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you're not such a fool after all."</p>

<p>He unlocked a drawer in his desk and took out a long-barrelled
Browning pistol, withdrew the magazine from the butt,
examined and replaced it, and slipped back the cover.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I must settle accounts with this gentleman, but
I don't want to use this," he added thoughtfully, as he pushed
up the safety-catch and dropped the weapon in his pocket; "we
might be able to gas him. Anyway, you can do no more good or
harm," he said cynically.</p>

<p>She was speechless, her hands, clasped tightly at her breast,
covered a damp ball of handkerchief, and her tear-stained face
was upturned to his.</p>

<p>"Now, dry your face." He stooped and kissed her lightly on
the cheek. "Perhaps what you have done is the best after all.
Who knows? Anyway," he said, speaking his thoughts aloud, "Beale
knows about the Green Rust and it can't be very long before I
have to go to earth, but only for a little time, my Hilda." He
smiled, showing his white teeth, but it was not a pleasant
smile, "only for a little time, and then," he threw up his arms,
"we shall be rich beyond the dreams of Frankfurt."</p>

<p>"You will succeed, I know you will succeed, Julius," she
breathed, "if I could only help you! If you would only tell me
what you are doing! What is the Green Rust? Is it some wonderful
new explosive?"</p>

<p>"Dry your face and go home," he said shortly, "you will find
a detective outside the door watching you, but I do not think he
will follow you."</p>

<p>He dismissed the girl and followed her after an interval of
time, striding boldly past the shadow and gaining the cab-stand
in Shaftesbury Avenue without, so far as he could see, being
followed. But he dismissed the cab in the neighbourhood of Baker
Street and continued his journey on foot. He opened the little
door leading into the yard but did not follow the same direction
as the girl had led Stanford Beale. It was through another door
that he entered the vault, which at one time had been the
innocent repository of bubbling life and was now the factory
where men worked diligently for the destruction of their
fellows.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; THE GREEN RUST
FACTORY</a></h2>

<p class="first">STANFORD BEALE spent a thoughtful three minutes
in the darkness of the cellar passage to which Hilda Glaum had
led him and then he began a careful search of his pockets. He
carried a little silver cigar-lighter, which had fortunately
been charged with petrol that afternoon, and this afforded him a
beam of adequate means to take note of his surroundings.</p>

<p>The space between the two locked doors was ten feet, the
width of the passage three, the height about seven feet. The
roof, as he had already noted, was vaulted. Now he saw that
along the centre ran a strip of beading. There had evidently
been an electric light installation here, probably before the
new owners took possession, for at intervals was a socket for an
electric bulb. The new occupants had covered these and the rest
of the wall with whitewash, and yet the beading and the electric
fittings looked comparatively new. One wall, that on his left as
he had come in, revealed nothing under his close inspection, but
on the right wall, midway between the two doors, there had been
a notice painted in white letters on a black background, and
this showed faintly through the thick coating of distemper which
had been applied. He damped a handkerchief with his tongue and
rubbed away some of the whitewash where the letters were least
legible and read:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign" style="margin-left:46%; text-align:left">
AID<br>
<u>LTER</u><br>
ULANCE &amp;<br>
T AID.</p>

<br>

<p>This was evidently half an inscription which had been cut off
exactly in the middle. To the left there was no sign of
lettering. He puzzled the letters for a few moments before he
came to an understanding.</p>

<p>"Air-raid shelter. Ambulance and first aid!" he read.</p>

<p>So that explained the new electric fittings. It was one of
those underground cellars which had been ferreted out by the
Municipality or the Government for the shelter of the people in
the neighbourhood during air-raids in the Great War. Evidently
there was extensive accommodation here, since this was also an
ambulance post. Faintly discernible beneath the letters was a
painted white hand which pointed downward. What had happened to
the other half of the inscription? Obviously it had been painted
on the door leading into the first-aid room and as obviously
that door had been removed and had been bricked up. In the light
of this discovery he made a more careful inspection of the wall
to the left. For the space of four feet the brickwork was new.
He tapped it. It sounded hollow. Pressing his back against the
opposite wall to give him leverage he put his foot against the
new brickwork and pushed.</p>

<p>He knew that the class of workmanship which was put into this
kind of job was not of the best, that only one layer of brick
was applied, and it was a mechanical fact that pressure applied
to the centre of new work would produce a collapse.</p>

<p>At the first push he felt the wall sag. Releasing his
pressure it came back. This time he put both feet against the
wall and bracing his shoulders he put every ounce of strength in
his body into a mighty heave. The next second he was lying on
his back. The greater part of the wall had collapsed. He was
curious enough to examine the work he had demolished. It had
evidently been done by amateurs, and the whitewash which had
been thickly applied to the passage was explained.</p>

<p>A current of fresh air came to meet him as he stepped
gingerly across the debris. A flight of six stone steps led down
to a small room containing a sink and a water supply, two camp
beds which had evidently been part of the ambulance equipment
and which the new owners had not thought necessary to remove,
and a broken chair. The room was still littered with the
paraphernalia of first-aid. He found odd ends of bandages, empty
medicine bottles and a broken glass measure on the shelf above
the sink.</p>

<p>What interested him more was a door which he had not dared to
hope he would find. It was bolted on his side, and when he had
slid this back he discovered to his relief that it was not
locked. He opened it carefully, first extinguishing his light.
Beyond the door was darkness and he snapped back the light
again. The room led to another, likewise empty. There were a
number of shelves, a few old wine-bins, a score of empty
bottles, but nothing else. At the far corner was yet another
door, also bolted on the inside. Evidently van Heerden did not
intend this part of the vault to be used.</p>

<p>He looked at the lock and found it was broken. He must be
approaching the main workroom in this new factory, and it was
necessary to proceed with caution. He took out his revolver,
spun the cylinder and thrust it under his waistcoat, the butt
ready to his hand. The drawing of the bolts was a long business.
He could not afford to risk detection at this hour, and could
only move them by a fraction of an inch at a time. Presently his
work was done and he pulled the door cautiously.</p>

<p>Instantly there appeared between door and jamb a bright green
line of light. He dare not move it any farther, for he heard now
the shuffle of feet, and occasionally the sound of hollow
voices, muffled and indistinguishable. In that light the opening
of the door would be seen, perhaps by a dozen pair of eyes. For
all he knew every man in that room might be facing his way. He
had expected to hear the noise of machinery, but beyond the
strangled voices, occasionally the click of glass against glass
and the shuff-shuff-shuff of slippered feet crossing the floor,
he heard nothing.</p>

<p>He pulled the door another quarter of an inch and glued his
eye to the crack. At this angle he could only see one of the
walls of the big vault and the end of a long vapour-lamp which
stood in one of the cornices and which supplied the ghastly
light. But presently he saw something which filled him with
hope. Against the wall was a high shadow which even the overhead
lamp did not wholly neutralize. It was an irregular shadow such
as a stack of boxes might make, and it occurred to him that
perhaps beyond his range of vision there was a barricade of
empty cases which hid the door from the rest of the room.</p>

<p>He spent nearly three-quarters of an hour taking a bearing
based upon the problematical position of the lights, the height
and density of the box screen and then boldly and rapidly opened
the door, stepped through and closed it behind him. His
calculations had been accurate. He found himself in a room, the
extent of which he could only conjecture. What, however,
interested him mostly was the accuracy of his calculation that
the door was hidden. An "L"-shaped stack of crates was piled
within two feet of the ceiling, and formed a little lobby to
anybody entering the vault the way Beale had come. They were
stacked neatly and methodically, and with the exception of two
larger packing-cases which formed the "corner stone" the barrier
was made of a large number of small boxes about ten inches
square.</p>

<p>There was a small step-ladder, evidently used by the person
whose business it was to keep this stack in order. Beale lifted
it noiselessly, planted it against the corner and mounted
cautiously.</p>

<p>He saw a large, broad chamber, its groined roof supported by
six squat stone pillars. Light came not only from mercurial
lamps affixed to the ceiling, but from others suspended above
the three rows of benches which ran the length of the room.</p>

<p>Mercurial lamps do not give a green light, as he knew, but a
violet light, and the green effect was produced by shades of
something which Beale thought was yellow silk, but which he
afterwards discovered was tinted mica.</p>

<p>At intervals along the benches sat white-clad figures, their
faces hidden behind rubber masks, their hands covered with
gloves. In front of each man was a small microscope under a
glass shade, a pair of balances and a rack filled with shallow
porcelain trays. Evidently the work on which they were engaged
did not endanger their eyesight, for the eye-pieces in the
masks were innocent of protective covering, a circumstance which
added to the hideous animal-like appearance of the men. They all
looked alike in their uniform garb, but one figure alone Beale
recognized. There was no mistaking the stumpy form and the big
head of the Herr Professor, whose appearance in Oliva
Cresswell's room had so terrified that young lady.</p>

<p>He had expected to see him, for he knew that this old German,
poverty-stricken and ill-favoured, had been roped in by van
Heerden, and Beale, who pitied the old man, had been engaged for
a fortnight in trying to worm from the ex-professor of chemistry
at the University of Heidelberg the location of van Heerden's
secret laboratory. His efforts had been unsuccessful. There was
a streak of loyalty in the old man, which had excited an
irritable admiration in the detective but had produced nothing
more.</p>

<p>Beale's eyes followed the benches and took in every detail.
Some of the men were evidently engaged in tests, and remained
all the time with their eyes glued to their microscopes. Others
were looking into their porcelain trays and stirring the
contents with glass rods, now and again transferring something
to a glass slide which was placed on the microscope and
earnestly examined.</p>

<p>Beale was conscious of a faint musty odour permeating the
air, an indescribable earthy smell with a tang to it which made
the delicate membrane of the nostrils smart and ache. He tied
his handkerchief over his nose and mouth before he took another
peep. Only part of the room was visible from his post of
observation. What was going on immediately beneath the far side
of the screen he could only conjecture. But he saw enough to
convince him that this was the principal factory, from whence
van Heerden was distilling the poison with which he planned
humanity's death.</p>

<p>Some of the workers were filling and sealing small test-tubes
with the contents of dishes. These tubes were extraordinarily
delicate of structure, and Beale saw at least three crumble and
shiver in the hands of the fillers.</p>

<p>Every bench held a hundred or so of these tubes and a covered
gas-jet for heating the wax. The work went on methodically,
with very little conversation between the masked figures (he saw
that the masks covered the heads of the chemists so that not a
vestige of hair showed), and only occasionally did one of them
leave his seat and disappear through a door at the far end of
the room, which apparently led to a canteen.</p>

<p>Evidently the fumes against which they were protected were
not virulent, for some of the men stripped their masks as soon
as they left their benches.</p>

<p>For half an hour he watched, and in the course of that time
saw the process of filling the small boxes which formed his
barrier and hiding-place with the sealed tubes. He observed the
care with which the fragile tubes were placed in their beds of
cotton wool, and had a glimpse of the lined interior of one of
the boxes. He was on the point of lifting down a box to make a
more thorough examination when he heard a quavering voice
beneath him.</p>

<p>"What you do here&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Under the step-ladder was one of the workers who had slipped
noiselessly round the corner of the pile and now stood,
grotesque and menacing, his uncovered eyes glowering at the
intruder, the black barrel of his Browning pistol covering the
detective's heart.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, colonel," said Beale softly. "I'll come
down."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap25" id="chap25">XXV. &mdash; THE LAST MAN AT
THE BENCH</a></h2>

<p class="first">AFTER all, it was for the best&mdash;van
Heerden could almost see the hand of Providence in this
deliverance of his enemy into his power. There must be a
settlement with Beale, that play-acting drunkard, who had so
deceived him at first.</p>

<p>Dr. van Heerden could admire the ingenuity of his enemy and
could kill him. He was a man whose mental poise permitted the
paradox of detached attachments. At first he had regarded
Stanford Beale as a smart police officer, the sort of man whom
Pinkerton and Burns turn out by the score. Shrewd, assertive,
indefatigable, such men piece together the scattered mosaics of
humdrum crimes, and by their mechanical patience produce for the
satisfaction of courts sufficient of the piece to reveal the
design. They figure in divorce suits, in financial swindles and
occasionally in more serious cases.</p>

<p>Van Heerden knew instinctively their limitations and had too
hastily placed Beale in a lower category than he deserved. Van
Heerden came to his workroom by way of the buffet which he had
established for the use of his employees. As he shut the steel
door behind him he saw Milsom standing at the rough wooden
sideboard which served as bar and table for the workers.</p>

<p>"This is an unexpected pleasure," said Milsom, and then
quickly, as he read the other's face: "Anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"If the fact that the cleverest policeman in America or
England is at present on the premises can be so described, then
everything is wrong," said van Heerden, and helped himself to a
drink.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;in the laboratory?" demanded Milsom, fear in his
eyes. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said the other, and gave the story as he had
heard it from Hilda Glaum.</p>

<p>"He's in the old passage, eh?" said Milsom, thoughtfully,
"well there's no reason why he should get out&mdash;alive."</p>

<p>"He won't," said the other.</p>

<p>"Was he followed&mdash;you saw nobody outside?"</p>

<p>"We have nothing to fear on that score. He's working on his
own."</p>

<p>Milsom grunted.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do with him?"</p>

<p>"Gas him," said van Heerden, "he is certain to have a
gun."</p>

<p>Milsom nodded.</p>

<p>"Wait until the men have gone. I let them go at three&mdash;a
few at a time, and it wants half an hour to that. He can wait.
He's safe where he is. Why didn't Hilda tell me? I never even
saw her."</p>

<p>"She went straight up from the old passage&mdash;through the
men's door&mdash;she didn't trust you probably."</p>

<p>Milsom smiled wryly. Though he controlled these works and
knew half the doctor's secrets, he suspected that the quantity
of van Heerden's trust was not greatly in excess of his
girl's.</p>

<p>"We'll wait," he said again, "there's no hurry and, anyway, I
want to see you about old man Heyler."</p>

<p>"Von Heyler? I thought you were rid of him?" said van Heerden
in surprise, "that is the old fool that Beale has been after. He
has been trying to suck him dry, and has had two interviews with
him. I told you to send him to Deans Folly. Bridgers would have
taken care of him."</p>

<p>"Bridgers can look after nothing," said Milsom.</p>

<p>His eyes roved along the benches and stopped at a worker at
the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>"He's quiet to-night," he said, "that fellow is too full of
himself for my liking. Earlier in the evening before I arrived
he pulled a gun on Schultz. He's too full of gun-play that
fellow&mdash;excuse the idiom, but I was in the same tailor's
shop at Portland Gaol as Ned Garrand, the Yankee bank-smasher."</p>

<p>Van Heerden made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"About old Heyler," Milsom went on, "I know you think he's
dangerous, so I've kept him here. There's a room where he can
sleep, and he can take all the exercise he wants at night. But
the old fool is restless&mdash;he's been asking me what is the
object of his work."</p>

<p>"He's difficult. Twice he has nearly betrayed me. As I told
you in the car, I gave him some experimental work to do and he
brought the result to me&mdash;that was the sample which fell
into Beale's hands."</p>

<p>"Mr. Beale is certainly a danger," said Milsom
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Van Heerden made a move toward the laboratory, but Milsom's
big hand detained him.</p>

<p>"One minute, van Heerden," he said, "whilst you're here you'd
better decide&mdash;when do we start dismantling? I've got to
find some excuse to send these fellows away."</p>

<p>Van Heerden thought.</p>

<p>"In two days," he said, "that will give you time to clear.
You can send the men&mdash;well, send them to Scotland, some
out-of-the-way place where news doesn't travel. Tell them we're
opening a new factory, and put them up at the local hotel."</p>

<p>Milsom inclined his head.</p>

<p>"That sounds easy," he said, "I could take charge of them
until the time came to skip. One can get a boat at
Greenock."</p>

<p>"I shall miss you," said van Heerden frankly, "you were
necessary to me, Milsom. You're the driving force I wanted, and
the only man of my class and calibre I can ever expect to meet,
one who would go into this business with me."</p>

<p>They had reached the big vault and van Heerden stood
regarding the scene of mental activity with something
approaching complacency.</p>

<p>"There is a billion in process of creation," he said.</p>

<p>"I could never think in more than six figures," said Milsom,
"and it is only under your cheering influence that I can stretch
to seven. I am going to live in the Argentine, van Heerden. A
house on a hill&mdash;" The other shivered, but Milsom went on.
"A gorgeous palace of a house, alive with servants. A string
band, a perfectly equipped laboratory where I can indulge my
passion for research, a high-powered auto, wine of the rarest
&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>Van Heerden looked at his companion curiously.</p>

<p>"That appeals to you, does it? For me, the control of
finance. Endless schemes of fortune; endless smashings of
rivals, railways, ships, great industries juggled and
shuffled&mdash;that is the life I plan."</p>

<p>"Fine!" said the other laconically.</p>

<p>They walked to a bench and the worker looked up and took off
his mask.</p>

<p>He was an old man, and grinned toothlessly at van
Heerden.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Signor Doctor," he said in Italian, "Science
is long and life is short, signor."</p>

<p>He chuckled and, resuming his mask, returned to his work,
ignoring the two men as though they had no existence.</p>

<p>"A little mad, old Castelli," said Milsom, "that's his one
little piece&mdash;what crooked thing has he done?"</p>

<p>"None that I know," said the other carelessly; "he lost his
wife and two daughters in the Messina earthquake. I picked him
up cheap. He's a useful chemist."</p>

<p>They walked from bench to bench, but van Heerden's eyes
continuously strayed to the door, behind which he pictured a
caged Stanford Beale, awaiting his doom. The men were beginning
to depart now. One by one they covered their instruments and
their trays, slipped off their masks and overalls and
disappeared through the door, upon which van Heerden's gaze was
so often fixed. Their exit, however, would not take them near
Beale's prison. A few paces along the corridor was another
passage leading to the yard above, and it was by this way that
Hilda Glaum had sped to the doctor's room.</p>

<p>Presently all were gone save one industrious worker, who sat
peering through the eye-piece of his microscope, immovable.</p>

<p>"That's our friend Bridgers," said Milsom, "he's all lit up
with the alkaloid of Erythroxylon Coca&mdash;Well, Bridgers,
nearly finished?"</p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted the man without turning.</p>

<p>Milsom shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"We must let him finish what he's doing. He is quite
oblivious to the presence of anybody when he has these fits of
industry. By the way, the passing of our dear enemy"&mdash;he
jerked his head to the passage door&mdash;"will make no change
in your plans?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"You have no great anxiety to marry the widow?"</p>

<p>"None," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"And she isn't a widow yet."</p>

<p>It was not Milsom who spoke, but the man at the bench, the
industrious worker whose eye was still at the microscope.</p>

<p>"Keep your comments to yourself," said van Heerden angrily,
"finish your work and get out."</p>

<p>"I've finished."</p>

<p>The worker rose slowly and loosening the tapes of his mask
pulled it on.</p>

<p>"My name is Beale," he said calmly, "I think we've met
before. Don't move, Milsom, unless you want to save
living-expenses&mdash;I'm a fairly quick shot when I'm
annoyed."</p>

<p>Stanford Beale pushed back the microscope and seated himself
on the edge of the bench.</p>

<p>"You addressed me as Bridgers," he said, "you will find Mr.
Bridgers in a room behind that stack of boxes. The fact is he
surprised me spying and was all for shooting me up, but I
induced him to come into my private office, so to speak, and the
rest was easy&mdash;he dopes, doesn't he? He hadn't the strength
of a rat. However, that is all beside the point; Dr. van
Heerden, what have you to say against my arresting you out of
hand on a conspiracy charge?"</p>

<p>Van Heerden smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>"There are many things I can say," he said. "In the first
place, you have no authority to arrest anybody. You're not a
police officer but only an American amateur."</p>

<p>"American, yes; but amateur, no," said Beale gently. "As to
the authority, why I guess I can arrest you first and get the
authority after."</p>

<p>"On what charge?" demanded Milsom, "there is nothing secret
about this place, except Doctor van Heerden's association with
it&mdash;a professional man is debarred from mixing in
commercial affairs. Is it a crime to run a&mdash;" He looked to
van Heerden.</p>

<p>"A germicide factory," said van Heerden promptly.</p>

<p>"Suppose I know the character of this laboratory?" asked
Beale quietly.</p>

<p>"Carry that kind of story to the police and see what steps
they will take," said van Heerden scornfully. "My dear Mr.
Beale, as I have told you once before, you have been reading too
much exciting detective fiction."</p>

<p>"Very likely," he said, "but anyhow the little story that
enthralls me just now is called the Green Terror, and I'm
looking to you to supply a few of the missing pages. And I think
you'll do it."</p>

<p>The doctor was lighting a cigarette, and he looked at the
other over the flaring match with a gleam of malicious amusement
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Your romantic fancies would exasperate me, but for your
evident sincerity. Having stolen my bride you seem anxious to
steal my reputation," he said mockingly.</p>

<p>"That," said Beale, slipping off the bench and standing,
hands on hips, before the doctor, "would take a bit of finding.
I tell you, van Heerden, that I'm going to call your bluff. I
shall place this factory in the hands of the police, and I am
going to call in the greatest scientists in England, France and
America, to prove the charge I shall make against you on the
strength of this!"</p>

<p>He held up between his forefinger and thumb a crystal tube,
filled to its seal with something that looked like green
sawdust.</p>

<p>"The world, the sceptical world, shall know the hell you are
preparing for them." Stanford Beale's voice trembled with
passion and his face was dark with the thought of a crime so
monstrous that even the outrageous treatment of a woman who was
more to him than all the world was for the moment obliterated
from his mind in the contemplation of the danger which
threatened humanity.</p>

<p>"You say that the police and even the government of this
country will dismiss my charge as being too fantastic for
belief. You shall have the satisfaction of knowing that you are
right. They think I am mad&mdash;but I will convince them! In
this tube lies the destruction of all your fondest dreams, van
Heerden. To realize those dreams you have murdered two men. For
these you killed John Millinborn and the man Predeaux. But you
shall not&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Bang!"</i></p>

<p>The explosion roared thunderously in the confined space of
the vault. Beale felt the wind of the bullet and turned, pistol
upraised.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap26" id="chap26">XXVI. &mdash; THE SECRET OF THE
GREEN RUST</a></h2>

<p class="first">A DISHEVELLED figure stood by the boxes,
revolver in hand&mdash;it was Bridgers, the man he had left
strapped and bound in the "ambulance-room," and Beale cursed
the folly which had induced him to leave the revolver
behind.</p>

<p>"I'll fix you&mdash;you brute!" screamed Bridgers, "get away
from him&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>Beale's hand flew up, a pencil of flame quivered, and again
the vault trembled to the deafening report.</p>

<p>But Bridgers had dropped to cover. Again he shot, this time
with unexpected effect. The bullet struck the fuse-box on the
opposite wall and all the lights went out.</p>

<p>Beale was still holding the glass tube, and this Milsom had
seen. Quick as thought he hurled himself upon the detective, his
big, powerful hands gripped the other's wrist and wrenched it
round.</p>

<p>Beale set his teeth and manoeuvred for a lock grip, but he
was badly placed, pressed as he was against the edge of the
bench. He felt van Heerden's fingers clawing at his hand and the
tube was torn away. Then somebody pulled the revolver from the
other hand and there was a scamper of feet. He groped his way
through the blackness and ran into the pile of boxes. A bullet
whizzed past him from the half-crazy Bridgers, but that was a
risk he had to take. He heard the squeak of an opening door and
stumbled blindly in its direction. Presently he found it. He had
watched the other men go out and discovered the steps&mdash;two
minutes later he was in the street.</p>

<p>There was no sign of either of the two men. He found a
policeman after he had walked half a mile, but that intelligent
officer could not leave his beat and advised him to go to the
police station. It was an excellent suggestion, for although the
sergeant on duty was wholly unresponsive there was a telephone,
and at the end of the telephone in his little Haymarket flat, a
Superintendent McNorton, the mention of whose very name
galvanized the police office to activity.</p>

<p>"I have found the factory I've been looking for, McNorton,"
said Beale. "I'll explain the whole thing to you in the morning.
What I want now is a search made of the premises."</p>

<p>"We can't do that without a magistrate's warrant," said
McNorton's voice, "but what we can do is to guard the premises
until the warrant is obtained. Ask the station sergeant to speak
on the 'phone&mdash;by the way, how is Miss Cresswell, better, I
hope?"</p>

<p>"Much better," said the young man shortly.</p>

<p>It was unbelievable that she could ever fill his heart with
the ache which came at the mention of her name.</p>

<p>He made way for the station sergeant and later accompanied
four men back to the laboratory. They found all the doors
closed. Beale scaled the wall but failed to find a way in. He
rejoined the sergeant on the other side of the wall.</p>

<p>"What is the name of this street?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Playbury Street, sir&mdash;this used to be Henderson's Wine
Vaults in my younger days."</p>

<p>Beale jotted down the address and finding a taxi drove back
to the police station, wearied and sick at heart.</p>

<p>He arrived in time to be a witness to a curious scene. In the
centre of the charge-room and facing the sergeant's desk was a
man of middle age, shabbily dressed, but bearing the indefinable
air of one who had seen better days. The grey hair was carefully
brushed from the familiar face and gave him that venerable
appearance which pale eyes and a pair of thin straight lips
(curled now in an amused smile) did their best to discount.</p>

<p>By his side stood his captor, a station detective, a bored
and apathetic man.</p>

<p>"It seems," the prisoner was saying, as Stanford Beale came
noiselessly into the room, "it seems that under this detestable
system of police espionage, a fellow may not even take a walk in
the cool of the morning."</p>

<p>His voice was that of an educated man, his drawling address
spoke of his confidence.</p>

<p>"Now look here, Parson," said the station sergeant, in that
friendly tone which the police adopt when dealing with their pet
criminals, "you know as well as I do that under the Prevention
of Crimes Act you, an old lag, are liable to be arrested if you
are seen in any suspicious circumstances&mdash;you oughtn't to
be wandering about the streets in the middle of the night, and
if you do, why you mustn't kick because you're
pinched&mdash;anything found on him. Smith?"</p>

<p>"No, sergeant&mdash;he was just mouching round, so I pulled
him in."</p>

<p>"Where are you living now. Parson?"</p>

<p>The man with extravagant care searched his pockets. "I have
inadvertently left my card-case with my coiner's outfit," he
said gravely, "but a wire addressed to the Doss House, Mine
Street, Paddington, will find me&mdash;but I don't think I
should try. At this moment I enjoy the protection of the law. In
four days' time I shall be on the ocean&mdash;why, Mr. Beale!"
Mr. Beale smiled.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Parson&mdash;I thought you had sailed to-day."</p>

<p>"The first-class berths are all taken and I will not travel
to Australia with the common herd." He turned to the astonished
sergeant. "Can I go&mdash;Mr. Beale will vouch for me?"</p>

<p>As he left the charge-room he beckoned the detective, and
when they were together in the street Beale found that all the
Parson's flippancy had departed.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I got you into that scrape," he said seriously. "I
ought to have been unfrocked, but I was sentenced for my first
crime under an assumed name. I was not attached to any church at
the time and my identity has never been discovered. Mr. Beale,"
he went on with a quizzical smile, "I have yet to commit my
ideal crime&mdash;the murder of a bishop who allows a curate to
marry a wife on sixty pounds a year." His face darkened, and
Beale found himself wondering at the contents of the tragic
years behind the man. Where was the wife...?</p>

<p>"But my private grievances against the world will not
interest you," Parson Homo resumed, "I only called you out
to&mdash;well, to ask your pardon."</p>

<p>"It was my own fault, Homo," said Beale quietly, and held out
his hand. "Good luck&mdash;there may be a life for you in the
new land."</p>

<p>He stood till the figure passed out of sight, then turned
wearily toward his own rooms. He went to his room and lay down
on his bed fully dressed. He was aroused from a troubled sleep
by the jangle of the 'phone. It was McNorton.</p>

<p>"Come down to Scotland House and see the
Assistant-Commissioner," he said, "he is very anxious to hear
more about this factory. He tells me that you have already given
him an outline of the plot."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I'll give you details&mdash;I'll be with you in
half an hour."</p>

<p>He had a bath and changed his clothes, and breakfast-less,
for the woman who waited on him and kept his flat and who
evidently thought his absence was likely to be a long one, had
not arrived. He drove to the grim grey building on the Thames
Embankment.</p>

<p>Assistant-Commissioner O'Donnell, a white-haired police
veteran, was waiting for him, and McNorton was in the
office.</p>

<p>"You look fagged," said the commissioner, "take that
chair&mdash;and you look hungry, too. Have you breakfasted?"</p>

<p>Beale shook his head with a smile.</p>

<p>"Get him something, McNorton&mdash;ring that bell. Don't
protest, my good fellow&mdash;I've had exactly the same kind of
nights as you've had, and I know that it is grub that counts
more than sleep."</p>

<p>He gave an order to an attendant and not until twenty minutes
later, when Beale had finished a surprisingly good meal in the
superintendent's room, did the commissioner allow the story to
be told.</p>

<p>"Now I'm ready," he said.</p>

<p>"I'll begin at the beginning," said Stanford Beale. "I was a
member of the United States Secret Service until after the war
when, at the request of Mr. Kitson, who is known to you, I came
to Europe to devote all my time to watching Miss Cresswell and
Doctor van Heerden. All that you know.</p>

<p>"One day when searching the doctor's rooms in his absence, my
object being to discover some evidence in relation to the
Millinborn murder, I found this."</p>

<p>He took a newspaper cutting from his pocket-book and laid it
on the table.</p>

<p>"It is from <i>El Imparcial</i>, a Spanish newspaper, and I will
translate it for you.</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">"'Thanks to the discretion and eminent genius
of Dr. Alphonso Romanes, the Chief Medical Officer of Vigo, the
farmers of the district have been spared a catastrophe much
lamentable' (I am translating literally). 'On Monday last, Seor
Don Marin Fernandez, of La Linea, discovered one of his fields
of corn had died in the night and was already in a condition of
rot. In alarm, he notified the Chief of Medicines at Vigo, and
Dr. Alphonso Romanes, with that zeal and alacrity which has
marked his acts, was quickly on the spot, accompanied by a
foreign scientist. Happily the learned and gentle doctor is a
bacteriologist superb. An examination of the dead corn, which
already emitted unpleasant odours, revealed the presence of a
new disease, the <i>orin verde</i> (green rust). By his orders
the field was burnt. Fortunately, the area was small and
dissociated from the other fields of Seor Fernardez by wide
zanzas. With the exception of two small pieces of the infected
corn, carried away by Dr. Romanes and the foreign
medical-cavalier, the pest was incinerated.'"</p>

<br>

<p>"The Foreign Medical-Cavalier," said Beale, "was Doctor van
Heerden. The date was 1915, when the doctor was taking his
summer holiday, and I have had no difficulty in tracing him. I
sent one of my men to Vigo to interview Doctor Romanes, who
remembers the circumstances perfectly. He himself had thought it
wisest to destroy the germ after carefully noting their
characteristics, and he expressed the anxious hope that his
whilom friend, van Heerden, had done the same. Van Heerden, of
course, did nothing of the sort. He has been assiduously
cultivating the germs in his laboratory. So far as I can
ascertain from Professor Heyler, an old German who was in van
Heerden's service and who seems a fairly honest man, the doctor
nearly lost the culture, and it was only by sending out small
quantities to various seedy scientists and getting them to
experiment in the cultivation of the germ under various
conditions that he found the medium in which they best flourish.
It is, I believe, fermented rye-flour, but I am not quite
sure."</p>

<p>"To what purpose do you suggest van Heerden will put his
cultivations?" asked the commissioner.</p>

<p>"I am coming to that. In the course of my inquiries and
searchings I found that he was collecting very accurate data
concerning the great wheatfields of the world. From the
particulars he was preparing I formed the idea that he intended,
and intends, sending an army of agents all over the world who,
at a given signal, will release the germs in the growing
wheat."</p>

<p>"But surely a few germs sprinkled on a great wheat-field such
as you find in America would do no more than local damage?"</p>

<p>Beale shook his head. "Mr. O'Donnell," he said soberly, "if I
broke a tube of that stuff in the corner of a ten-thousand-acre
field the whole field would be rotten in twenty-four hours! It
spreads from stalk to stalk with a rapidity that is amazing. One
germ multiples itself in a living cornfield a billion times in
twelve hours. It would not only be possible, but certain that
twenty of van Heerden's agents in America could destroy the
harvests of the United States in a week."</p>

<p>"But why should he do this&mdash;he is a German, you
say&mdash;and Germans do not engage in frightfulness unless they
see a dividend at the end of it."</p>

<p>"There is a dividend&mdash;a dividend of millions at the end
of it," said Beale, graver, "that much I know. I cannot tell you
any more yet. But I can say this: that up till yesterday van
Heerden was carrying on the work without the aid of his
Government. That is no longer the case. There is now a big
syndicate in existence to finance him, and the principal
shareholder is the German Government. He has already spent
thousands, money he has borrowed and money he has stolen. As a
side-line and sheerly to secure her money he carried off John
Millinborn's heiress with the object of forcing her into a
marriage."</p>

<p>The commissioner chewed the end of his cigar. "This is a
State matter and one on which I must consult the Home Office.
You tell me that the Foreign Office believe your story&mdash;of
course I do, too," he added quickly, "though it sounds wildly
improbable. Wait here." He took up his hat and went out.</p>

<p>"It is going to be a difficult business to convict van
Heerden," said the superintendent when his chief had gone, "you
see, in the English courts, motive must be proved to convict
before a jury, and there seems no motive except revenge. A jury
would take a lot of convincing that a man spent thousands of
pounds to avenge a wrong done to his country."</p>

<p>Beale had no answer to this. At the back of his mind he had a
dim idea of the sheer money value of the scheme, but he needed
other evidence than he possessed. The commissioner returned soon
after.</p>

<p>"I have been on the 'phone to the Under-Secretary, and we
will take action against van Heerden on the evidence the factory
offers. I'll put you in charge of the case, McNorton, you have
the search-warrant already? Good!"</p>

<p>He shook hands with Beale.</p>

<p>"You will make a European name over this, Mr. Beale," he
said.</p>

<p>"I hope Europe will have nothing more to talk about," said
Beale.</p>

<p>They passed back to McNorton's office.</p>

<p>"I'll come right along," said the superintendent. He was
taking his hat from a peg when he saw a closed envelope lying on
his desk.</p>

<p>"From the local police station," he said. "How long has this
been here?"</p>

<p>His clerk shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, sir&mdash;it has been there since I came
in."</p>

<p>"H'm&mdash;I must have overlooked it. Perhaps it is news from
your factory."</p>

<p>He tore it open, scanned the contents and swore.</p>

<p>"There goes your evidence, Beale," he said.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Beale quickly.</p>

<p>"The factory was burned to the ground in the early hours of
the morning," he said. "The fire started in the old wine vault
and the whole building has collapsed."</p>

<p>The detective stared out of the window.</p>

<p>"Can we arrest van Heerden on the evidence of Professor
Heyler?"</p>

<p>For answer McNorton handed him the letter. It ran;</p>

<br>

<p class="typewriter">"From Inspector-in-charge, S. Paddington,
to Supt. McNorton. Factory in Playbury St. under P.O. (Police
Observation) completely destroyed by fire, which broke out in
basement at 5.20 this morning. One body found, believed to be a
man named Heyler."</p>

<h2><a name="chap27" id="chap27">XXVII. &mdash; A SCHEME TO
STARVE THE WORLD</a></h2>

<p class="first">THERE is a menace about Monday morning which
few have escaped. It is a menace which in one guise or another
clouds hundreds of millions of pillows, gives to the golden
sunlight which filters through a billion panes the very hues and
character of jaundice. It is the menace of factory and workshop,
harsh prisons which shut men and women from the green fields and
the pleasant by-ways; the menace of new responsibilities to be
faced and new difficulties to be overcome. Into the space of
Monday morning drain the dregs of last week's commitments to
gather into stagnant pools upon the desks and benches of toiling
and scheming humanity. It is the end of the holiday, the foot of
the new hill whose crest is Saturday night and whose most
pleasant outlook is the Sunday to come.</p>

<p>Men go to their work reluctant and resentful and reach out
for the support which the lunch-hour brings. One o'clock in
London is about six o'clock in Chicago. Therefore the
significance of shoals of cablegrams which lay on the desks of
certain brokers was not wholly apparent until late in the
evening, and was not thoroughly understood until late on Tuesday
morning, when to other and greater shoals of cables came the
terse price-lists from the Board of Trade in Chicago, and on top
of all the wirelessed Press accounts for the sensational jump in
wheat.</p>

<p>"Wheat soaring," said one headline. "Frantic scenes in the
Pit," said another. "Wheat reaches famine price," blared a
third.</p>

<p>Beale passing through to Whitehall heard the shrill call of
the newsboys and caught the word "wheat." He snatched a paper
from the hands of a boy and read.</p>

<p>Every corn-market in the Northern Hemisphere was in a
condition of chaos. Prices were jumping to a figure beyond any
which the most stringent days of the war had produced. He
slipped into a telephone booth, gave a Treasury number and
McNorton answered.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the papers?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, but I've heard. You mean about the wheat boom?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the game has started."</p>

<p>"Where are you&mdash;wait for me, I'll join you." Three
minutes later McNorton appeared from the Whitehall end of
Scotland Yard. Beale hailed a cab and they drove to the hotel
together.</p>

<p>"Warrants have been issued for van Heerden and Milsom and the
girl Glaum," he said. "I expect we shall find the nest empty,
but I have sent men to all the railway stations&mdash;do you
think we've moved too late?"</p>

<p>"Everything depends on the system that van Heerden has
adopted," replied Beale, "he is the sort of man who would keep
everything in his own hands. If he has done that, and we catch
him, we may prevent a world catastrophe."</p>

<p>At the hotel they found Kitson waiting in the vestibule.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, "I gather that you've lost van Heerden, but
if the newspapers mean anything, his hand is down on the table.
Everybody is crazy here," he said, as he led the way to the
elevator, "I've just been speaking to the Under-Minister for
Agriculture&mdash;all Europe is scared. Now what is the story?"
he asked, when they were in his room.</p>

<p>He listened attentively and did not interrupt until Stanford
Beale had finished.</p>

<p>"That's big enough," he said. "I owe you an
apology&mdash;much as I was interested in Miss Cresswell, I
realize that her fate was as nothing beside the greater
issue."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" asked McNorton.</p>

<p>"The Wheat Panic? God knows. It may mean bread at a guinea a
pound&mdash;it is too early to judge."</p>

<p>The door was opened unceremoniously and a man strode in.
McNorton was the first to recognize the intruder and rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to interrupt you," said Lord Sevington&mdash;it
was the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain himself. "Well,
Beale, the fantastic story you told me seems in a fair way to
being realized."</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Kitson," introduced Stanford, and the
grey-haired statesman bowed.</p>

<p>"I sent for you, but decided I couldn't wait&mdash;so I came
myself. Ah, McNorton, what are the chances of catching van
Heerden?"</p>

<p>"No man has ever escaped from this country once his identity
was established," said the police chief hopefully.</p>

<p>"If we had taken Beale's advice we should have the gentleman
under lock and key," said the Foreign Minister, shaking his
head. "You probably know that Mr. Beale has been in
communication with the Foreign Office for some time?" he said,
addressing Kitson.</p>

<p>"I did not know," admitted the lawyer.</p>

<p>"We thought it was one of those brilliant stories which the
American newspaper reporter loves," smiled the minister.</p>

<p>"I don't quite get the commercial end of it," said Kitson.
"How does van Heerden benefit by destroying the crops of the
world?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't benefit, because the crops won't be destroyed,"
said the minister. "The South Russian crops are all right, the
German crops are intact&mdash;but are practically all mortgaged
to the German Government."</p>

<p>"The Government?"</p>

<p>"This morning the German Government have made two
announcements. The first is the commandeering of all the
standing crops, and at the same time the taking over of all
options on the sale of wheat. Great granaries are being
established all over Germany. The old Zeppelin sheds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" cried Kitson, and stared at Stanford Beale.
"That was the reason they took over the sheds?"</p>

<p>"A pretty good reason, too," said Beale, "storage is
everything in a crisis like this. What is the second
announcement, sir?"</p>

<p>"They prohibit the export of grain," said Lord Sevington,
"the whole of Germany is to be rationed for a year, bread is to
be supplied by the Government free of all cost to the people; in
this way Germany handles the surpluses for us to buy."</p>

<p>"What will she charge?"</p>

<p>"What she wishes. If van Heerden's scheme goes through, if
throughout the world the crops are destroyed and only that which
lies under Germany's hand is spared, what must we pay? Every
penny we have taken from Germany; every cent of her war costs
must be returned to her in exchange for wheat."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Why impossible? There is no limit to the price of rarities.
What is rarer than gold is more costly than gold. You who are in
the room are the only people in the world who know the secret of
the Green Rust, and I can speak frankly to you. I tell you that
we must either buy from Germany or make war on Germany, and the
latter course is impossible, and if it were possible would give
us no certainty of relief. We shall have to pay, Britain,
France, America, Italy&mdash;we shall have to pay. We shall pay
in gold, we may have to pay in battleships and material. Our
stocks of corn have been allowed to fall and to-day we have less
than a month's supply in England. Every producing country in the
world will stop exporting instantly, and they, too, with the
harvest nearly due, will be near the end of their stocks. Now
tell me, Mr. Beale, in your judgment, is it possible to save the
crops by local action?"</p>

<p>Beale shook his head.</p>

<p>"I doubt it," he said; "it would mean the mobilisation of
millions of men, the surrounding of all corn-tracts&mdash;and
even then I doubt if your protection would be efficacious. You
could send the stuff into the fields by a hundred methods. The
only thing to do is to catch van Heerden and stifle the scheme
at its fountain-head."</p>

<p>The Chief of the Foreign Ministry strode up and down the
room, his hands thrust into his pockets, his head upon his
breast.</p>

<p>"It means our holding out for twelve months," he said. "Can
we do it?"</p>

<p>"It means more than that, sir," said Beale quietly.</p>

<p>Lord Sevington stopped and faced him.</p>

<p>"More than that? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"It may mean a cornless world for a generation," said Beale.
"I have consulted the best authorities, and they agree that the
soil will be infected for ten years."</p>

<p>The four men looked at one another helplessly.</p>

<p>"Why," said Sevington, in awe, "the whole social and
industrial fabric of the world would crumble into dust. America
would be ruined for a hundred years, there would be deaths by
the million. It means the very end of civilization!"</p>

<p>Beale glanced from one to the other of the little group.</p>

<p>Sevington, with his hard old face set in harsh lines, a stony
sphinx of a man showing no other sign of his emotions than a mop
of ruffled hair.</p>

<p>Kitson, an old man and almost as hard of feature, yet of the
two more human, stood with pursed lip, his eyes fixed on the
floor, as if he were studying the geometrical pattern of the
parquet for future reference.</p>

<p>McNorton, big, red-faced and expressionless, save that his
mouth dropped and that his arms were tightly folded as if he
were hugging himself in a sheer ecstasy of pain. From the street
outside came the roar and rumble of London's traffic, the dull
murmur of countless voices and the shrill high-pitched whine of
a newsboy.</p>

<p>Men and women were buying newspapers and seeing no more in
the scare headlines than a newspaper sensation.</p>

<p>To-morrow they might read further and grow a little
uncomfortable, but for the moment they were only mildly
interested, and the majority would turn to the back page for the
list of "arrivals" at Lingfield.</p>

<p>"It is unbelievable," said Kitson. "I have exactly the same
feeling I had on August 1, 1914&mdash;that sensation of
unreality."</p>

<p>His voice seemed to arouse the Foreign Minister from the
meditation into which he had fallen, and he started.</p>

<p>"Beale," he said, "you have unlimited authority to
act&mdash;Mr. McNorton, you will go back to Scotland Yard and
ask the Chief Commissioner to attend at the office of the Privy
Seal. Mr. Beale will keep in touch with me all the time."</p>

<p>Without any formal leave-taking he made his exit, followed by
Superintendent McNorton.</p>

<p>"That's a badly rattled man," said Kitson shrewdly, "the
Government may fall on this news. What will you do?"</p>

<p>"Get van Heerden," said the other.</p>

<p>"It is the job of your life," said Kitson quietly, and Beale
knew within a quarter of an hour that the lawyer did not
exaggerate.</p>

<p>Van Heerden had disappeared with dramatic suddenness.
Detectives who visited his flat discovered that his personal
belongings had been removed in the early hours of the morning.
He had left with two trunks (which were afterwards found in a
cloak-room of a London railway terminus) and a companion who was
identified as Milsom. Whether the car had gone east or north,
south or west, nobody knew.</p>

<p>In the early editions of the evening newspapers, side by side
with the account of the panic scenes on 'Change was the
notice:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">"The Air Ministry announce the suspension of
Order 63 of Trans-Marine Flight Regulations. No aeroplane will
be allowed to cross the coastline by day or night without first
descending at a coast control station. Aerial patrols have
orders to force down any machine which does not obey the
'Descend' signal. This signal is now displayed at all coast
stations."</p>

<br>

<p>Every railway station in England, every port of embarkation,
were watched by police. The one photograph of van Heerden in
existence, thousands of copies of an excellent snapshot taken by
one of Beale's assistants, were distributed by aeroplane to
every district centre. At two o'clock Hilda Glaum was arrested
and conveyed to Bow Street. She showed neither surprise nor
resentment and offered no information as to van Heerden's
whereabouts.</p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon there were the usual crops of false
arrest and detention of perfectly innocent people, and at five
o'clock it was announced that all telegraphic communication with
the Continent and with the Western Hemisphere was suspended
until further notice.</p>

<p>Beale came back from Barking, whither he had gone to
interview a choleric commercial traveller who bore some facial
resemblance to van Heerden, and had been arrested in
consequence, and discovered that something like a Council of War
was being held in Kitson's private room.</p>

<p>McNorton and two of his assistants were present. There was an
Under-Secretary from the Foreign Office, a great scientist whose
services had been called upon, and a man whom he recognized as a
member of the Committee of the Corn Exchange. He shook his head
in answer to McNorton's inquiring glance, and would have taken
his seat at the table, but Kitson, who had risen on his
entrance, beckoned him to the window.</p>

<p>"We can do without you for a little while, Beale," he said,
lowering his voice. "There's somebody there," he jerked his head
to a door which led to another room of his suite, "who requires
an explanation, and I think your time will be so fully occupied
in the next few days that you had better seize this opportunity
whilst you have it."</p>

<p>"Miss Cresswell!" said Beale, in despair.</p>

<p>The old man nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"What does she know?"</p>

<p>"That is for you to discover," said Kitson gently, and pushed
him toward the door.</p>

<p>With a quaking heart he turned the knob and stepped guiltily
into the presence of the girl who in the eyes of the law was his
wife.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap28" id="chap28">XXVIII. &mdash; THE COMING OF
DR. MILSOM</a></h2>

<p class="first">SHE rose to meet him, and he stood spellbound,
still holding the handle of the door. It seemed that she had
taken on new qualities, a new and an ethereal grace. At the very
thought even of his technical possession of this smiling girl
who came forward to greet him, his heart thumped so loudly that
he felt she must hear it. She was pale, and there were dark
shadows under her eyes, but the hand that gripped his was firm
and warm and living.</p>

<p>"I have to thank you for much, Mr. Beale," she said. "Mr.
Kitson has told me that I owe my rescue to you."</p>

<p>"Did he?" he asked awkwardly, and wondered what else Kitson
had told her.</p>

<p>"I am trying to be very sensible, and I want you to help me,
because you are the most sensible man I know."</p>

<p>She went back to the lounge-chair where she had been sitting,
and pointed to another.</p>

<p>"It was horribly melodramatic, wasn't it? but I suppose the
life of a detective is full of melodrama."</p>

<p>"Oh, brimming over," he said. "If you keep very quiet I will
give you a resume of my most interesting cases," he said, making
a pathetic attempt to be flippant, and the girl detected
something of his insincerity.</p>

<p>"You have had a trying day," she said, with quick sympathy,
"have you arrested Doctor van Heerden?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am glad," she said.</p>

<p>"Glad?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Before he is arrested," she spoke with some hesitation, "I
want one little matter cleared up. I asked Mr. Kitson, but he
put me off and said you would tell me everything."</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked steadily.</p>

<p>She got up and went to her bag which stood upon a side-table,
opened it and took out something which she laid on the palm of
her hand. She came back with hand extended, and Beale looked at
the glittering object on her palm and was speechless.</p>

<p>"Do you see that?" she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded, having no words for the moment, for "that" was a
thin gold ring.</p>

<p>"It is a wedding ring," she said, "and I found it on my
finger when I recovered."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Beale blankly.</p>

<p>"Was I married?" she asked. He made two or three ineffectual
attempts to speak and ended by nodding.</p>

<p>"I feared so," she said quietly, "you see I recollect nothing
of what happened. The last thing I remembered was Doctor van
Heerden sitting beside me and putting something into my arm. It
hurt a little, but not very much, and I remember I spoke to him.
I think it was about you," a little colour came to her face, "or
perhaps he was speaking about you, I am not sure," she said
hurriedly; "I know that you came into it somehow, and that is
all I can recall."</p>

<p>"Nothing else?" he asked dismally.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she said.</p>

<p>"Try, try, try to remember," he urged her.</p>

<p>He realized he was being a pitiable coward and that he wanted
to shift the responsibility for the revelation upon her. She
smiled, and shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am sorry but I can't remember anything. Now you are going
to tell me."</p>

<p>He discovered that he was sitting on the edge of the chair
and that he was more nervous than he had ever been in his
life.</p>

<p>"So I am going to tell you," he said, in a hollow voice, "of
course I'll tell you. It is rather difficult, you
understand."</p>

<p>She looked at him kindly.</p>

<p>"I know it must be difficult for a man like you to speak of
your own achievements. But for once you are going to be
immodest," she laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," he began, "I knew van Heerden wanted to
marry you. I knew that all along. I guessed he wanted to marry
you for your money, because in the circumstance there was
nothing else he could want to marry you for," he added. "I
mean," he corrected himself hastily, "that money was the most
attractive thing to him."</p>

<p>"This doesn't sound very flattering," she smiled.</p>

<p>"I know I am being crude, but you will forgive me when you
learn what I have to say," he said huskily. "Van Heerden wanted
to marry you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he married me," she said, "and I am going to break that
marriage as soon as I possibly can."</p>

<p>"I know, I hope so," said Stanford Beale. "I believe it is
difficult, but I will do all I possibly can. Believe me, Miss
Cresswell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not Miss Cresswell any longer," she said with a wry
little face, "but please don't call me by my real name."</p>

<p>"I won't," he said fervently.</p>

<p>"You knew he wanted to marry me for my money and not for my
beauty or my accomplishments," she said, "and so you followed me
down to Deans Folly."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but I must explain. I know it will sound horrible
to you and you may have the lowest opinion of me, but I have got
to tell you."</p>

<p>He saw the look of alarm gather in her eyes and plunged into
his story.</p>

<p>"I thought that if you were already married van Heerden would
be satisfied and take no further steps against you."</p>

<p>"But I wasn't already married," she said, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Wait, wait, please," he begged, "keep that in your mind,
that I was satisfied van Heerden wanted you for your money, and
that if you were already married or even if you weren't and he
thought you were I could save you from dangers, the extent of
which even I do not know. And there was a man named Homo, a
crook. He had been a parson and had all the manner and style of
his profession. So I got a special licence in my own name."</p>

<p>"You?" she said breathlessly. "A marriage licence? To marry
me?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"And I took Homo with me in my search for you. I knew that I
should have a very small margin of time, and I thought if Homo
performed the ceremony and I could confront van Heerden with the
accomplished deed&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, I see," she said. "Oh, how splendid! And you went
through this mock ceremony! Where was I?"</p>

<p>"You were at the window," he said miserably.</p>

<p>"But how lovely! And you were outside and your parson with
the funny name&mdash;but that's delicious! So I wasn't married
at all and this is your ring." She picked it up with a mocking
light in her eyes, and held it out to him, but he shook his
head.</p>

<p>"You were married," he said, in a voice which was hardly
audible.</p>

<p>"Married? How?"</p>

<p>"Homo was not a fake! He was a real clergyman! And the
marriage was legal!"</p>

<p>They looked at one another without speaking. On the girl's
part there was nothing but pure amazement; but Stanford Beale
read horror, loathing, consternation and unforgiving wrath, and
waited, as the criminal waits for his sentence, upon her next
words.</p>

<p>"So I am really married&mdash;to you," she said
wonderingly.</p>

<p>"You will never forgive me, I know." He did not look at her
now. "My own excuse is that I did what I did because
I&mdash;wanted to save you. I might have sailed in with a gun
and shot them up. I might have waited my chance and broken into
the house. I might have taken a risk and surrounded the place
with police, but that would have meant delay. I didn't do the
normal things or take the normal view&mdash;I couldn't with
you."</p>

<p>He did not see the momentary tenderness in her eyes, because
he was not looking at her, and went on:</p>

<p>"That's the whole of the grisly story. Mr. Kitson will advise
you as to what steps you may take to free yourself. It was a
most horrible blunder, and it was all the more tragic because
you were the victim, you of all the persons in the
world...!"</p>

<p>She had put the ring down, and now she took it up again and
examined it curiously.</p>

<p>"It is rather&mdash;quaint, isn't it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, very."</p>

<p>He thought he heard a sob and looked up. She was laughing, at
first silently, then, as the humour of the thing seized her, her
laugh rang clear and he caught its infection.</p>

<p>"It's funny," she said at last, wiping her eyes, "there is a
humorous side to it. Poor Mr. Beale!"</p>

<p>"I deserve a little pity," he said ruefully.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked quickly. "Have you committed bigamy?"</p>

<p>"Not noticeably so," he answered, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do about it? It's rather serious
when one thinks of it&mdash;seriously. So I am Mrs. Stanford
Beale&mdash;poor Mr. Beale, and poor Mrs. Beale-to-be. I do
hope," she said, and this time her seriousness was genuine,
"that I have not upset any of your plans&mdash;too much. Oh,"
she sat down suddenly, staring at him, "it would be awful," she
said in a hushed voice, "and I would never forgive myself. Is
there&mdash;forgive my asking the question, but I suppose," with
a flashing smile, "as your wife I am entitled to your
confidence&mdash;is there somebody you are going to marry?"</p>

<p>"I have neither committed bigamy nor do I contemplate it,"
said Beale, who was gradually recovering his grip of the
situation, "if you mean am I engaged to somebody&mdash;in fact,
to a girl," he said recklessly, "the answer is in the negative.
There will be no broken hearts on my side of the family. I have
no desire to probe your wounded heart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be flippant," she stopped him sternly; "it is a very
terrible situation, Mr. Beale, and I hardly dare to think of
it."</p>

<p>"I realize how terrible it is," he said, suddenly bold, "and
as I tell you, I will do everything I can to correct my
blunder."</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Kitson know?" she asked. He nodded. "What did Mr.
Kitson say? Surely he gave you some advice."</p>

<p>"He said&mdash;" began Stanford, and went red.</p>

<p>The girl did not pursue the subject.</p>

<p>"Come, let us talk about the matter like rational beings,"
she said cheerfully. "I have got over my first inclination to
swoon. You must curb your very natural desire to be
haughty."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you what we can do yet. I don't want to
discuss the unpleasant details of a divorce," he said, "and
perhaps you will let me have a few days before we decide on any
line of action. Van Heerden is still at large, and until he is
under lock and key and this immense danger which threatens the
world is removed, I can hardly think straight."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kitson has told me about van Heerden," she said quietly.
"Isn't it rather a matter for the English police to deal with?
As I have reason to know," she shivered slightly, "Doctor van
Heerden is a man without any fear or scruple."</p>

<p>"My scruples hardly keep me awake at night," he said, "and I
guess I'm not going to let up on van Heerden. I look upon it as
my particular job."</p>

<p>"Isn't it"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"isn't it rather
dangerous?"</p>

<p>"For me?" he laughed, "no, I don't think so. And even if it
were in the most tragic sense of the word dangerous, why, that
would save you a great deal of unpleasantness."</p>

<p>"I think you are being horrid," she said.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he responded quickly, "I was fishing for a
little pity, and it was rather cheap and theatrical. No, I do
not think there is very much danger. Van Heerden is going to
keep under cover, and he is after something bigger than my young
life."</p>

<p>"Is Milsom with him?"</p>

<p>"He is the weak link in van Heerden's scheme," Beale said.
"Somehow van Heerden doesn't strike me as a good team leader,
and what little I have seen of Milsom leads me to the belief
that he is hardly the man to follow the doctor's lead blindly.
Besides, it is always easier to catch two men than one," he
laughed. "That is an old detective's axiom and it works
out."</p>

<p>She put out her hand.</p>

<p>"It's a tangled business, isn't it?" she said. "I mean us.
Don't let it add to your other worries. Forget our unfortunate
relationship until we can smooth things out."</p>

<p>He shook her hand in silence.</p>

<p>"And now I am coming out to hear all that you clever people
suggest," she said. "Please don't look alarmed. I have been
talking all the afternoon and have been narrating my sad
experience&mdash;such as I remember&mdash;to the most important
people. Cabinet Ministers and police commissioners and doctors
and things."</p>

<p>"One moment," he said.</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a stout book.</p>

<p>"I was wondering what that was," she laughed. "You haven't
been buying me reading-matter?"</p>

<p>He nodded, and held the volume so that she could read the
title.</p>

<p>"'A Friend in Need,' by S. Beale. I didn't know you wrote!"
she said in surprise.</p>

<p>"I am literary and even worse," he said flippantly. "I see
you have a shelf of books here. If you will allow me I will put
it with the others."</p>

<p>"But mayn't I see it?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I just want to tell you all you have said about van Heerden
is true. He is a most dangerous man. He may yet be dangerous to
you. I don't want you to touch that little book unless you are
in really serious trouble. Will you promise me?"</p>

<p>She opened her eyes wide.</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Beale&mdash;?</p>

<p>"Will you promise me?" he said again.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll promise you, but I don't quite
understand."</p>

<p>"You will understand," he said.</p>

<p>He opened the door for her and she passed out ahead of him.
Kitson came to meet them.</p>

<p>"I suppose there is no news?" asked Stanford.</p>

<p>"None," said the other, "except high political news. There
has been an exchange of notes between the Triple Alliance and
the German Government. All communication with the Ukraine is cut
off, and three ships have been sunk in the Bosphorus so cleverly
that our grain ships in the Black Sea are isolated."</p>

<p>"That's bad," said Beale.</p>

<p>He walked to the table. It was littered with maps and charts
and printed tabulations. McNorton got up and joined them.</p>

<p>"I have just had a 'phone message through from the Yard," he
said. "Carter, my assistant, says that he's certain van Heerden
has not left London."</p>

<p>"Has the girl spoken?"</p>

<p>"Glaum? No, she's as dumb as an oyster. I doubt if you would
get her to speak even if you put her through the third degree,
and we don't allow that."</p>

<p>"So I am told," said Beale dryly.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Unlock it somebody," said Kitson. "I turned the key."</p>

<p>The nearest person was the member of the Corn Exchange
Committee, and he clicked back the lock and the door opened to
admit a waiter.</p>

<p>"There's a man here&mdash;" he said; but before he could say
more he was pushed aside and a dusty, dishevelled figure stepped
into the room and glanced round.</p>

<p>"My name is Milsom," he said. "I have come to give King's
Evidence!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap29" id="chap29">XXIX. &mdash; THE LOST
CODE</a></h2>

<p class="first">"I'M Milsom," said the man in the doorway
again. His clothes were grimed and dusty, his collar limp and
soiled. There were two days' growth of red-grey stubble on his
big jaw, and he bore himself like a man who was faint from lack
of sleep.</p>

<p>He walked unsteadily to the table and fell into &amp;
chair.</p>

<p>"Where is van Heerden?" asked Beale, but Milsom shook his
head.</p>

<p>"I left him two hours ago, after a long and unprofitable talk
on patriotism," he said, and laughed shortly. "At that time he
was making his way back to his house in Southwark."</p>

<p>"Then he is in London&mdash;here in London!"</p>

<p>Milsom nodded.</p>

<p>"You won't find him," he said brusquely. "I tell you I've
left him after a talk about certain patriotic misgivings on my
part&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>He lifted his right hand, which hitherto he had kept
concealed by his side, and Oliva shut her eyes and felt deathly
sick.</p>

<p>"Right index digit and part of the phalanges shot away," said
Milsom philosophically. "That was my trigger-finger&mdash;but he
shot first. Give me a drink!"</p>

<p>They brought him a bottle of wine, and he drank it from a
long tumbler in two great breathless gulps.</p>

<p>"You've closed the coast to him," he said, "you shut down
your wires and cables, you're watching the roads, but he'll get
his message through, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then he hasn't cabled?" said Beale eagerly. "Milsom, this
means liberty for you&mdash;liberty and comfort. Tell us the
truth, man, help us hold off this horror that van Heerden is
loosing on the world and there's no reward too great for
you."</p>

<p>Milsom's eyes narrowed. "It wasn't the hope of reward or hope
of pardon that made me break with van Heerden," he said in his
slow way. "You'd laugh yourself sick if I told you. It
was&mdash;it was the knowledge that this country would be down
and out; that the people who spoke my tongue and thought more or
less as I thought should be under the foot of the
Beast&mdash;fevered sentimentality! You don't believe that?"</p>

<p>"I believe it."</p>

<p>It was Oliva who spoke, and it appeared that this was the
first time that Milsom had noticed her presence, for his eyes
opened wider.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;oh, you believe it, do you?" and he nodded.</p>

<p>"But why is van Heerden waiting?" asked McNorton. "What is he
waiting for?"</p>

<p>The big man rolled his head helplessly from side to side, and
the hard cackle of his laughter was very trying to men whose
nerves were raw and on edge.</p>

<p>"That's the fatal lunacy of it! I think it must be a national
characteristic. You saw it in the war again and again&mdash;a
wonderful plan brought to naught by some piece of over-cleverness
on the part of the super-man."</p>

<p>A wild, hope leapt to Beale's heart. "Then it has failed! The
rust has not answered&mdash;?"</p>

<p>But Milsom shook his head wearily.</p>

<p>"The rust is all that he thinks&mdash;and then some," he
said. "No, it isn't that. It is in the work of organization
where the hitch has occurred. You know something of the story.
Van Heerden has agents in every country in the world. He has
spent nearly a hundred thousand pounds in perfecting his working
plans, and I'm willing to admit that they are wellnigh perfect.
Such slight mistakes as sending men to South Africa and
Australia where the crops are six months later than the European
and American harvests may be forgiven, because the German thinks
longitudinally, and north and south are the two points of the
compass which he never bothers his head about. If the Germans
had been a seafaring people they'd have discovered America
before Columbus, but they would never have found the North Pole
or rounded the Cape in a million years." He paused, and they saw
the flicker of a smile in his weary eyes.</p>

<p>"The whole scheme is under van Heerden's hand. At the word
'Go' thousands of his agents begin their work of
destruction&mdash;but the word must come from him. He has so
centralized his scheme that if he died suddenly without that
word being uttered, the work of years would come to naught. I
guess he is suspicious of everybody, including his new
Government. For the best part of a year he has been arranging
and planning. With the assistance of a girl, a compatriot of
his, he has reduced all things to order. In every country is a
principal agent who possesses a copy of a simple code. At the
proper moment van Heerden would cable a word which meant 'Get
busy' or 'Hold off until you hear from me,' or 'Abandon scheme
for this year and collect cultures.' I happen to be word-perfect
in the meanings of the code words because van Heerden has so
often drummed them into me."</p>

<p>"What are the code words?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that," nodded Milsom. "Van Heerden is the type
of scientist that never trusts his memory. You find that kind in
all the school&mdash;they usually spend their time making the
most complete and detailed notes, and their studies are packed
with memoranda. Yet he had a wonderful memory for the
commonplace things&mdash;for example, in the plain English of
his three messages he was word perfect. He could tell you
off-hand the names and addresses of all his agents. But when it
came to scientific data his mind was a blank until he consulted his
authorities. It seemed that once he made a note his mind was
incapable of retaining the information he had committed to
paper. That, as I say, is a phenomenon which is not infrequently
met with amongst men of science."</p>

<p>"And he had committed the code to paper?" asked Kitson.</p>

<p>"I am coming to that. After the fire at the Paddington works,
van Heerden said the time had come to make a get away. He was
going to the Continent, I was to sail for Canada. 'Before you
go,' he said, 'I will give you the code&mdash;but I am afraid
that I cannot do that until after ten o'clock.'"</p>

<p>McNorton was scribbling notes in shorthand and carefully
circled the hour.</p>

<p>"We went back to his flat and had breakfast together&mdash;it
was then about five o'clock. He packed a few things and I
particularly noticed that he looked very carefully at the
interior of a little grip which he had brought the previous
night from Staines. He was so furtive, carrying the bag to the
light of the window, that I supposed he was consulting his code,
and I wondered why he should defer giving me the information
until ten o'clock. Anyway, I could swear he took something from
the bag and slipped it into his pocket. We left the flat soon
after and drove to a railway station where the baggage was left.
Van Heerden had given me bank-notes for a thousand pounds in
case we should be separated, and I went on to the house in South
London. You needn't ask me where it is because van Heerden is
not there."</p>

<p>He gulped again at the wine.</p>

<p>"At eleven o'clock van Heerden came back," resumed Milsom,
"and if ever a man was panic-stricken it was he&mdash;the long
and the short of it is that the code was mislaid."</p>

<p>"Mislaid!" Beale was staggered.</p>

<p>Here was farce interpolated into tragedy&mdash;the most
grotesque, the most unbelievable farce.</p>

<p>"Mislaid," said Milsom. "He did not say as much, but I
gathered from the few disjointed words he flung at me that the
code was not irredeemably lost; in fact, I have reason to
believe that he knows where it is. It was after that that van
Heerden started in to do some tall cursing of me, my country, my
decadent race and the like. Things have been strained all the
afternoon. To-night they reached a climax. He wanted me to help
him in a burglary&mdash;and burglary is not my forte."</p>

<p>"What did he want to burgle?" asked McNorton, with
professional interest.</p>

<p>"Ah! There you have me! It was the question I asked and he
refused to answer. I was to put myself in his hands and there
was to be some shooting if, as he thought likely, a caretaker
was left on the premises to be entered. I told him flat&mdash;we
were sitting on Wandsworth Common at the time&mdash;that he
could leave me out, and that is where we became mutually
offensive."</p>

<p>He looked at his maimed hand.</p>

<p>"I dressed it roughly at a chemist's. The iodine open
dressing isn't beautiful, but it is antiseptic. He shot to kill,
too, there's no doubt about that. A very perfect little
gentleman!"</p>

<p>"He's in London?" said McNorton. "That simplifies
matters."</p>

<p>"To my mind it complicates rather than simplifies," said
Beale. "London is a vast proposition. Can you give us any idea
as to the hour the burglary was planned for?"</p>

<p>"Eleven," said Milsom promptly, "that is to say, in a little
over an hour's time."</p>

<p>"And you have no idea of the locality?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere in the East of London. We were to have met at
Aldgate."</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," said McNorton. "Do you suggest that
the code is in the hands of somebody who is not willing to part
with it? And now that he no longer needs it for you, is there
any reason why he should wait?"</p>

<p>"Every reason," replied Milsom, and Stanford Beale nodded in
agreement. "It was not only for me he wanted it. He as good as
told me that unless he recovered it he would be unable to
communicate with his men."</p>

<p>"What do you think he'll do?"</p>

<p>"He'll get Bridgers to assist him. Bridgers is a pretty sore
man, and the doctor knows just where he can find him."</p>

<p>As Oliva listened an idea slowly dawned in her mind that she
might supply a solution to the mystery of the missing code. It
was a wildly improbable theory she held, but even so slender a
possibility was not to be discarded. She slipped from the group
and went back to her room. For the accommodation of his ward,
James Kitson had taken the adjoining suite to his own and had
secured a lady's maid from an agency for the girl's service. She
passed through the sitting-room to her own bedroom, And found
the maid putting the room ready for the night.</p>

<p>"Minnie," she said, throwing a quick glance about the
apartment, "where did you put the clothes I took off when I
came?"</p>

<p>"Here, miss."</p>

<p>The girl opened the wardrobe and Oliva made a hurried
search.</p>

<p>"Did you find&mdash;anything, a little ticket?"</p>

<p>The girl smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, miss. It was in your stocking."</p>

<p>Oliva laughed.</p>

<p>"I suppose you thought it was rather queer, finding that sort
of thing in a girl's stocking," she asked, but the maid was
busily opening the drawers of the dressing-table in search of
something.</p>

<p>"Here it is, miss."</p>

<p>She held a small square ticket in her hand and held it with
such disapproving primness that Oliva nearly laughed.</p>

<p>"I found it in your stocking, miss," she said again.</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Oliva coolly, "that's where I put it. I
always carry my pawn tickets in my stocking."</p>

<p>The admirable Minnie sniffed.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have never seen such a thing," smiled Oliva,
"and you hardly knew what it was."</p>

<p>The lady's maid turned very red. She had unfortunately seen
many such certificates of penury, but all that was part of her
private life, and she had been shocked beyond measure to be
confronted with this too-familiar evidence of impecuniosity in
the home of a lady who represented to her an assured income and
comfortable pickings.</p>

<p>Oliva went back to her sitting-room and debated the matter.
It was a sense of diffidence, the fear of making herself
ridiculous, which arrested her. Otherwise she might have flown
into the room, declaimed her preposterous theories and leave
these clever men to work out the details. She opened the door
and with the ticket clenched in her hand stepped into the
room.</p>

<p>If they had missed her after she had left nobody saw her
return. They were sitting in a group about the table, firing
questions at the big unshaven man who had made such a dramatic
entrance to the conference and who, with a long cigar in the
corner of his mouth, was answering readily and fluently.</p>

<p>But faced with the tangible workings of criminal
investigation her resolution and her theories shrank to
vanishing-point. She clasped the ticket in her hand and felt for
a pocket, but the dressmaker had not provided her with that
useful appendage.</p>

<p>So she turned and went softly back to her room, praying that
she would not be noticed. She closed the door gently behind her
and turned to meet a well-valeted man in evening-dress who was
standing in the middle of the room, a light overcoat thrown over
his arm, his silk hat tilted back from his forehead, a picture
of calm assurance.</p>

<p>"Don't move," said van Heerden, "and don't scream. And be
good enough to hand over the pawn ticket you are holding in your
hand."</p>

<p>Silently she obeyed, and as she handed the little pasteboard
across the table which separated them she looked past him to the
bookshelf behind his head, and particularly to a new volume
which bore the name of Stanford Beale.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap30" id="chap30">XXX. &mdash; THE WATCH</a></h2>

<p class="first">"THANKS," said van Heerden, pocketing the
ticket, "it is of no use to me now, for I cannot wait. I gather
that you have not disclosed the fact that this ticket is in your
possession."</p>

<p>"I don't know how you gather that," she said.</p>

<p>"Lower your voice!" he hissed menacingly. "I gather as much
because Beale knew the ticket would not be in my possession now.
If he only knew, if he only had a hint of its existence, I fear
my scheme would fail. As it is, it will succeed. And now," he
said with a smile, "time is short and your preparations must be
of the briefest. I will save you the trouble of asking questions
by telling you that I am going to take you along with me. I
certainly cannot afford to leave you. Get your coat."</p>

<p>With a shrug she walked past him to the bedroom and he
followed.</p>

<p>"Are we going far?" she asked.</p>

<p>There was no tremor in her voice and she felt remarkably
self-possessed.</p>

<p>"That you will discover." said he.</p>

<p>"I am not asking out of idle curiosity, but I want to know
whether I ought to take a bag."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be better," he said.</p>

<p>She carried the little attache case back to the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>"You have no objection to my taking a little light
reading-matter?" she asked contemptuously. "I am afraid you are
not a very entertaining companion. Dr. van Heerden."</p>

<p>"Excellent girl," said van Heerden cheerfully. "Take anything
you like."</p>

<p>She slipped a book from the shelf and nearly betrayed herself
by an involuntary exclamation as she felt its weight.</p>

<p>"You are not very original in your methods," she said, "this
is the second time you have spirited me off."</p>

<p>"The gaols of England, as your new-found friend Milsom will
tell you, are filled with criminals who departed from the beaten
tracks," said van Heerden. "Walk out into the corridor and turn
to the right. I will be close behind you. A little way along you
will discover a narrow passage which leads to the service
staircase. Go down that. I am sure you believe me when I say
that I will kill you if you attempt to make any signal or scream
or appeal for help."</p>

<p>She did not answer. It was because of this knowledge and this
fear, which was part of her youthful equipment&mdash;for violent
death is a very terrible prospect to the young and the
healthy&mdash;that she obeyed him at all.</p>

<p>They walked down the stone stairs, through an untidy,
low-roofed lobby, redolent of cooking food, into the street,
without challenge and without attracting undue notice.</p>

<p>Van Heerden's car was waiting at the end of the street, and
she thought she recognized the chauffeur as Bridgers.</p>

<p>"Once more we ride together," said van Heerden gaily, "and
what will be the end of this adventure for you depends entirely
upon your loyalty&mdash;what are you opening your bag for?" he
asked, peering in the dark.</p>

<p>"I am looking for a handkerchief," said Oliva. "I am afraid I
am going to cry!"</p>

<p>He settled himself back in the corner of the car with a sigh
of resignation, accepting her explanation&mdash;sarcasm was
wholly wasted on van Heerden.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said Milsom, "I don't think there's
anything more I can tell you. What are you going to do with
me?"</p>

<p>"I'll take the responsibility of not executing the warrant,"
said McNorton. "You will accompany one of my men to his home
to-night and you will be under police supervision."</p>

<p>"That's no new experience," said Milsom, "there's only one
piece of advice I want to give you."</p>

<p>"And that is?" asked Beale.</p>

<p>"Don't underrate van Heerden. You have no conception of his
nerve. There isn't a man of us here," he said, "whose insurance
rate wouldn't go up to ninety per cent if van Heerden decided
to get him. I don't profess that I can help you to explain his
strange conduct to-day. I can only outline the psychology of it,
but how and where he has hidden his code and what circumstances
prevent its recovery, is known only to van Heerden."</p>

<p>He nodded to the little group, and accompanied by McNorton
left the room.</p>

<p>"There goes a pretty bad man," said Kitson, "or I am no judge
of character. He's an old lag, isn't he?"</p>

<p>Beale nodded.</p>

<p>"Murder," he said laconically. "He lived after his time. He
should have been a contemporary of the Borgias."</p>

<p>"A poisoner!" shuddered one of the under-secretaries. "I
remember the case. He killed his nephew and defended himself on
the plea that the youth was a degenerate, as he undoubtedly
was."</p>

<p>"He might have got that defence past in America or France,"
said Beale, "but unfortunately there was a business end to the
matter. He was the sole heir of his nephew's considerable
fortune, and a jury from the Society of Eugenics would have
convicted him on that."</p>

<p>He looked at his watch and turned his eyes to Kitson. "I
presume Miss Cresswell is bored and has retired for the night,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I'll find out in a moment," said Kitson. "Did you speak to
her?"</p>

<p>Beale nodded, and his eyes twinkled. "Did you make any
progress?"</p>

<p>"I broke the sad news to her, if that's what you mean."</p>

<p>"You told her she was married to you? Good heavens! What did
she say?"</p>

<p>"Well, she didn't faint, I don't think she's the fainting
kind. She is cursed with a sense of humour, and refused even to
take a tragic view."</p>

<p>"That's bad," said Kitson, shaking his head. "A sense of
humour is out of place in a divorce court, and that is where
your little romance is going to end, my friend."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure," said Beale calmly, and the other stared
at him.</p>

<p>"You have promised me," he began, with a note of acerbity in
his voice.</p>

<p>"And you have advised me," said Beale. Kitson choked down
something which he was going to say, but which he evidently
thought was better left unsaid.</p>

<p>"Wait," he commanded, "I will find out whether Miss
Cresswell," he emphasized the words, "has gone to bed."</p>

<p>He passed through the door to Oliva's sitting-room and was
gone a few minutes. When he came back Beale saw his troubled
face, and ran forward to meet him. "She's not there," said
Kitson.</p>

<p>"Not in her room?"</p>

<p>"Neither in the sitting-room nor the bedroom. I have rung for
her maid. Oh, here you are."</p>

<p>Prim Minnie came through the bedroom door.</p>

<p>"Where is your mistress?"</p>

<p>"I thought she was with you, sir."</p>

<p>"What is this?" said Beale, stooped and picked up a white kid
glove. "She surely hasn't gone out," he said in
consternation.</p>

<p>"That's not a lady's glove, sir," said the girl, "that is a
gentleman's."</p>

<p>It was a new glove, and turning it over he saw stamped inside
the words: "Glebler, Rotterdam."</p>

<p>"Has anybody been here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not to my knowledge, sir. The young lady told me she did not
want me any more to-night." The girl hesitated. It seemed a
veritable betrayal of her mistress to disclose such a sordid
matter as the search for a pawn ticket.</p>

<p>Beale noticed the hesitation.</p>

<p>"You must tell me everything, and tell me quickly," he
said.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the maid, "the lady came in to look for
something she brought with her when she came here."</p>

<p>"I remember!" cried Kitson, "she told me she had brought away
something very curious from van Heerden's house and made me
guess what it was. Something interrupted our talk&mdash;what was
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the maid, resigned, "I won't tell you a
lie, sir. It was a pawn ticket."</p>

<p>"A pawn ticket!" cried Kitson and Beale in unison.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"Absolutely sure, sir."</p>

<p>"But she couldn't have brought a pawn ticket from van
Heerden's house. What was it for?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir."</p>

<p>"What was on the pawn ticket?" said Kitson impatiently. "What
article had been pledged?"</p>

<p>Again the girl hesitated. To betray her mistress was
unpleasant. To betray herself&mdash;as she would if she
confessed that she had most carefully and thoroughly read the
voucher&mdash;was unthinkable.</p>

<p>"You know what was on it," said Beale, in his best third
degree manner, "now don't keep us waiting. What was it?"</p>

<p>"A watch, sir."</p>

<p>"How much was it pledged for?"</p>

<p>"Ten shillings, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the name."</p>

<p>"In a foreign name, sir&mdash;van Horden."</p>

<p>"Van Heerden," said Beale quickly, "and at what
pawnbrokers?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the girl, making a fight for her
reputation, "I only glanced at the ticket and I only
noticed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did," interrupted Beale sharply, "you read every
line of it. Where was it?"</p>

<p>"Rosenblaum Bros., of Commercial Road," blurted the girl.</p>

<p>"Any number?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see the number."</p>

<p>"You will find them in the telephone book." said Kitson.
"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>But Beale was half-way to Kitson's sitting-room, arriving
there in time to meet McNorton who had handed over his charge to
his subordinate.</p>

<p>"I've found it!" cried Beale.</p>

<p>"Found what?" asked Kitson.</p>

<p>"The code!"</p>

<p>"Where? How?" asked McNorton.</p>

<p>"Unless I am altogether wrong the code is contained, either
engraved on the case or written on a slip of paper enclosed
within the case of a watch. Can't you see it all plainly now?
Van Heerden neither trusted his memory nor his subordinates. He
had his simple code written, as we shall find, upon thin paper
enclosed in the case of a hunter watch, and this he pledged. A
pawnbroker's is the safest of safe deposits. Searching for
clues, suppose the police had detected his preparations, the
pledged ticket might have been easily overlooked."</p>

<p>Kitson was looking at him with an expression of amazed
indignation. Here was a man who had lost his wife, and Kitson
believed that this young detective loved the girl as few women
are loved; but in the passion of the chase, in the production of
a new problem, he was absorbed to the exclusion of all other
considerations in the greater game.</p>

<p>Yet he did Beale an injustice if he only knew, for the
thought of Oliva's new peril ran through all his speculations,
his rapid deductions, his lightning plans.</p>

<p>"Miss Cresswell found the ticket and probably extracted it as
a curiosity. These things are kept in little envelopes, aren't
they, McNorton?"</p>

<p>The police chief nodded.</p>

<p>"That was it, then. She took it out and left the envelope
behind, and van Heerden did not discover his loss until he went
to find the voucher to give Milsom the code. Don't you remember?
In the first place he said he couldn't give him the code until
after ten o'clock, which is probably the hour the pawnbrokers
open for business."</p>

<p>McNorton nodded again.</p>

<p>"Then do you remember that Milsom said that the code was not
irredeemably lost and that van Heerden knew where it was. In
default of finding the ticket he decided to burgle the
pawnbroker's, and that burglary is going through to-night."</p>

<p>"But he could have obtained a duplicate of the ticket," said
McNorton.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Beale quickly.</p>

<p>"By going before a magistrate and swearing an affidavit."</p>

<p>"In his own name," said Beale, "you see, he couldn't do that.
It would mean walking into the lion's den. No, burglary was his
only chance."</p>

<p>"But what of Oliva?" said Kitson impatiently, "I tell you,
Beale, I am not big enough or stoical enough to think outside of
that girl's safety."</p>

<p>Beale swung round at him.</p>

<p>"You don't think I've forgotten that, do you?" he said in a
low voice. "You don't think that has been out of my mind?" His
face was tense and drawn. "I think, I believe that Oliva is
safe," he said quietly. "I believe that Oliva and not any of us
here will deliver van Heerden to justice."</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" asked Kitson in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I am very sane. Come here!"</p>

<p>He gripped the old lawyer by the arm and led him back to the
girl's room.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, and pointed.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, the bookshelf?"</p>

<p>Beale nodded.</p>

<p>"Half an hour ago I gave Oliva a book," he said, "that book
is no longer there."</p>

<p>"But in the name of Heaven how can a book save her?" demanded
the exasperated Kitson.</p>

<p>Stanford Beale did not answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, she's safe. I know she's safe," he said. "If Oliva
is the girl I think she is then I see van Heerden's
finish."'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap31" id="chap31">XXXI. &mdash; A CORN CHANDLER'S
BILL</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE church bells were chiming eleven o'clock
when a car drew up before a gloomy corner shop, bearing the
dingy sign of the pawnbroker's calling, and Beale and McNorton
alighted.</p>

<p>It was a main street and was almost deserted. Beale looked up
at the windows. They were dark. He knocked at the side-entrance
of the shop, and presently the two men were joined by a
policeman.</p>

<p>"Nobody lives here, sir," explained the officer, when
McNorton had made himself known. "Old Rosenblaum runs the
business, and lives at Highgate."</p>

<p>He flashed his lamp upon the door and tried it, but it did
not yield. A nightfarer who had been in the shade on the
opposite side of the street came across and volunteered
information.</p>

<p>He had seen another car drive up and a gentleman had
alighted. He had opened the door with a key and gone in. There
was nothing suspicious about him. He was "quite a gentleman, and
was in evening-dress." The constable thought it was one of the
partners of Rosenblaum in convivial and resplendent garb. He had
been in the house ten minutes then had come out again, locking
the door behind him, and had driven off just before Beale's car
had arrived.</p>

<p>It was not until half an hour later that an agitated little
man brought by the police from Highgate admitted the two
men.</p>

<p>There was no need to make a long search. The moment the light
was switched on in the shop Beale made his discovery. On the
broad counter lay a sheet of paper and a little heap of silver
coins. He swept the money aside and read:</p>

<p>"For the redemption of one silver hunter, 10s. 6d."</p>

<p>It was signed in the characteristic handwriting that Beale
knew so well "Van Heerden, M.D."</p>

<p>The two men looked at one another.</p>

<p>"What do you make of that?" asked McNorton.</p>

<p>Beale carried the paper to the light and examined it, and
McNorton went on:</p>

<p>"He's a pretty cool fellow. I suppose he had the money and
the message all ready for our benefit."</p>

<p>Beale shook his head.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," he said, "this was done on the spur of the
moment. A piece of bravado which occurred to him when he had the
watch. Look at this paper. You can imagine him searching his
pocket for a piece of waste paper and taking the first that came
to his hand. It is written in ink with the pawnbroker's own pen.
The inkwell is open," he lifted up the pen, "the nib is still
wet," he said.</p>

<p>McNorton took the paper from his hands.</p>

<p>It was a bill from a corn-chandler's at Horsham, the type of
bill that was sent in days of war economy which folded over and
constituted its own envelope. It was addressed to "J. B. Harden,
Esq." ("That was the alias he used when he took the wine vaults
at Paddington," explained McNorton) and had been posted about a
week before. Attached to the bottom of the account, which was
for &pound;3 10s., was a little slip calling attention to the
fact that "this account had probably been overlooked."</p>

<p>Beale's finger traced the item for which the bill was
rendered, and McNorton uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>"Curious, isn't it?" said Beale, as he folded the paper and
put it away in his pocket, "how these very clever men always
make some trifling error which brings them to justice. I don't
know how many great schemes I have seen brought to nothing
through some such act of folly as this, some piece of theatrical
bravado which benefited the criminal nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Good gracious," said McNorton wonderingly, "of course,
that's what he is going to do. I never thought of that. It is in
the neighbourhood of Horsham we must look for him, and I think
if we can get one of the Messrs. Billingham out of bed in a
couple of hours' time we shall do a good night's work."</p>

<p>They went outside and again questioned the policeman. He
remembered the car turning round and going back the way it had
come. It had probably taken one of the innumerable side-roads
which lead from the main thorough fare, and in this way they had
missed it.</p>

<p>"I want to go to the 'Megaphone' office first," said Beale.
"I have some good friends on that paper and I am curious to know
how bad the markets are. The night cables from New York should
be coming in by now."</p>

<p>In his heart was a sickening fear which he dared not express.
What would the morrow bring forth? If this one man's cupidity
and hate should succeed in releasing the terror upon the world,
what sort of a world would it leave? Through the windows of the
car he could see the placid policemen patrolling the streets,
caught a glimpse of other cars brilliantly illuminated bearing
their laughing men and women back to homes, who were ignorant of
the monstrous danger which threatened their security and life.
He passed the facades of great commercial mansions which in a
month's time might but serve to conceal the stark ruin within.
To him it was a night of tremendous tragedy, and for the second
time in his life in the numbness induced by the greater peril
and the greater anxiety he failed to wince at the thought of the
danger in which Oliva stood.</p>

<p>Indeed, analysing his sensations she seemed to him on this
occasion less a victim than a fellow-worker and he found a
strange comfort in that thought of partnership.</p>

<p>The Megaphone buildings blazed with light when the car drew
up to the door, messenger-boys were hurrying through the
swing-doors, the two great elevators were running up and down
without pause. The grey editor with a gruff voice threw over a
bundle of flimsies.</p>

<p>"Here are the market reports," he growled, "they are not very
encouraging."</p>

<p>Beale read them and whistled, and the editor eyed him
keenly.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of it?" he asked the detective.
"Wheat at a shilling a pound already. God knows what it's going
to be to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"Any other news?" asked Beale.</p>

<p>"We have asked Germany to explain why she has prohibited the
export of wheat and to give us a reason for the stocks she holds
and the steps she has taken during the past two months to
accumulate reserves."</p>

<p>"An ultimatum?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly an ultimatum. There's nothing to go to war
about. The Government has mobilized the fleet and the French
Government has partially mobilized her army. The question is,"
he said, "would war ease the situation?"</p>

<p>Beale shook his head.</p>

<p>"The battle will not be fought in the field," he said. "It
will be fought right here in London, in all your great towns, in
Manchester, Coventry, Birmingham, Cardiff. It will be fought in
New York and in a thousand townships between the Pacific and the
Atlantic, and if the German scheme comes off we shall be beaten
before a shot is fired."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" asked the editor, "why is everybody
buying wheat so frantically? There is no shortage. The harvests
in the United States and Canada are good."</p>

<p>"There will be no harvests," said Beale solemnly; and the
journalist gaped at him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap32" id="chap32">XXXII. THE END OF VAN
HEERDEN</a></h2>

<p class="first">DR. VAN HEERDEN expected many things and was
prepared for contingencies beyond the imagination of the
normally minded, but he was not prepared to find in Oliva
Cresswell a pleasant travelling-companion. When a man takes a
girl, against her will, from a pleasant suite at the best hotel
in London, compels her at the peril of death to accompany him on
a motor-car ride in the dead of the night, and when his offence
is a duplication of one which had been committed less than a
week before, he not unnaturally anticipates tears,
supplications, or in the alternative a frigid and unapproachable
silence.</p>

<p>To his amazement Oliva was extraordinarily cheerful and
talkative and even amusing. He had kept Bridgers at the door of
the car whilst he investigated the pawn-broking establishment of
Messrs. Rosenblaum Bros., and had returned in triumph to
discover that the girl who up to then had been taciturn and
uncommunicative was in quite an amiable mood.</p>

<p>"I used to think," she said, "that motor-car abductions were
the invention of sensational writers, but you seem to make a
practice of it. You are not very original. Dr. van Heerden. I
think I've told you that before."</p>

<p>He smiled in the darkness as the car sped smoothly through
the deserted streets.</p>

<p>"I must plead guilty to being rather unoriginal," he said,
"but I promise you that this little adventure shall not end as
did the last."</p>

<p>"It can hardly do that," she laughed, "I can only be married
once whilst Mr. Beale is alive."</p>

<p>"I forgot you were married," he said suddenly, then after a
pause, "I suppose you will divorce him?"</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked innocently.</p>

<p>"But you're not fond of that fellow, are you?"</p>

<p>"Passionately," she said calmly, "he is my ideal."</p>

<p>The reply took away his breath and certainly silenced
him.</p>

<p>"How is this adventure to end?" she demanded. "Are you going
to maroon me on a desert island, or are you taking me to
Germany?"</p>

<p>"How did you know I am trying to get to Germany?" he asked
sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Beale thought so," she replied, in a tone of
indifference, "he reckoned that he would catch you somewhere
near the coast."</p>

<p>"He did, did he?" said the other calmly. "I shall deny him
that pleasure. I don't intend taking you to Germany. Indeed, it
is not my intention to detain you any longer than is
necessary."</p>

<p>"For which I am truly grateful," she smiled, "but why detain
me at all?"</p>

<p>"That is a stupid question to ask when I am sure you have no
doubt in your mind as to why it is necessary to keep you close
to me until I have finished my work. I think I told you some
time ago," he went on, "that I had a great scheme. The other day
you called me a Hun, by which I suppose you meant that I was a
German. It is perfectly true that I am a German and I am a
patriotic German. To me even in these days of his degradation
the Kaiser is still little less than a god."</p>

<p>His voice quivered a little, and the girl was struck dumb
with wonder that a man of such intelligence, of such a wide
outlook, of such modernity, should hold to views so archaic.</p>

<p>"Your country ruined Germany. You have sucked us dry. To say
that I hate England and hate America&mdash;for you Anglo-Saxons
are one in your soulless covetousness&mdash;is to express my
feelings mildly."</p>

<p>"But what is your scheme?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Briefly I will tell you, Miss Cresswell, that you may
understand that to-night you accompany history and are a
participant in world politics. America and England are going to
pay. They are going to buy corn from my country at the price
that Germany can fix. It will be a price," he cried, and did not
attempt to conceal his joy, "which will ruin the Anglo-Saxon
people more effectively than they ruined Germany."</p>

<p>"But how?" she asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>"They are going to buy corn," he repeated, "at our price,
corn which is stored in Germany."</p>

<p>"But what nonsense!" she said scornfully, "I don't know very
much about harvests and things of that kind, but I know that
most of the world's wheat comes from America and from
Russia."</p>

<p>"The Russian wheat will be in German granaries," he said
softly, "the American wheat&mdash;there will be no American
wheat."</p>

<p>And then his calmness deserted him. The story of the Green
Rust burst out in a wild flood of language which was half-German
and half-English. The man was beside himself, almost mad, and
before his gesticulating hands she shrank back into the corner
of the car. She saw his silhouette against the window, heard the
roar and scream of his voice as he babbled incoherently of his
wonderful scheme and had to piece together as best she could his
disconnected narrative. And then she remembered her work in
Beale's office, the careful tabulation of American farms, the
names of the sheriffs, the hotels where conveyances might be
secured.</p>

<p>So that was it! Beale had discovered the plot, and had
already moved to counter this devilish plan. And she remembered
the man who had come to her room in mistake for van Heerden's
and the phial of green sawdust he carried and Beale's look of
horror when he examined it. And suddenly she cried with such
vehemence that his flood of talk was stopped:-"Thank God! Oh,
thank God!"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what do you mean?" he demanded suspiciously.
"What are you thanking God about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, nothing." She was her eager, animated self.
"Tell me some more. It is a wonderful story. It is true, is it
not?"</p>

<p>"True?" he laughed harshly, "you shall see how true it is.
You shall see the world lie at the feet of German science.
To-morrow the word will go forth. Look!" He clicked on a little
electric light and held out his hand. In his palm lay a silver
watch.</p>

<p>"I told you there was a code." (she was dimly conscious that
he had spoken of a code but she had been so occupied by her own
thoughts that she had not caught all that he had said). "That
code was in this watch. Look!"</p>

<p>He pressed a knob and the case flew open. Pasted to the
inside of the case was a circular piece of paper covered with
fine writing.</p>

<p>"When you found that ticket you had the code in your hands,"
he chuckled; "if you or your friends had the sense to redeem
that watch I could not have sent to-morrow the message of German
liberation! See, it is very simple!" He pointed with his finger
and held the watch half-way to the roof that the light might
better reveal the wording. "This word means 'Proceed.' It will
go to all my chief agents. They will transmit it by telegram to
hundreds of centres. By Thursday morning great stretches of
territory where the golden corn was waving so proudly to-day
will be blackened wastes. By Saturday the world will confront
its sublime catastrophe."</p>

<p>"But why have you three words?" she asked huskily.</p>

<p>"We Germans provide against all contingencies," he said, "we
leave nothing to chance. We are not gamblers. We work on lines
of scientific accuracy. The second word is to tell my agents to
suspend operations until they hear from me. The third word means
'Abandon the scheme for this year'! We must work with the
markets. A more favourable opportunity might occur&mdash;with so
grand a conception it is necessary that we should obtain the
maximum results for our labours."</p>

<p>He snapped the case of the watch and put it back in his
pocket, turned out the light and settled himself bade with a
sigh of content. "You see you are unimportant," he said, "you
are a beautiful woman and to many men you would be most
desirable. To me, you are just a woman, an ordinary
fellow-creature, amusing, beautiful, possessed of an agile mind,
though somewhat frivolous by our standards. Many of my
fellow-countrymen who do not think like I do would take you.
It is my intention to leave you just as soon as it is safe to do
so unless&mdash;" A thought struck him, and he frowned.</p>

<p>"Unless&mdash;? she repeated with a sinking heart in spite of
her assurance.</p>

<p>"Bridgers was speaking to me of you. He who is driving." He
nodded to the dimly outlined shoulders of the chauffeur. "He has
been a faithful fellow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he said coolly. "I don't want you. Bridgers thinks
that you are beautiful."</p>

<p>"Is he a Hun, too?" she asked, and he jerked round toward
her.</p>

<p>"If Bridgers wants you he shall have you," he said
harshly.</p>

<p>She knew she had made a mistake. There was no sense in
antagonizing him, the more especially so since she had not yet
learnt all that she wanted to know.</p>

<p>"I think your scheme is horrible," she said after awhile,
"the wheat destruction scheme, I mean, not Bridgers. But it is a
very great one."</p>

<p>The man was susceptible to flattery, for he became genial
again.</p>

<p>"It is the greatest scheme that has ever been known to
science. It is the most colossal crime&mdash;I suppose they will
call it a crime&mdash;that has ever been committed."</p>

<p>"But how are you going to get your code word away? The
telegraphs are in the hands of the Government and I think you
will find it difficult even if you have a secret wireless."</p>

<p>"Wireless, bah!" he said scornfully. "I never expected to
send it by telegraph with or without wires. I have a much surer
way, fraulein, as you will see."</p>

<p>"But how will you escape?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I shall leave England to-morrow, soon after daybreak," he
replied, with assurance, "by aeroplane, a long-distance
flying-machine will land on my Sussex farm which will have British
markings-indeed, it is already in England, and I and my good
Bridgers will pass your coast without trouble."</p>

<p>He peered out of the window.</p>

<p>"This is Horsham, I think," he said, as they swept through
what appeared to the girl to be a square. "That little building
on the left is the railway station. You will see the signal lamp
in a moment. My farm is about five miles down the Shoreham
Road."</p>

<p>He was in an excellent temper as they passed through the old
town and mounted the hill which leads to Shoreham, was
politeness itself when the car had turned off the main road and
had bumped over cart tracks to the door of a large building.</p>

<p>"This is your last escapade, Miss Cresswell, or Mrs. Beale I
suppose I should call you," he said jovially, as he pushed her
before him into a room where supper had been laid for two. "You
see, you were not expected, but you shall have Bridgers'. It
will be daylight in two hours," he said inconsequently, "you
must have some wine."</p>

<p>She shook her head with a smile, and he laughed as if the
implied suspicion of her refusal was the best joke in the
world.</p>

<p>"Nein, nein, little friend," he said, "I shall not doctor you
again. My days of doctoring have passed."</p>

<p>She had expected to find the farm in occupation, but
apparently they were the only people there. The doctor had
opened the door himself with a key, and no servant had appeared,
nor apparently did he expect them to appear. She learnt
afterwards that there were two farm servants, an old man and his
wife, who lived in a cottage on the estate and came in the
daytime to do the housework and prepare a cold supper against
their master's coming.</p>

<p>Bridgers did not make his appearance. Apparently he was
staying with his car. About three o'clock in the morning, when
the first streaks of grey were showing in the sky, van Heerden
rose to go in search of his assistant. Until then he had not
ceased to talk of himself, of his scheme, of his great plan, of
his early struggles, of his difficulties in persuading members
of his Government to afford him the assistance he required. As
he turned to the door she checked him with a word:</p>

<p>"I am immensely interested," she said, "but still, you nave
not told me how you intend to send your message."</p>

<p>"It is simple," he said, and beckoned to her.</p>

<p>They passed out of the house into the chill sweet dawn, made
a half-circuit of the farm and came to a courtyard surrounded on
three sides by low buildings. He opened a door to reveal another
door covered with wire netting.</p>

<p>"Behold!" he laughed.</p>

<p>"Pigeons!" said the girl.</p>

<p>The dark interior of the shed was aflicker with white
wings.</p>

<p>"Pigeons!" repeated van Heerden, closing the door, "and every
one knows his way back to Germany. It has been a labour of love
collecting them. And they are all British," he said with a
laugh. "There I will give the British credit, they know more
about pigeons than we Germans and have used them more in the
war."</p>

<p>"But suppose your pigeon is shot down or falls by the way?"
she asked, as they walked slowly back to the house.</p>

<p>"I shall send fifty," replied van Heerden calmly; "each will
carry the same message and some at least will get home."</p>

<p>Back in the dining-room he cleared the remains of the supper
from the table and went out of the room for a few minutes,
returning with a small pad of paper, and she saw from the
delicacy with which he handed each sheet that it was of the
thinnest texture. Between each page he placed a carbon and began
to write, printing the characters. There was only one word on
each tiny sheet. When this was written he detached the leaves,
putting them aside and using his watch as a paper-weight, and
wrote another batch.</p>

<p>She watched him, fascinated, until he showed signs that he
had completed his task. Then she lifted the little valise which
she had at her side, put it on her knees, opened it and took out
a book. It must have been instinct which made him raise his eyes
to her.</p>

<p>"What have you got there?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, a book," she said, with an attempt at carelessness.</p>

<p>"But why have you got it out? You are not reading." He leant
over and snatched it from her and looked at the title.</p>

<p>"'A Friend in Need,'" he read. "By Stanford Beale&mdash;by
Stanford Beale," he repeated, frowning. "I didn't know your
husband wrote books?"</p>

<p>She made no reply. He turned back the cover and read the
title page.</p>

<p>"But this is 'Smiles's Self Help,'" he said.</p>

<p>"It's the same thing," she replied.</p>

<p>He turned another page or two, then stopped, for he had come
to a place where the centre of the book had been cut right out.
The leaves had been glued together to disguise this fact, and
what was apparently a book was in reality a small box.</p>

<p>"What was in there?" he asked, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>"This," she said, "don't move, Dr. van Heerden!" The little
hand which held the Browning was firm and did not quiver.</p>

<p>"I don't think you are going to send your pigeons off this
morning, doctor," she said. "Stand back from the table." She
leant over and seized the little heap of papers and the watch.
"I am going to shoot you," she said steadily, "if you refuse to
do as I tell you; because if I don't shoot you, you will kill
me."</p>

<p>His face had grown old and grey in the space of a few
seconds. The white hands he raised were shaking. He tried to
speak but only a hoarse murmur came. Then his face went blank.
He stared at the pistol, then stretched out his hands slowly
toward it. "Stand back!" she cried.</p>

<p>He jumped at her, and she pulled the trigger, but nothing
happened, and the next minute she was struggling in his arms.
The man was hysterical with fear and relief and was giggling and
cursing in the same breath. He wrenched the pistol from her hand
and threw it on the table.</p>

<p>"You fool! You fool!" he shouted, "the safety-catch! You
didn't put it down!"</p>

<p>She could have wept with anger and mortification. Beale had
put the catch of the weapon at safety, not realizing that she
did not understand the mechanism of it, and van Heerden in one
lightning glance had seen his advantage.</p>

<p>"Now you suffer!" he said, as he flung her in a chair. "You
shall suffer, I tell you! I will make an example of you. I will
leave your husband something which he will not touch!"</p>

<p>He was shaking in every limb. He dashed to the door and
bellowed "Bridgers!"</p>

<p>Presently she heard a footstep in the hall.</p>

<p>"Come, my friend," van Heerden shouted, "you shall have your
wish. It is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How are you going, van Heerden? Quietly or rough?"</p>

<p>He spun round. There were two men in the doorway, and the
first of these was Beale.</p>

<p>"It's no use your shouting for Bridgers because Bridgers is
on the way to the jug," said McNorton. "I have a warrant for
you, van Heerden."</p>

<p>The doctor turned with a howl of rage, snatched up the pistol
which lay on the table, and thumbed down the safety-catch.</p>

<p>Beale and McNorton fired together, so that it seemed like a
single shot that thundered through the room. Van Heerden slid
forward, and fell sprawling across the table.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>It was the Friday morning, and Beale stepped briskly through
the vestibule of the Ritz-Carlton, and declining the elevator
went up the stairs two at a time. He burst into the room where
Kitson and the girl were standing by the window.</p>

<p>"Wheat prices are tumbling down," he said, "the message
worked."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven for that!" said Kitson. "Then van Heerden's
code message telling his gang to stop operations reached its
destination!"</p>

<p>"Its destinations," corrected Beale cheerfully. "I released
thirty pigeons with the magic word. The agents have been
arrested," he said; "we notified the Government authorities, and
there was a sheriff or a policeman in every post office when the
code word came through&mdash;van Heerden's agents saw some
curious telegraph messengers yesterday."</p>

<p>Kitson nodded and turned away.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?" asked the girl, with a light
in her eyes. "You must feel quite lost without this great quest
of yours."</p>

<p>"There are others," said Stanford Beale.</p>

<p>"When do you return to America?" she asked.</p>

<p>He fenced the question, but she brought him back to it.</p>

<p>"I have a great deal of business to do in London before I
go," he said.</p>

<p>"Like what?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well," he hesitated, "I have some legal business."</p>

<p>"Are you suing somebody?" she asked, wilfully dense.</p>

<p>He rubbed his head in perplexity.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," he said, "I don't exactly know what
I've got to do or what sort of figure I shall cut. I have never
been in the Divorce Court before."</p>

<p>"Divorce Court?" she said, puzzled, "are you giving evidence?
Of course I know detectives do that sort of thing. I have read
about it in the newspapers. It must be rather horrid, but you
are such a clever detective&mdash;oh, by the way you never told
me how you found me."</p>

<p>"It was a very simple matter," he said, relieved to change
the subject, "van Heerden, by one of those curious lapses which
the best of criminals make, left a message at the pawnbroker's
which was written on the back of an account for pigeon food,
sent to him from a Horsham tradesman. I knew he would not try to
dispatch his message by the ordinary courses and I suspected all
along that he had established a pigeon-post. The bill gave me
all the information I wanted. It took us a long time to find the
tradesman, but once we had discovered him he directed us to the
farm. We took along a couple of local policemen and arrested
Bridgers in the garage."</p>

<p>She shivered. "It was horrible, wasn't it?" she said.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"It was rather dreadful, but it might have been very much
worse," he added philosophically.</p>

<p>"But how wonderful of you to switch yourself from the crime
of that enthralling character to a commonplace divorce
suit."</p>

<p>"This isn't commonplace," he said, "it is rather a curious
story."</p>

<p>"Do tell me." She made a place for him on the window-ledge
and he sat down beside her.</p>

<p>"It is a story of a mistake and a blunder," he said. "The
plaintiff, a very worthy young man, passably good looking, was a
man of my profession, a detective engaged in protecting the
interests of a young and beautiful girl."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have to say she's young and beautiful or the
story wouldn't be interesting," she said.</p>

<p>"It is not necessary to lie in this case," he said, "she is
certainly young and undoubtedly beautiful. She has the loveliest
eyes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," she said hastily.</p>

<p>"The detective," he resumed, "hereinafter called the
petitioner, desiring to protect the innocent maiden from the
machinations of a fortune-hunting gentleman no longer with us,
contracted as he thought a fraudulent marriage with this
unfortunate girl, believing thereby he could choke off the
villain who was pursuing her."</p>

<p>"But why did the unfortunate girl marry him, even
fraudulently?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Beale, "the villain of the piece had drugged
her and she didn't know what she was doing. After the marriage,"
he went on, "he discovered that so far from being illegal it was
good in law and he had bound this wretched female."</p>

<p>"Please don't be rude," she said.</p>

<p>"He had bound this wretched female to him for life. Being a
perfect gentleman, born of poor but American parents, he takes
the first opportunity of freeing her."</p>

<p>"And himself," she murmured.</p>

<p>"As to the poor misguided lad," he said firmly, "you need
feel no sympathy. He had behaved disgracefully."</p>

<p>"How?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, he had already fallen in love with her and
that made his offence all the greater. If you go red I cannot
tell you this story, because it embarrasses me."</p>

<p>"I haven't gone red," she denied indignantly. "So what are
you&mdash;what is he going to do?"</p>

<p>Beale shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"He is going to work for a divorce."</p>

<p>"But why?" she demanded. "What has she done?"</p>

<p>He looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Well,"&mdash;she shrugged her shoulders slightly and smiled
in his face&mdash;"it seems to me that it is nothing to do with
him. It is the wretched female who should sue for a divorce, not
the handsome detective&mdash;do you feel faint?"</p>

<p>"No," he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Don't you agree with me?"</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said the incoherent Beale. "But suppose
her guardian takes the necessary steps?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"The guardian can do nothing unless the wretched female
instructs him," she said. "Does it occur to you that even the
best of drugs wear off in time and that there is a possibility
that the lady was not as unconscious of the ceremony as she
pretends? Of course," she said hurriedly, "she did not realize
that it had actually happened, and until she was told by Apollo
from the Central Office&mdash;that's what you call Scotland Yard
in New York, isn't it?&mdash;that the ceremony had actually
occurred she was under the impression that it was a beautiful
dream&mdash;when I say beautiful," she amended, in some hurry,
"I mean not unpleasant."</p>

<p>"Then what am I to do?" said the helpless Beale.</p>

<p>"Wait till I divorce you," said Oliva, and turned her head
hurriedly, so that Beale only kissed the tip of her ear.</p>
