<h3>Published in <i>Woman's Home Companion</i>, February 1925</h3>

<hr>

<p>The last prisoner was a man&mdash;his masculinity was not much in
evidence, it is true; he would perhaps better be described as a
"person," but he undoubtedly came under that general heading and
was so classified in the court record. He was a small, somewhat
shriveled, somewhat wrinkled American who had been living along for
probably thirty-five years.</p>

<p>His body looked as if it had been left by accident in his suit
the last time it went to the tailor's and pressed out with hot,
heavy irons to its present sharpness. His face was merely a face.
It was the kind of face that makes up crowds, gray in color with
ears that shrank back against the head as if fearing the clamor of
the city, and with the tired, tired eyes of one whose forebears
have been underdogs for five thousand years.</p>

<p>Brought into the dock between two towering Celts in executive
blue he seemed like the representative of a long extinct race, a
very fagged out and shriveled elf who had been caught poaching on a
buttercup in Central Park.</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Stuart."</p>

<p>"Stuart what?"</p>

<p>"Charles David Stuart."</p>

<p>The clerk recorded it without comment in the book of little
crimes and great mistakes.</p>

<p>"Age?"</p>

<p>"Thirty."</p>

<p>"Occupation?"</p>

<p>"Night cashier."</p>

<p>The clerk paused and looked at the judge. The judge yawned.</p>

<p>"Wha's charge?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The charge is"&mdash;the clerk looked down at the notation in his
hand&mdash;"the charge is that he pushed a lady in the face."</p>

<p>"Pleads guilty?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The preliminaries were now disposed of. Charles David Stuart,
looking very harmless and uneasy, was on trial for assault and
battery.</p>

<p>The evidence disclosed, rather to the judge's surprise, that the
lady whose face had been pushed was not the defendant's wife.</p>

<p>On the contrary the victim was an absolute stranger&mdash;the
prisoner had never seen her before in his life. His reasons for the
assault had been two: first, that she talked during a theatrical
performance; and, second, that she kept joggling the back of his
chair with her knees. When this had gone on for some time he had
turned around and without any warning pushed her severely in the
face.</p>

<p>"Call the plaintiff," said the judge, sitting up a little in his
chair. "Let's hear what she has to say."</p>

<p>The courtroom, sparsely crowded and unusually languid in the hot
afternoon, had become suddenly alert. Several men in the back of
the room moved into benches near the desk and a young reporter
leaned over the clerk's shoulder and copied the defendant's name on
the back of an envelope.</p>

<p>The plaintiff arose. She was a woman just this side of fifty
with a determined, rather overbearing face under yellowish white
hair. Her dress was a dignified black and she gave the impression
of wearing glasses; indeed the young reporter, who believed in
observation, had so described her in his mind before he realized
that no such adornment sat upon her thin, beaked nose.</p>

<p>It developed that she was Mrs. George D. Robinson of 1219
Riverside Drive. She had always been fond of the theater and
sometimes she went to the matinee. There had been two ladies with
her yesterday, her cousin, who lived with her, and a Miss
Ingles&mdash;both ladies were in court.</p>

<p>This is what had occurred:</p>

<p>As the curtain went up for the first act a woman sitting behind
had asked her to remove her hat. Mrs. Robinson had been about to do
so anyhow, and so she was a little annoyed at the request and had
remarked as much to Miss Ingles and her cousin. At this point she
had first noticed the defendant who was sitting directly in front,
for he had turned around and looked at her quickly in a most
insolent way. Then she had forgotten his existence until just
before the end of the act when she made some remark to Miss
Ingles&mdash;when suddenly he had stood up, turned around and pushed her
in the face.</p>

<p>"Was it a hard blow?" asked the judge at this point.</p>

<p>"A hard blow!" said Mrs. Robinson indignantly, "I should say it
was. I had hot and cold applications on my nose all night."</p>

<p>"&mdash;on her nose all night."</p>

<p>This echo came from the witness bench where two faded ladies
were leaning forward eagerly and nodding their heads in
corroboration.</p>

<p>"Were the lights on?" asked the judge.</p>

<p>No, but everyone around had seen the incident and some people
had taken hold of the man right then and there.</p>

<p>This concluded the case for the plaintiff. Her two companions
gave similar evidence and in the minds of everyone in the courtroom
the incident defined itself as one of unprovoked and inexcusable
brutality.</p>

<p>The one element which did not fit in with this interpretation
was the physiognomy of the prisoner himself. Of any one of a number
of minor offenses he might have appeared guilty&mdash;pickpockets were
notoriously mild-mannered, for example&mdash;but of this particular
assault in a crowded theater he seemed physically incapable. He did
not have the kind of voice or the kind of clothes or the kind of
mustache that went with such an attack.</p>

<p>"Charles David Stuart," said the judge, "you've heard the
evidence against you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you plead guilty?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say before I sentence you?"</p>

<p>"No." The prisoner shook his head hopelessly. His small hands
were trembling.</p>

<p>"Not one word in extenuation of this unwarranted assault?"</p>

<p>The prisoner appeared to hesitate.</p>

<p>"Go on," said the judge. "Speak up&mdash;it's your last chance."</p>

<p>"Well," said Stuart with an effort, "she began talking about the
plumber's stomach."</p>

<p>There was a stir in the courtroom. The judge leaned forward.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, at first she was only talking about her own stomach to&mdash;to
those two ladies there"&mdash;he indicated the cousin and Miss
Ingles&mdash;"and that wasn't so bad. But when she began talking about
the plumber's stomach it got different."</p>

<p>"How do you mean&mdash;different?"</p>

<p>Charles Stuart looked around helplessly.</p>

<p>"I can't explain," he said, his mustache wavering a little, "but
when she began talking about the plumber's stomach you&mdash;you had to
listen."</p>

<p>A snicker ran about the courtroom. Mrs. Robinson and her
attendant ladies on the bench were visibly horrified. The guard
took a step nearer as if at a nod from the judge he would whisk off
this criminal to the dingiest dungeon in Manhattan.</p>

<p>But much to his surprise the judge settled himself comfortably
in his chair.</p>

<p>"Tell us about it, Stuart," he said not unkindly. "Tell us the
whole story from the beginning."</p>

<p>This request was a shock to the prisoner and for a moment he
looked as though he would have preferred the order of condemnation.
Then after one nervous look around the room he put his hands on the
edge of the desk, like the paws of a fox-terrier just being trained
to sit up, and began to speak in a quivering voice.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm a night cashier, your honor, in T. Cushmael's
restaurant on Third Avenue. I'm not married"&mdash;he smiled a little,
as if he knew they had all guessed <i>that</i>&mdash;"and so on
Wednesday and Saturday afternoons I usually go to the matinee. It
helps to pass the time till dinner. There's a drug store, maybe you
know, where you can get tickets for a dollar sixty-five to some of
the shows and I usually go there and pick out something. They got
awful prices at the box office now." He gave out a long silent
whistle and looked feelingly at the judge. "Four or five dollars
for one seat&mdash;"</p>

<p>The judge nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Charles Stuart, "when I pay even a dollar
sixty-five I expect to see my money's worth. About two weeks ago I
went to one of these here mystery plays where they have one fella
that did the crime and nobody knows who it was. Well, the fun at a
thing like that is to guess who did it. And there was a lady behind
me that'd been there before and she gave it all away to the fella
with her. Gee"&mdash;his face fell and he shook his head from side to
side&mdash;"I like to died right there. When I got home to my room I was
so mad that they had to come and ask me to stop walking up and
down. Dollar sixty-five of my money gone for nothing.</p>

<p>"Well, Wednesday came around again, and this show was one show I
wanted to see. I'd been wanting to see it for months, and every
time I went into the drug store I asked them if they had any
tickets. But they never did." He hesitated. "So Tuesday I took a
chance and went over to the box office and got a seat. Two
seventy-five it cost me." He nodded impressively. "Two
seventy-five. Like throwing money away. But I wanted to see that
show."</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinson in the front row rose suddenly to her feet.</p>

<p>"I don't see what all this story has to do with it," she broke
out a little shrilly. "I'm sure I don't care&mdash;"</p>

<p>The judge brought his gavel sharply down on the desk.</p>

<p>"Sit down, please," he said.</p>

<p>"This is a court of law, not a matinee."</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinson sat down, drawing herself up into a thin line and
sniffing a little as if to say she'd see about this after a while.
The judge pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said to Stuart. "Take all the time you want."</p>

<p>"I got there first," continued Stuart in a flustered voice.
"There wasn't anybody in there but me and the fella that was
cleaning up. After awhile the audience came in, and it got dark and
the play started, but just as I was all settled in my seat and
ready to have a good time I heard an awful row directly behind me.
Somebody had asked this lady"&mdash;he pointed directly to Mrs.
Robinson&mdash;"to remove her hat like she should of done anyhow and she
was sore about it. She kept telling the two ladies that was with
her how she'd been at the theater before and knew enough to take
off her hat. She kept that up for a long time, five minutes maybe,
and then every once in a while she'd think of something new and say
it in a loud voice. So finally I turned around and looked at her
because I wanted to see what a lady looked like that could be so
inconsiderate as that. Soon as I turned back she began on me. She
said I was insolent and then she said 'Tchk! Tchk! Tchk!' a lot
with her tongue and the two ladies that was with her said 'Tchk!
Tchk! Tchk!' until you could hardly hear yourself think, much less
listen to the play. You'd have thought I'd done something
terrible.</p>

<p>"By and by, after they calmed down and I began to catch up with
what was doing on the stage, I felt my seat sort of creak forward
and then creak back again and I knew the lady had her feet on it
and I was in for a good rock. Gosh!" he wiped his pale, narrow brow
on which the sweat had gathered thinly, "it was awful. I hope to
tell you I wished I'd never come at all. Once I got excited at a
show and rocked a man's chair without knowing it and I was glad
when he asked me to stop. But I knew this lady wouldn't be glad if
I asked her. She'd of just rocked harder than ever."</p>

<p>Some time before, the population of the courtroom had begun
stealing glances at the middle-aged lady with yellowish-white hair.
She was of a deep, life-like lobster color with rage.</p>

<p>"It got to be near the end of the act," went on the little pale
man, "and I was enjoying it as well as I could, seeing that
sometimes she'd push me toward the stage and sometimes she'd let
go, and the seat and me would fall back into place. Then all of a
sudden she began to talk. She said she had an operation or
something&mdash;I remember she said she told the doctor that she guessed
she knew more about her own stomach than he did. The play was
getting good just then&mdash;the people next to me had their
handkerchiefs out and was weeping&mdash;and I was feeling sort of that
way myself. And all of a sudden this lady began to tell her friends
what she told the plumber about his indigestion. Gosh!" Again he
shook his head from side to side; his pale eyes fell involuntarily
on Mrs. Robinson&mdash;then looked quickly away. "You couldn't help but
hear some and I began missing things and then missing more things
and then everybody began laughing and I didn't know what they were
laughing at and, as soon as they'd leave off, her voice would begin
again. Then there was a great big laugh that lasted for a long time
and everybody bent over double and kept laughing and laughing, and
I hadn't heard a word. First thing I knew the curtain came down and
then I don't know what happened. I must of been a little crazy or
something because I got up and closed my seat, and reached back and
pushed the lady in the face."</p>

<p>As he concluded there was a long sigh in the courtroom as though
everyone had been holding in his breath waiting for the climax.
Even the judge gasped a little and the three ladies on the witness
bench burst into a shrill chatter and grew louder and louder and
shriller and shriller until the judge's gavel rang out again upon
his desk.</p>

<p>"Charles Stuart," said the judge in a slightly raised voice, "is
this the only extenuation you can make for raising your hand
against a woman of the plaintiff's age?"</p>

<p>Charles Stuart's head sank a little between his shoulders,
seeming to withdraw as far as it was able into the poor shelter of
his body.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said faintly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinson sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"Yes, judge," she cried shrilly, "and there's more than that.
He's a liar too, a dirty little liar. He's just proclaimed himself
a dirty little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" cried the judge in a terrible voice. "I'm running
this court, and I'm capable of making my own decisions!" He paused.
"I will now pronounce sentence upon Charles Stuart," he referred to
the register, "upon Charles David Stuart of 212½ West 22nd St."</p>

<p>The courtroom was silent. The reporter drew nearer&mdash;he hoped the
sentence would be light&mdash;just a few days on the Island in lieu of a
fine.</p>

<p>The judge leaned back in his chair and hid his thumbs somewhere
under his black robe.</p>

<p>"Assault justified," he said. "Case dismissed."</p>

<p>The little man Charles Stuart came blinking out into the
sunshine, pausing for a moment at the door of the court and looking
furtively behind him as if he half expected that it was a judicial
error. Then, sniffling once or twice, not because he had a cold but
for those dim psychological reasons that make people sniff, he
moved slowly south with an eye out for a subway station.</p>

<p>He stopped at a news-stand to buy a morning paper; then entering
the subway was borne south to Eighteenth Street where he
disembarked and walked east to Third Avenue. Here he was employed
in an all-night restaurant built of glass and plaster white tile.
Here he sat at a desk from curfew until dawn, taking in money and
balancing the books of T. Cushmael, the proprietor. And here,
through the interminable nights, his eyes, by turning a little to
right or left, could rest upon the starched linen uniform of Miss
Edna Schaeffer.</p>

<p>Miss Edna Schaeffer was twenty-three, with a sweet mild face and
hair that was a living example of how henna should not be applied.
She was unaware of this latter fact, because all the girls she knew
used henna just this way, so perhaps the odd vermilion tint of her
coiffure did not matter.</p>

<p>Charles Stuart had forgotten about the color of her hair long
ago&mdash;if he had ever noticed its strangeness at all. He was much
more interested in her eyes, and in her white hands which, as they
moved deftly among piles of plates and cups, always looked as if
they should be playing the piano. He had almost asked her to go to
a matinee with him once, but when she had faced him her lips
half-parted in a weary, cheerful smile, she had seemed so beautiful
that he had lost courage and mumbled something else instead.</p>

<p>It was not to see Edna Schaeffer, however, that he had come to
the restaurant so early in the afternoon. It was to consult with T.
Cushmael, his employer, and discover if he had lost his job during
his night in jail. T. Cushmael was standing in the front of the
restaurant looking gloomily out the plate-glass window, and Charles
Stuart approached him with ominous forebodings.</p>

<p>"Where've you been?" demanded T. Cushmael.</p>

<p>"Nowhere," answered Charles Stuart discreetly.</p>

<p>"Well, you're fired."</p>

<p>Stuart winced.</p>

<p>"Right now?"</p>

<p>Cushmael waved his hands apathetically.</p>

<p>"Stay two or three days if you want to, till I find somebody.
Then"&mdash;he made a gesture of expulsion&mdash;"outside for you."</p>

<p>Charles Stuart assented with a weary little nod. He assented to
everything. At nine o'clock, after a depressed interval during
which he brooded upon the penalty of spending a night among the
police, he reported for work.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Stuart," said Edna Schaeffer, sauntering curiously
toward him as he took his place behind the desk. "What became of
you last night? Get pinched?"</p>

<p>She laughed, cheerfully, huskily, charmingly he thought, at her
joke.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered on a sudden impulse, "I was in the
Thirty-fifth Street jail."</p>

<p>"Yes, you were," she scoffed.</p>

<p>"That's the truth," he insisted, "I was arrested."</p>

<p>Her face grew serious at once.</p>

<p>"Go <i>on</i>. What did you do?"</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>"I pushed somebody in the face."</p>

<p>Suddenly she began to laugh, at first with amusement and then
immoderately.</p>

<p>"It's a fact," mumbled Stuart, "I almost got sent to prison
account of it."</p>

<p>Setting her hand firmly over her mouth Edna turned away from him
and retired to the refuge of the kitchen. A little later, when he
was pretending to be busy at the accounts, he saw her retailing the
story to the two other girls.</p>

<p>The night wore on. The little man in the grayish suit with the
grayish face attracted no more attention from the customers than
the whirring electric fan over his head. They gave him their money
and his hand slid their change into a little hollow in the marble
counter. But to Charles Stuart the hours of this night, this last
night, began to assume a quality of romance. The slow routine of a
hundred other nights unrolled with a new enchantment before his
eyes. Midnight was always a sort of a dividing point&mdash;after that
the intimate part of the evening began. Fewer people came in, and
the ones that did seemed depressed and tired: a casual ragged man
for coffee, the beggar from the street corner who ate a heavy meal
of cakes and a beefsteak, a few nightbound street-women and a
watchman with a red face who exchanged warning phrases with him
about his health.</p>

<p>Midnight seemed to come early tonight and business was brisk
until after one. When Edna began to fold napkins at a nearby table
he was tempted to ask her if she too had not found the night
unusually short. Vainly he wished that he might impress himself on
her in some way, make some remark to her, some sign of his devotion
that she would remember forever.</p>

<p>She finished folding the vast pile of napkins, loaded it onto
the stand and bore it away, humming to herself. A few minutes later
the door opened and two customers came in. He recognized them
immediately, and as he did so a flush of jealousy went over him.
One of them, a young man in a handsome brown suit, cut away
rakishly from his abdomen, had been a frequent visitor for the last
ten days. He came in always at about this hour, sat down at one of
Edna's tables, and drank two cups of coffee with lingering ease. On
his last two visits he had been accompanied by his present
companion, a swarthy Greek with sour eyes who ordered in a loud
voice and gave vent to noisy sarcasm when anything was not to his
taste.</p>

<p>It was chiefly the young man, though, who annoyed Charles
Stuart. The young man's eyes followed Edna wherever she went, and
on his last two visits he had made unnecessary requests in order to
bring her more often to his table.</p>

<p>"Good evening, girlie," Stuart heard him say to-night. "How's
tricks?"</p>

<p>"O.K.," answered Edna formally. "What'll it be?"</p>

<p>"What have you?" smiled the young man. "Everything, eh? Well,
what'd you recommend?"</p>

<p>Edna did not answer. Her eyes were staring straight over his
head into some invisible distance.</p>

<p>He ordered finally at the urging of his companion. Edna withdrew
and Stuart saw the young man turn and whisper to his friend,
indicating Edna with his head.</p>

<p>Stuart shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He hated that young
man and wished passionately that he would go away. It seemed as if
his last night here, his last chance to watch Edna, and perhaps
even in some blessed moment to talk to her a little, was marred by
every moment this man stayed.</p>

<p>Half a dozen more people had drifted into the restaurant&mdash;two or
three workmen, the newsdealer from over the way&mdash;and Edna was too
busy for a few minutes to be bothered with attentions. Suddenly
Charles Stuart became aware that the sour-eyed Greek had raised his
hand and was beckoning him. Somewhat puzzled he left his desk and
approached the table.</p>

<p>"Say, fella," said the Greek, "what time does the boss come
in?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;two o'clock. Just a few minutes now."</p>

<p>"All right. That's all. I just wanted to speak to him about
something."</p>

<p>Stuart realized that Edna was standing beside the table; both
men turned toward her.</p>

<p>"Say, girlie," said the young man, "I want to talk to you. Sit
down."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"Sure you can. The boss don't mind." He turned menacingly to
Stuart.</p>

<p>"She can sit down, can't she?"</p>

<p>Stuart did not answer.</p>

<p>"I say she can sit down, can't she?" said the young man more
intently, and added, "Speak up, you little dummy."</p>

<p>Still Stuart did not answer. Strange blood currents were flowing
all over his body. He was frightened; anything said determinedly
had a way of frightening him. But he could not move.</p>

<p>"Sh!" said the Greek to his companion.</p>

<p>But the younger man was angered.</p>

<p>"Say," he broke out, "some time somebody's going to take a paste
at you when you don't answer what they say. Go on back to your
desk!"</p>

<p>Still Stuart did not move.</p>

<p>"Go on away!" repeated the young man in a dangerous voice.
"Hurry up! <i>Run!</i>"</p>

<p>Then Stuart ran. He ran as hard as he was able. But instead of
running away from the young man he ran <i>toward</i> him,
stretching out his hands as he came near in a sort of straight arm
that brought his two palms, with all the force of his hundred and
thirty pounds, against his victim's face. With a crash of china the
young man went over backward in his chair and, his head striking
the edge of the next table, lay motionless on the floor.</p>

<p>The restaurant was in a small uproar. There was a terrified
scream from Edna, an indignant protest from the Greek, and the
customers arose with exclamations from their tables. Just at this
moment the door opened and Mr. Cushmael came in.</p>

<p>"Why you little fool!" cried Edna wrathfully. "What are you
trying to do? Lose me my job?"</p>

<p>"What's this?" demanded Mr. Cushmael, hurrying over. "What's the
idea?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Stuart pushed a customer in the face!" cried a waitress,
taking Edna's cue. "For no reason at all!"</p>

<p>The population of the restaurant had now gathered around the
prostrate victim. He was doused thoroughly with water and a folded
tablecloth was placed under his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, he did, did he?" shouted Mr. Cushmael in a terrible voice,
seizing Stuart by the lapels of his coat.</p>

<p>"He's raving crazy!" sobbed Edna. "He was in jail last night for
pushing a lady in the face. He told me so himself!"</p>

<p>A large laborer reached over and grasped Stuart's small
trembling arm. Stuart gazed around dumbly. His mouth was
quivering.</p>

<p>"Look what you done!" shouted Mr. Cushmael. "You like to kill a
man."</p>

<p>Stuart shivered violently. His mouth opened and he fought the
air for a moment. Then he uttered a half-articulate sentence:</p>

<p>"Only meant to push him in the face."</p>

<p>"Push him in the face?" ejaculated Cushmael in a frenzy. "So you
got to be a pusher-in-the-face, eh? Well, we'll push your face
right into jail!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I couldn't help it," gasped Stuart. "Sometimes I can't help
it." His voice rose unevenly. "I guess I'm a dangerous man and you
better take me and lock me up!" He turned wildly to Cushmael, "I'd
push you in the face if he'd let go my arm. Yes, I would! I'd push
you&mdash;right-in-the-<i>face!</i>"</p>

<p>For a moment an astonished silence fell, broken by the voice of
one of the waitresses who had been groping under the table.</p>

<p>"Some stuff dropped out of this fella's back pocket when he
tipped over," she explained, getting to her feet. "It's&mdash;why, it's
a revolver and&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had been about to say handkerchief, but as she looked at
what she was holding her mouth fell open and she dropped the thing
quickly on the table. It was a small black mask about the size of
her hand.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the Greek, who had been shifting uneasily upon
his feet ever since the accident, seemed to remember an important
engagement that had slipped his mind. He dashed suddenly around the
table and made for the front door, but it opened just at that
moment to admit several customers who, at the cry of "Stop him!"
obligingly spread out their arms. Barred in that direction, he
jumped an overturned chair, vaulted over the delicatessen counter,
and set out for the kitchen, collapsing precipitately in the firm
grasp of the chef in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Hold him! Hold him!" screamed Mr. Cushmael, realizing the turn
of the situation. "They're after my cash drawer!"</p>

<p>Willing hands assisted the Greek over the counter, where he
stood panting and gasping under two dozen excited eyes.</p>

<p>"After my money, hey?" shouted the proprietor, shaking his fist
under the captive's nose.</p>

<p>The stout man nodded, panting.</p>

<p>"We'd of got it too!" he gasped, "if it hadn't been for that
little pusher-in-the-face."</p>

<p>Two dozen eyes looked around eagerly. The little
pusher-in-the-face had disappeared.</p>

<p>The beggar on the corner had just decided to tip the policeman
and shut up shop for the night when he suddenly felt a small,
somewhat excited hand fall on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Help a poor man get a place to sleep&mdash;" he was beginning
automatically when he recognized the little cashier from the
restaurant. "Hello, brother," he added, leering up at him and
changing his tone.</p>

<p>"You know what?" cried the little cashier in a strangely ominous
tone. "I'm going to push you in the face!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" snarled the beggar. "Why, you Ga&mdash;"</p>

<p>He got no farther. The little man seemed to run at him suddenly,
holding out his hands, and there was a sharp, smacking sound as the
beggar came in contact with the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"You're a fakir!" shouted Charles Stuart wildly. "I gave you a
dollar when I first came here, before I found out you had ten times
as much as I had. And you never gave it back!"</p>

<p>A stout, faintly intoxicated gentleman who was strutting
expansively along the other sidewalk had seen the incident and came
running benevolently across the street.</p>

<p>"What does this mean!" he exclaimed in a hearty, shocked voice.
"Why, poor fellow&mdash;" He turned indignant eyes on Charles Stuart and
knelt unsteadily to raise the beggar.</p>

<p>The beggar stopped cursing and assumed a piteous whine.</p>

<p>"I'm a poor man, Cap'n&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is&mdash;this is <i>horrible!</i>" cried the Samaritan, with
tears in his eyes. "It's a disgrace! Police! <i>Pol&mdash;</i>!"</p>

<p>He got no farther. His hands, which he was raising for a
megaphone, never reached his face&mdash;other hands reached his face,
however, hands held stiffly out from a one-hundred-and-thirty-pound
body! He sank down suddenly upon the beggar's abdomen, forcing out
a sharp curse which faded into a groan.</p>

<p>"This beggar'll take you home in his car!" shouted the little
man who stood over him. "He's got it parked around the corner."</p>

<p>Turning his face toward the hot strip of sky which lowered over
the city the little man began to laugh, with amusement at first,
then loudly and triumphantly until his high laughter ran out in the
quiet street with a weird, elfish sound, echoing up the sides of
the tall buildings, growing shriller and shriller until people
blocks away heard its eerie cadence on the air and stopped to
listen.</p>

<p>Still laughing the little man divested himself of his coat and
then of his vest and hurriedly freed his neck of tie and collar.
Then he spat upon his hands and with a wild, shrill, exultant cry
began to run down the dark street.</p>

<p>He was going to clean up New York, and his first objective was
the disagreeable policeman on the corner!</p>

<p>They caught him at two o'clock, and the crowd which had joined
in the chase were flabbergasted when they found that the ruffian
was only a weeping little man in his shirt sleeves. Someone at the
station house was wise enough to give him an opiate instead of a
padded cell, and in the morning he felt much better.</p>

<p>Mr. Cushmael, accompanied by an anxious young lady with crimson
hair, called at the jail before noon.</p>

<p>"I'll get you out," cried Mr. Cushmael, shaking hands excitedly
through the bars. "One policeman, he'll explain it all to the
other."</p>

<p>"And there's a surprise for you too," added Edna softly, taking
his other hand. "Mr. Cushmael's got a big heart and he's going to
make you his day man now."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Charles Stuart calmly. "But I can't start
till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because this afternoon I got to go to a matinee&mdash;with a
friend."</p>

<p>He relinquished his employer's hand but kept Edna's white
fingers twined firmly in his.</p>

<p>"One more thing," he went on in a strong, confident voice that
was new to him, "if you want to get me off don't have the case come
up in the Thirty-fifth Street court."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because," he answered with a touch of swagger in his voice,
"that's the judge I had when I was arrested last time."</p>

<p>"Charles," whispered Edna suddenly, "what would you do if I
refused to go with you this afternoon?"</p>

<p>He bristled. Color came into his cheeks and he rose defiantly
from his bench.</p>

<p>"Why, I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said, flushing slightly. "You'd do nothing of
the kind."</p>
