  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">MAKARA, Chief of Kobala'ba, was paddled down the river to
  within ten miles of the residency, and here he hired new paddlers from a
  lower-river village, leaving the ten girls who had paddled him so far in
  charge of the village headman.</p>

  <p>He was young and skinny and beautiful to see, for not only did he wear the
  robe of monkey skins which is the robe of his rank, but his forearms were
  invisible under brass bangles; his hair was dyed red with ingola, his legs
  shone with oil, and he wore anklets of copper that clinked as he walked to
  the residency, where Mr. Sanders awaited him.</p>

  <p>"I see you, lord Sandi," he greeted the Commissioner, and his voice had
  the quality of boredom and weariness.</p>

  <p>"I see you, little chief," said Sanders, and there was acid in his tone.
  "And yet as I sat here before my fine house watching you come from the river,
  I had a strange thought. For it seemed to me that you were not Makara, son of
  Lebulana, son of Elibi that warrior, but a dancing woman of Kobala'ba, such
  as a man can buy for a thousand matakos."</p>

  <p>If Makara felt shame he showed none.</p>

  <p>"In my land all men are pretty," he said complacently. "Even in Kobala'ba
  I wear a feather in my hair and sometimes about my waist."</p>

  <p>Sanders showed his teeth in a smile that was entirely mirthless.</p>

  <p>"Rather would I see you with a spear in your hand and a shield on your
  arm, Makara," he said. "It seems that there are too many women in
  Kobala'ba&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Makara eagerly, "that is why I came; for soon your lordship
  will send to us for the rubber and fish which you steal from us every year
  for your government, and because we are few men we have nothing to give."</p>

  <p>Sanders took a cheroot from his pocket and lit it before he replied, his
  audience watching him anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Was there tribute when I sent before?" asked Sanders. "And when I sent
  before then, did I find skins and rubber, and before then, even? Makara, your
  people of all the people on the river pay no tax to my king. And because you
  are far away and I cannot come in my little ship along the shallow river, I
  think you laugh at me. Strange stories come along the river to me&mdash;of
  women who hunt and women who fish, and women who build houses. It seems that
  there is a new race of slaves growing under my eyes; slaves who are penned
  like dogs and beaten like dogs. Which is against all the laws of all the
  tribes, but terribly against my law. Some day I will come and see."</p>

  <p>"Lord, all that you hear is lies," said Makara, "for my young men are very
  strong and brave, and women have their proper place, which is in the fields
  and at the fires&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And at the paddles?" asked Sanders significantly. "My spies tell me that
  women brought you down the river, and that you left them at the village of
  Chubiri, so that I should not be offended. The palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>Makara went back to his village a little uneasy.</p>

  <p>For all that Sanders had heard was true: Makara had brought about a
  revolution in the custom of the country. In this black hinterland, men have a
  defined place and the sphere of their activities is rigidly confined by
  immemorial custom. For example, no woman is allowed to build a hut. The most
  lordly of the tribes reserve that work to men, partly, it is believed,
  because house-building has been the work of man since the beginning of time,
  and partly because, as is well known, a terrible curse lies on any roof that
  is thatched by a woman. No matter how indolent men may be, the erection of a
  house is their sole prerogative. On the other hand, no man with any spirit
  will till a field or grow corn or soak manioc or cook a meal. There once was
  a tribe so degraded that the men cooked their own dinners, and the name of
  that tribe was a reproach from the Lado to Eschowe. No woman may hunt or
  fish: that also is man's job, and the folk of Kobala'ba had terribly offended
  in this respect.</p>

  <p>"They come by night from the little river between the grass," reported an
  indignant petty chief of the Isisi; "ten women in each canoe, and they spear
  fish under the eyes of my young men, and when my fisher men speak to them
  they answer them shamefully. Now, lord, because these are Akasava folk we can
  do nothing. A moon and a rime of a moon ago, I sent word to the great chief
  of the Akasava and told him of this terrible thing. He said that Kobala'ba
  was a country by itself, and that though the people were of his tribe they
  mocked him. Also, lord, they say that in Kobala'ba the women take their
  spears and hunt in the forest, and that the men sit at home in their huts,
  which is strange to me."</p>

  <p>It is true that the village of Kobala'ba was sometimes called a country by
  itself, and with good reason. At the end of a shallow and narrow little creek
  which runs into the great river, and separated from all the world by a
  crescent of swamp, is a little lake on the northern shore of which rises a
  hog's back of good solid land. Here are long, sunny slopes where corn may be
  grown, and groves of Isisi palms affording pleasant shade, and behind the
  knoll a ten-mile depth of forest, where men can hunt profitably, and women,
  too, as it seemed.</p>

  <p>North of the creek is a girdle of swamp that separates the hunting ground
  from the forest of the Ochori; eastward is swamp again; to the west a
  desolation that is sometimes river and sometimes marsh. The isolation of
  KQbala'ba is complete. It is a dry oasis in a desert of water and near water,
  where crocodiles breed, and tiny mosquitoes rise in dense white clouds at
  every sunset.</p>

  <p>In the days of the bad King Elibi, when his spears were triumphant from
  the Ghost Mountains to the Little River, Kobala' ba was uninhabited. Its
  inaccessibility, its isolation, the age-old legend of ghosts and devils, as
  many as the grasses that grew on its slope, made this place an undesirable
  residence. When Sanders broke Elibi in the early days of his mission, the
  remnants of an Akasava fighting regiment made its way to the little lake,
  taking the goats and wives it had acquired by violence. Here they established
  themselves in the huts they built, and raised a new generation, which was
  mainly feminine&mdash;a phenomenon peculiar to the union of warriors and
  slaves. And that was the peculiarity of Kobala'ba, which persisted through
  the years, that three girls were born for every boy: so that in the course of
  time Kobala'ba was a village of straight-backed young women and puny youths
  who sat at the doors of their huts and were waited upon by sisters and
  cousins, mothers and aunts innumerable.</p>

  <p>With the death of the old chief and the coming of Makara, a considerable
  change came over the economic life of Kobala'ba, and he discovered an easy
  way to wealth. Slavery became systematized; he sent out bands of women
  hunters, at first under the guidance of a man, eventually by themselves, and
  there accumulated in the village great stores of skins and rubber. His canoes
  brought him fish to be dried in the sun, and, with the skins and rubber,
  exported secretly across the frontier into the French territory.</p>

  <p>Makara in another land might have become a captain of industry, for he was
  blessed with the gift of organization. Slavery is forbidden, but women have a
  price on the Great River, and it is lawful to buy wives. Makara and his
  enthusiastic men recruited a new kind of labour; his canoes went up and down
  the river seeking "wives." On the day he came to Sanders there were half a
  thousand women in his compounds and as many roving the forest in search of
  pelts.</p>

  <p>At the end of three weeks' hard paddling, Makara's weary paddlers brought
  him to his village and to a domestic problem; for one of his wives, the tall
  T'lini, had led a band of huntresses into the forest and had returned almost
  empty-handed. Makara held a conference, which was attended by the forty-seven
  grown males of the village.</p>

  <p>"We must not beat her or lay her in the sun," he said, "for presently
  Sandi will come, and she will tell evil stories about us. Let us be kind to
  her, and after Sandi is gone I will do certain things that will make her
  sorry."</p>

  <p>T'lini, who had lain for twenty-four hours, her hands and feet tied
  together, in the big pen where the surplus women were kept, was released and
  well fed, and for seven days the male heads of families assembled their
  quotas and rehearsed them in the story they must tell. And it might well have
  been that the slave community would have grown undetected, and with it the
  wealth of Makara, had not science in two stout volumes come to Lieutenant
  Tibbetts of the King's Houssas.</p>

  <p>Bones spent a fortnight of intensive reading and study before he started
  in to impart his newly acquired knowledge to the indigenous natives.</p>

  <p>"What is it Bones is swotting so hard?" asked Sanders one night after
  Bones had made an unceremonious and hasty departure from the dinner
  table.</p>

  <p>Hamilton knocked off the ash of his cheroot in his coffee cup, and his
  nose wrinkled disparagement.</p>

  <p>"Science," he said laconically.</p>

  <p>"Very admirable," murmured Sanders, and waited for the explosion, for
  Hamilton was on the touchy side, having just recovered from an attack of
  malaria.</p>

  <p>"Science!" sneered Hamilton. "Astronomy, natural history, botany,
  biology... My God, if he'd only keep it to himself!"</p>

  <p>The two handsomely illustrated books which had come to Bones by the last
  mail dealt with science in a popular way, in all its aspects. The volumes had
  been edited by a great savant, the articles written, by men with the gift of
  informing in the most simple language. Bones read and was fascinated. The two
  volumes exceeded in interest the modest expectations which were aroused by
  the sample page so cunningly dispatched to him.</p>

  <p>"Science will have no mysteries for Bones," said Hamilton bitterly,
  "except perhaps the science of keeping the company accounts, and the science
  of doing a simple job without making a hash of it."</p>

  <p>Sanders chuckled quietly.</p>

  <p>"Bones must have spent a fortune on his correspondence lessons&mdash;but
  there's nothing selfish about him: he passes on all he learns."</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm afraid of," said Hamilton darkly.</p>

  <p>A fortnight after Bones had received these volumes of instruction, he
  gathered together the Houssas on the square, and with them their wives and
  families, and pointed to the star-encrusted sky, for it was a glorious night
  in early December&mdash;such a night as English astronomers dream about but
  never see.</p>

  <p>"All people listen," said Bones in the Arabic of the Coast. "What are
  these little stars you see? Some are suns and some are worlds, greater than
  all this world&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lord," interrupted a sergeant of Houssas respectfully, "if they be suns,
  why is it night, for all men know that when the sun shines it is daytime? Yet
  these little things shine only at night."</p>

  <p>Bones explained laboriously, more or less inaccurately, and at the end
  violently.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Abiboo reported the lecture to Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt, Militini," he said, "that the lord Tibbetti is sick
  with the fever. For, as your lordship knows, when men are ill they imagine
  strange things, such as people walking about with heads like crocodiles."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say this, Abiboo?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Because, lord," said the sergeant decisively, "Tibbetti told us that
  these stars are suns, when all men know they are stars, being the spirits of
  the dead, according to the Kaffirs, but, as we true believers know, the
  bright eyes of the blessed houris that look down from Paradise."</p>

  <p>Bones, in disgust, turned from astronomy to biology. In consequence there
  was a marked coldness in the demeanour of the Houssas, and women scowled at
  him from their huts when he walked through the lines.</p>

  <p>One Kano lady laid a complaint before Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Tibbetti has shamed us all, for he told us that we were monkeys cala
  cala, and lived in trees and had tails; also that all men were once fishes,
  which is a terrible thing to say."</p>

  <p>"The lord Tibbetti has made you a great riddle," said Sanders tactfully,
  "but because you are a stupid woman you cannot understand its mystery."</p>

  <p>He passed a hint to Hamilton, and Hamilton, who never hinted, brought
  Bones to the carpet.</p>

  <p>"You're demoralizing the detachment, Bones, with this pseudo-science of
  yours. Keep off biology and astronomy, and confine your lectures to
  metaphysics."</p>

  <p>Bones brightened.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Hamilton, dear old officer. I don't know much about physics,
  but what about the odd spot of chemistry, dear old sir? Why does a seidlitz
  powder fizzle? You don't know, old boy! Don't pretend you do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Metaphysics has nothing whatever to do with chemistry," said Hamilton
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"Then," demanded the scornful Bones, "why call it physics&mdash;I ask you,
  dear old thing? Don't answer if you feel you're incriminating your jolly old
  self."</p>

  <p>Bones was due for a trip to the Akasava. There were palavers to be held, a
  certain amount of taxation to be collected. More especially, Sanders wanted
  exact information as to what was happening at Kobala'ba.</p>

  <p>The night before Mr. Tibbetts left on his journey, Hamilton uttered a word
  of warning.</p>

  <p>"When you get to Makara's village don't be scientific&mdash;if you are,
  confine yourself to insects. You can't do any harm there. If you start
  working off little pieces about the universe to the bloodthirsty Akasava,
  you'll probably start a couple of wars. And I absolutely forbid you to talk
  about evolution. The Darwinian theory is distinctly unpopular amongst the
  Houssas. It may bring you into some disrepute with people who hunt monkeys
  and eat fish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell them about Bones," put in Sanders. "An object lesson in industry
  will do the Akasava no harm."</p>

  <p>"A little astronomy, dear old Commissioner!" pleaded Bones. "What about
  the jolly old constellation of O'Brien? What about Beetlegrease, the
  notorious and ever-famous star that's a hundred and fifty million times
  bigger than the sun?"</p>

  <p>"Orion and Betelgeuse are the two words you're groping for," said Hamilton
  sternly, "and you'll not say a word about them. You remember the trouble we
  had with the Northern Ochori people over the moon, sir?"</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded.</p>

  <p>Long before Bones had taken science seriously, he had explained to the
  wild and terrified people of the Ochori the substance, character and origin
  of the lunar orb, with disastrous consequences; for the Northern Ochori, who
  blamed Bosambo for everything that had happened to the world since its
  beginning, gathered their spears and went up against their paramount chief.
  You cannot overturn settled convictions without producing unexpected
  reactions, and it took Sanders the greater part of a year to convince these
  misguided people that their first information about the moon was correct,
  namely, that it was the bright hole in the sky through which
  M'shimba-M'shamba made his entrances and exits from a disturbed and
  storm-swept earth.</p>

  <p>Kobala'ba is not easily reached. The motor launch dropped Bones at the
  scarcely visible mouth of the shallow river, and for four days he was paddled
  through bush and grass and virgin mosquito hordes&mdash;a painful
  experience.</p>

  <p>He came to Kobala'ba in the dark of an evening; and, knowing him to be at
  hand, the villagers burnt a big bonfire on the beach, which served the double
  purpose of beacon and illumination.</p>

  <p>It was not the chief Makara who met him, but T'lini, his wife, a very tall
  and supple girl of seventeen.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I see you! I am T'lini, wife of Makara."</p>

  <p>"I see you, T'lini," said Bones, peering at her. "Yet I think I would
  rather see the chief, your husband, for I do not make palaver with
  women."</p>

  <p>He looked left and right along the crowded beach. Not a warrior was to be
  seen; only these straight, ebony figures regarding him gravely. She read his
  thoughts and said: "There are few men in this village, lord Tibbetti, and
  these put themselves to bed early, because of the cold air of night which
  gives them pain in their throats."</p>

  <p>Bones gaped at her. "Good lord!" he said, in English.</p>

  <p>"Also, lord," she went on quickly, "these women you see are the wives of
  our warriors, and they are so happy that they dance with joy because their
  men are kind. And every day we work in the fields whilst our husbands go
  hunting in the forest."</p>

  <p>Bones screwed his monocle into his eye, and T'lini shrank back in
  terror.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, T'lini, are you of this village?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, which meant "No."</p>

  <p>"I come from B'lini on the river. Makara bought me for a bag of salt, also
  my own sister and the daughter of my father."</p>

  <p>Bones scratched his nose but said nothing. He walked to the hut that had
  been made for him. Here was a fine skin bed to spread his valise upon, and,
  rejecting the inevitable offer of service with the invariable excuse, he lay
  down and slept, for he was a very tired man.</p>

  <p>It was dark when he woke: the phosphorescent dial of his watch told him it
  was within a quarter of an hour of dawn, and he rose and dressed. The place
  was already alive; fires were burning before each hut; shadowy figures
  flitted up and down the broad street; and with the first violent light of the
  sun he saw a small body of men coming down from the far end of the village,
  where Makara's hut was. Makara himself led the party, and very formidable it
  was, for each man carried a bunch of hunting spears, though the fineries
  which decked their persons seemed a little inappropriate.</p>

  <p>"O Tibbetti, I see you!" boomed Makara. "Give me salt* if I did not come
  to you last night, but I and my young men, who have been hunting for many
  days in the forest, were tired. And to-day we go out on a long and terrible
  journey to find fish and rubber for Sandi and his king."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[*salt = pardon]</p>

  <p>"That is a good palaver," said Bones satirically, as he glared at the
  hunting party through his eyeglass. With the exception of Makara, they were
  very fat young men, whose flabby flesh suggested anything but prolonged
  exercise. "But first you shall tell me what place is this."</p>

  <p>He pointed to a bare square of hard earth, where once a slave pen had
  stood&mdash;recently, he guessed. It had its fellow a few paces down the
  slope towards the river. His quick eyes detected a third and a fourth. Four
  big huts that had been recently demolished. There were others in all
  probability, if he looked for them.</p>

  <p>Makara answered glibly enough, but his explanation was lame. Bones watched
  the hunters disappear through the thin woods that lead to the greater forest,
  and then he called an assembly of all the people, and went up to the palaver
  house, to find himself confronting a crowd of a thousand sober-faced
  women.</p>

  <p>"O people," said Bones, "I have come a long way because my lord Sandi
  cannot make this journey to see you. By night and by day I have journeyed in
  my canoe along a terrible little river to take taxes for my king. And none
  are here. For the men who should be warriors and hunters are like children,
  and have grown lazy, so that there is no rubber or fish for my Government.
  Now I will tell you a story about bees that you may tell your children and
  your men."</p>

  <p>Bones had an amazing vocabulary. They listened fascinated whilst he told
  the story of the economy of the hive. When he had finished, T'lini, who was
  squatting at the foot of the little hill, rose.</p>

  <p>"Lord, that is a great riddle," she said. "Now tell me and my sisters:
  these little things who fly and do no work&mdash;are they men folk or women
  folk?"</p>

  <p>"Men folk," said Bones, in an unguarded moment.</p>

  <p>"And, lord, those who work and gather riches&mdash;what are they?"</p>

  <p>Bones explained again; became a little inarticulate as they drew him out
  of his depth.</p>

  <p>"That is a good tale," said T'lini, when he had finished. "Rubber we have
  got, and the skins of wild beasts, but we do not see these things again, and
  when we ask our lords they say that Sandi has come with his soldiers and
  taken them for his Government. Now tell us, lord Tibbetti, how may the women
  bees live through the cold, wet days, but do not the little things that fly
  and do no work eat up all the riches the women bees have gathered?"</p>

  <p>Bones, sure of himself, explained.</p>

  <p>"T'lini, that is a good question. Now I will tell you. They who do no work
  are killed when the wet days come, for the little women bees drive them from
  the nest and destroy them. And the next season come new little men and they
  last their season, and at the end are killed."</p>

  <p>"Who rules this land of bees?" asked T'lini.</p>

  <p>"One who is higher than any&mdash;a queen," said Bones, waxing poetical;
  "one who is as great as Sandi and wiser than I. And all the bee-women honour
  this one and bow their heads and clap their hands with joy whenever this high
  one walks abroad."</p>

  <p>He saw nearly a thousand mouths opened in amazement and was gratified.</p>

  <p>Later that day he sent a messenger with a letter to Sanders.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Sir dear sir [it ran rapidly],</p>

  <p class="letter">Kobalarber is full of feamales feemailes femmales but the
  men have gone hunting I don't think I don't think.</p>

  <p>[Bones had this little trick of repetition.]</p>

  <p class="letter">I talked about beas bes and how they worked in a scentific
  sientific manner. Femails deeply impresed. Shall stay the week am giving
  annother leckture on botny to-morow.</p><br>

  <p>A month later he returned to headquarters.</p>

  <p>"Did you give 'em any science?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Bee-ology, dear old sir&mdash;the habits and customs of the jolly old
  bumble, and a few words about the naughty old honey-maker, as per my letter
  of the 24th inst. The whole proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to
  the chairman."</p>

  <p>"Did you see Makara?" asked Sanders.</p>

  <p>Bones smiled.</p>

  <p>"Not too much, sir. I stayed in the village four days, and the naughty old
  deceiver and his boy friends didn't come back. They'd only gone about four
  miles into the forest."</p>

  <p>He struck a more serious note when he told the results of his
  investigations.</p>

  <p>"Slavery, eh? I was afraid so," said Sanders gravely. "An ingenious idea,
  and not the first time it has been practised in the Akasava country."</p>

  <p>He sent for a carrier pigeon and, writing a message, flew the bird to one
  of his spies on the Upper River. Long before the order for Makara's arrest
  could be executed, there was an alarming outbreak of science at
  Kobala'ba.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A few nights after Bones' departure, Makara squatted by the
  fire of his hut, relating to certain close friends, counsellors and male
  sycophants, the details of a summary administration of justice. For he had
  taken T'lini his wife and had beaten her till he was tired, and she had run
  away into the forest to join a party of wives in their search for a
  peculiarly succulent monkey that was very satisfying to Makara's epicurean
  taste.</p>

  <p>"She cried 'Wow!' and put her hands up," said Makara with relish. "Then
  she made a great noise and put her arms so..."</p>

  <p>He stopped, peering up the village street towards the wood, where a small
  column had emerged from the trees&mdash;a column that must be made up of
  hunting parties that were not due for days, and should have been scattered,
  through the hundred and fifty square miles of game preserves. They marched
  steadily, carrying neither monkeys nor skins, and there was something very
  peculiar about their solidarity. Ominous, too, for the red of the setting sun
  turned their spear-heads to the colour of blood.</p>

  <p>"O woman," said Makara, in a passion, as T'lini approached him, "I will
  whip you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A spear-head dropped to his throat and pricked him sorely. He collapsed in
  a panic and was incapable of resistance, as two strong women bound him foot
  and hand. They laid the forty-seven males of Kobala'ba, fan fashion, about
  the palaver house, and T'lini, the chief's wife, spoke.</p>

  <p>"Tibbetti, the son of Sandi, told us this tale," she said, looking down at
  the horrified face of her husband, who was the victim nearest to her. "Cala
  cala all the bee women worked and gathered their magic from flowers, and the
  bee men sat at home in their huts and ate all that was brought to them, and
  did no work and killed their wives. And then all the bee women held a palaver
  and they said: 'From this day we will kill the bee men at the end of every
  season, and in the next season we will get new men and kill them also when we
  are done with them.' And Tibbetti said that because of this great magic all
  the bee people are happy, so that you hear them singing as they go about
  their work. Tibbetti told us this, and he is wise, for he has three eyes and
  sees more than we."</p>

  <p>She walked to the side of her husband and looked down at him, her spear
  poised.</p>

  <p>"Now I think we shall be happy," she said, and struck as he had taught
  her...</p>

  <p>So slowly did news travel in that backwater of life that it was nearly a
  month before Sanders heard of the happening. It was brought by a lithe woman
  warrior who carried her spears with an air.</p>

  <p>Sanders listened, and, seasoned as he was to strange happenings in this
  strangest of lands, the simple recital took his breath away.</p>

  <p>"And now there are no men in obala'ba," concluded the messenger, "but next
  season we will go to the river villages and take such as we wish. But, Sandi,
  we wish for a ruler, and because we know you are kind to your people we have
  had a great palaver, and this is agreed, that we ask you, Sandi, to send us
  your son Tibbetti, that he may be our Queen Bee according to his magical
  words."</p>

  <p>"Deuced awkward," said Bones dismally, as he pulled at his long nose.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">II. &mdash; THE TERRIBLE TALKER</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Grand Magazine</i>, September 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was a man of the Isisi whom all feared&mdash;even the
  very chief of that nation. He was no great warrior, nor was he skilled in
  magic. His name was M'anin and he was of the common people: a tall, thin man
  with a stammering voice, who did no more than talk. But his talk was very
  bitter and he respected nobody. Once, in the days of his beginnings, the
  chief of his village (afterwards chief of the tribe, and eventually hanged
  for the murder of a missionary) had taken a pliant <i>chicotte</i> and had
  gone in search of the talker. And M'anin had seen him coming and was
  panic-stricken, for he had spoken very evilly of this chief and certain of
  his wives. Yet, though his heart was like water, he met the chief with
  outward insolence, having in his soul the dim beginnings of a theory which
  happened to be right; and this theory was that he who talks and talks and
  supports one boldness with another may cow even the strongest and most
  enraged man or woman.</p>

  <p>"I see you, chief," he greeted, his furious master. "Oh ko! You are like a
  monkey that is caught by a spear! Now I must tell you the truth&mdash;you
  have a bad face and you are no proper chief for this village. And if Sandi
  knows this he will, put you away."</p>

  <p>So strong and bold were his words that the chief wilted before him.</p>

  <p>"M'anin, have I spoken evilly of you? Have I done ill to you? And yet you
  make me foolish before my people."</p>

  <p>M'anin looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I speak truth, and if any man be hurt by truth that is his palaver. I
  speak as my mind is&mdash;even to Sandi."</p>

  <p>He grew to maturity well hated but uninjured. Men, and women too, went out
  of their way to placate him; choice foods came to his house, lest the giver
  writhe under the lash of his criticism. Though the Isisi are river folk, and
  uncleanliness an abomination, none cavilled at M'anin, who never brought his
  body to the water. He dwelt apart with a fat woman, in shape like a beetle,
  and she was the audience on whom he practised when others failed. He neither
  hunted nor worked, and because he brought little to his own larder he was
  wont to sit at food with such families as advertised the excellence of their
  meals by the fragrance of their cooking pots. And none dared deny him for
  fear of his tongue.</p>

  <p>And sometimes he would stand with his back to a tree, surrounded by young
  men, and talk of the badness of such things as were in their eyes good. In
  his eyes the wealthy Ogani, the hunter, and Wlini, whose canoes haunted the
  river, were an offence, and he reserved his bitterest gibes for those who had
  passed him in the race.</p>

  <p>"Let all people look at Ogani, whom men call a great hunter. To me he is
  like a fish upon land, leaping here and there and opening and shutting his
  silly mouth...Oh, people, why do you shiver at Sandi? For is he not a man
  with one life and can he eat two meals at once? He is no great ruler, for did
  not the crops fail?"</p>

  <p>Sanders may have heard of this, but he was very lenient with talking men,
  and M'anin, satisfied with his daring, did not repeat his slander.</p>

  <p>Then one fatal night somebody spoke of Bones. Now Lieutenant Tibbetts
  might be a figure of fun to his immediate associates. He was undoubtedly a
  rather impetuous young man, who both said and did irresponsible things. But
  to the people of the upper river Tibbetti was lank vengeance who had stalked
  evil men and had hanged chiefs without mercy; the memory of the staccato
  rattle of his machine-gun remained with certain tribes for a long time.</p>

  <p>"This Tibbetti is no more than a fool," said M'anin. "Also he has no eyes,
  but puts a little glass where his eye should be."</p>

  <p>"Oh ko, M'anin!" said one of his shocked hearers. "Did he not destroy the
  Leopards that crept into our huts at night and left us without faces?"</p>

  <p>He spoke of that strange secret society which is known in one form or
  another from one end of Africa to the other.</p>

  <p>"Oh ko!" mocked M'anin. "Did he not bring soldiers by tens and tens to do
  this little work? And are not the Leopards friends of the people?"</p>

  <p>His words created a sensation. Never before had any man openly defended
  these terrible people. Intoxicated by his success, M'anin, who would as
  readily have championed the forces of the law, given sufficient provocation,
  went on:</p>

  <p>"These Leopards are wonderful folk and have a great ju-ju. And to-day they
  live. I with my eyes have seen them. They are very kind to poor men and very
  hard to rich men. He who is a Leopard is great in the eyes of ghosts and it
  is said that M'shimba M'shamba himself is their mighty spirit."</p>

  <p>This was the beginning; the idle words of a talkative man bore fruit in
  the Isisi, but it was nipped in the blossoming stage by the chief of the
  Ochori.</p>

  <p>By all standards wherewith despotic kings may be judged, Bosambo of the
  Ochori was a wise ruler. For he had the prime instinct of government
  &mdash;he knew to the second when he must give way and when he must stand,
  granite-like, be the prospect never so dark and the dangers appalling. He was
  not to be moved by such trifles as personal popularity or unpopularity, so
  that, when a small chief who was an admirer of M'anin made a bad song about
  Bosambo and likened him to a snake and a fish and a particularly comical
  ju-ju (one of those ju-jus of ancient times whose potency had atrophied) he
  sent no summons to the poet, nor did he visit upon him the weight of his
  anger.</p>

  <p>Only in the days of the taxations, M'lipi, the chief in question, found
  that his contribution to the state was stolen en route to the Ochori city,
  and he had to levy yet another toll upon his cursing village.</p>

  <p>And when his spies brought news of old men gathering secretly in the woods
  and speaking against him as an oppressor of the people (which he was not) and
  a rapacious foreigner (which he was), he said insulting things about the
  intelligence of old men and said no more. But when, in a quiet place, four
  men came together and said: "These are the days of women&mdash;Wa! I have not
  drawn blood with my claws," and that speech was reported, Bosambo called his
  six best captains to him.</p>

  <p>"In such a village are four men who are Leopards. Go swiftly and kill, but
  let no man see the killing."</p>

  <p>And the captains went out by night and travelled till dawn, when they
  slept through the day. At night they moved again and by diligent enquiry
  found the spot where the new Leopards held a lodge.</p>

  <p>They were talking over the matter of initiations when the six appeared
  with their shields on their arms and their killing spears in their hands.</p>

  <p>"Come with us," said the chief of the six, and led them away to a deep
  ravine, and there they killed them, leaving what was to be left to the real
  leopards who live here in families.</p>

  <p>Bosambo's great hut was on the river side of the city, and between his hut
  and the water were only his fields of corn and the huts of his guard. For a
  time might come when he would need the open space that led to where his three
  big canoes were ranged on the beach.</p>

  <p>Here, in huts so near to the river that you might fish from them, dwelt
  the young men who were spear-men or paddlers as occasion demanded. They were
  tall, straight young men, very strong and terribly brave, and very proud, for
  each man wore a scarlet cotton handkerchief bound about his head which was
  the livery of the king.</p>

  <p>Bosambo sat in the shade of a large grass mat one sweltering day, speaking
  to the chief of his guard, Bosongo, and the talk was of a woman of the Isisi.
  None of his intimate guard was married; marriage meant retirement to the mass
  which did not wear handkerchiefs about their heads.</p>

  <p>"Lord Bosambo, I think my time is come, for this woman is very wonderful
  to me and her father is rich. I will build a hut and be your man and you will
  make me the head of a fighting regiment, as you made T'furi and M'suri Balana
  and other men."</p>

  <p>Bosambo pulled steadily at his long-stemmed pipe, and obscured the still
  air with a cloud of rank-smelling smoke.</p>

  <p>"This I will do, Bosongo, but the Isisi are a strange folk and will not
  let their women cross the river to live in a strange land. Now here in the
  Ochori are women in plenty."</p>

  <p>Bosongo nodded, which meant his disagreement.</p>

  <p>"This girl is strong for me, and when her father has given me the salt and
  rods and goats which come with her, I will bring her by night in a canoe to
  this land and that will be the end."</p>

  <p>But Bosambo was not so easily convinced. A breach or two of national
  custom meant little to him, but here was a possibility of trouble, for the
  Isisi at this moment was in its most truculent mood. The harvest had been
  good, men were rich in corn and salt, and in such circumstances the risk of
  war was great.</p>

  <p>"If there is a killing palaver what may I say to my lord Saudi, who is
  almost my brother? For did we not go to the same mission school and learn of
  Marki, Luki and Johnni which are white men's mysteries? I will think of this,
  Bosongo, and in one day and two days I will tell you what is in my mind."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Bosongo eagerly, "there will be no bad palaver; for this
  woman has often come to my house with her father and his paddlers."</p>

  <p>Bosambo stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"I have seen no little chief of the Isisi in this city," he said.</p>

  <p>Bosongo grew uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"He brought her by night, knowing how I love this woman. In the morning he
  took her away."</p>

  <p>Bosambo said nothing more, but with a lordly wave of his hand dismissed
  his guard.</p>

  <p>That evening between the lights came a spy of his from the Isisi, for
  Bosambo took no chances. The Leopardism which four machine-guns and a company
  of Houssas had stamped out three years before was rampant again from the
  Lower Akasava to the Upper Isisi, though the rope that hanged the chief of
  the Leopards still swung its ravelled strands in the breeze.</p>

  <p>For an hour they sat in conference in the dark of his hut, the spy and the
  chief of the Ochori. Then in the darkness the spy crept away, followed the
  river's course for a mile till he came to a canoe with five paddlers, and in
  the bottom of the canoe a man bound with native rope and gagged
  uncomfortably. He spoke a few words and, stooping, the paddlers lifted their
  prisoner from the bottom of the canoe, stayed long enough to pull the boat
  high and dry before they cut the bonds of the man's feet and took the gag out
  of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Walk with me, little Leopard," said the spy.</p>

  <p>They gave the man a drink of water.</p>

  <p>"If you speak what is true to Bosambo he will do you no hurt," they told
  him, and with this assurance he walked silently in their midst until they
  came to the edge of the Ochori city, through which they led him by back ways
  to Bosambo's great hut, where it was his practice to sleep alone.</p>

  <p>And there he talked and talked and talked, being rendered the more
  loquacious by large draughts of native beer. In the end Bosambo was well
  satisfied. That night came three Isisi Leopards who had learnt in some
  mysterious way of the killings in the ravine. They came noiselessly in one
  black canoe, and, threading their way between the habitations of his guard,
  came to the king's hut. And on their hands were gloves of leopard pads with
  ripping steel claws, which is the insignia of the society. One wormed his way
  into Bosambo's hut and struck with the knife he carried, and when he felt the
  body shudder, he used his clawed pad as the ritual directed..</p>

  <p>The murderer was crawling to the door when a huge hand gripped his neck
  and thrust his face downward, in another second a knee was in the small of
  his back. He tried to fight up, but only for a second. A short club of
  dried-rubber struck him. When he recovered consciousness he was sitting with
  his back against a tree; the ghastly glow of dawn was in the sky, and even as
  he blinked from left to right the sun was up.</p>

  <p>"O man, I see you," said Bosambo. "Behold this evil thing which you have
  done!"</p>

  <p>He looked to the right and the prisoner's eyes followed. He saw the
  captured Leopard lying stark and awful to see. The two paddlers who had
  accompanied him he did not see, for they were dead in the river.</p>

  <p>"This man you have killed, therefore you go to Sandi for his judgment,"
  said Bosambo virtuously; "for I cannot kill you because I have spoken my
  word, and in the country where I govern for Sandi and his king no man breaks
  the law. But first you will tell me who sent you, also who is the new chief
  of your Leopards and many other interesting and beautiful things."</p>

  <p>The prisoner glared at him.</p>

  <p>"The Leopard hates and dies," he said conventionally. "Well you know,
  Bosambo, that we Leopards do not speak of our dreadful ju-ju."</p>

  <p>"You shall speak to me," said Bosambo, "and if you hate, then by Ewa!
  which is death, you shall hate me worse before you die at the end of Sandi's
  long rope, with all his soldiers mocking at you."</p>

  <p>An hour later he squatted down at a box and began a laborious epistle, all
  the more laborious because he wrote on that which was as thin as cigarette
  paper, using a pen. When he had finished, the pigeon was waiting, and the
  message was bound about one red leg.</p>

  <p>"Go swiftly, little friend of soldiers," said Bosambo, and flung the bird
  high.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At Houssa headquarters was a very irascible Chief Staff
  Officer, who hated Lieutenant Tibbetts with a hatred beyond
  understanding&mdash;unless you allowed for the fact that he drank too much
  and suffered from a complication of tropical diseases all of which were
  disturbing to a man's temper in a country where one hundred and two in the
  shade is considered fairly cool.</p>

  <p>His name was Omes, and the words of Omes, written and spoken, were
  calculated to disturb even the serenity of a young man so perfectly balanced
  and so completely lost to a sense of inferiority as Bones.</p>

  <p>They met once when Major Omes was on a tour of inspection.</p>

  <p>"Very nice, very nice indeed!" he said after inspecting company accounts.
  "I suppose you are the officer responsible?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bones, purring.</p>

  <p>"It was not done by an il-lit-er-ate savage who had recently learnt the
  ru-di-ments of the English language?"</p>

  <p>He spoke like that.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Bones.</p>

  <p>"You will pardon my error," said Major Omes sweetly, "but ex-am-ining
  these accounts, in-de-cipherable as they are, my mistake is nat-ural. Never
  in my life have I seen su-ch a horror!"</p>

  <p>And so on. He wrote in the same strain&mdash;and wrote weekly.</p>

  <p>Bones had passed a restless month in the pursuit of knowledge and the
  forgetfulness of certain unpleasantnesses. It was by no means a quiet
  pursuit. When Bones was intensely interested in a subject, he employed quite
  a lot of his waking or talking moments, the terms being synonymous, in an
  endeavour to work up his unfortunate friend to an interest of the same
  intensity.</p>

  <p>It was not a correspondence course on which he was engaged; somebody had
  sent him a book on Transmigration. It must have been written originally for
  children, for he understood every argument.</p>

  <p>The passing on usually began at breakfast, and Hamilton, who recognized
  the symptoms, would make a fine effort to head off the student to the
  contemplation of sordid and mundane things.</p>

  <p>"Do you realize, dear old sir," began Bones, on this morning, "that the
  soul, bein', as it were, a jolly old transient, that is to say a thing that
  is always poppin' off here an' there&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly pop off to the clothing store after breakfast and count
  the trousers&mdash;short&mdash;drill?" asked Hamilton. "And when you've
  finished popping there, will you pop over to the company office and check the
  medical history sheets of the detachment? Major Omes has written."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, dear old Ham. But leave old Omes out of it, old boy&mdash;why
  make me sick, dear old emetic?" said Bones. "What I mean to say is, dear old
  sir, do you realize that your soul was once in a duck, old boy&mdash;or maybe
  a snake, old officer? Perfectly ghastly, isn't it? On the other hand, dear
  old Ham, how well you've got on! It's quite possible, Ham, that once you were
  just a jolly old cat! I might have been hoofin' you off the verandah for
  pinchin' the chop!"</p>

  <p>"You were most certainly a laughing jackass," growled Hamilton, "or a
  parrot."</p>

  <p>"Bird of Paradise, dear old soul," said Bones instantly. "It's rum, Ham,
  but I've often dreamt I was flyin' with feathers stickin' out of my jolly old
  nut.''</p>

  <p>"That was when you were an angel, you silly goop," growled Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"My point is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, DO shut up, Bones!" groaned Sanders.</p>

  <p>Bones bowed.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't object," said Hamilton later, when he and Sanders were alone,
  "but as usual he is demoralizing the detachment. Abiboo, who is a strict
  Mussulman, got up in the air because Bones suggested he might have been once
  a guinea-pig."</p>

  <p>But Mr. Tibbetts' obsession did not end with the suggestion that he had
  met his companions in other incarnations. His own reminiscences were a little
  trying.</p>

  <p>"I had it this mornin', old boy," he said to Hamilton. "Just a flash, dear
  old officer; it all came back. Rome, dear old Nero, the Hippodrome where the
  poor old johnnies were being burnt to death&mdash;everything."</p>

  <p>"Were you Nero or the Hippodrome?" asked Hamilton wearily. "I suppose you
  really mean the Coliseum?"</p>

  <p>"One of those halls, Ham. There was Nero sittin' in a stage box all gold
  an' purple; there was me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the orchestra?" suggested his bored friend.</p>

  <p>"No, Ham&mdash;in the pit, bein' chased by lions all over the beastly
  ring. I sort of felt his naughty old nose on my shoulder an' he was just
  goin' to grab me when I came to myself."</p>

  <p>"Pity," said Hamilton "If you'd only waited a second I should be applying
  for a new subaltern."</p>

  <p>Bones shrugged his shoulders and went back to his hut to finish a letter
  which he had begun and which was addressed to 'The New Incarnation: a Journal
  of Consciousness'.</p>

  <p>The hobbies of Bones would have been fairly unimportant but for this
  illusion of his, that every new idea which struck him was something well
  worth imparting to others.</p>

  <p>Then came the pigeon with Bosambo's warning in scrawled Arabic. Sanders
  read and was troubled. He had that uncanny instinct for first causes, and for
  an hour he pondered the dramatic reappearance of the Leopards and found at
  the end a satisfactory explanation.</p>

  <p>He, sent for Bones, and to his astonishment Mr. Tibbetts came, holding a
  fluttering telegraph form in his hand, and on his face a most woebegone
  expression.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble?" asked Hamilton. "Has dear old Omes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Popped off, old boy," said Bones dismally. "Gathered to his dear old
  papas. Fearfully bad luck."</p>

  <p>"Omes?" asked Hamilton, raising his eyebrows incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Jolly old angel," said the gloomy Bones, "practically speaking. I've
  never been so fearfully upset in all my life."</p>

  <p>"Dead?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Almost, old boy. Collapsed&mdash;rushed him on the steamer. Terrible old
  wreck."</p>

  <p>Major Omes had indeed all but gone the way of humanity. Following a heavy
  night at mess, and a hot morning, and a misguided attempt to reduce his
  obesity with a new and patent apparatus there almost occurred a vacancy in
  the Army List.</p>

  <p>"Very bad luck," said Sanders, who in such moments as these was no
  sentimentalist. "But I want you to take twenty men and a machinegun into the
  Isisi country, arrest M'anin and bring him to headquarters. Arrest also
  Tigisaki and B'welo..." He named half a dozen names. "And if they oppose,
  shoot. The Leopard is putting his head up. This time bring back the whole
  skin."</p>

  <p>Bones left in the <i>Zaire</i>, and for the time being forgot his studies.
  There was excuse for his forgetfulness; for ten days he chased Tigisaki and
  his ten novitiates through the swamps to the edge of the Old Man's Country.
  Another week he spent prying into strange rites which had been performed in
  the sickle light of the moon. It was a ghastly business, involved certain
  unpleasant diggings, but in the end the Leopard's claws were drawn and Bones
  and his twenty soldiers ploughed through the forest to the Isisi city, and
  there he sat in judgement in the little palaver house on the verge of the
  river.</p>

  <p>M'anin came, full of faith in his magical conversation, though he stood
  between two Houssas with fixed bayonets.</p>

  <p>"I see you, Tibbetti," he said, with easy insolence. "Now I will tell you
  truly, for in the full of the moon there came a new strong spirit into me,
  and it seemed that the soul of a strong white man had come to my heart."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said Bones, who was instantly the student of psychology. It was in
  the full of the moon that the truculent Major Omes had been struck down in
  his pride.</p>

  <p>"That is what my heart felt," said M'anin; "an I can speak to you without
  fear, for you are only a small man and very foolish. You are like a child,
  and men laugh at you. I have seen none so like the little monkey who sits on
  the trees."</p>

  <p>Bones listened agape, and, satisfied with the impression he had made,
  M'anin the talker went on.</p>

  <p>"Now you shall leave me and these people and go away," he said; "and I
  will bring the Leopards back. For did I not raise them up when they were
  dead, and teach them to go into the forest with claws, and sit while they
  danced and made their magic? This I tell you because I do not fear you. You
  are like a fish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly Bones' accusative finger shot out. "Omes, dear old boy," he
  squeaked in English, "you've got into the wrong body&mdash;and you're for
  it!" He turned to Sergeant Abiboo.</p>

  <p>"O man, put a rope on that tree," he said.</p>

  <p class="first">THERE was once an earnest administrator who brought to the
  control of all the territories a sense of order which was almost devastating
  in its thoroughness.</p>

  <p>He discovered, as so many men new from armchairs in Whitehall have
  discovered, that (to quote his own report):</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"The laws of the native territories are in a condition of
  chaos. In some areas tribal customs are accepted by responsible officials as
  adequate substitutions of the law. In other areas, there has come to be
  observed a compromise between the laws sanctioned by the Imperial Government
  and laws which apparently are based upon the primitive reasonings of the
  native tribes and peoples."</p><br>

  <p>He set himself to rectify this undesirable state of affairs, and in four
  years produced a compromise of his own which is still known as the "Little
  Tich Code" wherever hot and sarcastic magistrates, commissioners and
  commanders of troops meet to discuss their morning peg.</p>

  <p>There were many objectionable customs practised in the territory
  controlled by Mr. Commissioner Sanders. Given an expeditionary force, the
  liberal employment of machine-guns and a couple of years of martial
  subjugation; these habits of the people would (possibly) be eradicated.</p>

  <p>Behind Sanders in his more drastic treatment of native misbehaviour was
  the implied sanction of the people he punished. He stamped out the general
  practice of witchcraft and human sacrifice, he discouraged with rope and
  irons the formation of secret societies, he dealt hardly with raiders, but he
  walked warily when he had to deal with customs which were logically sound,
  however revolting they might be in the eyes of civilized Europe.</p>

  <p>And, peculiarly enough, one of the most revolting of these found favour in
  the eyes of the busy administrator, as he stated, in an article brightly
  intituled <i>Notes and Observations on Primitive Customs</i>, and published
  in a magazine which is only to be seen in the reading rooms of ancient clubs
  and the waiting rooms of modern dentists.</p>

  <p>One day (long after the administrator had been replaced) there came a
  letter to headquarters. It was addressed to "The Officer, Controller or
  Commissioner in charge."</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts occupied that responsible position, for Sanders was in
  the Isisi on a tour of inspection, and Captain Hamilton had gone a three-day
  journey into the bush to shoot leopards.</p>

  <p>Bones opened the letter and discovered that it was intended for him. How
  otherwise could be regard a document which began:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Sir,</p>

  <p class="letter">I am addressing this in the faint hope that it may fall
  into the hands of an official with the glimmerings of scientific knowledge.
  It matters not to me what rank you be, sir, provided you are intelligent,
  alert to the decadence of the age and the effete tendencies of so-called
  civilization....</p><br>

  <p>Bones answered the letter, and there began a correspondence which
  continued for the greater part of a year.</p>

  <p>Nobody really bothered their heads about Bones and his correspondence.
  Sanders observed that from time to time weighty volumes appeared from their
  wrappings. Hamilton noticed the growing studiousness of his subordinate.</p>

  <p>"Taking a correspondence course, Bones?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir"&mdash;very gravely.</p>

  <p>"How to learn the saxophone in three lessons?"</p>

  <p>Bones smiled pityingly.</p>

  <p>"Or is it 'Every man his own lawyer'?"</p>

  <p>Bones shrugged. "Dear old officer, why burble, dear old sir? Why blither?
  Bad symptom, Ham, old boy&mdash;fearfully bad. It shows the epiglostium's all
  wrong, old officer; your medella's not functioning, old Ham!"</p>

  <p>When he had gone, back to his hut:</p>

  <p>"Bones is taking some sort of medical course," said Sanders. "By the last
  mail he had a book on Eugenics."</p>

  <p>Hamilton was not absolutely sure what eugenics were: he tackled his
  subordinate on the subject.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't understand it, Ham," said Bones gently. "It's all about your
  jolly old body&mdash;not yours, old boy, but anybody's."</p>

  <p>"Is it something to do with patent medicines?" asked Hamilton
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>Bones' smile was very superior.</p>

  <p>Hamilton was impressed, a week later, to learn that Bones' correspondent
  was no less a man than Sir Septimus Neighbour. Even he had heard of Sir
  Septimus. He lived in Harley Street, where he had for many years been the
  highest paid and the most famous of consultants. He was the author of
  innumerable works on Eugenics, and was the founder of the back to nature
  movement which had once brought him into conflict with the police. Had he not
  led a procession of semi-nudities into Hyde Park to protest against the
  unhygienic character of modern dress? Then he carried his theories into
  practice, adopted for house wear a pair of shorts and sandals. That his
  servants should give him notice was inevitable; that dowagers should sway and
  all but swoon when, calling to discuss growing adiposities, they were
  confronted by an encouragingly thin gentleman in running shorts and sandals.
  His consulting practice fell away. He became (as he said) a victim of medical
  persecution, and, having money and leisure, he plunged deep into a sea of
  newspaper controversy and thoroughly enjoyed himself.</p>

  <p>And then Bones began to give up wearing clothes. He discarded socks and
  puttees and appeared one morning at breakfast in his bare, thin legs.
  Hamilton shuddered but did not protest. A few days later Bones came to lunch
  self-consciously in a sleeveless and diaphanous singlet. These, with shorts,
  constituted his entire raiment.</p>

  <p>"Go back to your quarters and put on a pinafore!" snarled Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Hyjenny, old boy," murmured Bones.</p>

  <p>Sanders said nothing.</p>

  <p>It was rumoured from the Houssa lines that Bones even discarded the
  singlet and had been seen on the beach clad in a sun helmet and a palm fan.
  He did not deny this.</p>

  <p>"Too many clothes, old officer," he said. "Back to nature&mdash;never felt
  better in my life. There's death in the pants, dear old sir
  &mdash;positively!"</p>

  <p>He did not come to dinner that night. Hamilton went over to discover the
  reason, and found Bones' servant anointing his blistered back with cold
  cream.</p>

  <p>"Got to get used to it, old boy&mdash;temp'ry incapacity&mdash;
  ultra-purple ray, old officer&mdash;ouch! Oh, clumsy pig! Go easy with your
  big hands for they are like N'gombi canoes!" This latter in Coast Arabic to
  the anointing servant.</p>

  <p>Subsequently Bones admitted the identity of his correspondent, and even
  Hamilton was impressed.</p>

  <p>"He's coming out," said Bones complacently.</p>

  <p>"Here?" Hamilton looked incredulous.</p>

  <p>"He's coming here," said Bones, and added: "On my invitation."</p>

  <p>"Did he by any chance go through the formality of asking the invitation of
  the Secretary of State for the Colonies?" asked Hamilton coldly. "I realize
  that he's nobody in particular, but did you persuade him to get your
  invitation countersigned by that unimportant official?"</p>

  <p>"Everything's in order, dear old officer." He looked thoughtfully at
  Hamilton. "Old boy, you're wearing too many clothes."</p>

  <p>Bones himself was in his singlet, slightly humped on the back, where
  cotton wool protected his sun-blistered vertebra.</p>

  <p>"The old Neighbour says that the only people who understand life are the
  jolly old indigenous natives. He's going to live with 'em for a year."</p>

  <p>"Does he speak the language, Bones?" asked Sanders, and to his surprise
  Bones nodded.</p>

  <p>It was not surprising that Sir Septimus Neighbour should speak the
  language: he was the sort of man who held by Socrates and his incursions into
  Greek study at the age of eighty&mdash;or was it ninety? He had an
  extraordinary facility for acquiring strange tongues, and in six months knew
  more of the Bomongo tongue than the missionary (home on leave) who taught
  him.</p>

  <p>Sanders fingered his chin thoughtfully. He did not like experiments; liked
  them less when they were carried out by men and women strange to the
  land.</p>

  <p>The next mail brought a letter from Downing Street, which commended to his
  care the body and soul of Sir Septimus Neighbour, K.B.E., M.D. F.R.C.S., and
  the next boat brought the redoubtable specialist him self. He was a small
  man, painfully thin and bald; an irregular greying beard was a decoration to
  a face which badly needed assistance. He wore large horn-rimmed spectacles,
  and his baggage consisted of one suitcase, a butterfly net and a pair of
  rubber boots which were strapped on the outside of the case; His shorts were
  the shortest shorts Sanders had ever seen. From the waist upward he was bare,
  but he hid his boniness under a light drill jacket, a fact for which he
  apologized.</p>

  <p>"I had some trouble on the ship, Mr. Sanders."</p>

  <p>He had a high, shrill voice, and a range of restless gestures which were
  rather fascinating to watch.</p>

  <p>"Prudes, my dear fellow, prudes! These European women are simply
  terrible."</p>

  <p>Sanders glanced at Bones, who had gone down to meet the scientist. He,
  too, was self-consciously bare to the waist; his jacket pocket
  bulged&mdash;the Commissioner guessed that the singlet had been removed at
  the last moment.</p>

  <p>"The people at home wish me to send you to one of the most primitive of
  our tribes," said Sanders, "and I have sent word to prepare a hut for you in
  the Lulanga district. They are so near to nature"&mdash;he concealed a
  smile&mdash;"that even the N'gombi regard them as a little indelicate."</p>

  <p>Sir Septimus did not see the sarcasm. He inclined his head gravely.</p>

  <p>"I could wish nothing better," he said. "As to the hut "&mdash;he shook
  his head. "I have done with huts and houses, flats and mansions. Under the
  bare sky, sir; on good old mother earth, sir. I wish to live as they
  live."</p>

  <p>"They live in huts," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"I shall teach them to sleep in the open&mdash;that is my mission," said
  Sir Septimus with the greatest gravity. "I shall teach them the same example
  as my dear young disciple here has taught them." He waved his hand at the
  blushing Bones. "He tells me that he also sleeps on the bare earth, with a
  berry or two for breakfast, a little raw fruit for luncheon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've often done it," said Bones loudly. "I really and truly have, dear
  old Excellency! Ham, old boy, you'll bear me out: nature has always been my
  long suit, old officer."</p>

  <p>"The last time you went up river," said Hamilton slowly, "you complained
  that there was too much ventilation in the sleeping cabin of the
  <i>Wiggle</i>, and that the mattress wanted remaking. I seem to remember some
  little trouble about your sleeping bag going astray&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Bones had already taken Sir Septimus by the arm and had led him out on
  to the verandah. Later they were seen walking on the beach together.</p>

  <p>"If they'd only worn bathing dresses I wouldn't have minded," said
  Hamilton, in despair. "You've no idea what Bones looked like..."</p>

  <p>He went into gruesome details.</p>

  <p>On the following Sunday morning Sir Septimus left by canoe for the
  Lulanga, and only waited till he was out of sight of the residency before he
  took off the jacket which was his total concession to a hated
  civilization.</p>

  <p>The province of Lulanga is sited at the narrowest part of the Opori River,
  a tortuously winding stream that runs into the forest and remains
  forest-fringed until it runs into the French territory.</p>

  <p>The wisdom and primitiveness of the Lulanga folk were a tradition. Up and
  down the river it was known that since time began the Lulanga people had been
  wise in all their ways and crude in their habits of life. They were a branch
  of the Isisi family, yet owed and paid no allegiance to the King of the
  Isisi. They might be called (and were so called) N'gombi, which means no more
  than "dwellers in the forest," yet they were distinctly riverain folk and
  swam and fished from their childhood.</p>

  <p>Bosambo, no stickler for inherent sovereignty, claimed them for Ochori and
  sent his captains to gather tribute. They paid without protest, but at the
  next grand palaver of chiefs over which Sanders presided, Bosambo made
  restitution and humbled himself.</p>

  <p>For the wisdom of the Lulanga folk lay in this, that they saw to-morrow
  and knew that there were other days beyond, and their primitiveness was
  expressed in their adherence to old customs and the most ancient costume of
  all.</p>

  <p>In all the world there are only three peoples who wear no clothes, and the
  Lulanga was one of them. You must remember that they persevered in this old
  practice in the face of the severest condemnation. There had been, in the
  past, wars waged by their cannibal neighbours to enforce upon them at least a
  homely loin cloth; for the cannibal tribes of Africa are peculiar in this,
  that they are innately modest. But by their wisdom and their skill they had
  defeated their enemies and retained their simple privilege.</p>

  <p>Sanders had argued with them and threatened them, but all to no purpose.
  He was successful in a more reprehensible practice, as old as the other. The
  Lulangas were the last tribe on the river to forgo with some reluctance the
  practice of slaying their stupid and their old. When a man or woman fell ill
  or met with some accident which permanently maimed them, or went mad as
  people do in a land where sleeping sickness is as common as a cold in
  England, then was S'boro called to their aid. S'boro was a mystic devil who
  only became potent if you boiled together three varieties of poison flowers
  and made from them, with a little manioc, a thin red paste. This was laid on
  the lips of the sick, the old, the mad and the feeble, usually whilst they
  were asleep, and in the morning they were dead enough to be buried.</p>

  <p>The author of the "Little Tich Code" had in his article praised this
  practice&mdash;the praise cost him his job and earned the wrath and
  execration of Sanders, who had taken four years to eradicate the practice and
  then had only succeeded by a few judicious hangings. It pained him to punish
  so gentle and wise a people, but only through punishment could the practice
  be arrested. S'boro was no longer laid on sleeping lips, and in the Lulanga
  country there were quite a number of silly old people and crippled men, an
  offence to the fastidious and the cause of an undercurrent of discontent
  which Sanders did not even suspect.</p>

  <p>Sir Septimus arrived on the ninth day of his journey, and the wise chief
  M'bongo and his eight headmen came down the narrow river to meet him and
  escort him to the chief's village. And here in the light of bonfires he
  landed in the dark of night, and saw girls with the figures of Venus and the
  faces of Gorgons dance for him, and the chief gave him raw meal as a sign of
  his love, and led him to the hut that had been prepared for him. This shelter
  was loftily declined.</p>

  <p>"O Chief," said Septimus, in his best Bomongo (by this time he was as near
  to nature as any man who wore only sandals and a helmet could be), "I sleep
  on the ground, for that is my mystery."</p>

  <p>The wise chief told him of what happened to people who slept on the
  ground, and Sir Septimus changed his mind.</p>

  <p>That night there was a long palaver, the chief and he sitting side by
  side, clasping their bare knees before the fire, which was uncomfortably
  hot.</p>

  <p>"Sanders we love, because if we did not love him he would beat us," said
  M'bongo, with simple <i>naivet</i>, "but he has taken away from us many of
  our ancient rules. Also he desired us to cover our bodies like the common
  people of the Isisi, but this we would not do because our father before us,
  and their fathers, did not cover their bodies, and were strong and beautiful.
  Also he said those who suffer may not go to sleep, because it was against the
  white man's law. And lord, who are a friend of Sandi and are wiser than all
  the world, you will know how bad it is for a nation that the old ones who can
  no longer work, and the mad who may bring into the world other mad ones,
  should live as we live. Up and down this river, amongst the Isisi and the
  N'gombi, and even the Ochori who are slaves, and the Akasava, this was the
  rule of the land till Sandi came, that those who could not work should
  die."</p>

  <p>Sir Septimus nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is a good palaver," he said.</p>

  <p>M'bongo stared at him in astonishment and rising hope. "Lord, that is very
  fine talk," he said, "and my people will be very happy."</p>

  <p>Thus launched upon his favourite topic, Sir Septimus Neighbour, K.B.E.,
  etc., expanded into oratory. What he said now he had said in his club a score
  of times to an admiring smoking-room audience.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, what is the use of keeping the old and the sick? This
  country is going to the dogs. Wouldn't it be better to let them pass quietly
  away?&mdash;Why let 'em live and be a misery, my dear friend? It's misery to
  themselves, my dear fellow. It's inhuman, it's unhygienic, it's against all
  the laws of nature..."</p>

  <p>In the more sonorous terminology of the Bomongo tongue he said very much
  the same thing and the wise chief M'bongo and his elders listened.</p>

  <p>A month later one of Sanders' spies came unobtrusively to the Lulanga and
  rested a few days, watched and noted; on the fifth night he went swiftly down
  the little river to the master spy of the area, to whom he gave the news. It
  came eventually to Sanders when he was smoking an after cigar, and the
  Commissioner was worried.</p>

  <p>"Bones' pal is doing a little cock-eyed propaganda work," he said. "It
  doesn't seem possible, but he appears to be undoing all my work in the
  Lulanga, and possibly on the river. Once S'boro gets busy again, the practice
  will hardly be confined to the Lulanga."</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble?" asked Hamilton, waking up with a start, and Sanders
  told him.</p>

  <p>"In the first place," he said, "this old crank has enrolled himself a
  member of the Lulanga nation, and insists upon being treated as a member of
  the tribe and on going out to work in the fields&mdash;that won't do him any
  harm. But what will do him and all of us a tremendous mischief is the eugenic
  doctrines he is teaching."</p>

  <p>He told Hamilton of the theory which the old man was propounding.</p>

  <p>Bones, who had grown a little weary of the back to nature movement and had
  gone to bed early that night in his famous striped silk pyjamas, was awakened
  by his superior an hour later.</p>

  <p>"Sanders wants you to take the <i>Wiggle</i> up river to the Lulanga, dig
  out old man Neighbour and bring him back to headquarters."</p>

  <p>Bones sat up in bed, blinking uncomprehendingly and after Hamilton had
  repeated the message four times, each time with more violence, he
  understood.</p>

  <p>"Dear old Sep," he said, "silly old ass. At the same time, Ham, old boy,
  there's a lot to be said for Sep. The old thing's perfectly right in theory.
  The survival of the fittest, as jolly old Shakespeare said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't give me any lip," said Hamilton coarsely. "Hustle your crew and be
  ready to start at day break."</p>

  <p>Bones rose wearily from his couch and went in search of Yoka, the
  steersman, B'fuli, the assistant engineer, and the six men who formed the
  nominal crew of the <i>Wiggle</i>. To these he added six soldiers. He came.
  at five o'clock in the morning to take coffee with Sanders and Hamilton, and
  he was in a five-o'clock-in-the-morning mood.</p>

  <p>"It's fearfully inconvenient, dear old Ham, getting away without any
  preparations, wicked old sportsman. That beastly mattress is still full of
  bumps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whenever you feel sleepy," said Hamilton coldly, "draw up to the nearest
  bank, eat a couple of berries and go to sleep in a puddle&mdash;be natural,
  Bones!"</p>

  <p>It was an hour after daybreak before the <i>Wiggle</i> was ready to begin
  her voyage, and in that hour a pigeon arrived at headquarters with news which
  resulted in the doubling of the military escort. S'boro was active again, not
  only in the Lulanga, but there had been cases in the fringing villages of the
  Isisi. Old men and women had vanished; a woodman on whom a tree had fallen
  had died of some other cause than his injuries. There was a tag to the
  message which came wrapped round the pigeon's red leg:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">ALSO THE NAKED LORD IS ILL, HAVING EATEN CERTAIN FRUIT
  WHICH GAVE HIM GREAT PAINS IN THE BELLY.</p><br>

  <p>Bones' voyage was not a propitious one. He struck a sandbank that
  afternoon and was left high and dry in the middle of the river till the
  following morning, when sufficient natives could be summoned to push the
  <i>Wiggle</i> into deep water. The chapter of accidents, thus begun,
  continued. He hit a submerged log on the second day opened the tiny forehold
  of the boat, which sank by the head. She had to be beached with some haste
  and the hole filled with cement. She was not an hour from the beach when she
  went broadside on to yet another sandbank, and when she was got off it was
  found that the cement plug was shifted, and she had to be beached again.</p>

  <p>Bones perspired and swore, but his accident was not without value. While
  he was waiting for more thorough repair at the hands of native Isisi workmen
  he learnt of a case of S'boro twenty miles in the forest, and with a dozen
  soldiers he made a forced march and came upon the village in time to
  interrupt the burial of two old men who had conveniently died the night
  before.</p>

  <p>Now the Isisi are not as wise as the Lulanga people, nor are they quite as
  refined in their methods, and the evidence of violent death was here
  apparent. Bones acted promptly. He left the two murderers of the old men
  hanging from one branch of a tree, and brought back the headman of the
  village with irons on his wrist.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said this man in an aggrieved tone, "I have done no harm, for the
  word has gone up and down the river that Sandi is strong for S'boro and has
  sent a wise old man to the Lulanga people to teach them new ways by which the
  useless folk may be put away. What shall we simple people believe, Tibbetti?
  Tell me that."</p>

  <p>Bones turned on him with a mirthless and terrifying smile.</p>

  <p>"O man," he said softly, "Believe the two dead ones I left with ropes
  their necks, for they speak so plainly of what my lord Sandi desires, that
  even the Isisi can understand!"</p>

  <p>Two days passed before he came in sight of the beach. There was M'bongo,
  the wise chief, waiting for him, and all his councillors about him. Bones did
  not wait for the customary greeting, as his foot touched the shore he said:
  "Chief, there is S'boro in this land, and I am come from Saudi to punish
  those who kill. Certain men who are old and mad have died in your village."
  He named them one by one.</p>

  <p>He saw the chief's face fall. For a while he was silent and then: "B'rolu
  taught us this."</p>

  <p>Now "B'rolu" is the name for "Neighbour." Bones was to discover that this
  was the native title that Sir Septimus had chosen.</p>

  <p>"This great wise man is one of our people," said M'bongo proudly. "He
  walks with us like a common man and wears no clothes on his body, and he
  works in the field and makes straw mats."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" asked Bones.</p>

  <p>He saw the chief's expression change.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I think he is a little mad. He is in his hut and will not come out,
  and when we go to him we cannot get in because of the things he has placed in
  the doorway."</p>

  <p>He led the way. On the outskirts of the village was a brand new hut. The
  door was blocked with branches of trees and billets of wood which had been
  hastily gathered in the night by Sir Septimus.</p>

  <p>"O B'rolu!" called the chief.</p>

  <p>A shrill voice spoke from the interior of the hut, and it spoke in
  English.</p>

  <p>"Go away, you blackguard! Don't you dare come in here! Send for Mr.
  Sanders at once. By gad, I'll have you locked up!"</p>

  <p>"Are you there, Sir Septimus?" said Bones anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" demanded the voice.</p>

  <p>Bones had a glimpse of a wild eye staring through the interstices of the
  wood.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you, you young jackanapes. What the devil do you mean by getting
  me up here? Have you any soldiers? I want that man hanged at once. The
  murderous blackguard..."</p>

  <p>After some time the entrance of the hut was cleared and Sir Septimus
  emerged. He was very white and very shaky, and round his bare shoulders was a
  skin rug.</p>

  <p>"Thank God you've come!" he quavered. "I've lived in terror for a week. I
  fell ill, and some of these beastly fellows came in and tried to put some
  stuff on my lips. I had to fight like the devil... the barbarous brutes!"</p>

  <p>"Lord," pleaded M'bongo, when Bones had translated the complaint, "this
  great man asked us to treat him as though he was one of ourselves. It is true
  that one of my young men took S'boro to him, believing he was in pain, but
  this he also taught us to do."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Bones went down to the beach to see Sir Septimus get on
  board the surf boat that was to carry him to the homeward-bound liner, and
  Bones was a little overdressed if anything.</p>

  <p>"Sorry you've had such a bad time, sir," he said a little stiffly, "but
  this back to nature stuff is&mdash;er&mdash;well, dear old Sep. I ask
  you!"</p>

  <p>Sir Septimus regarded him with a jaundiced eye.</p>

  <p>"The whole country is rotten," he snapped, "everything... unhygienic... I
  shall have a few words to say to the Secretary for the Colonies when I get
  back. And you, my poor, unfortunate young man, what are you wearing?"</p>

  <p>"Woollies," said Bones.</p>

  <p>That was his last defiant gesture.</p>

     id="chap04">IV. &mdash; THE GHOST WALKER</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>, May 1928</h3>

  <p class="first">DON MURDOCK came to the territories with three guns and a
  breaking heart. At least he had tried to keep the rifts wedged open and still
  preserved the similitude of hopeless grief and unconquerable despair. It had
  been easy enough that night when the New York skyline was falling astern and
  he had looked over the side of the <i>Berengaria</i> and had seen, almost on
  the verge of tears, the pilot's hazardous climb to the waiting boat.</p>

  <p>This man, thought Donald, swallowing a lump in his throat, was going back
  to a woman who loved him. A sane, shrewd mother of children, who went to
  church on Sundays and scoffed at ghosts. He could not imagine Mr. Pilot and
  Mrs. Pilot facing one another, trembling with fury over the matter of
  manifestations.</p>

  <p>He could not imagine Mrs. Pilot drawing her wedding ring from her finger,
  flinging it on to the table and saying: "I think we are wasting time, Donald:
  you cannot understand and never will understand. You are just puffed up with
  conceit like every other college boy&mdash;you think people are crazy because
  you haven't the vision or the enterprise to get outside your own narrow
  circle..."</p>

  <p>All that sort of stuff, mostly illogical, but very, very, poignant.</p>

  <p>So Donald went tragically to the wilds and made a will before leaving New
  York, leaving half of his four million dollars to Jane Fellaby and the other
  half to found a society for the suppression of Spiritualism.</p>

  <p>Jane had been bitten very badly. She had sat in at seances and had heard
  voices and seen trumpets move and heard tambourines play, and had had other
  spiritual experiences. And she objected to his description of Professor
  Steelfit as a "fake" and her spiritualistic aunt as a halfwit&mdash;and here
  he was sailing for Africa, the home of primitive realities and lions and
  fever.</p>

  <p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders did not like visitors in the Territories. They
  were a responsibility, and usually he ran them up to Chubiri on the lower
  river (which is as safe as Bond Street and much safer than Broadway) and sent
  them back to the ship with a thrilling sense of having faced fearful
  dangers.</p>

  <p>Bones was usually the guide on these occasions.</p>

  <p>"On your right, dear old friends, is the village of Goguba, where there
  was a simply fearful massacre... shockin' old bird named N'sumu used to be
  chief an' the silly old josser got tight an' behaved simply scandalously. On
  the left, dear young miss, is the island where all these old johnnies are
  buried... over there's where a perfectly ghastly feller named Oofaba drowned
  his naughty old self..."</p>

  <p>But the "tourist" with letters of introduction was not really welcome,
  though he or she had little to complain of in the matter of courtesy and
  loving-kindness.</p>

  <p>"Bones, here's a job for you." Sanders looked up from the letters he was
  reading at breakfast. "We are getting a 'Cook' for a couple of weeks."</p>

  <p>Bones sighed audibly.</p>

  <p>"Not me, dear old excellency," he begged. "It's Ham's turn."</p>

  <p>"He's an American," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>Bones was interested.</p>

  <p>He knew America. There was scarcely a town in the United States to which
  he had not written for Folder K, for Lieutenant Tibbetts was a most assiduous
  reader of magazine advertisements, and his touching faith in the efficacy of
  correspondence schools had produced his most expensive hobbies.</p>

  <p>Sanders might not like visitors, but he had a particularly keen admiration
  for wholesome youth, and Donald Murdock was one of those shy and diffident
  boys whose appeal was instant.</p>

  <p>He came with the most unusual credentials&mdash;a letter from the American
  Ambassador in London, supported by a request from Whitehall which was a
  command.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;you can go as far as you like, Mr. Murdock&mdash;which I hope
  will be as far as I like! The country is quiet and Mr. Tibbetts will look
  after you."</p>

  <p>Youth cleaves to youth: Donald took up his quarters in Bones' hut. Within
  five hours of their meeting (the visitor arrived by the mail boat in the
  afternoon) they were swopping love affairs.</p>

  <p>"... not like any other girl, you understand, Bones. If she'd been one of
  those gosh-awful creatures that take up spiritualism, it wouldn't have
  mattered."</p>

  <p>"I knew a girl once," mused Bones. "She was fearfully fond of me, but she
  played bridge. I said to her: 'My dear old lady&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>But Donald Murdock really wasn't interested.</p>

  <p>"When a man like me falls in love, Bones, it's for keeps. Spiritualism!
  Can you beat that? Ghosts and things&mdash;you don't believe in that kind of
  bunk?"</p>

  <p>Here Bones hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Dear old transatlantic cousin," he said, "you can't live in Africa and
  not believe, old boy."</p>

  <p>Don Murdock stared at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Spirits?"</p>

  <p>Bones nodded.</p>

  <p>"Dear old man from Massa&mdash;whatever the place is&mdash;ghosts? Lord
  bless my jolly old life, I've seen 'em!"</p>

  <p>There were ghosts enough on the river, as these two young men were to
  learn.</p>

  <p>There was a king of the N'gombi who had seven sons and the youngest of
  these was a weakling who had never been heard to utter a word until he was
  twelve, though there were tales told by huntsmen who had seen him in the
  forest, where he loved to prowl, of a ghost with whom he spoke at great
  length.</p>

  <p>They had spied on him on nights of moon, and had heard him talk to one
  whom their eyes could not see, though they were trained to find the twigs
  which the big cat leopard had broken with his velvet paw.</p>

  <p>Now the brothers of this boy would have put him away because of his
  madness, for this is the law of the N'gombi, that the mad are dead minds
  which are chained to the earth. But the king of the N'gombi (who was a very
  sick man) liked his son, who was the child of his best-loved wife, and to
  those who sat in family palaver on this matter of life and death he spoke
  with a certain ominous meaning.</p>

  <p>"The day B'lala dies, which of you shall live?" he asked. "For if I say
  'kill' a hundred spears will go against any man even if he be the king's
  son."</p>

  <p>B'lala began talking at large when he was thirteen. He talked of ghosts
  and ju-jus and strange things that only ghosts see. Such as elephants with
  long hairy skin and curved tusks, and crocodiles that flew from one great
  tree to another, and strange beasts with enormous necks and silly
  spade-shaped heads. Once he said that he had lived in the world when it was
  quivering, boiling mud and there was nothing to be seen, no sky or stars or
  sun, because of the thick steam that enveloped all things.</p>

  <p>N'kema, the eldest son of the king, on the pretext of fishing, drew his
  brethren to a secret conference on one of the little islands.</p>

  <p>"It is clear to me that our father will soon die and that the madness of
  B'lala is his madness also. Now all men know that I shall sit in his place
  and be king of the N'gombi. Yet when Sandi came at the third moon to gather
  our taxes, he spoke evilly to me because of some girl that I stole from the
  Ochori folk. Now I saw with these two eyes"&mdash;he covered them both with
  his palms in the conventional manner&mdash;"that whilst Sandi spoke to me,
  B'lala stood near to him and bewitched him with his magic. Now when our
  father dies, let us take B'lala into the forest and put out his eyes and
  leave him to the beasts."</p>

  <p>And all the brothers agreed except one who loved the boy, and even he said
  "Wa," keeping his objection secret.</p>

  <p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders, in his great white house by the river's end,
  heard these stories and was interested. He had an overwhelming weakness for
  sanity, but mad folk did not irk him unless they held high posts and could in
  their craziness call their spears to a killing.</p>

  <p>"It is very queer"&mdash;he puffed thoughtfully at a long cheroot
  &mdash;"I must take a peep at this boy on my next visit."</p>

  <p>Captain Hamilton of the King's Houssas grinned.</p>

  <p>"That corner of the N'gombi is rotten with madness," he said. "They had
  sleepy sickness badly last year&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sanders' headshake interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"It isn't that kind of madness," he said. "B'lala's visions are of the
  world in the course of its creation and development. His talk is
  scientifically sound; he has even described the reptilia&mdash;</p>

  <p class="cp">'The mammoth herds and the lizard birds,'</p>

  <p class="first">and that isn't right. In other words, he seems to have the
  extraordinary power of projecting his mentality back to prehistoric times. I
  can see you are on the point of saying 'rubbish' &mdash;don't! I had a go of
  fever last night and my temper is short."</p>

  <p>Hamilton's nose wrinkled derisively.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, sir. Ask Bones for a solution&mdash;he's nearly imbecile
  himself&mdash;he may be able to interpret his brother halfwit."</p>

  <p>He raised himself in his chair and hailed a distant figure.</p>

  <p>"Bones!" he yelled.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts, of the King's Houssas, changed direction and came
  stalking across the drill ground. He took the three steps of the veranda in
  his stride and saluted formally.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to see me on any regimental matter, dear old officer?" he
  demanded stiffly. "Personal affairs I am not prepared to discuss, but I hope,
  dear old sir, that I know enough about King's Regulations to be respectful,
  dear old tyrant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up," snapped Hamilton. "Anyway, you did pinch my toothpaste."</p>

  <p>"I may have borrowed it, sir an' captain," said Bones gently, "thinkin'
  that you had no use for it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You did take it," growled Hamilton. "I wouldn't have made a fuss about
  that, but you brought back a tube of brown shoe polish, and the first thing I
  knew&mdash;ugh!"</p>

  <p>Bones inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"Accidents will happen, dear old sir." He was offensively respectful. "I
  said to our jolly old North American friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sanders had an idea.</p>

  <p>"Bones, take the <i>Wiggle</i> up to the N'gombi country&mdash;we've got
  to give Murdock some sort of trip, and the country is quiet just
  now&mdash;I'd like you to see B'lala, the son of Ufumbi the king..." He
  explained at length his interest in the boy.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Anyway, he's crazy," said Donald gloomily. "Mr. Sanders
  says he's crazy&mdash;you can't see ghosts any other way."</p>

  <p>"I've seen ghosts, dear old septic," said Bones stiffly.</p>

  <p>"You mean sceptic," corrected the melancholy Donald. "What sort of
  education do they give you in your high schools?"</p>

  <p>"A jolly sight better than they give you in your public schools," said
  Bones hotly, and was nearer the truth than he imagined.</p>

  <p>They were sitting on the foredeck of the <i>Wiggle</i>, that stout launch,
  and the low-lying shores of the Isisi country were moving slowly past them.
  It was the third day of the voyage, and hot&mdash;hotter than anything Donald
  had ever experienced, though as a loyalist he praised New York on a
  sweltering summer day as having it beaten. At Lapori, where he stopped, Bones
  had news that nearly sent him to the right-about.</p>

  <p>"Lord, in the dark hours there came a lokali message from the N'gombi,"
  said the old headman. "The king has died of the sickness mongo, and his son
  is in his place. Also fishermen who came down the river have seen N'gombi war
  canoes and spears, and it is a saying on the river that when the N'gombi goes
  on the water, there are new graves on the little island."</p>

  <p>Bones scratched his chin thoughtfully. In a moment of mental aberration he
  had forgotten to bring his carrier pigeons.</p>

  <p>"This is a bad palaver," he said. "Get me a fast canoe, with strong young
  paddlers, and I will send a book* to my lord Sandi."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[*book = letter]</p>

  <p>In the ordinary relationships of life Bones was as inconstant as an
  English spring day. But Bones, faced with real trouble and real
  responsibility was a being transfigured. He counted heads, and found himself
  with five effective fighting men besides himself and Donald. Fortunately the
  <i>Wiggle</i> carried one very desirable 'spare' in the shape of a machine
  gun, and this he had unpacked and erected on the foredeck. Mr. Donald Murdock
  was intensely interested.</p>

  <p>"Dear old thing," said Bones, "you can paddle downstream in the canoe, or
  you can risk the fearfully hazardous dangers of war. I realize, dear old
  Massachuter, that you're a friendly nation, but if you like to come in you'll
  be fearfully welcome. If there's any last message you'd like to send to jolly
  old Jane, now's your chance."</p>

  <p>Donald elected for war. An hour later the <i>Wiggle</i> pushed her sharp
  nose against the black waters of the river and began her laborious 'climb'
  against the six-knot current to the river city of the N'gombi.</p>

  <p>Power is a potent wine that is liable to turn the heads of the strongest.
  N'kema, the eldest son, did many foolish things. The breath was scarcely out
  of the body of his father&mdash;who died with suspicious
  suddenness&mdash;than he sat himself on the stool of chieftainship and
  summoned all headmen and petty chiefs to a great palaver of the land. Worse
  than this, he conveyed to the Little Leopards his desire for their support,
  and no king in his senses would invoke the aid of that secret society.</p>

  <p>It was the time when the Little Leopards flourished; no longer were their
  mutilated victims found, but they had their strange rites, their dances, and,
  if the truth be told, their secret killings.</p>

  <p>When one of the brothers expostulated, the new king cut him short.</p>

  <p>"Must I not bring all magic and power to keep me where I am?" he asked.
  "Does not Sandi hate me? Now, if he sees my strength, and knows that all men
  are for me, he will let me sit quietly, and one day will come and put on my
  neck the medal which my father wore."</p>

  <p>"What of B'lala?" asked one, and the king made a significant sign.</p>

  <p>That night two of his brothers led the ghost walker into the deepest part
  of the forest, where slinking cat shapes move by night and round green moons
  of eyes look hungrily through the cover of the scrub; and there they left
  him. He did not complain, except to say, just before they went away:</p>

  <p>"You would not have done this, but my ghost is gone from me tonight."</p>

  <p>"Where is your ghost?" mocked one.</p>

  <p>"In all the stars," was the answer. "Go quickly before he returns."</p>

  <p>And in terror they fled.</p>

  <p>The new king sat in his big hut, an eager listener to all the stories
  which came to him. Some said that the Ochori were arming against the N'gombi,
  and that Bosambo the king was gathering his regiments for a great slaughter.
  Another whispered of Sandi and his soldiers. Yet another spoke of plots made
  by his own brothers to put him down. So it came about that the maimers of
  B'lala had scarcely returned to the city before they were seized and hurried
  away and no man saw them again.</p>

  <p>The new king sat and listened, and with every fresh tale his fear
  grew.</p>

  <p>His city was an armed camp. Spearmen answered the frantic summons of the
  lokali and came flocking through the forests and the swamps to join the army
  that was assembling.</p>

  <p>"Lord, with whom do we war?" asked an old counsellor.</p>

  <p>"All the world," said the shivering king.</p>

  <p>Some sycophant whispered that the counsellor was an enemy or why should he
  ask this question, and that night the old man was killed in his hut.</p>

  <p>Just before the dawn the king was awakened, and came out of his but to
  find a sweating messenger. The king listened, his teeth chattering; and a
  frightened man is a terribly dangerous man. He sent for his familiars and
  gave them brief instructions.</p>

  <p>"Tibbetti, the son of Sandi is coming with his soldiers. Let all the men
  go to the forest with their spears, and he who is seen by Tibbetti I will
  surely kill!"</p>

  <p>The <i>Wiggle</i> came to a peaceable landing beach, where women were
  dipping their babies in the river and others were beating their clothes upon
  flat stones. There was no sign of warlike preparation when Bones stepped
  ashore; indeed, the atmosphere was favourable as N'kema the king came
  hurrying down to meet his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Lord Tibbetti," he said, his eyes roving the deck for the soldiers, "you
  come at a good time, for my father is dead, and all the people with one voice
  have called me to sit in his seat. Now I will make a great dance for you and
  for your brother."</p>

  <p>He was puzzled by Donald, a stranger, and found the most likely
  explanation for his presence.</p>

  <p>"There will be no dances, N'kema," said Bones curtly. "And as to who shall
  sit in the king's chair, that is for Sandi. I come now to see B'lala, the
  king's son."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence. The chief's discomfort was all too apparent.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said, "this boy has gone a long journey, for he was sick, and
  on the edge of the Isisi."</p>

  <p>"He shall be here by tomorrow," said Bones. "The palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>He walked through the village and was relieved to find none of the
  evidence of feverish activity which invariably marked a change of kingship.
  As for Mr. Murdock, he was frankly disappointed.</p>

  <p>"Where's your old war?" he demanded truculently.</p>

  <p>"Dear old sir," shuddered Bones, "don't talk about it."</p>

  <p>That afternoon, as they sat on the deck under a double canvas shade, there
  came an emissary of the king to offer again the honour of a great dance, and
  this time Bones accepted.</p>

  <p>"Shall we see any ghosts?" asked Donald hopefully.</p>

  <p>"You don't see our kind of ghosts, old boy," replied Bones testily, "you
  feel 'em!"</p>

  <p>Again he spoke prophetically.</p>

  <p>The dance passed without incident, and the two loaded automatics in Bones'
  pocket seemed to be a superfluous precaution. They made their way back in the
  dark to the ship's side, and for the moment Donald Murdock was so entranced
  by the queer gyrations he had witnessed that he forgot that there was such a
  fake in the world as spiritualism.</p>

  <p>They had said goodnight when from the darkness of the bank came a sibilant
  whisper. Bones craned his head forward and listened.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to come into my little ship," he ordered, and they brought into
  his tiny cabin the second younger son of the old king, he who had demurred at
  the destruction of his brother; and the story he had to tell struck all the
  boredom from Lieutenant Tibbetts' face.</p>

  <p>"Lord, if the king knows I have been, he will kill me as he has slain my
  brother," said the man fearfully. "But I tell you this because I love Sandi,
  and because, when he comes to make a chief, he will not forget a son of the
  king who has helped him."</p>

  <p>"Where did they take B'lala?" asked Bones, and the man told him.</p>

  <p>"But, lord, if you go through the woods behind the city, they will kill
  you," urged the man, "for there are more warriors than trees, and each man is
  strong for my brother."</p>

  <p>Bones did not hesitate. He had a short consultation with Murdock.</p>

  <p>"You'll stay here, my dear old New Yorker," he said. "This naughty old
  feller won't do anything tonight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm coming along with you," said Donald recklessly, and in the end his
  insistence prevailed.</p>

  <p>They dropped into a small canoe, paddled softly down the river for a mile
  and, landing at a convenient place (here Donald nearly fell into the water)
  followed their guide for two hours through the dense woods which had hidden
  murders from time immemorial. Once green eyes glared at them ahead; once
  Donald heard the scream of a monkey in the grip of an invisible enemy.</p>

  <p>It was midnight by the illuminated dial on Murdock's wrist when they came
  to a little clearing and saw a figure in the moonlight, reclining against a
  big, lightning-blasted tree.</p>

  <p>"O B'lala," said Bones softly, "I am Tibbetti; the son of Sandi, and I
  have come to take you away to my fine ship."</p>

  <p>He saw the thick lips of the child twist in a smile&mdash;guessed rather
  than saw the horror of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I go to a better place than your fine ship," he said faintly, "for
  this night I shall walk among the stars with my new ghost. Do I speak
  truth?"</p>

  <p>At first Bones thought he was addressing him, but saw the head turn
  slightly to the left and heard the delighted chuckle of the dying boy.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said, "I speak truth. Now I tell you, Tibbetti, that there is
  death in this wood, for this my ghost has told me; also I saw you
  coming&mdash;I who have no eyes! You came in a little boat with my brother,
  and as you landed, the white man who is with you stumbled and fell."</p>

  <p>Donald felt a cold shiver run down his spine.</p>

  <p>"Who told you this?" he said in English, and, to Bones' amazement, this
  boy, who had never spoken any language but his own, answered:</p>

  <p>"He who is by you!"</p>

  <p>Again he turned his head.</p>

  <p>"Lord Ghost, stay with Tibbetti and his friend, and be strong for
  them."</p>

  <p>He waited, his head bent, as though he were listening. Bones saw him nod
  and again heard the delighted chuckle. Then he turned his head.</p>

  <p>"Lord Tibbetti," he said, "my ghost has spoken, and he will be with you
  till you come to your journey's end, and he will be strong for you."</p>

  <p>They waited for a long time, and when he did not speak Bones stooped and
  laid the figure gently on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" he said, and got up, for he knew that B'lala, the friend of
  ghosts, was walking amongst the stars.</p>

  <p>They buried him as best they could and trekked back to the river. Bones
  knew that there was only one hope, and that was to cast off the boat at once,
  risk shoals and sandbanks, and steam through the night to meet Sanders. A
  night in the native mind was an eternity. Perhaps N'kema would strike before
  dawn.</p>

  <p>He struck earlier, as it proved. They were within half a mile of the
  village when a hoarse voice challenged them.</p>

  <p>"Stand for the Little Leopard, white man!"</p>

  <p>"Shoot!" snarled Bones, and whipped out his automatic.</p>

  <p>The forest rang with the staccato crash of shots. Bones went down under
  three N'gombi warriors and waited expectantly for the end. Something struck
  him on the bead...</p>

  <p>It was the consciousness of pain which revived him. The sun was up, and he
  was sitting with his back to a slim tree, his arms most painfully drawn back,
  and knotted on the tree's other side; and within a few feet of him sat Mr.
  Donald Murdock, naked to the waist and bearing marks of battle.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, you alive?... I thought they'd bumped you off," he said
  cheerfully. "What are they going to do?"</p>

  <p>Bones turned his aching head left and right. They were entirely surrounded
  by spearmen; and sitting on his stool of chieftainship immediately before
  them, was N'kema the king.</p>

  <p>"O Tibbetti, I see you!" he mocked. "Where is the great ghost of my little
  mad brother? Is he not by you and will not his strong arm be against me and
  my young men?"</p>

  <p>Bones was puzzled: how did the king know of the meeting in the forest and
  all that the dying boy had said?</p>

  <p>And then his eyes fell on something brown and still that lay in the long
  grass... a wisp of smoke curled up near by... the brother of the king, who
  had led him to B'lala, had told before he too found in death a pleasant
  relief.</p>

  <p>"I see you, N'kema," he said hoarsely, for his throat was parched; "and as
  to madmen and ghosts, are you not mad to do this evil thing, and will not
  your ghost go weeping on the mountains when Sandi comes? Yet I will speak
  well for you and leave a book for Sandi, if you let this young man go." He
  nodded towards the uncomprehending Murdock, for Bones was speaking in the
  dialect of the N'gombi. "For he belongs to a strange people and has no part
  in this palaver."</p>

  <p>N'kema grinned fearfully.</p>

  <p>"O ko! That is the talk of a fool. Now let me see your ghost, Tibbetti.
  And if he is strong he shall hold the arm of my slayer."</p>

  <p>He spat left and right and lifted his hand to his eyes. It was the signal
  to the lithe warrior who squatted at his feet, bending the supple execution
  knife in his hands. Up to his feet he rose and came swiftly before Bones.</p>

  <p>"Speak well for me to all ghosts and devils," he muttered conventionally,
  and swung back his arm.</p>

  <p>Bones glared up at him and did not flinch. The curved knife glittered in
  the sunlight, and then...</p>

  <p>Bones heard a little thud, saw the knife drop from the man's hand, as he
  gripped a bloody elbow with a shriek of pain.</p>

  <p>N'kema was on his feet, grey-brown.</p>

  <p>"O ko!" he gasped. "This ghost...!"</p>

  <p>And then he saw Sanders.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner was standing on the edge of the clearing, and on each
  side of him knelt six tarboshed Houssas, their rifles levelled. Slowly
  Sanders walked across the open and the armed throng flowed back noiselessly,
  each man seeking the kindly obscurity of the forest.</p>

  <p>"I see you, N'kema."</p>

  <p>Sanders' voice was low, almost caressing. And then he pointed to a tree,
  and Sergeant Abiboo, who walked behind him, flung the rope he carried, so
  deftly that the noose slipped down over the smooth branch almost to the level
  of N'kema's neck.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Ghosts&mdash;phew!" Donald wiped his brow. "Did you see...
  just as this bird was going to strike... something stopped him... that beats
  everything."</p>

  <p>Bones coughed. He had seen the new silencers on the Houssas' rifles.</p>

  <p>"We've got a pretty bright brand of bogies, dear old thing," he said.</p>

  <p>Murdock shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've got a new slant on this spiritualistic business. There was something
  there&mdash;I'll swear it...Gosh! it was more awful than being carved
  up!"</p>

  <p>"A common phenomenon, dear old Atlantist," murmured Bones.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to cable Jane and say I'm strong for spiritualism if you get
  the right brand."</p>

  <p>As it happened, it was unnecessary. The Eurasian operator handed him a
  cablegram as he arrived at headquarters:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">YOU ARE RIGHT. SPOOKS ARE BUNK. EXPERTS FOUND PROFESSOR'S
  FINGERMARKS ON TIN TRUMPET. COME HOME. JANE.</p><br>

  <p>Donald shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've got to convince that girl," he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">V. &mdash; THE KING'S SCEPTRE</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">BREAKFAST TIME was the hour of controversy at the residency.
  It was most vehement when Captain Hamilton of the King's Houssas had a little
  touch of liver, or was recovering from the effects of a bout of fever.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts could also be very annoying. He was constantly
  rediscovering obvious things, or revivifying theories that had been decently
  interred in the year dot. Never a trip did he make to hinterland but he
  brought back some marvellous recovery of that which had never been lost.</p>

  <p>"As to the sceptre of the great king&mdash;stuff, Bones! That old yarn has
  been dead a hundred years," snapped Hamilton. "There never was such a thing
  and you know jolly well that native chiefs, they call themselves kings or
  princes or just ordinary trumpery lieutenants&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," murmured Bones, closing his eyes and displaying every
  evidence of Christian resignation.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, they had never had&mdash;sceptres&mdash;or orbs."</p>

  <p>"Or thrones?" asked Bones significantly. "Dear old officer, be reasonable!
  Thrones, old boy, are in the Bible&mdash;you can't get away from it. And
  sceptres, too. I'm absolutely sure, old boy, that one of these old johnnies
  has got his tucked away. Bosambo says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bosambo is a liar, and the maniacal credulity of his dupes is beyond
  understanding."</p>

  <p>"Thank you again, sir and captain," said Bones.</p>

  <p>And here Sanders stepped in.</p>

  <p>"I've heard the yarn hundreds of times, Bones. Haven't they threatened me
  with the Great King's sceptre ever since I've been here? Aren't the nations
  all to be united under one great monarch who will drive us into the sea? And
  have six months passed without an amateur rising and saying 'Behold, I am the
  man?' There have been more wars over that infernal sceptre&mdash;they call it
  'stick,' by the way&mdash;than any other general cause I can remember."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your collaboration, dear old Excellency."</p>

  <p>"'Corroboration' is the word you want," interrupted Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Excellency and friend," said Bones, taking no notice of his
  chief. "And now I'll tell you something&mdash;Bosambo has seen it!"</p>

  <p>He said this with an air of drama, flourished an arm and stepped back to
  watch the effect. Nobody did very much.</p>

  <p>"Bosambo's never seen anything but&mdash;oh, what's the use?"</p>

  <p>Bones smiled pityingly. He had faith in the Great King's sceptre, and had
  dreams of discovering it one day, and of taking his children to the British
  Museum, and there, under a glass case upon red velvet, or possibly blue, this
  mystic symbol of power would be displayed, and on a gilt-edged card placed on
  the other side, so that you might see it whichever way you went round the
  case (and possibly at each end), the inscription: "Presented to the Nation by
  Lieutenant Tibbetts, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society."</p>

  <p>There would follow a short biography which began 'This daring explorer,
  whose name is a household word...'</p>

  <p>And as he dreamt, all things conspired to bring the King's sceptre into
  being.</p>

  <p>The people of the Akasava had no liking foreigners, and woe to the Isisi
  fishermen who poach upon their waters! Yet they took readily enough to
  M'turi, son of O'faka, son of Mofobama because his father was the greatest of
  all the Isisi seers, and had prophesied mighty wars and famines and strange
  signs in the sky; and then he prophesied the death of the King of the Isisi
  so vividly and convincingly that Sanders in his far-away residence came
  quickly in his little ship, only just in time to save the king from the
  effects of aconite poisoning. After he had hanged the seer, and had delivered
  an interesting lecture to all chiefs and headmen on the unprofitable
  character of prophecy, a reaction set in, and M'turi, who was no seer but a
  vain and handsome man, fled to the Akasava and by them was received
  courteously, for, as they say on the river, the Isisi love women, the Ochori
  love food, but the Akasava starve for goats.</p>

  <p>Now M'turi the hunter had no occult powers, but he was a shrewd man; and
  one day, when hunting monkeys on the far south in what was indubitably Isisi
  country, he came to one side of a narrow ravine through which the river ran
  rapidly. Here the stream was narrow. It was indeed one of the many Hell's
  Gates that the river knew.</p>

  <p>There were several places so called on the Great River. It sounded grand
  and thrillingly profane, and each man who named a little canyon had infinite
  faith in his originality. In the main the river is terribly broad, and its
  bed is humped in strange and tantalizing places with great sandbanks which
  have a knack of disappearing in the time of flood and turning up to the
  discomfort of navigators in those parts of the river where hitherto there had
  been deep water and a clear channel. But in three of the gates the river ran
  narrow and strong between high banks. Such ravines are by no means safe in
  storm time, and it was a standing order to all chiefs and headmen that they
  should report any sign of insecure banking.</p>

  <p>M'turi was tired. He lit a little fire and cooked the leg of a monkey,
  deciding to sleep on the ground and return to the Akasava city the next
  morning. He was uneasy, too, for he had heard that the king was weary of
  harbouring a magician who worked no magic.</p>

  <p>Before he rolled himself in the monkey skin robe that early evening, he
  walked to the precipice and sat with his legs dangling over the edge, with a
  sheer drop of a hundred feet below. As he sat, he felt himself slightly
  swaying, as though the ground were moving backward and forward in gentle
  motion. And that could not be for he was sitting on a great rock embedded in
  the earth. All his senses acute, he concentrated his mind upon the motion.
  And then he saw what caused the swaying. There was a high wind, and the
  ground moved in unison with two tall palms which were swaying to and fro.
  They were distant from him nearly fifty yards, and, rising, he walked
  back.</p>

  <p>The palms grew in a deep cleft of earth, and he realized that the whole of
  the ledge was one great rock, so delicately poised that the movement of the
  palm trunks against it was sufficient to set it gently rocking. He followed
  the cleft, recognized it as a breakaway, and knew that it would be only a
  matter of weeks or months before that mass of stone crashed down into the
  river.</p>

  <p>M'turi went back the next morning to the Akasava city, where he had nearly
  overstayed his welcome; for he had prophesied nothing, seen no ghosts,
  pointed out no man or woman in whom little devils had their habitation.</p>

  <p>And he arrived in time for a palaver of elders.</p>

  <p>There had been a slight collision between some huntsman of the Ochori and
  some huntsmen of the Akasava in the northern Akasava territory. Nobody was
  completely killed, but Bosambo, the chief of the Ochori, went swiftly to the
  edge of his territory and summoned the paramount chiefs of the Akasava to
  meet him near the four gum trees which from time immemorial has been the
  palaver place of the two nations. Such was the influence of Bosambo that the
  chiefs came, albeit with some reluctance.</p>

  <p>Right was on the side of Bosambo. The Akasava had been hunting in
  forbidden territory, and Mr. Commissioner Sanders was swift to punish such
  trespass by fines and national impositions.</p>

  <p>"Lord Bosambo, this is the truth," said the chief of the Akasava. "My
  young men have been led into their bad ways by a foreigner, M'turi of the
  Isisi, who lives in my city. This night I will send him back to his people
  and beat him for his wickedness."</p>

  <p>Bosambo said nothing, knowing full well that, but for the magic of
  Sanders' name, there would be trouble with which he could not cope, for half
  his territory was in a mild condition of rebellion over the matter of a hut
  tax which Bosambo had imposed, and he smelt that the chief of the Akasava was
  ripe for war.</p>

  <p>The chief of the Akasava came back to his city in no good mood.</p>

  <p>"I tell you M'turi, that you have brought shame upon the Akasava. For that
  dog Bosambo, whose father was a slave..." (he also particularized the
  mother), "has mocked me as though I were a child or an old man. And but for
  Sandi I would have taken my spears to his country and there would have been
  sad hearts in the Ochori. Now we gave you our hut and our food because you
  were the son of your father, but you have given us no magic nor told us of
  the great things which are coming to us."</p>

  <p>"Lord chief," said M'turi, "hear me! Take your spears to the Ochori, and
  Sandi shall not come, nor his little ship, nor his guns which say 'ha-ha.'
  For great magic shall happen, and my ju-ju shall stand in the river and no
  little ship shall pass him."</p>

  <p>"That is the talk of a fool," said the chief of the Akasava angrily.</p>

  <p>That night they gave him a worn-out canoe, a day's supply of food and an
  ancient paddle, and M'turi's heart was hot with anger against the Akasava for
  the rudeness of their send-off.</p>

  <p>When he had drawn from the shore and gone out of sight of the watchers, he
  made a wide circle, crept back to the beach where the best of the Akasava
  canoes were laid, and, taking the finest, he paddled his way up stream,
  hiding and sleeping by day, and presently came to the Ochori country.</p>

  <p>He was brought into the presence of Bosambo, and squatted at the big man's
  feet.</p>

  <p>"I see you, Bosambo!" he said. "Now I am M'turi, the son of the great
  O'faka of the Isi and because of my father's magic I have come to make a
  great prophecy. You shall take your spears into the Akasava country and you
  shall be king of all this land, of the Akasava and of the Isisi. For I have a
  powerful ju-ju which will stand in the way of Sandi and his soldiers, and his
  little white ship, and his guns that say 'ha-ha,' and this ju-ju will push
  them back, and you shall be lord of this land for ever."</p>

  <p>Bosambo regarded the fine figure of M'turi with contempt. He spat left and
  right and spoke one word.</p>

  <p>"Nigger," he said in English, and signalled the soldiers who stood
  about.</p>

  <p>They took M'turi to the beach, confiscated such of his property as
  remained in the canoe, beat him with rhinoceros hide and sent him, sore and
  vengeful, down the river.</p>

  <p>So, in some trepidation he came back to his own people, and built a hut
  aloof from the Isisi city, and was glad that the sins of his father had been
  forgotten and that the little boys did not mock him because of his father who
  was hanged.</p>

  <p>"There has been some sort of trouble between Bosambo and those infernal
  Akasava," said Sanders. "It seems to have been smoothed over, but if you
  happen to be in the neighbourhood, Bones, I wish you'd have a look round. You
  can take the <i>Zaire</i>, by the way; there's an engineer coming down to
  over haul the <i>Wiggle</i>."</p>

  <p>"If there's any trouble, dear old Excellency," said Bones gravely, "you
  can be perfectly certain that old Bones will use tact. At the same time, dear
  and revered Excellency, I'd be simply fearfully glad if you'd ask Captain
  Hamilton, who is my superior officer and a good fellow, and all that sort of
  thing, to keep his naughty old fingers from pickin' an' choosin'. I make no
  accusations against anybody, dear old Excellency," Bones went on, studiously
  avoiding the stern glance of his superior officer, "but I had four jars of
  preserved ginger sent to me by a well-beloved aunt&mdash;a simply topping old
  thing who lives at Weybridge&mdash;why she lives there I've never discovered,
  except that it's quite close to Brooklands&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The only scrap of preserved ginger I've eaten was that which you offered
  to me on its arrival," said Hamilton. "I thought it was very inferior
  preserved ginger: in fact, it nearly made me sick."</p>

  <p>Bones closed his eyes and smiled. He could be very tantalizing.</p>

  <p>The next dawn the <i>Zaire</i> steamed out into the river, and Bones was
  content to leave the navigation of the river to Yoka, the engineer, for he
  was preparing a document for the press of Surrey&mdash;he even contributed
  the headlines:</p>

  <p class="headline">STRANG AFFICAN AFRICAN FETTISH<br>
  SEPTAR SCEPTER SCEAPTER OF PREHISTORIC KING FOUND<br>
  LT. TIBBETTS' VALLUABLE AND DUMFOUNDING DISCOVERRY</p>

  <p>Bones came to the edge of the Isisi country in turbulent weather. For
  three weeks there had been rain and high winds, thunderstorms by day and
  night. The river was swollen; the little Lolanga, its tributary, was now a
  foaming sea, and long before they reached the confluence Bones saw the yellow
  and the black streaking side by side, and was troubled. There were times when
  he could make no greater progress than two knots, other times when he could
  skirt the wide pools out of the current and resume normal progress.</p>

  <p>He had reached Hell's Gate and, with the aid of a powerful lamp fixed to
  the bows, made his attempt to get through. The little <i>Zaire</i> trembled
  and shook from bow to stern, her two funnels belched a fiery trail of sparks,
  for here the current was at its strongest. Soaked from head to foot in the
  rain which fell like a solid sheet, Bones stood by the steersman, his grave
  eyes fixed ahead. The <i>Zaire</i> won forward foot by foot; the waters
  piled, up against her bow until the crest was within a few inches of the
  bulwarks.</p>

  <p>Bones looked up anxiously at the banks from time to time: this was the
  season when queer things happened.</p>

  <p>Hour followed hour, and the V-shaped mouth of the gorge was within cable
  length when he heard a roar and a crack, and, looking up, he saw what he
  thought was one whole bank collapsing. It fell over with incredible slowness,
  and then, with a report like the explosion of a gun, it fell.</p>

  <p>It missed the ship by a few feet&mdash;a shower of stones rattled down on
  the deck, and a fair-sized sapling, uprooted in the landslide, fell athwart
  the deck. This probably saved the <i>Zaire</i> from destruction, for a second
  later she was lifted on the crest of a huge wave and flung against the rocky
  face of the canyon. The bushy end of the tree acted as fender&mdash;the force
  jerked the trunk up like a stick&mdash;in another moment the steamer was
  flung forward clear of the canyon.</p>

  <p>"Gracious heavens alive!" gasped Bones.</p>

  <p>He came haggardly to the beach of the Isisi city at dawn, and B'fundi,
  tile old man, brought for the admiration of Tibbetti his new bride whom men
  called The Wonderful Walker.</p>

  <p>On the edge of the Alamandi country, where live the strange tribes who pay
  no taxes and owe no allegiance to any man or system, dwelt an N'gombi
  fisherman who had seven daughters, all of whom were straight-backed and
  pretty walkers. The trained mannequins of the Paris ateliers are awkward and
  cow&mdash;like in their movements compared with a N'gombi maid, and the
  daughters of Boliki, the fisherman, were famous even amongst their own kind
  for the supple rhythm of their bodies.</p>

  <p>So that women came from their villages to visit the five huts on the banks
  of the shallow Sagar River to learn from the children of Boliki how a woman
  might walk and yet glide as though she stood firmly and it was the ground
  that moved beneath her.</p>

  <p>B'fundi of the Isisi, who was a rich old man, so near to dissolution that
  his foolishness was applauded by those who hoped to share his wealth, heard
  of the pretty walkers and came in his fine canoe to the village of Boliki,
  saw the seven daughters and married them, leaving Boliki well satisfied with
  the treasures that had been paid for the girls, and more satisfied because
  these riches gave him title to a new wife.</p>

  <p>So came B'fundi to his own village.</p>

  <p>All his sons who had worked for him and had given their best who had
  hunted in the forest and brought him the skins, who had journeyed miles
  through strange lands and brought him back rubber, who had chaffered for
  goats, and at his order had sweated against the current to buy richly
  nurtured dogs for his table, saw the walker, and neither approved nor
  disapproved of her, regarding her as a toy in the hands of death.</p>

  <p>The people of the Isisi came in from outlying towns and cities and
  villages to watch this girl glide down the broad centre street, the men
  squatting with their clenched fists to their teeth, frowning, the women agog
  that anybody could walk so beautifully.</p>

  <p>Time passed, and the wonder of the walker had melted long before Bones
  brought the <i>Zaire</i> to beach, and the women who had tried to imitate her
  had ceased from their efforts, so that when Lilaga walked along the street
  men did not so much as turn their heads, and only the chattering and
  malicious women made unprintable references to her gait.</p>

  <p>But in the house of the old man B'fundi there was great soreness of heart,
  for Lilaga the beautiful walker had charmed this old man by that devil which
  was supposed to lie behind the centre of her starry eyes. And every day she
  asked for something, and every day he gave it.</p>

  <p>Now those who had watched her arrival had seen M'turi, the hunter,
  standing on the foreshore a little aloof, leaning on his spear, a tall,
  wonderful man, whose muscles rippled under his brown satin skin with every
  movement; and they had seen Lilaga look at him, and he looked at her. And
  some said that in the dead of the night this wonderful walker glided unseen
  to the lonely hut of M'turi, which stood far aloof from the village; but
  whether the scandal was justified or not, this was known, that M'turi, who
  was a poor man, became suddenly a rich man. His pens became filled with
  edible dogs, and his goats were many; he had great sacks, of salt and brass
  bangles, and a bed of skin, and other wonders which only come to the old and
  the thrifty.</p>

  <p>One moonless night, Lilaga the walker met M'turi on the edge of the forest
  and walked before him to his hut. In her hand she had a small bag that
  jingled pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"This is the treasure which he had buried under his bed, and which he gave
  for the love of me," she said.</p>

  <p>But M'turi had other matters to talk about.</p>

  <p>"This night I heard the lokali and it said that in the narrow-narrow river
  there is no river any more, only earth and rocks, and to-morrow will come
  Tibbetti. Now, you are very clever, Lilaga, and your husband is well liked by
  Tibbetti, who will come soon with his soldiers. You shall find for me if
  Sandi has magic to clear the river. And if he has, you shall steal it for me.
  And I will be a great man amongst the Isisi and we will live in your
  husband's hut, for he will be dead, and we will divide his riches."</p>

  <p>Sanders came five days afterwards in response to the urgent pigeon post
  that Bones had sent. And with him the providential engineer who had come to
  overhaul the <i>Wiggle</i>. The Commissioner had received the message in time
  to collect stores from the ship that carried the engineer to the territories,
  and the patched-up <i>Wiggle</i> brought back tackle, stores and men, and a
  camp was made near the principal city of the Isisi, where B'fundi had built
  three great huts for his lord.</p>

  <p>He was a wise man, and very old, and his wealth was incredible. So
  powerful was he by this reason that not even the predatory kings of the Isisi
  interfered with him or sought more than their legal tribute. Moreover,
  because of his great age, he was credited with magical powers. Some said that
  he could, by a snap of his fingers, produce the most terrifying variety of
  ghosts.</p>

  <p>On the night of nights, that terrific culmination of the month of storms,
  when every hut in the city was damaged, and half of them laid low by a
  devastating wind, when the cornfields of overnight were masses of crushed
  stalks in the morning, and drowned dogs floated belly-up, B'fundi's houses
  were unharmed, and his dog pens were full of yelping beasts, and his corn
  stood high and proudly, as though they knew their master was a familiar of
  M'shimba-M'shamba, the great lord.</p>

  <p>"Magic I have, and I often speak with ghosts," he told Sanders
  complacently; "but they are of a gentle kind and do no more than stroke my
  nose and tell me I shall live longer than the world. But you certainly must
  be a great magician if you can lift that big stone where M'shimba has laid
  it."</p>

  <p>This he said, being instigated thereto by his wife.</p>

  <p>"This I will do," said Sanders easily. "Some day my great ghost will come,
  and he will bark like a gun, and all the stone will fly upwards and outwards,
  so, that if any man stand on the shore he will be killed. And then the river
  will go its own way."</p>

  <p>B'fundi heard, but did not believe.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said, "in the Akasava they say that soon there will be no law;
  for this stone has fallen by their magic, so that your little ship, and your
  soldiers, and your guns that say 'ha-ha' cannot go to them. And they will do
  what they think best and send no; tribute to you, neither rubber, nor fish,
  nor goats, nor, salt."</p>

  <p>Sanders smiled unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"So many men have talked as foolishly, B'fundi, and where are they? Their
  huts have grown into the grass, and their white bones have been washed out of
  the ground by the rains. I, also, am a wonderful walker," he added
  significantly, for he had heard of the daughter of Boliki, and perhaps of
  M'turi.</p>

  <p>He yielded to the solicitations of B'fundi and showed him certain marvels.
  He felt that Bones could have played showman better, but Bones he had sent to
  the Ochori city with the <i>Zaire</i> and all the men he could spare.</p>

  <p>"O ko!" said B'fundi, when Sanders had explained.</p>

  <p>Later he told his wife, and she carried the news to M'turi, who stole one
  night to the store hut when the Houssa recruit who was on sentry was flirting
  with a woman, and he took away with him the magic rod that frees the beds of
  rivers.</p>

  <p>Half-way back to his hut Lilaga, the wife of B'ftindi, intercepted
  him.</p>

  <p>"This night Tibbetti has sent word to Sandi, and soldiers are looking for
  you. Go quickly to the Akasava."</p>

  <p>Again the hunted M'turi took to the river. He came with his great plot and
  his magic rod to the King of Akasava, who was quaking with fear because
  Tibbetti sat on the edge of his lands, and had soldiers and guns. So to
  propitiate his master the Akasava chief seized upon M'turi and sent him to
  Bosambo.</p>

  <p>The prisoner arrived at midnight. Bosambo listened and saw, and his heart
  leapt at the sight of the Magic Rod. For on the previous night he had been
  estranged from Tibbetti.</p>

  <p>"Now praise be to God!" he said in Arabic, and, going to the <i>Zaire</i>,
  woke Bones.</p>

  <p>"Lord Tibbetti&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Go away," snarled Bones. "Oh man of lies, go away or I will whip
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Lord, I have that which I had not got," pleaded Bosambo, round the edge
  of the cabin door. "And when last night I said I had forgotten where I had
  hidden the Sceptre of the Great King, I spoke true, though you said I was an
  evil man. But in the night, Tibbetti, I had a dream..."</p>

  <p>Bones came out in his pyjamas and listened with great interest.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It had not been so terribly difficult to free Hell's Gate of
  its stony boom as Sanders had feared. Here the river is very deep&mdash;so
  deep that in places its bottom has never been fathomed. A hundred tons of
  that rested on the bank was persuaded by hydraulic jacks and other means to
  slide sideways...</p>

  <p>Sanders sent his little steamer over the place where the rock had sunk,
  and his sounding lead could find no trace of it.</p>

  <p>He went back to the residency, leaving word to Bones that he was to follow
  and bring with him one M'turi. And this Bones did. He came to head-quarters
  three days after. Sanders was at dinner when Bones stalked in and flung
  something on the table.</p>

  <p>"Sceptre, dear old officer! Search, pertinacity, dogged determination,
  Excellency. Original sceptre of Good King Wenceslas, or whatever his name
  was. One of the most fearfully important relics in the world..."</p>

  <p>He spoke with great earnestness, tapping the squat thing on the table to
  mark every sentence.</p>

  <p>"Natives don't know what it means&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bones!" Sanders' voice was very urgent. "Do you mind not tapping that
  stick of dynamite on the table?".</p>

  <p>Bones went white, and dropped the stick as though it had burnt him.
  &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Dynamite, sir?" he said faintly. "Goo' lor! I've been sleeping with it
  under my pillow."</p>

  <p>Hamilton picked up the explosive and carried it to the river. And in the
  river he dropped it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">VI. &mdash; IN THE MANNER OF LIPSTICK</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was one of those glorious days at headquarters which
  occur in the spring of the year. A fresh, cool breeze blew in from the sea,
  swaying the fronds of the palms and raising lazy swirls of dust at hut
  corners.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tibbetts stood before a small body of non commissioned officers, a
  book in his hand, his monocle screwed into his left eye. From the fact that
  he wore his Sam Browne, and that a leather-scabbarded sword hung at his left
  hip, it could be inferred that he was engaged in official duties.</p>

  <p>Sanders, standing by the rail of the residency stoep, asked a
  question.</p>

  <p>"A lecture," said Hamilton grimly. "They don't know what he's driving at,
  and I'll bet he doesn't, either. So they're all square."</p>

  <p>Bones was lecturing on the subject of field engineering.</p>

  <p>"About which there is no man who knows less," said Hamilton, with a
  certain gloomy satisfaction.</p>

  <p>He watched the party dismiss and saw Bones go off to his hut to put away
  his sword and belt. One of the lectured had to pass the residency, and him
  Hamilton beckoned.</p>

  <p>"O tell me, corporal-man," he said, "what wonder did the lord Tibbetti
  tell you?"</p>

  <p>The corporal grinned uneasily, and shuffled his bare feet in his
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said at last, "he spoke of a great canal that was dug up in
  this land, so big that ships could pass from one world to another. But this
  we knew was a jest, so we did not take notice of it."</p>

  <p>Hamilton nodded.</p>

  <p>"Also...? " he asked.</p>

  <p>The corporal's black and shiny face beamed.</p>

  <p>"Lord, he spoke of certain holes in the ground into which we Houssas could
  go so that our enemies could not shoot us. But when Sergeant Mahmet Ibn
  Hassan asked how could we dig holes in the Eburi Country, where every spade
  raises water, my lord Tibbetti said rude words to the sergeant. So that we
  knew he was jesting also."</p>

  <p>When the man had gone, Hamilton lit a cheroot.</p>

  <p>"Suez Canal! How the devil does he bring that into the ambit of military
  engineering?"</p>

  <p>Bones hove in sight at that moment. He had a book and several papers under
  his arm. His face was rather grave.</p>

  <p>"Lecture dismissed, sir."</p>

  <p>He saluted, dropped his papers and book, and spent a little time chasing
  one of the former; the sea breeze had freshened.</p>

  <p>"What has the Suez Canal got to do with it?"</p>

  <p>Bones shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Dear old officer, that, I admit, comes into the category of tactics and
  strategy. To-morrow we trot out jolly old strains and stresses."</p>

  <p>Hamilton glanced at the book. It was not, as he had expected, a
  post-correspondence volume, but one issued by the War Office.</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear old commander, I'm perfectly serious. It started when I was
  readin' about dear old Lipstic&mdash;I was sort of fired&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dear old who?" demanded Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Lipstic, Excellency an' sir. The jolly old boy who built the Suez
  Canal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lesseps," snarled Hamilton. "Gosh! Why can't you get a name right?"</p>

  <p>"Names are nothing, dear old Ham," chided Bones gently. "Good old
  Lipstic's name lives in his jolly old canal. Circums docet, dear old boy:
  'Look around this canal and that's my memorial,' dear old Ham."</p>

  <p>Later that day came a deputation from the Akasava folk, who live to the
  westward of the Eburi, and they came with a grievance. Their spokesman a
  tousled old man, spoke boldly and despairingly by turns. His name was K'saga,
  he was a notorious thief and ruled a village of outcasts. There were a score
  of these communities up and down the river, peopled by men and women who had
  fled from the justice of their outraged fellows.</p>

  <p>K'saga had to tell a tale of stolen goats and stolen women&mdash;but the
  goats were rather important. And the culprit were, of course, the Eburi.</p>

  <p>When he had finished, Sanders spoke.</p>

  <p>"O K'saga, I do not know which is worse, the Eburi people, or you and your
  village. Now I tell you again to gather your people and I will take them to a
  cleaner land where none can rob them, and I will pass my hand over them and
  wipe clean their evil deeds, so that no man who has lost a wife, and none who
  desires to avenge a brother, shall do harm to you."</p>

  <p>But K'saga rejected the suggestion. He himself had the blood of two
  cousins on his hands and preferred the miserable village over which he lorded
  to the finest city where he would sleep badly and start at every sound.</p>

  <p>"Lord, these Eburi people are devils now, saying evil things about your
  lordship. What will it be when their old chief dies, and a woman rules
  them?"</p>

  <p>"That is with me," said Sanders briefly, and dismissed the palaver with
  promises of investigation.</p>

  <p>Though he was not aware of the fact, the old chief of the Eburi was
  already with his fathers, and a woman sat on the stool of kingship. Sanders
  learnt this fact on his way up river.</p>

  <p>There was no part of his territories that he approached with greater
  circumspection than the Eburi. Up and down the river they were called by
  various names. To the rest of the Akasava folk they were "The Unreachables,"
  to the N'gombi, "the proud-faced," which may be translated as insolent. They
  paid taxation as and when they wished, they came and stayed away from tribal
  palavers at their own sweet will. They raided and stole, moving across their
  marshes with an ease which led to the legend (still persisting in certain
  works of ethnology) that they were web-footed.</p>

  <p>How much of K'saga story was true he must discover for himself. Rumours
  had come to him that the outcasts were "chopping" women&mdash;cannibalism was
  the most difficult of all crimes to suppress. And complaints that women had
  been stolen might well mean that K'saga and his hideous cabal were preparing
  alibis in advance.</p>

  <p>Here he was not far wrong, for the new queen of the Eburi was too
  interested in her position to bother about her miserable neighbour.</p>

  <p>When the woman I'safi-M'lo'bini knew that she was to be chief of the
  Eburi, she celebrated the unique occasion by adopting the Christian religion,
  and was received into the Roman Church by a sceptical priest, who gave her
  the name of Theresa. He was sceptical because he knew his Theresa rather
  well, and that his doubts were justified was proved when, following her
  conversion, she held a great dance in honour of the moon, and caused her late
  father's seven wives to be whipped.</p>

  <p>Father Martin, a bearded man who wore the habit of a Franciscan and a
  solar topee, came aboard the <i>Zaire</i> to take tea with the Commissioner.
  Over a pipe he expressed his opinions&mdash;which were mainly uncomplimentary
  to Theresa.</p>

  <p>"I could have wished that the Baptists had her," he said gloomily; "she's
  missionary trained, speaks English&mdash;which is a diabolical accomplishment
  in a native&mdash;she can even play the harmonium. But she's mischief from
  the top of her woolly head to the soles of her big feet. When I found her
  using a picture of Our Lady to cure one of her dancing boys of belly ache, I
  nearly took a stick to her!"</p>

  <p>Sanders was mildly amused. How Theresa came to be the one woman chief in
  his territory is simply explained. The Eburi folk were rabidly strong for
  tradition. Failing the succession of the eldest son, for the chieftainship
  was in every sense dynastic, the seventh daughter of the seventh son was
  invariably elected. For a hundred and five years the eldest sons had followed
  one another in succession. Theresa was the first woman chief that the Eburi
  had had since the year 1817.</p>

  <p>"She'll settle down," he said, but as an act of precaution sent for the
  new chief.</p>

  <p>Between the Eburi and the river is a march of twenty-seven miles, mostly
  through swamp, and it was not a journey lightly to be undertaken. He waited a
  week and then the answer came from the mouth of her councillor.</p>

  <p>"Lord, the woman our chief is sick and cannot come," he said.</p>

  <p>Sanders read defiance in the message, but he was patient. Theresa must
  reveal herself before he took stronger action. And he was particularly
  anxious to avoid trouble.</p>

  <p>From the river the ground rises gradually until in the Eburi the woods
  stand nearly five hundred feet above the river level. In the circumstances it
  was surprising that the twenty-mile belt of marsh existed, but a rough survey
  revealed the cause. There was a sloping stratum of clay beneath the soggy
  ground; evidence of this was supplied by the high clay cliffs that overshadow
  the river near Chumbiri; and it was under these cliffs that Sanders had
  anchored the <i>Zaire</i> whilst he waited for the answer to his summons.</p>

  <p>The marsh had a military value: it was wholly impossible to approach the
  Eburi on its most accessible side, and it had no other. For to left and right
  of the "corridor" which led into the interior were the frontiers of the
  French possessions. In shape the Eburi land may be likened to a squat,
  wide-necked flask&mdash;the very word Eburi means "gourd." Near where the
  corridor approached the river was a saucer-shaped depression of land in which
  dwelt K'saga and his people, and him Sanders visited.</p>

  <p>Once before he had had occasion to take an armed force into the country,
  and he never forgot the nightmare month he spent mostly ankle deep in water.
  Here dwelt water snakes and huge leeches, and a family of crocodiles, the
  founders of which at some remote period must have travelled overland to this
  swampy paradise. There were certain paths, more or less intermittent, that
  connected the area with the outer world, but only at certain seasons of the
  year were they practicable. The officer commanding troops, who made a visit
  of inspection, expressed the opinion that the country was almost
  impregnable.</p>

  <p>It was a dirty village, clumsily and lazily built. No two huts were in
  line; the gardens where corn grew straggled into the unreclaimed waste. Men
  vanished at the sight of the dapper, white-clad figure, and even K'saga
  seemed to have an accusing conscience, for he was trembling when Sanders
  approached him.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner made a tour of the village, looking for certain signs of
  guilt&mdash;incidentally choosing a tree on which he would hang K'saga if he
  found evidence of cannibalism. There was no proof, how ever. He went back to
  his ship and arrived in time to receive Theresa's second message.</p>

  <p>It was decidedly insolent, and embodied a demand for "a great present." It
  was the first direct act of defiance which the Eburi people had delivered for
  close on twenty years. Sanders was not angry.</p>

  <p>"Go back to the woman," he said, "and say that Sandi sends her this
  beautiful present, that she may see every day the face of one who will answer
  for all that happens in this land."</p>

  <p>He handed the messenger a gaudily, framed mirror, and went down the river,
  a very thoughtful man.</p>

  <p>He had hardly arrived at headquarters when he summoned what was
  practically a council of war.</p>

  <p>"This woman is going to give trouble&mdash;I've had information that she
  intends to re-establish the old sacrifices. That I will not stomach even if
  it costs me an expeditionary force. The only chance is that I can overawe
  her, and I purpose sending Bones in the <i>Wiggle</i> with twenty men and a
  couple of machine-guns to establish a post on the edge of the marsh. There is
  a good camping ground near the clay bluff&mdash;also you can keep your eye on
  K'saga, who, I am certain, is chopping women. I've half a mind to send to
  headquarters for an engineer to make a survey of that section&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dear old Excellency," murmured Bones, hurt, "headquarters... jolly old
  engineer... really... really!"</p>

  <p>He rolled his head, a picture of injured pride.</p>

  <p>"Leave it to Bones," said Hamilton. "He'll cut a Suez Canal through to
  Tanganyika before you can say 'knife'."</p>

  <p>"Dear old Ham," said Bones testily, "why jest, dear old boy? I don't
  profess to be a Lipstic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lesseps," wailed Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"I don't even profess to be dear old thingamejig who built the Pyramids;
  but a simple, surveying job..."</p>

  <p>He was amused at the fatuity of asking for outside help.</p>

  <p>"You might try to establish contact with Theresa, and if you can, take a
  couple of men to the village. From what I've heard, she's as ugly as sin and
  as vain as the devil."</p>

  <p>"A typical woman," murmured Bones, and Hamilton restrained himself with
  great difficulty; "Naughty, naughty! Put down the salt-cellar, dear old Ham,"
  said Bones reproachfully. "Jolly Excellency and I understand each other
  quite. What you wish me to do, dear sir and administrator, is to say a few
  words to this uppish young damsel. I'll talk to her like a father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She'll probably talk to you like a wife," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>He spoke with the voice of prophecy. A day or two afterwards came a canoe,
  paddled by Eburi warriors, and with them came the courier of Theresa. He made
  a long speech about nothing, a longer speech about the looking-glass, and
  wound up: "... lord, the chief of our people is a very wise woman, and she
  knows all things. Now you have two sons, and one of these she will
  marry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sanders was on his feet; the courier cowed under the blazing blue of his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Go back to the chief of the Eburi and say I have nothing here that she
  may wed, only a rope that has hanged many chiefs, but has never hanged a
  woman. Also, I have many soldiers with guns which say 'ha ha,' and sharp
  steel knives; and if I come to her I will make an end of her and her people.
  The palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>The courier had the appearance of one who was rather glad to make his
  escape.</p>

  <p>Bones went away in the <i>Wiggle</i> with what, dignity he could summon;
  for Hamilton had brought a gramophone down to the quay, and as the
  <i>Wiggle</i> started up river the strains of the "Wedding March" came
  scrappily to his attentive ears. There was nothing but silence left for
  him&mdash;after all, he had grown hoarse from roaring "cad!" through a
  megaphone; moreover, it had had very little effect upon his skittish
  superior.</p>

  <p>Bones came to the clay bluff, marked out his camp, and sent a peremptory
  order to K'saga to come and bring with him every able-bodied man of his
  village. About a hundred responded, old and young, and with the help of these
  he placed the little camp in a condition of defence; made a rough sort of
  harbour for the protection of the motor-launch, and mounted his machine-guns
  at strategical points, covering the hard road which presently lost itself in
  the marshes.</p>

  <p>K'saga's men grumbled and worked. At the end of the first day Bones
  counted heads and found that at least half of the men had sneaked back to
  their village. He took six Houssas into K'saga's stronghold, hauled out the
  two headmen responsible for the recruiting of labour, and flogged them. The
  next morning the full complement came and stayed till the end of the day.</p>

  <p>He had been four or five days established when K'saga came to him with a
  story of a woman who had been stolen by the Eburi while she was in the forest
  gathering wood. Bones listened to the circumstantial story without
  interruption. When K'saga had finished: "Find this woman and bring her to my
  camp&mdash;and she shall be alive, K'saga, or you will be dead at the
  breaking of the day."</p>

  <p>At midnight they came to him, bringing the woman with them, alive and
  well; a terrified creature, too frightened to answer questions. Bones
  beckoned the chief aside.</p>

  <p>"Take her back to your village, and if she disappears, you also
  disappear," he said.</p>

  <p>Evidently the appearance of an armed force on the edge of the marsh had
  impressed the new chieftain of the Eburi. She sent a messenger to guide Bones
  to her village, but added a significant rider: "Because it is a great danger,
  the woman says bring no soldiers, lest they be lost in the marshes."</p>

  <p>But Bones bargained for two, and apparently this compromise had been
  already arranged.</p>

  <p>He left at dawn, camped in the forest, sleeping in the fork of a tree, and
  came to the village in the middle of a scorching day, when men found it hard
  to work, though the women were lively enough, for they were preparing food
  for the great festival of M'shimba M'shamba.</p>

  <p>Now, in the bad old days before the law came to the river, the feast of
  M'shimba-M'shamba was not a nice observance. There were human sacrifices, and
  the three poles slung in the middle of the village street in triangular form
  looked rather ominous to Mr. Tibbetts, who had seen several similar tokens of
  sacrifice.</p>

  <p>The attitude of the people was not unfriendly, but rather familiar. They
  had been so long dissociated from symbols of authority that they were more in
  awe of the two Houssas, with their loaded rifles and fixed bayonets, than
  they were of Bones.</p>

  <p>There came a councillor to him, a tall stripling, newly recruited from
  Theresa's dancing boys.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, O man, why are these sticks of wood put here?"</p>

  <p>The "councillor" answered, without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"In a day and a day the rime of the moon will come, and we do magic to
  M'shimba-M'shamba, as our fathers did."</p>

  <p>"As your fathers did," repeated Bones gently. "O man, that is a strange
  saying; for your fathers did evil things: they chopped young girls, tied them
  to the stake and watched them burn."</p>

  <p>The councillor showed his first sign of uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"We of the Eburi are a great people," he began oratorically, "and what we
  do is right, for none can come up against us because of the water
  land&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bones opened his mouth wide and scratched his nose, and when he did that
  he was thinking very quickly.</p>

  <p>"What are you, man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am a councillor," said the youth proudly; "also I am one of the chief
  woman's many husbands."</p>

  <p>It was towards sunset when he was granted his interview. He found the
  queen sitting on her stool, and, grouped in a half-circle about her, some
  twenty young men, each with coloured feathers in his hair. Theresa was rather
  above middle height. Her face was disfigured with the marks which smallpox
  leave; she was very skinny and scantily attired. She pointed to the space
  before her.</p>

  <p>"Sit, white man," she said.</p>

  <p>Bones stood, towering over her.</p>

  <p>"I see you, I'safi-M'lo'bini," he said, and was shocked when she answered
  in English.</p>

  <p>They brought a stool for Bones, and on this he condescended to sit,
  immediately opposite her&mdash;not a favourable position for one who was
  rather requiring in the matter of duty.</p>

  <p>"Now, Tibbetti, you shall tell me stories of wonderful things," she
  said.</p>

  <p>Bones had himself to blame that he had acquired up and down the river the
  reputation of official story-teller. He had wonderful powers of invention,
  and had the gift of utilizing the limited vocabulary of the Bomongo tongue to
  its fullest advantage.</p>

  <p>"I'safi," he said, "I will tell you these stories; but first you shall
  tell me why these sticks stand before your hut." He pointed to the
  sacrificial poles.</p>

  <p>Evidently she had the explanation prepared, for she talked glibly enough,
  and there was no word of sacrifice.</p>

  <p>"That is a good story," said Bones politely, when she had finished. "Now
  you shall tell me, woman, chief, who are the three girls who are kept in
  little cages on the outskirts of your village?"</p>

  <p>Here was a calamitous question. Theresa crossed herself ludicrously, and
  for a moment forgot her advantage, and was almost humble.</p>

  <p>"They will be released," said Bones sternly, "and there will be no killing
  palaver."</p>

  <p>It took the greater part of twenty minutes to free the captives, and by
  that time she had recovered some of her equanimity. Realizing that his grip
  of the situation was slipping away, Bones began his story. He could adopt the
  deep, sonorous tones of the Akasava people, and he told of M'shimba-M'shamba
  and the fiery lizard whose glance is death, and of the little ghosts who live
  in the forest, and the devils that come up out of the river and eat dogs; and
  as he narrated, he saw his breathless audience growing larger and larger with
  every minute, until he sat in a circle of staring eyes. He allowed his fancy
  to embroider and invent, and on the spot he created M'pita, the snake god,
  who lives underground and harms none.</p>

  <p>"His skin is white, his eyes are red. Let any man or woman look upon those
  eyes, and if he is ugly he becomes beautiful; if he is small he grows to be a
  giant. If it is a woman, then she is so lovely that all the world kneels to
  her."</p>

  <p>It is possible that Bones was instigated by the too obvious plainness of
  his hostess. It is certain that she listened with growing eagerness, her
  unshapely mouth opening wider and wider.</p>

  <p>"Where is this wonderful ju-ju, Tibbetti?" she asked huskily.</p>

  <p>Bones waved his hand airily towards the distant river.</p>

  <p>"And have you looked upon him, Tibbetti?"</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of Bones' tongue to say that he had a daily conference
  with M'pita, but remembering the consequence, he modestly confessed he had
  not.</p>

  <p>"But I have seen his trail, like the sheen of gold. Some day I will dig a
  deep hole and find it for you&mdash;if you will obey the laws your father
  Sandi desires." Bones went back to his camp next morning, well satisfied with
  himself, and wrote a long and incoherent letter to Sanders. His position was
  not entirely free from danger. Natives have short memories, and the magic of
  M'pita might too soon dissolve.</p>

  <p>A story came down that the M'shimba sacrifice had been made. The father of
  the dead girl escaped across the marsh to tell the story. Bones flew a pigeon
  to headquarters, and he was waiting for the reply, pacing up and down in the
  wood, watching with a malignant eye the quaking marsh which separated Theresa
  from retribution, when there came to him the most brilliant idea of his
  career.</p>

  <p>His lokali sent a message to the Eburi. The next morning came Theresa's
  messenger.</p>

  <p>"Go to your mistress and tell her that I have found M'pita. Let her send
  me all the young men of her village, that I may show them where to dig."</p>

  <p>That afternoon was one of feverish activity for Bones. He summoned K'saga
  and his workmen, and made a rough calculation.</p>

  <p>"Dig me a deep hole there," he said, and reluctantly they obeyed.</p>

  <p>The next morning brought eager recruits to the work. By nightfall a deep
  channel had been cut through heavy clay, and on the following morning Theresa
  herself came to watch operations.</p>

  <p>"We shall find the snake. I am following his trail," said Bones
  solemnly.</p>

  <p>Working frantically, the men of the Eburi enlarged and extended what was
  by now something that resembled a railway cutting. They slipped and slithered
  through the wet clay; they cut down trees that impeded their progress; turned
  the channel to avoid the rocks; but never once did they see M'pita the snake,
  whose look brings beauty.</p>

  <p>It was towards the close of that day that the watching Theresa made a
  discovery.</p>

  <p>"O Tibbetti, you are making a new river!" Already the men in the cutting
  were working knee-deep in water. Bones leaned wearily against a clay bank and
  grinned feebly. He was on the point of collapse. All day he had been flying
  hither and thither with the restless energy of an ant. He had marked the
  progress of M'pita with sticks driven into the ground; he had produced from
  the <i>Wiggle</i> a theodolite, the functions of which he imperfectly
  understood, and he had abandoned this for a more rough and ready method.</p>

  <p>"He carries a little red book which is full of magic," one of the youthful
  councillors reported.</p>

  <p>By sunset the waters from the marsh had piled waist-high at the head of
  the butting. With the aid of fires the work went on through the night.</p>

  <p>K'saga took counsel with a familiar;</p>

  <p>"It is dark, and Tibbetti cannot see. Let all our people steal away to the
  village and sleep."</p>

  <p>Bones did not notice the disappearance of the outcasts until he looked
  around for one of K'saga's men, certain doubts having arisen in his mind.</p>

  <p>Two hours before dawn he blew up the last obstacle that separated his new
  river from the lower ground...</p>

  <p>Theresa came to him in the early light of day, and there was consternation
  in her face.</p>

  <p>"Lord, my young men say that the water is running from my beautiful
  water-land, and that soon one will walk dryly where the terrible mud would
  have swallowed them. And all this has happened because they dug up the earth
  seeking M'pita, the white snake."</p>

  <p>Bones had his escort ready&mdash;sixteen men with loaded rifles, and two
  at each machine-gun.</p>

  <p>"Go back to your village, woman," he said. "Soon Sandi will come, walking
  freely where the waters were, and he will bring judgment."</p>

  <p>He wrote a letter to headquarters and sent it by a fast canoe.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Sir and Exelency Exerlency</span>,<br>
  Vini Veritas Vide Vice! I have have found it! The serlution of mitilery
  militery dificulties in re Eburi. I have draned the bason! I have draind the
  basun! Vini vici etc. The whole of the marsh as per sch-sced-schudle in
  margin is slowly drayning itself to pieces! By cuting cutting a X section
  through the clay and carefuly studing the contoors contuours different
  heights of the land I succeded in finding an outlet for the waters. Pro boni
  publici!</p><br>

  <p>"Why this strange rush of Latin?" asked Sanders.</p>

  <p>There could be only one explanation.</p>

  <p>"Bones is under the impression that Lipstick was a Roman."</p>

  <p>Sanders was studying a big-scale map of the Eburi.</p>

  <p>"A great idea of Bones'&mdash;a marvellous idea. I wonder where the
  dickens he got his labour?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton was looking over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Where the dickens does the water find its out let?" he asked. "It
  couldn't run into the river direct."</p>

  <p>K'saga could have supplied an answer were he alive, for where his
  unsavoury village had been there had appeared a new lake, beneath whose
  placid surface was hidden much that were better hidden. And in this lake the
  crocodiles and water snakes that the draining marsh had left homeless were
  finding new lairs.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">VII. &mdash; THE SPLENDID THINGS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "Bones Falls in Love"<br>
  in <i>The Grand Magazine</i>, Vol. 49, Mar-Aug 1926</h3>

  <p class="first">THE two Splendid Things which the people of the Inner
  N'gombi prized above all other communal possessions were kept in a secret
  place under a great stone in the bed of a river. Not a great river, because
  the N'gombi folk have an antipathy to water that runs in any volume.</p>

  <p>Literally they were called the very-great-and-beautiful but only certain
  initiated witch doctors and wise men who dabbled in magic gave them their
  full title. For the common people they were K'sara-K'sura, "The Splendid
  Things." And after they had been dug up and nastily employed (as they were at
  times without the knowledge or approval of Mr. Commissioner Sanders) they
  were wiped clean and polished and laid in an oblong mould of clay into which
  the juices of a certain tree had been poured. More liquid was poured upon
  them until they disappeared in the heart of a great block of red rubber. Then
  they would be replaced and hidden in the river until they were again brought
  forth.</p>

  <p>The Anthropological Commission which the United States Government sent to
  Africa came in course of time to the River Territory. It consisted of three
  wise men of middle age and genial disposition. They were, in truth, never
  wholly deserving of the curses which were poured forth upon their unoffending
  heads, not only by Mr. Sanders, but by the Administrator, the Colonial
  Secretary in London and his colleagues of the Cabinet.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the wrath and indignation of certain American
  newspapers and that section of the scientific American public interested in
  anthropology, was wholly misdirected and unjust. For Sanders and the British
  Government were alike innocent of any intention to deceive the great
  scientists of the United States or to withhold from them information to which
  they were entitled.</p>

  <p>As to Lieutenant Tibbetts of the King's Houssa the last thing in the world
  he desired was the publicity that came his way. The night the Commission came
  down river in the <i>Zaire</i> with a miscellaneous collection of spears,
  arrows, native manufactures, and volumes of data ranging from tribal face
  marks to cranial measurements, Sanders entertained the scientists to dinner.
  And it was quite a cheery function, for these men of science were very human,
  had a fund of good stories, and one at least was a passable tenor.</p>

  <p>When the hilarity had died down...</p>

  <p>"Bones, of course, was invaluable," said Dr. Wade, the leader of the
  American expedition. "His facts were a little distorted but his imagination
  was amazing!"</p>

  <p>"Be just, dear old transatlantic cousin!" protested Bones. "Be fair, dear
  old George Washington! Who showed you the village of the bald men? Who showed
  you the identical spot where the jolly old green crocodile lays his naughty
  old eggs? Who, at the risk of his jolly old life, led you into the bushman's
  dark and sinister lair, where the foot of white man, dear old professor,
  never, or seldom, trod?"</p>

  <p>"You did "&mdash;Dr. Wade puffed at his pipe&mdash;"through the vilest
  forest path we have ever struck. We were two days and nights on the journey.
  We could have made it on the <i>Zaire</i> in six hours&mdash;and in
  comfort."</p>

  <p>Bones was unabashed.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't have had the experience, dear old anthro&mdash;whatever the
  word is," he said calmly.</p>

  <p>"And as to the green crocodile&mdash;there is no green crocodile," Wade
  went on remorselessly, his eyes twinkling behind thick lenses, "and we spent
  three days looking for the fool thing!"</p>

  <p>"Sir and brother scientist." said Bones solemnly, "I've seen it with my
  jolly old peepers."</p>

  <p>Captain Hamilton of the Houssas snorted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you did! A year ago the river people captured an unfortunate croc
  and painted him green for your benefit."</p>

  <p>Bones shrugged his shoulders rapidly. "He gave us one bit of information
  which unfortunately came to nothing," said Dr. Wade. "Or shall I say that we
  could not induce the people of the Inner N'gombi to oblige us."</p>

  <p>"What was that?" asked Sanders curiously.</p>

  <p>"We tried to get a specimen of the Splendid Things."</p>

  <p>Bones closed his eyes patiently.</p>

  <p>"If you'd only left it to me, dear old Uncle Sam," he murmured. "Tact,
  dear old sir&mdash;finesse, jolly old investigator&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The truth is, I suppose, that that was another of Bones' dreams?"
  suggested the burly Mr. Halliman Steel, second in command of the
  expedition.</p>

  <p>Sanders shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Bones triumphantly. "My jolly old honour an' veracity is
  vindicated. Sir an' Excellency, I thank you."</p>

  <p>He jerked out a bony hand to Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Bones was right." Sanders touched the extended fist with his finger-tips
  in the manner of the Ochori. "I myself have never seen the Splendid Things,
  though I have searched for them&mdash;naturally. One doesn't allow a couple
  of' business-like execution knives to be floating round without making an
  attempt to find them. I more than suspect that the Inner N'gombi people use
  them at rare intervals to slice off the heads of objectionable people, but
  I've never caught them at it. Some day I will have a bit of luck. I promise
  you that if ever a specimen falls into my hands&mdash;and they are, I
  believe, unique&mdash;I will send it along to you."</p>

  <p>The expedition left next day and Bones accompanied the party to
  Administrative Headquarters.</p>

  <p>Now, as everybody knows, His Excellency Sir Macalister Campbell had a
  daughter more beautiful than any Administrator's daughter had ever been
  within living memory. Her name was Doran, and Bones was her slave.</p>

  <p>When he had handed over his charges to the proper officials he went in
  search of the divinity and met her coming back from tennis.</p>

  <p>"It is quite unnecessary to run and wholly undignified to whoop when you
  see me," she said severely.</p>

  <p>"You must remember, Bones, that I am not a child any longer."</p>

  <p>She was in the region of eighteen. They had not met for six months, and
  six months is an awful long time when you are eighteen.</p>

  <p>"Dear old Miss Doran... simply wonderful... bless your jolly old eyes..."
  Bones was a little incoherent&mdash;most elaborately relieved her of her
  racket and shoes, all of which he dropped from time to time between the place
  of meeting and her destination. She had been to England; was (she told him
  this in their first few minutes of their reunion) half-engaged to a handsome
  man of great fortune. She was not a child any longer (she told the miserable
  young man this three times) but she was awfully glad to see her old friends
  again.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have quite forgotten me&mdash;such is the loyalty of one's
  friends!"</p>

  <p>Bones dropped racket and shoes to hammer home his passionate argument.</p>

  <p>"Dear old Doran, have a heart&mdash;you go home an' get half engaged to a
  jolly old he-vamp an' talk to poor old Bones about loyalty. An' here was I
  thinkin' about you, dear old Doran, in the jolly old lonely watches of the
  night, dear old miss! 'What's she doin' now?' an' all that sort of
  stuff&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't bully me, Bones&mdash;I am a woman, I am no longer a child," said
  Doran.</p>

  <p>"Compared with me," said Bones fiercely, "you're a jolly old
  squeaker!"</p>

  <p>"I think you have gone far enough." Doran's voice was like the tinkle of
  ice against steel.</p>

  <p>She was more gracious at dinner. Whilst Sir Macalister was initiating the
  American commission into the mystery of bagpipes, Bones led her out on to the
  cool, dark stoep, but the speech he had rehearsed, and which was to reveal
  his deep contrition and proper humility, was never delivered in its
  entirety.</p>

  <p>"Dear old Miss Doran," he began, "I am but a rough but jolly old soldier,
  rude of speech&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Very rude," she said. "You must remember, Bones&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know you're not, young miss. As I was sayin'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What are the Splendid Things?" she asked. "Or was it one of your
  tarradiddles?"</p>

  <p>Bones choked in his righteous indignation.</p>

  <p>"Tarradiddles, young Miss Excellency? Bless my jolly old soul! Could old
  Bones lie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, all too promptly. "But honestly, Bones, are these awful
  things in existence?"</p>

  <p>"They are." said Bones.</p>

  <p>"Then get one for me," she said calmly.</p>

  <p>The request momentarily deprived him of speech.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing in the world&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"You told that nice American man at dinner that if he had left it to you,
  the knives would have been in his kitbag&mdash;those were your very
  words."</p>

  <p>"What I meant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get one for me." Her lips curled. "It was a tarradiddle."</p>

  <p>Bones rose from the wicker chair. He was very stiff and regimental.</p>

  <p>"The knife or knives will be in your hands or hand on or before the
  fourteenth ult.," he said sternly. "It may mean, dear old Miss Hard-heart,
  that poor old Bones will not be alive to deliver same as per your jolly old
  orders; it may be that in some lonely, as it were, fever-ridden an' simply
  fearful land, his mangled old body&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Send them by post," said Doran; "and register them."</p>

  <p>Bones bowed slightly.</p>

  <p>"Wrapped in white paper or blue, young miss?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Bones. You seem to forget that I am no longer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bones laughed harshly and insultingly.</p>

  <p>He had been back at Sanders' headquarters a week before his opportunity
  came.</p>

  <p>B'firi, a little chief of the Inner N'gombi, had some trouble with his
  third and youngest wife. She had reached the summit of ambition in that four
  men loved her, for she was, by the standards of the forest, very beautiful.
  Now such a palaver is a great jest amongst hunters when they meet over their
  cooking pots in the deeps of the N'gombi forest, and it is food for mirth
  amongst all women where they meet; but the wife of B'firi loved best an
  Akasava fisherman who dwelt in solitude on the banks of the river. M'Lini
  (this was the name of the beautiful wife) fell into error, For the Akasava
  are fish-eaters. And fish-eaters are abominable people.</p>

  <p>M'Lini was haled before the council of the village, and certain prying men
  and women gave evidence, with minute details of all they had seen or heard.
  The palaver lasted through the night, and the stranger who presided, and who,
  despite the camwood that disguised his face, everybody knew to be B'mingo
  B'guri, the paramount chief of the Inner N'gombi, ordered her for
  judgment.</p>

  <p>In the deeps of the forest, the keeper of the Splendid Things brought his
  treasures; the rubber was hacked away from them...</p>

  <p>Thereafter M'Lini was not. Nor the lonely Akasava fisherman. These two
  they buried feet to feet, and the knives were cleaned and polished, soaked
  again in liquid rubber and hidden in their secret place.</p>

  <p>Sanders had the vaguest news of the happening, the merest hint of a hint,
  the rumour of a rumour; but it was enough to send Bones and ten Houssas on a
  tour of investigation, and Bones accepted the opportunity as an especial act
  of Providence arranged for his sole benefit.</p>

  <p>"The knives haven't been out for eight years," said Sanders at parting.
  "Find them and bring them down. If B'firi is implicated in the business
  beyond a doubt&mdash;hang him. But get the knives. I should like to send one
  to those Americans."</p>

  <p>Bones had a use for the other.</p>

  <p>For three weeks he trudged to and fro in the Inner N'gombi forest. He held
  palavers, he examined chiefs and petty chiefs, he inspected the lonely
  fisherman's hut, and probed and dug in likely spots for evidence of the
  crime.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is true that my woman has left me," said B'firi. "She left one
  dark night when the river was so and the moon was so, with an evil man of the
  Akasava, an eater of fish, who has his hut in such a place..."</p>

  <p>Now it is true that even in the N'gombi forest, women run away from their
  husbands, and here they bear a curious resemblance to their European sisters;
  they choose as companions in their adventures the most unlikeable people. For
  who can gauge the curious workings of a woman's mind, whether she be white or
  brown, fine lady of Mayfair or half-naked wife to a little chief?</p>

  <p>There were three brothers of the Akasava who loved one another. In their
  youth they joined hands together and swore by salt and goats and women that
  they would bear each other's afflictions, and make wrong done to one the hurt
  of all three. And though they separated and each became a lonely fisherman
  their oath held.</p>

  <p>It was one of these men who died for his fancy, and even whilst Bones was
  toiling and moiling in a forest that was as hot as the average Turkish bath,
  one of the brethren took his canoe and searched out his fellow.</p>

  <p>"N'kema is dead," he said. "Because he took the woman of B'firi of the
  N'gombi, these men have taken out their secret knives and chopped him."</p>

  <p>"That is bad palaver," said M'laka, who was the elder brother; "for it
  seems that these secret knives have a great magic, and up and down the river
  they say that the man who slays with the Splendid Things may only die from
  its edge. Let us go into the N'gombi forest and ask questions of the
  people."</p>

  <p>"They may chop us," said the younger brother, but M'laka nodded
  &mdash;thus do the Akasava express dissent.</p>

  <p>"Tibbetti is in the forest, seeking the knives, and they will not hurt us
  because they are afraid."</p>

  <p>So the two men polished their spears with river sand, and made their edges
  very sharp by rubbing them one against the other, and when these things were
  done they went down-stream in one canoe, landed at the edge of the N'gombi
  forest, and began their investigations. Once they were in the village where
  Bones was conducting his own enquiries, but he never knew this.</p>

  <p>A week after he had gone, M'laka made a discovery. "The Keeper of the
  Splendid Things is B'firi himself," he said gravely.</p>

  <p>They were sitting over a small fire, roasting a monkey, when the
  revelation was made.</p>

  <p>"It was this B'firi," he went on, "who struck off our brother's head. Now
  it seems to me that B'firi will talk to us and tell us his mystery. He goes
  often to the forest to hunt monkeys and often he goes alone. He is quick with
  the spear, but are we not wonderful stabbers of fish? We will make a fish of
  him, but he must not die until he speaks."</p>

  <p>For a week they haunted the outskirts of B'firi's village, living in holes
  in the ground so that none could see them, and on the eighth day came B'firi
  alone, and him they trailed for a mile till, as he stooped to pull an arrow
  from a wriggling monkey, they leapt at him. Swift to turn and swift to
  strike, B'firi fought back. His killing spear sent the younger brother to the
  ground, but M'laka caught and choked him into insensibility.</p>

  <p>"I am dead," said the younger brother, and anticipated the truth by a
  quarter of an hour.</p>

  <p>With a rope in his mouth and his hands tied, B'firi watched the burying.
  Not a word said M'laka until he had brought his captive to the edge of the
  river.</p>

  <p>"I cannot kill you because of your magic." he said.</p>

  <p>"That is true," answered B'firi, "for only the Splendid Things can make a
  ghost of me, and if you try to spear me, you will be turned into a fish."</p>

  <p>"That I know," said M'laka. "Now you shall tell me where you hide your
  bright knives."</p>

  <p>B'firi showed his teeth at this.</p>

  <p>He showed more of them later when M'laka made a hot fire and burnt his
  feet a little.</p>

  <p>"They are beneath a stone near the Three Teeth of M'Shimba-M'Shamba," he
  groaned.</p>

  <p>M'laka went alone, since his enemy was in no state for walking, and near
  the three grey trees which the lightning had withered, he found the stone in
  the shallow of the river and brought back the knives in their resilient
  packing.</p>

  <p>"If you kill me, Sandi will hang you on a high tree," said B'firi, "but if
  you take the knives to him he will give you a great reward."</p>

  <p>"If I hang, you die, and what greater reward can Sandi give me than my
  life?" demanded M'laka, and struck.</p>

  <p>Bones came down to Headquarters, baffled but not entirely hopeless. His
  report quite satisfied the Commissioner. He had not expected that the matter
  would be cleared up so easily. But would it satisfy Miss Doran Campbell?
  Bones found a letter waiting from her, and read it with many tut-tuts and
  sundry clucking noises of irritation.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="SMCAP">Dere Bones</span> [Doran and Lieutenant
  Tibbetts had this much in common, that neither could spell], Have you
  forgoten your promus? Is it a case of out of site out of mined? I have not
  forgoten. Remember I am a child no longer! A promus is a promas. I have
  prackterly promissed the knifes to a friend of mine in Scotland. Do not
  dissipoint me, Bones.</p><br>

  <p>Bones sighed heavily and cursed the loquacity of Dr. Wade. He had begun a
  letter, which was at once tactful and cunning, when there blew into the
  Territory <i>H.M.S. Tiny</i>. <i>H.M.S. Tiny</i> is an ugly ship, smaller
  than the average pleasure steamer, and that it should be in salt water at all
  was something of a novelty, for <i>Tiny</i>'s duty was to patrol certain
  small rivers in another British possession, and to check the nefarious
  traffic in synthetic rum, which certain evil-minded traders pursued contrary
  to the law. She was in fact on her way, in response to the frenzied demands
  of an official a thousand miles along the coast line, when something went
  wrong with her boilers and she wallowed into the river for repairs.</p>

  <p>Her ship's company was mainly made up of Kroo boys, but there were five
  white officers, and for a week Headquarters was a place of unusual hilarity.
  The day before she sailed, Bones went on board to tiffin, and was shown round
  the ship.</p>

  <p>"There isn't another boat like this in the world," said Widgeon, her
  captain, who had a pride that was almost pathetic.</p>

  <p>"Dear old naval officer, why should there be?" asked Bones, and advanced
  the novel theory that the <i>Tiny</i> had once been a barnacle on a
  battleship.</p>

  <p>"She can do nine knots," said the indignant officer.</p>

  <p>Bones could afford to smile.</p>

  <p>"Ever been on the <i>Zaire</i>, dear old ship-mate?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The <i>Zaire</i>? Do you mean that row-boat with the chimney-stacks?"
  demanded the captain.</p>

  <p>Bones quivered.</p>

  <p>"She can do twelve knots, old thing&mdash;fourteen when I'm in charge of
  her."</p>

  <p>"Wake up," said the captain of the <i>Tiny</i> insultingly.</p>

  <p>There they might have parted, but the conversation occurred in the boiler
  room, and Bones' eye was attracted to a bundle of curiously shaped
  instruments. They had wooden handles and long, jagged blades. In appearance
  they might well have been mistaken for two-sided saws. Bones pulled one from
  the bundle and examined it curiously.</p>

  <p>"That's a boiler knife," explained the captain shortly. "We use them to
  clean out the boilers. They'd be too big for the <i>Zaire</i>&mdash;she wants
  pen-knives!"</p>

  <p>Bones gasped as there came to him the recollection of his promise. Nothing
  so ferocious as these boiler cleaners had ever been seen in the
  Territory.</p>

  <p>"Dear old Nelson," he said agitatedly, "forget all the perfectly awful
  things I've said about your perfectly awful ship; accept my apologies, dear
  old Paul Jones, but could you, could you let me have a couple of these jolly
  old scrapers?"</p>

  <p>"You can have the lot," said the captain magnificently. After all he
  hadn't to pay for them.</p>

  <p>Bones went ashore with the two fearsome weapons tucked under his arms, and
  spent the evening in his hut, covering the blades with varnish and the
  handles with a bright design in red, green and yellow paint.</p>

  <p>By the mail steamer which called at Administrative Headquarters a week
  later, there arrived a long parcel and a long but dignified letter.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Young Miss Doran</span>,
  Excelsior! In other words, I have found them I have found them. It was a
  terible business teribble business. I will not tell you of my adventures my
  jolly old aventures facing fearful hord odds. I will not tell you, dear old
  skeptic, of the dangers through which I pased passed. No, young miss, it is
  not for old Bones to blow his own trumpit. But what do I care for danjir
  dannger....</p><br>

  <p>There was a great deal more in this strain.</p>

  <p>"How perfectly wonderful!" breathed Miss Doran Campbell as she examined,
  with a delicious shudder, the terrifying presents that the mail had
  brought.</p>

  <p>The matter should have ended with her ecstatic letter of thanks, which
  Bones carried in the pocket nearest to his heart for the greater part of a
  month. Or it might as well have ended with the receipt by an enthusiastic
  collector in Scotland of two boiler knives, which later appeared in a glass
  case inscribed "Execution knives from Central N'gombi tribe. Very rare."
  Unfortunately, the collector was also a writer. He penned an article in a
  local newspaper. A reader of the local newspaper had a son who was occupying
  a position on an important New York journal. In course of time the Sunday
  edition of this newspaper came out with a whole page showing the map of
  Africa, sprinkled with photographs of natives, and a large picture, ex
  tending across the page, of the two knives. There was also a heading:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">What the U.S. Anthropological Commission Missed.<br>
  Mystery Knives, of Lost Tribe find<br>
  their way to Scottish Museum.</p><br>

  <p>Dr. Wade, leader of the anthropological commission, was not unnaturally
  annoyed. He wrote a long article in a scientific journal, giving a faithful
  account of how he had sought for these knives. It needed but this to stir the
  wrath and indignation of the scientific and lay press. A Chicago newspaper
  appeared with a splash heading.</p><br>

  <p class="headline">U.S. SCIENTIFIC MISSION FOOLED BY BRITISH
  OFFICIAL</p><br>

  <p>The Secretary of State wrote to the British Ambassador a private letter,
  in the course of which:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'...it is rather unfortunate that this has happened. Wade
  tells me that he made every effort to get these knives, and seemingly they
  were available. In fact, either Mr. Sanders or Sir Macalister Campbell must
  have had them in their possession all the time. I wish you would look into
  this. The Institute people are rather annoyed.'</p><br>

  <p>The British Ambassador thought the matter of sufficient interest to cable
  London. But before this message could be dealt with, an echo of the ruffled
  American press had reached Parliament.</p>

  <p>Mr. Burber (East Notts.) asked the Colonial Secretary whether his
  attention had been drawn to an extract in that morning's Daily Megaphone
  concerning the discourtesy shown by British officials to a great scientific
  expedition. Sir John Fenny, Colonial Secretary, replied that the matter had
  not been brought to his notice, but he would cause enquiries to be made. That
  evening a long message went forward to Sir Macalister Campbell.</p>

  <p>Sir Macalister had no time to reply, when two London newspapers, not
  exactly friendly to the Government, had taken up the cause of the
  commissioner.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">'Whilst we have every desire to further scientific
  research' [said the Daily Post], 'and to pay the tribute due to American
  enterprise, is not our first duty to ourselves? We are paying the United
  States an enormous sum per annum in the reduction of our debt. Surely it is a
  little unreason able that the United States should object to our retention of
  historical treasures discovered in British territory.'</p>

  <p>In the meantime:</p>

  <p>"The curious thing about me, Ham, old boy," said Bones complacently, as he
  lay stretched on a chair on the stoep and watched four Houssa defaulters
  drilling under the watchful eye of a sergeant, "is that wherever I go, dear
  old sir and officer, I'm popular. Popularity seems to come natural to some
  people."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever know a clown that was unpopular?" snarled Hamilton, in the
  convalescent stage of a fever bout.</p>

  <p>Bones could afford to smile.</p>

  <p>"Not being so well acquainted with jolly old circus tumblers as you, Ham,
  I can't tell you. But it's a funny thing that from the Administrator down to
  you."</p>

  <p>"You're not popular with me; get that delusion out of your diseased mind,"
  said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Look at dear old Excellency Campbell! Look at jolly little Miss Doran!
  Look at your own revered and beloved Excellency! For me?" He rose to meet the
  telegraph operator.</p>

  <p>"No, sab, for the Commissioner."</p>

  <p>It was a long telegram, Sanders noted, as, groaning, he took the message
  in his hand. Hamilton saw his face drop.</p>

  <p>"Trouble, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"More work for poor old Bones," murmured that young man. "It's a very
  funny thing about me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Everything's funny about you," snapped Hamilton.</p>

  <p>And then Sanders' voice broke in.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is all this about? Listen:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"VERY URGENT. REPORT IMMEDIATELY HOW N'GOMBI EXECUTION
  KNIVES CAME INTO YOUR POSSESSIONS WHETHER THEY WERE IN YOUR POSSESSION WHEN
  AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION HERE, CIRCUMSTANCES OF DISCOVERING THEM.
  REQUEST SPECIAL REPORT FROM LIEUTENANT TIBBETTS GIVING NAME OF VILLAGE,
  CUSTODIAN AND OTHER PARTICULARS. THIS INFORMATION REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENT
  WITHOUT DELAY. ACKNOWLEDGE."</p><br>

  <p>"Execution knives?" said Sanders. "They mean the Splendid Things, I
  suppose. But you didn't find them, did you, Bones?"</p>

  <p>Bones was blinking rapidly; his mouth was open but only strange sounds
  issued.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, dear old Excellency&mdash;" he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Did you find them or didn't you?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"The truth is, dear old sir and Commander-in-Chief&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dear old officer, was I to blame?" said Bones rapidly, almost tearfully.
  "Here's a jolly old young miss... word of honour, dear old officer... I
  promised her, dear old Ham... a gentleman... a lady... gracious heavens
  alive, dear old sir, my jolly old honour was at stake!"</p>

  <p>"Even if it had been something important, you had no right, to deceive the
  girl," said Hamilton severely. "I think that lets us out, sir."</p>

  <p>But Sanders was not looking at him; his eyes were fixed upon the man who
  had been escorted across the square by the sergeant of the guard and who now
  stood before the Residency steps, a bundle in his arms.</p>

  <p>"I see you, Sandi," boomed the stranger. "I am M'laka of the Akasava, and
  I have come many days in my little boat to bring you a wonderful present
  which Tibbetti your son has sought."</p>

  <p>He unrolled the native cloth which covered the knives he carried.</p>

  <p>"Here, lord, is the magic of the Inner N'gombi people, for I have found
  the Splendid Things which destroyed my brother."</p>

  <p>Sanders stared down at the execution knives curiously worked and terribly
  sharp, and he saw that one was stained brown, and guessed that stain for the
  blood of B'firi, the headman.</p>

  <p>There came to Bones a letter from Administrative Headquarters, and for a
  long time he had not the courage to open it:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dere Mr. Bones</span> [the letter
  began, severely enough], I reely am supprised at you. You've made me look a
  perfect fool!!! Papa has sent on the real execution knife to America, and
  I've had to rite to Scotland to get back that wretched, wretched boiler
  knife. After this our corrispondince must cease. You have treated me
  abomininably. You seem to forget I am no longer a child.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Doran Campbell.</span></p>

  <p class="letter">P.S. Couldn't you get me the other real knife? Do be a

  <h2><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">VIII. &mdash; BONES THE PSYCHIC</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">MISS CAROLINE TIBBETTS was a lady of amazing character. She
  was one of three sisters and brothers, and no one knew the extent of her
  wealth. The very uncertainty in this respect was her charm and her attraction
  to a dozen distant relatives, all of whom hoped that, whatever else happened,
  her nephew Augustus would do something terrible in Aunt Caroline's eyes, to
  leave the way open for a fair distribution of property amongst those who had
  less claim to it. For she was notoriously touchy and staid, was a Baptist in
  good standing, a supporter of missions sent out by that admirable sect, and
  intolerant of all who yielded to the temptations which had never come her
  way.</p>

  <p>Bones wrote to her regularly, not because he wanted her money, but for
  fear that she might think that he didn't.</p>

  <p>"Augustus is a very good lad," she said to a needy relation who was
  staying with her at Chichester.</p>

  <p>The relative sighed.</p>

  <p>"Young men&mdash;one never knows what they are up to," she said,
  "especially in a lawless country where&mdash;um&mdash;if one can believe the
  missionary journals, licence is unbridled."</p>

  <p>Miss Tibbetts, who was thin, sharp-featured and rather short, sniffed. She
  had reason for sniffing, for she, also, had read the interesting report in
  'Light in Darkness'&mdash;a journal published by the Bomongo Mission.</p>

  <p>There had been a minor scandal in a certain state that had been magnified
  into a major scandal. A certain inspector of police&mdash;but why drag up the
  unamusing details?</p>

  <p>Miss Tibbetts was planning her winter holiday, and had decided upon
  Madeira. The great idea came to her one afternoon in the Bay of Biscay, after
  a little talk with the purser, who was bemoaning the poverty of the passenger
  list and the good accommodation that went begging.</p>

  <p>"By the time we get to the coast the ship will be empty. We lose half our
  passengers at Funchal. And it's a lovely trip, Miss Tibbetts&mdash;and you've
  got a nephew on the coast, you tell me? Well, well, well! We could drop you
  and pick you up on the homeward trip, and you could finish your holiday at
  Madeira. Fever? Good gracious, no! It's as safe as Clapham. And you'd only be
  there a week."</p>

  <p>Miss Tibbetts thought this over. Such of his letters as she could decipher
  filled her with an uneasiness about the spiritual welfare of Augustus.</p>

  <p>She discussed the matter with her companion, the middle-aged lady in
  reduced circumstances who was privileged to call her Caroline, being a
  distant cousin. And Mrs. Crewfer jumped at the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen Augustus for years," said Miss Tibbetts.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Crewfer sighed.</p>

  <p>"I hope he's going on the right way," she said, in a tone that revealed
  her confident belief that he wasn't.</p>

  <p>"The money will make no difference to him one way or the other," said Miss
  Tibbetts, "but I'd like to be sure that it is going to the right person."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Crewfer shook her head. "I hope so," she said, which was not
  true.</p>

  <p>She might have foreseen the complications that were already arising over a
  certain B'lana.</p>

  <p>Because the N'gombi are a forest folk who seldom see the river as
  children, they do not swim, and drown rather easily. Lieutenant Tibbetts once
  dived from the bridge of the <i>Zaire</i> into a stream running at six knots,
  and thick with crocodiles, to rescue a girl of the N'gombi named B'lana. It
  was an act so dangerous and so gallant that Mr. Commissioner Sanders would
  have recommended him for the Humane Society's Medal if a terrified Bones had
  not begged him, almost with tears, not to do any such thing.</p>

  <p>"Bones is the queerest bird in the world," said the wondering Hamilton.
  "You'd never think that one so blatantly immodest would kick up such a
  fuss."</p>

  <p>Sanders smiled.</p>

  <p>"'Bones is a type. They are immodest about virtues they do not possess,
  and diffident when it comes to the recognition of their real qualities. If I
  had offered Bones election to a Fellowship of the Psychical Society, he would
  have leapt at it!"</p>

  <p>Hamilton tossed aside the month-old newspaper he had been reading.</p>

  <p>"Do you think Bones is psychic?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Sanders took his cheroot from his mouth and stared at the Houssa captain
  in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you mean?" he said, startled.</p>

  <p>But Hamilton was very serious.</p>

  <p>"It's a queer fact, and you can verify it, but Bones always seems drawn at
  odd moments to some hobby which has a bearing upon a subsequent experience.
  It is as though he had a subconscious warning that the adventure was coming.
  If he takes up the study of anything&mdash;musical instruments, architecture,
  law, history, whatever it is, I am absolutely convinced it is in preparation
  for some new angle of life that is coming to him."</p>

  <p>He gave instance after instance, and Sanders listened thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"His present psychic phase is a little trying," he said, "but if it is in
  preparation for a personal experience&mdash;I am not very happy about
  it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tibbetts was at the moment a student of astral phenomena.</p>

  <p>"Dear old Ham," he said, when his superior remonstrated that night after
  dinner, "you don't understand, old boy. I've always been physic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you'd only call the dam' thing by its proper name I'd forgive you a
  lot," said Hamilton, wearily. "P-s-y-c-h-i-c&mdash;pronounced 'si'kik.'"</p>

  <p>Bones smiled with great tolerance.</p>

  <p>"Physic is the word, Ham, old lad; don't tell me, dear old officer, that I
  don't understand what I am. I was talking to Millie last night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked the startled Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Millie&mdash;we sat talkin' in my hut for hours. She used to be a friend
  of King Charles, dear old Ham&mdash;but a very respectable young woman,
  fearfully ladylike."</p>

  <p>Hamilton gaped at him in alarm.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;Millie... a girl?"</p>

  <p>Bones nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"She's my familiar, old boy&mdash;nothing familiar about her
  &mdash;fearfully how-d'you-do sort of person..."</p>

  <p>A light dawned on Hamilton. "Do you mean she's a spirit?"</p>

  <p>Bones nodded.</p>

  <p>"How do spirits sit down?" demanded the sarcastic Hamilton. "Did she have
  a drink by any chance?"</p>

  <p>Bones sighed.</p>

  <p>"You're a septic, old boy&mdash;I can't talk to septics. Now, a physic's
  never septic."</p>

  <p>Hamilton agreed.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, we got in touch with an aunt of yours&mdash;begins
  with 'M.'</p>

  <p>"Matilda?" suggested Hamilton, and Bones' long face lit up.</p>

  <p>"That's right, old boy. Your aunt Matilda. She sent a message for you, old
  boy. She's terribly happy over there."</p>

  <p>"Over where?"</p>

  <p>Bones pointed.</p>

  <p>"Good lord!" said Hamilton innocently. "Is she in the guard room?"</p>

  <p>Bones was pained.</p>

  <p>"Sacred subject, dear old officer&mdash;I'm talking about the jolly astral
  plane... where dear old souls go when they pop off."</p>

  <p>Hamilton considered this.</p>

  <p>"And she's happy?"</p>

  <p>"Terribly. She said she's met all the best people, old boy. Jolly old
  Shakespeare and the tennis man&mdash;the johnny who wrote 'Called to the
  Bar', and all that sort of muck. She's in heaven, dear old fellow."</p>

  <p>Hamilton nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad&mdash;I had a letter from her last mail, and she was in Surbiton
  then."</p>

  <p>Bones was very annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Not the game, old officer and septic... leadin' me on... you told me your
  Aunt Matilda was dead, an' naturally I didn't doubt her word... lady an' all
  that sort of thing. You said last Christmas Day 'The old thing's
  buried.'"</p>

  <p>"I didn't!" denied Hamilton hotly. "I said she'd gone to live in
  Surbiton."</p>

  <p>"It's the same thing," snorted Bones.</p>

  <p>He heard voices at night and made a record of the conversations. Hamilton
  heard them and raised Cain with the sergeant of the guard for permitting his
  sentries to grow talkative in the middle of the night. Bones protested the
  unearthly nature of the voices; he was supported by the sergeant of the
  guard, dazed and happy to find such support.</p>

  <p>One day...</p>

  <p>"Something has got to be done about Bones," said Hamilton. "He's throwing
  trances&mdash;last night his spirit went to England without so much as my
  leave."</p>

  <p>It was B'lana of the N'gombi who really made ghosts and spirits
  unpopular...</p>

  <p>The people of the riverside villages heard the thresh of the
  <i>Zaire</i>'s stern wheel and moved uneasily in their beds; for the
  <i>Zaire</i> did not dare the shoals and sand-banks of the great river by
  night unless there was trouble; and when they heard a loud and raucous voice
  singing in the darkness the song of the fishermen they shuddered, for none
  but ghosts sing at night, though the lanky young vocalist was tangible
  enough.</p>

  <p>A watchman on the beach of the Ochori city saw the <i>Zaire</i> coming
  into sight, its twin funnels belching masses of sparks, and, seeing, he
  strode swiftly to the hut where Bosambo sat, very wakeful and alert.</p>

  <p>"Lord, he comes," said he.</p>

  <p>"I have ears," answered Bosambo curtly. He had heard the wheel of the
  <i>Zaire</i> for nearly two hours before she came into sight. Here the river
  runs swiftly and progress is slow, and ten miles is no great distance for a
  sound to carry on a quiet, windless night. The boat swung broadside to the
  beach, a dozen men scrambled overboard, wading through the river with hawsers
  on their shoulders, and with the gangplanks fixed Lieutenant Tibbetts, who
  had slept all the afternoon, and in any circumstances was never so bright as
  he was at two o'clock in the morning.</p>

  <p>"I see you, Tibbetti," Bosambo's voice boomed from the darkness.</p>

  <p>Bones made his polite reply, and together they walked side by side up the
  dark path to the village. Not until they were inside a big hut, illuminated
  by a tall lamp which bore a suspicious resemblance to one lost from the
  <i>Zaire</i> on her last visit, did Bosambo speak, and with unusual
  gravity.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said, "this is a bad palaver. The N'gombi folk, it seems, have
  gone mad, and my young men have fought two battles with them to-day on the
  edge of the little river. And all for the matter of a small ghost such as I
  would not have in my city."</p>

  <p>Now the Inner N'gombi folk are peculiar in this, that, whilst they admit
  the potency of M'shimba M'shamba, in common with all the people of the river,
  and offer to him the respect which is due to a devil who appears with thunder
  and lightning and great words to tear up the trees and level the stoutest of
  villages, they have, from the beginning of time, elected and appointed their
  own supreme devil who is master of all other devils and greater.</p>

  <p>His name is Dhar, and such a name is not to be spoken aloud, but whispered
  into a little hole dug in the ground, for Dhar is the devil of earth and
  heaven, arbiter of fate, giver of life and supreme spirit of death. Dhar
  brings the seasons and supports in his two hands the sun and the moon, and
  his eyes are the stars and the hairs of his head are the lesser ghosts and
  devils. Since the Inner N'gombi are a proud and warlike people, very
  sensitive to slight and very quick to avenge an affront, it was a little
  embarrassing to officials and neighbours alike that the exact manifestation
  of Dhar was invariably a mystery. Dhar could be as easily a man or woman, a
  rock&mdash;something animate or inanimate. Once, cala cala, which means long
  ago, he was a monkey kept in a large cage in the forest, and fed daintily.
  Always Dhar is guarded by three maidens of the tribe. Night and day one sits
  in rapt contemplation of his splendours.</p>

  <p>"Lord, how did my young men know that these infidels had chosen a tree?"
  pleaded Bosambo.</p>

  <p>"How did your young men hunt in the forests of the N'gombi?" asked Bones
  sternly. "Is it not forbidden that the Ochori should take their spears beyond
  the little river?"</p>

  <p>Bosambo very tactfully offered no explanation as to this. The N'gombi
  forest abounds in game&mdash;the adjacent Ochori territory is notoriously
  bare.</p>

  <p>"And coming to this place, they saw a dead tree and cut it down for their
  fires," Bosambo went on rapidly. "Now, lord, trees are trees, and only
  heathen men give them souls&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"O Bosambo," said Bones quietly, "did not the blessed Prophet, in the year
  of the Hegira, speak with a tree and cause it to be buried as a true
  believer? And if Mahomet did this, who are you to say that the N'gombi people
  are infidels?"</p>

  <p>Bosambo floundered.</p>

  <p>"But this tree was dead&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"So, also, was the tree of Mahomet, for it was a pillar in his mosque,"
  said Bones, who knew his subject rather well.</p>

  <p>Bosambo stared at the storm lantern gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Now I see that my young men were wrong," he said, but brightened up. "Let
  me gather a thousand spears in Sandi's name, and I will go down into the
  N'gombi country and make an end of these idolaters."</p>

  <p>"Don't be an ass!" said Bones testily.</p>

  <p>"Same like missionary," murmured Bosambo, giving English for English. "I
  teach um Marki Luki, Johnni same like. I find um, I smack um, you savvy.
  These fellers be fool! How ghost can be if no ghost is?"</p>

  <p>Bones coughed and returned to the vernacular.</p>

  <p>"Ghosts there are, and I understand palaver," he said. "You talk, Bosambo,
  of things about which you know nothing. I know my own ghost well, and often
  he walks abroad. I will speak to the chief of the Inner N'gombi."</p>

  <p>"Lord, that may be dangerous," said Bosambo. "It would be better to send
  your ghost."</p>

  <p>Bones looked at him hard, but there was no hint of sarcasm in the chief's
  eyes.</p>

  <p>With four soldiers in attendance he left at dawn the following morning for
  the battle front, that same creek which Bosambo and his people were forbidden
  to cross; and here, after an hour's parley, and having overcome the "enemy's"
  natural suspicion that his visit was a punitive one, he was escorted through
  a rank of enraged and sullen warriors to the chief's hut.</p>

  <p>"Lord, these men of the Ochori have done a terrible thing," said M'songo,
  the chief, tremulous with anger, yet a little apprehensive as to what might
  be the outcome of the war he had started. "As you know, Tibbetti, there is in
  this land a Great One." He put his hand before his mouth, a conventional
  gesture to all who spoke even obliquely of Dhar. "And this one lived in a
  fine tree and brought us prosperity for three and three seasons; nobody in
  our village died, and no hurt came to any. But the huntsmen of Bosambo came
  and drove away the maidens who guarded him, saying things to them that
  frightened them. Since our ghost has been destroyed there is death
  everywhere, and only this morning H'laki the woodman was killed by a tree
  falling on him, and all the old men and women have died like fish."</p>

  <p>Bones listened sympathetically to the long statement of grievance.</p>

  <p>"They who came into your land have broken Sandi's law, and they shall be
  punished. At the rise of the next moon Bosambo, the chief, shall send you
  twenty skins and three bags of salt, and at the shallow where they crossed
  the little river I will put up a piece of wood with certain devil marks on
  it, so that who shall come into your territory without Sandi's word shall be
  turned into monkeys. This I do in the name of Sandi, who is your father and
  your mother, and carries your nation in his arms like a little child."</p>

  <p>The chief and his councillors were impressed.</p>

  <p>"Some have been killed in this war, Tibbetti, for there has been
  bloodshed."</p>

  <p>"Let blood wash blood," quoth Bones. "Bring back your young men from the
  river and we will have a great palaver in your city."</p>

  <p>The chief hesitated. His men were hot for vengeance; but the prospect of a
  palaver lasting for days, and offering unlimited opportunities for oratory,
  beloved of the natives, weighed him to the side of law and order. The
  fighting men were drawn back, and that night Bones sat in the palaver house
  and heard the first half-dozen of forty-five headmen, all of whom had
  something uncomplimentary to say about Bosambo.</p>

  <p>On the third day the weary Bones closed the debate.</p>

  <p>"Who shall mourn the seed when it is become a sapling, or the sapling when
  it is become a tree?" he demanded. "Is the Great One "&mdash;he put his hand
  before his mouth in the conventional fashion&mdash;"so small that he cannot
  escape from six Ochori huntsmen, so weak that he cannot live when his house
  is burnt? Now I tell you that he lives and wanders in the forest looking for
  a new home, and this you must find for him as your fathers did. I wish your
  wise men to make a great talk&mdash;this palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>That night, as he slept, he heard a noise at the entrance of his hut and
  was instantly awake, and, turning, saw a shadow in a moonlit patch.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is I."</p>

  <p>It was the soft voice of a woman.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Bones, and putting on his over coat over his pyjamas, went
  out into the moonlight.</p>

  <p>She stood six paces from the hut, tall and slim, a long wand in her hand
  such as the N'gombi women carry.</p>

  <p>"I am B'lana-M'songo, the daughter of the chief," she said, "I am very
  wise and ghosts speak to me."</p>

  <p>"Go back to your bed and to your ghosts," said Bones bad-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I am she that you saved from the walking fish."</p>

  <p>Bones, who had forgotten his act of heroism, scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"All nights and all days I think of you, lord, being a maiden with a
  wonderful mind, and I speak also to the elder men and they listen to me. This
  has happened to no woman before. Lord, I was one of the women who guarded the
  tree when Bosambo's hunters came."</p>

  <p>"O woman, this you must tell me when I wake," said the weary Bones, and
  dismissed one to whom he was as a god.</p>

  <p>He came back to headquarters not unpleased with himself, stopping at the
  Ochori city just long enough to impose a fine, which Bosambo bore, since his
  unfortunate people would have to pay it.</p>

  <p>He made his report to Sanders, not attempting to hide the important part
  his tact and perspicuity had played.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, Excellency, I was in my element, being physic. Mind you,
  there's a lot to be said for these jolly old barbarians&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is the new ghost?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones shrugged his shoulders, and made a clucking noise of
  disapproval.</p>

  <p>"I wish, dear old boy, you'd treat physical subjects physically. Does it
  matter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It matters a lot," said Sanders quietly. "I wish, Bones, you would find
  out, the next time you're up there."</p>

  <p>"From your girl friend," suggested Hamilton coarsely, but Sanders was
  serious.</p>

  <p>"If we could only know for sure which and what is Dhar, it would make
  things rather easy. The N'gombi are getting more and more troublesome, and
  you never know when some innocent outsider will go barging into their
  mysteries. About twenty years ago Dhar was a missionary's cat, and one of the
  Isisi bagged pussy, and there was a war which lasted for the greater part of
  seven years."</p>

  <p>"I'll find out," said the confident Bones.</p>

  <p>"Send your soul for a trot," suggested Hamilton, but Bones was superior to
  such levity.</p>

  <p>He was half-way to his hut when he heard a shout, and, looking round, saw
  Hamilton running towards him.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong, brother officer?"</p>

  <p>"That I can't tell you," said Hamilton. "Do you remember a little
  conversation about my aunt?"</p>

  <p>Bones closed his eyes in resignation.</p>

  <p>"I only asked you," said Hamilton, "because I've got a bit physic myself.
  I've had a message from your aunt."</p>

  <p>"Has she popped off?" asked Bones eagerly.</p>

  <p>"To be exact," said Hamilton, "she's popped up. She's arriving by the mail
  this afternoon. We've just had a wire from headquarters."</p>

  <p>Bones staggered back.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Caroline!" he said hollowly. "Suffering Moses!"</p>

  <p>Ordinarily Sanders did not like visitors, but he had two of his rooms at
  the residency prepared for Miss Tibbetts and her companion, and when she
  arrived, being gallantly carried ashore by Bones&mdash;it was a thousand
  pities that, having made so courteous an effort, he should have put her down
  ankle-deep&mdash;in the surf&mdash;she found, if not a hearty, at least a
  kindly welcome.</p>

  <p>"I am rather worried about my nephew, Mr. Sanders. He has been talking
  quite strangely about certain matters. In fact, I thought he might be
  suffering from one of those terrible mental aberrations which I understand
  this climate produces. He asked me if my spirit walked, and whether I had had
  any manifestations. Would you describe him as a good Baptist, Mr.
  Sanders?"</p>

  <p>"He's a very good fellow," said Sanders cautiously.</p>

  <p>Miss Tibbetts looked at her stony-faced companion. "As to
  his&mdash;um&mdash;morals, Mr. Sanders. It is a delicate subject to discuss,
  but this is a very dangerous climate, and young men..." She glanced at Mrs.
  Crewfer, who shook her head sadly, and seemed pre pared for the worst.</p>

  <p>"That question does not arise," said Sanders, a little stiffly. "Your
  nephew is a gentleman, and that should be quite sufficient answer."</p>

  <p>But Miss Tibbetts was not convinced. That night she had a long, and, to
  Bones, a depressing heart-to-heart talk with him. Mainly it was her heart
  that was concerned. Bones listened with ill-simulated interest. She had the
  haziest ideas of the code which governs men in the Government service. She
  spoke of mesalliances with a freedom that made Bones shudder; she suggested
  possibilities that made his head swim. And then Mrs. Crewfer took a hand.</p>

  <p>"You quite understand that your dear aunt is only talking to you for your
  good, Mr. Tibbetts. One has heard strange stories&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear old distant relation and companion to revered aunt," said Bones,
  stung to annoyance, "all this conversation in front of a young boy is
  perfectly out of order. You are putting ideas in my head, you are really!
  Dash it all, dear old Caroline&mdash;jolly old aunt, I mean&mdash;those sort
  of things are not done, dear old lady, they aren't, really!... Most fearfully
  embarrassing." He broke off incoherently.</p>

  <p>It was the very next morning that Bones woke an hour after daybreak, with
  a consciousness that he was not alone in the room.</p>

  <p>"O Ali," he said, not opening his eyes, "bring me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then he opened his eyes. There were three very young ladies sitting on
  the floor, looking at him with great solemnity. They wore nothing worth
  speaking about, but each had round her head a large garland of dead
  flowers&mdash;cut flowers die readily on the river.</p>

  <p>"O lord, I see you!"</p>

  <p>They spoke in unison, and each lifted a brown palm in salute.</p>

  <p>"What the deuce&mdash;!" stammered Bones, speaking English in his
  agitation. And then he recognized B'lana. "O woman, you must not sit in my
  hut. Who brought you from the N'gombi?"</p>

  <p>"I came by the big river," said the girl, her large brown eyes fixed on
  his. "This woman is the daughter of Shimbiri, and this woman is the daughter
  of Lababuli the headman."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Hamilton, standing on the stoep of the residency, saw
  Bones stalking across the square with three ladies in pursuit.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly ghastly, old boy...I've been elected Dhar... this little
  person's idea." He indicated the serene B'lana. "Something's got to be done,
  old boy. If aunty sees these young persons... good lord!"</p>

  <p>Hamilton looked from Bones to his escort.</p>

  <p>"Your aunt left an hour ago: the ship came back a day earlier than was
  expected." He nodded slowly, communing with himself. "That was why she was so
  haughty."</p>

  <p>"W-why?" Bones was aghast.</p>

  <p>"She said she didn't want you wakened: she'd go into your hut and wish you
  good-bye. Bones, I wouldn't give you fourpence for your legacy."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">IX. &mdash; THE RICH WOMAN</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was a gentleman in New York who sold mining stock. The
  stock was beautiful, being printed in four colours, but the mines were as bad
  as black and white could describe them. He came to the Territories, as one of
  her annual guests, and as he was well supplied with letters of introduction,
  this Mr. Liberbaum was well received. He was a nice man with an extensive
  range of superlatives, and since he was agreeable to his hosts they bore him
  no grudge, even when, as they discovered three months later, he applied for
  and received a government concession to dredge the river, for gold.</p>

  <p>"Gold!" smiled Sanders. "The only gold in the river is my unfortunate
  cigarette-case&mdash;and that would not be there if Bones had not been such a
  goop."</p>

  <p>Bones was so interested by the information that he I did not attempt to
  justify the slight error of judgment&mdash;it happened during the conjuring
  trick that he was giving as they came downstream on the <i>Zaire</i>.</p>

  <p>"That's curious," said Captain Hamilton thoughtfully, "this fellow
  Liberbaum started questioning me about some native legend. He said he had
  heard that there was a mysterious gold mine in the country."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly true, dear old officer," said Bones promptly. "I have heard it,
  too, dear old Ham. Bosambo has heard it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bosambo has heard anything that he can get money out of," said Sanders
  sardonically. "Did he try to sell you stock?"</p>

  <p>Bones was hurt.</p>

  <p>"Of course he has heard it&mdash;it is an old-established native yarn!"
  Sanders scoffed. "Sometimes it is gold, sometimes it is diamonds. Once they
  had a story that in the N'gombi there was a big hole in the ground, out of
  which you could draw a cloth ready woven!"</p>

  <p>It was a considerable time after, and the visit of Mr. Liberbaum had been
  forgotten when there arrived an urgent telegram from headquarters.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">LIBERBAUM SELLING STOCK IN NEW YORK GOLD DREDGING COMPANY
  STATES YOU SAID RIVER ALLUVIAL.</p><br>

  <p>Sanders was sufficiently broken to the ways of official correspondence not
  to reply, "He is a liar," instead he sent a long and decorous denial, and
  added his views that there was not sufficient gold in the whole of the river
  to make a shirt stud of respectable size.</p>

  <p>But so far as Bones was concerned, the mischief was done. Since the
  mention of gold he had devoted himself, with all the enthusiasm and energy of
  which he was capable, to his new hobby. With a huge pipe clenched between his
  teeth, and three groaning paddlers, he had been searching the foreshores of
  the river from its mouth to Lumbiri, and native people came miles to stare
  awe-stricken, watching the perspiring young man sifting and washing the
  sand.</p>

  <p>"If you found gold you would not know what it looked like," said
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones smiled pityingly.</p>

  <p>"If I come to you, dear old boy, with a couple of hands full of auribilous
  metal, dear old thing."</p>

  <p>"'Auriferous' is the word you want," said Hamilton coldly, "and if you
  came with not only a hand, but your mouth full, and that would hold enough to
  keep a widow woman in luxury&mdash;I should simply hand you over to
  headquarters for trying to obtain money by a trick!"</p>

  <p>Again Bones smiled.</p>

  <p>"I can only tell you, dear old septic, that all these johnnies along the
  river know that there is gold! The naughty old lads keep it dark, naturally,
  dear old Ham, but I am a bit of an authority, dear old septic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sceptic," murmured Sanders, lounging in his chair, with his eyes
  closed.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Excellency," with extravagant gratitude. "What I mean to say
  is, that for somebody who has got the confidence of the indigenous native,
  there is a fortune&mdash;millions, old Excellency&mdash;perhaps billions. I
  have got a great idea."</p>

  <p>Hamilton sat up.</p>

  <p>"Hail," he said sardonically, "I knew sooner or later you would get
  one."</p>

  <p>"I have got a great idea "&mdash;ignoring the interruption. "I am entitled
  to three weeks' leave "&mdash;he said this very impressively.</p>

  <p>"Well, Bones?" Sanders woke up and opened his eyes. "What is the
  idea?"</p>

  <p>"I shall take a quiet slope through the country," said Bones speaking
  rapidly. "In fact, Excellency, I am going to put into execution a scheme I
  have had for years. I am going native."</p>

  <p>Hamilton groaned.</p>

  <p>"If that means you are going to paint your body with woad, let me tell you
  there is only one man in the territory who has ever been capable of
  disguising himself as a native, and that is the Commissioner."</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the sort, Bones. It only means that you will go up
  country and stir up the wretched natives to rebellion, or else get yourself
  into such a mess that the Commissioner and I will be kept busy for months
  answering minutes from headquarters."</p>

  <p>To his amazement Sanders did not share his view.</p>

  <p>"I have often thought of doing the same," he said. "I have not played
  native for years, and so long as Bones is not seen about in the day
  &mdash;time he might get away with it. There are one or two matters that I
  should like information on, and about which our agents tell me nothing
  &mdash;I rather think that our men are watched so closely that they have not
  a ghost of a chance to get near anything interesting."</p>

  <p>Sanders had in his mind, as he confessed later, the activities of the
  three brothers of the Akasava, who with their women were the sole occupants
  of a tiny village near the island which is called the Fast Waters, at the
  seaward mouth of one of the deep ravines through which the waters of the
  great river pile. The stream spreads out to a mile in width and in the very
  centre, and a menace to navigation, is this cigar-shaped island, which has no
  inhabitants and for a good reason.</p>

  <p>The yellow waters discharging themselves from the gorge run so quickly,
  and the currents are so treacherous, that no man can be assured that he may
  either gain or leave at his wish. Sometimes, for no apparent reason, the pace
  of the river hereabouts quickens from four to seven knots, and the northern
  arrowhead of the island is partially submerged, a fate which completely
  overtakes this strip of land after heavy rain. On the mainland lived these
  three brothers, who were by profession fishermen, though nobody had ever seen
  their catch, and it was notorious that they purchased dry fish from the
  villages up and down the river. And yet they were prosperous&mdash;they had
  their dogs and their goats and one, the chief of them, had as many as five
  wives.</p>

  <p>There were dark stories about them. It was said when a wife tired of her
  husband, or a man grew resentful of his wife's lover, they came secretly and
  at night bringing payment in advance for certain acts of providence. Some men
  had been found drowned with none to say how they came to their end. One
  fascinating lover, who had brought unhappiness to many homes, was found dead
  in the forest under a fallen tree. Sanders had made many efforts to trap the
  assassins, but never once had he succeeded, and the brothers Shiribi
  flourished.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Less than a week after the consultation and the exposure of
  Bones' great plan, a lank native was seen in the light of dawn paddling up
  the river, keeping to slack waters and avoiding, in a marked fashion, the
  centres of population.</p>

  <p>"If they see you by daylight, your childish camouflage is spotted," said
  Hamilton who came down to the quay at two a.m. on a rainy morning to see his
  subordinate depart.</p>

  <p>"Trust Bones," said that confident young man.</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Which was true: he never did.</p>

  <p>"And I'll come back with the baffling old secret!" yelled the brown man
  from the water.</p>

  <p>"Shur-rup!"</p>

  <p>Hamilton at rare intervals was extremely vulgar.</p>

  <p>There was a woman of the Isisi who differed from all other women because
  she was the only child of her father, and when he had died he had given to
  her riches beyond the dreams of common men. Gardens and rich dogs, salt in
  abundance, rods of brass and twenty skin sacks each full to its sewn mouth
  with silver coins.</p>

  <p>Her wealth multiplied, her fields grew larger, for this slip of a girl had
  learned the mysteries of trading from her father. Skins and rubber, ivory,
  alive and dead, accumulated in her storehouse, even Bosambo, Chief of the
  Ochori, who was not interested in women, came to hear of her and having
  certain goods for disposal&mdash;he usually took a large squeeze of the
  taxation that he remitted to Sanders&mdash;he sent his chief headman to her
  with an invitation and M'Yari came in the state of a queen, in a new canoe
  with sixteen paddlers and in place of the thatched house in the stern of the
  canoe, she had one roofed with cloth.</p>

  <p>Bosambo was all for his dignity; nevertheless he went down to the landing
  place to meet her, and offered her flattery of the most primitive kind.</p>

  <p>"I hear you, Bosambo," said the maiden, when he had finished. "Now, I am
  not come to hear of my beauty, but to see your skins and your rubber and all
  the beautiful things you have stolen from your people."</p>

  <p>Bosambo swallowed that. For three hours they chaffered and bargained. She
  went away with a spare canoe stocked with produce and left the Chief with the
  unhappy feeling that he had been slightly swindled. It was a brand new
  experience and rather intriguing.</p>

  <p>She came again. He adopted a new tactic. His wife having gone to the high
  ground with her child, because of the humidity (she was a Kano woman),
  Bosambo received the rich woman with a banquet and a dance and made violent
  love to her. She held him at spear's end as the saying goes, took back with
  her more of his saleable goods, and this time he had no doubt whatever that
  he had the wrong end of a bad bargain.</p>

  <p>"Such a thing had never been since the beginning," said one, "that a woman
  should be so rich. For women belong to men, just as goats belong, and if they
  belong to men so do all they have, also. Now one of us shall have her as a
  wife. We will go to N'mari the wise man and he shall tell us which. And
  whoever gets her shall divide her riches amongst her relations, a half and a
  half, a half to her uncles and the half of a half to her uncles'
  children."</p>

  <p>It was an uncle who suggested this: the division was disputed but
  eventually agreed. So they went to N'mari the wise man who lived in the Isisi
  forest with his snakes and his birds and strange wild animals that slept
  under his skin bed at nights. With him lived his grandson, the young man
  B'laba who was a great hunter and a very sour and covetous man.</p>

  <p>And they told the old man what they desired. When they had finished he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Go to this young maiden and say, 'We desire you to choose a husband from
  one of us.' Then you shall go away and kill a young cock by the light of the
  moon and each shall smear his hands with the blood, and in the morning he
  whose hands have been cleaned by my magic shall have this woman."</p>

  <p>So they went away and told the girl who sat before her hut with her women
  slaves and she said nothing. But she sent one to spy on them.</p>

  <p>In the dim light of the new moon they sacrificed and smeared their hands
  with blood, and each went to his hut where his immediate relative had a pot
  of water to wash off the stain, and when they met in the morning it seemed
  that they were all chosen. And each stood exposed as a trickster by the
  trickery of his fellow. Yet they went again to the wise man, who knew what
  brought them.</p>

  <p>"Go each of you to a different place. You to the Akasava City, you to the
  little village by the pool of the Silent Ones..." He pointed them out one by
  one and gave, each his destination.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow I will perform a great magic and bring this girl to me. And all
  my little ghosts shall sit around her and she shall not see them. Then at the
  right time I will make her dance until she falls stiffly, and where her head
  points that shall be the place where her lover is and she shall get up and go
  to him."</p>

  <p>The uncles and cousins were hardly out of sight before, looking up in his
  half-blind way, the old man thought he saw a woman before him.</p>

  <p>"I am M'Yari of M'pusu, and I followed these men into the forest knowing
  they came to speak to you about me. Tell me what I must do. For I am very
  rich and I need a husband who will be as my little dog and will eat when I
  say 'eat.' And these brothers of my mother and sons of them are no more to me
  than the fish of the river. If any of them take me I will pay the three
  brothers of the Akasava to follow him into dark places and do with him what
  is necessary."</p>

  <p>At that moment came the old man's grandson.</p>

  <p>"Here is a fine man who shall be all that you need," he said.</p>

  <p>So the maid of M'pusu looked at him and took him home with her, and when
  the cousins and the uncles, weary of waiting, returned from where they had
  gone, they found this man in the rich girl's hut, and it seemed that he was
  master of her and her wealth. For every night they heard the whistle of his
  hide whip and the smack of it as it fell. But she never cried nor called upon
  her kin. One night she took a canoe and four women to paddle her.</p>

  <p>M'Yari's canoe came in the darkest hours to the little congregation of
  huts where the three Akasava brothers lived, and since they did their
  dealings by night, they were waiting for her on the beach, three cold, silent
  men. They knew she was coming, and she was not surprised, and they knew, for
  in this land mind speaks to mind in some inexplicable manner that only native
  folk and the ants understand.</p>

  <p>She told them her business very briefly:</p>

  <p>"This man must not be killed because of Sandi, and his soldiers, but you
  must hold him so that he does not come back to me again, and if you beat him
  a little that will be good."</p>

  <p>They palavered by themselves on this and in the end agreed, for they too
  were anxious not to bring themselves actively into conflict with Sanders.</p>

  <p>In the meantime B'laba awoke and when he found his wife had gone out, he
  was afraid thinking that she had gone to find an Akasava assassin.</p>

  <p>He went back to the forest and saw the wise old man.</p>

  <p>"Take all she has and hide it in a deep hole in the ground," said
  N'Mari.</p>

  <p>For seven nights B'laba sweated under heavy loads, carrying piece by piece
  the treasures that his wife had had in a deep hole under the floor of the
  hut. Salt and rods and skin sacks, their mouths sewn tight and big with
  silver coins.</p>

  <p>On the seventh night as he toiled, there came through the dark woods three
  men of the Akasava. They walked very quietly, none saw their canoe laid at
  the little forest beach where the crocodiles lay basking on sunny mornings.
  Each carried three spears between his four fingers and they came upon B'laba
  as he was stooping to re-lift a load of silver. So that everything was
  favourable for their enterprise. He gave one little hiccupping groan as he
  tumbled over&mdash;and that and the "plop" of the spear haft as it struck his
  head were the only sounds that disturbed the night, for the Akasava brothers
  never spoke, at all. They lifted the unconscious man and brought him to the
  river where a girl was waiting in a canoe and she gave them money to take him
  away.</p>

  <p>They would have gone to the hut of the wise old man in the forest and made
  an end of him, but she said no to this and they left the matter as it
  was.</p>

  <p>The three brothers drew apart and one said to the others: "If Sandi comes
  with his soldiers and hears all that he may hear there will be trouble. Now
  only this woman can speak against us, so let us take her treasure and hide it
  on the island where we will keep this man, and we will take her ashore with
  us."</p>

  <p>He said this and other things and his brothers shook their heads which
  meant agreement.</p>

  <p>"Also if this man is kept alive he may give to us half the treasure and
  Sandi shall not do us harm for it. As for the woman..."</p>

  <p>But when they came to look for her she had left the canoe to drift and had
  gone swiftly through the forest, for it seems she knew their mind.</p>

  <p>So she came in the dark to her own hut and none asked her where she had
  been, nor yet saw her come.</p>

  <p>People came to her and asked her where was her husband, and when she told
  them that he had gone on a long journey, an old uncle, a grizzled old man
  dour of heart and vengeful, was frankly sceptical.</p>

  <p>"Sandi comes soon," he said significantly, "and there will be a great
  palaver, and who knows what will come of your great wealth, your goods and
  your ivory?"</p>

  <p>He left her in a panic. Already her more portable treasures had vanished
  and she had had no redress against the brothers of Akasava, for how could she
  tell Sandi that she had been to these men with her great plan. And when Sandi
  moved in his little white ship, he had a trick of peering in most unlikely
  places. Suppose his devilish curiosity brought him to the Island of Fast
  Waters, and he found there a haltered prisoner?</p>

  <p>She called her chief woman to her.</p>

  <p>"Call paddlers for my fast boat. I go to Bosambo of the Ochori. He is
  wise, though a great lover of money."</p>

  <p>To Bosambo she went, setting forth before the dawn came up over the dark
  gum trees, and this time Bosambo did not meet her on the beach or pay her
  honour, but when he saw her:</p>

  <p>"O woman," he said loftily, "I have nothing to sell! But if you have come
  to give me what is fair for all that you took away, I will listen to you, for
  my heart is soft."</p>

  <p>She sat down before him and crossed her hands meekly. Though she was rich
  she was of the common people, and he was the Chief paramount and reputedly
  related to Sandi.</p>

  <p>For a long time she skirted the matter which had brought her; talked of
  the rains and the crops, and the full river, and the strange signs that had
  been seen in the sky, till Bosambo's stock of patience was exhausted.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me the truth, woman, why you come here? For I am a man with many
  great matters to think about and the talk of women is to me like the
  chattering of monkeys."</p>

  <p>And then she told him, falteringly, more or less falsely and coming to the
  truth unconsciously and by degrees.</p>

  <p>Bosambo had many ears in the Territory. The Ochori people go far afield,
  especially the fishermen, who have no respect for property in waters, and he
  had heard of B'laba, who beat his wife. It had been a very comforting thought
  to Bosambo, but now as she proceeded, his interest in B'laba was a secondary
  one.</p>

  <p>"... and these men I paid well, yet they took my treasures, my fine skins
  and silver, my salt and my ivory, which B'laba my husband stole, and these
  they have hidden in a great hole in the Island of Fast Waters and they have
  tied B'laba by the neck to a tree and every day take food to him. Now,
  Bosambo, I will give you one sack of silver if you will find my treasures and
  bring them to me, but mostly if you carry away with you B'laba, my husband,
  for fear he speaks to Sandi."</p>

  <p>Bosambo was a lover of money as she knew, and it was a little surprising
  that he did not bargain for two or even three sacks of silver.</p>

  <p>He dismissed her graciously and as soon as night fell he took his guard of
  trusted men, he himself wielding a paddle for he had no room to spare in the
  canoe for an unnecessary paddler.</p>

  <p>He saw the fires of the village of M'pusu as he passed, came through the
  gorge and into the current, and with the greatest difficulty made a landing
  on the island. It was a mile and a half in length, a tangle of vegetation.
  His journey through the bush was slow and laborious, but he had the light of
  a moon.</p>

  <p>Bosambo's intentions were more or less honourable, but he had certainly no
  desire to encumber himself with a prisoner. His one wish was to find the
  treasure and to discover it without having recourse to those methods of
  interrogation which might lead him into trouble. As a last resort he might
  interview the three brothers, but this he would rather avoid.</p>

  <p>There had been other visitors to the island that night.</p>

  <p>The three brothers of the Akasava had held a council and they were uneasy
  men for in the first darkness of the previous night they had heard the
  distant rattle of a lokali, that signal drum which carries rumour through
  space. And it had said "A new spy of Sandi moves north."</p>

  <p>One of them who had dealings with the chief of a little village made a
  journey to learn the news.</p>

  <p>"Shiribi, that is true," said the little chief, "for my own brother told
  me. There is a spy who moves in the night, a starved long man who speaks to
  such as he meets in the dark hours and talks of gold such as our father spoke
  about. Sometimes his canoe appears amongst the fishers and he asks them where
  treasures are hidden in the ground."</p>

  <p>"Oh ko!" said the brother in dismay. "I think Sandi has long ears like a
  pig."</p>

  <p>"Also," said the gossip, "this man takes sand from the river and pours
  water over it and mutters in a curious tongue. B'sambo of the Isisi saw and
  heard this, watching the foreigner from the beach. And they say that this man
  goes to all the little islands because N'dama of the Isisi has told him that
  in the little islands are great riches."</p>

  <p>The man of the Akasava knew N'dama for an enemy, for his brother had once
  disappeared and he had gone to Sandi to find him. This was bad news indeed.
  He went back to his brethren and told them all that he had heard.</p>

  <p>"If Sandi hears all that he has to hear, and if he digs in the Island of
  Swift Waters, there will be a rope for us," said the elder.</p>

  <p>For there were many souvenirs of past "trading" that might be found for
  the digging and they had enemies who would whisper of what a spade might
  find.</p>

  <p>"Let us take B'laba and the treasure and bring them to the forest, for
  B'laba will talk."</p>

  <p>They went to the island at nightfall and took a stout rope from his neck,
  but left his hands tied. One (the youngest) was for killing him, but his wise
  elders over ruled him. A dead man needs carrying, they said. B'laba came
  alive to the forest behind the huts where the brothers lived, and the wives
  of these men heard his faint shriek and were unmoved for they had heard that
  sound before.</p>

  <p>When they had finished their work they returned to the isle and with their
  spears uncovered the sacks of silver&mdash;the salt they had already taken to
  their own use.</p>

  <p>The first sack had been lifted to the edge of the hole when&mdash;"O man,
  I see you...!"</p>

  <p>The younger of the brothers looked round with a screech of fright and
  reached for his spear. Before his hand closed upon it, a brother caught his
  arm.</p>

  <p>He had seen the tall figure in the moonlight, naked to the waist.</p>

  <p>"Go!" he whispered, and the three melted noiselessly into the bush.</p>

  <p>Bosambo, moving cautiously through the tangle, did not so much as hear the
  thresh of their paddles. As he came clear of a patch of thorn bushes into a
  wide grove between the trees, he saw a native digging some thing up from the
  ground; evidently there was a hole there, for from time to time the man half
  vanished up to his waist and reappeared groaning as he flung down something
  heavy to the ground, something that tinkled musically in Bosambo's ears.</p>

  <p>Here was a situation that Bosambo had not foreseen. He had hoped that the
  prisoner was at the other end of the island, out of sight and hearing, for he
  had a passionate objection to being recognized as the looter of buried
  silver.</p>

  <p>Slipping off the rug he wore about his shoulders he motioned two men to
  follow him, and creeping silently forward as the tall figure of the digging
  native appeared, he leapt forward, enveloping his head in the rug, and in a
  few minutes the squirming prisoner was bound hand and foot.</p>

  <p>"O man," said Bosambo softly, "if you will make a noise I will beat you!
  And if you fight I will kill you!"</p>

  <p>There was need for this injunction because the prisoner was making more
  noise than a sensible prisoner should make and was struggling with great
  desperation.</p>

  <p>"Keep the cloth over his head and carry him to the canoe," said Bosambo in
  a whisper.</p>

  <p>The remainder of his paddlers shouldered the sacks and made their way back
  to the boat.</p>

  <p>A healthy struggling prisoner Bosambo had not foreseen, and his canoe was
  level almost with the water's edge when the paddlers struck swiftly for the
  north.</p>

  <p>An hour before the first light dawned in the east, Bosambo had reached the
  Ochori city.</p>

  <p>"Bring this man into my hut," he commanded.</p>

  <p>They obeyed him. It was dark in the hut. Bosambo was most desirous that he
  should not be seen.</p>

  <p>"B'laba," he said softly, "I am a friend who has saved you from the woman
  who tied you to a tree in the little island, and from the three brothers of
  the Akasava, and this woman will never forgive me because I have saved you.
  So you must not see the face of your friend for fear you betray me. Presently
  I will put you in a canoe and let you drift in the waters and..."</p>

  <p>He was untying the wrist of the man when his hand touched something on the
  prisoner's wrist and he gasped.</p>

  <p>"O Bosambo," the voice from the bound and trussed man on the floor was
  hollow and breathless, "for this you shall suffer great pain!"</p>

  <p>Bosambo did not collapse, he gripped tightly to the skin bed on which he
  was sitting.</p>

  <p>"You are a fearful old bounder," roared the voice in English. "By gad!
  I'll... I'll...!"</p>

  <p>"Tibbetti," quavered Bosambo in coast-Arabic, "is it thou?"</p>

  <p>He called for lights; when they came he stared down on a lank and
  painfully thin native, but despite his greased and blackened hair there was
  no difficulty in recognizing Bones. Even if he had not seen the thing on his
  wrist.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"I was naturally fearfully annoyed," explained Bones to his
  interested audience at the residency, "and when he told me he had heard I was
  in danger and rescued me against my bally will, well, that simply made me see
  red! The most astonishing thing, dear old Sir and Excellency, was that those
  bags that I thought had money in them hadn't silver at all!"</p>

  <p>"No," said Sanders dryly.</p>

  <p>"No," said Bones, "that is the astonishing thing about it, they were full
  of shells and bits of brass and flint spearheads and things, every one of
  'em: And Shiribi fellows&mdash;bad lads every one of 'em, I collected them on
  my way down&mdash;these ghastly fellows said that the bags were full of
  silver!"</p>

  <p>"And they were not," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Bits of iron, dear old Excellency," said Bones.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me this,"&mdash;Sanders was more than interested&mdash;"how
  long was it after you revealed yourself to Bosambo, that you examined the
  sacks?"</p>

  <p>Bones screwed up his eyes which meant that he was thinking.</p>

  <p>"About an hour."</p>

  <p>"Tons of time for Bosambo," said Sanders and Hamilton together.</p>

  <p>Sanders looked at his subordinate thoughtfully. "I'm afraid you're not a
  master of disguise, Bones&mdash;I heard about your progress from village to
  village. Everybody knew you but they were too polite to say so: they called
  you the new spy."</p>

  <p>"Knew me, dear old Excellency?" squeaked Bones incredulously. "But my dear
  old Excellency Ham, old lad... my disguise was wonderful. I shan't get that
  beastly stain off for months..."</p>

  <p>"A perfect disguise, I agree," said Sanders, "but wandering natives do not
  wear wrist watches."</p>

  <p>Bones was more interested than abashed.</p>

  <p>"Then how the dooce do they tell the time?" he asked.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X. &mdash; THE KEEPERS OF THE TREASURE</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">YEARS and years ago, <i>cala cala</i> as the saying is, when
  the Portuguese were in the land, came many canoes along the great river. In
  those days there was a river that ran through the N'gombi country&mdash;it is
  now an overgrown depression in the forest. Whence came this expedition nobody
  knew. The men camped on the edge of the Ochori country and made a
  fortification with the help of forced labour. Then came other men in pursuit,
  and there was a great battle of swords and spears, and in the end the
  attackers succeeded. Every defender was put to the sword, but when the
  victorious captain came to look for the ten great boxes which the fugitives
  had brought with them they were not to be found. They had been buried by
  somebody&mdash;legend gave credit to a score of somebodies.</p>

  <p>From time to time adventurers had sought the hiding place; one chief of
  the Ochori, who was supposed to know where the boxes were hidden, had been
  put to the torture; commissioners had made the most careful enquiries,
  commanders of expeditions who were of a romantic turn of mind had dug and
  probed, but all to no purpose.</p>

  <p>There remained this substance to the legend, that in a village of the
  Ochori three men were called The Keepers of the Treasure Place, and the
  office was hereditary and very old.</p>

  <p>What treasure they guarded no man knew. They professed to have exact
  information, and whispered their secret to every new guardian that death
  appointed.</p>

  <p>The Portuguese treasure was a common subject of gossip up and down the
  coast. Once Lieutenant Tibbetts had made an ineffectual search, guided by a
  dream. Captain Hamilton of the King's Houssas suggested a remedy for such
  dreams.</p>

  <p>"Coarseness, dear old thing!" murmured Bones, shocked. "Vulgarity, dear
  old officer! Come, come, this will never do!"</p>

  <p>"Did you really dream you saw the cave?" asked Sanders, interested.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Excellency and friend. A dashed big cave in the side of the
  mountain. Wonderful lights, all colours, inside. And I stepped brightly into
  the cave an' there was a dear old johnny in a white robe, an angel or
  something ghastly, and he said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Welcome, Ali Baba'?" suggested Hamilton. Bones made a tutting noise.</p>

  <p>The next time he went into the Ochori he came to a village reputedly built
  on or near the site of the treasure trove, and interviewed the chief.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is true that I and two very old men are keepers of this wonder
  which no man has seen because of the devils who sit under the trees by day
  and night and change into a hundred leopards when man goes near them. But the
  place may not be told until I and the two old men die."</p>

  <p>Bones spent a week in the forest, looking for a place where buried
  treasure might be, and all the time he was stalked by the slim widow who
  coveted the treasure. In course of time Bones went back to face the withering
  sarcasms of his superior officer, but the widow continued her search, for she
  had a rapacious lover who desired wealth&mdash;a tall, broad man who
  plastered his hair with clay and wore the skin of a leopard and stood around
  in statuesque attitudes, but did nothing much else to earn his living.</p>

  <p>This woman, whose name was N'saki, had had three husbands and each of
  these died. There was nothing remarkable about their ends. They were very
  old, and the Dark One beckons such with great frequency. Such is the mind of
  man that when she offered herself to M'gama, the middle-aged chief of the
  village, he rejected her.</p>

  <p>"It seems that there is a devil in you, N'saki, so that men who have loved
  you go quickly to the ghosts. Three Keepers of the Treasure have taken you to
  their huts and three have died. Now, I desire to live, and all the loveliness
  you offer me is as nothing if I die."</p>

  <p>N'saki was a rich woman, her three husbands having been plentifully
  blessed. Also she was beautiful to look upon and so clever that she read
  men's minds. She was eighteen, slim as a reed, and childless. And she greatly
  wished to be the wife of the chief of the village, who reputedly shared the
  secret of the buried treasure. Some said this was dead ivory and some that it
  was white man's wealth. Her handsome lover favoured the latter theory.</p>

  <p>"All you have done is for nothing, woman," he said irritably. "Three dying
  men have you had in your hands and none told you the Magic Ground, and their
  places have been filled."</p>

  <p>"O, N'kema-M'libi!" she pleaded. "I did what was to be done; some I choked
  a little, so that they were frightened, but because of their ju-ju they
  feared worse to tell me. Now, M'gama is a greater coward, and if he would
  have had me as his wife I would have made him speak. I will ask him again,
  and if he will not take me I will go to Bosambo and tell him of this
  treasure, for I think that M'gama knows of the little yellow cup."</p>

  <p>Now, this was true, that there had appeared in M'gama's hut a yellow cup
  of beautiful design, and, wise men knew it was gold, but none was so wise
  that he could guess where M'gama had found it. N'saki guessed.</p>

  <p>"I will find a way," she said.</p>

  <p>Eventually she found it, with the aid of a man from Senegal and another
  from the Kroo coast, who were at that moment newly arrived on the coast from
  the city and state of New York.</p>

  <p>One of these was from Dakar, and his name was Fendi. He was a black man,
  Nubian black as distinct from the brown men of the river. The French did not
  like Fendi, who spoke three languages well, and since the French are masters
  of Senegal their antipathy counted. They did not like his influence or the
  prosperity which enabled him to live in enviable luxury, but their first
  objection to him was his poisonous contact with civilization. For Fendi had
  been to France, had fought in the ring both in Paris and in New York, and had
  been expelled from the latter city at the instance of the emigration
  authorities ("Where'n hell's this Dakar, anyway?" asked the puzzled
  official.)</p>

  <p>Fendi had joined up with certain tough forces in Harlem, where he had
  lived for five years, and his American adventures had terminated with a gang
  fight in which razors, automatics and broken glass had figured
  conspicuously.</p>

  <p>They took Fendi out of the hospital whither unloving hands had borne him
  and put him on a boat bound for the coast.</p>

  <p>"Come back and we'll bump you," said an official significantly.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be the first gen'leman you've bumped," said Fendi
  defiantly.</p>

  <p>He took away with him from the United States enough money to live (by
  Dakar standards) in comfort for the rest of his life.</p>

  <p>With him was exported one Mr Seluki, a native of Liberia and a Master of
  Arts of the University of Romeville (Oklahoma). That M. A. set him back two
  hundred bucks. Seluki stopped off at Dakar, and, with his friend, went up to
  St. Louis, which lies at the end of the railway. St. Louis was dull; Dakar
  was slow. They came back to the capital and settled down with certain
  undesirable elements in the lower town.</p>

  <p>Fendi's pride in his home town brought no enthusiastic response from his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Yuh! That Governor General's palace is fine, but gimme Little Old!"</p>

  <p>In this familiar way did he refer to the Empire City of New York.</p>

  <p>In the lodging house where they stayed they met a Christian,
  American-trained native who had worked with the missionaries until he was
  found out. He had stories to tell of a land flowing with milk and
  honey&mdash;a raw, rich country stiff with dead ivory. "Why, fellers, there
  was a guy from Liberia, a nigger named Bosambo, who went in and cleaned up,
  and he's worth a million dollars if he's worth talking about. And have you
  heard about the buried treasure? A million dollars' worth, and any guy could
  snitch it."</p>

  <p>Fendi listened and was fascinated; Seluki had heard of Bosambo and the
  treasure before.</p>

  <p>A month later the two boarded an Elder Dempster boat southward.</p>

  <p>"What you gotta do," counselled the Christian man, "is to play native. You
  go in fresh an' start cracking English and this guy Sanders'll fire you out
  so that you'll never feel the grass rustle under your feet. And don't pull
  any missionary stuff neither. He won't stand for Allelulia niggers. Get him
  right and he's dead easy."</p>

  <p>To the residency on a certain afternoon came two humble natives and
  Seluki, who talked Bomongo fluently, was the spokesman.</p>

  <p>"Lord, we wish to go to our cousin Bosambo," he said glibly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders surveyed the men coldly.</p>

  <p>"You are Liberian, but this man is from Senegal," he said.</p>

  <p>Fendi was startled. This was the first white man he had ever met who could
  differentiate one tribe from another at a glance.</p>

  <p>"Also you must tell me why you wish to go to the Ochori. Once before a
  poor relation of Bosambo came here and there was trouble, for Bosambo is no
  rich man with alms to give."</p>

  <p>"Nor are we poor men, lord," said Seluki eagerly. "I bring a bag of silver
  and I have a book for money."</p>

  <p>He produced before the sceptical Commissioner a bag of veritable cash. The
  three boxes that had been landed on the beach were not opened.</p>

  <p>"Go with God," said Sanders, "you and the Sengalese. But this is a wild
  country, and here there are many bad men. You shall not blame me if your
  money goes in the night."</p>

  <p>Fendi smiled to himself.</p>

  <p>They engaged paddlers from Chubiri to take them up stream, but long before
  they reached the Ochori country Bosambo had news of their coming, for Sanders
  had sent him a pigeon message, but, as the Commissioner had not mentioned the
  bag of silver, Bosambo's greeting lacked cordiality.</p>

  <p>The long journey up river had been profitable in one respect. Fendi, like
  other natives of the coast, had a smattering of all the dialects; by the time
  they reached the Ochori city he was as proficient in Bomongo as his
  companions. He was not particularly happy.</p>

  <p>"This country is one large morgue," he grumbled. "There isn't ten cents in
  any of these villages. Compared with them, a Harlem slum's like Riverside
  Drive. You've certainly got me for a sucker."</p>

  <p>"You haven't seen the big stuff yet," said Seluki mysteriously and Fendi
  grunted.</p>

  <p>Fendi had the instincts of a gangster, and, providing there were any
  pickings to pick, he saw the immense possibility of this land which had
  distance without communication.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he said, the day before they reached the Ochori,
  "there's no gat in the country, except them that the soldiers have got down
  to the mouth of the river."</p>

  <p>Seluki explained the law. Firearms were prohibited. He had already told
  his friend that.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Fendi, "but naturally I thought there would be a bit of
  graft here; someone must be running guns on the side."</p>

  <p>He was impressed by the bulk of Bosambo, a little irritated by his
  hauteur.</p>

  <p>"I see you, man," said Bosambo, addressing his fellow countryman Seluki.
  "I see you, yet I do not know you. I have nothing to give you, and when you
  have slept you shall take your paddlers and return to your own home. Who am I
  that I should keep hungry men from Liberia?"</p>

  <p>"O Bosambo," said Seluki loftily, "I ask nothing of you. I come as a
  giver."</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands, and one of his men lugged forward the bag of silver,
  and Seluki carefully unrolled the top. Bosambo looked and blinked.</p>

  <p>"Ah, now I see that you are my friend," he said enthusiastically. "Tell
  me, brother, does Sandi know you brought this great treasure for me?"</p>

  <p>Seluki swallowed something.</p>

  <p>"Sandi knows I have the money," he said, "but no man knows that I have
  brought this to you; for this is my own. Yet I will let you take all that
  your two hands can hold."</p>

  <p>Bosambo stepped down from his stool and was about to plunge his hands into
  the bag, then stopped.</p>

  <p>"First I will pray in my hut, for I am of the true faith, Seluki, and I
  will ask the guidance of the Prophet."</p>

  <p>He was gone some time. When he reappeared he walked quickly to the bag,
  thrust in his hands and arms to his elbows, and Fendi gasped as he saw the
  amount that was removed. For some curious reason money was not only held in
  his hands, but covered his arms like huge silver spangles.</p>

  <p>"O ko!" said Seluki in dismay.</p>

  <p>Bosambo went straight to his hut, deposited the silver, and washed off the
  thick copal gum which he had spread on his arms. When he came back he was in
  the most amiable frame of mind.</p>

  <p>"You shall sleep in my best hut, and to-night I will have a great dance
  for you. To-morrow you shall sit in my palaver house on my right hand and my
  left, and the people shall do homage to you. As for that bag of silver, I
  will put it in a safe place."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing safer than my own hut, Bosambo," said his guest with some
  acerbity.</p>

  <p>There was a dance that night which was witnessed by two other strangers to
  the city. N'saki had come a long journey to make a palaver with Bosambo about
  a certain gold cup of curious design.</p>

  <p>After the dance Fendi saw a comely girl edging towards the select crescent
  of spectators. With a vanity which is eternal in man he thought her eyes were
  for him, and, detaching himself from the guests at a moment when all eyes
  were for the swaying bodies of the dancers, he came up to her.</p>

  <p>"O woman, I am the man you seek." Here he was wrong; but N'saki was an
  opportunist and knew him, by the quick reputation he had acquired, to be both
  rich and powerful. "To-night I shall sit in the little hut which has been
  made for me," he said. "Let us talk together and I will tell you of people
  like none other in the world."</p>

  <p>She shook her head, which means "yes," and that night she went to him,
  and, when she had the opportunity of talking, she told him of M'gama and the
  little golden cup.</p>

  <p>Three days after, he took from one of his boxes a bundle of cloth and
  unrolling this exposed four automatics with appropriate etceteras. He and
  Seluki left, ostensibly on a hunting trip, accompanied by three bearers. Near
  to the village of M'gama the bearers were to be sent back, but before that
  could happen an unfortunate thing occurred. One of the bearers was a spy of
  Bosambo's, sent to report on the doings of the strangers. He was an
  inquisitive man and he was curious to know what were the contents of the
  little bags which the adventurers carried strapped to their shoulders.</p>

  <p>In the dark of the night he opened one and saw the automatic and the spare
  magazines and took counsel with his fellows.</p>

  <p>"O ko! These men carry the little-little guns that say 'ha ha,' and this
  Bosambo must know."</p>

  <p>As they squatted over their fire Fendi rolled over to his companion and
  woke him.</p>

  <p>"These niggers have lamped the gats, Selu'. They gotta be bumped."</p>

  <p>The "bumping" occurred at daybreak. Two of the bearers fell in their
  tracks and never knew what hit them. The third, the spy, ran for it, the
  bullets whistling after him. It was Seluki who dropped him at the edge of the
  small stream Busini, and Fendi, running up, saw the water pink with blood and
  the swirl of a quickly moving crocodile.</p>

  <p>He went back, and with his companion hid the bodies of the carriers he had
  slain.</p>

  <p>"If that 'jane' plays square we'll be outa this country before there's a
  breeze. French territory's forty-five miles due north&mdash;and I'm a French
  subject!"</p>

  <p>The "jane" was waiting an hour's march away from the scene of the tragedy,
  and with her her tall and statuesque lover, who leaned on a spear and said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>Her first words were disconcerting.</p>

  <p>"Show me your little-little gun that killed Bosambo's men."</p>

  <p>Being vain, Fendi showed her the automatic. To his surprise she handled
  the weapon scientifically.</p>

  <p>"These I have seen," she said. "Once there was a soldier of Sandi who
  loved me for a week and he showed me these mysteries."</p>

  <p>She pulled back the safety catch, deftly removed the magazine and replaced
  it, before she handed it back to the impatient gangster.</p>

  <p>Her plan was simple. On the rind of the moon M'gama and the two old
  keepers of the treasure went out into the forest, throwing curses behind them
  and weaving their ju-jus to guard their path. So that any who followed or
  spied on them would be stricken blind and presently would be devoured inch by
  inch by a most terrible lizard.</p>

  <p>"He will come this night," she said. "We will rest here until the trees go
  to sleep on the ground, and then I will show you the way."</p>

  <p>At sunset, when the shadows of the trees ran for enormous distances, she
  walked ahead of them into a gloom that became instantly night. The rind of
  the moon was in the sky when they reached their destination, and they
  squatted within sight of the forest path down which presently would come
  M'gama and the two trustees.</p>

  <p>Punctually to the minute three figures came out of the gloom and vanished,
  with M'saki and the two strangers on their trail. For an hour they walked
  noiselessly until they came to a small knoll where stood four trees, and at
  the foot of the knoll M'gama and his two companions halted and performed
  mysterious rites, and would have gone away again, only Fendi and his
  companions stood in their path.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Fendi, when the three old men were tied securely, "tell me
  where this beautiful treasure is hidden."</p>

  <p>He questioned them all night, using various methods. One old man died in
  the process, but the other two were dumb. He had a brief consultation with
  Seluki.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to let up on these two old guys," he said. "Give 'um a rest,
  and maybe to-night they'll squeal."</p>

  <p>"What about the 'jane'?" asked Seluki.</p>

  <p>Fendi looked over his shoulder at the girl and her motionless lover.</p>

  <p>"They've gotta be bumped," he said.</p>

  <p>It was not two days or three days or yet four when the last of the living
  men spoke, and for six hours Fendi and his friend dug into the solid earth.
  They recovered many things that remained of the loot of a forgotten African
  monastery, filched by Portuguese filibusters; cups and chalices and golden
  vessels, and a rotting bag of gold coins.</p>

  <p>The lover did not assist in the digging, but he helped to carry the
  treasure to the river that trickled into the French territory, and which was
  eight miles distant. He even stirred himself to steal a big canoe from an
  up-river village He chose up river because the canoe floated down with a very
  small expenditure of energy. In the canoe the treasure was loaded.</p>

  <p>"All is well now," said N'saki, "and I will tell you an island where you
  may go and hide."</p>

  <p>"Sure!" said Fendi. "But let's go back and see if there's anything we've
  left behind."</p>

  <p>The four trudged back to the treasure hole.</p>

  <p>"O man," said Fendi, feeling stealthily for his gun, "look deep in that
  hole and see if there is anything we have forgotten."</p>

  <p>The lover staggered forward and bent over, and the gun jerked up and spat
  fire. Fendi turned, his pistol poised, but the girl had vanished. He saw an
  agitated movement of long grass and fired twice, but when he dashed in the
  direction she had taken she had gone, and he could not find her.</p>

  <p>"That's bad. We've got to catch that dame before she gets to the river,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>And then, unrolling his pack, he made a discovery.</p>

  <p>"Where's that other gun?" he asked, and his face went grey.</p>

  <p>For N'saki had once a lover who taught her the mysteries of
  automatics.</p>

  <p>Again he blundered through some undergrowth where he had detected a
  movement, and Seluki was close on his heels.</p>

  <p>"I see you," said a hard little voice.</p>

  <p>The men were so close to her that she could not miss...</p>

  <p>A pigeon came to headquarters. Bones was hustled in the middle of the
  night on to the <i>Zaire</i> with twenty soldiers, and, steaming night and
  day, stopping only at the woodings, he came to the Ochori village, and a very
  serious Bosambo was waiting.</p>

  <p>"Lord, there are guns in this country," he said. "Two men you sent to me
  went out in search of treasure, and they shot my private man. And because
  Sandi has said we must not go against guns, I sent for you."</p>

  <p>Two of his fighting regiments were ready for the march. He strode by the
  side of Bones through the Ochori forest, and presently came to the village of
  M'gama&mdash;but M'gama was not there. Trackers found his body and brought
  Lieutenant Tibbetts to the spot. Earth had been turned here, and Bones
  pointed.</p>

  <p>"Set your young men to dig with their spears."</p>

  <p>They dug for a short time and presently they found Fendi and his friend,
  but nothing else.</p>

  <p>"These men have been shot," said Bosambo. "Here are the little guns."</p>

  <p>Four pistols lay in the hole. M'saki had no further use for them; she was
  paddling a laden canoe towards the French territory, singing a song that was
  all about her dead lover and the treasure that would bring her many
  successors.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">XI. &mdash; THE PRESENT</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">D'MINI, the dancing girl, was a great giver. She gave all
  that clever feet could give to the old king who lives beyond the Ghost
  Mountains, and at night, when he sat nodding before the big fire which burnt
  in front of his fine hut&mdash;and when it was death to his captains and
  servants, and even to his wives if they dared so much as to sneeze, and worse
  than death to a dancing woman if he came awake and found her
  motionless&mdash;she would dance and never stop through his slumberings,
  until her breath came in thin, whistling gasps and her wet and palpitating
  body was one great ache and weariness.</p>

  <p>She gave to M'suru, the old king's captain, who was slightly mad and he
  took all she had to give, and showed her his broad hunting sword with its
  keen edge, and told her what would happen to her if she spoke of their
  friendship; and she gave presents of skin and ivory that came her way at odd
  intervals to an old woman who looked after her, and whom she believed was her
  mother. And in return the old woman gave her dreams.</p>

  <p>Stretched on the skin bed, D'mini listened with closed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Long, long ago, cala cala, the White King came across the Ghost
  Mountains, and with him a tall chief who had a shining eye, and him they
  called Tibbetti. And even the old king was afraid. In this land beyond the
  mountains, all is kindness; and the White King, whose name is Sandi, will let
  no woman be flogged and no man be chopped in the night, and the man with the
  shining eye is his son, and he is very beautiful&mdash;as far as white people
  can be beautiful&mdash;and very kind to women..."</p>

  <p>With these dreams D'mini, the dancing girl, eased the hard way of her
  life, so that when the old man, in a fit of wrath, had her whipped for some
  fault (M'suru knew why she danced so lifelessly) she fixed her mind and her
  soul on the son of Sandi, who was kind to women. Then one day her own
  brother, who lived in a distant village, spoke against the old king, and was
  taken by the king's soldiers and put to torture.</p>

  <p>And neither that night nor the next did M'suru speak to her, and when she
  went to dance before the old man in the light of the fire, his counsellors
  drove her away; and she knew that her end was near.</p>

  <p>In the dark of the night she took a canoe, and paddled down the swift
  stream. Near to the gorge, where the waters run with such force that no
  paddler dare go farther, she came to land, and went on foot towards the high
  hills which in the cold months are powdered with white dust. Beyond these lay
  a land ruled by a King whose son was tall, and was kind to women..</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"The first of next month, dear old officer," said Bones,
  with an air of unconcern, "is my birthday."</p>

  <p>"Let us keep to the more important matter of pants," said Captain Hamilton
  coldly.</p>

  <p>They sat in the sweltering clothes store; ranged on long benches were
  piles of garments designed for issue. There were shirts&mdash;khaki, and
  shorts&mdash;drill, boots&mdash;tropical, puttees&mdash;service; all the
  sartorial paraphernalia of the strenuous military life.</p>

  <p>Bones sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"Why not, dear old Ham, send back to G.H.Q. and say you found 'em?" he
  suggested hopefully. "After all, dear old Ham, if we say we've got sixty-nine
  pairs of pants and that perfectly ghastly quartermaster says that we've only
  got forty-nine, aught there not, as it were, dear old officer, to be
  rejoicing at headquarters? Now if I was at headquarters, and I found that
  somebody had got twenty-nine pants more than they ought to have, I'd send a
  wire saying 'Get on with the good work, old thing&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"But, you poor, addle-pated greyhound, we haven't got any surplus pants at
  all. We've got just the number we should have. The return you made was as
  wrong as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hamilton was weary and impatient.</p>

  <p>"In that case," demanded the exasperated Bones, "what's all the bother
  about, dear old thing? Simply send the old josser a note saying 'Dear Sir: Re
  yours of even date, pants found, all is well. Love to auntie, kiss baby,
  Bill."</p>

  <p>Hamilton sat down in a hard chair and mopped his streaming forehead.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind going away and drowning yourself?" he asked&mdash;gently, for
  him.</p>

  <p>"O Abiboo "&mdash;Captain Hamilton called the sergeant of Houssas waiting
  outside the hut&mdash;"bring all the books to my room."</p>

  <p>Bones had a brilliant inspiration.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Ham," he said eagerly, "I've got it! All these pants are in
  pairs, dear old thing. Do you think the naughty old quartermaster is
  reckoning two to a pair? How's that?"</p>

  <p>"Get out!"</p>

  <p>It was in the very dark hours of a sweltering morning that, poring over
  Bones' illegible returns he found the error. Bones in some mysterious fashion
  had added the sizes of military pants to the quantities.</p>

  <p>Though the next day was not Bones' birthday, he came to breakfast to find
  a stale gingerbread cake which had been sent some six months before by a
  misguided relative, and on it were seven large tallow candles, all burning
  offensively at various angles.</p>

  <p>"I'm taking time by the forelock," said Hamilton. "The candles are not for
  your years, but for your mentality."</p>

  <p>Bones, with great dignity, lifted the cake, carried it to the door and
  kicked it into the parade ground.</p>

  <p>He was very silent that day, and in the evening, as they sat in the cool
  of the verandah, drinking coffee that refused to get cool, he revealed his
  startling resolve.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to turn over a new leaf, dear old Ham. My youth is passed, dear
  old boy. I am a man, Ham. As Shakespeare so dinkily puts it, life's a dashed
  serious thing. No more giddy frivolity, dear old captain. Do you agree with
  me, Excellency?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Mr. Commissioner Sanders, who was thinking of something
  else.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to burn the banjulele and take a course in bookkeeping. There's
  a fellow advertising in one of those magazines who teaches the whole beastly
  business in thirteen lessons."</p>

  <p>"An unlucky number for you," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Nothing but duty from now on, old friend," said Bones firmly. "I've got
  the thing completely settled in my mind: seven to eight, Swedish exercises,
  dear old boy; eight to nine, study of military law; nine to eleven,
  bookkeeping; eleven to one, military duties as per schedule; one hour for
  lunch, or perhaps a little less; two to four, strategy and tactics; four to
  four-thirty, a simple cup of tea, dear old boy, and maybe a thin slice of
  bread and butter; four-thirty to seven, a little biology, or maybe zoology;
  bed at eight."</p>

  <p>"If you would spend a couple of hours a day learning to write so that
  intelligent people could read your infernal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Catagraphy?" suggested Bones helpfully. "That means getting up two hours
  earlier, but I'll do it, Ham&mdash;for your sake, sweetheart." He dodged the
  book that Hamilton hurled at him.</p>

  <p>For two days Bones kept to some kind of programme. He was certainly
  invisible between two in the afternoon and five. He was also invisible most
  of the other hours of the day when Hamilton wanted him. But, curiously
  enough, he remained very serious, and when Hamilton found him voluntarily
  instructing a squad in the art of bayonet fighting, it did seem that the new
  leaf was well and truly turned. But, as Hamilton said, Bones lived a lifetime
  every three days, and you never quite knew what the next day would bring.</p>

  <p>Bones smiled archly when he heard this.</p>

  <p>"What will my birthday bring, dear old Ham? I saw a little parcel that
  came from H.Q. yesterday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That was a bottle of tasteless castor oil," said Hamilton coldly. "You
  may have a half, but I never intended it as a present."</p>

  <p>Sanders chuckled.</p>

  <p>"If you had given me good notice, Bones, I'd have got something from
  London&mdash;a box of chocolates&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or a box of bricks&mdash;or better still, a ready reckoner."</p>

  <p>But Bones was not perturbed.</p>

  <p>"I've got a ready reckoner, old Ham, but I want another&mdash;mine is last
  year's. Now, if anybody wants to buy me a present I'll tell you what I'd
  like. Braces, dear old Ham, or a pair of jolly little links&mdash;crystal and
  diamonds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Even as Bones was speaking, a present was on its way.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">M'suru-b'langa, the warrior of the old king who lives beyond
  the Ghost Mountains, came down into the Ochori country with twenty huntsmen,
  for they were on the trail of the woman D'mini, and in any case were
  contemptuous of boundaries. And so trespassing in forbidden lands, they came
  upon another hunting party under Bosambo, paramount chief of the Ochori, by
  courtesy called "king."</p>

  <p>The parties met in the forest, and Bosambo, a stickler for the law when it
  was on his side, stared at the strange men.</p>

  <p>"O Bosambo, I see you," said M'suru, with the cool familiarity of an
  equal. "Have you and your young men seen a woman pass this way?"</p>

  <p>"Whose dog are you?" asked Bosambo politely.</p>

  <p>M'suru stiffened. "I am M'suru who stands next to the great king," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Bosambo could be heavily sarcastic. He was all that now.</p>

  <p>"O ko! And now you stand next to the king of the Ochori, M'suru, and only
  my guard speak to me with spears in their hands."</p>

  <p>M'suru hesitated. Here was a famous breaker of necks, if stories were
  true; one without fear or thought of kings or ghosts or devils. A broad,
  immense man without fat.</p>

  <p>He dropped his killing spears at his feet, and his men followed his
  example.</p>

  <p>"Now you shall tell me, M'suru, why you are in my fine land with spears,
  so that I may make a book for Sandi my master. Sit."</p>

  <p>M'suru squatted on the ground, trembling with rage, for only the king in
  his own land could say "sit" or "stand," and he was a proud man.</p>

  <p>"This woman D'mini has spoken against the king because he gave her brother
  to the skins. Also she is a witch. For when she dances, all men must dance.
  Therefore, I come to take her back to the master so that she may die."</p>

  <p>Bosambo looked at the speaker for a long time before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"If you kill all women who make men dance, then the world will die, for
  there will be no woman left alive," he said dryly. "Go back to your land,
  M'suru, for this is the land of my king, who does not kill women nor sew men
  into sacks. This palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>M's rose and gathered up his spears.</p>

  <p>"This I will do, Bosambo."</p>

  <p>His voice was almost humble, his manner was surprisingly deferential.
  Bosambo, who was not unimpressed by sudden humility, lifted his shield to the
  level of his chin.</p>

  <p>The man turned in his tracks, and, in accordance with custom, Bosambo
  turned too, for the immemorial law is that enemies or potential enemies, who
  are parting in friendship, turn back to back.</p>

  <p>"Watch!"</p>

  <p>The voice, thin and shrill with fear, came from a reedy patch of coarse
  grass. He turned swiftly, saw the spear leave M'suru's hand, and caught it on
  the boss of his shield. Then, as the stranger turned to fly, Bosambo's
  shoulder went backward and forward...The spear caught M'suru between spine
  and armpit, and he died instantly.</p>

  <p>"Follow," said Bosambo to his men, as M'suru's hunters vanished.</p>

  <p>Then he went back to the reeds. "Come to me, woman," he said, and the
  grass shook and heaved, and into his sight came D'mini, the woman.</p>

  <p>She was very slim and gracefully made, as he could see, for she wore
  neither cloth nor girdle. She had the thin nose of the Arab people, and her
  hair was straight and long. She looked at him with big eyes, and did not seem
  afraid.</p>

  <p>"I am D'mini, of the Great People," she said; "and I seek the tall son of
  your King, who is kind to women; him they call Tibbetti."</p>

  <p>Bosambo stared at her in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"O woman, he is not for you; but I will send a book of your words to
  Sandi, so that he shall know what to do for you. Afterwards I will send you
  in a canoe to him for judgment."</p>

  <p>When his men returned from their chase with only one bloody spear to show,
  he went back to the Ochori village he had left that morning, and sent a swift
  runner to the Ochori city, carrying a tiny cigarette-paper on which he had
  scrawled his tidings. And the pigeon who carried this came perilously to
  headquarters with a hawk on his tail.</p>

  <p>Sanders was dozing in a chair when the news arrived. Pigeons were frequent
  visitors&mdash;not often did they bring news of high political doings, but
  this once the message that the little messenger brought was sufficient to set
  the bugles blowing, for Sanders knew the methods of the old king who lived
  beyond the Ghost Mountains.</p>

  <p>He had no blame for Bosambo. The customs of the land were well defined. He
  did not doubt that the Ochori chief had struck in self-defence&mdash;but the
  old king was a foreigner, and war with him meant complications in half a
  dozen European capitals. And war was inevitable, for this man who had been
  old since the beginning of the world (according to the river legend) was the
  head and commander of a highly organized fighting force.</p>

  <p>"Condemn all women who make wars!" he said cold-bloodedly. "Send word to
  Bosambo to meet Bones at the joining of the rivers, and to bring the woman
  with him."</p>

  <p>"How much trouble is there going to be?" asked Captain Hamilton of the
  Houssas.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand rounds of small arms and two hundred shrapnel," said
  practically. "Let us be on the safe side. Bones can go first on the
  <i>Wiggle</i>. We will follow him as a reserve. If we make too big a show we
  shall flatter the old devil."</p>

  <p>Bones was indulging in his afternoon studies, oblivious to bugles and war,
  for he had eaten Yorkshire pudding for lunch, and in the coldest of climates
  York shire pudding is a deadly soporific.</p>

  <p>Hamilton found him lying uncovered on his bed, a mosquito gauze over his
  bare feet. His purple pyjamas were striped with pale lemon zigzags
  &mdash;Hamilton clutched the doorpost for support.</p>

  <p>"Arise, and gird your lions&mdash;Venus," he snarled.</p>

  <p>Bones blinked himself awake.</p>

  <p>"All correct, sir," he said hoarsely, as he brought his large feet to the
  floor. "Thinking, old boy&mdash;not asleep, just thinking, old Excellency.
  What's the morning like?"</p>

  <p>"Very much like the afternoon," said Hamilton. "The chief wants you."</p>

  <p>The dazed Bones groped for his mosquito boots.</p>

  <p>"By gosh, he shall have me, old sir," he said firmly. "As jolly old
  Browning says&mdash;we've only got to die once. Personally speakin', that
  never cheered me up. If you died more than once you'd get used to it, old
  Ham. Do you see my meanin'? That's philosophy."</p>

  <p>He changed his mind about his boots, grabbed an armful of flimsy wear and
  vanished behind a curtain. Hamilton heard the splash of water and sundry
  gasps. A few minutes later Bones, lightly attired in his underwear,
  appeared.</p>

  <p>"Horrible," said Hamilton. "Your mother should have done something about
  those knees of yours."</p>

  <p>Against Sanders and his administration the old king's heart was very sour.
  There had already been two encounters, one which might have ended in the
  destruction of the old man's deadly regime but for the interest which
  European Powers had in this No Man's Land which was claimed by every man. He
  had grown in strength and in arrogance, so that once when Sanders had asked
  for a palaver to deal with certain outstanding matters, he could afford to
  reply tardily and with insolence.</p>

  <p>When the news came to him of M'suru's death he lost little time. Within
  forty-eight hours his war-drums had summoned two fighting regiments and they
  were on their way to the pass, the one practicable track which crosses the
  Ghost Mountains.</p>

  <p>His task was not a simple one. The Northern Ochori were normally
  antagonistic to their chief, and friendly to the old king. There was a
  certain amount of intercourse and trading between the two tribes, and they
  must not be antagonized, since an unfriendly nation, however weak, holding
  one end of the pass, would be an everlasting danger to the arrogant old man.
  So that a march through the Ochori country was impossible because there was
  no line of demarcation between the friendly and the unfriendly section of the
  population. His regiments could march laterally along the western foot-hills
  and the mountains until they came to the river. This they did, their canoes
  being floated down to them through that impossible channel whose current was
  so strong that no canoe had ever passed up what was literally a watery
  slope.</p>

  <p>The first regiment had not crossed the pass before Bosambo heard. His
  rendezvous with Bones was three hours' journey by river, and he was waiting
  at the junction of the streams when the little <i>Wiggle</i> came painfully
  round the bluff.</p>

  <p>"Lord, there is trouble here," said the chief, "and all because of this
  woman, who is, as I think, no better than she should he."</p>

  <p>He had brought the girl aboard, and she stood aloof from the suspicious
  guards that surrounded her, a dainty figure of a girl, watching the tall
  young man interestedly. For the moment, Bones gave her little attention. Most
  wars began this way, and the woman in the case was as a rule most
  uninteresting.</p>

  <p>When Bones sat down to an examination on tactics and strategy under the
  disapproving eyes of his superior, his papers were usually well under the
  figure at which a studious young officer can pass. But Bones in theory and
  Bones in practice were two entirely different individuals. He gave his
  instructions briefly, and Bosambo, well acquainted with the Tibbetti of
  action, listened and noted. So many men were to go across the river to hold
  that point where the stream narrows; so many old canoes were to be chained
  prow to stern across the river itself; this Ochori regiment with a
  machine-gun detachment of Houssas was to occupy the rising ground at the only
  place where the old king's forces could land.</p>

  <p>Now the man who commanded the forces was the Chief Mofolobo, the old
  king's hunter, a very cunning man who had in mind his master's last
  instructions.</p>

  <p>"Eat up the Ochori and bring back the woman D'mini before Sandi and his
  soldiers come. But if there are soldiers of Sandi you shall not fight them,
  but by cunning steal the woman and secretly slay the leader of the white men,
  so that the heart of the soldiers shall be like wind on the waters of the
  river. Do this and let no man know that the king of the Great People
  struck."</p>

  <p>When Mofolobo's scouts came at night to the chained canoes, and they took
  back word to him, he knew that the white man and his soldiers had arrived. He
  drew back his canoes and sent only one to make a portage beyond the barrier
  of boats, and that canoe was filled with terrible men.</p>

  <p>Bones had time to see the cause of the threatened war that night
  &mdash;she had not ceased to look at him when he was in sight. And now she
  sat before him, rapt, hypnotized by his splendour.</p>

  <p>"O D'mini," he said, "there will be a great war because of you, and I
  think many men will die."</p>

  <p>She nodded her dissent.</p>

  <p>"Lord, that will not be, for often I have heard the old king say that he
  would not send his regiments against Sandi your King because of all the
  trouble that came to him cala cala. Also, lord, I know the heart of M'suru."
  She shivered. "He stood next to the king." Bones was looking at her
  interestedly. He had seen her type before&mdash;a throw-back to an old Arab
  ancestry.</p>

  <p>"What will I do with you, D'mini?" he asked. "For you are not of any
  people."</p>

  <p>She was breathing quickly, her great brown eyes fixed on his.</p>

  <p>"Lord, let me be your servant, and I will work for you and tend your
  garden..."</p>

  <p>Bones shook his head with a fearful grin which she thought was very
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Of that we shall speak to-morrow," he said, and replied to her other
  offer with greater emphasis.</p>

  <p>Before the sun set he went to inspect his sentries, and found that Bosambo
  had anticipated him.</p>

  <p>"Master," said the chief, "it has come to me that the old king will not
  fight you because you are white, but he will try to carry by cunning what he
  cannot do by battle. Bring your ship nearer to the bank, where my soldiers
  are sleeping, and no harm shall come to you."</p>

  <p>But here Bones returned a definite negative. Bosambo's troops were
  encamped at a place where the current had scooped out the shore into a little
  bay, and he had no desire to be caught at any point where he had not a field
  of fire in three directions. He brought the <i>Wiggle</i> to one of the
  promontories, moored her with long hawsers, and before he went to bed that
  night set his guards at certain vital points.</p>

  <p>"Where is the woman D'mini?" he asked Abiboo, never dreaming that she was
  not ashore.</p>

  <p>"Lord, she sits by your door and will not move." And there Bones found
  her; nor could she be persuaded either to go ashore or to find another
  sleeping place. He would have insisted, but she gave him a perfectly natural
  reason why she should remain close to one in authority, and he went into his
  cabin and had no sooner closed the door when he felt the pressure of her
  resting back against it.</p>

  <p>"Deuced awkward!" said Bones.</p>

  <p>He laid his two automatics on a small table by the side of his bed,
  stretched himself on the mattress and in a few minutes was asleep. No noise
  disturbed him, and the lightest sound would have brought him awake. Not even
  the posted sentries heard or saw the canoe that came upstream in the shadow
  of the bank.</p>

  <p>"The woman I cannot get," said Mofolobo to his confidant, "but the young
  man with the shining eye sleeps in the middle of his big canoe."</p>

  <p>Bones slept on peacefully. There must have been some slight sound, because
  he began to dream. It was his birthday... he was dimly conscious of the fact,
  even in his sleep. And there was a great party at headquarters, and everybody
  brought presents&mdash;all sorts of improbable people... the old vicar he
  knew in Guildford, and his housemaster, and that ghastly drill instructor at
  Sandhurst. They were all seated round the table, and before each was a
  priceless gift... diamonds.</p>

  <p>"I don't care for diamonds, dear old thing," murmured Bones, and sat
  up.</p>

  <p>He had heard nothing consciously, but the under-mind of him had made a
  deep record, and he was instantly awake. He moved stealthily to the door,
  pistol in hand. He heard a shot, and another, and the swift "swish" of
  paddles. "Tried to bring me a birthday present!" said Bones, and flung open
  the door.</p>

  <p>Something fell against his leg and pushed him back. He switched on the
  light, and looked down into the dead eyes of D'mini, the dancer, who had
  given him life.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">M'GALA THE ACCURST</a></h2>

  <h3>Reprinted in <i>Adventure</i>, August 15, 1929</h3>

  <p class="first">ONCE upon a time a Secretary of State for the Colonies (as
  he was then styled) invented a new office, and filled it instantly with a
  relative of his. This new official was styled Inspector of Native Territories
  and protectorates. Later the rank was changed to Inspector-General, but the
  salary remained the same, 1,500 a year and generous allowances.</p>

  <p>There had been successive Inspector-Generals, energetic ones, easy-going
  ones who spent most of their time on leave, but there had never been a really
  nasty Inspector-General till Major Commander Banks was appointed. He was a
  terribly hasty man, who stood six foot three in his stockings, a
  broad-shouldered, fair-haired, handsome, god-like creature, if one could
  imagine a god that had run slightly to fat.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew very much about him except that he was well off, had been an
  officer in the army, and that he had married four times. The heavy mortality
  among his wives was understood by those who had the misfortune to be brought
  into touch with him. He was a carping bully. His attitude at best was one of
  conscious condescension. He seemed to find a delight in bringing misery to
  all who for their sins came under his dominion.</p>

  <p>He broke two Commissioners and an Inspector of Police in the first year of
  his service. He drove into retirement the best administrator the territories
  had ever had. He so tortured an aged and inefficient pay master over his
  accounts that one morning he was found dead with a revolver by his side. His
  manners were poisonous; he was hated through fifteen degrees of latitude; and
  when news came to Sanders that, for the first time in his three years' tour
  of office, Major Commeder Banks was paying a visit to the River, the faces of
  his two subordinates fell, for the Inspector-General had a military as well
  as a civil jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>"To-night we start on those company and store accounts, Bones," said
  Hamilton seriously. "I'll help you, and the Commissioner will lend you his
  clerk."</p>

  <p>"Leave it to Bones," said Lieutenant Tibbetts, but half-heartedly. "This
  naughty old Banks won't rattle me, dear old Ham."</p>

  <p>"He won't rattle you, he'll murder you," said Hamilton shortly.</p>

  <p>Through the hot night he and Bones pored over a smudged and often
  corrected ledger.</p>

  <p>"What's this two pounds four and six?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Two pounds four and six," said Bones promptly.</p>

  <p>Hamilton groaned. Again his quick pen went up and down the column, and
  again the total was wrong.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it's twenty-four and six?" suggested Bones helpfully.</p>

  <p>It was. Hamilton made the correction... five minutes later found another
  error. The ledger was a sad sight when they had finished with it.</p>

  <p>"The only thing to do is to start a fresh book, get a couple of clerks
  working day and night, and by the time his nibs arrives we'll have everything
  ship shape."</p>

  <p>But his nibs came a day too soon. Commeder Banks was, curiously enough,
  for a man who elected to live on the Coast, a very rich man. He had a small
  steam yacht which had been worked out to the Coast, and it was his joy to
  pounce on a Tuesday upon a shivering community that had not expected him
  until Friday.</p>

  <p>He came blustering up to the residency, and with him a slim, pale,
  frightened girl.</p>

  <p>"You're Hamilton, eh?" he boomed, and shook the offered hand limply. "And
  you're Tibbetts?"</p>

  <p>"Glad to meet you, dear old Inspector," said Bones, "and your charming
  daughter, dear old sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Banks' face went, as black as thunder.</p>

  <p>"My wife," he snapped. "And what do you mean, sir, by calling me 'dear old
  Inspector?' Discipline is slack here, Sanders, very slack."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sanders," said Sanders quietly.</p>

  <p>For a second their eyes met, the steel and the faded blue, and for once in
  his life Major Banks was uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Emmie, you know these people?" he said to the nervous girl. "Mr. Sanders,
  Tibbetts, Hamilton." He introduced them with a sweep of his hand and walked
  in front of Sanders into the residency.</p>

  <p>Lunch was a trial for everybody except Major Banks. He talked incessantly
  to everybody except Bones. Evidently that young man had offended him beyond
  hope of pardon, and it made matters no easier that Bones devoted his marked
  attention to Mrs. Banks. But that was because Bones' attentions were
  invariably well marked.</p>

  <p>She was very pretty in a scared way. Sanders judged her to be in the
  region of twenty-four&mdash;she was, in fact, two years younger, and had
  married her present husband when she was seventeen.</p>

  <p>"What you ought to see, dear old Mrs. Banks, is the N'gombi
  territory&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't call my wife 'dear old Mrs. Banks!'" bellowed the Major, red in the
  face; and then he glared at his wife. "The key, my dear!"</p>

  <p>He fumbled in his pocket, produced a small Yale key, and Sanders' saw the
  girl shrink back as though she had been struck. The Inspector-General roared
  with laughter.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you don't know what that means, my dear fellow? Do you think I
  lock her up when she's naughty? Not a bit of it. She knows&mdash;ask
  her!"</p>

  <p>There was a most tense and uncomfortable moment. Sanders moved uneasily in
  his chair. The big man waved his finger playfully at his wife.</p>

  <p>"No flirtations, Emmie darling! No more Freddies!"</p>

  <p>"I never gave him the key, James," she quavered. "You know it's not
  true."</p>

  <p>He silenced her with a gesture. That was all the reference that was made
  to the mysterious key and the incident in the past which he held over her
  head like a whip. But it was characteristic of him that, whatever the key
  signified, he carried it with him day and night, and would produce it before
  strangers to humiliate her.</p>

  <p>He spent the afternoon examining reports in Sanders' office. They were
  mainly written in Sanders' own neat hand and he read them through word by
  word, checking certain tables showing taxation with a little book that he had
  brought with him.</p>

  <p>"What is this, Sanders?" he said suddenly. "This doesn't seem right. The
  N'gombi paid twenty-eight thousand kilos of rubber&mdash;you show
  thirteen."</p>

  <p>"That is the Lower N'gombi," said Sanders coldly. "You will find the Upper
  N'gombi produced fifteen."</p>

  <p>The Major shook his head. "Not very much for a big territory, you know,
  Mr. Sanders," he said disparagingly. "You ought to get twice as much."</p>

  <p>"That is a matter for you to discuss with the Government," said Sanders,
  in his iciest tone. "I am only authorized to collect twenty-eight thousand. I
  will note your strictures and report them to Whitehall."</p>

  <p>"I'm passing no strictures," said the Major hastily.</p>

  <p>He had been warned against Sanders; knew that the Commissioner had many
  influential friends at home. He made no further comment, but it was not
  difficult to see that he had passed on some of the dislike he felt for Bones
  to the Commissioner.</p>

  <p>At dinner that night he was insufferable. He bullied his wife,
  contradicted Sanders, silenced Hamilton, and would have done the same to
  Bones, but Bones was a very difficult man to suppress.</p>

  <p>"These territories should be reorganized. They're run in the most
  haphazard fashion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not at all, dear old Inspector," said Bones blandly. "That's where you're
  wrong, that's where you're quite wrong, my dear old sir."</p>

  <p>The Major glared at him. Bones was unabashed. "Is it usual for a subaltern
  officer to give the lie&mdash;I repeat, give the lie&mdash;to a high official
  of state?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite wrong, dear old Inspector, and I'm glad you know it! I couldn't
  help thinking, when you were contradicting dear old Excellency just now, what
  perfectly ghastly bad form it was."</p>

  <p>The Major spluttered and was silent. Hamilton quaked for his subaltern. He
  quaked a little more when Bones told a story to the girl who was sitting by
  his side&mdash;a story that brought a smile to her pale face.</p>

  <p>"Emmie, my dear." The Inspector-General's voice was silky, but in his hand
  he held the key. "Don't forget, my dear."</p>

  <p>He turned his head by accident at that moment, and caught Sanders' eye,
  and he saw there something so murderous that he was for the moment
  startled.</p>

  <p>It was an unnerving evening. Sanders was glad when his visitors had
  retired to his own room, which he had placed at their disposal. The real
  tragedy began next morning.</p>

  <p>"I want every account book brought to this office," said the Major. "I
  want no explanations and no assistance. I am perhaps as good an auditor as
  the next man, Sanders&mdash;Mr. Sanders. What I should like, if it is
  possible, is for you to send away the gentleman who is affected&mdash;you
  were saying last night that you were due at a sort of palaver up the river.
  Perhaps you could take Mr. Tibbetts with you..."</p>

  <p>"How long will your audit take?" asked Sanders, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"A week," said the other. "I want every voucher checked, and I'll check
  them myself. I don't wish to make charges against anybody, but my experience
  is that there's a deplorable amount of petty peculation going on
  unchecked."</p>

  <p>"Are you suggesting that I am guilty of peculation?" asked Hamilton, who
  was present.</p>

  <p>"Don't snap at me, sir," said the Major testily. "You have clerks, have
  you not? What is most likely to have happened is that, owing to a lack of
  efficient supervision, there may have been irregularities. I'll say no more
  than that."</p>

  <p>Sanders was due at an important palaver; but, important as it was, it
  could have been postponed but for the Inspector-General's suggestion. He
  expressed his intention of leaving early the next morning, and that day was
  occupied in the collection of odd documents (many of which Bones found at the
  bottom of his trunks, and stored in odd crannies of his hut) and their
  arrangement in chronological order.</p>

  <p>The Inspector-General was more amiable that night: told Sanders something
  about his wealth. He had large interests in oil fields in America, from which
  the bulk of his income was drawn. He had the finest house in Sussex&mdash;a
  show place, at which, to use his own words, "royalty had stayed."</p>

  <p>The man was an arrant and vulgar snob. He made no disguise that he loathed
  Bones; never referred to him except as "that pup." He "travelled" a native
  clerk. Evidently from this man he had learned of the difficulties which the
  two sweating young officers had experienced in collecting their accounts
  together, and he gloated over their coming discomfiture.</p>

  <p>Sanders welcomed the dawn that sent him, with Bones and half a dozen
  Houssas, to the <i>Zaire</i> and the clean morning air of the river.</p>

  <p>At the appointed place he had an important territorial question to debate
  with five petty chiefs. He had also the problem of M'gala to settle; and,
  though he was not aware of it, this was the most important palaver of all.
  There was a man of the Lower N'gombi whom nobody loved. Nor was it to be
  expected that any man should speak well of him or any woman look on him with
  a kind light in her eyes. For he was accurst from his birth by certain ghosts
  and devils, none of which was of itself of any great potency, though in the
  aggregate they had great power.</p>

  <p>On the night M'gala came squalling into the world the witch doctor Tiki
  M'simba saw each and every devil creep into the mother's hut, and they did
  not come out again. There was a sceptical man once who pointed out the
  indisputable fact that Tiki M'simba had quarrelled with M'gala's father over
  a question of salt; but whether vengeance or clairvoyance was at the back of
  the doctor's vision, all the people of the Lower N'gombi accepted M'gala's
  misfortune. His mother hated him; his father, when he was still in the
  sprawling stage, left him on a sand spit, where crocodiles come in the heat
  of the day to bask.</p>

  <p>The first crocodile and Mr. Commissioner Sanders appeared simultaneously.
  The rifle of Lieutenant Tibbetts deprived the crocodile of any interest in
  his projected meal, and Sanders brought the little black satiny thing aboard
  the <i>Zaire</i>, and held a palaver in the nearest village to discover its
  paternity. This discovery was simply made. M'gala's father came up for
  judgment.</p>

  <p>"Lord, this child is full of devils," said that simple man, and related
  the circumstance of M' gala's birth.</p>

  <p>It took an hour to tell, but the Commissioner was very patient.</p>

  <p>"Bring me Tiki M'simba," he said at last, and the witch doctor came
  reluctantly. "O man," said Sanders, in his gentle way, which invariably
  heralded ungentle action, "you may see ghosts and devils and wonderful
  ju-jus, but none of these must do harm to any living man or woman."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Tiki M'simba, deceived by Sanders' courteous tone, "I see
  what I see."</p>

  <p>"Also you shall feel what you feel," said Sanders. They tied M'simba to a
  tree, and Abiboo, a sergeant of Houssas, whose right arm was diabolically
  strong, gave him twenty on the back for the good of his soul.</p>

  <p>Little M'gala grew up, therefore, in an atmosphere of hostility. He never
  met M'simba in the village street but that seer did not fix him with a glare
  that terrified him. Little boys and girls, who played the queer games which
  little boys and girls play wherever they live, ostracized him. His father
  built him a small hut, which was the size of a dog kennel, and there he slept
  and had his meals. For very soon it was learned by ocular demonstration that
  M'gala brought bad luck.</p>

  <p>If he looked at a goat for a long time, that goat died; if he stopped
  before a house to peer wistfully into its dark interior, some man or woman or
  child grew sick; if he spoke to any, they suffered pain. Once he watched a
  party of woodmen felling a tree. As he looked, the tree unexpectedly fell and
  killed two of them. The fishermen would not let him go on the river because
  he frightened the fish away.</p>

  <p>He grew to youth, herring-ribbed, lank, silent, and, in his not unpleasant
  face, a curious intellectuality such as is not seen in native people. Nobody
  hindered him, for fear of Sanders. It was rumoured that neither poison nor
  axe could destroy him. Once, when he was fifteen, the exasperated elders of
  the village, stimulated by M'simba, hired a band of outcast people who lived
  on the edge of the N'gombi forest to carry him away, and do what they would.
  Four men went in search of him one day, when he was hunting in the forest.
  They were never again seen alive; their bodies, mangled by leopards, were
  found, but no leopards were seen, nor had any hunter found the spoor of
  one.</p>

  <p>He built himself a hut away from his people and at the back of the
  settlement; and every day he came through the village, looking neither to the
  left nor to the right. Once he trod upon thorns, maliciously disposed in the
  path. He leaned against a hut while he cleared his feet of the thorns. A few
  paces further he was again wounded, and again he leaned on a hut while he
  pulled the thorns free. That night those two huts were destroyed by fire, and
  nearly the whole of the village.</p>

  <p>Tiki M'simba called a secret council of the oldest men, including the
  petty chief who was his creature.</p>

  <p>"Sandi is now at the Rivers-meeting. One of us will go to him and tell him
  of all these terrible things. And we will ask him to take M'gala away,
  because of these happenings."</p>

  <p>They chose a man whom Sanders liked, and he came to the junction of the
  rivers where the <i>Zaire</i> was moored, and in the evening Sanders gave him
  an audience and listened patiently to his complaint.</p>

  <p>Now, Sanders treated all such matters as these with the greatest
  seriousness, for he knew how largely big events are determined by small
  causes, and so he did not grow impatient at talks of devils and ghosts, but
  considered them most profoundly, and even consulted Bones, who, always
  assumed the gravity of a privy councillor deciding the issue of peace and war
  on such occasions.</p>

  <p>"Very remarkable, dear old Excellency," he said, "but I have had cases
  similar. The superstition of the indigenous native are remarkable. What about
  me going along and having a little chow about the law of averages? I could
  show these silly old blighters&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think they want lecturing, they want relief. I will send for
  M'gala and take him to headquarters. He seems a very intelligent man, and I
  want a house boy."</p>

  <p>"Lord," warned the messenger, "this man brings evil to all that he
  touches. Also he has threatened death to any who beat him. For no hand has
  been raised against him by your lordship's orders, also&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"O ko!" said Sanders impatiently. "Let me see this wonder. A little
  beating does no man harm."</p>

  <p>He was thinking at that moment of a certain Inspector-General.</p>

  <p>M'gala left his village, and nobody came down to see him off, for fear of
  what might happen to those who watched his departure. It is a fact that he
  was hardly out of sight before three fat dogs, the property of Tiki M'simba,
  dropped dead for no reason what ever except perhaps heart disease engendered
  by overfeeding.</p>

  <p>On its arrival Hamilton met the <i>Zaire</i> with a long face.</p>

  <p>"There's the devil to pay," he said. "That swine has found both ledgers,
  and has openly accused me of doctoring the accounts. He says he'll break
  Bones, and is preparing a long report for Army Headquarters."</p>

  <p>"What is the trouble?"</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of Hamilton and the urgency of the crisis that he
  greeted Bones with a friendly smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid there's going to be hell, Bones," and told him what he had
  already told Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Everything can be explained, dear old thing," said Bones airily. "If
  there are a few pounds out, I'll pay them out of my own pocket."</p>

  <p>"To be exact," said Hamilton, "you're a hundred and sixty-three pounds
  out&mdash;I've never seen this brute so happy!"</p>

  <p>The Major was indeed in a jovial frame of mind at breakfast. He rubbed his
  hands gleefully at the sight of Bones, and that misguided youth so
  misunderstood his geniality that he committed the heinous offence of slapping
  him on the back.</p>

  <p>"Don't do that, sir, don't do it!" gasped Commeder Banks. "You are a fool,
  sir, and a criminal, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And a cat burglar, dear old inspector," chortled Bones. "What about our
  going fishing&mdash;you and me and dear old Emmie?"</p>

  <p>The girl cast an imploring look at him, but Bones was a notoriously bad
  reader of signs.</p>

  <p>It took Sanders and Hamilton nearly an hour to bring to the young man a
  realization of the gravity of his position.</p>

  <p>"Pull yourself together, Bones," said Hamilton gravely. "This may mean a
  court-martial. You remember he broke young Verney for exactly the same
  thing?"</p>

  <p>Bones' face dropped.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean he's serious, dear old boy? Why, I'm quite friendly with
  his wife!"</p>

  <p>Hamilton groaned.</p>

  <p>"You're not only friendly with his wife, but you've done every damned
  thing that you shouldn't do. He's after your blood and mine, too! He has been
  trying all the morning to get me to dissociate myself from you, and to swear
  that these accounts were entirely your affair."</p>

  <p>All that morning the Major worked at his report. Before lunch he came out
  on to the verandah, dropped into an easy chair, and ordered a drink.</p>

  <p>Sanders saw the new house boy come awkwardly on to the stoep, balancing a
  small tray and staring owlishly at the slopping glasses. He thought no more
  than that it was stupid of his cook to send this raw man; and then he heard a
  smack and saw M'gala go sprawling on to the floor, and the tinkle of breaking
  glass.</p>

  <p>"Awkward beast!" roared the Inspector. M'gala got up slowly. Never before
  had he been struck. His eyes were blazing and luminous. Then slowly he
  turned, and, walking down the steps, vanished round a corner of the building.
  The Inspector-General was wiping his trousers.</p>

  <p>"That's an awkward devil you've got," he snarled.</p>

  <p>"He's raw," said Sanders. "I only brought him down river this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"I should jolly well say he was raw. Do you know what the brute did? He
  put his hand on my shoulder to steady himself when he was handing me the
  glass."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Sanders blankly, and remembered the stories of M'gala that he
  had heard.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to break that boy of yours, I'm afraid," the Major went on
  to a more pleasant topic. "I don't know how far you're responsible, but that
  is for the administrator to decide. His accounts are in a shocking state;
  there's a hundred and sixty-three pounds unaccounted for&mdash;Emmie, come
  here."</p>

  <p>He called the girl sharply, and she sprang up from her chair, where she
  was sitting at the far end of the verandah, and almost ran to him. Sanders
  saw that she held something behind her.</p>

  <p>"What was that letter you were reading?" If it was possible, she turned
  even paler. "There wasn't a mail in this morning?" She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"One you're treasuring, eh? Let me see it." Even Sanders, sharp-eyed as he
  was, had not observed the girl's surreptitious reading.</p>

  <p>"Let me see it."</p>

  <p>Sanders saw the colour come into her face.</p>

  <p>"I won't," she said, defiantly. "It is from a friend."</p>

  <p>His lips curled in a grin.</p>

  <p>"From Freddie?" he breathed.</p>

  <p>"From Freddie," she said, and stood stiffly waiting for the storm.</p>

  <p>Again that grimace of his.</p>

  <p>"We'll talk about that after tiffin, shall we? Freddie&mdash;good
  God!"</p>

  <p>He fumbled in his pocket for the key. And then, to his amazement, she
  snatched it from his hand and threw it across the rail of the stoep.</p>

  <p>"You shan't do that, you shan't! Freddie means everything to me
  &mdash;everything! Now you know!"</p>

  <p>She turned quickly and ran into the house, and the Inspector-General sat
  paralysed with astonishment. Then he half rose from his seat, and fell back
  again.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he said, in an awed voice.</p>

  <p>Sanders knew that for the first time in his life a woman had challenged
  his domination. "That fellow Tibbetts... the man you call Bones... by God!
  He's been responsible... putting ideas into her damned head! What do you
  want?"</p>

  <p>It was his native clerk. A telegram had come through. He snatched it from
  the man's hand, tore it open, and, fixing his pince-nez, read. Sanders saw
  his mouth open wider and wider, and into his pale blue eyes came a look of
  horror and bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"What's this, what's this, what's this?" he muttered rapidly. "Hoax or
  something? Read that, Sanders&mdash;read it, my boy."</p>

  <p>His voice was tremulous. Sanders took the sheet and read.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"VERY URGENT. CALDER CABLES YOUR OIL SHARES DROPPED SEVEN
  DOLLARS FIFTY TO SEVENTY-FIVE CENTS. REPORTED WELLS RUN DRY. PANIC IN OIL
  MARKET. SHALL I SELL OR HOLD?"</p><br>

  <p>"All my money's in that!" wailed the man. "I'm ruined!"</p>

  <p>Sanders said nothing. He saw the man reach mechanically for his topee,
  stagger down the steps and, crossing the square, disappear behind the Houssa
  lines. He had not returned by four. Sanders had an idea, that he might have
  fallen into the river, and sent a search party for him.</p>

  <p>They found him lying face down in the long, rank grass, a revolver gripped
  in his hand, and, near by, the dead body of M'gala. Nobody had heard the shot
  that killed the unlucky man. The spear he had thrust at Banks' throat was
  noiseless.</p>

  <p>And that night, the white-faced wife sat in her bed room, trying not to be
  thankful that the hand of M'gala the accurst had fallen upon her husband's
  shoulder.</p>
