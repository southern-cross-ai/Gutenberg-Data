<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>

THE GENTLEMAN THUG</h2>

<p class="first">ONE beautiful morning in early June in the year
nineteen hundred and forty-eight a motorist was driving slowly
along a lonely and rough road that wound between the salt
marshes and the sea in the extreme north of the countryside of
Norfolk. With his gun handy upon the seat beside him, he was
hoping to get a shot at something, a duck, a teal, a snipe or
indeed any kind of bird which might fly up from the marshes as
he came by. His temperament was such that he would not mind if
it were out of season or not.</p>

<p>Smartly dressed, he was a handsome, even distinguished-looking
man. By name Leon Mangan, by occupation he was an art
dealer. He was returning to Town after a wasted and unprofitable
journey to look at some pictures belonging to a man who had
written giving an altogether misleading description of what he
had to sell. He had found the pictures not worth buying and in
consequence was in a bad temper at having been induced to travel
so far for nothing.</p>

<p>Some two miles beyond the little town of Wells-by-the-Sea,
meeting no one upon the way, he came in sight of a good-sized
bungalow that had only the road between it and the muddy
foreshore which, now at low water, stretched for a mile and more
uncovered by the sea.</p>

<p>In his preoccupation becoming only all at once aware that his
engine was running badly, he pulled up and alighted to see what
was causing the trouble. To his annoyance he found the water was
running low in his radiator. With a curse at his carelessness
he, however, congratulated himself that he was so near a
habitation that things could soon be put right.</p>

<p>Driving up to the bungalow, he alighted again and walked up
the short path of the little garden to the front door. Seeing no
bell, he knocked briskly with his knuckles but getting no answer
after a couple of minutes or so, he moved away to peer through
the nearest window, the blinds of which were not drawn, into
what was evidently the living-room. The bungalow was certainly
in use for upon the table he saw a dish of fruit with a large
pineapple in the centre. Also, upon the sideboard, were a
syphon, a spirit tantalus and some tumblers.</p>

<p>Proceeding round to the back of the bungalow, he came upon
the expected tank of rain-water, but to his disgust could find
no pail or other utensil with which to carry away the required
water to his radiator. Proceeding to investigate a small garage
at the far side of the little yard, he found the door was shut
and securely fastened with a good Yale lock. Peering through the
cracks of the door he saw the garage was empty.</p>

<p>With no luck at the back door, upon a scrutiny through a
window which was evidently that of the kitchen, he saw exactly
what he was looking for, a good-sized pail. Always of quick
decisions and with never any scruples where other people's
property was concerned, he decided instantly to avail himself of
its service.</p>

<p>Making his way back quickly to his car, he took a stout
screw-driver and a tyre-lever from his tool-box and then, for a
long minute, paused to take an intent look all round. Not a
human being was to be seen anywhere. In both directions the road
stretched empty and lonely along the shore and, with the tide
such a long way out, a wide and unbroken sliminess lay between
him and the sea. Behind the bungalow, the marsh lay desolate and
unpathed as far as the eye could see.</p>

<p>"Hell!" he exclaimed disgustedly. "In what a foul place for
anyone to have built a nice bungalow like this! The man who did
it must be half out of his mind."</p>

<p>Satisfied he was quite free from any interruption, he
returned again to the back of the bungalow and, with the aid of
his tools, very soon had the window open and was climbing into
the kitchen. His first intention had been only to get the water
he wanted, but, his curiosity being aroused by the up-to-date
appointments of the kitchen, he proceeded to go through the
other rooms of the bungalow. It was evident to him at once that
the owner must be a man of some means, as all the appointments
were comfortable and even luxurious; good carpets upon all the
floors, nothing cheap about any of the furniture, and the pieces
of plate upon the sideboard in the dining-room were of sterling
silver.</p>

<p>Pulling open the long drawer of the sideboard, he saw it was
well stocked with spoons and forks, also of sterling silver, and
his eyes sparkled and he drew in a deep breath as he realised in
a flash what an opportunity for good profit lay before him. Why
the stuff under his very eyes was worth a little mint of money
and it was all his for the taking! A nice haul of easily
negotiable articles!</p>

<p>There was no hesitation upon his part as to what he would do,
and, making his way through the back door, he darted outside to
have another searching look round.</p>

<p>No, as before, there was no sight of any human being and the
surroundings of the bungalow could not have been more desolate
than they were!</p>

<p>He proceeded to get into action at once.</p>

<p>First, to be all prepared, if need be, for a quick getaway he
filled his radiator. Then, going back into the dining-room he
helped himself to a generous four fingers of whisky. Its flavour
was so agreeable that he guessed it was pre-war spirit, and
concluded once again that the owner of the bungalow must be
well-to-do and in quite comfortable circumstances.</p>

<p>Next, not wasting any more time, he proceeded to gather
together upon the table the things he was intending to take
away, the two silver candlesticks, a dainty silver hot-water jug
of solid silver and all the plate he found in the long sideboard
drawer. His final acquisition was a massive silver snuff-box
which he found lying upon the desk. A good judge of all things
silver he knew at once that the snuff-box was of early Georgian
days, and he reckoned confidently that it would fetch as much as
a couple of hundred guineas in any good art saleroom. It was
beautifully chased and, for the moment, he was so engrossed in
admiring it that he did not hear soft tiptoeing footfalls in the
passage. Indeed, a few seconds later he sensed rather than saw a
movement by the door.</p>

<p>Turning as quickly as the strike of a snake, his disconcerted
gaze took in a small and red-headed elderly man, glaring at him
with blazing eyes and covering him with an upraised pistol.</p>

<p>"Up with your hands," shouted the small man furiously. "Up
with them like lightning, or I'll shoot you in the stomach. Up
with them, quick! My gun's loaded. Quick!"</p>

<p>Mangan's heart had almost stopped beating and his face gone
an ashen grey. Added to a realisation of his dreadful position
at being caught red-handed in an act of shameful theft had come
the almost stupefying feeling of amazement at recognising the
man who was now threatening him with his pistol. He was a
Professor Harleck Glenowen whom he had but recently met when
dining in the company of some aristocratic friends. That the
recognition, however, was not mutual he was quite sure, as they
had met only once and, also, his (Mangan's) motoring cap, as he
always wore it, was now pulled down well over his forehead, thus
obscuring a good part of his face.</p>

<p>The devil! In his tranquil moments, even, this professor of
most eccentric views had the reputation of being half mad, with
all his cleverness only in part responsible for his actions. So
now, in his present state of fury and excitement, if there was
the slightest hesitation in complying with his order he might
pull upon the trigger at once.</p>

<p>Cursing viciously under his breath, but rather than of all
things receive a bullet in his stomach&mdash;he had seen plenty
of such injuries in the Great War&mdash;Mangan's hands went up
instantly.</p>

<p>"Now turn and face the wall," was the next order given in a
snarling sternness, "and any tricks, mind you, and I'll put a
bullet in your spine." The professor stuttered in his rage. "You
damned thug, I'll be only too glad of the excuse."</p>

<p>A long minute's silence followed while the professor
recovered his breath. "Got a gun on you?" he asked hoarsely.
"But of course you have! Now you keep still. I'm going to search
you."</p>

<p>Mangan thought it wisest to continue to keep silent, and
breathing hard and pressing the muzzle of his pistol firmly
against the middle of his captive's back, the professor with his
disengaged hand proceeded methodically to go through every
pocket.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, the gun, as I expected!" he exclaimed gleefully as
he drew out a small automatic. "A modern highwayman, are you,
and up-to-date Charles Duval?" His voice rose in disgust. "And a
knuckle-duster, too! Then you're worse than a highwayman, you
are a murdering thug."</p>

<p>Coming upon the silver snuff-box in one of the side pockets
of Mangan's jacket, he gave him a couple of vicious kicks in the
legs. "You devil, and I so prized that, too!" He thrust his
pistol harder than ever into Mangan's back. "A bigger blackguard
even than you, my friend," he snarled, "has had his fingers in
that box, as it belonged once to that arch scoundrel,
Napoleon."</p>

<p>The search was soon over and, the contents of all Mangan's
pockets laid out upon the table, he was next ordered to drop one
hand at a time and unbutton his braces. "And you won't be able
to run far, will you, you blackguard thief," sneered the
professor, "with your trousers falling down? Now, I'll just put
the table between us and you shall turn round and take off your
cap, so that I can have a good look at you." He grinned
sardonically. "This is the first time that, to my knowledge, I
have had the experience of meeting a <i>bona-fide</i>
thief."</p>

<p>A few moments later and the two men stood face to face. It
might have been thought that the so smartly-dressed Mangan would
have appeared overwhelmed in shame, first at having been caught
red-handed as a thief, and now at being in the humiliating
position at having to hold up his trousers to keep them from
falling down his legs. On the contrary, however, his expression
was a cold and disdainful one, and it was with contempt rather
than anything else with which he regarded his captor. As for the
latter&mdash;a quick hard stare and his face was frozen into an
incredulous surprise.</p>

<p>For long moments neither of them spoke, and then the
professor gasped, "Major Mangan, the dashing D.S.O.! The man I
met at Blackarden Castle! The bosom friend of young Avon, Lord
Delamarne's heir! God, it can't be true!" His voice rose to a
shriek. "But it is, you gentlemanly blackguard, and so this is
how you make your living, is it? Oh, you common, vulgar
thief."</p>

<p>In his thirtieth year, Major Leon Sylvester Mangan, decorated
with the Distinguished Service Order and at one time attached to
a crack commando unit, was as gentlemanly a blackguard as it was
possible to meet. A product thrown up by the licence and
savagery of the second great war, he was without morals and with
no scruples whatsoever. A veritable bird of prey in the good
social world in which he moved, he was the more dangerous to the
community because of his pleasing appearance and charming
manners. Everyone always took to him at once. He was always well
dressed in excellent taste.</p>

<p>The only son of a country doctor he had been sent to good
schools and then on to Oxford University. To the great
disappointment of his father, after his two years' residence he
had come down without taking any degree. With an intelligence
much above the ordinary, he could easily have distinguished
himself had he so wished, but it was just that he seemed
interested in nothing but sport and gambling.</p>

<p>Early in his 'Varsity days he had become mixed up with a fast
sporting set of much greater means than his and, at once
realising that he would not be able to keep pace with them upon
the very moderate allowance he received from his father, he set
about increasing his income in the only way he knew of, and that
was his undoubted proficiency at cards.</p>

<p>He had always been good at all card games, but in his late
schooldays when playing "ha'penny nap" or indeed any game where
money was involved, because of his well-known cleverness at
sleight of hand, was never allowed to shuffle the pack or deal
the cards. He took it all in good part and considered it a great
joke, complaining, however, with a grin that it was not fair to
so cramp his style. Surely, he would argue humorously, he
deserved some reward for the amount of time he gave to the
practice of his speciality.</p>

<p>Going up to Oxford, he did not think it necessary to mention
this little hobby of his to any of his card-playing friends. He
must mind his step most carefully he told himself, as he was not
playing with schoolboys now! He smiled to himself&mdash;still it
might come in useful one day.</p>

<p>With the ideal temperament for a gambler, cool, collected and
never losing his head, he was soon recognised by his fellow
undergraduates as one of the best and most daring card players
among them. Indeed, at poker, his favourite game, after a thick
evening, particularly when the stakes had been high, it was good
odds upon his having come out a winner.</p>

<p>Giving frequent little parties at his rooms, with plenty of
drink always available, they were invariably well attended. As
time went on, however, though there was never any suspicion of
foul play against him, the opinion began gradually to be formed
that these evenings were in the way of being most expensive ones
for any but the most cautious and experienced players.</p>

<p>Something little short of a scandal occurred once when a
young freshman lost nearly £300, with most of it going to his
host. Still it was agreed by all who had been present then that
Mangan himself was in no way to blame, as he had repeatedly
warned the young fellow of his recklessness, and several times
had expressed the wish of withdrawing from any further play.</p>

<p>His years at the 'Varsity ended, he was such a long while
without attempting to settle down to any occupation that at last
he had exhausted both his father's patience and the money the
latter was prepared to spend upon him. After an angry quarrel
with the very disappointed doctor, he left the parental roof
with a final £20 in his pocket to make his way in life as best
he could.</p>

<p>Right from the very beginning intending to do no really hard
work, a worrying time followed for him, with his trying one
occupation after another with no success. Certainly his nice
manners and well-dressed appearance had landed for him
straightaway a position in a good-class book shop in the West
End, but he had only stuck to it for a few weeks and then with
no notice to his employer, had not turned up on the Monday
morning. After that he did a short time of assurance work, sold
books upon commission, worked as a clerk to a bookmaker and
finally was engaged in a little second-hand art and curiosity
shop in Wardour Street. He came to apply for the position there
upon seeing a card in the window notifying that a young man of
good address was wanted as an assistant and, as he had no
references to produce, was rather surprised at being taken on.
However, the proprietor, Marcus Wardale, an easy-going and
scholarly-looking man, appeared to be quite satisfied when
Mangan told him he had been an undergraduate at Oxford for two
years, and engaged him on the spot. The salary was only fifty
shillings a week, just enough for him to live in the poorest way
in the East End.</p>

<p>The work was very easy and consisted mainly in dusting the
old-looking furniture and odds and ends of miscellaneous
articles scattered untidily about the shop. Added to that,
Mangan was often left in charge to delay any customers who came
in from leaving before his employer returned from the many
little 'business matters' which were continually taking him off
for a few minutes during the day. Mangan, however, was soon of
the opinion these journeys necessitated him going no farther
than the nearest public-house, as he invariably smelt of spirits
when he returned.</p>

<p>Another thing Mangan soon learnt was that the business done
in the shop could not possibly be paying for the overhead
expenses and even the small salary he himself was receiving.
Very few customers came in, and often the day's takings could
not have amounted to more than a few shillings. Considering all
this, he suddenly realised the real money was being earned in
the little room at the back of the shop, and that sellers and
not buyers were the mainstay of his employer's business.</p>

<p>Almost everybody with anything to sell was taken into this
little room, the door was shut and sometimes it was many minutes
before the seller came out again. Also, he noticed that whatever
transactions had taken place there, very rarely was any new
article exposed in the shop for resale. Instead, his employer
would find it necessary to go out at once upon one of these
mysterious little business matters, though then he was absent
for much longer than it would take him to go to the public
house.</p>

<p>One afternoon after one of the proceedings, to his great
surprise Wardale presented him with a ten-shilling note, "See
here," he said with a knowing smile, "if you are ever asked any
questions about any of the customers who have dropped in, you've
to say you've never seen them before." He winked again. "You
understand?"</p>

<p>Mangan pocketed the note with a grin. "All right," he said.
"You can trust me. No one will get anything out of me, I promise
you."</p>

<p>After that his employer gradually became much more confiding.
"In this kind of business," he explained, "to make things pay we
have occasionally to buy little odds and ends that it wouldn't
do for the police to know about. Some of these chaps who come to
me have picked up little trifles and I don't enquire too closely
how they came to get them." He laughed. "Then, of course, I
don't enter the transaction in my book and the police have no
hold upon me. Oh, yes, they come and inspect the books sometimes
and, once or twice, the blackguards have even made a search of
everything here. That's why I never keep things bought in that
way long upon the premises."</p>

<p>It was well his employer had so confided in Mangan, as
shortly after this conversation, there was a brush with the
police about a silver Queen Anne comfit box which they alleged
Wardale had bought and, knowing quite well it was 'stolen
goods,' had not entered the transaction into his purchase book.
They declared the man who had sold it to him was a well-known
bad character and had been recognised, when entering the shop,
by someone who knew him.</p>

<p>Confronted with the suspect, who also strenuously denied the
transaction, both the dealer and Mangan swore they had never set
eyes upon him before. In consequence of these denials the police
were unable to lay a charge against Wardale and were furious
about it, because they were certain that in him they had found
the 'fence' they had long been wanting to get into their hands.
Mangan was delighted about the whole business and in his
unsocial leanings had thought it great sport to back up his
employer in his untruths.</p>

<p>With complete trust now in his assistant, Wardale at once
raised his weekly wage to £5 and from then on there was not much
about the transactions in the little shop about which he was
kept in the dark. He was astonished at the amount of money which
changed hands in the backroom in the buying of articles which
had undoubtedly been stolen, and realised what a profitable
business it was as long as one managed to get away with it.</p>

<p>He learnt it was well-known in the underworld that Wardale
specialised in the buying of articles of old silver and that he
was recognised as something of an authority in estimating their
value. Mangan found out, too, that, apart from the good profits
he made, as a conniosseur his employer delighted in handling
beautiful things and was always sorry that he could keep so many
of them in his possession for only such a short time. He tried,
too, and not without success, to interest Mangan in all things
silver, and, after any special deal in the back room, would call
him in and explain what had made his purchase good-buying. Also,
he lent him books upon the subject and was at all times most
willing to pass on to him his expert knowledge.</p>

<p>Upon some days, too, when there was an art sale on anywhere
within easy distance, the shop would be shut for a few hours,
and the two of them would go to watch the bidding. The dealer
would have marked upon the catalogue, beforehand, what price he
thought certain articles would fetch, and Mangan found that he
was never very much out in his reckonings.</p>

<p>Altogether Mangan was not unhappy in his occupation and made
up his mind that one day he would take it on himself. However,
when he had been at the shop for about eighteen months, the
Great War started and, to his employer's regret, he left him at
once to take his part in it. He realised it was the very calling
he was fitted for and would give opportunity to his bold and
reckless disposition, with no real hard work and certainly no
sense of boredom. As a one-time Oxford University man, he was at
once taken for a commission and so it was as Lieutenant Mangan
he took part in the real fighting in France.</p>

<p>Efficient in every way, resourceful, brave to the point of
recklessness and unmindful of all danger, he made an ideal
soldier, and his promotion was rapid. Transferred with his
regiment to take part in the African campaign and obtaining his
captaincy, he was awarded the D.S.O. for conspicuous gallantry
when, single-handed he wiped out a machine-gun nest with hand
grenades.</p>

<p>The African campaign over, he volunteered to help the
Resistance Movement in France and was dropped there by
parachute. With a fair knowledge of the language, he speedily
became the leader of a little band of patriots who operated from
a hiding-place deep in the Auvergne Mountains. Time after time
they would come down from their fastness and, long after night
had fallen, with bullets, hand grenades, and their long
razor-sharp knives deal out bloody punishment to the German
soldiery.</p>

<p>Appearing unexpectedly in so many widely-separated places,
they became known as "The Shadow Band" and many ineffectual
attempts were made to trap them. Greatly daring, upon occasions
they would work in only twos and threes and then make their way
in the dead of night into the very heart of a town occupied in
good force by the enemy. The next morning when it was discovered
the ghastly things that had happened a veritable wave of terror
would sweep through the Germans.</p>

<p>In his sheer lust for slaughter, no one was more brave and
reckless than Mangan, and one story in particular was related of
him. The Commandant of a certain district had become noted for
his bestial treatment of anyone, man, woman or child upon whom
had fallen the slightest suspicion of having supplied
information to the partisans. His long suit was torturing little
children before their parents' eyes.</p>

<p>It was resolved that he should die, but, well aware of the
hatred in which he was held and the threat of a bloody death for
ever hanging over him, the utmost precautions were being taken
that no suspicious person should get even within shooting
distance of him.</p>

<p>Weighing up all the chances, Mangan finally decided that he
would carry out the execution himself, unaided and alone.</p>

<p>The Commandant had his headquarters in an old chateau
situated in a big garden encircled by a high wall and, day and
night, sentries were posted within a few yards of one another
all round. To guard against all possible chances of treachery
from inside, every night all the servants were dismissed to
sleep in their own homes in the town. Then the doors were
securely locked and bolted, and the iron shutters to every
window screwed tightly into their positions. Nothing to make
everything secure was left undone and the Commandant and the
three members of his staff who slept in the chateau with him
were confident no trouble would ever ensue.</p>

<p>Yet one morning the door had to be broken down to get into
the chateau and, to everyone's horror and amazement, it was
found the four inmates had all been killed during the night,
with their throats cut from ear to ear. They had been
slaughtered in their sleep, and the Germans never found out how
the slayers had first got into the chateau and then, with their
dreadful work accomplished, had managed to get away.</p>

<p>In telling the story afterwards, Mangan, who to his credit
was never boastful, never disclosed to outsiders that he himself
had been the actual killer. Indeed, he used to say that he only
related the story to bring home to his listeners the profound
execration in which the occupying German army was held by the
French peasantry wherever the soldiers were stationed.</p>

<p>When asked, as of course he always was, how the killers had
succeeded in getting into the chateau, he would relate how very
simple it had been. "The Boches were so loathed," he would
reply, "that French parents were even willing to risk their
so-loved little children in the ghastly spirit of revenge." So,
one of the servants who worked in the chateau, during the day, he
would go on to relate, actually smuggled in her small daughter,
only twelve years old, and hid her under the coal in a big
cellar. Then, at night when all the chateau had quietened down,
she climbed up on to the coal and pulled away the bar which held
in place the large iron cover through which it was customary to
pour in the coal from outside. Then one man, only one, he would
emphasise, but he a most experienced killer, crept in from the
garden where he had been hiding all day under a sack and
finished off the inmates one by one, without awakening any of
them.</p>

<p>Such was the story Mangan used to tell. He did not, however
think it necessary to add that he had come away from the chateau
that night with a nice little haul of booty taken off the dead
men, including the Commandant's very valuable gold chronometer
which was disposed of later in London for three hundred
guineas.</p>

<p>The war ended and as Major Mangan now, with nothing better in
sight, with his gratuity and some money he had saved, he bought
himself in very cheaply as partner in the little second-hand
shop in Wardour Street and, with his naturally strong character
strengthened ten-fold by his war experiences, at once took
command of everything.</p>

<p>His one-time employer was quite happy about it. Whisky had
frayed his nerves almost down to breaking-point and he was very
glad for anyone to do his thinking for him. So he just allowed
Mangan to do what he liked, and the latter's changes in the
conducting of the business were very thorough.</p>

<p>Calling the shop now the <i>Etoile D'Argent</i> after a
famous Parisian one in the Rue de Rivoli, he had it entirely
redecorated in an attractive style. Next, he got rid of all the
old junk that had been lying about for years, and started to
restock with things bought at country sales. There, he bought
very cautiously at first, but, by closely following the bidding
of other dealers and by making friends of some of them by asking
their advice, he quickly began to acquire a good knowledge of
the trade.</p>

<p>With those who furtively brought articles to the shop when
there was all appearance of their having been dishonestly
acquitted, he adopted a friendly as well as a business-like
attitude. When he and his partner had decided what they would
pay he would say firmly, "That's all we are prepared to give you
now, but if you call back, say in a week's time, and we find we
have realised more than we expected&mdash;then there'll be a bit
more for you," and the sellers would go away quite assured that
they were being treated fairly.</p>

<p>Making good money now, Mangan lived the life of a man about
Town, with his friends and acquaintances apparently knowing
nothing of the Wardour Street shop and believing him to be a man
of independant means. His D.S.O. gave him something of a high
standing among them, bringing as it did the right of entry into
the Royal Enclosure at Ascot. Sponsored by former brother
officers, he joined two quite good clubs. There, as in his old
Oxford days, he found he could hold his own with anyone at cards
and was as good a player as the best of them. Always a good
judge of character, too, he knew when it was safe to do a little
manipulating with the cards, and his clubs became a source of
good income to him.</p>

<p>Acquiring a small but well-appointed flat in Fitzroy Square,
he took to giving small card parties there, and it was pretty
certain that he would come out in the right side if only in a
small amount. As far as his own gains were concerned, he took
care the same man never lost a good sum to him more than
once.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>This then was the man whom Professor Glenowen was now abusing
with every unpleasant word he could lay his tongue to. "And did
you hope I shouldn't recognise you, you blackguard?" he sneered.
"Was that why you were keeping so quiet?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Mangan coolly, "I would have told you
at once who I was if you had not been so ready with your talk
about my stomach and your gun. You were so excited that if I had
interrupted you with a word you might have shot me out of
hand."</p>

<p>"And I almost wish I had now," snarled the professor. His
eyes glared. "You would have shot me, wouldn't you, if you could
have got in first?"</p>

<p>Mangan looked contemptuous. "Not for those few bits of stuff
I was going to take. Do you think I'd have been such a fool as
to commit murder for a few spoons and forks?"</p>

<p>"But you told us all openly in those tales the other night at
Blackarden Castle," snapped the professor, "that killing had
been your trade for so long in the war that you often felt you
wanted to return to it."</p>

<p>Mangan shook his head frowningly. "That was only a joke, an
after dinner joke when I'd had plenty of champagne." He spoke
persuasively. "See here, Professor Glenowen, I know I was doing
a dreadful thing in going to steal your silver and I'm
thoroughly ashamed of myself. My only excuse is, and it's a very
poor one, it was a sudden temptation on the spur of the moment.
I was badly needing water for my radiator and couldn't find any
pail to carry it to my car. Then I saw one through the kitchen
window and climbed in to get it. I swear to you that I had no
other thought in my mind. Still, I became curious about the
other rooms and wandered in here." He shrugged his shoulders. "I
saw the silver. I was tempted&mdash;and I fell." He spoke
earnestly. "As I say, I know it was a dreadful thing to
do&mdash;me, an <i>old Oxford University</i> man and one who
held his Majesty's commision in the war."</p>

<p>"And that's the tale you'll tell the police, is it?" scoffed
the professor. "Well, it's not likely to help you much." He
spoke sharply. "What's your occupation&mdash;if you have any
other occupation than the one I've caught you in today?"</p>

<p>"An art-dealer," replied Mangan. "I buy and sell anything
valuable&mdash;" he smiled a cold smile, "&mdash;including all
things silver."</p>

<p>The professor pointed to the pistol and the knuckleduster
upon the table. "And these, I suppose," he asked grimly, "are
the appliances you make use of in your calling?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," replied Mangan coolly, "but as most of my
buying is done away from my place of business I often carry good
sums in banknotes and, in these after-war days I have to be
prepared for anything."</p>

<p>"You didn't know I had a bungalow here?" asked the professor
eyeing him very intently.</p>

<p>Mangan shook his head. "No, I understand you lived in
Town."</p>

<p>The professor frowned. "Then I suppose you know all about me?
You had heard of me before we met at Lord Delamarne's?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I had," agreed Mangan, who judged rightly that
Glenowen was not averse to a little flattery. "Everyone knows
about you. You are a well-known Communist and wrote that letter
to <i>The Times</i> a little while ago, suggesting that anyone
who shot those German scientists who have been brought out here
by our Government to help make the atom-bomb would be quite
justified in doing so. You said it would be an act of service to
all humanity." He nodded. "I agree with you. The atom-bomb
should be outlawed."</p>

<p>The professor looked thoughtful. "And you would shoot that
Carl von Bressen and Otto Kernstein if you got the chance?"</p>

<p>"Shoot them as I would mad dogs," scowled Mangan, "if I could
be sure of doing it without being caught. I'd shoot any German.
I saw too much of their vile work when I was fighting with the
Resistance Movement in France. They were inhuman beasts to any
partisan they got hold of."</p>

<p>The sounds of a motor were heard in the distance and they
both stopped speaking. A car came by the window slowing down,
and it could be heard passing into the yard. Mangan's eyes
opened to their widest and his jaw dropped.</p>

<p>"Don't faint," said the professor, looking very amused at
Mangan's obvious uneasiness. "It isn't the police, only my man
who's returned from an errand&mdash;" he smiled a grim smile as
excited barks were heard in the passage "&mdash;and here's a
friend of mine who would like to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>A fierce-looking Alsatian burst into the room. "To heel,
Pluto," shouted the professor peremptorily. "To heel, I tell
you. Come here," and the big animal who, upon catching sight of
Mangan, had bared his teeth and started to growl savagely, with
obvious reluctance sidled up to his master and squatted at his
feet.</p>

<p>The professor pocketed his own pistol, and swept Mangan's and
the knuckle-duster off the table in a drawer in the desk. "You
can do up your trousers," he said sharply, "but be very careful
what you do and don't make any quick movement, as it might bring
the dog upon you at once. Pluto is always savage with
strangers." He looked mockingly at Mangan. "And how much of
those adventures of yours in France you told us about that night
when I met you at Blackarden Castle were really true?"</p>

<p>"Every word of them," replied Mangan with some indignation.
"There was no need to exaggerate or lie. We were killers, every
one of us, and as fierce and savage as any beast of the jungle
ever is."</p>

<p>"But my opinion is that you're a coward," said the professor
sharply. "You went as white as a ghost just now when this dog of
mine came into the room."</p>

<p>"And was that to be wondered at?" snapped Mangan, furious at
being so insulted by this insignificant-looking little man. "I
am unarmed and he looks as dangerous a brute as I've ever met."
He gritted his teeth savagely. "But give me my jacket over my
left arm and my long commando knife in my right hand&mdash;" he
looked contemptuous&mdash;"and I'll slit him open from midriff
to stern as quick as you can see. I've killed scores such as he
without getting a scratch."</p>

<p>"Oh, you have, have you?" commented the professor as if in
some doubt. He regarded Mangan thoughtfully. "And it was you
then who cut the throat of that German Commandant you told us
about," he asked, "as well as those of his staff?"</p>

<p>"It was," replied Mangan curtly. "I don't boast about it, as
things like that were all in our day's work. It was adventure
and sport to us."</p>

<p>"And would be again?" queried the professor.</p>

<p>Mangan nodded. "I expect so, if those times ever come back
again."</p>

<p>The professor seemed to have come to some resolution. "Well,
I'll put you to the test, my fine cock-sparrow," he said grimly,
"and just see the stuff you're really made of." He pointed to
the silver upon the table. "Put those spoons and forks back
where you found them. My man will be in in a minute or two to
lay lunch and I hope I may have the pleasure of your
company."</p>

<p>Mangan could not believe his ears. "Have lunch with you?" he
queried. "Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm overlooking that little matter of your lapse," nodded
the professor, "and, except for your pistol which I'll retain
for the present, you can put back the other things into your
pockets. Yes, we'll have lunch together." He spoke in a half
smiling and half sneering tone, "And if you are as competent and
fearless as you make yourself out to be, you will be delighted
at the very thought of a project I am going to put before
you."</p>

<p>A minute or so later a big and hefty man not unlike a
prize-fighter in appearance came into the room. He gave Mangan a
hard, long stare before proceeding to lay the table. A short
conversation in Welsh proceeded between him and his master and
then the latter turned to Mangan.</p>

<p>"Now if you happen to like them, Mr. Brown," he said, rubbing
his hands as gleefully as a little child, "I can give you a
great treat, jellied eels. Have you ever tasted them?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I have," replied Mangan. "Are they good?"</p>

<p>"Excellent!" exclaimed the professor. "To my thinking they
have a flavour every bit as good as that of the turbot. After
the eels there'll be a cold duck." He laughed. "It's funny,
isn't it, that the three filthiest feeders in the world, the
pig, the duck and the eel should all have the most delicate
flavour of their kind? Nothing can excel the delicacy of their
flesh and its flavour is wholly individual."</p>

<p>Mangan felt altogether stupified at what was happening. Only
such a few minutes before he had been within an ace of having a
bullet in his stomach and now&mdash;he was being invited in the
most friendly manner possible to share a meal with the very man
who had threatened him and whose goods he had actually been
caught red-handed in the act of stealing.</p>

<p>Of course, the man was mad, but what in his madness was going
to happen next?</p>

<p>With the two seated opposite to each other at the table they
proceeded to enjoy what Mangan assured the gratified professor
was as dainty a little meal as could have been provided
anywhere. The atmosphere was most friendly, with the professor
drawing out from his guest more of his adventures when fighting
with the patriots of France. In particular the professor seemed
to revel in the more gruesome details and his eyes sparkled at
the recital of any episode where his guest mentioned having had
resource to his big commando knife.</p>

<p>"Blood-thirsty little wretch!" scowled Mangan under his
breath. "He's quite mental and would just love to set that big
beast at me, and it wouldn't take much to make him do it,
either."</p>

<p>The Alsatian had annoyed Mangan not a little the whole time
they were having the meal and, to his irritation, he found
himself continually glancing in the dog's direction. Stretched
out upon the sofa, with his huge head resting upon his paws,
never once had the big animal taken his eyes off him and, with
the slightest movement Mangan had made in his chair, he had
instantly lifted up his head and emitted a low growl. He had
seemed ready to spring at him any moment.</p>

<p>The professor was obviously well aware of this little byplay
which was going on and at length asked smilingly, "So my doggie
fidgets you, does he? Don't you like Alsatians?"</p>

<p>Mangan choked down the rage at the half-mocking way in which
the question had been put. "It isn't that I don't like them," he
said carelessly, "but the Germans always used them and in
consequence they are associated in my mind with the bestialities
of the unspeakable Hun. So, whenever I see one now, my memory
goes back to the many I have had to kill."</p>

<p>"They are good fighters?" queried the professor.</p>

<p>"The best," nodded Mangan, "but quite easy to kill if you
face up to them when they attack you."</p>

<p>"Then you think," smiled the professor, "that if I took you
both out into the yard and armed you, say with this carving
knife here, my poor Pluto wouldn't stand much chance in the
fight."</p>

<p>"The carving-knife would be no good," scoffed Mangan, "but
give me a good cut-throat razor and it'd be all over in double
quick time."</p>

<p>"And you wouldn't mind killing him?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mangan. He smiled. "Haven't I told you
killing is my trade."</p>

<p>"Good," nodded the professor, "then as I say, if you're the
brave man you make yourself out to be you'll jump at a
proposition I am going to put to you in a few minutes." He shook
his head disapprovingly. "But with you being a one-time commando
I am rather disappointed in you. You ought not to have allowed
yourself to be caught as you were. Your car was under my
observation from the moment you came down the road. I was not
very far away, down by the edge of the sea, looking for
specimens, and, though certainly it's understandable you might
not have picked me up because my mackintosh is much the same
colour as that of the mud, you ought to have been aware someone
belonging to the bungalow was somewhere close about."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Mangan testily, annoyed at the superior and
patronising way in which the professor was admonishing him.</p>

<p>"By my footprints in the mud, of course," returned the
professor. "They start not half a dozen yards from where your
car is standing, and you should have noticed they were only
one-way ones. Therefore you should have known that the person who
made them had not come back, but was somewhere about by the
margin of the sea."</p>

<p>"I didn't see them at all," frowned Mangan.</p>

<p>"Then you should have done," said the professor, "as they
were close under your very eyes." He turned the conversation
abruptly. "By the by, as the bosom friend of his nephew I
suppose you know Lord Delamarne quite well?"</p>

<p>Mangan was inclined to be non-committal. "I've stayed at the
Castle a few times," he said, "but I can't say I know him well,
as I think very few people do. He's a most reserved man."</p>

<p>The professor smiled a dry smile. "Well, with your partiality
for old silver, no doubt you induced him to show you what he's
got."</p>

<p>"I didn't have to induce him," snapped Mangan in continued
irritability at the professor's sarcastic tone. "He was quite
ready to show me some of the trifles he has in the cabinet in
his study, but everybody knows he keeps back his best things for
his own pleasure, hidden away."</p>

<p>The professor nodded. "Yes, in those underground passages,
those walled-up dungeons of his, in a specially constructed
steel chamber into which he thinks no burglar can break. As a
Communist I regard it as a most selfish procedure and I'd love
him to lose the lot." He laughed. "Why don't you have a go at
them? I'm sure that with assistance from some of your criminal
friends you'd be able to find a way to break in."</p>

<p>Mangan made no comment and regarded him with an angry, sullen
face. The professor went on. "Oh, they'd be worth a lot of risk.
No one has any idea what treasures he may have hidden there." He
chuckled delightedly. "Now, I'll tell you something which will
surprise you. You remember that 18th century silver kettle which
fetched such a huge sum at Southby's last year, don't you?"</p>

<p>Mangan remembered it quite well, as at the time its sale had
caused quite a mild sensation in the art world. The kettle had
been a magnificent example of a silversmith's work when the
Huguenots had first settled in London and it bore the stamp of
having been made in 1715. The bidding had opened at a thousand
guineas and gone up quickly to eighteen hundred in the favour of
a well-known collector. Then when it seemed no further bid was
going to be made and the auctioneer was in the very act or
dropping his hammer, a shabby-looking man whom no one knew
chipped in boldly with another hundred guineas.</p>

<p>For the moment the auctioneer hesitated as if doubtful about
accepting the bid of a perfect stranger, but the latter held up
a fist-full of banknotes and called out that all the money
likely to be needed was there. Whereupon the bid was accepted,
to be, however, immediately capped by another hundred from the
collector. Quite confidently the stranger bid another fifty and
then, ding-dong with no hesitation, the bidding went on until
twenty-six hundred was reached. Whereupon the collector at once
threw in his hand and the kettle was knocked down to the
stranger who nonchalantly paid up with his banknotes and,
placing his purchase in a shabby black bag, disappeared as
unobtrusively as he had come. For a long time afterwards there
was much speculation as to for whom the stranger had been
acting, but nothing had been found out, so who was now in actual
possession of the kettle was as great a mystery as ever.</p>

<p>Now questioned by the professor, Mangan said he remembered
the sale and, as with everyone else, was curious as to who had
been the buyer.</p>

<p>"I can tell you," laughed the professor exultingly. "It was
bought on Lord Delamarne's behalf and he has got it now at the
casde."</p>

<p>Mangan frowned sceptically. "He has showed it to you?" he
asked.</p>

<p>The professor shook his head. "No, but I've spoken to someone
to whom he has, and it's interesting how I came to know all
about it. Some months ago I wanted some electric work done here
and applied to a firm in Norwich who sent out an Italian workman
who could only speak a few words of English. However, that
didn't matter at all as I know Italian well. The man was here
for three days and was delighted to talk to someone who spoke
his mother tongue. He was a very intelligent chap&mdash;" he
laughed "&mdash;and, of course, a Communist. We became very
friendly."</p>

<p>The professor went on. "Talking about his experiences in
England&mdash;the man had been over here only a few
weeks&mdash;he mentioned that he had been recently doing a job
for a very eccentric old gentleman and, if the old fellow had
not owned a castle and been a lord, he might quite reasonably
have suspected something very wrong was going on. There was such
a secrecy about everything, and, before going down to an
underground passage where some new wiring was wanted, he was
actually blindfolded so that he should not learn how he had got
there."</p>

<p>Mangan was intensely interested all at once. "You are sure it
was Lord Delamarne," he exclaimed, "and that Blackarden was the
casde?"</p>

<p>The professor nodded. "Of course! And during the three days
the Italian was working there Delamarne was down underground
with him the whole time. When they went down in the early
morning they carried their mid-day meal with them so that they
did not come up again until night. They spoke in French, but,
having explained what wanted doing, this Italian said the lord
hardly said a word to him. He said he felt a bit awed as
everything was so silent and cold, and he knew he must be many,
many feet below the castle, as he had counted seventy-six steps
coming down a narrow stone stairway which, he says, at the time,
he thought would never end."</p>

<p>"But surely Lord Delamarne," broke in Mangan, "would
have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The professor held up his hand frowningly. "Wait until I've
finished," he snapped, "and then you can ask what you like." He
paused a few moments to collect the threads of thoughts and then
went on. "Well, he worked at the beginning of a long passage,
but while he was not watching him, which he says was not for
many minutes at a time, Delamarne was busy doing something round
a corner at the farther end, quite he thinks, fifty yards
away.</p>

<p>"Well, upon the second day, wanting some more instruction as
what next to do and with Delamarne round his corner, as a matter
of course he went up the passage to speak to him. To his
amazement he found him in a little room opening out from the
solid stone wall. The room was brightly lit and, seated at a
small table, Delamarne was busy polishing up a tall silver
candlestick. All round the chamber in glass cabinets were
articles of silver and the man says they flashed and sparkled
under the light." The professor leant back in great good humour.
"Now what do you think of that? Fancy our friend going to such
extremes to protect whatever he has got, however valuable!"</p>

<p>Mangan pursed up his lips. "But it's not by any means
unusual," he said. "Once the mania for collecting gets its grip
on any man he is no longer normal and there is no accounting for
his actions." He frowned. "But wasn't Lord Delamarne furious at
the man having seen what he had?"</p>

<p>"Furious, and looked as if he would have liked to kill him,"
nodded the professor. "But he soon came round and was quite
friendly with the man. He said that an Italian would be sure to
like beautiful things and he started showing off his possessions
one by one, and that is how it came about that the workman so
distinctly remembers the kettle and the date 1715. The next day
when he left, Delamarne gave him £10 as a present for his
promise to never tell anyone what he had seen."</p>

<p>"And he told you," queried Mangan dryly, "directly he came
here."</p>

<p>"No, not directly," corrected the professor, "not until we
had got pretty friendly and become aware we were both
Communists." He laughed. "Our mutual detestation of the
so-called upper classes seemed to release him from his vow."</p>

<p>Mangan was silent for a few moments and then asked
frowningly, "And do you mean to say the workman has absolutely
no idea from what part of the castle that long stairway of those
seventy-six steps started?"</p>

<p>The professor laughed. "Oh yes, he has a very good idea; in
fact he says that while his blindfold journey was quite a
lengthy one along several corridors with a lot of twists and
turnings and commenced in Delamarne's study, he is quite sure it
ended there too, as there was the feel of the same carpet under
his feet and the same smell of books in his nostrils." The
professor snapped his fingers together. "Well, you think it
over, my friend. There should be some good pickings for you in
that old castle if you set about getting them in a methodical
way."</p>

<p>The meal over and cleared away the professor spoke in sharp
and businesslike tones. "Now for what I want you to do. To begin
with, however, as a Communist you must be a great admirer of
Soviet Russia?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I am," agreed Mangan with no hesitation. "But for
them we should not have won the war."</p>

<p>"And, as you have already told me," continued the professor,
"you heartily disapprove of us English-speaking nations taking
advantage of our possession of the atom bomb and threatening to
use it against them."</p>

<p>"I do," nodded Mangan. "Its employment by all nations ought
to be outlawed at once."</p>

<p>"And do you agree with me," went on the professor earnestly,
"that bringing over these Germans should be stopped by all means
possible, lawful or unlawful?"</p>

<p>Mangan pretended to stir in fierce indignation. "I most
certainly do," he said angrily. "As I have already told you if
only you had seen as I have what the Germans did to the French
patriots during the occupation, the unbelievable tortures and
sufferings they inflicted upon them&mdash;you would have no use
for any Hun except to shoot him and get him under the ground as
quickly as possible. From my experiences there's not a pin to
choose between any of them. They are all devils."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" exclaimed the professor triumphantly. "That's the
view I take." He paused a moment and then burst out, "And I want
you to kill one of the worst of them who's been brought over
here, that scoundrel, Dr. Carl von Bressen." His eyes gleamed
fanatically. "I want him destroyed and I'll pay you well to do
it. That's the proposition I am putting before you&mdash;to get
rid of an enemy to all humankind."</p>

<p>For the moment Mangan was too amazed to make any comment.
Certainly he had thought from the professor's preliminary
remarks that he was leading up to some extraordinary
proposition, but he, Mangan, had never expected he was going to
be asked to carry out the deliberate murder of a prominent
public man.</p>

<p>The professor went on in crisp and businesslike tones. "Yes,
and I'm prepared to pay you the sum of £1,000 down for your
killing him in any way you feel most convenient." His voice
rose. "I want the whole world to learn that bringing these
German scientists over here is not going to be tolerated and
that there are decent men among us who are prepared to go to any
length to stop it."</p>

<p>Mangan made no comment. He was thinking hard. Of course, the
excited little man before him was stark, staring mad, but for
all that his money was not mad and it should be easy to touch
some of it.</p>

<p>The professor went on with great earnestness. "You must
consider my position, Major Mangan, the position I occupy in the
public eye. More than thirty years ago, I was made Professor of
Natural Science at Cambridge University and I am not boasting
when I tell you that for many years now I have been recognised
as the greatest living authority in the world upon molluscs." He
snapped his fingers together disdainfully. "Why, only a few
years back I received the enormous fee of fifty thousand
guineas&mdash;I wouldn't go for less&mdash;to travel to the
United States and find out what was wrong with their oyster beds
in Chesapeake Bay. The whole industry down the Atlantic coast
and the Gulf of Mexico was threatened with extinction, but I was
able to advise them what the trouble was and the rot was stopped
at once."</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand guineas!" exclaimed Mangan, who was visibly
surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, and for about three weeks' work," nodded the professor.
He smiled. "So you can realise I am a wealthy man and that
£1,000 is nothing to me."</p>

<p>He held up one hand impressively. "But all my life long I
have been known as a man of extreme social views and have been
vilified and insulted and even turned out of my professorial
chair at the University because of them. More than one attempt,
too, has been made to tar and feather me by young blackguards
spurred on by rival scientists who would have dearly loved to
humiliate me in any way."</p>

<p>"Disgusting!" exclaimed Mangan, who nevertheless thought the
idea of the tarring and feathering of the wasplike little
professor rather amusing and would have greatly liked to have a
good laugh.</p>

<p>"So do you wonder," asked the professor, "that I want to get
my revenge? If this German doctor is killed, it will prove that
I am not alone in the opinions I hold. So that's why I am
offering you £1,000 for getting rid of the fellow." He smiled
dryly. "Surely an excellent payment to you, considering that
during the war, if half what you have told me is true, you have
taken scores and scores of lives for the paltry pay of a few
shillings a day."</p>

<p>Now completely recovered from the surprise, Mangan had made
up his mind that he would agree to do what the professor wanted
and get what money he could out of him in advance. Then he would
have nothing more to do with him. The vicious little beast would
have no hold upon him.</p>

<p>However, it seemed that the professor had read his thoughts,
as he rapped out sharply, "But don't you imagine, my fine
fellow," he snarled, "that I am going to trust you a single
inch. I know your kind and won't part with a penny until the
job's done."</p>

<p>Mangan's anger rose at the insulting way in which he was
being addressed. "And how do you imagine I am going to trust
<i>you?</i>" he asked equally as sharply. He looked scornful.
"You might drag me into deliberate murder and then deny
everything and pay me nothing." He shook his head. "No, I'm as
distrustful of you as you say you are of me."</p>

<p>The professor raised on long forefinger significantly. "Ah,
but you would have a hold upon me," he retorted instantly, "for
if you carry out this first mission successfully, I shall have
similar ones for you to do. I shall employ you again upon
equally generous terms." He gritted his teeth. "This von Bressen
is not the only blackguard I want put under the ground. He is
only the first on the list. His colleague, Otto Bernstein,
another damnable rogue, would come next, and then there are
several others, Britishers, to their shame I regret, to follow
after."</p>

<p>Mangan frowned. "But knowing nothing about you"&mdash;he
remembered the vicious kicks the professor had given him and his
frown changed to a grim smile&mdash;"except that people call you
the mad professor, do you really think I should be fool enough
to go out of this room and commit a deliberate murder on your
promise to pay me £1,000 when I have done it?" He looked amused.
"Surely you can't expect me to have as much faith in you as all
that?"</p>

<p>The professor's jaw dropped and for the moment he did not
seem to know how to reply. Then he said slowly and evidently
with some reluctance, "I see your point and perhaps it's not
altogether unreasonable." He considered a few moments. "Well,
this is what I'll do. I'll give you £50 straight away as
expenses, for you to go down to Cambridge&mdash;that's where the
brute is living&mdash;and see exactly how the killing can be
done. Find out all about him, his habits and his general way of
life. Then come back to me and if I see you mean business I'll
pay you another £100 on account."</p>

<p>"Not enough," said Mangan sharply. "I'll want £200 at
least."</p>

<p>The professor hesitated. "All right," he said, "£200 it shall
be, and then another £750 when the job is done."</p>

<p>Mangan appeared to consider. "But first tell me more about
the man. Where he is living and how am I likely to catch him
alone?"</p>

<p>"He is staying in one of the best private houses in
Cambridge," said the professor, "Number ninety-four Trumpington
Road. He sleeps and has all his meals there except lunch. The
house is surrounded by a large garden and, when the weather
allows it, he sits reading there after his dinner." He snapped
his fingers together. "And that's all I'm going to tell you. The
rest you must find out for yourself, so that when you come back
to report progress to me I know you've really started on the
job. The shooting should be quite easy."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you do it for yourself?" asked Mangan
brusquely.</p>

<p>"Ah, but I'm too well known in Cambridge," was the instant
reply, "and when anything happened to this man, it would be
remembered I had been seen in the town. As I tell you, the
shooting will be easy enough, but it will be the getting away
afterwards that will be the risk. You must realise that I lived
in Cambridge for longer than twenty years and mine is not an
appearance that would lend to any disguise"&mdash;he
laughed&mdash;"a little chap like me with my unforgettable red
head."</p>

<p>"All right then," said Mangan after a long pause, "I'll take
it on if I don't find the risk is too great. Still&mdash;mind
you I shan't attempt it if I'm not perfectly sure of being able
to get away afterwards. From what you say the shooting may be
easy enough, but it'll be the getting away afterwards and
leaving no trail behind that will be the snag."</p>

<p>They talked on for a long while and finally the professor
handed over the £50 in banknotes. "Well, I expect to see you
next Wednesday at my flat in St. John's Wood, at eight o'clock,"
he said, "eight o'clock sharp, and be sure and don't be late.
I'm always punctual myself and expect other people to be so,
too."</p>

<p>Mangan drove back to Town in a very unsettled frame of mind.
One moment he was inclined to have nothing more to do with the
professor, but the next the big money tempted him and he thought
that perhaps he might see the whole thing through. At any rate,
he told himself, he'd go down to Cambridge and find out enough
about the German scientist to be able to claim the payment of
the £200.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>

AT NIGHT IN THE GARDEN</h2>

<p class="first">NOW while it may not have been exactly true, as
the professor had wanted to make out, that Mangan was the bosom
friend of Lieutenant Chester Avon, certainly of late a strong
friendship, which the elder man took good care should not cool,
had sprung up between them.</p>

<p>As the nephew of Lord Delamarne and heir to the barony young
Avon was a most useful person to know, because it was through
him that the major had become acquainted with a number of people
of good social position who, upon occasions, were not unwilling
to risk fairly heavy sums at cards. Of course, highly taxed as
they all were, few of them had anything like the large incomes
they once had had, but it was symptomatic of the times that so
many of them were dipping deeply into their capitals to enjoy to
the full the old pleasures and luxuries of the pre-war days.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Avon was a good-looking young fellow of one and
twenty and who, though having obtained his commission, had been
just too late to see any real active service in the 1939-45 War.
With the war over, he had continued in the Regular Army, but
later, through the influence of his uncle had been given
employment in the War Office.</p>

<p>Most obliging and good-natured, he was by no means of a
strong character and very easily led, but strange to say
Mangan's influence over him was all for the best. Flattered by
the dashing major's attentions, he was always willing to take
his advice and, accordingly, Mangan saw to it that he avoided
unsuitable companions and did not get mixed up with people whom
it was undesirable for a future peer of the realm to know. He
took particular care, too, that he should not become entangled
in any close association with any of the other sex, who were
always trying to set their caps at him.</p>

<p>Still, Mangan's interest and care were wholly selfish ones,
for not only was he benefiting now by the young man's almost
exclusive friendship, but also, looking ahead, he had his eyes
upon the time when the young lieutenant would become the master
of Blackarden Castle and in possession at any rate of most of
what went with it.</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne was old and ailing and there was much
speculation as to what he was worth. Certainly he must be a
wealthy man, and ever since he had come into the barony, more
than forty years previously, there had been persistent rumours
of some treasure hidden away in the walled-up dungeons deep
below his 600 year-old castle. It was said to have been brought
over to England by his grandfather when the latter had returned
from India after the 1857 mutiny.</p>

<p>So that evening upon his return to Town after his
extraordinary encounter with Professor Glenowen in the latter's
bungalow upon the Norfolk coast, ruminating over the
conversation that had taken place between them, it was only
natural Mangan should be thinking hard about both the professor
himself and the Lord of Blackarden Castle. Accordingly, knowing
young Lieutenant Avon was generally to be found at his club
about that time of day, he thought it would be just as well to
have a chat with him and clear up a few matters.</p>

<p>Finding him quite easily, as he had expected, after a few
general remarks he enquired how his uncle was.</p>

<p>"As well as usual and more eccentric than ever," laughed
Avon. "I was down there last week-end and his latest craze is
that he believes someone may one day try to break in by
burrowing under the Castle. So now he talks of having an
expensive sound-detector installed so that he'll be able to hear
if anyone is doing a bit of digging outside. It would be
laughable if it weren't such a waste of money."</p>

<p>"The less for you to come into one day, my boy," laughed
Mangan. He became serious. "But do you ever really believe that,
as they say, he's got a lot of gold hidden away somewhere?"</p>

<p>The young man shrugged his shoulders. "Sometimes I do and
then sometimes I think there's nothing in it. Still, you know
uncle's a very shrewd businesslike man and always seems to have
plenty of spending money. He's just bought another Botticelli
and I believe paid four thousand guineas for it."</p>

<p>"But have you never mentioned to him," asked Mangan, "the
rumour that his grandfather came back from India with a pot of
money?"</p>

<p>Avon looked aghast. "I'd never dare to," he replied. "He'd
snap my head off if I did. The only person whom we believe has
ever started to mention it to him is that old Professor Glenowen
whom you met the last time you were at the castle. It was a long
time ago he began questioning him about it, and my uncle was so
rude to him that it was years before he visited the place again.
Before that they used to play a lot of chess together."</p>

<p>"Ah, talking about that professor," exclaimed Mangan, very
pleased the conversation had come round to him, "is he really as
mad as they make him out to be?"</p>

<p>"Only in his stupid Communist ideas," replied Avon, "and then
he goes nuts at once. He seems, too, to have become much worse
lately. Otherwise, he's a good-natured, amiable little fellow.
Last year he heard that the Norwich Hospital was hard-up and at
once plumped down a cheque for £2,000, and said there would be
another £2,000 this year if they wanted it."</p>

<p>"And do you think he'll stump up if they ask for it?"</p>

<p>Avon looked surprised. "Of course he will! He's not the sort
of chap to ever go back upon his word, and besides he's got pots
of money, he could afford to give away. Those rotten books of
his sell all over the world and bring in tremendous
royalties."</p>

<p>Mangan was delighted he had so easily found out what he
wanted. Evidently then he could be sure of the promised £1,000
if he earned it, and so he began at once to think much more
favourably of the proposition the professor had put before him.
The money would certainly be most useful and it was to be earned
with practically no expenses at all. He had no qualms whatsoever
about shooting the German scientist. Indeed, in a way the idea
was quite pleasing to him, as it would be something of an
exciting adventure. Still, he told himself, he wasn't going to
rush blindly into the risk there undoubtedly would be of putting
his neck into the hangman's noose. He would go slowly and
examine first how great that risk would be.</p>

<p>Finally, he made up his mind that whether or not he would go
the whole way, at any rate he would get something more out of
this half-crazed little man by going down to Cambridge and
making the few enquiries necessary to qualify for the further
£200. Unless he found it would be an easy matter to plug the
German scientist with little or no risk to himself, though
making out to the professor that he was going to attempt to do
so, he would let the whole thing slide. Then, after all, he
would have earned £250 for a couple of days' work.</p>

<p>On the Sunday evening he went to his partner and told him
that on the morrow he would be going away for a few days into
the country. He said he had heard from one of his club friends
of some good stuff that might be picked up from an elderly
maiden lady near Nottingham, who, in order to meet the
exorbitant taxes which had been imposed upon her, was now
wanting to dispose of some of her old family plate.</p>

<p>However, rather uneasy as to how in his absence his partner
would handle things if any of their rapidly-growing clientele of
light-fingered gentry should come in with articles to sell, he
gave him strict instructions that on no account was anything to
be bought from them until he came back.</p>

<p>"Tell them," he said, "to call again at the end of the week.
You know how active the police have been lately and, with them
already suspicious of you, sooner or later it's certain they
will set a trap to catch us."</p>

<p>His partner, with his nerves as usual in a bad way, was quite
agreeable to do as he was told, being very glad to escape the
responsibility. Indeed, it happened he was the more willing just
then to do as he was ordered, because only a few weeks back two
second-hand dealers had been caught making purchases and not
entering the transactions in their purchase book. They had
fallen into the traps set by the police, and both had been
heavily fined, with their licences being taken away so that they
had been thrown out of business. And since these happenings
Mangan had been continually rubbing into him that it was only by
sheer good luck he himself had not been caught long ago.</p>

<hr>

<p>Mangan started for Cambridge early on the Monday morning, and
the following Wednesday evening the professor was fidgeting
about long before the appointed hour, eight o'clock, when he was
due to appear at the flat. The professor, however, was quite
certain Mangan <i>would</i> turn up with all plans cut and dried
to commit the required murder. It was an act of humanity, he
kept on telling himself, and he was hoping that if Mangan proved
himself capable enough to carry out this first commission
successfully, then it would be followed by more acts of a
similar kind.</p>

<p>One day, he told himself, he would write a book about
everything, of course to be published only after his death. Then
the sneering world would learn he had not sat down meekly under
all the abuse and insults he had received, but had played a bold
and unselfish part in endeavouring to save mankind by removing
some of its worst enemies.</p>

<p>Awaiting Mangan's arrival, he began to tick off on his
fingers for the hundredth time some of those against whom, apart
from their work upon the atom bomb, he had a particular personal
spite. The first&mdash;there was that one-time professorial
colleague of his, Professor Rodney, the low-minded brute who had
once referred to him, Harleck Glenowen, as a mangy little
red-headed Welsh ape. Ah, how he would love to hear of him having
been finished off in the true commando way and found strangled,
with his body all twisted up in convulsive agony and his swollen
tongue lolling out of his ugly blue-black face. Then there was
that Dr. Carmichael, who had said the padded room of a mental
asylum was the only place for him, and Travers, the scavenging
journalist, who had written openly in his newspaper that he
ought to be put away.</p>

<p>Still, the second German physicist, Otto Bernstein, must come
high on the list! He was a vile and Judas-like creature if ever
there was one! Once grovelling at the feet of Adolf Hitler when
it seemed the mighty Fuhrer of the Third Reich would dominate
the world, he was now boasting that all along he had, in secret,
hated his master and&mdash;but his musings were interrupted by
the ringing of the front door bell, and in a few moments his
expected and so welcome visitor was ushered into the room.</p>

<p>Mangan was in evening dress, his well-fitting dinner jacket
showing him off to good advantage. The professor thought he
looked the perfect type of officer and a gentleman, and
congratulated himself he had discovered so presentable an
assassin. Why, the man could go everywhere and mingle in the
best society without anyone entertaining the slightest suspicion
of what he really was!</p>

<p>"Good evening," said Mangan coldly and without offering to
shake hands. "You expected I'd turn up, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did," returned the professor. He spoke eagerly.
"Then you've been to Cambridge and spied out the lie of the
land?"</p>

<p>Mangan nodded. "I came back only this afternoon." He frowned.
"But I learn you have been going round making enquiries about
<i>me</i>. What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>The professor tried to cover his obvious embarrassment with a
little nervous laugh. "Oh, you've heard of that, have you?" he
said. "Well, what could be more natural than that I should be
interested in everything about someone to whom I am going to pay
a large sum of money?" He nodded. "Yes, I looked up your private
address in the phone book and just asked a few questions of the
attendant at your block of flats." He shook his head in disgust.
"But the dishonourable fellow, for the pound note I gave him,
promised me most faithfully that he would not mention to you
that I had been there and questioned him."</p>

<p>"Well, you certainly did not get much out of him for your
money," scoffed Mangan. "He knows nothing about me."</p>

<p>"Oh, doesn't he?" laughed the professor. "At any rate he told
me about that place in Wardour Street which you are running and
call 'Etoile d'Argent.' I got that out of him."</p>

<p>It was now Mangan's turn to look disconcerted. "He did, did
he?" he exclaimed. "Well, there's nothing in that. I told you I
was an art-dealer, didn't I?" He frowned. "Still, I wonder how
the devil he knew."</p>

<p>"A tenant of one of the other flats told him," said the
professor. "He passes down Wardour Street quite often and has
twice seen you going into the shop. Then he saw your name on the
lintel over the door." Glenowen lifted up one hand impressively.
"And it's probablly a good thing for you that attendant
<i>did</i> tell me all about it, as after I'd been round to have
a look at what sort of place you'd got, the idea struck me that
the police are much more interested in you than you can have any
idea. At any rate, I happened to notice a woman coming out of
your shop and, barely ten minutes later and just by chance, I
saw her again in a tea-shop in Leicester Square sitting between
two men." He held Mangan's eyes with his own. "One of these men
I know to be a detective from Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>Mangan cursed under his breath. "And how do you know he was a
detective?" he snarled.</p>

<p>"Because last week I went to Scotland Yard myself and he came
into the waiting-room to whisper to someone there. I have a good
memory for faces and he's got a nose like you see in pictures of
the Duke of Wellington. I had gone to the police with two
threatening letters I had received." He dismissed the matter
with a shake of his head and asked eagerly. "Well, you are
prepared to carry out my little commission?"</p>

<p>"I'm prepared to attempt it," replied Mangan slowly, "but the
risk is a big one for me, as he is guarded by a detective
wherever he goes. This detective is a special and experienced
one provided by the authorities in London. He's a Scotland Yard
man."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" asked the professor sharply.</p>

<p>Mangan shrugged his shoulders. "Everybody says so. It's the
talk of the town." He laughed. "Oh, yes, I have earned that £200
right enough. I spent three days in Cambridge and ferreted out
as much as I could. As you told me, the German is staying at
Canon Drew's big house, the last but one in Trumpington Road.
The Canon and his family are away from home, but two maid-servants
have been left to look after the doctor and the
guardian detective. The garden surrounding the house has walls
quite eight feet high, with broken glass at the top to keep
trespassers away. The detective motors the doctor to the
University laboratories every morning just before nine and they
come home again soon after six. Evidently they are being very
watchful, as the big gate in the drive is shut and locked after
the car has been driven in and the detective has searched the
grounds. Still, I can see it will be quite impossible for me to
get at him during the day. My only chance will be at night."</p>

<p>"And do you think you will be able to get him then?" asked
the professor anxiously.</p>

<p>"I may be able to manage it if the weather is all right,"
replied Mangan, "for after he's had his dinner, if the night is
fine and warm, as you mentioned, he <i>does</i> sit reading
until quite late under a light from that summer-house on the
other side of the garden. Then, upon the two nights that I was
watching him, it was well after eleven before he went into the
house. His bedroom is upon the ground floor, as I saw a light go
up in a room there directly after he went in."</p>

<p>"And from where did you see all this?" asked the
professor.</p>

<p>"From a tree in the garden of the next house," said Mangan.
"The wall there was easier to get over and I climbed up a big
oak which overlooks everything." He shrugged his shoulders. "But
I don't see how I am going to get over the high wall surrounding
the garden, as the broken glass at the top will make it very
awkward. Still, I must climb over it somewhere to get near
enough to shoot him with any certainty."</p>

<p>"But you needn't climb over where the glass is," said the
professor quickly. "As it happens I know the house next door
quite well. I used to visit there years ago, and you can get
over from the garden there. If you go to the other end of the
party wall separating the two houses you can climb on to the
roof of a tool-shed built right against the wall. Then you will
be only about a foot from the top and you can step over on to
another shed in the Canon's garden and drop on to the ground. It
couldn't be more simple."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Mangan. "I didn't know of that, and it'll
certainly make things easier." He shook his head. "But there
will be a bigger worry for me than that. My danger will be
getting away after I've finished with the man. I've seen where I
can cut the telephone wires, but I shall want a good long start
to escape any cordon the police may draw round the
district."</p>

<p>"But, you've got a fast car?" said the professor.</p>

<p>"That's nothing," exclaimed Mangan, "as the nearest place I
can park it with any safety is a good quarter of a mile from the
Canon's home, and I can't be noticed running like a madman to
get to it."</p>

<p>A short silence followed, and the professor asked, "Well,
when are you going to make the attempt? To-morrow night? The
sooner the better, I think, while the fine weather holds."</p>

<p>Mangan shook his head. "No, not at any rate before Saturday.
There's a circus opening in the town that night&mdash;thank
goodness&mdash;in a field off the Newmarket Road and right at
the other end of the town. The police will be kept busy there
and, with lots of cars coming in from all round the district,
mine is less likely to be remembered afterwards."</p>

<p>The ensuing conversation was protracted because Mangan
insisted that, with the risk being so great, £1,000 was not
enough. He wanted it raised to £1,500, with another payment
straightaway of £300 down.</p>

<p>"Mind you," he said sharply, "I don't promise I can bring it
off, but I'm certainly going to have a good try and, when you
consider the risk I am running, you must agree it's worth every
penny of the money."</p>

<p>With some demur the professor agreed to his terms and, going
to a safe in the wall, abstracted a large packet of banknotes
from which he counted out thirty £10 ones. Mangan made a mental
note that the safe was of an old fashioned pattern and could be
easily broken into.</p>

<p>"And when shall I see you again?" asked the professor, in
some excitement. "Shall you ring me up?"</p>

<p>Mangan shook his head. "No, I'll come round one evening just
before eight o'clock. It may be on Sunday, but it mayn't be
until much later in the week. I'm not going to be hasty, but
when and if I <i>do</i> strike I'll take good care it's at the
most opportune time," and he spoke with such confidence that the
professor was sure he was going to be successful.</p>

<p>The following morning Mangan arrived a little earlier than
usual at the shop in Wardour Street and at once enquired as to
how the business had been in his absence. His partner replied it
had not been bad and that he had made a few small sales. He
added that a woman had been in to sell two silver-plated entree
dishes, but he had done no business with her and asked her to
call again.</p>

<p>"She looked quite safe to me," he said, "and the dishes were
well worth buying, but I told her to call again, and so she'll
be coming in to-day or to-morrow."</p>

<p>Mangan made no comment, but when the woman duly arrived that
same afternoon he eyed her intently. About thirty, she had a
nice appearance and might have been a good-class domestic
servant. She made it appear that she was rather nervous, as she
kept glancing over her shoulder as she undid the parcel
containing the entree dishes. They were of good quality and
Mangan knew he would have no difficulty disposing of them. "They
are yours?" he asked, and when she nodded, he said, "Well, have
you taken them to anyone else to sell?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No, I came here because I was
recommended by a gentleman friend. You bought something of his a
little while ago."</p>

<p>"What did we buy?" asked Mangan carelessly.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, "but he told me you were quite fair
and&mdash;" she lowered her eyes "&mdash;didn't make any
fuss."</p>

<p>Mangan was quite enjoying the little comedy. "And how much do
you want for them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"£5," she said firmly, "and I won't take less." She gave a
little cough. "I shan't want a receipt."</p>

<p>Mangan smiled to himself. It was a sure thing the woman came
from the police. The dishes were worth more than double what she
was asking. However, he beat her down to a pound less.</p>

<p>"Then £4 it is," he said and at once produced one of the
firm's billheads for her to write down her name and address.</p>

<p>"She was quite O.K.," said Fenton with animation, when she
had gone, "and I'll take them straight round to old Beckstein.
He'll give us twelve quid without a murmur. You see if he
doesn't. We'll get them off the premises at once."</p>

<p>"No, we won't," snapped Mangan. "She was a police nark if
ever I saw one. £4 was a ridiculous price if everything was all
right, and I'll swear we shall be having detectives here within
the next twenty-four hours. I'll enter the buying in the book at
once."</p>

<p>His partner was inclined to be angry, and protested as much
as he dared. However, the next morning his face took on a very
different expression when the woman re-appeared with two
detectives as an escort this time. The men showed their badges
and one of them, pointing to the woman, demanded sharply, "You
bought two silver dishes from this party here yesterday. Well,
where are they? Are they still here?"</p>

<p>"Of course they are," replied Mangan, equally as sharply. "We
never try to resell anything we have bought from people we don't
know for at least a couple of weeks," and he produced the dishes
from a cupboard.</p>

<p>"Show me the entry in your book," ordered the detective and,
when he saw that everything was in order, he commented savagely.
"Only £4 for them! You must have known they were stolen
goods."</p>

<p>"We didn't," said Mangan coolly, "or we shouldn't have bought
them. We are honest dealers here and £4 was quite a fair price,
as it might have been months before we should have been able to
dispose of them again."</p>

<p>"Well, we take them away with us," scowled the detective,
"and you can call round later at the Yard for a refund of the
money."</p>

<p>It was a very subdued Wardale who expressed his gratitude to
his partner. "The luckiest day of my life when I came to know
you, my boy," he said. "Upon my own, I should have been booked
for quod as certain as eggs is eggs," and Mangan made the mental
note that for one thing, at all events, he owed something to the
mad professor.</p>

<hr>

<p>It was a warm and balmy night in the beautiful town of
Cambridge, and the celebrated nuclear physicist, Dr. von
Bressen, with a long string of letters after his name, was lying
back luxuriously in a comfortable big deck-chair just under the
window of the summer-house across the lawn, in Canon Drew's
large and high-walled garden.</p>

<p>He was smoking a good cigar and had several more in the case
in his pocket. With a newspaper upon his knee and an interesting
detective novel lying handy for when he wanted it, he was in
that satisfied and happy frame of mind which follows upon a good
dinner in its first stages of digestion.</p>

<p>Of real Teutonic appearance, stout and well-rounded with a
short neck and bullet-shaped head and hanging flabby cheeks, he
looked all over a man who would appreciate the good things in
life.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt he had had a good dinner, as good
almost, he told himself, as if there were no such things as
rations, and the agreeable taste of everything was still
lingering upon his palate. A plate of rich pea-soup, a good
helping of a tender chicken which had been sent in as a present
from a kind-hearted old Don whom he happened to have met in the
laboratory in the University, plenty of delicious gravy and
bread-sauce, roast potatoes and the best part of a whole dish of
cabbage. To top off the meal there had been apple-pie and a
generous slab of well-matured cheese. For drink there had been a
large bottle of good beer.</p>

<p>He lay back smiling at his own thoughts. Of a truth those
English were mad! Here was he, who had killed as many of their
sons and brothers and fathers as he possibly could, and would
kill as many more if ever he got the chance, living practically
unrationed while they themselves were almost starving along upon
half-filled unsatisfied bellies!</p>

<p>Yes, they were mad, and he had always hated them! Had it not
always seemed to be their mission in the happenings of the world
to stand between his great fatherland and the proving that his
children were verily the master-race?</p>

<p>His memory harked back to when as a young lieutenant he had
fought against them in the first World War, and he grinned that
it certainly would not look well if all he had done then were
put down in cold black and white. He had never been one to
encourage those under his command to take prisoners if they
could get out of it, and he remembered how, when there were none
of his superior officers about, many a quick bayonet thrust had
saved a lot of inconvenience if rations were coming up tardily
to the front line.</p>

<p>He recalled, too, certain other happenings when he had been
in France. By thunder, some of these French girls had been as
pretty as anyone could want, and what did it matter a bit of
rough handling and a few tears? They should have been proud of
his attentions and consider it an honour if by good fortune they
came to have a baby by him. Ah, they were great days then, and
he never regretted anything he had done!</p>

<p>Then, in the last war, though he had certainly taken no part
in the actual fighting, he had nevertheless strained every nerve
so that his great country could win the race for the atom bomb.
At work in those hidden laboratories in Peenemeunde he had not
spared himself any hour of the day or night, with his hatred
against the allies becoming accentuated with every bomb they
dropped upon the beautiful cities of the Third Reich.</p>

<p>Still, he had once been most foolish and a lightly spoken but
very stupid remark about the Fuehrer had resulted in his being
thrown into a concentration camp. However, he had only said what
he did because it happened he was in an evil temper that day and
let his tongue outrun his discretion.</p>

<p>Of course, coming as he himself did from a noble family in
East Prussia and steeped as he always had been in the proud
traditions of his class, it was only natural he should resent
their being ruled by Adolf Hitler, a man as common in origin as
any menial in the Third Reich.</p>

<p>Certainly, he had always admired the way the Fuehrer had
broken every promise he had made and ignored every solemn treaty
when it was to his country's interest to do so, but it had
always galled him when he thought of this one-time corporal
barking out his orders to the General Staff, many of whom were
German noblemen of long and distinguished ancestry.</p>

<p>So, when upon that particular morning he had been engaged
upon some very intricate problem and not wanted to be disturbed,
he knew he had lost his temper when the latest photograph of the
Fuehrer had been brought round to be admired.</p>

<p>"Take it away," he had shouted. "He looks like a monkey on a
stick."</p>

<p>Of course, immediately after he had spoken he had wished he
hadn't said it, for he knew it would be reported. So two nights
later he had not been surprised when he had been dragged from
his bed and, handcuffed like some dirty Jew, thrust among some
thousands of others in an enclosure surrounded by electrified
barbed wire.</p>

<p>Oh, how he had suffered there! Cold and wet, horrible and
scanty food, no proper sanitation, and shouted at and whipped by
young criminal toughs who had been released from the prisons to
be the camp guards!</p>

<p>Ten dreadful weeks he had spent there and then had come the
disaster to Peenemeunde, a terrible one because they had been so
near to the harnessing of the atom bomb which almost certainly
would have meant their winning the war. When everyone had
thought the very existence of all those wonderful laboratories
upon that lonely stretch of the Baltic coast was a secret
unknown to the Allies, one night over had come a thousand
bombers, and within one single hour every building had been
razed to the ground and more than five thousand most highly
skilled workers killed.</p>

<p>Certainly, the Allies had paid dearly, as it had cost them
thirty-nine bombers and the loss of more than three hundred of
their crack Air Force men, but the blow had been a stunning one
for the Third Reich and, no wonder, as he had heard afterwards,
it had almost driven the Fuehrer out of his mind.</p>

<p>Still, as far as he, Carl von Bressen had been concerned it
had had its bright side, as he had been immediately released
from the concentration camp and put to his beloved work again.
With so many eminent nuclear physicists killed, they could not
do without him.</p>

<p>Another thing, too. When the war was over and lost, the
record of his having been in a concentration camp had convinced
these pig British that he had been a hater of the Nazi regime,
with the result that they were now employing him and make his
life run upon such comfortable and pleasant lines.</p>

<p>His so happy frame of mind following upon his good dinner had
made him feel sleepy, and he dozed off deliciously for quite a
long time. When he woke up again the garden was all in darkness,
except for the electric light behind him and the faint new moon
in the sky. He lit another cigar and picking up the newspaper
started to read.</p>

<p>And at that moment a dark figure, as noiseless as a shadow,
was dropping from the roof of the tool-shed into the garden.</p>

<p>Clad in dark overalls and wearing rubber-soled shoes, upon
alighting to the ground, for several minutes Leon Mangan, for it
was he, stood as still as a graven image, taking in all his
surroundings. His heart was beating quickly.</p>

<p>Across the lawn, about thirty paces from him he saw the
German lying back in the deck-chair, with the rays from the
electric light behind him making his surroundings the only
bright spot in the dark garden. A few paces nearer and he would
have been a tempting shot. Indeed, even now, Mangan felt pretty
sure he would be able to hit him in the head. But no, he told
himself, with so much at stake he must take as few risks as
possible and it was worrying him that he did not know where the
detective was. Certainly, a light was showing from one of the
ground floor windows at the end of the house, but he rather
thought it must be the kitchen and if so, it meant the two maids
had not yet gone to bed. However, they would probably be going
soon, as he had just heard some church clock strike ten.</p>

<p>He melted into the shadows of a belt of trees to make his way
round the garden and get to the back of the summer-house.
Feeling no trace of nervousness now, he was thrilled with the
adventure. It was his old French Resistance days over again and
it might almost be as if he were stalking an enemy sentry.</p>

<p>Calling up every scrap of his Commando training, he planted
every footstep with the softness of a cat. The trees were old
and big and he slipped behind them, one by one, without the
slightest sound.</p>

<p>When half-way round the garden, however, all of a sudden his
very blood seemed to almost freeze in his veins, for he had
smelt the smell of burning tobacco. On the instant he had
realised it was not smoke wafted from the German's cigar. It was
either cigarette smoke or that from a pipe, and it seemed to be
coming from somewhere very close to him. He flattened himself
behind the trunk of a big tree and, breathlessly, inch by inch,
moved his head very slowly round.</p>

<p>Then, with all his self-control, he nearly uttered a starded
exclamation, as his amazed eyes fell upon the outline of the dim
figure of a man, leaning against a tree not half a dozen paces
from where he himself was standing, a silent, meditative figure,
puffing slowly at a cigarette. It did not take him two seconds
to realise it was that of the detective guarding the man, he,
Mangan, was intending to murder.</p>

<p>With his heart in his mouth, for the moment he was minded to
draw back into the shadows and get out of the garden as quickly
as he could. He would have to try again another night!</p>

<p>Then the spirit of the Commando stirred in him, and the
memories of just such other nights surged up riotously into his
mind, those warm and scented nights in Southern France when he
and his little band of partisans had crept down from their
fastness in the Auvergne Mountains and dealt out silent death to
many a sleeping German.</p>

<p>His heart calmed down, and everything about him became as
steady as a rock. This man near him should die too, die as had
so many others at his hands, without a cry, without a moan,
without even a sigh. Once he got his fingers about his neck he
would make no sound again.</p>

<p>His thoughts came like lightning. But he could not grapple
with him with his back against a tree! He must get him into the
open and, preferably, in the attitude of bending down. A
moment's hesitation, and his right hand dropped stealthily on to
the ground. Without for one second taking his eyes off his
intended victim, he groped for a lump of earth and began
moulding it into a little ball. The earth under the trees was
soft and easy to manipulate.</p>

<p>The ball ready, very slowly he straightened himself up and
flipped it to a few feet to the left of the man leaning against
the tree. The ball rustled among the leaves. The man heard it
and Mangan saw him give a slight start. A few seconds later he
stepped away a couple of paces or so from the tree and bent down
as if he were searching on the ground to see what had disturbed
him.</p>

<p>His back was now towards Mangan, and the latter, in a
lightning movement, sprang upon him from behind and, gripping
his neck fiercely with both hands, dug his fingers deeply into
the soft flesh on either side of the throat. At the same time he
forced him violently face downwards on to the ground.</p>

<p>With Mangan now astride his back and his arms pinioned by
Mangan's knees, the man could do nothing but struggle
ineffectively with his legs. He could utter no cry and he could
not breathe. He was in the dreadful carotid hold. Now of all
holds the carotid is one of the most deadly, as it cuts off all
supply of blood to the heart by pressure in an extreme degree
upon the great carotid arteries in the neck. The heart is
thereby put out of action at once.</p>

<p>In a little over a minute the detective had passed into
unconsciousness and ceased to struggle. In less than three he
was dead.</p>

<p>With his breath coming in great gasps from his exertions,
Mangan rose staggeringly to his feet and dragged the body deep
among the trees. Then, for the first time since he had caught
sight of the detective, he looked towards the deck-chair under
the light. The German was still reading his newspaper. Obviously
he had heard nothing!</p>

<p>Mangan wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve and
squatted down upon the ground to recover his breath. A fierce
exhilaration thrilled through him. The savagery of the animal
was possessing him. He had tasted blood again and he was back in
his jungle days.</p>

<p>Very quickly recovering from his exertions, he considered
what he must next do. He saw the light in the house suddenly go
out. Good! Then he and the German had the garden all to
themselves, and there was no need for any frantic hurry now.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later he was crouching a few paces
behind the deck chair. The doctor was now engrossed in the
reading of his book, and his interest in it was so great that he
was puffing unconsciously upon a cigar that long since had gone
dead and cold.</p>

<p>Now the more thoughtful among us in our meditative moments
are so often realising the strange happenings that are going on
all round, but surely none could have been more strange than
what was now happening to Dr. Carl von Bressen in that still and
silent garden surrounded by the high wall.</p>

<p>There he was, all unknowingly threatened with a most dreadful
form of death, and its coming to him was being delayed minute by
minute simply because he was wanting to finish the last pages of
a detective story. Though the hour was getting very late, he
felt he must read on until he learned if the police found out
who was really the murderer.</p>

<p>And all the time <i>his</i> murderer was crouching just
behind him in deeply cursing irritation at the delay. Eleven had
struck long ago and there was no certainty that midnight would
not strike, too, before the German got out of his chair.</p>

<p>The killing of the detective having been so silently
accomplished, Mangan was now minded to get his second victim in
the same way. Yet he could do nothing as long as the latter
remained in his chair. With a short neck such as his, the matter
would not be one of the best propositions at any time, and he
must get right behind him to be certain of success.</p>

<p>The minutes passed and passed, and it seemed to the impatient
watcher that the scientist would never finish his story. At
last, however, he slapped the book to with a deep sigh and
heaved himself slowly from his chair. He was most disappointed
that the police had caught the murderer, as he was a damned
clever fellow and deserved to get away!</p>

<p>He yawned deeply and, with a pleasurable anticipation of the
comfortable bed awaiting him, picked up his chair and, carrying
it into the summer-house, placed it against some others there
and proceeded to switch off the light. Turning to make his way
back to the house, he had not, however, taken half a dozen steps
before&mdash;the avalanche descended.</p>

<p>It was soon over, with the garden wrapped in complete
stillness once again.</p>

<p>Never more would Carl von Bressen gloat over his many crimes,
never more would he chuckle in fond memory over the pretty
French girls he had molested, and never more would he eat pork
chops or read exciting detective stories. Passing forever into
the shades, a brave soldier and with all the lust of his race
for battle strong within him, he would soon be among the meek he
had always so despised for inheriting the earth, only as they
did&mdash;in coffins.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Mangan, now wearing a pair of black
gloves and with a little pocket torch to light his way, was
prowling round the lower rooms of the canon's house. Mindful
that he had heard from the professor that the reverend gentleman
was something of a collector of art treasures, he was wondering
if there might not be some small portable article he would be
able to pocket and take away.</p>

<p>To his annoyance, however, he found two of the rooms were
locked up, and he told himself he could not tempt fortune
further by breaking into them. If the maids became aware of any
suspicious noises, it was possible they might come down to find
out what they meant. Then, if any outcries were made, they might
be heard in the house in the adjoining garden. No, it was not
worth the risk! He would get away quickly while the going was
good.</p>

<p>However, coming to a small room where the door was ajar, he
stepped inside and flashed his light round where the German and
the detective were accustomed to have their meals, as the table
was laid for the breakfast upon the morrow for two. The room was
comfortably furnished and upon one side of the wall a row of
etchings were hanging from a high picture-rail above. He knew
very little about the value of etchings and passed them by, but
his light happening to flash upon a small painting at the end of
the row, he moved up closer to look at it. It was only about
twelve inches by eighteen and, protected by a sheet of glass, it
depicted the sun setting upon a field of ripened corn. Its
delicacy and colouring were very beautiful.</p>

<p>Then he had almost to suppress a cry as he noted a small
silver plate attached to the bottom of the frame, upon which was
engraved "Jean Baptiste Corot, 1869."</p>

<p>"A genuine Corot," he gasped, "and probably one of his last
works! Why it may be worth many hundreds of pounds! Gad, what a
find!"</p>

<p>Jerking the wire of the little painting from off the
picture-rail, he took the Corot into his hands and, with more
excitement even than when brutal murder was filling all his
thoughts, proceeded to open the frame at the back and with great
care take out the canvas. One quick glance at its beauty, and he
rolled it up and pushed it under his waistcoat. The empty frame
he pushed well behind a heavy sideboard.</p>

<p>Then, so that the absence of the painting should not be
noticed at once, he stood upon a chair and with the poker from
the grate sidled the echings along the rail until, with a little
more space between each of them, the whole space on the wall was
filled.</p>

<p>Next, with no more delay, he left the house and, returning by
the same way he had come, made all haste to where he had left
his car. To his relief he found it had not been interfered
with.</p>

<p>Well started upon his journey back to London, he had,
however, gone barely a dozen miles and had just passed through
Royston when, about to cross a bridge spanning a small and
shallow stream, he got a blow-out in one of his back tyres.</p>

<p>Cursing angrily, not because of any fear of pursuit as he
felt quite safe there, but because the job was going to be a
dirty one, he sprang out of his car and started to put on the
spare wheel. He had got as far as struggling to get it into its
place when, by the headlights of his car, he saw a man
approaching upon a bicycle, and it did not take him two seconds
to grasp that the arrival was a patrolling constable.</p>

<p>"Let me help you, sir," said the constable, alighting from
his machine and propping it up against the wall of the bridge so
that the rays of the lamp fell straight upon Mangan's face. He
stared hard and then exclaimed smilingly, "Oh, but I know you
very well by sight, sir! You live near Fitzroy Square, don't
you, and garage your car at Tom Pike's there? I've seen you
often when I've been passing, and I never forget a face. You
see, sir, I've only been down here for a few weeks. Before that
I was stationed at the police station in Euston Road and, living
in Cleveland Street, used often to pass through Fitzroy Square
to go on duty." He added quickly, "Cut yourself, have you, sir?"
and he pointed to what were obviously bloodstains upon Mangan's
wrist and the back of his right hand.</p>

<p>Mangan cursed again. The German doctor's nose had bled and
drenched Mangan's hand and sleeve, but he thought he had wiped
it all off on the grass afterwards.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing," he said quickly, "just a scratch."</p>

<p>The new wheel was soon put in position and the obliging
constable proceeded to screw up the bolts. Pumping some air into
the tyre, he let down the jack. Then, deciding more air was
needed, he asked Mangan for his tyre-gauge and, the pressure
being found to be not high enough, he resorted to the pump
again.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mangan had been thinking hard, realising to
the full how very awkward the meeting with this policeman might
turn out to be. He knew quite well that later there would be
searching and far-reaching enquiries about all motorists who had
been seen upon the roads near Cambridge about midnight. The
police would be able to determine pretty accurately about what
time the murders had been committed in the garden, as it could
only have been not long before the two murdered men were
accustomed to go to bed.</p>

<p>Hell, then this interfering policeman would at once bark out
about his encounter with him, Mangan, upon the road so near to
Cambridge! He would be able to describe both him and his car
and, worst still, tell whereabouts he lived. Oh, hell again; he
would remember his bloodied wrist, too!</p>

<p>Mangan did not hesitate long in making up his mind what he
must do. Already, it had been a night of violence for him and
another murder, weighed against his own safety, was as nothing
to him.</p>

<p>With his teeth clenched tightly together, in a furtive
movement he picked up the heavy jack and struck with a terrific
blow upon the back of the policeman's head. The latter sank down
like a staggered ox and, snatching up the body Mangan dropped it
over the bridge into the shallow stream below. In a few seconds
the bicycle followed and now, in feverish haste, after grabbing
up the tools spread about upon the ground, Mangan sprang into
the car and started to resume his interrupted journey to Town.
Cool and collected and with his wits about him, he turned out of
the main road into the first byroad he came to, and in due
course reached London by a long detour through Bishop's
Stortford.</p>

<p>The next day being Sunday, the woman who looked after his
flat did not put in an appearance, and it was not until
mid-afternoon that Mangan had had his bath and dressed. He had no
intention of going to the professor to claim his reward until
the way he had successfully carried out his full mission of
murder appeared in the daily newspapers and that, possibly, he
expected might not be for two or three days.</p>

<p>However, the next morning he read in <i>The Daily
Megaphone</i> that at some hour late on the previous Saturday
night a most brutal murder had been committed upon the main
Cambridge-London road near Royston. The news had come in just
before the paper had gone to press as the paragraph was in
consequence very brief. It stated, however, that a patrolling
constable had apparently been knocked down and killed by a
motor-car, with his body as well as the bicycle being afterwards
thrown over a bridge into the stream below. It added the usual
statement that the police were investigating the matter. The
inquest was to be held that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mangan was rather puzzled there was nothing in the paper
about any happening to the German scientist and the detective,
but supposed for some reason of their own the authorities were
deliberately withholding everything there. He was quite
confident, however, that they would not be able to keep silence
for long and looked forward with pleasurable anticipation to
what the evening papers would contain.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was no disappointment there, as the
following day the <i>Evening Cry</i> in its early afternoon
edition put forward a thrilling story under big headlines,
recording that Dr. Carl von Bressen, the great nuclear
physicist, along with Inspector Barwell, the well-known Scotland
Yard detective who had been specially detailed to look after
him, had been kidnapped on the Saturday night from the house in
Cambridge where they had been staying and no clue had as yet
been picked up to give any indication to where they had been
taken.</p>

<p><i>The Evening Cry</i> went on that, as was known to
everyone, the eminent scientist had been brought from Frankfurt
to give what service he could to the British authorities and had
been working in the University laboratories in Cambridge. Quite
aware there was a lot of resentment among certain people that a
former enemy should now be being employed by the Government, an
inspector of long experience had been detailed to keep a strict
watch over him and never leave his side.</p>

<p>Installed in a suite of rooms in Canon Drew's house in
Trumpington Road, the doctor and the inspector had been residing
there for upwards of six weeks and both had appeared to be well
satisfied with their treatment and surroundings. Canon Drew and
his family were not in residence, having gone up to Scotland on
a holiday, but two maids had been left in charge to look after
the visitors and up to the previous Saturday evening everything
had been as uneventful as could be.</p>

<p>Then, after his dinner the doctor, as was his custom upon
warm evenings, had retired to the garden to smoke and read in a
deckchair near the summer-house, while the inspector had sat on
reading in the room where they had had their meal. That was how
things had been until the maids went off to bed at their usual
time of half past ten.</p>

<p>The night had passed quite quietly and the maids had heard no
noises or cries. As had been arranged, the next morning
breakfast was served at exactly nine o'clock and, as the two men
were always so punctual in their habits, the maid who carried in
the hot dishes and the tea was rather surprised not to find them
already waiting in the room.</p>

<p>Wondering if they had overslept themselves, she knocked at
both their doors&mdash;the rooms were adjoining&mdash;but to her
great surprise obtained no answer from either of them. Returning
into the kitchen and consulting her fellow servant, the two of
them together went back to the bedrooms and after more
ineffectual knocking ventured to open the doors. To their
amazement they found both rooms were empty and the beds had not
been slept in.</p>

<p>Aware of the importance of the German doctor, they were now
thoroughly alarmed and went to the telephone at once to ring up
the Cambridge police station. Finding the line was dead, they
opened the gate in the drive with their key and running round to
the people next door implored them to get in touch with the
police with the least possible delay.</p>

<p>The police arrived in a few minutes and at once took a very
grave view of the matter. Undoubtedly the two men had not gone
away upon their own accords, but had been forcibly taken off.
Their hats and overcoats had been left behind and, moreover, the
doctor was wearing carpet slippers and the inspector indoor
shoes. To confirm everything their car was in the garage.</p>

<p>A thorough search was made everywhere, but no light was
thrown upon the disappearances. They were certainly most
mysterious, as there were no signs of any struggle anywhere,
everything seemed to be quite in order and, apparently, nothing
was missing from the house.</p>

<p><i>The Evening Cry</i> finished up by declaring it was not
likely the matter would remain a mystery for long as, with the
police combing the whole country, it was highly improbable the
two men could be kept hidden away for an indefinite period of
time.</p>

<p>Mangan chuckled in great amusement as he went through the
article. Of course it would be no good approaching the professor
yet, as he was quite certain a kidnapping would not satisfy him
and he would refuse to cash up with the rest of the promised
money. So he, Mangan, must wait until the police had found out a
bit more and, with the hot weather now prevailing, he thought
with a grin that should be very soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime the professor was in a perfect fever of
exasperadon. Kidnapping was not what he had wanted! What was the
good of that, as the men were bound to be found soon? He would
not pay Mangan a penny more! He wondered why the latter was now
keeping away from him and wondered also if the killing of that
policeman upon the Cambridge road were his work as well!</p>

<p>Two days passed with no more information about the missing
men, but on the Thursday the evening newspapers stirred
themselves up to great excitement with shocking news.</p>

<p>Their bodies had been found! They had been lying all the time
in the summer-house in the garden and there was all evidence the
two men had met with dreadful deaths!</p>

<p>They had been throttled!</p>

<p>It appeared that with the gates in the drive now being kept
open during the day, a grocer had driven his van right up to the
house and, while he was engaged in talking to the maids, the fox
terrier who always accompanied him upon his rounds had wandered
into the garden and, with the lively curiosity of his breed,
started sniffing about everywhere.</p>

<p>Suddenly the little animal had begun to bark vociferously and
refusing the orders of his master to come back to the van the
grocer had gone to see what the barking was about.</p>

<p>The dog was in the summer-house and greatly excited at
something he had found. He had pushed his way in behind a big
pile of deckchairs and was continuing to bark for all he was
worth. The grocer bent down to pull him out and at once, as he
told the reporters later, his nostrils were assailed with a
horrible sickly odour and he saw a foot in a carpet slipper
poking out.</p>

<p>At once starting to pull the chairs away, his horrified eyes
fell upon two bodies, one on top of the other, pushed close
against the wall.</p>

<p>Almost, as he said, terrified out of his wits, he rushed back
into the house and got on the telephone, which had now been put
right, to summon the police. The police arrived in furious haste
and at once saw what, hardened as they were to gruesome things,
was in a fair way to make them retch.</p>

<p>The newspapers continued that surely never in all the annals
of black crime had two more dreadful murders been committed, as
even to the untrained and most casual observer there could not
be the slightest doubt as to how they had died.</p>

<p>The professor was about to start upon his evening meal when
the newspaper was brought to him, and for the moment what he
read so unnerved him that he had to get up from the table and
mix himself a stiff brandy and soda. His face had gone a putty
colour and his hands were so trembling that it was with
difficulty he could bring the glass to his lips.</p>

<p>"Gad, but what a devil I have raised," he choked, "and
there'll be all hell to pay if he's found out! He'll go for me
next, too, if I anger him," and tottering over to his desk he
took out a little automatic and, making sure it was fully
loaded, put it into one of the side pockets of his jacket.</p>

<p>The brandy steadied him a lot and he smiled a sickly smile.
"But it is only what I wanted," he whispered, "and I can't
complain. No, if I give him his money everything will be quite
all right. He's escaped so far, and so he's not likely to be
caught now."</p>

<p>He returned to his meal and a small bottle of old claret on
the top of the stiff brandy he had given himself soon began to
restore his confidence.</p>

<p>"And he'll come to-night for the money," he told himself.
"He's only been waiting until it was all in the newspapers." He
chuckled. "But, oh, what a nerve he's got! I couldn't have
picked upon a better man."</p>

<p>All the time he kept listening for the ringing of the front
door bell. To his great disappointment, however, it did not
ring, neither that evening nor the ensuing one either. Mangan's
coming had been delayed by a slight attack of influenza and,
always anxious about his health, he had kept to his bed until
the temperature had gone down. So it was not until the Saturday
evening that he put in an appearance at the professor's flat to
claim the reward. He was all smiles as he took the professor's
rather nervously proffered hand.</p>

<p>"Well, are you satisfied?" he asked. "Did I make a good job
of it?"</p>

<p>"Excellent," exclaimed the professor, "and I've got the money
all ready for you as you asked in £5 banknotes. Now tell me all
about it?" and Mangan proceeded to relate what had happened.</p>

<p>"I had to deal with that detective," he said, "as
unfortunately for himself he had got in my way. Still, I never
expected that the bodies would have remained undiscovered for so
long and had only reckoned upon their not being found until the
next day. The deckchairs were only just propped up over them and
the police must have been most casual in their search."</p>

<p>"But it was a very clever idea of yours," said the professor,
"to think of putting them there." An anxious look came into his
face. "But are you sure you left no trails behind?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure," nodded Mangan. "Had I left any, they would have
been followed up long before this."</p>

<p>"And that policeman who was killed by the bridge?" smiled the
professor slyly. "I guess that was your work, too?"</p>

<p>Mangan shook his head. He had no intention of letting the
professor know too much. "No, I didn't come home that way. I
went a long way round by way of Huntingdon and Bedford. I was
taking as few risks as possible."</p>

<p>The professor looked very pleased. "Well, we'll just lie low
for a week or two and then you'll go for that other German, Otto
Bernstein."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Mangan quickly. "Not him for much longer than
that. He'll be far too well guarded after what's happened to his
colleague. We must let the excitement die down."</p>

<p>For the moment the professor looked very disappointed but
then his face brightened. "Well, if not him," he said, "you can
put paid to that Professor Rodney. He's another vicious brute,
an enemy to all human kind."</p>

<p>"What's <i>he</i> done?" asked Mangan.</p>

<p>"More atom bomb work," nodded the professor, "and he's
insulted me as well. He's an old enemy of mine. Now come to me
again in a few days. By then I'll have everything cut and dried
with the easiest way of getting him with no risk at all." He
rubbed his hands together delightedly. "Gad, man, don't you
realise we are making history, you and I. We shall be among the
immortals one day. In years to come the world will put us up on
pedestals and regard us as white-souled humanitarians, who at
all risks to themselves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here, you cut that out," broke in Mangan savagely. "Don't
you take in that if we're found out we shall both be hanged for
it? It's no time for gloating over what's been done. So blot it
out of your memory. Forget all about it and, whatever you do,
never start talking about it with your friends." He spoke
sharply and with some uneasiness in his tones. "You haven't
discussed it with anyone yet, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed the professor rather crestfallen. "As
with you, I have had a bad cold and haven't been out of the flat
this week. No, I've seen no one to talk to."</p>

<p>"Well, when you do," said Mangan with the utmost sternness,
"you'll be the damnedest fool in the world if you bring it up,
for you won't be able to prevent their seeing how pleased you
are, and they may get suspicious that you've had a hand in it.
Don't forget that letter you wrote to <i>The Times</i> when you
practically said that anyone who killed any worker upon the atom
bombs would be only committing justifiable homicide."</p>

<p>The professor looked uncomfortable. "Of course, I didn't know
then what was going to happen," he excused himself, "but I see
now it was a foolish letter for me to write."</p>

<p>"It certainly was," snapped Mangan, "and after your having
broadcast such peculiar views my wonder is the police haven't
been round to you already to ask some awkward questions." He
regarded the puny little man before him and repressed a grin.
"One thing in your favour is that the men were not shot, for if
they had been the police might easily have been suspicious that
you killed them yourself." A thought seemed to strike him and he
asked frowningly, "But tell me&mdash;have you ever heard of
anyone called Gilbert Larose?"</p>

<p>"Of course I have," replied the professor. "As a matter of
fact I know him quite well. He lives at Carmel Abbey, only a few
miles away from the bungalow of mine in Norfolk. But why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied Mangan, "I saw in one of the papers
yesterday that he had been a friend of that Inspector Barwell
and had sworn he would find out who killed him. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He's nothing now," said the professor, "because about
fifteen or sixteen years ago he married a very rich woman and
all he does is to look after her estate. However, years ago he
was a detective at Scotland Yard and probably he knew the
inspector then."</p>

<p>"Poof," scoffed Mangan, "only a policeman!"</p>

<p>The professor frowned uneasily. "Ah, but he was far more than
that! He was their star crime investigator and, undoubtedly the
best man they had ever had. They used to say he could pick up
clues which no one else saw and always managed to get his man in
the end. Yes, he's a most dangerous party for anyone to have
against him."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" snapped Mangan. "At any rate, for certain he'll
never worry me. If there was anything to find out he'd have
certainly found it before now. No, I'm quite safe, and so are
you if you keep your trap shut."</p>

<p>However, when Mangan had gone off, the professor was still
frowning uneasily. He didn't altogether like that news about
Larose and to find out if there was anything in the wind must
certainly have a little chat with the one-time detective. It
should not be difficult. He'd pretend to be passing his way one
day and drop in with a few oysters. Larose was a chatty fellow
and always ready for a yarn.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>

LAROSE PICKS UP THE TRAIL</h2>

<p class="first">THE day following upon the one when he had
received his payment from the professor Mangan smiled a cold,
grim smile when he read in the newspapers that the loss of the
Corot painting had been discovered. It had not been done by
either of the two maids but by Canon Drew himself who had come
down from Scotland upon a flying visit to his house and,
noticing at once that the painting was gone, had immediately
informed the police.</p>

<p>Mangan was not surprised. He had anticipated it and, always
shrewd and far-seeing, was realising that his possession of the
painting was the one weak spot in his armour and which, if it
became known, would be a most damnable piece of evidence,
pointing direct to him as the double murderer.</p>

<p>He often wished he had left it alone, and several times was
minded to burn it. However, each time he took it out of the
drawer in which he had locked it, its delicate loveliness so
appealed to him that he put it back there again with no
hesitation at all. Still, he told himself frowningly, he would
have to do something about it and do that something soon, if
only to give him peace of mind. Though he had scoffed boldly at
all the professor had told him about Gilbert Larose, some
enquiries he had made at one of his clubs had been anything but
reassuring.</p>

<p>Talking to some of the older members, he found they knew all
about the one-time detective and were quite agreeable to recall
old memories of the wonderful things he had done when in the
Criminal Investigation Department at Scotland Yard. One
loquacious old colonel in particular was most enthusiastic.</p>

<p>"Generally, he used to work all by himself," he said, "and
for the time take no one into his confidence. Say a murder had
been committed somewhere and not the slightest clue found. The
public would grumble and swear at the police, but with the
interest gradually dying down. Weeks and even months might pass,
and then suddenly one morning everyone would start at seeing in
their paper big headlines, 'Suspect committed for trial for the
so-and-so murder.' 'Larose gets his man again.'"</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" sneered Mangan. "He must have been a remarkable
man."</p>

<p>"He was," agreed the old colonel, "for all along like an old
and well-trained bloodhound he'd been nosing up the trail,
following tracks invisible to everybody else."</p>

<p>"Probably he'd had luck," smiled Mangan. "Most likely that
was all."</p>

<p>The colonel shook his head. "No, no, it wasn't luck. It was
all due to his great gift of imagination. As I tell you, his
ways were so different from those of any other detective. It
used to be said that, right off in the very beginning of a case
he would put himself in the murderer's place and go back step by
step along the way he had come." He held up his hand to
emphasise his point. "So, if as they say he's now helping the
police to find out who killed that German scientist and the
detective who was supposed to be guarding him, I'd like to bet
any money that he's spent hours in that garden where the two men
were killed, in the darkness and at the same time of night as it
all happened, just sitting still and thinking"&mdash;he
laughed&mdash;"and maybe calling up the ghosts of the dead men
to help him. Oh, yes, he was wonderful in his way, this chap,
and I shouldn't like him to be after me now."</p>

<p>Mangan felt positively angry at what he stigmatised as the
old colonel's childishness. "Old wives' tales," he commented
disgustedly. "From what you tell me one could imagine he had
radar leading him direct to the criminal."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it!" exclaimed the colonel triumphantly. "You've
put it in a nutshell. His imagination was the radar which was
guiding him."</p>

<p>Now Mangan, though as iconoclastic and hard-boiled a man as
could be found anywhere, had yet a hidden streak of superstition
in him, and there could be no doubt that for a few days he was
decidedly perturbed about Gilbert Larose. However, with the days
and weeks passing and all the excitement about the Cambridge
murders dying down, with no further mention of them appearing in
the newspapers, he gradually recovered his nerve and became as
confident as he ever had been that he was perfectly safe. He
thrilled, too, at the exciting thought that he was so greatly a
wanted man, a veritable little "Shadow Band" all by himself,
with everyone stretching out their hands to catch him and yet
with him being safe and untroubled in their very midst.</p>

<p>Accordingly, with the intention of keeping up this
pleasurable mystery and excitement his thoughts were soon
reverting to the professor's suggestions of executing more
commissions for him. He was the more inclined to carry out the
professor's wishes now, because it happened he was wanting a
large sum of money rather badly.</p>

<p>Firstly, his partner, Wardale, with the plea of ill health,
was anxious to dispose of his half of the business in Wardour
Street. Although he did not say so, Mangan was very pleased
about it, because, from meeting him often at the sales, he,
Mangan, had become very friendly with another dealer who had a
snug little business just off Hanover Square. This dealer was
getting old and wanted to retire, too, but the sum he was
demanding for the goodwill and stock of the business was the
staggering one of £10,000.</p>

<p>Still, Mangan had gone through his books and realised the
price was quite a moderate one, as the man had many wealthy
customers and his turnover was a large one. So Mangan's idea was
to buy out his Wardour Street partner as cheaply as he could by
beating him down, and then get rid of the whole concern there
altogether. He reckoned he would have no difficulty, having
already in his mind's eye a probable purchaser.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he approached the professor and expressed his
willingness to carry out another commission. The professor was
delighted, though at the back of his mind he still harboured
something of a lingering fear about Larose. He mentioned him
again to Mangan.</p>

<p>"But I don't think he's doing much to help the police," he
said. "though I <i>do</i> know he's been once to Scotland Yard
to have a long conflab with his old friend, Chief Inspector
Stone. I learned that from my housekeeper who's got a brother, a
sergeant in the police force. However, I made an excuse to call
in and see Larose a couple of weeks ago at Carmel Abbey, his
place in Norfolk, and came away with the impression that he
wasn't much interested in the matter. Upon my bringing round the
conversation to what has happened, he just laughed and remarked
that most people were thinking one German less in the world so
much the better. No, I don't think we need worry about him."</p>

<p>"I never did," commented Mangan scornfully. "I don't believe
a word of any of the tall stories they tell about him."</p>

<p>"Still," frowned the professor a trifle doubtfully, "I'll
keep in touch with him and find out if he's much away from home
just now. You see, he's a most conceited fellow and would just
love to succeed where the police have failed." A sudden thought
came to him and he snapped his fingers together. "Ah&mdash;it's
funny, but I remember I saw him yesterday in the Strand, walking
along with a man I know well by sight and one, too, I'd very
much like you to get hold of. I only saw them for a few moments
as I was passing by on the top of a bus."</p>

<p>"Who was the man," frowned Mangan, "from Scotland Yard?"</p>

<p>The professor shook his head. "No, he's a Captain Iver
Selwyn. He was a Secret Service agent during the war, one of the
most trusted as he was head of all the British Intelligence
working inside Germany." He nodded. "It happens that by chance I
came to learn a great secret about him. He was a capsule man,
that is, he'd undergone a slight operation and had a glass
capsule of cyanide of potassium embedded in the flesh underneath
the top of his left arm. Then, if he had been caught by the
Germans, so that he should not be made to disclose by torture
who the other agents were, all he had to do was to strike
himself a hard blow over the glass capsule and it would break
and he'd be dead in less than a minute. They say he was given a
£5,000 gratuity after the war."</p>

<p>"But if he's still in the Secret Service," said Mangan rather
testily, "he's not likely to be interested in what has happened
to von Bressen."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't he?" exclaimed the professor. "I'm not so sure
there, as they may be thinking it was the work of someone
employed by the Baltic Embassy, and you know how envious the
Baltics have always been about the atom bomb and how they would
like to hinder any work upon it." He took a paper out of his
wallet. "Well, never mind about Captain Selwyn now. We may try
to get him later. For the moment I've a much easier job for
you."</p>

<p>"Not Otto Bernstein?" queried Mangan with a frown. "He won't
be easy."</p>

<p>"No, not him," said the professor, "as for the moment I can't
find out where he is. He used to be staying in South Kensington,
but they whisked him away somewhere after von Bressen's death.
No, it's Professor Rodney you'll go for next. He's Professor of
Physical Science at Oxford, another of the damned atom bomb mob,
and I've made full enquiries about him. At present he's working
here in London in a laboratory somewhere in Hampstead and walks
home every evening by way of the Outer Circle by Regent's Park.
He passes there regularly a few minutes after six o'clock. The
Outer Circle is always fairly lonely, and I suggest you have a
shot at him when you're going by at a good speed in your
car."</p>

<p>"But how shall I know him?" asked Mangan.</p>

<p>"Very easily. He's got long white hair and walks with a
pronounced stoop. I think he's about sixty-three. But to be sure
you make no mistake about him you can see him at the pictures in
Hampstead every Saturday night. He goes to the Victoria Picture
Palace there and invariably sits in the very front row of the
stalls because he's rather deaf. Once you've seen him you'll
never forget him."</p>

<p>Then, in the ensuing weeks Mangan was well upon the way of
acquiring the whole £10,000 needed for the purchase of the
Hanover Street business, as he had carried out four more
murderous commissions with ridiculous ease. Still considerably
worried, however cunningly he was thinking he had hidden it,
about his possession of the Corot painting, and now more
embarrassed than ever by the large number of banknotes which the
professor had paid over to him, he resolved to take further
precautions for his safety.</p>

<p>If through some misfortune suspicion ever came to him,
nothing must be found to back up that suspicion, and how then,
he asked himself, even if he had burnt the incriminating
painting, would he be able to account satisfactorily for the
possession of all that money?</p>

<p>It would be ridiculous to attempt to hide the banknotes in
his flat; he dared not pay them into any bank; and placing them
in a safe deposit might turn out to be equally as dangerous.</p>

<p>Finally though, considering it risky in a different way and
with no liking for the idea, he decided to take everything to a
little shack which he had bought about a year previously on
Canvey Island, in the Thames Estuary. Of course, he realised he
would not be able to keep any proper watch on anything he left
there and was quite aware of the thousands and thousands of all
sorts of people who poured over the island at holiday times.
Still, he was reckoning that the shack was much too poor looking
for anyone to think it would be worth while breaking into. Then
if they <i>did,</i> apart from a few articles of tinned food, a
cheap camp bed, two chairs, some crockery, a few kitchen
utensils and a small paraffin stove would be all they would
find. The very cheapness of everything would never suggest that
anything of value could be be hidden there.</p>

<p>Having at last made his decision, he motored down to Benfleet
one dark evening and, leaving his car in a garage there, went on
foot the rest of the way to where his shack was, just under the
high sea wall. Shutting himself up inside, by the light only of
an electric torch so as not to attract attention, he buried both
the painting and the packet of banknotes a good two feet deep in
the sand under one of the floorboards. Everything was well
protected from the damp by being carefully wrapped round in a
groundsheet.</p>

<p>Returning without event to his flat in Fitzroy Square, he
breathed a great sigh of relief. At last he was quite safe and
free to enjoy the exciting life he was now leading.</p>

<p>Certainly he was enjoying his life. The danger of his
adventures thrilled him to the very core and the more the
newspapers howled for the uncovering of the murderer among them
the better he was pleased.</p>

<p>And there was no doubt he had ample grounds for pleasure
there, as the public had been worked up into a state of frenzy
that the police had not been able to discover anything. Murder
after murder had been committed, they averred, with the
authorities apparently standing idly by.</p>

<p>"What has happened to us?" shrieked the <i>Daily
Megaphone</i> in its most yellow style. "Is it to be taken for
granted that we all have to live in a land where law and order
no longer prevail? Are we always to be at the mercy of a
murderer who strikes unhindered where and when he wills? Six
bloody crimes within three months and their perpetrator walking
unconcerned in our very midst!"</p>

<p>"To all appearances," it went on, "these assassinations are
all the work of one and the same man, and surely, from the
happenings of all six of them taken together, some clue should
have been picked up, something common to them all which should
lead unerringly to the assassin?"</p>

<p>"What is Scotland Yard doing? They say nothing, they tell us
nothing, and so we know nothing of what is going on! Now that is
not as things should be. The public are not all fools and to the
utmost extent they should be taken into the confidence of the
authorities, as in many ways they might be of help. For
instance, many might be acquainted with someone among them who
possesses all the qualifications of the assassin, a bold and
resolute individual of athletic build, very probably a returned
soldier, who is seemingly well to do, runs a good car and is
known to be in the possession of firearms. Possibly, he may not
be a man who makes many friends and is reserved and moody in his
disposition.</p>

<p>"Thousands among us may know of such a man and, once their
attention is focussed, scores of us may perhaps notice something
suspicious about him. At any rate the idea is worth trying, and
Scotland Yard should certainly broadcast an appeal for help.
Otherwise the community will continue to be at the mercy of this
human beast of prey who, emerging from his jungle hiding place,
leaves his dark trail of blood and violence behind him wherever
he goes."</p>

<p>Mangan scoffed in amusement. "Let them catch me if they can.
The proverbial searching for a needle in a bundle of hay!"</p>

<p>Still, at the back of his mind there was one uneasy doubt
that he would never be found out and that doubt had begun to
loom up larger and larger as the weeks had gone on. It was the
professor himself of whom he was now afraid.</p>

<p>He was not at all pleased with the mental state of his
half-crazy employer. The little man was now living in a constant
whirl of excitement and every time he, Mangan, saw him he
thought he seemed more unstable than ever. He couldn't keep
still half a minute at a time and jumped about as if he were on
springs, talking his head off all the while and exulting in the
great services he was doing to humanity. He talked so quickly,
too, that Mangan had to keep his distance to avoid the
splutterings as he spoke.</p>

<p>One thing, however, gave Mangan some satisfaction, and that
was that the cold nip in the autumn air had brought on the
professor's annual bronchitis, with his medical man not
permitting him to set foot out of doors. So, apparently he was
having no contact with any outside people.</p>

<p>Still, though when taxed he denied it emphatically, Mangan
felt almost certain that he had started upon writing his
threatened memoirs, and Mangan was most uneasy about what he
might be putting in them. Another thing, too, which was rather
disturbing. The silly little fool had got a thick scrapbook in
which he had pasted scores and scores of cuttings from the
newspapers, all dealing with the murders.</p>

<p>Mangan had pointed out angrily to him that, if because of his
so well-known unsocial views, the police ever came to interview
him or even perhaps to make a search of his flat, the collection
of all these cuttings would look very bad. After a lot of
persuasion the professor had promised to burn his scrapbook and
stop making any more such collections. However, Mangan did not
think much of his promise, believing him to have now become a
consummate little liar.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the professor had taken to drinking a
lot of champagne, and whenever Mangan appeared at the flat would
insist upon his sharing with him the contents of a large bottle.
He said, too, that he was now drinking it regularly with his
meals, as he found it was the only thing which would steady his
nerves. He added that he was taking it medicinally as a tonic
and upon the advice of his medical man, who had told him to
drink two bottles every day.</p>

<p>When Mangan frowningly hazarded the opinion that it was an
expensive tonic the professor only laughed. "I have plenty of
money," he said, "and never have to consider the expense. Yes,
it is certainly pretty costly. I am paying nearly £60 a
case."</p>

<p>So things were up to one evening when Mangan paid an
unexpected visit to the professors flat. At the request of the
professor he had arranged to come there the following evening to
discuss another commission that the former had in view, but an
unanticipated invitation to a card party where he thought he
might be able to make some good money cropping up for that
particular night, he decided to make an earlier visit to St.
John's Wood and go there straight away.</p>

<p>Trying three times, however, to contact the professor over
the phone and upon each occasion finding the line engaged, with
his usual impatience he decided not to ring again but go to see
him at once. It was a cold and foggy night and he knew he would
be certain of finding him at home.</p>

<p>Arriving at the flat, the maid who answered the door knowing
Mangan as a frequent and privileged visitor with no hesitation
smilingly ushered him into the study where the professor was. To
his annoyance Mangan found there was another visitor there, a
tall and good-looking man of foreign appearance, seemingly in
the middle thirties.</p>

<p>The professor looked most embarrassed and got very red. "This
is Mr. Brown," he stammered to the stranger, "an old friend of
mine. Brown, this is"&mdash;he hesitated a long
moment&mdash;"Mr. Fernand from Madrid." He nodded smilingly to
Mangan. "He says he can get me better champagne at only half the
cost."</p>

<p>Mangan was not deceived. The man was no Spaniard. He was a
Baltic if ever there was one, and he looked all over a soldier,
too. However, he took the proferred hand smilingly and started
to discuss Spanish and French wines, about which he was not
surprised to find the other seemed to know very little,
contenting himself with agreeing to everything he, Mangan, said.
The man spoke excellent English.</p>

<p>They had not talked together for long when Mangan was sure he
caught a meaning look pass between the professor and this Mr.
Fernand, and the latter, with most polite bows, at once rose up
and took his leave.</p>

<p>With his departure, the professor seemed more embarrassed
than ever and began to talk very quickly about the next
commission, with the object Mangan was sure of evading any
question which might be asked about his Spanish visitor.</p>

<p>"But I'm not ready for you tonight," he said irritably.</p>

<p>"I expect to get the information I want tomorrow. If you
can't come then, what about coming Sunday?" He heaved a big
sigh. "That man tired me out and I want to go to bed at once. I
feel my bronchitis is going to worry me tonight. So you won't
think me rude, will you, if I ask you to go?"</p>

<p>Mangan was quite agreeable. Evidently, something not quite
above board was going on and he wanted time to think over it.
"All right, I'll come on Sunday," he said, "and I hope there'll
be no other visitors about then. With your so well-known views,
the fewer people who know I come to see you the better."</p>

<p>"Then Sunday will fit in admirably," said the professor, "as
there won't be anyone here except me. The maids always go out on
Sunday evenings."</p>

<p>Mangan was frowning hard as he let himself out of the flat.
The professor had obviously been most annoyed that he had met
his visitor, and there must be some good reason for it. The
half-crazy little man was like a child in some ways, with all
his passing emotions showing in his face, and he had just looked
as if he had been caught doing something wrong. The devil! If he
went wholly out if his mind there would be all hell to pay!</p>

<p>Walking up to his car which he had left about fifty yards
away, to his amazement he found the professor's other visitor
standing there and evidently waiting for him. The man raised his
right hand in salute. "I thought this was your car," he said,
"and at any rate I meant to catch you when you came out."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Mangan, by no means too pleased at
meeting the man again.</p>

<p>"I want to have a talk with you, Major Mangan," said the
other man solemnly, "and it will be a most important one. Oh,
yes, I know your real name and much more about you, too. That
little fool is becoming as dangerous as a bomb both to you and
us as well."</p>

<p>"But who are you?" asked Mangan with a sickly feeling in the
pit of his stomach. "That you don't come from Madrid I am quite
certain."</p>

<p>The man shook his head. "No, I'm a Baltic and come from the
Embassy here. I'm Captain Feodor Michaeloff." He spoke sharply.
"Now, where can we have this little talk?" and when Mangan stood
hesitating, he went on, "Better come with me to the Embassy.
Happily, I didn't come in my car. So you can drive me
there."</p>

<p>"Jump in," said Mangan, his voice hoarse in his uneasiness.
"I know where it is."</p>

<p>They made the drive in complete silence and, just before
arriving at the important building in Portland Place, the
captain suggested they should pull up in a little back street.
"We'll go in by the side entrance," he said. "In these days you
never know who's on the look-out."</p>

<p>In a very few minutes Mangan was installed in a small room
upon the ground floor and the captain, closing the door very
deliberately, drew a heavy curtain across the doorway.</p>

<p>"Now what about a good brandy and soda?" he said. "I think we
need some kind of stimulant to face the situation we are up
against."</p>

<p>The drinks mixed, Mangan imbibed a deep draught. He was
feeling most uneasy, wondering what was coming next.</p>

<p>The captain at once came straight to the point. "Major
Mangan," he said with the utmost gravity, "the excitement has
been too much for Professor Glenowen and he has become stark,
staring mad. He is right over the border-line now and, caring
for no consequences both to himself and you, with very little
encouragement will boast to anyone what you have done at his
request, and,"&mdash;he frowned angrily&mdash;"as he's
untruthfully making out now, at ours as well."</p>

<p>Then, noting Mangan's scared and ashen face, he went on
quickly, "But you are perfectly safe with me, and indeed, all of
us here are very pleased with what you have done. So don't have
the very slightest worry about us. We shall never give you
away."</p>

<p>Mangan steadied his voice with an effort. "But what did he
tell you about me?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Everything, I say," replied the captain, "from your killing
von Bressen and the Scotland Yard detective to your unsuccessful
attempt to get Iver Selwyn last week, Selwyn, the Secret Service
man." He raised his hand warningly. "And worse still, he's got
it all written down in some memoirs he's writing, the sums of
money he has paid you, the dates and everything."</p>

<p>Mangan realised denials would be of no use and ground his
teeth savagely. "How did he come to tell you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He rang me up to come and see him. He said he had something
very interesting to tell me, and he poured it all out as quickly
as he could get his words. He showed me the book, too. You must
understand we have known him for several years now and, at
times, he has given us some quite useful information." The
captain scowled. "Now, as I say, he has dragged us into all your
killings and, in this very dangerous book he is writing, seems
to be making out he employed you with our full knowledge and
approval all along. If what he has written ever became known, of
course it will do us a lot of harm in neutral countries."</p>

<p>"It won't become known," said Mangan savagely, "I'll see to
that."</p>

<p>"But you won't be able to frighten him," warned the captain.
"He is past all that. His mental condition is such that he gives
no thought to any consequences."</p>

<p>"I won't frighten him," scowled Mangan. "I'll do much more
than that. I'll stop him talking once and for all."</p>

<p>"That's the spirit," exclaimed the captain approvingly, "and
I thought you'd take it that way. The sooner you get to work,
the better. I'm afraid we can't help you in any way."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can," said Mangan quickly. "Give me an automatic.
If I have to shoot him, I don't want the bullet to come from a
gun I've used before. There must be no connection between
finishing with him and anything previous that has happened."</p>

<p>"Ah, a good point that," nodded the captain. "Yes, of course
you shall have one, but be very careful how you get rid of it
afterwards. We shan't want it back here."</p>

<p>They chatted on for quite a long while, to all outward
appearances two most gentlemanly men imbued with all the highest
principles of a soldier's calling. Who would have ever dreamed
they were discussing the carrying out of a coldblooded murder,
almost as if it were a very ordinary and commonplace happening,
liable to occur in everyone's life.</p>

<hr>

<p>The following Monday morning, Sir Robert Edis, the Chief
Commissioner of Police, and Chief Inspector Charles Stone, of
the Criminal Investigation Department, were closeted together in
Scotland Yard, in the former's room. Sir Robert, tall and erect
in bearing, looked every inch of him the soldier, but upon first
glance a stranger might not have taken the inspector for one of
the shrewdest and most capable officers of the C.I.D. that he
undoubtedly was.</p>

<p>Now in the middle fifties, Charlie Stone, as he was
affectionately called in the Yard, was of massive build. He had
a big heavy face, big head, and big grey eyes which looked out
upon the world from under big and scraggy brows. In repose has
face was set and stern, but for all that he was a kind-hearted
man and full of humour.</p>

<p>Old in the ways of crime, he was wont to say laughingly that
he loved meeting with a really clever criminal, with the pitting
of wits against wits and his delving into the dark recesses of
the other's mind. It was his boast that when he was about to
question a man he could tell with his first glance if he were a
liar or not.</p>

<p>The Chief smiled whimsically. "You know, Inspector," he said,
"I'm quite heartened that your old friend Gilbert Larose has
asked to see me. He wouldn't be ringing up for an interview if
he hadn't something on his mind that he wants particularly to
tell us."</p>

<p>"That's so, Sir Robert," commented the inspector in his big
booming voice. "A bright boy, Gilbert, and he'd never waste our
time for nothing."</p>

<p>"Now, I've met him and his wife socially," said the Chief,
"but I've never been down to their place in Norfolk. I hear they
live in great style."</p>

<p>"And they're as happy as if they were still a honeymoon
couple," nodded Stone. "Yes, they've got a lovely house."</p>

<p>"You worked with him for several years, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Seven exactly, sir, and in those few years he climbed higher
in the public estimation than any of us who've been here thirty.
He was a splendid colleague to work with, always so hopeful and
bright."</p>

<p>The Chef Inspector puckered up his brows. "But I've heard
some tales. He was a bit insubordinate, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>The Inspector laughed. "We never actually caught him at it,
sir, but I've suspected more than once that when he judged there
were extenuating circumstances he wasn't quite so active in
getting his man as perhaps he might have been. Mind you, sir, we
never could prove it, but that's what I thought."</p>

<p>The phone tinkled upon the Chief's tesk, and picking up the
receiver, he said at once, "Then bring him in, please." He
glanced back in the inspector. "Here he is."</p>

<p>About ten years younger than his old friend, Stone, Gilbert
Larose certainly had all appearances of being a happy and
contented man. Of medium height, he was good-looking with good
features and a merry, smiling face. He was dressed well and
tastefully, though there was nothing of the fop about him. As
with the inspector, he gave one the impression of being a
kind-hearted man. He shook hands with the Chief Commissioner
and Stone.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Larose," smiled the Chief, "we hope you have come
to help us about those six killings. We are not getting on too
well here and, as you know, the public are clamouring for our
blood. So, we are expecting great things from you, one of those
brilliant flashes of intuition for which in the old days, I'm
told, you were so famous."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Robert," smiled back Larose, "though I've nothing
very startling to tell you, I feel sure I can put you on the
beginning of the trail." He shook his head. "No, it is not any
cleverness upon my part that has led me to pick it up, but the
foolishness and stupidity of the other fellow." He paused a long
moment. "In my opinion it is that Professor Harleck Glenowen is
the key man of all these crimes."</p>

<p>Inspector Stone frowned heavily and the Chief Commissioner
opened his eyes very wide. "What," exclaimed the latter, "the
little mad professor who wrote that damnable letter to <i>The
Times!</i>" He frowned, too. "But a little chap like him
couldn't have throttled those two men in Cambridge."</p>

<p>"I don't say he did," said Larose quickly, "and I wouldn't
say he pistolled any of the others, as his nerves don't strike
me as being good enough for him to be such a sure shot. He looks
to me now as if he had taken to drinking. His hands are shaking
and his lips tremulous. No, I don't think for a moment that he's
been the actual murderer, but I do believe he knows who is, and
might even have to put him up to everything."</p>

<p>"But how on earth could he induce any man to become a
wholesale murderer?" asked the Chief Commissioner.</p>

<p>"Money does more than talk," said Larose earnestly, "it
shrieks, and the war has thrown up plenty of bold, reckless
fellows who will do anything if they are paid well enough. The
murders of that Dr. von Bressen and Inspector Barwell looked in
every particular a returned soldier's work to me and one who had
been a commando for preference."</p>

<p>"And you have evidence pointing to the professor, definite
evidence?" asked the Chief Commissioner sharply.</p>

<p>Larose spoke impressively. "Except for Inspector Barwell and
the Ingatestone doctor, I can prove that he had animus against
all the murdered men. Against three of them he had a personal
spite."</p>

<p>"You know that for certain?" persisted the Chief.</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "As certain as I know I am sitting here. All
last week I was collecting evidence and I can prove it up to the
very hilt."</p>

<p>"Very good, then," said the Chief. "Now let's hear all about
it."</p>

<p>"It began in this way," said Larose. "But first you must
understand I have known Glenowen, it must be quite six or seven
years. He has a seaside bungalow only a few miles from where I
live, and I have met him socially at luncheons and dinners and
an occasional evening at cards. I have always been interested in
him, far more than he has been interested in me. In fact, when
we have met he has hardly ever taken any notice of me, possibly
because he comes of a good old Welsh family and is a University
man, whereas everyone knows I was once only a policeman."</p>

<p>"A damned snob!" growled Stone. He regarded Larose
affectionately. "You are as good as anyone, my boy."</p>

<p>"Then imagine my surprise," went on Larose, "when a few weeks
ago he took to calling upon me quite often, with little presents
of oysters, the first time not very long ago after the Cambridge
murders. He brought round the conversation to them at once and
remarked what terrible crimes they were. I thought what a damned
little hypocrite he was, as everyone knew von Bressen's death
was exactly what he wanted. It struck me, too, that he was
rather queer in the way he talked. He spoke so quickly and was
so voluble and kept on jumping from one thing to another as if
he couldn't collect his ideas. Then the next time he called was
just after the shooting of Professor Rodney in the Outer Circle
of Regent's Park, and he seemed very excited about it. Later,
when my suspicions about him had been aroused, I remembered it
had struck me, subconsciously as it were, that there was
something funny about the way he had kept turning away his eyes,
just like a little child who had done something wrong and was
wondering if he had been found out. I thought he was childishly
curious, too, about what I had been doing lately, had I been up
to Town much or had I been busy with work upon the estate."</p>

<p>"What did he say about his brother professor's murder?" asked
the Chief.</p>

<p>"Oh, that it was a dreadful thing and he couldn't understand
how no one was able to give a description of the car. He said
Rodney had been a great friend of his and he was very upset
about his death. Well, he came to see me four more times, upon
each occasion talking a lot about the murders and wondering what
the police were doing. The last time was exactly a fortnight
ago, on a Monday and, harking back to the murders of von Bressen
and Inspector Barwell, he remarked casually he supposed that by
now the police had closed all their enquiries about them,
realising that after all these weeks any discovery was
hopeless."</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner turned smilingly to Stone. "You see,
Inspector, what some people think of us."</p>

<p>"I've been seeing that, sir," commented the inspector,
grimly, "all the five and thirty years since as an innocent
fellow I joined the Force."</p>

<p>Larose went on. "Then, when I told him that Scotland Yard
never, as he called it, closed their enquiries and, though it
might be many months yet before he read in his newspaper that
the murderer had been caught, he would certainly hear about it
one day, his expression all at once became so uneasy that I said
laughingly, 'But it won't be you, Professor, that they'll catch.
So you needn't lose any sleep there.'"</p>

<p>Larose paused here to light another cigarette. "Then, on the
following Friday night," he said very solemnly, "a revelation
came to me and almost in a few seconds I was certain Glenowen
was implicated in all these crimes. Everything stood out so
clearly and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Upon the following Friday night, ten days ago, you say you
were so certain," queried the Chief frowningly, "and yet you
didn't come to us until today?"</p>

<p>"No," retorted Larose sharply. "I wanted more than my
suspicions to lay before you. I wanted the evidence I now have.
Yes, it was last Friday week, exactly a week after that
Ingatestone doctor was shot, the last so far of the series of
crimes and I can assure you, Sir Robert, I have been busy ever
since." He smiled. "Inspector Stone here will tell you that I
have always worked by myself until the time was ripe for team
work to begin."</p>

<p>"That's so, Sir Robert," nodded Stone to the Chief, "and he
was never one to send us off upon a wild-goose chase in all the
years I've known him."</p>

<p>The Chief made no comment and Larose went on. "Now not only
have I a large scrap-book of many hundreds of events which have
been of interest to me, but also for many years I have kept a
diary of important and unimportant happenings, the unimportant
ones being such as a bitch having puppies or one of our cats
having kittens, or about potatoes or what-not having been
planted in the garden."</p>

<p>He drew in a deep breath. "Well, upon this particular Friday
night, I took up my diary to see what date certain bulbs had
been put in in one of my conservatories and, on the page where
it opened, 'Professor Rodney Shot' caught my eye, with 'Glenowen
called' just under that entry. Then, turning back the pages to
get to where I wanted, I could not help being struck with the
strange coincidences, as I thought at first, that 'Glenowen
called' was written there in close proximity to the entries
recording the murders of Dr. Carmichael, Arnold Travers, and
lately, that of Dr. Henderson of Ingatestone. When the first two
of these dreadful crimes had been committed he had come to see
me the day after it had been done, and in regard to the third,
the day before."</p>

<p>Larose paused for a long moment before going on very quickly.
"At first, I admit I saw no particular signficance in the
sequences of these entries, but then, suddenly, light seemed to
come to me, and I literally gasped at my discovery. They meant,
surely they could only mean that the professor was somehow mixed
up with all these crimes, as they furnished so reasonable an
explanation for his frequent visits to my home, his pumping me
about the methods of the police and his wanting to find out if I
myself had been away much from home lately, that is, I see now,
to discover if I were back at my old trade, trying to pick up
clues about these dreadful crimes. It all seemed as clear as day
to me."</p>

<p>Neither the Chief Commissioner or Stone were ready with any
comment. Their mouths were both half open and they stared
intently at Larose. He went on briskly, "Now, though for private
reasons, I wasn't able to leave home until the Monday, I didn't
lose much time. Looking up my newspaper cuttings, I saw
Professor Rodney had been staying with his married sister at
Hampstead up to the evening he was killed, and on the Monday
afternoon I called there to speak to her. I explained my coming
with the fib that I had a slight acquaintance with her brother
and, being in the neighbourhood, thought I must call to express
my deep sympathy for her. I added, that Professor Harleck
Glenowen who was a friend of mine had asked me to express his
sympathy for her, too."</p>

<p>To the amazement of his listeners the face of Larose now
became one broad and highly amused grin. "At what happened next,
although the matter is so serious, whenever I think of it I
can't help wanting to laugh. Directly I had mentioned the
professor and said he was a friend of mine, I saw at once that I
had put my foot in it. His sister looked as furious and as if
she would like to scratch my eyes out. 'If I had known you were
a friend of his,' she said angrily, 'I would have never let you
come into the house. The horrid little hypocrite sending his
condolences! Why, he and my poor brother had been deadly enemies
for years! When they were at Cambridge together my brother had
once referred to him as a little Welsh ape and he had never
forgiven him for it. He was a spiteful little beast and we were
sure it was he who kept on poisoning every dog we had.
Strychnine baits were continually being thrown over into the
garden and in the end it wasn't safe for us to keep any animals,
either dogs or cats.'"</p>

<p>"That finished the interview," said Larose, "and I went next
to Arnold Travers' people. To cut my story short, I learnt
Travers had attacked the professor in his weekly column in the
<i>Sunday Bulletin</i>, and had received a highly abusive letter
from him on return. Passing on to Dr. Carmichael, I found he had
answered the professor's infamous atom-bomb letter in <i>The
Times</i> and given it as his opinion that a padded room was the
right place for those who thought like him. He, too, had been
honoured with an epistle from the professor, in which, among
other abuse, he had been informed he was a disgrace to his
honourable calling and most certainly as insane as any patient
in his own mental asylum."</p>

<p>Larose paused here for another cigarette. "Now, I come lastly
to that Dr. Henderson of Ingatestone, and his case was the
hardest of them all. Interviewing his family and some of his
friends I could find nothing whatsoever to link him up with the
professor, no contact with him in any way. Indeed, it seemed
probable that he might even have never heard of Glenowen. He was
always kept very busy with a large practice in the surrounding
district and, so I was told, often was too tired at nights to
read the daily newspapers."</p>

<p>Larose made a grimace. "I wasted two whole days in
interviewing people and then it dawned suddenly upon me that it
was a case of mistaken identity, with the doctor having been
taken for someone else and shot in his stead.
Remember&mdash;whoever shot him had been hiding among the trees
in a little plantation, upon a bank some three to four feet
above the road and he had had to fire from some fifty to sixty
feet away. The doctor was known everywhere as a fast driver and
so, passing the spot where the assassin was waiting, the latter
would have had to be very quick in the identification, and I
reckoned he would have made it almost entirely by the car."</p>

<p>"Then was the car an unusual type?" asked the Chief.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a blue Minerva single-seater, their very latest
model only recently out of the factory, and to my disappointment
I found it was the only one in the district. I enquired for
miles and miles round, but no one knew of anyone except Dr.
Henderson who had one. I visited scores and scores of garages on
the main road for more than five and twenty miles, but got no
satisfaction. Then, sick at heart and barely a couple of miles
from Colchester, I scored a hit bang in the middle of the target
and heard of the very car I wanted."</p>

<p>Larose looked very pleased with himself. "It was quite a
small petrol station, and when I put the usual questions to the
proprietor, did he know of anyone in the neighbourhood who ran a
latest model of the blue Minerva, to my delight he replied that
though he didn't know of anyone locally, yet a customer of his
had been coming down from Town in one upon the last three
preceding Sundays to see his mother who had been in a motor
accident and was at present in the Colchester Hospital. He said
he knew the old lady quite well, as she lived just up the road
and he had looked after her Bentley for her for several years.
Before the accident, when her son came to visit her he nearly
always called in upon him, the garage man, for a fill of petrol.
He was a fine gentleman."</p>

<p>Larose snapped his fingers together exultingly. "Then when I
asked his name, I found I knew him. He was a Captain Iver
Selwyn, and both he and I had worked for the British
Intelligence during the last war."</p>

<p>"Does he know Professor Glenowen?" asked the Chief
sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has a slight acquaintance with him," nodded Larose.
"He was introduced to him once at a meeting of the Royal
Society. Unhappily, he told me that Glenowen knows more about
him than he should through a maid who had left his, the
captain's, service to go into that of the professor. The captain
had dismissed her because she had been caught eavesdropping and
he was strongly suspicious she had got hold of his keys once and
gone through the contents of his desk."</p>

<p>"Then you've seen this Captain Selwyn in the course of these
last few days?" asked the Chief.</p>

<p>"I got in touch with him yesterday," replied Larose, "after a
lot of difficulty. I told him everything and gave him a very
solemn warning to beware of another attempt to shoot him."</p>

<p>"But what animus, Gilbert," said Stone, "would Glenowen have
had against him?"</p>

<p>"Only that he knows he is an Intelligence man," replied
Larose, "and guesses, probably most correctly, too, that his
present job is to look out for enemy agents among the workers on
the atom-bomb," he frowned. "You know I think Glenowen is now
getting right out of his mind and will be striking right and
left at anyone he can." He looked from one to the other of his
audience and asked with a smile, "Well, do you think I've made
out any sort of a case."</p>

<p>"The strongest," said Stone emphatically. "Don't you think
so, too, Sir Robert?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly," replied the Chief. He turned to Larose. "We
are most intensely grateful to you, sir, and now, to add to our
obligations, tell us what you think we should do. Knowing
Glenowen as you do, in what way do you think we should approach
him?"</p>

<p>"Bounce him into a confession," replied Larose instantly.
"His nerves are just in that jittery state that, if you give him
no warning and take him on the hop, he may not be able to pull
himself sufficiently together to deny everything. At any rate,
demand to look into his banking account to see if he's been
drawing out any large sums of money lately. If my contention is
correct that he's been financing all these assassinations, then
depend upon it the assassin has been well paid."</p>

<p>"Where in St. John's Wood does he live?" asked Stone. "Oh,
number seventeen in Grove Road, an old house that has been
converted into two flats! Then, do you happen to know if he's at
home now?"</p>

<p>"He was up to the day before yesterday," replied Larose,
"because I rang him up then, making out I was an agent for a new
carpet-sweeper and asking if I could call and give him a
demonstration. One of the maids answered the phone and, going to
enquire of her master, returned with the emphatic reply, 'No,
certainly not.'"</p>

<p>"Good," exclaimed the inspector, "then we'll go out there at
once and, to be on the safe side, I'll take a search-warrant
with me. We won't waste a minute's time and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the phone tinkled on the Chief Commissioner's desk, and
he picked up the receiver. "Chief Commissioner here," he said,
and a long minute's intense silence followed. Then, with a catch
in his breath, the Chief asked sharply, "When?" Another silence
ensued and he said, "All right. We'll be with you as quickly as
possible."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and the two others in the room noted
that his face had paled a little. "Gentlemen," he said grimly,
"there will be no interview for anyone with Professor Glenowen
this morning, as less than an hour ago he was found battered to
death in his study. He was killed last night."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>

BAFFLED</h2>

<p class="first">THEY stood round the body in the dead man's
study while the police surgeon, bending down upon one knee, made
a quick examination. "Two blows struck," he said briskly, "the
first taking him from behind when he was standing up, and the
second made when he was lying here prone. Either would have
killed him and death would have been practically instantaneous.
Very violent blows by a strong man! See in both places where the
bone has been crashed in."</p>

<p>He bent lower to inspect more closely and tut-tutted several
times. "A very callous murderer! Note, where, to steady the head
for his second blow, he pressed his foot hard upon the poor
man's neck. See the dirt there from the sole of his shoe." He
nodded frowningly. "Yes, a very brutal individual, the assassin
here!"</p>

<p>"About when do you think he was killed, Doctor?" asked
Inspector Stone.</p>

<p>"I should say he's been dead all night. <i>Rigor</i> is
well-down to his legs, but I shall be able to tell you
with more accuracy when I've made the P.M. Do you know when he
had his last meal?"</p>

<p>It was the local police-sergeant who had first arrived upon
the scene of the murder who answered the question. "His
housekeeper says, Doctor, that the maid cleared away his evening
meal just before seven."</p>

<p>The doctor nodded. "Good! Then according to how far digestion
has proceeded we shall be able to tell within half an hour or so
when he died. Yes, that bloodied poker there was undoubtedly the
weapon. Its heavy knob would have made just such indentation as
there." He picked up his bag and added with a smile, "Well,
that's all I can say for the present, gentlemen, and it's up to
you now to find the murderer."</p>

<p>With the departure of the police surgeon, the Chief
Commissioner took his leave, too, and after Inspector Stone had
turned out the pockets of the dead man, finding among other
things a bunch of keys, the body was taken off in the ambulance.
Some half an hour later, after the finger-mark expert had done
all he wanted, Larose and Inspector Stone, in company with a
second inspector, Inspector Isaac Mendel, sat themselves down
and proceeded to go over everything.</p>

<p>Inspector Mendel, whom Stone generally picked to work with
him, was in the early thirties and the youngest inspector
attached to the Criminal Investigation Department at Scotland
Yard. Undeniably good-looking in a dark Hebraic way and of a
refined appearance, he owed his high position for one so young
to sheer merit. Possessed of a lively imagination and remarkable
powers of deduction, no one was better versed than he in the
annals of crime, and, continually drawing upon that knowledge
for inspiration, he had achieved not a few outstanding
successes. He and Larose had met before and he held the latter
in the highest esteem. Coming along in the car, he had been told
briefly of Larose's suspicion of the professor.</p>

<p>"Now, Gilbert," said Stone with a grim smile, "with your
knowledge of the dead man, tell us what you think of it. Are you
inclined to make out this is a separate crime, or is it another
of that series which has been so baffling us?"</p>

<p>"It's linked up with the others," replied Larose without the
slightest hesitation. "Harleck Glenowen had raised up a devil to
carry out those murders for him, a callous unscrupulous and
clever devil who was shrewd enough to realise that his employer
was now becoming a danger to him. He must have seen as well as I
did that the professor was no longer a hundred per cent safe to
hold any secret. As I told you, every time I saw him he seemed
to me to be more and more like a little child, and you know how
a little child bursts to tell all he knows."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was keeping a diary," suggested Mendel. "I
noticed the callous on his right forefinger was shiny and there
was a trace of ink there, too. So that means he must have been
writing since he last washed his hands, yet we found no
manuscript or papers about."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" exclaimed Larose warmly. He made a wry face. "I
must be getting old or I should have noticed that, too. Then
maybe there had been papers in that safe and that's what his
murderer had come after."</p>

<p>"We'll talk with the maids at once," said Stone. He nodded to
Mendel. "Fetch the elder one in, first. I understand she's the
cook-housekeeper."</p>

<p>"One moment," said Larose as Mendel was moving to the door.
He turned to Stone. "Remember Captain Selwyn told me a maid of
his whom he had dismissed had entered Glenowen's service. Well,
perhaps the housekeeper is the one. Assume that she is, and
she'll be so surprised at us knowing it that she'll think it
best to be quite straightforward and open with us."</p>

<p>"A good idea," nodded Stone. "Bring her in, Mendel."</p>

<p>The cook-housekeeper was a small slim woman apparently in the
middle forties. She had sharp features and a pointed nose. She
wore glasses with thick lenses, and looked of the inquisitive
kind.</p>

<p>Stone motioned her to a chair. "Your name, please?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Norah Wenn," she replied.</p>

<p>"And for how long have you been the cook-housekeeper here,
Miss Wenn? Oh, two years! And before that, I believe you were
with Captain Iver Selwyn?"</p>

<p>The woman's eyes boggled and her mouth opened. She cleared
her throat and answered, "Yes."</p>

<p>Stone smiled kindly at her. "Now, Miss Wenn," he said, "this
is a very dreadful business and I'm sure you'll want to help us
all you can." He became confidential. "You see we think your
poor master was killed by someone he knew quite well and whom he
regarded as a friend, and of course he had opened the door to
him himself. Now, was he expecting anyone to call last
night?"</p>

<p>"Not that we know of, sir," replied the woman, "but then he
very seldom tells us about his visitors and, if he's been
expecting one, he's nearly always been ready to open the door
himself directly he hears the bell ring. Sometimes, he's even
been waiting on the doorstep for them."</p>

<p>"Has he had many visitors lately?"</p>

<p>"Not different ones, sir, only his doctor and two other
gentlemen who have often been coming lately, a Mr. Brown and
another one whose name we have never heard, he's a foreigner
this gentleman and comes from some Embassy."</p>

<p>"How do you know he came from some Embassy?"</p>

<p>"Because Emma, sir&mdash;she's the other girl here&mdash;once
overheard him say he couldn't stop long as he had to be back at
the Embassy soon."</p>

<p>"You say he was a foreigner? Well, what sort of
foreigner?"</p>

<p>"He didn't look like a Frenchman or an Italian or a German,
sir, and Emma says she once heard Master call him Captain
something ending with off, so we thought he must be a Russian.
He was big and tall, with big front teeth like a horse."</p>

<p>"And had a loud laugh, the few times he laughed?" broke in
Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's him," exclaimed the housekeeper in great
surprise. "We could hear it then right away in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"I know him," said Larose, addressing himself to Stone. "I'll
tell you about him later."</p>

<p>Stone went on with his examination. "And now this Mr.
Brown&mdash;what about him?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "We don't know anything about him, sir,
either what he is or where he lives. He was a new friend of
Master's and it's always puzzled us what he came here for. He
always arrived about the same time, eight o'clock, but never
stopped for much longer than half an hour, except once when
Master had invited him to dinner."</p>

<p>"Has he been coming often?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say about a dozen times."</p>

<p>"When did he start coming?"</p>

<p>"It must have been about the beginning of July. I know it was
summer-time because Master took him out into the garden to show
him some shooting with his pistols."</p>

<p>"What was he like to look at? Was he old or young?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite young, sir. Emma&mdash;the other girl&mdash;says
he's well under thirty. I can't tell you exactly what he's like,
because I'm short-sighted and have never been close up to him.
When he went into the garden that evening I saw him in the
distance and could just make out that he was tall and well-built
and soldierly and looked very smartly dressed. A real gentleman
about Town, I thought."</p>

<p>"And you never opened the door to him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Nearly always Master must have known he was coming
and was on the lookout to let him in himself. Still, Emma has
let him in a few times. She says he is very good-looking."</p>

<p>"But do you think he always came by appointment as if there
was some business between them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all but once, sir, and that was one evening last week.
Then Master had got that foreign gentleman with him when he
called. Emma answered the door and, thinking she was doing quite
right, showed him straight into the study. For some reason,
Master was very angry with her afterwards for having done it and
called her a stupid fool."</p>

<p>"How used he to come here, driving in his car, of
course?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, not often in his car and then, when he did, he
would leave it some little way up the road where it couldn't be
seen from the windows here. We know that because one evening
when Emma was coming home a car passed her in the road here and
then pulled up. She saw Mr. Brown jump out and walk up to our
house. She was just in time to see Master open the door to
him."</p>

<p>"But how do you know," asked Stone, "that he didn't always
leave his car up the road when he was visiting your master?"</p>

<p>"Because, generally, sir," she went on volubly, "he had got
his gloves on and was carrying a walking-stick." She smiled.
"The stick was a beautiful ebony one with a curved handle with a
silver band round it. He used to leave it with his hat in the
hall, and it was such a nice one that Emma brought it into the
kitchen once to show me. When he was driving, of course, he had
no stick, and then he had no hat, either. We thought he used to
leave his hat in the car. That last evening, when he met the
foreign gentleman here, he came in with no hat or stick. So we
could tell he was driving. We happened to be certain of that
because Emma went to the pillar-box almost directly after he had
left here and was just in time to see his car starting away from
the place where he usually left it."</p>

<p>Remembering her reputation as an eavesdropper when in her
former situation with Captain Selwyn, Stone asked casually, "And
when he was with your master what did they usually talk
about?"</p>

<p>The housekeeper smiled slyly. "We don't know, sir. The door
was always shut and they talked very quietly."</p>

<p>Stone thought for a moment. "And has your master been doing
much writing lately?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he's been very busy. You see he's not been able to
go out lately because of his bronchitis and so he's been
writing, instead."</p>

<p>"In a book?" queried Stone.</p>

<p>"No, sir, on sheets of paper and he's always locked them up
in his safe, even if he's been away from his study only for a
few minutes. He's been making a scrap-book, too, and pasting in
a lot of cuttings, mostly about those dreadful murders that have
been happening lately."</p>

<p>"But how do you know that?" frowned Stone.</p>

<p>"From the newspapers we clear out of his waste-paper basket
every morning. We noticed the murder parts had been cut
out."</p>

<p>"Did you ever actually see the scrap-book?"</p>

<p>"Only when he was pasting in the cuttings. He always kept the
book locked up in his safe, along with his writings."</p>

<p>A pause followed before Stone asked, "Then you can give us no
idea what this Mr. Brown came for?"</p>

<p>"None at all, sir," she replied, but, seeming to remember
something, she added quickly, "Oh, we think he was as interested
in pistols as Master was, and we believe Master must have given
him some of his." She went on, "You see, sir, Master's great
hobby was shooting with a pistol. He has a target fixed up in
the rockery and some days he's been shooting quite a lot at it.
He used to have seven or eight pistols and would spend hours
some days cleaning and polishing them up. Then, lately, when he
was doing the polishing we noticed he had not so many pistols as
usual on the newspaper spread upon the table, quite three or
four less, we thought."</p>

<p>"And where did he keep these pistols?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"All except one, locked in his safe," she said. "This one he
had always by him, either in the drawer in his desk during the
day, or at night by the little table near his bed." She sighed.
"Poor Master was always eccentric and of late we've thought he
was getting worse."</p>

<p>"How worse?" queried Stone. "What did he do?"</p>

<p>She made a faint show of speaking with reluctance. "He seemed
queer in his head, sir, we think from drinking too much wine. He
had taken to laughing and talking to himself."</p>

<p>"And what did he say?" asked Stone. He smiled confidingly.
"Come now, don't tell me you didn't try to listen. I know I
should have done so. It wouldn't be human not to be
curious."</p>

<p>She smiled back. "Well, yes, we did, sir, but we couldn't
catch what he said. His door was always shut, and we could just
hear him mumbling to himself and that was all."</p>

<p>A short silence followed before Stone said, "Well, to go back
to that foreign gentleman&mdash;what did he come here for? Have
you no more idea about him than you have of Mr. Brown?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "None whatever, sir. All the many times
he's been here we've never learnt anything."</p>

<p>"And when he came last week&mdash;do you think he came by
arrangement? Was your master expecting him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we are sure he was waiting to answer his ring, but
he was rather slow in getting to the door because he had to shut
up the safe first, and so Emma nearly got there before him. She
says he waved her back very crossly, but she dawdled long enough
in the hall to see who it was he let in."</p>

<p>"How do you know he had to shut up his safe?" frowned
Stone.</p>

<p>"Because, sir, we heard him bang it to. He always shut it
with a bang you could hear all over the house. We heard it bang
again a little later that evening&mdash;so we thought he'd been
showing the foreign gentleman something."</p>

<p>"And what was in the safe?" smiled Stone. "Had it not become
quite an interesting mystery to you?"</p>

<p>The housekeeper smiled back. "Yes, it had, sir, but only
quite lately since Master had started to write so much. We had
never heard it bang so often before."</p>

<p>Another short silence followed. "Well, thank you, Miss Wenn,"
said Stone. "That's all we want of you for the present. We'll be
ringing the bell in a minute or two and then will you please
send in the other young lady."</p>

<p>When the door closed behind her, Stone snapped his fingers
together exultingly. "A sure thing, this Mr. Brown! Everything
fits in&mdash;the time when he first took to calling upon the
professor, those pistols which were given him so that he never
used the same one twice and that's why all the bullets found in
the murdered men came from different weapons. Then the
manuscript he kept so carefully locked up in that safe, and the
scrap-book, too. Those were what Mr. Brown came after, sure
enough. Now a good description of him from other girl and we
shall be well upon the trail."</p>

<p>Unhappily, however, the inspector soon found that no good
description was going to be forthcoming, as Emma Hobson, the
second girl, seemed anything but as sharp as the housekeeper.
Not much over twenty, she was insipid and rather uninteresting
with a pale, unhealthy colour. She had weak and watery eyes
which she screwed up a lot when she was looking at anyone. There
was nothing smart about her and she was dressed dowdily in
clothes which seemed much too old for her. She appeared very
nervous. Asked by Stone to describe Mr. Brown's appearance, she
hesitated a long moment and then stammered out that he was tall
and good-looking.</p>

<p>"But was he dark or fair?" asked Stone, trying with his most
winning smile to put her at her ease.</p>

<p>She hesitated again. "I really can't tell you, sir," she
replied. "I think he was half way in between."</p>

<p>Stone was very patient. "Well, to begin with, was he clean
shaven?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes, sir, he had no moustache."</p>

<p>"And what was the colour of his eyes?"</p>

<p>"I think, I think they were dark, sir," she said slowly. "No,
I can't be sure. They may have been blue." Her voice shook. "I
am very sorry, sir, but I am always bad at descriptions."</p>

<p>"But if you met him again would you recognise him?" asked
Stone.</p>

<p>She brightened up. "Oh, yes, I should know him at once." She
smirked. "As I say, sir, he is very good-looking. Besides, I
should recognise his voice anywhere. It is such a nice one."</p>

<p>Stone tried something else. "Well, Miss Hobson, I understand
he's been here to dinner once and you waited at the table. How
long ago was that?"</p>

<p>"Not very long, sir. I should say only about a month."</p>

<p>"And what did your master and Mr. Brown talk about at this
meal?" asked Stone. He smiled. "Being, as you say, such an
interesting gentleman, of course you'll remember something of
what they said."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do, sir," smiled back the girl, "as we had
thought Master was never interested in such things. It was all
about sport and athletics and boxing and things like that."</p>

<p>"And so friendly as your master was with Mr. Brown," went on
Stone, "Miss Wenn tells us he was yet very angry for you for
showing him in without notice when that foreign gentleman was
here."</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "Very angry, sir. I don't think I've ever
seen him so angry before."</p>

<p>"But why?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"He said he was doing some very important business, sir, with
that foreign gentleman and hadn't wanted to be interrupted."</p>

<p>"But had this foreigner and Mr. Brown never visited your
master together, at the same time before?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, they didn't even know each other, because when I
was shutting the door that evening after I had shown in Mr.
Brown I heard Master starting to introduce them to each
other."</p>

<p>And that was all they could get out of her and, when she had
been dismissed, the stout inspector made a wry face. "Bang goes
all our hope of getting upon an easy trail. It's most
disappointing."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, Charlie, we've still got an
excellent chance. As I said just now, I'm sure I know who that
foreigner is the housekeeper spoke about. He answers to the
description of Captain Feodor Michaeloff, the senior attache at
the Baltic Embassy with whom I did a little bit of work during
the war when I was in the British Intelligence. He was a quiet
reserved man, but a very capable one. So, if I go to him at once
and tell him what's happened here before it has appeared in the
newspapers, he'll certainly do his best with a description of
this Brown, and, perhaps, even be able to tell us where he lives
and all about him."</p>

<p>"But as likely as not he's mixed up in all this business
too," growled Stone. "Some of those killings would not have been
displeasing to his Embassy."</p>

<p>"Of course, we all know the Baltic lot are a bit rough,"
frowned Larose, "and in their own country hold life much cheaper
than we do, but I hardly think they'll have dared to encourage
killings here. Besides, consider how angry Glenowen was when,
through the stupidity of this Emma, Brown was shown straight
into the room where Michaeloff was. If Michaeloff knew all about
what we imagine this Brown has been doing&mdash;then there would
have been no earthly reason for the professor not wishing them
to meet here and get to know each other. No, I'll go round and
see Michaeloff at once and, with him and Glenowen having been
friends, he should certainly be as anxious are we are to have
his murderer brought to book."</p>

<p>The inspector saw the force of Larose's argument and
proceeded to sum up the whole position. "So, if we are right
about this Mr. Brown, this is how things stand. The perpetrator
of all these murders is no longer a shadow to us. We now know
him in the flesh, as an assassin who was hired by Professor
Harleck Glenowen to carry on his dreadful work. Becoming fearful
that his employer was now a danger to him or, on the other hand,
being told there was no more blood-money for him to earn, he
thought it safest to silence the one man who could give him
away. So, of set and deliberate purpose and taking all
precautions, he destroyed him. That is why we shall in all
probability find no finger-marks or clumsy clues left behind
him. We must not expect them and also, we can understand the
rifled safe. It was a well-calculated and cold-blooded murder."
He paused a few moments. "Now who is this man?"</p>

<p>"A returned soldier," said Larose promptly, "because one
violent death after another came easily to him&mdash;a man of
good physique and, more than probable, one who had had commando
training because of those throttlings in Cambridge&mdash;almost
certainly one who had held commissioned rank when in the Army,
because he was educated enough to know the value of that Corot
painting and also because he dined here once with Glenowen. The
professor was not likely to have asked a common man to share a
meal with him. Lastly, this assassin does not live far away from
here because upon some occasions he must have come on foot
carrying a walking stick with him."</p>

<p>"But we know he must have a car," frowned Stone, "because of
what that housekeeper has told us and because of those poor
devils he shot from one."</p>

<p>"Of course he has," agreed Larose, "but perhaps his normal
occupation during the day is a sedentary one and he used to walk
here for exercise. Mentioning cars of course again, he came back
that night from Cambridge in one."</p>

<p>"A guess, Gilbert," smiled Stone, "because we can't be sure
of anything there."</p>

<p>"Much more than a guess," smiled back Larose, "because to my
thinking it was he who killed that policeman when the poor devil
was returning home from his ten-mile patrol along the
Cambridge-London road."</p>

<p>Stone shook his head. "We've no proof there."</p>

<p>"No actual proof," agreed Larose readily, "but there's a
strong probability. You see&mdash;whoever it was who happened to
come across the policeman that night <i>met him coming from the
opposite direction and did not overtake him.</i> We know that,
according to his schedule, just before midnight the policeman
should have been somewhere in the neighbourhood of that bridge
cycling towards Cambridge, where his subsequent killer must have
been motoring away from that town."</p>

<p>"How do we know that?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"Because," said Larose, "the policeman was killed and his
body and bicycle thrown over the bridge on the off-side of the
road, on the side of the road upon which he should not
ordinarily have been. As I see it, the Cambridge assassin was
motoring with all haste to Town when he met with some trouble to
his car just when he arrived at the bridge, most probably he'd
got a punctured tyre. The constable arrived upon the scene and,
crossing over the road, offered to help him. Most likely he
jacked up the wheel, because when his body was later examined in
the mortuary there were traces of thick black grease upon his
fingers and one naturally associates that kind of grease with a
car-jack. The motorist had to kill the poor chap, so that later
he should furnish no description of him or his car."</p>

<p>"It's plausible," commented Stone thoughtfully, "and we may
be able to lay this other charge when we catch the bloody
gendeman." He spoke briskly. "Well, I don't think for the moment
that we can do anything more. So you, Gilbert, go off to see
this friend of yours at the Baltic Embassy at once. If we can
find out straight away who this Brown is we may be able to pick
him up before he has the slightest idea anyone is looking for
him."</p>

<p>"And with any luck and I find the captain in," said Larose,
"I'll be reporting to you at the Yard within an hour."</p>

<p>However, he did not have the luck he had hoped for, as the
captain was out and no one at the Embassy appeared to know where
he had gone or what time he would be back. So it was not until
well into the afternoon that Larose got speech with him and by
then the news of the professor's murder was being well splashed
in the early evening newspapers.</p>

<p>He appeared to be extraordinarily pleased to see Larose.
"Just like old times to see you here," he said as he shook him
warmly by the hand. "I'm delighted."</p>

<p>For some reason which for the moment he could not understand
Larose repressed a frown. He indicated a spread-out newspaper
lying upon the desk. "Then you've read what's happened to
Professor Glenowen?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, and what a dreadful thing," exclaimed the captain,
throwing out his hands. "I've been wondering what could have
been the motive for his murder. Was it robbery, do you
think?"</p>

<p>"We can't be certain," said Larose. "At any rate the safe had
been rifled."</p>

<p>"And I see he was killed last night," said the captain,
tapping the newspapers upon his desk.</p>

<p>"The police surgeon says so," said Larose, "but it wasn't
found out until quite late this morning. I happened to be
calling on the Chief Commissioner when the news came through to
Scotland Yard, and as one who had known the professor for some
years I went up to St. John's Wood with him and the members of
the C.I.D." He regarded the captain intently. "You were a friend
of his, too, and were visiting him only last week, weren't
you?"</p>

<p>The captain was a shrewd and capable man or he would
certainly not have risen to his present position as senior
attache at the Embassy. So now, repressing a start with
difficulty, most puzzled and decidedly uneasy that Larose had
come to learn of his visit to the professor the previous week,
he realised his only course of action was not to deny it.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied readily. "I was up there last Thursday
evening." He made a grimace. "But I would not say the professor
was exactly a friend of mine, as, with his well-publicised views
as to the desirability of shooting everyone who was working on
the atom bomb, for any of us here at the Embassy to claim
friendship with him would discredit us very badly. People would
argue we were encouraging him and that wouldn't have done at
all. No, he was not a friend of mine, merely an
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"And you met a Mr. Brown that evening up at his place, didn't
you?" asked Larose, and upon the captain nodding carelessly he
went on, "Well, Scotland Yard is very curious about that man,
and learning you were a friend of mine asked me to come to you
and find out all I could about him. They thought it would be
less formal than coming themselves."</p>

<p>"Quite so," agreed the captain. His eyes opened as if in
great surprise. "But they don't think he was the murderer, do
they?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," replied Larose, "but they know from the
maids that he's been visiting Glenowen quite a lot lately and
therefore surmise the two must have been on pretty friendly
terms." He spoke very seriously. "You must take in, captain,
that as there is nothing to show that the house was broken into
last night, they argue the professor himself must have admitted
the murderer into the house as a seeming friend."</p>

<p>The captain spoke quickly. "But this Mr. Brown didn't look at
all the type of man to harm anyone," he said. "He struck me as
being a quiet and most inoffensive individual, much too shy, as
I thought at the time, to be a commercial traveller."</p>

<p>"Oh, a commercial traveller, was he?" queried Larose. "Then
what did he travel in?"</p>

<p>"Wines," replied the captain, "and Glenowen had expressly
arranged for me to meet him in the hope that I would give him an
order from the Embassy."</p>

<p>A sudden thought avalanched itself into Larose's mind and for
a few moments he lowered his eyes so that the captain should not
see the expression of surprise upon his face. Glancing up again,
he asked quickly, "Well, what kind of man was he to look at?
Unhappily, neither of the two maids there can give us any good
description. The housekeeper says that though he has called a
good many times she has never been close up to him, and she is
very short sighted. As for the other girl, she is intensely
stupid and can give us no description that will help us at all.
So now all depends upon you to help us. What's he like?"</p>

<p>The captain considered. "He is a fairly good-looking man,
about forty I should say. As far as I recollect, he is of medium
height and build. He is clean shaven, rather fair than dark, and
has weak blue eyes. He dresses rather slovenly."</p>

<p>"Did he strike you as being of a military type?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>The captain smiled. "No, certainly not. He holds himself
badly and there is nothing smart about him."</p>

<p>"Would you call him an educated man, or did he belong to the
working class?"</p>

<p>"Neither," replied the captain promptly. "He looked to me
just like a clerk out of some office." He spoke quickly. "You
must understand that I saw him for only a few minutes, five at
the utmost, as I was anxious to get away. I had an appointment
here at half past eight."</p>

<p>"Glenowen had arranged for you to come that evening?" asked
Larose slowly. "Your visit wasn't just a chance one?"</p>

<p>"No, I had gone to see him on purpose, and he was expecting
me to come. You see, he had phoned me earlier in the day with
some cracked idea in his head that he must go to Moscow to have
a talk with Marshal Stalin. He wanted to come here to discuss it
with us, but we were not anxious to have him as a visitor for
the reason I have told you, and so I went up to see him at his
house instead."</p>

<p>"And he had arranged for that Mr. Brown to come at the same
time," asked Larose carelessly, "so that, as you say, you could
give him an order for some wine?"</p>

<p>"For some champagne," nodded the captain, "and he seemed
rather hurt because I didn't do it, though I explained that all
such matters were dealt with direct from Moscow."</p>

<p>"And that's all you can tell us about this Mr. Brown?" asked
Larose after a short silence.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all," nodded the captain. "I'm sorry, but I know
nothing about the man, not even the name of the firm he
represents."</p>

<p>Leaving the Embassy, Larose went straight to Scotland Yard
and upon being shown into the inspector's room the latter asked
eagerly, "You got a good description, eh?", but upon Larose
shaking his head, he exclaimed incredulously, "What, you don't
mean to tell me you have learnt nothing?"</p>

<p>"I've learnt a devil of a lot," said Larose grimly, "but not
what we wanted or expected." He spoke very gravely. "Charlie,
that Embassy friend of mine knows that chap we call Brown
murdered the professor and is now trying to shield him in every
way he can."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Stone with his eyes as wide as saucers.
"What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Because after declaring he'd seen Brown only once," replied
Larose, "and knew absolutely nothing about him except that he
was a commercial traveller in wines, he gave me a description so
markedly different from everything the two girls said that it
could only have been done to put us off being eager to pick up
his trail."</p>

<p>"But in what way could it have been so different?" growled
Stone. "They told us practically nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Ah, but they <i>did</i> say he was tall," said Larose,
"whereas the captain told me he was only of medium height. Next,
that girl Emma declares he looks under thirty, while Michaeloff
says he's middle aged and about forty. Then that housekeeper was
positive that, even seen by her only at a distance and with her
being short sighted, he was smart and soldierly-looking, a
regular man-about-Town were her words. However, Michaeloff says
he held himself badly and looked slovenly, with nothing
suggesting a soldier about him. Yes, Charlie, the whole time I
was questioning the captain I am sure he was deliberately lying
to me, with his only motive that he wanted us not to bother
about finding Brown because he couldn't possibly have been the
criminal."</p>

<p>"But one moment," frowned Stone. "If he had been, as you say,
so wanting to deceive you&mdash;knowing you must have had some
sort of description from those girls&mdash;surely he wouldn't
have dared to risk giving you so directly an opposite one."</p>

<p>Larose held up his hand smilingly. "Ah, but I had set a trap
for him there, Charlie, and he fell into it. Before we had come
to his giving any description of this Brown right at the
beginning of our talk I had caught him out in one downright lie,
and so I gave him the opportunity to find out if he would tell a
few more. You see, I had told him Glenowen's two maids had
practically given us no description at all. One of them I had
said was very short sighted and had never been close up to
Brown, while the other was too damnably stupid to be able to
describe him in any way."</p>

<p>"But in what lie had you caught him out?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"Oh, he had told me, almost at once when we had started to
talk, that of the express purpose the professor had arranged for
him and Brown to meet that evening in the hope that he could
give Brown an order from the Embassy for some wine. Now I knew
that to be untrue because Glenowen had afterwards been so savage
with Emma because, by her stupidity in showing Brown into the
room where Michaeloff was, the two <i>had</i> met."</p>

<p>"But if he was lying to you so freely as you make out," asked
Stone, "how was it he admitted quite readily that he had gone to
see the professor by arrangement that night. He didn't try to
deceive you then."</p>

<p>"Ah, but he evidently thought he'd better not," exclaimed
Larose. "He didn't know what the maids had told me. I am sure
that he's very puzzled how I came to know he was a friend of
Glenowen's or, as he says, only an acquaintance. I saw his
eyebrows go up when I mentioned it."</p>

<p>"Then if he had never given in his name to the maids,"
commented Stone, "when he was calling upon their master, depend
upon it there was some fishy business going on between
them."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Larose, "and he gave me what I thought was a
very stupid explanation for his calling. He said he wanted to
make Glenowen give up all idea, as the professor was so anxious
to do, of going to Moscow to interview Stalin." He scoffed
contemptuously. "Just as if any bad bronchitis sufferer such as
the professor was would ever dream of going to Russia in the
very worst months of the year. He wanted to make out he was only
calling upon Glenowen to prevent him coming to the Embassy. He
said that, with his well-publicised views about the desirability
of shooting everyone who was working on the atom bomb, it was by
no means desirable for the public to think he was a welcome
visitor with them."</p>

<p>"And, of course," frowned Stone, "you gave him no idea that
we are wanting this Brown for much more than murdering the
professor?"</p>

<p>Larose scowled. "Do you think I'm quite a fool, Charlie? No,
as I tell you I treated him as an enemy at once, and a very
dangerous one, too, as if we are right in our conjectures that
the captain is now as I say deliberately trying to shield Brown,
then anything he learns he'll pass on to Brown straight
away."</p>

<p>"If he knows Brown <i>is</i> Glenowen's murderer," frowned
Stone, "then only Brown himself could have told him." He heaved
a big sigh. "Where is your imagination, Gilbert, that wonderful
imagination of yours? Can't you manage to dish out a bit when
we've never wanted it more than we do now."</p>

<p>A long silence followed and then Larose sprang to his feet.
"Here, let's use your telephone for a minute," he exclaimed. "I
want to speak to that Wenn girl up at St. John's Wood. Now what
was the professor's number?"</p>

<p>Contact was soon made with the professor's flat, with the
housekeeper answering the phone herself. "Is that you, Miss
Wenn?" asked Larose. "Well, I am one of Inspector Stone's two
colleagues who were present when he was questioning you this
morning and I want to know something. You remember you told us
this morning that you had heard the door of the safe bang when
your master had got that foreign gentleman in his room with
him&mdash;I mean that evening when Mr. Brown called, too. Then
can you tell me&mdash;did the door bang directly the foreigner
arrived, or was it later after they had been talking together a
little time? Now don't hurry as it's most important. Think
carefully. Oh, there's no need to think? Splendid! You are quite
sure."</p>

<p>A short silence followed, with Larose still with the receiver
held closely to his ear. "What ... what," he exclaimed with some
animation, "is she quite sure?. .. Why didn't she tell us
before?. .. And she has no idea who the other man was?. .. Oh,
oh!... And she is positive the car was Mr. Brown's?"</p>

<p>Some further conversation ensued and Larose hung up the
receiver. He turned to the inspector. "Things are a bit clearer,
Charlie," he said. "That evening Brown was bundled off not more
than three minutes after the captain had gone and Emma, going
out almost immediately after to post a letter, saw him standing
by his car talking to some man. Before she got near enough to
see what the man was like the two of them both jumped into the
car and it was driven away." He spoke with some animation. "Now
what do you make of that?"</p>

<p>"You want to make out," said Stone slowly, "that Michaeloff
had something important to tell Brown and waited outside by his
car to catch him when he came out." He frowned. "But how did he
know it was Brown's car?"</p>

<p>"He mayn't have known it was Brown's car," said Larose, "but
probably he had noticed that Brown had arrived at the
professor's without a hat and therefore surmised he was not
walking. At any rate, car or no car, I imagine he was waiting to
catch Brown when he came out." He snapped his fingers together.
"You asked for imagination and a long shot, Charlie, and I am
giving it to you. Perhaps Glenowen, bursting with excitement,
had taken his papers out of the safe to show them to him. They
may have recorded all the murders Brown had done, so probably
Michaeloff was becoming scared about Glenowen's state of mind,
for don't forget, Charlie, we can't be certain that the Baltic
lot hadn't all along been in Glenowen's confidence and known all
about the murders. They may have been in it up to the neck with
Brown, however, knowing nothing about their knowledge." He spoke
impressively. "For what has that captain been coming up to see
Glenowen about so many times lately and always at night? What
was the interest between them?"</p>

<p>"And you suggest, then," said Stone thoughtfully, "that
Michaeloff warned Brown of the danger he was in from what the
professor had been writing and got locked up in his safe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and also from his general mental condition," said
Larose, "which was making him liable to blurt out everything to
anyone upon the slightest provocation." He drew in a deep
breath. "Oh, how it all fits in! Brown, most likely at the
captain's instigation, committed yet another murder, not only to
silence the professor but also to get those highly dangerous
papers out of the safe."</p>

<p>"And there's yet more to incriminate Glenowen," said Stone
significandy, "for from enquiries at his bank this morning we've
learnt that in the last three months he's sold bonds to the
value of more than £6,000 and drawn out all the money in £5
notes. Great Scott, if only we could get our hands on that Brown
we'd almost certainly find he's got all that money now."</p>

<p>"But for the moment," said Larose with a grim smile, "our
only hope there is to pick up a military-looking gent who's
carrying an ebony walking-stick with a silver band upon the
handle." He sighed. "I'd bet any money he and Brown are meeting
to-night to have a good talk."</p>

<p>"And the devil of it," sighed back the inspector, "as you
know well, we can't trail a man in London without him becoming
aware of it if he's on the look-out."</p>

<p>"But don't worry unduly, Charlie," comforted Larose, "I've
got an idea and directly it is practicable I'll come and see you
again."</p>

<p>Larose was quite right in his surmise that the captain and
the so-called Mr. Brown would be getting in touch with each
other as speedily as possible, as by pre-arrangement the two met
for dinner that evening at a small and unpretentious Italian
restaurant just off Tottenham Court Road.</p>

<p>"And I've had two taxi rides, a short bus journey and a
longish walk," said the captain, "to make sure no one was
following me. Still, it was imperative even at some risk that I
should see you at once, as things are in the way of becoming
more dangerous than either of us could have thought." He spoke
sharply. "Now have you heard of a man called Gilbert
Larose?"</p>

<p>Mangan nodded sourly. "Yes, the ex-policeman," he said, "who
married a rich wife."</p>

<p>"Which goes to show how smart he is," commented the captain.
"Well, he came to see me this morning and, rather to my dismay,
I learnt he's come out of his shell again and is working his
hardest to help Scotland Yard get hold of this Mr. Brown.
They've dropped like a plummet on to him as the killer of
Glenowen."</p>

<p>Mangan felt an unpleasant sickly feeling in the pit of his
stomach. "But I didn't leave the slightest clue behind," he said
sharply. "I am sure of that. No one saw me arrive at the house
and no one saw me leave. Also, I never had my gloves off the
whole time."</p>

<p>"But if they trace you," asked the captain, "what alibi have
you for yesterday evening?"</p>

<p>Mangan shrugged his shoulders. "Do I need one? I shall say I
never left my flat from Saturday evening until this morning. I
was in bed most of the Sunday with a touch of 'flu and only got
up to get my meals. I have no help on Sunday and no one came
near me."</p>

<p>"Anyone see you go out or come in?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Mangan. "Remember all yesterday it
was very foggy and by evening it was so thick that it took me
the best part of an hour to get to St. John's Wood. I walked the
whole way." He scowled. "But what had this Larose got to
say?"</p>

<p>The captain gave him the gist of the conversation with
Larose. "So you see," he concluded, "they've got no proper
description of you and that's one splendid thing in your
favour."</p>

<p>"Then how can they possibly trace me?" asked Mangan.</p>

<p>"I don't see how they can," said the captain thoughtfully,
"but then when I worked with Larose in the Intelligence during
the war he was always springing surprises. He's as cunning as a
fox. Even in this present matter, I can't for the life of me
make out how he came to know it was I who used to visit
Glenowen. The many times I've been there I never gave my name
and I'm quite sure Glenowen would have never mentioned it, as he
was always scared lest his dealings with us should leak
out."</p>

<p>"Another thing," asked Mangan hesitatingly. "Do you think
it's only about the killing of Glenowen they want me? They have
no suspicion about anything else I've done."</p>

<p>The captain was a long while before he replied and then he
spoke very slowly. "I don't quite know," he said. "At any rate I
didn't think so at the time while Larose was questioning me
about you, but since then I've been wondering quite a lot. You
see that damned little fool of a professor told me that when you
were doing those other jobs for him he had been, what he called
it, keeping in touch with Larose to try to find out through him
how Scotland Yard was reacting to all the killings. With his
bungalow near to Carmel Abbey he said he used often to go over
for a chat. So&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The damned little fool!" swore Mangan. "Perhaps he made him
suspicious."</p>

<p>"That's what I wonder," nodded the captain, "and this past
hour I've been asking myself not a few times what had taken
Larose down to Scotland Yard that he happened to be hobnobbing
with the Chief Commissioner of Police at the very moment when
the news of Glenowen's killing came through."</p>

<p>Mangan felt a sickening feeling again in the pit of his
stomach. "But if they do trace me," he said sharply, "there
isn't a shadow of anything which can link up with any of
them."</p>

<p>The captain gave him an intent look. "What about that Corot
painting, which you took that night from the canon's house in
Cambridge?" he asked frowningly.</p>

<p>"Destroyed long ago," lied Mangan glibly, "and got rid of in
the same way Glenowen's manuscript was, burnt sheet by sheet and
put down the toilet." He smiled grimly. "He had written quite a
lot about you and what you had got him to find out from your
Army and Air Force friends. He mentioned particularly the £500
you had given him to pay that Air Force sergeant for a blue
print of those new gun sights."</p>

<p>"Never mind about that now," said the captain testily.
"That's all over and done with. Just concentrate upon what
you're going to do to keep out of the hands of the police. Be
thankful how darned lucky you are those two maids are such fools
that they could give no adequate description of you."</p>

<p>"I am," laughed Mangan, "and most grateful as well to you for
the not flattering description you gave this Larose of my
appearance. It should make me quite safe."</p>

<p>Their meal over, they left the resaurant singly, with Mangan
in quite a happy state of mind as he walked home to his flat in
Fitzroy Square. That conceited cockscomb, Larose, he told
himself, would have no miraculous success this time and he must
be pretty despondent about it.</p>

<p>However, Mangan would certainly have not been quite so
satisfied with everything had he been given to see the so hated
Larose at that very moment. The one-time detective was returning
from a visit he had just paid to the flat of the dead professor
in St. John's Wood and he was smiling confidently. Emma had
shown him out and he had left her looking flushed and very
excited. As she told the housekeeper, she felt like a girl in a
story book.</p>


<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>

GATHERING CLOUDS</h2>

<p class="first">NOTWITHSTANDING his confident assertion to
Captain Michaeloff that there was no possibility of his being
traced, Mangan passed a very uneasy and restless night following
upon his conversation with the Baltic Embassy attache while at
their meal together in the little restaurant off Tottenham Court
Road.</p>

<p>Certainly, among the millions of people in London the chances
of his running up against the dead professor's maid and being
recognised by her were infinitesimally small, but for all that,
if she <i>did</i> put the police on to him, as things were at
the present moment it would be realised at once that he was
Glenowen's murderer.</p>

<p>He had lied to the captain when he had told him he had
destroyed the professor's manuscript, as he had got every page
of it now in a drawer in his desk in the adjoining room. He had
kept it because it contained so many references to the
professor's collaboration with the Baltic Embassy that, with an
eye on the future, he sensed certain possibilities of blackmail.
Besides the manuscript he had also more than £300 in £5
banknotes that he had found in the professor's safe, and as the
notes were new and clean it was just possible some of these
numbers might have been taken at the bank.</p>

<p>Considering all this, as he always did in any emergency, he
acted quickly, and by nine o'clock the next morning was down
again at his shack on Canvey Island. To his relief he found
everything exactly as he had left it, and in a very few minutes
his latest acquisitions were added to the others already
there.</p>

<p>Driving back to Town he felt again in a perfectly assured
frame of mind. Let all the detectives in the kingdom do their
worst now, he told himself. They could not harm him. Even if by
some unlucky chance they <i>did</i> manage to link him up with
the dead professor's friend, Mr. Brown, it would not help them
in any way. He would admit frankly that he had been upon terms
of slight friendship with the professor, but upon the latter's
dreadful death had not come forward to the police because he had
nothing to tell them. It would be quite understandable, as no
one liked to be mixed up, however slightly, with any murder.</p>

<p>A fortnight went by, with Scotland Yard at as dead an end as
ever, and it looked as if the professor's murder was to be added
to the already long list of dreadful undiscovered crimes.</p>

<p>Then one morning Larose rang up Inspector Stone, saying he
was coming round to see him at once, as it was about time that
the idea he, Larose, had all along been cultivating should now
begin to bear fruit.</p>

<p>Stone was delighted, as all the years he had known Larose, as
he had impressed upon the Chief Commissioner of Police, Larose's
ideas had always been worth considering. However, he was
certainly rather surprised when Larose turned up bringing a
young girl with him.</p>

<p>"This young lady is going to help us," Larose said smilingly.
"If you remember&mdash;you have met her before."</p>

<p>With his usual politeness, the inspector had risen to his
feet upon the entrance of the girl and at once pulled out a
chair for her to sit down. He had, however, no recollection of
having seen her before and stared blankly.</p>

<p>The girl was smartly dressed in clothes evidently of the best
quality. She wore a taking little hat and her hair was
fashionably permed. She had just enough make-up to render her
piquant little face attractive. She looked out smilingly from a
dainty little pince-nez. With her nice little well-rounded
figure the inspector thought she was a very pleasing
proposition.</p>

<p>"But surely you remember her, inspector," said Larose in some
amusement, "Miss Emma Hobson whom you met at the late Professor
Glenowen's flat in St. John's Wood? You certainly asked her a
lot of questions then."</p>

<p>Great Scot! and the inspector's heavy face broke into a broad
smile. Yes, it was the maid, Emma, right enough, but what a
change in her! Certainly fine feathers <i>did</i> make a fine
bird and if he had not been told who she was he would never have
recognised her. He bowed smilingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, of course," he exclaimed, "and what a
fashionable young lady she looks now!"</p>

<p>"Well, inspector," said Larose, "she is certain she will be
able to recognise that Mr. Brown the moment she sees him, and so
we are going to give her the chance. She has left St. John's
Wood and is now staying with a cousin of my wife's in Berkeley
Square. In the mornings and afternoons she will go about on her
own, keeping her eyes well open all the time, but in the
evenings she will have for her escort as presentable a young
fellow as the Yard can provide and frequent those places of
entertainment and amusement where it is likely a man-about-Town
such as we imagine this Mr. Brown to be is likely to be found. I
have explained everything to her and what an important part she
is going to play in catching him."</p>

<p>The inspector was enthusiastic at once. "A splendid idea," he
exclaimed warmly, "and on the face of it it looks quite hopeful.
If that fellow has come into all this money we think he has
he'll certainly want to give it a run and get rid of some of it
on pleasure."</p>

<p>Larose took a paper out of his pocket. "And I've mapped out
what I consider a suitable programme for her. Every evening she
will dine at one of these fashionable restaurants mentioned here
and afterwards go on to a theatre or some cinema or anything
interesting that is going on. On Saturdays we shall want her all
day, as she will have to go the round of the Metropolitan race
meetings. In this way, even if it takes a good many weeks, I
reckon that sooner or later she will be bound to spot the
gentleman we want."</p>

<p>Stone addressed himself to the girl. "But are you sure, Miss
Hobson," he asked doubtfully, "that you <i>will</i> be able to
recognise him if you see him?"</p>

<p>The girl spoke confidently and in a pleasant tone of voice.
"Quite sure, sir," she said. "Ever since I have known what I
have to do I have recalled his face to my mind many, many
times."</p>

<p>"And you can see much better now," asked Stone, "in those
glasses you are wearing?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir," she laughed, "a hundred times, and I am
getting out of the way of screwing up my eyes whenever I look at
anyone. I realise I ought to have had glasses long ago."</p>

<p>"Good," exclaimed Stone, "and we've got the very man here
who'll do as a companion for you." He smiled. "He's well
educated and good looking and might pass anywhere as a young
baronet or even a peer of the realm."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Larose tells me, sir," said the girl a little
hesitatingly, "that all I have to do is to recognise him and
then my work is done. Mr. Larose is sure he won't remember me if
I meet him face to face."</p>

<p>Thinking of the drab and uninteresting little servant girl
whom he had met that morning those weeks ago in St. John's Wood,
Stone smiled confidently. "I'm quite certain he won't," he
assured her. "So, as you say, all you will have to do is to
point him out and leave the rest to us."</p>

<p>And then commenced for Emma Hobson surely as an exciting a
time as any young girl could ever wish to have. Mrs. Larose's
cousin, a Mrs. Craven, was most interested and made a great fuss
of her, making sure she always looked nice and attractive
whenever she went out.</p>

<p>Of a morning she got up late after breakfast in bed, and from
then until afternoon tea-time was free to roam about the West
End whenever she liked. A few minutes before six her escort,
Detective Gerald Halliard, called for her in a taxi, and a few
minutes later they were seated at a table near the door in some
fashionable restaurant, with Emma scrutinising every diner who
came in.</p>

<p>The dinner over, she was whisked away to some theatre or
picture-palace and there, by arrangement with the management,
through the side of the curtain or screen quizzed all the seated
patrons through a pair of strong Zeiss glasses. By the interval
time she had been taken off to somewhere else where the same
scrutiny with the glasses was gone through. On the Saturdays she
was taken to one of the Parks for the race meeting and, seated
in the grandstand, through the glasses again scanned round most
carefully upon everyone there. All the time close handy were two
other Scotland Yard men all ready to follow up the trail if she
gave the signal that she had spotted Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>At first every moment she was expecting to see him, but as
the days went by, though young Halliard saw to it that she did
not relax her vigilance, she began to become less and less
hopeful that she would meet with any success. Still, that did
not worry her much, as privately she was not looking forward to
the time when she would become a nonentity again. She was
enjoying herself immensely and under the continued round of
pleasure was unfolding herself like a pretty flower. She was
bright and animated and had quite lost all her shyness when with
young Halliard. Indeed, she had come to regard him as the Prince
Charming of her maiden dreams. From amusement at her innocence
and freshness, the young detective's feelings had begun to pass
into a tender regard and sometimes, to her intense delight, he
would hold her hand in the taxis, then sitting much closer to
her than the occasion demanded. Altogether she was a very
thrilled young woman in those supreme and maddening moments
which come to us all only in the first love affair of our
lives.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mangan, all unconscious of the happiness he
had brought to her, was enjoying himself, too. He had returned
to his former way of life as the well-to-do man about Town. In
good request everywhere, he was hail-fellow-well-met with men of
the best social standing and a great favourite with members of
the other sex. Many a young girl's heart fluttered delightedly
as she felt his close contact to her as they danced in some
fashionable restaurant or upon some ballroom floor.</p>

<p>As for his so recent bloody crimes, when he thought of them,
which was not often, they had been just pleasurable and very
profitable little adventures, it almost seemed, of many years
ago. He gave no longer any thoughts to detectives or the
unspeakable Gilbert Larose, and Scotland Yard was very far
away.</p>

<p>One thing, however, was certainly puzzling him, as the
usually very aloof Captain Michaeloff of the Baltic Embassy
appeared to have taken a sudden fancy to him. He had sought his
company quite a lot lately, going with him to social gatherings
and twice entertaining him to a <i>tete-a-tete</i> dinner at the
Baltic Embassy. Indeed, the captain was laying himself out to be
so friendly that Mangan, in his naturally suspicious nature, was
often asking himself what the man meant by it. "It's just as if
he is weighing me up," he told himself once with a grin, "to see
if I'm game enough to put a bullet in his Excellency." Mangan
always felt a little bit annoyed that he had never been
introduced to the Ambassador, or indeed never been allowed to
see him.</p>

<p>A whole month went by, with the little one-time maid of St.
John's Wood hearing nothing more of Larose. Then one morning the
latter, speaking from his house in Norfolk, rang up the
inspector.</p>

<p>"See here, Charlie," he said, "I've got a hunch that we've
got the best chance ever of catching that fine gentleman, as
to-night there's a good show on at the Shaftesbury Stadium. McRoy
Parker and Toby Boiler are wrestling for the championship belt,
and as they're both savage fellows everyone expects dirty
business. So it's just the very thing to make a strong appeal to
that killing brute. All the seats have been sold days and days
ago, but that girl can go early and wait in the foyer to see the
people pass in."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Gilbert," said Stone. "A great idea, and I'll
see that she's there."</p>

<p>Then, about one o'clock the next morning, Larose got sleepily
out of bed to answer a trunk call. He was, however, at once
galvanised into complete wakefulness at what he heard. It was
Inspector Stone speaking and he almost shrieked in his
excitement. "We've got him, Gilbert," he cried, "got him lock,
stock and barrel, and it all went off as clean as a whistle. She
spotted him at once, and when the show was over we had a whole
regiment of men waiting to trail him. Still, one of them would
have been quite sufficient, as he just walked home to a flat
he's got in Fitzroy Square and put himself to bed like any
respectable citizen."</p>

<p>"You've not arrested him?" queried Larose in great
excitement.</p>

<p>"No, for as yet we've not as you know got a single thing to
go on. But we've picketed the building where his flat is and at
seven o'clock in the morning I'm going in myself with a search
warrant. We should click as easily as shelling peas, and in all
probability find that picture and the money."</p>

<p>"But who is he?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Just the very kind of party you thought, Gilbert. A returned
soldier, a one-time commando, and he fits the bill in every way.
I tell you we've put in a week's enquiries in the last few hours
since he let himself into his flat. He's a Major Leon Mangan,
D.S.O., a tall and handsome wiry-looking chap who could throttle
anyone in two minutes. He lives the life of a well-to-do Society
man-about-Town, but oh boy, on the quiet he runs a smart art
business in Wardour Street. No wonder he couldn't resist that
valuable Corot painting."</p>

<p>"He has a car, of course?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, a Sphinx, and he garages it at a service station close
by in Fitzroy Square."</p>

<p>"Well, you be sure and find out from them there," ordered
Larose impressively, "if they mended a punctured tyre for him
upon the Monday following the Saturday night when those first
two murders were committed in Cambridge. They are sure to keep a
diary or day-book of some kind, and if they did&mdash;then I am
sure this fellow killed the policeman on the bridge when the
poor chap was helping him put on the spare wheel."</p>

<p>"All right," said Stone, "I'll be sure to see to that. Now I
suppose you won't be coming up to be in at the kill."</p>

<p>"Unhappily I can't," said Larose, "though I'd very much like
to. My wife's brother in Yorkshire is seriously ill and I've got
to take her up there to-day. If it seems likely he's going to
die I may have to remain up there for a few days. If not, I'll
perhaps come back to-morrow or the day after and then I'll come
straight on to you. In any case, don't phone me any more and
expect me when you see me."</p>

<p>However, it was not until the Thursday that Larose turned up
at Scotland Yard and then he found the inspector in the depths
of a black depression.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"It isn't well, Gilbert," sighed Stone. "It's as ill as it
can be"&mdash;he thumped upon his desk&mdash;"and though we are
certain as can be that the fellow is the multiple murderer,
there he is walking about as free as you and I with a leering
smile upon his handsome, evil face." He sighed again. "We have
absolutely nothing definite against him upon which to frame a
charge."</p>

<p>"Tell me what happened," frowned Larose, "all the details,
please."</p>

<p>"We were at his flat before seven on Sunday morning," began
the inspector, "and he opened the door to us himself in his
dressing-gown. Gad, if ever I saw guilt upon a man's face I saw
it on his then! He went a dreadful greeny colour and looked as
if he were going to faint. He had to lean up against the wall
for support. Still, he's a well-plucked one and soon pulled
himself together. He asked what we wanted and I produced my
search warrant. 'What are you looking for?' he asked, and I told
him several things. 'Good,' he remarked, with a mocking leer,
'and I hope you'll find them,' and he sat down and, smoking
cigarette after cigarette, watched us with as great an amusement
as if he were enjoying a funny play."</p>

<p>Stone shook his head mournfully. "Gilbert, I knew at once we
should find nothing there. He was too devilish cheeky and looked
so composed and cheerful all the time. Still, for two hours and
longer we searched that flat so thoroughly that I'm sure a
postage stamp even couldn't have been hidden away. He handed
over his keys and we went through his safe and the papers in his
desk and his bank pass-book as well. We went through all his
clothes and the only thing he couldn't explain satisfactorily
was a black overall hanging up in the wardrobe with a stain upon
one of the sleeves which looked like blood, and which later
<i>did</i> turn out to be human blood. Asked what he used it
for, he replied for dirty work upon his car, but one night he
had brought it up to the flat inadvertently from the garage and
had forgotten to take it back again. He couldn't remember how
long he had had it&mdash;it might have been quite a couple of
years."</p>

<p>"Where had he bought it?" asked Larose. "Of course, you asked
him?"</p>

<p>"Of course," nodded Stone, "but he said he didn't recollect.
He thought it was either in Grimsby or Hull when he was touring
about. 'But it's new,' I said contemptuously. 'It looks new,' he
smiled, 'and I believe I've only put it on about a couple of
times,' and I had to leave it at that."</p>

<p>Stone went on. "In the meantime Inspector Mendel had been
busy at the garage where he kept his car. He had roused the
proprietor and found, as you had expected, that he kept a day-book,
checking up at what times his clients brought in and took
out their cars, and the work done on them from time to time." He
spoke solemnly. "Gilbert, you were damned right! On Monday, June
28th, they mended a puncture on the spare wheel."</p>

<p>"What did he say to that?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute or two," said Stone, "all in its proper
order." He went on, "The search of the flat finished, I invited
him to come down here with me to be asked a few questions. He
was quite willing and here we came, bringing with us the garage
day-book. In the meantime, Inspector Ramsey had gone down to
Wardour Street to search the shop there."</p>

<p>The inspector paused for a long moment. "Gilbert," he said
impressively, "for five hours we grilled that fellow. There were
four of us shooting questions at him all the time, the Chief
Commissioner, Inspectors Mendel and Percival, and myself, and we
didn't catch him out once. Of course, many of his answers were
wholly unsatisfactory, but they didn't necessarily imply guilt.
For instance, he told us he could remember where he went on that
Sunday, June 27th, because he had had a puncture when coming
back from Brighton late that night. He had gone down to
Eastbourne in the morning and had a picnic lunch, with some
sandwiches he had taken with him, on the Downs. He had lazed
about near Beachy Head all the afternoon and then had gone to
the Metropole at Brighton for dinner. After that he sat
listening to the music on the pier and had not started for home
until nearly midnight. Of course, he had had no companion with
him, but he explained that was nearly always the case with him
on Sundays, as after a busy week he liked the peace and quiet by
himself."</p>

<p>"And upon the other days when crimes had been committed,"
asked Larose scoflingly, "of course he had taken his car out,
too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Stone, "and upon many other days when no crimes
were recorded as well. The devil of it was, according to the
garage day-book he took his car out almost every day. So we have
got nothing there."</p>

<p>"And how did he explain his many visits to Glenowen's?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"Quite naturally! He had made his acquaintance one week-end
when a guest of Lord Delamarne at Blackarden Castle in Norfolk.
A friendship had sprung up between them and of an evening after
dinner he often walked round to St. John's Wood to have a short
chat with him and get a bit of exercise after being shut up in
his place of business all day."</p>

<p>"And did he travel in champagne as that damned captain made
out to me?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Stone scowled. "No, but to back up what your Baltic friend
had evidently told him he had said to you, he made out he was
thinking of starting a bit of business on that line if he could
get the big order Glenowen had told him he probably <i>would</i>
get from the Baltic Embassy crowd."</p>

<p>"And he had been paying no large sums into his bank?"</p>

<p>Stone shook his head. "No, no trace of any. His balance then
was under £200, and another thing&mdash;we have visited all the
safe deposit places in London. He volunteered to come with us
and we took him. No one had seen him before and his signature
was in none of their books&mdash;no handwriting like his."</p>

<p>"Thats nothing," scoffed Larose. "He's got some other hiding
place somewhere."</p>

<p>Stone shrugged his shoulders. "But how are we to find it?
He's as cunning as a fox and, as I estimate his cautious
character, he may not go near it for years. Of course, our
trailing him to his flat must have been a terrible shock to him,
but after the first couple of minutes he played the part of an
innocent man and played it damned well, too. The Chief admits
now that he's prejudiced in his favour and I quite understand
it. The chap's got a splendid war record and that would go a
long way to impressing another military man such as Sir Robert
himself is."</p>

<p>"The Chief doesn't understand the criminal mind," snapped
Larose, "such as you and I do."</p>

<p>"Of course he doesn't, Gilbert," sighed the inspector, "but
for all that, if he had seen the fellow during those first
couple of minutes or so after he had opened his door to us on
Sunday morning I am sure even he would have been darned
suspicious of his guilt. I tell you this Major Mangan looked
awful."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and Larose remarked thoughtfully,
"He must wonder how we got on to him as that Mr. Brown?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he does, Gilbert," said Stone, "and the second time he
was down here&mdash;he came on Tuesday for more
questioning&mdash;he asked point blank how we came to do so. Of
course, we didn't tell him, and the Chief countered at
once&mdash;a very shrewd thrust I thought&mdash;how he came to
be masquerading at the professor's under an assumed name. He
just laughed and said he wasn't masquerading at all. He said it
was an eccentricity on Glenowen's part that he never liked his
servants to know anything of his private affairs. He explained
that the professor knew that his housekeeper had got the sack
from her former place for listening at doors and so all the time
she had been with him he had intended to gratify her curiosity
as little as possible. So he called all his friends Black, Brown
or White accordingly, as the fancy took him."</p>

<p>"A very lame excuse," scoffed Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, and that and the matter of the black overall," nodded
Stone, "and his lying to us that he had been specially invited
by Glenowen to meet Captain Michaeloff that Thursday night are
really the only points the Chief admits we have against
him."</p>

<p>"But what's the strength of the black overall?" asked Larose.
"I don't quite follow you there."</p>

<p>The inspector drew in a deep breath. "Mendel is very keen
about it. His obsession is that this fine major bought it
expressly to wear that night when he got into Canon Drew's
garden and murdered those two men in the dark."</p>

<p>Larose made a grimace. "One up on me there," he nodded a
little ruefully, "and it's not improbable he's right. I never
gave it a thought." He changed the subject. "Did you find any
weapons?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a German automatic, a Mauser, and he said he had
brought it home from the war. He had got no licence for it and
we collared it." The stout inspector heaved another of his big
sighs. "Well, Gilbert, what are we to do now?"</p>

<p>Larose smiled a sickly smde. "Wait until he commits another
murder, I suppose and see if we have better luck then. As our
friend Michaeloff was so anxious to prevent us getting hold of
him, it's pretty obvious the Baltic Embassy lot are quite aware
what he's been doing and how successful he's been. So, it's
quite on the cards they may consider him a useful tool and, when
things have settled down a bit, give him another job to do.
There are plenty of people they would like to see bumped off."
He made a grimace. "Yes, as it seems now that we've shot our
bolt, we'll have to wait for another mysterious murder to crop
up."</p>

<p>The inspector raised his hand. "And you look out for
yourself. Gilbert," he exclaimed warningly, "I'm a bit worried
about you, for when I took in this fellow's clever, evil face
that morning I thought at once that if ever I'd set eyes upon a
man who could be venomous and spiteful against anyone who
offended him I was looking at one then." He leant over and
pulled open a drawer in his desk. "Now you just look at the
photograph of him, which one of our photographers took unbeknown
to him when he was down here on Sunday morning. It's only an
enlarged snap, but it's a very good one and shows up every
feature quite clearly."</p>

<p>Larose took the photograph he held out, and his eye-brows
went up at once. "A good-looking face certainly, but, as you
say, not a nice one. A regular dare-devil who'd be afraid of
nothing. He doesn't look frightened here."</p>

<p>"And, by gad, he wasn't," agreed Stone instantly. "Directly
he's got over that first minute's fright, he was as bold and
confident all along. It was as good as a play watching him when
we were questioning him. We Yard men he treated like dirt and
was as rude as he possibly could be, but to the Chief he was
most damnably polite and deferential, for all the world as if he
were in the army again and speaking to a superior officer.
Butter wouldn't have melted in his mouth and I didn't wonder the
Chief was impressed."</p>

<p>"You say he was with the Resistance Movement in France?"
asked Larose, with his eyes intent upon the photograph.</p>

<p>"Yes, and according to all accounts," replied Stone, "he did
such a fine job there that the Huns were offering a huge reward
to anyone who would catch or kill him. During the last year of
the war he was the leader of a particular Partisan group near
the Auvergne Mountains, the killer-in-chief of a little band."
He laughed. "That's why he's taken to murder again so
readily."</p>

<p>"Here, lend me this photo," said Larose, "or better still
let's have a loan of the negative."</p>

<p>"No need to do either," said Stone, "as I've had a dozen
taken off and enlarged in case they should ever come in useful.
So you can keep that one for yourself." He looked very troubled.
"But you take note of my warning, for Michaeloff is certain to
have told him of your interest in the case and I should say
he'll have good suspicions of you being responsible for most of
his trouble. So you beware of his trying to get his
revenge."</p>

<p>"I've already thought about it, Charlie," said Larose, "and
am going to safeguard myself straight away. I believe in taking
the bull by the horns and, if you give me the number of his shop
in Wardour Street, I may go there this morning and have a little
chat with him."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the inspector, with his eyes opened
very wide. "You mean make yourself known to him?"</p>

<p>"I might, Charlie," smiled Larose. "I'll see how the cat
jumps."</p>

<p>Some half an hour later Larose went into the little shop in
Wardour Street. There was a woman customer there and she was
inspecting some vases. She was being attended to by a man whom
Larose recognised at once as Major Mangan. Walking idly round,
ostensibly to look over the various articles exposed for sale,
he took good stock of him and could not but help regarding him
with some approval. Undoubtedly good-looking, he carried himself
well and there was a certain poise and dignity about him. He
looked all over what people call a gentleman, and, but for
Larose's long association with the criminal classes, he would
not for one moment have credited him as being, as they believed,
a callous murderer.</p>

<p>When the woman customer had gone out, Larose expressed his
interest in a pair of small silver candlesticks, the price of
which Mangan said was eighteen guineas. Larose demurred, it was
too high and, after some little argument, it was agreed he
should pay only sixteen.</p>

<p>"You'll take a cheque," he said, "and then I'll get you to
mail them on to me at my home address. The cheque will be on a
London bank and you can, of course, cash it before you put the
candlesticks into the post."</p>

<p>Mangan was quite agreeable and, sitting down at a desk,
Larose wrote out a cheque and, rising to his feet again, handed
it over. Mangan glanced over it carelessly and then&mdash;his
eye-brows straightened, his eyes flashed venomously and his face
became black as thunder. "You&mdash;the Gilbert Larose who used
to be in the C.I.D. at Scotland Yard," he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"The same," nodded Larose. He smiled. "Does it convey
anything to you?"</p>

<p>"The hell it does," scowled Mangan savagely, "for if I'm not
very much mistaken, it's you whom I have to thank for the
indignities that have been put upon me these last few
days&mdash;the searching through of my flat and the thousand
questions from those uncouth men."</p>

<p>"And haven't you well deserved everything?" asked Larose
mildly. His voice hardened. "Are you not damned lucky to be here
as you are now, instead of shut up in some prison cell waiting
for your trial upon more than one capital charge?"</p>

<p>"You think so?" sneered Mangan. "You're very clever, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Not so very clever," laughed Larose, "but I've cultivated
the knack of putting two and two together." He nodded
significantly. "Remember I saw a lot of Professor Glenowen in
those last weeks he lived and I gradually got to the bottom of
his mind. Whenever you had done a job for him he came buzzing
round me to try and find out what the police thought about it.
At first I couldn't make out what he was after, but I tumbled to
it at last."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," scowled Mangan, "but the whole idea
is preposterous. As for that little idiot professor&mdash;he was
mad and the asylum was the proper place for him."</p>

<p>"An asylum or a coffin," commented Larose grimly, "and you
realised that just a few hours before we picked you out as the
killer. We were just that little bit too late and
think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not interested in what you think," interrupted Mangan
sharply. He regarded Larose intently. "But I admit I'm mildly
curious as to how you came to find out Glenowen and I knew each
other."</p>

<p>"Well, let's exchange information," smiled Larose blandly.
"There are no witnesses and everything we say can be treated as
confidential between ourselves. So you tell me, first, how the
professor came to approach you with his dreadful proposition and
then I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He never made any propositions to me, dreadful or
otherwise," broke in Mangan savagely, "and no one would have
ever made the propositions you want to make out he did unless he
were completely out of his mind. Only a madman would dream of
such things."</p>

<p>"Well, but you have just said the professor <i>was</i> mad!"
exclaimed Larose as if in great surprise. "So if he didn't make
these dreadful suggestions to you&mdash;in what other way did
you find he was not sane?"</p>

<p>For the moment, Mangan was obviously nonplussed, and his face
flushed angrily. "Oh, I'm not going to discuss him or anyone
else with you," he snarled. "In any case you are only trying to
poke your beak into what doesn't concern you." He looked
viciously at Larose. "As I have told you just now, Mr. Retired
Policeman Larose, I am pretty certain I owe all this damned
annoyance to you and I tell you straight I'm not the one to
forget it." He gritted his teeth. "Sooner or later, I always
repay for service or dis-service rendered."</p>

<p>"And that's exactly what's brought me here to see you this
morning," Larose nodded with some animation. "My friends in
Scotland Yard are sure you'll be trying to get your revenge
somehow and so they've asked me to give you the message that if
anything evil happens to me they'll come on to you at
once&mdash;" he nodded again&mdash;"and you'll want a much
better alibi then than you've put up in this present
trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall, shall I," sneered Mangan. "How anxious they
must be about your good health?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and here's another thing, Major, that may interest
you," said Larose, taking the photograph the inspector had given
him out of his pocket and handing it over. He spoke casually.
"Do you think it a good enough likeness for anyone to recognise
you if you come snooping round where I live?"</p>

<p>Mangan took the photo and glared hard. "Where did you get
that from?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Telling's knowing," laughed Larose, "but they have evidently
got you well tabbed at Scotland Yard and you won't be able to
move about much now without being noticed," and when Mangan
contemptuously tore the photo into many pieces, he laughed
merrily. "They're getting a good many dozen taken off, so that
one doesn't matter at all."</p>

<p>"Here, you get out of my shop," ordered Mangan angrily, "and
take your damned cheque, too," and he tore up the cheque as he
had done the photo. "Get out quick."</p>

<p>"A nice gentleman that," remarked Larose to himself as he
walked up the street, "and certainly, as dear old Charlie said,
of the very type to go for his revenge upon me. I must look out
for myself, though I think he's pretty frightened now and will
keep quiet for awhile&mdash;perhaps until we've had time to
catch him in another way."</p>

<p>Now if Mangan was thinking Scotland Yard had shot their bolt
and would slacken off in their enquiries, it was certainly not
the case with Larose. The latter was quite sure the major had
not only got those thousands of pounds in banknotes hidden away,
but also, had secreted that Corot painting along with them, too.
It was almost impossible he told himself for any judge of
beautiful paintings to have brought himself to destroy one of
the great Jean Baptiste Corot.</p>

<p>So, sooner or later when he had got over his fright, it was
almost certain Mangan would not be able to resist the urge to go
back to his hiding-place and see if what he had left there was
safe. Surely then it was only a matter of time and great
patience before the trail could be picked up?</p>

<p>With this end in view, Larose made his way next to the garage
in Fitzroy Square. It was quite a small affair with apparently
only two men working there. The elder of them at once came
forward. "You Mr. Tom Pike?" asked Larose, "then can I have a
word with you in private?"</p>

<p>Regarding him with a frown the man led the way into a little
office. "You've been having some officers in from Scotland Yard
lately," began Larose with a smile. "Now, I am nothing to do
with them officially, though I am completely in their
confidence, as years ago I was one of the Criminal Investigation
Department myself. My name is Gilbert Larose
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man's suspicious face at once broke into a pleasant
smile. "Oh, you're Mr. Larose, are you?" he exclaimed. "I've
heard a lot about you from my brother. He was at the Yard the
same time as you were. Now, he's a sergeant at Hammersmith.
Inspector Stone will remember him quite well."</p>

<p>"Good," said Larose, "then I am sure I can trust you, and
you'll treat in strict confidence what I am going to tell
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can trust me right enough," said Pike. "I'm not the
one to babble." He shook his head. "I don't pretend to know what
all these enquiries have been about, but as he's now going about
just as usual it's evident Scotland Yard has got nothing on
Major Mangan."</p>

<p>Larose looked doubtful. "I wouldn't quite say that, Mr. Pike.
They still have the strongest suspicions about him, though it's
quite true that as yet they haven't all the proof they
want."</p>

<p>Tom Pike spoke hesitatingly. "May I ask you, sir, to tell me
something of what the trouble is about? You see the major has
been garaging here for quite a couple of years and I've always
found him a straightforward and pleasant man to have any
dealings with."</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "You probably would have. He has a nice way
with him, and certainly has had a distinguished career in the
army or they wouldn't have given him the D.S.O." He shook his
head. "No, I can't tell you everything, but this I will say.
They suspect him of having run down and killed that poor
policeman from Royston upon the Saturday night before the Monday
when you last repaired a punctured tyre for him. Do you happen
to remember a country policeman being killed and his bicycle as
well as his body being afterwards thrown over a bridge?"</p>

<p>"Happen to remember!" exclaimed Pike with a scowl. "My oath,
yes! I knew him well. He was Bert Harkness and he used to pass
here twice a day for years before he was transferred to the
country. He was attached to the Euston Road Police-station and,
living in Cleveland Street, came through the square every
morning and evening, going on duty and coming off. It was a
great shock to me to hear of his death, as I knew him so
well."</p>

<p>For the moment Larose was speechless in his amazement, for it
had flashed like lightning into his mind that if the dead
policeman had known Mangan by sight what a vital reason the
latter had had for murdering him.</p>

<p>"Great Scot!" he exclaimed hoarsely. "What a strange thing it
happens you know him! Do you think he and Major Mangan had ever
seen each other before?"</p>

<p>"For sure they had," said Pike emphatically, "and how could
it not have been with Bert Harkness passing here every morning
just before nine, the very time when the major generally picks
up his car? Bert knew all about him, too, because we had
discussed him together, but I don't suppose for a moment they
had even spoken, as the major is a rather haughty sort of chap
and wouldn't have taken any notice of a policeman, though he
must have known him well enough by sight." His face darkened
angrily. "So you think it was the major who killed him.
Damn&mdash;I wish it could have been brought home to him!"</p>

<p>"But it's not about that I want you to help me," said Larose.
"It's about quite another matter. We suspect him of having got
some stolen things of great value hidden away and we haven't the
remotest idea where. Now I don't suppose you know if he's got a
place somewhere in the country, a cottage for instance?"</p>

<p>Pike shook his head. "No, I don't, sir. You see he has his
car out almost every day and practically every week-end."</p>

<p>"And you've never learnt where he goes?"</p>

<p>"No, except that in the summer," said Pike, "when it's fine
he goes a lot to the seaside. I am sure of that because he has
often taken his bathing things with him. Oh, yes, and I saw him
once one Sunday at Leigh-on-Sea, and another time my boy saw him
coming out of a shop in Benflect, that's on the way to there. I
fancy that when he wants to have a bathe he makes his journey as
short as possible because of the petrol. It's damned short these
days, as you know, and that's why he goes down the Thames
Estuary way." He frowned. "Oh, and another thing I remember now.
One evening when he had brought his car in and, later, we were
cleaning it we noticed what a lot of sand there was, all about
the car."</p>

<p>"When was that?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Only a few weeks ago, and it only struck us then as being
peculiar because it was a day in the early part of the week when
as a rule he uses his car only about Town."</p>

<p>Larose was thoughtful for a few moments and then went on,
"Well, this is what I want you to do. If you keep a daily note
for me from his speedometer of the miles he travels in his car,
I'll pay you a fiver on the first of every month for your
trouble. Also, keep your eyes open to notice anything unusual
about his car, for instance, whether he's been off the bitumen
and gone over muddy roads."</p>

<p>Larose left the garage well satisfied that he had enlisted as
enthusiastic an ally as he could have hoped for. Pike was very
bitter about the killing of his policeman friend, Bert, and
would watch Mangan now with the eyes of a hawk.</p>

<p>Now the one-time detective was quite right in thinking that,
with all his toughness and courage, Mangan had been badly shaken
and would keep very quiet at any rate for a while. Though still
perfectly confident that nothing could possibly be brought home
to him, the fact that the police had somehow managed to trail
him to his flat in Fitzroy Square nevertheless filled him with
an uneasy pang whenever he thought about it. Cursing himself as
a fool to think it possibly could be, it was yet exactly as if
Larose had used that extra sense he was supposed to possess and
picked up some clue that did not actually exist.</p>

<p>He would have greatly liked to talk things over with Captain
Michaeloff, but knew that for the time being it was not
possible, as two days previously the latter had gone abroad
somewhere and would not be back for two or three weeks. He did
not bother to ring up the Embassy about him as, with the
friendship now prevailing between them, he was quite certain he
would hear from him directly he returned.</p>

<p>Waiting rather impatiently, it was nearly three weeks before
the phone rang one morning and he recognised it was the captain
who was speaking. He seemed to Mangan to be in the best of
spirits and invited him up to dinner at the Embassy that evening
at eight o'clock. He apologised for giving Mangan such short
notice, but explained he particularly wanted to see him about a
little business matter and hoped he'd be able to come. Mangan
accepted the invitation and the captain rang off.</p>

<p>Mangan grinned to himself. "So, I've been right all along. As
I thought, he's been playing me up lately, and now I shall find
out what he's been doing it for."</p>

<p>He had made up his mind exactly how he would meet the captain
and, accordingly, when he was shown into him that evening, shook
hands with him in his usual confident but rather casual way. The
captain was all smiles and, from his manner, Mangan was quite
certain, as he had been anticipating, he could not have heard
anything about the trouble he, Mangan, had been in.</p>

<p>"And how have you been finding things, Major?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They're quite all right now," replied Mangan, "but I had an
annoying time a little while back." He looked grimly at
Michaeloff. "Somehow, but in what way I can only guess, the
police identified me as that Mr. Brown and getting on for three
weeks ago now came and searched my flat."</p>

<p>The captain looked dumbfounded and his face paled a little.
"The devil!" he exclaimed. "What happened?"</p>

<p>Mangan shrugged his shoulders. "Nothing, of course! But they
made me go down to Scotland Yard on the Sunday and the Tuesday
and bombarded me with every question they could think of. I was
honoured by the Chief Commissioner himself, Sir Robert Ellis,
being present on both occasions," and he proceeded to tell
Captain Michaeloff all that happened.</p>

<p>The captain was frowning hard as Mangan began his story, but
towards the end his face had cleared and he no longer looked
uneasy.</p>

<p>"Then they had absolutely nothing on you," he said sharply.
"You are quite sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Quite," replied Mangan, "and the proof is they had to let me
go. In parting the Chief Commissioner's manner was quite
agreeable. Really, I believe he was feeling sorry for me and
thought the whole thing a mare's nest." He grinned. "But those
damned inspectors didn't and the expressions upon their faces
was venomous right up to the very end."</p>

<p>"But you couldn't have been so clever as you thought," said
Michaeloff, beginning to frown again. "You must have left some
clue behind you that night or they wouldn't have been able to
trail you as they have done."</p>

<p>"But I tell you I didn't leave any clue," said Mangan with
some irritation. "If I had, surely it wouldn't have taken all
this time for them to follow it up." He shook his head. "No,
that damned Larose found out something in some other way&mdash;a
lucky guess somewhere which happened to be right. I'm sure I owe
it all to him."</p>

<p>"You probably do," scowled the captain, "but don't you think
of starting to pay him out, at any rate not for a hell of a long
time. He was quite right when he told you you'd be the first
person they'd jump upon if anything happened to him."</p>

<p>"You trust me," nodded Mangan viciously, "and when anything
<i>does</i> happen I shan't have done it myself. I know someone
who was in the Resistance Movement in France with me who can hit
a saucer every time at six hundred yards and I'll get him to
take the job over. He'll jump at it if I will make it worth his
while." He shook his head. "You see, Captain, I shall never be
quite easy in my mind again until that devil's under the
ground."</p>

<p>"And you have good reason there," said the captain, "for he
hangs on like a bull-dog once he's got his teeth fixed into
anything. Fancy, his having the impudence to come to make
himself known to you." He frowned. "He didn't mention me by any
chance, did he? No! Then did any of the others bring up my name
when they were questioning you? They didn't, eh?" He looked
thoughtful. "Well, that's exactly typical of Larose's cunning.
He had expressly told them not to. He must be pretty certain now
that I know something of what you've been doing and perhaps he
even thinks we have been working together, with me as a sort of
sleeping partner. So he wants me to believe he has no suspicion
that I gave him a purposely wrong description of you as Mr.
Brown, because he doesn't want to fall out with me."</p>

<p>"Why not?" frowned Mangan.</p>

<p>"Because he wants to continue friendly with me and perhaps
call round for a chat in the hope that I may make a slip
somewhere and give something away. As I tell you, he's as
cunning as a fox is, this Mr. Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>They continued to discuss the matter for some time and then
the captain remarked in a crisp and business-like way, "Well, as
all these weeks have gone by, they've evidently played all their
cards and are not going to trouble you any more. So, now for
this other matter I want to talk to you about." He eyed Mangan
intently. "Now, we hear you are very friendly with young
Lieutenant Avon, old Lord Delamarne's heir, and from time to
time are a guest of his lordship at Blackarden Castle."</p>

<p>Mangan wondered how he had come to know that, but, by no
means displeased the captain should be aware of his good
standing in the social world, nodded carelessly. "Yes, I've
stayed there several times, and I've just been invited to go up
there again next month for a few days shooting. It's a most
luxurious place to stay in. Everything of the very best, with
vintage wines being poured out as if they cost no more than
ginger-ale."</p>

<p>"What everyone knows!" said the captain sharply. "But has it
never made you curious," he demanded, "how, besides giving away
the large sums in charity that we read in the newspapers, he
does, and being, too, such an ardent collector of costly and
beautiful things, he yet in his private home manages to keep up
all the extravagance of the old days, with men-servants and
maid-servants and all the pomp and ceremony of a mediaeval lord,
to say nothing of the vintage wines you mention? Haven't you
ever wondered where he gets all the money from?" He shook his
head. "He can't be doing it out of his income, with his taxes
probably running into eighteen shillings in the pound."</p>

<p>"But if you know so much about him," smiled Mangan, "surely
you must have heard that he's supposed to be drawing upon secret
hoards that he's got hidden away in the underground parts of the
castle?"</p>

<p>"You mean from what his grandfather had stolen," frowned the
captain, "from some Rajah's palace at the time of the Indian
Mutiny? Yes, of course we've heard that, but I don't believe it.
In any case it's not the whole story of where he's been getting
all this money he has been throwing about so lavishly."</p>

<p>"But you're not going to tell me," exclaimed Mangan, roused
to great interest, "that you've found out he's got another
gold-mine?"</p>

<p>"I am," nodded the captain, "and in the beginning it must
have been many, many times of far greater value than anything
his grandfather could have obtained from the mythical Rajah." He
spoke impressively. "Now, Major Mangan, when you have heard what
I am going to tell you, you will realise what a tremendous
secret we are confiding to you and that it has only been done
after the most careful consideration we can feel sure that,
making it well worth your while, you will be true to your
trust."</p>

<p>From his expression, Mangan did not seem altogether too
pleased at the way the other was summing him up, but he made no
comment, and the captain went on, "Yes, we know far more about
you than you think, even to the way you are making your money in
Wardour Street, with the police watching you like a cat after a
mouse."</p>

<p>"Oh, they are, are they?" scowled Mangan. "How did you come
to know that?"</p>

<p>"Our Intelligence Service is very good," replied the captain,
"and we have agents placed in most unexpected places, places
which would astonish you if I were free to tell you." He laughed
slyly. "So we know you are what the world would call an
absolutely bad and thoroughly unscrupulous man. Where your own
interests are concerned you have no foolish, sentimental ideas
of the sacredness of life or property and we
notice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But who are these 'we' you keep talking about?" broke in
Mangan with some irritation. "Have you been starting a broadcast
about me?"</p>

<p>The captain laughed again. "Certainly not! Over here, the
'we' means only His Excellency and myself. Beyond these shores
it includes some of the heads of the Baltic Union. No, you need
never worry that, so to speak, you are in our power, as what I
am about to tell you will place us equally in yours." He spoke
slowly. "Now this secret can be put in a very few words.
Briefly&mdash;some thirty years ago Lord Delamarne came into
possession of a portion of the Russian Crown jewels and ever
since he has been disposing of them and taking the monies for
his own use. What is now left of them lies hidden in the
Blackarden vaults."</p>

<p>All his irritation now put to one side, Mangan's eyes opened
very wide. "But how did he get hold of them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It's not a long story," said the captain, "though it does go
back for thirty years. It commenced in 1917 when Nicolas the
Second, the then Czar of all the Russias, realised things were
beginning to look very black for his regime and took precautions
to ensure that the royal treasures should not fall into
revolutionary hands. So, he divided them into portions, with
each portion being entrusted into different hands to convey to a
different place of safety. Much of the treasure was recovered in
the succeeding years, but what a certain Colonel Alexis Rubin of
the Czar's Own Hussars had taken away with him was never found.
This officer, in particular, was energetically looked for,
because it was known he had been entrusted with the most
valuable portion of all sacramental vessels of almost
unestimable value, jewelled pattens, chalices and crosses and,
above all, a priceless richly diamond-studded Ikon, a replica of
the Iberian Madonna."</p>

<p>"Whew! what a haul if you could have got hold of it!"
whistled Mangan.</p>

<p>"Yes, it would have been a colossal one if we could have
recovered everything," agreed the captain, "but this Colonel
Rubin had absolutely vanished, with no traces of him or what he
had taken away ever coming to light. In the end it came to be
believed that he must have put the treasure away somewhere and,
then dying, the secret of its hiding-place would be never
found."</p>

<p>He drew in a deep breath. "So things were up to about six
months ago and then came the startling news from one of our
secret agents in New York&mdash;we always have agents watching
over our interests in all parts of the world&mdash;that a
magnificently jewelled chalice which, from its description with
diamonds, emerald and three wonderfully perfect pigeon-blood
rubies, we were certain was one of those this Colonel Rubin had
carried away, had recently been put anonymously upon the market
and sold for two hundred thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"No means of tracing where it came from?" asked Mangan.</p>

<p>"Not a hope," replied the captain, "but, from what we
<i>did</i> find out, we were pretty certain it wasn't by any
means the first things that had been disposed of by the same
seller and that they had all, apparently, been smuggled into the
U.S.A. from England."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "Of course, that spurred us on to
start the search for this Colonel Rubin all over again, and I
take it to my credit that it was I, myself, who ultimately
picked up his trail here in London. Quite certain that being
attached to the Czarist Court he would have belonged to the
Greek Orthodox Church, I enquired at the Greek Church here in
Tavistock Square. The old sacristan remembered him quite well,
but knew nothing of what had happened to him when he suddenly
stopped coming to the church. Enquiring as to what friends
Colonel Rubin had had, he had a clear recollection of two, a
Father Benoist and, as he described him, a great English lord,
Lord Delamarne. He remember this lord, because occasionally the
colonel used to bring him into High Mass to listen to the music,
and he believed used to stay with him in his castle in the
country."</p>

<p>"And you've approached Lord Delamarne?" asked Mangan. "You
have seen him yourself?"</p>

<p>"Not I," laughed the captain. "I did not dare to go near him,
as I know he hates all of us here like poison. Still, we got a
party whom we could absolutely trust to go down and talk to him,
and he said he could tell at once that Delamarne was keeping
something back, as he was most evasive in all his replies. At
first he made out he did not remember the name at all, but then,
upon consideration, he thought he had heard it mentioned, adding
however, that he had met so many refugees from Russia about that
time that he couldn't keep count of them."</p>

<p>"If he didn't want to tell you," frowned Mangan, "he
certainly wouldn't. He's not a man you can brow-beat into
anything."</p>

<p>"Failing there," went on the captain, "I got in touch with an
aged sister of this Father Benoist, the other friend. The Father
himself has been dead for more than twenty years. She was living
alone in poor circumstances in Hammersmith and was most
difficult to get anything out of, as she was very shaky and her
memory was failing. She couldn't recollect having heard of
anyone called Rubin, but then suddenly the Christian name of
Alexis struck some chord of memory in her and piece by piece I
wrung from her an extraordinary story. The gist of it was
this."</p>

<p>The captain paused for a few moments before going on
impressively. "She was with her brother in his last illness just
before he died, and she said that when he was only semi-conscious
he babbled a lot about someone called Alexis. She
thought something was evidently on his mind about him, and she
gathered from his broken sentences that he had once gone a long
journey to bury him. He had said the Requiem Mass for him one
night in a place that was very dark and cold and he spoke about
vaults, and lanterns that gave only a dim light. She said he
kept harping about this cold and darkness and it made her shiver
and&mdash;" but here Michaeloff broke off his story and asked
Mangan sharply, "Now what do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"That there had been a secret burial somewhere," said Mangan
promptly, "most probably in the vaults of Blackarden Castle and
that it was on the Father's conscience that he had been mixed up
in something he didn't like to look back upon, something rather
discreditable to his sacred calling."</p>

<p>"Exactly," exclaimed Michaeloff, "and the whole picture of
everything is now quite clear to me. Colonel Rubin had taken the
Czarist treasures with him to Blackarden Castle, he had died
suddenly, and Delamarne was left in sole possession of a vast
fortune."</p>

<p>A long silence followed and then Mangan asked, "And how long
ago did you learn all this?"</p>

<p>"Only a few months, between three and four."</p>

<p>"And you have done nothing in the matter?"</p>

<p>Michaeloff shrugged his shoulders again. "What could we do,
at least, openly? We have only one very strong suspicion in our
minds, amounting, however, to a certainty, and if ever we could
prove it up to the very hilt, we dare not approach the British
Government. They would not acknowledge our title to the
treasure."</p>

<p>"But if Delamarne has been dipping into it for all these
years now," suggested Mangan, "can there be anything much
left?"</p>

<p>The captain looked scornful. "Anything much left!" he
exclaimed. "Why, we reckon that it was worth several millions to
begin with and, selling it bit by bit as he has been doing, he
can't have got rid of even a quarter of it yet. So, if we can
lay our hands upon it with your help&mdash;just think what it
will mean to you. We are quite agreeable that ten per cent
should be your share."</p>

<p>Mangan's eyes glistened at the prospect. "But do you know,"
he asked, "where he's got it all hidden away?"</p>

<p>"There can be no question about that," said the captain. "In
the vaults, of course, and once down there we think we should
have no difficulty in finding it. As everybody has heard, all
the underground parts of the castle were bricked up more than a
hundred years ago and, since then, the only way down to them has
been by way of a concealed stairway, the secret approach to
which only the reigning lord of Blackarden knows." He frowned.
"Surely you've heard all about that?"</p>

<p>Mangan lowered his eyes so that the captain should not see
the expression in them. With a great thrill he was remembering
what the dead professor had told him he had learnt about that
stairway of seventy-two steps from the Italian electrician who
had been working with such secrecy in the castle, and the idea
was now surging up into his mind that if the finding of this
great treasure was going to be so easy it might be possible he
could obtain it for himself. So, he certainly would not tell the
captain what he knew.</p>

<p>Looking up, he said aloud, "Yes, I've heard all about
it&mdash;"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"and so has everyone else in
the castle and for many miles outside it, too. It's such common
knowledge and has been known for such a long time that no one
seems to be much interested in it now."</p>

<p>"Well, we are," smiled back the captain, "and we have gone so
far in our investigations as to know within a few feet or so
exactly where the door to that secret stairway opens into one of
the walls of his study." He shook his head. "We haven't had it
open yet, but, as I say, we know it is behind one of the oak
panels there. We could get into it with a crowbar in a couple of
minutes, but we don't want to do that if we can possibly help
it. Our hope is to get those jewels and leave no traces behind
how they have been taken."</p>

<p>"But how on earth did you find out what you have done?" asked
Mangan in great astonishment.</p>

<p>The captain looked glum. "Up to a couple of months ago we had
an agent planted in the castle and he was finding out quite a
lot of things for us. Then&mdash;" but he broke off what he was
about to say and asked sharply, "You've heard, haven't you,
about that servant who disappeared so suddenly from the castle
the month before last?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the footman there," nodded Mangan, "the third one,
called Thomas. Was he the agent, and did you have to call him
off?"</p>

<p>The captain shook his head. "No, Major Mangan," he said
solemnly, "we did not call him off. He made a slip somewhere and
got caught." He pursed up his lips. "No one will ever hear of
him again."</p>

<p>Mangan whistled. "The devil!" he exclaimed. "Do you think it
was Delamarne's work?"</p>

<p>"We are sure of it," said the captain, "and I warn you that
you'll have to be on the look-out." He gritted his teeth. "That
old lord is every bit as tough as we intend to be."</p>

<p>"But why should he have gone so far as to kill him?" asked
Mangan. "Why didn't he just send him away from the castle?"</p>

<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders. "That's what we don't
know. We think Delamarne must have caught him red-handed in
something he was doing and realised he had found out too much.
This chap of ours was a brave man and always ready to take great
risks. In his last communication to us, which I am going to show
you now, he writes that he has found this secret panel, but will
have to wait for another night to find out how it works. One
splendid thing he <i>did</i> do was to take to pieces the
special lock fitted to the study door and send to us a
carefully-drawn diagram of all its parts. So, we have been able
to have a key made, and that should help you a lot in what we
want you to do, as you will now be able to get into the study
whenever you want to."</p>

<p>"But in what particular way am I to help you?" asked
Mangan.</p>

<p>"Open some door and let us into the castle one night," said
the captain. "That has been our great stumbling block, because
of the bars and bolts and alarms that Delamarne has had fixed to
all the doors. With you inside the castle, that can all be put
right and a great difficulty got over."</p>

<p>"But even if you do get down into the vaults," said Mangan
with the idea of treachery still upmost in his mind, "how is it
you are so certain you will so easily find exactly where the
jewels are hidden? Remember those vaults will probably extend
all under the castle."</p>

<p>"But our opinion," went on the captain decisively, "is that
there will be no elaborate hiding-place there. We think
Delamarne is relying entirely upon the many precautions he has
taken up above and banking upon the numerous alarms he has had
installed everywhere. In any case, we have an excellent man in
one of our Secret Police, whose speciality is searches such as
this. He can smell out any hiding-place just like a terrier
smelling out a rat. He would stick at nothing, either, and not
mind what we gave him to do."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and Mangan asked, "But have you
never thought of getting hold of the old lord somehow and giving
him a twist or two to make him speak?"</p>

<p>The captain nodded grimly. "Yes, we have, and it's not
altogether out of our minds yet. In fact, we bought Professor
Glenowen's bungalow in case we have to resort to that. It's
quite handy to the castle and, if we kidnapped him one morning
when he was in the garden there, it would be such a little way
to take him and get the whole business over quickly, perhaps
even before he was missed." He laughed. "I expect you would be
able to give us a wrinkle or two about the best way to make him
loquacious, as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>Mangan laughed back. "Perhaps, I might. At any rate, we saw
plenty of it in France. The Huns did it and we did it, too.
Then, when we had got all the information we wanted&mdash;" he
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"well, dead men tell no tales."</p>

<p>The captain unlocked a drawer in his desk, and took out some
papers. "This is what that poor fellow wrote us," he said,
"perhaps only a few hours before he was killed and buried
somewhere, most probably in the castle vaults. Draw your chair
nearer and read what he wrote."</p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>

THE LORD OF BLACKARDEN CASTLE</h2>

<p class="first">ON the afternoon of the day following upon
Mangan's momentous conversation with Captain Michealoff of the
Baltic Embassy, the old lord of Blackarden Castle in the county
of Norfolk was sitting alone in his beautifully appointed study
with its centuries-old oak panelled walls. He had a book in his
hand, but his eyes were not upon its pages. Instead, they were
staring thoughtfully out of the window, with the general
expression of his face a frowning and rather troubled one.</p>

<p>There was a knock upon the door and, in response to his curt
'Come in,' Barlow, the castle butler, entered the room and held
out to him a letter upon a massive silver salver.</p>

<p>"A young lady has brought it, my lord," he said
deferentially. "She would not give her name and is waiting for
an answer. I have shown her into the blue room."</p>

<p>His master took the letter without comment and opened it. It
was very short and soon read. "How has she come?" he asked
sharply.</p>

<p>"In a taxi from Norwich, my lord. She has a suitcase with
her."</p>

<p>"A suitcase!" exclaimed his lordship.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, and she sent the taxi away."</p>

<p>His lordship regarded the butler with a heavy frown. "What
kind of young lady is she?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well dressed and well spoken. Not of a common class, my
lord."</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne scowled and quite a long silence ensued before
he ordered curtly, "Show her in."</p>

<p>Alfred Humbert Delamarne, the eleventh baron of his line,
looked all over what he had been for the greater part of his
life&mdash;a soldier. His long military career had been a
distinguished one. As a young lieutenant he had fought under
Lord Methuen in the Boer War and, after the disastrous defeat at
Magersfontein, been awarded the Victoria Cross for conspicuous
gallantry. Next, he had seen active service in Afghanistan and,
finally, had been all through the First World War. He had been
wounded twice in France, the second time being left with a
slight limp.</p>

<p>Of medium height and physique, though now in his seventy-fifth
year, he lacked nothing of a commanding presence, no doubt
handed down to him by a long line of distinguished ancestors.
His face was set and stern and his fierce old eyes looked out
upon the world under heavy, bushy brows. Living very much within
himself and a stranger to everyone, even to members of his own
family, he seldom smiled and then only in a cold sarcastic
way.</p>

<p>Altogether he looked a man with whom, despite his years, it
would be unwise to attempt to play any tricks, and who would
take command and exact obedience wherever he was. In not too
good health, he was a great sufferer from neuritis and that at
times made him intensely irritable and difficult to get on
with.</p>

<p>The possessor of a large estate of many thousands of acres,
the after-war taxation had naturally made great inroads into his
income. Still, for all that, with everyone of the opinion he
must be drawing largely upon his capital, he lived in much the
same spacious way his forebears had done, with the pomp and
ceremony of the castle being little different from that of the
generations before him. A just but hard master, he ruled his
dependants and numerous employees with the proverbial rod of
iron. He was a widower, with two daughters but no male heir and,
upon his death, the barony would pass to a nephew, the son of an
only brother, long since passed away.</p>

<p>With all the many people surrounding him, and yet living the
solitary and lonely life he did, his sole source of happiness
was apparently the collection of valuable art treasures, to
which he was continually adding. What little was known outside
the castle of his old silver was the envy of other
connoisseurs.</p>

<p>Such then was the man into whose presence now came tripping
the pretty and lively Miss Penelope Smith. Of medium height, she
had a good figure, very nice blue eyes, a perfect colouring,
good profile, a determined little chin and a decidedly pretty
mouth. Her nose was slightly retrousee but that in no way
lessened the general attractiveness of her appearance. She
looked a charming and very confident young woman.</p>

<p>His lordship had risen to his feet upon her entrance and,
apparently in no way awed by his grim appearance, she approached
him smilingly and held out her hand. With just the slightest
hesitation he took it limply and motioned her to a chair.</p>

<p>"I am pleased to meet you, Lord Delamarne," she said in a
cultured voice. "I saw your advertisement for a secretary in
yesterday's <i>Times</i> and thought&mdash;" but on the instant
his lordship glared angrily and he interrupted with great
sterness, "But it expressly stated, did it not, that any
applications for the position were to be made in writing to my
agent, Mr. Henderson, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Miss Smith now interrupted in her turn. "But I thought,
my lord," she said boldly, "that in my case that stipulation
could be waived, as you were once a great friend of my parents
and, before my mother died about six months ago, she told me a
lot about you. She was a Mrs. Whitsun Smith and her Christian
name was Angelica."</p>

<p>The expression upon his lordship's face changed abruptly from
one of anger to one of some surprise, and he regarded her very
curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the girl, "my father was a great friend of
yours and my mother said that many years ago he saved your
life."</p>

<p>So long a silence now followed that Miss Smith's face flushed
and she seemed all suddenly to have lost some of her confidence.
Evidently his lordship was not too pleased with what she had
said, she thought, and he was going to deny all obligation to
her dead father. However, she was mistaken there, as Lord
Delamarne spoke at last.</p>

<p>"That is so, Miss Smith," he said, "and I have never
forgotten it. It was in a village in the Punjab and he nursed me
through an attack of bubonic plague. At a great risk to his own
life he stayed with me when all the others had run away. He was
a brave man and I had a great respect for him." He frowned. "But
he has been dead now for a good many years, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Fourteen," nodded the girl. "I was only nine and remember
very little about him. We ought to have been left well off as at
the time of his death he was part owner of the Majestic Picture
Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, but my mother said we were
cheated out of everything. We got nothing, but happily were able
to live in comparative comfort because of an annuity father had
bought her in his earlier days."</p>

<p>His lordship raised his eyebrows. "And your mother died this
year?" he asked after a few moments.</p>

<p>"Yes, in January, from pneumonia, after only a week's
illness."</p>

<p>"And have you any brothers and sisters?"</p>

<p>"No, none. I was the only child."</p>

<p>"And what is your occupation?"</p>

<p>The girl smiled. "I am afraid I have been something of a
rolling stone, trying several. To begin with, I started training
to become a hospital nurse, but for the past six months I have
been in the orchestra of the Rialto as accompanist. I am a good
pianist and can always earn my five or six guineas a week. For
the moment I am on holiday."</p>

<p>His lordship frowned. "But proficiency at the piano is hardly
the right training for the secretarial work such as I
require."</p>

<p>The girl laughed. "Oh, but I was a journalist for four years
before that and am quite capable at office work. When I saw your
advertisement in <i>The Times</i> this morning and noticed the
name it struck me at once that I would apply for the post." She
looked amused. "The main reason, I think, because I wanted to
learn at first hand how you important people carry on in these
hard times.'</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded his lordship sharply, "by
wanting to learn at first hand, as you put it?"</p>

<p>"By seeing for myself with my own eyes," she replied. She
shrugged her shoulders. "Heaven knows, I've had plenty of
opportunity of learning through other people's, as I was for
more than two years one of the social editresses of <i>The Old
Society World.</i>" She laughed. "Why, I've many times put in
little paragraphs about your parties here. They were always good
copy."</p>

<p>"Oh, they were, were they," he frowned. "Then may I ask who
provided you with the information?"</p>

<p>"As often as not some of those who were going to be among
your guests," she replied. "Naturally, they were proud to be
invited and wanted their friends to know."</p>

<p>"So they wrote to your journal themselves, did they?"
commented his lordship. He scowled. "I'd very much like to know
who they were?"</p>

<p>Miss Smith shook her head. "Ah, but that I musn't tell you.
Journals never give away the names of any of their
correspondents through whom they get their news. Servants in the
big houses, too, often wrote to tell us what they thought was
interesting and earned a little money that way, a few shillings,
but if we considered the information worth it perhaps a postal
order for a pound."</p>

<p>"Disgraceful," commented his lordship, "your encouraging the
tittle-tattle of the back stairs. And can you remember the names
of any of the servants here who have approached you at any
time?"</p>

<p>"I might if I tried," she laughed, "but as I say, it wouldn't
be right for me to pass them on."</p>

<p>"Not if I made you a little present for doing so," he went on
sharply, "of, say, five or ten pounds?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," she replied with her face flushing again. "I
am always loyal to those who have trusted me and I wouldn't sell
my conscience for a paltry ten pounds."</p>

<p>"Not enough?" queried his lordship sarcastically. "Then what
about if I offered you more, say twenty pounds this time?"</p>

<p>She spoke very sharply. "Please say no more about it, Lord
Delamarne. I am not a girl who can be ever bought or sold." She
laughed. "I think too much of myself for that." She went on
quickly to stop any further persistence on his part. "I liked my
work at the Rialto much better. I found it so interesting to
watch the Society people who came in there to lunch and dine."
She spoke earnestly. "Don't you think now you could give me a
trial? My mother said you and my father were such great friends.
You went everywhere together."</p>

<p>"That is so. We did," agreed his lordship, and after a few
moments pause he added with a grim smile. "You see, young lady,
your father was my valet."</p>

<p>"Your valet!" exclaimed the girl, as if unable to believe her
ears. "Your servant, you mean?"</p>

<p>His lordship nodded. "Yes, my body servant, and the best I
ever had. I was very sorry to part with him, but in the end I
had to because his habits had become such intemperate ones that
as often as not he was in no condition to carry out his
duties."</p>

<p>Miss Smith was aghast. Her face had lost a lot of its pretty
colour and she looked as if she was going to cry. "B-u-t, but,"
she stammered, "my mother told me he might be of noble birth.
His real name was not Smith. There was a mystery as to who his
parents were."</p>

<p>"Quite so," agreed his lordship. "He never knew them, as he
was left one night upon the doorstep of the Foundling Hospital.
It was on a Whitsunday, and that is why they gave him the name
of Whitsun Smith."</p>

<p>For a few moments the girl could not speak in her emotion.
She took out a dainty little lace handkerchief and dabbed her
eyes. "But&mdash;I tell you he was a wealthy man. He was the
part-proprietor of that great picture palace."</p>

<p>"He was the commissionaire there," said his lordship with his
grim smile again, "the man who stood at the entrance and
whistled up the taxis. Another thing&mdash;and I think it right
you should be told&mdash;it was I who bought that annuity for
your mother. When your father and I parted, I dared not trust
him with a penny and so, instead, saw to it that his wife should
never want."</p>

<p>Miss Smith made no pretence that she was not humiliated and
gave way to her tears. "Then I am only an ordinary girl," she
choked, "and I came here thinking I might be the equal of
anybody and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you may be," interrupted his lordship and now, his
cynical manner for the moment disappearing, he spoke quite
kindly. "Your father may easily have been the offspring even of
a duke or an earl. He was very handsome and certainly no common
man." He smiled. "You, too, are anything but ordinary. You look
a well-bred as well at an attractive girl."</p>

<p>Miss Smith smiled through her tears, and proceeded to dry her
eyes. "Thank you for your compliment, my lord," she said. She
rose to her feet. "I won't trouble you any further."</p>

<p>"No, no," ordered his lordship sharply, "you just sit down
again. I'm interested in you and if I don't take you as my
secretary, remembering your father's service I may be able to
help you in some other way. I like spirit in a woman and I see
you've got plenty." He regarded her with grim intent purpose.
"But tell me what exactly was your idea in coming this long
journey from London to see me to-day."</p>

<p>She seemed surprised at the question. "In the expectation, of
course, that probably being the first applicant for the post you
would appoint me as the secretary."</p>

<p>"Not in the expectation, I am sure, Miss Smith," he said
dryly, "and hardly, I think, in the hope."</p>

<p>"Then what do you imagine I came for," she asked, bridling up
a little in annoyance at the stern way in which he was regarding
her, "to steal some of your art treasures?"</p>

<p>"But you are a butterfly, Miss Smith," he said, ignoring her
question, "and secretarial work would be dull and uncongenial
work for a girl such as you, accustomed to all kinds of
excitement."</p>

<p>She flared up instantly. "I am not a butterfly, my lord. I've
had far too many hard knocks in my life to be anything as weak
as that." She looked amused. "If you must know&mdash;and I'll be
quite frank about it&mdash;I'm a hard-boiled, calculating
adventuress and I had hoped to get the situation here to better
my prospects in life. Believing I might perhaps be of
aristocratic birth myself"&mdash;her voice quavered&mdash;"until
you woke me from my beautiful daydream there&mdash;I was
thinking I should meet some nice people here and perhaps make a
good match." She spoke defiantly. "Now you have the whole truth,
and I'm not ashamed of it. I'm a very ordinary person, except
for such few good looks as I happen to possess."</p>

<p>His lordship's grim face had broken into a dry smile. "But,
as I have already said, you are anything but an ordinary person,
Miss Smith. Indeed, I should say that you are unusually
intelligent. It was a brainy idea of yours, too, so to speak, to
force yourself upon me by sending away your taxi so that I
should have to offer you some hospitality."</p>

<p>She was quite herself again and commented pertly, "And so now
I suppose it'll be a cup of tea in the housekeeper's room and
then you'll very considerately have me driven back to the
station, saying goodbye with the promise that you'll think over
what you can do for me and let me know."</p>

<p>His lordship shook his head. "No, as you have reminded me,
your father was my friend as well as my servant, and so I shall
do more than that cup of tea and the lift back to the station."
He inclined his head with old-world courtesy. "I shall be very
happy to have you here, as my guest, at any rate for a week or
two."</p>

<p>She shook her head in turn. "Thank you kindly, my lord, but I
think I'd rather not. It would be quite all right my meeting
your family in the belief that I might perhaps be their social
equal; but very different from my meeting them and their knowing
that my father had been your servant."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," frowned his lordship, "but no one is going to
tell them that. I shall say he was a friend of mine in India and
once saved my life. No one is to know upon what footing our
relations were. You can give out that he was in the Indian Civil
Service&mdash;a magistrate, you'd better say. It will be easy
enough to deceive my younger daughter, Joan, as unhappily she is
not too intelligent, but with my other daughter, Vera, you'll
have to be more careful, as she is sharp and has all her wits
about her. However, she is away on a visit at the present
moment. One other thing&mdash;mention only that you are a
journalist. Leave out that you work in the orchestra at that
restaurant."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's very kind of you," began Penelope hesitantly,
"but I think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not for you to think at all," said his lordship
sharply. "I give the orders here. Then that's settled. You'll
stay," and with Penelope sinking back into her chair again he
touched a bell on his desk and, upon the butler re-appearing,
ordered, "Tell Miss Joan I want her, please."</p>

<p>There was silence in the room, with them both busy with their
thoughts until the daughter appeared. A little younger than
Penelope, she certainly did not appear to be very clever. She
had a round childlike face and big, innocent blue eyes. Lord
Delamarne introduced them, describing Penelope as the daughter
of an old friend whom he had known many years back in India.</p>

<p>"And she is going to stay with us for a little while," he
explained. "So we must do our best to make her comfortable. You
had better put her in the west wing."</p>

<p>So Penelope was led away by the smiling, friendly Joan to the
room in the west wing, which she was given to understand was
generally reserved for relations of the family. Her suitcase was
brought up by a smartly-uniformed maid and she was left with the
intimation that afternoon tea would be served in the lounge in a
few moments.</p>

<p>Left by herself again, Penelope was inclined to give way to a
little weep. "Fancy mother deceiving me like that!" she choked.
"What a fool it made me look to the old man! Still, he was
really very kind about it, and is evidently grateful for what
father did for him."</p>

<p>She took in the beautifully-appointed room and her spirits
rose. Here was every luxury she could think of&mdash;the rich
carpet, the expensive-looking maplewood furniture, lights to be
switched on wherever one wanted them, two big comfortable
armchairs, the bed with its satin-covered eiderdown, and the
charming little bathroom with all its shining accompaniments
leading out of the heavily-curtained alcove.</p>

<p>She regarded herself critically in the big mirror round the
dressing-table and felt even more comforted still. "Yes,
Penelope, you're certainly not bad looking, and who knows what
may happen to you. You may perhaps after all meet some really
eligible young man who may take a fancy to you. For one thing,
I'm quite sure that the old lord will never give you away.
Instead, it might please his cynical humour to think some great
and important family was taking into its bosom the daughter of
his one-time valet. He'd get a lot of pleasure out of it."</p>

<p>She made a grimace here. "And so my father was a valet, and I
know my dear mother was a girl who once served in a shop! So
probably she was only just an ordinary girl behind the counter
there when father met her." She sighed again. "Anyhow, I'm sure
she must have been pretty enough then for any man to have taken
to her."</p>

<p>She frowned. "But I must be very careful what I do here not
to give myself away. Thank goodness I know how the rich people
behave at table and what they eat and drink, and shan't be
making any mistakes there. Also, I shan't be shy or awkward with
anyone I meet. My journalistic work has been a splendid training
for me."</p>

<p>With all her self-assurance, however, her heart beat a little
quicker when a few hours later she took her seat at the long
table in the big dining-room for dinner. Though there were only
his lordship and Joan beside her, they were waited on in solemn
pomp by the butler and a footman in the Delamarne livery. Still,
she soon brightened up under the thrill of her surroundings, the
soft lights of the candles on the table, the sparkling glassware
and the exquisite napery.</p>

<p>So well aware she was well groomed and accustomed, as she had
comforted herself, to the table ways of the distinguished
patrons of the Rialto was soon completely at her ease, and Lord
Delamarne, watching her covertly, wondered with some grim
amusement what his other daughter, the Honourable Mrs. Riverton,
would say when she returned from her visit and found this very
prepossessing young woman installed <i>en famille</i> at the
castle.</p>

<p>Apparently the meal was generally eaten in silence, and but
for Penelope things would probably have been the same now.
However, after a glass of unaccustomed champagne, she livened up
a lot and by her naive remarks on several occasions drew from
his lordship an unaccustomed smile. Discussing some of the many
distinguished people she had seen coming into the Rialto, though
as her host had suggested she did not mention where she had
encountered them, much of what she said was witty and amusing.
Indeed, though she was never to learn it, she was the cause of a
lot of interest in the servants' hall that night, with both the
butler and the footman who had been the one to wait on them at
dinner admitting to other members of the castle staff that they
were unable to quite size up the new arrival.</p>

<p>"Though she's only a plain Miss Smith, cook," remarked the
butler as they were all partaking of their cold beef and pickles
for supper, "she has evidently mixed with the very best people,
and the way she described old Lord Morphett as the best Punch
she had seen out of a Punch-and-Judy Show was too funny for
words. Then when she went on to say that that nasty old Dowager
Lady Caston always perked her old head round like an old rooster
just about to give a good crow, even his lordship smiled! Yes, I
tell you she's a lively young woman, as lively as they make
them, and I wonder from where old Del picked her up."</p>

<p>The footman added his quota to the way the new secretary had
enlivened the meal. "And, by cripes, cook, she almost made his
lordship laugh outright once. She had said she once heard the
Archbishop of Canterbury preach, and Miss Joan asked what his
sermon had been about. 'Sin,' she replied. 'And what did he say
about it?' asked old Del with that nasty sarcastic smile of his.
Miss Smith was as solemn as an owl. 'Oh, he didn't approve of
it,' she said, and I say the old boy almost laughed."</p>

<p>The ensuing few days were very happy ones for Penelope. She
was thrilled with the comfort and luxury of everything and the
beautiful surroundings both inside and outside the castle. Of
Lord Delamarne she saw practically nothing except at meal times
and then he spoke little to her. She noticed, however, that he
was often regarding her intently, for all the world, she
thought, as if he were summing her up and unable yet to make up
his mind about something.</p>

<p>With Joan she had speedily become upon excellent terms and,
being of a very simple disposition and apparently never able to
keep anything to herself, the girl was soon confiding many
private things to her. She said her father was very odd in many
ways and except, when they had visitors, did not take notice of
anyone. He loved to have the castle full of people, but it was
really too much for him as he was failing in health, his blood
pressure was unduly high, and from time to time he suffered so
much from attacks of neuritis in one of his knees that then he
could hardly drag himself along.</p>

<p>"Poor old man," exclaimed Penelope in real sympathy, "he
hasn't much to live for at seventy-five, has he?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he has," retorted Joan at once. "He's wrapped up in
his art treasures, particularly the old silver he's been
collecting for many years. No one but himself knows how much of
it he's got hidden below in the vaults. He's had a room fitted
up there with electric lights and a radiator, and some days he
spends hours and hours there, we think, gloating over his
treasures."</p>

<p>"And that's all his happiness in life!" exclaimed
Penelope.</p>

<p>"But it isn't all happiness by any means," said Joan, "as
he's always living in fear of being robbed." She lowered her
voice darkly. "And would you believe it, Penelope, neither my
sister nor I, or anyone else in the castle, has ever been
allowed to go down below. Even exactly where the door leading on
to the stairway is has been a secret from us. All we know is
that it's somewhere in his study."</p>

<p>Penelope looked incredulous. "But surely the servants who do
the room must know?"</p>

<p>Joan laughed. "No, they don't. Only Anna, she's the head
housemaid and has been here nearly thirty years, and we two
girls are allowed there. We do all the dusting and sweeping and
the door is always kept shut. Father locks it at night or
whenever he goes out of the castle. As he's grown old he's got
worse and worse, until secrecy is a perfect mania with him."</p>

<p>"But doesn't everyone think it's strange?" asked
Penelope.</p>

<p>"Outsiders do," said Joan, "and no wonder stories got about
of tremendous treasures being hidden down below. Of course, all
of us here are accustomed to it and never take any notice, just
looking upon it all as another of father's eccentricities." She
looked troubled. "You know, we live in lots of secrets and
mysteries here. About three months ago one of the footmen
disappeared, and no one has any idea what happened to him. One
night he just went up to his bedroom as usual and in the morning
couldn't be found anywhere. He had not slept in his bed and he
had left all his things behind him. He had just vanished as if
he had been spirited away."</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary thing," exclaimed Penelope. "But
didn't his people come enquiring after him?"</p>

<p>Joan shook her head. "Apparently he hadn't any, as no one
came asking for him. He had been with us only a few weeks and we
knew practically nothing about him. Father was very glum about
it and, though he never mentioned it to us, we believe the
references the man had brought with him when he was engaged were
forged ones. So we know father must think his getting taken on
here was part of a plan to rob him and he's been more nervy
since."</p>

<p>"But what did the police do?" asked Penelope.</p>

<p>"Nothing! Of course, they were told about it, but there the
matter ended. The only explanation anyone can think of is that
he must have slipped out of the castle that night to have a swim
in the sea&mdash;the sea is only about two miles from
here&mdash;and got drowned. Still, his body was never
found."</p>

<p>Then she went on to tell Penelope, without any reserve, of a
secret love affair she was having with a young fellow whose
father kept a provision shop in Norwich. It was the shop at
which the castle dealt and that was how she had come to know
him.</p>

<p>"He's such a dear boy," she said, "but father would be
furious if he knew. Sometimes I meet him at night in the
grounds, as it's the only place where we can talk to each
other."</p>

<p>"But what about your cousin, young Mr. Chester Avon, who'll
be the next Lord Delamarne?" asked Penelope. "I should have
thought it would have been a good thing for the barony if you
had married <i>him.</i>"</p>

<p>"Father did think of it once," she said, "but then decided it
would never do. He is very disappointed in Chester and says he
couldn't have two such weak characters as him and me to carry on
the line." She laughed shyly. "You see, Chester is something
like me in disposition. He lets people make up his mind for him
and gives in to them much too easily. Father says he's got no
more backbone in him than a piece of jelly."</p>

<p>Penelope was very amused. "But if your father had decided you
two should be married, would you both have agreed to it?"</p>

<p>Joan shrugged her shoulders. "I suppose we should have had
to, as father always seems to get his own way." She spoke
warmly. "But don't you start imagining my cousin is anything of
a fool. He certainly is not, and it's only because he depends so
much upon father that he always seems frightened of him. You
see, he has only got his pay as a lieutenant in the Regular
Army, and father allows him £300 a year. Besides, though the
Blackarden estate is entailed, father has so much to leave
besides that it would make a lot of difference to Chester if he
kept him out of it all."</p>

<p>"Is he engaged?" asked Penelope.</p>

<p>Joan laughed. "No, and he wouldn't dare to be unless father
had approved of the girl first. It seems rather humiliating,
doesn't it? But then Chester is very good tempered and takes it
all in a good-humoured way." She continued, "He has a great
friend, too, in a Major Mangan, whom he says laughingly won't
let him get too friendly with any of the girls who are setting
their caps at him, and goodness only knows how many of them
there are."</p>

<p>"I'd like to meet him," smiled Penelope. "I might set my cap
at him, too."</p>

<p>"But he'll be difficult to catch," smiled back Joan, "as he's
always rather shy with strange girls. However, you'll soon get
the opportunity to see what you can do, as he's coming down this
week-end. His regiment is stationed at Aldershot, but for the
time being he's doing some temporary work at the War Office in
Town and manages to get plenty of leave."</p>

<p>Penelope duly absorbed all this information about young Avon
and wondered if he <i>would</i> do for her, or, rather, she for
him. Evidently it was going to be Lord Delamarne who would
decide whom the boy should marry and it struck her again there
was no knowing what the old lord's cynical ideas of life
generally might suggest to him. It might appeal to his cynical
outlook on life generally to marry his one-time valet's daughter
to the heir of the great Delamarne line.</p>

<p>Upon the fourth day following on her arrival at the castle
and when Joan was busy on household duties, Lord Delamarne came
out to Penelope, who was sitting alone on the terrace, and asked
her to come into his study as he wanted to have a talk with
her.</p>

<p>Penelope's knees shook under her. So he had made up his mind
as to whether or not he would engage her! It looked hopeful, as
his manner was quite pleasant. Reaching the study and closing
the door behind her, he motioned to a chair before the big desk
and seated himself opposite her.</p>

<p>"By the bye," he began with a frown, "of course Joan has told
you she has been meeting that young fellow in the grounds here
at night?"</p>

<p>Most embarrassed at the question, Penelope put on a blank
look and asked innocently, "Which young fellow? What do you
mean, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be evasive," he said testily. "Of course you know
all about it, as unhappily Joan is one of those foolish girls
who can never keep any secrets to herself. I mean the boy from
the provision shop in Norwich," and, waiting for no comment from
Penelope, he went on grimly, "But I suppose that is another of
your loyalties; all right in its way but not necessary in this
case as I have learnt about everything. Well, you tell her from
me that it must stop. If it doesn't, say I shall withdraw my
custom from his father without any explanation and that will
cause no little unpleasantness as well as pecuniary loss to him.
I am not telling her myself because I don't want to get into a
temper. It's not good for my health. You understand?"</p>

<p>Penelope nodded and he said frowningly, "Well, I have made up
my mind to engage you and your salary will be six guineas a
week." He spoke with an effort. "I realise that is more than
just the ordinary secretary I need now. I require someone whom I
can trust implicitly and to whom I can confide very private
matters with no fear of their being passed on to anybody." He
spoke sharply. "I think you are the right one there."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much for your good opinion of me, my lord,"
said Penelope warmly. "You won't be disappointed in me, I
promise you."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall," he said and he smiled his cold grim
smile, "because I happen to know your pedigree. Your father was
a man who, except for his one failing, would be as they put it,
faithful unto death, and for your mother I had always the
greatest respect in that way, too."</p>

<p>He frowned again. "Of course, Joan has told you about what
people call my eccentricities&mdash;that I have secrets to hide
and spend a lot of time in the underground parts of this castle.
Also that I have kept from everyone the way down to them from
this room. All this is quite true, but I have a perfect right,
if I choose, to keep my private affairs to myself. They are
nobody else's business." He looked troubled. "My anxiety now is
that on one of these expeditions below, in my present ill health
I may be suddenly taken ill, with no one being able to help me,
and that is where I expect you to come in." He rose to his feet.
"Now take good notice of what I am going to show you."</p>

<p>He pulled open a bottom drawer on one side of his desk and,
lifting out some papers, showed her a small catch on the back.
"Now this desk is clamped to the floor and when I pull that
catch back it releases a spring behind that oak panel in the
wall. Please take good notice that the panel is the seventh one
from where the shelves of books begin. Now you go over and slide
that panel back. Press hard first and then it will slip back
behind panel number eight."</p>

<p>Thrilled in intense interest, Penelope did as she had been
told and a door, covered over with thick felt, was exposed to
view. Lord Delamarne explained that the felt had been placed
there so that any tapping upon the wall should not give out any
hollow sound. The door opened into a little narrow chamber about
six feet in length, at the end of which there was another door.
His lordship flashed a big electric torch.</p>

<p>"This chamber and the second door," he explained, "was
arranged so that no draught should come up from below."</p>

<p>The second door opened and he flashed his torch upon a flight
of narrow steps leading down to inky blackness below. "Seventy-two
of them," he said, "but they're not steep and quite safe.
Follow me."</p>

<p>The stairway seemed almost endless to Penelope, but at last
they reached the bottom, and reaching up his arm Lord Delamarne
switched on a light and Penelope gave a long "O-o-h!" as she saw
a long and wide corridor, paved with huge stone flags,
stretching before her until it reached the darkness in the
distance. On either side were a number of gaping doorways with
their massive wooden doors lying prone upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Are those the vaults in there?" she asked breathlessly, and
though she spoke hardly above a whisper her voice echoed along
the corridor.</p>

<p>"No, those are the dungeons," he replied. "In the course of
the centuries the doors have fallen down because the ironwork of
the hinges and fastenings have rotted away. The vaults are
farther on."</p>

<p>"But how is it the air is so clear?" asked Penelope. "It's
not a bit close or musty as I thought it would have been."</p>

<p>"That's because it's always circulating," he said. "It's
drawn in through a deep well among the vaults and from openings
high up in the chimneys in the castle above."</p>

<p>He led Penelope up the long corridor to a small dungeon round
the corner at the far end of the corridor and, opening a small
door, showed her a little chamber that had been fitted up to
house the most valuable of his silver collection. There were
glass cabinets all round the walls, a big comfortable armchair,
a couch and a good-sized radiator.</p>

<p>"And this is where you'll find me," he said with a sad smile,
"if ever I'm missing for too long. You shall have a duplicate
key to the library door to get in whenever you want to." He eyed
her intently. "You won't be afraid to come, will you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," she replied. She laughed. "Though I expect
there are plenty of ghosts gliding about down here."</p>

<p>"There should be if such things as ghosts exist," he said
casually, "as in the cruel and torturing days of the Dark Ages
many a poor wretch drew in his last breath here. Some of the
lords of Blackarden of those times had not too good a reputation
for kindness."</p>

<p>After giving Penelope a quick look round down some of the
many passages leading out of the main corridor, Lord Delamarne
led her up into his study again and made her manipulate the
sliding panel many times to make certain she understood how to
work it properly. "But do you really think, Lord Delamarne," she
asked hesitatingly, "that all these precautions are
necessary?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do," he answered solemnly. "There are many
articles of great value below and I have good reason to believe
that of late I have been watched. I am not an easily frightened
man, Miss Smith, but I think it wise now to carry an automatic
pistol always about with me," and he took one from his hip
pocket and showed it to her. Then seeing the troubled expression
on her face he added, "So you see in what a position of trust I
am placing you."</p>

<p>"But I'm not really at all frightened," she said. "It's an
adventure"&mdash;she laughed&mdash;"and didn't I tell you I was
adventurous?"</p>

<p>"Good," he commented, "and I am certain I can depend upon
you." He smiled quite pleasantly. "I admit it's something of a
relief to me to realise that I have someone near me who can help
if I need help."</p>

<p>Penelope was glad her position in the castle had been settled
before the other daughter, Vera, the Honourable Mrs. Riverton,
returned home. The latter had been married only a few months to
a well-to-do landowner whose hobby was the breeding of stud
cattle. Their house was about five miles from the castle, but
Penelope had been given to understand that she would see plenty
of both of them.</p>

<p>From the very first Vera was prepared to be quite friendly,
but she was naturally very curious about her father having taken
a girl for his secretary and put a lot of rather searching
questions to Penelope. Still, the latter was every bit as shrewd
as she was and, with all her answers ready for any questions
that might be put, was sure she did not let slip anything she
should not have done.</p>

<p>Penelope's next excitement was the arrival for a few days'
stay of the heir to the barony. She liked him at once, and
thought him a bright and happy young fellow whose great fault
was that he was inclined to take life much too easily. He took a
good eyeful of her when they were introduced and remarked
smilingly that it was quite nice to see a new face at the castle
and such a pretty one, too.</p>

<p>"Now you stop that, Chester," said Joan in mock reproach.
"Miss Smith is quite a staid and proper young person and allows
only father to pay her compliments like that. Isn't that so,
Penelope?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is," laughed Penelope. "As I've told you, I'm a
bit of a man-hater and have no time for any of them until
they're well over forty."</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to be an old man's darling, do you, Miss
Smith?" asked young Avon. He pretended to look pleased. "Well,
with all my worries I'm ageing quickly and so shall soon be
eligible," and he gave Penelope a wink which he intended should
be a very knowing one.</p>

<p>But if Chester Avon were talkative and merry when alone with
the two girls, he was very different when in the presence of his
uncle, subsiding then into a very quiet and subdued young man.
It was evident he stood in considerable awe of the lord of the
castle, and the latter did not make things any better by
continually frowning at him.</p>

<p>"Now you are here," said Lord Delamarne to him at lunch, "you
may as well try to do something useful for once. You're to give
Miss Smith a lesson or two in driving my car," and he gave the
order in such a stern, cold way that it might have been thought
he was imposing some unpleasant duty upon his nephew.</p>

<p>Penelope herself was delighted with the idea, as always of a
hopeful and sanguine disposition, her daydreams had strengthened
that there were great possibilities of conquest in young Avon if
only she was tactful and played her cards carefully.</p>

<p>Actually brought now in contact with him, following upon all
Joan had told her she was confident she had summed him up pretty
accurately. A flirt in a timid and very cautious way, he could
never have had a real sweetheart, let alone have been the lover
of any girl! He was all virgin ground, just waiting for some
enterprising and tactful young female to implant the deeper
feelings in him!</p>

<p>However, with any conquest in contemplation, she knew quite
well that he was not the only one to be considered and that
there would be no chance of ultimate success except with the
approval of Lord Delamarne himself. With the old lord's strong
and masterful disposition, she was sure whom the heir would take
for his wife would be decided by him, rather than by young Avon,
who would most certainly do as he was told there.</p>

<p>Still, she was not without hope that eventually his lordship
might come to approve of her as being quite suitable to be his
nephew's wife. Already the old man had honoured her with a
confidence he had certainly given to no one else, and it might
be that in time she would become so indispensable to him that
any liking Chester took for her would be pleasing, rather than
otherwise, to him.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the first thing was to make the boy himself become
attached to her and, with him now showing an obvious willingness
to open a flirtation with her, she decided to give him plenty of
encouragement. However, at the same time she would take good
care to pretend to him that it was going to be a flirtation and
nothing more. She would appear to be so frank and open about
that that he would not think he need put up any defence against
her or have to be in any way upon his guard.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;she thought her chance would come, as she would
try to make the flirtation so delightful to him that, quite
unknowingly in the end he would have plunged so deep that he
would have no wish to draw back.</p>

<p>She sighed here when she summed it all up. But what a little
fool she was! What chance had she, a mere employee in the
castle, when almost certainly everyone there would be against
her? The boy himself might indeed become fond of her without
realising that all the time she had been purposely leading him
on, but onlookers would have noticed it at once, and wouldn't
Vera, for one, have started warning him against her. Vera was
always very much inclined to be a jealous little cat.</p>

<p>Penelope was smiling again now. Well, if nothing came of her
scheming at least she would see that she got some fun out of it.
After all, she had all to gain and nothing to lose. It would be
like acting a part in a play.</p>

<p>Then if indeed her manoeuvres were intended to be something
of the nature of a play she certainly acted very well in it. The
boy was allowed plenty of squeezes of her hand and got
unmistakeable squeezes back in return. When, too, they were in
the company of others, many sly and almost verging on ardent
glances passed between them, laughing and yet provocative on her
part and on his showing the undoubted pleasure he was feeling at
the little intimacies which, unknown to everybody else, were
making everything so interesting for both of them.</p>

<p>However, when upon the conclusion of the last driving lesson
he suggested a kiss as a reward for his services, she declined
with a pretty shake of her head.</p>

<p>"Not quite so soon, Boy!" she exclaimed reproachfully. "Why,
I've known you for such a little time."</p>

<p>"Just one," he pleaded, "a very quick one."</p>

<p>"No, no," she whispered, "you can't have one now. Don't you
see Vera has got her eyes upon us and keeps looking this way. So
wait for a better time."</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "But you promise, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll keep one for you," she laughed. She flashed him
one of her provocative glances. "Don't you think a kiss can be
made so nice that it's a pity to take it too hurriedly?" and
young Avon thought the denial of the kiss had been made so
sweetly that it perhaps might have been almost as good as the
kiss itself.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the day upon which Avon had gone back to
Town, Lord Delamarne remarked casually to Penelope when they
were together in the study, "And pray what do you think of this
precious nephew of mine, Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>"He's a very nice boy," replied Penelope in an equally casual
tone, "but he's only a boy and hasn't half grown up yet."</p>

<p>"Well, he's taking a long while about it," grunted his
lordship, "and I don't think he'll ever be a proper man. He's a
young fool and can't say boo to a goose."</p>

<p>"But he's anything but a fool," returned Penelope instantly,
"and if he doesn't talk much in front of you it's only because
you frighten him so. You are frowning at him all the time."</p>

<p>"But he's no enterprise," said his lordship. "He never shows
the least bit of go like other young fellows of his age."</p>

<p>"Oh, doesn't he?" commented Penelope with a laugh. "Well, he
squeezed my hand hard enough when we were first being introduced
and didn't seem at all backward then."</p>

<p>Rather to everyone's surprise, the boy appeared at the castle
again on the following Saturday. He explained that his chief was
away and thought, as he had nothing in particular to do, he
might just as well come down and give Penelope another driving
lesson or two.</p>

<p>Penelope was really delighted about it. At any rate, she told
herself, she was not losing ground. She was the more heartened
there because she was sure she could sense some different
attitude of the boy towards her this time. He was quieter, even
a little shy, and if he talked less to her she thought he
nevertheless looked at her a good deal more.</p>

<p>"Good," she told herself with a little thrill, "he's
interested in me now in a different sort of way to what he was
on our first meeting. He's more respectful and nothing like as
bold as he was last time."</p>

<p>She was very nice to him and even ventured to give him some
advice. "Talk more to your uncle," she said, "and let him see
you've got a mind of your own. Bring up the Baltic question to
him and say they all seem only half-civilised to you. That'll
please him a lot, as no one could hate them more than he
does."</p>

<p>So to Lord Delamarne's astonishment that night at dinner Avon
brought up world affairs and, in the short conversation that
ensued, listened most deferentially to his uncle's views.</p>

<p>"You did splendidly, Mr. Avon," said Penelope afterwards.
"Now before you come down next time read up some political news
and ask for your uncle's opinion again. Make him realise that
you're interested in other things besides sport. He's got a
silly idea that you are never interested in serious
matters."</p>

<p>On the Monday morning, in bidding the boy good-bye when they
were in the conservatory together, she thanked him gratefully
for the driving lessons he had given her. He coloured up and for
a few moments they stood looking at each other without
speaking.</p>

<p>"You're a nice boy," said Penelope gently and then, in the
most natural way possible, she lifted up her face and gave him a
quick kiss.</p>

<p>"Whew, that was nice," he said a little hoarsely. "I'd like a
few more, please," but she put a finger on her lips and led the
way smilingly out of the conservatory.</p>

<p>That night Lord Delamarne brought up his nephew again to
Penelope. "Had a good time with him?" he asked grimly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's been very nice," she nodded.</p>

<p>"Did you attempt any flirtation with him?" asked his
lordship, looking at her very hard.</p>

<p>"I didn't get much chance there," laughed Penelope. "Vera saw
to that. She left us alone together as little as possible."</p>

<p>"But I suppose," went on his lordship dryly, "as the
adventuress you have told me you are, you've already got your
eyes on him as a possible husband?"</p>

<p>She shook her head smilingly. "Hardly," she said, "as I'm
years too old for him. When he marries it ought to be to a girl
several years younger than he, otherwise he'll never stick to
her. Now if I were his wife, in six months he'd be running round
after someone else. I know his kind." She laughed merrily.
"Besides, he'll never want to marry me, as he knows I'd order
him about too much." She shook her head agin. "No, Lord
Delamarne, you needn't ever think I'll set my cap there. I tell
you I'm not in the running," and his lordship dropped the
subject.</p>

<p>Now if Lord Delamarne were worried at the thought that
unknown enemies might be closing in upon him&mdash;his anxiety
was as nothing to that Larose should now be experiencing, for no
one could have realised better than he did that he had just been
in most deadly peril and, in all probability might soon be
facing that same peril again.</p>

<p>The previous evening he had been shot at twice by someone
firing at him with a rifle.</p>

<p>He had returned home to the abbey when it was beginning to
get dark and, having put his car in the garage, was just in the
very act of letting himself into the house in the full glare of
the hall lights shining through the open doorway when he heard
the whine of two bullets passing in quick succession close
beside him. From his life's training always on the alert, his
mind instantly registered an attempt to kill him and even as the
reports of a rifle reached him he was hurling himself
precipitately down into the hall.</p>

<p>Kicking the door to behind him, he sprang to his feet, pale
and with little beads of sweat beginning to burst upon his
forehead. Upon the opposite wall he saw where the two bullets
had crashed in, with the holes being only a few inches from each
other.</p>

<p>"Good shots!" he exclaimed hoarsely. "He was probably firing
from that hill."</p>

<p>Darting like lightning over to the phone, not to his great
surprise he found the line was dead. However, arguing that
whether or not the would-be assassin would be thinking his
bullets had hit their mark, he would now be speeding away from
the neighbourhood as quickly as possible, he judged it quite
safe to go outside again. So with all haste, taking out his car
once more, he proceeded at once to a neighbouring house and
within a very few minutes was on the phone and telling the
Norwich superintendent of police what had happened.</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Larose," said the superintendent, who had
instantly taken in the situation, "I'll have an immediate SOS
sent out all round. We'll block every road so that he can't get
away."</p>

<p>"And look out for a returned soldier," warned Larose. "He
must have been firing from the direction of the sea, due east
and probably from the plantation on Dunton Hill, as from there
he could look down straight into our drive and the front of the
house. From the time of the report of the rifle followed upon
the striking of the bullets, I reckon he must have been a good
eight hundred yards away."</p>

<p>Having done all that in the circumstances he thought he could
have done, he returned home, most thankful that it happened
while his family were away. The elder boys were at boarding
school and his wife with the younger children on a visit to
Town.</p>

<p>"So that's that," he told himself with a wry smile. "Our good
friend, Major Mangan, of course! He's a quick mover and has lost
little time." He shook his head. "So I shall never be safe now
until he's finished with." His face hardened. "I may have to
kill him myself."</p>

<p>As can well be imagined, it was some time before he dropped
off to sleep that night, and then when it was almost one o'clock
in the morning he was awakened from his uneasy-slumber by the
sounds of a car pulling up outside, and answering the door
himself he found it was the superintendent of police from
Norwich.</p>

<p>"You can rest easy, Mr. Larose," said the superintendent
smilingly, "as we're practically certain we've got the man."</p>

<p>"You've got him, you say?" exclaimed Larose delightedly.
"Splendid! Has he admitted anything?"</p>

<p>The superintendent shook his head solemnly. "He can't. He's
dead. He was on a motor-bicycle, and attempting to get away from
one of the King's Lynn patrol, ran head-on into a wall and was
killed instantly from a broken neck."</p>

<p>Larose looked disappointed. "Then all you have against him is
that he was trying to avoid the patrol? Had he got any rifle on
the machine?"</p>

<p>"No, no rifle," said the superintendent. "We shall probably
find that hidden in that wood." He nodded grimly. "But in one of
his pockets we found three cartridges of the kind used in the
new Service rifle, the Park-Riley. We shan't have the slightest
difficulty of finding out all about him as he was carrying a
driving licence made out for a Eric Rupert Haines, of an address
in Hammersmith. Evidently he had no expectation he would be
bailed up."</p>

<p>Larose looked more satisfied. "He must have been picked up
very quickly," he commented.</p>

<p>The superintendent smiled. "Barely twenty minutes after I
received your call. If he was quick&mdash;we were even quicker.
The King's Lynn police&mdash;I have just come from
them&mdash;had got the cordon working in their district in under
a quarter of an hour. If you are right about his firing at you
from that plantation on Dunton Hill, then in the following five
and twenty minutes he covered nearly twenty-six miles.
Undoubtedly he was reckoning that his speed would enable him to
slip up North, or perhaps into some big town in the Midlands
before the hue and cry had even been started in this county. I
guess he was banking on that cut telephone wire."</p>

<p>"Well, you've done splendid, superintendent," said Larose
warmly, he made a grimace, "that is, if you've got the right
man."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think we can be pretty certain of that," said the
superintendent. "His refusing to stop was damnably suspicious.
The King's Lynn chaps heard his motor-bike coming when it was
miles away and, knowing he would have to pass them, pulled up
their car at once and sent one of their uniformed men ahead to
give him plenty of warning to stop before he drew level with
them. He slowed down and it looked as if he were going to do so,
but then, when he was nearly up to the patrol car, which was
stationed bang in the middle of the road, he accelerated in a
flash and swerved sharply to slip by. He would have got by, too,
if his machine hadn't skidded and crashed into that wall."</p>

<p>"What kind of man was he?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Not a common one by any means; about thirty, I should say.
His hands were well kept and not accustomed to manual work.
Under his overalls all his clothing was of good quality. His
wrist watch was anything but a cheap one and in his pockets,
among other things, were a wallet with twelve pounds in treasury
notes and a silver cigarette case with the engraved initials
E.R.H. As I have said, it is evident he had no expectation of
being caught. We'll know all about him to-morrow."</p>

<p>Some thirty-six hours later Inspector Stone was telling
Larose the rest of the story. "Mangan's work again," he said
gloomily, "but as before not a shred of evidence against him.
This Eric Rupert Haines was in the commando raid on Dieppe and
we know Mangan was there, too, so it's no stretch of the
imagination that they were acquainted with each other. One
thing, it may be a small one but nevertheless it's significant,
the Egyptian cigarettes that we noted when we raided Mangan's
flat and those in this shooter's case were both of the same
expensive brand. How's that for a bit of circumstantial evidence
that they know each other?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good, Charlie," nodded Larose, "but unhappily we
can't bring Mangan in on that. Still, I am in absolute agreement
with you that he put this man on me to get his revenge."</p>

<p>"Still, my boy," smiled the inspector, "you'll have a bit of
a breather now before Mangan can dig up another assassin. The
exact ones he wants are surely not easy to be found." A thought
struck him and he asked sharply, "Now of course you know that
Lord Delamarne who lives not far from you?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Yes, I know him," he said, "very slightly,
however. We meet occasionally on the Bench. But why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>Stone spoke impressively. "Because in the course of our
enquiries about this blackguard, Mangan, we've learnt that he's
on most friendly terms with young Lieutenant Avon, his
lordship's nephew and the heir to the Blackarden estate."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh," exclaimed Larose, "that doesn't sound too good. I
should say a fellow such as Mangan makes friends with no one
unless he's going to get something out of him."</p>

<p>"What I think," agreed Stone, "is that old Delamarne ought to
be warned. Mangan and this boy are pretty thick together, with
young Avon often taking him visiting down to Blackarden Casde.
Do you know the old lord well enough to have a confidential talk
with him?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," replied Larose at once. "Delamarne is at all
times a proud and reserved old chap and has very fine friends. I
fancy he remembers I was a policeman once and consequently his
manner towards me is always cold and distant."</p>

<p>"Then you don't like to bring up Mangan to him?" asked
Stone.</p>

<p>Larose considered. "I'm not particularly keen, Charlie," and
then he added sharply, "But I'll have to do it. There's total
war now between Mangan and me and I'm not going to be
squeamish."</p>

<p>"But don't you forget you'll be treading on very delicate
ground," warned the inspector, "for remember there's a law of
libel, my boy, and if Mangan should go for you for
slander"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"well, as you
know, there isn't a single definite thing against him."</p>

<p>"I'm not forgotting that," said Larose, "but I'm certainly
not going to let that blackguard get off scot free. I'll have to
think over what I can do."</p>

<p>So back home that same evening Larose sat down and penned a
letter to the great lord of Blackarden Castle.</p>

<br>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Dear Lord Delamarne</span></i>,
he began,</p>

<p class="letter">I would like to have a chat with you on a
private and very important matter. Will you kindly arrange a
place of meeting somewhere, any day and time you like. It would
be better if I did not come to you or you to me, for no one must
learn I have approached you. If you write me, put the letter in
the post office yourself, and if you phone me here don't mention
my name, but asked for a Mr. Hill. I have no hesitation in
writing to you like this, for as I say the matter is a most
important one both to you and me, and when you have heard what I
have to say I am sure you will agree with me there.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Gilbert Larose</span>.</p>


<p><br>
Lord Delamarne received the letter the next morning and read
it through several times. Then for a long while he sat frowning
heavily.</p>

<p>Finally he went into the phone cabinet himself and, getting
in touch with "Mr. Hill," arranged to meet him the following day
at noon at the County Club in Norwich.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>

THE VAULTS OF BLACKARDEN</h2>

<p class="first">BOTH Lord Delamarne and Larose were punctual at
the rendezvous in the Norwich club on the following morning.
They shook hands coldly, and Larose at once suggested they
should have their talk in one of the cardrooms. "It will be
quieter there and we shall be less likely to be
interrupted."</p>

<p>Seated comfortably before the fire, Lord Delamarne eyed the
younger man intently, in a guarded half-suspicious way.
Ex-policeman though Larose might be, his lordship had to admit
there was an air of distinction about him and he noted he looked
very capable and sure of himself.</p>

<p>Larose opened the conversation without any delay. "I take it,
my lord," he said, "that you keep yourself in touch with current
affairs and so know all about the dreadful murders of some of
those who were working upon the atom bomb and, later, that of
Professor Glenowen?"</p>

<p>"I know what I've read in the newspapers," commented his
lordship dryly, "but I have no inside information."</p>

<p>Larose smiled. "I hardly expected you would," he said. He
went on, "Now you were well acquainted with the late Professor
Glenowen, were you not?"</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne inclined his head. "I have known him for more
than twenty years," he replied, "and he had many times, until of
late years, been my guest at the castle."</p>

<p>Larose came straight to the point. "Then it will surprise
you," he said sharply, "to be told there are the strongest
reasons for believing that he instigated what are known as the
atom bomb murders&mdash;the whole six of them."</p>

<p>His lordship sat up with a jerk and his eyebrows came
together in a heavy frown. "Instigated!" he exclaimed. "Do you
mean caused them to be done?"</p>

<p>"Yes, paid for them," said Larose calmly, "hired an assassin
with huge sums to carry them out&mdash;picked the victims one by
one, some only because they were working on the atom bomb, but
others seemingly because he had a personal spite against them."
He shook his head. "I know it seems incredible, but everything
points to its being an actual fact."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Lord Delamarne after a long pause.
"Certainly I have always known Glenowen to be an excessively
spiteful man, and admit that in the last year or so he appeared
to have lost a lot of his mental balance, but to carry this
spite to actual murder&mdash;well, I simply do not believe it.
It's impossible."</p>

<p>"Well, you listen to me," said Larose, "and you'll soon
realise how I came to the conclusions I did." He proceeded to
relate the many visits the dead man had paid to Carmel Abbey,
his continual interest to the point of gloating over them in the
murders that had been taking place, and finally, how his,
Larose's, suspicions had suddenly become aroused and how after
patient investigation he had linked up the professor's interest
in one way or another with every one of the murdered men.</p>

<p>With his eyes intently fixed on the face of Larose, Lord
Delamarne had listened, without interrupting to ask a question
or say a single word. At length, Larose stopped speaking,
evidently expecting some comment to be made, and his lordship
said grimly, "But Glenowen was himself murdered! How do you
account for that?"</p>

<p>"Murdered by the assassin he had himself called into being,"
said Larose, "murdered by a shrewd, resolute and clever man who
was far-seeing enough to realise that his employer, in his
madness, had now become a dreadful danger to him," and he
proceeded to relate the next part of his story, now dealing with
the maniacal excitement of Glenowen and the memoirs of his life
which he had evidently been writing.</p>

<p>"But why are you telling me all this?" queried his lordship
with some irritation. "In what way does it concern me?"</p>

<p>"For the very good reason," replied Larose solemnly, "because
it happens you are acquainted with Glenowen's murderer. You know
him quite well."</p>

<p>His lordship's face was a study of angry amazement, but he
made no comment and Larose went on, "Yes and I have asked you to
meet me like this because I want to warn you. I know this
murderer, too, and I am afraid he may now be marking you down
for some evil purpose of his own." He shook his head. "Not
necessarily murder this time, perhaps only robbery. Still, he's
a man who would stick at nothing."</p>

<p>His lordship continued silent, and Larose said sharply, "Now,
Lord Delamarne, you are known as a wealthy man and in the
possession of many costly and beautiful things." He shrugged his
shoulders. "I won't beat about the bush, but remind you frankly
of the many rumours which you must be quite aware have been
going about for years, to the effect that in the underground
parts of your castle there are hidden treasures of incalculable
value. Now"&mdash;and he lowered his voice to little above a
whisper"&mdash;among your acquaintances or friends, among those
to whom from time to time you have given the hospitality of the
castle, can you think of any one of them who would fit the bill
as a possible thief, or perhaps even worse than that if he
turned his abilities into evil channels?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't," snapped out Lord Delamarne. "I am particular
whom I choose as my friends."</p>

<p>Larose ignored his denial. "Don't answer so quickly, my
lord," he reproved sharply. "Just think if among those guests
who have stayed at the castle there has been a bold and resolute
man, very capable, and whose history, as far as you have learnt,
suggests that he would hold the lives and property of others
very cheaply. Come, surely you can pick him out at once."</p>

<p>His lordship looked scornful. "I know whom you want me to
pick out. You mean my nephew's friend, Major Mangan."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" exclaimed Larose. "Major Mangan, the distinguished
soldier who was decorated with the D.S.O., the one-time officer
in a crack Commando unit who fought with the Resistance Movement
in France and who, if you draw him out, will talk of his many
personal killings among the Huns when with his little band of
patriots he was working from the Auvergne Mountains. Yes, that's
the fine gentleman, and now I'll tell you what has been
happening to him lately."</p>

<p>He related the many visits Mangan had paid to Professor
Glenowen during the time the atom-bomb murders were going on,
how he was known then to the professor's servants as 'Mr.
Brown,' how from the night of the professor's murder he had
vanished into the blue and for a long time could not be found,
how he was finally tracked down by Scotland Yard, and finally,
his, Larose's conversation with him in his shop in Wardour
Street when he threatened to get his revenge in due time.</p>

<p>And all the while Lord Delamarne had listened in an absorbed
concentration. The scornful expression had gradually passed from
his face, and towards the end he had begun to look very
troubled. With Larose's story apparently finished, speaking with
an obvious effort, he said, "But you have really no evidence
that anything is absolutely true, now have you, Mr. Larose?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No concrete evidence, my lord, and
that is why Major Mangan is today walking about as free as you
and I. All the evidence is circumstantial&mdash;" he spoke
warmly, "but, Good God, how this circumstantial evidence piles
up," he took a photograph out of his pocket, "even to this last
piece, which is certainly as damnable as anything."</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne stared hard at the photo. "Of what is it?" he
asked looking very puzzled.</p>

<p>"The lounge-hall at my place, Carmel Abbey," said Larose "and
those marks on the wall where two rifle bullets crashed into the
plaster." He spoke grimly. "Three nights ago, my lord, I was
twice fired upon as I was entering my front door," and he
proceeded to relate everything that had happened there.</p>

<p>"What a dreadful tale, or rather series of tales, you have
told me," sighed Lord Delamarne. "It is true I know very little
about this Major Mangan, and what I have learnt comes from my
nephew Lieutenant Chester Avon. Still, he tells me the major
moves in the best circles in Town and is of a high reputation.
He says, too, he's well-off, of independent means."</p>

<p>"Independent means!" scoffed Larose. "Why, he is only an art
and second-hand dealer in a small way and makes his living from
that little shop I've just told you of in Wardour Street. For a
long while, too, the police have been suspecting him of being a
receiver of stolen goods. Several times they have raided the
shop, though I admit they have not been able to catch him as
yet."</p>

<p>"Then does Scotland Yard want to make out that he is working
with a gang?" frowned his lordship.</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, they don't say that. In the
matter of the atom-bomb murders they at first thought that only
he and Glenowen were involved in them, but later they realised
the people of the Baltic Embassy were doing their utmost to
prevent the major being traced and so, quite naturally, came to
the conclusion they must be in it, too," and he related to Lord
Delamarne how it had been found out Captain Michaeloff and
Mangan knew each other, and the false description the former had
so deliberately given to 'Mr. Brown!'</p>

<p>The old lord's eyes were opened very wide now and he was
moistening over his dry lips with his tongue. God!&mdash;and his
daily, hourly fear for many weeks of late had been that the
Baltic people were watching him and trying to find out what he
had to hide! He had been so sure it was they who had sent that
third party to him to make enquiries those months back about
Colonel Rubin whom he had known so many years ago! Then, worst
of all, he had been fearful again that it had been they who had
planted that footman in the Castle as a spy, that Footman,
Thomas, whom he had caught in his dirty work and&mdash;but he
broke off his train of thought to ask abruptly, "Tell me, Mr.
Larose, if you had caught that man who fired at you the other
evening, what would you have done to him?"</p>

<p>"Shot him like a mad dog," snarled Larose, "put an end to him
without the slightest compunction!"</p>

<p>"And then," queried his lordship curiously, "you would have
told the police what had happened? In effect, you would have
given yourself up?"</p>

<p>"Not I," laughed Larose, "unless, of course, it were bound to
become known I had shot him. If it were not, then after I had
shot him and I should have come away, and left him just where he
had fallen. I should have justified myself that, to the peril I
had escaped, there was no need to add all the publicity and
annoyance which would have benefited no one."</p>

<p>"You mean then that you would have taken the law into your
own hands," asked his lordship, "and left it at that?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," nodded Larose, "and my conscience would have been
very clear." He regarded his lordship intently. "But why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>It appeared, however, that Lord Delamarne had not taken in
the question, for he made no reply. A long silence followed,
with him turning away his eyes from Larose and staring
thoughtfully out of the window. At last he spoke hoarsely and
with another effort.</p>

<p>"I am very grateful to you, Mr. Larose," he said, "for all
you have told me. It was very kind of you to take such interest
in me." He looked very troubled. "The whole matter means much
more to me than you can have the slightest idea, in fact I
realise I am in more danger than you would ever think. If it be
true that Major Mangan is working with the Baltic Embassy, then
I am in the hands of murderers. They are a vile lot these Baltic
people and murder and assassination would be nothing to
them."</p>

<p>Larose spoke as sympathetically as he could. "I know that, my
lord and am very sorry to hear you speak as you do. But if I can
help you in any way, I shall be very pleased to do so."</p>

<p>"I am sure of that," said Lord Delamarne warmly&mdash;he
hesitated a few moments "and I think you are about the only
person I should dare tell my troubles to. Now, I can't decide
all at once. I must consider everything. Remember, I am an old
man and can't make up my mind as quickly as I used to."</p>

<p>"Don't hurry, my lord," smiled Larose. "I am in no hurry. I
have plenty of time."</p>

<p>"But I mean I can't decide straight off, today," said his
lordship. "I must go home and think everything over." He
hesitated. "Now, may I trespass more upon your kindness and meet
you again somewhere tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere you like," nodded Larose, "if you make it nearer
home, so that neither of us will have to come too far."</p>

<p>His lordship considered a few moments. "Then what if I picked
you up in my car in the main road just outside the gates of your
drive? We could go to somewhere on the coast where no one is
likely to see us."</p>

<p>"That'll do me," said Larose, "and make it eleven o'clock."
He frowned. "But are you sure you can trust your chauffeur? Have
you perfect confidence in him?"</p>

<p>His lordship smiled. "It isn't a him, it's a her, and she's a
young woman of twenty-four."</p>

<p>"But have you had her for long?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>His lordship smiled again. "Only for a few weeks, but you
need have no worry there as I knew both her parents. She can be
trusted implicitly."</p>

<p>The next morning it was a very different Lord Delamarne who
picked up Larose at the appointed place. All his cares seemed to
have passed from him and he looked untroubled and even
smiling.</p>

<p>Penelope was introduced and Larose admired the pert and
pretty face so interestedly regarding him. "Nothing to be afraid
of there," he told himself. "Quite trustworthy, very capable and
very determined." He suppressed a grin. "But, if I'm anything of
a judge of character, if the old lord doesn't look out, with all
his grim and masterful ways; she'll soon be getting the upper
hand of him."</p>

<p>They drove to a part of the coast not far from Sheringham,
where at that time of year they had it all to themselves.
Leaving Penelope in the car, the two men made their ways down
the cliff and made themselves comfortable upon some big tussocks
of seagrass at the bottom.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Larose," began his lordship, "I've made up my mind
to tell you everything and when you've heard what I have to say,
I am quite sure you will understand my hesitation yesterday." He
drew in a deep breath. "Thirty years ago a trusted officer of
the Czar Nicolas the Second, a Colonel Rubin, escaped from
Russia bringing with him a very valuable portion of the Crown
jewels. I had known him when as a young man I had been attached
to the Baltic Embassy in St. Petersburg. To make a long story
short, he came to stay with me at Blackarden Castle, and a few
weeks after his arrival, however, he was stricken down with
pneumonia and died, leaving the jewels in my possession in the
Castle vaults." He paused a few moments. "Now, have you taken
all that in?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded and he went on. "With all the Russian royal
family so foully murdered and their country in possession of the
bloody assassins, there was no one to whom I thought I was
justified in rendering up the jewels. So I retained them and
kept them as a secret to myself. Of course it was known to the
revolutionaries that Colonel Rubin had been entrusted with them
to carry away to a place of safety, but, apparently, no trace of
him had been picked up and no one knew what had become of him. I
may mention here that we had every reason to believe that not
one word of his coming to Blackarden had ever leaked out and so
upon his death, unknown to everyone except a priest of his
Church, he was buried with great secrecy in the dead of night in
the Castle vaults. This priest and I had dug the ground
ourselves."</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne frowned. "Now, even had I been so basely
inclined, there was no occasion for me to dispose of the jewels
and make use of the money for myself. As it happened, I had
other treasures of considerable value hidden away in the vaults.
In the Indian Mutiny of 1857 my grandfather had acquired them in
a way which was considered perfectly honourable and legitimate
in those days, and I have been drawing upon it freely during all
these later years of my life." He smiled grimly. "So all along
there has been some truth in the rumours about hidden treasure
which I am perfectly aware have been going round."</p>

<p>He went on, "The Czarist treasure, however, I regarded as a
sacred trust and, not being able to hand it over to any rightful
owner, very soon after its possession I began using it to
mitigate the hardship of those who were suffering under the
cruelty and harshness of the Bolshevik regime. Through secret
channels I started selling the jewels, one by one so as not to
attract attention, and giving the proceeds to societies who were
helping the Russian refugees. This has now been going on for
more than twenty-five years."</p>

<p>"All along, too, I was feeling quite confident that by no
possibility would the treasure be stolen, for, as I expect you
have heard, access to the vaults is impossible to anyone unless
he knows the secret of getting down there. Nearly a hundred
years ago my grandfather walled off all the lower parts of the
castle and the only stairway left is a secret one through a
panel in one of the walls of my study."</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne sighed heavily and his troubled look
reappeared. "And so things were," he continued, "up to about
between four and five months ago, and then a bomb was thrown
into all my so-fancied security and I realised that, even after
all these years, my secret was not safe. One morning I had a
visit from a man, obviously a foreigner I realised the moment I
set eyes on him, who told me he was a Hungarian and a teacher of
music by profession. He said he had but recently escaped from a
concentration camp near Budapest and had been asked by some
relatives of a Colonel Rubin to try to find out what had become
of him after he had left Russia just before the Revolution. He,
this Hungarian, had been sent expressly to me because Colonel
Rubin had confided to these relations that he was intending to
come to me directly he reached England."</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne shook his head angrily. "I knew he was telling
lies there, because at the time of his death Rubin had no
relatives living, and again, engaged upon the highly secret
mission that he was, he would have been the last person in the
world to make known his intentions to anyone."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Of course, while thinking it wisest to
admit I <i>had</i> known the Colonel, I denied emphatically that
he had ever stayed at the Castle. I said, too, I had been
acquainted with him so slightly that, after thirty years, I
hardly remembered what he was like. Still, the man kept on
asking me the same questions over and over again and I could see
he didn't believe me. At last, when I got rid of him, he left me
in a state of very uneasy curiosity as to by whom he had been
sent to question me. However, left in peace for a couple of
months or so, I was confidently hoping I should be worried no
more. Then a dreadful calamity happened. I caught one of my
servants in the very act of tapping upon one of the walls of the
study not far from where behind an oak panel, the stairway down
to the vaults begins."</p>

<p>His lordship's face hardened and he went on grimly, "But the
wretch never lived to pass on any discovery he might have made
as&mdash;" he paused for a few moments "&mdash;he got what he
deserved upon the spot."</p>

<p>Larose gasped incredulously. "You don't mean to tell me you
killed him?" he asked.</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne nodded. "I do," he said. "I struck him on the
forehead with a heavy poker and he died instantly. He was not a
robust-looking man and his bones must have been very thin, as I
could feel the poker crash in."</p>

<p>Larose gasped again and a short silence ensued, with Lord
Delamarne regarding him with an amused smile. He went on, "It
was in the middle of the night not far off two o'clock in the
morning. I had not been able to get to sleep and, as I do, often
I put on my dressing-gown and wandered round the Castle. Coming
to the corridor into which my study opens, to my amazement I saw
a light coming from under the door. More amazed still, I saw the
door was not closed, but only pushed to. Almost holding my
breath, I opened the door wider and put my head round." He held
up his hand impressively. "There was this footman standing, as I
say, actually close to the oak panel behind which lies the
stairway leading to the vaults. Thrust into both his ears were
the plug-ends of the rubber tubes of a doctor's stethoscope, and
he was gently tapping upon the panel with his knuckles. I picked
up a poker out of the grate and tiptoed towards him. For the
moment, with his ears plugged as they were, he did not hear me
coming, but then, turning round, one of his hands went like
lightning to his hip-pocket and he sprang at me with a cry like
that of a wild beast. I was too quick for him and struck as hard
as I could at his head with the knobbed end of the poker."</p>

<p>He paused in his story to ask dryly, "Is that what you would
have done, Mr. Larose?"</p>

<p>Larose frowned. "I don't know. I might have. Go on." He
nodded. "Yes, of course I should. It was not a time for
hesitation."</p>

<p>"For the moment," continued his lordship, "I remember I was
filled with a dreadful consternation at what I had done, but
that feeling passed instantly into one of fury when I bent down
over him and realised what he had been intending for me." He
nodded significantly. "The hand which he had thrust so quickly
into his hip-pocket had got caught in the lining as it had been
dragging out a vicious-looking knuckleduster. You see he was all
prepared to go to any length if he was disturbed, so if my
conscience had troubled me, I should have excused myself that I
had acted in self-defence."</p>

<p>"But what did you do next?" asked Larose. "You carried the
body down into the vaults."</p>

<p>"Yes, I took off his jacket and wrapped it round his head so
that there should be no trail of blood, and half-carried and
half-dragged it below."</p>

<p>Larose looked troubled. "Then, if ever you were suspected and
a search was made his body could soon be found."</p>

<p>His lordship shook his head. "No, it is gone. It went within
a few minutes of his death."</p>

<p>"But where to," asked Larose, very puzzled.</p>

<p>It seemed almost as if his lordship were repressing a smile.
"I don't know. No one ever will."</p>

<p>Larose began to feel angry. He thought he was being fooled.
"Is that meant to be a joke, my lord?" he asked with a
frown.</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Lord Delamarne quickly. "I assure you it is
the actual truth. Even a thousand men such as you, Mr. Larose,
could not find it now." He bent forward. "There are many secrets
about this grim old Castle of mine and one of them is that there
is an underground river running underneath it, as in all
certainty it has been running since the first stone of the
castle walls was laid nearly seven hundred years ago. Down among
the vaults there is what looks like a large well, but it is not
a well, for at the bottom it opens into this river. You can
lower a lantern nearly forty feet and see the black water
passing by. When there have been heavy rains in the distant
hills you can even hear it all through the vaults gurgling as it
goes along." He nodded. "I tipped the body in it and in a moment
it was gone."</p>

<p>"Good heavens," exclaimed Larose. "I'd like to see that
well."</p>

<p>"You shall," said his lordship. "Directly this trouble has
quieted down I'll show you over everything and you'll be greatly
interested."</p>

<p>"But has no one ever tried to find out to where it goes?"
asked Larose, very interested.</p>

<p>"Not in my time, or that of my father or his father before,
him," said his lordship. "It has been taken for granted and the
whole mystery left alone. However, it has always been thought by
the very few who have been in the secret that it must finish up
somewhere under the Ely marshes, as even in the longest droughts
they never become dry." He looked very troubled. "But now to get
back to this matter of it being suspected I may be still in
possession of the Russian Crown jewels. What do you think of the
whole position?"</p>

<p>"Was that footman a foreigner?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Certainly not! He was English right enough, and always
struck me as being educated and much above the servant
class."</p>

<p>"Well, I think it serious, very serious," replied Larose. He
smiled. "I know it won't frighten you, as I don't think anything
really would, but has the idea never entered into your mind that
whoever are after these jewels may take a short cut and get hold
of you to make you speak."</p>

<p>"You mean kidnapping and then torture?" said his lordship. He
nodded. "Yes, I have, but then I very seldom leave the precincts
of the castle grounds and there is always help from my
men-servants within call." He patted his hip-pocket. "Besides, I am
always armed. I always carry a Mawson automatic with me."</p>

<p>"Good," said Larose, "and, if you are ever cornered, don't be
slow in using it. Remember&mdash;if it is this Baltic crowd who
are after you, they are desperate men. They would kidnap you,
torture you to make you speak and then without the slightest
pity, kill you so that there should be no witnesses against
them."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," said his lordship, "I shall be all ready to
shoot first and think afterwards." He frowned. "But now about
this Major Mangan. Granted he's all you make him out to be,
there is not the slightest evidence as yet that these Baltic
people have put him on to me. Don't forget he has been coming to
the Castle, on and off for over a year, and now, upon this visit
of his in a few days, it is not he who has sought me out but I
who have invited him to visit me. Then how does that fit in with
your idea that his coming means more danger to me?"</p>

<p>"Put in that way," agreed Larose readily, "I know it doesn't
fit in at all, but considered from a different angle it suggests
a deadly prospect. You tell me you have reason to believe that
the Baltic Government is plotting against you&mdash;I have
absolute proof they are upon friendly and even criminal terms
with this Major Mangan&mdash;then if you are right about their
plotting I, also am right about the danger to you."</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne shook his head. "No, you cannot be so certain
there." He regarded Larose intendy. "Is it not possible that
with a secret as great as this they have not dared to trust him,
and so he knows nothing about it?"</p>

<p>A long silence followed and Larose shrugged his shoulders.
"It is possible, and yet, knowing him to be the bold and evil
man that he is, could anything better fit in with any plot to
get hold of those jewels than to have such a confederate inside
the Castle?"</p>

<p>"Well, I shall risk it," snapped his lordship, "and let him
pay his visit in the ordinary way. I am now all prepared for
anything which may happen and if more trouble is coming to me I
want to bring it to a head." He spoke decisively. "You must
realise, Mr. Larose, I don't want to live what remains of my
life with his sword hanging over me. If I become certain that
the danger, as I hoped, is not finished with the death of that
footman, then I shall transfer every scrap of both my treasures
into the safe custody of some bank and be done with the worry
once and for all. The continued anxiety is too great for an old
man."</p>

<p>"Then you would like to believe," said Larose thoughtfully,
"that that footman was not after the Crown jewels."</p>

<p>His lordship hesitated. "I was hoping so," he said. "I was
thinking he was just an ordinary thief who was coming after my
valuable silver which is common knowledge I keep down in the
vaults."</p>

<p>Larose considered. "But aware as you are now, my lord, that
it is possible Major Mangan may be working with the Baltic
Embassy, can't you see what a great risk you are running in
receiving the major into the Castle as a guest?"</p>

<p>"But what can he do by himself?" asked his lordship testily.
"He can't let anyone into the house on the quiet when we are all
supposed to be in bed and asleep, as the alarms upon all the
doors and windows on the ground floor, which are the only ones
which matter, would prevent it. Every night at eleven I see
these alarms are all set and no one can tamper with any one of
them without starting the whole lot ringing. I designed them
myself and I alone know how to operate them. All connected up
together, they are electrically controlled from a master-switch
in my bedroom."</p>

<p>"It sounds all right," said Larose, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then if anyone <i>did</i> manage to get into the castle,"
went on his lordship, "short of breaking down the door, he
couldn't get into the study, as the lock there is a special
one."</p>

<p>"But the footman got in," frowned Larose.</p>

<p>"Ah, but that was carelessness upon my part. I am sure I had
not closed the door properly. Unhappily, I am inclined to do
silly things like that, but now this secretary of mine comes
everywhere with me at night to make sure I do not do such a
thing again."</p>

<p>"What exactly does this girl know?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"That my valuable silver is kept down in the vaults and how
to get down there by the secret stairway. I thought it wisest to
tell her that because of the possibility of being taken ill one
day when I had gone down there, as usual, all by myself. Now I
am going to trust her still more and warn her I am expecting an
attempt may be made to rob me and that Major Mangan may be
involved in it."</p>

<p>"And when is the major actually coming upon his visit?"</p>

<p>"Next Monday for four days to have a last go at the
pheasants. There will be two other guns besides him and my
nephew. No, he doesn't know these other men. They are very old
friends of mine and live in the Midlands. He has never met them.
They go away on the Friday, but the major is staying a day
longer and returns to Town on the Saturday morning."</p>

<p>"Then as I take it," said Larose, "if there really is a plot
being hatched to get hold of the jewels, Mangan's part in it
will be only to get the thieves into the Castle. It will be
they, and not he, who know where to find them."</p>

<p>"That is it," nodded his lordship. "After what you have told
me, Mangan can have been brought only lately into the
conspiracy."</p>

<p>They talked on for some time, with Larose's final warning
that, if Lord Delamarne should notice anything suspicious about
Mangan's actions, he was to ring up him, Larose, at once. "No,
it's no trouble at all," he said. "If only for my own safety I
want to lay him by the heels."</p>

<p>Going back to the car, Larose suggested they should return by
way of the coast road so that they could pass the late
professor's bungalow. "I'm rather curious there," he said, "as
it has been sold privately and no one seems to know who's bought
it. The buyer went to see Glenowen's sister, just asked the
price and paid for it upon the nail, all in £5 notes. He gave no
address, but said his name was Jenkins."</p>

<p>Coming within sight of the bungalow, they saw a man leaning
over the garden fence, watching some sailing boats out to sea
through a pair of glasses. Penelope was driving the car with
both Lord Delamarne and Larose at the back. Seeing the man in
the distance, more by instinct than anything else, Larose shrank
into his corner and pulled his cap well down over his face. Upon
them approaching nearer to the bungalow, apparently hearing the
sound of the car, the man turned his glasses upon them.</p>

<p>Something familiar in his attitude struck Larose and a few
moments later he whispered hoarsely to Lord Delamarne, "The
devil! It's that attache from the Embassy I told you about, that
Captain Michaeloff. Take a good eye-full of him in case he ever
comes your way."</p>

<p>Some twenty yards or so before drawing level with him the man
lowered his glasses and fixed his eyes upon them with a hard and
intent stare. It was over in a few seconds and they had passed
by. Through the window at the back of the car, much to the
relief of Larose, he saw the man had returned to watching the
sailing-boats out to sea.</p>

<p>"And what do you make of that?" asked Larose rather
exultingly of his lordship who was frowning hard.</p>

<p>"If you are perfectly sure it was the man from the Embassy,"
said Lord Delamarne, "I don't like it over-much. It may go to
confirm so much of what you have been telling me."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was Captain Michaeloff right enough," said
Larose.</p>

<p>"There's no mistaking those horse teeth and that long face of
his. Still, it may be only just a coincidence. Our Secret
Service has been well aware that he and Glenowen used to visit
each other in Town and, probably, the captain has been a visitor
to the bungalow here as well. So, it isn't unreasonable to
suppose that if he had taken a fancy to it, he would buy it when
it came into the market. He would certainly get it very
cheaply."</p>

<p>"But the Russian Crown jewels in my Castle," said his
lordship, looking very troubled, "and now those who would give
so much to obtain them only such a few miles away. Surely the
vultures are gathering for the carcase?"</p>

<p>"Well, if they have, they've come jolly early," laughed
Larose, "as it is not until next week friend Mangan is going to
appear." He shook his head. "No, my lord, don't become
pessimistic, a lot may happen before these vultures you mention
may get anything in their beaks and then, maybe, they won't be
in a condition to enjoy it."</p>

<p>Having dropped Larose where they had picked him up, Lord
Delamarne moved over in the car to sit beside Penelope. For some
minutes they drove on in silence and then his lordship asked
casually, "and I suppose you've heard of Mr. Larose?"</p>

<p>"Who hasn't?" nodded Penelope. "Besides, Vera has told me a
lot about him."</p>

<p>"Vera!" frowned his lordship. "But what on earth made her
bring him up to you?"</p>

<p>"Because she thinks now that I am a detective," said
Penelope. She laughed merrily. "It is really very funny. At
first she was intensely jealous of your confiding so much in me,
as she guesses I have been down into the vaults with you. She
couldn't make it out. Then all suddenly she said light came to
her and she realised I was a woman detective. She thinks now you
have brought me here, either to help guard your priceless silver
or else to clear up the mystery of that footman's
disappearance."</p>

<p>"Has she questioned you?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, a lot! But I said I had sworn to keep everything
secret and so I have told her nothing. She's quite satisfied now
and has stopped asking any more questions. I've made her promise
most solemnly not to give me away to anyone, not even to
Joan."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said his lordship, and after a few moments he asked,
"I suppose you can guess why I didn't want anyone to know why I
was meeting Mr. Larose this morning?"</p>

<p>Penelope nodded. "Yes, it's something to do with those
thieves whom you expect may some day try to rob you of your
silver collection."</p>

<p>"Yes, and one whom we have reason to suspect," he said dryly,
"may be among the visitors who are coming to stay with me for
the shooting in a few days." He smiled grimly. "I shall want you
to watch him."</p>

<p>Penelope was thrilled. "Oh, how exciting! I shall love that.
I've always fancied I should make a good detective as I note
everything about everyone."</p>

<p>"And what have you noted about me?" he asked with a
frown.</p>

<p>Penelope laughed again. "For one thing you are inclined to be
suspicious about every car that comes near us. When we are
meeting or passing one I notice your hand goes to your hip-pocket,
as if you had got a pistol there." She went on. "But
tell me who's this visitor whom you will be wanting me to
watch?"</p>

<p>"A friend of my nephew's, I regret to say," he said, "a Major
Mangan, a distinguished soldier!"</p>

<p>"Major Mangan!" she exclaimed, very surprised. "Oh, I know
him, or rather I've seen him. Tall, dark and good-looking, and
his hair is always plastered well down. At one time he used to
come into the 'Rialto' quite a lot. Besides, I heard about him
in my Society journalist days."</p>

<p>"What did you hear about him?" frowned his lordship.</p>

<p>"Nothing much to his credit," she said. "He's a regular man
about Town, plays cards for high stakes, and they say he's
always to be seen with men richer than himself."</p>

<p>His lordship looked uneasy. "Then you shall keep your eyes
upon him when he's about here&mdash;" he spoke sternly
"&mdash;but mind you, not a word about it to my nephew, as I'm
not quite certain Chester can keep a secret."</p>

<p>"But you're wrong there, my lord," said Penelope instantly.
"When he likes, Mr. Avon can be as sensible as anybody. You're
prejudiced against him because he's been tied to his mother's
apron strings for so long."</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne made no comment and the conversation died
down. Arriving back at the Castle, rather to his lordship's
surprise because it was so early in the week, he saw his
nephew's car parked in the drive. The old man gave Penelope a
hard searching glance, but she looked placid and unruffled and
as if the car being there was of no interest to her.</p>

<p>"Did you know he was coming here today?" he asked
sharply.</p>

<p>"Who coming?" she asked. "Oh, Mr. Avon!" She shook her head.
"No, he wouldn't tell me." She smiled roguishly. "We are not as
interested in each other as much as all that."</p>

<p>Still Lord Delamarne noticed it was a very bright smile young
Avon gave the pretty secretary. "I've got a fortnight's leave,
sir," he said to his uncle, "and thought I'd get my eye in for
the long-tails next week by having a pot at the rabbits."</p>

<p>It was quite a happy week for Penelope, and, with her duties
light and her employer allowing her plenty of freedom, she saw
plenty of the heir of Blackarden Castle. In her own mind she had
no doubt she was now getting him well in tow, though chances of
any love-making were very few as Joan or Vera were always about.
Still, upon two occasions they managed to exchange kisses in the
conservatory, picquancy being added to them the second time by
knowing Lord Delamarne was just outside talking to one of the
gardeners.</p>

<p>Holding to her settled plan of campaign, she made very light
of the kisses and never appeared to be too willing for them.
"Don't you see, Boy," she whispered, "if we get caught it will
only mean that I shall be sent away, and the kissing isn't worth
it. There's no background behind it for me. It's only just a
pleasant little interlude," and he whispered back to her not to
be so brutal.</p>

<p>The day before the shooting party was due to arrive, Penelope
was alone with Lord Delamarne in their little office, and the
latter remarked frowningly. "Now, young lady, I shall be
depending a lot upon you these next few days. I want you to pay
a lot of attention to this Major Mangan. You understand?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Penelope instantly. "What exactly are you
expecting me to do?"</p>

<p>His lordship spoke impressively. "As I have told you, I
imagine him to be the spy Mr. Larose is expecting him to be and
that he is working with that man we saw in the garden of
Professor Glenowen's bungalow the other day. So, put yourself in
his place and think what you would do. To begin with, you would
want to find out how you could get a confederate into the Castle
at night when everyone was in bed. You would be interested in
the alarms upon the doors and windows, and would like to find
out how they work, so that you could tamper with them from
inside. You would be interested in what times we all went up to
our rooms. You understand now, don't you?"</p>

<p>Penelope nodded. "You mean I am to notice if he seems curious
about little things that would not interest the ordinary
person?"</p>

<p>"That's it," said his lordship. "Curious about little things.
Then we don't know if that footman who left so suddenly had any
suspicions that the secret stairway down into the vaults lead
out of my study." He eyed her intently. "On the face of it, that
seems probable, for if someone hadn't found out something about
that stairway there would be no sense in breaking into the
Castle and then not know what to do next."</p>

<p>Penelope made a grimace. "It all seems horrible to me," she
said, "as if we were standing upon the brink of some dreadful
precipice."</p>

<p>"It may be we are," commented his lordship, looking however,
quite cheerful, "but, forewarned, as we are we shan't be the
ones to fall over it. Mr. Larose is all ready to come here at
once if I give him a call." He went on. "So assuming these
possible thieves know something about that secret stairway, they
will be very interested in my study, and in that case Major
Mangan will try to get a look round there whenever he can." He
frowned. "What it all amounts to is that we shall have to keep
an eye on his movements all the time he's here." A thought
struck him. "Of course you will not mention about the major to
my nephew."</p>

<p>"Of course I shan't," said Penelope indignantly. "Whatever
Mr. Avon's gifts may be, he's no actor and if he were in our
confidence Major Mangan would guess from his manner that
something was going on against him." She laughed. "The other day
I asked Mr. Avon not to stare at me so hard or you all might
begin to think he was getting unduly interested in me." She
shrugged her shoulders. "But it didn't make any difference. He
stares at me just the same."</p>

<p>"So I have noticed," remarked his lordship dryly, and he
asked sharply. "Has he kissed you yet?"</p>

<p>Penelope regarded him reproachfully. "What a question to put
to me, my lord! Do you forget you were young yourself once?"</p>

<p>"That's no answer to my question," frowned his lordship.</p>

<p>Penelope looked amused. "Well, as that is a strictly private
matter," she said, "I don't consider I am obliged to tell you
the truth." Her eyes twinkled. "So my answer, my lord, is in the
negative."</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne smiled back. "Well, I'm only telling you for
your own good. I believe my nephew is very casual in his
dealings with young women and no matter what kisses he may give
you he'll never want you for his wife."</p>

<p>"I know that, my lord," agreed Penelope promptly. "I may be
all right to flirt with and not the kind of woman he'd like to
have ordering him about." She spoke sharply. "He knows I'd stop
half of his forty cigarettes a day and most of his double
whiskies."</p>

<p>The following day just in time for lunch, the three expected
visitors duly arrived, two of them together from Leicester and
the Major from Town. Penelope was greatly impressed with the
Major and thought his manners and general bearing charming.</p>

<p>Joan had told Penelope he would talk to each of the three
girls as if he were in love with her and, in spite of her
customary self-assurance, his compliments to Penelope, given in
such a tactful way that no one could take an exception to them,
made it difficult for her not to blush.</p>

<p>"But you mustn't talk to Miss Smith like that," laughed Joan,
when it happened once that Lord Delamarne was not present. "As I
tell everyone, Father is the only man here allowed to admire
her. She's only been in the Castle a few weeks and yet she's
more in his confidence than anyone else." She looked slily at
Penelope. "Sometimes they are shut up together for hours in that
musty old study of his," and Penelope would have liked to have
slapped Joan's face for being such a little fool.</p>

<p>In the afternoon it had started to rain hard and there were
no outdoor amusements. So everyone adjourned into one of the
long sheds in the Castle grounds and they had a shooting
competition with pistols.</p>

<p>The major and young Avon had both got their own pistols and,
lending them round, quite an interesting contest ensued. As was
expected the major won, but, rather to everyone's and
particularly Lord Delamarne's astonishment, Avon was only a few
points behind.</p>

<p>"You've come on a lot lately, haven't you?" queried his
lordship of his nephew.</p>

<p>"But I've always been pretty good, sir," replied Avon. "At
Aldershot I was the best in our mess," and, from his lordship's
expression, Penelope realised his nephew had gone up in his
estimation.</p>

<p>The shooting match over, the major insisted he must take all
their photographs in the big lounge hall. "I've brought my
daylight developer with me as well as my camera," he said
smilingly. "So I can run through the whole thing at once, and
there'll be no waiting for any of you to see how good-looking
you all are."</p>

<p>So, taking great care that they were all standing exactly as
he wanted them, he posed them with their backs to the age-old
massive front door, and, later, gave them a clear and very good
little snap. Everyone was enthusiastic except Penelope who for
some reason appeared to be very thoughtful.</p>

<p>Dinner that evening was a very merry one, with the gallant
major undoubtedly the star guest and at his best as a raconteur
of witty stories. Many times during the meal the old lord was
feeling very puzzled. One moment he was regarding Mangan as a
consummate actor and the next&mdash;he was anathematising
Gilbert Larose as a consummate fool.</p>

<p>At the usual hour of eleven o'clock that night, accompanied
now, as a matter of general routine by Penelope to see that he
omitted nothing, Lord Delamarne made the rounds of the ground
floor of the Castle to be certain everything was in order for
the night. The round completed, he remarked to Penelope with a
slow, sarcastic smile, "Nothing to report as yet, Miss Smith? No
suspicious actions of our amusing friend?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much," replied Penelope casually, "except that I
notice in those snaps he got an excellent picture of the wiring
of the big alarm upon the front door. Of course it may have been
only just a coincidence but, with one of those snaps in his
hand, there would be no need for anyone to be seen studying
closely how the wires are laid," and his lordship's sarcastic
smile at once changed into a heavy frown.</p>

<p>And certainly a little while later, Lord Delamarne would have
frowned more heavily still had he been able to see what the
Major was doing when the latter had retired to his bedroom for
the night. With one of his snap-shots in one hand and a
carefully drawn diagram in the other, he was interestedly
comparing the two. Apparently his inspection was satisfactory,
as he was smiling happily when he placed them in a wallet, and
locked the wallet up in one of the large suit-cases he had
brought with him.</p>

<p>The following day nothing was seen of the shooting party from
breakfast-time until they returned home at dusk. Then the Major
made himself as agreeable as ever and in the hour before dinner
went with Penelope into the picture gallery to admire the
painting there.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful artist this chap Botticelli was," he
remarked as they stood before the painting of a beautiful young
girl admiring her reflections in a pool. "Note the intense
poetic feeling he's put into this child's face, innocent,
virginal and yet withal the passion which would one day be
awakened when a lover came her way. Yes, it's a wonderful piece
of art."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's wonderful," agreed Penelope. "A pity the girl
couldn't always remain like that."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" laughed Mangan. "We all have to run one
predestined path and life would be very barren if it were all
promise and no fulfilment." He changed the conversation.
"Talking about wonders&mdash;what a wonderful old chap the old
lord is, even now as full of energy as I expect he was twenty
years ago. But then I expect he takes good care of himself! Does
he sleep soundly at night, do you know?" and he proceeded to ask
several more questions which seemed to suggest both to Penelope
and his lordship to whom she related the conversation later,
that he was trying to find out if he, Lord Delamarne, would be
hearing any movements about the Castle at night.</p>

<p>And that and the matter of the snap-shot were the only things
that kept suspicion alive in Lord Delamarne's mind until the
fourth evening of Major Mangan's visit to the Castle and then
the old lord got a nasty shock. He had no longer any doubt that
Mangan was working with the Baltic Embassy.</p>

<p>After dinner that evening the Major announced he had got a
bit of a headache and, as it was a fine night, would like to go
for a sharp walk. As an after-thought, he asked if he could
borrow a bicycle. Provided with a machine, he declined young
Avon's offer to accompany him, and promising to be back well
before eleven, the time when the Castle was closed for the
night, set off by himself.</p>

<p>Directly he had gone Lord Delamarne made a sign to Penelope
to follow him from the room. He looked very troubled. "Miss
Smith," he said sharply, "I believe he's gone to see those men
at the professor's bungalow. I want you to bicycle there to try
and find out. If you use the bye-roads it can't be more than
seven miles and you should do it in an hour. Do you mind
going?"</p>

<p>Penelope's heart beat very fast, but she replied
readily-enough, "Not at all, my lord. It will be very exciting."</p>

<p>"But, for Heaven's sake you mustn't let him see you," went on
his lordship quickly. "Remember, if he has gone there it is
proof he is an evil man." He hesitated a moment. "No, I don't
like sending you. It may mean real danger to you."</p>

<p>"But I don't mind," said Penelope grimly. "I'll risk it and
I'll dress myself so that if he does meet me on the road he
won't recognise me in passing. I'll put Joan's dark overalls
over my clothes and do up my head in a shawl. You see, he won't
be expecting anyone has followed him and so won't be
suspicious." She looked anxious. "But how can I get near the
bungalow without being seen? As well as I remember it's so open
all round."</p>

<p>"Approach it by the way he won't be going," said his
lordship, "by the way we came in the car the other day. Don't go
nearer than about fifty yards and hide with your bicycle among
the marsh grass at the side of the road. I'll give you a pair of
glasses to take with you and you can watch the bungalow through
them."</p>

<p>"And how long am I to wait there?" asked Penelope.</p>

<p>"Until about a quarter past ten," replied his lordship.
"He'll not dare to stay a minute later than that if he's to be
back here by eleven." The habitual sternness of his face for the
moment passed away and he went on hoarsely, "It's not a girl's
work I am giving you and Heaven forgive me if any harm comes to
you. Here&mdash;take this pistol of mine with you. Do you know
how to use it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've shot several times with Mr. Avon's," she nodded,
and she hoped he would not note the blush which had come into
her face.</p>

<p>"And if you're threatened," he said sharply, "don't hesitate
a second before you fire. You'll have the advantage there, for,
even if they recognise you, they won't expect you to be armed,"
and his last words were, "If you're not back within half an hour
of Major Mangan's return I'll come in the car to see what's
happened to you."</p>

<p>It was a thrilling ride for Penelope and she was panting far
more from excitement than from exercise when finally she and her
bicycle were hidden among the coarse high tussles of grass
within fifty yards of the bungalow. It was a beautiful still
night with a half moon showing and just a touch of frost in the
air. The sea was only a few yards from her and the lapping of
its waves and the cries of the marsh birds were the only sounds
that came to her ears. She thought how strange life was, all
peace and quiet and beauty about her and yet so near were
probably evil men upon whom in a few moments she might have to
try to inflict a dreadful form of death if her own safety was in
danger.</p>

<p>She could see light behind the drawn blinds of the windows of
the bungalow.</p>

<p>Five, ten minutes passed and she began to get impatient and
even disappointed that nothing was happening. Perhaps, it was
all a mistake! Those at the bungalow might be harmless and
innocent people and Major Mangan might not have come there at
all! Perhaps, everything was a mistake, with the Major being
harmless, too, and it being in no one's mind to break into the
Castle! Then she would have been sent upon a fool's errand and
had all her trouble and excitement for nothing!</p>

<p>She withstood her doubts for a few more minutes and then,
rising to her feet, proceeded to walk stealthily towards the
bungalow. The soft sand deadened all sounds of her
footsteps.</p>

<p>Arriving level with the bungalow, she heard men's voices
inside, and someone laughed. She looked round and then her heart
almost stopped beating as she saw a bicycle propped up against
the side of the bungalow. Hesitating a few moments, she was
about to return to her hiding-place when a thought struck her.
Greatly daring, she tiptoed up the short garden path and put her
hand upon the extinguished lamp on the bicycle. It was quite
warm, and so it's light could have been put out for only a very
few minutes. To add to the certainty that the bicycle was the
one that Major Mangan had been riding, she suddenly heard him
speaking in the bungalow.</p>

<p>A great fear of the danger she was in surged through her. She
remembered the warning Lord Delamarne had so recently given and
realised now he must have been keeping back so much of what he
knew. So if she were caught, these men of evil might shoot her
with the callousness they would a dog.</p>

<p>Then, too scared to stay to listen to what was being said in
the bungalow, she darted back on to the road. Turning to run to
where her bicycle was hidden, her eyes fell suddenly upon a
garage in the yard. It's doors were yawning wide and the moon
showed up clearly a big car just inside. It was jacked up in the
front and close near upon the ground lay a wheel and an inner
tube. The bonnet of the engine had been taken off and was
propped up against one of the doors. A number of tools were
scattered about upon a sheet of canvas spread upon the ground.
"So I'm all right there," she breathed, "Even if I'm seen they
can't follow me in that."</p>

<p>In a few seconds she was back in her hiding-place and her
watch had commenced again. Happily, however, it did not last
long this time, for very soon the door of the bungalow opened
and three men came out. Focussing her glasses upon them, though
really it wasn't necessary, she recognised one as Major Mangan
and another as the tall man with the horselike teeth whom she
had seen those few days back when she had been passing the
bungalow in Lord Delamarne's car.</p>

<p>Their voices came up clearly on the still frosty air. "Damn
you," she heard Mangan say angrily, "I was so reckoning upon
getting a lift back with my bicycle nearly all the way; I am so
sore and stiff now that the riding will be purgatory."</p>

<p>"Sorry, old man," laughed Captain Michaeloff, "but, as I say,
with the light in the garage gone bung, we can't do anything
more to the car until the morning. There are two or three hours
work to put everything right." He spoke sharply. "Now have you
taken everything in. You are just to do your little bit and then
fade out of the picture altogether. We can't have you coming
into the limelight as, if we meet with no success this time, we
may want you again."</p>

<p>Mangan rode off grumbling, sitting as lightly upon the saddle
as he could to ease the soreness brought on by his unaccustomed
riding on a bicycle. He was furiously angry.</p>

<p>And his feelings would have been far worse than those of
anger had he but heard what the two men were saying when they
were back in the bungalow! "After all, I've come not to trust
that fellow," scowled Captain Michaeloff, "and so we'll let him
know as little as we can. He'll get no blasted ten per cent
whatever happens. We'll make out we found nothing."</p>

<p>"I don't trust him, either," agreed the other. "He's just the
sort of chap to double-cross us and cut our throats if he gets
half a chance."</p>

<p>Mangan reached the Castle a few minutes before eleven
outwardly as smiling and good-humoured as ever, but inwardly in
a black rage and cursing deeply at his soreness.</p>

<p>Penelope was only just behind him and, indeed at the end of
the journey, had to slow down so that she should not overtake
him in the drive. Lord Delamarne listened to her story with a
dry mouth and most uncomfortable feeling of alarm. He expressed
his gratitude to her. "You've done splendidly, my dear," he said
warmly. He nodded significantly. "And I won't forget it."</p>

<p>The other three men were still playing cards and Mangan sat
down and joined in some poker. Seeing the coast was clear, Lord
Delamarne went into the cabinet and rang up Larose to whom he
related everything that had happened. The one-time detective was
quite cheerful about it.</p>

<p>"Now we know exactly where we are," he said, "and with any
luck we ought to be able to catch them all red-handed. From the
scrap of conversation your girl overheard they are evidently
quite confident of being able to get into the Castle. So it
evidently looks as if Mangan had found some way of
short-circuiting those electric alarms."</p>

<p>"But I could lock him in his room," said Lord Delamarne, "and
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that would be no good," said Larose instantly, "as it
would leave the whole matter in the doubtful condition it is now
and you wouldn't learn who were your enemies, and would have to
go on worrying all your life. No, let them actually get into the
Castle and we'll grab the Major at the same time and he'll get a
long sentence, too."</p>

<p>"Then we shall want plenty of help," said Lord Delamarne,
apparendy in no way alarmed by the grim prospect before him.</p>

<p>"Well you've got your nephew and the three men-servants,"
said Larose, "but don't say a word to any of them until the last
moment when we get them out of their beds."</p>

<p>"The blackguards are not likely to come tonight," said his
lordship, "with their car in the condition my secretary says it
is."</p>

<p>"No, and it may be in their minds, too," said Larose, "to
wait until these other two visitors of yours have gone away." He
hesitated a few moments. "But look here, Lord Delamarne, would
you rather call in the police and let them handle the whole
thing?"</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed his lordship at once. "I don't want that.
It would mean I would have to explain how it was I knew they
were coming, and too many questions would be asked, with too
much publicity all round."</p>

<p>"That's what I think," said Larose, "and we all ought to be
competent enough to manage the whole thing by ourselves. After
all, there'll be only three of them to deal with, and, taken
unawares, we should be able to down them easily. Then, when
they're all trussed up we'll call in the police."</p>

<p>"And when will you be coming over to the Castle?" asked Lord
Delamarne.</p>

<p>"Upon the tick of midnight," replied Larose, "I'll be waiting
outside the main door for you to let me in. I don't think for a
minute that these gentry will turn up before one or two, and
we'll give them no chance to put up a fight. In a way that'll be
rather a pity, for I'd dearly love a good excuse to use my gun,"
and Lord Delamarne came away from the phone thinking what a
blood-thirsty customer the one-time detective was.</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>

UNTIL THE MARSH GIVES UP ITS DEAD</h2>

<p class="first">THE next day was indeed a long one for the lord
of Blackarden and many, many times he wondered if all their
surmises would fall like a house of cards to the ground and the
dawn break on the morrow with nothing having happened. He
wondered the more that evening at dinner with the gallant major
at his best. The other two visitors having gone away that
morning, there were only five of them at the meal, and to young
Avon's secret annoyance, his friend paying his accustomed
attention to the ladies seemed yet to look at Penelope far more
than at anybody else.</p>

<p>Mangan was certainly in a happy frame of mind. The more he
thought about it the more he was pleased that all he had to do
in the forthcoming attempt to obtain possession of the jewels
was to get Captain Michaeloff and his companion into the castle.
Very doubtful that they would meet with the easy success they
were anticipating, he wanted to be mixed up in the whole
business as little as possible. Looking ahead to the time when
Avon would be lord of the castle and a plump pigeon to be
plucked, whether or not Michaeloff did manage to get hold of the
jewels, he was determined no suspicion should have fallen upon
himself.</p>

<p>So, with that end in view, he had made no effort to get into
the study with the key they had provided him and look for the
secret panel in the wall leading to the stairway. All he had
done was to make certain he had found the way to tamper
successfully with the alarm on the front door, and he was quite
sure he had got that all right.</p>

<p>The missing footman had undoubtedly been a highly skilled
electrician and following the instructions he had remitted to
the Embassy during his stay at the castle Mangan was now
provided with an ingenious little appliance into which the
electric current servicing the alarms could be temporarily
diverted, thus rendering unnecessary any cutting of the wires.
Thanks to an excellent blueprint of this appliance and the
photograph of the big alarm on the front door which he had so
cunningly obtained, Mangan was confident he knew exactly where
to fix the gadget. So all was satisfactory there, and directly
the other two conspirators were safely inside the castle he
would go back to his bedroom and, later, no one would have any
idea that he had ever come out of it.</p>

<p>Thinking things over, he continued to be the more and more
amused at the captain being so sure that, once down in the
vaults, he would be able to find what he wanted without any
trouble. Knowing Lord Delamarne to be a very shrewd and capable
old man, he did not for one moment imagine his lordship would
have just plumped down his treasures anywhere, perhaps in a
convenient suitcase all exposed to view and handy for the first
person to pick up when he came along. Rather, he thought they
would be in a hiding place even harder to locate than was the
entrance to the secret stairway in the study. The captain was so
confident, too, about this latter problem. To deal with any
difficulty there, he had said that his companion would be coming
all prepared, if necessary, to tear down the panels one by one
until they had found what they were wanting. He was of the
opinion that it would prove quite an easy matter.</p>

<p>Dinner over and with no one apparently keen on any cards, the
rest of the evening was passed in conversation and music. Soon
after eleven they all went to bed and long before midnight the
old castle was wrapped in slumber. At midnight, almost to the
minute, Larose was let into the big hall to find Lord Delamarne
and Penelope all ready for him.</p>

<p>"Everything all right?" he whispered.</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne nodded. "Yes, Mangan went up to his room a
long time ago and Miss Smith says he's put out his light. She is
going to wait here to call us if necessary while I take you down
below." He turned to Penelope. "I'll leave the panel open on the
chance that you may have to fetch us."</p>

<p>"But they won't come yet for an hour or two," said Larose,
"I'm pretty sure of that. The major is certain to have warned
them that you're a bit of a night bird and don't get to sleep
early."</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne led Larose into his study and showed him with
some pride his ingenious way of dealing with the oak panel. "I
am sure it would need a very imaginative person to think of this
catch in the drawer of my desk. Now we'll go down below. The
steps are quite easy though there are plenty of them."</p>

<p>In a couple of minutes or so Larose was gazing with not a
little awe down the long corridor with the score and more of
wide-open gaping dungeons opening into it. "Oh, what tales these
old walls could tell," he whispered, "if only they could speak!
What ghastly horrors they must have seen!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," nodded his lordship, "but I don't suppose
they've looked down upon more suffering than is going on in the
world to-day. With the passing of the years those Baltic friends
of ours are every bit as cruel and inhuman as were my ancestors
of those many generations back." He made a grimace. "I shouldn't
like to find myself in their hands to-day."</p>

<p>Larose was greatly intrigued with the comfortable little room
his lordship had built for himself among all the gruesome
surroundings, and he whistled when he noted the amount of
valuable silver it contained. "Whew! I don't wonder you're
afraid of being robbed. There would be a fine haul for anyone
here."</p>

<p>Upon his asking to see the well into which the body of the
footman had been dropped, his lordship took a coil of rope and a
small oil lantern out of a cupboard. "I keep these here," he
explained, "so that if by evil chance anyone ever succeeded in
getting down into these vaults he should not associate them with
the well and go lowering the lantern into it to see what's at
the bottom." He nodded. "I have tried to provide for
everything."</p>

<p>Making their way round to the well, his lordship lit the
lantern and lowered it down with the piece of rope. The water of
the so mysterious river was seen to be running swiftly, and from
the height at which they were looking down it seemed black as
ink. Lord Delamarne said, however, that when any of it was
brought up in a bucket it was always bright and clear.</p>

<p>"And is the water always running as swiftly as it is now?"
asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Always," replied his lordship, "and, as I have told you, it
appears to have been doing so for ever and ever. In my father's
and grandfather's times it was just the same."</p>

<p>"And now where have you got all those beautiful treasures
hidden away?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Returning to the main corridor, Lord Delamarne pointed to a
large paving flag at the foot of one of the massive walls.
"They're under that one," he said, "though from the closeness it
is set to the other flags you would never think it would lift up
quite easily. Still, it does." He pointed to another big flag
about ten feet away. "That is the key-stone one. You prise that
one up and then grope for a long iron rod. Push on that and this
stone comes up, though it's all that distance away. Good idea,
isn't it? I don't think anyone would tumble to it."</p>

<p>They were taking a last look into the little room where all
the beautiful silver articles were displayed, when, without a
second's warning, Larose was suddenly struck down on to the
ground by a vicious blow on the head, while at the same time
Lord Delamarne was seized roughly from behind and his arms
pinioned tightly to his sides. The attacks had avalanched so
quickly that neither of them had had the slightest chance of
defending himself.</p>

<p>"Now you, Larose, don't you start to get up," shouted a
vicious voice which Larose, even in his half-stunned condition,
to his intense mortification recognised as that of Captain
Michaeloff of the Baltic Embassy. "Don't move or I'll plug you
instantly," and blinking his eyes to clear them from the blood
which was trickling down from a cut in his forehead Larose saw
he was being covered by a pistol at a most unpleasantly close
range.</p>

<p>Then, still pointing his automatic at Larose, the captain
stepped back a few paces and grabbed at the length of rope which
Lord Delamarne had been using at the well. "Most handy!" he
jeered, and as quickly almost as it takes to tell the one-time
detective was effectively trussed up and propped against the
wall.</p>

<p>They were indeed agonising moments for Larose. It was not the
fear only of what might be coming for him that was making his
breathing painful and his mouth go dry. It was the bitter
humiliation at having allowed himself to be caught as he had
been and, above all, by the lying and treacherous attache of the
Baltic Embassy.</p>

<p>It was now the turn of Lord Delamarne who all the time had
been held tightly by the captain's companion. With the rope
knotted painfully round his wrists and ankles, he was propped up
by the side of Larose, and everything now secure Michaeloff took
out and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" he exclaimed, dropping into his ordinary tone of
voice. "It couldn't have gone off better! Everything made easy
for us, the secret panel left open, the lights all on and even
the piece of rope all handy for us to tie you both up!" He
laughed merrily. "Why, it is just as if you've been expecting us
and got everything ready."</p>

<p>His mood changed and he bent down over Larose, thrusting his
face very close to his. "And this comes of your interfering, you
poor boob of a policeman," he jeered. "I've no pity for you, as
you've deserved everything you're now going to get." He
pretended to be shocked. "But just fancy a clever fellow like
you letting yourself be caught like this!" He scowled angrily.
"Why didn't you keep your nose out of what was no business of
yours? First annoying a fine gentleman like Major Mangan and
now, no doubt, coming here to boss this old fool's affairs." He
shook his head. "I'm ashamed of you, Mr. Policeman Larose."</p>

<p>He turned his attention to Lord Delamarne. "Well, my lord,"
he said smilingly, "you've had a good run for your money, or
rather I should say, with other people's money, but the devil
has caught up with you at last and you've got to pay up all you
owe." His voice hardened angrily. "You miserable old wretch,
what have you done with the body of poor Ivan Menk"&mdash;he
bowed ironically&mdash;"I beg your pardon, I mean that of the
footman, Thomas. Got his body buried somewhere down here, of
course? Oh, you won't talk, eh? Well, I guess you'll be talking
quite a lot in a minute or two." He turned back to Larose. "And
you'll be talking, too, Mr. Policeman, when we're warming up
your fingers a bit."</p>

<p>He stopped speaking for a few moments and regarded the two
prisoners thoughtfully. "I think we'd better get down to
business at once," he said to his companion, "and we'll take the
old boy first."</p>

<p>He spoke very sternly. "Now, Lord Delamarne, no nonsense and
tell us without any bother where you're hiding what's left of
those crown jewels. You'll have to speak, man, and if you're
sensible about it when we've got what we want we may even let
you go free. It's different with the policeman here. He knows
too much and we'll have to put him to sleep. Now, Lord
Delamarne, are you or are you not going to tell us, without any
more persuasion, where those jewels are hidden? Come on. Make up
your mind. Quick!"</p>

<p>A long, dead silence followed and the vaults were very still.
The eyes of Lord Delamarne were burning like coals of fire, his
face was deathly pale and he was keeping his lips tightly shut.
The face of Larose was pale, too, and his forehead was pricked
out in little beads of sweat. His expression, however, was one
of calmness and he did not seem at all afraid.</p>

<p>"Very well then, my lord," snapped Michaeloff viciously. "If
you won't speak we'll have to make you." He took a box of
matches out of his pocket and nodded to his companion. "Hold his
hands quite still, Joseph, and push out one of his fingers.
We'll soon have him chattering like a monkey."</p>

<p>The captain moved up close to Lord Delamarne and, striking a
match, waited the few moments until it was burning brightly.
Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr>

<p>Now Captain Michaeloff would certainly not have been quite so
confident in his mocking at Larose for having landed himself
into such an humiliating and unescapable position had he then
but been aware exactly what had followed upon him, the captain,
being admitted into the castle by Mangan. His coming and that of
his companion had by no means been as unnoticed as he was so
imagining, and it had happened in this way.</p>

<p>Left alone in the darkness of the big lounge-hall to keep
watch until Lord Delamarne and Larose should return from the
vaults, Penelope had curled herself up comfortably upon a big
settee and, worn out by the excitement of everything, almost at
once dropped peacefully to sleep. It may be she would have been
more vigilant had not Larose been so confident in his assertion
that no one was likely to arrive for a good couple of hours. At
any rate she tried to excuse herself afterwards with the thought
that had there been any chance of an earlier arriving she would
certainly not have allowed herself to be so comfortable on the
settee, to say nothing of closing her eyes.</p>

<p>Her sleep was not a heavy one and, looking back later, she
thought it must have been the draught of cold air on the
stealthy opening of the hall door which disturbed her. At any
rate, she awoke suddenly to hear low voices close to her, and
opening her eyes to her dreadful horror saw Mangan and two other
men standing not a dozen feet from her.</p>

<p>"Now give me your key, major," whispered one of them sharply,
"and you go back to your room without an instant's waiting.
Whatever you may hear don't stir out of it," and in the dim
light she saw Mangan tiptoe off at once in the direction of the
other end of the castle where his room was. The two other men
disappeared along the corridor which led to Lord Delamarne's
study.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with shame that she had been so unfaithful to her
trust and trembling in every limb with terror at what she saw
was now happening, for a few moments Penelope continued to lie
as if spellbound where she was. Happily, however, the shock
passed quickly and, springing to her feet, she darted off after
the two men, just in time to see them let themselves into the
study.</p>

<p>"My God," she wailed, "and he was going to leave the panel
open for me! They'll go straight down and murder them!"</p>

<p>For the moment she stood in panicky hesitation not knowing
what she could do. Her heart was beating painfully and she
breathed only with difficulty. Then an inspiration came to her,
and taking to her heels she rushed pantingly up the wide
staircase leading to the upper floors. She would call Chester
Avon and take him down into the vaults! That the two men would
not stop at murder she was sure, but perhaps Chester would be
able to shoot them first! Then a horrible doubt seized her. She
did not think Chester a coward, but it always took time for him
to make up his mind. Well, she must make up his mind for him!
She must give him no time to think!</p>

<p>Letting herself quickly into Chester's room, which happily
was in a different wing from where the major's was, she closed
the door with frantic haste gently behind her and darted over to
the bed. With the moon shining through the windows, there was
plenty of light, and one glance showed her he was fast asleep.
She put her hand over his mouth and hissed sharply into his ear,
"Chester, wake up! Wake up at once!"</p>

<p>He was roused instantly. "Penelope, you little darling," he
exclaimed, and he caught hold of one of her arms.
"You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," she snapped. "Get up at once. There are
thieves in the castle and they've gone down into the vaults.
Your uncle and Gilbert Larose, the detective, are down there and
they'll be murdered if you're not quick."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" began Chester.</p>

<p>"Don't talk," she choked, "Don't wait for me to explain. I'll
tell you everything as we go along. Put on some clothes quick!
You're to come down into the vaults with me," and half lugging
him out of bed she threw his trousers and jacket at him.</p>

<p>With his wits still in something of a haze from his so sudden
an awakening from sleep, young Avon did as Penelope had ordered
and she saw to it that he did it quickly, too. "Now, where's
your pistol?" she asked, and he got it out of a drawer. "It's
not loaded, you say!" she exclaimed disgustedly. "Then load it,
quick!" but to her exasperation it was several minutes before he
could find the cartridges, which in his quickly rising
excitement he did remember having wrapped up in some pyjamas
because their cardboard container had broken. Finally, there was
more delay when, running down the corridor, Penelope dropped her
keys of the study door and it was quite an appreciable time
before they could pick it up by the light of the small torch
which she was carrying.</p>

<p>"But why haven't you fetched Major Mangan?" whispered Chester
as they were tremblingly making their way down the long stairway
leading to the vaults. "He'd be the very man for anything like
this. Why didn't you wake him up?"</p>

<p>"Because he's an evil man and is in this thieving, too,"
whispered back Penelope. "It was he whom I saw let these two
thieves into the castle, but he's gone back to his bedroom now
so as to pretend he's had nothing to do with it. Oh yes, your
uncle knows what he is and we've been watching him all the time
he's been here. But don't talk about him now. You'll hear
everything presently," and Chester was stunned to silence in his
amazement.</p>

<p>At last gaining the bottom of the stairway they saw the
corridor stretching long and dark before them, though where it
turned round the corner at its end they could see there was a
light burning. They could hear someone speaking. Their hearts
beat rapidly.</p>

<p>"Come on, quick!" whispered Penelope hoarsely. "Hold your
pistol ready and if you have to fire, fire instantly. Don't wait
to think. Do as I tell you."</p>

<p>They ran quickly forward, with Penelope gripping fiercely to
young Avon's arm. They could hear the same person speaking, with
him now breaking into a jeering laugh.</p>

<p>"Let go my arm," ordered Avon sharply. "I can't use my pistol
with you clinging to it."</p>

<p>Reaching the corner, they pulled up in a stride and peered
stealthily round. Penelope choked back a scream. There, only a
few yards away, the old lord and Larose were lying back bound
and helpless with the two men whom Mangan had let into the
castle standing menacingly over them. The men had got their
backs turned towards her.</p>

<p>She felt she was going to faint. But it could not be true,
she told herself. She was in the horrors of a dreadful dream and
would wake up presently to know it had been all unreal! Her
eyes, at first intent upon Lord Delamarne, wandered over to
Larose and it came to her suddenly that he had seen them and was
staring hard in their direction. Subconsciously she noted how
pale he was, though the expression on his face was yet calm and
untroubled. She thought even that he was half smiling. With a
start she came out of her dream. He was asking them for
help.</p>

<p>She glanced up quickly to Chester by her side, wondering
fearfully how at this supreme moment he was affected and at once
was filled with a most thankful relief. Certainly, she knew he
had never been particularly fond of his uncle, but to see now
the proud lord of the castle, the head of the Blackarden line,
being treated with such indignities and with his grim, old face
white as death, was undoubtedly rousing the boy to a savage
fury. Clenching his teeth tightly he raised his pistol arm, and
she saw that it was as steady as a rock.</p>

<p>Then at that moment she saw that while one of the men was
dragging forward Lord Delamarne's tightly-bound hands, the other
was striking a match.</p>

<p>"They're going to burn his fingers!" she choked to Avon.</p>

<p>"Quick! Quick! Shoot him! Aim at his head, and the other
one's too! Quick!"</p>

<p>The pistol cracked sharply and the senior attache of the
Baltic Embassy crashed to the ground. His companion turned as
quick as the strike of a snake, with his hand reaching for his
hip pocket, but the pistol cracked again and he went down with a
bullet between his eyes.</p>

<p>The acrid reek of cordite filled the air and a long, deep
silence fell upon the vaults. The wheel of fortune had turned so
quickly that for the moment no one there could take in what had
happened. Young Avon was trembling as if in a palsy, and his
widely-staring eyes were fixed with horror-struck intent on the
bodies of the men he had killed. The heads of both of them were
lying in pools of blood. One of the bodies was quite still, but
the other was kicking convulsively.</p>

<p>It was Larose who recovered first. "Splendid!" he called out
hoarsely. "Two magnificent shots!"</p>

<p>His voice aroused Avon like a douche of icy water and he
darted towards his uncle, but he tripped over Michaeloff's body
and measured his length heavily on the hard stone flags.
Instantly half springing to his feet, he sank down again with a
cry of pain. He had twisted his ankle under him.</p>

<p>So it was Penelope who was first by Lord Delamarne's side and
began with badly shaking hands to untie his bonds. "Good girl,"
his lordship whispered weakly. He smiled affectionately at his
nephew. "And good boy, too. I'm very proud of you."</p>

<p>"Splendid of them both," called out Larose gaily. He laughed
happily. "Oh, the thankfulness when I saw you both come round
that corner! I think it was the best moment of my life." He
nodded at Avon. "Two as pretty shots as I've seen, and I
congratulate you, young fellow. We are all proud of you."</p>

<p>In turn freed by Penelope from his bonds, Larose bent over
Avon to examine his foot. "A nasty fall," he exclaimed, as he
propped him up against the wall, "and don't try to get up again
for a few minutes." He turned to Penelope. "Are we safe for a
little while, do you think, young lady, from that devil of a
major?"</p>

<p>The reaction was now beginning to tell upon Penelope, and
white and very shaky-looking she sank down by the side of Lord
Delamarne, who was still unequal to getting up on his feet
again. "Yes, quite safe, I am sure, Mr. Larose," she said. "He
had a key of the study door from somewhere, but I saw him give
it up"&mdash;her voice choked as she threw a quick glance at the
body of Captain Michaeloff&mdash;"to that man there. So, as I
shut the study door before we came down here, he can't have
followed us," and she related brokenly everything that had
happened and how finally Mangan had been sent back to his
bedroom.</p>

<p>"And you don't think, my lord," asked Larose of Lord
Delamarne, "that the sound of that gun will have reached up into
the castle?"</p>

<p>Young Avon was now looking very sick. To the pain of his
injured ankle was now added something of remorse that he had
taken the lives of two men, and he was very near to breaking
down. "Oh, how dreadful it all is!" he exclaimed shakily.
"Still, no one could call it murder! I was quite justified in
shooting them, was I not?"</p>

<p>"Justified!" exclaimed Larose, as if in great astonishment at
such a question being asked. "I should just think you were! Why,
don't you realise that you saved both our lives?" He scowled.
"Far more than that even, as those beasts were going to torture
us before they killed us. You saw the lighted match they were
going to put to your uncle's fingers." He smiled approvingly.
"Yes, my boy, you did a very meritorious action in killing them
and no one would blame you."</p>

<p>"But what a business the police will make of it," said Avon,
looking the very picture of misery. "They'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Know nothing about it," interrupted Larose sharply. "If none
of us four here say anything, not a word of what's just happened
need ever come out. I shall take what remains of these wretches
away with me and hide them where they'll never be found. So no
one will ever learn anything." He turned to Lord Delamarne,
"That is your wish, is it not, my lord?"</p>

<p>Lord Dclamarne's colour had come back and he seemed almost
himself again. He understood what Larose meant. "Yes, that will
be best," he said. "If we keep our heads, there need be no
publicity."</p>

<p>"But Major Mangan will know," said Avon, looking very
puzzled. "Penelope has told us he let them into the castle and
knew where they were coming to get the silver here."</p>

<p>"And he'll think they got it," said Larose, "and have gone
away. Later, when he hears nothing more of them, he'll be the
most puzzled man in the world, but he'll never guess what has
happened. Of course, he won't dare to approach the police, as
that would incriminate himself." He turned again to Lord
Delamarne. "I understand this Mangan is leaving the castle in
the morning."</p>

<p>"Yes, directly after breakfast," nodded his lordship. He
smiled a grim smile. "And I shan't be about to bid him good-bye.
I'm not a good enough actor to trust myself to speak to
him."</p>

<p>"And your nephew mustn't see him either," said Larose
peremptorily. He smiled at Penelope. "This young lady must say
he's hurt his ankle so badly and is in such pain that he doesn't
want to speak to anybody. Now we'll take Mr. Avon straight up to
bed and Miss Smith will put a wet compress on his ankle and
remain with him until he feels more comfortable."</p>

<p>So, with Larose and Penelope supporting him, Avon was taken
up to his room and then Larose returned to Lord Delamarne.
"Really," he said, "things could hardly have gone better except
that we can't bring that vile Mangan in. He'll have to be
allowed to get off scot free again, though later he'll certainly
be in a dreadfully worried state of mind as to what has
happened. What will they be thinking, too, at the Embassy? By
gad, I'd like to see their faces when their senior attache
doesn't turn up." He regarded the two bodies thoughtfully.
"Well, I think we'd better search these departed gentlemen
before they go into your private graveyard."</p>

<p>The first thing Michaeloff's pocket yielded was a plan of the
ground floor of the castle. "Know that handwriting?" asked
Larose. "As was to be expected, Mangan's, of course! Oh, how the
case against him is proved up to the hilt! But oh, the devil,
that we can't make any move against him!"</p>

<p>Some few minutes later returning up into the castle, Larose
made ready to pick up his car which he had cached in a byroad
among some trees. "And their car will be about somewhere close
at hand, too, but of course in the direction of the way they
came to get here. So, to round off the whole business properly,
I'll have to look for it to-morrow as early as possible before
anyone else comes upon it. I'll take it a good many miles away
if we can't think how to get rid of it altogether."</p>

<p>In the big hall they inspected with great interest the little
appliance with which Mangan had short-circuited the wires on the
alarm on the front door. "No, we won't touch it," whispered
Larose, "for they must have arranged with Mangan for him to come
down and take it off before it gets light and, also, re-bolt the
front door. Unhappily, we shall never know all that was in their
minds, but it looks as if they were darned confident of getting
hold of the jewels without any difficulty. No, we mustn't let
Mangan have the slightest suspicion about anything, and as I say
he'll be the most puzzled man in the kingdom in the course of
the next few days."</p>

<p>Waving away his lord's thanks, he bade him good-bye with the
arrangement that he would return to the castle on the morrow as
soon as the coast was clear. "Get Miss Penelope to give me a
ring," he said, "directly that brute has gone away."</p>

<p>So the grim old castle soon sank into silence again, though
for four of its inmates, as can be well imagined, there was
little sleep that night. His lordship was not unduly troubled,
and was thinking most how he could adequately repay the three
persons who had been of such service to him. Penelope's thoughts
were of Chester Avon, how bravely he had responded to her urging
and whether, with the great secret now between them, he would
want her to become his wife. The old lord, she was sure, could
induce him to do anything he, the old lord, wanted. Chester
himself was giving little thought to Penelope. His ankle was
hurting him far too much, and the remembrance that he had killed
two men was very distressing to him.</p>

<p>As for Mangan, his great anxiety was that he would fall
asleep and not awaken in time to remove the little appliance on
the alarm before the servants were about. Keeping himself awake
with some difficulty, he got out of bed with a curse just before
five and went down into the hall to attend to it. He had given
them time enough, he told himself, and if the alarm <i>did</i>
go off when they let themselves out of the castle, then they
would have to make the best of things and get away quickly. At
any rate, he had done all that had been asked of him.</p>

<p>Returning to his room, he got two hours and more of sound
sleep before the first breakfast gong awakened him. He dressed
and packed hurriedly, glad to think that if anything had been
taken from the vaults he would be well away before the loss had
been discovered. Whatever had happened he was quite confident
the old lord would never have the slightest suspicion of
him.</p>

<p>Sitting down to breakfast, at first Penelope was the only
other one there and he thought she was looking rather tired and
pale. However, she was just as bright and animated as usual, and
told a harrowing tale of poor Chester slipping on the stairs the
previous night and hurting his ankle badly. He had had no sleep
all night, she said, but had now dropped off to sleep and was
not to be disturbed.</p>

<p>Mangan made out how sorry he was and, indeed, looked so
troubled that Penelope would dearly have liked to slap his face
for his hypocrisy. However, she smiled sweetly and promised to
give Chester his condolences directly he awoke.</p>

<p>At that moment Joan appeared and, having made her apologies
for being late, turned to Penelope and began reproving her in
mock severity for some pieces of mud she had just found on the
carpet in the study. "They must have come off your shoes," she
said, "as I know father didn't go outside all yesterday to get
his feet dirty, and he and you were the only ones to be in the
study all day."</p>

<p>"But I'm sure I couldn't have been so careless," began
Penelope indignantly. "I&mdash;" but, it flashed into her mind
who it must have been who had brought the mud in, she stopped
speaking and coloured up in her sudden embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Ah, I don't wonder you are now looking ashamed of yourself,"
laughed Joan. "You are a careless girl." She explained to
Mangan, "You see, major, father is always so fussy about this
old study of his that only one particular housemaid and I are
allowed in there to tidy and clean it up. We've just been doing
it and that's how I've come to find Penelope out. She ought to
be punished; now oughtn't she?"</p>

<p>It was with difficulty Mangan could find appropriate words to
express his agreement with what she had said, as idea upon idea
was rushing into his mind and he was thinking that he could now
see with something like clearness exactly what had happened
during the preceding night. Michaeloff had found the crown
jewels and got away with them in safety! What else could it all
mean?</p>

<p>Mud upon the study carpet! Then it had been Michaeloff and
the other man who had carried it there! And nothing else unusual
had been noticed in the study as it had been swept and tidied
this morning! No broken panels in the wall and no appearance of
anything having been disturbed! Everything quite orderly! Then,
of course, it would only be that the search had been successful,
and everything had gone off quickly and smoothly.</p>

<p>The meal over and Mangan's good-byes said, he could not get
on his way to the bungalow speedily enough. For the moment he
was putting out of his mind the thought that any attempt would
be made to cheat him out of his share of the treasure. Of
course, he told himself, those at the Embassy would be realising
he was too dangerous a man to double-cross in any way, and so he
thrilled at the idea that in such a few minutes now he would be
feasting his eyes upon what at one time had adorned the persons
of the great beauties of the Russian Court.</p>

<p>However, at length arriving at the bungalow, he received a
terrible shock and all his so-rosy expectations went crashing to
the ground.</p>

<p>The bungalow was locked up and there was no one there!</p>

<p>For a few moments he could not take it in and stood
speechless in his astonishment and dismay. Surely Michaeloff
would not have dared to treat him like this? He had known he was
coming and knew, too, that he had to wait for him!</p>

<p>Striding round to the garage he found the door there was
locked, too, and looking through the cracks he saw there was no
car there. He swore savagely. Then that cursed Michaeloff had
dared! He was treating him as if he were his servant and, by
hell, he'd make him pay for it!</p>

<p>Throwing himself into his car with his face as black as
thunder, he started on his long journey back to Town.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>

THE GODDESS OF VENGEANCE</h2>

<p class="first">LAROSE WAS round at the castle within half an
hour of Penelope's message that the coast was all clear and
quickly engaged in a most earnest conversation with Lord
Delamarne.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking, my lord," he said, "that although
we've finished with about the worst man at the Baltic Embassy
you're still not out of danger, and the sword will continue to
hang over you. Of course, the Embassy people will be profoundly
mystified with the disappearance of those two men, but it's not
likely to put them off coming after those jewels again. Rather,
I should say, they'll be more certain than ever that they were
right in their conjectures and that you've got them hidden
here."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of that, too," said Lord Delamarne, "and
so am going to put everything into the care of my bank, of
course under seal so that they won't know what they are keeping
for me."</p>

<p>"But you can't drop the Embassy a postcard," smiled Larose,
"telling them what you've done. You can't broadcast your
valuables are no longer here, and the stakes are so high that
the Baltic crowd certainly won't let the matter drop."</p>

<p>"But what can I do?" asked his lordship, looking very
troubled. "I don't see that I can do anything."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you can," said Larose, "and I've thought of a good
way of shaking them off, if you're game enough to do it." He
spoke impressively. "You must have a fire down in those vaults
and make out you've lost all your valuable silver collection.
You must broadcast that the vaults have been gutted."</p>

<p>His lordship frowned. "But that would mean I could never make
any more use of the vaults," he said.</p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't," said Larose, "for you could confine the
fire to exactly where you wanted it. There's only all that dried
woodwork which would burn, and the fire couldn't spread up to
the castle."</p>

<p>"It certainly couldn't do that," agreed his lordship. "The
ceiling of the vaults is all stonework and above that there must
be nearly sixty feet of earth baked as hard as cement before you
come to the floors of the castle itself."</p>

<p>"But if you do it," said Larose, "you must make a thorough
job of it and give out that the best part of your silver has
gone. A great hullabaloo must be made, so that it gets plenty of
publicity. Well, you think over the idea and, if you approve of
it, I'll help you to carry it out."</p>

<p>He turned the conversation and spoke very seriously. "Now
about the shooting of those two men and getting rid of the
bodies in the way we have done&mdash;as far as I can see there
is only one danger of discovery and that may possibly
come"&mdash;he eyed his lordship intently&mdash;"from your
nephew, young Avon."</p>

<p>"But <i>he</i> won't say anything," said his lordship
instantly. "He'd be the last one to speak. You must have seen
for yourself how dreadfully upset he was last night."</p>

<p>"I did," nodded Larose, "and that I think is the danger. He's
got plenty of courage, but remember he's only a boy and a very
sensitive one at that. Probably he's never actually killed
anyone before, and now to have taken two lives himself may prey
upon his mind and make him become morbid. It'll be continually
in his thoughts and he'll dwell and dwell on it and, perhaps one
day in a remorseful mood, even blurt it out to some sympathetic
stranger."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think he'd ever do that," said his lordship
quickly. "He's got sense enough to realise how terrible for us
all the consequences would be."</p>

<p>"But conscience is a strange thing, my lord," said Larose
very solemnly, "and in some people may almost take on a
condition of disease. Then they become weak as water and take no
thought of consequences. All they think of is to bring ease to
their minds by confiding their troubles to someone." He smiled.
"However, with your nephew we can prevent all chance of that by
altering his whole way of life for him and giving him something
else to think of." He spoke apologetically. "Forgive my
interference, my lord," he hesitated just a moment, "but what
about marrying him to that pretty secretary of yours?"</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne's face was almost without expression, except
that he was now staring hard at Larose. The latter went on
quickly, "Overlook her not being in the same social class as she
is, for she is a girl of fine character and, as we saw last
night, of good courage too. She'd be just the very one, so to
speak, to take possession of his mind and order his way of life
for him." He lowered his voice darkly. "Besides, as his wife she
could never be asked to give evidence against him. Now what do
you think about it?"</p>

<p>His lordship spoke almost casually. "I have already
considered the matter, Mr. Larose," he replied. His face broke
into an amused smile. "With the result that I have decided they
are to be married practically straight away. As you say, the boy
needs looking after, and I agree with you that my secretary will
be the one to do it properly."</p>

<p>"Good, very good, my lord," exclaimed Larose, his face all
smiles. "Are they interested in each other, do you know?"</p>

<p>"Well, they've exchanged kisses in the conservatory," said
his lordship. "They didn't know I saw them, but I did, and so we
may assume they were not physically distasteful to each other.
Besides," and he spoke dryly, "Miss Penelope Smith is a young
lady who will always love rather with her head than with her
heart. So, if she's not an ardent mistress to him, at least
she'll be a good mother."</p>

<p>"But she'll be more than that," said Larose. "He's a
good-looking young fellow and she's nothing of a cold type of
woman." He laughed. "You see if they don't supply you with a good
line of heirs and heiresses in a very short time." He spoke briskly.
"Now I've got the car key I took out of Michaeloff's pocket, so
if you'll lend me a bicycle I'll go out and find the car. I'll
have to drive it a good way away, as it had better not be found
anywhere near here."</p>

<p>He went off to look for it and, rather to his lordship's
anxiety, did not return until the afternoon was far advanced. He
was looking very pleased with himself. "I've made a real good
job of it," he smiled. "I found it easily enough in that little
lane that turns off about a couple of hundred yards from the
gates, and drove it a good twenty miles away where it now lies
hidden under six or seven feet of water in a pool in a disused
quarry off the Fakenham-Swaffham road. It may not be found for
years and years."</p>

<p>His lordship looked very relieved. "But what a long way to
have taken it!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the ride back on the bicycle," said Larose, "has
made me pretty stiff, I can tell you." He laughed happily. "But
it was a pleasant ride for all that, as I was chuckling all the
time thinking of the puzzle that blessed Embassy'll be in. No
captain, no other blackguard, no crown jewels, and no car! What
the devil will they imagine can have happened?" He nodded. "They
may even be suspicious of that precious major, thinking perhaps
that he's double-crossed them and, bumping off the other two,
vamoosed with jewels, car and everything."</p>

<p>"You took off the number plates, of course?" asked Lord
Delamarne.</p>

<p>"Yes, and buried them a long way from the quarry," said
Larose, "in a wood. Also the number of the engine is filed off.
So we're all right there, too."</p>

<p>Lord Delamarne began again to express his gratitude to
Larose, but the latter at once cut him short. "It's all been a
great pleasure to me," he laughed, "an adventure upon which I
shall always look back upon in happy remembrance. You know, they
used to say at the Yard that in reality I was as big a criminal
as any I'd sent to the seven-foot drop."</p>

<p>His lordship laughed back. "And I suppose that if everything
were known they'd consider me a bad criminal, too." He shrugged
his shoulders. "But I'm quite a law-abiding old man if people
only leave me alone."</p>

<p>With Larose having left the castle, Lord Delamarne went up to
his nephew's room. The boy's ankle was very swollen, and it was
evident he would have to lie up for several days. His uncle told
him Larose had hidden the bodies where they could never be
found.</p>

<p>"So you can put the whole thing out of your mind," he said,
"and forget it as if it had never happened." He went on a tone
kinder, so the boy thought, than he had ever used to him before,
"I'm very proud of you, Chester. You played a man's part last
night and for reward I'm going to make you a very handsome
present."</p>

<p>Chester got very red. "But it was really all due to
Penelope," he said. "She arranged everything. She urged me on,
and but for her"&mdash;he looked uncomfortable&mdash;"I confess
I might never have dared to shoot them." He brightened up. "So
she deserves the reward more than anyone, sir."</p>

<p>His lordship nodded. "I am most grateful to you both and she
is going to share the reward with you. It is going to be a joint
one."</p>

<p>Chester looked very puzzled. "And what will it be, sir?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"A wedding breakfast," smiled his lordship, "after you've
become man and wife in the chapel here. You are to ask her to
marry you."</p>

<p>Chester was furiously red now. "You&mdash;you wish me to ask
her, sir?" he said stammeringly. He shook his head. "But I don't
think she'll want to. She's told me more than once that I'm not
interesting enough for her to fall in love with."</p>

<p>"Well, you propose to her properly," said his lordship, "and
I'm sure it will be all right." He smiled his old grim smile. "I
think it was only me she was afraid of. She's a good girl and
would not like to cross my wishes in any way."</p>

<p>He prepared to leave the room. "I'll send her up to have a
talk with you."</p>

<p>He found Penelope in the office typing some letters. "My
nephew is asking for you, Penelope," he said. "So you'd better
go up and see what he wants." He patted her upon the shoulder.
"I shall always call you Penelope now, as you're one of the
family."</p>

<p>Penelope coloured up hotly. There was no mistaking the
kindness of his words and her heart beat painfully.</p>

<p>"Very well, my lord," she said, steadying her voice with an
effort. "But don't forget you said these letters must be
answered to-day. So I won't be gone for long."</p>

<p>However, it was nearly half an hour before she returned, and
she stood before him a very flushed and nervous young woman.</p>

<p>"Well, did he tell you what he wanted?" he asked slyly.</p>

<p>"But it is all your doing, my lord," she choked. Her eyes
filled with tears. "And now that he says he is fond enough of me
to want to marry me, I feel such a mean cheap thing, as I
started to lead him on almost only as a sort of joke. I wasn't
the least bit in love with him."</p>

<p>"But you like him, don't you?" asked his lordship
sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, very much," she replied instantly, "and after last
night"&mdash;she hesitated just a moment&mdash;"if it isn't love
I have for him, it's a great tenderness. He relied so much upon
me then that I feel he needs someone like me to take care of
him."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, then don't doubt yourself any more," said his
lordship testily. "I know you'll make him an excellent wife and
I am very pleased you made him fond of you." He patted her on
the shoulder again. "You're a good girl, Penelope, and I don't
think you're quite all the little schemer you want to make out
you are."</p>

<p>Penelope heaved a big sigh, half in joke and half in earnest.
"But, my lord," she said as if very regretfully, "now I am an
adventuress no longer."</p>

<p>"And you've no need to be," he smiled. "So you can just
prepare yourself to settle down into the ordinary humdrum
married life." He shrugged his shoulders. "And if, at any rate,
it is partly my doing, I am quite honest in saying that I have
never done anything with more pleasure in all my life." He
pretended to frown. "Now, please, Miss Smith, will you get on
with these letters at once."</p>

<p>In the next few ensuing weeks things moved very quickly in
Blackarden Castle. With the speedy bricking up again of the
broad way leading down to the vaults, the grisly secret that
they held seemed to have passed altogether out of the minds of
both Penelope and Chester Avon and no longer troubled them.</p>

<p>To Penelope, as the affianced wife of his heir and destined
to carry on the Blackarden line, the old lord was now according
a great respect, not unmixed in his grim stern way with real
affection. That he was most grateful to her she was well aware,
though it was with considerable hesitation that she accepted
from him a generous cheque to provide herself with a
trousseau.</p>

<p>Young Avon was in the seventh heaven of happiness and with
Penelope regarding him with ever-mounting affection he blossomed
out, even under his uncle's stern unsmiling eyes, as a young man
of spirit, very different from the one-time shy and timid boy.
In due time the wedding was celebrated very quietly in the
castle chapel where for six hundred years and more the lords of
Blackarden and their heirs had received the marriage sacrament,
and they set off for a month's honeymoon in Devonshire and
Cornwall.</p>

<hr>

<p>We must now go back to the day following on the night of
those momentous happenings in the castle vaults, when Mangan had
returned to Town in such an evil temper because, as he was
imagining, Captain Michaeloff had left the bungalow by the sea
without waiting for him.</p>

<p>All that evening he remained at home in his flat in Fitzroy
Square, confidently expecting that the very least the captain
would do was to give him a ring and inform him exactly what had
happened the previous night in the vaults of Blackarden Castle.
However, to his mounting anger no ring came and, having waited
until nine o'clock, he rang up the Embassy himself.</p>

<p>A girl answered the phone and said Captain Michaeloff was
away from Town and it was not known when he would return. Asking
who it was who was wanting him, Mangan replied curtly, "Mr.
Smith." The following morning he rang up again. The same girl
answered the phone and as before said that the captain was away.
Ringing yet again the afternoon, Mangan received the same
answer. That evening for the fourth time he rang up. "Oh, it's
you, is it, Mr. Smith?" said the girl at once. "Then I have a
message for you. Will you please call here to-night at nine
o'clock," and Mangan replied sharply that he would.</p>

<p>By this time he had worked himself up into a state of fury at
the offhand way in which he considered he was being treated. As
he had received no information from the captain that the search
for the jewels had been an unsuccessful one, he was taking it
for granted that they had been found, and with no one ringing up
to tell him that was so was of the opinion that the prospect of
his getting his agreed share did not look at all rosy. Quite
likely, he told himself, having got all the help out of him that
they had wanted, they were now intending, with some excuse, to
freeze him out altogether and give him nothing.</p>

<p>He swore savagely. Well, he would show them pretty quickly he
was by no means the sort of man who could be treated like
that!</p>

<p>So it was in the worst of humours that he arrived at the
Embassy at nine o'clock. Declining curtly to give his name to
the footman who answered the door, he just said he had an
appointment with Captain Michaeloff.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir," said the footman at once. "Will you please
come this way," and he was shown into a room different from that
into which he had been accustomed to go when visiting Captain
Michaeloff. There was no one in the room, but almost immediately
a soldierly-looking man in evening clothes appeared and closed
the door very carefully behind him. He bowed coldly to Mangan,
and did not offer to shake hands.</p>

<p>"Major Mangan?" he asked. "I am General Volgorod," and Mangan
knew he was in the presence of His Excellency the
Ambassador.</p>

<p>A short silence followed, with the two men regarding each
other intently. Then the Ambassador asked frowningly, "You've
come with news of Captain Michaeloff?"</p>

<p>Mangan scowled. He was by no means awed by the Ambassador and
as firm as ever in his resolve to stand no nonsense. "I've
come," he said sharply, "to know why he has not communicated
with me. Yesterday and to-day I rang up three times, to be told
each time that he was not in Town. Then to-night, not an hour
ago, I was given to understand he would see me if I came here at
nine o'clock."</p>

<p>The Ambassador's frown deepened. "But, but," he said, equally
as sharply, "it is from you I am expecting to receive the news
of him. We have heard nothing since he left London five days
ago. We are getting very anxious. We don't know what can have
happened to him."</p>

<p>Mangan was sure he was lying and that it was all part of the
plan to put him off from his share of the jewels. "But, of
course, you must have heard from him," he said angrily. "Those
three nights ago I let him into Blackarden Castle and the
following morning when I called round at the bungalow I saw that
he and his car had gone."</p>

<p>In his anxiety the Ambassador ignored Mangan's rude and
disrespectful manner. "Then he can't have gone back there at
all," he said earnestly. He threw out his hands. "This morning I
sent one of my officers the long journey to that bungalow and he
got back only a few minutes before you rang up to-night. He
found the place shut up, as you tell me you did, but he got in
through a window and saw that to all appearances no one had been
in the place for some days. He says all the food was either
stale or had gone bad, and all the cakes of soap in the rooms
were hard and dry." He looked very troubled. "Now what has
happened, Major Mangan? You must be able to tell us
something."</p>

<p>Mangan did not make any reply. He stared harder than ever at
the Ambassador. The latter went on persuasively, "Come, you can
speak quite frankly, Major Mangan. Of course, I know what they
were looking for in the castle and the part you were going to
play to help them. So you need keep nothing back."</p>

<p>"I am not keeping anything back," replied Mangan in a surly
tone. "I know nothing I <i>can</i> keep back."</p>

<p>"But tell me," went on the Ambassador, "what happened after
you had let, as you say, Captain Michaeloff and the man with him
into the castle?"</p>

<p>The Ambassador appeared to be so really troubled that for the
moment Mangan's suspicions had in part died down.</p>

<p>"That's what I want to know," he said sharply. "I saw them
safely into the castle and then, on the captain's insistence,
went back up into my room."</p>

<p>"And you heard no disturbance during the night?" asked the
Ambassador. "Well, what happened the next morning?"</p>

<p>"Nothing happened," said Mangan. "Everything was just the
same as usual. I had my breakfast with one of Lord Delamarne's
daughter and his secretary, and evidently nothing was upsetting
them. And it was the same to-day when I rang up the castle to
know how Lieutenant Avon was, as he had sprained his ankle. The
daughter answered the phone and she was as chatty and friendly
as could be."</p>

<p>The Ambassador looked most perplexed. "Then what has
happened?" he asked. "Two men and a car can't disappear without
leaving any trace."</p>

<p>"Of course, they can't," snapped Mangan, whose suspicions for
some reason were now beginning to come back. He eyed the
Ambassador intently. "You've approached the police, haven't you,
to tell them an Embassy car is missing?"</p>

<p>"How could we?" asked the Ambassador sharply, as if surprised
at the question being put. "You know perfectly well that, under
the peculiar circumstances, we dare not face any publicity and
make any attempt to trace it?"</p>

<p>"And Captain Michaeloff at the wheel would be quite aware of
that, wouldn't he?" asked Mangan dryly. "He would know there
would be no danger of his being followed." He spoke with a sneer
that was only half veiled. "Then has it never struck you, your
Excellency, that, having now obtained possession of those
valuable jewels, the captain may possibly have gone off on an
extended holiday to enjoy the proceeds of their sale for
himself?"</p>

<p>The Ambassador bristled in rage. "To anyone knowing Captain
Michaeloff," he snarled, "such an idea would occur only to the
man of a treacherous mind himself." He glared angrily at Mangan.
"Captain Michaeloff was the soul of honour, sir, and one of the
most trusted officers we have."</p>

<p>Mangan shrugged his shoulders. "Well, the whole business
seems devilish suspicious to me and I tell you that straight. It
looks uncommonly like an excuse to avoid paying me the share I
was promised."</p>

<p>The Ambassador's face went black as thunder, but his only
answer was to push viciously on the bell and, the footman
appearing, he said quietly, "Show this gentleman out," and
Mangan took his departure with an ironical bow.</p>

<p>The now very worried Ambassador at once summoned the attache
who was next to Captain Michaeloff in importance at the Embassy,
and related to him everything that had taken place.</p>

<p>"But I wouldn't trust that fellow a yard," he said gloomily.
"I am sure he was telling me a whole tissue of lies and it makes
things look very black for Michaeloff and Joseph. I believe he
betrayed everything to Lord Delamarne, and they took them by
surprise and did away with them somehow." His voice shook. "We
shall find they have disappeared just like that other poor
fellow did. We shall hear nothing of them again."</p>

<p>"But their bodies must be hidden somewhere," said the attache
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, but if they're not buried in those vaults," said the
ambassador with a deep sigh, "how easy to have weighted them and
buried them out to sea at night. Remember how resourceful that
Major was when he was fighting with the patriots in France. We
know he wouldn't hesitate at anything and don't forget the sea
is not far away from Blackarden Castle."</p>

<p>"Well, we can always give him a taste of his own medicine,"
said the attache savagely. "It's a poor consolation, I know, but
he certainly mustn't be allowed to go off unpunished. Remember
we know a great deal more about him and his way of life than he
can dream of, and we can easily catch him alone somewhere where
the whole thing will be quite safe. The captain was very
thorough in finding out everything possible about him before we
asked him to help us. So just say the word and I'll put Boehm on
to him at once."</p>

<p>"But we'll wait a little while," said the ambassador, "on the
chance, the very slender one I am afraid, that some news may yet
come in." He passed his hand over his forehead. "This has been a
terrible shock."</p>

<p>And if His Excellency had received one shock, he was speedily
going to receive another, as the following morning the
newspapers were all featuring a devastating fire which had
occurred in Blackarden Castle.</p>

<br>

<p class="headline">HISTORIC SEVEN-HUNDRED-YEAR OLD CASTLE IN DANGER</p>

<p class="cp">ran the headlines,</p>

<br>

<p class="headline">
THE VAULTS AND UNDERGROUND PARTS<br>
OF BLACKARDEN CASTLE GUTTED BY FIRE</p>

<p class="headline">
LORD DELAMARNE LOSES HIS<br>
PRICELESS COLLECTION OF OLD SILVER</p>

<br>

<p>It appeared that the previous afternoon dense clouds of black
smoke had suddenly been seen issuing from the Castle chimneys
and, with no accounting for them from any fire within the
habited part of the Castle, it was at once realised that the
conflagration must be coming from the underground vaults, the
broad stairway down to which had been bricked off nearly a
hundred years ago, leaving only a narrow, and to most people an
unknown and secret one, leading up into Lord Delamarne's
study.</p>

<p>"The Fire Brigade from Norwich was soon upon the scene," went
on one of the papers, "and the brick wall forbidding access to
the dungeons was at once battered down to get at the flames
below where a great quantity of very dry woodwork was burning
furiously. Happily, the conflagration being so far below, it
could not travel up to the Castle itself and was quickly
mastered. However, it is understood that Lord Delamarne has lost
all his valuable collection of old silver, which for safety had
been stored in a room he had fitted up for himself among the
vaults. It is believed the fire originated in a fault in the
electric light system his lordship had recently installed."</p>

<p>"And that means, too," sighed the Baltic ambassador, "that
the Crown jewels have gone for ever. What a calamity, as there
must have been millions of pounds worth still there!"</p>

<p>Of course, Mangan had read all about the fire, and he thought
it gave him a splendid excuse for motoring down to the Castle at
the week-end, not only to sympathise with his lordship, but to
see how young Avon was getting on, as well. He was hoping, too,
that he might be able to determine from Lord Delamarne's manner
if any great calamity, such as the loss of the Crown jewels, had
happened to him. He thought, also, that a little tactful pumping
of the pretty secretary might tell him something. Undoubtedly,
she would be more or less in his lordship's confidence.</p>

<p>Joan answered the phone and had just started to tell him
about the fire when she broke off suddenly and said, "But Miss
Smith is here and she says she has something very important to
say to you."</p>

<p>Penelope spoke in a business-like and matter of fact way, at
once cutting short his starting to speak about the fire. "Never
mind about that," she said sharply. "I want to speak to you
about something else, and I should have rung you up today if you
hadn't come on the phone now." Her tone of voice was most
decisive. "I have to tell you, Major Mangan, that I have become
engaged to Mr. Avon and, as his future wife, it is my wish that
the friendship between him and you should cease at once."</p>

<p>Mangan could not believe his cars. "What, what did you say?"
he asked, with his eyes screwed up in his perplexity.</p>

<p>"You heard quite well," returned Penelope coldly. "It is my
wish and Lord Delamarne's as well, he bids me expressly to tell
you so, that you should hold no more communications with any of
us, no phoning, no writing and no more visiting here. I can't
put it plainer than that."</p>

<p>Mangan's voice was harsh in his fury and amazement. "But I
demand some explanation," he began, "and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Penelope interrupted calmly. "The only explanation I shall
give you," she said, "is that before coming here I was a
journalist for some years and learnt enough about your way of
living then to be quite sure your continued friendship with Mr.
Avon is not to his best interests. Good morning, Major Mangan,"
and the telephone went dead.</p>

<p>Mangan's mouth was very dry and his face was black in anger.
Never had he been so insulted before! What did it really mean,
too? Had they come to learn anything of the part he had played
that night at the Castle, or had they heard anything of the
accusations the police had brought against him in connection
with Professor Glenowen's death? No, he didn't think he need
consider either of those contingencies. It was probably only
that the little&mdash;&mdash;, he called her a bad word, having
been successful in trapping that weak young fool, Avon, into a
promise of marriage, was jealous of his, Mangan's, influence
over him, and so had poisoned the old lord's mind with some bits
of scandal which, as a journalist, she had picked up about the
money he was supposed to have won at cards. Yes, that was what
it was! It was humiliating as well as annoying, but for the
moment he could think of no practical way of venting his spite
upon them.</p>

<p>So, as far as possible he put it all out of his mind, as he
had plenty of other things to worry him. Trade had been bad in
the art world and, knowing the police were now watching every
step he took there, he had had to give up, at any rate for the
time being, the most lucrative side of his business. He dared no
longer to act as a fence, and had reluctantly refused many what
would have been very profitable purchases. Added to that, he had
been losing heavily at the races. Upon one wretched animal alone
he had dropped over a thousand pounds. Altogether, things were
in a bad way with him and, to keep his head above water, he saw
he must soon dip into some of that money he had buried in his
shack on Canvey Island. The idea of doing that frightened him,
as he had not dared to go near the place since the morning he
had placed the money he had taken from the Professor's safe
there. He was always so fearful that the police had devised some
subtle way of trailing him, exactly as they had once succeeded
in following him to his flat.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, if the police might have lost some of their
interest in his doings, those at the Baltic Embassy had
certainly not. Ten days having now passed with no news of their
two missing men, they were regarding with sinister significance
that Mangan had made no further enquiries at the Embassy as to
whether they had heard anything more of them.</p>

<p>"There is no need for him to enquire," scoffed the Ambassador
to the second attache who had now stepped into Captain
Michaeloff's place. "He knows what's happened to them and, no
doubt by now, has been well rewarded for his treachery. With his
record as a killer to be hired well known to us, we were foolish
to have trusted him. Yes, we'll put Boehm on to him at once, but
we must be sure to find some place where he can be dealt with so
that it'll look as if robbery were the only motive for what has
happened."</p>

<p>And, in their judgment, the ideal place was found when it was
learnt that Mangan had a bungalow upon Canvey Island, at certain
unseasonable times as lonely a place as any assassin could wish
for, and occasionally went down there at weekends. The knowledge
came to them in this way.</p>

<p>When those at the Baltic Embassy became interested in anyone,
either in a friendly or unfriendly way, it was their custom to
find out everything they could about him and tabulate it for
future reference. Nothing was too insignificant to put down, the
man's friends and acquaintances, his habits and likes and
dislikes, his recreations, and even matters of slight interest
that he might have dropped in the course of conversation.</p>

<p>So, when upon one occasion Michaeloff and Mangan had been
talking together, the latter had happened to mention that his
watch had taken to stopping every now and then because one week
sand must have got into it when he had forgotten it and left it
on Canvey Island, the captain had put down in the memorandum
that Mangan had got a bungalow there to which he went
occasionally upon Saturdays and Sundays. The information was
added that he used to spear eels in the dykes about the island
and that he had stated the only drawback to his enjoyment was
that his bungalow was so close to the high sea-wall surrounding
the island that nothing could be seen from its windows of the
ships passing up and down the Estuary. Still, the compensation
was that it was very near to a hotel where a drink or good meal
could be obtained should he want either of them. The captain had
put down, too, that, with Mangan's reputation as a dealer in
stolen goods, it was not improbable that in that bungalow he
might, from time to time, hide things that he did not want the
police to know anything about.</p>

<p>All this information, gone carefully through, was passed on
to one of the many secret agents of the Embassy, a one-time
follower of the sea, called Boehm, and to him was given the task
of dealing with Mangan. Boehm was a wirey and ferrety-looking
little fellow of slight physique to whom violence and even
murder were of small account. An adept at throwing the knife and
the use of the pistol, in his own country he had many kills to
his credit. Life was held cheaply where he came from and, when
well-paid, he was a very reliable man, stalking his prey with
all the patience and cunning of a beast of the wilds.</p>

<p>The second attache had seen Mangan upon more than one
occasion when the latter had been visiting the captain at the
Embassy, and now gave Boehm a thorough description of what he
was like. Not only that, but he produced a photograph of the
Major, which after a long and patient search had been found in
one of the weekly illustrated magazines. It had been taken about
a year previously at a reunion of some of the Commandos who had
taken part in the raid upon Dieppe. The attache expressly warned
Boehm that a kill was all that was wanted from him, and then he
was to get away from wherever he had satisfactorily dealt with
Mangan as speedily and secretly as possible.</p>

<p>Told to expect to come upon Mangan on the island, most
probably only at week-ends, Boehm started off one Saturday
morning upon his quest, taking the train to Benfleet, the
nearest railway station. He had brought his bicycle with him,
but was intending to leave it in the station cloak-room every
Sunday evening when, if unsuccessful, he would return to Town to
wait for the next week-end. His orders were not to put up
anywhere on the island for the Saturday night, but to get a bed
somewhere in the surrounding district, at a different place,
however, every time. He had been told the waiting might be a
long business, perhaps running into several weeks, but he would
certainly come upon Mangan in the end. In the light of what
might follow later, he was not to enquire about Mangan anywhere
by his name.</p>

<p>Boehm was a shrewd little man and soon came to the conclusion
that it was a shack and not a bungalow that the Major owned, as
there were no bungalows under the sea-wall itself adjacent to
the only hotel which was situated upon the high sea-wall itself.
However, there were twenty and more shacks which in every way
answered to the description that had been given him, so far
below the level of the sea-wall that no ships passing by could
be seen from their windows and within two or three minutes walk
of the hotel. So, to these shacks he intended to give all his
attention. They were all of the same appearance, cheaply built,
two-room affairs and, from what he could see through some
uncurtained windows, with their flooring made up of loose
boards. Each of them stood in its own little bit of ground, with
a low fence round it and a few square yards of grass in
front.</p>

<p>Starting upon his watching, he took up a position on the sea
side of the wall, with his head just above the level of the top,
so that he could look over, without attracting too much
attention from anybody who passed by on the road below. It being
winter-time, however, very few people went by, and with the
first week-end he spent there, he realised his job was going to
be as monotonous a one as possibly could be. Still, it never
entered into his mind not to carry it through, and the only
relaxation he would allow himself was on the Saturday evening at
six o'clock and the Sunday morning at one when he went up to the
hotel and treated himself to two glasses of beer.</p>

<p>Two, three, four, five week-ends passed without anything to
interest him, but then upon the sixth, though he was never to
become aware of it, a most momentous happening for him
occurred.</p>

<p>He was brought in contact with the so-well known one-time
detective, Gilbert Larose.</p>

<p>Two days previously Larose had received a letter from his
wife's cousin in Berkeley Square.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear Gilbert</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I have two interesting things to tell you. The
first, that little friend of yours, Emma Hobson, is going to be
married to the very nice detective, Geoffrey Hilliard. They are
very much in love with each other and I am sure will always
bless the day when you brought them together. I have given her
£50 for a wedding present and you are going to give her a like
sum. She is going to be married from here in three weeks time.
The second thing, Emma has just remembered that, when that
beastly Major was having dinner that night with the late greatly
lamented Professor Glenowen, she heard him say how much he
enjoyed a Sunday's eel-spearing in the muddy dykes round Canvey
Island. I thought that piece of information might turn out to be
of some use to you.</p>

<p class="letter">Hoping you are behaving yourself,</p>

<p class="letter">Your affectionate cousin-in-law,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Hettie</span>.</p>

<p><br>
Larose was greatly interested in the letter and his lively
imagination began to work at once. Canvey Island! Hundreds and
hundreds of little bungalows and shacks all crowded together
there, but any one of them which could be as isolated and lonely
as if planted down in the middle of the Sahara Desert! Why, if
as the police had for some time now been surmising, Mangan was
indeed a dealer in stolen goods, it would be an ideal place in
which to hide things away until he could dispose of them in
safety! Then, of course, too, he might be keeping there the
large sums of money which the professor had paid him, as well as
the stolen Corot painting! Oh, what possibilities the idea
opened up, and was it not strengthened by what Tom Pike, the
garage man, had told him of his surmises that Mangan often
motored somewhere down the Thames Estuary way upon fine
Sundays?</p>

<p>Accordingly, most sanguine that his reasoning was sound,
Larose had come down to Canvey Island upon that Saturday morning
in happy expectation that he would almost certainly hear
something about Mangan. Of course, he was quite aware that at
that time of the year the island would be practically deserted
by visiting holiday makers, but he was thinking that among the
permanent residents, the shop-keepers and tradesmen, he would
certainly find someone who would recognise Mangan by the
photograph which had been taken of him that day when he was
being questioned at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>He was quite prepared to find that no one knew the Major by
name. It might be there had been no occasion for Mangan to have
mentioned it. Then, too, if his bungalow or shack, whichever it
might be, was being used as a hiding place, if he ever had to
give a name, it certainly would not have been his correct one.
He was of much too cunning a nature for that.</p>

<p>Larose had motored down from Town, but, not wishing to
attract attention, he had left his car in a garage close by in
Benfleet and crossed to the island on foot. To give himself
plenty of time for his enquiries, he was intending to put up for
the night at the hotel on the sea-wall and not return to Town
until the Sunday evening.</p>

<p>Beginning his enquiries in a most hopeful frame of mind, he
nevertheless realised almost at once that he was going to be
greatly disappointed. He got no encouragement at all. No one
recognised the photograph, no one remembered anyone like it, no
garage had serviced, as far as could be recollected, the car of
such a man and no milkman had sold him milk.</p>

<p>In effect, no one knew anything about him, and Larose had
drawn a complete blank.</p>

<p>Tramping all over the island, with dusk beginning to fall
Larose felt almost inclined to laugh at his non-success. It was
in every way so thorough and such a knock-down blow to his
cocksureness that he had been so clever in his surmises. Indeed,
but the aching of his legs from his long tramp, he would have
gone back to Town that same night. However, he did not fancy the
walk to Benfleet to pick up his car, and so turned into the
hotel for dinner and a good night's rest. The meal was plain,
but nicely cooked, and he grinned sheepishly when he was served
with a good helping of stewed eels. They rubbed in his lack of
success.</p>

<p>Revived by his meal, afterwards he sat in the comfortable
lounge-bar and watched the lights of the ships going by. It was
high tide and situated as the bar was it seemed little above the
level of the water.</p>

<p>With, what he estimated, the greater than a million to one
chance that he would run into Mangan himself, Larose had not
come made-up, or altered his appearance in any way. Still,
wearing a black leather motoring coat buttoned up to his chin
and with dark glasses, he was confident no one would recognise
him unless it happened he was being particularly looked for.</p>

<p>The bar had quite a number of patrons and he watched their
coming and going without much interest until a man whom he was
sure he had met somewhere before, came in. It was Boehm of the
Baltic Embassy, and Larose, always prided himself that he never
forgot a face, after a number of furtive glances in his
direction, was most annoyed that he could not now place him.
Yet, it should have been quite easy, he told himself
vexatiously, as the man's appearance was an unusual one, with a
dark and narrow face and with eyes which would remind anyone of
those of a ferret.</p>

<p>As with himself, the man was evidendy a stranger to the
others in the bar, with him passing the time of day to no one
and no one taking any notice of him. Smoking cigarette after
cigarette, he seemed mainly interested in watching the shipping
through the windows, though Larose soon came to notice that,
when the bar door opened, he always turned to have a quick look
to see who had come in.</p>

<p>The man had two glasses of beer, but he was so slow in
drinking them that they lasted until nearly closing time, when
with no good-night to anyone he got up and went out. A few
minutes later, when all who were not staying in the hotel had
gone away, too, Larose remarked casually to the barman,
"Curious-looking fellow, that little dark chap! I'm sure I've
seen him before. Who is he, do you know?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't sir," replied the barman, "and no one else round
here does, either. He's been dropping in for a drink now for
quite a fair number of week-ends, but except on Saturdays and
Sundays we never see anything of him. He's a bit of a mystery to
us. He never says a word to anyone."</p>

<p>"Then doesn't he live about here?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No, sir, and no one knows where he <i>does</i> live, but
it's certainly not on the island. He's got a bicycle and goes
back over the bridge every blessed Saturday and Sunday night,
but where he sleeps no one has any idea."</p>

<p>"But what does he do for a living?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>The barman looked amused. "He never seems to do anything. We
think he's not quite right in his head. He turns up here on his
bike regular every Saturday morning about ten, rides about a bit
and then goes and sits upon the seawall a few hundred yards or
so from here and keeps his eyes on everything that's going on.
We think he must be watching for someone. He's got a pair of
glasses and uses them a lot. One night when he came in the bar
here he forgot the glasses and left them where he had been
sitting. Before he remembered and rushed back to get them, we
all had a look at them and a gent here said they were good 'uns
and worth forty or fifty quid. Just fancy a chap like him with
glasses worth all that money. It's damned funny to me."</p>

<p>Larose thought it was funny, too, and, thinking about it and
the man himself kept him from dropping off to sleep for a long
while. However, finally he slept soundly and awakened with a
start when he heard the gong going for breakfast. He gave
another start and a much bigger one this time when, jumping out
of bed, it came to him in a sudden flash where he had seen the
man with the ferret's eyes before.</p>

<p>It had been at the Baltic Embassy!</p>

<p>During the Great War, on Secret Service together, he and
Captain Michaeloff had been on quite friendly terms. They had
met many times and Larose had often been to the Embassy. Upon
his arrival there one evening, he had seen the captain talking
to a man in the hall and had thought the fellow to be of such a
rodent-like appearance that later he had remarked laughingly
about it. Whereupon the captain had told him the man was one of
their best trusted Secret Service agents and had carried out
many dangerous jobs for them. He had added with a smile, "And I
should say his fondness for using the pistol is even greater
than yours."</p>

<p>Now Larose was stirred to tremendous interest by his sudden
discovery. "Whew," he whistled, "one of the crack Baltic agents!
Then of course he's on some dirty business now! He's watching
for someone whom he knows will come along if he waits long
enough for him."</p>

<p>He hurried over his breakfast, so that he could go and look
at the place where the barman had told him the man took up his
position to watch. It was quite early as yet, and he reckoned he
had a good half hour before he would arrive.</p>

<p>He located the spot easily enough by the large number of
cigarette butts scattered about, and peered curiously over the
top of the sea-wall to make out exactly what the watcher would
be able to see. For one thing, he could mark every yard of the
road which led to the bridge crossing the creek near Benfleet
Railway Station and, for another, have a close-up view of the
long row of small shacks which stretched in an unbroken line
just across the road below, running parallel to the sea-wall. At
the present time all these shacks appeared to be untenanted,
which was not to be wondered at, he thought, as they would be
bitterly cold in the winter months.</p>

<p>Moving a couple of hundred yards or so away, he took up a
position where he would not be seen by the man and waited for
him to arrive. He soon appeared upon his bicycle and, laying the
machine down in the tall grass behind one of the shacks, climbed
up over the sea-wall and started upon his usual watch. Half an
hour of it, however, was quite enough for Larose and, chancing
he would miss nothing, he went for a brisk walk, returning only
in time for lunch at the hotel.</p>

<p>After that he took no more interest in the man until the
afternoon began to wane. Then he started to walk back to
Benfleet and pick up his car. He timed his pace so that he
should have just crossed the bridge when darkness came. He
wanted to find out in which direction the man would go when he
had quitted the island, and he had no difficulty there. Rather
as he had expected, the man turned into the railway station and,
a minute later, was waiting upon the platform for the up-train,
the smoke of which could now be seen in the distance. He had
left his bicycle in the station cloak-room.</p>

<p>After the departure of the train Larose strolled into the
station, ostensibly to obtain the correct time, but he asked
casually of a porter standing by who the man was who had just
ridden in on a bicycle. "I often see him," he said, "and wonder
who he is." The porter did not know, but supplied the
information that he left his machine with them every Sunday
evening and picked it up again on the following Saturday
morning. "He comes from Town," he added, "with a week-end
excursion ticket."</p>

<p>In the week which followed Larose's thoughts were full of the
ferrety-eyed man, for with his ever lively imagination some
glimmering of what was the real truth was starting to take
possession of his mind. What a coincidence it would be he told
himself, if he and the Baltic Embassy were now trying to trail
the same individual, he, however, wanting only to get hold of
what the man had hidden away, while they, probably, were out for
a bloody and murderous revenge!</p>

<p>Of course that would mean that the Baltic crowd had fallen
out with Mangan because they were now considering he had done
them some ill turn. In that case, of all races they would be the
most dangerous, as recent events had shewn their civilisation to
be only skin deep, with murder and assassination the natural
return for anyone who had happened to cross their path.</p>

<p>It might be, his thoughts ran on, that any such falling out
seemed highly improbable, but on the other hand how was the
Embassy to imagine any explanation of the so-mysterious
disappearance of Captain Michaeloff and his companion without
bringing Mangan into the picture. They may have argued that,
having been in such close touch with them that night in the
Castle, he <i>must</i> know something of what happened to them
therefore, by denying that he knew anything, it could only mean
lies and treachery upon his part. They would be realising that
to thwart them as thoroughly and completely as had been done
suggested a lot of planning on someone's part, and they might be
imagining it could not have been carried out with such
overwhelming success without Mangan's aid.</p>

<p>However, Larose gave up speculating, with the only certain
conclusion he had arrived at being that if it were indeed Mangan
for whom the ferrety-eyed was now waiting, then the Embassy must
be in possession of more information than he, Larose, had. They
must be certain Mangan had a shack upon Canvey Island and,
moreover, had a good idea about where it was situated.</p>

<p>The following Saturday morning he was again upon the island
and had early taken up a position from where at a distance he
would be able to watch everything that was going on. If nothing
however, happened during the day, he told himself it would be
the last time he himself would bother anyone. He would pass the
whole thing on to Scotland Yard and leave it to them to do what
they thought best.</p>

<p>In due time the man appeared as usual and the day began to
pass away exactly as it had done the previous Saturday, except
for the weather being now much more unpleasant. Misty conditions
and a fine drizzling rain having set in, Larose cuddled himself
despondently in his mackintosh and wished he was anywhere but
where he now was. Back in his position after a good lunch at the
hotel, he soon began to feel very sleepy. Leaning back under a
high breakwater on the river side of the sea-wall and sheltered
from the rain, he had difficulty in keeping his eyes open.
Finally, he got tired of blinking them at the man in the
distance, and dropped off altogether into a comfortable little
sleep.</p>

<p>Afterwards he realised he must have slept for a full hour and
longer before, happily always a light sleeper, he was awakened
suddenly by the faint crash of breaking glass, followed almost
instantly, one after another, by two sharp sounds as if someone
were cracking a whip.</p>

<p>At any rate, that was what he thought when for a few brief
seconds his brain was still sodden from sleep. Then, as in a
flash of lightning, he realised they were reports of a pistol he
had heard, and he sprang wide-awake to his feet to see that the
man he had been watching was no longer in his accustomed
place.</p>

<p>He ran quickly forward to where the man had been, but he was
not anywhere in sight and the road running between the sea-wall
and the line of shacks was quite deserted. Indeed, not a soul
was to be seen anywhere. The air was mistier than ever and
visibility was very bad.</p>

<p>For a few moments he stood hesitating and then, a bare fifty
yards away, the man he was looking for came into sight wheeling
his bicycle out from behind one of the shacks. Reaching the
road, he mounted his machine and rode quickly away. He had not
turned round and so had not seen Larose watching him.</p>

<p>"God," exclaimed Larose hoarsely, "then he has got his man!
He has murdered somebody," and, without waiting a second and
mindful of the crash of breaking glass that he heard, Larose ran
quickly down the sea-wall to find a shack with a broken
window.</p>

<p>It was close near and he came upon it almost at once. Darting
up the short path, he saw there were spots of blood upon the
sill below the broken window. Stopping dead in his tracks, his
eyes roved round and he saw there was blood also upon the
ground, directly underneath the handle of the closed door only a
few feet away. Moving quickly over to the door, he turned the
handle gingerly and, throwing the door wide open, peered into
the shack.</p>

<p>A body was lying upon the floor, with its head turned
sideways in a pool of blood and, with an instant's glance, he
saw it was that of Leon Mangan. The blood had only just ceased
welling from a bullet hole in the forehead. From the disturbed
state of the dead man's jacket it looked as if the breast pocket
had been rifled. Otherwise, it did not appear as if anything in
the shack had been interfered with.</p>

<p>Larose drew in a deep breath and the beatings of his heart
calmed down. With just another quick backward glance at the
body, he left the shack and pulled the door to, as before,
touching the handle as lightly as possible. Looking round in
every direction, again there was not a soul in sight and, at a
quick pace, he set off towards railway station.</p>

<p>He was in no anxiety that the murderer would not be picked up
speedily and be within the cells in a very few hours. When about
half a mile from the railway station, he heard the whistle of a
train coming from the direction of Southend.</p>

<p>"An up-train!" he exclaimed. "Good, then they'll catch him as
he comes off the train at Fenchurch Street. He'll be quite
unsuspicious and will not have time to put up any fight."</p>

<p>Reaching the railway station at Benfleet, he walked in to
speak to the station-master. "I'm Police," he announced
laconically. "Now, a man with a bicycle got on that train,
didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the station-master, "a smallish, dark fellow.
He'd got a return-half to Fenchurch Street."</p>

<p>"That's the man," nodded Larose. "And he took his bicycle
with him? Then, what's the number of its ticket? Now at what
time does that train get to Fenchurch Street?"</p>

<p>"Five twenty-two if it's punctual."</p>

<p>Larose impressed upon the station-master the importance of
strict silence, and proceeded to the garage where he had left
his car. He put through a trunk-call to Inspector Stone's
private number at Scotland Yard. Stone was off-duty, but to
Larose's great relief the youthful Inspector Mendel came to the
phone.</p>

<p>"It's Gilbert Larose speaking," said Larose. "Oh, you
recognise my voice, do you? Of course you do! You don't often
hear such a nice one! Now, you listen most carefully. I'm
speaking from Hull's garage in Benfleet, close to the bridge
crossing on to Canvey Island. No one as yet knows what I am
going to tell you. I mean, I haven't communicated with the local
police." He spoke slowly and impressively. "That Major Leon
Mangan was murdered in a shack upon the island a little over
half an hour ago. His killer is on the train from here which
reaches Fenchurch Street at five twenty-two, five twenty-two.
Got that all right? You can't mistake him. He's a small and dark
man, with a narrow face and eyes set close together. He's an
agent of the Baltic Embassy. He's got a cut, which was bleeding
half an hour ago, on one of his fingers. You'll probably find
the dead man's wallet on him. Also, he has a bicycle in the
guard's van. Ticket number two four six. He thinks no one saw
him and won't be suspicious. Still, he's carrying a gun and will
draw on the instant. He's of a desperate class of men. Now have
you got everything? Repeat it all to me."</p>

<p>Inspector Mendel repeated everything in a voice which, with
all his usual self-control, was hoarse in emotion.</p>

<p>Larose went on, "Rout out Inspector Stone and come down here
with him at once. You will see my car standing outside this
garage. I shall be waiting for you. Oh, you must put on the best
man you've got to make the arrest. Whom will you send?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Harker," replied Mendel. "You couldn't have a
better man."</p>

<p>"All right," said Larose. "I know him. Get him to ring me up
directly he's got the man. This is the number. I shall be
waiting here and very anxious to know that it's gone off all
right. You and Inspector Stone should be here by six."</p>

<p>As can be well imagined, there passed a very worried time
waiting for the news to come of the arrest of the murderer, but
it came through even earlier than he had dared to hope, just
after half past five.</p>

<p>"Got him all right," came the gleeful voice of Inspector
Harker, "all complete and true to label, ferret's eyes, cut
finger, wallet, and bicycle in the guard's van. But by Jove, as
you warned, he was quick with his gun! I think he must have
recognised one of us, because he started to draw as he was
getting out of the carriage, but we'd grabbed him before he
could get his gun out. Yes, sir, nothing could have gone
better."</p>

<p>Hardly had Larose come away from the phone when two police
cars drew up at the garage. Inspector Stone was there and for a
moment the gravity dropped from his face. "Gilbert again!" he
laughed. "The naughty boy working all on his own!"</p>

<p>He changed into Larose's car to drive over to the island, and
as they went along Larose told him quickly everything that had
happened. "But, Charlie," he said earnestly, "for Heaven's sake
leave me out of it. If those devils at the Embassy ever come to
learn that I had a hand in it, I'll be the next one to go."</p>

<p>"You're quite right, my boy," nodded Stone, "and I promise
you your name shall not come out." He chuckled. "We'll let the
public imagine we've been working like beavers all these weeks
and just biding our time." He turned to stare at Larose. "But
why the devil did he come down here on a wretched rainy day like
this?"</p>

<p>"The very kind of weather he'd prefer," said Larose, "when he
would hope there would be no people about. As to why he came at
all&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders, "&mdash;who knows?
Perhaps, if he's been hiding all that money here, he came to get
hold of some of it. Young Avon heard the other day in Town that
he's been losing a tremendous lot at the races lately. That
would account for his taking the risk."</p>

<p>"And he came on foot, you say?" commented Stone.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you'll probably find that he's left his car
somewhere in Benfleet. What I think happened was that this
Embassy fellow saw him sneak into his shack and close the door
after him. So, in case anyone should be coming along and get the
business over as quickly as possible, he broke the glass and
shot him through the window. He was cycling off again in a
couple of minutes."</p>

<p>Arriving at the shack, for a few moments they stood in
silence over the dead man. "Two bullets," said Stone softly,
"and either one would have killed him." He looked round the
shack. "And, if I'm not very much mistaken, under these
floor-boards we shall find all we've been wanting for so long."
He eyed Larose intently. "But why do you think they killed
him?"</p>

<p>"Evidently they thought he knew too much," replied Larose
evasively, "and so they did to him what they probably often do
to those whom they imagine have become dangerous to them. For
all we know, as you once suggested, perhaps the Embassy,
Glenowen and Mangan were all working together." He looked at his
watch. "Well, I'd better clear off now, but if you find anything
here you might ring me up this evening at the Semiris and tell
me all about it," and Stone promised he would.</p>

<p>The stout inspector was even better than his promise, for
about ten o'clock he turned up in person at the hotel. He was
looking very pleased with everything.</p>

<p>"The Corot painting," he exclaimed smilingly, "£5 notes that
will take half a day to count and about a hundred pages of
manuscript, the precious diary which the mad old professor had
written up." He accepted the double whisky Larose had had
brought to him. "A very happy ending, Gilbert, my boy, except
that we shan't see Mangan in the dock," and Larose agreed with
him there.</p>

<p>A week after Mangan's murder and the so speedy arrest of his
murderer, Larose came to the Castle to tell Lord Delamarne
everything that had happened up to date.</p>

<p>"The man makes no attempt to deny his guilt," he said, "but
declares he was acting entirely upon his own, with robbery the
only motive. Of course the Baltic Embassy pretends to be
terribly shocked that anyone ever associated with them should
have committed such a dreadful crime. In a roundabout way they
are showing a lot of curiosity as to how he came to be caught so
soon." He grinned. "But I am happy to say this curiosity of
theirs is not going to be satisfied, or I should now be shaking
in my shoes. They are a bloody-minded lot and, we can surmise,
would go to any lengths to get their revenge."</p>

<p>"But what about those memoirs of Glenowen, which the police
found in the shack?" asked his lordship. "Will they be made
public?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, and even their existence is not
going to be allowed to come out." He shrugged his shoulders.
"What would be the good? They prove conclusively that Glenowen
had been spying for the Baltic Embassy ever since the ending of
the war and, also, that those there were quite aware, at any
rate in the end, that Mangan had committed all those so-called
atom murders. Still from what the professor actually wrote down,
and we must remember his memoirs were uncompleted, it is left
doubtful if the Baltic people were co-instigators with him from
the very beginning."</p>

<p>When Larose had left the Castle Lord Delamarne took out of
his desk a letter he had received from Penelope only that same
morning, and re-read it for the third time. It was bright and
chatty, and written from a hotel in Torquay. After saying what a
lovely time they were having and how very happy they both were,
Penelope went on:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Lord and Lady Brennington are staying in this
hotel, too, and both ask to be very kindly remembered to you.
For some reason her ladyship has taken a great fancy to us and
will insist that we are to go next week upon a few days visit to
their place, Brennington Towers, near Ashburton. Really, I am
not very keen about it, but Chester is most anxious to go
because she has promised him some good fox-hunting and so I have
agreed to go. I like her ladyship well enough, except for her
being such a dreadful snob. She is always sneering at those she
calls "the common people," moaning how different we, our class,
are from them. On the quiet, as I am sure you can understand, I
am most amused about it, wondering what on earth she would say
if she only knew whom my father had been. I believe she would be
so furious that I almost think she would want to drive me from
her door with a whip.</p>

<p><br>
Lord Delamarne tore the letter into little pieces.</p>

<p>He was smiling to himself.</p>
