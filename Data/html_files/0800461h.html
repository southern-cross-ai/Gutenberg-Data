  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">AS noon approached, Mike Speedon cleared his desk
  preparatory to leaving his office in the Recorder-Press Building. It was a
  very small office, but the fact that he had an office of his own testified to
  his importance on the premises. He was usually called Society Reporter, which
  he didn't like; "Social Commentator" or "Columnist" pleased him better. His
  column was more and more widely syndicated and he had become a big figure in
  the smart life of the town and, in fact, of the nation. And nobody knew it
  better than Mike himself. He didn't have to keep office hours any more, but
  he attended every morning from nine to twelve because of what he called his
  Puritan conscience. In other respects he was not exactly a Puritan.</p>

  <p>The telephone rang and he picked up the instrument. It was Warner Bassett,
  City Editor. Hearing the silky quality in Warner's voice, Mike frowned;
  around the shop he wanted to be treated as one of the gang. Since he had
  become a "feature" on the paper, Mike was no longer under Bassett's direct
  control.</p>

  <p>"Hi, Mike! Stop by a moment on your way out, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" said Mike, thinking: What the hell does he want of me? Something I
  don't want to do, that's certain.</p>

  <p>As he picked up his hat, he considered his engagements for the day; 1
  p.m., lunch with Peggy Rhinelander <i>et al.</i> at the Colony; a dull bunch
  but the food would be good; ought to be able to get away by 2:30. Then home
  for a good sleep. This afternoon nap was Mike's secret. He posed as a
  superman who didn't require more than three hours' sleep in the twenty-four.
  5 p.m. cocktails at the Alexanders'; 6 would be plenty of time to get there.
  Half an hour was enough for the Alexanders. Must look in at Mrs. Overton's
  afterwards; that woman had the commanding eye of a rising star. Home to
  dress; 8 p.m., Sloan dinner at the St. Regis; big bow-wows; wear the jeweled
  gardenia and Inverness cape. Get away in time to look in at Gilbert Miller's
  first night before the show let out; then a quick round of Jack and
  Charlie's; Stork Club; El Morocco. Promised to join the Paley's party at
  12:30. And at 1:30 ... Paradise! Mike smiled to himself. No danger of
  forgetting <i>that</i>!</p>

  <p>He passed through the littered city room and into Warner's enclosure in
  the corner. Warner, keen, gray-faced, chewing an unlighted cigar, was the
  picture of a city editor. He was only a year or two older than Mike. Looking
  up at the latter's fresh complexion he asked sourly:</p>

  <p>"What time did you get to bed this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere around three-thirty."</p>

  <p>"How the hell do you keep it up?"</p>

  <p>"It's a gift."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, a gift," said Warner bitterly. "Christ! you have it soft! Look at
  me! Look at all the boys here! It takes this whole damn manure pile to
  produce one perfect blossom like you! You stink like a gardenia!"</p>

  <p>There was no unfriendliness in this, and Mike merely grinned. "Sure! But
  you didn't ask me here to talk about the flowers. What?..."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Charles Warrington Ware is going to conduct a hay ride up Broadway
  at midnight tonight," said Warner abruptly. "I've just been tipped off."</p>

  <p>"Sure you've been tipped off. And every other newspaper in town. Why else
  give a hay ride?"</p>

  <p>"You're supposed to be a friend of hers," said Warner.</p>

  <p>Mike said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Have you been invited on this hay ride?"</p>

  <p>"I have."</p>

  <p>"Are you going?"</p>

  <p>"Can you see me?"</p>

  <p>"No," grumbled Warner, "but I don't know the requirements of your job. I
  reckon you have to pay for your fun one way or another."</p>

  <p>"I'm getting to the point where I can pick and choose," said Mike. "I've
  got better copy for my column than old Flora Ward's hay ride."</p>

  <p>"The woman is batty!"</p>

  <p>"Aren't we all?"</p>

  <p>"Sixty-seven years old, and trying to outdo the debutantes!"</p>

  <p>"She's not insane, if that's what you mean," said Mike. "For forty years
  she was the meek and uncomplaining wife of Charles W. Ware, the nickel
  king."</p>

  <p>"Cut out the headlines!"</p>

  <p>"Headlines to the headliner," murmured Mike.</p>

  <p>"Save it! Save it!"</p>

  <p>"You know what old Charlie Ware was; he reduced everybody around him to a
  mush of concession. Especially his wife. He allowed her twelve hundred a
  month out of which she had to keep up two big houses. She scarcely had a
  dollar to spend on herself. Close-mouthed old so-and-so; she never knew how
  rich he was until after he died. He was so busy making money he could never
  stop to draw up a will, and she inherited three million a year without any
  strings to it. She's lost her head, that's all; at sixty-seven she's having
  her first taste of life."</p>

  <p>"All the leeches in town have fastened on her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, not all of them. She has a head leech who does her best to keep the
  others off."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Bethesda Prior?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Bethesda's the one who thinks up the hay rides and other
  scintillating stunts."</p>

  <p>"They're all batty, I say," cried Warner.</p>

  <p>"No," said Mike, "publicity-drunk...You ought to have seen Flora Ware the
  night Ciro's opened. She spends the whole day at Helena Rubinstein's getting
  fixed up for an occasion like that. Her entrance stopped the show. A white
  satin gown from Hattie Carnegie's like a bride's; a drift of white fox around
  her skinny shoulders and a diamond tiara like a sky sign! She was like
  nothing in the world but an animated waxwork in technicolor. She ordered
  champagne for the reporters and press photographers and sat down to tell them
  about herself. 'Boys,' I heard her say as I passed by, 'my hair is all my
  own, too; and if you don't believe it, pull it, pull it!'"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Warner, "but what can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Give her the silence treatment. She would die of chagrin."</p>

  <p>"You let her have plenty of space in your column."</p>

  <p>"Once I did; not now. Leave her to the tabloids. She's their dish. This is
  a newspaper."</p>

  <p>"It used to be," said Warner sourly.</p>

  <p>"You're in a position to take the initiative," urged Mike. "Call up the
  other papers and get them to agree to boycott this wacky hay ride."</p>

  <p>"You're an idealist," said Warner. "They'd rat on me; they're all hyenas;
  I'm a hyena, too."</p>

  <p>Mike shrugged.</p>

  <p>"No!" said Warner briskly; "she's worth sixty million, and she's news. I
  can cover the hay ride all right; what I wanted from you&mdash;as a
  favor&mdash;was the inside story. The others won't have that. You're one of
  her gang. Why, they said for a while that you were engaged to her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" said Mike with a mock shudder.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to sign the story," urged Warner, "and you can make it
  satirical if you want&mdash;but not too satirical."</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing," said Mike. "Sorry."</p>

  <p>"Why not? It's your line."</p>

  <p>"That's just the reason. This café society or saloon society, or whatever
  you call it, is an A-1 racket; it helps sell the paper; it's money in our
  pockets ..."</p>

  <p>"Particularly in your pocket," put in Warner.</p>

  <p>"Sure. But at that I'm not kidded by it...Nothing lasts forever and a
  woman like Flora Ware threatens my profitable racket. Everything and
  everybody she is associated with is smeared with ridicule. Nothing in this
  fair land of ours can stand long against ridicule. Glamour is my stock in
  trade, and if Flora and her like peel all the glamour off saloon society,
  I'll be looking for a new job."</p>

  <p>"Maybe so," said Warner, "but that's too long a view for the editor of a
  daily paper. I've got to play up Mrs. Charles Warrington Ware while she
  lasts." He returned to the papers on his desk. "Get out! Who are you lunching
  with today, Tallulah or Ina or Libby?"</p>

  <p>"No such luck. I'm out on hire today."</p>

  <p>"Lucky stiff! Give 'em my love anyhow, and the hell with them!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. CHARLES WARRINGTON WARE occupied a triplex apartment at
  the top of the most expensive building on the Avenue. Bethesda had leased it
  for her. Two walls of the vast living room were painted white and the other
  two black, thus immediately establishing a modernistic atmosphere. Down at
  one end was an arrangement of primitive African sculpture&mdash;very
  primitive; other decorations included big wooden bowls of colored glass balls
  placed here and there on the floor; modernistic sculptured animals on stands
  and surrealist paintings on the walls. In the beginning Mrs. Ware had felt
  obliged to avert her eyes from the primitive sculpture and the surrealists,
  but she became accustomed to them in time, and all her sophisticated friends
  agreed with Bethesda, that the whole effect was <i>très-chi-chi</i>.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock on the morning following the over-publicized hay ride,
  Miss Day Radnor rang the bell of the apartment as usual, and was admitted by
  Cummings, the butler. Brown-haired Miss Radnor, who favored severely tailored
  suits and hats as if she was determined to hide how pretty she was (but only
  thereby emphasized it), looked a little out of place among the grotesques,
  but she worked there. She said:</p>

  <p>"Weren't you up very late last night, Cummings?"</p>

  <p>"Moderately so, Miss."</p>

  <p>"And already on the job?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I like to see that things get properly started in the morning,
  Miss."</p>

  <p>Cummings did not run quite true to type; his attire lacked something of a
  butler's superhuman neatness; his coarse black hair had a tendency to fall
  over his forehead, his features were rugged. But his manner was smooth
  enough&mdash;too smooth, Day Radnor felt; too watchful. It was not quite
  natural that Cummings should always be the last to go to bed and the first to
  get up. However, she told herself, it was not her put.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen this morning's papers, Miss?" asked Cummings.</p>

  <p>"No," said Day, "and I don't want to."</p>

  <p>Cummings shook his head sympathetically and sadly.</p>

  <p>Day was not going to be drawn into a discussion of the hay ride with the
  butler. "What time did the party break up?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Madam ordered me to stop serving drinks at one-thirty, Miss. That is
  earlier than usual. Of course, they soon went after that. I went to bed
  myself, leaving Alfred on duty. Alfred told me they were all out shortly
  after two."</p>

  <p>"I see." Day was thinking. Evidently the hay ride did not make much of a
  hit.</p>

  <p>"I think Madam had words with Mrs. Prior last night," ventured Cummings.
  "Alfred told me that ..."</p>

  <p>Day shut him off. "Much mail this morning?" she asked briskly.</p>

  <p>"The usual basketful, Miss...Mostly begging letters, I should say," he
  added sourly. It was odd, Day thought, how jealous Mrs. Ware's beneficiaries
  were of all her other beneficiaries.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," she said.</p>

  <p>To the right of the entrance door there was a small, plainly furnished
  room that was called the "office." This was Day's hangout between the hours
  of nine and five and often later. Mrs. Ware rarely visited it; indeed. Day
  sometimes did not see her employer for several days at a time. Her
  instructions would be transmitted through Cummings or a maid. Cummings
  followed Day into the office now. Nothing could discourage his attempts to
  establish an alliance with the secretary.</p>

  <p>"That will be all, thank you," said Day; and with a hard look through his
  lashes he silently went out.</p>

  <p>Day dutifully attacked the big basket of mail. Same old sniveling appeals.
  What a world! Mrs. Ware insisted on having a complete written report of the
  beggars, and, if she happened to feel in a good humor, would send out checks
  recklessly without further investigation. How nicely I could use a check!
  thought Day.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock she rang for a servant, and Cummings promptly appeared
  again. "Has Mrs. Ware rung?" asked Day.</p>

  <p>"No, Miss."</p>

  <p>"Then I think she ought to be wakened now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss; but we have a standing order not to rouse her until she
  rings."</p>

  <p>"She has an appointment at Helena Rubinstein's at eleven, and you know how
  important that is to her." Day consulted a memorandum on her desk. Today Mrs.
  Ware was to have a complete check up from the physician at the beauty clinic,
  followed by a workout and relaxation under the infra-red rays. After that she
  had not decided whether to take massage and the ultra-violet rays, or a
  pasteurized milk bath. She would lunch there, and after lunch she was down
  for an electro-tonic facial, a molding treatment and a hot-oil manicure.
  Chiropedicure at the same time, of course, a personality make-up and a
  coiffure for the evening.</p>

  <p>"If she's late it will upset the whole schedule."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Miss, I will instruct Kinsey to waken her."</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>Kinsey, Mrs. Ware's own maid, was lingering over her coffee in the
  servants' hall. Neat, prim and elderly, she had served some of the greatest
  ladies of England, and her wage and perquisites from Mrs. Ware amounted to
  double the earnings of a school teacher. Kinsey knew her own worth. She had
  to put up with a lot from her aging mistress, and she was apt to take it out
  on her fellow servants. They called her the Duchess, which did not displease
  her.</p>

  <p>When Cummings entered, Alfred, the second man, was hovering in the
  background. Alfred was a young fellow who had been chosen for his fine
  figure. He would have been handsome but for his shifty eyes. This morning the
  eyes were rimmed with red as if from lack of sleep, and his manner was
  jittery. When Cummings' eyes fell upon the young man, he said sharply:</p>

  <p>"What are you idling about for? I put out the silver to be cleaned."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Cummings," said Alfred, moving toward the door. However, he
  contrived to delay his departure until he heard what Cummings had to say to
  Kinsey.</p>

  <p>"Miss Radnor says you're to waken the Madam now."</p>

  <p>The elderly maid stiffened her already straight back. "What's she got to
  do with me, I'd like to know! Miss Reduced Gentility! I'm not in the habit of
  taking my orders from <i>her</i>!"</p>

  <p>Cummings glanced at her with indifferent dislike. "Madam has an
  appointment at the beauty parlor at eleven. She's booked to get the whole
  works today."</p>

  <p>Kinsey jumped up. "I didn't know the hour. I ought to have been informed
  of it before!" She flounced out.</p>

  <p>Alfred, who had no more than stepped out of the pantry door, came in
  again. His face was as white as paper, his hands clenched as if to keep them
  from shaking. "Excuse me, Mr. Cummings," he whined, "but I don't feel good.
  Could I go out to the drug store to get me some medicine?"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" asked Cummings.</p>

  <p>"It's my stomach, sir."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! Get cook to give you a dose of bicarbonate. You know you're not
  permitted to go out on your own business."</p>

  <p>Alfred went into the pantry with his head hanging.</p>

  <p>When Cummings was left alone his whole expression changed. He stood by the
  table with his head lowered, thinking hard. His foxy eyes drew closer
  together; there was power in his dark face; power and infinite cunning. After
  a while he went to the kitchen door and called Alfred in again. He showed a
  smoother front to the young man now.</p>

  <p>"This man Keppel who came to see the Madam yesterday morning; are you sure
  that was his name? It's not in the telephone book."</p>

  <p>"Keppel or Keppler or Kaplan or some such name," mumbled Alfred.</p>

  <p>Cummings clenched his teeth. "She sent me away on purpose!" he muttered.
  Then to Alfred: "You're certain he was a lawyer?"</p>

  <p>"It was on the card he gave me. Down in the corner of the card a string of
  names and under it 'Attorneys-at-Law, 120 Broadway.'"</p>

  <p>Cummings burst out: "Oh, my God! What a fool you are! I told you to watch
  her carefully while I was out."</p>

  <p>Alfred cringed before him. "After he'd gone I watched her," he whined.
  "And when she came down to lunch I went into the boudoir and looked for the
  card so I could copy it off for you, but she'd torn it up."</p>

  <p>"How did she receive him?" demanded Cummings.</p>

  <p>"Real friendly. He stayed an hour. After I showed him into the room she
  locked the door. I put my ear to it and I heard her say to him: 'I am
  surrounded by snoopers and spies!' And he said: 'We will keep our voices
  low.' Then I couldn't hear any more."</p>

  <p>Cummings paced the room, struggling to hold in his anger.</p>

  <p>"Martin drove her down to 120 Broadway late yesterday afternoon," said
  Alfred. "You could ask him whose office is there."</p>

  <p>"You fool!" cried Cummings. "That's the Equitable! Biggest office building
  in town. Thousands of tenants!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't know," whined Alfred.</p>

  <p>Cummings, pausing, looked Alfred up and down with an ugly smile. "Maybe
  Miss Radnor knows something about this lawyer. Look, you're a good-looking
  young fellow. And well turned. Can't you get it out of her?"</p>

  <p>Alfred's eyes shifted away. "Treats me like dirt, she does. Looks right
  through me as if I wasn't there."</p>

  <p>Cummings started to speak; heard uneven footsteps on the service stairs,
  and took warning from it. "Get out!" he snarled.</p>

  <p>Alfred slipped through the pantry door, flattened himself against the wall
  behind it, and listened, breathing fast.</p>

  <p>The elderly maid, Kinsey, ran into the servants' hall from the corridor
  with open mouth and starting eyes. "She's gone!"</p>

  <p>Cummings seized her wrist and, dragging her back into the corridor, pulled
  the door shut. "Quiet, for God's sake! Do you want to start a panic
  here!"</p>

  <p>"Gone! Gone!" whimpered Kinsey.</p>

  <p>Cummings pulled her along the corridor and into his own little office,
  closing that door also. "Now keep your head. Miss Kinsey. What do you mean,
  gone?"</p>

  <p>"She's not in her bed. She hasn't slept there all night."</p>

  <p>Cummings affected to laugh it off. His face was ghastly.</p>

  <p>"Maybe she had a fancy to try another bed."</p>

  <p>"I looked in all the rooms. And the bathrooms. And the boudoir. She's not
  there."</p>

  <p>"Maybe she came downstairs. Let's go through the rooms."</p>

  <p>They soon satisfied themselves that Mrs. Ware was not in any of the
  reception rooms. Cummings put his ear to the door of the office. He shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Better ask her," whispered Kinsey.</p>

  <p>"No! Keep her out of this. She's against us all!"</p>

  <p>They returned to the butler's office. "Maybe Madam went home with some of
  the guests," Cummings suggested. "Alfred says he didn't see all of them
  go."</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't do that," moaned Kinsey. "She had taken a dislike to her
  friends last night."</p>

  <p>Cummings wiped his face. "Oh...she was always taking dislikes. But after a
  glass or two, you understand..."</p>

  <p>Kinsey kept shaking her head. "She wouldn't stay out all night in her
  evening clothes! How could she show herself in the morning?"</p>

  <p>"When she wakes up she'll call up to tell you to bring her things to
  her."</p>

  <p>Kinsey's voice began to break. "Well, telephone, telephone, and find out
  where she is!"</p>

  <p>Cummings hesitated, scowling. "God! It would start such a story going! It
  would be on the streets in an hour!... Wait! I'll ask the night elevator man.
  I can bribe him to keep his mouth shut!"</p>

  <p>He called up the building superintendent. Yes, the night elevator man
  slept in the building. He was sleeping now, but he could be roused up if he
  was wanted.</p>

  <p>Cummings sent Kinsey upstairs to open Mrs. Ware's wardrobe and check her
  evening wraps.</p>

  <p>The young elevator man presently came in by the service entrance. He was
  still partly asleep, and had his coat collar turned up to hide the lack of a
  shirt beneath. His name was Walter. It woke him sharply when Cummings
  presented him with a five-dollar bill and swore him to secrecy. When the
  question was put, he said that Mrs. Ware had not gone out again the previous
  night after she had come home. He could go on the stand and swear it, he
  said. It would have been impossible for her to get out of the building unless
  she had walked downstairs, and as there were twelve flights of stairs, this
  hardly seemed likely. Cummings promised him another five dollars if he kept
  his mouth shut until he was released from his promise, and sent him away.</p>

  <p>Kinsey came down to report that all of Mrs. Ware's evening wraps, the
  white brocade with white fox, the green with a Kolinsky collar, the sable
  coat, the chinchilla, the mink, and the three ermine coats and wraps were all
  hanging in their usual places. "She wouldn't go out at this season without
  fur around her," wailed Kinsey.</p>

  <p>Cummings considered, scowling and stroking his chin.</p>

  <p>"Do you realize...do you realize what this means?" gasped Kinsey.</p>

  <p>"What are you getting at?" he demanded harshly.</p>

  <p>"It means that...that she is <i>still here</i>!" Hysterics threatened.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," said Cummings. "She might have been carried down the
  stairs... In an elevator building nobody watches the stairs."</p>

  <p>Kinsey's eyes widened; she caught her breath preparatory to a scream.
  Cummings, with a lightning move, stopped it with a hand over her mouth. "Shut
  up!" he said in her ear, not loudly but with a force that rendered the woman
  limp.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" she whispered. "The police?"</p>

  <p>"I'll call her attorney, Mr. MacKelcan," he muttered. "He can take the
  responsibility."</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>Sanford MacKelcan lost no time in obeying Cummings' summons. Mrs. Charles
  Warrington Ware was by far his richest client. "A matter of importance,"
  Cummings had said over the wire in a calm voice, so as not to throw the
  attorney into a dither before he got there. MacKelcan was the sort of lawyer
  who never pleads in court; estate management was his dish. He had developed
  the art of handling rich widows to a fine point; he and Mrs. Ware had always
  got along famously. He indulged all her whims, and drew up a new will
  whenever she demanded it. MacKelcan got along well with Cummings,
  too&mdash;on the surface; there was an unacknowledged working agreement
  between them. They traded information. MacKelcan went out of his way to court
  everybody who was in any way connected with his client.</p>

  <p>Cummings let him in. The butler had recovered his usual smoothness.
  MacKelcan was a very tall man with a small head having but little hair left
  on it. His legs were like pipe stems within his trousers, but he had a neat
  round belly that stuck out unexpectedly above, and for some reason he
  featured it by wearing a white waistcoat and letting his jacket hang open. He
  was very energetic; always striding along at top speed with his coat
  flapping. Also extremely voluble; fond of asking questions and seldom pausing
  to hear the replies.</p>

  <p>"Well, Cummings, how is every little thing? I was surprised to get so
  early a call. Luckily, it caught me just as I was leaving the office. Dropped
  everything, of course, to wait upon her exalted majesty, Queen Flora. How is
  my gracious lady this morning? Nothing wrong, I hope. The spiteful
  newspapers! You can't believe a word you read!"</p>

  <p>"She hasn't seen them, sir."</p>

  <p>"Good work! Keep them from her, Cummings; keep them from her; and I'll
  divert her mind into other channels. Pass on, that's my motto; always pass on
  to pleasanter things!"</p>

  <p>Cummings led the lawyer into the living room so that their voices could
  not carry through the door of the office. "Something is very, very wrong, I'm
  afraid, sir."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan naturally was appalled when he heard Cummings' story. But he was
  not nearly so great a fool as his flatulent talk might have suggested; he
  kept his head; he questioned the butler shrewdly. Yet he was genuinely
  dismayed; he kept saying: "I can't understand it! I can't understand it! She
  <i>must</i> be here and she is not here." MacKelcan and Cummings each
  recognized in the other a superior intelligence; they deferred to each other
  politely&mdash;and never let up in their watchfulness. But everybody (except
  Day Radnor) who was connected with the rich woman acquired that watchful
  air.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan said to Cummings: "I'm glad you didn't warn any of the people
  who were here last night, because, of course, if the worst <i>has</i>
  happened, suspicion will fall upon them first."</p>

  <p>Together they made another tour of the apartment, omitting only the
  office. They overlooked the quiet secretary in there. They opened all the
  closet doors and looked under the beds. On the third floor there was an
  immense game room where Mrs. Ware gave her dancing parties, with a garden
  terrace outside. There were also servants' rooms on this floor. They went
  through them all. Nothing doing.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan attempted to question Kinsey about her mistress' movements the
  night before, but the lady's maid became so upset he had to give over. They
  called in Adele to calm her. This Adele, a very pretty girl, was first
  housemaid. She had come into the household in the first place without Mrs.
  Ware's previous knowledge, since that lady did not care to surround herself
  with young and pretty maids. Cummings had engaged her.</p>

  <p>While Adele was bringing Kinsey around with smelling salts, Mr. MacKelcan
  decided that there was no help for it but to call the police.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">AT the same hour, in his little office in the Recorder-Press
  Building, Mike Speedon was sweating over his column. Few could have guessed
  the labor that went into the shaping of those screwy paragraphs, apparently
  tossed off with so idle an air. When he got stuck, Mike jumped up, took a
  turn between desk and door, and stretched to test his muscles. Hell of a job
  for a husky guy, he thought; writing these footling japes! By rights I ought
  to have an ax to swing!</p>

  <p>The telephone rang and he picked it up. A sweet, uncultivated voice came
  over the wire: "Is this Mr. Speedon?"</p>

  <p>"In person," said Mike. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Adele."</p>

  <p>Mike ran over a swarm of girls' faces in his mind, trying to fix the name
  to one of them. "Adele who?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She snickered. "Just Adele. You know, at Mrs. Ware's. Have you
  forgotten?"</p>

  <p>"Now I get you!" cried Mike. "Adele with the dimpled shoulders. So nice to
  bite!"</p>

  <p>She snickered again. "Oh, you!... I'm serious now, Mr. Speedon. Is it
  worth a ten spot to you if I give you an important piece of information?"</p>

  <p>"Depends upon its importance, darling."</p>

  <p>"It's important all right." After a moment's hesitation she went on. "All
  right, I'll trust you. You wouldn't let a girl down ... Mrs. Ware has
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Mike. "Disappeared? Where to?"</p>

  <p>"If they knew where she was, she wouldn't be disappeared, would she?
  Nobody outside knows it yet. Mr. MacKelcan has just telephoned the
  police."</p>

  <p>Mike had been a reporter before graduating to the features, and all his
  old instincts leaped into play. "Be there in fifteen minutes," he said.
  "You'll get your ten if you don't tell anybody else."</p>

  <p>He ran to the city room and spoke low to Warner Bassett.</p>

  <p>"Boy! what a chance!" said Warner. "Will you take care of it? Nobody else
  could get inside the place."</p>

  <p>"I'll take care of it," said Mike, and ran on.</p>

  <p>He took the subway, the quickest method of getting through town, and
  bettered his quarter of an hour by a minute or two. Cummings opened the door
  of the Ware apartment and Mike, seeing by the butler's forbidding expression
  that he was not going to be admitted, adjusted his tactics accordingly.</p>

  <p>"'Morning, Cummings. Can I speak to Miss Radnor for a moment?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Mr. Speedon." Cummings knocked on the door of the office, and
  opening it, announced: "Mr. Speedon." When Mike went in he closed the
  door.</p>

  <p>Day Radnor rose from her desk blushing pinkly. In order to divert
  attention from it, she said quickly: "Mike Speedon! You shouldn't surprise a
  girl like this!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Mike. Day had a way of taking him back.</p>

  <p>"It's not fair! So handsome and shining! You drop from the clouds like the
  Archangel Michael and my heart goes pit-a-pat!"</p>

  <p>"Ahh," said Mike, "I wish you were a little less frank in your admiration.
  Then I might think there was something in it."</p>

  <p>"I mean every word of it."</p>

  <p>"You do not. You think I'm a heel."</p>

  <p>The blush had faded and Day was herself again. She pushed the cigarette
  box toward Mike and seated herself at the desk. "Not a heel, darling, a
  phenomenon. Sipping honey from every flower. If I was a man that's the part
  I'd play too. That is, if, like you, I had what it takes."</p>

  <p>Mike changed the subject. "I must say you appear to be taking the
  situation coolly."</p>

  <p>"What situation?"</p>

  <p>"I hear that Old Miss has disappeared. Didn't you know it?"</p>

  <p>"No. Nobody in this house tells me anything...Anyhow, I don't believe it.
  You've been hoaxed."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so&mdash;judging from Cummings' face."</p>

  <p>"Then it's just some new publicity stunt."</p>

  <p>"We'll see. Mind if I set the door open?"</p>

  <p>"No. Are you afraid of me?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely."</p>

  <p>Mike opened the door wide, and returning to his seat studied Day with
  mixed pleasure and exasperation. She had a distinguished profile; she used no
  make-up except lipstick and her light brown hair was drawn back in a loose
  twist. After all the chi-chi she had a tonic quality.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, nobody here tells you anything?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They all hate me," said Day calmly, "not that I care. From the Madam
  down."</p>

  <p>"I can understand the servants," said Mike. "They're just spiteful. Why
  should the Madam hate you?"</p>

  <p>"She suspects me of being critical, though I never say anything. Perhaps
  it's because I keep my mouth shut."</p>

  <p>Mike chuckled. "If she hates you, why doesn't she fire you?"</p>

  <p>"Because, God help me, she knows I'm honest. Anybody else in this job
  could do her out of thousands without her knowing it."</p>

  <p>"You're too good for this crazy house. Why don't you fire yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Because I need the money, dear one."</p>

  <p>"You could always get a job, A girl like you."</p>

  <p>"Sure. But not at the same pay."</p>

  <p>The doorbell rang, and Cummings appeared in the foyer with suspicious
  suddenness. He cast a vicious glance into the office, but Mike was looking at
  him with a smile, and he did not venture to close the door. He admitted two
  men, keen, wary, stalwart, well-dressed; headquarters detectives,
  unmistakably.</p>

  <p>"This way, gentlemen," Mike sang out. "Use this room for your office."</p>

  <p>They came in, Cummings' face was black, but he was out-maneuvered; he
  couldn't say anything.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant of Detectives Radigan," said the first man, introducing
  himself. "This is Sergeant Hodges."</p>

  <p>"Glad to meet you," said Mike. "I'm Michael Speedon, a friend of Mrs.
  Ware's. This is Miss Radnor, her secretary."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Speedon is on the <i>Recorder-Press</i>," put in Cummings spitefully
  from the background.</p>

  <p>"Sure, we all know who he is," said Radigan.</p>

  <p>Cummings tried again. "Mr. MacKelcan, Mrs. Ware's attorney, is waiting to
  see you, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"Bring him in here," said Mike, and the butler was checkmated again.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan, having heard the voices, was already approaching through the
  foyer with his lapels flying. He was none too pleased with the situation as
  he found it, but Mike was in control. Everybody drew up chairs&mdash;Cummings
  being invited to sit with the others&mdash;and the investigation opened. Mike
  and Day, without giving anything away in their faces, learned for the first
  what it was all about.</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>Cummings said: "Mrs. Ware invited some of her friends on a hay ride last
  night as a kind of novelty ..."</p>

  <p>Radigan interrupted him. "We read that in the papers. Start at where she
  came home last night."</p>

  <p>"They got here about twelve-twenty," said Cummings; "Mrs. Ware and eight
  guests." He named them. "They were all in country costume, you understand,
  boots and jeans and farm hats for the men; gingham dresses and sunbonnets for
  the ladies. But it was so cold they had to wear fur coats over them. Mrs.
  Ware seemed upset ..."</p>

  <p>"What about?" put in Radigan.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't say, Lieutenant. I had no conversation with her. She went
  upstairs and I served drinks to the others. I and Alfred, the second man.
  Other guests came in. There were thirty-one in all; just a small party."
  Cummings proceeded to name them. He had a remarkable memory.</p>

  <p>"You were here," Radigan said to MacKelcan.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lieutenant. My client was kind enough to ask me to her social
  parties. Last night I had a bit of business to talk over with her, but I got
  no opportunity."</p>

  <p>Radigan fixed on another name. "Norbert Besson? Isn't that the young
  fellow Mrs. Ware is engaged to?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lieutenant."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't he on the hay ride?"</p>

  <p>"It seems not. He came in later. He was in ordinary evening dress."</p>

  <p>"Did he come alone?"</p>

  <p>"No. He came with Mrs. Payne Laval."</p>

  <p>Radigan whistled noiselessly. "Payne Laval! These are big names to throw
  around."</p>

  <p>Mike, unobtrusively taking notes in the background, put in: "I might say
  for your information, Lieutenant, it's a matter of common gossip that Mrs.
  Payne Laval and Norbert Besson are, well, that way. Have been for a
  year."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't advise you to print it in your paper," said Radigan dryly.</p>

  <p>"Not going to," retorted Mike.</p>

  <p>"Did Mrs. Ware know about the affair between these two?"</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," said Mike. "Who would tell her?"</p>

  <p>Cummings continued: "In about twenty minutes Mrs. Ware came downstairs
  again. She had changed to evening dress and put on her jewels ..."</p>

  <p>"Describe her jewels."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to ask her maid, Lieutenant. All I noticed was, she was all
  aglitter...When she came in Mrs. Prior went up to her..."</p>

  <p>"Who is Mrs. Prior?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Bethesda Prior. She... she ..." Cummings was at a loss how to
  explain her.</p>

  <p>Mike came to his assistance. "Bethesda Prior is the Mistress of Ceremonies
  around here, Lieutenant. She puts on the shows."</p>

  <p>Cummings continued: "Madam, I mean Mrs. Ware, was short with Mrs. Prior.
  She was angry..."</p>

  <p>"What did she say?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't near enough to them to hear. Mrs. Prior tried to smooth her
  down, but she got more angry, and people began to look. I went toward them,
  and I heard Mrs. Prior say: 'But we can't talk about that here, darling.' And
  Mrs. Ware said, very angry, 'I'm not your darling! Come upstairs and we'll
  end this once and for all!'"</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"The two ladies went upstairs. I accompanied them to the door of the
  elevator&mdash;I mean our private elevator, and my mistress said to me: 'I
  shan't come down again. Stop serving liquor at one-thirty, and let them go
  home.'"</p>

  <p>"Was that the last time you saw your mistress?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lieutenant."</p>

  <p>"And Mrs. Prior?"</p>

  <p>"In a little while, say fifteen or twenty minutes, she came down alone and
  went home without speaking to anybody. She was very upset."</p>

  <p>"Did <i>anybody</i> see your mistress after that?"</p>

  <p>"No, Lieutenant. Not as I know of."</p>

  <p>"Not her maid?"</p>

  <p>"She had sent her maid to bed before."</p>

  <p>There was a silence. Each of the six persons present was pursuing his own
  grim thoughts. MacKelcan broke the spell by driving his fist into his palm
  and exclaiming: "By God! this looks bad for Mrs. Prior!" The faces of the two
  detectives were like masks.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Prior telephoned about an hour ago to ask for Madam," Cummings
  volunteered. "I told her she wasn't up."</p>

  <p>"That may have been a stall," said Radigan. "What else can you tell
  us?"</p>

  <p>Cummings spread out his hands. "Not much, Lieutenant. At half-past one or
  thereabouts, I locked up the liquor and went to bed, leaving Alfred to see
  the last of the guests out, and switch off the lights." Cummings then
  described his search that morning for Mrs. Ware.</p>

  <p>"Whereabouts did the interview with Mrs. Prior take place?" asked
  Radigan.</p>

  <p>"In the private sitting room upstairs, Lieutenant. What the Madam calls
  her boudoir."</p>

  <p>"You're sure about that?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure. Standing at the foot of the stairs, I heard the door of that
  room close when Mrs. Prior came out."</p>

  <p>Kinsey's examination followed. Pretty Adele accompanied her to the door of
  the office, but as the girl was not invited to enter she had to go away
  again. The prim lady's maid had recovered from her hysterics. She was
  enjoying a certain feeling of importance now. The gist of her information was
  that Madam had returned from the hay ride all unstrung. She put her head down
  on her dressing table and cried like a baby. It seemed she had started out
  from the Monte Carlo on the hay ride feeling fine; had greeted the people in
  the streets and waved to them, but they only answered with bronx cheers and
  rude remarks. Somebody had called out: "Time you were home in bed, Granny,"
  and the whole crowd laughed. So they drove home as quickly as possible
  through side streets. Madam blamed Mrs. Prior for getting her into it, and
  said she was done with her. And a good thing, too, because in her (Kinsey's)
  opinion that woman was no better than a crook. She had spent thousands and
  thousands of Madam's money, and got a rake-off on everything.</p>

  <p>Kinsey went on to say that she had tried to soothe her mistress. She
  persuaded her to dress and go downstairs again to show everybody she didn't
  care. She put her in her blush-pink satin from Molyneux, freshened her
  make-up, and brought out jewels for her to choose from. Kinsey listed the
  jewels worn by Mrs. Ware; her diamond tiara with the emeralds; four diamond
  bracelets on her right arm, two on her left; her big diamond drop earrings,
  each having an emerald in the center; a ring on the third finger of each hand
  and an emerald and diamond brooch.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea of the value of these articles?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Madam often mentioned how much she had paid for them in my
  hearing. The emeralds were among her most valuable pieces. There's one in the
  middle of the tiara worth fifty thousand dollars alone." Kinsey borrowed
  pencil and paper from Day Radnor and made a list. When she handed it to the
  detective, he whistled.</p>

  <p>"Over half a million!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Kinsey.</p>

  <p>"All insured?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, only some of the pieces. Madam was careless. She kept putting it
  off."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't her attorney see to it?"</p>

  <p>"Madam wouldn't let him know how much she spent for jewels."</p>

  <p>"When she was dressed," Cummings said, "she told you to go to bed."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Ordinarily I lie down for a nap in the dressing room and give
  Madam her treatments whenever she comes in, but last night she said she
  wouldn't bother with her treatments because she was going to Madame
  Rubinstein's today."</p>

  <p>"And you didn't see her this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, sir. I never go in in the morning until she rings."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," said Radigan. "This young man she was engaged to, Norbert
  Besson, was he in receipt of large sums of money from her also?"</p>

  <p>Kinsey made a picture of outraged British propriety. "I'm sure I couldn't
  say, sir. You'll have to ask her legal adviser."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan flung up his arms without waiting for Radigan to speak. "Not a
  word! Not a word! I must plead professional privilege, Lieutenant."</p>

  <p>Radigan shrugged and turned to Cummings. "One more question. Did this man,
  Norbert Besson, have any talk with Mrs. Ware last night?"</p>

  <p>"How could he, Lieutenant? Madam went upstairs as soon as she came in, and
  when she came down again it was only for a minute."</p>

  <p>Radigan telephoned to Headquarters for two more detectives, a fingerprint
  expert and a photographer.</p>

  <p>"Now let's look through the rooms," he said.</p>

  <p>Day Radnor preferred to remain at her desk. The others accompanied the two
  detectives upstairs. They began with Mrs. Ware's bedroom, modernistic, a
  symphony in gray and chartreuse with a scarlet chair for a high note. The
  floor was covered with a thick-piled carpet, and Radigan made the others
  stand out in the corridor looking in. "A rug like this will keep the
  impression of footsteps for many hours," he explained.</p>

  <p>The bedroom gave them nothing important, and they proceeded to the
  dressing room adjoining. This was an unadorned chamber, surrounded on three
  sides by deep wardrobes, and having a continuous window in the fourth side.
  The whole room focussed on the dressing table, which stood with its back to
  the long window, spread with all its appurtenances like an altar. There was a
  wall safe in this room. The combination, written on a piece of paper, was in
  the drawer of the dressing table. The balance of Mrs. Ware's jewels were
  found to be intact, so far as could be established at that moment. There was
  also a box of keys in the safe; nothing else.</p>

  <p>During the examination of these rooms the additional men arrived from
  Headquarters. Detectives were placed at the front door and the service door
  of the apartment with instructions to allow nobody in the household to leave.
  Fingerprint expert and photographer went to work in Mrs. Ware's rooms.</p>

  <p>As the search proceeded from room to room, the tension increased. Nobody
  spoke. The last was the boudoir, a pleasant corner room with south and west
  exposures. Here the old lady spent all her time when she was alone, and she
  had refused to have any surrealist paintings or modernistic sculpture in it.
  The decorator had furnished it with beautiful pieces of no special period;
  the floor was strewn with priceless Oriental rugs. Mrs. Ware had never been
  seen to leave this room, and the observers looked into it with eyes full of
  dread. Kinsey was pressing a handkerchief to her lips.</p>

  <p>Radigan immediately placed his hand on a high, carved, oaken cabinet
  standing against the north wall. It was an ancient Jacobean piece, waxed to a
  high finish, standing on turned legs about four feet above the floor. It had
  double doors with long hinges and an escutcheon of wrought iron. A panel of
  antique velvet was thrown over the top. The cabinet was about five feet long
  and eighteen inches high. All stared at it, struck with horror by its
  significant shape.</p>

  <p>"What's kept in here?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>Kinsey answered tremulously: "Nothing, sir. It's just a showpiece."</p>

  <p>Radigan tried the door with his thumbnail. It was locked. "Where's the
  key?"</p>

  <p>Kinsey's jaw dropped. "Why... why... why..." she stammered, "the key was
  in it. I've seen it there hundreds of times!"</p>

  <p>Radigan beckoned to his partner. Each took an end of the cabinet and
  lifted it from the floor. It was too heavy to be empty.</p>

  <p>When attention was first directed to the cabinet, Cummings had gone
  downstairs. He presently came running back with a strong steel claw such as
  is used for opening packing cases. His face was livid and sweating. He handed
  the tool to Radigan, saying huskily: "Force it! Force it!"</p>

  <p>The detective inserted the point between the two doors of the cabinet and
  one flew open. Inside they saw a huddle of pale-pink satin; one elegantly
  shod foot; Radigan, hardened as he was to such sights, started back. The
  lady's maid screamed insanely. Cummings turned on her in a passion.</p>

  <p>"Quiet, you fool!"</p>

  <p>Radigan said harshly, "This can't be kept a secret now."</p>

  <p>Kinsey sank down fainting. Mike picked her up, and turning through the
  corridor, kicked open a door at random and dropped her on a bed. He shouted
  for Adele&mdash;the household might as well be roused now, and in ten seconds
  he was back in the boudoir.</p>

  <p>The two detectives were lifting out the pitifully twisted figure in its
  silken garments. They laid her on a sofa and straightened the stiffened limbs
  as well as they could. Her dress was partly unhooked and slipping off one
  scrawny shoulder. The sunken face was terrible to see. Cummings had turned
  his back on the sight, but the grotesque MacKelcan was staring as if turned
  into stone. There was no visible wound on her; no stain of blood. Her jewels
  were gone. Radigan examined her with a puzzled scowl.</p>

  <p>"Can't make it out," he muttered. "Looks as if she might have died
  naturally&mdash;she was old; then robbed afterwards and stuck away to hide
  the robbery." He produced a magnifying glass from his pocket. "There's a
  slight abrasion on the ear lobe where the earring was pulled off. It didn't
  bleed."</p>

  <p>Mike borrowed the glass and confirmed it.</p>

  <p>Radigan addressed his comrade: "Report it to Headquarters, Hodges. Ask for
  a medical examiner." He turned to the others. "Where does this Mrs. Bethesda
  Prior live?" Three voices furnished the address. "All right. After you've
  phoned Headquarters, go there, Hodges. Try to get her to come back with you.
  Tell her anything you like, but handle her with gloves. We've got no case
  yet. If she refuses to come, phone for further instructions, and don't let
  her out of your sight."</p>

  <p>Hodges went out. As Mike was making to follow him, Radigan said somewhat
  sourly:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're going to phone your paper."</p>

  <p>"Anything against it?" asked Mike good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>Radigan shook his head. "If I could conduct this investigation without
  publicity I might get somewhere," he grumbled. "But that's impossible. Go
  ahead. Only don't point the finger of suspicion at anybody yet."</p>

  <p>"I shan't," said Mike. "The story is good enough without it."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">LIEUTENANT RADIGAN was questioning Mrs. Bethesda Prior in
  the music room of the Ware apartment. Upstairs the various experts connected
  with the police department were doing their jobs. The body had been removed
  to the morgue for an autopsy.</p>

  <p>Radigan had a police stenographer taking notes, and Mike was sitting in as
  an observer. Through Mike, the <i>Recorder-Press</i> was still enjoying
  exclusive privileges. Radigan had been troubled when the main reportorial
  pack picked up the trail. "I can't let them swarm over the apartment," he
  said. "It wouldn't be decent."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," said Mike blandly.</p>

  <p>"But if I keep them out, I've got to put you out, too."</p>

  <p>"You can't do that," said Mike. "In the absence of family, I'm one of Mrs.
  Ware's most intimate friends. Why, unless the old lady was lying to me,
  you'll find that I'm a beneficiary under her will."</p>

  <p>Radigan gave him a look of suspicion that caused Mike to laugh and clap
  him on the back. "It's all right, old fellow, I didn't push her over the
  brink."</p>

  <p>Radigan was a good sleuth and a good fellow, but his mental processes were
  not exactly lightning-like. "If I was to favor one paper, the others would
  hound me off the force," he grumbled.</p>

  <p>"You can't help yourself this time. I'm in what they call a strategic
  position. But you needn't worry. I'll take care of the boys; and I'll play
  fair with them, too."</p>

  <p>"MacKelcan, the attorney, ought to be the one to say who ..."</p>

  <p>"I'll take care of him, too," said Mike. "Seriously, Lieutenant, I can
  help you in this case. I know all the people who are mixed up in it; I know
  their characters; I know their histories; I know their motives."</p>

  <p>"If it's only a robbery, I'll be taken off it directly," said Radigan.
  "I'm a homicide man."</p>

  <p>"It was murder!"</p>

  <p>Radigan glanced at him sharply. "What makes you say that?"</p>

  <p>"It smells of murder!... Look, Radigan, an old woman as rich as that,
  without any natural protectors, and so foolish and confused in mind, she was
  asking for it!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe so, but there's no evidence."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's wait for the report of the medical examiner."</p>

  <p>Now they had Mrs. Prior before them. Unknown to her, the police had
  obtained a warrant, and were searching her apartment during her absence. Mrs.
  Prior was a flabby-looking woman in her forties, not too well preserved. She
  was very expensively dressed, but without taste; the tall-crowned hat she
  wore was ridiculous without being chic. She was one of the unlucky women that
  the smart shops can't do much for. Her mouth drooped at the corners; her
  voice was flat; only her eyes were sharp and hard. She had enjoyed a kind of
  success because Mrs. Ware was so fantastically rich; behind her back the
  smart gang laughed at this would-be social director.</p>

  <p>She had not been told that Mrs. Ware was dead until she reached the
  apartment. Naturally she was upset, but she evinced no real grief; on the
  contrary, there was almost a note of satisfaction in her flat, inexpressive
  voice. Radigan watched her keenly; experience had taught him that a
  devilishly clever woman may take cover behind a stupid, foolish front. Mrs.
  Prior bore his scrutiny calmly. Mike, she hated, and made no scruple about
  showing it. The examination had been going on for half an hour, and Radigan
  had not yet tricked her into making any damaging admissions. She was now
  telling them how she had first met Mrs. Ware during the previous year.</p>

  <p>"I read in the paper that her husband died, and I made up my mind to go
  and see her..."</p>

  <p>"Without any introduction?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there was a connection. My sister-in-law's mother attended the same
  church as Mrs. Ware in Tarrytown where the Wares lived in summer."</p>

  <p>"Was your sister-in-law's mother acquainted with Mrs. Ware?"</p>

  <p>"No, but the same pastor called on them both."</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>"So after the funeral I went to see Mrs. Ware. I knew she would be
  surrounded with expensive flowers so I just took a single white rose and sent
  it in with my card. It touched her, and she sent for me to come up and we
  just talked as one woman to another. I told Mrs. Ware all about the death of
  my dear husband..."</p>

  <p>Mike rubbed his upper lip to hide a grin.</p>

  <p>"And she told me about hers. 'Now that he is gone, everything is ended for
  me,' she said; and I said that it was wrong for her to talk that way. She was
  one of the richest women in the world, I told her, and a full and useful life
  lay before her. 'Just think of all the good you can do,' I said. She cheered
  up a little at that, and we talked over different schemes of
  philanthropy..."</p>

  <p>"Which were never carried out," put in Radigan.</p>

  <p>"They would have been! They would have been&mdash;if she had not been
  taken!" Mrs. Prior touched a handkerchief to her perfectly dry eyes. "She was
  always talking about it! But she had been such a quiet home-keeper, she knew
  nothing about life, and I said before putting her money into anything, she
  must come out of her shell; she must go about; she must meet important
  people. At whatever cost to herself. Of course, this didn't all happen during
  that first talk. But we soon became the warmest friends!"</p>

  <p>"You have been receiving large sums of money from Mrs. Ware," suggested
  Radigan.</p>

  <p>"No such thing!" said Mrs. Prior sharply. "I never took a cent from Flora.
  Our relations were on the basis of pure friendship!"</p>

  <p>"Now, Mrs. Prior!" Radigan consulted some notes that Hodges had given him.
  "Charles W. Ware died in October and that's when you became acquainted with
  his wife. At that time you occupied a small flat in Jackson Heights costing
  fifty dollars a month. You kept no servant. In December you moved to 1075
  Park Avenue where you are paying two hundred and fifty a month, and employ
  two maids and a chauffeur. You own a Cadillac car. Where did the money for
  all this come from?"</p>

  <p>"I have private means," said Mrs. Prior haughtily.</p>

  <p>"You have helped Mrs. Ware to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars. I
  assume that you received a commission on her purchases. Be careful how you
  answer. I can easily check it."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Prior was indignant. "I don't know why you should take this tone
  toward me, Lieutenant Radigan. You will regret it later...What if there were
  commissions in some cases? Flora knew all about it. She said to me: 'Take it,
  Bethesda, you've earned every cent of it, because you don't let them
  overcharge me.'"</p>

  <p>Radigan took a new tack. "Let's come down to last night, Mrs. Prior. You
  and Mrs. Ware quarreled."</p>

  <p>"Unhappily, yes." The handkerchief came into play again. "Oh, it's awful!
  awful! to find her dead without having had a chance to make it up again!"</p>

  <p>"You suggested this hay ride to her?"</p>

  <p>The handkerchief came down quickly. "No such thing! I advised against
  it!"</p>

  <p>"Several persons have stated to me that it was your idea."</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you wish to believe the tattle of servants! All the servants here
  hate me because I keep a sharp eye on them. Flora was too easygoing."</p>

  <p>"Does everybody in this household hate everybody else?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Prior disdained to answer.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow, you quarreled."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't serious. We should have made it up today."</p>

  <p>"If it wasn't serious, why were you so upset? You ran out of the house
  without speaking to anybody."</p>

  <p>"Of course I was upset. I was tenderly attached to Flora. I'm a sensitive
  woman."</p>

  <p>Mike and Radigan exchanged a glance of dry amusement.</p>

  <p>Said Radigan: "Mrs. Ware was overheard to say in positive terms that
  everything was at an end between you."</p>

  <p>"It was Cummings told you that. He's a liar! You'd better investigate
  <i>him</i>!"</p>

  <p>"All in good time, Mrs. Prior."</p>

  <p>"Cummings is too big for his shoes! I distrusted him from the first. I
  warned Flora against him, but he managed to talk her 'round."</p>

  <p>"Where did she get him?"</p>

  <p>"Through an employment agency; Mrs. Sully's. Apparently he had good
  references."</p>

  <p>"How long has he been with Mrs. Ware?"</p>

  <p>"Six months. Cummings is a sinister character! Always watching and
  listening! Always trying to poison Flora's mind against me! A kind of
  Svengali. Made my flesh creep. Trying to gain the mastery over poor Flora,
  and make her do everything <i>he</i> said!"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't she discharge him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the truth is, though I hate to say it, but he <i>had</i> got the
  upper hand of her. She was always telling me what a good servant he was, and
  how grateful she was to get one who didn't drink to excess, and how he kept
  the other servants in order and all that, but as a matter of fact, she was
  deathly afraid of him. Why, sometimes he completely forgot his place! I have
  come upon him sitting down in her presence as if he were her equal!"</p>

  <p>"If Mrs. Ware stood for it, what of it?"</p>

  <p>"She was afraid of him, I tell you."</p>

  <p>Radigan fixed her with a hard-boiled eye. "Mrs. Prior, my belief is that
  you are only raising a dust to conceal the real issue." His forefinger shot
  out. "I put it to you that Mrs. Ware was dead before you left here last
  night!"</p>

  <p>She faced him out. "That's nonsense! She was well enough to stamp her foot
  and screech at me!"</p>

  <p>"I thought you said it wasn't a serious quarrel."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Prior changed her tone. "Poor Flora! She was so dreadfully upset
  about the way the people in the streets mocked her, she didn't know what she
  was saying!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not suggesting that you brought about, or even hastened her death,"
  said Radigan in a milder voice, "but that she had some kind of a stroke in
  your presence."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Prior was right back at him. "You <i>are</i> suggesting that I killed
  her! First you say I was getting money out of her and then that I killed her.
  Well, if I was making a fortune out of her, I wouldn't kill her, would I? You
  don't make sense!"</p>

  <p>Mike rubbed his lip. She had Radigan there. The entrance of a policeman
  saved the Lieutenant's face. The officer laid a penciled note before Radigan,
  and went out again. Mike tried to read the note upside down, but it was too
  badly written.</p>

  <p>Radigan said: "That will be all now, Mrs. Prior...And thank you for your
  assistance," he added sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"Am I free to go home?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I ask you to remain here until after a report is received from the
  medical examiner. If you insist on leaving, I shall have to provide you with
  an escort."</p>

  <p>"And what am I going to do while I'm waiting on your pleasure?"</p>

  <p>"There is plenty to read in the apartment. If you would like the society
  of another woman, Miss Radnor is in the office."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for nothing!" she said, marching out.</p>

  <p>When the door closed, Mike relieved himself with a chuckle. "She shifted
  her ground too swiftly for you, Rad."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yeah? If it had been you, you would have matched her, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that. Only one thing occurred to me while you were
  questioning her, but I didn't think it was my place to prompt you."</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you ask her about the old woman's will?"</p>

  <p>"What about it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, if Bethesda's down for a big sum in the will, and they quarreled
  finally, it would give her a strong motive for liquidating the old woman
  before she had time to change her will."</p>

  <p>"I have that all in mind," said Radigan. "I'm not done with Bethesda Prior
  yet by a damn sight."</p>

  <p>"What's written on that paper?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>Radigan turned it around and Mike read: "None of the missing jewels found
  in Mrs. Prior's apartment." Radigan said: "Of course that doesn't alter the
  situation. She wouldn't be fool enough to leave them around her own place. If
  she did get them, we don't know where she may have gone last night. That
  woman is a hundred per cent liar!"</p>

  <p>"Not a hundred per cent, Rad," said Mike. "Only dopes lie a hundred per
  cent. The artistic liar dresses up his lies with the truth. He keeps inside a
  twenty per cent margin."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN the police experts finished with Mrs. Ware's boudoir,
  Lieutenant Radigan took it for his office, since it provided more privacy
  than any of the downstairs rooms. Mike Speedon was with him. A bit of cork
  lay on the desk between them and Radigan was examining it through a
  magnifying glass. The cork had been found lying under the davenport sofa in
  that room by the police searchers.</p>

  <p>"I can't see that it means anything in particular," said Radigan. "There
  are corks lying around every house."</p>

  <p>"Not a house like this," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"I suppose the old lady ordered up some drink and the cork rolled under
  the sofa, and she couldn't find it."</p>

  <p>"That cork wouldn't fit any of the usual kinds of drinks. It's too
  short."</p>

  <p>"A medicine bottle, then."</p>

  <p>"It's too big around. Besides, the cork to a medicine bottle is always
  picked up...Let me have the glass a moment."</p>

  <p>Radigan passed it over.</p>

  <p>"This looks like the cork out of a whisky or a wine bottle," said Mike.
  "It has been cut in half by a very sharp instrument. Notice how clean the cut
  is. Unluckily, this is the bottom half. The top half usually has the name of
  the bottler branded in it. Originally this cork was used for a legitimate
  purpose. You can see the spiral hole made by the corkscrew. But there is also
  a transverse cut, a clean cut, across the top, made perhaps with the same
  instrument."</p>

  <p>"Quite a Sherlock, ain't yuh?" said Radigan ironically.</p>

  <p>"Well, corks are one of my specialties. What do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>Radigan shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Well, put it away with the other exhibits until the right clue turns
  up."</p>

  <p>Before their conference broke up, they had an opportunity to obtain some
  further light on the cork. There was a knock at the door, and upon being
  invited to do so, Kinsey entered. The elderly lady's maid had recovered from
  her hysterics, but when her eyes fell on the tall oaken cabinet, she paled
  again and swayed on her feet.</p>

  <p>"A glass of water?" said Mike, jumping up.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I'm all right." She refused to look at the cabinet
  again.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you, Miss?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>"There's something you ought to know," she said. "I don't know what it
  means, but you ought to know it."</p>

  <p>"Well, spill it," said Radigan.</p>

  <p>Kinsey went to the front of the room. On the right-hand side there was a
  kind of corner cupboard or whatnot, with a whole rank of open shelves
  decreasing in size as they went up. All the shelves were crowded with
  bibelots such as old ladies love to collect; miniature portraits, snuff
  boxes, ivories, porcelains and so on. Kinsey pointed to an object on a middle
  shelf that she appeared to be afraid to touch.</p>

  <p>It was a paper cutter in the form of a dagger with a <i>repoussé</i>
  handle in silver gilt. The design was of intertwined acanthus leaves; it was
  obviously a rare piece of craftsmanship of the Renaissance era.</p>

  <p>"What about it?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't there yesterday," said Kinsey hoarsely. "Madam wouldn't let
  anybody but me dust her things. I know everything that belongs here."</p>

  <p>"We took no special notice of it when we searched the room," said Radigan.
  "Among the other gimcracks. When did you see it first?"</p>

  <p>"When I was in here a while ago. But I was too upset to speak."</p>

  <p>"You haven't touched it?"</p>

  <p>"Not me!" cried Kinsey. "I'm not leaving my marks on it."</p>

  <p>"<i>Repoussé</i> work don't show fingerprints," said Radigan.</p>

  <p>Just the same, Mike took the precaution of using his handkerchief to pick
  the dagger up. "Good God, Rad," he said; "this is no paper cutter. It's as
  sharp as a razor!" He snatched up the magnifying glass. "It has
  <i>recently</i> been sharpened. Look!" Mike pulled a hair out of his thick
  thatch, and holding it up, sliced it neatly.</p>

  <p>"But the old lady didn't die by that," said the puzzled Radigan. "There
  was no mark on her!"</p>

  <p>"All right," said Mike, "it wasn't brought to this room for any good
  purpose, either."</p>

  <p>Radigan, seeing he had something more to say that he didn't want the woman
  to hear, bowed Kinsey out politely. "Thank you very much, Miss. I sure am
  obliged to you. I'll take good care of this here dagger until I find out
  whose it is."</p>

  <p>"Where's the cork?" asked Mike when she had gone.</p>

  <p>Radigan produced it from the envelope where he had stowed it, and Mike,
  with delicate fingers, showed him how exactly the point of the dagger fitted
  the slit in the top of the cork.</p>

  <p>"So what?" said Radigan.</p>

  <p>"The person who carried this had no sheath for it. So he stuck the point
  in the cork to keep it from cutting his clothes. Many's the time I've seen my
  mother do that with the points of her scissors to keep them from injuring her
  workbag."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"My guess is, that the cork worked itself off the point and the dagger
  slit its pocket and was lost."</p>

  <p>"How did it get laid on the shelf so neat?"</p>

  <p>"That's for us to find out."</p>

  <p>Cummings entered to announce Mr. Sanford MacKelcan, and the dagger was put
  out of sight. Cummings glanced at it strangely out of the corners of his
  eyes. Having made his announcement, he was forced to retire. His face had
  turned yellow with chagrin, as if his bile had overflowed. To be kept out of
  all these examinations and conferences, not to know what was going on, was
  almost more than he could bear. He had been ordered to attend the front door.
  The news of Mrs. Ware's death was now on the streets and all kinds of people
  were trying to get into the apartment.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan bustled into the room, talking as he came. He was always
  talking. With his small head, protuberant belly and elongated legs, he had
  the look of a stork&mdash;an aging stork when he perched his glasses on the
  end of his beak. He had brought Mrs. Ware's will. Seating himself fussily and
  spreading the document, he said.</p>

  <p>"I must warn you gentlemen that I can't guarantee this to be my client's
  last will."</p>

  <p>Radigan glanced at the date. "It's less than a month old."</p>

  <p>"That makes no difference. She was never satisfied."</p>

  <p>"But if there was another will, you would know about it, wouldn't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not. I have reason to believe she may have gone to another
  lawyer."</p>

  <p>"What reason?"</p>

  <p>MacKelcan cleared his throat deprecatingly. "It's a delicate matter! I
  mustn't betray the confidence of the dead!... You see, gentlemen, my client
  wished to take a certain course of which I strongly disapproved. We argued
  about it&mdash;she was a very imperious woman, but on this point, I
  <i>could</i> not give in, my conscience wouldn't let me! And so she
  threatened to employ another lawyer."</p>

  <p>"When was this?"</p>

  <p>"Three days ago."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's read this anyhow."</p>

  <p>It was a lengthy document since Mrs. Ware was in the habit of making all
  kinds of odd and capricious bequests and of canceling them as soon as made.
  This will already had seven codicils. There were three paragraphs of special
  interest to the detective.</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">I give and bequeath to my dear friend, Bethesda Prior,
  the sum of two hundred thousand dollars, over and above all taxes.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">To my friend, Michael Speedon, one hundred thousand
  dollars over and above taxes, because he is a gentleman.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">All the rest and residue of my estate to my nephew,
  James Fawcett, the son of my deceased sister, Emmeline Jones Fawcett, of
  Newcastle, England. It is my wish and desire that the said James Fawcett,
  after setting aside a sum sufficient for his own needs, should employ the
  bulk of my husband's fortune to establish a foundation for the support and
  education of orphan children of both sexes without respect to race or creed.
  It is my own intention to carry this out, and I lay this charge upon my
  nephew only in case I may be taken before my plans are matured. My nephew is
  to be advised in this matter by my friend and executor, Sanford MacKelcan,
  and such other persons as may be qualified to advise him.</p>

  <p><br>
  All the servants employed by Mrs. Ware were put down for various sums except,
  oddly enough, Cummings. Day Radnor was not mentioned. Mrs. Ware appointed her
  nephew and MacKelcan to be her executors, and stipulated that the latter
  should receive twenty-five thousand dollars a year for his services to the
  estate.</p>

  <p>When the reading was finished Radigan said dryly: "Congratulations,
  Mike."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Rad."</p>

  <p>"You don't appear to be surprised at the news," the lawyer remarked.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Ware discussed this will with me at the time it was drawn," said
  Mike.</p>

  <p>"Did you make any suggestions?"</p>

  <p>"Only one&mdash;but she didn't carry it out. I thought she ought to have
  named an institution, a bank or a trust company as one of her executors."</p>

  <p>"You lacked confidence in me, eh?" put in MacKelcan sourly.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. But in the case of so large an estate it's customary."</p>

  <p>"What did she mean by this 'gentleman' stuff?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," said Mike. "Maybe Mr. MacKelcan can tell us."</p>

  <p>The lawyer shook his head. "She insisted on having it written in that
  manner, but she didn't say why."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know there was a nephew," said Radigan.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Ware had never seen him," said MacKelcan. "Over half a century ago
  her sister married beneath her and went to England to live, and her family
  lost touch with her. When Mr. Ware died last year, this man Fawcett wrote to
  the widow and sent proofs of his identity. He wanted to come over and see his
  aunt. He was a very plain fellow, a coal miner, in fact, and at the time he
  wrote, he was on the dole. Mrs. Ware naturally didn't want to be associated
  with persons of that sort, and, in obedience to her instructions, I wrote
  sending Fawcett two hundred dollars, and telling him he could depend upon
  receiving the same amount monthly as long as he remained in England. It has
  been sent regularly. Two hundred would be riches to people like that, and I
  expect they have been living high. They have moved to London."</p>

  <p>"Sixty millions will destroy them!" said Mike.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it will be my job to see that the orphans get the bulk of it."</p>

  <p>"This Fawcett will have to come over now."</p>

  <p>"Surely. I'll cable to a lawyer in London with whom I have connections,
  and ask him to get the fellow off on the next ship."</p>

  <p>"Strange that Cummings should have been overlooked," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"I spoke to Mrs. Ware about that. She told me that Cummings himself had
  come to her that very day, saying he had heard gossip in the servants' hall
  that she was going to make a new will, and that all the servants were to be
  remembered. She told me that Cummings, almost with tears in his eyes had
  asked her not to name him. He had only been working for her a few months, he
  said, and if she should die, it would make talk. 'Wait till I have time to
  prove myself in your service,' he said."</p>

  <p>"Hm! Sounds a little too good to be true!" said Mike.</p>

  <p>There was a knock on the door, and Alfred entered. The young second man
  was badly shaken by the day's events, but nobody paid any attention to him.
  He handed a card to Radigan.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman said he wanted to see the detective in charge, sir. Mr.
  Cummings talked to him. Mr. Cummings said it was important."</p>

  <p>"All right. Bring him up." Radigan showed the card to MacKelcan. "Do you
  happen to know him?"</p>

  <p>MacKelcan glanced at the card calmly. "Keppelman? Slightly. He's said to
  be a good man."</p>

  <p>Mr. Keppelman was shown in; a prosperous, dignified man; he looked as if
  he had a nice little place at Greenwich, a son at Yale and a daughter at
  Smith. He seemed embarrassed to find MacKelcan in the room, but quickly
  concealed it. Radigan invited him to be seated, and he took a folded document
  from his breast pocket.</p>

  <p>"At Mrs. Ware's request, I came here yesterday to discuss drawing up her
  will. I had been recommended to her by the Washington Trust Company, where
  she banks. When she had made her wishes clear, I returned to my office and
  had it written accordingly. Yesterday afternoon she came to my office
  unexpectedly. She had thought of several changes and additions she wanted
  made, and the document had to be typed a second time. Here it is according to
  her final instructions."</p>

  <p>"But not signed," said MacKelcan.</p>

  <p>"Not signed. It has no standing in law. However, since the police have
  considered it necessary to investigate Mrs. Ware's sudden death, I thought
  they ought to see it."</p>

  <p>Radigan took the document. "By all means. And thank you very much for your
  co-operation, Mr. Keppelman."</p>

  <p>"Read it," said MacKelcan.</p>

  <p>Radigan did so. In certain particulars it was the same as the former will.
  Bethesda Prior and Mike Speedon were still to get their legacies.</p>

  <p>"This was before the ill-fated hay ride," murmured Mike.</p>

  <p>The servants were remembered as before, excepting Cummings, who was still
  omitted. The nephew, however, was now cut off with fifty thousand dollars,
  which Mrs. Ware had no doubt figured would continue to yield his two hundred
  a month. The estate was left to "my beloved husband-to-be, Norbert Besson."
  Besson was enjoined to establish a foundation for the orphans in the same
  words that Mrs. Ware had previously used. The executors named in this will
  were Norbert Besson, George Keppelman, Sanford MacKelcan and the Washington
  Trust Company; Keppelman and MacKelcan were each to receive twenty-five
  thousand a year for their services.</p>

  <p>When it had been read, Mr. Keppelman said: "Well, gentlemen, I feel that I
  have done my duty. This paper is of no further value now." He reached for
  it.</p>

  <p>"Don't destroy it," said Mike quickly. "You never know!"</p>

  <p>Radigan folded it. "With your permission I'll keep it for a while," he
  said to Keppelman.</p>

  <p>"By all means." The lawyer got up. "I'll bid you good day, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"Good day, Mr. Keppelman, and thank you again."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan unwound his long legs and accompanied him to the door. The tall
  man was extremely affable. "So sorry we're not going to be in this together,
  Keppelman. It would be a pleasure to serve with you in so worthy a cause.
  When I form a board of trustees for the Ware Foundation, perhaps ..." He left
  the sentence in the air. "In the meantime, you must send in a bill to the
  estate for drawing the will."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, I shall," said Keppelman dryly.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's that!" said MacKelcan, rubbing his hands together when the
  other had gone. "It appears that my will is okay. I must immediately notify
  the heir by cable. See you later."</p>

  <p>He went out. Radigan and Mike lighted cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"What the hell do you make of this will business?" asked the former.</p>

  <p>"Can't say offhand. It needs thought."</p>

  <p>"I believe these two lawyers are in cahoots."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"MacKelcan must have known about that second will beforehand. He never
  turned a hair when it was produced."</p>

  <p>"Why should he? He profits just the same under the one as the other."</p>

  <p>"Sure. And he must have known it in advance. Would Mrs. Ware have told
  MacKelcan that she was going to hire Keppelman?"</p>

  <p>"Not on your life! She would never face a disagreeable scene."</p>

  <p>"Then the two lawyers <i>are</i> in cahoots."</p>

  <p>"It's arguable," said Mike, "but I think you're wrong...Did you notice how
  put out Keppelman was when he found MacKelcan here? And that last speech of
  MacKelcan's when he was leaving certainly got under his skin. That doesn't
  look as if they had an understanding."</p>

  <p>"Then why should MacKelcan appear as an executor in Keppelman's will?"</p>

  <p>"It would be like the old girl to keep MacKelcan for an executor just to
  let him down easy. She was a soft-hearted old thing; didn't want to hurt
  anybody's feelings."</p>

  <p>"Can you dope out why she wanted a new lawyer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. MacKelcan had persuaded her not to name the bank as an executor, but
  she felt in her heart that I was right about it, so she sent for Keppelman.
  We've got to dig deeper, Rad."</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>Mike went downstairs, and on the pretence of inspecting the guard at the
  back door, passed through the service rooms, looking for Adele. He found the
  maid in the servants' hall demurely eating her lunch, but as the sharp-eyed
  Cummings had followed him back, he could only exchange a glance with her and
  pass on.</p>

  <p>He returned upstairs. Soon after, he heard a feminine voice casually
  humming an air on the other side of the door, and went out. It was Adele,
  making believe to be busy on the landing with a dustcloth. She smiled
  seductively.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Mike."</p>

  <p>"Hi, beautiful!"</p>

  <p>He gave her the ten-dollar bill he had promised her. "Look, girl," he
  said, "if you're smart you can earn more of the same during the next couple
  of days. See all you can, hear all you can, and keep your pretty mouth tight
  shut."</p>

  <p>She nodded. Adele belonged to the cuddly type. She leaned against Mike's
  broad chest and, looking up in his eyes, murmured: "I would do anything for
  you, Mike."</p>

  <p>Just at that moment the elevator door slid back, and Day Radnor stepped
  out. Adele jumped away, but Day's eyes had already taken in the little
  tableau and an amused smile crept over her face. Adele was still holding the
  ten-dollar bill between thumb and forefinger. Mike ground his teeth together.
  If it had been anybody else he wouldn't have minded, but Day's smile raked
  him with sharp points.</p>

  <p>She went on into the boudoir. Mike sent the girl away and followed.
  Radigan was busy with some reports at the far end of the room. Day was still
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"Damn it all!" muttered Mike. "Damn it all!..."</p>

  <p>That caused Day's smile to break into an outright laugh.</p>

  <p>"Don't laugh at me!"</p>

  <p>"But you look so sheepish! It's funny to see a sheepish look on
  <i>your</i> confident face."</p>

  <p>"It's not what you think. I pay the girl for doing a little espionage for
  me."</p>

  <p>Day pulled an aggravating face. "I'm so disappointed! I thought I had
  surprised something really naughty."</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe me?"</p>

  <p>"What difference does it make? You and I have no illusions about each
  other. Why can't we be natural?"</p>

  <p>Mike gritted his teeth again. "Sometimes I'd like to strangle you! Yes! To
  put my thumbs against your beautiful windpipe and press hard!"</p>

  <p>"But why, for Heaven's sake?"</p>

  <p>"You're too damn cool!"</p>

  <p>Day laughed again. "Maybe it's just as well for both of us that I am...Be
  yourself! I came up to tell you that the assembled reporters are waiting in
  my office. They say you promised them another statement at two o'clock."</p>

  <p>"All right, I'll be down," growled Mike.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">MIKE and Radigan were again in the upstairs sitting room
  when the report of the medical examiner arrived. The gist of it was that Mrs.
  Ware had died from natural causes. Her organs showed the changes and
  deteriorations natural in one of her age, and it was indicated that her heart
  had suddenly failed, possibly as a result of emotional excitement or shock.
  There was no wound or bruise anywhere upon her, and no trace of poison in her
  organs. The contents of her stomach revealed that she had taken a somewhat
  heavy dose of phenol-barbitol shortly before her death, but not in a lethal
  quantity. There was also a suggestion of alcohol. The examiner had been
  informed that she was in the habit of taking this drug to induce sleep. The
  bottle had been found in her bathroom.</p>

  <p>This report came by way of Police Headquarters, and with it instructions
  to Lieutenant Radigan to turn over the case to Detective-Sergeant Mahaffie,
  who would handle the robbery angle, in association with John Carpenter, the
  well-known detective employed by the insurance companies in such cases. Less
  than half the pieces of jewelry worn by Mrs. Ware were insured. The companies
  had listed the insured pieces and were offering a reward of fifty thousand
  dollars for their recovery.</p>

  <p>Mahaffie and Carpenter were already in the apartment conducting a search
  of their own. It had been established that none of the servants had been out
  since Mrs. Ware was last seen alive.</p>

  <p>"Well, robbery lets me out," said Radigan.</p>

  <p>"Rad, we <i>can't</i> drop it now," said Mike. "There are too many loose
  ends."</p>

  <p>"How can we go behind the medical testimony?"</p>

  <p>"A medical examiner is not infallible."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, loose ends? It seems clear to me that Mrs. Ware had
  heart failure while she was fussing with Bethesda Prior. Bethesda took her
  jewels and beat it."</p>

  <p>"Maybe so, but I doubt it. Bethesda's no fool. It would be too dangerous
  for her to try to get away with that. Such a woman wouldn't know how to
  dispose of stolen jewels."</p>

  <p>"Maybe she expected to stow them away for the future like a squirrel."</p>

  <p>Mike continued, shaking his head. "Mrs. Ware didn't swallow that dose of
  phenol-barbitol before she went downstairs, and when she came up she brought
  Bethesda with her. She didn't take that dose <i>until after Bethesda left
  her</i>."</p>

  <p>Radigan was shaken.</p>

  <p>"And besides," added Mike, "I don't believe a woman could have lifted the
  body four feet from the floor and stowed it in the cabinet."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you've got plenty of reasons," grumbled Radigan, "but I'm not through
  with Bethesda yet."</p>

  <p>Mike drifted around the room while he talked. "Maybe somebody else was up
  here last night. Mrs. Ware had a fire as you can see by the ashes. We've got
  to find out when that fire was lighted. Cummings' peculiar actions have not
  been explained. We don't know if he went to bed when he said he did. And we
  haven't even looked at the Norbert Besson angle."</p>

  <p>"Norbert would never have rubbed her out until he got his will
  signed."</p>

  <p>"No. But suppose he miscalculated. Suppose he had reason to believe that
  it had been signed? I don't believe the old lady seriously intended marrying
  Norbert. She knew he was a heel. It just flattered her vanity to put her
  brand on the number one glamour boy."</p>

  <p>"She put him in her last will."</p>

  <p>"She didn't take any of her wills seriously. Making wills was her hobby.
  I'm convinced that Besson saw her last night. Cummings was either lying or
  misinformed when he said he didn't. Besson had to be on his best behavior
  hereabouts. If he had come to the house and left again without speaking to
  his fiancée, she would have considered it a deadly affront, and he knew it
  ... Rad, I <i>know</i> somebody besides Bethesda was in this room last
  night."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Here's the old lady's chair by the fire. She always sat in this chair.
  Here's a little table beside it and on the table is a ring left by a glass.
  Here on the other side of the fire is another chair, with a little table
  beside it and on the table is the mark of another ring. You can't tell me
  that the old lady sat sipping her barbitol beside the fire, and moved back
  and forth from one chair to the other. There were two persons here, and it
  wasn't barbitol they were drinking!"</p>

  <p>Radigan eagerly examined the marks. "There was a glass found in the
  bathroom and it was still wet inside," he said. "I supposed that she took her
  medicine in it. Only one glass, Mike."</p>

  <p>Mike considered. "Suppose you wanted to have a drink with the old
  lady&mdash;and, by the way, she loved her toddy&mdash;suppose there was only
  one glass, and you didn't want to arouse the house, what would you do?"</p>

  <p>"I'd fetch a glass from the next nearest bathroom."</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" Mike ran out of the room. In a minute he returned bearing a
  glass in his handkerchief. "Here it is, still wet in the bottom, though that
  bathroom is not used. I'm afraid it has no fingerprints, though. It has been
  well washed."</p>

  <p>"You've got something there, Mike."</p>

  <p>"Look, Rad, the public believes that this woman was murdered, and you can
  see by the stories already out that the press is prepared to play up to it.
  I'm a beneficiary under the will and some of the dirt is going to stick to
  me. My enemies would never pass up such a chance to get back at me. I've
  <i>got</i> to solve this case, and I need your help."</p>

  <p>"You don't need to say any more. I'm with you."</p>

  <p>"Get the Inspector to accept this report publicly for the time being,"
  urged Mike, "and appear to drop the murder case. Then you'll have what you
  always wanted, a chance to investigate without any publicity."</p>

  <p>"I'll still have you looking over my shoulder," Radigan said,
  grinning.</p>

  <p>"All right. This is a personal matter with me, now. And I'm not going to
  let a peep out of me until the whole truth breaks."</p>

  <p>"Okay. I'll go down to Headquarters for new instructions. Couldn't phone
  stuff like this."</p>

  <p>"Let's go round to the morgue on the way and view the body for
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>The New York City Morgue masquerades as the Pathology Department of
  Bellevue Hospital, but a morgue under any other name is no less gruesome. The
  dingy building, in the commonplace style of most civic architecture, is
  neither old nor new enough to be impressive. Mike had become familiar with it
  in the days when he was a leg man, but he didn't like it any the better for
  that. He had the same old sickish feeling as they mounted the stairs to the
  autopsy room.</p>

  <p>In this wide, strongly lighted room another autopsy was now being
  performed. A pink-fleshed man was lying on a wheeled operating table with his
  feet turned up as if he were taking a sun-lamp treatment&mdash;but certain
  essential parts of his body which a man never sees were exposed beside him,
  and Mike hastily looked away. The operator conducting the examination was
  reading off his findings in a droning voice, while a student beside him took
  it down on a report sheet pinned to the board resting against his arm.</p>

  <p>The doctor who had examined Mrs. Ware was not on duty at the moment, and
  the pathologist in charge received them. Everybody had a keen interest in the
  Ware case. "Yes, she's still here," he said. "We're done with her, and they
  can take her away when they like."</p>

  <p>He gave an order and a sheeted form was wheeled up on another table; a
  pitifully meager form, strangely flattened against its hard bed. In this
  place the fabulously rich old woman was treated like any other clay. The
  awful contrast between Mrs. Ware dressed, beautified and jeweled for the
  cafés and <i>this</i>, didn't occur to anybody. The pathologist pulled the
  sheet down to her shoulders and Mike was obliged to look.</p>

  <p>"A very good specimen for her age," the doctor said with professional
  enthusiasm. "The trouble with her was, she couldn't be her age. The pace was
  too swift for her."</p>

  <p>Mike, looking at the pitiful remains, thought of Mrs. Ware as he had last
  seen her, all decked out and posing for the press photographers with a
  too-sweet smile.</p>

  <p>"Why did you want to see her?" asked the pathologist.</p>

  <p>"There are certain pieces of evidence that point to murder," said
  Radigan.</p>

  <p>The doctor shrugged. "Sorry to disappoint you. We can only report on what
  we find."</p>

  <p>Mike was asking himself the question, why <i>had</i> they come there?</p>

  <p>Radigan said: "I see the doctor hasn't washed the make-up off her arms and
  neck."</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't do that. It might destroy evidence. That film over her skin
  would reveal fingerprints if anybody had tried to choke her or twist her
  wrist."</p>

  <p>"And nobody did?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody touched her."</p>

  <p>"Now that you've got all the evidence," said Radigan, "would it be all
  right to wash the make-up off?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! Makes no difference now."</p>

  <p>The pathologist called to an attendant to bring a sponge. The powdery film
  came off easily enough except for one white spot on the under side of the
  left wrist. The attendant had to rub harder there. When it was removed a tiny
  bluish speck appeared.</p>

  <p>"A prick of some kind," said the pathologist. "She must have stuck a pin
  in her or hooked herself on a piece of jewelry when she was dressing. She
  received this, of course, before she was made up for the evening."</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," said Radigan quietly. "All the make-up materials were
  right handy. The damage to the make-up could have been repaired
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"What are you getting at?" demanded the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't that mark have been made by a hypodermic syringe?"</p>

  <p>"My God!" exclaimed the doctor. He called for a magnifying glass, and bent
  low to examine the tiny wound. When he straightened up, his face was white.
  "You may be right. The skin is punctured!... But there's no poison... no
  poison in her! I can swear to that. I checked the reagents myself!"</p>

  <p>"Aren't there poisons which are absorbed so quickly that no trace is
  left?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you hear of such things, but I never met anything of the kind in my
  practice."</p>

  <p>"Still, she <i>was</i> stuck with a hypodermic," insisted Radigan.
  "Why?... Notice that it's right on a vein."</p>

  <p>"A vein!" The doctor's eyes widened. "Oh, my God, yes!... I must look at
  her heart."</p>

  <p>Mike walked away while this was going on.</p>

  <p>He was presently called back. The doctor's hand was shaking. "I was
  right," he murmured. "When you said vein, it brought to mind our animal
  experimentation. When it is necessary to kill an animal, we inject air into a
  vein and the animal dies in a few seconds...That is what happened here,
  gentlemen."</p>

  <p>After a silence, Mike said: "There's your case, Rad."</p>

  <p>The detective's face was a mask of amazement. "But... but how would she
  have submitted to being stuck without putting up a struggle?"</p>

  <p>"That's where the phenol-barbitol came in. She was put to sleep
  first."</p>

  <p>"This will be bad for our office," muttered the pathologist. "You can't
  blame the doctor; he didn't find it because he wasn't looking for it. Such a
  thing has never been heard of before!... The publicity will be terrible!"</p>

  <p>"Say nothing about it for the present," urged Radigan. "I can do my work
  better without any publicity. Let the murderer think he's safe. I'll explain
  everything to the Inspector."</p>

  <p>Radigan and Mike proceeded to Headquarters.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">THREE-QUARTERS of an hour later, Lieutenant Radigan and Mike
  were on their way back uptown in a taxicab. They rode in silence for the most
  part, each looking out of his own window. A curious relationship was
  developing between these two; they were alternately drawn together and forced
  apart. They liked each other, and in the chase they were engaged on, each was
  indispensable to the other, but there was jealousy mixed up in it, too. Like
  all able males, each wanted to run the show. In particular, Radigan, because
  it was his job, was inclined to resent suggestions from a rank amateur like
  Mike.</p>

  <p>After they had driven for twenty blocks Mike said: "It's certain now that
  we have two separate crimes to deal with."</p>

  <p>"I think so myself," said Radigan, "but how can you be so sure about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"The murderer was clever and the robber was stupid; they don't fit. If it
  had not been for the robbery, the murder would never have come to light. The
  robber gummed up the murderer's game."</p>

  <p>"Well, our job is the murder; we can leave the robbery to Mahaffie and
  Carpenter."</p>

  <p>"No. We've got to keep the robbery in mind all the time, too. It is
  through the robbery that we are likely to lay hands on the murderer."</p>

  <p>"Well, you have your own ideas," grumbled Radigan.</p>

  <p>They got out at the Hotel Bathurst. At the telephone desk, Radigan asked
  for Mr. Norbert Besson, and they were presently bidden to go up to his
  apartment. Besson himself admitted them. Though it was four in the afternoon,
  he was still wearing a dressing gown, a fine affair of plum-colored brocade
  made in the style of the eighteenth century. It had cost some woman a pretty
  penny.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Mike," he said. "They didn't tell me there were two of you."</p>

  <p>"Mike is acting in an advisory capacity," explained Radigan, "as a friend
  of the family."</p>

  <p>"Whose family?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Ware's."</p>

  <p>"Didn't know she had any. Sit down, men, and smoke up."</p>

  <p>Mike and Radigan studied him covertly. He was called the handsomest young
  man in New York, and it may well have been true. Starting as a photographer's
  model, he had become a photographer himself, and subsequently the darling of
  café society. He had thereupon dropped the camera, and lived by his beauty
  alone. His profile was perfect; Grecian nose, short upper lip, a mouth that
  women thirsted for, and long dark lashes that gave his face a wistful
  expression. And with it all, the complete heel! thought Mike.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad we found you in," said Radigan as an opener.</p>

  <p>"Oh, naturally, I canceled all my engagements today," said Norbert.</p>

  <p>The complacent face expressed no sorrow, and Mike thought: "In spite of
  all the money she lavished on her favorites, the old woman has no
  mourners."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're investigating the robbery," Norbert went on. "It's a
  ghoulish crime, robbing the dead."</p>

  <p>Radigan did not enlighten him. "Sure is!" he said.</p>

  <p>Norbert looked at Mike spitefully. As with most male beauties, there was
  some of the cat in his make-up. "But I don't see where Mike comes in on
  this."</p>

  <p>"I'm down in the old lady's will for a fat legacy," said Mike, watching
  his face. "And I'm bound for my own sake to see that all mystery is cleared
  up."</p>

  <p>Norbert's smooth face showed no change. "Oh, has the will been read?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, by the police."</p>

  <p>There was a silence. The other two could see that Norbert was craving for
  some assurance that he had been taken care of, but they would not say
  anything.</p>

  <p>"Did you talk to Mrs. Ware last night?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>"No. She was so busy fighting with Bethesda, I didn't have an
  opportunity."</p>

  <p>"How is it that you didn't go on the hay ride?"</p>

  <p>Norbert glanced at Mike again. "If I wasn't going on record, I could speak
  more freely."</p>

  <p>"I give you my word that nothing you say here will be printed," said
  Mike.</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell you the truth, I thought it was a silly exhibition, and I
  didn't want to be seen on it. So I told Mrs. Ware my old father was coming to
  town, and that I would have to spend the early evening with him."</p>

  <p>"You have no old father?"</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of," drawled Norbert.</p>

  <p>"You spent the early evening with Mrs. Laval."</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you came with her."</p>

  <p>"We met by accident in the foyer downstairs."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you think Mrs. Ware would think it strange your leaving the house
  without speaking to her?"</p>

  <p>"That was up to her. I hung around the place for more than an hour after
  Bethesda cleared out, but she never showed up or sent me any word. I couldn't
  very well go up to her private suite without being asked."</p>

  <p>"Then you left with Mrs. Laval?"</p>

  <p>"As it happened. And others, too. The party was breaking up."</p>

  <p>"Where did you go?"</p>

  <p>"I came home here."</p>

  <p>"Could the people downstairs verify that?"</p>

  <p>"I doubt it. I never stop at the desk."</p>

  <p>"Which elevator did you use last night?"</p>

  <p>"Darned if I could tell you. There are a dozen elevators." Norbert scowled
  blackly. "Say, what the hell are you questioning me along this line for? Do
  you think <i>I</i> robbed Mrs. Ware?"</p>

  <p>Radigan allowed himself to look really distressed. "No, indeed! I know you
  wouldn't do such a thing."</p>

  <p>"Then what's the idea?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there is evidence that somebody was with Mrs. Ware last night after
  Bethesda had gone, and we have to find out who it was."</p>

  <p>"Somebody else with her, eh?" drawled Norbert. "That's interesting."</p>

  <p>"Where did you spend the early evening?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>"Took a friend to the theater...Wait a minute!" He got up and going to a
  closet in the entry, fished in the pocket of his evening clothes and brought
  forth two bits of pasteboard. "Here are the ticket stubs."</p>

  <p>Radigan looked at the date. "Okay." Then he sprung his mine. "This
  certainly is unfortunate for you, Norbert. You have my sympathy!"</p>

  <p>"What the hell!..." put in Norbert with an insolent scowl.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know that Mrs. Ware planned to leave you her entire fortune
  after certain bequests had been made. She died before she could sign the
  will. A nephew gets it."</p>

  <p>Norbert sat where he was, staring at Radigan. His face blenched to the
  color of soiled wax. His expression was clownish from shock. Several moments
  passed before he could speak. "How do you know?" he asked huskily.</p>

  <p>"We read both wills this morning."</p>

  <p>"It's not true!" Norbert suddenly cried out. His high strained voice
  startled his hearers. "I know better. She told me..."</p>

  <p>He jumped up and started for the windows, but pulled himself up and came
  back without finishing his sentence. He dropped back in the chair with his
  chin resting on his breast and his clenched hands pressed against his
  thighs.</p>

  <p>"What did she tell you?" asked Radigan softly.</p>

  <p>Norbert did not answer. The other two, watching him, dimly perceived the
  hell of disappointment into which they had plunged the soft, luxury-loving
  young man, and the necessity he was under of concealing it. Mike thought: For
  once the heel has to take it!</p>

  <p>Norbert made an attempt to carry it off. "Naturally it <i>is</i> a blow,"
  he said with a broken laugh. "Why should I try to hide it? You men can
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Radigan, without relaxing his hard scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"You'll be all right," added Mike.</p>

  <p>Norbert suddenly showed his teeth at Mike. All his jealousy and hatred
  flamed out. "Oh, I'll be all right, will I? You're all right as it is, aren't
  you? You got yours! What the hell did <i>you</i> do to earn your hundred
  grand?"</p>

  <p>Mike slowly arose. He said nothing, but his mouth hardened and his eyes
  were fixed. He took a step toward the younger man and Norbert cringed.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Mike ... I didn't know what I was saying. Forget it, old man."</p>

  <p>"Don't old man <i>me</i>, damn you!"</p>

  <p>"I said I was sorry."</p>

  <p>Mike relaxed and turned away. It took him a moment or two to cool off.</p>

  <p>"I want a drink," said Norbert shakily. "You fellows'll join me. We all
  need it. It's in the next room. I'll fetch it." He went through a door on the
  right, taking care to close it after him.</p>

  <p>Mike turned around. "There's somebody in that room, Rad."</p>

  <p>"Sure, I know it. When we first came in here the door was closed, and the
  next time I looked it was open a crack."</p>

  <p>"It's probably Mrs. Laval."</p>

  <p>"I don't doubt it."</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to throw open the door?" asked Mike, grinning.</p>

  <p>"Good God, no!" answered Radigan, with what was almost a look of fear.</p>

  <p>It was curious to see the hard-boiled Radigan betraying such compunctions.
  "Why?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>Radigan scowled. "Aah! Payne Laval's a big name around this town. It
  stands for something. It's respected. To shame the woman openly would be
  like... like... I can't explain it."</p>

  <p>"I get you. You're a good fellow, Rad."</p>

  <p>Radigan had gone to the desk by the window and with delicate fingers was
  turning over the papers on it. He said: "Stand by the door, Mike, and give me
  a sign if you hear him coming."</p>

  <p>Mike obeyed. "What are you after?"</p>

  <p>"Did you notice how he started for this desk, and then thought better of
  it. Maybe there's something here."</p>

  <p>A moment later Radigan drew out a sheet of note paper and whistled softly.
  "Here's a piece of evidence!" He hastily copied the note on the back of an
  envelope.</p>

  <p>"He's coming back," warned Mike.</p>

  <p>Radigan thrust the letter back in its pile and strolled away from the
  desk, putting the envelope in his pocket. Mike seated himself. Norbert
  re-entered, with bottles and glasses on a tray. He was bent now on removing
  the bad impression he had made before.</p>

  <p>"I got this Scotch from a steward aboard the <i>Caledonia</i>. It's the
  real thing. They don't export it. Take a good one, boys. What'll you have for
  a chaser?... Drink hearty! Here's to crime!"</p>

  <p>Mike and Radigan drank and got out as soon as they could.</p>

  <p>Going down in the elevator, Mike asked: "What's in that note?"</p>

  <p>"Wait till we're in a taxi."</p>

  <p>A minute or two later Radigan was reading his notes to Mike. Mrs. Ware's
  letter was headed five o'clock Tuesday (the previous afternoon). It ran:</p>

  <p>"My darling black-haired boy..."</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" put in Mike, "wouldn't that make you regurgitate?"</p>

  <p>Radigan read on: "'The new will is made, dear one. I have just come from
  the lawyer's office, and now I am settling down to rest and daydream about my
  boy. I am so sorry you can't come on the ride tonight. There won't be any
  pleasure in it now for me. I'd give the whole thing up if I could, but it's
  too late. Come to me later. I have a surprise for you. I'll be counting the
  minutes until I see you. Ever your own Flora.'"</p>

  <p>"Could you believe it!" said Mike.</p>

  <p>"No wonder Norbert was upset by our news," remarked Radigan; "to learn, if
  he <i>is</i> the killer, that he had killed too soon!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Ware apartment had now been combed from top to bottom by
  two of the most expert searchers in the business. The jewels had not been
  found, and this appeared to exonerate the servants. All persons who had made
  deliveries at the service door were being checked (in case the loot had been
  handed out) and the guests quietly investigated. Carpenter, the detective
  employed by the insurance companies, did not really expect to find the thief
  until an attempt was made to sell the jewels. He frankly declared himself at
  a loss in this case, because it was apparently the work of an amateur thief,
  and you could never tell which way an amateur would jump.</p>

  <p>Radigan and Mike now divided their forces for the time being. The former
  went back to Headquarters, where he had a lot of routine work to start going.
  He had to try to establish through police channels what sales of hypodermic
  syringes had been made within the past few days. The hospitals and so on were
  to be circularized to discover if the theft of such an article had been
  reported. The pathologist had told Radigan that one of the bigger syringes
  had been used, one with a capacity of 22 cc. or more. This narrowed the
  field. Radigan was also to order the sewer catch-basins in the neighborhood
  to be cleaned out, and the contents examined.</p>

  <p>Mike wanted to have a talk with Cummings. He had been struck with the
  change that had taken place in the butler since morning. Cummings now looked
  like a man who had received good news. His bile had receded; he was his own
  man again, directing the affairs of the big household with a firmness that
  brooked no nonsense. Mike asked him to bring the makings of a highball up to
  the private sitting room. When the butler entered with the tray, he said, in
  friendly fashion:</p>

  <p>"Forget your place for a while, Cummings. Mix a drink for yourself and sit
  down."</p>

  <p>The butler was not at all put out of face. "Thank you, Mr. Speedon. You
  are very kind." He poured himself a stiff one, added a little soda, and
  calmly seated himself beside the fireplace opposite Mike. Mike, studying him,
  wondered if he had been sitting in the same chair the night before. According
  to Bethesda's testimony, he was accustomed to sit down with his mistress;
  that, however, was only on the word of a spiteful woman.</p>

  <p>"Cummings," said Mike, "you knew your mistress better than anybody."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wouldn't say that, sir."</p>

  <p>"You knew her tastes, her habits, her associates. What do you think
  happened here last night?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid there's no doubt of that, sir. Mrs. Ware was struck down by an
  attack of heart failure and somebody, finding her like that, yielded to the
  temptation of stealing a fortune in jewels."</p>

  <p>"But who?"</p>

  <p>"I thought everything pointed to Mrs. Prior, sir?"</p>

  <p>Mike took mental note of a discrepancy here in the butler's story. If Mrs.
  Ware had been "found" lying dead or dying, it could not have been by
  Bethesda, because the two women had come upstairs together. Mike, of course,
  was not giving anything away. "Maybe," he said, "but what other possibilities
  are there?"</p>

  <p>Cummings took a swallow of his highball and considered before answering.
  Mike watched him without appearing to. He was an unusual type with his
  coarse, plentiful black hair, seamed features and foxy eyes. All his actions
  bespoke a man of powerful will. Why should such a one have entered domestic
  service? Mike was aware that he himself was being watched and measured.
  Cummings kept his eyes down, for the most part, but there was a deadly
  quality in his swift glance that warned Mike he was in the presence of
  danger. Mike thought: Whether or not he killed the old woman, this man is
  capable of murder.</p>

  <p>Cummings finally said: "I can think of nobody, sir."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: There are plenty of thoughts turning over in that crafty
  brain, but you have decided that it is safest to keep your mouth shut. He
  said: "Couldn't one of the other guests, Norbert Besson, for instance, have
  come up to this room?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see how such a visit could have been hidden, sir...I am convinced
  that my mistress died of natural causes," he went on with an earnest air; "if
  that is what is in your mind."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: You mean, you want to convince me of it. He said: "She
  appears to have had a fire here last night."</p>

  <p>"There's no significance in that, sir. The fire was always laid, ready for
  her. Kinsey mentioned that Mrs. Ware had her light it when she first returned
  from the hay ride."</p>

  <p>Mike said: "Well, I guess you're right about her death. We still have the
  robbery to deal with. Have you considered the possibility that it was Alfred
  who got the jewels? That lad acted very strangely this morning."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I noticed it, of course, but I laid it to shock. He is better
  now. If Alfred got the jewels, where are they now? He has not been out of the
  apartment, and he couldn't have provided for their disposal beforehand."</p>

  <p>"That seems to let him out."</p>

  <p>"I will take care of Alfred," said Cummings in a voice that caused Mike to
  glance at him quickly. The butler lowered his eyes.</p>

  <p>Mike took a new line. "What will you do now, Cummings?"</p>

  <p>"Me, sir? I hadn't taken any thought about myself. This has been a blow to
  me, Mr. Speedon. Nobody will believe it, but I was sincerely attached to the
  Madam."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: I wonder! He said: "Yet you were the only one of her
  servants who wasn't remembered in the will."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mind that, sir. That was by my own wish."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: Something fishy here! He said: "Well, what are you going to
  do?"</p>

  <p>"I would like to get away from it all, sir, but I suppose that's
  impossible." The butler's sorrowful words were not borne out by his eyes. "It
  is my duty to remain here as long as Mr. MacKelcan sees proper to keep the
  apartment open. I suppose it will take a while to settle things up."</p>

  <p>"I asked you the question," said Mike, "because I have a cousin who has a
  large establishment at Westbury, and I happen to know that she is
  dissatisfied with her present butler."</p>

  <p>"Very kind of you to think of me, sir, but I should not care to take
  another position right away. I have some money saved up. I'd like to travel a
  little."</p>

  <p>"Where did you work before you came here?"</p>

  <p>"I was for ten years with a Major Abbey, sir, a retired army officer, and
  wealthy."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Here in New York, sir. He was a widower without children, and a
  semi-invalid. Something over a year ago, his health got worse and he decided
  to try the baths of Europe. So he closed his apartment here and went abroad
  to live."</p>

  <p>"Where were you born, Cummings? You don't talk like an American."</p>

  <p>"In Australia, sir. I got my early training in Sydney. After the war
  things were so bad that I came to America to try my luck. Major Abbey was my
  only American employer."</p>

  <p>"I suppose he gave you a good recommendation?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir. I'm proud of it. I would like to show it to you. He
  said..."</p>

  <p>Cummings was interrupted by a knock at the door. Jumping up, he concealed
  the highball glass behind a vase on the mantel.</p>

  <p>"Come in," said Mike.</p>

  <p>It was the second man, Alfred. His appearance bore out Cummings' statement
  that he had largely recovered from his "shock."</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, sir. It's Mr. Cummings who is wanted. There is a man with a
  bill..."</p>

  <p>"Send him to Mr. MacKelcan's office."</p>

  <p>"I told him that, sir. And he said as it was you ordered the goods he
  would be glad if..."</p>

  <p>Mike wanted to get rid of the butler now. "Go ahead, Cummings. Okay his
  bill. You and I will have plenty of chances to discuss things later."</p>

  <p>Cummings and Alfred retired.</p>

  <p>Mike had a strong desire to delve further into Cummings' past. He looked
  in the telephone book for the number of Mrs. Sully's employment office.
  Office hours were about over for the day, but he took a chance on calling
  her. In addition to the house phone, Mrs. Ware had a direct wire from her
  desk to the exchange, and he used that. He got Mrs. Sully.</p>

  <p>"This is Michael Speedon speaking."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Speedon of the <i>Recorder-Press</i>?"</p>

  <p>"The same."</p>

  <p>The lady's voice warmed. Such is the power of publicity.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you, Mr. Speedon?"</p>

  <p>"About six months ago, Mrs. Ware engaged a butler through your office
  named Cummings. I don't know the first name."</p>

  <p>"I remember him. His first name is John."</p>

  <p>"I assume that he was well recommended. This is a question of getting him
  another position, you understand."</p>

  <p>"Extremely well recommended, Mr. Speedon. He had worked ten years for a
  Major Abbey here in New York. He also had some Australian references, but I
  disregarded those."</p>

  <p>"He had a letter from Major Abbey?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Speedon, a very strong letter. Cummings has the original, but
  there is a copy in my files which I will read to you if you wish."</p>

  <p>"Please do, Mrs. Sully."</p>

  <p>She presently came back on the wire, and read the letter. It was an
  enthusiastic testimonial, but it told Mike nothing.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, Mrs. Sully. Did you communicate with the Major
  personally?"</p>

  <p>"That would have been difficult, Mr. Speedon. He was living abroad, and
  anyhow, Mrs. Ware did not require it."</p>

  <p>"I see. Does that letter happen to bear the Major's former address in New
  York?"</p>

  <p>"He lived at Marbury Towers on Central Park West."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, Mrs. Sully."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, Mr. Speedon."</p>

  <p>Mike looked at his watch. He had a date to meet Radigan for dinner, but
  there was time to spare, and he decided to visit Marbury Towers in the hope
  that the house staff might remember Cummings.</p>

  <p>It was one of the huge new apartments on the West Side which are among the
  most magnificent in town, but which, for some reason, are considered less
  smart than those across the Park. Mike addressed himself to a deferential
  hall man.</p>

  <p>"You used to have a Major Abbey living here."</p>

  <p>"He lives here now, sir."</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>"Major Abbey went abroad for his health over a year ago, but the climate
  did not suit him. He returned to New York two months ago and took another
  suite in this building."</p>

  <p>"Please send up my name," said Mike.</p>

  <p>He wrote "Recorder-Press" in the corner of his card and it was phoned
  upstairs. The Major lived a very retired life and he could not guess how the
  newspapers had got hold of his name. He detested personal publicity, but he
  thought it would be safer to find out what the fellow was after.</p>

  <p>So Mike was presently admitted by a correct, elderly manservant, who
  conducted him into a study opening off the foyer; a man's room with leather
  upholstery, sporting prints, and the smell of good tobacco in the air. The
  Major, the wreck of a fine physical specimen, sat in an easy chair by the
  window with a rug over his knees. His dark eyes were resentful of his own
  weakness and his speech was blunt.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, what does the press want of me?"</p>

  <p>Mike liked him on the spot. "Nothing, sir. I wrote that in the corner of
  my card to identify myself. The question I have to ask you has nothing to do
  with my job. I was surprised to find you, because I had been told you were
  living abroad."</p>

  <p>"Didn't do me any good," growled the invalid, "and I preferred to come
  home to die."</p>

  <p>"Not for many a long year yet, I hope, sir."</p>

  <p>The Major waved this aside impatiently. "What's your question?"</p>

  <p>"You used to have a man working for you called John Cummings."</p>

  <p>"He's working for me now. He just showed you in here."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned!" murmured Mike.</p>

  <p>"Come, come, sir," rasped the Major. "I'm not interested in your
  reactions. What's all this about?"</p>

  <p>"Give me time, sir...I suppose you read the newspapers."</p>

  <p>"Of course! It's all I can do, now...What's on your mind?"</p>

  <p>"You're entitled to an answer, sir, but I'm going to ask you to treat it
  as confidential. In the public interest."</p>

  <p>"I must be the judge of that. Spit it out!"</p>

  <p>"You have read of Mrs. Ware's death. As a friend of hers I'm helping the
  police in their investigation. Did you happen to see in the paper that Mrs.
  Ware employed a butler named Cummings?"</p>

  <p>That caught the Major's interest. "Why, yes, I did. I pointed it out to my
  Cummings and chaffed him about it. But the name of Cummings is a common one,
  and we thought nothing of it."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Ware's Cummings claims to have worked for you for ten years. He has
  a letter of recommendation."</p>

  <p>"He's a liar!"</p>

  <p>Mike quoted a phrase or two from the letter.</p>

  <p>"That was in the letter I gave to the real Cummings when I let him go. Now
  I've taken him back again."</p>

  <p>"I get you. Somehow or other the false Cummings got hold of that letter
  and forged a copy of it."</p>

  <p>It was then the Major's turn to ejaculate: "Well, I'm damned!... I can see
  why you ask me to keep my mouth shut," he presently went on. "You want to
  build up a case against this scoundrel before he takes alarm."</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"All right, I give you my word. But for God's sake, young man, let me hear
  from time to time how the thing goes on. I sit here all day without a damned
  thing to occupy my mind!"</p>

  <p>"I'll do that, sir."</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>Mike and Radigan met at Bonifacio's, an excellent small restaurant on
  Third Avenue that had not yet been discovered by the mob. Mike let Rad
  satisfy his appetite, and then with the cigars, nonchalantly told his story,
  slyly watching the detective's sober, honest face.</p>

  <p>Radigan's eyes opened. "Good God! This is positive evidence that Cummings
  is a crook!"</p>

  <p>"Not a doubt of it!"</p>

  <p>"That puts an entirely new aspect on the case."</p>

  <p>"Sure. But how do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Cummings got into the house in the first place for the purpose of
  stealing the old lady's jewels, and killed her for them. A professional thief
  who never operated around these parts before. European, probably. He had his
  hide-out for the jewels ready in advance, and that's why they haven't been
  found. He stole out by the service entrance late last night and came in again
  that way. He used the stairs and so he wasn't seen. Any man would walk up
  twelve flights for half a million..." Noticing Mike's grin, Radigan broke
  off, demanding: "Well, what's the matter with that theory? Have you got a
  better one?"</p>

  <p>Mike shook his head. "Why should he have killed her? To hit her over the
  head would have been enough. And after he had succeeded in getting into the
  house, why should he have waited six months before pulling off his job? And
  why should he have stuck around after getting the loot?"</p>

  <p>"Ahh, you're always stuck on your own notions," grumbled Radigan. "Anyhow,
  I'm going down to Headquarters to see if we have his photograph."</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>Cummings' photograph was not on file at Police Headquarters.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">SHORTLY after twelve o'clock on the same night, Mike entered
  El Morocco, that highly publicized focus of glitter on New York's East Side.
  He could not neglect his job altogether; he had scamped one column, and
  somewhere he must find plenty of copy for next day. He was in a difficult
  position as regarded his copy; the Ware "robbery" was the topic of topics;
  but he could not say what he knew about it, and he had a professional
  repugnance to printing what he knew was not true.</p>

  <p>In addition to picking up general news, Mike knew he would find some of
  the people at El Morocco who had been at Mrs. Ware's the previous night, and
  he hoped with a few innocent-sounding questions to obtain new leads through
  the maze that confronted him.</p>

  <p>The long, narrow room was crowded from wall to wall; a haze of tobacco
  smoke rose from the tables, and a muffled roar of talk like the jungle after
  nightfall. A jeweled jungle, Mike had called it in his column, a
  scintillating stew; such phrases were a part of his stock in trade. Yet the
  place had elegance, too; the most exquisite women in the world were to be
  found there, dressed with supreme art; lovely, fragile orchids that made a
  man's heart ache. Also the women who lacked beauty and attracted attention to
  themselves by the sheer grotesquerie of their get-ups. These were apt to be
  more amusing to talk to. Mike enjoyed it as a man always enjoys the show in
  which he plays a leading part&mdash;but he was not kidded by it.</p>

  <p>He was hailed from table after table. "Hi, Mike!... come and sit down!...
  Give us the low-down, Mike!... Mike, here's a chair we've been saving for
  you...Mike, darling, you can have half my chair!"</p>

  <p>He perceived that he had acquired an increased importance in the eyes of
  the crowd through his connection with the Ware case. But there was something
  more in it, too, a morbid eagerness in the way some of the women's eyes
  fastened on him that he could not interpret. It made him uneasy.</p>

  <p>It was November and the season at El Morocco was in full swing. The
  elegant John Perona, an important figure in the social world, moved among the
  tables, not like the proprietor but an honored guest. A mere glance or the
  slightest gesture to his captains was sufficient to keep the situation under
  control.</p>

  <p>At a table near the door where he could survey all who came and went, sat
  the rotund and vivacious Maury Paul, dean of society reporters, better known
  to the world as Cholly Knickerbocker, with Nancy Randolph and Judy Robb,
  smart sisters of the press, at his table. At other points of vantage Mike saw
  Mrs. Rhinelander Stewart, most ethereal of beauties, and Mrs. Harrison
  Williams, the best-dressed woman present, who had no need to make herself
  look queer. Miss Elsa Maxwell, built low and wide, was the center of another
  laughing tableful, which included an Austrian arch-duke, a plain duke of
  Italian extraction and a Russian baron. Jerry Zerbe, camera in hand and
  focussing glass fixed in his eye, passed from table to table taking pictures
  amidst roars of laughter.</p>

  <p>A bar ran across the front of the room and here stood the stags looking
  'em over and watching their chances. In the distant corner of the room sat
  the visitors from Montclair and New Rochelle looking on wide-eyed. They came
  not to be seen but to see. The music was perfect but the dancing-floor shrank
  smaller and smaller as more people came in. Dancing only provided an excuse
  to hug your partner and sway in rhythm. There was no pretence of furnishing
  other entertainment; the famous customers provided the floor show.</p>

  <p>Answering the greetings from his friends, Mike made his way toward a woman
  who had not raised her voice but only invited him with a smile. She sat on
  the zebra-striped settee against the wall with a man on either side of her
  and a little table pushed up in front. It was the celebrated Mrs. Burton
  Fentress who was both beautiful <i>and</i> grotesque. She was swathed in
  eccentrically-draped veils of contrasting colors like Salome. Her face was
  made up dead white; her dark eyes were shadowed and enormous. She wished to
  give the impression of a woman swooning with passion, and many men fell for
  it. She was drinking champagne. Mrs. Fentress had been at Mrs. Ware's party
  and Mike knew that nothing escaped those seemingly sleepy eyes.</p>

  <p>"Darling!" she breathed, extending a white arm across the table; "I've
  been sitting here with my eyes fixed on the door waiting for you to
  appear!"</p>

  <p>"Darling!" said Mike. "This is so sudden!"</p>

  <p>"Move over a little," said Mrs. Fentress to the man on her left; "I have
  something private and particular for Mike's ear."</p>

  <p>He rose. "In that case," he said stiffly, "I'll be pushing off."</p>

  <p>"Come back soon, darling," said Mrs. Fentress with insulting
  sweetness.</p>

  <p>Mike took his place. Mrs. Fentress turned her gleaming shoulder squarely
  on the other man, and he, too, took the hint and moved away in search of a
  warmer climate. Mrs. Fentress pressed Mike's hand.</p>

  <p>"Darling, I couldn't wait until I got the real low-down on the Ware
  case."</p>

  <p>"Is that why you wanted me?" said Mike. "I thought it was my bright
  eyes!"</p>

  <p>"It is," she murmured, letting her dark glance convey the unutterable. "To
  me you are the Ware case."</p>

  <p>Mike felt vaguely uncomfortable. "I don't see why a jewel robbery should
  be so exciting."</p>

  <p>"Don't play the innocent kid with me, darling. I <i>know</i> it was more
  than robbery."</p>

  <p>"How do you know it?"</p>

  <p>"My hunches never play me false. Hunches are more important than
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"To a woman perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Everybody believes that Mrs. Ware was murdered. And what everybody
  believes to be so, becomes so."</p>

  <p>"The newspapers ..."</p>

  <p>"The heck with the newspapers. You are liaison officer with the press.
  They only know what you wish to tell them. I want some more champagne."</p>

  <p>Mike ordered it.</p>

  <p>"Well, if it was murder, I wish you'd tell me who did it."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Fentress merely smiled enigmatically.</p>

  <p>"You were there last night," said Mike. "Did you see anything
  suspicious?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm so scatterbrained, I never notice anything."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't fail to notice Norbert Besson, every woman's heart
  throb!"</p>

  <p>"Not mine!"</p>

  <p>"Just the same, you would make up to Norbert to annoy Maud Laval."</p>

  <p>"Don't be catty, darling."</p>

  <p>"Did he leave the party while you were present?"</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to hang it on Norbert? You disappoint me!"</p>

  <p>"Not trying to hang it on anybody."</p>

  <p>"Norbert didn't get a thing out of it! Norbert and Maud Laval were seen
  dining at the Bathurst tonight, and they were crushed."</p>

  <p>"I know. Answer the question."</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact, Norbert did leave the party. Maud also. From
  the living room I could see into the music room, and I was curious enough to
  look into the dining room. They were not there. I didn't see them steal away;
  they were there; they were not there; and after half an hour or so they were
  there again. I don't know where they went."</p>

  <p>"Did Norbert look upset?"</p>

  <p>"Norbert always looks wooden. His line is the strong, silent man. My God!
  Maud was glum."</p>

  <p>"What time was this?"</p>

  <p>"About a quarter to two. I went on to the Monte Carlo." Mrs. Fentress
  drained her champagne glass and pushed it toward Mike to be refilled. "The
  heck with Norbert. Maud can have her heart throb. I want a man!... Norbert
  was cut off without a cent but you got yours, darling! Why didn't you play
  for the whole stake? Sixty million! You could have had it. She bought Norbert
  for an ornamental neckpiece, but you she was really crazy about. She called
  you the last gentleman. Once when she was high, she was overheard telling how
  she had proposed marriage to you, and how you turned her down so nicely that
  she felt honored."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Mike. "Who started that story?"</p>

  <p>Amy Fentress laughed. "It's true! I can see it in your face! You think you
  know everything that's going around, but nobody tells you the stories about
  yourself!" She fondled his clenched hand. "Your fist is too hard!... What a
  man you are!" Her eyes narrowed. "I would enjoy being beaten by you," she
  murmured. "... Fill my glass and let's drink to us."</p>

  <p>Mike poured the wine, but stopped her from raising the glass. "Just what
  are you getting at, Amy?"</p>

  <p>She pressed closer against him. "Oh, Mike, I was so thrilled when I heard
  it today, thrilled to the marrow!"</p>

  <p>"Heard what?"</p>

  <p>"I am so sick of tame men! I adore wickedness! <i>Great</i> wickedness!
  You disdained her millions! What a magnificent gesture! I shall die of bliss
  when you take me in your arms!"</p>

  <p>With growing horror he perceived her drift. "You think that I?..."</p>

  <p>"Don't look so startled," she pouted. "It doesn't become you. Brazen it
  out! Brazen it out, and nothing can touch you!"</p>

  <p>"And everybody thinks?..."</p>

  <p>"They know it. By grapevine. What do you care? There's no proof. You took
  good care of that. How clever you are! I adore you!"</p>

  <p>So that was why women were staring at him with fascinated eyes. Mike felt
  a little sick with disgust. Hardest to bear was the pressure of Amy's
  shoulder against his arm. He would as lief have been caressed by a snake. But
  with half the people in the place watching him, he was forced to go on
  playing his usual part. He laughed.</p>

  <p>"That's the way to take it," said Amy. "Give me a toast."</p>

  <p>He raised his glass, "Here's the toast of the detective I've been playing
  around with all day. It's all he knows...To crime!"</p>

  <p>"To crime!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">AS soon as he got home, Mike wrote up his notebook. These
  notes were for his own future guidance, not his paper. His problems did not
  permit him to get much sleep. He went to bed sore and woke up sore a few
  hours later. By leaving Amy Fentress flat, he knew he had made a powerful and
  implacable enemy. She would undoubtedly whisper to all her intimates that
  Mike Speedon had "<i>admitted</i> it, darling!" Not that I give a damn, Mike
  told himself, but it drives me crazy that such a woman should be able to get
  away with it! She ought to be locked up with a diet of bread and water! As a
  matter of fact, Mike cared a good deal what people said.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock he was at work in his office in the Recorder-Press
  Building. He found it impossible to write a word about the Ware case. All he
  could do was to dig up some reserve copy that he kept for emergencies. It was
  none too fresh. Doggedly hammering it out on the typewriter, he was finished
  by eleven, and already correcting proof. Hamilton Wade, big boss of the
  <i>Recorder-Press</i>, came in smiling slyly. Such condescension was unusual.
  Nearly everybody around the shop jumped at his approach, but Mike was too
  sore; he merely looked up. He knew he was in for trouble and he waited for
  it.</p>

  <p>"Morning, Mike. Through already? Let's have a look at your stuff today."
  Wade's eyes were bright with an unholy curiosity.</p>

  <p>Mike silently pushed his proof across the desk. Wade ran his experienced
  editor's eye down the middle of it, taking it all in without reading it. He
  frowned.</p>

  <p>"Hang it all, Mike! The whole town is waiting today with its tongue out to
  hear what you have to say about the Ware case. And you don't mention it! You
  can't let us down like this!"</p>

  <p>"What can I say about it?" growled Mike.</p>

  <p>"What can you say? You're at the very seat and center of the whole thing!
  There is everything to say!"</p>

  <p>"I'm too close to it," muttered Mike.</p>

  <p>Wade held out the proof. "Honestly, Mike, do you regard this as good
  copy?"</p>

  <p>"No, it's putrid!"</p>

  <p>"Well, then, you can't afford to let it go through. You've taught your
  fans to expect something better. I appreciate your difficulties, but you owe
  something to the paper, too. Through the paper you lead a hell of an amusing
  life. Here's your chance to repay us. You're in a position to give us an
  exclusive story today. I give you absolute carte blanche to say what you
  please. Come out in your own person and give your slanderers hell! Defend
  yourself. I know you can put up a defense that will make them look
  silly."</p>

  <p>Mike jumped up. "Mr. Wade, if the hot seat was waiting for me outside that
  door, I would not use my column to defend myself! I'm damned if I would!"</p>

  <p>Wade was hardly accustomed to this. His eyebrows went up. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"It's too foul! To notice such lying gossip by defending yourself only
  inflates it, only keeps it going. My enemies are licking their lips while
  they wait to see what I'm going to say. Then they'd have me!"</p>

  <p>"I don't get your point of view," said Wade stiffly.</p>

  <p>Mike quieted down. "I get yours," he said, "and I'm sorry I can't fall in
  with it. The best thing to do would be to drop me out of the paper until this
  mess is cleared up. There are plenty of good men on the staff to pinch
  hit."</p>

  <p>"I don't care to do that," said Wade. "You are our columnist, and there
  are the syndicate contracts to be considered also." He dropped the proof on
  the desk. "Think it over. I can't make you write. You have a couple of hours
  before the deadline. It doesn't matter if you miss the first edition. It's up
  to you."</p>

  <p>When he had gone, Mike grimly okayed the proof and sent it upstairs. Let
  Wade kill it if he wanted to, and fire him.</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>Half an hour later, Mike was ringing the bell of the Ware apartment.
  Yesterday he had had only the curiosity of an amateur in this case; today it
  was different. Only by solving the murder could he silence the lying tongues
  and make his enemies look foolish. Alfred opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Is Lieutenant Radigan here?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. He's at Police Headquarters, I believe. Mr. Cummings can tell
  you."</p>

  <p>Cummings, hearing the voices, came out into the foyer. As always, smooth
  and watchful, he said: "Good morning, Mr. Speedon. I left the Lieutenant at
  Headquarters an hour ago. There was a jewel thief arrested last night, and
  the Lieutenant asked me to come down to the line-up to see if I could
  identify the man. But I had never seen him before ... Let me take your coat,
  sir."</p>

  <p>Mike suspected that there was more in this trip to Headquarters than
  Cummings was aware of. Radigan was concentrating on the Cummings angle
  today.</p>

  <p>In the living room, Sanford MacKelcan and a well-known dealer were taking
  inventory of Mrs. Ware's art and household furnishings. Cummings was helping
  them. Mike asked himself why the attorney hadn't appointed a clerk to do this
  tedious job, and the answer immediately presented itself. Because this gives
  him an excuse to stick around here.</p>

  <p>Mike lit a cigarette and watched the proceedings. He had no interest in
  the art dealer, but to see MacKelcan and Cummings together started him
  thinking. Both men were hiding something; they feared each other; they were
  too polite, too careful to avoid stepping on each other's toes. Both crooks,
  thought Mike, with this difference; MacKelcan probably knows enough about the
  law to keep within it. On the other hand, Cummings was the stronger
  personality; MacKelcan talked too much.</p>

  <p>The latter, with his hand on a tall Chinese vase, was saying: "Now this
  piece is excessively valuable. It's the delicate, biscuit-colored glaze that
  makes it so rare. Mrs. Ware told me there was no other vase of this
  description in existence outside of the Emperor of Japan's collection."</p>

  <p>The dealer was matter-of-fact. "Whoever told her that was pulling her leg.
  It's a good piece, but by no means unique."</p>

  <p>Mike, unable to deal with either man while this was going on, went back
  into the foyer. Moved by an obscure need of finding balm for his sore
  feelings, he drifted over to the door of the office and knocked. A calm voice
  invited him to enter.</p>

  <p>Day Radnor, in a crisp silk shirtwaist, was sitting behind the desk with a
  pile of mail before her. There was something in her natural and honest air
  that made Mike feel the world was not after all a completely filthy mess.</p>

  <p>"Still here?" he said.</p>

  <p>"As you see. There is more mail than ever this morning. Somebody must take
  care of it. My fate rests with Mr. MacKelcan. He has not yet spoken."</p>

  <p>"Got anything in view if he does speak?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing definite."</p>

  <p>"Got any money?"</p>

  <p>"Sufficient."</p>

  <p>"I'm fired," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it."</p>

  <p>He described the scene in his office, but the sympathy he craved was not
  forthcoming.</p>

  <p>"You're not fired&mdash;yet," said Day coolly, "and you won't be. The
  <i>Press-Recorder</i> is not going to hand over your column to the <i>Sun</i>
  or the <i>World-Telegram</i>. It's unique."</p>

  <p>"Ahh, you know you despise my column!" he said scowling.</p>

  <p>"I would if you took it seriously. As it is, I read every word. I think
  it's a darned good racket. It takes gameness and a sense of humor to get away
  with it. Those are qualities anybody admires."</p>

  <p>"I hate my job!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, your vitality is low. You didn't get enough sleep last night."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to see you're feeling so flip this morning."</p>

  <p>"What else can a poor girl be?"</p>

  <p>"Don't rile me any more," he muttered. "Already my teeth are worn down
  from grinding!"</p>

  <p>Day laughed&mdash;two silvery notes only. "You want sympathy," she said
  with the clear look that always stirred him. There was nothing flip in that.
  But it was gone immediately. "I can't sympathize with you. You've been too
  lucky. You have everything."</p>

  <p>"And you think for me to be up against it is good for my soul, eh?"</p>

  <p>"The heck with that stuff. I'm no soul doctor."</p>

  <p>"What <i>are</i> you?" growled Mike. "I wish I knew. I don't get you at
  all."</p>

  <p>Day, smiling, commenced to slit envelopes quickly and to toss out the
  contents. After a moment Mike got up sorely. Hearing the sound, she jerked up
  her head and was about to speak. But she caught herself and went on with her
  work.</p>

  <p>Mike went out, as sore as when he had entered. Adele was hanging about at
  the back of the foyer. She signaled with her pretty eyes. Hard to tell if it
  was meant to be amorous or conspiratorial. He went to her.</p>

  <p>"Anything new?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Cummings and Alfred had a quarrel last night. Up in Alfred's
  room."</p>

  <p>"What about?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't hear. It's up on the third floor and I'm on the second. I
  couldn't go up there without being caught."</p>

  <p>"That's not worth good money," said Mike. "You've got to get me
  particulars."</p>

  <p>Adele made her eyes soft. "I don't do this only for the money," she
  murmured.</p>

  <p>Mike made believe not to get it. He was off women today. "Well, keep up
  the good work," he said, turning back toward the living room. She had started
  a maggot working in his brain. Cummings and Alfred quarreling? It must be
  looked into.</p>

  <p>A bell sounded in the distance. The softly stepping Alfred appeared,
  making his way toward the door. Mike noted that the young man had lost his
  fresh color this morning. Alfred answered an inquiry at the door and closed
  it again. Mike intercepted him on the way back.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Alfred?"</p>

  <p>"Matter, sir? Nothing as I'm aware of, Mr. Speedon."</p>

  <p>"Been having trouble with Cummings?"</p>

  <p>A terrified look came into the second man's face. "Oh, no, sir," he
  stammered earnestly. "Mr. Cummings, he's an exacting man, he wants everything
  done just so, but he's fair. We none of us got any complaint against Mr.
  Cummings, sir. Oh, no, sir. We respect him."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: He protests too much.</p>

  <p>Alfred said anxiously: "Why do you ask me that, Mr. Speedon?"</p>

  <p>"No particular reason. But you look bad this morning."</p>

  <p>Alfred laid a hand across his middle. "It's my stomach, sir. I suffer in
  my stomach."</p>

  <p>Mike let him go. When he got a chance later, he tackled Cummings on the
  subject, "Anything new turn up about Alfred?"</p>

  <p>Cummings gave him a sharp look. "Nothing new, sir. Alfred is too dumb, too
  timid, to get away with robbery. I'm satisfied there's nothing in it."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: I'm not.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN luncheon was served the art dealer went away to look
  after his business, and Mike and Mr. MacKelcan seated themselves opposite
  each other in the dining room. At Mike's suggestion. Miss Radnor had been
  invited to join them, but word came back that she begged to be excused. It
  was an excellent lunch; a cup of green turtle, a pheasant with a salad; port
  de salut instead of a sweet; the whole washed down with a bottle of
  Montrachet that made Mike's stomach purr softly.</p>

  <p>Mike was amused to see MacKelcan acting the part of master of the
  establishment, giving orders to the servants and pressing this and that upon
  his guest. At such an informal luncheon for two men, there was no call for
  Cummings himself to wait upon the table, but the butler remained in the room,
  attentive to their every want. Finally, when the coffee was poured and cigars
  lighted, there was no further excuse for him to linger. He passed softly into
  the pantry.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan murmured out of the corner of his mouth: "I distrust that
  fellow! His eyes are everywhere! Have you noticed his eyes?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say I have," said Mike offhand.</p>

  <p>"Terrible eyes! I bet he's listening at the pantry door this minute."</p>

  <p>"He seems to have been devoted to his mistress."</p>

  <p>"So <i>he</i> says. I doubt it!" The attorney dismissed the subject with a
  wave of his hand. Tapping his glass, he went on: "That was a good wine! An
  excellent wine! I have a weakness for good wine, but unfortunately my
  pocketbook does not permit me to indulge often!"</p>

  <p>"It will be easier now," suggested Mike.</p>

  <p>"I don't gain anything by Mrs. Ware's will," MacKelcan said quickly, "if
  that is what you are referring to. Not a cent! Mrs. Ware has been paying me a
  retainer of twenty-five thousand a year since I first became her attorney.
  She said she wished to remove temptation from my path. Just her little joke!"
  Here the attorney laughed&mdash;it sounded a little too hearty in Mike's
  ears. "Indeed, I lose under the will," he went on, "because when I did
  special work for my client she paid me for it. Most liberally! And now, of
  course, I cannot expect anything beyond the twenty-five thousand a year. Ah!
  you're young yet and you don't know all the calls that are made on a family
  man! Not to speak of the little benefactions one makes without wishing to say
  anything about it! There is never a cent left for the old man!"</p>

  <p>Mike paid small attention to what MacKelcan <i>said</i> because he had
  learned that the attorney wagged his tongue, not for the purpose of
  expressing his thoughts, but to hide them. You learned more from watching the
  man, and Mike watched him now.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan dressed with a good deal of care, but somehow looked untidy. He
  put on a fresh white waistcoat every morning, and it immediately became
  wrinkled, because the waistcoat has not yet been designed that will fit
  snugly over a protuberant belly with a hollow chest above. His jackets were
  always much too big for him and too long, because he believed that it helped
  his meager chest and shoulders; his flapping pants only called attention to
  the extreme thinness of his legs.</p>

  <p>He was never still while he talked; he twisted first to one side of his
  chair, then the other, and flung his long legs about like flails, ceaselessly
  crossing and uncrossing them. His hands, too, were always busy about nothing;
  moving his wine glass back and forth, playing with a fork, grasping a lapel
  of his jacket, pulling down the waistcoat that wouldn't stay down. He had
  ugly hands, clay-colored, with warped fingers having spade-shaped tips bitten
  to the quick.</p>

  <p>Mike wondered if all this movement were not a kind of defense mechanism to
  distract attention from his eyes. His eyes gave him away and he probably
  suspected it. Small eyes, pale in color; a kind of dirty gray. Mike thought:
  I suppose they're what a novelist would call yellow. Yellow eyes! that's what
  they are! The yellow eyes never seemed to see anything; they were not still
  long enough; yet one got a feeling that somewhere behind all this flickering
  dwelt an unswerving will. MacKelcan was not an antagonist to be despised.</p>

  <p>He said: "I wanted to tell you the arrangements I have made." He said
  "arrangements" in a solemn voice like an undertaker. "Yesterday evening I had
  Mrs. Ware moved to Green's Funeral Parlors, and it was announced in the
  papers&mdash;just to put the public off, you understand. In the middle of the
  night I had her secretly carried to another establishment in White Plains,
  where the real funeral will take place on Saturday. Thus we will avoid a
  pushing crowd of curiosity-seekers in the street and all such distressing
  scenes."</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Mike.</p>

  <p>"I won't announce the funeral, of course&mdash;that would defeat my whole
  purpose, but if you will give me a list of her close friends&mdash;those to
  whom she was really dear&mdash;I will notify them privately."</p>

  <p>"Don't do it!" said Mike. "She wasn't dear to any of them. A lot of
  flatterers and spongers. Let the poor soul be buried in quiet with only you
  and I and Cummings for mourners."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan looked shocked. "Oh, dear, no! That wouldn't do at all! No! No!
  We can't have any secrecy about the obsequies. It would give rise to the
  darkest suspicions! You know what people are! Everything must be done in the
  open."</p>

  <p>Mike shrugged. "In that case I advise you to have her put in a receiving
  vault until the heir comes, and let him decide. He's her only relative."</p>

  <p>"You may be right," said MacKelcan, nodding his head. "I'll take it into
  consideration."</p>

  <p>"Have you heard anything from the heir?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>"My associate in London has acknowledged my cable. That's all so far."</p>

  <p>Mike considered how he could get past his defenses. "Mr. MacKelcan," he
  said, "this is the first chance I have had to talk privately with you..."</p>

  <p>"Keep your voice down," warned the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"I will...What is your theory about the robbery?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I leave that to the police. I can't follow the workings of the
  criminal mind. My experience has been entirely civil, entirely civil."</p>

  <p>"The problem teases me," said Mike. "I can't put it out of my head...At
  what stage was the party here, night before last, when you left?"</p>

  <p>MacKelcan switched around in his chair. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Were you the first to leave or the last?"</p>

  <p>The other man puffed out his cheeks. "Are you suggesting that
  <i>I</i>..."</p>

  <p>"Good God, no! I want you to help me place the other guests."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan cooled down. "The party was very distasteful to me. Most
  distasteful. The guests were drinking too much; some of them showed the
  effects. It made me indignant to see my client's hospitality abused. But I
  lingered on because I was hoping to get a word or two with Mrs. Ware. But she
  didn't come downstairs again and finally I gave up hope of it, and went home.
  I may not have been the first to go, but it was near it. I can tell you the
  exact hour. It was one-forty. I had been here an hour. Several other guests
  left with me."</p>

  <p>"Who were they?"</p>

  <p>MacKelcan named them. "We went down in the elevator together. The
  Bradstreets had a car at the door. They gave me a lift to my little house in
  Sixty-fifth Street. Very pleasant people."</p>

  <p>"Well, that lets out the Bradstreets and the others who left with you,"
  said Mike. "What about Norbert Besson?"</p>

  <p>"He was still here when I left. And that shameless woman, Mrs. Laval. I
  couldn't help noticing him. He hates me because he knew that I considered
  Mrs. Ware's association with him most unfortunate! and he didn't try to hide
  it."</p>

  <p>"Had he left the party during the time you were here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he had, now that you speak of it. But I took it that he and that
  woman had stolen away into some corner...I could easily believe that Besson
  was the thief, but why should he rob Mrs. Ware if he expected to get it
  all?"</p>

  <p>Mike wasn't giving anything away. "I don't know," he said. "But I don't
  want to overlook any possibility." He took a new line. "Did you know that
  Mrs. Ware had retained another attorney?"</p>

  <p>"What's that got to do with it?" MacKelcan demanded, at once
  suspicious.</p>

  <p>"I'm still thinking about Norbert Besson," Mike said with an innocent
  air.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan accepted it. "Yes, I knew it."</p>

  <p>"How did you know it?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Ware told me herself."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: That is certainly a lie. "When?" he asked, thinking to catch
  him there.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan corrected himself. "What I should say is, that she had
  threatened to go to another lawyer if I wouldn't give in to her about Besson.
  I didn't give in, and so I supposed she had. That was three or four days
  ago."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: You would have given in to her if she had wanted to make
  Beelzebub her heir. You always gave in to her in order to gain your own ends.
  He said: "But you knew the second will had not yet been signed."</p>

  <p>"I didn't suppose there had been time to draw up a new will and execute
  it. That was what I was waiting for on Tuesday night. To make one last appeal
  to Mrs. Ware not to sign any such will. I thought it my duty."</p>

  <p>Mike nodded as if satisfied. All right, old man, he was thinking, but your
  story doesn't <i>quite</i> hang together, and I'll take it apart before I'm
  through!</p>

  <p>Soon afterwards, Cummings entered to say that Mr. Dufresne (the art
  dealer) had come back and was awaiting Mr. MacKelcan's pleasure in the living
  room. The lawyer jumped up and ran out with his coat flying open. Cummings
  followed more soberly, and Mike was left at the table smoking and thinking
  over what he had heard.</p>

  <p>The pantry door opened a crack and he distinguished a bright eye in the
  aperture. Seeing that he was alone, Adele entered. Both her eyes and her
  mouth were open.</p>

  <p>"Did you know about this?" she asked breathlessly. "An extra. One of the
  boys just brought it up in the service elevator."</p>

  <p>Across the top of the newspaper she was holding up, Mike read in letters
  four inches tall:</p><br>

  <p class="headline"><big>MRS. WARE WAS MURDERED</big></p>

  <p><br>
  He shrugged. So the secret was out. Radigan would be annoyed at this.
  However, it was inevitable. No secret could be kept for long nowadays.</p>

  <p>He tipped Adele and sent her away. Reading between the lines of the story,
  it was clear to a newspaperman what had happened. One of the underlings in
  the medical examiner's office had tipped off the press to the mistake made by
  the first assistant, and when the chief pathologist was faced with a direct
  question he had had to tell the truth. It was all here now; the make-up on
  the old lady's arms; microscopic puncture; hypodermic needle; the real cause
  of her death. Mike could almost feel how the whole town was throbbing with
  the news at this moment.</p>

  <p>There was a sentence in the story that caused Mike to grit his teeth
  again. The writer made it clear as to whom he was referring:</p>

  <p>"In the light of this new development the name of a man has been mentioned
  who is very prominent in the night life of the city, and was closely
  associated with Mrs. Ware."</p>

  <p>This was a rival sheet, delighted, of course, to get back at one of the
  stars of the <i>Recorder-Press</i>. Mike cursed it from the bottom of his
  heart.</p>

  <p>As he cooled off, it occurred to him that he now had an excellent
  opportunity to observe the effect of this news on Cummings and MacKelcan. He
  carried the paper into the living room where they were still droning over the
  business of the inventory.</p>

  <p>"Look at this," he said. "It has just come."</p>

  <p>Cummings and MacKelcan were standing side by side in front of Mike as he
  held up the newspaper. Cummings' face grew as still as a waxwork; he lowered
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Murder! how terrible!" he said in an expressionless voice.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan became violently excited. "Murder!" he screeched, snatching the
  newspaper out of Mike's hands. His eyes ran like rats over the story. "You
  knew this already!" he flung at Mike accusingly. "You've known it since
  yesterday morning! Why wasn't I told?"</p>

  <p>Mike shrugged. "The police ordered me to keep my mouth shut."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan strode up and down waving the newspaper. "It is outrageous!
  Outrageous! That I shouldn't have been told!"</p>

  <p>"What difference does it make?" asked Mike coolly.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan, with a poisonous glance, suddenly shut up. Flinging the paper
  from him, he dropped in a chair and wiped his face. "Well, gentlemen," he
  said, assuming his usual busy manner, "after all, this is a matter for the
  police, for the police. We must get on with our inventory."</p>

  <p>Mike left the apartment with fresh food for thought; Cummings' terrible
  stillness and MacKelcan's irrelevant anger; what did they signify?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">MIKE left the apartment because he had some telephoning to
  do that he didn't care to risk in that place of snoopers and eavesdroppers.
  From a pay station he called up one after another, Mrs. Bradstreet and each
  of the persons MacKelcan had named as having left the Ware apartment on
  Tuesday night at the same time he did. Each corroborated MacKelcan's story,
  and Mike was faced with another dead end.</p>

  <p>He proceeded to the Hotel Bathurst and had no luck there, either. Norbert
  Besson was out&mdash;or at any rate Mike was told that he was out. Mike then
  taxied downtown to the Equitable Building to see Mr. Keppelman. Here he
  picked up an interesting bit of news, though it did not advance his case
  much.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Keppelman, when the question was put to him. "I noticed myself
  that MacKelcan seemed to have advance information about the will I drew up
  for Mrs. Ware, and as soon as I got back to my office I started an inquiry. I
  am sorry to say I discovered that MacKelcan had been tampering with one of my
  clerks. I have discharged her, of course."</p>

  <p>"Did your clerk know that the will had not been signed?"</p>

  <p>"She could not have known that."</p>

  <p>"How could MacKelcan have learned so quickly that Mrs. Ware had sent for
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I have reason to believe that he had a spy in the bank. It was the bank,
  you will remember, that recommended me to Mrs. Ware. MacKelcan probably knew
  that I would be sent for before I knew it myself."</p>

  <p>"What is his professional reputation?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>"He can scarcely be said to have any. His business is of such a nature
  that nobody knows anything about it...Don't misunderstand me. It is a very
  choice business. God knows how he secures it! Such an ignorant man!"</p>

  <p>"But pertinacious."</p>

  <p>When he had left Mr. Keppelman, Mike, according to his custom, called up
  the office to ask if there was anything for him. There was a memo, he was
  told, asking him to call Lieutenant Radigan at Police Headquarters as soon as
  he received it. Mike dialed Headquarters, and when he got Radigan, heard a
  new hardness in the Lieutenant's voice that caused him to stiffen.</p>

  <p>"You wanted me to call you, Rad?"</p>

  <p>"Sure...Where you been all day?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, around. I've got a job, you know."</p>

  <p>"Where you calling from now?"</p>

  <p>"Cigar store, Equitable Building."</p>

  <p>"Can you come around to Headquarters to talk things over?"</p>

  <p>"Surely."</p>

  <p>"Okay. I'll be waiting for you in the main entrance hall."</p>

  <p>In ten minutes Mike was in Center Street. Several press photographers were
  loitering outside Headquarters. "Wait a minute, Mike," they cried. "Look this
  way!... Hold your head up!" Mike stalked on with a set jaw. In the past he
  had always had a fellow-feeling for the press photographers; they had a
  thankless job which they performed gamely. But now he longed to smash their
  damned cameras. It makes a difference whose ox is gored.</p>

  <p>Inside the building, Radigan, waiting at the top of the steps, greeted him
  with the sardonic friendliness that characterizes the New York cop in dealing
  with the criminal classes. The change in his manner made Mike sore because he
  liked the man; but what the hell. Mike steeled himself for trouble. Radigan
  led him to the elevator.</p>

  <p>"Where we going?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Stillson's office. Inspector wants to hear your ideas on the
  case."</p>

  <p>Stillson was the chief of the detective force and Mike knew him of old. He
  was the kind of officer who presents a handsome front to the world and is in
  no danger of getting nervous prostration through overwork. He greeted Mike
  with a heavily facetious air that warned him afresh he was a suspected
  person. "H'are yeh, Mike! Sit down and light up."</p>

  <p>Mike obeyed, waiting for a lead. Out of the tail of his eye he could see
  Radigan, seated on his right, watching him with a scowl. Once a suspicion was
  planted in that slow-moving mind, whatever Mike did would only confirm it,
  and Mike, knowing it, felt reckless.</p>

  <p>The Inspector went on with his jocose air: "They're saying around town
  that it was you gave old lady Ware the air."</p>

  <p>"So I hear," said Mike coolly. "Who started the story?"</p>

  <p>"I was hoping you could tell me."</p>

  <p>Mike shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Trouble is, you've been getting too much publicity," said the Inspector
  sententiously. "Comes a point where it sours on a celebrity. Look at
  Lindbergh. You're getting the reverse publicity now."</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me?" said Mike.</p>

  <p>The Inspector suddenly changed his tone. "Do you know a girl at Mrs.
  Ware's called Adele?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! Damn pretty girl."</p>

  <p>"So they tell me. You've got an eye for beauty, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"I hope it may never fail me."</p>

  <p>Mike's flippancy annoyed the officers. They looked on that as their
  perquisite. The Inspector's forefinger shot out. "That girl is in your pay!"
  he rasped.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" said Mike, running up his eyebrows. "Why the excitement?... Since
  yesterday morning only," he added pointedly, "She called me up at my office
  to tell me Mrs. Ware was missing, and was the information worth a ten spot to
  me? I'm a newspaperman. I was glad to give her the money, and to offer her
  the same for other bits of exclusive information."</p>

  <p>"That's all right if that was all. But it started before yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Oh, a kiss behind the door," said Mike. "I'd do that for any pretty
  girl."</p>

  <p>"Where there's smoke there's fire," said the Inspector heavily. "What the
  whole town is saying can't be wrong. I advise you to take this more serious,
  Mike."</p>

  <p>"I can't, Inspector. Why, if I was mixed up in this old woman's death,
  would I be spending all my waking hours trying to solve the mystery?"</p>

  <p>"It's a clever dodge. Wouldn't be the first time it was tried on."</p>

  <p>"Ask Radigan if I haven't worked hard on this case."</p>

  <p>"I have asked him."</p>

  <p>"You know a lot more about it than you ever told me," growled Radigan.</p>

  <p>"Well, there are things that a man doesn't tell anybody. But I was on the
  square with you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yeah?"</p>

  <p>"In the beginning, you were convinced that the woman died from natural
  causes; you all were. It was I who kept the case open."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you were smart," said Radigan bitterly. "Nobody would deny that!"</p>

  <p>"This is just foolishness," said Mike. "There is no evidence."</p>

  <p>"We have evidence," said the Inspector grimly.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"All in good time. You might tell us first what you were doing Tuesday
  night."</p>

  <p>"Sure. I attended the Sloan dinner at the St. Regis. Left at ten o'clock.
  Saw the last act of the Gilbert Miller first night at the Booth. Then to Jack
  and Charlie's and to the Stork Club. Talked with people at both places.
  Joined the Paley's party at El Morocco at twelve-thirty."</p>

  <p>"How long did you stay with them?"</p>

  <p>"About an hour."</p>

  <p>"What time did you get home?"</p>

  <p>"About three-thirty."</p>

  <p>The Inspector smiled disagreeably. "And between one-thirty and
  three-thirty?"</p>

  <p>"That's my affair," said Mike. "I could lie to you but I won't. I'm not
  going to say anything."</p>

  <p>"Sure, sure," said the Inspector, with heavy sarcasm. Always the
  gentleman, of course. Can't divulge the lady's name...It's not good enough,
  Mike. On Tuesday night at one forty-five you were seen entering the service
  door of the building where Mrs. Ware's apartment is."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," said Mike. "At one forty-five I was much more agreeably
  engaged."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to prove it."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, you'll have to prove that I wasn't...Who told you I
  entered that house?"</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for information, Mike, not handing it out."</p>

  <p>Mike smiled. "That means you don't know. It was an anonymous tip; over the
  phone, I take it. And I bet I know where it came from."</p>

  <p>"I'm not saying whether it was or not," said the Inspector. "You're
  familiar with police work; you know that tips are always valuable to us."</p>

  <p>"Sure. But anonymous tips are not evidence. You've got to dig up
  corroboration. I wish you luck of it."</p>

  <p>The inspectorial forefinger shot out again, and for a while they had it
  back and forth, hammer and tongs. Mike had no difficulty in keeping up his
  end; he had seen too many poor devils subjected to this sort of bulldozing.
  He knew the technique. Moreover, it was clear that the Inspector had not even
  a phony case against him. Finally Stillson, very red in the face, said:</p>

  <p>"That's all now."</p>

  <p>"Am I under arrest?" asked Mike ironically.</p>

  <p>"Don't try to play with me," rasped the Inspector, "or you soon will
  be!... I'll talk to you again tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Mike took out his little book. "At what hour?" he asked politely.</p>

  <p>The Inspector struck his desk. "Any time I please, see?"</p>

  <p>Mike left the office smiling&mdash;and inwardly wild with rage. There were
  some reporters hanging about downstairs. They waited for him with curious
  expressions, half friendly, half derisive. It was a novel experience for them
  to interview one of themselves in this building.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Mike! What's the dope?... We're for you, Mike. They haven't got
  anything on you or you wouldn't be walking out alone...Tell us your side of
  it, Mike."</p>

  <p>Mike knew very well that it would be the part of wisdom to pause and chat
  with them. They were disposed to be friendly. But he couldn't do it; he was
  too full of rage against the world. "Sorry, fellows, nothing to say," he
  muttered, pushing through them. He never looked around, but he could picture
  their meaning grins behind his back.</p>

  <p>Hailing a cab in the street, he had himself driven to his own flat. It
  didn't lessen his rage any to find a detective loitering across the street.
  It was not a man that Mike knew, but with his neat, sober dress, cagey eyes
  and broad-soled shoes, it was impossible to mistake him for other than he
  was.</p>

  <p>Mike, who disliked hotels, had found a retreat after his own heart in a
  dignified Victorian dwelling on Lexington Avenue in the Murray Hill district.
  He occupied the rear of the first floor and a couple of additional rooms in
  the basement. Here he lived in great comfort, surrounded by his own Early
  Victorian treasures, and waited upon (when he desired it) by the adoring
  Takaku, who looked on Mike as the king of men. There was no elevator in the
  old house, and no hallboy to spy on the tenants. The rooms were somewhat
  unconventionally arranged, because you entered the bedroom and passed through
  it into the long living room which occupied a rear extension to the original
  building. It had a fireplace and the view of an ailanthus tree in the yard.
  Downstairs, there was a kitchen and dining room, so that Mike was able to
  give a little dinner at home when he had a mind to.</p>

  <p>Takaku was a treasure. Valet, butler, cook, he was equal to any emergency.
  The arrangement that Mike had with him suited both to a T. Takaku kept a
  little store on Madison Avenue where he sold Japanese art and curios, but
  since the Japanese had become so unpopular, business had fallen away, and the
  little man was very thankful for the stipend that Mike paid him. He came
  every day at noon to clean up the place and see to Mike's clothes, and
  departed a couple of hours later. But he was always available for additional
  time when Mike wanted him.</p>

  <p>They didn't meet often, but kept up a regular correspondence through the
  medium of the typewriter on Mike's desk. Mike wrote out his instructions for
  Takaku and left them in the machine; and Takaku left his answer in the
  machine when any was required. Takaku was the master of a picturesque style.
  His spelling was perfect because he always had a dictionary in his pocket.
  From dictionary and newspapers, he had acquired an extensive vocabulary, but
  his notions of English syntax were a little sketchy. There was a letter in
  the machine now.</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">Mr. Mike Sir</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Please, so-called lady come today. Insert herself
  through door. I hesitate throw out because if woman make great cry, what they
  do to Japanese man? Claim she sent by Star newspaper. Ask multitude
  questions; I make out dumb. She walk through rooms, look at everything and
  write down. But I not let her open any drawers. Over my dead body, I say.
  Please, if your Honor extend approval, I order chain put on door.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Your obedient servant,</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Takaku.</p>

  <p><br>
  Mike, in a rage, reached for the telephone. He knew the city editor of the
  <i>Star</i> tabloid, and he felt that it would be a pleasure to give him
  hell. But he drew his hand back again. Why provide the <i>Star</i> with an
  additional story?</p>

  <p>He paced up and down his living room struggling to see clearly. After a
  while he cooled down sufficiently to realize that it would be fatal to sulk
  in his tent under a charge like this. Though he felt that he hated the whole
  race of mankind, it was necessary to go out and show himself among them and
  play the fool, as usual. He shuffled over the invitations on his desk. Mr.
  and Mrs. Van Benthuysen, 270 Park Avenue, cocktails, six o'clock. They were
  conspicuous people; it would do.</p>

  <p>He dressed with particular care; the black jacket and gray trousers he had
  had made in Paris&mdash;a man did not ordinarily patronize French tailors,
  but the cut of these garments was just <i>outré</i> enough to be smart and
  amusing. With them he wore the double-breasted waistcoat he had himself
  brought back into fashion. This one was dove-colored, bound with black braid.
  He had spats to match it and a gray Homburg made on a new block, the first of
  its style to be shown in New York. In his lapel he stuck the gardenia that
  was his trade-mark after office hours. Takaku put a fresh supply in the
  Frigidaire every day.</p>

  <p>As he drove away from his door he looked through the rear window of his
  taxi and saw the detective following in the next car. Much good may it do
  him, Mike thought; he's only wasting the taxpayers' money. When he crossed
  the Park Avenue sidewalk at 270, a boy thrust the latest edition of a tabloid
  under his eyes and he read in staring type: MIKE AT HEADQUARTERS. The balance
  of the first page was filled with a photograph of his scowling self that
  enraged him afresh.</p>

  <p>He enjoyed a lurid success at the Van Benthuysen's foolish party. A new
  kind of fame clung around him today. All talk ceased when he entered the
  rooms, and immediately afterwards everybody started making up to him. It was
  sickening because he knew very well what they had been saying before he came,
  and what they would say when he had gone. He exulted in the fascinated eyes
  of the women and the fawning smiles of the men&mdash;but it didn't make him
  feel any better. In a man like Mike, pain manifests itself in the form of
  rage, but it is pain just the same. He hated the whole roomful of them and
  stared them down one after another, daring them with his eyes to bring up the
  subject of the Ware case. Nobody had the courage to do so; Mike's smile was
  too forbidding. The more cocktails he drank, the sorer he got. If this keeps
  up, he thought, I <i>will</i> kill somebody, just to get square.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">JUST after Mike had returned to his flat to dress for
  dinner, Radigan came. The Lieutenant's honest phiz had undergone another
  change of expression; he now looked like a schoolboy caught in mischief.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mike," he said self-consciously.</p>

  <p>Mike was not disposed to relent. "What can I do for you now?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Got to talk to you," mumbled Radigan. "Can I come in?"</p>

  <p>"Surely."</p>

  <p>Mike took him into the living room and gave him a drink because he wanted
  one himself. Radigan obviously was having a hard time coming to the point,
  and Mike left it to him. Mike said:</p>

  <p>"Excuse me if I start dressing. I'm going to be late as it is. I'll leave
  the door open. I can hear all you say."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence from the living room while Mike was pulling off
  his clothes, and he smiled to himself. Radigan was evidently on the grid;
  well, he could damned well stay there. Finally he heard Radigan say: "Nice
  place you got here, Mike."</p>

  <p>"Not bad. Not bad. It suits me."</p>

  <p>Another silence.</p>

  <p>Finally Radigan appeared in the doorway. "Damn it all, Mike, I'm sorry!"
  he blurted out.</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" said Mike. "And you a cop? This will never do!"</p>

  <p>"Aah!" growled Radigan. "Can't you see I'm sorry? What do you want to razz
  me for?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry for what?"</p>

  <p>"Because this afternoon I thought you done it. I went to the Inspector
  with the story, and it got in the papers and all. I know better now."</p>

  <p>"What has brought about this miracle?"</p>

  <p>"Quit your razzing, can't you? I feel bad enough already...I'll tell you.
  About half an hour ago I was called to the phone. I was still at
  Headquarters..."</p>

  <p>"Working on the Mike Speedon case!"</p>

  <p>"Cut it out!... It was a woman. She asked me if I'd stay there until she
  got down, and I said sure, and she came down. She's a peach, Mike! A peach!
  You know who I mean."</p>

  <p>Mike shrugged and held out his hands.</p>

  <p>"She was absolutely on the level. Gave me her name and all. She said she
  had just read in the paper that you were suspected of the Ware murder because
  you refused to tell where you were on Tuesday night, so she felt it was up to
  her to come forward and tell that you were with her."</p>

  <p>Mike's attention was sharply caught then. "My God!" he
  murmured..."<i>Her!</i>"</p>

  <p>"She said she hoped I could keep it to myself because it would just about
  wreck her if it was published..."</p>

  <p>"Sure, it would!"</p>

  <p>"... But if there had to be a showdown, she would come forward and
  testify."</p>

  <p>Mike was staring at Radigan like a man transfixed. A pleasant warm current
  was stirring in his breast. "After all," he murmured, "there are women who
  are on the square!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe she's lying," said Radigan, "a woman will always lie for one man,
  but..."</p>

  <p>"That's the wonderful part of it," Mike interrupted; "I am not the one man
  in the world for her. I was merely a diversion, you understand, <i>pour
  passer le temps</i>..."</p>

  <p>"Aah! speak English!"</p>

  <p>"Have you told the Inspector?"</p>

  <p>Radigan scowled. "What do you think I am? He would make her tell her story
  to him. I wouldn't want to put her through that!"</p>

  <p>"Good boy!" said Mike warmly.</p>

  <p>"What's bothering me now," Radigan went on, "is how to let the press know
  that we haven't a thing against you."</p>

  <p>"The heck with them!" said Mike. "Let them spin their yarns. What do I
  care as long as I have a real friend or two back of me. Like yourself, for
  instance, and the woman who came to you." Mike stood with hanging arms,
  having entirely forgotten his dressing. "It took nerve for her to go to the
  police!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>Radigan eyed his naked torso approvingly. "Gee! you'd make a dandy recruit
  on the force...You'd better get a move on or you'll be late for your
  dinner."</p>

  <p>Mike came to. "Have you eaten, Rad?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then <i>à bas</i> big shirt fronts! I'm going to put on my working
  clothes and eat at Bonifacio's with you."</p>

  <p>"But if you've got a date..."</p>

  <p>"No! It isn't every day that a man is accused of murder. I'm the most
  famous man in New York tonight! They can't expect to capture me for their
  footling dinners!"</p>

  <p>"You're talking crazy!"</p>

  <p>"Not so crazy as I sound, old omadhaun! You and me have a job on our
  hands. I turned up some new leads today and I reckon you did, too. We've got
  to put our findings together, and dope out the answer."</p>

  <p>Soon afterwards, in a booth at Bonifacio's, the two were discussing a dish
  of troglie. "Boy! this is A-1 chow," said Radigan. "Like fried clams, sort
  of. What the heck is it, Mike?"</p>

  <p>Mike waited until Radigan had cleared his plate. "Octopus," he said
  wickedly.</p>

  <p>"O my God!" cried the Lieutenant. "That's a dirty trick to play on a man!
  I see them things on the fish stalls every time I go down First Avenue. Give
  me some wine, quick!"</p>

  <p>When they had finished eating, Mike told Radigan what had happened in the
  Ware apartment that day. When his turn came, Radigan said:</p>

  <p>"I guess you doped out for yourself why I had Cummings down to
  Headquarters this morning."</p>

  <p>Mike shook his head. "I figured you were putting up some kind of game on
  him."</p>

  <p>"I had the real Cummings in the audience at the line-up to give the fake
  Cummings the once-over when I brought him in. He told me afterwards that he
  had met our man nine or ten months ago when they were both hunting jobs. The
  fake Cummings made up to him in an employment office&mdash;not Mrs. Sully's,
  and treated him to a drink after, and for a while they used to eat together
  and sit in each other's rooms. The fake Cummings was then passing under the
  name of Wilson. Their talk was mostly about jobs, naturally; they showed each
  other their references.</p>

  <p>"The real Cummings was struck by the questions his friend 'Wilson' was
  always asking him. Wilson asked him hundreds of questions about a butler's
  duties, and it seemed funny that he didn't know the answers already, but
  Wilson explained that service was very different in Australia, being a new
  country. The real Cummings recommended a butler's manual to Wilson that would
  tell him all such things. This book was found in our Cummings' possession,
  you remember, and bears the marks of frequent thumbing. After a while, the
  real Cummings said, 'Wilson' disappeared, and he had never heard from him
  after."</p>

  <p>"This proves," said Mike, "that as long ago as last winter our Cummings
  was already plotting to get into Mrs. Ware's household."</p>

  <p>"Sure. I am convinced that Cummings is our best bet."</p>

  <p>"Maybe so; but if it was the jewels he was after, why should he wait six
  months before lifting them? He had plenty of chances before that. And why is
  he still sticking around? No, Rad, you only have to take a look at that man's
  eyes to see that he's playing a deeper game. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"That's what we've got to find out."</p>

  <p>"Sure, and while working on him, we mustn't neglect the other leads.
  Bethesda Prior is not cleared yet, though I admit <i>at this moment</i> she
  doesn't look very promising. But something may turn up that will change the
  whole set-up. Also, the second man, young Alfred, is mixed up in it somehow;
  it looks now as if he was Cummings' confederate and as if they had quarreled
  over the swag. Then there is Attorney MacKelcan, he's a deep one, always
  trying to persuade you he's a fool. He stood to gain nothing under the will,
  but he's playing his game, too. And finally there is Norbert Besson. He had
  the best reason in the world for wiping out the old woman."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"As the fiancé of a woman sixty-seven years old he was a laughing stock of
  the cafés&mdash;he's not twenty-seven himself, and it galled him. The moment
  he believed that the will in his favor was signed, he would be wild to rid
  himself of such an incubus. Imagine having to make passionate love to a
  wrinkled old woman every day! The moment he was in possession of the sixty
  million, Norbert knew he would have the laugh on those who had laughed at
  him. That's the way of the world."</p>

  <p>"A pretty dirty world, if you ask me," said Radigan.</p>

  <p>"All right, old stove-in-bottom! I didn't make it."</p>

  <p>"The defect in that theory," said Radigan, "is that Norbert is as boneless
  as an earthworm..."</p>

  <p>"Not entirely," said Mike, "if I can depend on my informants."</p>

  <p>Radigan ignored the interruption. "I can't see a punk like Norbert
  plotting and carrying out a cold-blooded murder."</p>

  <p>"Neither can I. But that's where Mrs. Laval comes in. There is nothing
  slack-twisted about her! She has a stake in it too, remember. She is
  infatuated with Norbert and was enraged against the old woman for separating
  her from her heart throb. Maud Laval has no money of her own, and is
  therefore forced to hang on to her rich husband. But if she was able to help
  Norbert to sixty million, she could then divorce Payne Laval and marry
  Norbert. That's what she would figure, anyhow. As a matter of fact, if
  Norbert got his hands on that much money, I doubt if he would saddle himself
  with a woman so much older. Did you ever see Mrs. Laval, Rad?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"She's a lulu! I must introduce you. There's a kind of antique wickedness
  in that woman that you don't often see in these degenerate times. Lucrezia
  Borgia stuff. So long as she can pull the wool over Payne Laval's eyes, she
  absolutely doesn't give a damn what she does...Think this over, Rad. Two
  persons who were at the party on Tuesday night have told us that Norbert
  Besson and Maud Laval <i>both</i> disappeared for a considerable time."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Ware would never have received Mrs. Laval in her private sitting
  room."</p>

  <p>"No. She hated the woman. And Norbert knew better than to take his
  mistress up there. But Mrs. Ware's suite consists of three rooms with
  communicating doors. Why couldn't Mrs. Laval have been waiting in the
  dressing room while Norbert went into the boudoir to prepare the way? He had
  a drink with the old woman, say. Hers was loaded with barbitol, and when she
  went to sleep the other woman came in and did the job. A hypodermic syringe
  would be just the sort of weapon a woman like Mrs. Laval might choose."</p>

  <p>"What about the jewels?"</p>

  <p>"The heck with that. It's the murderer I'm after."</p>

  <p>"Sounds plausible," said Radigan, "but how the hell can we prove they went
  to Mrs. Ware's suite if nobody saw them?"</p>

  <p>"That's up to us. We've got to concentrate on the Laval-Besson angle."</p>

  <p>"I haven't neglected it. I haven't had a chance to tell you yet. The look
  I had at Norbert's correspondence made me want to see more. I searched his
  rooms while he was at dinner last night."</p>

  <p>"Without a warrant?"</p>

  <p>"We have to take that chance sometimes. The house detective at the
  Bathurst is a friend of mine, and I persuaded him that it was in the public
  interest. We got Norbert and Mrs. Laval placed at dinner, and we knew they
  would be good for an hour."</p>

  <p>"What did you find?"</p>

  <p>"A whole lot of stuff, but nothing as far as I can see that helps us
  much."</p>

  <p>"Does he own a pocket flash?"</p>

  <p>"No...There was a whole pack of letters from Mrs. Ware, and from other
  women, too; each woman's letters tied in a separate bundle."</p>

  <p>"That's Norbert's capital," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"But nothing from Mrs. Laval. Not a line!"</p>

  <p>"She's too smart to write letters."</p>

  <p>"I didn't bother about the other women's letters; there wasn't time and
  there were none of recent date anyhow. I read everything that Mrs. Ware had
  written him. Although she was seeing him all the time, she wrote him near
  every day. A lot of lallygagging that would sicken you, but nothing that
  applies to this case."</p>

  <p>"What else did you find?"</p>

  <p>"Well, for one thing, a ring that Mrs. Ware had given him."</p>

  <p>"How do you know it was from her?"</p>

  <p>"On the inside of it was engraved: 'To N. B. from F. W., October
  27th.'"</p>

  <p>"Three weeks ago. That was when they announced their engagement...What
  kind of ring, Rad?"</p>

  <p>"An unusual-looking ring. It had a flat, oval stone, dark green in color
  with red flecks in it. A very handsome setting."</p>

  <p>"Bloodstone. You don't see them often nowadays...Were there any references
  in Mrs. Ware's letters to this ring?"</p>

  <p>"One reference. She said: 'I have ordered the ring from Tiffany's.'"</p>

  <p>"By God! we may have something here," said Mike. "It takes time to make a
  ring. What was the date of the letter in which she spoke of the ring?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't tell you," said Radigan. "It didn't strike me as of any
  particular importance."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you dope!" groaned Mike. "And I was just on the verge!"</p>

  <p>Radigan didn't mind, because it was said with a grin. "It was one of the
  later letters, because it was near the top of the pile."</p>

  <p>"You should have taken the ring, Rad."</p>

  <p>"Ahh! I didn't like to do that."</p>

  <p>"But as long as you were in wrong, you might as well have been in a little
  wronger. It was a mistake for him to have kept the ring, and if he finds
  himself seriously suspected, he is certain to dispose of it...Where did you
  find it?"</p>

  <p>"In the middle drawer of his desk; on the right-hand side away at the back
  under some papers. It's in a little box."</p>

  <p>Mike was silent for a moment or two, studying hard. Finally he looked at
  his watch. "Only nine o'clock. Drink up your wine and let's go."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Around to the Ware apartment. If we can get hold of Kinsey we may learn
  something. The old lady talked pretty freely to her...Wait a minute! I've got
  a better idea. Take your time over your wine..."</p>

  <p>"What the hell!..."</p>

  <p>"The person who called you up today and tipped you off that I had been
  seen entering the service door on Tuesday night, was it a man or a
  woman?"</p>

  <p>"I took it for a woman, but it might have been a man speaking high. It was
  a whispering voice, like."</p>

  <p>"I think I know who it was, but I might be mistaken. Maybe it was somebody
  who was interested in driving a wedge between you and me, Rad."</p>

  <p>"That's possible."</p>

  <p>"In that case, we ought not to be seen too much together. We ought to let
  this person think we have been separated. You sit here over your wine and
  I'll drop around to the apartment. Back in half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Okay, Mike."</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>Cummings admitted Mike to the Ware apartment. A flicker of surprise passed
  over his masked face. "Anything new, Mr. Speedon?"</p>

  <p>"The new thing is that the police are determined to hang the murder on
  me," said Mike casually.</p>

  <p>"That is ridiculous, Mr. Speedon. You weren't here at all that night. I
  would be glad to testify to that, sir."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Cummings. You and Kinsey between you may be able to save me. I
  want to see Kinsey if she's still up."</p>

  <p>"She has retired to her room, sir, but I will request her to come down
  immediately."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't do that. Just warn her I'm here, and ask her to throw something
  around her. I want to ask her just one question."</p>

  <p>Mike didn't trust Cummings any farther than he could see him, and when the
  butler started away, he coolly followed. Cummings didn't say anything. They
  went up in the elevator together. Kinsey's room was at the back of the second
  floor. Some parley through the door was necessary before Cummings was
  permitted to open it. As Mike was within hearing, the butler had to deliver
  his message straight. Kinsey was scandalized at the idea of admitting a
  strange gentleman to her bedroom, but her curiosity was stronger than her
  sense of propriety, and, after some hasty adjustments were made, Mike was
  bidden to enter. The elderly lady's maid was sitting up in bed with what the
  English call a "woolly," pink in color, thrown over her head and clutched
  around her bony breast. Cummings stood by with the evident intention of
  chaperoning the meeting.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," said Mike with a hard look that the butler could
  not face out. He retired, bowing.</p>

  <p>Mike made sure that the door was tightly closed. "Let it stand open!" said
  Kinsey sharply.</p>

  <p>"Surely," said Mike, opening the door. He knew better than to argue with
  an apprehensive woman. "Let's speak low, though," he said, approaching the
  bed. "All the doors of this house seem to have ears!"</p>

  <p>Kinsey had picked up a good bit of American slang. "You said it!" she
  agreed primly.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to ask you a question or two..." began Mike.</p>

  <p>She didn't wait for him to finish. "I shan't say another word! I've talked
  too much already! I'll answer no questions except those put to me by the
  police!"</p>

  <p>"That's very sensible of you," said Mike smoothly. "Everybody seems to
  want to rush into print. But I could see from the first that you were
  different. It's so rare that you find a woman with the finer feelings." He
  sat down on the edge of the bed. Kinsey's mouth dropped open, but he paid no
  attention. Experience had taught him that no matter how they may carry on,
  prudes love to be shocked. He drew out his cigarette case. "Will you join me
  since it's after working hours?"</p>

  <p>"I don't indulge," said Kinsey sourly, but she watched him lighting up
  with fascinated eyes. Perhaps in daydreams she had pictured a handsome man
  sitting on her bed smoking a cigarette.</p>

  <p>Mike proceeded on the theory that no woman is too old or too bony to be
  cajoled. "It's so nice to have a quiet chat with you. You remind me of Jane
  Austen, the novelist. Have you read her works?"</p>

  <p>"My favorite author," said Kinsey stiffly.</p>

  <p>Lucky hit! thought Mike. He went on: "You're so quiet and reserved and
  penetrating. I can see that you are not easily deceived. I feel that you can
  read me like an open book!"</p>

  <p>Kinsey found his smile irresistible. She melted fast. "I didn't believe
  those stories about you in the newspapers, Mr. Speedon."</p>

  <p>"I knew <i>you</i> wouldn't, Miss Kinsey. It's so good to feel that you
  have one friend."</p>

  <p>"I'm not saying that I'll answer your questions," said Kinsey, "but you
  can let me hear what they are."</p>

  <p>"Did you know that Mrs. Ware had had a ring made for Mr. Besson?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. She showed it to me. A bloodstone in a very handsome
  setting."</p>

  <p>Mike concealed his eagerness. "When did she give it to him?"</p>

  <p>"She never had a chance to give it to him. It was sent home from the
  jeweler's on Tuesday afternoon. It was waiting for her when she got home, and
  she showed it to me."</p>

  <p>"Didn't she send it to Mr. Besson afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"No. She said she wanted to slip it on his finger herself. It was still
  here late that night. After I had dressed her and she had gone downstairs, it
  was still in the drawer of her dressing table. I saw it when I was cleaning
  up. In the morning it was gone, of course. The murderer got it with her other
  jewels."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Mike, rising quickly.</p>

  <p>"Oh!..." said Kinsey. "You haven't finished your cigarette."</p>

  <p>"I'll be seeing you," he said, making for the door.</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>He hastened back to Radigan at Bonifacio's.</p>

  <p>After telling his story, he said: "So now we have positive evidence that
  Norbert Besson was with Mrs. Ware on Tuesday night during the party."</p>

  <p>"My God!" murmured Radigan. "Could a man accept a ring from a woman and
  kill her immediately afterwards? Or stand by and let another kill her?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? If their plans had been carefully made in advance, they wouldn't
  let a little thing like a ring stop them."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">ON the following morning, when he got down to the
  <i>Recorder-Press</i>, Mike discovered that the tide had turned in his favor.
  He was asked to come up to Mr. Wade's private office, where he found Warner
  Bassett, City Editor, closeted with the big boss. Mr. Wade was noncommittal,
  Warner's greeting friendly.</p>

  <p>"Mike," he said, with studied casualness, "on the level, was it you who
  liquidated Old Lady Ware?"</p>

  <p>Mike felt a sudden warmth toward the harassed and overdriven editor. A
  square-shooter! "It was not," he said, as offhanded as the other.</p>

  <p>Warner turned to their employer. "Well, there you are, Mr. Wade. I have no
  more to say. Have I your permission to go ahead?"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," said Wade.</p>

  <p>While Warner was leading Mike down the hall, he explained that they had
  decided it would be good newspaper policy while the rest of the press was
  still raising a hue and cry against Mike, for the <i>Recorder-Press</i> to
  come out in his defense. He gave Mike a clap on parting, saying: "We're
  putting our money on you, Mike. God help you, if you let us down!"</p>

  <p>"You're taking a risk," said Mike.</p>

  <p>He returned to his own office feeling much better.</p>

  <p>Later, in his flat, while Mike was dressing for the afternoon, Sanford
  MacKelcan called. He had visited Mike's rooms on several occasions, and he
  always said about the same things. "Man! you've got a smart place here! So
  much more distingué than one of these damn new hotels that are all alike.
  There is class to this! Do you ever eat at home?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. There's a dining room and kitchen downstairs, and my little
  Jap's a good cook when I require it."</p>

  <p>"Man! I bet you have many a snug little party here just for two, eh
  boy?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? That's the line to take. Man! I wish I could be young
  again!"</p>

  <p>He drifted around the living room, pawing the different objects in a
  manner that Mike detested. However, he let him run on while he waited to find
  out what he had really come for. After a while it came out.</p>

  <p>"A very strange thing, Mike," MacKelcan said in a voice of exaggerated
  solemnity. "Extraordinary! My London associate cables me that he can't find
  James Fawcett. It seems that the London address Fawcett gave us is that of a
  small tobacco store which receives letters for its customers. Fawcett has
  been in the habit of sending a child to call for my letters and remittances.
  The family is not known in the neighborhood. And so many thousands of money
  orders pass through the London General Post Office every day, there is little
  chance of tracing him there. My agent is continuing the search, of
  course."</p>

  <p>After he had gone, Mike sat scowling and thinking it over. What the devil
  was MacKelcan up to? It was to his interest, of course, to delay the
  appearance of the heir as long as possible; in the interim the attorney was
  in full control of the estate. Had he ever cabled to England? On the other
  hand, the story of Mrs. Ware's death and the Englishman who had inherited
  sixty million dollars must have been published in all the London papers. Why
  hadn't Fawcett come forward of his own account? Was there such a man as
  Fawcett? Perhaps MacKelcan had invented him for his own purposes. Thus he
  could go on handling the estate indefinitely. There was no evidence that
  Fawcett existed except on MacKelcan's say-so. MacKelcan might easily have put
  over an imaginary nephew on Mrs. Ware during the days when she was under his
  influence.</p>

  <p>Mike had good friends in London, and as a result of his cogitations he
  started a little investigation of his own by cable.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, he taxied up to the Ware apartment to see what was doing.
  Somewhat to his surprise, the door was opened by Adele; this was supposed to
  be the duty of a manservant. There was nobody in sight, and Mike as a matter
  of habit turned up the girl's chin, and saluted her fresh lips. It was
  cheaper than tipping her&mdash;besides being pleasanter. He asked where
  Cummings was.</p>

  <p>"I think he's up in his room."</p>

  <p>This was odd, because Cummings was on the job every moment, early and
  late.</p>

  <p>Mike knocked on the door of the office and was invited to enter. Day
  Radnor was at her desk, looking as crisp as a flower that had opened an hour
  before. He searched her face to discover how the newspaper stories of the
  past two days had affected her. The old expression of friendly mockery was
  unchanged and he felt better. Day said:</p>

  <p>"I see that you are your own man again today."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't fired," said Mike. "On the contrary, the <i>Recorder-Press</i>
  is starting a campaign in my behalf."</p>

  <p>"They would," said Day. "You are one of their important assets, and they
  can't afford to let you be depreciated."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think I have any friends?"</p>

  <p>"You don't need friends."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yeah? You're not half so cynical as you like to make out."</p>

  <p>Day laughed and let it go at that.</p>

  <p>Mike described the events of the past twenty-four hours. A man had the
  comfortable assurance in talking to Day that he was safe with her. It wasn't
  necessary to swear her to secrecy. She was secretive anyhow.</p>

  <p>"I'm not usually vindictive," she said when he was through, "but it would
  please me well to see you hang the murder on Norbert Besson. He affects me
  like a bad smell."</p>

  <p>There was a tap on the door and Adele entered. She avoided looking at
  Mike. "Did you ring, Miss Radnor?" she asked demurely.</p>

  <p>"No," said Day. Her cool look at the girl suggested: And you know quite
  well that I did not.</p>

  <p>Adele was not in the least abashed by it. "Pardon me," she said, "I must
  have read the indicator wrong." She went out again.</p>

  <p>"Your girl-friend is evidently looking for you," said Day to Mike. "You'd
  better go to her."</p>

  <p>Mike was determined not to let Day have any change out of him today.
  "Reckon I had," he said, rising at once. "I'll be seeing you."</p>

  <p>"Tell her," said Day, "that she has nothing to fear from me."</p>

  <p>There was an acid edge to her voice that delighted Mike. "Oh, she doesn't
  mind you," he said, and went out well-pleased because he had insinuated the
  last word.</p>

  <p>Adele was making believe to busy herself in the foyer. "Cummings and
  Alfred are at it again," she whispered to Mike. "Up on the top floor. You'd
  better go up if you want to find out what it's all about."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Mike, making for the elevator.</p>

  <p>He ascended to the game room on the roof of the building, with its garden
  terrace outside. The vast room was in perfect order, but it had the forlorn
  look of a place that is not used. The garden was wintry. As soon as he
  stepped out of the elevator, Mike could hear distant sounds of distress. A
  creature somewhere was moaning in pain. He opened a service door and heard it
  louder; a man's voice, a young voice, rising to a suppressed shriek of agony;
  dying away in a moan.</p>

  <p>Running across the pantry, he opened another door. The voice had fallen
  silent. In front of him lay a corridor with several rooms opening off one
  side. These were the quarters of the menservants. The door of the first room
  stood open. It was empty. In it stood a vast, old-fashioned brass bedstead,
  Mrs. Ware's conjugal bed that she had brought with her to her apartment for
  sentimental reasons, and had stuck away up here. This room was not used. Mrs.
  Ware's present chauffeur was a married man and slept at home.</p>

  <p>The next room Mike knew, from the reports of the police search, was
  Cummings'. The door stood open likewise, and the room was empty. Suddenly the
  agonized male voice was raised again, almost at his elbow, it seemed. It was
  Alfred's voice, coming from the adjoining room, broken and quivering.</p>

  <p>"Oh! don't do it again!... I didn't, I tell you! I swear I didn't!... Oh
  God! don't hurt me any more!"</p>

  <p>Mike ran to the door. He would have liked to listen for a while, but he
  could not stand those sounds of pain. The door was locked. He pounded on it,
  and an instant silence fell on the room inside. Mike pounded again. "Open the
  door!" he commanded, "or by God I'll smash it in!"</p>

  <p>After a moment, the key turned and the door was thrown open. Mike found
  himself faced by Cummings, white-faced and sullen. The butler had thrown off
  his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeves; Mike was astonished by the
  development of his hairy forearms. Where did a house servant get such
  muscles? The ugly pallor of Cummings' face and the glitter in his eyes,
  struck a momentary fear into Mike. Can I handle him alone? he asked himself.
  Behind Cummings he saw Alfred collapsed in a chair with his chin on his
  breast, apparently half swooning.</p>

  <p>"What the devil is going on here?" demanded Mike.</p>

  <p>Cummings struggled hard to recover his usual smoothness, but he was
  breathing fast and his nostrils were dilated; the savagery in his eyes
  bordered on insanity. "I'm sorry you heard this, Mr. Speedon...This man is a
  bad servant...I'm trying to teach him."</p>

  <p>"Pretty primitive methods," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"I have found that it works very well, sir, with the young," murmured
  Cummings.</p>

  <p>"What did he do?"</p>

  <p>"He will not obey me, sir."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" Mike persisted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's just a matter of household discipline, sir. It's not worth your
  attention."</p>

  <p>Mike took no stock in this. He addressed Alfred. "You tell me what is the
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Don't notice it, Mr. Speedon, sir," mumbled the broken wretch from his
  chair. "Mr. Cummings ain't to blame. He's mistaken in what he thinks. I'm a
  good boy, Mr. Speedon."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i> does Cummings think?"</p>

  <p>"Don't notice it, Mr. Speedon. I can take it, sir. There won't be no more
  trouble. I'll work my fingers to the bone!"</p>

  <p>Cummings listened to this with a hideous smile. Mike thought: My God! a
  hyena! Cummings was saying smoothly:</p>

  <p>"If Alfred considers himself badly used, he is always free to go. Mr.
  MacKelcan will be glad to save his wages. There is not enough work for all
  now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, Mr. Cummings, sir," stammered Alfred. "I'm satisfied here. I got
  no kick coming."</p>

  <p>For some reason this answer angered Cummings afresh. Losing all
  self-control, he snarled, "Well, I'm sick of it, do you hear? You can go.
  Pack your things and get out!"</p>

  <p>An awful look of panic came into the young man's face. "Oh, God, no! Don't
  say it, Mr. Cummings! I ain't done nothing! I'm a good boy! You can't do this
  to me! Don't turn me off, Mr. Cummings. I got no place to go. Give me another
  chance!"</p>

  <p>"Pack your things!" snarled Cummings. "If you're not out in an hour I'll
  throw you out!"</p>

  <p>Alfred fell forward out of the chair to his knees and scrabbled to Mike's
  feet. Alfred was a big, handsome, young fellow and it was horrible to see him
  cringe like this. "Please, Mr. Speedon, speak a word for me," he pleaded.
  "I'm a good boy, Mr. Speedon. I don't give no trouble..."</p>

  <p>"I've got nothing to do with it," said Mike. "It's between you and
  Cummings."</p>

  <p>Alfred scrambled to his feet and, snatching up his coat, ran out of the
  room, struggling into the sleeves. Following him, they heard him run down the
  service stairs. He did not go on down the second flight, but ran forward
  through the corridor toward Mrs. Ware's private suite. He entered the
  boudoir. Cummings and Mike were not far behind him.</p>

  <p>In the boudoir Sanford MacKelcan was seated at Mrs. Ware's desk, going
  over her papers. Alfred was already in the middle of his plea. "... I'm a
  good boy, Mr. MacKelcan, sir. I'm a hard worker. I won't make no trouble. Ask
  him not to turn me off, sir. I got no place to go!"</p>

  <p>"What's this? What's this?" blustered MacKelcan. "Do I understand you have
  discharged him, Cummings?"</p>

  <p>Cummings had pretty well recovered his smoothness. "Should I have
  consulted you first, sir?" His tone was respectful, but his scorn and hatred
  of MacKelcan were apparent.</p>

  <p>"Not at all! Not at all!" said the attorney, blowing out his cheeks. "You
  are responsible for the servants. What did he do?"</p>

  <p>"He's not a good servant, sir. His particular offenses are not important,
  but I thought as there was no longer work for all I might as well..."</p>

  <p>"Quite! Quite!" MacKelcan had no more love for Cummings than Cummings had
  for MacKelcan, and the attorney was not sorry for this opportunity to exhibit
  his superior authority. "You are entirely right, Cummings, but after all,
  we're not exactly obliged to pinch the pennies, you know. If the young
  fellow's offense is not serious, I think we might keep him on until he has
  time to place himself elsewhere."</p>

  <p>Cummings' face was like a mask. "Very well, Mr. MacKelcan, just as you
  say, sir." Over his shoulder he said coolly to Alfred: "Go back to your
  work." Alfred beat it hastily. Cummings said to MacKelcan: "Will you be
  dining here tonight, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Not tonight, Cummings," said the attorney grandly. "After all, I have a
  home of my own."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; thank you, sir."</p>

  <p>Cummings softly footed it out of the room, and Mike followed him. He
  wanted an explanation of the extraordinary scene he had witnessed, but he was
  not anxious for MacKelcan to hear it.</p>

  <p>"Cummings," he said, "you and I are supposed to be working together. On
  the level, what is behind this trouble with Alfred?"</p>

  <p>Cummings had the effrontery to look surprised. "Nothing but what appears
  on the surface, Mr. Speedon. A willful, careless servant. He's had a good
  fright now, and he'll do better for a while."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: Well, the hell with you! I'll find out in my own way. He
  went on downstairs and out, having a date to meet Radigan.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER a hasty lunch, Mike and Radigan taxied to the Hotel
  Bathurst. Radigan's friend, the hotel detective, said that Norbert Besson was
  in his rooms. "But don't tell him I told you," he added. Mike and the
  Lieutenant proceeded directly to the twelfth floor. From the handle of the
  door to Norbert's suite hung a card reading: "Don't disturb." Nevertheless,
  Radigan knocked. From within, Norbert's angry voice answered:</p>

  <p>"Stay out! Can't you read?"</p>

  <p>The Bathurst was one of the hotels that maintain a telephone switchboard
  on each floor, with a girl to operate it, and incidentally to watch the
  comings and goings. This young woman, who was sitting near by, said to
  Radigan severely: "If you're not expected, you should phone before you come
  up."</p>

  <p>Radigan showed her his badge. "I'll trouble you to have the door opened,
  Miss."</p>

  <p>The alarmed girl phoned down to the office for instructions, and was told
  that if the police demanded admittance she must obey. She summoned a
  chambermaid, and told her to open the door. Mike stood back out of sight.
  Radigan took a look into the room and beckoned to him to follow. The
  handsomely furnished sitting room was empty. From the bedroom alongside came
  Norbert's voice:</p>

  <p>"Who's there?"</p>

  <p>Radigan went on into the bedroom, while Mike remained in the sitting room
  by the open door. He heard Norbert say:</p>

  <p>"You!... Who the devil let you in?"</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't blame the servants," said Radigan dryly. "When I flashed my
  badge they had to open the door." He advanced farther into the bedroom.
  "Still in bed, I see."</p>

  <p>"I'm under the doctor's care," snarled Norbert.</p>

  <p>"Well! Well! I suppose it was the disappointment over Mrs. Ware's will
  that made you sick! It's just too bad, because you're going to feel sicker
  before I'm done with you!"</p>

  <p>The listening Mike scowled. Clumsy work! If Radigan put the young fellow's
  back up, it would only give him the more strength to stand out.</p>

  <p>"Don't get up," Radigan went on sarcastically. "It's more cosy-like, with
  you lying in bed. I'll sit here and you can make out I'm the doctor."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked Norbert defiantly.</p>

  <p>"I want to know why you lied to me when I was here before."</p>

  <p>"A dick can always insult a man and he has no comeback. I'm not aware that
  I lied to you."</p>

  <p>"It won't pass, Bertie. I have the proof now, that you saw Mrs. Ware on
  Tuesday night and talked to her."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie!"</p>

  <p>"She was waiting in her sitting room for you to come up, and you went up.
  You were with her a good half hour."</p>

  <p>"What proof have you?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, wouldn't you like to know? You were the last person to see the old
  lady alive, and naturally we want to know what you talked about."</p>

  <p>Mike heard fear come into the young man's voice. "It's a lie, I tell you!
  There is no proof! There couldn't be! You're only bluffing!"</p>

  <p>"You mean, nobody saw you go up. You took care of that, eh? However, there
  is a mute piece of testimony, my boy. Something that speaks louder than
  words."</p>

  <p>"That's an old police trick," said Norbert. "I'm not frightened by it."
  There was a silence. Mike heard certain little sounds that suggested Norbert
  was lighting a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"If you're not frightened, why does your hand shake?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>"I told you I was sick. And this isn't doing me any good."</p>

  <p>"You have a right to be sick. The old lady was kind to you. She did
  everything in the world for you. Her last gift to you was a ring, and as you
  took it from her, you killed her!"</p>

  <p>"I did not! I did not!" cried Norbert.</p>

  <p>"Then the person who was with you killed her, while you stood by and
  looked on."</p>

  <p>"Nobody was with me!"</p>

  <p>"Ha!" cried Radigan. "So you were there by yourself!"</p>

  <p>"I was not there, and nobody was with me."</p>

  <p>"Where was your girl-friend while you were upstairs talking to Mrs.
  Ware?"</p>

  <p>Outside the door Mike shook his head in chagrin. What a bonehead question!
  Norbert instantly perceived the opening that Radigan had given him, and acted
  on it.</p>

  <p>"As far as I can judge by your crude language, you are referring to Mrs.
  Laval. That lady is above scandal. It was a stupid party, and Mrs. Laval and
  I went up to the game room in the elevator where we could talk in quiet."</p>

  <p>"Is that so? That doesn't account for the ring Mrs. Ware gave you. When
  did she give you the ring?"</p>

  <p>"I never had a ring from her."</p>

  <p>Mike, while still listening to what was being said in the next room, moved
  softly to the desk by the window. Easing out the flat drawer in the middle,
  he thrust in a hand and felt around. His fingers met with no hard object. He
  pulled the drawer farther out and turned over all the papers. There was no
  ring box. He shrugged in disappointment, thinking: Rad will never break him
  down now.</p>

  <p>On his previous visit, Mike had noticed that, though this was Norbert's
  sitting room, he kept his evening clothes hanging in a closet just within the
  entrance door. Mike wanted to have a look at the coat Norbert had worn on
  Tuesday night. He disappeared into the closet and in a minute or two emerged,
  grinning and holding a tail coat rolled up under his arm.</p>

  <p>After he had returned to his post beside the open door, the telephone in
  the bedroom rang. Norbert answered it, and Mike heard half of a brief
  conversation. "Hello!... Oh!... No. There's a man with me ... Radigan...How
  can I?... Sure!" Suddenly Norbert's voice became very agitated, "No! No! You
  mustn't do it! You mustn't!... Hello! Hello!" He jiggled the instrument, but
  the connection was broken.</p>

  <p>About three minutes later there was a tap on the bedroom door. "Don't pay
  any attention," whispered Norbert.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we must see who it is," cried Radigan. Mike heard his heavy tread;
  heard him open the door; heard his confident voice fail: "I ... I beg pardon,
  lady. I didn't know ..."</p>

  <p>A voice answered as clear and brittle as glass: "Shut the door. And don't
  stand staring at me like that." Maud Laval! thought Mike. When she spoke
  again, she was beside Norbert's bed. "My poor Norbert!" However, there was
  not much tenderness in the glassy voice. Some whispering followed, and
  Radigan broke in uncomfortably:</p>

  <p>"Look here, people, you can't ..."</p>

  <p>Little Mrs. Laval evidently faced him like a lioness. Mike couldn't see
  her, but he could feel the electricity she discharged. "Is this Mr. Besson's
  private room?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Why, sure, but ..."</p>

  <p>"Is he under arrest?"</p>

  <p>"No, but ..."</p>

  <p>"Then leave us!"</p>

  <p>Radigan was so flustered that he actually obeyed. Coming through the door,
  he faced Mike, hunching up his shoulders, spreading out his hands in a
  pantomime of helplessness. Mike wanted to laugh, but the situation was too
  serious. He sternly jerked his head toward the door, and his lips shaped the
  words: "Go on in there, and don't let her bluff you."</p>

  <p>The moment Radigan reappeared, Maud Laval opened up on him. "What do you
  mean by this intrusion on a sick man? Have people in our position no
  protection from the brutality of the police? Must we submit to being treated
  like common criminals?"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, lady! Brutality! I'm not going to take that ..."</p>

  <p>"Be quiet! I'm not interested in your feelings. I came upstairs because
  Mr. Besson is obviously not in a fit state to be badgered. Put your questions
  to me, and I'll answer them."</p>

  <p>"All right." Radigan's voice hardened. "Where were you on Tuesday night
  while Norbert was talking to Mrs. Ware?"</p>

  <p>"Norbert, Officer?" Mike could picture how the penciled eyebrows ran
  up.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Besson," grumbled Radigan. "Where were you?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Besson didn't see Mrs. Ware on Tuesday night," she answered
  calmly.</p>

  <p>"Then when did Mrs. Ware give him the ring?"</p>

  <p>"He never had a ring from Mrs. Ware. He knew that she was having one made,
  but was not aware that it was finished."</p>

  <p>"Then what did he understand from her letter to him Tuesday afternoon,
  saying that she had a surprise for him?"</p>

  <p>"So you have been reading his private letters?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that. Answer the question."</p>

  <p>"He didn't know what she meant by the surprise."</p>

  <p>"And wasn't he curious to find out Tuesday night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But Mrs. Ware was obviously indisposed on Tuesday night, and he
  thought he had better not disturb her. He's not like a policeman."</p>

  <p>Radigan's voice grew harsh. "I'm sorry, lady, but somebody is lying. That
  ring was in the drawer of Mrs. Ware's dressing table up to twelve-thirty
  Tuesday night. And at eight o'clock Wednesday night it was lying in its box
  in the middle drawer of Norbert's desk in the next room."</p>

  <p>"That's a ridiculous story!" said Mrs. Laval coolly. "How do you expect to
  prove it?"</p>

  <p>"I saw the ring with my own eyes. I had it in my hands."</p>

  <p>She pounced like a cat. "Were you provided with a search warrant?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did you take the ring?"</p>

  <p>"I did not."</p>

  <p>"Why? Such an important piece of evidence!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not a thief. I'm a detective officer trying to do his duty."</p>

  <p>"Don't try too hard; you might injure yourself...Shall we go in and see if
  the ring is there now?"</p>

  <p>"It's not there," said Radigan sorely, "or you wouldn't make the
  offer."</p>

  <p>"Really, Mr. whatever your name may be," drawled Mrs. Laval, "your story
  doesn't do much credit to your powers of invention. Even a detective is
  expected to think up something better than that."</p>

  <p>"Ahh!..." growled Radigan.</p>

  <p>The brittle voice shut him off. "Suppose there was a trial, would you have
  the face to go on the stand and tell such a flimsy tale?"</p>

  <p>"I sure would!"</p>

  <p>"Your superiors wouldn't allow it. It would bring too much discredit on
  the force. Searching a man's home in his absence without a warrant! That
  strikes at the very root of our liberties! And if you were allowed to
  testify, do you suppose any judge or jury would believe you? That you found a
  piece of evidence absolutely vital to your case, and you left it where it
  was, and it never could be found afterwards. You'd be laughed out of court,
  Mr. Lieutenant!" She laughed herself to show him what it would sound
  like.</p>

  <p>Every time Radigan started to speak, she raised her voice and beat him
  down. There was a towering arrogance in the woman. When Mike saw the
  inevitable conclusion coming, he stole out of the sitting room and waited for
  Radigan by the elevators. He had Norbert's tail coat hidden under his own
  topcoat. The Lieutenant presently joined him, smoking with baffled rage like
  a soft coal furnace.</p>

  <p>"Well, you balled up that situation nicely," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" growled Radigan. "I don't have to take that from you!"</p>

  <p>Mike laughed. "You took it from the little woman, all right."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, I tell you!"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you shut her up?"</p>

  <p>The elevator door opened and they descended in silence.</p>

  <p>When they reached the lobby, Radigan had cooled down a little. His voice
  was almost humble. "Ahh, forget it, Mike. I didn't mean nothing. I was just
  sore."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Mike. "We need a drink now." He led Radigan into
  the bar.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of the mahogany, Radigan muttered sorely: "I never was
  up against such a high society dame before. She put it all over me with her
  highty-tighty airs. Keep your place, my man, and all that. And her no more
  than a common strumpet, coming to the bedside of a man not her husband!
  Norbert had nothing on but his pajamas. The face of her, Mike! the face of
  her!"</p>

  <p>Mike laughed. "They're all face! The trouble with you is, Rad, you're
  decent. It's gone out of style. The heck with her social position. She's only
  a woman like any other, and her methods are exactly the same as the
  street-walker you arrest on Sixth Avenue for soliciting."</p>

  <p>"I'm not on the vice squad," growled Radigan, and Mike had to laugh
  again.</p>

  <p>"They all talk loud and fast with the object of putting a man in the
  wrong. Why, damn it, you let her question <i>you</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Well, if you think you can handle her any better, let's go back up and
  you show me!"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mike. "We'd be at a hopeless disadvantage now. We've got to
  shift our ground. We'll execute a flank attack."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Let's go to her apartment and send for her to come up there."</p>

  <p>Radigan stared. "She won't come."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think she will! I think she will!"</p>

  <p>Mike's confidence was infectious and Radigan said: "All right, I'll try
  anything once...Just let me telephone to Headquarters to see if anything has
  come in."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Radigan rejoined Mike at the bar, he said: "Dowell had
  made a report. He's the man who was assigned to tracing the sales of
  hypodermic syringes."</p>

  <p>"Did he turn up anything?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Emory and Almond, well-known dealers in surgical instruments, state
  that they sold two syringes of the type wanted to Dr. Walter Patton on Friday
  last. That was four days before the murder. Dr. Patton is one of the
  best-known surgeons in the city. It was a mail order on the doctor's own
  letterhead. Dr. Patton is an old customer of the house, he runs an account
  there, and the mail clerk was perfectly familiar with his signature."</p>

  <p>"These syringes were probably wanted for a legitimate purpose," put in
  Mike.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. When Dr. Patton was asked about it, he said he had never
  ordered any syringes and had never received any. But when the order was
  showed to him he said it was certainly his letterhead and his signature.
  However, he was able to show that the body of the order, which had been
  typed, could not have been written on either of the machines in his office.
  The order was then submitted to our chemist at Headquarters, who reported
  that the original communication on this sheet had been erased with an acid,
  leaving only the signature, and the pretended order had then been written in
  above."</p>

  <p>"How about the delivery of the syringes?"</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to that. Dr. Patton was made to say in the order that he
  wanted to use these articles at home, and that they should be sent to him at
  a certain box in the Stamford post office. Dowell then chased up to Stamford
  and learned that this particular box was rented in the name of John
  Jones."</p>

  <p>"Nice easy name to forget," put in Mike.</p>

  <p>"It was rented four months ago," Radigan continued, "and the rent paid
  half a year in advance. The Stamford post office is a busy place, and none of
  the clerks had any recollection of what this Jones looked like. He had never
  been seen to empty the box, and in fact, the sorters said, when it was called
  to their attention, that they could scarcely remember ever having anything to
  put in that box. The little package containing the syringe would be addressed
  to Dr. Patton, naturally, but as the box number was plain, it would have been
  put there as a matter of routine. It was probably collected after hours. The
  section of the post office where the letter boxes are is always open."</p>

  <p>"Man!" exclaimed Mike, "we're dealing with a superior scoundrel here!
  We'll have to bestir ourselves to get ahead of him&mdash;or her! He'll never
  return to this box now, of course."</p>

  <p>"We must find out if Mrs. Laval is a patient of Dr. Patton's."</p>

  <p>"That won't prove anything. Patton has thousands of patients."</p>

  <p>"The Inspector told me to find out if you had ever been a patient of his,"
  said Radigan slyly.</p>

  <p>"I have not," said Mike. "Thank God, I'm no doctor's patient. I'm as
  healthy as a new-laid egg."</p>

  <p>Mike paid for the drinks, and they taxied up town to the Laval address. It
  was in upper Fifth Avenue in that section that has been termed the Gold
  Coast, and not a great distance from the building where Mrs. Ware had lived.
  While it had not quite the cachet of the latter sumptuous building, it was
  still one of the choicest addresses in New York. Payne Laval was president of
  one of our oldest and most conservative banks. When they drew up at the door,
  Mike said:</p>

  <p>"I can get in here easier by myself. You drive on to One Hundredth Street
  and back, and ask for me at the door of the Laval apartment."</p>

  <p>"Okay," said Radigan. "This is your show."</p>

  <p>Mike gave his name to the servant who opened the apartment door; the man
  knew who he was for house servants are the most assiduous readers of smart
  gossip. He said respectfully: "I'm sorry, sir, Mrs. Laval is not at
  home."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Mike nonchalantly, "I was talking to her a while ago, and I
  thought she'd be here by now...I say," he went on, as if struck with a sudden
  thought, "what's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Taplow, sir," murmured the butler, pleased to be noticed by the
  celebrity.</p>

  <p>"Well, Taplow, Mrs. Laval is calling on a friend who lives at the Hotel
  Bathurst. It's suite number 1220. You might phone and ask if I'm to wait here
  for her. Tell her I want to show her a story that has been sent me."</p>

  <p>The telephone was close by. While the man was getting his number, Mike
  carelessly tossed the tail coat he had been concealing on a bench, and his
  own topcoat on top of it. The servant stared, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>Whatever Mrs. Laval may have thought of this telephone message, she was
  not one to take servants into her confidence. She received the message and
  answered it succinctly.</p>

  <p>"You're to wait, sir, if you please," said the man, hanging up.</p>

  <p>He ushered Mike into the living room. This was a superb apartment fifty
  feet long with a row of tall windows opening on a balcony with a stone
  balustrade. Central Park lay below. The long room exhibited a kind of
  compromise between the tastes of wife and husband. Mrs. Laval was known as a
  "decorator" among her society friends, and sometimes condescended to do a
  house for one of them. Her own living room exemplified some of the latest
  foibles; polished red floor, heliotrope walls, primrose hangings and starkly
  plain modern furniture. Payne Laval, on the other hand, was a collector of
  curios of the old-fashioned sort, and here and there around the room Mike saw
  beautiful pieces of antique enamel or metal work that represented his
  contribution.</p>

  <p>Mike came to a stand in front of a small table and his eyes bugged out. On
  the table lay a paper cutter in the form of a dagger with a <i>repoussé</i>
  handle, silver gilt. At first glance, it was a replica of the one they had
  picked up on Mrs. Ware's whatnot. Upon closer examination, he saw that this
  was a modern piece of inferior workmanship. Moreover, the <i>repoussé</i>
  design was not exactly the same. However, the resemblance was startling
  enough, and it gave Mike furiously to think. He paced up and down the room,
  staring at it with each return. He tried the edge of the blade. It was as
  dull as a paper cutter ought to be.</p>

  <p>Radigan arrived directly. The manservant brought him to Mike in the living
  room. "Pardon me, Mr. Speedon," said the servant, "but will this gentleman be
  waiting?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mike nonchalantly. "It's all right, Taplow. Mrs. Laval is
  acquainted with him."</p>

  <p>Radigan put up his hand to hide a grin.</p>

  <p>When the servant had gone, Mike led his partner to the little table and
  silently pointed to the dagger.</p>

  <p>"My God!" murmured Radigan. "Another one?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite the same," said Mike, "but too near like to be just a
  coincidence."</p>

  <p>"What does it mean, Mike?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but I mean to find out before we leave."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. LAVAL arrived hard on Radigan's heels. Mike took care
  to be in that part of the living room which commanded the foyer, and he
  therefore saw her enter and Norbert Besson behind her. Norbert immediately
  ducked through another door. Mike sang out: "Come on in, Norbert. It's only
  me."</p>

  <p>Norbert, however, did not immediately reappear.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laval got the surprise of her life when she came to the door and saw
  that Radigan was with Mike. She was a small woman with a trim figure and the
  glance of an eagle. She had handsome black eyes, hard as onyx, yet capable of
  flashing grandly. Arrogance was her keynote. She was obviously not young, yet
  you couldn't call her old, either. The beauticians had rendered her ageless.
  That she was a brunette helped. With a sure instinct, she dressed with
  absolute plainness, and wore no jewels except a string of pearls, not
  especially big, but of marvelous sheen and color. Her black hair was neither
  curled nor coiffed, but drawn straight off her forehead and twisted behind.
  Her skin was colorless, her lipstick not too red. The total result was an
  extraordinary chic. Mrs. Laval could not have been mistaken for other than a
  Personage.</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed at Radigan. "What are you doing in my house?"</p>

  <p>Mike answered for him with a smile. "He's with me."</p>

  <p>Her eyes seemed to become incandescent with anger. "I don't care who he's
  with. He has no business in my house. Get out! Get out both of you!"</p>

  <p>Mike's smile broadened. "Now, Mrs. Laval!..."</p>

  <p>"Get out, do you hear? Go print your dirty stories about me! I don't care
  what you say. I don't care what anybody says about me! I've never yielded to
  a threat in my life, and I'm not going to start now. Get out!"</p>

  <p>"Waaait a minute!" drawled Mike. "I've got no stories about you to print.
  I only used that as a decoy to get you here. And it worked, you see."</p>

  <p>"Then what <i>do</i> you want?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I'm helping Lieutenant Radigan."</p>

  <p>"So you've become a stool pigeon," she sneered. "I can't say I'm
  surprised. However, you can both get out, and quickly, too, or I'll have you
  thrown out."</p>

  <p>Mike's smile hardened. "Sorry," he said, "but we're not going. Radigan's a
  pretty husky guy, and I'm not exactly a weakling. Call in your servants if
  you want, but I wouldn't advise it. Of course, you have Norbert, too, but
  he's not very athletic."</p>

  <p>It seemed impossible that Mrs. Laval could become any angrier, but she
  did. Her eyes blazed on Mike. "Such insolence!" she breathed. Without
  thinking what she was saying, she added: "I'll call the police!"</p>

  <p>Mike laughed out loud, and Radigan, though he was abashed by the fiery
  lady, could not help but laugh too. "You haven't got far to go for a
  policeman," said Mike.</p>

  <p>She was stumped for an answer then. She had sprung her mine and her
  enemies laughed in her face. But with her it was no surrender. She paced the
  room with clenched hands and clenched teeth, inwardly fuming. If eyes could
  kill, Mike would have fallen dead.</p>

  <p>After a moment, Mike said soothingly: "We only want a little quiet talk
  with you and Norbert..."</p>

  <p>"He's not here," she snapped.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," said Mike. "I saw him come in with you...The Lieutenant
  complains that you got so angry with him a while ago, he couldn't finish his
  story, or ask you the questions he has in mind."</p>

  <p>"I will answer no questions," she said with her chin in the air.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Mike, "but you have <i>got</i> to answer them. I am sure
  you would not want the Lieutenant to carry you down to Headquarters in a
  police wagon."</p>

  <p>"How dare you! How <i>dare</i> you!" she breathed.</p>

  <p>Mike was unimpressed. "Believe me, the wagon is no respecter of persons.
  You could be carried in the wagon as well as any other woman."</p>

  <p>For seconds their eyes contended for the mastery. However, Mike was sure
  of his ground, and she was not. It was her eyes that fell.</p>

  <p>"Must Norbert be present?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"He must."</p>

  <p>She left the room. Norbert must have been listening behind an open door
  close by, because she immediately returned with him.</p>

  <p>"Ask your questions," she said sullenly.</p>

  <p>"First we have something to <i>tell</i> you," said Mike. "You shut Radigan
  up so quick before, he couldn't get it out...When Radigan was searching
  Norbert's rooms he wasn't alone."</p>

  <p>"Who was with him?"</p>

  <p>"I was."</p>

  <p>Radigan glanced at Mike, surprised and admiring. What a cool liar! his
  look said. Norbert's pale face became paler, but Mrs. Laval only smiled
  scornfully.</p>

  <p>"I don't see what difference it makes."</p>

  <p>"It makes this difference. I saw the ring, and I can add my testimony to
  Radigan's." Mike waited for a moment to let this sink in. "If Norbert will
  admit that he had the ring," he went on, "we'll get along much faster."</p>

  <p>Norbert opened his mouth to speak. Mrs. Laval said sharply: "He admits
  nothing!" and he closed it again.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Mike. "We know he had it. Here's the first question.
  Where were you when Mrs. Ware gave him the ring?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to drag her into it?" Norbert burst out. "She hadn't
  anything to do with it!"</p>

  <p>"So you went to Mrs. Ware's room alone?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't say so," flashed Mrs. Laval.</p>

  <p>Mike turned to her. "You disappeared from the party at the same time
  Norbert did. It's hardly conceivable that you went wandering around another
  woman's apartment by yourself. If you will tell us whom you were with at this
  time, there's your alibi."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to say," she answered haughtily.</p>

  <p>"Then we must assume that you and Norbert went upstairs together."</p>

  <p>"Assume what you like."</p>

  <p>"That's nonsense!" cried Norbert. "Mrs. Laval would never go to Mrs.
  Ware's rooms."</p>

  <p>"I believe you," said Mike, "but she might wait in the adjoining room with
  the door open."</p>

  <p>"What on earth for?"</p>

  <p>"To back you up."</p>

  <p>"You are simply being ridiculous," said Mrs. Laval languidly. "I was never
  in Mrs. Ware's dressing room in my life!"</p>

  <p>"Then how did you know that the next room was a dressing room?"</p>

  <p>Norbert caught his breath on a gasp, but Mrs. Laval kept her chin up. She
  said: "A dressing room is always next to a boudoir."</p>

  <p>"Not always," said Mike. "Very often it's a bedroom."</p>

  <p>"You know all about bedrooms and boudoirs, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"It's part of a young man's education."</p>

  <p>"You forget," she said, "that Mrs. Ware's rooms were carefully described
  in the newspapers. There was a plan showing boudoir, bedroom and dressing
  room."</p>

  <p>Mike smiled at her cleverness. "You just remembered it." That gasp from
  Norbert told him that he had made a strike.</p>

  <p>"How long do we have to put up with this?" said Mrs. Laval with a bored
  air. "You're not getting anywhere."</p>

  <p>Mike, however, when he looked at Norbert's pale, sweating face, felt that
  he was getting somewhere. A little more pressure and the man would break.
  Radigan thought so, too. His glance at Mike said: You're doing all right,
  fellow.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laval said: "What motive could Norbert possibly have for ..."</p>

  <p>"Can you ask me that?" said Mike. "Tied to that absurd old woman when ..."
  He left his sentence in the air. "She wrote to him on Tuesday afternoon,
  telling him that she had made a will in his favor. The will had been 'made,'
  but it was not signed."</p>

  <p>"This is fantastic," she said haughtily.</p>

  <p>A bell rang. Looking into the foyer, Mike saw the manservant go to the
  door. He admitted an old gentleman, handsome and dignified. Mike knew him. It
  was Payne Laval. The servant took his hat and coat. Hearing voices in the
  living room, Mr. Laval approached the door with the pleased expression of one
  preparing to meet guests.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear," he said to his wife.</p>

  <p>A change came over her, and Mike saw that there was one person in the
  world whom she condescended to propitiate. But still she showed no fear.
  "Well, Payne," she said pleasantly.</p>

  <p>He was a good deal older than his wife, beautifully groomed, a personage
  in his way, too; not very bright, perhaps, but supported by the immense
  prestige of inherited wealth. He undoubtedly belonged to the Union League
  Club for political reasons, and to the Metropolitan Club for social contacts;
  and he and all his friends shuddered at the name of Roosevelt.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Norbert," he said amiably.</p>

  <p>Norbert mumbled something. Luckily for him, he had his back to the
  windows, and the old gentleman could not read his face.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mr. Laval," said Mike. "We have met. I'm Michael
  Speedon."</p>

  <p>"Ah, how-je-do," said Mr. Laval, sheering off a little. He had an
  old-fashioned distrust of newspapermen. "And who is this gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"My friend, Mr. Radigan," said Mike, wishing to spare his feelings.</p>

  <p>"Ah, how-je-do, Mr. Radigan. A very pleasant afternoon for the season,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Radigan.</p>

  <p>Mr. Laval was not so old but that he could sense something unpleasant in
  the air. He had no desire to be drawn into it, and he was already preparing
  to leave the room when Mike said:</p>

  <p>"You're an art collector, aren't you, Mr. Laval?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, in a small way, a small way," he said with a wave of the hand.</p>

  <p>"I was admiring this Florentine dagger," said Mike, picking it up.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes. I got it in Rome. They told me that it came from the workshop of
  Benvenuto ..." He suddenly pulled up, staring hard at the object in Mike's
  hands. "Pardon me," he said, taking it. His mouth dropped open. "My dear," he
  said, turning a distressed face to his wife, "this is not it. This is a
  modern piece which has been substituted for my dagger. It's been stolen!...
  the servants ..."</p>

  <p>Out of the tail of his eye, Mike saw Norbert turning greenish with terror.
  He sauntered away to the window with his back turned as if this scene bored
  him. Mrs. Laval, on the other hand, never turned a hair. She had courage. She
  went to her husband, expressing sympathy and concern&mdash;at least on the
  surface.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, my dear?"</p>

  <p>"Look for yourself," said the old gentleman. "The police must be
  notified!"</p>

  <p>"It could hardly have been one of the servants," she said. "Where could a
  servant have obtained the dagger to substitute for it? More likely a guest; a
  fellow collector who had been coveting your Cellini dagger for a long time,
  and had procured a substitute to leave in its place so that the loss would
  not be noticed. It may have happened weeks ago. We seldom have any occasion
  to look at it closely."</p>

  <p>Mike could not but admire the quickness of her wits.</p>

  <p>"True! True!" Mr. Laval said, sadly shaking his head. "How terrible when
  one is not safe even with one's friends!"</p>

  <p>"It's a serious loss," said Mrs. Laval, "but do you really wish to notify
  the police? They would make such a story of it in the papers."</p>

  <p>"You are right, my dear. I'll say nothing about it unless other objects
  are missing. I'll go and consult my inventory." The distressed old gentleman
  did not forget his manners. "Good day to you, gentlemen; Norbert, I'm sorry
  to have inflicted this unpleasant scene on you. Mr. Speedon, please do not
  say anything about it."</p>

  <p>"I'm not a reporter, Mr. Laval. I shall say nothing."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Good day, Mr. Madigan. Happy to have met you." He went
  out.</p>

  <p>Having let him get well away from the room, Mike said to Mrs. Laval dryly:
  "I congratulate you."</p>

  <p>"What on?" she said haughtily.</p>

  <p>"A marvelous piece of acting!"</p>

  <p>"Do you have to insult me?"</p>

  <p>"His dagger is in the possession of the police."</p>

  <p>"You're lying."</p>

  <p>"Who's insulting now?... On the level, it was picked up in Mrs. Ware's
  boudoir on Wednesday morning."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't in the papers."</p>

  <p>"Whoever found it first thought that it was a curio off one of her shelves
  and put it back again ... The point had been stuck in a cork to keep it from
  cutting. They found the cork, too, under the sofa. The theory is that
  somebody had it in his pocket, the cork worked loose, and the dagger slit the
  pocket and dropped out. It had been freshly sharpened. It had an edge keen
  enough to split a hair."</p>

  <p>"I am not interested," said Mrs. Laval. But from the window Mike could
  hear the sound of Norbert's hoarse breathing.</p>

  <p>"Not interested! In your husband's Cellini dagger?"</p>

  <p>"What's it got to do with Mrs. Ware's murder? Is there any suggestion that
  she was stabbed?"</p>

  <p>"No. The theory is that the idea of killing a person by injecting air into
  a vein was so new that the murderer doubted its efficacy. And so he took
  along the dagger as a second string."</p>

  <p>"Still not interested," said Mrs. Laval, with her head high.</p>

  <p>"What's the use of bluffing?" said Mike, almost with regret. "You know and
  I know that it was Norbert who carried the dagger to Mrs. Ware's boudoir in
  the tail pocket of his evening coat, and it was no doubt in the ardor of
  embracing his elderly fiancée on the sofa that it got away from him."</p>

  <p>"You are imagining all this!"</p>

  <p>Mike went out into the foyer and came back with the tail coat. "Here's
  Norbert's coat. Notice the slit in the tail pocket. Any expert could tell you
  that that cut was made with a <i>very</i> sharp implement."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laval was breathing fast now, but her eyes were still full of a
  defiant fire. "There's no proof that this is Norbert's coat. All dress coats
  are alike."</p>

  <p>"Look!" said Mike. He turned over the edge of the inside breast pocket.
  "Here's the tailor's label. All custom tailors use such labels. His own name
  and the date of making, and the customer's name. See! Norbert Besson,
  Esquire."</p>

  <p>"Is this what they call the third degree?" drawled Mrs. Laval.</p>

  <p>Mike knew he would never break her down. "Norbert, come and look at this,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>The young man uttered a choked cry and clapped his hands to his head. "Oh,
  for God's sake, stop it! stop it! I can't stand any more!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laval whirled on him. "Be quiet!"</p>

  <p>He was too far gone to listen to her. He staggered to a chair and dropped
  in it, holding his head and moaning: "Oh, God! Oh, God!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laval turned away with a despairing shrug. There was no weakness in
  her face. Mike followed up Norbert.</p>

  <p>"Is this your coat?" he asked sternly.</p>

  <p>"Leave me alone! Leave me alone!" Even in hysteria, Norbert took care not
  to cry out too loud. "You know it's my coat! But I didn't do it. I swear it!
  Oh, God! nobody was ever in such a jam!"</p>

  <p>"What were you carrying the dagger for?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laval turned around. "I had given it to him for a keepsake."</p>

  <p>"Your husband's dagger?"</p>

  <p>"My husband would never have noticed the substitution if you hadn't called
  his attention to it."</p>

  <p>"And sharpened like a razor? That's hardly good enough, Mrs. Laval."</p>

  <p>"I never harmed the old woman!" whined Norbert. "Look! you've got to
  listen to me, Mike! It couldn't have been me. I never heard of such a thing
  as shooting air in a person's veins until I read it in the paper!... And
  where would I have got a hypodermic syringe?"</p>

  <p>"We'll find that out before we're through."</p>

  <p>"Oh, God, you've <i>got</i> to listen to me! I had no reason to kill
  her...We talked about the will and she told me she hadn't had time to sign it
  yet."</p>

  <p>"He's lying there," put in Radigan suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly he's lying," said Mike. "When we told him that the will wasn't
  signed, he almost passed out from shock."</p>

  <p>"Oh, won't you believe me?" wailed Norbert. "I swear I never harmed
  her."</p>

  <p>"You were the last to see her alive?"</p>

  <p>"No! No!... Listen! I was talking to her there in the boudoir and there
  was a knock at the door. And she said: 'You mustn't be found here at this
  hour. Go back downstairs.' And hustled me into the dressing room alongside
  and closed the door."</p>

  <p>"Who was it knocked?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. She closed the door, I tell you. And they talked low. She
  was all right when I left her. I swear it!"</p>

  <p>"Not a very likely story," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to come with me," said Radigan. "Best come quietly for the
  lady's sake."</p>

  <p>Norbert gave up. "I'm not going to make any trouble," he whined.</p>

  <p>Radigan patted him all over to make sure he was not armed.</p>

  <p>"Does he carry a flask?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>Radigan shook his head.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laval disappeared for a moment, returning with hat and coat.</p>

  <p>"Don't you come," said Mike quickly. "There's no need of it."</p>

  <p>The penciled eyebrows ran up. "Allow me to be the judge of that."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of the old gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. My husband doesn't require <i>your</i> sympathy."</p>

  <p>God help him! thought Mike.</p>

  <p>When they hustled Norbert through the lobby of the apartment house, the
  eyes of the hall men almost popped out of their heads. Mrs. Laval held her
  chin high. Norbert had practically to be carried across the sidewalk to a
  cab. They thrust him into the back seat. Mrs. Laval slipped in beside him and
  took him in her arms, daring the other two with fiery eyes to blame her.
  Norbert clung to her, weeping. It was a pitiful exhibition. Mike and Radigan
  felt personally shamed by it, and, sitting on the two folding seats, stared
  ahead through the windshield.</p>

  <p>Having accomplished his object, Mike had no desire to prolong the scene.
  That was the business of the police. Instead of feeling any elation, he was
  disgusted with the business: murder, illicit love, disgrace for a harmless
  old man. He thought longingly of his farm on the Delaware; the clean November
  landscape and a fire on the hearth. If he could only get away to it! If he
  could take Day Radnor there! But she would never come.</p>

  <p>He had them drop him off at the French Building, where MacKelcan had his
  offices.</p>

  <p>The attorney occupied a small and soberly furnished suite at one of the
  choicest business addresses in midtown. He employed a pale young clerk who
  never appeared to raise his eyes from his desk and never spoke unless he was
  spoken to. His real right hand man was his secretary, Miss Lottie Bedford, an
  excessively plain young woman who, like so many secretaries, exhibited a kind
  of burlesque of her employer's effusive, talkative manner. With all this
  pseudo-animation, her eyes remained as expressionless as a dead person's.
  Mike wondered how deep she was in MacKelcan's confidence. Being a woman, she
  could, of course, be cajoled, but he shuddered at the task. There was
  something about this girl that turned a man clammy.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mr. Speedon," she gushed. "I read your column every day.
  So clever! Isn't it lovely weather? One hates to have to stay indoors. Mr.
  MacKelcan is alone. You can go right in."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Mike.</p>

  <p>As he entered the private office he was thinking about flasks. How had
  Norbert carried the whisky with which Mrs. Ware presumably had been doped?
  Consequently, he received a slight shock when the first thing he saw was a
  silver flask standing on MacKelcan's desk. The outer cap served as a jigger.
  The attorney was in the act of swallowing a drink.</p>

  <p>"Ha, Mike!" he cried. "Just in time! Will you join me in a spot of whisky?
  There's a paper cup alongside the watercooler. Straight or diluted?"</p>

  <p>Mike was staring fascinated at the flask. He quickly lowered his eyes to
  avoid giving too much away. "I'll take a little water in mine."</p>

  <p>"I see you looking at the flask," MacKelcan went on. "Nobody carries them
  any more since prohibition was repealed, but I've reached the age where I
  need a little boost toward the end of the day, and a man in my position, you
  know, I can't be seen in a bar. So I always carry it on me!"</p>

  <p>"Very sensible of you," said Mike. "I just dropped in to ask if there was
  any news from England."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan raised his shoulders, spread out his hands, and mugged to
  express complete bafflement. "Not a word! I have had a cable, two cables, in
  fact, but my agent can find no trace of the heir. James Fawcett seems to have
  vanished into utter nothingness."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: Radigan must hear about that flask.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">FROM MacKelcan's office, Mike proceeded to his own rooms.
  What he had learned increased his uneasiness. At home there was a cable
  waiting for him which he eagerly tore open, hoping for light. But it brought
  him up against another blank wall. For, according to the report of his own
  agent in London, MacKelcan had been telling the truth&mdash;so far as London
  was concerned. MacKelcan <i>had</i> cabled to his agent instructing him to
  communicate with James Fawcett; the agent <i>had</i> been looking for Fawcett
  and was unable to locate him. And Mike's agent couldn't find him either.</p>

  <p>Mike cabled his man to transfer the search to the city of Newcastle,
  where, as mentioned in Mrs. Ware's will, Fawcett was supposed to have lived
  and worked before moving to London.</p>

  <p>At six o'clock Radigan called up from Headquarters. "Are you dining out
  tonight, Mike?"</p>

  <p>"All social engagements are off until we get our job done, Rad."</p>

  <p>"Okay, fellow. Meet me at Bonifacio's at six-thirty."</p>

  <p>"Anything new?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I want to talk things over. Norbert has been grilled for a couple
  of hours; he sticks to his story. He's being detained here. Mrs. L. has gone
  home."</p>

  <p>"All right. See you at six-thirty."</p>

  <p>Radigan's stolid face bore a worried frown when he sat down opposite Mike
  in the restaurant. So did Mike's face.</p>

  <p>"Mike," said the former, "I'm not satisfied that this case has
  broken."</p>

  <p>"Neither am I," said Mike. "Tell me first what your doubts are."</p>

  <p>"It's that typed order for the syringes that was received by Emory and
  Almond. There is not a single typographical error in it. It must have been
  written by somebody who was familiar with the typewriter. Well, so far as I
  can find out, Norbert Besson has never done a tap of work in his life, and
  certainly Mrs. Laval has never flattened her elegant finger tips on the keys.
  Neither of them possesses a typewriter or is in any way connected with a
  place where typewriters are used. And it don't seem likely that they would
  hire anybody to do it for them. Too hellish dangerous. Being lovers, they had
  to trust each other, but not an outsider."</p>

  <p>"You're right, Rad...Why the hell do you suppose the murderer required
  <i>two</i> syringes?"</p>

  <p>"You can search me!... What are your doubts?"</p>

  <p>"Well, to start with, the old lady could not have been stuck with the
  syringe while she was conscious. It had to be too carefully placed. The
  autopsy indicated that she had been doped with a heavy dose of barbital, and
  our own investigation suggested that she and her murderer had partaken of a
  little drink together in which the barbital was no doubt administered. The
  old lady loved her whisky, and after all the excitement she would be wanting
  a drink. But no container for whisky was found. If it was Norbert who gave
  her a drink, what did he carry the whisky in?"</p>

  <p>"That's a hard one, Mike!"</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, I learned today that Sanford MacKelcan carries a flask
  at all times."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be jiggered!" said Radigan, staring. "... But wait a minute,
  Mike. MacKelcan had no motive for liquidating the old woman."</p>

  <p>"A motive is beginning to appear. No trace of the supposed heir, James
  Fawcett, can be found, and it looks as if there never was such a person.
  MacKelcan may have invented him. While the search drags on, MacKelcan will be
  in sole control of the estate, and he's clever enough to hypothecate a share
  of it to his own use without leaving any traces. As soon as he heard of the
  other will he had to act quick, because that will would have brought in
  Keppelman and the bank as co-executors, and given the estate to Norbert
  Besson."</p>

  <p>"The letter box was hired four months ago."</p>

  <p>"MacKelcan may keep that for all sorts of shady transactions."</p>

  <p>Radigan considered it for a while in silence. "There's a hole in your
  theory," he said at last. "It won't hold water."</p>

  <p>"How come?"</p>

  <p>"The action of barbital is not instantaneous. An ordinary dose takes about
  an hour to have any effect. Perhaps a strong dose might work in half an hour,
  but in any case MacKelcan&mdash;if MacKelcan was there&mdash;couldn't have
  given the old lady a drink and seen her pass out before his eyes. He couldn't
  have been with her long. He was out of the place by one-forty. We have
  conclusive evidence as to that. It won't work, Mike."</p>

  <p>"Damn!" said Mike, "All our theories fall down before we've finished
  building them, like houses of cards."</p>

  <p>"You'd better not let go of Norbert. Though we can't at the moment
  establish a container for the whisky, there's still a case against him.
  Possibly Norbert, knowing the old lady's tastes, had in his pocket an
  ordinary pint bottle or half pint that he bought in a liquor store, and threw
  it away afterwards."</p>

  <p>"I'm not letting anybody go," said Mike, "but I'm convinced that MacKelcan
  is playing a deep game."</p>

  <p>"He's one of those men," said Radigan, "that always makes you feel he's
  playing a deep game. He makes a mysterious business even of sitting on the
  john."</p>

  <p>Mike laughed.</p>

  <p>"Let's take a look at what happened in the old lady's apartment Tuesday
  night," Radigan continued. "She got home from the hay ride about
  twelve-twenty. She had eight guests with her. Others came in. About thirty in
  all. Mrs. Ware was good and sore because people in the street had given her
  the bird. She went upstairs and togged herself out in her satin and diamonds.
  She came down again about twelve-forty.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile the guests downstairs had been hitting it up on the free booze.
  Mrs. Ware accused Bethesda Prior of being responsible for the hay-ride flop,
  and they quarreled. They went back upstairs to have it out, Bethesda left the
  apartment at twelve fifty-five or one o'clock. As for Norbert, he has
  confessed that he went up to Mrs. Ware's boudoir soon after he saw Bethesda
  leave. He found Mrs. Ware all excited, he said, but he calmed her down. He
  wasn't with her more than fifteen or twenty minutes, he said, when there was
  a knock at the door. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that he's telling the
  truth, and somebody did come to the door. MacKelcan, let us say. It must then
  have been one-ten or one-fifteen. Which would give Mack only fifteen minutes
  to do his job."</p>

  <p>"Hardly enough," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"Let's go over the suspects, one by one," Radigan went on, ticking them
  off on his fingers. "First, Bethesda Prior..."</p>

  <p>"You can have Bethesda," interrupted Mike. "As far as I'm concerned, she's
  out."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"We are agreed that this murder was the result of days or weeks, maybe
  months of plotting. Bethesda was making too good a thing out of the old lady
  to plot her murder in advance. They quarreled, yes, and then Bethesda saw her
  two hundred grand go glimmering. But she couldn't have foreseen that
  quarrel."</p>

  <p>"Okay, I'll drop Bethesda until something new crops up. Next we have the
  Besson-Laval combination. That is still our best bet. They have everything.
  Next MacKelcan, whom you favor. But you can't convict Mack just because he
  carries a pocket flask. There's no evidence yet that he ever saw Mrs. Ware on
  Tuesday night."</p>

  <p>"I'll look for it," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"Finally, there are the two servants, Cummings and Alfred. Alfred is too
  dumb and ignorant to have pulled off such a job alone..."</p>

  <p>"These dumb bunnies often have a cunning of their own."</p>

  <p>"Sure; but if Alfred's in it, I believe it is a Cummings-Alfred job. If
  Norbert was cleared, I would lay it to the servants, simply because they had
  all the time in the world for the job after the guests went home. There is
  nothing to prove that either one went to bed at all that night. Here's
  another point against Cummings. He lied to us. Norbert says that when he
  first started for Mrs. Ware's room, he saw Cummings entering the elevator
  with a drink of whisky on a server. That drink must have been for Mrs. Ware,
  because there was nobody else upstairs. So Cummings <i>did</i> see the Madam
  after the Prior woman had left. Norbert waited until Cummings came down
  before he went up."</p>

  <p>"No motive has been shown for Cummings to do it."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he was acting for another; maybe he was hired to do it. Somebody
  could afford to pay well to have Mrs. Ware eliminated."</p>

  <p>"That would be the mysterious James Fawcett, the heir, who apparently does
  not exist. So we are back where we started."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. That suggests a new combination. Suppose Cummings is
  working for MacKelcan?"</p>

  <p>"That's hard to believe when you see how they hate each other."</p>

  <p>"Accomplices often hate each other like poison," said Radigan, "but they
  are forced to stick together by their crime."</p>

  <p>"Sure; but Cummings and MacKelcan are making no pretense of sticking
  together. They're working against each other every minute."</p>

  <p>Between mouthfuls they argued it back and forth. Radigan spoke with the
  voice of experience, while Mike was the gifted amateur. They had finished
  eating and were lighting cigars, when a waiter came to the booth to say that
  Lieutenant Radigan was wanted on the phone.</p>

  <p>"I left word at Headquarters where I was going to eat," Radigan explained
  to Mike as he got up.</p>

  <p>He presently returned wearing the expression of one who brings news. "Part
  of the Ware jewels have been recovered. It is the part that was insured. John
  Carpenter, the insurance detective, is bringing them to Headquarters, and the
  Inspector wants me to come down. His Nibs is giving off live steam through
  his clothes."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because Carpenter made no effort to take the thief...You'd better come
  along with me, Mike."</p>

  <p>"I'm not popular at Headquarters," said Mike, grinning.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the Inspector has got to have somebody to sound off at. It was you
  yesterday, it's Carpenter today. He's satisfied now that Norbert Besson did
  the job, and he'd be glad to make it up with you."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll oblige him," said Mike.</p>

  <p>They taxied down to Headquarters. In the corridor, while still some yards
  away, they heard angry voices issuing from Inspector Stillson's office. The
  Inspector was giving Carpenter hell, and the latter wasn't taking it. As they
  entered, the Inspector, very red in the face, was saying:</p>

  <p>"You're compounding with robbery!"</p>

  <p>The other man returned: "Why get excited, Inspector? You've known for
  years what my job is. I'm paid to recover stolen jewels and no questions
  asked."</p>

  <p>"I never liked it!" cried the Inspector, pounding the desk.</p>

  <p>Carpenter grinned aggravatingly. He was a round-headed man with a clipped
  mustache, so usual-looking as to defy description. He had had a lot of
  favorable publicity owing to the promptness with which he had acted in
  various famous robberies, and he was pretty sure of himself. It had been
  suggested by his enemies that he was really in cahoots with a ring of jewel
  thieves, but it could not be proved.</p>

  <p>On the Inspector's desk in a glittering pile lay four of Mrs. Ware's
  gorgeous diamond bracelets, and the pin with the Madhrapur emerald,
  surrounded by diamonds. These baubles with their enormous potentialities for
  evil, hypnotized the eyes of the beholders.</p>

  <p>"This is less than half the loot!" stormed the Inspector. "You let him get
  away with the rest!"</p>

  <p>"It's not my job to recover uninsured jewels, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"There's more in this crime than robbery. Murder is involved!"</p>

  <p>"I thought it was the theory of the police that the murder and the robbery
  were committed by different persons."</p>

  <p>"One led to the other. You helped a murderer to escape!"</p>

  <p>"I neither helped nor hindered him. I have my job to do, and the police
  have theirs."</p>

  <p>"Such actions are anti-social!" shouted the Inspector. He liked the sound
  of the word and repeated it. "Anti-social! Anti-social!"</p>

  <p>The Inspector paid little attention to the entrance of Mike and Radigan.
  His curt nod in Mike's direction merely signified that in the Inspector's
  estimation Mike was readmitted to the society of honest men. Mike smiled to
  himself and let it go at that.</p>

  <p>Neither he nor Radigan took any part in the wrangling match that was in
  progress. Carpenter got somewhat the better of it, because he kept his
  temper. By listening and putting one word with another, Mike learned what had
  happened. Immediately after Carpenter's advertisement had appeared, offering
  a reward of fifty thousand dollars for the return of the insured jewels, a
  man had called him on the phone at his office.</p>

  <p>"Would you know his voice again?" demanded the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"I doubt it, Inspector. It was not a natural-sounding voice."</p>

  <p>The man told Carpenter that the wanted jewels were in his possession, and
  asked how he could return them and collect the reward with safety to himself.
  Carpenter told him to send the jewels to his office, and if they were all
  right, he would send the reward in bills addressed to any name the man wanted
  to give in care of General Delivery, New York Post Office. "This is my usual
  method," Carpenter had explained to the man. "I expect to be in this business
  for a long time to come, and I can't afford to let you down."</p>

  <p>On the following day the jewels arrived in the mail. Carpenter had brought
  along the wrapper to show the Inspector. An ordinary piece of stout manila
  paper which, judging from its wrinkles, had been used before. The address had
  been pasted on in capital letters cut from newspaper headlines. It had been
  mailed at Station D, New York. Whereupon Carpenter had mailed the money to
  Henry J. Jackson, care General Delivery, as instructed, and after waiting
  twenty-four hours to give the man time to get it, had come to the police. It
  was as simple as that.</p>

  <p>"Did you mark the bills?" demanded the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"That is not our custom," said Carpenter firmly.</p>

  <p>"You're no better than a fence! A kid glove fence! You encourage
  robbery!"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's for my employers to decide, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Sanford MacKelcan had also been sent for, and the scene was brought to an
  end by his arrival. MacKelcan gave Carpenter a receipt for the jewels, and
  the latter rose to go.</p>

  <p>"I presume you will want to reinsure the jewels," he said to
  MacKelcan.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, yes, I suppose so," said the attorney, who could never say
  anything out and out. "Why, yes, Mr. Carpenter, I suppose it is up to me to
  reinsure on behalf of the estate."</p>

  <p>"I'll see that a new policy is sent to your office tomorrow, sir."</p>

  <p>The air was sulphurous for a while after Carpenter had left. "You see what
  we're up against!" cried the Inspector. "And my hands are tied. By God! I'm
  going to ask for new legislation to control this infamous jewel robbery
  racket!"</p>

  <p>"May I make a suggestion?" put in Mike mildly.</p>

  <p>"Anybody's free to make a suggestion," grumbled the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"The thief will be feeling pretty good just about now," said Mike. "Having
  received his fifty grand without any trouble or danger to himself. I suggest
  that Mr. MacKelcan immediately advertise a reward of seventy-five thousand
  for the return of the remaining jewels, and no questions asked. In this case
  there will be no strings on the action of the police, and the thief will be
  off his guard."</p>

  <p>"Good!" cried the Inspector. "Will you do that, Mr. MacKelcan?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Certainly! Anything to assist the ends of justice,
  Inspector."</p>

  <p>The advertisement was written out on the spot and dispatched to different
  newspapers.</p>

  <p>"If you receive any communication as a result of this, you will of course
  consult with me before acting on it, Mr. MacKelcan."</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, Inspector."</p>

  <p>The meeting broke up.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">ON Saturday morning the discovery of Mrs. Ware's murder was
  three days old. Today the newspapers were able to dish up a fresh sensation
  in the arrest of Norbert Besson&mdash;or, as it was put: "his detention at
  Headquarters." Mike Speedon disappeared from the news columns, and the
  <i>Recorder-Press</i> quietly abandoned its campaign on his behalf. It was no
  longer necessary.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laval was not detained, but she had destroyed herself by accompanying
  Norbert to Headquarters. The sly suggestions in the press of her relations
  with Norbert were much more exciting than the fact of his arrest. Everybody
  in her brittle world knew about it already, but it is quite another matter to
  have it printed in the newspapers for all the common people to read. As a
  social figure, Mrs. Laval was finished.</p>

  <p>In the same issues, the story of the recovery of a part of the jewels, and
  Sanford MacKelcan's offer of a huge reward for the return of the balance,
  provided secondary sensations.</p>

  <p>When his work was done at the office, Mike taxied to the Ware apartment to
  see what effect, if any, these published items were having on the members of
  that household. When he looked in to refresh his eyes with a sight of Day
  Radnor, to his disgust he found Sanford MacKelcan sitting in her office,
  ceaselessly crossing and uncrossing his skinny legs, twisting on his
  fundament, pulling at his lapels and emitting a copious flow of irrelevant
  conversation.</p>

  <p>Mike took a chair, grimly determined to sit him out. It made the lawyer
  nervous to have anyone looking at him steadily, and he left before long.</p>

  <p>"What the heck was he after?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>"I'm fired," said Day. "After next Saturday he says he would no longer
  feel justified in charging my salary against the estate."</p>

  <p>"But he was <i>after</i> something," said Mike, scowling. "I could see
  it."</p>

  <p>"Well, he offered me another job."</p>

  <p>"In his own office?"</p>

  <p>"No, in a new office he is opening. Office of the Ware Estate."</p>

  <p>"Then the estate would still be paying your salary."</p>

  <p>"You don't understand, beloved. He fires me first in order to bring a
  little pressure to bear..."</p>

  <p>"Will there be other employees in the Ware office?"</p>

  <p>"Not at present."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Mike grimly. "So he will have an opportunity of enjoying a
  tête-à-tête with you whenever he has a mind to. Don't take it, Day!"</p>

  <p>"The salary is excellent," she said provokingly.</p>

  <p>"The man is slimy!"</p>

  <p>"I shan't have to touch him."</p>

  <p>"Have you accepted his offer?"</p>

  <p>"You came in before I had time to. I must take it or leave it today,
  because he has another person in view."</p>

  <p>"Turn him down. Day!" he said earnestly. "Look, I'll chase around and
  scare up some kind of a job for you..."</p>

  <p>"I don't want a job scared up. I want a real salary."</p>

  <p>"What's he going to pay you a big salary for?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think I can take care of myself, darling?"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, don't darling me! Sure, you can keep him off, but you'll
  only be fired, if you do. Promise me you won't take his job."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no promises," she said airily. "It all depends on how I feel when he
  comes back for his answer."</p>

  <p>Mike flung out of the room with a muttered oath. Day laughed when the door
  slammed. Bedeviling Mike Speedon is the chief diversion of a dull life, she
  thought.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile MacKelcan was watching Mike, and as soon as the young man was
  safely out of the way, the attorney returned to Day's office. "Well, how
  about it? What's the decision?" he asked jocosely. "Shall we be starting in
  together next Monday?"</p>

  <p>Day gave him a steely smile such as Mike had never seen. "Sorry," she
  said. "I am very much obliged to you for your offer, but I have decided not
  to accept it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed!" said the astonished MacKelcan. "Indeed, Miss! Well, just as
  you please! Just as you please! Just as you please!" He backed out as if
  somebody was threatening him, and left the apartment.</p>

  <p>Mike had started for the upstairs sitting room. In the upper corridor he
  met Kinsey, who was for passing him with her nose in the air, and the hint of
  a sniff. It came to Mike that he had all but made love to this woman for his
  own purposes two nights before, and she had reason to resent his present
  obliviousness. He might have use for her again.</p>

  <p>"Why, Miss Kinsey," he said, "I was studying so hard over this ugly
  business I almost passed you!" He opened the door of the boudoir. "Come in
  here for a moment. What do you think about the latest development?"</p>

  <p>Kinsey stiffened righteously. "Norbert Besson may well have done it, Mr.
  Speedon, but why didn't they arrest the woman with him? He was merely a tool
  in her hands."</p>

  <p>"I agree," said Mike..."You are bearing up well under this awful
  situation," he added admiringly.</p>

  <p>Kinsey bridled in her elderly ladies'-maid fashion. "Nobody considers what
  <i>my</i> feelings may be, Mr. Speedon."</p>

  <p>"You're wrong. Miss Kinsey. I was just saying to Mr. MacKelcan how
  wonderfully you took it."</p>

  <p>"Mr. MacKelcan just gave me my notice," she said acidly. "A week!"</p>

  <p>"Would you like to stay on longer?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd like a chance to settle myself."</p>

  <p>"And I don't want to lose you, either," said Mike. "You just leave this
  matter to me. I'll arrange it."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I'm much obliged to you, Mr. Speedon."</p>

  <p>"We must have other talks together, Miss Kinsey. I'm depending on
  you!"</p>

  <p>Observing the woman's cold gray eyes and censorious air, Mike thought: She
  had every opportunity to murder her mistress&mdash;but I don't know any
  reason why she should.</p>

  <p>Mike's next encounter was with Cummings, who came to the door of the room
  and asked permission to speak to him. Today something had again interrupted
  the orderly progress of Cummings' metabolism. His bile had overflowed; his
  eyes were savage with rage, however demurely he kept them lowered and
  smoothly spoke. Mike thought: If this man is not a murderer, it is not
  because he lacks the will to murder.</p>

  <p>The butler murmured: "Mr. Speedon, I know it's a liberty, but I wanted to
  ask you what took place at Police Headquarters last evening. Of course, I
  know the newspapers didn't tell all."</p>

  <p>"You mean about Norbert Besson?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not that," said Cummings impatiently.</p>

  <p>Strange! thought Mike, if he has such a keen interest, that Norbert's
  arrest should be of no importance.</p>

  <p>"I mean about the recovery of the jewels," Cummings went on. "Have the
  police any clue as to the robber? Are they taking steps to arrest him?"</p>

  <p>Mike had no intention of satisfying him. "What I learned at Headquarters
  was given me in confidence, Cummings. Sorry, but my mouth is padlocked."</p>

  <p>"Of course, sir. Naturally." Cummings lingered.</p>

  <p>"But if you have any theory as to the robber you can help by telling it to
  me," Mike suggested. "It will be received in confidence."</p>

  <p>"How should I know anything, Mr. Speedon? I never get out of the
  house."</p>

  <p>This answer struck Mike as curious. Why should it be necessary to leave
  the house?</p>

  <p>Cummings was summoned downstairs to deal with a persistent applicant at
  the door. Adele, who had evidently been watching her chance, ran in.</p>

  <p>"Well, beautiful!" said Mike.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Speedon," she said breathlessly. "I think Alfred is sick up in
  his room. He lies there moaning. Nobody ever goes up on the third floor
  except Mr. Cummings."</p>

  <p>Mike refused to betray any excitement. "I'll attend to it, darling. Run
  away before Cummings comes back, and say nothing to the other servants."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what do you suppose has happened now!" she breathed.</p>

  <p>Mike went to her. "Nothing very serious, I expect...At any rate, it hasn't
  hurt your looks, pretty thing! Kiss me and beat it!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, isn't it terrible!" she murmured, clinging to him for a moment.
  Nevertheless, it was clear that she was enjoying the excitement.</p>

  <p>Mike closed the door after her, and made haste to call Radigan at Police
  Headquarters on the private phone.</p>

  <p>"Rad," he said softly, "I want you to do something for me. Think up some
  trick to get Cummings down to Headquarters again, pronto. He's having a rag
  baby to know what's going on, and you can get him that way. I must get him
  out of the house for an hour. I'm on the track of something here. I'll
  explain later."</p>

  <p>"Okay, Mike."</p>

  <p>"Here's another thing. I learned this morning that MacKelcan is getting
  ready to break up this establishment. We don't want to have these people
  scattered. Let the Inspector give Mack a tip that it would oblige the police
  if he kept everything going here until the murder is solved, or at least
  until the police have to throw up their hands."</p>

  <p>"I'll do that, Mike."</p>

  <p>"So long. I'll be calling you later."</p>

  <p>Cummings had already knocked at the door. Mike kept him waiting until he
  had hung up. Cummings knew that Mike had been telephoning, and when he
  entered, his face was pinched and hateful with balked curiosity.</p>

  <p>A futile conversation followed, Cummings most respectful; Mike very
  offhand; each trying to elicit information without giving any, and neither
  deceiving the other.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes, Adele came to the door again. "If you please, Mr.
  Cummings, you are wanted on the phone."</p>

  <p>Cummings, so obsequious toward Mike, was in the same measure arrogant with
  the under servants. "Who is it?" he asked curtly.</p>

  <p>"The man wouldn't say, sir. He had an important voice."</p>

  <p>Cummings, turning to Mike, became silky again. "Was there anything more,
  Mr. Speedon?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing more, thank you, Cummings," said Mike, swallowing the desire to
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir. Thank you, sir." He and Adele went away.</p>

  <p>In ten minutes Adele returned to say that Cummings had left the apartment.
  "He didn't tell anybody where he was going or when he'd be back, but I was
  watching, and I saw him slip out the service door."</p>

  <p>"Fine," said Mike. "You go back to your work and I'll look after
  Alfred."</p>

  <p>Her face fell. "But I want to know what's the matter!"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you later. We don't want any fuss raised now."</p>

  <p>Adele went down the service stairs while Mike went up. On the floor above
  he entered Alfred's room without knocking. The big young man, partly dressed,
  was lying across his bed, moaning softly, and holding his arm. His naturally
  high color had faded to a livid pallor. Mike asked him no questions.</p>

  <p>"Let's have a look at that arm," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Speedon, I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do!"
  mourned Alfred.</p>

  <p>From the look of the limb and the pain Alfred was suffering, Mike judged
  that the arm was broken, or at least fractured. He marveled at the strength
  of one who could break a man's arm by twisting it.</p>

  <p>"Look here, this can't go on," he said bluntly.</p>

  <p>"The man will kill you before he's through. There's murder in his eyes
  today."</p>

  <p>"Don't I know it!" wailed Alfred. "Oh, whatever shall I do?"</p>

  <p>"You've got to make a clean breast of the whole thing now. What is he
  torturing you for?"</p>

  <p>"If I tell, he will certainly kill me!"</p>

  <p>"The police will protect you from him. Whatever you've done, you'd better
  tell. Anything would be better than being murdered."</p>

  <p>"I haven't done anything, Mr. Speedon. I'm a good boy!" He started up in a
  kind of weak anger. "It's him! It's him, I tell you! He's a bloody-minded
  brute! He takes a pleasure in hurting me. Oh, I hate him! I hate him! I wish
  I could kill <i>him</i>!"</p>

  <p>Mike considered the pitiful creature grimly: so big and so soft; little
  better than simple-minded; the typical male domestic. Yet there was that
  cunning in his face that appertains to simple minds. "That wouldn't do you
  any good," said Mike. "The truth has got to come out now."</p>

  <p>Alfred hesitated in an agony of indecision. "Where is he?" he asked
  hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"He's been summoned down to Headquarters."</p>

  <p>"What for?" Alfred demanded in fresh terror.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. It was just a trick to get him out of the way. He can't get back
  under an hour, and by that time I'll have you in a hospital. He can't get at
  you there."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm afraid to tell!" mourned Alfred.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I'm only a poor ignorant boy. I'll be done out of my rights..." With his
  good hand he reached for Mike's hand and pressed it fawningly. "You wouldn't
  do me wrong, would you, Mr. Speedon?"</p>

  <p>Mike jerked his hand away. "For God's sake, whatever it is, it will be
  given full publicity. When there's publicity, nobody can do anybody."</p>

  <p>"If I tell where the jewels are, I'm entitled to the reward," Alfred said
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"Did you steal them?"</p>

  <p>"No! No! Mr. Speedon. It was Cummings stole them! He knows that I know he
  stole them and he said he'd kill me if I told. That's what all the trouble's
  about."</p>

  <p>"Certainly you're entitled to the reward if they are recovered through
  you. Where are they?"</p>

  <p>Alfred's face worked like a child's from the pain in his arm and the agony
  of making a decision. He hesitated so long that the impatient Mike said: "Ah,
  the hell with you," and turned toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Don't leave me! Don't leave me!" squalled Alfred. "I'll tell!" He
  swallowed hard. "They're... they're in the brass bed in the next room!"</p>

  <p>"The brass bed!" repeated Mike, staring. "That bed was thoroughly
  searched. They cut the mattress to pieces."</p>

  <p>"I know, but they never thought to look inside the posts."</p>

  <p>"The posts?"</p>

  <p>"They look solid, but they're hollow, really, and the ornament on the top
  unscrews. I saw Cummings dropping the jewels inside. I woke up Tuesday night
  and heard a noise, and I knew nobody had any business in that room, and I
  crept to the door and looked in, and I saw what Cummings was doing. It's the
  right-hand post at the foot of the bed."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be damned!" said Mike. "How simple!"</p>

  <p>When he had recovered a little from his astonishment, he said: "I'll take
  you to the hospital first."</p>

  <p>"No!" said Alfred. "I don't want to leave them here. I've suffered too
  much for them things. I can stand the pain a little longer. Get them out
  before we go."</p>

  <p>"I want another witness present," said Mike. "I'll phone for him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, hurry! hurry!" wailed Alfred.</p>

  <p>Mike ran back to the boudoir and got Radigan on the wire. "Rad," he said,
  "can you come up here quick?"</p>

  <p>Radigan was all attention. "Has the case broken?"</p>

  <p>"The robbery end has. Listen! can you fix it so that Cummings is detained
  for a little while at Headquarters? I want you to get here first."</p>

  <p>"Okay, Mike."</p>

  <p>"Listen! if your car has a jack in it, fetch it up to the apartment under
  your coat."</p>

  <p>Radigan borrowed the Inspector's red car with a siren and a demon driver,
  and arrived in ten minutes with a jack. In the meantime, Mike had been
  helping Alfred to get his clothes on.</p>

  <p>Mike told Radigan what had happened while they worked over the bed. Alfred
  sat watching them, nursing his arm and apparently almost fainting with pain.
  It was the work of a minute or two to jack up one corner of the heavy bed.
  Mike, with fingers that trembled a little, unscrewed the bottom member of the
  brass post. When it came off in his hand, a little flood of glistening
  diamonds and emeralds poured out on the floor. After the jewels came the key
  to the antique oaken cabinet. Mike and Radigan stared at each other and
  severally expressed the conviction that they would be damned.</p>

  <p>"This will make the searchers look silly," said Radigan.</p>

  <p>Mike said: "The simplest hiding places are the best."</p>

  <p>The balance of the loot was all there. The famous emerald and diamond
  tiara had been broken in several pieces in order to get it into its narrow
  hiding-place, but the bracelets were intact, the magnificent earrings and the
  ring with the immense square-cut emerald.</p>

  <p>"Put the stuff out of sight and let's get out of here," whined Alfred.
  "Cummings may come."</p>

  <p>"What difference does it make now?" said Mike.</p>

  <p>Alfred's voice scaled up. "I don't want to see him! I'm afraid!"</p>

  <p>"Radigan and I will protect you."</p>

  <p>They made lists in duplicate of what they had found, and both signed them.
  Radigan took one list, Mike the other, and Radigan scooped up the sparkling
  bits of loot.</p>

  <p>"Miss Radnor will give you a box to carry them in," said Mike; then to
  Alfred: "Come on, you."</p>

  <p>As they turned toward the door, Cummings appeared noiselessly in the
  opening.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Christ!" gasped Alfred, starting back.</p>

  <p>Cummings' face was like a yellowed mask, only the eyes alive. The eyes
  took note of the jewels in Radigan's hands. "Where are you going?" he asked
  Alfred in a level voice.</p>

  <p>Alfred was speechless. Mike said dryly: "I'm taking him to the hospital.
  His arm appears to be broken."</p>

  <p>"And you're coming with me!" put in Radigan grimly.</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"Robbing the dead."</p>

  <p>Cummings actually laughed, a dry sort of cackle. "So he told you I stole
  them, eh? Can't you see for yourselves that <i>he's</i> the thief? Look how
  he shakes!"</p>

  <p>"Naturally; he's all in," said Mike, "thanks to you."</p>

  <p>"Where were they?" asked Cummings.</p>

  <p>Alfred edged closer to Mike. "You know where they were!" he squalled.
  "Inside the brass post. I saw you put them there!"</p>

  <p>Cummings clamped his teeth together and was silent for all of five
  seconds. His face seemed to become a tinge yellower. "You're a liar!" he said
  in the same level voice. Mike could understand Alfred's terror of him. The
  man's stillness was diabolic. He turned to Mike.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe his story, Mr. Speedon?"</p>

  <p>"What's your story?" countered Mike.</p>

  <p>"It's true I've been hurting him," said Cummings coolly, "but I didn't
  mean to break his arm&mdash;if it is broken. I knew from the first that he
  must be the thief, and I was trying to force a confession from him."</p>

  <p>"He's lying!" shouted Alfred. "He's trying to lie me into the
  penitentiary!"</p>

  <p>Cummings ignored him. "If I was the thief, what reason would I have for
  hurting him?"</p>

  <p>"To scare him into keeping his mouth shut," suggested Mike.</p>

  <p>Cummings shook his head. "If I hurt him <i>before</i> he said anything, it
  would only make him desperate."</p>

  <p>"My word is as good as his!" Alfred cried out.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Mike, "but no better."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," put in Radigan. "Alfred got in his story first. Cummings
  is just trying to shake it."</p>

  <p>"Alfred can't get away with anything like that," said Cummings. "I'm
  satisfied to go with you, Lieutenant, and let the whole police force question
  me. But I warn you not to pay the reward to this rat, because I'll recover it
  in the end."</p>

  <p>"Big talk. Buddy!" said Radigan. "Being as you've got your hat and coat,
  let's go."</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>After Alfred had been lodged in the Lenox Hill Hospital (his arm
  <i>was</i> broken) and Cummings in a detention cell at Headquarters, Mike and
  Radigan got together to talk it over. Mike tended to believe in Cummings'
  story, and Radigan in Alfred's.</p>

  <p>"Cummings is fooling you," said Radigan. "He's a smart guy. He knows all
  the answers. And Alfred is just a poor damn fool. You have to learn to
  distinguish...What the hell are you laughing at now?"</p>

  <p>"Skip it," said Mike. "I've got a screw-ball sense of humor."</p>

  <p>"I'll say you have," grumbled Radigan. "... Cummings can afford to be so
  cool and sure of himself," he went on, "because he's got that young lad
  frightened silly, and he knows it. Alfred can't stand up to him. But that
  don't affect the rights of the matter."</p>

  <p>"Why should Cummings have tortured Alfred?"</p>

  <p>"He's a psychopathic case and takes a pleasure in hurting the lad."</p>

  <p>Mike shook his head. "I grant you that Cummings may be the murderer; in
  fact, I wouldn't put any crime past him. But in this particular instance, his
  story has the sound of truth."</p>

  <p>"You can't go by the sound of a story."</p>

  <p>"Sure, you can! What have we got instincts for?"</p>

  <p>"You can't take your instincts into a court of law, son. You've got to
  have evidence."</p>

  <p>Mike laughed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p class="first">UPON learning from Takaku over the phone that there was a
  cable message for him at his flat, Mike went to get it. His little
  bespectacled servitor greeted him with a toothy smile. Takaku, while working
  around the flat, always wore a capacious striped apron that covered him from
  neck to knees. He had been having a hard time in this era of anti-Japanese
  feeling, and was filled with a passion of gratitude toward his master because
  Mike still treated him as a human being, though Japanese.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Mister Mike. Please, you well?"</p>

  <p>"I am well, Takaku. And you?"</p>

  <p>"I very well, sir. Thank you very much. I happy to see you."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, why don't you close up that store, Takaku, and work here
  all the time?"</p>

  <p>"That make too great a loss, sir, thank you very much. All my savings in
  that store. Please, I think I hang on for a while. Better times coming."</p>

  <p>The cable had originated in Newcastle, England, and its contents were
  surprising enough. Once again, Mike's theories about the case were knocked
  into a cocked hat.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">JAMES FAWCETT WELL KNOWN IN MINING CIRCLES HERE. RALPH
  MAXWELL, PRESIDENT MINERS LOCAL, INTIMATE FRIEND TWENTY YEARS. HAS NOT HEARD
  FROM FAWCETT SINCE HE WENT TO LONDON. FAWCETT OFTEN TOLD MAXWELL HIS AUNT WAS
  MARRIED ONE OF RICHEST MEN IN AMERICA. SHALL I CABLE MAXWELL'S FULL
  STORY?</p>

  <p><br>
  Mike deliberated on this for less than one minute. A newspaper advertisement
  informed him that one of the Atlantic clippers was flying from England next
  day. It would be expensive, but he decided it was worth it. He glanced at his
  watch. A little after hours, but the officials would still be at the bank. He
  could get the money as an accommodation.</p>

  <p>He taxied to the bank, received the money, and, proceeding to the New York
  office of the clippers, paid for a passage. Then from a near-by cable office
  he sent the following message:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">SEND MAXWELL BY CLIPPER TOMORROW TO TESTIFY NEW YORK.
  PASSAGE PAID THIS END.</p>

  <p><br>
  Mike returned to his rooms. His next job, as he had promised Radigan, was to
  look for evidence, if any such existed, that MacKelcan had talked to Mrs.
  Ware after Norbert Besson had left her on the fatal night. Unfortunately,
  Mike had no line of approach to MacKelcan except through his office
  employees, and when he recollected the glassy-eyed Miss Bedford, MacKelcan's
  secretary, he knew that to go to his office for information would only be to
  expose his hand without getting anywhere.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to make a frontal attack. Mike got out his
  little book and studied the notes he had made of each of his talks with
  MacKelcan. He found, as he had expected, that during lunch on Thursday the
  attorney had given him an opening which he had allowed to pass at the time,
  because he didn't want to arouse his suspicions.</p>

  <p>Mike reached for the telephone. MacKelcan was in his office. "Can I have a
  little talk with you?" asked Mike. "About the subject we are both most
  interested in?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! Sure! At your service, Mike. Any time. Come on over now if you're
  disengaged."</p>

  <p>"No. I don't want to interrupt business. What time are you leaving your
  office?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, five-thirty or quarter to six."</p>

  <p>"Meet me at Jack and Charlie's for a drink at six."</p>

  <p>A pleased note came into MacKelcan's voice. "Very nice! Very nice! But ...
  er... that's a very exclusive place. I've been told you can't get in if you
  are not known to the doorkeeper."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jimmie's a pal of mine. I'll fix it."</p>

  <p>"Most pleased," said MacKelcan. "At six, then."</p>

  <p>Mike, suspecting that the attorney would be prompt, took care to arrive at
  the restaurant a few minutes ahead of time. "Jimmie," he said to the
  doorkeeper, "I'm expecting a long-legged guy in a white waistcoat. Name of
  MacKelcan. Do me a favor, will you, and treat him as if he was the Duke of
  Windsor? It's a racket."</p>

  <p>"Okay, Mr. Speedon, MacKelcan, is it? Don't you think I read the
  papers?"</p>

  <p>"Gosh!" said Mike. "I keep forgetting how famous we all are."</p>

  <p>The pretty hat-check girl herself brought MacKelcan to Mike's table in the
  back room, a mark of unusual distinction. The attorney was grinning from ear
  to ear and throwing his legs out wide. To smarten himself, he had bought a
  white carnation as big as a saucer.</p>

  <p>"Where's the wedding?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>An alarmed look came into MacKelcan's face. "Isn't this correct at this
  hour?" he asked, prepared to snatch out the flower instanter.</p>

  <p>"Sure! Sure!" said Mike. "Enjoy yourself in your own way. Sit down! Smoke
  up! What are you drinking?"</p>

  <p>"What does one drink here?" asked MacKelcan self-consciously.</p>

  <p>"Everything in the world from applejack to zinfandel!"</p>

  <p>MacKelcan gave him a sharp look signifying: I see you have had several
  already. Which was precisely what Mike wished him to believe.</p>

  <p>Mike was in no hurry to come to the point. Let MacKelcan get a couple of
  drinks under his belt first. They ordered daiquiris. It was a busy hour at
  Jack and Charlie's with people continually coming and going, and lined up
  four deep at the bar. Face after face that passed by was familiar to every
  reader of the newspapers. MacKelcan was so impressed that he was almost
  silenced.</p>

  <p>"This is the real cheese!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>Many paused at the table to exchange a word or two with Mike; marvelously
  turned out women such as MacKelcan had scarcely ever been so close to, and
  men that he was continually reading about. Mike made a point of introducing
  them all to the attorney. MacKelcan at the moment was enjoying a good deal of
  publicity in connection with the Ware case, and they looked at him curiously.
  This interest in him that real celebrities were displaying went to his head
  like wine.</p>

  <p>"I have led too restricted a life," he confided in Mike. "Too narrow! Too
  narrow! After all, I'm not an unsuccessful man. I could afford to spread
  myself a bit. Hereafter I mean to live a man's life."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: Counting on rich pickings from the Ware estate.</p>

  <p>"You said you wanted to talk to me," said MacKelcan at last.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord!" groaned Mike. "The Ware case has pretty near got me down! But
  we must talk about it, I suppose. I'm right up against it. With your trained
  legal mind, you ought to be able to help."</p>

  <p>"Always delighted to be of assistance," said MacKelcan. "Always delighted.
  Put your difficulties before me. I had made up my mind it was Norbert done
  it."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he did," said Mike, "but there are important links missing in the
  evidence. We haven't been able to connect him with the hypodermic syringe.
  Dr. Patton says he doesn't know either Besson or Mrs. Laval."</p>

  <p>"That's nothing. Almost anybody could write to Dr. Patton in such a way as
  to draw a reply from him on his letterhead."</p>

  <p>"That's worth noting."</p>

  <p>"And anyhow, maybe the old lady wasn't killed with a syringe at all. It's
  only a hypothesis. The prick left by a needle would be hard to establish
  after twelve hours had passed."</p>

  <p>"But she was certainly killed by little bubbles of air in her heart...
  little bubbles of air!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't help you with the medical evidence. I'm a complete
  ignoramus there...What about Cummings?"</p>

  <p>"No evidence. I suppose you've read the evening papers. All that between
  him and Alfred throws no additional light on the murder."</p>

  <p>"I distrust that man!" said MacKelcan feelingly.</p>

  <p>"Same here."</p>

  <p>"He has a sinister face."</p>

  <p>"Do you know," said Mike very carelessly, "you said something at lunch on
  Thursday that has been bothering me ever since."</p>

  <p>The other man turned wary. "What was that, Mike?"</p>

  <p>"You said that Mrs. Ware told you she had not signed the second will."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan puffed out his cheeks. "I couldn't have told you that, Mike,
  because it ain't so! She never told me; I just surmised that she hadn't had
  time yet to sign it."</p>

  <p>"But you did tell me that she told you, because I made a note of it right
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"You take notes of everything?" said MacKelcan, staring.</p>

  <p>"Sure. That's the only way I can keep it all straight in my mind."</p>

  <p>"What do you take all that trouble for, your paper?"</p>

  <p>"No. This is a personal matter. Don't forget that I have been as good as
  accused of this crime. They seem to have forgotten me for the moment, but I
  haven't been cleared."</p>

  <p>"Well! Well!" said MacKelcan. "You ought to be on the force."</p>

  <p>"When did Mrs. Ware tell you that she hadn't signed?"</p>

  <p>"I have no recollection of telling you any such thing!" blustered
  MacKelcan.</p>

  <p>"Then your recollection is at fault," said Mike politely, "because I wrote
  it down."</p>

  <p>"It was a slip of the tongue."</p>

  <p>"You knew that Keppelman had called on her Tuesday morning and that she
  had gone down to his office in the afternoon."</p>

  <p>"How was I to know a thing like that?"</p>

  <p>"You bribed a clerk of Keppelman's to tell you."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, who told you that?"</p>

  <p>"Keppelman. He fired the girl. But that girl did not know that the will
  was not signed."</p>

  <p>"Well, you <i>have</i> been a busy little cup of tea!" said MacKelcan,
  laughing. It had a sour sound.</p>

  <p>"It must have been late in the day when Mrs. Ware told you," persisted
  Mike.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan began to grow ugly. "I talked to her on the telephone."</p>

  <p>"Your recollection is at fault again," said Mike pleasantly, "because
  Kinsey gave me a complete account of Mrs. Ware's doings on Tuesday. It was
  after four when she got back from Keppelman's office. She called Norbert
  Besson but did not get him. She then wrote him a note and sent it by
  messenger. She made no other calls nor did she take any. She lay down to
  rest. You called her up, remember? and Kinsey told you she was sleeping. She
  took no calls while Kinsey was dressing her for the fancy-dress dinner. I
  have a complete account of the dinner, and she was not called away from the
  table. The hay ride followed, and the party in her own home. It must have
  been then that she told you."</p>

  <p>"I have already told you that I didn't see her at the party."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I understand why you would say that, under the circumstances,"
  Mike said with a soothing air.</p>

  <p>"Are you intimating that I'm a liar?" demanded MacKelcan.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mack! We all have to lie every day of our lives! Let's look at
  this realistically."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you think I killed her!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly! Would I be sitting here buying you drinks if I did?"</p>

  <p>At a near-by table sat a ravishingly pretty girl who was trying to attract
  Mike's attention in the hope that he might mention her in his column next
  day. Mike, wishing to smooth MacKelcan down now, smiled at her, whereupon she
  popped up and came over. After she had gushed a little, Mike introduced
  MacKelcan.</p>

  <p>"Not <i>the</i> Mr. MacKelcan! Oh, I'm so glad to meet you, Mr. MacKelcan.
  I've been reading about you every day. I was wondering what you were
  like..."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan's vanity was deliciously tickled. He played the gallant male
  while Mike rubbed his lip to hide a smile.</p>

  <p>When the girl returned to her escort, Mike decided to experiment with a
  lie. "Mack," he said in a friendly way, "I think I ought to tell you that the
  police have evidence that you talked with Mrs. Ware on Tuesday night."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan was brought back to earth with a thud. "What are you saying?
  What sort of evidence?"</p>

  <p>"Norbert Besson told them that while he was talking to Mrs. Ware in her
  boudoir, you knocked at the door..."</p>

  <p>"He's a liar!"</p>

  <p>"Quiet!"</p>

  <p>MacKelcan looked around uneasily to see if anybody had taken notice.</p>

  <p>"Norbert told them," Mike went on, "that she hustled him into the dressing
  room saying that you mustn't find him there."</p>

  <p>"What proof has he that it was me knocked?"</p>

  <p>"He says he put his ear to the dressing room door and heard you and Mrs.
  Ware talking."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan was careful to keep his voice down, but his tone was vicious.
  "An accused murderer snatching at any lie to save his own skin! What value
  has such evidence?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," said Mike. He saw that MacKelcan was shaken, and ventured
  to top his lie with another. "Unfortunately, there appears to be
  corroboration."</p>

  <p>"What sort of corroboration?"</p>

  <p>"Somebody else overheard you and Mrs. Ware talking in the boudoir."</p>

  <p>"Who was it?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Mack, but I pledged my word not to reveal that as yet."</p>

  <p>"It's all lies!"</p>

  <p>"Don't take that line, Mack," urged Mike with affected earnestness. "Take
  a friend's advice. A man in your position can't afford it. If the police put
  two witnesses on the stand who have no connection with each other, they'll
  discredit you. It will lead to all kinds of surmises. It will look bad for
  you. The thing for you to do is to come out with it, before they have a
  chance to testify."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan considered it, scowling. Mike had him in a corner. Finally he
  growled: "All right, I <i>did</i> have a talk with Mrs. Ware Tuesday night.
  So what?"</p>

  <p>"No reason in the world why you shouldn't," said Mike. "... By God! that
  clears Besson, then. You should have come out with it yesterday and saved the
  poor fellow a night in jail."</p>

  <p>"What is Norbert to me?" said MacKelcan. "I wouldn't soil my lips by
  naming what he is. Jail is too good for him...Besides, I haven't cleared him.
  If I interrupted his teet-a-teet with Mrs. Ware, what was to prevent his
  running back upstairs and finishing the job after I left? I left him in the
  apartment, remember."</p>

  <p>"Sure, it's very likely," agreed Mike. "What did you and Mrs. Ware talk
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Not much. She wasn't herself."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, not herself?"</p>

  <p>"Well, she was dopey, kind of; half falling asleep."</p>

  <p>"That's interesting. Maybe she was just putting it on to get rid of
  you."</p>

  <p>"No, those yawns were genuine, one after another."</p>

  <p>"What did you say to her?"</p>

  <p>"My purpose in going up, as I told you before, was to find out if she had
  signed that will in Norbert's favor, and to make a last appeal to her not to
  sign it."</p>

  <p>"And what did she say?"</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't talk about it. Said she was too sleepy. However, I extracted
  a promise from her that she wouldn't sign until she had talked it over with
  me, and so I left her."</p>

  <p>"Had she been drinking?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know?"</p>

  <p>"Well, did you see any bottles or glasses around?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't notice any."</p>

  <p>"Did you offer her a drink?"</p>

  <p>MacKelcan stared. "How should I be offering her a drink?"</p>

  <p>Mike laughed. "You can't get away with that, Mack. A long time ago Mrs.
  Ware told me that one of the nicest things about you was that you always had
  a flask of good whisky on you, and that you and she had many a nip together.
  She hated ordering a servant to bring her a whisky, she said, they always
  looked at her so funny."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan's face was a study. "Well ... well..." he stalled, puffing to
  give himself confidence. He decided to laugh it off as between man and man.
  "Well, if she told it, it's all right with me. I didn't want to give the old
  girl away, you understand."</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I offered her a drink, but she wasn't having any
  then. Said it would stimulate her, and all she wanted was to sleep. So I left
  her, and immediately afterwards I went home, as you know."</p>

  <p>Mike made believe to consider this. He said: "It's very likely that
  Norbert had drunk with her and had doped her, and that he slipped upstairs
  afterwards and finished the job. But how in the world are we going to hang it
  on him?"</p>

  <p>"That's up to the police."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry that it looks so bad for you," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"Why me?"</p>

  <p>"Because, as far as the evidence shows, you were the last person in the
  world to see her alive."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan scowled and fidgeted. After a space he muttered: "I was not the
  last. There was another went to the boudoir after me."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake!" said Mike, genuinely surprised now. "Who?"</p>

  <p>"Cummings."</p>

  <p>"Can you prove it?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I can prove it...Listen! While I was talking to the old lady I
  had a feeling that there was somebody listening at the door. Not the
  dressing-room door, but the corridor door through which I had entered. You
  know how you get those feelings. Maybe I heard a little sound out there. When
  I went out, there was nobody in sight, of course. I closed the door so it
  could be heard, and hummed a little to myself, and I rattled the elevator
  door when I went down. There was nobody in the foyer at the moment and I ran
  softly back up the stairs until I could peep over the top step. I saw
  Cummings knock at the door of the boudoir and go in."</p>

  <p>Mike wondered if he were lying. Impossible to guess from his face, which
  always had a false expression, whatever he was saying. "How long did Cummings
  stay in there?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't tell you. I just established the fact that he went in, and
  then I beat it."</p>

  <p>"Why in the world didn't you tell this before?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I couldn't tell it without admitting that I was up there myself. I
  thought you and your friends the police would solve the mystery without my
  testimony."</p>

  <p>"But you're prepared to go on the stand and swear to it now?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, if I'm needed."</p>

  <p>"Had Cummings anything in his hands?"</p>

  <p>"Not so far as I could see."</p>

  <p>"Could you see his face?"</p>

  <p>"Not very good. He looked murderous to me, but I never did like the
  man."</p>

  <p>"What you have told me puts an entirely new aspect on the case," said Mike
  impressively.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan looked pleased.</p>

  <p>Mike wanted to get rid of him now. He glanced at his watch. "Man! how time
  flies! I've got to beat it to dress. This has been darned helpful, Mack. We
  must have further talks."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan had completely recovered his confidence. "Look," he said, "if I
  come back to this place alone or with a friend, would I be let in?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" said Mike, "you're a member in good standing now."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p class="first">ON Saturday night at dinner, Mike and Radigan discussed
  MacKelcan's latest story without coming to any conclusion about it.</p>

  <p>"Would the so-and-so swear another man's life away?" said Radigan.</p>

  <p>Mike laughed. "You're pretty soft-hearted for a hard-boiled cop. Sure, he
  would! When a man starts lying, how is he going to stop? What is a life to
  him? <i>If</i> he's lying."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't hang Cummings on his say-so."</p>

  <p>"Neither would I. But if he has given us a straight tip it's up to us to
  find corroboration."</p>

  <p>On Sunday there promised to be not much doing in the case. Mike had no
  desire to sit in at the long questioning of Cummings at Headquarters. It
  would be a brutal business, and what was worse, tedious. If they should get
  anything out of Cummings, he would learn about it soon enough. As for Alfred,
  he had had a kind of collapse after reaching the hospital and could not be
  questioned at all.</p>

  <p>It was a fine day and smart society had flown to Lenox or Pittsfield or
  Old Westbury, or even farther afield. Mike decided to follow. He had an
  invitation from Amy Fentress. Evidently her rage against him had cooled off,
  or else she was finding that it was wasted. As with all her lot, Amy's
  emotions were as unstable as water. He wrote his column for Monday's paper
  and motored up to Amy's place at Mount Kisco for lunch. After all, Amy had
  been present at Mrs. Ware's on Tuesday night and her eyes were as keen as a
  lynx's, however she might make believe that she saw nothing. In the light of
  what he had learned during the past three days, she might give him an
  additional clue.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at the Fentress' vast place on top of a hill, the guests
  were being too, too informal. Clad in slacks or shorts, the women with
  halters knotted around their necks, they were sitting or lying on the sand in
  a lofty, glass-roofed conservatory, playing that it was the tropics. The
  fronds of tall palms drooped over their heads and branches of citrus trees,
  with golden or yellow fruit. Orchids in bloom hung from the forks of the
  trees. The sand was pleasantly warmed by pipes running underneath. There was
  a gaudy bandanna spread on it, and the whole party, grouped around, was
  shooting craps to the accompaniment of raucous cries picked up in Harlem.
  Greenbacks fluttered through the air like autumn leaves. Each player had a
  highball within reach.</p>

  <p>The newcomer received a noisy welcome. "Hi, Mike! When did they let you
  out?... Shh! the dicks go with him wherever he goes! They're waiting
  outside...Cheese it! Hide the money!... Take off your clothes and come on in,
  Mike."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, I didn't bring my trunks."</p>

  <p>"That's all right. Your scanties will do!"</p>

  <p>Amy Fentress' pale face flushed briefly. She scrambled to her feet, an
  alluring figure in her thick-soled red sandals, white doeskin slacks and
  scarlet halter. She was really crazy about Mike, but he was not deceived by
  it. It was not for his bright eyes, but because he stood out against her. She
  slipped her arm through his, and led him down a green alley to a bench out of
  sight of the crap-shooters.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect you," she murmured. "You didn't answer my note."</p>

  <p>"Didn't think I could come," said Mike. "Then found I couldn't keep away.
  You're adorable."</p>

  <p>"Adorable my foot! Be human!... Where's your bag?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't bring any. Must go back after lunch."</p>

  <p>When they had finished quarreling about it, Mike said: "I suppose you're
  horribly disappointed because they have dropped the case against me."</p>

  <p>"Horribly! If I could once be loved by a murderer, I'd die happy!"</p>

  <p>"Who's inhuman now? How can a man act human with a woman who poses as an
  ogress?"</p>

  <p>"I know I'm decadent," she said with affected sadness. "How can I help it?
  I have experienced everything..."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: Everything except bearing a child.</p>

  <p>"Consequently I'm bored to tears!"</p>

  <p>On the bench she settled herself within his arm, and let her head fall
  back against his shoulder. Mike didn't get even a faraway thrill out of it.
  However, he played up to her dutifully until she was in, for her, a
  thoroughly good humor. Finally he said casually:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you've been following the Ware case in the papers?"</p>

  <p>"Following it! I devour the newspapers, column by column, searching for
  your name."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't lose heart. They're likely to revive the case against me at
  any time...They arrested the butler yesterday."</p>

  <p>"So I saw. Do they really think he did it?"</p>

  <p>"Too soon to say yet."</p>

  <p>Amy sat up, bright-eyed. Any mention of murder excited her. "Oh, it would
  be lovely if it was he!"</p>

  <p>"Lovely?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, a kind of poetic justice, because he looks the part."</p>

  <p>"You took notice of him, then, at the party."</p>

  <p>"I should think I did. He made an impossible evening tolerable for me. I
  have never received such an impression of pure wickedness. And outwardly so
  quiet, so respectful; fire burning inside. Fancy, finding that in a butler!
  Most butlers look like eunuchs. But that one is a man! Did you ever notice
  his hands? Not much like a butler's hands; a plowman's&mdash;or a
  strangler's! They made me shiver deliciously."</p>

  <p>"Did you have any talk with him?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly did. I spoke to him each time I saw him. He scorned me. His
  eyes burned with scorn of me, and that made it all the more exciting. I asked
  him if he was married, and he said: 'Pardon me, that can't be of any interest
  to you, Madam.' And he wouldn't tell me! Later I saw him go into the dining
  room and I sauntered in there. There wasn't anybody else in the room. He was
  filling a small flask from a bottle of whisky..."</p>

  <p>"Hey?" said Mike, sharply interested.</p>

  <p>"I said to him," Amy went on, "'Who is that for, Cummings?' And he
  answered, staring at me as cool as you please, 'For myself, Madam.' And I
  said: 'What would your mistress say if she knew you were taking the whisky?
  I've a good mind to tell her,' I said, just to plague him. He slipped the
  flask in his pocket, saying, 'Just as you please, Madam. My mistress has
  confidence in me.' And went out through the pantry door. What a man! Do you
  think I could get him to work for me?"</p>

  <p>"Surely. If and when he gets out of jail...What you have told me may be
  important. Can you fix the moment at which it happened?"</p>

  <p>"It was near the end of the party."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice if MacKelcan was around at the time?"</p>

  <p>"That absurd man! I wasn't interested."</p>

  <p>"But think, think. Where was he when this happened?"</p>

  <p>Amy went through the motions of thinking. "I went through the rooms,
  looking for Bobo to take me home, and I suppose I saw everybody. I don't
  remember MacKelcan. No, I'm sure he wasn't there. It was about this time that
  Norbert and Maud came back from wherever they had been. But I did see
  MacKelcan again. When I went to the powder room for my wrap, MacKelcan was
  leaving. We left five minutes or so later."</p>

  <p>"If Cummings was brought to trial," Mike asked, "would you be willing to
  repeat what you have told me on the stand?"</p>

  <p>"To testify at a murder trial! Just give me the chance, that's all. If I
  were a witness, would I have a seat in the court every day, and hear and see
  it all?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so."</p>

  <p>"And I'd be photographed entering and leaving the court, holding my
  handbag up to hide my face, but not hiding too much! Darling! I would almost
  commit a murder myself for such a thrill!" She twisted her head so that she
  could look up into his face. "What a beautiful corpse you would make!"</p>

  <p>"Go as far as you like," said Mike.</p>

  <p>Putting her hand up, she caressed his throat. "I wonder where the jugular
  vein is?"</p>

  <p>"But don't talk about your evidence in advance," he warned her, "or it
  will be valueless."</p>

  <p>"Mum's the word, darling."</p>

  <p>On his return to town Sunday evening, Mike wrote Radigan a memo of what he
  had learned so that the Lieutenant would have it before him first thing in
  the morning.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p class="first">ON Monday morning Mike learned that Cummings, after having
  been questioned all day Sunday and through the night, still stuck to his
  original story. He answered every question as briefly as possible, and
  volunteered no additional information. Hard, self-controlled, defiant, he
  never gave an inch. He displayed more stamina than his questioners; they were
  brought up in relays and one after another he stood them off.</p>

  <p>At the hospital on Sunday Alfred had recovered sufficiently to be
  questioned. The police were more gentle with him. He, too, stuck to his
  story, Radigan said over the phone, and volunteered some additional
  statements very damaging to Cummings.</p>

  <p>This morning Alfred was able to leave the hospital and Radigan was
  bringing him down to Headquarters. It was the Lieutenant's idea to confront
  him with Cummings and see what came of it. The Clipper was due at the same
  hour from England, and Mike, not wishing to miss the scene at Headquarters,
  sent a man to meet the plane and to bring his guest to him.</p>

  <p>Radigan secured a sound-proof examination room. He seated himself behind a
  desk with Mike on his left. Cummings and Alfred were brought by uniformed
  officers, who waited outside. The two were placed on opposite sides of the
  room, facing each other. Cummings had now been under examination on Saturday,
  all day Sunday, and again at intervals during the preceding night, and Mike
  was startled by the change in his appearance. The butler's face was gray and
  his eyes sunken. But though he was at the point of exhaustion, he had not
  weakened; his glance was still charged with hatred and defiance.</p>

  <p>Alfred's coat was buttoned over his hurt arm, which was in a cast and
  sling. After one sidelong glance at Cummings, he never looked at him again.
  Seeing the state that the butler had been reduced to, Alfred was not so much
  afraid of him today. On the other hand, Cummings fed his hate by staring
  fixedly at the other man.</p>

  <p>"Alfred," said Radigan, "repeat what you told me yesterday about seeing
  Cummings in the pantry on Tuesday night."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lieutenant; certainly, sir." Alfred was trying to impress Radigan
  with the contrast between his willingness and Cummings' sullenness. "I was
  washing some glasses in the pantry and Mr. Cummings come in. He never said
  anything to me, but went on out the door to the corridor, and up the service
  stairs."</p>

  <p>"Is this true?" Radigan asked Cumnmings.</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"Where were you going upstairs?"</p>

  <p>"To my own room."</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"To go to bed."</p>

  <p>"Without locking up the liquor?"</p>

  <p>"I forgot it."</p>

  <p>"How could you forget it when you had just been filling a flask of liquor
  in the dining room?"</p>

  <p>Cummings sneered. "So you know that, too! The lady told you."</p>

  <p>"She did."</p>

  <p>"I hope she told you what she said," Cummings went on. "She was too
  free-spoken a lady for my taste. It made me mad because I could not speak my
  mind to her. Even a butler has the feelings of a man. That was what made me
  forget the liquor."</p>

  <p>Mike wondered at the quickness with which he turned the incident to his
  own advantage.</p>

  <p>"Not a very likely story," said Radigan. "You went to your room, you say;
  then what?"</p>

  <p>"I remembered about the liquor and came downstairs again."</p>

  <p>"It was a good fifteen minutes before he came down," put in Alfred.</p>

  <p>"Wait until I question you," said Radigan. He addressed Cummings
  sarcastically. "Why did you stay up there so long?"</p>

  <p>"No particular reason," said Cummings. "I started to undress. I put on my
  clothes again and came down."</p>

  <p>Radigan turned to Alfred. "Go on with your story."</p>

  <p>"When he came downstairs again, I was pouring some drinks in the dining
  room and Cummings said to me: (Alfred dropped the respectful 'Mister' at this
  point and Cummings' deep-set eyes burned.) Cummings said to me: 'The Madam
  says no more drinks tonight...'"</p>

  <p>"Can I speak?" put in Cummings.</p>

  <p>Radigan signed to him to go ahead.</p>

  <p>"That is wrong," said Cummings. "I said nothing about the Madam. I just
  said no more drinks tonight."</p>

  <p>"That's not so!" cried Alfred excitedly. "Cummings said 'the Madam says,'
  and by that I knew he had just been up there!"</p>

  <p>"He's lying now!" said Cummings, "I had not been up there."</p>

  <p>"Quiet, both of you!" ordered Radigan. "I'll find out who's lying."</p>

  <p>Mike leaned over and suggested a question to Radigan.</p>

  <p>Radigan said to Cummings: "You told us in the beginning that Mrs. Ware had
  told you to serve no more drinks after one-thirty. When did she tell you
  that?"</p>

  <p>"When I saw her for the last time. When she and Mrs. Prior started
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>"You were seen carrying her a drink after Mrs. Prior left."</p>

  <p>"That's true," said Cummings. "I had forgotten it. It was then that she
  said to me: 'Get rid of these people as soon as you can, Cummings. Serve no
  more drinks after one-thirty...'"</p>

  <p>"He's still lying!" cried Alfred.</p>

  <p>"Prove it!" snarled Cummings.</p>

  <p>"I can and I will prove it!... When Cummings come back to the dining room
  after carrying a drink to the Madam about one o'clock the whisky was running
  low&mdash;all the guests was drinking scotches and sodas, and I asked him to
  get out more, and he says: 'My Lord! what a bunch of guzzlers!' And I says:
  'How long will they stay?' And he says: 'Damned if I know!' and got out four
  fresh bottles of Scotch. Well, if the Madam had just told him to stop at
  one-thirty, he would have mentioned it then, wouldn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Radigan. "... And you are the liar!" he flung at
  Cummings.</p>

  <p>Cummings snarled: "Everything that rat says I said is twisted a little to
  incriminate me."</p>

  <p>"Well, what <i>did</i> you say? I'm waiting to hear it."</p>

  <p>"Aah! what's the use? I'll speak when I get a lawyer and a fair
  trial."</p>

  <p>Mike saw a look of desperation come into the man's eyes as he perceived
  the net closing around him. But he still fought back.</p>

  <p>"You went to Mrs. Ware's room a second time!" cried Radigan, shooting a
  forefinger at him.</p>

  <p>"I did not!"</p>

  <p>"You're lying!"</p>

  <p>Cummings glared at his tormentor like a trapped animal.</p>

  <p>Radigan went back a little. "That flask which you said you filled with
  whisky and carried to your room. What became of it? It was not found in your
  room next day."</p>

  <p>"I had no occasion to use any of the whisky," said Cummings coolly. "I
  carried it back to the liquor closet next morning and it's there still, and
  still full."</p>

  <p>"That won't help you any," said Radigan. "You could always fill it
  again."</p>

  <p>At this point an officer knocked and entered to tell Radigan that Mr.
  MacKelcan was outside and would like to know if he was wanted. Radigan had
  staged this.</p>

  <p>"He comes just at the right time," said the Lieutenant. "Ask him to step
  in a minute."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan breezed in with his lapels flying. "Good morning! Good morning,
  everybody ... Lieutenant ... Mike ... Cummings, I'm sorry to see you in such
  a situation...How's the arm, Alfred?"</p>

  <p>"Doing nicely, thank you, Mr. MacKelcan. Have my chair, sir."</p>

  <p>"Mr. MacKelcan," said Radigan formally, "will you please repeat what you
  told my friend, Mr. Speedon, on Saturday evening?"</p>

  <p>MacKelcan shook his head lugubriously. "I am sorry to have to say this;
  very, very sorry! On Tuesday night of last week, at or about one-thirty-five
  a.m., I saw Cummings knock at the door of Mrs. Ware's boudoir and go in."</p>

  <p>Cummings sprang up as if electrified. "There's another liar!" he shouted.
  "Where does he say <i>he</i> was when he saw me?"</p>

  <p>"On the stairs," said MacKelcan. "I was standing part way down, looking
  over the top step."</p>

  <p>"He lies! He lies!" cried Cummings, beside himself with rage. "He went
  down in the elevator!"</p>

  <p>Instantly he saw that he had betrayed himself. He dropped back in the
  chair and covered his face. Everybody else in the room guffawed with
  laughter&mdash;except Mike. It gave him no pleasure to see a man baited in
  this fashion, however guilty. At the sound of the cruel laughter, Cummings
  raised his head again and glared at his tormentors.</p>

  <p>Radigan said: "Much obliged, Mr. MacKelcan. I shall have to ask you to
  retire now. When this man is put on trial you will be a witness against him,
  and it would not be right for you to hear what he says."</p>

  <p>"Surely, surely, Lieutenant, I quite understand. I will wait in the outer
  office in case I should be needed again." He retired.</p>

  <p>"Well, Cummings," said Radigan jocosely, "I take it you won't deny any
  longer that you went to Mrs. Ware's room a second time."</p>

  <p>Cummings shook his head morosely.</p>

  <p>"What did you want to lie about it for?"</p>

  <p>"It was natural for me to lie. I wasn't going to put myself in the
  position of being the last to see her alive. You're all against me!"</p>

  <p>"You'd better come all the way clean now," said Radigan threateningly.
  "It'll be easier for you in the end."</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to pin on me?" Cummings parried. "Robbery or
  murder?"</p>

  <p>"Both! The murder was for the purpose of robbery!"</p>

  <p>"That's foolish," said Cummings contemptuously. "I've been working for
  Mrs. Ware six months. I had fifty better opportunities to rob her. Everybody
  in the house knew how careless she was. If Kinsey wasn't there to undress
  her, she would throw her jewels down on the dressing table or any place until
  morning."</p>

  <p>"So you say."</p>

  <p>Cummings' eyes narrowed as he concentrated on his problem. "Wait a
  minute!... I can <i>prove</i> that it wasn't me who stole her jewels."</p>

  <p>"Let's hear it," said Radigan with a grin of disbelief.</p>

  <p>Cummings said: "The thief telephoned to the insurance detective that he
  had the jewels. Well, that might have been me. The detective told him to mail
  the jewels. He had to go out to do that. And he had to go out a second time
  to pick up the reward at the post office. Well, up until Saturday, I had not
  been out of the apartment but once, and that was only because I had been sent
  for to come down here!"</p>

  <p>Radigan was momentarily shaken by this answer. "Well, I reckon you have
  friends on the outside to help you."</p>

  <p>"You will have a hard time finding them, Lieutenant. I have no
  friends...On the other hand, I don't suppose you're interested, but Alfred
  here, once the servants were cleared by the police, was out every day and
  sometimes more than once on errands for the household."</p>

  <p>Alfred burst out: "Now he's trying to pass it back to me!"</p>

  <p>"Quiet!" said Radigan. To Cummings he went on: "The robbery is only
  incidental. Murder is my job...You were the last person to see her
  alive."</p>

  <p>Cummings was still fighting. "You don't know that. Norbert Besson was
  still in the house when I came downstairs."</p>

  <p>"Never mind him now. What took place during your last talk with Mrs.
  Ware?"</p>

  <p>Cummings said: "I asked her if she would like a drink. That was why I had
  filled the flask. She had told me earlier that she didn't like the servants
  to see me bringing her whisky. She refused the drink, saying that she had had
  one."</p>

  <p>Radigan asked: "Did she seem sleepy, dopey, sort of?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. She was her usual self."</p>

  <p>Mike broke in. "Think what you're saying, man! There's no call for you to
  put the rope around your own neck..." He caught Radigan scowling at him and
  pulled up. "Sorry, Rad," he said in an undertone. "I forgot myself."</p>

  <p>"I am telling the truth," said Cummings. "She was not sleepy or dopey, as
  you say. But she seemed depressed. I asked her if she wouldn't go to bed, and
  she said she would as soon as she had seen somebody."</p>

  <p>"Did she tell you who she wanted to see?"</p>

  <p>"She did not. I assumed that it was Norbert Besson."</p>

  <p>Mike thought: A point for Cummings.</p>

  <p>"You were on pretty friendly terms with your mistress, according to
  you."</p>

  <p>"When the other servants were not around, Mrs. Ware treated me as a
  friend. There is plenty of evidence as to that. She said she trusted me."</p>

  <p>"And this is how you repaid her trust!"</p>

  <p>"You haven't proved yet that I betrayed her."</p>

  <p>"We've come pretty close to it, man. It's been established that Mrs. Ware
  was doped with a drug administered in whisky. You brought her whisky twice.
  You were the last to see her..."</p>

  <p>Cummings interrupted him. "You can't hang a man without showing that he
  had a motive. What reason had I for killing Mrs. Ware?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not here to answer questions but to ask them," said Radigan dryly.
  "What else did you and Mrs. Ware talk about?"</p>

  <p>"I don't recollect anything else," said Cummings. "She told me to get the
  people out as soon as I could. I returned downstairs and locked up the
  liquor, and gave Alfred his instructions."</p>

  <p>"What instructions?"</p>

  <p>"I told him not to pick up any more empty glasses. If any guest asked him
  for a drink he was to put it off on me. He was to say that he was sorry, but
  the butler had retired, taking the keys."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"I went to my room to keep out of their way. They knew I had the keys. It
  was the easiest way to get rid of them."</p>

  <p>"And went to bed, I suppose," said Radigan sarcastically. "You are so fond
  of your bed."</p>

  <p>"I went to bed," said Cummings stolidly.</p>

  <p>"Did you get any sleep that night?"</p>

  <p>"I slept. I had no reason to expect any trouble."</p>

  <p>Radigan suddenly cut loose. "You left the old lady lying dead in her
  boudoir," he shouted, "and you went to bed and slept!"</p>

  <p>Cummings hardened. "I did not kill her. I had no reason to."</p>

  <p>"You killed her!"</p>

  <p>"You will never get me to admit that," said Cummings stubbornly. "Not you
  and all your mates together! Not though you kill me!"</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door and the same officer entered. This time he
  had a message for Mike. "It's from the man who is waiting for you outside.
  Another man brought him and left him a while ago. He wants to know if it's
  all right for him to go out and get a bite to eat."</p>

  <p>Mike consulted, low-voiced, with Radigan. "It's the witness from England.
  I'll send him up to my flat to wait until we're ready for him. Takaku will
  feed him."</p>

  <p>"Let's have a look at him first," said Radigan. "Bring the man in," he
  added to the uniformed officer.</p>

  <p>The latter presently returned, bringing a burly north-countryman, with the
  powerful shoulders and pale, thin jaws of a miner. He was wearing a loud, new
  suit, and was somewhat overcome by the strangeness of his surroundings. A
  slow-thinking man but no fool, judging from his face, and as honest as the
  day. All glanced at the newcomer, and Cummings was overlooked for the
  moment.</p>

  <p>Mike went to meet him. "How are you, Maxwell? I'm Michael Speedon."</p>

  <p>"Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Speedon."</p>

  <p>"Hope you had a good trip."</p>

  <p>"Amazing! Amazing!" muttered the confused newcomer. "Yesterday I was in
  London; today I am in New York! I don't rightly know where I am!"</p>

  <p>Mike introduced him to Radigan. "This is Mr. Maxwell, who has come over to
  tell us what he knows about James Fawcett. Shake hands with Lieutenant
  Radigan, Maxwell."</p>

  <p>"The honor is mine, Left'nant," said Maxwell, offering an enormous
  paw.</p>

  <p>"We certainly are obliged to you for coming so far, Mr. Maxwell. We've got
  a hard nut to crack here. A little later we must talk things over."</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, take a taxi up to my place," said Mike. "I'll give you a note
  to my man."</p>

  <p>During this exchange, Alfred with an ugly smile was saying: "Sst! Sst!"
  and calling their attention to Cummings. The three looked at the butler
  simultaneously. Cummings' face had turned greenish, and his deep-sunk eyes
  were wild with terror.</p>

  <p>"Damn me! here's Jim Fawcett right here!" cried Maxwell. "I didn't see you
  when I come in, Jim! Why didn't you hail me?" His face was lighted up with
  pleasure, and he thrust out his big hand.</p>

  <p>"You're making a mistake," said Cummings huskily. "My name is
  Cummings."</p>

  <p>Maxwell, still holding out his hand, stared at him in astonishment. Then
  his face flushed with anger. "Damn me! Do you think I don't know you? After
  twenty years! Would you make me out a liar before these gentlemen?" He turned
  to Radigan. "Lieutenant, I could bring fifty men, a hundred men from
  Newcastle who know Jim Fawcett."</p>

  <p>"It isn't necessary," said Radigan with a hard smile. "We accept your
  identification."</p>

  <p>Maxwell, all in a maze, turned back to Cummings. "What's the matter, Jim?
  What for do you want to deny me?"</p>

  <p>Cummings muttered: "You have thrown me to the wolves, Rafe."</p>

  <p>Maxwell stared at him in complete confusion.</p>

  <p>Mike, who was almost as stunned by the disclosure, but was not showing it,
  said: "Come on, Maxwell. I'll explain as we go." He led the dazed Maxwell
  out.</p>

  <p>Radigan said: "Do you still deny that you had no motive for killing Mrs.
  Ware, Fawcett? When she was on the point of signing a will that would have
  cut you out of the Ware millions?"</p>

  <p>Cummings was mute.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">MIKE returned and the examination proceeded. Alfred was
  bursting with confidence. The dejected Cummings, or Fawcett, no longer looked
  at him.</p>

  <p>"Come clean!" shouted Radigan, pounding the desk.</p>

  <p>"I did not kill Mrs. Ware," said Fawcett dully. "She was my mother's
  sister."</p>

  <p>Radigan laughed. "A fat lot of difference that made to you!... Did she
  know who you were?"</p>

  <p>"No. I was going to tell her when I had gained her confidence. I kept
  putting it off."</p>

  <p>"How did you get to be a butler, anyhow? A miner like you."</p>

  <p>Fawcett's eyes flashed briefly. "I got to be a butler because I made up my
  mind to it. I wouldn't let nothing stop me. I knew I was the legal heir, and
  I came to New York to watch over my interests. As my aunt had refused to
  receive me, the only way I could get near her was to enter her service. I
  spent months watching and learning and preparing myself for it. I made
  friends with other butlers and pumped them about their jobs. One of them told
  me about a butler's manual which I studied until I knew it by heart. This
  man's name was Cummings. I copied his recommendations, and that's why I took
  the name of Cummings."</p>

  <p>"We know all about him," said Radigan.</p>

  <p>"I made out that I was an Australian to account for my accent, and I
  forged Australian recommendations. Finally, last spring, I got the job in
  Mrs. Ware's house that I was after. Then I set out to make myself
  indispensable to her; I ran the house efficiently; I kept the servants in
  order and stopped their stealing; also the tradesmen."</p>

  <p>"All for love of your aunt?"</p>

  <p>"No. I figured that what I saved would come to me some day. And for the
  same reason I wanted to protect her from sharpers and swindlers. I soon
  learned in the servants' hall about her nephew who was a miner in England,
  and that she had made her will in his favor and ..."</p>

  <p>"And your prime object was to make sure that she never changed that will,
  eh?" put in Radigan. "And when you found that she was about to sign a new
  will, you stopped her!"</p>

  <p>"I did not kill her. I did not know she had made a new will."</p>

  <p>Alfred cried out: "That's a lie! I can tell you something about that,
  Lieutenant."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's hear it."</p>

  <p>Alfred began confidently: "Last Tuesday morning, Mrs. Ware sent Cummings
  up to her house in Tarrytown on some made-up business that kept him there the
  whole day. She was expecting a lawyer to call, and she wanted to get Cummings
  out of the way..."</p>

  <p>Mike interrupted him. "One moment!... Can I put a question?" he asked
  Radigan.</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"How could you know what was in Mrs. Ware's mind?"</p>

  <p>"It was Cummings himself let it out he was so mad about it."</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"In the morning the lawyer came, and in the afternoon the Madam drove
  downtown to his office. Martin, the chauffeur, told me that. When Cummings
  got back he was wild when he heard it, and asked me a hundred questions about
  the lawyer. And the next morning he was at me again about it."</p>

  <p>Cummings spoke up in his own defense. "I knew she had sent for a lawyer
  and naturally I was interested. But I didn't know what for. And what this
  liar didn't tell you was that he couldn't answer my questions. He couldn't
  even tell me the lawyer's name. Moreover, if I had already killed Mrs. Ware,
  why should I go back to Alfred for information after it was over?"</p>

  <p>Mike thought: Point two for Cummings-Fawcett.</p>

  <p>Radigan addressed Alfred. "Is that so?"</p>

  <p>Alfred was losing some of his confidence. "Well, I could almost remember
  his name," he said lamely.</p>

  <p>Radigan said to Fawcett grimly: "Well, since a lawyer <i>had</i> called,
  you made up your mind you had better be on the safe side and not wait any
  longer, eh?"</p>

  <p>Some of Fawcett's old fire came back. "If you've made up your mind not to
  believe anything I say, why do you keep on questioning me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I seem to be getting at the truth in spite of you," retorted
  Radigan.</p>

  <p>Fawcett stood up suddenly. "Turn your attention to him for a while!" he
  said with a passionate gesture in Alfred's direction. "It's nonsensical to
  accuse me of the robbery now. Once Mrs. Ware was dead, the jewels were mine!
  Why should I steal my own?"</p>

  <p>Radigan exchanged a glance with Mike. The latter's expression said: We
  can't go behind that, Rad.</p>

  <p>Fawcett, seeing that he was having some effect, went on: "I knew from the
  first that Alfred was the thief and I tortured him to make him tell where he
  hid them. The jewels were mine! It made me mad when he was paid for the
  return of a part of them, and I swore to myself that <i>I</i> would not pay
  for the return of what was mine! There sits the thief! Look at him! Look at
  him!"</p>

  <p>Radigan did look at Alfred, and with a new expression. The young man
  cringed under it, and seemed to shrink in his chair. "By God, he's right!"
  Radigan cried, striking his desk. "As far as the robbery is concerned." He
  jumped up and strode to Alfred's chair. "You are the thief!" he shouted with
  accusing forefinger.</p>

  <p>Alfred writhed in his chair, in intolerable terror. "No! No! No!" he
  squalled. "As God is my judge, it wasn't me, Lieutenant. He's a liar. You
  know he's a liar! So help me God, it wasn't me!"</p>

  <p>"You lie!" shouted Radigan. "Confess!"</p>

  <p>Radigan, standing over the young man with blazing eyes, terrible voice and
  commanding forefinger, was like the very embodiment of the outraged Law and
  the weak creature soon crumpled. Presently it came tumbling out:</p>

  <p>"I did it! I did it! Oh, God, I don't know what made me do it! Oh, God,
  what will my mother say when she hears of this! Oh, I wish I was dead, I
  do!"</p>

  <p>Radigan strutted back to his desk, well-pleased.</p>

  <p>Mike, full of curiosity, said: "Tell us how you did it, Alfred."</p>

  <p>The writhing creature snarled: "I don't have to answer <i>your</i>
  questions."</p>

  <p>"You can tell me!" shouted Radigan, thumping his desk.</p>

  <p>Fawcett sat through this with a face like a mask, with two burning eyes
  showing through it.</p>

  <p>"It was a sudden impulse," whined Alfred. "I'm not a bad fellow. She was
  so careless with her things! 'Tain't right an old woman should have so much.
  I thought about it all the time. I knew she had told Kinsey to go to bed that
  night, and they said she always left her jewels lying on the dressing table
  when Kinsey wasn't there. And... and I knew she took dope to make her sleep.
  She was hard to rouse. So I waited in my room for a long time. More than an
  hour, I guess. And then I went down the stairs&mdash;the front stairs because
  the service stairs creak and there were too many sleeping near. I went in
  through the boudoir because that was further from the Madam's bedroom, and I
  could get into the dressing room from there; the door was usually open.
  And... and..." He covered his face with his hands. "I can't go on. It's too
  awful."</p>

  <p>"Tell the whole story," commanded Radigan, "or you'll be charged with
  murder, too!"</p>

  <p>"No! No!" squalled Alfred. "She was dead when I got there! I'll tell! I'll
  tell!..."</p>

  <p>Radigan drew a sheet of paper towards him and wrote as Alfred told his
  story.</p>

  <p>The young man was sweating and breathing unevenly. "When I went into the
  dark boudoir I ... I ... Oh, God! I stumbled over her. She was lying on the
  floor. I let a little squawk out of me, but nobody come. Nobody sleeps near
  there."</p>

  <p>"What time was this?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>"About three-thirty, Lieutenant, as near as I can figure."</p>

  <p>"Was the body cold?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes...I knew she was dead as soon as I touched her. I didn't know if
  she was murdered or just died. I had a flashlight, just a little one. Wasn't
  any blood...I wanted to run back to my room, but the jewels sparkled so in
  the light... they sparkled so... I took them off her. I thought... if she was
  murdered... they would think the murderer took them...</p>

  <p>"I didn't rightly know what I was doing...I had a notion to put her in her
  bed... and I started to unhook her dress. But I realized it was a fool
  notion... because I couldn't make her look like she looked when they put her
  to bed. And I couldn't hook her up again... my hands trembled so...</p>

  <p>"Then I wanted to hide her...I knew if I ran out of the house then, they'd
  know it was me and I'd surely be caught...And maybe charged with murder, too.
  But if I could hide her so she wouldn't be found for a while, I could show
  myself in the morning...And get out and hide the jewels somewhere, and come
  back afterwards. And they'd never know it was me took them...I saw the old
  carved cupboard... just the right size...And I put her in there... and took
  the key.</p>

  <p>"But in the morning... before she was found, I mean, Cummings wouldn't let
  me go out... I was in a fix, then... I near died, I was so scared...Just by
  chance when I was passing the bedroom next to Cummings', I saw the old brass
  bed and that gave me an idea. It was so heavy everybody thought it was solid
  brass...But once when I was helping to move it, I noticed one of the knobs
  was loose...So I took it off and dropped the jewels down the hole and the key
  after them...And screwed the knob back tight..."</p>

  <p>"Where's the reward you collected?"</p>

  <p>"I shoved the bills down the other post at the foot of the bed."</p>

  <p>"Anything else to say?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>Alfred miserably shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Then sign this. You go to the Tombs."</p>

  <p>Fawcett spoke for the first time. "What about me?"</p>

  <p>"You are held on a charge of murder," said Radigan.</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>Alfred was removed from the examination room. All this time Sanford
  MacKelcan had been waiting in the outer office in case he should be wanted,
  and Mike suggested that he be brought in again. He was sent for.</p>

  <p>When the attorney pranced in, flinging out his legs and twisting his long
  neck like a crane, Radigan said with dry humor:</p>

  <p>"Well, there's your rich client, Mr. MacKelcan. That's Jim Fawcett of
  Newcastle, England."</p>

  <p>MacKelcan started back, open-mouthed, quite honest for once. "Oh, my God,
  what are you saying, Lieutenant? It can't be true! No! No! No! You're
  joking!"</p>

  <p>"It's true, all right. Ask him yourself."</p>

  <p>Fawcett sneered. "I'm not just the kind of client you were expecting, eh,
  MacKelcan? You looked for a poor boob of a miner that you could twist around
  your finger!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is terrible!" moaned MacKelcan. "You shouldn't talk to me that
  way, Mr. Fawcett! After all, I am your attorney."</p>

  <p>Fawcett, ex-Cummings, could at least have the satisfaction of being honest
  now. He no longer had to crook the neck and bend the knee. "Damn your eyes!"
  he cried furiously. "I don't want you! I'd as lief have a crocodile for my
  attorney!"</p>

  <p>MacKelcan glanced at the grinning Radigan and Mike. "Don't talk like that,
  Mr. Fawcett," he said beseechingly. "Before others, too. We're co-executors
  under the will. We can't escape our responsibilities. We're bound
  together."</p>

  <p>"You'd better refuse to serve, then," growled Fawcett. "I've been watching
  you for six months, MacKelcan. I know you through and through! And I'm damned
  if you'll ever diddle me out of a penny!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is a terrible situation!" moaned MacKelcan.</p>

  <p>"Of course, if Fawcett is convicted of murdering his aunt," said Radigan
  dryly, "he won't inherit. That's the law."</p>

  <p>"In that case, what will become of the Ware fortune?" said MacKelcan.
  "There is no other known heir."</p>

  <p>"I have children," said Fawcett.</p>

  <p>"I doubt if the children would be allowed to inherit," said Radigan. "What
  say, Mack?"</p>

  <p>MacKelcan clapped his hands to his head. "Give me time! Give me time! This
  awful shock...But in any case, I am indispensable to you, Mr. Fawcett. I know
  the law of this country..."</p>

  <p>"The hell with you!" said Fawcett. "You can't cozen me. I'll have another
  lawyer, and you can deal with me through him!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is terrible!" moaned MacKelcan.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">THE search of the sewer catch basins in the vicinity of the
  Ware apartment, ordered by the police, had yielded a curious variety of
  objects but no hypodermic syringe. All the objects that could not be
  accounted for had been saved. At the time of Norbert Besson's detention, a
  further search had been ordered of the basins adjacent to the Hotel Bathurst,
  and on Monday, this day, the findings came in.</p>

  <p>The syringe was found in a basin not a hundred feet from the hotel door.
  It had been crushed flat and bent over; the plunger broken off; but the
  plunger was found in the same deposit of mud, and in the hands of the police
  department experts the syringe was so skillfully reconstructed that the firm
  of Emory and Almond could identify it as one of the two they had mailed, as
  they thought, to Dr. Patton.</p>

  <p>Mike and Radigan met at Headquarters to examine the object. Radigan
  said:</p>

  <p>"I can't believe Norbert would be such a fool as to drop this in a place
  that would lead us directly to his door. It's a plant."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," agreed Mike.</p>

  <p>"It was Cummings-Fawcett who planted it there. After he had done his job,
  he had to get rid of the syringe quick. He left the apartment&mdash;he had
  keys, of course, to the service door and the service entrance
  downstairs&mdash;and after he had dropped his little tool, he came in the
  same way. How simple!"</p>

  <p>Mike said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" said Radigan irritably. "Do you still refuse to believe that it
  was Fawcett did it?"</p>

  <p>"I am not convinced."</p>

  <p>"You and your instincts!"</p>

  <p>"Well, once or twice my instincts have proved to be right."</p>

  <p>Radigan ignored it. "After the way he has been lying from the start, do
  you actually believe he was telling the truth this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I neither believe nor disbelieve. Fawcett is too deep a man for me to
  fathom. He doesn't conform to any of the usual types. I can't figure what's
  passing through the mind of a man like that. <i>But!...</i>"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yeah! There's always a 'but' with you!"</p>

  <p>"One or two things he said have raised a doubt in my mind."</p>

  <p>"What, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"When he said: 'She was my mother's sister.' He wasn't laboring to
  convince us that he loved the old girl. He just mentioned it casually, and
  let it go at that."</p>

  <p>"What else?"</p>

  <p>"When he broke and said to Maxwell: 'You have thrown me to the wolves,
  Rafe!' I swear that doesn't sound to me like the cry of a guilty man."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you're always hearing funny sounds! As for me, I'm satisfied it was
  Fawcett. He has everything the murderer must have had. By his own words, we
  know that he has been plotting and scheming for months past. In all my
  experience, I never met with such a patient schemer. We know, too, that he's
  a forger. He is just the one to have cooked up that fake order for the
  syringes."</p>

  <p>"Okay," said Mike. "However, since this syringe does lead to Norbert's
  door, I suppose we'll have to look down that alley, too."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure."</p>

  <p>"Not much use questioning Fawcett further. He's told us all he
  knows&mdash;or all he wants us to know."</p>

  <p>"Sure. I want to ask Alfred a few questions. Will you come down to the
  Tombs with me?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>While they were waiting in the prison for Alfred to be brought to them,
  Mike said: "Bear in mind, Rad, that Alfred wants to pay off Fawcett for his
  broken arm. He won't help you to shift suspicion away from the
  Englishman."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't born yesterday," said Radigan.</p>

  <p>The red-lidded, disheveled young second man was led into the waiting room.
  There was a crazy hope in his eyes, but it faded when he saw Radigan's
  expression.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Radigan, "and answer my questions."</p>

  <p>Alfred fawned on him. "Certainly Lieutenant. Anything at all, sir. I only
  want to help...Lieutenant, will the District-Attorney be easy on me if I
  testify freely against Cummings?"</p>

  <p>"That's up to the D-A...This morning we brought you up to the point where
  Cummings or Fawcett gave you his last orders and went upstairs for the second
  time."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Now I want you to tell me with the greatest particularity what happened
  after that. Take it slow, and tell me every little detail."</p>

  <p>"But, Lieutenant," objected Alfred, "by that time ..."</p>

  <p>"Be quiet!" rasped Radigan. "Do as I tell you. I'm not interested in your
  ideas about the case."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Lieutenant...After Cummings went upstairs (Alfred could not
  accustom himself to his boss' new name), I went back into the living room.
  People were leaving and I went into the foyer to open the door for them. It
  was Mr. MacKelcan and Mr. and Mrs. Bradstreet and ..."</p>

  <p>"Never mind them. I have a note of their names."</p>

  <p>"The next thing I remember Mrs. Fentress asked me for a drink, and I said
  what I had been told to say and she cursed me..."</p>

  <p>"Do ladies curse servants?"</p>

  <p>"Modern ladies, yes, sir. They don't mean nothing by it."</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Fentress said to the man she was with&mdash;she called him Bobo; I
  don't remember his right name&mdash;she said: 'Let's get out of this dump,'
  and I let them out. Others went, but I can't remember the exact order..."</p>

  <p>"Did Mr. Besson and Mrs. Laval leave?"</p>

  <p>"Not then, sir. About half the guests were still in the living room,
  talking loud. They kept asking me for drinks, and it was so embarrassing I
  went back to the dining room to keep out of the way. A couple of gentlemen
  followed me, but I showed them there was nothing to drink, and they went out
  again."</p>

  <p>"Was one of these men Norbert Besson?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"How long were you in the dining room?"</p>

  <p>"About ten minutes, I should say. Then there was a general movement to
  leave, and I went back to the foyer to let them out."</p>

  <p>"Where was Norbert Besson while you were in the dining room?"</p>

  <p>"In the living room, sir, with the other guests."</p>

  <p>"You can't see into the living room from the dining room?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. You have to go round by the foyer."</p>

  <p>"You can't see the elevator from the dining room?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. It's on the other side."</p>

  <p>"Then how do you know Norbert Besson didn't leave the living room while
  you were in the dining room?"</p>

  <p>"I would have heard the elevator door if he had opened it."</p>

  <p>"That's not so. I have tried that door and it opens and closes without a
  sound unless you try to make a noise."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Besson couldn't have gone upstairs, Lieutenant. There wasn't
  time."</p>

  <p>"Certainly there was time for him to have run up to say good night to Mrs.
  Ware and come down again."</p>

  <p>Alfred felt gingerly of his hurt arm. "It was Cummings did it," he said
  viciously.</p>

  <p>"You can leave that to me," said Radigan. "What time did Norbert Besson
  and Mrs. Laval leave the apartment?"</p>

  <p>"About two, Lieutenant, or a little before."</p>

  <p>"Were they the last to leave?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. But all were getting ready to go then. All except two of the
  gentlemen who were arguing in the music room. They wouldn't go until I
  brought in their coats and laid them over the backs of chairs."</p>

  <p>"What time was it when the last guest was out?"</p>

  <p>"It had struck two just a little before."</p>

  <p>"What did you do then?"</p>

  <p>"I carried all the glasses and the ash trays into the pantry to be washed
  in the morning. I put out the lights and went to my room."</p>

  <p>Mike interrupted: "Lieutenant, what kind of locks are there on Mrs. Ware's
  front door and on the service door? I never happened to notice."</p>

  <p>"Burglar-proof bar locks on both doors. They can't be opened by any master
  key ever made, and they can't be jimmied open."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. Go ahead."</p>

  <p>Radigan addressed Alfred. "You have to pass the butler's room to reach
  your own?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Was his light still burning? I suppose when you turned out the last light
  you looked."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lieutenant. There was no light burning...But, of course, while he
  was sitting there waiting for me to go to bed, he wouldn't leave no light
  burning."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all we want from you now. Take him away, guard."</p>

  <p>Alfred's face worked in a mean, pitiful fashion. "Lieutenant ...
  Lieutenant, don't be too hard on me! Speak a word for me to the
  District-Attorney, will you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Why the hell should I?" said Radigan, with a hard stare.</p>

  <p>Alfred was led away.</p>

  <p>Radigan and Mike walked up Center Street to Police Headquarters. The
  former grumbled:</p>

  <p>"We didn't get much out of him. Supposing Cummings-Fawcett was telling the
  truth this morning, and the old lady was all right when he left her, don't
  seem likely she would be in such a state just a few minutes afterwards, that
  Norbert could jab her with the needle without her hollering."</p>

  <p>"Not likely," agreed Mike.</p>

  <p>After they had walked for a block in silence, Radigan asked: "Got any new
  ideas, Mike?"</p>

  <p>"My mind is running on locks and keys," said Mike. "Amongst the stuff that
  was recovered from the catch basins near Mrs. Ware's place, weren't there
  some keys?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Two keys tied with a bit of white string."</p>

  <p>"Funny anybody should throw keys down a sewer opening."</p>

  <p>"You find everything in the sewers."</p>

  <p>"Look, have you got Fawcett's ring with all his keys at Headquarters?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"Let me have it for a few minutes, along with the two keys that were
  found. I want to dope something out."</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>Leaving Mike to study the keys, Radigan went away to see to some other
  details. In addition to the white string that bound the two keys together,
  each had a little loop of strong thread attached to it. When Radigan
  returned, Mike said:</p>

  <p>"The keys found in the catch basin are for the service door to Mrs. Ware's
  apartment, and the general service entrance to the building, in the
  basement."</p>

  <p>Radigan, staring, uttered a mighty expletive.</p>

  <p>Mike went on: "This opens up an entirely new vista."</p>

  <p>"Sure! Sure! Let me dope it out."</p>

  <p>"If it was Cummings who went out by the service entrance to lose the
  syringe, why should he carry an extra set of keys?"</p>

  <p>"Must have left his regular keys home," muttered Radigan.</p>

  <p>Mike smiled. "In that case, if he threw the extra set away, how would he
  get in?"</p>

  <p>Radigan clapped his forehead, "Sure, I'm loony."</p>

  <p>"Cummings was never without his own key ring. It was chained to a pants
  button. He slept with it under his pillow. He certainly had it with him. Why
  should he carry duplicates? Why should he throw keys away?"</p>

  <p>"He had several sets of back door keys."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Three. He issued them to the servants on their nights out and
  collected them in the mornings. He kept them in a locked drawer in his
  office, and showed them to the police when they searched the place."</p>

  <p>"Then he had four sets."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. Or fourteen. Or forty. What difference does it make? But why
  should he throw one away?"</p>

  <p>"I get you," said Radigan slowly. "It looks now as if Norbert had the
  extra set of keys, and came back after the party was over and did the
  job."</p>

  <p>"Something like that."</p>

  <p>"Where in hell would Norbert get the keys?"</p>

  <p>"That's for us to find out."</p>

  <p>"By God!" said Radigan, "the house detective of the Bathurst told me
  Norbert didn't get home until 4 a.m. last Wednesday. That takes on new
  meaning now."</p>

  <p>"Can I ask Fawcett a few questions about keys?" said Mike. "Let me talk to
  him alone, will you? You always put his back up and then he turns
  stubborn."</p>

  <p>"Sure, go on and talk to your English pal," said Radigan derisively.
  "Would you like tea served?"</p>

  <p>Mike clapped him on the back and ran downstairs. The butler was in a
  Headquarters cell.</p>

  <p>Mike got anything but a friendly reception. Fawcett sat in his cell like a
  stone man. He answered Mike's questions curtly, without any comment of his
  own. Mike was back in five minutes. He said:</p>

  <p>"Fawcett, in addition to his own keys, had three front door keys and three
  sets of back door keys that he issued as needed. All the keys were in his
  possession on the morning after the murder. No servant had been out the
  previous night. In addition to these keys, he said he had been told that Mrs.
  Ware kept a complete set in her safe."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember," put in Radigan, "There were some keys found in the
  safe."</p>

  <p>"Fawcett said he had never seen these keys, having had no occasion to ask
  for them, since none of his had ever been lost. He says he never had the
  combination of the safe. Nobody had it but Mrs. Ware. She couldn't remember
  it and had it written down on a piece of paper which was continually getting
  lost. He believes that Kinsey knows the combination, because she usually
  opened the safe while Mrs. Ware read off the numbers to her."</p>

  <p>Radigan said: "The keys are still there. Want to go up and check them
  over? The combination of the safe is here amongst the other exhibits."</p>

  <p>"Okay. I'll also take the occasion to ask old Kinsey a question or
  two."</p>

  <p>As Mike was putting on his coat, one of the Headquarters clerks entered
  and laid some papers caught together with a fastener on the desk in front of
  Radigan. The clerk gave Mike a hard look, inquisitive, derisive, sneering,
  and went out again. Mike thought, without greatly caring: What the hell is
  biting him?</p>

  <p>As Mike was making for the door, Radigan said: "Wait a minute."</p>

  <p>A change had come into his voice that caused Mike to turn very quickly.
  Radigan's face had become as hard as stone; his glance was both sore and
  furious.</p>

  <p>"What?..." began Mike.</p>

  <p>"Read that," said Radigan, shoving the papers toward him.</p>

  <p>The top sheet was a report from one of the Headquarters experts. It
  said:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">These two communications were written on the same
  typewriter. That can be seen even without the use of a magnifying glass. The
  machine is a Corona portable, number three, with three banks of keys and two
  shifts. This model was discontinued some time ago and there are not many
  still in use. The type shows many signs of wear and some of the most
  frequently used letters are out of alignment, the a and the e hitting a
  little above the line and the i below it.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Note the little piece broken from the top of the w, and
  note that the bottom of the o is worn almost smooth. Many other points of
  resemblance can be detected with a magnifying glass.</p>

  <p><br>
  Mike quickly turned the report over. Under it lay the memo he had written
  Radigan the night before, and under that was the order for two hypodermic
  syringes bearing Dr. Patton's signature.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake!" stammered Mike. "For God's sake!..."</p>

  <p>"Aah! cut the comedy!" snarled Radigan, "That sort of mugging ain't going
  to help you now!"</p>

  <p>"Rad, you don't think that I!..."</p>

  <p>Radigan rapped the papers. "This makes a lot of things clear to me. Now I
  understand why you were so anxious to defend your pal Cummings. So it was a
  Speedon-Cummings combination, eh? Cummings on the inside and you on the
  outside. Very pretty work!"</p>

  <p>Mike grew hot. "Don't be a fool!"</p>

  <p>Radigan jumped up with an oath. "A fool, am I?"</p>

  <p>"Like all cops, you're hipped on 'evidence.' For God's sake, use a little
  common sense for a change! For five days now, you and I have been working
  together on this case. We have investigated every lead together, and have
  discussed it for hours at a time. Would it be possible for me, for any man,
  to keep this up for five days and five nights without giving himself
  away?"</p>

  <p>"Save your arguments for the jury," said Radigan. He rapped the papers
  again. "This is incontrovertible evidence!"</p>

  <p>"Take these two keys. You never noticed them. If I had chucked them down
  the sewer, would I call the fact to your attention?"</p>

  <p>"Aah, you're smart!" sneered Radigan, "I don't know what your game is.
  You're too damn smart to live!"</p>

  <p>"If I had written that order for the syringes on my typewriter, would I
  sit down and write to you on it? Was that a smart thing to do?"</p>

  <p>"Everybody makes one mistake."</p>

  <p>"Aah, your talk doesn't make sense!" retorted Mike.</p>

  <p>"It don't make sense, eh? Well, how do you explain this report?"</p>

  <p>"I can't explain it off hand, but I will if you give me time."</p>

  <p>"Sure! Sure! You could explain the nose off your face if I gave you
  time!"</p>

  <p>"The hell with it!" said Mike. "Am I under arrest?"</p>

  <p>Radigan considered.</p>

  <p>"You would only make yourself ridiculous," said Mike.</p>

  <p>Radigan made up his mind. "You couldn't make a getaway. You're too well
  known. If I let you go, what would you do first?"</p>

  <p>"Try to find out what I could about these keys."</p>

  <p>"Bluffing to the end!" sneered Radigan. "All right. Go ahead."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

  <p class="first">MIKE left the building in a blind rage. In the entrance
  lobby, the sight of Mrs. Laval entering below recalled him to his
  surroundings. Coming to visit Norbert, he supposed. Norbert was to be
  arraigned this afternoon, and it was expected that he would be released on
  bail. Mike was struck by the change in the woman. It is all right to live
  your own life defiantly&mdash;as long as it doesn't get in the newspapers.
  Mrs. Laval was a social outcast now; her husband had gone to live at his
  club, and it was said that he would divorce her. She still carried her head
  high&mdash;the hangers-on in the lobby knew who she was; but all the beauty
  doctors in town could not hide the ravages that the last two days had left in
  her face.</p>

  <p>They met on the stairs. Mrs. Laval stared at Mike, her eyes glittering
  with a venomous hate. Mike, refusing to be bluffed by it, raised his hat and
  greeted her as usual. She paused as if about to speak to him bitterly, but
  thought better of it and went on. It is always disconcerting to find oneself
  hated like that. Mike jeered at himself for being affected by it, but the
  look in her eyes was unforgettable.</p>

  <p>Twenty minutes later, he was at the Ware apartment. Adele let him in. Mike
  was not going to let her see the rage that was eating him. He had to forego
  the salute that she expected, because the door into the office was standing
  open.</p>

  <p>Adele, with the air of a pretty conspirator, whispered: "Anything
  new?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty," said Mike grimly. "I'll talk to you later. Is Kinsey in?"</p>

  <p>"In her room."</p>

  <p>"Ask her to meet me in Madam's boudoir."</p>

  <p>He looked in on Day Radnor. She greeted him with an aggravating smile.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I had to leave the door open."</p>

  <p>Mike showed her a smooth brow. "Why apologize?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I hate to be a spoil sport."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you and I understand each other."</p>

  <p>"When Cummings was arrested, Mr. MacKelcan put me in charge here," she
  explained.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Mike. "Have you accepted his other offer?"</p>

  <p>"I'm still thinking about it."</p>

  <p>In spite of his resolution, Mike began to grow hot. He thought: She has
  the advantage of me, because she doesn't give a damn. He said with false
  heartiness: "Well, that's fine! Mac is such a gentleman!"</p>

  <p>Day laughed delightedly. Confound her! thought Mike. She can always get my
  goat!</p>

  <p>He told her the nature of his present errand. "Know anything about the
  safe in Mrs. Ware's dressing room?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Day shook her head. "Outside my department. There's a safe in this room
  for securities and legal papers that I'm responsible for."</p>

  <p>"You can't tell me, then, if anybody besides Mrs. Ware had the combination
  of the upstairs safe?"</p>

  <p>"I never had it," said Day smiling, "so it can't be me...Anybody
  <i>may</i> have had it. Every now and then, Mrs. Ware would lose the paper on
  which it was written down, and there would be an uproar until it was found
  again. After this had happened twice, I told her she ought to have the
  combination changed, but she refused to take the trouble."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll talk to Kinsey about it," said Mike. "See you on the way
  out."</p>

  <p>"I'll be waiting breathlessly."</p>

  <p>He found the elderly lady's maid in the boudoir. The sight of her cold
  gray eyes and sharp nose affected him unpleasantly, but he whipped up his
  gallantry. "Good morning, Miss Kinsey. How well you're looking! Throughout
  all this horrible affair, you have never lost your poise."</p>

  <p>Kinsey was not proof against flattery&mdash;perhaps because she had had so
  little. She bridled and smiled thinly. "Well, I'm sure I always do my best,
  Mr. Speedon."</p>

  <p>After a few pleasant exchanges, Mike got down to business.</p>

  <p>"Miss Kinsey, the police are interested in a box of keys that was found in
  Mrs. Ware's wall safe in the dressing room. Do you know about them?"</p>

  <p>"I saw the little box whenever I went to the safe, Mr. Speedon. I never
  had any occasion to open it."</p>

  <p>"You knew what it contained, though?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. I asked Madam what was in it and she said duplicate keys to the
  different doors in the house, the liquor cupboard, the silver chest, and so
  on."</p>

  <p>"Did she ever take out any of the keys?"</p>

  <p>"Not that I am aware of, Mr. Speedon."</p>

  <p>"Did anybody have the combination of the safe except herself?"</p>

  <p>"I learned it in time," Kinsey answered readily, "through having opened
  the safe for her so many times. I told her I had learned the combination by
  heart and that she had better have it changed if she did not trust me, and
  she said: 'What nonsense! If I did not trust you, I would not keep you about
  me.'"</p>

  <p>"Let's go in and check up the keys," suggested Mike.</p>

  <p>The wall safe was concealed behind a framed picture. The picture swung
  out, revealing the little round door with the combination lock in it. The
  safe contained nothing now but the small wooden box of keys. An instant's
  investigation convinced Mike that the two keys found in the catch basin had
  come from this box. Each of the remaining keys had a similar loop of strong
  thread with a label attached to identify it.</p>

  <p>"Madam was very careless about locking the safe," Kinsey volunteered.
  "Many and many's the time I have found it open and locked it myself, and
  sometimes got scolded for it, when she couldn't find the combination."</p>

  <p>"Who was accustomed to visit this room besides yourself?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>"Well, Cummings frequently came here to consult with Madam and receive her
  orders. The other servants had no call to come here. I cleaned the room
  myself, and I was usually sitting here with my sewing when Madam was
  out."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Besson?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally, Mr. Besson frequently sat here while Madam was having her hair
  dressed or her nails done. And Mrs. Prior, of course, besides other ladies
  with whom Madam was friendly. You yourself sat here more than once, Mr.
  Speedon, during the time when you were visiting Madam."</p>

  <p>"That's a fact," said Mike morosely. He arose.</p>

  <p>"I hope I have been of assistance to you," said Kinsey in her prim
  way.</p>

  <p>"You have been very obliging," said Mike, "but I can't say that I'm any
  forrader. All I've learned is that the keys could have been lifted by any one
  of a dozen persons including myself."</p>

  <p>"Nobody could think such a thing of you, Mr. Speedon."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Mike dryly.</p>

  <p>He returned to Day Radnor's office feeling sunk. He wouldn't let Day see
  it, and she had no mercy on him. Still, it was a comfort to be with her,
  because he was well assured that whatever phony evidence might turn up, Day
  would never believe that he had had a hand in the murder. While Day was
  chaffing him, Adele entered and handed him a note left at the door by a
  messenger. Mike's face lighted up when he read it. He showed it to Day with a
  grin. "In Takaku's inimitable style."</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">Mister Mike Sir</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Please, a boy messenger proffer insignificant package
  from Stamford Conn. at 2 p.m. Boy assert he forbidden to deposit package in
  any but your honorable hands personally. Boy prophecy he return 4 p.m.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Please, I not knowing if this package important to your
  honor's concern, so I write.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Your obedient servant,</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Takaku.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">P.S. Please, I am going to my store now.</p>

  <p><br>
  Mike instantly felt better. "Stamford?" he said, thrusting the note in his
  pocket. "That's where the murderer hired a letter box. There may be something
  in this. It might be the much-wanted second syringe. It's close to four. I'll
  toddle 'round to my place and see. Be seeing you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

  <p class="first">MIKE ran up the steps of his decorous brownstone front, too
  full of anticipation to give a thought to possible danger to himself. Who
  looks for danger at home? Lexington Avenue was quiet at the moment, the
  evening rush northward not having begun. He thought, as he had often thought
  before, what a pious, old-timey street it was, standing in dignified
  aloofness from the swank and bustle a little to the west. In the vestibule he
  struggled for the thousandth time with his letter box, which was too small to
  contain the big, stiff envelopes then in fashion. How the postman must curse
  it! he thought.</p>

  <p>He opened the house door and covered the ten paces to his own door at the
  rear of the hall. He opened his door and shut it behind him with his foot. He
  took three steps into his bedroom. Just as he received the impression that
  there was a smell in the room which did not belong there, a woman smell, a
  crashing blow descended on the back of his head and he passed out.</p>

  <p>Consciousness returned by degrees. As in a nightmare, he became aware that
  his eyelids and lips were tightly sealed with surgeon's tape, and his arms
  and legs bound. The binding process was not finished. He was lying on his
  stomach and a pair of knees was pressing into his back. His overcoat had been
  removed. Hearing was the only faculty that remained to him. From far away
  came the hum of traffic in the streets. As in a dream, he cried out with all
  his might and heard only a strangled groan issuing from his throat.</p>

  <p>A voice beside him said in a tense whisper: "He's coming to."</p>

  <p>Another replied&mdash;this was the man kneeling on him: "It's all right, I
  have him fast."</p>

  <p>Mike twisted and rolled with the strength of desperation, but did not
  succeed in dislodging the crushing weight on his back. He bumped his head
  against the floor but without hope of attracting attention, for it was his
  own rooms that lay beneath. The whole house was rented by bachelors who would
  all be out at this hour. Mike then, for the first time in his life, knew
  panic fear.</p>

  <p>The whispering voice beside him said&mdash;he judged it to be a woman:
  "Don't pull the ropes too tight. If they leave marks on him it will arouse
  suspicion."</p>

  <p>The man muttered: "I have it in mind."</p>

  <p>He tied the last knot and got up. Instantly Mike began to thrash and roll
  and strike out with his bound feet like a maddened animal. He heard them
  laugh softly together.</p>

  <p>"Watch out for his feet," the man whispered, in a voice shaken with
  laughter.</p>

  <p>Mike, finding his struggles in vain, became quiet. Better save his
  strength. The man whispered:</p>

  <p>"See if he's got the letter we sent him. That mustn't be found. I'll hold
  him."</p>

  <p>Slim fingers, as nimble as rats, began to go through Mike's pockets. "I
  have it," she said.</p>

  <p>"Put it in your stocking. You might as well see if he has any dangerous
  evidence in his pockets."</p>

  <p>The slim hands continued to explore Mike's clothes. "Here are the service
  door keys," she said.</p>

  <p>"Damn! Give them to me!"</p>

  <p>"It's risky. If he was known to have them on him, it will raise a
  doubt..."</p>

  <p>"Give them to me, I say." Presumably she obeyed.</p>

  <p>She got up. "What'll I do with his hat and coat?" she asked. "I don't know
  where he hangs them."</p>

  <p>"Just throw them on the bed. If he came home to kill himself, he wouldn't
  bother to hang them up."</p>

  <p>An icy chill stole through Mike's veins. These were not human beings, but
  fiends.</p>

  <p>The man said: "I'll drag him close to his desk so it will look as if he
  had slipped out of his chair after writing the note."</p>

  <p>He caught Mike under the arms and started dragging him towards the bedroom
  door. He was not a very strong man, for he struggled and panted with his
  burden. Before he reached the door, the telephone bell suddenly shrilled. He
  dropped Mike with an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Christ! what a start that gave me!" he whispered shakily.</p>

  <p>The bell continued to ring at intervals. The two waited. Mike's whole
  being yearned towards the instrument. If he could only reach it!</p>

  <p>"Will the damn thing never stop!" muttered the man. "How can I do anything
  with that going on!"</p>

  <p>The woman said: "I'll stop it with paper." Her voice was steady.</p>

  <p>The bell was heard no more. The man again lifted Mike under the shoulders
  and dragged him over the threshold of the door into the rear room. He was
  dropped again alongside his desk, as he supposed.</p>

  <p>"Take a look around," said the man. "Make sure we haven't dropped
  anything."</p>

  <p>"I have taken good care of that," she said.</p>

  <p>"The letter is in the machine where the servant will find it?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think it will arouse suspicion because it's not signed by
  hand?"</p>

  <p>"No, not if it's left in the machine. He is accustomed to leave letters
  that way for his servant."</p>

  <p>"Turn him over on his face so you can get to his arm."</p>

  <p>Mike was turned over.</p>

  <p>"Have you the syringe?" asked the man.</p>

  <p>"Here."</p>

  <p>A cold sweat broke out all over Mike's body. Before his mind's eye, his
  whole life unrolled in a flash. Living was so pleasant!</p>

  <p>"Let the box and the cover lie on the desk as if he had just opened
  it."</p>

  <p>Mike was galvanized into action again. He humped up his bound body; he
  twisted; he shook violently. The man's knees dropped in his back, but he
  couldn't hold Mike. He cursed him thickly and pounded his neck with his
  fist.</p>

  <p>"Stop it!" whispered the woman sharply. "You'll leave marks."</p>

  <p>Mike succeeded in throwing the knees off his back and the man flung
  himself on him full length to hold him down. A button came in contact with
  one of Mike's bound hands. His fingers closed around it and it parted from
  the fabric. Mike clenched his hand over it.</p>

  <p>"I can't hold him... can't hold him!" whispered the man.</p>

  <p>"Give me the syringe," she whispered. "My hand is steady!"</p>

  <p>There was a shrieking inside Mike. She-fiend! She-fiend! The man turned
  himself around and kneeled between Mike's shoulders. The woman dropped on his
  legs. He could no longer move his body but he kept jerking his bound hands
  out of her grasp. She actually laughed.</p>

  <p>"Like trying to kill a cat," she whispered.</p>

  <p>The man leaned forward, pressing Mike's clenched hands into the small of
  his back. "Jab it in the blue vein!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>Mike redoubled his struggles. He heard the sound of his own hoarse sobbing
  for breath as if it came from another. God! the poor fellow's heart will
  break! he thought. Better so! Better so! Once he succeeded in throwing the
  man off his back, but the knees soon dropped between his shoulders and his
  hands were pressed down again.</p>

  <p>"Jab him! Jab him!" the man whispered furiously. "It's no matter if you
  miss the vein. You'll hit it next time!"</p>

  <p>"No!" she said coolly. "If he was doing it to himself he wouldn't
  miss."</p>

  <p>Mike hung in expectation of the stroke of death.</p>

  <p>It was not given. The house bell rang, and the two on top of him froze
  into stillness.</p>

  <p>"Christ! somebody at the door!" whispered the man.</p>

  <p>"What difference does it make?" she said coolly, "They can't get in."</p>

  <p>Mike heard bells ringing all through the house, and waited with his heart
  standing still. Nobody home! Nobody home! The man and woman jumped up,
  waiting. They <i>did</i> get in. The house door banged, and there was a rush
  of feet through the hall.</p>

  <p>"We're dished!" muttered the man, "Downstairs and out the basement door."
  He administered a parting kick in the ribs to Mike, and they silently fled. A
  burning current of joy coursed through Mike's veins. He had said good-by to
  life, and he was not dead!</p>

  <p>The apartment door crashed back against the wall, and two people, running
  to his side, dropped to the floor. The strips of tape were tenderly pulled
  from his eyelids and he saw Day Radnor and little Takaku. "Mike, oh, Mike,
  are you hurt?" Day was crying. The little Jap's teeth were clenched in rage
  and pity. The moment half of Mike's lips were freed, he hissed:</p>

  <p>"Quick, Takaku! Gone through the basement! Head 'em off in front!"</p>

  <p>The Japanese ran out.</p>

  <p>Never had Mike seen such a look in Day's eyes. "Hi, Day!" he said,
  grinning. "Just in time!"</p>

  <p>With a little groan, she raised his head on her arm and, stooping, pressed
  her lips to his.</p>

  <p>"Gosh! I'm glad I'm here to take it!" murmured Mike. "Give me another dose
  of that medicine!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, smiling.</p>

  <p>"How did you make it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"After you had gone I got to thinking about that letter from Takaku. It
  <i>sounded</i> all right, but why should he have written a letter and called
  a messenger instead of telephoning? So I called up Takaku at his store and he
  said no, he had sent you no letter. I called Radigan then, and jumped in a
  cab. I got here first, but I couldn't get in! I couldn't get in! But Takaku
  was close behind me, and he had the keys."</p>

  <p>Takaku came running in. "They gone, Mister Mike. No can see anywhere!"</p>

  <p>Mike shrugged. Takaku sawed through the ropes with a butcher knife,
  hissing and whimpering with sympathy. They helped Mike to his feet and he
  stood wavering.</p>

  <p>"No bones broken?" demanded Day anxiously.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Only a bit stiff and sore," he said, smiling. "I'll
  feel worse before I'm better." He flung his arms wide in a sudden passion of
  thankfulness. "But, Oh, God! I'm here! I'm here!" He dropped in a chair.</p>

  <p>A sudden squall of rage was heard from Takaku. He stood beside the desk
  pointing to a letter that had been left on the roll in the typewriter.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch it!" warned Mike. "Let Radigan see it just as it is!"</p>

  <p>Day read out the letter. "At the top it says: 'Takaku, deliver this to
  Lieutenant Radigan at Police Headquarters.' Then below: 'Dear Rad: I can't
  keep it up. It was I who killed Mrs. Ware. My creditors were hounding me and
  I wanted the legacy. I plotted the whole thing and carried it out by myself.
  Cummings, the poor boob, had no part in it. God! it was exciting always to
  keep just one jump ahead of you, but it got so at last that I couldn't sleep
  nights. I'm going to fluff out before I start picking the sheets. You'll find
  the second syringe beside me. All the time you and I were looking for it, it
  was in my pocket. I kept it handy in case anything went wrong. Well, it was a
  great life, but I've weakened. Yours, Mike.'"</p>

  <p>They were silent. Day said at last in a strained voice:</p>

  <p>"Not a very good imitation of your style!"</p>

  <p>Mike was beyond wise-cracking. "Oh, God! how close I came to it!" he
  murmured. "How close...!"</p>

  <p>Day began to cry silently. Day in tears! Mike could scarcely believe his
  eyes. Takaku was muttering imprecations in his own tongue.</p>

  <p>In the excitement the doors had been left open, and Radigan presently
  walked in on them, followed by his side partner, Sergeant Hodges. Hasty
  explanations were made; the syringe and the letter were pointed out to
  Radigan. The hard-boiled Lieutenant actually turned pale.</p>

  <p>"This letter would never have fooled me!" he cried violently.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, it would," said Mike, smiling. "It would fool anybody. And you
  were already convinced that I was guilty!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," mumbled Radigan. "I'm sorry, Mike...Well, you were too damn
  smart!" he burst out.</p>

  <p>Mike laughed weakly.</p>

  <p>"What was their motive, anyhow?" asked Radigan.</p>

  <p>Day spoke up. "That's easy. They believed that Mike was about to bring the
  murder home to them. Mike was the one they feared."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yeah?" said Radigan, not too well pleased. "Do you know who it was?"
  he demanded of Mike.</p>

  <p>Mike slowly shook his head. "I couldn't swear to it..."</p>

  <p>"Think, man! They were close to you! You heard them; you felt them!"</p>

  <p>"It was a man and a woman. The man seemed like a big fellow, but he wasn't
  very strong. It was all he could do to drag me from the bedroom in here. The
  woman was small and active. Her hands were like claws. She had the stronger
  nerve of the two. A she-fiend!"</p>

  <p>"Well, we know who <i>they</i> are," said Radigan, smiling. "Norbert was
  released at three o'clock and he and Mrs. Laval left the court together."</p>

  <p>Mike shook his head again. "It wasn't Mrs. Laval. This woman had a
  different smell."</p>

  <p>"Then who?..."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't swear to it..."</p>

  <p>Day spoke up suddenly. "Mike, what have you been holding in your hand all
  this time?"</p>

  <p>Mike extended his clenched hand and opened it. On the palm lay a white
  pearl button.</p>

  <p>They looked at each other.</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>Ten minutes later, they were entering Sanford MacKelcan's office, Mike and
  the two detectives. Business appeared to be going on as usual, the pale clerk
  writing at his desk and Lottie Bedford making a great clatter at her
  typewriter. The latter jumped up in her usual effusive fashion; talkative,
  watchful, self-assured. She looked each man in the eye, but Mike noted that
  she was lividly pale under her make-up. The hastily applied rouge stood out
  on her cheeks in circles of carmine. Without waiting to be asked, she
  said:</p>

  <p>"Oh, gentlemen, I'm so sorry Mr. MacKelcan is out. He was called up to the
  Bronx to see a client. The man is sick and was unable to come to our office.
  Mr. MacKelcan said he would call me at five-thirty, and if there is any
  message you would like to send him, I'll see that..."</p>

  <p>She was talking louder than was necessary. Was it to enable her words to
  carry into the next room? Mike slipped out into the corridor again, and was
  just in time to come face to face with MacKelcan quietly issuing out of his
  private office next door. Guilt and terror were written in his face. Mike saw
  red. Hauling off, he delivered a blow in the attorney's face that stretched
  his lean figure on the mosaic floor.</p>

  <p>"That's for the kick in the ribs," said Mike.</p>

  <p>Wrapping his arms around his head, MacKelcan rolled on the floor
  whimpering: "Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me!"</p>

  <p>Radigan was quickly beside Mike. Hodges came after, bringing the woman.
  MacKelcan was helped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Why, Mac!" drawled Radigan. "You have lost a button off your vest."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE the police got their hands on the real criminals, their
  task was much easier. Many additional bits of evidence were forthcoming. The
  taxicab driver was found who had picked up MacKelcan and Lottie Bedford as
  they ran from Mike's apartment. This man had driven them to Grand Central
  where, no doubt, they had taken another cab to MacKelcan's office. Late that
  night, when the streets were cleaned, a sweeper in Lexington Avenue picked up
  the two pairs of keys where they had been dropped from the taxicab window,
  and turned them over to the police.</p>

  <p>Witnesses were found who were prepared to testify that on several
  occasions they had seen either MacKelcan or Lottie in the neighborhood of
  Mike's apartment. Lottie, upon being taken to Stamford, was identified by a
  post-office employee as a woman who had been seen to visit the letter box
  hired in the name of John Jones. A search through Dr. Patton's letter files
  turned up a letter signed by "John Jones" of Stamford. It was Dr. Patton's
  answer to this letter which had served as a foundation for the order for
  hypodermic syringes. John Jones' communication was written on a typewriter in
  MacKelcan's office. So it went. Finally, a locksmith was found who identified
  Lottie as the woman who had ordered him to make the two keys for Mike's place
  from samples which she brought with her.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan denied everything. He engaged one of the most conspicuous
  criminal lawyers in New York to defend him, and between them they tried hard
  to shift suspicion back to Norbert Besson. MacKelcan told how he had picked
  up the dagger on the floor of Mrs. Ware's room, and, supposing it to be one
  of her curios, had placed it on the shelf. There was little doubt in the
  public mind that Norbert and Mrs. Laval had gone to Mrs. Ware's suite with
  the object of killing her, but their purpose had been defeated by the arrival
  of MacKelcan at the door. Norbert and Mrs. Laval were able to bring forward a
  watertight alibi to account for their movements on Monday afternoon.</p>

  <p>When the police had built up a pretty complete case against the prisoners,
  Lottie Bedford suddenly offered to turn State's evidence, and from that
  moment MacKelcan was doomed. The woman's story supplied several missing links
  in the chain of evidence. She told how, from the time that Mrs. Ware first
  retained him, the lawyer had been working to obtain the kind of will he
  wanted, which would give him full control of the Ware millions without
  exciting suspicion.</p>

  <p>Just as soon as Mrs. Ware had signed such a will, he started plotting to
  kill her. Because he knew how capricious she was, he was assured that no will
  would be allowed to stand for long. He laid his plans with the greatest
  patience and skill, but in the end he was obliged to act swiftly, and some of
  the final details had to be left to chance. Nevertheless, had it not been for
  Alfred's stealing the jewels, the murder would never have been
  discovered.</p>

  <p>That was MacKelcan's aim, but at the same time he was taking no chances,
  and from the first he had plotted to hang the crime on Mike in case anything
  went wrong. It was MacKelcan who had called up Police Headquarters to give
  them the tip against Mike. On one of his early visits to Mike's rooms, he had
  seen a spare set of keys hanging on a hook alongside the door and had quietly
  annexed them. He gave them to Lottie to have duplicates made, and the
  originals were returned to their place before their loss was discovered.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan had learned about the daily correspondence between Mike and
  Takaku. Mike kept a bundle of Takaku's letters in a drawer of his desk for
  the sake of their quaint expressions. MacKelcan studied them on his secret
  visits to Mike's flat, and so familiarized himself with Takaku's style.
  MacKelcan had soon learned that Mike's flat was always empty between the
  hours of nine and twelve in the morning and could safely be visited then.</p>

  <p>As to the murder, MacKelcan had been in possession of the keys to the
  service entrances for some time, Lottie said. While sitting with Mrs. Ware in
  her dressing room, it had been a simple matter for him to lift them from the
  unlocked safe when she was called to talk on the telephone in the next room.
  All the keys were labeled.</p>

  <p>On the night of the murder, MacKelcan had drunk with Mrs. Ware, having
  seen to it that her drink was loaded with barbital. She had probably taken
  another dose of barbital after he left her. He went home, taking care to
  leave with other guests, and to arouse some of his family so that they would
  be in a position to testify as to the hour. However, his wife unwittingly let
  slip the fact that he had made some excuse to sleep in another bed for the
  balance of the night.</p>

  <p>He had returned to the Ware apartment by the service entrance and service
  stairs. He found that Mrs. Ware had fallen asleep in the corner of the sofa
  in her boudoir. He killed her. He laid her body on the floor in such a manner
  that it would appear she had fallen in a heart attack. He left the apartment
  the same way he had come. By this time he had learned that Norbert had
  visited the old lady during the evening. He broke up the syringe and dropped
  it in the sewer basin nearest Norbert's hotel, in case it should turn out to
  be easier to hang the crime on Norbert.</p>

  <p>So far, everything had gone off according to schedule, but Alfred's theft
  of the jewels made a mess of his well-considered plan. MacKelcan had to
  improvise measures to meet the new situation. Later, he received another
  upset when he discovered that Cummings was no other than his client, James
  Fawcett. This really shook MacKelcan's nerve, and his subsequent actions did
  not exhibit his usual cleverness. Nevertheless, his plot came within an ace
  of succeeding.</p>

  <p>MacKelcan finally paid the extreme penalty for his act. Lottie Bedford got
  off with a comparatively light sentence.</p>

  <p>When Cummings-Fawcett was released from durance, he returned to the Fifth
  Avenue apartment in the character of its master. The romantic story of this
  man capped the climax of the sensational Ware case. For a while, Fawcett was
  the most talked-about man in New York, and his fame increased in proportion
  as he refused to capitalize on it. He would not be interviewed nor allow
  himself to be photographed. He answered no letters and declined to talk over
  the phone. Such obduracy in a darling of the public had never been met with.
  Crowds hung about the door of the apartment house and followed him wherever
  he went. After a few experiences of this sort of thing, he refused to go out
  any more. He and his friend, Ralph Maxwell, were reconciled, and fantastic
  rumors were circulated as to the amount of whisky they disposed of
  together.</p>

  <p>Warner Bassett was always after Mike to get a story out of Fawcett, but
  Mike flatly refused. "Let the man keep a little human dignity," he said.
  "It's rare." However, in the absence of any real information, the stories
  about Fawcett became so fantastic that Mike was finally stirred to go and see
  him on his own account.</p>

  <p>The pretty Adele admitted him to the apartment. She instantly advertised
  to Mike by her demure and stand-offish air, that the situation between them
  was changed. Mike enjoyed an inward laugh. Who could blame the girl, he
  thought, for seeing which side her bread was buttered on? She was wearing a
  string of real pearls.</p>

  <p>"Will you see if Mr. Fawcett will see me?" Mike inquired blandly. "Tell
  him it's not on account of the newspaper, but a personal matter."</p>

  <p>"I'll see, sir."</p>

  <p>She presently returned, saying: "Be good enough to step this way,
  sir."</p>

  <p>Mike could no longer contain his laughter. Adele bit her lip, but was
  presently forced to join him. Whereupon they felt more comfortable with each
  other.</p>

  <p>"How are things?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to complain of," said Adele demurely.</p>

  <p>"Where is his nibs?"</p>

  <p>"In the boudoir&mdash;I mean the master's study."</p>

  <p>"Okay, I know the way." Mike ran up the stairs. In the upper hall, another
  exceedingly pretty girl in a maid's uniform fluttered away. The old devils!
  thought Mike.</p>

  <p>He found Fawcett and his side-kick Maxwell in their shirt sleeves drawn up
  in easy chairs before a blazing fire. Each man had his feet on a little table
  and another beside him bearing a whisky bottle. Both were mellow, though it
  was only three o'clock in the afternoon. Neither moved at Mike's
  entrance.</p>

  <p>"How are ye, Mr. Speedon!" cried Fawcett. "Draw up and fill up and smoke
  up!... Mr. Speedon is a white man," he added to Maxwell. "He plays fair. He
  never hounded me."</p>

  <p>Mike drew up a chair and accepted a drink. He let the two miners run on in
  their pleasantly drunken fashion. Under the influence of prosperity and ease
  of mind, the ex-butler was completely metamorphosed. The old foxy, vicious
  look was gone.</p>

  <p>When he got an opportunity, Mike asked: "What are you doing about your
  newly acquired riches, Fawcett?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing!" said Fawcett with a grand wave of his hand. "Do we appear to
  lack anything? It's true my Missus wants me home, but she can occupy herself
  spending the money I'm sending her."</p>

  <p>"This is swell," said Mike, "but you can't spend the rest of your life
  sitting in front of the fire drinking whisky."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said Fawcett. "Anyhow, me and Rafe is going to keep it up until
  we get used to the idea that we can have as much whisky as we want, and of
  the best."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing for money?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>Fawcett tipped a portentous wink to his brother miner.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you mean you're selling the stuff in the apartment."</p>

  <p>"There's a godless amount of stuff in the place that fetches big
  prices."</p>

  <p>"Sure. But if anybody informs the court of what is going on, you can get
  into a hell of a lot of trouble."</p>

  <p>"Ain't it mine?"</p>

  <p>"It is when the court says so. There are certain simple formalities to be
  gone through with first. The will has to be offered for probate and letters
  of administration granted. A lawyer will take care of all that."</p>

  <p>Fawcett scowled. "I don't want no truck with those gentry."</p>

  <p>"You can't help yourself."</p>

  <p>"Let the Law make the first move."</p>

  <p>He was not to be budged from this position, and Mike took a new line.
  "Well, how about me? I want my legacy. Am I not entitled to it?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! Sure! Mr. Speedon. I'd hand it to you on the spot if I had it."</p>

  <p>"You never will have it until the will is probated."</p>

  <p>"Lawyers are slippery customers. Especially Yankees." (To the Britisher,
  all Americans were Yankees.)</p>

  <p>"Why not go to Keppelman? He's honest. You can apply to the court to have
  Keppelman and the Washington Trust Company appointed co-executors with
  yourself. The bank is an institution; they couldn't cheat you. And neither
  could Keppelman with the bank sitting in."</p>

  <p>Fawcett heaved a gusty sigh. "Well, I suppose I'll have to do it."</p>

  <p>Mike followed up his advantage. "Are you going to establish the trust for
  orphans that Mrs. Ware wanted?"</p>

  <p>"The hell with it!" said Fawcett violently. "If she wanted an orphan
  asylum, why didn't she build it herself? I hate orphan asylums! They rob the
  children of their manhood and womanhood!"</p>

  <p>"What would you like to do with your money?" Mike asked offhandedly. "You
  can't spend it all on whisky."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to help miners!" said Fawcett, slapping his thigh. "They have
  the hardest job on earth. American or English miners. But especially English
  miners. Thousands and thousands of them have been on the dole for years. That
  destroys men. I wouldn't offer them charity, you understand, because they're
  men just as proud as you or me. I'd like to give them work!"</p>

  <p>"Well, why don't you?"</p>

  <p>"How could I?" asked Fawcett, staring. "With my twelve million pounds?
  Government can't seem to solve the problem with its billions."</p>

  <p>"Here's one thing you could do," suggested Mike. "Build generating plants
  at the pitheads and turn the coal into electricity."</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Fawcett eagerly, "but there's too many idle pitheads. You
  couldn't sell all the electricity."</p>

  <p>"At other pitheads you could build reduction plants for turning the coal
  into gasoline. That can be done, you know. And there's no lack of sale for
  gasoline."</p>

  <p>"Man! you've got ahold of something there!" murmured Fawcett.</p>

  <p>"This is the way I'd go about it, if it was me," Mike continued. "Form a
  corporation to be known as the Coal Institute to study the development and
  improvement of the industry. Hire the best technical men in the world. You
  and Rafe Maxwell would sit on the Board of Directors as practical miners, and
  you, of course, would head the whole thing. It would bring you into contact
  with the best men of your time&mdash;as an equal. The darn thing would
  probably make money, and you could then spend the earnings in giving the
  children of miners (including your own and Rafe's) the finest education they
  were capable of taking."</p>

  <p>Cummings-Fawcett, miner, butler or millionaire, was a powerful
  personality, and his eyes began to glow. "Man! what a dream!" he murmured.
  "You and me together, eh Rafe?" Suddenly he got up.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to phone Mr. Keppelman. We've got to get this damned business
  of the will out of the way."</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>As to the other actors in the tragi-comedy, Alfred went to state's prison
  for robbery, and Mrs. Payne Laval to Reno for a divorce. But when she came
  back Norbert Besson did not marry her. Norbert laid low. Mike could picture
  what a hell the fiery little woman was plunged into, cast off by society and
  her lover alike. She disappeared from the New York scene, and Mike
  subsequently heard of her as drifting from one resort hotel to another with a
  Pekingese.</p>

  <p>Norbert remains in New York, where he still enjoys a lurid notoriety, but
  is not quite so much in demand at the hottest spots as formerly. He is
  looking for another rich old woman to marry, but after the disclosures
  concerning the dagger in the Ware case, even the most feather-brained old
  women are leery of him.</p>

  <p>Bethesda Prior lives in great comfort, not to say style, in Bloomfield,
  New Jersey, on the income from her two hundred thousand dollars. She belongs
  to the legacy-dangler type, tyrannizing over a circle of unfortunate nieces
  and nephews, while she elects first one, then another, to her favor. In the
  quiet circles of Bloomfield, Bethesda is an important figure, though it may
  be guessed that the Bloomfielders are growing a little weary of her talk
  about her darling friend, Flora Ware, who was so cruelly done to death.</p>

  <p>Kinsey took her legacy and returned to England. She married a retired
  policeman and they have set up a public house in Ealing.</p>

  <p><b>*</b></p>

  <p>When Fawcett first took possession of the Ware apartment, his mail was far
  greater than Mrs. Ware's had ever been. Apparently, every begging
  letter-writer in the U.S.A. immediately sat down to indite a heart-breaking
  appeal to the new millionaire. Fawcett asked Day Radnor to stay on and take
  care of the flood, but she declined. Consequently, the letters remained
  unopened and unanswered. All that literary effort was wasted.</p>

  <p>Day took a position as corresponding secretary for the League of Women
  Voters. She is not especially interested either in women or politics, but the
  job rates good pay. Mike Speedon continues to drop in on her&mdash;because he
  cannot stay away. In their verbal sparring matches Day enjoys the advantage
  because Mike is divided in his mind; torn between his desire to master the
  provoking Day and his horror of marriage. When he feels himself beginning to
  weaken, he stays away for a while. Day is perfectly well aware of the
  struggle in his soul, but as for her own feelings in the matter, she hides
  them.</p>
