  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>I. &mdash; ALL MEN ARE MORTAL</h2>

  <p class="first">NEARLY every one in the small town of Starminster was sorry
  to hear of Charlie Baxter's death. He was popular with women, while men
  invariably called him a "decent little chap"&mdash;a curious inaccuracy,
  since he was well over medium height.</p>

  <p>A gentle unassuming nature, he stole out of life as unobtrusively as he
  left a party&mdash;when he nodded farewell to his host and slipped away,
  without any one knowing that he had gone. At the time flu was epidemic. One
  day, some one mentioned casually that he was ill. The next bit of news was a
  thunderclap in the billiard-room at the Grapes.</p>

  <p>"Poor Baxter's passed out."</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of "Poor chap," for Charlie's slate was clean. He paid
  his bills, subscribed modestly to local charities, and listened to golf
  stories. Did the usual things, while his game was always a trifle below the
  standard of his opponent; the drinks were inevitably on him, but he was a
  cheerful loser.</p>

  <p>No one was really surprised, therefore, to hear that Death had found him a
  bit below his form, and had taken advantage of the fact.</p>

  <p>"When did he die?" asked some one.</p>

  <p>"Late last night," replied the herald.</p>

  <p>"Flu, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Sudden collapse. Heart was weak, I'm told."</p>

  <p>"No, it wasn't," announced Acorn, the Insurance agent.</p>

  <p>He chalked his cue and looked around him, with no real hope, for some one
  whom he could beat at snooker. He was the first person to miss Charlie
  Baxter.</p>

  <p>"Damn mistake if they had that old fool Dubarry to attend him," he said
  savagely. "Another doctor might have pulled him through."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Baxter swears by him," remarked a masculine gossip.</p>

  <p>"She would."</p>

  <p>The company grunted assent. It was an established fact that Dr. Dubarry
  had the brains of a stewed mushroom, and allowed nothing to interfere with
  his personal pleasure; but it had to be admitted in his favour that he had
  almost entirely ceased to practise, and only took on a case after personal
  persuasion.</p>

  <p>When the matrons of the town heard of Charlie Baxter's death they added a
  rider to the verdict of medical inefficiency. They hinted that Vera Baxter
  might have been too casual in her treatment of the patient. Heads were shaken
  and tongues wagged.</p>

  <p>"He always waited on her. It would be a change for her to wait on him. A
  pity they did not have a trained nurse."</p>

  <p>"But Dr. Dubarry said she was wonderful," observed a more charitable
  tongue.</p>

  <p>"He would. She's a pretty woman."</p>

  <p>Unlike her husband, Vera Baxter was not very popular in the town. She was
  a cheery, capable little person, with an anti-litter mind; but she could not
  play hockey, and they could never be certain that she had gone to the right
  school.</p>

  <p>In appearance, she was a slim, pretty blonde&mdash;smart and
  decorative&mdash;who looked too young to be married, until it was noticed
  that her shrewd blue eyes had grown up before the rest of her.</p>

  <p>What the town chiefly resented was the third occupant of Jasmine
  Cottage&mdash;Puggie Williams. He had been a fixture there for several months
  and was a man of mystery. He wore old well-cut clothes with distinction and
  his voice betrayed breeding; but he had the red-veined mashed face of a hard
  drinker, and when he remembered to forget his origin, his manners were
  appalling.</p>

  <p>It was evident, however, that he had begun life in a different social
  sphere from that of his friends, and had probably met them, when he was
  sliding down the ladder and they were climbing up, so had clung round their
  necks, as ballast.</p>

  <p>He appeared to be on excellent terms with Charlie and a real friendship
  seemed to exist between the three. Vera ordered him about as much as she
  dominated her gentle husband, for she was the type who expected men to be
  doormats. All the same, the town could not accept Puggie, in connection with
  Vera, because of his sex.</p>

  <p>The news of the tragedy swept through Starminster like a prairie fire. It
  was a day of wretched weather. There had been a heavy snowfall in the night,
  so that, in the morning, every roof was white-capped and the church steeple
  looked like a sugar-loaf.</p>

  <p>Now, however, it had begun to melt. Slush covered the pavements and lay in
  the gutter, while the country roads were churned by traffic to the
  consistency of brown fudge. The hills were iced silhouettes against the grey
  sky, and the streets appeared dark and miserable. People's
  faces&mdash;pinched with cold&mdash;seemed actually dirty, so that any one
  with an artificial complexion was a public benefactor. It was chill and
  gloomy, and no time to think of death.</p>

  <p>Yet it was constantly in the thoughts of many a woman. Charlie's last
  public appearance had been at a Primrose Dance, when there had been a
  man-famine. Too retiring to invite the attractive girls and women, he had
  danced exclusively with wallflowers.</p>

  <p>He was an excellent dancer&mdash;light as a feather&mdash;with a springy
  step and tireless rhythm. Stout matrons, whose husbands were dancing with
  buds, seemed to swing years off their age as they swayed in Charlie's arms.
  Spinsters, who were too mature for public competition, and schoolgirls, who
  were too callow, found in him not only a partner, but sympathy and
  deference.</p>

  <p>One of these was a Miss Belson, an unmarried woman of some social
  standing, who had been forced to attend the function because of its political
  nature. Sitting glued to a hard cane-chair, it did not console her to
  remember that twenty years previously she had been so much in demand that she
  was forced to subdivide her programme.</p>

  <p>She, too, was an excellent dancer, and Charlie confided to her that she
  was his best partner. He talked to her about herself, while his soft brown
  eyes paid her those compliments which his tongue was too circumspect to
  utter. With customary modesty, he let her usurp their conversation; his sole
  personal item was the confession that his beard was not artistic swank, but a
  safeguard for a delicate throat.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind admitting I look better with it than without," he added,
  with a little laugh. "You know. Chin."</p>

  <p>"I hate Strong Men, like Mussolini and Cromwell," declared Miss
  Belson.</p>

  <p>For Charlie had watered the patch of dried romance in her heart, so that
  she began to wonder whether his married life was happy, and to notice that
  Vera danced almost exclusively with Puggie Williams.</p>

  <p>She was at the library when she heard of his death. It was a terrible
  shock for her, when the man who had reminded her that she was a woman as well
  as a ratepayer flicked out of her life, in one casual sentence from the
  librarian.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it sad about poor Mr. Baxter?"</p>

  <p>She asked for details with correct composure, but, instead of choosing her
  usual recommended book, she carried away with her a thriller. She felt she
  wanted something to take her thoughts off the tragedy.</p>

  <p>On her way home she was gripped with an uncontrollable urge to go to
  Jasmine Cottage and look at the building which held the shell of the man she
  had met too late. In soaked shoes, she shuffled along over slushy pavements
  and past snow-powdered laurels, until she reached the little cream-washed
  house.</p>

  <p>It was built on the extreme outskirts of the town, for only two lamp-posts
  divided it from the utter darkness of the York Road. No light was visible,
  although the blue-green curtains at the small casement windows were partially
  undrawn, so that she could see the flicker of a fire in the lounge. As she
  paused, a car passed, and its lamps bathed the room in a momentary glow.</p>

  <p>She saw two people&mdash;Vera Baxter and Puggie Williams&mdash;who were
  sitting close together, as though they were talking in whispers. There was
  something so furtive in their attitude that it compelled her attention. She
  caught the flash of teeth and eyes, and wondered incredulously whether they
  were laughing.</p>

  <p>Although she could not be positive about what she had seen, she walked
  home, throbbing with anger. Instinct insisted that Vera Baxter was not
  mourning for her husband.</p>

  <p>Miss Belson lived with her widowed sister, Lady Fry, who was stout and
  bronchial. Once she was inside the well-warmed house, she could shut out the
  cold and misery of the streets; but she could not forget the incident. It
  remained&mdash;a burr on her mind&mdash;throughout an excellent dinner, when
  she ate mechanically, and agreed with her sister that poor Charles Baxter
  looked like a man who needed "mothering."</p>

  <p>That night she read in bed with a hope to induce sleep; but the thriller
  did not provide the usual escape from life. Instead, its chief function was
  to sidetrack her thoughts into a new and terrible direction.</p>

  <p>Murder.</p>

  <p>She told herself that if two persons wanted to put a third out of the way,
  it would be easy to pull the wool over the eyes of the doctor, if he was an
  incompetent fool. They had the opportunity to administer a poison or drug,
  which would cause a collapse in the ordinary course of illness, especially if
  the patient had a weak heart.</p>

  <p>Even to herself Miss Belson was careful not to mention names.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she remembered Charlie Baxter's tireless dancing. He had never
  panted or shown the least sign of distress. There was a beating inside her
  temples and her palms grew clammy as she sprang up in the bed.</p>

  <p>"Suppose he was murdered," she murmured. "What could I do?"</p>

  <p>At that moment she realised the moral courage of those who appeal to the
  Police. In her own case, however, her course was obvious. Even in the face of
  a discrepancy she rejected the monstrous notion.</p>

  <p>"What an awful thing to think, without a shred of evidence. It's this
  wretched book."</p>

  <p>She slammed down the novel on the table and switched off her light.</p>

  <p>All the same this fact is definite. Had Dr. Dubarry&mdash;speeding through
  France in the Blue Train&mdash;not taken too much for granted, he would never
  have written a Certificate of Death for Charles Baxter.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; THE MIRACLE</h2>

  <p class="first">SOON after the news became known the first flowers arrived
  at Jasmine Cottage. They were brought by a matron who was so sorry to hear of
  Charlie's death that she wanted to know more about it.</p>

  <p>To her surprise the door was opened by Puggie Williams, wearing a
  mulberry-silk dressing-gown, which threw up all the smouldering tints of his
  complexion. He appeared to have been keeping up his spirits in time-honoured
  fashion, for he stared stupidly at the caller's bunch of white violets.</p>

  <p>"What are these for?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Just a few blooms from my frame, for&mdash;for the room," explained the
  inquisitive lady.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Charlie." Puggie's face lit up. "By gum, the poor little chap will be
  pleased." He sighed as he corrected himself. "I mean, he <i>would</i> be
  pleased if he could see them."</p>

  <p>"How is Mrs. Baxter?" inquired the matron.</p>

  <p>"Crashed. Definitely crashed." Puggie lowered his voice. "She's just sent
  the maid away. Positively can't stick any one around. Nerves, you know."</p>

  <p>"Can't I do something to help?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, thanks frightfully. There's always P.W. on tap. She's used to
  me, so I don't count." He plunged his short bulbous nose into the white
  violets. "The stink of these always bring back a memory," he said
  sentimentally. "A wet country road and a red-haired girl in riding-kit. We'd
  been coming back from hunting, and she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off and added, "Well, Charlie's just another memory now. Thanks
  for the violets, Mrs. Er-Ah-Um. Charlie'll love them."</p>

  <p>A little later, Puggie Williams was popular for the first time, for he
  became Official News. He appeared in High Street, wearing a dark suit, and
  combined pink eyelids with a set expression.</p>

  <p>He informed people that Mrs. Baxter was deeply grateful for every one's
  sympathy, but was too upset to see callers until after the funeral.</p>

  <p>"I'm rushing it on, on purpose," he explained. "Day after to-morrow if I
  can make the grade. Fact is, Vera&mdash;Mrs. Baxter&mdash;is morbid about
  death. Can't keep her out of the room. She'll be normal once the&mdash;body's
  out of the house. Besides, directly it's over I can clear out."</p>

  <p>The fact that Puggie was convention-conscious caused him to soar in the
  popular estimation.</p>

  <p>"Is it a public funeral?" asked some one.</p>

  <p>"No, strictly private. Only, if friends showed up, she'd naturally
  appreciate it."</p>

  <p>"Flowers?"</p>

  <p>Puggie looked doubtful as he scratched a pimple with a long patrician
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Flowers?" he repeated. "Well, it's like this. The widow wanted none. But
  he felt it would help the florists. You know what a chap he was for thinking
  of others."</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;he <i>knew</i>?" asked a woman huskily.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Puggie gulped in sympathy. "We couldn't fool him. He knew he was
  passing on. Conscious to the last."</p>

  <p>To change a painful subject, the matron of the white violets asked about
  future plans.</p>

  <p>"Will Mrs. Baxter be staying on here?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Puggie, "definitely not. The mere thought of what she bumped
  into here would make her shudder. She may stay out her quarter...Well, I must
  be moving."</p>

  <p>He saluted gravely and passed on his way to the undertaker's, where he
  stated his requirements.</p>

  <p>"I've brought Mr. Baxter's measurements, because Mrs. Baxter can't bear to
  hear the men coming, until&mdash;until they've <i>got</i> to. How soon can
  you knock up a rough shell?"</p>

  <p>"I've one in stock which might do at a pinch," replied the undertaker.
  "There's so much illness that we have to be prepared."</p>

  <p>"Good," nodded Puggie. "Send it up to-morrow morning at twelve. And send
  the coffin one-thirty, sharp, the next day. I want the funeral to be two
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>As he left the arrangements entirely to the taste and discretion of the
  undertaker, the remainder of the short interview was satisfactory to
  both.</p>

  <p>"You understand," he said, as he left the shop, "plain, but good. And no
  one's to come mucking round. If you want to know anything, ring me. I'll be
  in all day to-morrow...And now, I've got to flag the vicar."</p>

  <p>After he had left the Vicarage, there were still visits to be paid, so
  that some time elapsed before he returned to Jasmine Cottage, where Vera met
  him in the passage.</p>

  <p>There was no hint of the distracted widow in her appearance. She looked
  smart as paint in a very becoming black frock, which was not mourning, since
  she had been wearing it all the winter. It suited her fair colouring
  remarkably well. Her lips were tinted coral, and exactly matched her
  cigarette-holder.</p>

  <p>Her small face, however, grew sharp with worry as she listened to Puggie's
  recital, and when she spoke, her voice grated like a saw.</p>

  <p>"You fool. Why didn't you say 'no flowers'? We shall have people messing
  round here."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of poor Charlie," remarked Puggie quietly. "It's a
  compliment to him. After all, Vera, it's his due."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so." Vera shrugged. "But, Puggie, what possessed the idiot to
  promise the girl a fiver? Where am I to find one? Growing on a lamppost?"</p>

  <p>Puggie patted her thin shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, old girl," he advised. "Take one fence at a time."</p>

  <p>Later on, additional details of the death at Jasmine Cottage were
  circulated, when the maid&mdash;Minnie Reed&mdash;was seen walking about the
  town, dressed in her best clothes.</p>

  <p>"I've got a week's holiday," she explained. "The mistress was wonderful
  right up to the time of the master's death, and then she went to bits and
  screamed to leave her alone with <i>him.</i> After all I done, she swept me
  out of the house like so much rubbish."</p>

  <p>It was plain that the maid considered that she had been cheated out of a
  sensational experience, although she admitted that she was allowed to wish
  her master "Good-bye."</p>

  <p>She made the most of that.</p>

  <p>"They called me into the room just before the end. He was sinking fast.
  His face looked like wax and his hands were cold as ice. He shook hands with
  me, but he couldn't speak, only whisper. He said, 'Good-bye, Minnie, and
  thank you for all your kindness to me. I didn't know you when I made my Will,
  but your mistress will give you five pounds to remember me.'"</p>

  <p>Among others who heard of Charlie Baxter's death was a schoolgirl who was
  home for the Christmas holidays. She was a wholesome, athletic youngster of
  sixteen, in the pudding-face stage, but with promise of attraction. She had
  only two ambitions&mdash;to pass the Senior Cambridge and to enter for the
  Junior Golf Championship.</p>

  <p>When she was going to the Library one wet afternoon for her mother, she
  dropped the book in the road. Charlie Baxter, who was passing at the time,
  picked it up and wiped off the flecks of mud with his clean handkerchief.</p>

  <p>The courtly gesture left the girl gaping with astonishment. She was
  inarticulate when he carried the book for her to the Library. On the way he
  complimented her on the goal she had shot at a recent Ladies' Hockey Match,
  and discussed the game in general, and her form in particular.</p>

  <p>The girl went home feeling that every cell in her body had been subjected
  to a chemical change. For the first time she experienced the chaotic upheaval
  of Nature. Hitherto she had been a boy, and would have been murderous to a
  Constant Nymph on the hockey field.</p>

  <p>For about a week she hugged her secret as she rubbed Pond's cold cream
  into her face at night, and went to soppy, sentimental pictures. She
  idealised Charlie to a knight of King Arthur's Court. And then, in the midst
  of her dawning rapture, she heard of his death.</p>

  <p>She was having afternoon-tea in the drawing-room, and she went on munching
  quantities of hot crumpet, without comment or show of emotion. The strength
  of her self-consciousness compelled her to hide her feelings. No one must
  know of her still-born romance.</p>

  <p>But as the truth gradually hit home she felt she could not endure the ache
  in her heart and the bitter sense of loss. Gulping down her last cup of tea
  she rushed up to her small room at the top of the house.</p>

  <p>Regardless of cold, she stood for a long time at her open window, staring
  down at the huddle of roofs, piebald with patches of semi-melted snow. The
  blanched hills, the leaden sky, and the fading light all suggested the
  hopeless twilight of a life without love.</p>

  <p>At a sudden memory of a dark bearded face, with liquid brown eyes, and the
  gleam of strong white teeth displayed in a smile, a lump rose in her throat
  which nearly choked her. She reminded herself that she was only sixteen and
  had to endure a life-sentence of loneliness and grief.</p>

  <p>The burden of her sorrow was too great for her to bear. Since she had gone
  away to boarding-school she had given up her childish custom of saying
  prayers in public, although she often murmured petitions under the
  sheets.</p>

  <p>But now she dropped on her knees, and with tears streaming down her
  cheeks, put out her soul in a frantic prayer for the unattainable.</p>

  <p>"God, give him back to me. Let him be alive now. Don't let him be
  dead."</p>

  <p>It is said that faith will remove mountains. Yet this
  schoolgirl&mdash;without a scrap of faith&mdash;apparently achieved the
  impossible, and worked a major miracle.</p>

  <p>Even as she sobbed out her petition, Charlie Baxter was sitting in the
  kitchen at Jasmine Cottage, smoking his pipe.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; BEGINNER'S LUCK</h2>

  <p class="first">THE first time he died, Charlie Baxter was genuinely touched
  by the signs of his popularity. He had an inferiority complex&mdash;the
  result of being avoided by the nice girls in his home town in his youth. He
  was also generally in disgrace with his family, because of the regularity
  with which he changed his plans for the future.</p>

  <p>In turn, it was arranged that he should be a doctor, a lawyer, an
  auctioneer. In fact, his only objection to any reputable profession was the
  system of examination before qualification.</p>

  <p>He had discovered, however, other ways of making money&mdash;and losing
  it&mdash;besides earning a salary. He went to horse-races and the dogs.
  Besides this, he was not too proud to turn his hand to anything, and when he
  lacked a shilling to buy fags, would enter the Children's Competition in the
  newspapers.</p>

  <p>In spite of snubs and neglect he retained a real affection for his home,
  and always came back when his funds ran out. He never received a welcome, but
  he remained cheerful, amiable, and quite a charming fellow.</p>

  <p>The Baxters had one rich relative&mdash;a widowed aunt&mdash;whom Charlie
  cultivated. At her death, the family was astonished to learn that their black
  sheep was the sole member to receive a legacy. He promptly married
  Vera&mdash;a pretty blonde, who made what might truthfully be described as "a
  personal appearance"&mdash;at some Vanities.</p>

  <p>She was a sensible moral little person, and much too good for Charlie; but
  the Baxters, who were snobs, could not accept her as a member of a family
  which wore rather more than the average quantity of clothing. Once again the
  front door was closed upon Charlie. He left the town, and this time he did
  not return.</p>

  <p>While their money lasted, the young Baxters had a riotous time. They went
  to the Riviera and cut a modest dash. Vera was a genuine actress, and had the
  power of dramatising herself until she lost her sense of reality. The world
  was her Stage and she played a Star part. In their theatrical surroundings of
  blue sea, palms and gilt-cane chairs, she became an Oppenheim adventuress,
  and she wore big furs and draped herself with ropes of cheap pearls.</p>

  <p>But, deep down below her trimmings, she remained the thrifty, honest
  little soul who took off more and more, as she earned less and less, in order
  to pay her landlady. She often wished that she had insisted on being keeper
  of the purse, when she would have combined economy with security.</p>

  <p>They got to know some curious people&mdash;Puggie Williams among the rest.
  It was he who suggested the insurance fraud, when they were within sight of
  their legacy's end. He was living on them at the time, so he sold his brains
  on the understanding that they should pool interests.</p>

  <p>Following his advice, they moved to a small country town, where living was
  cheap&mdash;rented a furnished cottage from a certain Major
  Blake&mdash;budgetted within the limits of a modest income&mdash;and posed as
  people of leisure, refined tastes and means, who wished to live a quiet
  life.</p>

  <p>Puggie Williams had instructed Charlie not to approach an insurance agent,
  but let the agent come to him.</p>

  <p>"Be a good mixer," was his advice.</p>

  <p>True to his forecast, a Mr. Acorn, who was local agent for an important
  insurance company, rose to the occasion, when Charlie, during a round of
  golf, admitted that he was not insured. Before long he contracted for annual
  payments of eighty pounds, so that his widow might receive the sum of five
  thousand pounds at his death.</p>

  <p>He paid two instalments&mdash;and then he died.</p>

  <p>They had beginner's luck in the matter, for in Dubarry they found an ideal
  doctor to gull. He had inherited a small fortune, and now only visited an old
  lady or two, who clung to him like limpets, because of his charming bedside
  manner.</p>

  <p>Vera did her utmost to captivate him. She sent for him in an alleged case
  of nervous prostration&mdash;or something equally picturesque in stage
  production&mdash;when he was called upon to do a little more than feel her
  pulse and be discreetly appreciative of her charming creamy ostrich-feather
  negligée.</p>

  <p>It was natural, therefore, after her own recovery from illness, that Vera
  should swear that he was the only doctor in whom she could have
  confidence.</p>

  <p>They waited impatiently for the sensational epidemic of flu, when doctors
  were run off their legs and nurses not to be had for love or money. Their
  chief danger was that Dr. Dubarry would not remain in England, for it was the
  time of the year when he always went to the Riviera.</p>

  <p>Just as he was on the point of departure, Vera made her tearful appeal.
  She was distracted; Charlie had flu, and he was the one man who could pull
  her husband through.</p>

  <p>Dr. Dubarry stayed, against his will, compelled by Vera's concealed
  strength of character. He came daily to Jasmine Cottage, where he saw a
  little of the patient and quite a lot of Vera. He had not opened a medical
  journal for years, but he could judge the case by the symptoms, as described
  by Charlie, and the evidence of the thermometer.</p>

  <p>He did not notice that when Charlie was "smoking" it was always the minute
  when Vera drew away his attention from the bedside. Charlie's scraps of
  knowledge, gleaned as a medical student, had taught him that somewhat
  difficult feat for a lay eye&mdash;how to read the mercury at a glance. He
  had also experimented as to the exact length of time he should keep the
  thermometer buried in the hot baked potato under his pillow, to get desired
  results.</p>

  <p>He knew how to tell the tale, and presently he ran a high temperature,
  which soared to a peak when Dr. Dubarry looked grave. He hinted at a second
  opinion and a hospital nurse. But Vera sobbed that she trusted him implicitly
  and that she could not bear to leave her husband to the mercies of any
  stranger.</p>

  <p>Dr. Dubarry yielded, partly because it was difficult to get a second
  doctor and nurse. After all, it was a straight case, without complications,
  and Charlie was receiving the orthodox treatment.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the plotters were anxiously awaiting for the snow which had
  been predicted by the weather experts. The instant the first flakes fell,
  Charlie's temperature shot up like a rocket and then took a sensational
  nose-dive, while his heart was weak and fluttering after stiff doses of
  tobacco-ash mixed with tea.</p>

  <p>Dr. Dubarry felt it was his painful duty to warn the poor little woman of
  the danger. He broke the news to her that unless Charlie's strength could be
  maintained, he might flicker out of life.</p>

  <p>"He's not putting up a fight," he complained. "You'd think he was just
  letting himself go."</p>

  <p>Vera broke down and sobbed on Dr. Dubarry's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Oh, doctor," she cried, "that <i>is</i> Charlie. I know the best of him.
  And the worst of him. And I love him for all...But he never could make an
  effort."</p>

  <p>That night the snow fell thickly. In the morning Dr. Dubarry, who lived in
  the heart of the country, looked out on a white muffled landscape. While he
  was dressing he was called to the telephone, when Puggie Williams, speaking
  in a voice choked with emotion, told him that poor Baxter had passed away
  during the night. In view of the terrible weather they had not sent for the
  doctor, since nothing could be done.</p>

  <p>Dr. Dubarry thanked them for their thoughtfulness in not dragging him from
  his warm bed, just to tell them what they already knew. He also offered
  heroically to come over immediately.</p>

  <p>But Williams would not accept the sacrifice. The roads were too awful, and
  Mrs. Baxter would not hear of it.</p>

  <p>"She says you'll be the next to go down with flu, and she would never
  forgive herself if anything happened to you. If you don't mind sending round
  the Certificate&mdash;that should meet the case."</p>

  <p>Dr. Dubarry hesitated...At the other end of the line the three plotters
  held their breath. If he decided to come, or to deputise another doctor, they
  would have to stage a sensational revival of the corpse and face the collapse
  of their carefully laid plans.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for them, Dubarry was both soft and nervous. Common sense
  assured him that it was a straight case which had run true to type and that
  the collapse was practically inevitable.</p>

  <p>Instead of taking a long cross-country drive into Starminster and running
  the risk of being blocked by a snowdrift, he could motor by the main road to
  the nearest large town and take the first express to London. It was true that
  he could also reach Starminster by the same method&mdash;but the Blue Coast
  was calling him.</p>

  <p>He looked again at the Arctic scenery and the slowly falling flakes, like
  black pompons against the sky, and he decided that it was his duty to his
  wife and family not to risk his own valuable life.</p>

  <p>So he followed the sun, and the death certificate was sent to Jasmine
  Cottage by special messenger. With its arrival Charlie Baxter became
  officially dead.</p>

  <p>Vera and Puggie shook hands after the front door was closed.</p>

  <p>"We've won," declared Vera jubilantly.</p>

  <p>But Puggie looked grave.</p>

  <p>"We're only beginning," he told her. "So far, we've had the usual
  beginner's luck. <i>Now</i>&mdash;for the snags."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; THE FIRST FENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">EVEN while Charlie smoked his pipe and stretched his feet
  blissfully to the open front of the Ideal stove, the first snag was on its
  way. He heard the bell, and then a prolonged murmur of voices. Presently the
  front door was shut again, and Puggie Williams came into the kitchen carrying
  a wreath.</p>

  <p>He pitched it on to the table and then sank into a chair and mopped his
  brow.</p>

  <p>"Hullo," he said. "You? Has Vera let you off the chain?"</p>

  <p>"I came down a few minutes ago," explained Charlie. "As I pay the rent, I
  did not ask for permission."</p>

  <p>"Don't blame you, old chap. But I shall go bughouse before we're through.
  D'you know who that was? The Vicar. And he wanted to
  see&mdash;<i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>"M&mdash;me?" stammered Charlie. "Doesn't he know I'm dead?"</p>

  <p>"That's just it. He wanted to kneel by your corpse and say a prayer for
  your soul."</p>

  <p>Charlie's brown eyes grew suspiciously moist.</p>

  <p>"That was really kind. I&mdash;I appreciate it. Did you thank him
  properly?"</p>

  <p>"No, I took a strong line. I said you were chockful of poison. You can
  guess the rest." Puggie took out his notebook and scrawled 'Disinfectant.'
  "Sorry to be indelicate, old chap, but we've <i>got</i> to keep people from
  nosing round. Besides, it will help to explain the snap funeral."</p>

  <p>Charlie was not listening; he appeared to be unconscious of the indignity
  of Puggie's proposal as well as the peril of their position. His eyes were
  those of a dog who sees a packet of his biscuits in the shopping-basket, as
  he picked up the wreath.</p>

  <p>"For <i>me</i>?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. From the Mayor."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I <i>say.</i> Roses, this time of year. Those cost something. People
  must think a lot of me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you seem to have been a success."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what they were saying about me."</p>

  <p>He listened eagerly as Puggie obligingly racked his memory. When the
  recital ran dry, he nodded and then frowned.</p>

  <p>"You can't judge a man till he's dead," he said. "I'd like my family to
  have heard some of that. But why did the Colonel say I was a little sportsman
  and gentleman? Where did he get the 'little'? I'm taller than&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off as the door was flung open and Vera came into the kitchen.
  Her eyes grew hard at the sight of her husband.</p>

  <p>"You fool," she cried. "What possessed you to come down here?"</p>

  <p>"I was so cold in the attic," explained Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Corpses <i>are</i> cold," Puggie reminded him. "'Oh, ain't it grand to be
  blooming well dead'?"</p>

  <p>Vera's nerves were on edge, so she continued to scold.</p>

  <p>"You must be mad. Suppose some one had come in."</p>

  <p>"I only wanted to get warm," pleaded Charlie.</p>

  <p>"You've got a hot-water bottle and a rug."</p>

  <p>"But I can see my breath in the attic. Why can't I have the stove?"</p>

  <p>"The oil might smell. People might wonder why we were using the lumber
  room. Don't you <i>understand</i>? Nothing must be out of the ordinary. We
  don't want to start people thinking."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I understand. I'll go back the instant I'm thawed. But&mdash;when I
  was sitting, all alone, in the dark and cold, I kept thinking of hot toast
  and tea."</p>

  <p>His eyes were those of an appealing dog, but they had no effect on Vera.
  She ran her fingers through the waves of her fair hair and turned upon her
  husband.</p>

  <p>"And who's going to make toast for you? You know the girl has gone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I've often made it for you. At a pinch, I might make some for
  myself."</p>

  <p>"No." Vera's voice was shrill. "You'll go back to the attic. I'm about fed
  up with you. We have all the worry and planning and suspense. All you have to
  do is stay put. <i>Listen.</i> You've jolly well <i>got</i> to be
  uncomfortable. It's not for long. And it's worth it."</p>

  <p>Puggie listened with a cynical smile. Because he admired Vera, he had
  sufficient natural jealousy to enjoy her husband's discomfiture. At the same
  time his masculine instinct made him resent female domination of the male.
  His sympathies were with Charlie, as he rose dejectedly from the
  easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"All right. I'll go upstairs now," he said.</p>

  <p>At that moment the bell rang loudly, making them all jump nervously.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are, you fool," whispered Vera fiercely, gripping her
  husband's arm. "You'll be seen going upstairs."</p>

  <p>The bell rang again. Evidently the caller was not used to be kept
  waiting.</p>

  <p>"Answer it at once, Puggie," commanded Vera.</p>

  <p>"Very good, m'lady," saluted Puggie.</p>

  <p>Straining their ears, Charlie and Vera heard a high-pitched, clear voice,
  which informed them that the great lady of the neighbourhood had done them
  the honour to stop her impressive car outside Jasmine Cottage.</p>

  <p>"I don't know Mrs. Baxter," explained her ladyship, "but please convey my
  deepest sympathy. Such a charming little man. What was it?...Really?...Oh,
  dear, dear. I always thought he looked delicate. These artistic temperaments
  need a great deal of care. They just flicker out."</p>

  <p>"Yes," chimed in a girl's voice. "You could tell he was sensitive and
  sympathetic just by dancing with him. He knew, by instinct, what you were
  going to do, before you did it."</p>

  <p>They left cards and the car rolled away.</p>

  <p>"Probably the poor little man was neglected by that horrid little blonde,"
  remarked her ladyship to her daughter as Puggie returned to the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"Lady Warren and her fat daughter, in their glad rags," he announced with
  a grin. "On their way to dine out or something. Both very distressed,
  especially the girl."</p>

  <p>"I gave her a dance at the Hospital Ball," explained Charlie. "It was like
  trying to control a runaway traction engine. But I was so sorry for her.
  Didn't they bring any flowers for me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. They have only acres of grass. Coast's clear now, Charlie.
  Cut."</p>

  <p>"No," decided Vera suddenly. "Now he's here, he'd better have his tea to
  warm him up."</p>

  <p>A slight smile flickered round Charlie's lips as he watched his blonde
  beauty whisking round the kitchen. With quick capable movements, she cut
  bread and filled the kettle.</p>

  <p>"You won't forget to feed the birds to-morrow morning?" he reminded her.
  "I'm like Mussolini&mdash;fond of birds."</p>

  <p>Vera paid no attention to him. Her small face was a map of lines when,
  presently, she brought him his toast.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, sweetheart," she said.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I'd like to smoke too."</p>

  <p>She brought him a cigarette and lit it for him. As he blew rings of smoke,
  in a little cold bedroom, a frantic schoolgirl was still on her knees.</p>

  <p>"Let him be alive," she murmured at intervals, for she was growing
  exhausted by her grief.</p>

  <p>Charlie's eyes were tranquil as he watched the fire.</p>

  <p>"When I come into my money, I shall give away more to the poor," he said.
  "You need to be cold and hungry oneself, to understand the sufferings of
  others."</p>

  <p>"You didn't give away a cent last time," Vera reminded him.</p>

  <p>Charlie changed the subject quickly.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you having tea?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>She shook her head as she lit a cigarette from the stump of her old
  one.</p>

  <p>"I'm too worried," she said.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because it's all been so easy. In fact it's been too easy. What have we
  forgotten?"</p>

  <p>She turned to Puggie.</p>

  <p>"What exactly did the man tell you?" she demanded. "<i>Think</i>."</p>

  <p>Puggie wrinkled his brow in an effort at concentration, while Charlie,
  with implicit confidence in his companions, sipped his tea and warmed his
  knees.</p>

  <p>"I got the dope," said Puggie, "from a chap&mdash;awfully decent
  fellow&mdash;I met him on a Cape liner. For once in my life I wasn't in the
  steerage. He was in Insurance. When I asked him exactly how easy it would be
  to cheat a big company he told me quite a lot."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;he said the company would expect reasonable proof of death.
  That meant you had to produce the death certificate, the burial
  certificate&mdash;that would depend&mdash;and birth certificate, to prove the
  age, if it hadn't been already seen by the company when the man insured his
  life..."</p>

  <p>"That's all right with us," remarked Vera. "What were the snags?"</p>

  <p>"According to this chap it would be the doctor, the undertaker, servants,
  relatives, friends, and creditors."</p>

  <p>Vera began to check the list.</p>

  <p>"Doctor. We've settled him. Undertaker. We'll take care of him too. We
  sent the girl away, and he hasn't any friends or creditors here. That only
  leaves his family."</p>

  <p>"I have no family," Charlie told her. "I had to choose between them and
  you. And I choose my wife."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, sweetheart. Puggie, his family's got to be told of his death,
  but they mustn't get the letter until it's too late for them to come to the
  funeral."</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't raise the fare for me," said Charlie bitterly. "They always
  booted me out when I came home."</p>

  <p>"If they come down here before he's buried," went on Vera, "we'd be sunk.
  But we must write <i>at once</i> or it might look queer. We can't get them
  suspicious and asking for exhumation. <i>Think</i>, both of you. What are we
  to do?"</p>

  <p>In the end she found her own solution.</p>

  <p>"I know. They've moved since your father's death, haven't they?"</p>

  <p>"Twice," replied Charlie. "Once to a small house, and then to a flat."</p>

  <p>"That's luck again. We'll send it to the old address. I'm not supposed to
  know anything about their movements as they've never written to me."</p>

  <p>"But doesn't the Post Office send on letters?" objected Puggie.</p>

  <p>"Only for a certain time. And if you move again too soon, they expect the
  letters to be forwarded on from the second address, or something like that.
  There's bound to be some delay, if it's only a day. You must write this
  instant, Puggie."</p>

  <p>"Righto," grunted Puggie. "I'll say you're prostituted. Here, steady
  on."</p>

  <p>He pushed Charlie back into his chair, just as he was rising&mdash;his
  face flushed and his fists clenched.</p>

  <p>"You've insulted my wife," he shouted. "My wife's a good woman. She's
  married."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dry up," said Vera, although her eyes glittered as she looked at
  Puggie. "He was only trying to say 'prostrated.' It only proves he went to
  Eton after all."</p>

  <p>"Did you?" asked Charlie, staring curiously at the man of mystery.</p>

  <p>"No, night-school...Very sorry and all that."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't be funny again." His anger forgotten, Charlie rubbed his chin
  and suddenly smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'll be getting rid of this bush to-morrow," he gloated. "Won't I be glad
  to see my old face again?"</p>

  <p>"More than I am to see mine," said Puggie. "When I was the young lord of
  the manor, I had one of those bucolic complexions, all pink and white, like
  streaky bacon."</p>

  <p>"Puggie, <i>who</i> are you?" asked Vera.</p>

  <p>"Haven't I told you? Well, since we're all emotional, to-night, over this
  death, I'll tell you&mdash;in strict confidence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That you're one of <i>the</i> Smiths of London," finished Vera
  derisively.</p>

  <p>Even as she laughed her grin was frozen to a grimace.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Puggie.</p>

  <p>"We've made the most ghastly blunder," she told him. "Charlie's beard has
  just reminded me of what we've forgotten."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V. &mdash; CORPSE-CANDLES</h2>

  <p class="first">AS the men stared at her, Vera struck her head
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Idiot," she cried. "And it's too late now to do anything about it. Two
  years too late." She pointed to Charlie as she added, "He should never have
  come here with a beard. He should have grown it <i>afterwards</i>, up in
  London, as a disguise."</p>

  <p>Charlie set his lips stubbornly. He had been firm on the point that he was
  not going through his second life as a bearded daddy.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind growing the horrible thing for Starminster," he had
  compromised. "That means that for two years I shall shudder whenever I look
  at myself in the glass. But the instant I'm 'dead' off it comes."</p>

  <p>At the time they had seen no flaw in his objection. Even Vera had not
  realised its exact significance until they had reached the critical stages of
  their fraud.</p>

  <p>"Don't you <i>see</i>?" she asked, infuriated by their blank faces. "When
  he shaves off that beard he will probably fool any one here, if they knocked
  against him by chance in London. He may look quite a different person to
  them. But he will also be his old self again. His family will be sure to put
  his death in the local paper. Well, suppose he meets any one who knew him at
  home? What about it then?"</p>

  <p>"They'll only think it a striking likeness," remarked Puggie. "You may
  stare at a man who sits opposite to you on the Underground, but you wouldn't
  tap him on the shoulder and say, 'Aren't you John Jones who died last year?'
  Besides, Charlie's older now. He'll have changed."</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't," put in Charlie eagerly. "When I was having my medical
  examination for the insurance, the doctor said he'd never seen a younger man
  for my age."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you'd remember that," remarked Vera bitterly. "It's the only
  examination you ever passed. But you needn't be so perky. Get this,
  sweetheart. This isn't a beauty contest. If anything crops up to stop us now,
  you'll <i>starve</i>."</p>

  <p>"I could work," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"So you've actually heard of that funny thing? Don't believe all they tell
  you, honey. And as you've never tried it, we'll wash it out...The question
  is&mdash;how are we to alter you now?"</p>

  <p>She lit another cigarette and paced the kitchen's uneven stone flags on
  perilously high Spanish heels. As usual, the men left her to deal with the
  problem as they watched her expectantly.</p>

  <p>They were not disappointed in their faith, for, presently she pitched away
  the stump of her cigarette with a laugh. Crossing to the dresser, she opened
  a drawer and found a spectacle-case.</p>

  <p>"Try these on," she commanded her husband. "They're the glasses I wore on
  my cruise. They're only slightly tinted. Anyway I got off with every man on
  the ship, in spite of them."</p>

  <p>Charlie was boyishly delighted with his appearance when he looked at
  himself in the small glass on the wall.</p>

  <p>"I look intellectual," he said. "Rather like a writer." He turned to Vera.
  "How do you like your literary husband?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't one," she replied. "Thank heaven I'm a widow. I'm sick of
  men."</p>

  <p>"W&mdash;What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"She means," explained Puggie with a grin, "that she married a bloke
  called Charlie Baxter. And the poor chap passed out, last night."</p>

  <p>He was dead. It was not a pleasant thought for Charlie to take with him to
  bed. For the matter of that, their present lodging was more picturesque than
  cheerful. It was a smallish, inconvenient building, composed of two cottages
  knocked into one, and had tiny rooms, narrow twisting stairs, and flagged
  stone passages. Its only concessions to modern luxury were the Ideal stove in
  the kitchen and a bathroom.</p>

  <p>Vera's precautions were not unnecessary, for most sounds could be heard
  all over the house, including some noises which had no apparent origin. Lying
  awake that night, Charlie listened to people&mdash;who were not
  there&mdash;creeping up the stairs and whispering in corners.</p>

  <p>He had no company, for he still occupied the cold death-chamber, while
  Vera preferred to stay in the dressing-room, which she had made comfortable
  with her belongings. Strung up to a pitch of nervous excitement, he could not
  sleep because of the thought of to-morrow's ordeal.</p>

  <p>He had to pose as a corpse. Vera had assured him that it should be only a
  matter of moments, but that it was essential to fool the undertaker. What he
  dreaded was some treachery on the part of Nature&mdash;an uncontrollable
  shiver or sneeze.</p>

  <p>Vera had rubbed into him the consequences of any slip. It was prison.</p>

  <p>"That's a place," explained Puggie, "where they make you take a bath, but
  there aren't any bath-salts. And if you don't fancy the French cooking it's
  no good complaining to the waitress. Not a bit your style, Charlie."</p>

  <p>Charlie thought about prison, the following morning, as he lay on the bed
  in rigid state. He was cold, hungry, and uncomfortable after lengthy and
  complicated preparations. Vera had made him up with utmost skill, and had
  arranged the lighting with real stage artistry.</p>

  <p>"You look wonderful," she said after she had finished. "Puggie, come here
  and see him. It's a mercy, after all, he has a beard to cover up his lips.
  They'd be first to betray him."</p>

  <p>Puggie regarded him with critical eyes.</p>

  <p>"He's smoking," he said.</p>

  <p>Vera bit off a curse. The cold was still intense, and she had not
  attempted to warm the room by lighting a fire. She told her husband he had to
  lump it. Her chief concern was to keep his corpse-complexion in a state of
  cold-storage.</p>

  <p>She looked in dismay at the faint wisps of vapour that issued from
  Charlie's nostrils and lips.</p>

  <p>"While the undertaker's in the room you must just hold your breath," she
  told him.</p>

  <p>"But I shall choke."</p>

  <p>"You <i>dare.</i> Don't be a fool. Conquer your nerves."</p>

  <p>All the same she opened a drawer and drew out a large linen handkerchief,
  which she placed on the bed.</p>

  <p>"Cover his face with this, the instant the undertaker has had his
  professional peek," she ordered Puggie. "Whatever you do, don't forget. And
  don't slip up on <i>anything.</i> That goes for both of you. I only wish I
  could do it all. I can trust no one but myself."</p>

  <p>From bitter personal experience Vera had no use for men.</p>

  <p>"Won't you be here?" asked Charlie, his eyes appealing to the little wisp
  of a woman for the protection of her presence.</p>

  <p>"No, honey. I'll be heard, not seen."</p>

  <p>The actress in Vera was already exulting in an effective part. Her one
  regret was that she could not double it with that of the corpse. Then she
  looked at her wrist-watch.</p>

  <p>"It's close on twelve. The shell ought to be here any minute now...Come
  outside, Puggie."</p>

  <p>They went out of the room, closing the door after them. There was
  something stealthy in their exit which stirred up all the latent distrust in
  Charlie. During the last few days, he could not rid his mind of a suspicion
  that he was being duped.</p>

  <p>He was positive that there was some understanding between them. Although
  he was friendly to him, Puggie resented Charlie because he was Vera's
  husband. He would not have married her while she was in the Vanities. Charlie
  still felt furious as he remembered the libellous word "prostituted." He had
  done Puggie's preliminary work for him; and now that he had made a
  respectable wife into a respectable widow, all objections to her would be
  removed.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be getting the worst of the bargain. The nonsense verses by
  Lewis Carroll, which his eldest sister Emily used to read to him when he was
  a small boy, floated into his head:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"I passed by his garden and marked, with one eye,<br>
  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie.<br>
  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,<br>
  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat."</p><br>

  <p>The words applied to himself only too well. He was the Owl. Vera and
  Puggie had treated him like a lay-figure; they had laughed and whispered in
  corners, while he had to endure ignominious treatment and suffer real
  discomforts.</p>

  <p>And now he was completely in their power&mdash;officially dead.</p>

  <p>He did not like being dead; he had too much imagination where his own
  feelings were concerned. The cold, the rigidity, the smell of disinfectant
  fighting the perfume of forced lilies-of-the-valley, utterly revolted
  him.</p>

  <p>To increase his physical and mental discomfiture, he was powerless. They
  had bound his limbs tightly to his body, in order to give his shape the
  necessary stiff outline under the sheet. Under the influence of fright, his
  heart had begun to flutter badly, for he had taken some stiff doses of
  tobacco-ash in tea, when he was faking his collapse.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he remembered Lady Warren's words&mdash;that his kind "flickered
  out of life." Since his medical examination he might have developed some
  disease. If he caught a chill in this Arctic temperature and died, the other
  two would be on velvet. All they needed for perfect immunity was to produce a
  real corpse.</p>

  <p>He began to wonder whether the undertaker was coming that morning, in
  reality. It was now some time past twelve. This masquerade might be some deep
  scheme to reduce his powers of resistance.</p>

  <p>His large eyes grew wider with panic. He was about to try and roll off the
  bed when he heard voices outside the window, followed by a ring at the front
  door. At the sounds his heart began to hammer; his suspicion of Vera had been
  slain, only to leave him facing the real peril.</p>

  <p>He listened to scuffling footsteps on the stairs, and a horribly
  suggestive bumping against the balustrade and wall, at every corner, as if
  something was being carried up to the first floor.</p>

  <p>"Quiet, you chaps." Puggie spoke to the men in a hoarse whisper. "Don't
  let Mrs. Baxter hear you."</p>

  <p>Apparently, however, the widow knew all about it, for from the next room
  came the sound of strangled heart-broken sobs. Then Charlie heard Puggie's
  voice&mdash;suddenly loud and distinct&mdash;close to him.</p>

  <p>"Put the trestles here. Foot of the bed. <i>That's</i> right."</p>

  <p>Charlie held his breath for what was to seem an eternity, as he realised
  that the undertaker and his assistants were now inside the room. Their eyes
  would, naturally, be focused upon him.</p>

  <p>As he crossed the threshold, Mr. Brown, the undertaker, looked around him.
  Heavy curtains were drawn over the windows, so that the only light came from
  four candles&mdash;one at each corner of the bed. In this dim illumination,
  he could just see the waxen forehead and nose of the late Charles Baxter. His
  beard hid the rest of his face.</p>

  <p>He noticed, too, with professional disapproval, that although the bed was
  strewn with flowers, there were none covering the heart of the corpse, while
  his hands were hidden.</p>

  <p>"He looks very well," he said.</p>

  <p>"<i>Well</i>?" echoed Puggie in a horrified voice. "What d'you mean?"</p>

  <p>"He makes a fine corpse," explained the undertaker. "He looks bigger
  altogether. More dignity. I was astonished when you gave me his measurements.
  I always thought of him as a&mdash;slight gentleman."</p>

  <p>He beckoned to his men. Just as they were advancing towards the bed,
  Puggie saw, to his horror, a faint wisp of vapour curling from Charlie's
  lips.</p>

  <p>In that moment he lost his head completely. He looked around desperately
  for the handkerchief, failed to find it, and grabbed the nearest
  object&mdash;a sheet of tissue-paper which had covered a wreath.</p>

  <p>"Fly," he explained, as he laid it upon the waxen face, before he waved
  back the men.</p>

  <p>"No, don't touch the poor chap. This is my job. The widow doesn't want any
  hands to touch him but ours."</p>

  <p>"But can you manage?" objected the undertaker.</p>

  <p>"On my head. He's badly wasted, poor fellow. And the widow will help me
  with the feet."</p>

  <p>Almost as though an actress were awaiting her cue, the pitiful, muffled
  weeping broke out again on the other side of the wall.</p>

  <p>The undertaker looked his sympathy.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said.</p>

  <p>He beckoned to his men, who tiptoed from the room. Feeling elated now that
  the danger was over, Puggie turned confidentially to the undertaker.</p>

  <p>"He won't be the first chap I've put to bed," he said, "especially after a
  Regimental reunion dinner."</p>

  <p>"Do you still go to them?" asked the undertaker.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't miss them. They're the only decent chaps left."</p>

  <p>"Um, um. What regiment were you in?"</p>

  <p>To Charlie's horror, the men began to chat. In a corner of his brain,
  Puggie had the fuddled impression that he was doing a clever thing,
  calculated to remove any shadow of suspicion that he had anything to hide. He
  told himself that they were safe as houses, now that he had covered Charlie's
  face.</p>

  <p>What he did not realise was that he had done the thing best calculated to
  precipitate disaster. The flimsy sheet of paper was sucked in with every gasp
  that Charlie was forced to give. As he broke out into a violent sweat, he
  could feel it growing limp and moulding his features like a wet veil.</p>

  <p>Every second his agony of mind increased. He remembered an experience at
  the dentist's, when an impression of his mouth was taken for a denture. The
  composition had seemed to swell until he believed that his air-passages were
  completely sealed, and he had fought and choked himself black in the
  face.</p>

  <p>Now the same symptoms of suffocation were rushing upon him. A preliminary
  tickling in his throat told him that he could not hold out much longer.
  Already his lungs were nearly cracking under the strain of holding his
  breath.</p>

  <p>As he waited for the end, his mind painted a picture of prison in the
  darkest hues. Hideous, coarse garments. A cement bath, filled with tepid,
  greyish water, which had been sampled by others. Water-gruel and stale
  bread.</p>

  <p>Imagination threw in additional horrors&mdash;rats which ran over him, and
  insects&mdash;not the festive species, which frisked and flitted&mdash;but
  horrible adhesive plasters on the wall.</p>

  <p>At the thought, he reached breaking-point. The irritation in his throat
  curdled to a hard lump. He swallowed violently to try to remove the
  obstruction&mdash;in vain.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, to his horror, his strangled breath rebelled and burst out in a
  choking wheeze.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI. &mdash; THE VISITOR</h2>

  <p class="first">FEELING that the game was up, Charlie was on the point of
  opening his eyes when Puggie's paralysed brain was jolted into action. He
  clapped his hands and made vigorous passes in the shadow.</p>

  <p>"Skit, skit," he cried.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to the undertaker.</p>

  <p>"That cat got in again," he explained. "It was a great pet of the poor
  chap. He was passionately fond of animals, you know. If you don't mind coming
  out, we'll close the door."</p>

  <p>"But are you sure it's not still in the room?" asked the undertaker. "We'd
  better make certain."</p>

  <p>"No, I saw it streak down the stairs."</p>

  <p>The door had barely closed on the two men when Charlie realised that the
  danger was not over. Once again he felt as though the back of his throat were
  being tickled with a feather. He panted and gulped alternately, while tears
  were forced into his eyes and trickled down his cheeks.</p>

  <p>It has been mentioned that sounds were audible all over the cottage. While
  he could still hear footsteps, he suddenly burst out into an explosion of
  coughing.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to smother the noise with the bedclothes, for he could
  not free his arms. With an effort he managed to roll on to his face, only to
  discover that in that position he could not breathe.</p>

  <p>When he tried to turn on his back again, in his trussed-up condition, he
  only fell into his original place, with his mouth buried in the pillow.
  Terrified of his helplessness, he did not mind now what noise he made, so
  long as he could attract attention to himself.</p>

  <p>The undertaker, who was walking down the stone-flagged path of the little
  garden, heard the distressing sounds. He stopped, turned round, and looked up
  in surprise at the death-chamber, where the whooping seemed to be
  located.</p>

  <p>He realised his mistake when he saw Mrs. Vera Baxter standing in the
  window of the next room. Her fair head was bent over her lace handkerchief,
  and her slight frame was shaken with violent gusts of coughing.</p>

  <p>"She's got a shocking cold," he reflected. "She'll be next to be put down,
  if she doesn't take care."</p>

  <p>It never occurred to him to wonder why she had pulled up the blind of the
  house of mourning.</p>

  <p>Vera continued to bark like a walrus, until the undertaker had closed the
  gate and disappeared round the bend of the road. Then she rushed into the
  next room, her eyes blazing with temper.</p>

  <p>Puggie had just finished unbinding Charlie's arms and was patting him on
  the back.</p>

  <p>"Poor chap had the devil of a fright. He'd turned turtle, 't other way
  round, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off at the sight of Vera's furious face.</p>

  <p>"You fool," she stormed. "You utter <i>fool.</i> Why didn't you sweep that
  man out of the room quickly as I told you? <i>Had</i> you to jaw about the
  War?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Puggie feebly, "we both fought on the same side, you know.
  I thought it rather a good line. Besides, I'd covered up Charlie's face so
  you couldn't see him smoke."</p>

  <p>"He <i>did</i>," chimed in Charlie bitterly. "With a bit of tissue-paper
  right over my mouth."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you find a feather?" asked Vera. "That would have given away the
  show even better."</p>

  <p>"I nearly choked," said Charlie. "The agony was terrible."</p>

  <p>He considered himself the injured party with a healthy claim for
  compensation, so was astonished when Vera turned upon him.</p>

  <p>"Can't you stand the least little thing? Are you a man, or a cry-baby? It
  was nothing but nerves&mdash;and I'm fed up with both of you."</p>

  <p>Puggie hurriedly offered her a cigarette and Charlie ran to find a
  lighter. Both men watched her anxiously as she puffed away fiercely. When the
  pinched look left her small face, they knew that her temper was over.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to fly off the handle," she said, with her old ringing laugh. "Oh,
  boys, what a life. After this, I'll never try to cheat even the railway
  company."</p>

  <p>"Well, we've crossed another bridge safely," gloated Puggie, patting her
  on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"There's to-morrow," Charlie reminded them. "I'll catch cold in that icy
  attic and cough again. I'd better stay in the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"I should," agreed Vera. "Any one who comes to the back door can see you
  through the window. Won't they have fun?...No, you complete idiot, you stay
  upstairs until it's dark and the blinds are down."</p>

  <p>As Charlie was obediently climbing up the ladder which led to the attic,
  she pulled him back.</p>

  <p>"Remember, you've <i>got</i> to settle on your new name to-day. If you
  can't make up your mind, <i>I'll</i> find you a name you won't like."</p>

  <p>As he sat in the attic, wrapped in a travelling-rug and with his feet on a
  stone hot-water bottle, Charlie reflected that it was really extraordinarily
  difficult to re-make a person. Little things that got settled easily and
  naturally in the ordinary course of birth, threatened to become
  complications, or even dangers, in a second incarnation.</p>

  <p>On one point, however, he was clear. He intended to have a brave new name
  with which to score over Puggie Williams. The trouble was that he had to
  reject his favourites, because Vera had explained to him that he must keep
  his initials.</p>

  <p>"If you don't, we shall have to scrap too many of your belongings," she
  told him.</p>

  <p>"Besides," added Puggie, "you might forget and sign your old initials. I
  often have, myself."</p>

  <p>Charlie racked his brains until the light gradually faded and he could
  scarcely see through the small ivy-choked window, set in the sloping roof.
  All day long the door-bell had been ringing intermittently, presumably
  bringing flowers for him. These signs of his popularity were tonic and made
  him forget the cold tip to his nose.</p>

  <p>Presently, he received his inspiration.</p>

  <p>"Chester Beaulieu."</p>

  <p>He could see it written in hotel-registers and printed in newspapers.
  Jumping up, he spied from his loop-hole and saw that all the lamps in the
  road were lit. As he judged it was safe to go down to the kitchen, he crept
  down the narrow stairs and along the passage. He could see a crack of light
  under the door which told him that the blinds were drawn, and he heard a
  murmur of voices.</p>

  <p>With a sudden suspicion that they might be talking about him, he stopped
  to listen.</p>

  <p>"I know this," declared Vera. "If I had my life over again, I wouldn't
  make the same mistake twice."</p>

  <p>"You would," Puggie told her. "But with a different partner."</p>

  <p>As it was too draughty to linger, Charlie pushed open the door. He
  received no welcome, and there were no signs of tea. The kitchen looked
  cheerless, for the floor was littered with straw and scraps of calico, torn
  from an old sheet.</p>

  <p>Both Vera and Puggie were reduced to a state of nervous prostration. They
  had believed that they could manufacture a dummy quite easily&mdash;taking it
  in their stride, as an eleventh-hour job. But the reality had nearly broken
  their hearts. The difficulty of disposing of all the leaden
  weights&mdash;which were to duplicate Charlie's weight&mdash;was almost
  overwhelming.</p>

  <p>Charlie burst into tactless laughter when he saw the swollen misshapen
  bundle, which was rendered doubly grotesque by a mask glued to one side of
  its alleged head.</p>

  <p>"If that looks like a body wire me at my own expense," he told them. "Is
  this supposed to be me?"</p>

  <p>"He's right," agreed Puggie, as he kicked the dummy and stubbed his toe
  against its metallic lining. "This chap has too many guts as it is. He
  doesn't want any more. Let's park the rest of the weights in the shell."</p>

  <p>"They'll rattle, you fool," snapped Vera.</p>

  <p>"Not if we tie them up in rags."</p>

  <p>"But they might move and shift the weight when the coffin is lifted."</p>

  <p>"Chance it, and call it a day."</p>

  <p>"No, it's got to be a <i>job</i>."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm through. Sewing isn't a man's work."</p>

  <p>Puggie straightened his back and lit his pipe, in token of mutiny. Charlie
  settled himself before the fire and warmed his knees, while Vera was left to
  finish the dummy.</p>

  <p>"Don't you boys strain yourselves," she advised with sugary venom.</p>

  <p>"Shall I help you?" offered Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Can you sew?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. But I'll try."</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are, then."</p>

  <p>Vera's thoughts were bitter as she stitched away furiously at the coarse
  sacking. Her back ached, her head was splitting, and her fingers were sore
  from pricks. Now that she was single-handed, she began to experience the
  nerve-racking sensations of a race against the clock. Something that would
  fool the undertaker, had to be buried with ceremony, to-morrow afternoon.</p>

  <p>She promised herself that once she was out of her present jam, she would
  play straight and cling to security. No more hitting the high spots, but a
  quiet life in the country. After a girlhood of shifts and indignities, with
  the hectic interlude of the Riviera, she wanted peace and quiet.</p>

  <p>Men were no good and Charlie was only a handicap. As she made the
  admission, the Devil slipped in through a crack in her brain. He reminded her
  that she was free in the eyes of the world. Once she received the insurance,
  there was nothing to stop her disappearing into the blue, where she could
  wear breeches, grow cabbages, and start a feud with the rector's wife.</p>

  <p>The next second she was furious with herself, for having even thought of
  the supreme dishonesty of deserting her partners in fraud. She sent the Devil
  packing with a flea in his ear.</p>

  <p>But he was not disheartened by the result of his experiment. At least, he
  had proved that the door of her mind was not sealed against his entrance, and
  he knew that next time she saw him, he would not appear so ugly.</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking of?" asked Charlie.</p>

  <p>"You'd never guess," she told him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I was thinking of you. It's going to be lonely in lodgings. I shall
  be counting the days to seeing you again."</p>

  <p>"Sure of me, aren't you? How do you know I shan't take the opportunity of
  losing you?"</p>

  <p>Charlie began to laugh at the mere suggestion of treachery.</p>

  <p>"I feel inspired about this business now," he said. "I've been reading
  'The Statue and the Bust' when I was in the attic. The Major must have been
  potty over poetry. I found a Browning chucked away with the rubbish. Fine
  stuff. It says indecision is the only sin, and you must stake your counter
  boldly, whether you're winning or losing."</p>

  <p>"Not me," grunted Puggie. "I'll stick to my shilling with the two
  heads."</p>

  <p>Charlie took no notice of the interruption.</p>

  <p>"It has reconciled me," he said, "to being a thief."</p>

  <p>"We're not <i>that</i>," objected Vera. "We're not stealing from a person.
  I've always paid my way and been honest. It's quite a different thing to do a
  company."</p>

  <p>"It's a penal offence. But I'd do anything once after reading that poem.
  So long as it was not cruel. It's inconceivable to me how a man can murder
  his wife."</p>

  <p>He looked around at the cracked yellow plaster walls, which had enclosed
  so many generations, as though asking them to bear witness of his words, as
  he added, "I simply could not be cruel to any woman."</p>

  <p>"I could be cruel to a man," declared Vera as she jabbed the needle into
  her thumb. "Get off your perch, Charlie, and tell me if you've chosen your
  name."</p>

  <p>"I have." Charlie rose and made a low bow. "Chester Beaulieu, at your
  service."</p>

  <p>"Pronounced 'Bewley'," put in Puggie.</p>

  <p>Charlie's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Why will they corrupt these fine old English names?" he asked. "It
  doesn't sound French that way. I'll have to make another choice."</p>

  <p>He looked so downcast that, to her own surprise, Vera felt an impulse to
  protect him from Puggie's derision.</p>

  <p>"Even 'Bewley's' a better name than yours," she said.</p>

  <p>"Which name?" asked Puggie. "Oh, you mean 'Williams', of course."</p>

  <p>Charlie threw him an envious glance, as he wondered again over the secret
  of Puggie's identity. He might even be a throw-out from the peerage. At the
  thought he changed the subject quickly.</p>

  <p>"Any more flowers for me?"</p>

  <p>"A darned sight too many. I've been on my pins all day taking them
  in."</p>

  <p>"I must see them...It seems rather a pity one has to die to find out how
  much the world thinks of you."</p>

  <p>"But you know why you're so popular, don't you?" asked Puggie. "It's
  because you've put Vera back into circulation. The Wrights have rung up and
  asked her to stay with them in the country for a week, instead of going back
  to an empty cottage. And you may bet the suggestion did not come from Lady
  Wright."</p>

  <p>Charlie's face was flaming as he turned to Vera.</p>

  <p>"You didn't accept?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I did," she snapped. "If it's known that the cottage is shut up
  directly after the funeral, no one will come nosing round while you're
  shaving and preparing for your getaway."</p>

  <p>"But I won't have it. That fat old Wright will maul you when he's
  pretending to comfort you."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry." Vera's laugh was thin. "I'm not going to weep on Daddy
  Wright's shoulder. I've had enough of men for a bit, thank you."</p>

  <p>She continued to cobble the dummy with huge stitches, until she had
  satisfied her own standard. She looked a pitiful little shrimp when she rose
  from her stooping posture. Her face was pinched with weariness, as she pushed
  back a strand of fair hair which blinded her.</p>

  <p>"Take it upstairs at once," she commanded, "and pray that no one comes to
  the front door while we're doing it."</p>

  <p>The transit of the dummy was a perilous adventure. Weighing as much as a
  man, it sagged and bulged in the middle as they dragged it up the narrow
  stairs. They got in each other's way, and shouted contrary orders, which
  resulted in savage treatment of Vera's handiwork. Just as they tugged it on
  to the landing, the stitches burst in a weak spot, releasing a weight which
  rolled from step to step down, to the passage.</p>

  <p>Charlie was running after it, when they were petrified by a loud ring at
  the front door.</p>

  <p>Like the dread shadow of a shark, they could see a black outline through
  the frosted glass panels. At the sight they lost their nerve completely.
  Consciousness of guilt made them cowards. They were positive that the dark
  shape had witnessed their suspicious action.</p>

  <p>Charlie bolted into the kitchen and Vera fled after him, leaving Puggie to
  face the music.</p>

  <p>With his back to the wall, he became a different person. He kicked the
  dummy farther along the passage, pulled up his socks, and sauntered with a
  nonchalant air down the stairs, prepared to open the door to the Devil.</p>

  <p>The caller was a lady. She was tall and gaunt, with the roughly blocked
  face and figure of a Rodin sculpture. Although she was well dressed, she
  appeared to have made a hurried toilet, for her white hair&mdash;coarse as
  linen threads&mdash;was a tangled bush above burning black eyes.</p>

  <p>She gave the impression of a primitive female, violently rammed into her
  best clothes, with a finishing-school accent clamped on to her northern
  burr.</p>

  <p>When she spoke, her voice was so strong and metallic that Puggie and Vera
  could hear every word.</p>

  <p>"I'm Miss Baxter. I've come to see my dead brother."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-07"
     id="ch-07"></a>VII. &mdash; CAVE-WOMAN</h2>

  <p class="first">PUGGIE stared at Miss Baxter, at a loss to account for her
  presence. He was positive that he had written to Charlie's old address. Eton
  Lodge had stuck in his memory, because of its association with his youth.</p>

  <p>"Quick work," he said. "When did you get my letter?"</p>

  <p>"This morning," replied Miss Baxter. "I only got it by chance. It was sent
  to an old address."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;how&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"An old maid of mine had just gone into service with the new people there.
  She noticed the postmark and, as she knew where my brother lived, she rang me
  up. I came over at once for the letter."</p>

  <p>In spite of the cultivated refinement of her accent, her voice was lumpy
  with emotion. Again she gave the impression of some rough substance, hammered
  flat, or wrung between rollers.</p>

  <p>"This morning," repeated Puggie, his brow still furrowed. "But how did you
  get here so soon?"</p>

  <p>"I flew&mdash;most of the way."</p>

  <p>"By gum." He looked at her with real admiration, for he recognised her as
  the type which hails an omnibus. "That <i>was</i> sporting. But the funeral's
  not until to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I haven't come for the funeral. I do not wish to meet any one. I only
  want to see my dead brother."</p>

  <p>Involuntarily, Puggie made a horrible grimace, as he thought of the
  bloated calico dummy sprawling on the landing. There was only a short flight
  of stairs. He looked at Miss Baxter's long legs, and decided that she could
  take it in two strides if she were really bent upon action.</p>

  <p>The situation was beyond him, so he basely left it to Vera.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell Mrs. Baxter you're here," he mumbled.</p>

  <p>"Please do nothing of the kind." Miss Baxter's tone was astringent. "I do
  not wish to speak of family matters to a stranger. But I must be frank.
  Nothing on earth would induce me to meet that woman."</p>

  <p>Every word that she said was audible in the kitchen, where Charlie and
  Vera stared at each other with scared eyes. As she listened, Vera's face grew
  scarlet and she sprang to the door.</p>

  <p>"She <i>will</i> see me," she said.</p>

  <p>Charlie, whose knees were knocking together, dragged her back.</p>

  <p>"Don't go, Vera. It's Emmy. You don't know her. She'll make mincemeat of
  you. We <i>can't</i> keep her out."</p>

  <p>Vera bit her lip fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Will she come in with us?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No. She's funny that way. She even gives back wrong change. She'll make
  me give the money back."</p>

  <p>"You haven't got it yet...Hush."</p>

  <p>Vera strained to catch what Puggie was saying, but could only hear a
  protesting murmur. Then Miss Baxter's voice rang out like a
  trumpet-blast.</p>

  <p>"Let me pass, please. I'm going upstairs to see my brother."</p>

  <p>"Please don't." Puggie spoke in his most charming and persuasive manner.
  "I really do understand, and you have my deepest sympathy. I only wish to
  save you a painful scene. If you go up now, you'll meet Mrs. Baxter in the
  bedroom. She won't leave poor Charlie. Please come into the
  drawing-room."</p>

  <p>As they waited, Charlie and Vera held their breath. If Miss Baxter crashed
  the stairs, exposure was but a matter of seconds.</p>

  <p>But their luck held and the immediate danger was staved off.</p>

  <p>"In that case, I must wait until she has gone down," said Miss Baxter.</p>

  <p>In spite of her grief, the snob within her recognised the submerged
  gentleman in Puggie, and she responded to his personality as much as to his
  argument. He was positively tender, as he armed her deferentially into the
  sitting-room, and switched on the light.</p>

  <p>He noticed Miss Baxter's shudder, for the cold room was the picture of
  discomfort and neglect. Vera had been too busy to touch it, after she had
  sent the maid away, and the grate was still choked with ashes.</p>

  <p>At its best it was an uneven apartment, for the major was not only a
  hoarder, but had travelled. Every step of his wanderings could be
  traced&mdash;as well as the stages of his decline to comparative
  poverty&mdash;in valuable family heirlooms, gadgets from Woolworth, and a
  cosmopolitan collection of curios.</p>

  <p>"You must be frightfully cold after your flight, and the shock and all
  that," said Puggie. "Can I get you a spot&mdash;Will you have tea?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, thank you."</p>

  <p>"Then if you'll sit here&mdash;this is the easiest chair&mdash;I'll go
  upstairs. Soon be back."</p>

  <p>Puggie rushed up the stairs like a battering-ram going into action, but
  they did not hear him creep down again, in his socks. They started when he
  suddenly appeared in the kitchen, his shoes in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I've dragged the dummy inside the bedroom and locked the door," he told
  them. "That'll keep her out for a bit. But it'll look darned fishy if we
  don't let her in."</p>

  <p>"Leave her to me," said Vera.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that her blood was up and she was spoiling for a fight.
  Before the men could stop her, she had gone into the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>It was an economic blunder that the theatrical management&mdash;which took
  off her clothes and so reduced her to another standardised
  show-girl&mdash;had no chance to test her real quality. She made a well-timed
  and effective entrance, while the quiet dignity of her manner&mdash;vibrating
  with emotion&mdash;was excellent acting.</p>

  <p>She bowed to the gaunt woman, who sprang to her feet&mdash;the fierce
  sorrow in her eyes fighting the composure of her prim bitten lips.</p>

  <p>"If you've come to pay us a visit, Miss Baxter," she said, "you are
  exactly five years too late."</p>

  <p>Miss Baxter returned her bow, although she nearly choked at the sight of
  the peroxide blonde. She would not have divided the noun from its qualifying
  adjective, even had she known the truth that Vera's fair hair was natural,
  and only received an occasional camomile rinse.</p>

  <p>"I have already explained to your friend," she said, "that my visit is not
  to you, but to my brother. I will not take up any of your time."</p>

  <p>She walked to the door, but Vera guarded it.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she told her. "I'm going to hurt you. You cannot see Charlie.
  It was his wish."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry&mdash;but I cannot believe that."</p>

  <p>"Why not? Wasn't it natural? You know how sensitive he was. He felt the
  treatment he got from his family most deeply. It cut him to the heart to be
  always treated like an outcast."</p>

  <p>In the kitchen, Charlie gulped as a tribute to her emotion, while Puggie
  grinned appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"Hanged if I know which of the two to back," he whispered, as he opened
  the door, so as to lose nothing of the fight.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Miss Baxter, "but I don't wish to discuss the matter.
  Please let me go upstairs."</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>." Vera's voice was fierce. "You've got to do him justice, even
  if it's too late. You cast him off, because he was loyal to <i>me.</i> Do you
  blame a man for sticking to his wife? Why, even a rat would be loyal to its
  mate."</p>

  <p>"Keep off natural history," murmured Puggie, "or you'll be sunk."</p>

  <p>But by this time Miss Baxter was blind and deaf to any academic blunder,
  as her smouldering eyes burst into flame. So far, the women had observed the
  conventions. That polite phrase, "I'm sorry," kept them from tearing each
  other's eyes. Yet there was savagery underneath the veneer. Vera was at bay,
  and Miss Baxter was a lioness bereft of her foster-cub.</p>

  <p>Now that he was dead Charlie was no longer the black sheep of the family,
  but the baby she had reared. On her way she had been reviving old memories.
  She smiled again over the audacity of the small boy who wore her nightdress,
  when he stood on the balcony and preached to the people in the street. At the
  time she had been proud of the clever imp for his parody of their clergyman,
  although she hoped fervently that her nightgown had remained anonymous.</p>

  <p>In turn, she took off her gloves.</p>

  <p>"Listen <i>you</i>," she commanded. "I brought up Charlie. I was fond of
  him and he was fond of me. Then you came and took him out of my life."</p>

  <p>"I didn't," screamed Vera. "It was your beastly pride. I wasn't good
  enough for your family. I was an actress."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, we didn't consider you that."</p>

  <p>Vera's fingers began to curl.</p>

  <p>"You mean, I wore no clothes?" she asked shrilly. "Well, at least he knew
  what he was getting, which was more than a man would with <i>your</i>
  kind."</p>

  <p>Miss Baxter made an effort to preserve her dignity.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't want a scene. If I hurt my brother, I want to tell
  him&mdash;now&mdash;I'm sorry, and ask him to&mdash;to forgive me."</p>

  <p>As she began to wipe her eyes, Vera softened.</p>

  <p>"But you wouldn't know him," she said hopefully. "He's grown a beard, and
  he looks years older."</p>

  <p>For a moment Miss Baxter weakened. A strange man lying in Charlie's place.
  Then she forced a smile to her lips.</p>

  <p>"I shall still see my boy," she said. "Let me go to him."</p>

  <p>In the kitchen, Charlie dug his nails into his palms, and sweat furred his
  upper-lip. Puggie ran true to form, for his thoughts turned to blackmail.</p>

  <p>"Has she any secret?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," muttered Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Love affair?"</p>

  <p>"You saw her."</p>

  <p>Puggie agreed, with a hopeless shake of his head.</p>

  <p>In the pause they heard Miss Baxter's voice raised several tones. The
  natural woman had forced her way out and was proceeding to action.</p>

  <p>"Get out of my way."</p>

  <p>A scuffle, followed by a thud, told them that Miss Baxter's superior
  weight had won the day. Her rapid footsteps on the stairs were succeeded by
  the tapping of Vera's Spanish heels as she raced in pursuit.</p>

  <p>On the landing there was another tussle.</p>

  <p>"Unlock this door," shouted Miss Baxter.</p>

  <p>"I won't," screamed Vera.</p>

  <p>"Then I shall go and call in the first policeman, and tell him the
  circumstances. I am convinced you're hiding something."</p>

  <p>It was a shot in the dark, but Vera crumpled up and remained speechless.
  In the kitchen Puggie began to shake Charlie.</p>

  <p>"<i>Think</i>," he growled.</p>

  <p>But the rough-handling only dislodged one trifling memory.</p>

  <p>"Once I met her coming out of the dark china-pantry under the stairs, with
  the curate."</p>

  <p>Almost before the words were out of his mouth, Puggie was scrawling them
  on a leaf torn from his notebook. As he hurried up the stairs, he pretended
  not to notice the emotional state of the ladies.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry." He used the current phrase mechanically, as he handed the
  scrap of paper to Vera. "But this urgent message has just come."</p>

  <p>She glanced at it.</p>

  <p>"Tell the man 'no answer,'" she commanded him.</p>

  <p>She waited until Puggie had gone downstairs before she turned to Miss
  Baxter&mdash;a sparkle of fresh life in her blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"I've been trying to save you pain," she said gently. "You say you were
  fond of Charlie. But he was not fond of you. He despised you because he
  believed you were a hypocrite. He told me you condemned loose conduct in
  others, while you carried on yourself on the sly, because <i>you</i> were a
  lady."</p>

  <p>Miss Baxter's lips turned livid.</p>

  <p>"Open that door," she said huskily, "and repeat that lie before my dead
  brother&mdash;if you dare."</p>

  <p>"It's not a lie," persisted Vera. "He did give you away. I'll tell you
  exactly what he said. He told me he knew what went on in the dark closet
  under the stairs, with you and the curate."</p>

  <p>She was almost shocked by the results of her thrust. Miss Baxter's face
  contracted, as though in acute pain, and she gripped the balustrade.</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;said&mdash;that?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he did. I couldn't make it up, could I?"</p>

  <p>"No. <i>He</i> told you."</p>

  <p>Walking like an old woman, Miss Baxter groped her way down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" asked Vera.</p>

  <p>"Back," replied Miss Baxter stonily. "After that, I never wish to see him
  again&mdash;dead or alive."</p>

  <p>The door slammed and she disappeared into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Vera stood motionless, unable to believe in her victory. The surrender had
  been too sudden and too complete. Miss Baxter had spoken of her brother as
  though she did not accept his death.</p>

  <p>"Dead or alive." The phrase stuck like a burr, although she could not
  remember everything that had been said. Her head was in a whirl, and she was
  only certain of one fact.</p>

  <p>Miss Baxter was their enemy. She had retreated&mdash;only to come back.
  And when she came, she would not come alone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-08"
     id="ch-08"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES</h2>

  <p class="first">UNLIKE the men, Vera could keep her worries to herself. She
  was used to depend on her own resource; and she saw no sense in weakening the
  morale of her allies, merely for her own support. Yet, as she crouched on the
  top stair and tried to gauge the situation, her little rouged face grew
  peaked with anxiety.</p>

  <p>It seemed evident that they were up against a real peril. Although it was
  difficult to credit the gaunt wooden-faced woman with youthful intrigue,
  there was no doubt as to the cause of her discomfiture. Her mantle of
  respectability had suddenly been twitched off her by a strange hand, so that
  she had fled metaphorically&mdash;naked&mdash;out into the night.</p>

  <p>But Vera knew that she had not acquired that tight lip for nothing. Once
  she ceased to quiver from shame of exposure, her wits would begin to work
  again. She was bound to hark back to her original grievance&mdash;the fact
  that she had been denied a sight of her brother.</p>

  <p>The supposititious deference to his wishes could not explain away the
  locked door. She had been driven off by shock-tactics; but nothing had been
  done to kill her suspicion.</p>

  <p>"She'll find that policeman," thought Vera.</p>

  <p>So far as she knew, he would have no authority to enter without her
  permission; but the incident would start what she most
  dreaded&mdash;publicity. There would be a crop of rumours, exaggerations, and
  the first hint of scandal.</p>

  <p>As she stared at the frosted glass panels of the front door, expecting
  every moment to see the dreaded silhouette of a helmet, a shout arose from
  below.</p>

  <p>"Vera, where are you?"</p>

  <p>"Coming," she called.</p>

  <p>She reminded herself that, in the sloppy state of the roads, she need not
  expect immediate reprisal. Although her nerves were quivering from the strain
  of waiting, she marched jauntily into the kitchen, whistling between her
  teeth.</p>

  <p>As she expected, the men were exchanging congratulations.</p>

  <p>"Definitely an inspiration, old chap," declared Puggie, patting Charlie
  affectionately on the back.</p>

  <p>"No, <i>you</i> acted on it," said Charlie. He shook his head, as he
  added, "Who would have thought it of Emmie? It's degrading. I owe nothing to
  my family; but, at least, I believed my sisters were straight."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it, old boy. She's a real fine old sport."</p>

  <p>Vera was furious to remark that he plainly admired Miss Baxter for this
  revelation of torrid history. Like many another woman of strict
  respectability, her censure of those who were minus her own scruples was
  tinctured with envy.</p>

  <p>Besides, it was a depressing reminder of the end of youth and love.</p>

  <p>A loud peal of the front-door bell made her jump.</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" she cried sharply.</p>

  <p>"More flowers for me," said Charlie hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Blast your flowers," growled Puggie as he reluctantly laid down his pipe
  and went to answer the door.</p>

  <p>As she waited Vera pressed her scarlet-tipped fingers to her teeth. Unable
  to bear the suspense she dashed out of the kitchen, nearly knocking down
  Puggie at the end of the passage.</p>

  <p>"What was it?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Only the post," he replied. "Letter for you."</p>

  <p>He noticed that her fingers shook when she ripped open the envelope, and
  he grasped the opportunity.</p>

  <p>"You look whacked, old child. What about a toothful?"</p>

  <p>To his surprise she jumped at the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Bon idea. It'll buck us up. We've got to settle everything to-night.
  To-morrow morning will be too hectic. And remember we shan't meet again after
  the funeral."</p>

  <p>She felt better after a small brandy and began to read her letter. It was
  from Lady Wright, confirming her telephone conversation&mdash;a business-like
  touch which suggested her husband's influence.</p>

  <p>Sir Horace was a gross man, who found "little Mrs. Charlie," as he called
  her, very attractive. He always invited the guests, for his wife had no
  initiative; she was a dull, kind woman, who always returned his suit at
  bridge, whatever the consequences.</p>

  <p>"I'm to go back with them in their car directly after the funeral,"
  announced Vera. "She says they won't hear of me returning immediately to an
  empty house. They want me to stay a week."</p>

  <p>"And I shall buzz off to the Grapes until it's time for me to lift
  Charlie," supplemented Puggie. Then he glanced at Charlie and added, "Can we
  trust the blighter in the cottage, all on his lonesome?"</p>

  <p>Vera at once began to lay down the law to her husband.</p>

  <p>"Before you do anything else, you must shave. Directly we start, get busy.
  You must have daylight for that. You can see perfectly well through the
  transparency if you use the bathroom."</p>

  <p>He was not listening to her, however, as he turned to Puggie.</p>

  <p>"You must give up calling me 'Charlie.' I've chosen my name. In future I
  shall be 'Chester Beaverbrook'."</p>

  <p>"You pinched that from a newspaper," Puggie told him.</p>

  <p>"It'll do," decided Vera. "But I warn you, no more chop-and-change. Did
  you hear what I said about shaving first?"</p>

  <p>She had forgotten her fears...And it was well for her peace of mind that
  she did not know that even then, big feet in regulation boots were making
  puddles in the slush, on their way to Jasmine Cottage.</p>

  <p>Happily unconscious of this, Vera issued her orders.</p>

  <p>"Allow yourself plenty of time for shaving. Getting off that beard won't
  be exactly like peeling a banana. Then change. After you're quite ready pack
  your suitcase. Remember, only socks and shirts and little things like that.
  You're not to take any of your suits."</p>

  <p>"But I'd prefer to wear my old clothes in London," protested Charlie.
  "They do fit me. Those tweeds that Puggie bought me will make me look a
  bounder."</p>

  <p>"A compliment to you, Beaverbrook," said Puggie with a cynical grin.
  "We've got to make you look a totally different person."</p>

  <p>"Well, I consider it a senseless precaution."</p>

  <p>"It's not," declared Vera. "Listen to mummy baby-boy. We don't know every
  one in this town by sight. Suppose some tailor's assistant has some
  distinctive way of sewing on a button&mdash;or something. He may come up to
  London and sit opposite to you at a Corner House. If he noticed your
  coat&mdash;and tailors always do&mdash;he'd say, 'Hallo, that's one of
  <i>our</i> suits.' The next thing is he'd be looking at <i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>"Too far-fetched. And he wouldn't recognise me.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. But I'm not going to run one single risk."</p>

  <p>"Besides," put in Puggie, "Vera will sell all your old clothes in the
  neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the widow always does," nodded Vera.</p>

  <p>"And something else," went on Puggie, whose brain was oiled by brandy. "In
  future you mustn't wear your watch, or your tie-pin, or your ox, or your ass,
  or anything that is yours."</p>

  <p>"W&mdash;what d'you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean, old pal, that your widow is going to give them to me as a
  personal relic of a dear old friend. Whenever I wear your watch, I shall
  remember you."</p>

  <p>"I think you are doing quite well as it is," remarked Charlie quietly.</p>

  <p>He resented the thousand pounds which was to be paid to Puggie as his
  share of the fraud. It seemed to him that ghouls were already at their foul
  work of churchyard desecration&mdash;digging up his grave and stripping his
  corpse.</p>

  <p>"Instead of counting your chickens, you'd better practise calling me
  'Chester'," he reminded them.</p>

  <p>"I shall call you 'Sweetheart'," declared Vera. "That's wholesale, and I
  needn't get out of practice when we've parted."</p>

  <p>Although she still started every time the front door bell rang, she was
  beginning to recover confidence. There had been a succession of alarms, and
  they had all proved false. While they had been careful to be intimate with no
  one in Starminster, so as to avoid the expense of entertainment, they had
  been unable to escape popularity. The aftermath of this was a shoal of
  sympathetic messages for Vera.</p>

  <p>She went on to coach up Charlie in his postmortem duties.</p>

  <p>"You must use the gas-stove if you want to make yourself a cup of tea. But
  I shall let the Ideal stove go out in the morning. Remember, the cottage is
  supposed to be empty If any nosey parker saw smoke coming from the chimney,
  he might try to get in, to see if there was a fire or something. Anyway, they
  could use it as an excuse to pry round."</p>

  <p>"All right," agreed Charlie.</p>

  <p>"And you mustn't light up. You might show a chink of light through
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>"But am I to sit for hours in the dark and cold?"</p>

  <p>Puggie took the part of the persecuted male even though he enjoyed his
  discomfiture.</p>

  <p>"No, hang it all, Vera, it's quite safe. All the blinds will be down for
  the funeral."</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps he might knock over a kettle in the dark and make a row,"
  said Vera. "But I must say it's a mystery to me why he's kicking. He doesn't
  seem able to realise that it is prison against picking up four thousand
  pounds."</p>

  <p>"Darling, I do," protested Charlie. "What time am I to leave the
  Cottage?"</p>

  <p>"Six-thirty, sharp," said Puggie. "It will be dark before then. But the
  later we leave it, the fewer people are likely to be about. Tradesmen and
  cars and so on...Keep your eyes peeled when you open the gate. If any one
  sees you, we're sunk."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Whereabouts will you pick me up?"</p>

  <p>"I'll leave the Grapes a quarter of an hour after you. You won't have gone
  far by then. Listen out for the rattle of the old stink-pot. Only hope she'll
  last out till we make York...Hang. There's that bally bell again."</p>

  <p>"Double ring," said Vera. "That's the parcel post. I'll go."</p>

  <p>Confident that she would not meet a caller, she hurried down the dimly-lit
  passage and flung open the door.</p>

  <p>Her shock was the greater when she saw&mdash;blocking the entry&mdash;the
  dark figure of a policeman.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>IX. &mdash; ENTER CHESTER BEAVERBROOK</h2>

  <p class="first">"IS the lady of the house at home?" asked the policeman,
  looking down with some doubt at the flaxen-haired slip of a girl in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"I am Mrs. Baxter," replied Vera tremulously.</p>

  <p>Her breath came in a sob. The next instant she recovered herself, and with
  the spirit of self-preservation uppermost, was ready to spit and snarl. But
  luckily, however, she had made her effect on the policeman, who spoke with
  respectful sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to intrude, mum, but I've been chatting with your girl&mdash;Miss
  Reed&mdash;and she tells me that this house will be empty for about a week.
  If you'll take my advice you'll cut the water off, in case of frost, and
  leave all the blinds up and the top windows open a crack. When a place looks
  all shut up it's the best way to advertise that the family's from home."</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>thank</i> you, Inspector," gasped Vera, in her relief giving him
  the most imposing title she could remember.</p>

  <p>But thanks and compliments apparently did not meet the case.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'll do my best to keep an eye on it for you," offered the
  policeman.</p>

  <p>Half a crown changed hands, and Vera returned jubilantly to the kitchen to
  report the latest development.</p>

  <p>"Now you'll <i>have</i> to wait in the dark," she told her husband
  ruthlessly. "Puggie, you'll have to stay behind, and directly the coffin's
  out of the house, draw all the blinds up. If we don't, we may have that
  policeman nosing round."</p>

  <p>She was in excellent spirits, for she was beginning to feel really safe.
  From the length of time which had elapsed, she assured herself that Miss
  Baxter had no real intention of carrying out her threat.</p>

  <p>"Get your pass-book, Charlie," she ordered. "We've got to settle the
  business end to-night."</p>

  <p>Charlie looked rather guilty.</p>

  <p>"It's at the Bank," he said. "But I always jot down my balance whenever I
  draw a cheque. I'll get my cheque-book."</p>

  <p>Their examination of the last counterfoil was rather a blow, for it proved
  that their resources had shrunken lower than they anticipated.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said Vera. "We've got my squirrel-store. Charlie's the only
  one who will want spot-cash. What's the least you can manage on, little
  man?"</p>

  <p>The financial discussion that followed was after the nature of a Dutch
  auction. Charlie was terrified of being stranded in London without money, and
  his demands were prohibitive. They pulled down his figure until they
  compromised on an allowance of four pounds a week.</p>

  <p>Vera, with her usual talent for clearing the ground as she went along,
  prepared to pay him the money immediately. For the past year they had been
  drawing cheques over and above their requirements, so as not to arouse
  suspicion at the Bank by a last-minute withdrawal.</p>

  <p>Both the men's eyes glittered as she produced a pile of clean notes and
  began to count them out.</p>

  <p>"How long will he have to hold out?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Better take a squint at the Policy," advised Puggie.</p>

  <p>Vera followed his advice with a slight stab of fear lest she should find
  some obstacle which they had overlooked. In spite of all her resolution, she
  could not shake her belief in the existence of that fatal snag. Her common
  sense kept reminding her that five thousand pounds were not to be picked up
  so casually as in Puggie's convincing arguments.</p>

  <p>"Listen to this condition," she said. "'Before the claimant shall be
  entitled to any payment under or by virtue of this Assurance this Policy must
  be delivered up to the Company and proof satisfactory to the Company be
  produced by the claimant at the chief offices of the Company in London of the
  following matters: (<i>a</i>) The happening of the event upon which the
  Policy monies are alleged to have become payable; (<i>b</i>) the nature of
  the disease or other cause of death where the event alleged is the death of
  the assured; (<i>c</i>) the age of the assured, unless such age shall
  previously have been admitted by the Company; and (<i>d</i>) the title of the
  Claimant'."</p>

  <p>Her face was pinched as she looked at the men. It was obvious that Charlie
  was day-dreaming and had no inkling of its drift, but Puggie nodded his head
  reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Seems all in order," he said. "All you've got to do is to get busy. As
  you're sole legatee and executor, you'll have to take out Probate. If any one
  here tries to advise you, tell them I'm on the job."</p>

  <p>"How soon will the Company pay up?" asked Vera.</p>

  <p>"Depends. You'll get a document called 'Probate of the Will,' which you'll
  have to send up to the Company. And you'll have to give proof of title. All
  this will take a little time. But if they don't smell a rat and hold up
  payment so that they can make investigations, well&mdash;it should not be too
  long."</p>

  <p>"How long?" persisted Vera.</p>

  <p>"Say&mdash;two months, if we prod Acorn. Tell him to hurry it through as
  you want to get the business settled before you go away."</p>

  <p>"Acorn. Oh, I shall take care of <i>him</i>."</p>

  <p>Charlie's lids fluttered at the scorn in her voice.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't always pay to play quiet men too low," he said.</p>

  <p>Without noticing his warning Vera gave him a bulky envelope.</p>

  <p>"I've allowed for three months, so as to give you a margin," she
  explained. "There's fifty pounds here. Remember, the less you spend the
  longer you can hang out. If you manage to save anything, you can take me out
  to celebrate afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, darling."</p>

  <p>"But, Charlie, it's your own safety...I <i>may</i> be late getting to
  you."</p>

  <p>His soft brown eyes flickered apprehensively from face to face. Although
  he could not be certain, he thought that a glance flashed between them.</p>

  <p>"I've picked an address from the paper where you can stay," went on Vera
  briskly. "It's a boarding-house, Acre Lane, Brixton. A family would work out
  a little cheaper. But you <i>may</i> talk."</p>

  <p>Charlie made no protest. In silence he took the printed slip and put it
  away carefully inside his note-case. Inwardly, however, he mutinied against
  being used as a pawn in the game. He had financed the scheme and borne the
  personal discomforts; yet, at this stage, there was little to distinguish him
  from the dummy that was going to deputise at his funeral.</p>

  <p>"If you get in a jam," said Vera, "let Puggie know."</p>

  <p>"Mightn't I prefer to write directly to my wife?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be an utter fool. Suppose the letter went astray and got into the
  wrong hands. We dare risk nothing. Suppose we are suspected." Vera's fears
  flew wildly round her, like sea-gulls beating against a lighthouse beacon.
  "The Company may give orders to the Post Office to open our correspondence.
  <i>Listen.</i> Until we meet again, the wires are cut."</p>

  <p>"But can't you write to me?"</p>

  <p>"To my dead husband? What address? H. or C.?"</p>

  <p>"You could write to Chester Beaverbrook."</p>

  <p>"And put them on his trail? They may want to find out the name of the
  gentleman in the case. Haven't you any sense? If we slip up now, on a single
  thing, it's&mdash;prison."</p>

  <p>At that moment, any moralist who saw their tense faces and hunted eyes
  could have drawn a valuable conclusion as to the penalty of dishonesty. Then
  Vera laughed, to raise their spirits, and sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"I'll get supper now," she said.</p>

  <p>"But how are you off for chink, Vera?" asked Puggie.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll be all right. I've some of the hoard left. And I needn't bother
  to pay cash, now."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't ask the Bank for an overdraft. They'll want security."</p>

  <p>"We're all right with the Bank," put in Charlie. "I, personally, drew the
  manager's attention to the fact that my account was getting low and said I
  would transfer money from one of my other banks. Now I'm dead and Vera is
  going away, he will expect the account to be closed and not fed."</p>

  <p>Puggie asked no more questions. They were so used to leaving Vera to face
  the music that they never questioned the strain on her nervous system.
  Charlie watched her appealingly as she danced round the kitchen, flourishing
  a frying-pan.</p>

  <p>"You won't forget to feed my birds?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Vera impatiently.</p>

  <p>As he smiled at her promise he looked the kind and courteous gentleman
  whom a schoolgirl had idealised to King Arthur's knight. Inside the kitchen
  walls was sealed his own declaration that he could not be cruel to a
  woman.</p>

  <p>Yet he had just committed a deed of utmost mental cruelty. He had
  callously torn its sole precious memory from a life which held no
  promise.</p>

  <p>When Vera had told Miss Baxter that Charlie had betrayed her secret, the
  elderly spinster felt as though she had been spattered with filth. She had
  led a life of fierce respectability and self-denial, as housekeeper to her
  father, who was a widower. A regular old Turk, he had refused to admit young
  men at his front door; but his daughters were resourceful, and all of
  them&mdash;with the exception of Emily&mdash;had reached marriage through
  back-door courtships.</p>

  <p>Yet she, too, had her memory, when, one afternoon, the curate had
  surprised her washing-up and had insisted on wiping the tea-things. The
  episode thrilled her more than a kiss, for it hinted at a prelude to domestic
  partnership. When Charlie met them coming out, she had exchanged smiles with
  him, confident of his sympathy, since he, too, was forced to make love in
  corners.</p>

  <p>The curate never repeated the experience, and she did not blame him. He
  was a tall man and had to stoop, since the china-pantry had been designed by
  a Victorian architect with the right ideas on female menial labour.</p>

  <p>But she believed her secret to be a link between herself and
  Charlie...Now, he had not only betrayed her to the peroxide blonde but had
  cheapened a pure idyll with the taint of intrigue.</p>

  <p>Charlie had hit her with his fists when he was a spoiled brat. He had
  ended by kicking her from his grave.</p>

  <p>As she splashed through the grey slush, the first protective skin formed
  over her wound. She stopped at the nearest florist, to order a wreath to be
  sent to Jasmine Cottage, choosing a chaplet of bay-leaves, a cluster of mauve
  orchids, and a purple bow.</p>

  <p>She wrote a message on her own card. "To dear Charlie, in affectionate
  memory, from his sister." The action restored her self-respect and helped to
  sustain her through the cold and misery of a night-journey, third-class, and
  a slow train.</p>

  <p>As she sat bolt upright, biting her lips, Charlie spoke of her with utmost
  kindness while he ate sausages and mashed potatoes.</p>

  <p>"I'm really touched to hear that Emily flew here. That meant a real
  sacrifice...There must be <i>something</i> in me after all."</p>

  <p>Vera and Puggie both hooted with contempt.</p>

  <p>"It's her nobility, not yours," said Vera.</p>

  <p>"No." Charlie was quietly insistent. "You've seen the sort she is. She
  isn't a fool to be taken in, is she? Besides, look at all the flowers. Those
  cost money this time of year, and nobody's going to get another drink out of
  me. I must have given something to the world or people wouldn't be so sorry I
  was dead."</p>

  <p>Glancing at Vera, Puggie noticed that she was staring at him with a
  puzzled frown, as though she was caught by his argument. To remove all doubts
  as to his true character, he began to show him up.</p>

  <p>"You always were a dirty little cheat, Charlie. What about those wretched
  kids you swindled out of half-crowns?"</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Vera glared at him. When Charlie had told them of the
  Competitions, she had not been amused; but, since it was a voluntary
  confession, it followed that it was not playing the game to bring it up
  against him afterwards.</p>

  <p>Charlie, however, was not abashed.</p>

  <p>"I've nothing to reproach myself with," he said, speaking with conviction.
  "As a matter of fact I was the only one who played fair."</p>

  <p>"And how?" demanded Puggie.</p>

  <p>"When I signed a declaration saying that it was my unaided work, <i>I</i>
  told the truth. But the children committed perjury, because they were helped
  by their parents."</p>

  <p>"How d'you know that?"</p>

  <p>"They must have been or they couldn't have done the Competitions. Some of
  those buried names were very tricky and nearly stumped <i>me</i>...And now
  I'll make some tea."</p>

  <p>As Charlie went into the scullery to fill his kettle Puggie suddenly
  gripped Vera's wrist.</p>

  <p>"Vera," he whispered, "never let him get on top of you."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked, surprised at his genuine concern.</p>

  <p>"Because the fellow's not to be trusted. We've started&mdash;something.
  And we may not be able to stop it."</p>

  <p>He stopped speaking as Charlie came into the kitchen, a cloth tied round
  his waist to protect his trousers. Both burst into derisive laughter, and he
  good-naturedly joined in their amusement.</p>

  <p>Yet for all that, Puggie had just caught a first glimpse of Chester
  Beaverbrook.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>X. &mdash; FUNERAL HONOURS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE first time Charles Baxter died, he was not buried.</p>

  <p>The day of his funeral was unusually dark; the temperature had risen
  slightly in the night, and the resultant fog veiled any suggestion of
  sunrise. The anonymous schoolgirl&mdash;who had prayed for his
  resurrection&mdash;had breakfast by artificial light, for she had to make an
  early start to catch a train.</p>

  <p>Her holidays were over, so that she had a double cause for depression when
  she stood on the damp station platform and waited for the signal to drop.
  Starminster had looked grey as ashes when she drove through it. Roofs dripped
  moisture and the whole world wept.</p>

  <p>Although she made her farewells with the requisite stoicism, a lump kept
  rising in her throat as the train steamed through desolate country where dark
  furrows of earth were ridging the snow. Whenever she thought of Charlie
  Baxter lying in his coffin, she swallowed so vehemently that her throat felt
  sore.</p>

  <p>When she reached York there was the usual reunion of girls, who wore their
  school uniform of navy blue, with claret hat-band and tie. As she mingled
  with them, to her surprise, her spirits rose perceptibly, and by the time
  they invaded the impressive restaurant for a final feast, she was accompanied
  by no shadowy companion.</p>

  <p>Charlie Baxter had withdrawn into the misted land of fantasy. She ate
  cream buns and discussed hockey prospects, while her bill mounted and her
  voice rose highest. For this special schoolgirl was not of the stuff of which
  Constant Nymphs are made.</p>

  <p>As Vera had anticipated there was a last-minute rush of preparations at
  Jasmine Cottage. When it came to the point, she could not trust Charlie to
  pack his suitcase. There were constant knocks at the door, and both she and
  Puggie had to be on the alert, to shoo the deceased into hiding. He was
  keenly disappointed to be absent from his own funeral, and in his wish not to
  miss any of the excitement, he lost all sense of caution.</p>

  <p>He slunk about the passage, ready to dart forward and read the card on
  each fresh wreath as it arrived. Presently, after an unusually narrow escape,
  Vera turned on him and gave him the roughest edge of her tongue.</p>

  <p>To her surprise he snapped back, against all precedent.</p>

  <p>"Fact is, I've been too decent to you, Vera," he told her. "Kindness and
  consideration is lost on you. You prefer a brute who would give you a hell.
  If I had my time over again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You <i>are</i> going to have your time over again," Puggie reminded
  him.</p>

  <p>Charlie looked dazed at the interruption.</p>

  <p>"So I <i>am</i>," he said softly. "I hadn't realised that."</p>

  <p>"Well, what will you do?" asked Vera derisively.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" He broke off to finish lamely. "I'll be different."</p>

  <p>Vera merely turned on a perilous Spanish heel and flounced into the
  kitchen, to cut sandwiches for his refreshment. She was careful to pick out
  the tenderest bits of cold beef, and to spread the butter thickly, for she
  wanted to tempt his appetite even while she cursed his idiocy.</p>

  <p>"No sense of responsibility," she complained to Puggie, who stood watching
  her with rather a sad expression in his watery eyes.</p>

  <p>"First call, miss," he said, glancing at his watch. "Curtain's going
  up."</p>

  <p>"Help. We're for it now."</p>

  <p>"Wonky, old girl?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." She shivered. "If I could put back the clock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off and forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"Time to say 'Good-bye,' Puggie. I'll send the cheque. Can you make out
  all right?"</p>

  <p>"Definitely. Don't worry, old child."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"I've still a dress-suit."</p>

  <p>She flung her arms around him and kissed him.</p>

  <p>"Catch my lord and master for me," she told him.</p>

  <p>While Vera was quaking at the realisation that, for the first time in her
  life, she stood without the Law, Charlie had recovered his spirits. He had a
  mercurial temperament, which responded to every fluctuation of fortune; he
  was just as proud and optimistic when little Charlie Baxter&mdash;ten years
  old, or well within the age-limit&mdash;won five shillings for his correct
  cross-word, as when his outsider romped home.</p>

  <p>He welcomed Vera and her grease-paints when she came to make him up for
  his last public appearance in Starminster. His confidence in her robbed him
  of fear of consequences. He would not have to share any of the suspense of
  the ceremony, but would be left behind in the cottage&mdash;fifty pounds in
  his pocket-book, and London ahead of him.</p>

  <p>He talked and laughed, while Vera snarled at him to keep his head still.
  She was strung up to a pitch of nerves which was comparable with the
  first-night agony of a star actress.</p>

  <p>Everything went wrong. Her fingers shook and fumbled her effects. She knew
  the curtain would go up before she was ready. Her cue would find her
  tongue-tied and dried-up. The gate creaked open and she heard footsteps and
  voices in the garden, just as she was settling Charlie inside the shell.</p>

  <p>On his way up the narrow staircase, the undertaker heard the widow
  coughing, and decided that her cold was worse. When he entered the dimly-lit
  room, she was leaning over the shell and holding back a fold of cotton-wool,
  while she kissed her husband's waxen brow.</p>

  <p>The next moment, she covered up his face again and turned appealingly to
  the men.</p>

  <p>"Have you come <i>already</i>? Oh, please, give me just five minutes more,
  <i>alone</i>, with him." She turned to Puggie. "You promised me."</p>

  <p>Puggie caught the undertaker's arm and literally tugged him out of the
  room, including the men in his drive.</p>

  <p>"It's his love-letters," he explained. "She wants to put them in the
  coffin. Definitely touching, what? Come into the dining-room, all of you, and
  have a spot to keep out the cold."</p>

  <p>The prospect of the bleak atmosphere of the cemetery made the invitation
  welcome, and they all clumped down the stairs again.</p>

  <p>As their steps were growing fainter, Vera was pulling Charlie out of the
  shell, in fierce excitement.</p>

  <p>"Be careful," she urged. "You fool, you'll have it over."</p>

  <p>She caught the shell as it tilted perilously, and then dropped to her
  knees, to help pull the dummy from under the bed. It was apparently heavier,
  and it sagged in the middle, as though it was on the point of bursting, like
  a cracker. They made several attempts to raise it before they succeeded in
  hoisting it inside the shell, where it bulged crookedly&mdash;its
  raspberry-pink cardboard face grinning lewdly up at them, as though in
  mockery.</p>

  <p>But once it was straightened and covered up with the layers of
  cotton-wool, it acquired miraculous dignity, and came into line with the
  desired effect. The moulding of the mask&mdash;brow, nose, and
  chin&mdash;appeared as rigid mounds, while violets and snowdrops were strewn
  over a calico heart with no betraying flutter.</p>

  <p>When the drinking-party came upstairs again Puggie spoke confidently to
  the undertaker.</p>

  <p>"Tell your men to hustle with the job. She's got a shocking cold and she
  can't stand for much more. I'll have her breaking down at the grave."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you persuade her to stay at home?" asked the undertaker.</p>

  <p>"What a hope," grimaced Puggie.</p>

  <p>Vera greeted them with a fresh burst of sobbing, which she sustained with
  a strong effort of will, as she anxiously watched the shell being placed
  inside the coffin. She had a respite while the lid was being screwed down,
  although she coughed intermittently in her fear that Charlie would
  explode.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his nerves were under his control. He was reassured by Vera's
  hacking solo; in addition, he was too conscious of the indignity of his
  position to feel any irritation in his throat.</p>

  <p>Vera, however, suffered agonies of suspense while the coffin was lifted
  and borne down the narrow stairs. She drove her nails into her palms as she
  stood and pictured every patch and slant of the awkward descent. Now that it
  was too late, she bitterly regretted her scamped stitches. She had nightmare
  visions of the weights being dislodged and rolling downwards, or banging
  against the lid.</p>

  <p>After an eternity, Puggie appeared in the doorway. He grinned and turned
  up his thumbs.</p>

  <p>"O.K. They're waiting for you."</p>

  <p>In a flash, Vera powdered her nose and tilted her Cossack cap, to reveal
  honey-gold waves of hair. Without a word to Charlie&mdash;still prostrate
  under the bed, like a lover in a French farce&mdash;she went out of the room
  with Puggie.</p>

  <p>When they reached the passage she slipped an envelope into his hand. It
  contained the balance of her hoard&mdash;four five-pound notes. He felt the
  crackle of the notes and his eyes grew moist.</p>

  <p>"Can you spare it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Fool."</p>

  <p>"Bless you, old child."</p>

  <p>He escorted her to the car and hurried back to the cottage, where he
  dashed from room to room, pulling curtains aside and snapping up blinds. When
  he reached Charlie's lair, he had no time to linger. With a hasty "Come out,"
  he thundered down the stairs and galloped out of the house, slamming to the
  spring-lock of the door.</p>

  <p>Jasmine Cottage was officially empty for a week.</p>

  <p>Charlie's funeral service was held at St. John's Church. It was a new
  building, well-warmed, and dark with stained glass. Most of the pews were
  occupied, as more evidence of his popularity.</p>

  <p>Vera made an appealing picture when she entered, leaning on Puggie's arm.
  She wore a long coat which looked like black Persian lamb, and a cap of the
  same material. Women's eyes followed her with sympathy before they&mdash;in
  their turn&mdash;gazed sadly at the coffin, which was unexpectedly long for a
  little man. It bore two wreaths&mdash;one from the widow and the other from
  Miss Baxter.</p>

  <p>In addition to the service, the Vicar spoke a few words about the
  character of the deceased, during which he quoted from Browning,
  beginning:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"But all the world's coarse thumb<br>
  And finger failed to plumb..."</p><br>

  <p>and ending with:</p>

  <p class="verse">"All I could never be,<br>
  All, men ignored in me,<br>
  This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped."</p><br>

  <p>"He's over-assessed," whispered Puggie to Vera, whose lips were quivering
  as she listened.</p>

  <p>The submerged actor in the clergyman burst loose when he recited the
  lines. He had chosen the quotation because he considered Charlie to be a
  charming fellow, of modest and unobtrusive merit, which was bound to be
  overlooked. Although the unusually large attendance at the church rather
  robbed his choice of its aptness, he would not omit it, because he was a
  lover of poetry.</p>

  <p>The strains of Chopin's Dead March wailed from the organ, and the dummy
  rolled on again on its way to the cemetery.</p>

  <p>Only a few men attended the ceremony at the grave. Puggie's spirits rose
  as each minute brought them nearer to the consummation of a successful fraud;
  but the last stages gave no relief to Vera.</p>

  <p>As she listened to the solemn words, she was horrified by a sense of her
  own sacrilege. While Puggie grinned cynically at the idea of the dummy being
  consigned to the earth, "in sure and certain hope of glorious resurrection,"
  she had a terrible vision of a grinning paste-board face shooting up, at the
  Last Trump, to testify against her.</p>

  <p>In order to shake off her obsession, she tightened her lips and began to
  think resolutely of the Insurance. Staring stonily before her, she was
  unconscious that one person had surprised her expression, that moment when
  she had been off guard.</p>

  <p>He was disgusted by this glimpse of a ruthless character, as revealed by
  hard blue eyes, which held no tinge of sorrow for a dead husband. Since his
  own marriage was ideal, his standard for a successful life-partnership was
  high. When love, or companionship was lacking, he believed that a man was
  reduced to a meal-ticket, and was better and more economically served by a
  working-housekeeper.</p>

  <p>He had always vaguely put Vera in the parasite class, partly because he
  was unfairly biased by Anita Loos' attitude to blondes, and partly because he
  had a warm liking for Charlie, based on kindred humanitarian views.</p>

  <p>Vera was unaware that she had aroused his hostility until the coffin was
  lowered into the grave. Rising to the occasion, she stifled a sob and turned
  away&mdash;her lace handkerchief pressed to her lips.</p>

  <p>As she did so, she met the penetrative gaze of the one man whom she had
  most reason to dread.</p>

  <p>It was William Acorn&mdash;the Insurance agent.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-11"
     id="ch-11"></a>XI. &mdash; A SOUVENIR</h2>

  <p class="first">MISS BELSON had been picked out from the number of anonymous
  women who mourned Charlie Baxter, because she was first to suspect any
  irregular conduct at Jasmine Cottage. Although she far overshot the mark with
  her guess of murder, when she awoke next morning, she was conscious of two
  emotions&mdash;deep distrust of Vera, and an intense pity for Charlie.</p>

  <p>As she thought of him continually through the short winter day, her memory
  proved a treacherous medium. She forgot that he was merely a sympathetic
  partner, around whom she had woven her last dream. In his place she put a
  stranger, of sweet and gentle nature&mdash;stunted by a sense of his own
  frustration, and vaguely groping for the happiness he had missed.</p>

  <p>She grew positive that his marriage was yet another secret domestic
  tragedy. Vera was a spiritual man-eater; she had not only robbed him of any
  title to individuality, but he was kept in the background, until no one
  expected anything of him but failure.</p>

  <p>Presently she worked herself up to a pitch of unreal sentimental misery,
  which was increased by a feverish cold. Although it was creeping towards its
  peak, she insisted on attending the funeral service at St. John's Church.
  When her sister, Lady Fry, questioned the wisdom of her going, she blew her
  nose.</p>

  <p>"I'll take a taxi. And the church will be warm. I&mdash;I would like to
  show our personal sympathy."</p>

  <p>Her sister creased up her soft puckered face, but finally nodded
  assent.</p>

  <p>"As long as you run no risk," she said.</p>

  <p>"I promise to wear my fur coat&mdash;and spats."</p>

  <p>The sisters did everything in comfort. They were typical of a class and
  generation which excites the rage of the younger playwrights, but which makes
  England such a pleasant residential country. They had all the faults and
  virtues of their qualities; blind beggars themselves at Judgment, they gave
  to every blind beggar in the street.</p>

  <p>Miss Belson reached the church on wheels. She was warmly wrapped up, and
  pungently scented, to safeguard the congregation from infection. But she had
  no protection against the invasion of her own imagination.</p>

  <p>The sad music, the beauty and solemnity of the service, and the general
  atmosphere of mourning, all conspired to a sense of unreality. Her world of
  First Thursdays and afternoon-tea had passed away, and nothing remained but a
  shell, filled with shadows and echoes.</p>

  <p>The life had gone from it&mdash;for Charlie&mdash;her love&mdash;was dead.
  She nearly broke down when the dummy was carried up the aisle, at the sight
  of the flower-decked coffin. After the service was over and she mingled with
  the rest of the congregation, for the first time in her life she was grateful
  for a cold, since it explained red-dimmed eyes and a husky voice.</p>

  <p>When she reached home, afternoon-tea was served immediately. In her
  arm-chair by the fire, Lady Fry waited for a description of the ceremony,
  which she could appreciate in comfort.</p>

  <p>The sisters lived in one of those pleasant houses with sunny
  morning-rooms, where well-trained housemaids bring in silver breakfast-dishes
  and are lavish with coals. To-day, the French windows showed no picture of
  thrushes picking away at the grass, but a sloppy, snow-covered lawn; so the
  housemaid wisely drew the curtains, switched on the lights, and put the day
  prematurely to bed.</p>

  <p>But neither hot tea nor crumpets could raise Miss Belson's spirits, as she
  conscientiously fed her sister with details of Charlie Baxter's funeral
  service.</p>

  <p>"The Vicar spoke so nicely of him. He quoted from 'Rabbi Ben Ezra'."</p>

  <p>"Did he?" Lady Fry pursed her lips. "Browning, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Shall I find the bit for you?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you. You'll find him by Tennyson."</p>

  <p>While Miss Belson was flicking over the pages, she dipped into another
  poem. "Too Late" had caught her eye by its title, and a couple of lines
  gripped her attention.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"The woman is dead that is none of his;<br>
  And the man that was none of hers may go."</p><br>

  <p>It was so painfully apposite to her own case that she felt unable to trust
  her voice.</p>

  <p>"You'd better have the book," she said to her sister. "I'd only murder it
  with my croak."</p>

  <p>Lady Fry, who firmly believed that all poetry had to be read aloud,
  wheezed pluckily through the quotation.</p>

  <p>"Beautiful," she declared. "I can <i>hear</i> the Vicar. Poor Mr.
  Baxter...Isn't it sad how soon one forgets faces. I've been trying to
  remember his, all the afternoon. What <i>was</i> he like?"</p>

  <p>Miss Belson began to catalogue his features, only to realise, to her
  dismay, that Charlie's face was not quite clear to her.</p>

  <p>"It's no good," declared Lady Fry, shaking her head. "I never had a memory
  for faces. It's our family failing. I must ask Mrs. Baxter if she has a
  photograph of him that she can spare."</p>

  <p>Miss Belson mumbled an agreement. Her temperature was still rising, while
  an adapted line from "Too Late" kept ringing through her head like the
  tolling of a funeral-bell.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"The man is dead that was none of hers."</p><br>

  <p>Suddenly she felt she could endure the warmth and comfort of the room no
  longer. It was a padded trap where she had no space to turn and lick her
  wounds. She had an elemental craving for darkness. In the bitter twilight
  outside, she could walk off her fever.</p>

  <p>Lady Fry gave her an opportunity by complaining that she had finished her
  novel.</p>

  <p>"I'll get you another from the Library," offered Miss Belson.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. But I'll only let you go on condition that you take a
  taxi."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes."</p>

  <p>Miss Belson did not keep her promise. Directly she was through the front
  door, she forgot the book. Instead of going in the direction of the town,
  where the pavements had been cleared of snow, she tramped over icy,
  semi-liquid slush, towards the country.</p>

  <p>She could not visit the cemetery; but she felt an overpowering wish to
  gaze at the empty house where Charlie had so lately lived. When she reached
  it, there was still enough light lingering in the sky for her to see that the
  windows were dead, while no smoke curled up from its chimneys.</p>

  <p>As she stood, as though rooted to the road, and stared at it, she told
  herself that some vital part of Charlie might yet be lingering within those
  walls. If she were inside, she might make a farewell contact with his
  spirit.</p>

  <p>Even as the thought flashed through her head, she felt herself drawn
  forward by the force of her hysteria. Through the gate, up the flagged path,
  on to the doorstep. Her fingers pressed the glass panels of the little
  green-painted door.</p>

  <p>An electric thrill shot through her when it yielded to her touch. For a
  moment she wondered whether she, too, were invisible, and passing through a
  locked barrier, like smoke.</p>

  <p>Then she came down to earth and realised that she was on the point of
  making an unpardonable intrusion on the widow's privacy. She had understood
  from a remark she had overheard in the church porch, that Vera Baxter was
  going away; but it was evident that some one was misinformed.</p>

  <p>"I'll ask her for a photograph now, before she goes away," she decided.
  "I'll say it's for my sister. She was so composed in the church that I'm sure
  she will understand. Besides, I ought to see if anything's wrong."</p>

  <p>Even while she framed excuses Miss Belson knew that she was feeding
  herself with lies. <i>Someone</i> was inside&mdash;but it was not Vera...Some
  power, too, was drawing her within, whispering in her ear, telling her not to
  break the silence by ringing the bell.</p>

  <p>Holding her breath, she pushed open the door wider and slipped into the
  darkness of the passage. To her right was a gleam of comparative brightness,
  which marked the drawing-room window. Fearfully expectant, she entered,
  creeping on her toes over the worn Brussels carpet.</p>

  <p>In the snow-reflected light, the place looked neglected and dreary. Its
  atmosphere was sour and cold. White chrysanthemums, with browning petals, and
  slimed stalks, stood in a clouded glass vase. The ashes of a dead fire choked
  the grate.</p>

  <p>Yet, in spite of its desolation, Miss Belson had a feeling that the room
  had recently been tenanted. It's air vibrated slightly, as though disturbed
  but a few moments ago. On the table was an ash-tray which held a half-smoked
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>When she picked it up, she imagined that the stump was still warm. Then
  her common sense assured her that the glow was only her fancy, and she gazed
  at it with tear-filmed eyes. She wondered if it was the last cigarette he had
  smoked. Since she had never seen his odious friend&mdash;Puggie
  Williams&mdash;without a pipe locked between his teeth, she was on the point
  of taking it, as a souvenir, until she remembered that Vera had probably left
  it there.</p>

  <p>There was no photograph of Charlie in the room, and yet she felt his
  presence. Upstairs, where he had died, the influence would be stronger. She
  might get in touch with him&mdash;join hands with him across the gulf of the
  grave.</p>

  <p>She remembered that there was a snap of him stuck in the looking-glass in
  one of the bedrooms. On the sole occasion when she had been at a bridge-party
  at Jasmine Cottage, she had noticed it as she was removing her wraps. It was
  of no value and would never be missed; but it would be her most precious
  souvenir. As long as it was hers, his features would never fade in her
  memory.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she decided to get it. It was a daring resolution, for, while she
  remained near the front door, her presence admitted some explanation. But if
  she went up the stairs, she was definitely a trespasser.</p>

  <p>She stood in the hall for several minutes, listening intently for some
  sound or movement. As the silence was unbroken, she plucked up her courage
  and began to creep up the narrow stairs. Half-way up, a hyacinth-bell lay on
  one of the trends, and when she reached the landing, more bruised petals,
  scattered on the carpet of the nearest bedroom, marked the death-chamber.</p>

  <p>She tiptoed inside, her heart knocking in irregular beats. The first thing
  which caught her eye was the denuded bed, covered only with a linen
  sheet.</p>

  <p>At the sight of it, she nearly broke down. Blinded with tears, she looked
  for the snapshot, which was no longer stuck in the frame of the mirror. She
  could not find it, however, although she opened the drawers of the
  toilet-table, as she gradually grew bolder.</p>

  <p>She dared not linger. At any moment some one might come and surprise her
  in her search. Hurry&mdash;hurry. Her cheeks scorched and her hands trembled,
  as her temperature flared up into fever.</p>

  <p>Here, too, as in the drawing-room, was that odd sensation of suspended
  habitation. A massive mahogany press, hung with clothing, swung open, in
  proof that some one had recently selected or put away some garment. The empty
  house was still occupied.</p>

  <p>"I feel he is near," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she heard faint sounds from somewhere in the well of the house; a
  scrape was followed by a dull thud, as though some one had cautiously opened
  the front door and shut it again.</p>

  <p>In a panic, she pressed her hand to her heart, to still its gallop.</p>

  <p>"Imagination," she told herself.</p>

  <p>She knew that all noises were magnified in an empty house. A mouse had
  scampered across the hall. That was all. But it was time for her to get away,
  while the road to escape was still open.</p>

  <p>She was crossing to the door, when she distinctly recognised muffled
  footsteps down in the passage below. They grew nearer as they began to mount
  the stairs.</p>

  <p>Her eyes flickered around her, seeking somewhere to hide; but her muscles
  seemed locked, so that she could not stir. The blood drained away from her
  head and she stood and stared at the open doorway&mdash;not knowing what she
  feared.</p>

  <p>A dead man in his shroud, with blank eye-sockets&mdash;or Vera in the
  ultra-sophistication of the living, challenging her intrusion.</p>

  <p>Before she was aware of its coming, the terror rushed upon her. Out of the
  shadows in the landing, rose a white face, with gleaming eyes and a dark
  pointed beard.</p>

  <p>As she stared at it, she pressed her fingers to her lips to keep back her
  screams. In a dim corner of her brain, she realised that things happened and
  ended, before she knew they had begun.</p>

  <p>There was a rush of darkness which pressed her backwards and downwards
  into complete oblivion. But, before the final black-out, her blunted mind
  jolted back to the first shock of recognition.</p>

  <p>She had seen Charles Baxter.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-12"
     id="ch-12"></a>XII. &mdash; OH, THE MISTLETOE-BOUGH</h2>

  <p class="first">IN a panic, Charlie Baxter turned the key of the press and
  dashed through the bedroom door. Not until he was outside did he feel safe in
  any degree. As he stood on the landing, listening, he drew his hands across
  his glistening brow. His knees were shaking and his heart thumping from
  shock.</p>

  <p>He had been strolling about the empty house, feeling secure in his
  privacy, when, suddenly, he realised that his stronghold had been invaded. An
  intruder had crept in, unawares, and penetrated to the very core of his
  retreat&mdash;his own bedroom.</p>

  <p>In that moment, he saw their fine venture fired and shooting up like a
  rocket, in a tearing scream across the night-sky. Nothing would remain but
  exposure and ruin. Although he was too flurried to recognise the woman, her
  face was vaguely familiar, and it was clear that she had no doubt of his
  identity.</p>

  <p>To make the catastrophe worse, he was conscious that he was doubly to
  blame. In the first place, he had opened the front door, against orders; but
  even that lapse might not have proved fatal, if he had followed Vera's
  instructions to remove his beard immediately. Had the lady, now in the
  wardrobe, glimpsed an unfamiliar clean-shaven face, there might be some hope
  of evading the consequences.</p>

  <p>But he had been betrayed by his own sense of dignity. He paid the rent and
  was master of the house; yet he had been forced to the ignominy of hiding
  under a bed. Puggie Williams, in his gallop round the premises, had spoken to
  him as though he were a dog.</p>

  <p>"Come out."</p>

  <p>It was enough to make any man of spirit stay where he was, until the
  unbroken silence assured him there would be no one to ridicule him when he
  crawled out, on his stomach.</p>

  <p>Once he had straightened himself, he felt a novel sense of liberty and
  peace. There was no Vera to prod him about like a dummy&mdash;no Puggie to
  grin and swill his whisky. There was not even a maid clattering about in the
  kitchen. Although he knew he had to shave, ultimately, he put off the evil
  day.</p>

  <p>Henceforth, he would obey no more orders. In this case, the decision
  involved the trouble of hanging up a rug before the bathroom window, so that
  he was not dependent on the daylight, but could switch on the current in
  safety. Afterwards, he strolled over the house, keeping well away from the
  windows. It was a treat to see the drawing-room again, and he lingered there
  to smoke a cigarette. When he was tired, he went into the kitchen and spent a
  couple of hours of blissful sloth before the warmth of the open
  gas-stove.</p>

  <p>He was on his way upstairs to prepare for the final stages of departure,
  when he saw, through the window, a robin hopping about under a bush. In this
  corner of the garden, the snow had melted, so that there was a sheltered
  circle of bare earth.</p>

  <p>His eyes grew soft as he watched it. He told himself that it was probably
  one of the pensioners and that it would miss the daily dole. The least he
  could do, in the cause of humanity, was to place the remains of the loaf
  under the bush, as a larder for the birds.</p>

  <p>The difficulty was how to reach the spot unseen, for the back door faced
  that of the neighbouring house and was exposed to prying eyes. If, however,
  he could slip out of the front door and creep round by the side passage, he
  would be sheltered by the wall. There was only the hundredth chance of being
  seen, for Jasmine Cottage was the last house in the town&mdash;or the first,
  as the case might be. In addition, it was growing dark, and in the state of
  the roads no one was likely to take a country stroll.</p>

  <p>He carried through his mission in safety. No one saw him come or go. Just
  as he vanished round the corner of the house, Miss Belson reached the cottage
  and stared up at its windows. She entered and was dreaming in the
  sitting-room, while he returned and silently darted down the passage back to
  the kitchen.</p>

  <p>Their movements dovetailed with the precision of a carefully rehearsed
  French farce. In her turn, the lady mounted the stairs up to the bedroom.</p>

  <p>And now&mdash;Charlie Baxter was waiting outside, listening for the
  inevitable scream and wondering how he should meet the situation.</p>

  <p>As the silence remained unbroken, his confidence began to sprout again.
  Once again, things had been so easy. The woman had stood with her back to the
  press, when he made his instinctive rush forward. Instead of putting up any
  fight, she had crumpled back before his push, like a puff-ball.</p>

  <p>He waited a little longer, and then he went into the bathroom, carefully
  shutting the door before he switched on the light.</p>

  <p>"Thank heavens," he thought, "I didn't have to hurt her. I <i>couldn't</i>
  be cruel to a woman."</p>

  <p>With a feeling of gratitude, he reminded himself that he had used
  practically no force, while the wardrobe was roomy and well-lined with
  hanging garments. She must have fallen soft. There would be neither bruise
  nor scratch. Undoubtedly she had a fright, but that in itself was merciful,
  since it would act as an antidote to any discomfort.</p>

  <p>Gripping the scissors resolutely, he began to clip away his beard. As he
  did so, the smudged reflection of a younger face became visible, as though
  mirrored in wavering water. His eyes lit up at the sight, and again he
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I fed the birds," he thought.</p>

  <p>When he was a child, an old nurse had told him that kind people always
  prospered. He remembered her remark, and felt that this little action was a
  lucky prelude to the adventure.</p>

  <p>Covering his face with a lather, he began to scrape away his stubble. It
  proved not only a difficult job but a painful one, especially around the
  lips, where the skin had been pulled by the weight of his moustache and was
  particularly tender.</p>

  <p>He was so engrossed that he scarcely noticed a muffled knocking not far
  away. When, at last, he realised its source, he had become accustomed to
  it.</p>

  <p>"She's all right," he muttered impatiently.</p>

  <p>Little by little, his youth was returning to him. He tingled with
  excitement as he wiped away the soap and looked at his face in the glass. He
  had almost forgotten the curves of his lips and the cleft in his chin.</p>

  <p>Yet, in spite of his own approval, he knew that it was the old Charlie
  Baxter who always slunk past the nice girls at home. Putting on his glasses,
  he received his first glimpse of Chester Beaverbrook.</p>

  <p>As he stared at himself in the glass, his self-satisfaction grew, for he
  felt vaguely the stimulus of borrowed brain. He told himself that he looked
  positively brainy&mdash;a chap who could pass examinations as easily as
  picking up sixpence.</p>

  <p>With fresh confidence he thought of the future. A new adventure stretched
  before him. He had fifty pounds to burn. A succession of dreams shifted
  through his mind; but, when the other women began to slip in, he turned them
  out resolutely.</p>

  <p>He was married to Vera; at least, he recognised the validity of the
  bond&mdash;whatever his legal position might be.</p>

  <p>"I'll never let a woman down," he resolved. "No, not even my wife."</p>

  <p>By now he had grown deaf to the intermittent knocking from the big
  bedroom. The sounds were muted by the locked doors. So long as the woman did
  not scream, he had nothing to fear. But if he were compelled to gag her,
  there might be a struggle; and he shrank in every fibre from the mere
  suggestion of rough treatment.</p>

  <p>Women were meant for tenderness. Besides, he had a vague recollection of
  her face when she stared at him. It was white and creased, like soft scented
  paper. He was sure that her body would be boneless, to correspond.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for his peace of mind, the knocking ceased. Miss Belson was
  growing exhausted, while her fingers were sore and bruised.</p>

  <p>She had recovered consciousness to find herself doubled up, at the bottom
  of the wardrobe&mdash;gasping for air and half-stifled by hanging garments.
  In the first shock of realising that she was imprisoned, she had gone mad.
  She tore at the door with her nails, battered it with her fists, and even
  butted it with her forehead.</p>

  <p>After the fit had spent itself, she tried to remember what had happened.
  Presently she had a clouded memory of some terrible shock which had
  overwhelmed her with supernatural awe.</p>

  <p>She believed she had seen Charlie Baxter...But he was dead&mdash;while, in
  life, he was gentle and courteous&mdash;the last person to play this hideous
  trick upon her. Besides, it was now unimportant how she got inside the press.
  What really mattered was how to get out again.</p>

  <p>It was terribly clear that her own efforts were wasted. She licked her dry
  lips and tried to predict the future. She would not be missed, probably,
  until dinner-time. The parlourmaid put out her mistresses' dinner gowns on
  the bed before she laid the table, but her duties ended there.</p>

  <p>It would be assumed that she had returned from the Library and was resting
  in her room. Later, when her absence was discovered, there would be guarded
  inquiries of their friends over the telephone. As her sister's fright
  increased, she would send a frantic S.O.S. to the police. They would think
  she had been knocked down by a car, and the streets and byways would be
  searched from end to end.</p>

  <p>But the one place they would never dream of looking for her was inside a
  locked wardrobe in Jasmine Cottage.</p>

  <p>At the thought, Miss Belson began to beat again on the door. She kicked
  until her toes were stubbed. It was useless to try to scream for the cold had
  affected her vocal chords, so that she could only croak.</p>

  <p>This time, Charlie did not hear her, for he had gone into the
  dressing-room to change. For one ghastly moment he was afraid that he would
  have to open the wardrobe, and he decided&mdash;whatever the risk&mdash;to
  retain his old suit. Then he remembered that Vera had packed his suitcase in
  readiness, and laid out his new outfit.</p>

  <p>He did not dislike the sporting clothes so much, now that he had got rid
  of his beard. He felt they lent him swagger and poise. With a confident smile
  he buttoned his full-belted coat and then glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>Time to start. He had eaten Vera's sandwiches, and nothing remained to be
  done. All the same, at the back of his mind was some teasing reminder. He
  knew that he could not walk out of Jasmine Cottage and lock it up behind him
  without first taking some precautionary steps.</p>

  <p>But whatever safeguard he had subconsciously planned&mdash;for the moment,
  it had slipped from his memory. He told himself that he had switched off the
  bathroom light&mdash;turned out the gas in the oven, and the water at the
  main. There was no pets to be considered. The Ideal stove was out.</p>

  <p>Shrugging his shoulders, he crept carefully down the dark passage and
  cautiously opened the front door. Upstairs, Miss Belson heard the closing
  squeak and the scrape of the garden gate.</p>

  <p>The blood rushed up to her head, as the dull gossip of the churchyard
  suddenly developed acute interest. Some one had said that Mrs. Baxter was
  going to stay with Sir Horace and Lady Wright, for a week. She had also heard
  that Mr. Williams had already gone away. The maid, too, was on holiday.</p>

  <p>Jasmine Cottage would be empty for seven days.</p>

  <p>At the thought she went mad again, vainly trying to scream and break down
  the door. She was trapped in a modern version of the Legend of the Mistletoe
  Bough&mdash;doomed to the same fate as the bride who had hidden in the oak
  chest. On her return Mrs. Baxter would open the wardrobe casually and get the
  fright of her life.</p>

  <p>Miss Belson began to feel the first symptoms of suffocation. She seemed to
  be eating the air in sour mouthfuls. Her forehead and hands were slimed with
  moisture&mdash;her heart was leaping feebly&mdash;her head was being
  constricted within iron bands. She heard a curious husky croup and an
  intermittent beating like the tapping of a woodpecker, but she did not know
  that she was their source.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a different noise&mdash;the unmistakable scrape of the
  garden gate. It was followed by the stealthy opening and closing of the front
  door. Some one was entering Jasmine Cottage.</p>

  <p>Miss Belson felt the thrill of new hope. They had missed her at home and
  traced her here. The house would be searched, room by room. She must wait
  until the rescue-party grew nearer, and reserve her strength for a last
  furious assault on the wardrobe panels.</p>

  <p>Even as the thought entered her brain, her head fell forward on her breast
  and she fainted.</p>

  <p>Downstairs, in the kitchen, Charlie took down the household tablet and
  began to scribble a message to Vera.</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness I remembered in time," he murmured.</p>

  <p>He had splashed for several yards down the York Road and passed the last
  lamp-post, when he stopped short, at a sudden recollection.</p>

  <p>At the risk of throwing their time-table out of gear, he turned back
  immediately. Years ago, when he was a small boy, his eldest sister, Emily,
  had read him a lecture on lack of thought, which, she declared, was the cause
  of most cruelty. Now it bore fruit&mdash;making him determined that the
  innocent should not suffer through his neglect.</p>

  <p>He laid down the scrawl on the table.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget to feed the birds."</p>

  <p>A little later Miss Belson struggled out of her faint and strained to
  listen for the sound of footsteps and voices.</p>

  <p>But the cottage was silent. There was no light, no hope, no star in the
  blackness of the abyss.</p>

  <p>What she suffered afterwards was never known.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-13"
     id="ch-13"></a>XIII. &mdash; CHARGE&mdash;CHESTER&mdash;CHARGE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE glow of his kindly action remained with Charlie Baxter
  as he plunged into the darkness of the York Road. It was not until the slush
  penetrated his boots that he began to lose his exaltation and to wonder what
  had become of Puggie Williams' car.</p>

  <p>Striking a match to look at his watch, he saw that it was past seven.
  According to schedule, Puggie was to leave the Grapes at six forty-five. As
  Charlie was on foot, and had made one false start, he counted on being picked
  up almost immediately.</p>

  <p>So far, there was practically no traffic on the York Road. A motor-lorry
  and a fast saloon-car had both, in turn, splashed him, as a delicate
  compliment to the endurance of a pedestrian. Otherwise, there was no sign of
  life, and no sound, save the dripping of the hedges.</p>

  <p>Standing still to wait for the car made his feet so numb that he was
  forced to plod on again. There was no indication of the footpath, so that
  sometimes he stepped off it into the deeper slush which had collected in the
  camber of the road. As he slipped and sweated, he discovered that he was in
  bad condition, which was not surprising, considering his recent
  experiences.</p>

  <p>He told himself bleakly that&mdash;once again&mdash;he had to bear the
  whole brunt of the venture. Puggie had cast himself for the cushy parts. He
  was warm, well-fed, and travelling dry-shod, while Charlie was not only tired
  and hungry, but was growing acutely worried.</p>

  <p>When he reached the first milestone, he paused to look round, but he could
  see no headlights shining through the darkness. Puggie was now considerably
  overdue. When he speculated on the causes of the delay, he had a choice of
  contingencies which did not tend to reassure him.</p>

  <p>At the best, the old crock might have developed engine-trouble. But it was
  more likely that Puggie was drunk. Either he had not started at all, or he
  might have crashed on his way to keep his appointment.</p>

  <p>There was another possibility which made his upper-lip break out into a
  sweat. Puggie and Vera might have conspired to give him the slip. When they
  whispered together in corners, they might have been planning to send him
  trudging along the York Road, on a fool's errand.</p>

  <p>He was entirely at their mercy&mdash;unable to retreat or advance. If he
  went back to Starminster Station, he ran the risk of being recognised. On the
  other hand, it was impossible to reach York on foot; and he dared not flag a
  passing car, lest the motorist should be a local man.</p>

  <p>Charlie Baxter was dead. He had been buried that same afternoon. And he
  had to remain in the ground&mdash;or chance the consequence of prison.</p>

  <p>Even as Charlie cursed the treachery of his accomplices, he heard a
  familiar rattle in the distance. Presently there was a glow of headlights,
  and then the battered grey Buick gave him a welcome baptism of slush.</p>

  <p>"Hop in," shouted Puggie.</p>

  <p>Charlie climbed in stiffly, too relieved to protest.</p>

  <p>"Thought you were never going to show up," he said, as he sank back in his
  seat and gratefully watched the roughish grey-white slide of road before
  them, which they never seemed to reach.</p>

  <p>"Bit late?" asked Puggie. "I wanted to let you get well away. Thought some
  one might see me fish you up if I stopped just outside the town. But, on my
  Sam, you look so definitely doggy that I had a job to recognise you
  myself."</p>

  <p>Charlie thawed at the note of admiration in Puggie's voice.</p>

  <p>"Did my funeral go off all right?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Top-hole. We managed to do without you quite well."</p>

  <p>"Many people there?"</p>

  <p>"Full house. The parson quoted poetry about you."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Forgotten. Something about your being thumbed about. But the general
  drift was complimentary...What are you shivering for?"</p>

  <p>"I'm cold," quavered Charlie. "I walked on, and on, wondering if you meant
  to turn up."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i>? You thought me that sort of dirty dog?
  Well&mdash;I'm&mdash;Is that how you'd treat a pal yourself?"</p>

  <p>Puggie's indignation seemed so genuine that Charlie felt ashamed.</p>

  <p>"I was a bit late," went on Puggie, "because it took a dickens of a time
  saying 'Good-bye' at the Grapes. You've got to hand it to me, I've kept up
  your local pubs. They didn't like to see me go. It was like seeing money
  walking out of the till. And they all wanted to stand me one, because they
  knew just how badly I was feeling about poor little Charlie Baxter...My pal.
  I liked that little chap. Only hope I'll like Mr. Chester Beaverbrook,
  Esquire, one-half as well."</p>

  <p>"You may not have a chance to like him," said Charlie. "We part at York,
  don't we?"</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, you'll be seeing me all right. I promised Vera I wouldn't go
  out of her young life."</p>

  <p>Charlie set his lips, and smiled slightly as he stared at the elusive
  strip of illuminated road.</p>

  <p>"When shall we reach York?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Too late now for you to make your connection. Fact is, Charlie, I thought
  Vera was handing you a raw deal when she arranged for you to go up to London
  on the night train. This way, you can stop the night in York and travel up in
  comfort, to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>Puggie's benevolent-uncle voice infuriated Charlie.</p>

  <p>"That has been my intention all along," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>Puggie turned round to stare at the clean-shaven face, which had grown
  unfamiliar.</p>

  <p>"It must be the glasses," he muttered.</p>

  <p>He had the uneasy feeling that he was driving a complete stranger.
  Charlie's persistent silence was so uncharacteristic that presently he grew
  anxious to hear his voice again.</p>

  <p>"How did things go off your end?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly all right, thanks."</p>

  <p>Charlie naturally repressed the incident of the woman who had crashed
  Jasmine Cottage. As a matter of fact, she grew more unreal with each receding
  milestone. Starminster was fast slipping away behind him. He would never see
  it again, or any of its residents.</p>

  <p>His mind could only deal with one fact at a time.</p>

  <p>At the moment, he was determined to assert himself in the matter of Vera's
  relations with Puggie.</p>

  <p>"I'll send you the <i>Herald</i> with the account of your funeral,"
  offered Puggie to break a pause.</p>

  <p>"Don't trouble, thanks. I can buy a copy for myself."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a blooming fool. You don't want to do a blessed thing which
  connects you with Starminster. You've never heard of the blasted place.
  See?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to remember it." Charlie's voice vibrated with passion. "Two
  long years of masquerade. Making myself cheap to inferior minds. People who
  read the <i>Mail</i> instead of the <i>Post.</i> Looking like a French artist
  with that comic beard. But what sticks in my throat is the ghastly
  humiliation of the end."</p>

  <p>Puggie was taken aback by the outburst.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're kicking about," he said.</p>

  <p>"No? Well, you'll hear now. I've been saving up this for a long time,
  only&mdash;only I didn't want a scene before Vera...I don't like you,
  Williams. I don't like the way you carry on with my wife. In future, we're
  through. Understand?"</p>

  <p>With a loud laugh, Puggie braked with dangerous suddenness.</p>

  <p>"Through, are we? All right, hop out and walk to York. Little man, you're
  going to have a busy night."</p>

  <p>To his relief, Charlie echoed his laugh.</p>

  <p>"I was only kidding," he explained.</p>

  <p>"Course you were, old chap. I knew that all along. We'll hit the high
  spots up in London together. Hey?"</p>

  <p>"Rather. Do you mind if I take a nap? I've been too uncomfortable to sleep
  properly, of late."</p>

  <p>It was the old good-natured Charlie who spoke&mdash;ready to forgive
  insults and humble in his appreciation of benefits. He sank his chin inside
  the collar of his coat and closed his eyes, lulled by the throb of the
  engine. Whenever he opened his lids the same patch of pitted snow lay in
  front of them, its edges flowing over invisible rollers. Presently he dropped
  into a deep sleep, untroubled by any memory of something he had overlooked in
  Jasmine Cottage.</p>

  <p>He woke up when the car was passing through the mean outskirts of a large
  town. He saw chimneys, shop-windows, and the glittering front of a cinema,
  where a gigantic poster of Mae West invited and rejected him, in the same
  baffling smile.</p>

  <p>"Better drop off, now, Charlie," said Puggie. "You'll find plenty of cheap
  hotels near the station. Better make an early start."</p>

  <p>He did not notice that his passenger made no comment on his advice. When
  he stopped the car, he gripped Charlie's shoulder with emotional
  friendship.</p>

  <p>"Well, we've put it over, old man. We've a right to feel proud of
  ourselves, eh? I'll be seeing you. Here's my address. I'll be in touch with
  Vera, and can write her if you get in a jam."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Williams."</p>

  <p>Charlie got out of the car and placed his suitcase upon the pavement, to
  leave his hands free. Standing underneath a lamp-post, he tore the card in
  fragments. Although he did not turn his head, he hoped his action had been
  seen and understood.</p>

  <p>It was not until the Buick had disappeared, that he realised that he had
  destroyed one link which bound him with safety.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-14"
     id="ch-14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE END OF THE SEARCH</h2>

  <p class="first">CHARLIE enjoyed his first night of liberty in a first-class
  railway hotel. For two years he had been unused to luxury. After the chill
  and inconvenience of Jasmine Cottage, he was keenly appreciative of the thick
  carpets, deep chairs, central-heating, and concealed lighting of the
  lounge.</p>

  <p>He experienced a slight quiver of apprehension when he signed his new
  name&mdash;"Chester Beaverbrook"&mdash;in the register. The signature was so
  unfamiliar to him that he felt the clerk at the bureau must detect the
  imposture. But it was accepted as a matter of course.</p>

  <p>No one took the least notice of him. He was merely one of a crowd of
  floating patrons. Looking around, he realised that he was not in the
  slightest degree distinctive. There were many other clean-shaven young men
  wearing horn-rimmed spectacles and the same standardised clothes.</p>

  <p>The knowledge gave him a sense of security. He entered the marble
  magnificence of the restaurant, prepared to enjoy the excellent food in
  obscurity. By the time he had finished his meal, Starminster&mdash;and
  everybody in it&mdash;had faded like a dream.</p>

  <p>Because he could not actually see it, he believed no longer in the place.
  It was merely a meaningless name on the map of England. To him, Time was a
  sort of train, packed with episodes, which ran for ever, on and on, into the
  Past. Directly an event was over, it was borne
  away&mdash;finished&mdash;forgotten.</p>

  <p>He had no memories or regrets. But as he sat afterwards in the lounge,
  smoking a cigar and watching the traffic through the revolving-door, he let
  his mind flutter for a moment over a far-away town with sloppy streets. After
  all, a few hours ago, he had been the central figure&mdash;by deputy&mdash;of
  an impressive ceremony.</p>

  <p>"I bet they are talking of me at the Grapes, this minute," he told
  himself.</p>

  <p>In ordinary circumstances, it was a safe bet; but he would have lost his
  money. He was no longer of news-value, because the town was convulsed by the
  strange disappearance of Miss Belson.</p>

  <p>She was missed sooner than she anticipated, since Lady Fry wanted her
  novel from the Library, and sent a maid upstairs to fetch it. When the girl
  returned with the news that the bedroom was empty, her mistress puckered up
  her face in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Odd," she remarked. "Didn't you whistle a taxi for her?"</p>

  <p>"No, madam."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps she had to walk."</p>

  <p>By dinner-time Lady Fry was definitely worried, although she refused to
  admit it.</p>

  <p>"If she had met with an accident, we should have heard," she remarked.
  "Bad news soon travels. So many things could account for her absence...I'll
  have dinner, Coles."</p>

  <p>She made a plucky effort to eat, and managed to work through the courses
  to a spoonful of ginger-pudding. Then she spoke to the parlourmaid, who was
  an old and confidential servant.</p>

  <p>"My voice is too bad to phone, Coles, but I think you'd better ring up
  some of our friends. Make light of it, of course. We don't want her to feel a
  fool afterwards."</p>

  <p>Coles grasped the situation and called up several numbers with polite
  detachment. Gradually, however, her calm slipped; but Lady Fry, who sat by,
  rolling her handkerchief into a ball, appeared not to notice. When Lady
  Wright was interviewed, her voice had risen several tones.</p>

  <p>"We're getting very anxious. She was not well when she left the house.
  We've rung up the Library, but they say she didn't go there. We can't imagine
  what has become of her."</p>

  <p>"I'll speak to Sir Horace," volunteered Lady Wright.</p>

  <p>Sir Horace, who was gazing at the slim ankles of the new widow, responded
  at once to the call for service. At a ball, Miss Belson might be merely a
  middle-aged spinster, fit partner for a Charlie Baxter; but on the voting
  register, she was an influential citizen.</p>

  <p>He took a grave view of the situation.</p>

  <p>"May I advise the police station for you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Soon afterwards, the town seethed with the news. The cab-ranks, the
  hospital, the railway stations, were canvassed in vain. Presently, small
  parties went out to search lonely spots, in case she had been attacked and
  robbed.</p>

  <p>The excitement did not touch Vera, as she lay, a small pensive figure, on
  a settee. She had "put her feet up" at Lady Wright's invitation, because she
  felt she could thus keep Sir Horace at a distance, and, at the same time,
  give the desired effect of being prostrate.</p>

  <p>As a matter-of-fact, Sir Horace was behaving with tact and sympathy. He
  and his wife seemed anxious only to smooth her first few days of
  widowhood.</p>

  <p>"Cry whenever you want to," urged Lady Wright. "We shan't notice."</p>

  <p>Vera, however, felt no cause for grief, for she, too, enjoyed the novel
  luxury of her surroundings. But as the hours wore away, she became conscious
  of a wrinkle in her mind.</p>

  <p>She began to wonder if Charlie had left behind him, at the cottage, any
  incriminating evidence of his survival.</p>

  <p>His dominant quality was an entire lack of imagination. He did things
  without any thought of consequences, or of their effect on others.</p>

  <p>"If he can ball things up, just at the end, trust him to do it," she
  thought bitterly.</p>

  <p>She racked her brain in vain for some excuse to return home. She did not
  want to forfeit this valuable hospitality, which she hoped to extend beyond
  the week, if she could preserve the balance between Sir Horace and his wife.
  It was especially useful at this crisis, because she would have to budget
  very carefully, since she had made over her nest-egg to Puggie Williams.</p>

  <p>Presently Sir Horace gave her the chance she wanted.</p>

  <p>"How are we going to amuse this little lady?" He appealed to his wife.
  "She mustn't mope."</p>

  <p>"Would you like something exciting to read?" asked Lady Wright.</p>

  <p>Vera shook her head and touched her eyes, in explanation.</p>

  <p>"My eyes ache. Crying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. Of course. And you're hardly in the mood for billiards. Or
  bridge?"</p>

  <p>Since she could not be sure of winning, Vera was not.</p>

  <p>"What I really need is exercise," she said. "Would you mind if I went for
  a walk?"</p>

  <p>Sir Horace's eyes lit up as he made his counter-suggestion.</p>

  <p>"If you want to tire yourself out for a good night's sleep, there's
  nothing like a swim. Our bath is one of the seven wonders of
  Starminster&mdash;and we don't use it to keep the coals in. Ha, ha. It's
  warmed, of course. It's our hobby&mdash;swimming. Nothing to touch it for the
  figure. And the fatter you are the better you swim."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Lady Wright, "only I'm afraid my costumes won't fit Mrs.
  Baxter. My husband wants me to keep a selection for our guests. But it's too
  much like bad books, where the host always keeps ladies' pyjamas in
  stock."</p>

  <p>"I'd love to swim," said Vera eagerly. "Will you let me run over to the
  cottage, to get my suit?"</p>

  <p>"Rogers will drive you over," decided Sir Horace. "We'll have an early
  dinner, so as to allow plenty of time before going into the water...And now,
  if my guest will excuse me, I must ring up my London office."</p>

  <p>His excellent spirits made Vera feel sure that he was looking forward to a
  close-up of her in a swimming-suit.</p>

  <p>"The fat fool doesn't know that he could have seen me, wearing a string
  only, for a bob," she reflected cynically. "What a waste for him."</p>

  <p>The pampered chauffeur did not relish his orders to drive Mrs. Baxter to
  Jasmine Cottage, since he had made another date. He scorched down the
  slippery drive, and on the bend, contrived a sensational skid. Although he
  pulled the car round immediately, Vera whistled down the tube.</p>

  <p>"Please don't be funny again," she said. "This is not exactly a joy-ride.
  You may have heard a rumour I buried my husband this afternoon."</p>

  <p>Her protest was made chiefly on Charlie's behalf. That swerve had made her
  realise his dependent position.</p>

  <p>"If anything happened to me now," she reflected, "he'd be in a ghastly
  hole when his money was gone. He can't work. And he can't ask his family for
  help, because he's not alive."</p>

  <p>It was a relief to remember that Puggie had promised to keep in touch with
  him. She dared not write to him directly. It was so novel an experience to be
  outside the law, that she had an exaggerated terror of its power. They were
  three impudent sparrows who had pecked the giant of insurance. She could not
  rid herself of the suspicion that they had not really got away with it. Some
  force held them at the end of an elastic string. Probably all her
  correspondence and movements would be watched for the next few weeks at
  least.</p>

  <p>She started at the sight of a group of men who were flashing
  electric-torches as they walked along a dark suburban road. A fear shot
  through her that the exhumation-party was already on its way to investigate
  the corpse.</p>

  <p>Again she whistled down the tube.</p>

  <p>"What are those men doing?"</p>

  <p>"Very likely they're looking for Miss Belson," was the reply. "It's all
  over the town that she's been kidnapped or murdered."</p>

  <p>He stopped before Jasmine Cottage and Vera got out of the car. This time,
  there was plenty of noise&mdash;the running of the engine, the clatter of
  high heels on the path, the opening of the front door; but Miss Belson did
  not hear them.</p>

  <p>When it was inhabited by four adults, the cottage had seemed a cheerful
  bandbox to Vera. She had never realised how lonely and sinister it could
  appear in the dark. But a job had to be done, and she was too plucky to shirk
  her responsibility. Switching on the lights, she went from room to room,
  hunting for traces of Charlie.</p>

  <p>When she reached the kitchen, she found his note about the birds.</p>

  <p>"The utter fool," she cried. "His own writing, too."</p>

  <p>After she had burned it, she continued her search. Loose boards creaked
  under her tread as she mounted the narrow stairs, and she could not help
  thinking of unpleasant subjects, such as murdered spinsters.</p>

  <p>The glasses rattled on the shelf when she entered the bathroom. Here was
  even more damaging evidence of her late husband. He had wrapped the clippings
  of his beard in tissue paper, and left the parcel on the rim of the
  lavatory-basin.</p>

  <p>Although she knew the chauffeur must be growing impatient, she could not
  feel safe until she had destroyed the relics on the top of the Ideal stove.
  When she had poked the oily remains well into the dead ashes, she went
  upstairs again to find her swimming-suit.</p>

  <p>She rejected her latest costume, which was cut away so ruthlessly as to
  give the impression that its wearer was covered only by a few chancey strips
  of court-plaster, and selected a brief black slip, which could be accepted by
  her hostess, and would be acceptable to her host.</p>

  <p>As she lingered, the chauffeur impertinently sounded his horn as a hint
  for her to hurry. He had taken her measure when she reproved him for his
  swerve, and had given her the status of a gentleman's widow.</p>

  <p>To punish his impatience, Vera deliberately crossed over to the wardrobe,
  to see if she had an unfaded bathing-wrap. To her surprise, she found that it
  was locked. Turning the key, she pulled open the door, and then staggered
  back before the weight of a heavy stuffed object.</p>

  <p>Something which looked like a black bolster fell forward, slowly
  undoubled, and then lay prone upon the carpet.</p>

  <p>It was the figure of a woman with a discoloured face.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-15"
     id="ch-15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE RAILWAY-CARRIAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Charlie Baxter awoke next morning, Starminster was only
  twelve hours behind him; yet he felt the division of a gulf of centuries.
  Instead of shrinking from the dawn, in an icy room, he greeted it in a
  luxurious cubicle&mdash;centrally-heated, and lit with amber-shaded
  electric-lamps.</p>

  <p>As his suite overlooked the station, its thick glass windows were heavily
  veiled and curtained. When he tubbed in a gleaming primrose bath, he could
  hear the shrieking of engines down below, and smell the smoke rising from the
  railway.</p>

  <p>Instead of feeling confined, the change was so welcome after snowy
  landscape, that it formed part of the enchantment. He breakfasted also by
  artificial light, eating a heavy meal of bacon-and-kidneys, followed by
  marmalade and toast. Afterwards he smoked a cigar in the lounge, until it was
  time for him to start.</p>

  <p>He paid his bill, tipped well, and was escorted to the London train by an
  hotel porter, who touched his cap to him; yet he was vaguely conscious of
  some slight discontent. Later, when the town was left behind, and he was
  rushing through bleached fields, he traced his annoyance back to its
  source.</p>

  <p>During the preceding evening, when he watched the eddies of visitors
  through the revolving-door, he noticed that people looked after certain
  guests, while others attracted no attention. It was not a question of
  appearance, or clothes&mdash;but a test of personality.</p>

  <p>He had to admit that he was numbered among the nonentities. No one noticed
  his arrival or his departure. At first, he gloried in his obscurity, but
  already he was growing to resent it. Like a small boy who defied punishment
  when he borrowed his sister's nightdress, to preach to the passers-by, he
  wanted to attract attention to himself.</p>

  <p>Vera would have recognised the danger of the symptom and mentally
  sandbagged him to submission. Freed from her guardianship, he stretched out
  his feet on the opposite seat and watched the telegraph wires run
  together&mdash;to snap apart at each pole&mdash;while he dreamed futilely of
  rising to the top of the ladder.</p>

  <p>At the first stop, he jumped out and tried to buy a copy of yesterday's
  <i>Starminster Herald</i>; but the best the clerk at the book-stall could do
  was to offer to procure one. Feeling cheated out of his fame, he returned to
  his carriage to find, to his disgust, that it had been invaded by other
  passengers.</p>

  <p>He glanced, in turn, at another bespectacled young man in a belted coat, a
  meagre apple-faced country woman, a heavily veiled and powdered town lady.
  Lastly, the girl.</p>

  <p>At the first sight of her, he felt drawn by a double bond of admiration
  and attraction. She was very tall, and wore a tweed suit and top-coat to
  match, with the distinction of a mannequin showing country styles. Her dark
  hair was dressed in a small knot, and a pill-box cap was tilted over
  almond-shaped blue eyes. Her face, which was rather a full oval, had the
  bloom of health, and was only slightly touched with peach-powder and
  dark-carnation lipstick. She looked what she was&mdash;a smart rustic with a
  strong dress-sense.</p>

  <p>The shrivelled countrywoman caught her eye, grimaced at the cushion which
  bore the traces of Charlie's dusty soles, and then spoke to her.</p>

  <p>"Disgusting. It evidently never occurred to the person who wiped his boots
  on that seat, that it was intended for the use of other passengers. Curious
  mentality, isn't it, never to think of others?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly is," said the girl, crinkling up her eyes in a manner which
  was adorable to Charlie. "Disheartening, too. I don't see how there can be
  real progress with utter lack of thought."</p>

  <p>She spoke without a trace of self-consciousness, or a thought of her
  audience. The other passenger had merely struck a responsive chord, although
  she preferred debate to agreement. When the woman lapsed into platitudes, her
  replies grew briefer, and she opened her bag and drew out a notebook and
  pencil.</p>

  <p>Interested, first in ideas, and then in humanity&mdash;as types, she began
  to write.</p>

  <p>"People...A little astringent spinster. Pedantic accent, fabric gloves.
  Evidently a country schoolmistress. Too typical to be interesting...A peach
  of a middle-aged woman, with smouldering eyes under a thick veil and a
  perfect mask of pearl-powder. She should have done some equestrian act in a
  continental circus. (I think 'equestrian' is the most romantically-stilted
  word in the dictionary. It suggests a high-stepping horse, and a passionate
  woman, whose name begins with 'Z,' in a wasp-waisted habit, with a tall silk
  hat)...There's a definitely interesting man, who might be a writer. I must
  get him to talk to me."</p>

  <p>The girl, whose name was Jennifer Burns, stopped writing and smiled, while
  Charlie wondered the cause of her amusement. The other young man watched her
  pencil with a certain interest, but Charlie could not remove his eyes from
  her. While he was too diffident to inquire her views about the window, lest
  he should be snubbed, his brain was a riot of romantic possibilities.</p>

  <p>He was certain that he and the girl would not be strangers when the
  terminus was reached. This journey was a prelude to future meetings in
  London, in a permanent atmosphere of central-heating and artificial
  light.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he did not know that he, alone among the passengers, had been
  overlooked by Jennifer. She merely glanced at his mouth, and decided that it
  was too small and curly. She preferred a face with chin&mdash;plenty of chin,
  like the other young man.</p>

  <p>Engrossed with her own affairs, she opened her handbag and began to sort
  its contents with as much composure as though she were alone in the carriage.
  When she read letters, she showed their addresses with no thought of the
  prying eyes of strangers.</p>

  <p>Presently she drew out her cigarette-case, but although Charlie hastened
  to produce a match, the other young man was quicker on the draw with a
  lighter. The smile with which she thanked them both set Charlie's brain on
  fire, for its frank friendship implied equality.</p>

  <p>This seemed a miracle to him, because it was evident that she was a
  superlative specimen of "Nice Girl" and, therefore, a member of a tribe which
  cut him on principle. This knowledge revived his inferiority complex, as he
  contrasted her fine build with Vera's meagre figure.</p>

  <p>He resolved that this was the kind of woman whom he adored. As he sat and
  watched her, unable to make any advance because of the other passengers, he
  cursed the speed of the train. Determined to meet her in London, he washed
  out the Brixton address and resolved to stay at a certain West-Central hotel,
  where his family always lodged whenever they went up to London.</p>

  <p>The light was fading when an official stopped at the door of the
  compartment to inform them that tea was being served in the restaurant-car.
  People were already beginning to dribble past their windows. As the ladies in
  the carriage seemed preparing to join the procession, Charlie hurried on
  ahead, pushing past people in the crowded corridor, in his eagerness to be
  first.</p>

  <p>He intended to reserve a seat at his table and offer it to Jennifer. But
  although he turned away several indignant applicants, his lady did not
  appear. The two other woman-passengers were served with tea before he
  realised that she had remained behind.</p>

  <p>Waving aside the waiter, he rushed again along the swaying corridors. When
  he reached his compartment, the other young man and Jennifer were chatting
  like old friends. They did not stop talking when he entered, but he felt so
  sure they must resent his return that he was compelled to apologise.</p>

  <p>"Too much of a dog-fight for me down there," he said humbly to Jennifer.
  "But if <i>you</i>'d like some tea, I'll bring you some in here."</p>

  <p>She smiled as she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Sporting of you, but I never have tea at this time. I'm from the north,
  and I'm used to high-tea. I suppose I'll have to give it up when I'm settled
  in London."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to London, too?" asked Charlie eagerly. "So am I."</p>

  <p>"Isn't this the London express?" asked the young man with the chin.</p>

  <p>The check reminded Charlie of the need for caution, as though he could
  actually hear Vera's ironic voice, "That's right, sweetheart, tell them all
  about it. Be sure you don't forget to mention our funny little game with the
  insurance."</p>

  <p>Driven to silence, he listened enviously to the conversation.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't help noticing the name of the literary agent on one of your
  envelopes," remarked the young man. "He's my agent, too."</p>

  <p>"Oh, are you a writer?" asked Jennifer eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Perhaps you know my name?"</p>

  <p>He mentioned a pen-name, which made the girl grow quite excited.</p>

  <p>"But, <i>of course</i>, I know you. I've read most of your books. I love
  them. Do tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charlie was left definitely out in the cold as they talked exclusively of
  literary interests. The train had nearly reached the outskirts of London
  before the girl gave another personal detail.</p>

  <p>"I write, too," she confessed, "but I'm not published&mdash;yet. I began
  my literary career, at the age of nine, with a poem for a children's
  competition."</p>

  <p>Charlie took his chance to enter the limelight.</p>

  <p>"I used to go in for competitions, too. I was quite a don at them. Won no
  end of prizes. It was quite a regular source of income."</p>

  <p>"Horrible little miser." The girl laughed. "But weren't they fun? I felt
  as thrilled as an explorer when I dug up a buried town."</p>

  <p>"I liked cross-words best," declared Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Cross-words?" echoed the young man with the chin. "I bet you never won a
  prize for cross-words."</p>

  <p>There was something about his sceptical grin which made Charlie realise
  that he was regarded as a liar. Because he was telling the truth, he
  naturally wanted to prove his words.</p>

  <p>"If you want chapter and verse," he said distantly, "I can give you the
  name of the paper. It was <i>Snowflakes</i>."</p>

  <p>The young man said nothing, but he continued to smile as he exchanged a
  glance with Jennifer, who also appeared amused. Feeling both suspicious and
  furious, Charlie muttered something about luggage, and lurched out into the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>When he had gone, the young man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"A natural liar," he observed. "<i>Snowflakes</i> is quite a recent
  publication. From the looks of him, he must have been twenty, when it first
  came out."</p>

  <p>"But perhaps he went in for their competitions, all the same," suggested
  Jennifer. "A little thing like an age-limit should not stop an enterprising
  young man."</p>

  <p>While they talked, Charlie was thinking of his recent snub. Suddenly his
  ears began to burn, as he wondered when cross-words first became popular.
  Although he could not remember the year, he was sure they were not a feature
  of his childhood. He and the girl had entered the Past through different
  doors.</p>

  <p>He had contrived to give himself away. He could hear Vera's voice as
  clearly as though she were beside him. "Beat it directly the train stops.
  Don't see them again. Give the poor girl a chance to forget you, Don Juan."
  But while he knew that retreat was the wise course, there was something about
  this girl that had got into his blood.</p>

  <p>She was a "nice girl," yet she had not treated him as a pariah. In a way,
  she represented the ideal, which he had missed through the murk of his
  clotted mind. But although she called up the purest emotion he had ever
  experienced, he re-acted to it in characteristic manner.</p>

  <p>He became instantly disloyal to Vera in thought. If, by some miracle, he
  could have run away with the girl and the insurance money, he would have
  deserted his wife without a twinge of remorse.</p>

  <p>Provided, of course, that he had not to be cruel to her.</p>

  <p>He bit his lips as the train steamed slowly past the backs of tenements,
  and thicker into the forest of chimneys. At last, unable to bear the thought
  of final rupture, he dashed back to the compartment, just as they reached the
  terminus.</p>

  <p>The girl was saying "Good-bye" to the young man with the chin.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if we shall knock up against each other again," she said
  frankly. "It would be fun. Look out for my name on the book-stalls, one day.
  'Jennifer Burns.' I'm staying at the Minerva Club, just at first."</p>

  <p>The young man responded with his card. The train had stopped and porters
  were entering the corridor. The girl surrendered her suitcase, and then
  looked back to smile vaguely to Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," she said.</p>

  <p>Unconscious of hideous destiny, she mentioned no future meeting. But as
  her blue eyes crinkled up, Charlie lost his head completely.</p>

  <p>"P-perhaps we shall see each other again," he said eagerly. "I haven't a
  card, but my name is 'Charlie Baxter.'"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-16"
     id="ch-16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE PHOTOGRAPH</h2>

  <p class="first">AS the words broke impulsively from Charlie's lips, a look
  of horror flitted across his face. Leaping down on the platform, he pushed
  his way through the crowd, until he reached the station yard. Here he jumped
  into the first taxi and shouted the name of his hotel to the driver.</p>

  <p>As they drove away, he was not only furious with himself for his slip, but
  aghast at the prospect ahead. It seemed to him that the imposture was going
  to prove too heavy a strain. He had to balance on quicksands, and one false
  step might plunge him into ruin. He could never relax or be natural until
  Chester Beaverbrook had got completely on top.</p>

  <p>Soon, however, he grew reassured by the jam of traffic and the thronged
  pavements. Amid these millions of people he must be surely safe.</p>

  <p>"I shall never see her again," he told himself.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, she had already forgotten his name. A new life was
  calling to her, and the railway carriage was a closed chapter. The passengers
  had all separated and gone their different ways.</p>

  <p>The meagre country-spinster was being welcomed by her four large children.
  The powdered town lady was in another train, and on her way back to her post
  as housekeeper to a country parson. The poor soul was looking forward to her
  return, for she had a form of skin trouble which made her sensitive of
  exposing her face to strangers. The young man with the chin was absorbed by
  his new heroine, and had no intention of ringing up the Minerva Club.</p>

  <p>Of the whole batch, the only one who was fated to become known to the
  man-in-the-street was Charlie Baxter.</p>

  <p>When he reached the hotel he attracted no more notice than at York. This
  time he signed his name&mdash;"Chester Beaverbrook"&mdash;in the register,
  with complete assurance. Instead of being awed by the grandeur of his
  surroundings, he had reverted to his Riviera phase and inclined to be
  critical.</p>

  <p>He was annoyed not to find a copy of the <i>Starminster Herald</i> on sale
  at the book-stall in the foyer, and had to place an order for it. His taste
  of posthumous fame was still delayed, but he comforted himself with the
  reminder that they were still talking about him. At the next meeting of the
  Golf Committee, a vote of condolence would be passed to his widow, and more
  nice things would be said about him.</p>

  <p>He could not possibly know that the disappearance of Miss Belson had wiped
  his funeral off the local map.</p>

  <p>When the body fell out of the wardrobe, Vera lost no time in wondering how
  it had got there originally. She flew down the stairs, but stopped on the way
  to fill all her kettles and put them to boil on the gas-stove. Then she
  rushed out to Sir Horace's impatient chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"I've just found Miss Belson," she said. "I want you to come inside and
  ring up Lady Fry and the doctor."</p>

  <p>"Is she dead?" asked the man.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so, but don't tell them that. Just tell them to come at
  once."</p>

  <p>Although Vera was convinced that life was extinct in the woman, she
  persisted with her hopeless and tiring task of trying to revive her. To her
  mind, it was on a par with blowing on cold ashes with a bellows. She dared
  not waste time to apply any tests. When the doctor arrived, Miss Belson's
  body lay on the floor, covered with blankets and surrounded with hot-water
  bottles. The room reeked of ammonia, while Vera, her hair falling across her
  flushed face in damp cowlicks, was rubbing the cold hands.</p>

  <p>To her surprise he announced a flicker of animation, and then kept her
  relentlessly on the run, finding fresh remedies. By the time Lady Fry,
  supported by the faithful Coles, had staggered over the threshold, Miss
  Belson was on the point of responding to an injection of adrenaline.</p>

  <p>Her eyelids fluttered and she stared up at them with clouded eyes.</p>

  <p>"Charlie&mdash;Baxter," she gasped.</p>

  <p>Exhausted by the effort, she collapsed immediately, so Vera was kept busy
  again. When Miss Belson was revived, she went down to the kitchen, to re-fill
  her bottles. As she slowly poured the boiling water into the funnel, she had
  leisure to think, for the first time.</p>

  <p>Her mind was a spin of anxious questions. How had Miss Belson got inside
  the cottage? What had she seen? Or&mdash;whom? Did any one lock her in the
  press?</p>

  <p>A horrible suspicion surged over her that Charlie was the origin of the
  mystery. Miss Belson was sleeping now, but when she awoke she would have a
  story to tell. Vera shivered at the thought. She revived Miss Belson because
  she could not have done otherwise, yet she had warmed a corpse which would
  reveal the secret of the grave.</p>

  <p>When she slowly walked upstairs, she had the figure of a child, but the
  small lined face of a woman of fifty.</p>

  <p>Lady Fry greeted her with emotion.</p>

  <p>"I can never thank you&mdash;or repay you. The doctor says that if you
  hadn't fanned her spark of life, he couldn't have saved her."</p>

  <p>"Any one would have done the same," said Vera dully. "But why was she in
  my house?"</p>

  <p>Lady Fry looked confused as she exchanged glances with Coles.</p>

  <p>"I've no idea," she said.</p>

  <p>The doctor pricked up his ears, feeling that the time had come to satisfy
  his own curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Was your sister in good health when she left home?" he asked
  tactfully.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Lady Fry, realising that he was trying to help her out of an
  awkward situation. "She had a heavy cold. But you know what she is over
  illness. Stubborn as a mule."</p>

  <p>"I know. Any temperature?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure she had. She was so flushed."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have no idea why she came here, instead of to the
  Library?"</p>

  <p>"No, unless she was light-headed."</p>

  <p>"Was she especially friendly with Mr. Baxter?"</p>

  <p>The last question was not put into actual words, but was answered in the
  negative by Lady Fry, who was now red as a beet.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she received an inspiration.</p>

  <p>"I know," she cried. "It's just come back to me. I told my sister that I
  wished I had a photograph of your dear husband, because I can never remember
  faces. In her fuddled&mdash;<i>muddled</i>&mdash;condition, she must have
  called on you to ask you for one."</p>

  <p>"Photograph?" echoed Vera. "I haven't one."</p>

  <p>"No? But I saw a delightful snap of him, stuck in the rim of your bedroom
  mirror, when you gave your bridge tea."</p>

  <p>"That was the Major's brother who's in the navy," explained Vera.</p>

  <p>"Really? I suppose my sister and I were misled by the beard. We didn't
  examine it closely...But since we are on the subject, Mrs. Baxter, may I beg
  one of your dear husband's photographs?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, but I haven't one of him."</p>

  <p>"Oh? I have so many of my dear husband to console me. Haven't you some old
  one that could be copied?"</p>

  <p>"No. There's the door-bell. It must be the ambulance. I'll run down and
  see."</p>

  <p>Vera was grateful when she was able to drive away from the cottage. The
  chauffeur had explained the reason of her delay to his employers, over the
  telephone, so she was greeted with sympathy by Sir Horace and Lady
  Wright.</p>

  <p>"Such a terrible shock, on top of everything else," said Lady Wright.</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Vera. "If you don't mind, I feel too all-in for a swim."</p>

  <p>But although she ached from her exertions, she could not sleep. She asked
  herself if she was ever going to know any peace of mind again. After all the
  tension of the last days, she had earned a respite from worry.</p>

  <p>But, apparently, a dummy would not die decently. She had given it
  Christian burial, with expense and ceremony, only for it to pop up again, its
  grinning raspberry-pink face challenging her to keep it underground.</p>

  <p>When Miss Belson became conscious, she would tell her story. What would it
  be? The only clue she had was those two horribly suggestive
  words&mdash;"Charlie Baxter."</p>

  <p>Unlike Vera, Miss Belson slept the clock round and did not wake up until
  past noon, when she looked around her bedroom and then burst into tears.</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank God," she said.</p>

  <p>When she had recovered her composure, she began to question her sister
  about the details of her rescue. But Lady Fry was evasive and obviously ill
  at ease.</p>

  <p>"So awkward," she faltered. "Every one wants to know <i>why</i> you went
  there. And I'm at a loss what to say...You know some people have loathe-some
  medical minds. They hint at&mdash;at repressions, and&mdash;and all that. As
  if you were not the very last person in the world to have a secret passion
  for a married man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off as Miss Belson found unexpected strength to spring up in
  bed. Her cheeks burned and her mild eyes were now fierce with pride. She felt
  as though her spiritual privacy were being flayed by the hint of scandal in
  connection with herself.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she said in a trembling voice, "I haven't got to justify my
  character to <i>you.</i> But you'd better know exactly what happened."</p>

  <p>She began to speak in disjointed phrases, and whenever she paused, her
  sister seemed to know by instinct what she intended to say, and supplied the
  missing words. But her story came to an end with the slam of the wardrobe
  door.</p>

  <p>"I want to forget the rest," she said. "Never ask me about it, or mention
  it again."</p>

  <p>The official tale was told to the doctor when he paid his visit, and he
  put it into local circulation. Accompanied by Mr. Acorn, the insurance agent,
  he called upon Vera in the afternoon. She was having tea with Sir Horace and
  Lady Wright in the orangery. Her face seemed to shrink as she noticed the
  ominous combination, and when he addressed her directly, she looked up
  defensively, like some small cornered rodent, ready to snap.</p>

  <p>"I've just come from Lady Fry's," he said. "Miss Belson remembers
  everything."</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Vera breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Well," repeated the doctor, "I suspect she had a mild attack of flu.
  Unfortunately, she is indifferent to health. She confesses to feeling
  somewhat lightheaded. Instead of going to bed and sending for me, she went
  out to execute a commission for her sister. Directly she was outside the
  house she knew she had to get <i>something</i> for Lady Fry, but she forgot
  the library book and could only remember the photograph of your husband. You
  remember about the photograph, don't you, Mrs. Baxter?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Vera in a choked voice, as she wished she could shake the
  story out of the doctor and so end her suspense.</p>

  <p>"When she reached Jasmine Cottage," he went on, "she noticed that the
  front door was ajar, so she went inside, to see if any unauthorised person
  was there. She had hardly taken a step, when a man rushed at her in the
  darkness. She was so terrified that she can only remember running upstairs,
  but she heard him coming after her. She believes there was a bit of a
  struggle, but she does not know whether she hid in the wardrobe, or if she
  was pushed inside."</p>

  <p>A band around Vera's temples seemed to snap, as she listened with
  overwhelming relief to the story, although she rejected it as lies. But her
  nerves were still shaken and she jumped violently when Acorn spoke to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Did you notice if anything had been disturbed inside the cottage, Mrs.
  Baxter?"</p>

  <p>"No. I didn't look."</p>

  <p>"Then, would you mind checking up with your inventory? I am sorry to
  trouble you, but the Major is insured with us, and if it is a case of
  housebreaking I must know what is missing."</p>

  <p>Vera promised to lose no time over the job, and Acorn rose to go.</p>

  <p>"I expect some one heard the place was empty," he said, "and slipped
  inside through a window. He was probably more scared than Miss Belson."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Sir Horace chose that moment to make a request.</p>

  <p>"Talking of photographs," he said gallantly, "we shall want one of you,
  Mrs. Baxter, to cheer us when you've deserted us."</p>

  <p>"But I haven't one," declared Vera, who was too addle-headed to think two
  jumps ahead. "I always make an appalling photograph."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish," said Sir Horace. "I'll take a snap of you, now."</p>

  <p>"No, <i>please.</i> I shall run away. I feel so self-conscious, with these
  awful poached-egg eyes. I couldn't sleep&mdash;after yesterday."</p>

  <p>Lady Wright made faces at her husband to remind him of Vera's recent
  widowhood. He gave in reluctantly, only to suggest a compromise.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you all here in a group. You can't object to <i>that</i>, Mrs.
  Baxter."</p>

  <p>"Of course not."</p>

  <p>Vera fell in with Sir Horace's fussy arrangements, as he posed his guests.
  A footman fetched his camera, and he got into position.</p>

  <p>"All keep perfectly still when I call 'now'," he instructed them.
  "'<i>Now</i>'...There you are. I've got a winner."</p>

  <p>Acorn, however, had his doubts. He had turned his profile to the camera,
  so was able to notice that Vera had moved her head slightly at the critical
  moment.</p>

  <p>As he walked back to his office, he told himself that the lady merely
  suffered from nerves. Yet, that evening, he could not resist looking at his
  collection of snaps, to find some souvenir of Charlie Baxter and his
  wife.</p>

  <p>He drew a blank. Somehow, they had always contrived to be left out of
  groups at Golf Meetings. They had either an Oriental superstition about being
  photographed, or else they were anxious to leave no record of their personal
  appearance behind them.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he remembered standing beside Charlie Baxter when they posed for
  a group, on the occasion of a tennis tournament. At last he had run him to
  earth. With growing excitement, he hunted through his albums, to find his
  quarry right at the bottom of the pile.</p>

  <p>As he examined it he gave a low whistle. It might be merely a strange
  coincidence, but&mdash;like his wife&mdash;Charlie Baxter had slightly turned
  his head, so that his features were blurred.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-17"
     id="ch-17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE LOCAL PAPER</h2>

  <p class="first">THE embargo on photographs was a precaution which Charlie
  Baxter resented bitterly when he obtained his belated copy of the
  <i>Starminster Herald.</i> He silently cursed its author&mdash;Puggie
  Williams&mdash;as he read and re-read the account of his funeral. It only
  needed a large portrait of himself in the middle of the page.</p>

  <p>His sentimental brown eyes filled with tears in his appreciation of
  Browning's verses. He felt that the poet had really got his measure. He was
  always thinking of kind actions and meaning to do noble deeds&mdash;unaware
  that all these still-born impulses had been accumulating, like compound
  interest, to build him up to the man he actually was.</p>

  <p>The drawback to complete enjoyment was the lack of any one to appreciate
  his funeral honours. He made an effort, when he passed the newspaper to a man
  with whom he chatted at the bar.</p>

  <p>"Just been reading the account of a friend's funeral," he said. "When I
  go, I'd like to think I was that kind of man."</p>

  <p>The stranger took the <i>Herald</i> out of politeness, started to skim the
  marked column, and then broke off with an inquiry.</p>

  <p>"What did you think of the fight?"</p>

  <p>After that Charlie consoled himself with the fact that there was no one in
  the hotel whom he wished to impress. The visitors seemed to be dull
  respectable provincials, although brighter patrons drifted in for the <i>Thé
  Dansant</i>.</p>

  <p>He rarely went out, but spent his time in the lounge, sunken deep in a big
  chair, while he smoked and watched the revolving-doors. After the discomfort
  of an icy attic, he revelled in warmth and ease, like a lizard basking in the
  sun.</p>

  <p>He did not even want to dance, although he watched the new steps closely.
  A pair of professional dancers employed by the management always drew his
  eyes. He especially admired the man. He had glossy black
  hair&mdash;artificially waved&mdash;olive skin, and very white teeth. He
  displayed these frequently in a flashing smile, while he danced with the
  slinky grace of a panther.</p>

  <p>One afternoon Charlie was watching him enviously during an exhibition
  tango, when a strapping young man from the country spoke to him.</p>

  <p>"Looks easy when that chap does it. He slips about as if he'd been
  filletted off the bone. But it's got me beat."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the tango's quite easy," Charlie assured him. He had mastered its
  movements and could perform them gracefully, in private, before his bedroom
  mirror. "The trouble is&mdash;you and I wouldn't look like him."</p>

  <p>"Who wants to look like a dam dago?" asked the young man indignantly.</p>

  <p>The answer was "Charlie Baxter." He told himself that all the women fell
  for the dancer, while no one took any notice of himself.</p>

  <p>While he consoled himself by reading the account of his funeral, he had an
  inspiration. Surely there must be a similar obituary notice in the <i>Humbley
  Advertiser</i>&mdash;the local paper of his home-town. Although his father
  was dead, the family was respected in the district.</p>

  <p>He ordered the paper immediately, and impatiently awaited its arrival,
  haunting the book-stall. When at last the clerk told him that he was
  expecting it that same afternoon, he took up his station in the lounge, so as
  to be on the spot.</p>

  <p>Presently, to his surprise and gratification, he noticed that a new
  arrival was looking fixedly in his direction. She was a pretty fair girl of
  about eighteen, with a round face and big violet-blue eyes. As she was
  smarter and more attractive than the average visitor, Charlie returned her
  stare.</p>

  <p>His interest seemed to abash her, for she hurriedly poured out another cup
  of tea to hide her confusion, and also to assure him of her impersonal
  attitude. Chilled in his turn, Charlie vaguely remembered that on her arrival
  she had been accompanied by a man. He decided, therefore, to wash her out as
  a possible affair.</p>

  <p>Looking up, he saw that the clerk at the book-stall was holding up a
  newspaper. Instantly the blue-eyed flapper was forgotten, as he hurried over
  to get his precious <i>Humbley Advertiser.</i> He turned over the pages
  feverishly, but could discover no reference to himself. In disgust, he looked
  at the column of local Births, Deaths and Marriages, and found himself duly
  documented in two bald lines.</p>

  <p>He was biting his lips when he heard a girl's voice.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, but&mdash;haven't we met before?"</p>

  <p>The blue-eyed flapper had plucked up her courage to make the conventional
  opening gambit.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he agreed, springing up and pulling another chair
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Then you do remember me?" she asked, as she sat down beside him.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Coo, that's a relief. I recognised you at once; at least, I
  <i>thought</i> I did, but I couldn't be sure I wasn't staring at a strange
  man. But when I saw you reading our wretched rag, I knew you must be Charlie
  Baxter."</p>

  <p>At the words, Charlie felt as though he had been knocked out in the ring.
  Suddenly he remembered that this hotel was patronised, not only by his
  family, but by other Humbley folk, on the strength of mouth-to-mouth
  advertisement. It was madness to come here, and virtual suicide to buy a copy
  of the betraying <i>Advertiser.</i></p>

  <p>As he was being counted out, he heard Vera's ironic comment.</p>

  <p><i>"Stick to it, sweetheart. You're getting quite good at telling the
  tale."</i></p>

  <p>Too late, he made a stupid effort to conceal his identity.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, but you've made a mistake. My name is Chester Beaverbrook.
  When I said I remembered you, I hoped you were&mdash;were&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Trying to get off?" finished the girl pertly. "But you can't pull the
  wool over my eyes. You <i>are</i> Charlie Baxter. You went to live in
  Starminster, afterwards." She swooped down on his other newspaper. "And
  here's the <i>Starminster Herald.</i> That proves it."</p>

  <p>As she gloated over her triumph, her insolent blue eyes half-closed,
  Charlie felt a curious heat rising to his head, as though his brain was
  boiling. For a second, he wanted to grip her round white throat.</p>

  <p>Savagery was so foreign to his nature that he vaguely recognised the fact
  that fear, not brutality, was the cause of his impulse, which left him as
  swiftly as it came.</p>

  <p>"I knew you at once," went on the girl. "I used to have a crush on you
  when I was a kid. I was only twelve when you left the town, but I carried on
  like a widow. Didn't you marry a Vanity girl? Is she with you?"</p>

  <p>"No," murmured Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Aha, <i>that's</i> why you aren't Charlie Baxter. But I understand. I
  won't split. I first began to like you, because my sisters said you were fast
  and went about with common girls."</p>

  <p>Her words gave Charlie the clue that she belonged to a "nice" family.</p>

  <p>"You've grown up since then," he remarked. "I'm terribly sorry, but, just
  for the moment, I can't place you."</p>

  <p>"Peggy Hepburn."</p>

  <p>He remembered the family&mdash;rich, refined, and prominent conservatives.
  There was a flock of insipid girls and a pallid mother, who had found them
  under a gooseberry-bush, according to her book of words. As none of them was
  married, they were not in a position to challenge her statement with the
  proper authority.</p>

  <p>"You're not like your sisters," said Charlie, looking at Peggy's confident
  face. He noticed that, although her natural colouring was beautiful, she had
  pencilled her brows and rouged her lips.</p>

  <p>"Thank the pigs. They're old maids. But I always used to meet boys on the
  sly. Any kind did for me. When they found out about me and the milk-boy, they
  sent me to a convent in France. Convents are lousy. You learn to make lace
  and wear a chemise in the bath."</p>

  <p>Charlie now understood why she was ignorant of his official death.</p>

  <p>"Are you going home for good?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Supposed to&mdash;but shall I tell you a secret?"</p>

  <p>He felt a gush of sudden hope.</p>

  <p>"I'd be honoured by your confidence," he assured her in his best
  Starminster manner. "Will you have a cocktail?"</p>

  <p>"Love it."</p>

  <p>He could tell from her excitement that the drink was a novelty.</p>

  <p>"Isn't all this fun?" she cried, as she fished for the cherry. "What would
  they say in Humbley if they could see us now?"</p>

  <p>"They'd say I was corrupting a baby."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not." She lowered her voice. "I'm going to be married."</p>

  <p>"Congratulations. Is he a Humbley man?"</p>

  <p>"Help. He's no one from that hole. He's some one I knocked against in
  Paris when I went in for my music exam. We went on meeting on the d.q.t. In
  fact, it was a romance. He's adorable&mdash;sophisticated and rich."</p>

  <p>"Splendid. I suppose you are taking him home with you on approval?"</p>

  <p>Peggy laughed&mdash;and the cocktail laughed too.</p>

  <p>"I <i>don't</i> think. They'd say I was too young. I had to cross, because
  a bally nun took us as far as Victoria Station. But I'm not going home. We're
  leaving again for Paris. We'll get married there, and then we're going on to
  Rio."</p>

  <p>It sounded a fishy programme to Charlie, who listened with close
  attention. In one way it was a lucky break, because it gave him a respite.
  But the facts remained that she would mention him in her letters to her
  family or friends, and that she would return home on a visit.</p>

  <p>As he looked at her slack red lips and shallow eyes, he knew that she
  could not be entrusted with a secret. Peggy Hepburn knew that Charlie Baxter
  was alive; and what Peggy Hepburn knew to-day, Humbley knew to-morrow. Of
  course, Humbley would be asked not to pass on the news, because Charlie
  Baxter had swindled an insurance company, so it was in confidence.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Charlie broke out in a sweat. The heat of the lounge grew
  unbearable as he thought of prison&mdash;no longer a vague threat, but a
  certain destination. It was a touch of added irony that the impulse which
  made him order the <i>Humbley Advertiser</i>, in order to see his name in
  print, insured him future press publicity.</p>

  <p>In that moment he hated Vera because she was always right. All she wanted
  was his chequebook. If he had behaved as a cad towards her&mdash;like Puggie
  Williams whom she really appreciated&mdash;he would be free to marry a nice
  girl, like the girl in the train.</p>

  <p>He started as Peggy clutched his arm.</p>

  <p>"There he is," she cried. "<i>That</i>'s my husband. Over there, talking
  to the boy at the bureau."</p>

  <p>As Charlie followed the direction of her pointing finger, a change came
  over his face.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-18"
     id="ch-18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; SALVAGE OPERATIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">ONE glance was sufficient to tell Charlie that the man was
  of marked carrion type. Only a child, or an idiot, could credit him with
  matrimonial intentions. Peggy was headed for the Port of the Forgotten.</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>," protested Charlie inwardly. "I must save her."</p>

  <p>Even as he made the resolution, he counted the cost. Her salvation was the
  price of his own damnation.</p>

  <p>There would be no stopping Peggy's loose lips, short of tying a knot in
  her tongue-strings. Directly the story spread through Humbley, that Charlie
  had been seen in London, his eldest sister would rush over to Starminster to
  demand an explanation of the mystery.</p>

  <p>He knew Emily's character only too well. Although she had left the cottage
  in a rage, when it was too late she would resent the fact that she had not
  looked on her dead brother's face. In the circumstances, Vera's reluctance to
  let her enter the supposititious death-chamber, was doubly suspicious.</p>

  <p>A hornet's nest would be stirred up, as rumours began to float about. It
  would be reported that Peggy Hepburn had spoke to Charlie Baxter, although
  the town had attended his funeral. People would speculate as to what his
  coffin had actually contained.</p>

  <p>Acorn would hold up payment of the insurance, pending inquiries. When no
  satisfactory explanation was forthcoming, his next step would be an
  application for an order of exhumation, if Peggy's statement could not be
  shaken. That would be the prelude to the end.</p>

  <p>Even if Charlie could hide from justice, without money they were lost.
  Vera could not join him, and he would be left to starve like a poisoned rat
  in a drain.</p>

  <p>"No," thought Charlie. "Far better come out into the open like a man."</p>

  <p>He could not help feeling that he was, in addition, a very gallant
  gentleman, going to his doom. But the girl was so trusting&mdash;so young;
  there were infantile gaps between her teeth, and her hands were still
  dimpled. Besides, he had vowed that he would always champion women.</p>

  <p>As he pushed back his hair distractedly, in an effort to think clearly,
  Peggy impudently prodded his forehead.</p>

  <p>"I've always wanted to do that," she said. "I used to look at that funny
  little scar when I was a kid in church. Your father made you come, sometimes,
  and you used to turn round and stare at the pretty girls."</p>

  <p>Charlie smiled vaguely, as he subconsciously noted the remark as another
  nail in his coffin. After this proof, there could be no question of mistaken
  identity.</p>

  <p>"Isn't your future husband going to dance with you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, we mustn't be seen together. Isn't it a thrill? I'm all steamed-up
  over it."</p>

  <p>"Um. When do you leave?"</p>

  <p>"Directly we've had dinner."</p>

  <p>She looked round, her eyes bright with excitement, and nudged Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Isn't the professional marvellous? I'd adore to dance with him."</p>

  <p>"That Dago?"</p>

  <p>"He isn't a Dago. That complexion comes out of a bottle. Lots of men do
  it. Besides, it's part of his professional stock-in-trade...Can <i>you</i>
  dance?"</p>

  <p>Charlie got up gallantly. He soon discovered that his form was far
  superior to his partner's, but she seemed unconscious of the fact as she
  continued to rave about the professional.</p>

  <p>"Let's follow him round and barge into him," she urged.</p>

  <p>Charlie began to find her cheap.</p>

  <p>"Youth does not imply innocence," he thought. "Yet I've got to sacrifice
  Vera&mdash;who's a <i>good</i> woman&mdash;for this chit. I wonder where my
  duty really lies."</p>

  <p>The cold douche of common sense seemed to bring the difficulties to the
  surface, as a shower draws up worms. He realised that he had a problem to
  tackle which called for the utmost diplomacy. The result of one false step
  might be catastrophic.</p>

  <p>Since Browning had given him proof of understanding his intricate moods,
  he had bought a copy of his collected poems. He did so chiefly to find out
  what was omitted from the quotation in the <i>Starminster Herald.</i>
  Afterwards, attracted by such promising titles as "A Light Woman," he dipped
  into the volume, and learned that Browning&mdash;the greatest authority on
  character&mdash;said it was a dangerous thing to play with souls.</p>

  <p>Charlie took his hint, as he slithered about, with Peggy's arms hooked
  tightly round his neck. He told himself that the carrion-crow might really
  include marriage in his schedule. His appearance could libel him. If he
  blundered into their lives, he might wreck Peggy's chance of a congenial
  husband.</p>

  <p>In any case, he could not appeal to the police, or the hotel management,
  without authority or definite proof of abduction. The only thing he could do
  was to telephone to the girl's parents, and leave the father, who was
  presumably a business man, to deal with the situation.</p>

  <p>The chief complication was the problem of who would pay for the
  trunk-call. It would be put down on his bill, naturally. But, at this crisis,
  every shilling he could save would mean additional safety for Vera.</p>

  <p>Again he shook his head. It was useless to telephone, because the birds
  would be flown before Mr. Hepburn could reach the hotel.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Charlie knew that there was but one thing to be done. He must
  appeal to the better nature of the girl.</p>

  <p>"Who's doped you?" she asked, playing into his hands.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking of you," he told her. "Let's sit down in a quiet
  corner."</p>

  <p>He steered her to a seat, and then cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to talk to you like a big brother, Peggy," he said. "That man
  of yours isn't 'jannock'."</p>

  <p>She fired up at the North Country word.</p>

  <p>"I hate 'jannock' men. It means clumping boots and three helpings of
  underdone meat. My Tony is distinguished and a man of the world."</p>

  <p>"But he won't marry you."</p>

  <p>"What's the odds? No modern people get married, nowadays. Besides, he
  <i>will.</i> He has a title and large estates, so he wants an heir."</p>

  <p>"No, Peggy, you're fooling yourself. But if I can stop you from ruining
  yourself&mdash;body and soul&mdash;I will. Haven't you ever read the facts
  about the White Slave Traffic?"</p>

  <p>She stared at him with blue saucer-eyes which had grown slightly
  scared.</p>

  <p>"What do you think you can do?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I can&mdash;and will&mdash;take you home, to-night. I shan't draw an easy
  breath until I hand you over to your father, personally."</p>

  <p>She breathed hard but said nothing, so he pressed home his argument.</p>

  <p>"<i>Think</i>, Peggy." His voice was softly persuasive. "You stand to lose
  everything. Husband, children, home. I may be a rotter who's missed
  everything, but my sisters are married, and I know what domestic happiness
  really can be. Long peaceful evenings by the fireside, reading, or
  listening-in, instead of cocktails and night clubs."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you forgotten darning the socks while hubby reads aloud?" she
  asked derisively. "You're not making it sound attractive."</p>

  <p>"No, Peggy, it's not a joke. You're only a child that doesn't know what
  she wants. But, deep down, every woman wants the same thing."</p>

  <p>Peggy shuddered slightly and then spoke with shrill defiance.</p>

  <p>"I know exactly what you're going to do. You're going to tell the manager
  I'm a minor and have me held here till Dad comes."</p>

  <p>"No, I wouldn't do such a rotten treacherous thing. I trust you to do the
  right thing. You must admit I've been open with you. I haven't stabbed you in
  the back."</p>

  <p>Her saucer-eyes shrank to slits as she nodded.</p>

  <p>"You win," she said submissively. "What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>As he realised his triumph, his upper-lip broke out into a sweat.</p>

  <p>"I'm going upstairs now to pack," he told her. "I'll meet you here in half
  an hour exactly. Then we'll catch the first train back to Humbley."</p>

  <p>"All right, Captain."</p>

  <p>He patted her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Good girl. You'll never regret it. Think what a thrill it will be to see
  your own town again. Think of your home, your father and mother, all your
  sisters. Your friends. Your old schoolfellows. <i>Think</i>."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a puzzled stare and then began to smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what a fool. You're kidding me, aren't you. You've just been
  stringing me along?"</p>

  <p>He would not reply to the impertinence.</p>

  <p>"In half an hour," he repeated as he walked towards the lift.</p>

  <p>When he reached his room, he threw a few articles into a bag, and then
  paced the floor in an agitated manner, smoking cigarettes and talking to
  Vera. He felt horribly disloyal to her. She was his wife and the best woman
  in the world; yet he was letting her down for the sake of a baggage who would
  break out with the next milk-boy.</p>

  <p>At the end of half an hour, he came down to the lounge and looked around
  him with anxious eyes. But Peggy was not there. He waited for twenty minutes
  and then interviewed the clerk at the bureau. It took a little time to
  identify Peggy from Charlie's description, but, presently, the young man
  remembered her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, these people only came for dinner. They left their luggage in the
  cloakroom. But they changed their minds about eating here. They checked out
  about nearly an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. It doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>Charlie turned away to hide the tears which welled up in his eyes as he
  thought of poor Peggy's fate.</p>

  <p>He comforted himself with the reminder that he could have done no more.
  Indeed, in view of his failure it was providential that he had forgotten to
  give notice of his own departure. It would be annoying to find his room,
  which was a quiet one, already allotted to another guest.</p>

  <p>But he had forgotten something else until he got into bed late that night.
  Then he hit his forehead angrily.</p>

  <p>"Chump. I ought to have rung up her father immediately so he could have
  wired to have all the ports watched...But it's too late now. I did my
  best."</p>

  <p>He felt that the stars had been fighting for Vera as a hint to her deluded
  husband. Henceforth he must consider her safety before that of a strange
  woman. Having made the resolution, he slept like a child.</p>

  <p>Sustained by the knowledge of his own intended sacrifice,
  which&mdash;according to Browning, counted as performance&mdash;Charlie was
  able to listen to an S.O.S. from the B.B.C. the following night without a
  twinge of conscience.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Missing since the 25th inst., Peggy Elizabeth Hepburn, aged
  seventeen-and-a-half, slight build, round face, very fair curly hair, blue
  eyes, five feet five inches, may speak with a slight French accent, dressed
  in a dark-red dress, with coat to match, grey fox-fur collar, grey
  hat..."</p><br>

  <p>Charlie leaned forward to offer a match to a girl smoker so lost the rest
  of the description. But he was in time to hear the ominous concluding
  statement.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Was last seen at Victoria Station, about noon and it is
  feared some harm may have befallen her."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-19"
     id="ch-19"></a>XIX. &mdash; A SUSPICIOUS CASE</h2>

  <p class="first">CHARLES forgot Peggy within twenty-four hours. He assured
  himself that the S.O.S. was no definite proof of disaster. For all he knew to
  the contrary, she might be married to Mr. Vulture&mdash;although it was
  significant that he ceased to worry about future exposure. In any case, he
  had done his utmost to help her, so he dislodged her from his mind, to make
  room for the girl in the train.</p>

  <p>After hours spent in the lounge, watching while others made sentimental
  history he wanted his own love-interest. Every woman who flirted, danced, or
  drank, was compared unfavourably with Jennifer. In his eyes, she was one of
  those rare persons who were kind without being dowdy, and smart, without
  being smutty.</p>

  <p>The urge to see her again presently drove him out into those streets
  raying from Piccadilly Circus, in the hope of a chance meeting. He dared not
  seek her in restaurants and theatres because of his urgent need to conserve
  money. But, although he was proud of his self-control, he had to come to
  grips with his financial position.</p>

  <p>He had paid two weekly bills at the hotel, so could estimate the cost of a
  third, at the end of which he would have about twenty pounds left. That sum
  might keep him for two months at the cheap Acre Lane boarding-house, if he
  exercised stringent economy. Yet Vera had mentioned a possible delay of three
  months&mdash;in which case he would be short of board and lodging.</p>

  <p>He dreaded the mere idea of exchanging his present luxurious surroundings
  for Brixton. There was a dreary stretch of exile ahead until Vera came up to
  London. Suddenly he realised that he was now desperately anxious to see her
  again. She was his wife, and the best woman in the world.</p>

  <p>While he was repenting his former disloyalty, Vera did not reciprocate his
  devotion. She, too, on her return to Jasmine Cottage, had to face the
  financial problem, which was his gift to her.</p>

  <p>Her first action had been to write to the Bank, to ascertain her balance.
  Although Charlie kept a tally on his counterfoils, she had a lurking hope
  that he might have overlooked a few pounds.</p>

  <p>The manager's reply staggered her utterly. He informed her that there was
  no balance, while he assured her that he could open a fresh credit during the
  remainder of her stay at Starminster, if she was thereby convenienced.</p>

  <p>She had only to give him the address of one of the banks which held her
  deposits, and he would arrange the necessary transfer.</p>

  <p>With the aid of a cigarette, Vera tried to find a way out of her
  difficulty. Her scrupulous honesty in the matter of debt was a contradiction
  in fact, considering that she was a party to fraud. But she had only
  consented to Puggie's plan under pressure, because she felt vaguely that so
  large a company was fair game. It was so impersonal that she realised her
  dishonesty no more than the average respectable third-class passenger who
  enters a first-class railway carriage&mdash;virtuously prepared to pay the
  excess, if surprised by a jumper, but hoping for the best.</p>

  <p>She resolved that no one should suffer through her present deficit; if she
  was forced to open credits, she would pay up every penny before she left the
  town. But she was obliged to have a certain amount of loose cash, while she
  was unused to borrowing or raising the wind.</p>

  <p>After her first rage had died down, she absolved Charlie from blame. After
  all he knew that she had twenty pounds of their reserve and he was ignorant
  of the fact that she had given it away.</p>

  <p>For a minute, she thought of appeal to Puggie. Then she tightened her lips
  and shook her head. She knew exactly how long a woman could spin out the
  amount, and how soon a man could romp through it. Besides, she had a soft
  spot in her heart for him, and the allusion to his dress-suit had made her
  suspicious. It might mean that he intended to eat humble pie, and creep down
  to some titled family which dressed for dinner as a matter of course; but it
  also suggested a waiter's job.</p>

  <p>"If he knows I'm broke, the mug will put some one on the spot, to raise
  the wind," she thought.</p>

  <p>At this point she considered the Insurance. She had already sent Acorn the
  necessary documents, with the assurance that she wanted to get away from
  Starminster as soon as possible; but she had avoided him lest he should
  mention business and be surprised that she had not put her affairs into the
  hands of her solicitor, following the precedent of every wealthy widow.</p>

  <p>She had a contempt for him, based on his quiet unassuming personality, so
  she was confident that she could bounce him into allowing her an advance of
  the Insurance. As she remembered Mrs. Acorn&mdash;a sweet-faced woman with
  the figure of a sack&mdash;she accepted a common fallacy that every homely
  man must be flattered by a pretty woman.</p>

  <p>She dressed with unusual care, although her outfit was limited to the
  black Persian cloth coat and Cossack cap; but she added tangerine rouge and a
  bunch of white violets, and then tripped forth to call on him at his
  office.</p>

  <p>When she fluttered through the door, he was stooping over his desk, so
  that she could see that his greying hair was growing thin on the top. Against
  his wife's orders, he was wearing a cherished old suit which he had contrived
  to get well sprinkled with ash, since he was an untidy smoker.</p>

  <p>As he blinked up at his radiant visitor through his spectacles, he looked
  such a dusty nonentity, that she felt she could twist him round her
  fingers.</p>

  <p>She opened fire by tender inquiries about Mrs. Acorn, and was rejoiced by
  a good report of her health.</p>

  <p>"And the&mdash;little one?" she went on, assuming that his marriage would
  be blessed with offspring, but unable to guess its sex.</p>

  <p>"The 'Big Three' are flourishing," was the reply. "All away, at a Public
  School. A family is a ruinous proposition, Mrs. Baxter."</p>

  <p>"But you are the rich people," she assured him. "<i>I</i> have
  nothing."</p>

  <p>The knowledge that she had laid her cards down upon the table&mdash;in
  that remark&mdash;appealed to her sardonic sense of humour. So she continued
  to prattle in much the same strain, while Mr. Acorn waited for her to come to
  the point.</p>

  <p>Presently, she touched on the subject of the Insurance.</p>

  <p>"I hope there will be no delay," she declared. "I was very happy
  here&mdash;but now I loathe the place. I can't get away soon enough."</p>

  <p>"I can understand your feeling," said Acorn quietly. "I had a great liking
  for your husband."</p>

  <p>"I know. He was in sympathy with you, too...When will I get the
  money?"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to give you a definite date at this stage. But you were
  so prompt in sending us the necessary documents that payment should not be
  unduly delayed."</p>

  <p>Vera drew a deep breath of relief.</p>

  <p>"Then they never make trouble?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Only in a suspicious case."</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>Acorn looked mildly surprised at the inquiry; but as he possessed the
  conceit of many quiet men, he concluded that the widow wanted an excuse to
  prolong the interview. Looking at her through his glasses, with intelligent
  brown eyes, he began to explain.</p>

  <p>"On insuring his life, a man contracts to pay an annual premium for a
  number of years. He must be either a fool, or a rogue, if he contracts to pay
  more than he can reasonably afford. For instance, the Claims Department might
  get a set of circumstances like this:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">(<i>a</i>) The man is a bird of passage.<br>
  (<i>b</i>) He dies young.<br>
  (<i>c</i>) He dies after paying only one or two premiums.<br>
  (<i>d</i>) He had a negligible income&mdash;say £250 per annum, yet he
  contracts to pay an annual premium of £100.</p><br>

  <p>Acorn paused, to let the explanation sink in, before he added, "In such a
  case I should certainly advise further investigation before payment."</p>

  <p>All Vera's confidence shrivelled away as she listened. After Acorn's
  explanation, she dared not rouse the least suspicion of her financial
  soundness. Until the Insurance was paid she must go on posing as a rich
  widow.</p>

  <p>A horseshoe of worry was graven deep between her eyes as she thought
  rapidly. The outlook was barren of possibility. There was no one to whom she
  could appeal for help, in confidence, and, in the circumstances, she dared
  not borrow. She could not even slip up to London, on the frail chance of
  getting temporary Stage work, without ready money.</p>

  <p>All that remained to her was seven shillings and ninepence in her bag.</p>

  <p>She put on a bold front as she rose to go.</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much," she said. "You've been most helpful."</p>

  <p>"If you are anxious to leave the town," advised Acorn, "I can get in touch
  with your solicitor and transact the business through him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you so much. I'll do that."</p>

  <p>"Will you give me his address?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. I'll send it. I always forget his number. Unless&mdash;No, I
  think I'd rather attend to it myself. It&mdash;it gives me something to
  do."</p>

  <p>"I understand. Good-morning."</p>

  <p>As he opened the door, the gleam in his eyes rather surprised her. It made
  her aware that the nonentity could cherish strong feelings, which included
  dislike of herself.</p>

  <p>She had gone half-way down the stairs when she paused at a sudden
  recollection of her exact position. It was impossible for her to carry on
  without cash, because she was confronted with a special complication.</p>

  <p>People like herself&mdash;who never owed money&mdash;were the first to be
  dunned when they wished to obtain goods on credit. The very method which
  should assure tradespeople of her integrity, only laid them open to premature
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>She decided to take a bold step. Mounting the stairs again, she flung open
  the door of the office.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Acorn," she said in a husky voice, "I want to tell you something in
  strict confidence. I'm broke to the wide."</p>

  <p>The insurance agent swung round in his chair and stared at her.</p>

  <p>In that moment, her hope died entirely. She had staked everything on one
  last throw. And the hard penetrating gaze told her that she had lost.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-20"
     id="ch-20"></a>XX. &mdash; SUSPENSE</h2>

  <p class="first">ACORN made no comment on Vera's statement, but continued to
  look at her. Then he rose, shut the door, and pulled forward a chair.</p>

  <p>"You're sure you wish to tell me anything?" he asked, in a tone which
  suggested the preliminary warning of the police.</p>

  <p>"I must," replied Vera. "You see, when you were talking about a suspicious
  case just now, I suddenly realised that every word applied to me."</p>

  <p>She gulped as she spoke, but Acorn's face only hardened perceptibly. Her
  heart sank as she noticed his lack of response. She had been counting on her
  skill as an actress to save the situation&mdash;if it could be saved; but her
  emotion was plainly wasted on Acorn.</p>

  <p>"You imply that your husband was a poor man when he applied to me for a
  Life Assurance Policy?" he asked frigidly.</p>

  <p>"No, he was rich then," lied Vera. "He'd never bothered about insuring his
  life. There was more than enough for me. Besides&mdash;he didn't come to you,
  did he?"</p>

  <p>She blessed Puggie Williams' strategy when Acorn looked up sharply, and
  she was swift to press her advantage.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to say anything indiscreet, Mr. Acorn, but I distinctly
  remember my husband coming home from golf one day and saying that you were
  always pestering him to insure his life. I admit I was against it, but he
  said he wanted to put a little business your way as he liked you."</p>

  <p>Because he was expecting a pack of traditional lies, the touch of truth
  jolted Acorn out of his official dignity. He relaxed as he gave a shamefaced
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we do tout for business," he admitted. "Our profession is
  overcrowded, like every profession...When did your husband lose his
  money?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He only confessed it to me, just before his illness. I
  think worrying about it pulled him down in the first place."</p>

  <p>"That is more than likely. And I am sure you must regret now that you were
  not sufficiently observant in time."</p>

  <p>Vera welcomed the dislike which returned to Acorn's face and voice. It was
  a sign that he was not sceptical of her tale. She began to realise that he
  had a pre-conceived opinion of herself, which was the reverse of flattering.
  If, therefore, she could tell her story in a manner which would support his
  prejudices, it might carry conviction.</p>

  <p>"I know people think I neglected him," she said defiantly. "But I had some
  reason to be sore. He lost the money through speculation&mdash;and most of it
  was mine. Pa made quite a lot during the War, and I was an only child."</p>

  <p>She hoped that she had conveyed the impression that Charlie had married
  out of his class, as she went on to blacken her character.</p>

  <p>"He kept out of the way, so I couldn't notice he was ill. After that, I'm
  sure I did everything I could."</p>

  <p>"Did he lose everything?" asked Acorn.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He told me he had only his Life Insurance. I remember he said he was
  more good to me dead than alive."</p>

  <p>"He could have raised money on his Insurance Policy. But, doubtless, you
  agreed with him?"</p>

  <p>"No, because of the Suicide Clause. I didn't know then that it was valid
  after one year."</p>

  <p>"That was unfortunate."</p>

  <p>Vera judged the time was ripe for an outburst of natural feeling. Besides,
  she wanted to blow off steam.</p>

  <p>"How can you talk to me like that?" she cried. "Haven't you any heart at
  all? How do you think I feel when I knew that my husband practically
  committed suicide, for my sake&mdash;and all for nothing?"</p>

  <p>Acorn was startled out of his icy calm.</p>

  <p>"You must explain that statement," he said sternly.</p>

  <p>"Why? I'm not on trial. Besides, if you don't believe me, you can ask Dr.
  Dubarry. He told me that my husband could have pulled through, if he had the
  will to live."</p>

  <p>Springing to her feet, she impulsively zipped open her bag.</p>

  <p>"Look," she cried. "Seven and nine. That's all I have to live on till the
  Insurance pays up...But perhaps, now, they won't pay at all. Perhaps I've
  said too much...But you know now why I came to see you. I wanted to ask you
  for something on account."</p>

  <p>Acorn pulled down the corners of his mouth in indecision. Because he
  disliked Vera, he was inclined to believe her tale. It seemed to be told from
  the exclusive standpoint of a selfish woman who nursed an injury.</p>

  <p>He was too human to let her starve. At the same time, his expenses were
  heavy and he ran the risk of making a bad debt.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to make a few inquiries," he said. "But, if these are
  satisfactory, I promise you to press for payment. Meantime, will you let me
  advance you something, privately...Will ten pounds be enough to carry on
  with?"</p>

  <p>He was surprised by Vera's answer, which was not in line with her grasping
  character.</p>

  <p>"Five will do&mdash;and I'll be eternally grateful. I hope, for both our
  sakes, you'll soon be able to pay yourself back."</p>

  <p>Directly Vera had gone, Acorn instructed his typist to telephone to Dr.
  Dubarry's house for his Continental address. When it was supplied by his
  housekeeper, he wrote to the doctor, asking full information on the details
  of the late Charles Baxter's last illness. Although he explained that it was
  a mere formality, pending settlement of an Insurance Claim, two of his
  questions were rather curious.</p>

  <p>He wanted to know: (1) The mental condition and attitude of the deceased,
  together with the degree of his vitality; and (2) Whether there was any
  symptoms which were not entirely in accordance with the illness for which he
  was being treated.</p>

  <p>Dr. Dubarry was furious when his holiday was interrupted by business. As
  he sat on the front, in east-windy sunshine, staring at a sea which his
  tinted glasses converted to the hue of the Thames Estuary, he cursed the
  officiousness of Insurance Companies.</p>

  <p>His reply, however, cleared the case of any element of doubt. Acorn showed
  the letter to his wife, as he sat over the fire, drinking the Ovaltine which
  was her prescription for a good night's rest for the bread-winner. Besides
  being of proven loyalty and discretion, she always saved him the trouble of
  explaining the obvious.</p>

  <p>"Did you suspect poison?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I had to make certain that his loving wife had not conspired with
  Williams to get him out of the way."</p>

  <p>"But Dr. Dubarry says he was lacking in spirit and just let himself go
  out."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he did her dirty work for her." Acorn's voice was bitter as aloes.
  "She's provided for, which is all she troubles about."</p>

  <p>"All the same she must eat. You'd better rush it through as soon as
  possible. If not, she'll be coming in to see you every day and upsetting you.
  Pay up, and forget her."</p>

  <p>Acorn took his wife's advice, but he did not hasten to reassure the widow.
  While she waited, she was driven to secret shifts and personal economies,
  which included a drastic starvation diet. As she had to keep up appearances,
  most of her five pounds was paid in wages to the maid, who had begun to
  inquire about "the master's dying wish."</p>

  <p>Vera stared her down.</p>

  <p>"You understand, Minnie," she said, "I'm not bound to pay you, by law. But
  I shall respect my husband's wishes&mdash;even if he was wandering, at the
  time. All the legacies will be paid directly the estate is wound up."</p>

  <p>The girl thanked her with a subtle lack of respect. It had already become
  evident to Vera from trifles, which showed the direction of the wind, that
  she had suffered socially from the death of her husband. While Charlie's
  gentlemanly appearance and manners had appealed to the local imagination, she
  had been accepted, for his sake.</p>

  <p>Now that he was in his grave, the town was only waiting for proof to label
  her an adventuress. She was both a blonde and an undignified widow, in her
  flapper dress, with an Alice comb in her long fair mop of hair. She was also
  unconventional in her behaviour to tradespeople, and rather too expert at
  back-chat.</p>

  <p>She was too shrewd not to notice the gradual shrinkage of respect. Instead
  of the "Madam" of her married life, she was sometimes called "Mum," or even
  "Miss."</p>

  <p>"Once they know I'm broke, I'm finished," she thought.</p>

  <p>She had only one hope at this stage. Directly she had news that there was
  no funds at the Bank, she was driven, by necessity, to violate her own
  precautionary code. She wrote directly to a certain Mr. Chester Beaverbrook,
  at an address at Brixton, asking for an immediate loan of ten pounds.</p>

  <p>"If any one besides Charlie opens that, they will know I'm on the rocks,"
  she reflected.</p>

  <p>It was opened by the Post Office officials, after it had been returned
  from the Acre Lane boarding-house, with "not known at this address" pencilled
  on the envelope.</p>

  <p>When Vera received it from the Dead Letter Department, her face seemed to
  shrink visibly. She felt sick with suspense, although she was not worried
  over Charlie's safety.</p>

  <p>"Stick to it, sweetheart," she murmured bitterly. "I'm the sucker, not
  you. And when you're in a jam, write to me. I'd <i>love</i> it."</p>

  <p>The following night, Vera went into the kitchen after Minnie had left, and
  sat with her knees pressed close to the bars of the stove. While she fed it
  with rubbish, she began to make out a list of Charlie's clothes. It was her
  intention to sell them, privately, to a wardrobe-dealer in York, and to tell
  Minnie that they had been sent to the Church Army.</p>

  <p>Presently she heard the postman's knock. He had brought her a note from
  Acorn&mdash;a few typed lines, telling her that she could draw upon him for
  any reasonable advance of her Insurance, which would soon be paid.</p>

  <p>Vera made up the fire and relaxed, for the first time in weeks, over a
  cigarette. At last she could think of the future and not shrink from it.
  Every small account would be settled immediately. Minnie should have her
  fiver&mdash;confound her. Charlie's clothes would be sent to the Vicar's wife
  for the local poor.</p>

  <p>Once again she thought of Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Wonder where you are, sweetheart. Lording it at the Ritz? Well, one of
  these fine days you'll be cropping up again."</p>

  <p>She did not know that she had already received indirect news of him, that
  morning, when she read the account of a very ugly incident in her paper.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-21"
     id="ch-21"></a>XXI. &mdash; ACT OF GOD</h2>

  <p class="first">WHILE Vera's period of anxiety was nearly over Charlie's
  good time was drawing to its end. The dwindling notes in his case warned him
  that it was not safe to stay longer at the hotel. During his last week, he
  had to exercise some economy; he could not choose his meals without regard to
  price, or tip for every trifling service.</p>

  <p>In spite of this omission, he remained popular with the staff. He was easy
  to please, and always ready to listen to a life-history or story of
  injustice. Besides, amid the flux of incessant arrivals and departures, he
  had acquired the status of the oldest inhabitant. Every one liked him for his
  pleasant unassuming personality, while he was on his toes to render small
  courtesies to ladies&mdash;especially those who were no longer young.</p>

  <p>"You haven't forgotten your mother," the mature barmaid told him, when he
  presented her with a carnation.</p>

  <p>"She died before I was born," he replied sadly, and neither of them
  noticed his slip.</p>

  <p>"Not married?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. Since marriage ends with the grave, Chester Beaverbrook
  could truthfully claim bachelor status. All the same, he would have exchanged
  all the beautiful and fashionable ladies&mdash;who were not his to
  barter&mdash;for a sight of Vera.</p>

  <p>He used to stare wistfully at the revolving-doors, wishing that he could
  see a small, jaunty blonde&mdash;with one blue eye and the other blacked out
  by her cap&mdash;tripping into the lounge. After rushing to meet her, he
  would cross to the bureau and engage a suite, as a compliment to his
  wife.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile he was faced with the problem of going away without giving any
  tips. Like other good men and true, he did not want to be remembered after he
  was gone, so long as the staff was attentive up to the last minute.</p>

  <p>Presently he received an inspiration. Crossing to the bureau, he asked for
  his bill.</p>

  <p>"Are you leaving us?" inquired the clerk regretfully.</p>

  <p>"Only for the night. But I might stop a bus, so I can't go away owing you
  anything."</p>

  <p>The clerk smiled cynically at the unnecessary assurance.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you will hold my room until to-morrow morning?" went on
  Charlie. "Then I can leave my luggage and only take what I require for the
  night."</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I'll pay for my dinner, to-night, instead of signing."</p>

  <p>His business concluded, Charlie took the lift up to his own floor, where
  he lingered until he met the chambermaid. With characteristic thought, he
  would not ring for her, as he had noticed that she was flat-footed.</p>

  <p>As he was explaining his plans to her, a big, expensively-gowned lady
  turned down the short passage where they stood and tried to open her bedroom
  door. She fumbled so helplessly with her key, that, before the chambermaid
  could move, Charlie had sprung forward to the rescue.</p>

  <p>"Allow me," he said gallantly.</p>

  <p>He received no thanks, but a glassy stare of offended dignity, as the lady
  stumbled into her room and slammed the door behind her.</p>

  <p>Charlie raised his brows and shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Very sad," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she's quite a lady," said the chambermaid. "She always behaves
  quietly in the public rooms. But she likes her drop of tiddley. She just goes
  to bed with a bottle of brandy, and sleeps it off."</p>

  <p>"Degrading."</p>

  <p>"No, she's all right. It's what she likes. And she's got the money to pay
  for it."</p>

  <p>From the chambermaid's championship, Charlie concluded that the alcoholic
  lady was generous with tips. Smiling at the thought of his own strategy, he
  went into his room and began to pack reluctantly. It was not a pleasant job,
  for he hated the prospect of Brixton. When he had pitched his belongings into
  his suitcase, he lay down on the bed with a cigarette, and a noon edition of
  the <i>Standard.</i></p>

  <p>He was conscious of a sense of guilt, for he knew Vera would counsel "Go,
  while the going's good." But he didn't want to leave his small luxurious
  quarters. He had reserved his room at the Acre Lane boarding-house, over the
  telephone, so there was no need to hurry as long as he was there in time for
  dinner.</p>

  <p>As he lay staring up at the ceiling, watching the rings of fading smoke,
  for the first time he regretted his magnificent gesture when he tore up
  Puggie's card.</p>

  <p>If he were in touch with him he could find out the progress of the
  Insurance proceedings and know for exactly how long he had to finance
  himself. It was annoying to stint, in order to accumulate an unnecessary
  surplus.</p>

  <p>Besides, he could not hang out indefinitely&mdash;in which contingency he
  might have applied to Puggie for aid. But he had cut the wires.</p>

  <p>As the first real fear of the future thrust its ugly snout up through the
  clouds of his dream, he resolutely shut his eyes and began to drowse in the
  warmth. He thought of the girl in the train, and clasped her in a passionate
  tango until he was jolted back to reality by the conviction that he had
  chosen the wrong dance. She was too nice a girl to slide and clutch.</p>

  <p>The spell broken, his thoughts wandered in a fresh direction. He wondered
  whether it would be cheaper to leave his suitcase behind him and steal away
  from the hotel without paying his last bill.</p>

  <p>He was trying to calculate the value of his few belongings, when he smelt
  burning fabric. Springing up, he saw a large black patch, with smouldering
  edges, spreading over the coverlet from its source&mdash;the stump of his
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>In a second he tore it away from the bed and beat out the flame. Then,
  with panic-stricken eyes, he took stock of the damage. The article, which was
  made of blue artificial silk, was ruined, and the blankets also were badly
  scorched.</p>

  <p>Breathing heavily, he squeezed the bedspread into the wastepaper basket,
  grabbed his case, and rushed from the room, slamming the door behind him. Too
  flurried to ring for the lift, he hurried down the stairs and then forced
  himself to stroll casually across the lounge.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the friendly clerk at the bureau was concerned about the
  result of a race, so did not notice his trembling fingers when he counted out
  some notes. But he only gave half his attention to receipting the bill, while
  Charlie fumed at the delay.</p>

  <p>At any moment the chambermaid might enter the room and discover the
  catastrophe. Although he had not absconded without paying his account, he was
  fraudulently evading the consequences of his accident. She would also see
  that he had removed all his luggage and his little subterfuge might be
  exposed.</p>

  <p>After his popularity, he could not bear the revelation. Worse still, he
  would be called upon to pay for the damage, which would make a big hole in
  his reserves.</p>

  <p>At last, the leisurely clerk handed him his change.</p>

  <p>"See you to-morrow," gasped Charlie, forcing a smile.</p>

  <p>He hurried towards the door, waving aside the uniformed youths who seemed
  to sprout out of the carpet.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, son. See you to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Then he felt the door banging against him, pushing him from the hotel. He
  had but one more lion to pass&mdash;the commissionaire who wanted to call a
  taxi.</p>

  <p>"No, thanks," Charlie assured him. "I prefer to walk. The case is quite
  light."</p>

  <p>Although his arm was nearly tugged out of its socket, he swung his luggage
  and went off at the double. When he had turned the corner he changed the case
  to his other hand, but he felt its weight no longer as he lugged it along the
  crowded streets.</p>

  <p>Everything had been carried through without a hitch. No one knew of the
  little trouble up in Room 194. In his exhilaration, he hurried down the steps
  into the Piccadilly Subway, where he stopped at a machine to get a ticket to
  Charing Cross.</p>

  <p>Just as he was putting in his pennies, he was petrified by a sudden
  recollection. When he tore the bedspread off the blankets, he might not have
  pinched out every spark. If it were still smouldering, it might set fire to
  the newspaper at the bottom of the wastepaper basket.</p>

  <p>He broke out into a sweat as he wondered whether he ought to retrace his
  steps, and find out if there was any danger of a blaze. Then he shook his
  head at the unnecessary risk.</p>

  <p>"It's all <i>right</i>," he told himself.</p>

  <p>But his guilty curiosity was so strong that he felt impelled to leave his
  case in the cloakroom and return to the hotel. Standing on the opposite side
  of the road, he gazed up at the granite pile.</p>

  <p>It looked exactly as when he left it&mdash;imposing and
  impressive&mdash;immune to any assault of earthquake, flood, or fire. Once
  again he cursed himself for a fool as he stole into the side street, from
  which he could get a cross-sectional view of his recent room.</p>

  <p>As he stared up at the window it presented no unusual features. It was
  still open, in proof that the chambermaid had not entered it, for she had a
  dislike of fresh air, which admitted smuts. He could distinguish the net
  veiling and the heavier curtains which drew together at night.</p>

  <p>He was on the point of turning away when he blinked his eyes
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>A faint red glow was flickering inside the room.</p>

  <p>His heart leaped violently as he wondered what he ought to do. His natural
  impulse was to warn the clerk at the bureau&mdash;but, unfortunately, there
  were complications. It was manifestly impossible for him to return. He had
  burned his boats, besides the bed-spread.</p>

  <p>If he went back at this early stage, the fire would be traced to himself.
  Instead of getting any credit, he would be subjected to a grilling and held
  responsible for the cost of the damage, which would be increased by salvage
  operations.</p>

  <p>Once again he was a victim of Fate. He told himself that he must consider
  Vera. For her sake his name must not appear in the papers. Besides, it was
  only a small blaze; probably it was only the newspaper, which would soon burn
  itself out. In any case, if he had seen it first, the next passer-by would
  raise the alarm. Although he felt a certain responsibility, the fire,
  undeniably, was an Act of God.</p>

  <p>All the same, he felt like a criminal as he sneaked away. But he consoled
  himself by doses of common sense. His room was at the end of a very short
  wing, leading from the central corridor. At this time of day, no one would be
  trapped. There were rows of fire-extinguishers on each floor, while the fire
  was bound to be discovered before it could spread.</p>

  <p>As he hurried back to the Circus, people got in his way, but he thrust
  them aside with a ruthless relapse from his habitual courtesy. He wanted to
  curse the women, to stamp on their toes and push them into the gutter. When
  he reached the Underground Station, he experienced something of the sensation
  of a coursed rabbit returning to the safety of its burrow. But he dared not
  linger, lest the police should be already on the track of the firebug.</p>

  <p>He ran down the escalator, nearly knocking down a girl, and reached the
  platform just as a train was rushing out of the Tube. The warm, crowded
  carriage seemed a little cell of safety as it whirled him away from the scene
  of his misfortune. None of the passengers stared at him or connected him with
  any unpleasant episode.</p>

  <p>By the time he reached Charing Cross, the hotel had ceased to exist. The
  long ride in a No. 18 tramcar acted as a further tonic on his nervous system.
  He rolled along the Embankment, across Blackfriars Bridge, and past the
  Elephant, with the sensation of entering a safe new world.</p>

  <p>The boarding-house was a substantial Victorian building, partly screened
  from the road by a neglected garden, planted with trees of the evergreen
  variety. The maid showed the new guest into a dark hall, but through the open
  door of the dining-room, he could see the red-caked heart of a fire. There
  was the smell of tea-cake, the strains of wireless, and the shrill notes of
  feminine voices.</p>

  <p>The proprietress&mdash;a buxom elderly woman&mdash;welcomed him with a
  Welsh accent.</p>

  <p>"You're just in time for tea. We're sitting in the gloaming. Miss Evans,
  just switch off that noise and give us some light on the subject."</p>

  <p>"No, no, not for me," protested Charlie. "Please don't move, ladies. You
  make such a charming picture."</p>

  <p>Then he turned to his hostess and spoke with a throb of genuine
  feeling.</p>

  <p>"You can't imagine what a treat all this is, after an hotel. I feel I've
  come to a <i>home.</i>"</p>

  <p>That remark not only melted the proprietress, but appealed to the guests.
  Before that warm and greasy meal was finished, Charlie had talked himself
  into general favour.</p>

  <p>As he was going up to his room, Miss Evans&mdash;the
  secretary-housekeeper-entertainer&mdash;spoke to him.</p>

  <p>"'A pity I didn't know you were coming, Mr. Beaverbrook. A letter came for
  you a few days ago, but I returned it to the P.O."</p>

  <p>"What postmark? asked Charlie.</p>

  <p>"I never noticed. We get such lots to throw out. What hotel have you been
  staying at?"</p>

  <p>Some instinct warned Charlie to be wary.</p>

  <p>"Strand Palace," he lied.</p>

  <p>He was glad of his evasion, that evening, when they sat at dinner around
  one long table. One of the boarders, who went to the City daily, suffered
  from the delusion that no one else read a paper, so he always told the news
  to the resident ladies.</p>

  <p>"They had a fire at the Monopol to-day," he said presently.</p>

  <p>"A bad one?" asked Charlie huskily.</p>

  <p>"No, just a couple of rooms gutted. They soon got it under."</p>

  <p>"How providential it wasn't at night," remarked a widow. "It is so
  terrible to think of people being burned in their beds."</p>

  <p>"Quite." Charlie threw her an approving glance. "These daylight fires are
  never serious."</p>

  <p>"Well, one poor woman lost her life," said the man with the newspaper.
  "She was ill and trapped in her room."</p>

  <p>Charlie pushed away his plate as the blood rushed up to his head. He felt
  furious at this unnecessary complication. He wanted to bang on the table and
  shout out the truth, as the women broke out in a chorus of sympathetic
  twitters.</p>

  <p>"Don't pity her. She had only herself to blame. The way these papers cover
  up things. Ill? She was <i>drunk.</i>"</p>

  <p>"Poor soul," said the widow. "Unable to stir, and trapped by flames. Why
  didn't she ring the bell?"</p>

  <p>"Probably unconscious," explained the City man. "She'd be suffocated by
  the smoke."</p>

  <p>As he paused, Miss Evans asked a question which drained the blood from
  Charlie's brain and left it feeling empty and cold.</p>

  <p>"Do they know the cause of the fire?"</p>

  <p>"Trust them for that...May I trouble you for the beetroot?"</p>

  <p>He stopped speaking to give his attention to the safe transfer of the red
  dripping slices, from the glass dish to his plate.</p>

  <p>"The Insurance chaps always come down, like bloodhounds on the scent," he
  explained. "You see, it might be deliberate arson."</p>

  <p>"Was it?" asked Miss Evans.</p>

  <p>"Was what? Oh, the Monopol fire. No, the poor lady had been smoking in
  bed, so they concluded she'd set the bed on fire. Well, what's the programme
  for to-night? Cards or billiards?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Beaverbrook, will you play Lexicon?" asked the widow.</p>

  <p>"Enchanted," he replied.</p>

  <p>He felt light-hearted as a boy. He was among friends. At that moment, he
  would not have exchanged the boarding-house for all the grandeur of the
  Monopol. He was so glad that the poor alcoholic lady had not suffered. Never
  knew when she passed out. A happy release, when she might have endured
  agonies from cirrhosis of the liver.</p>

  <p>In the gush of his relief, he impulsively went out into the hall and spoke
  into the telephone, after having inserted his penny in the box, with the
  reminder that most people forget this act of elementary honesty.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Monopol? Chester Beaverbrook speaking. That you, Mr. Clive?
  Sorry to hear of your fire. Don't trouble to claim for any of my things. I'm
  called away to the Continent, so can't be bothered about anything."</p>

  <p>The clerk replied by a question which made Charlie ring off in a hurry.
  His eyes looked scared as he went back to the dining-room, for the clerk had
  put him a poser.</p>

  <p>"How did you know it was <i>your</i> room that was burned out?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-22"
     id="ch-22"></a>XXII. &mdash; No Address</h2>

  <p class="first">ALTHOUGH Charles passed a wakeful night and stayed on the
  rack for several days, his luck held. Either the young man at the bureau
  attached no importance to his own query&mdash;or his attention had been
  distracted by a tiresome guest. Whatever the cause, he made no attempt to
  trace the telephone call.</p>

  <p>It was some time, however, before Charles recovered his nerve. Not daring
  to venture down to the West End, lest he should be recognised, he stayed
  chiefly at Brixton. Sometimes he took the tram up Brixton Hill and visited
  the Locarno at Streatham Hill, to watch the dancing. It gave him a pleasant
  feeling of superiority to criticise the form, although he did not enter into
  competition with the dancers.</p>

  <p>Most of the time he moved in a dream of future opulence, like a monarch
  who awaits the end of exile. Although the proprietress of the boarding-house
  gave excellent value for her low terms, he loathed his surroundings, his
  meals, and his company. But he hid his feelings so successfully that he was
  soon the most popular boarder.</p>

  <p>The residential ladies repaid his attentions with invitations to tea-shops
  and cinemas. Since they always insisted on paying, because he reminded them
  of a favourite son&mdash;or some equally respectable relative&mdash;he had
  plenty of economical entertainment.</p>

  <p>It helped to kill the time until the end of his first month, when his
  impatience mounted to fever-pitch. Vera had spoken of two months as a
  possible time-limit. Seven weeks had passed since he left Starminster, so the
  eighth week was the critical period&mdash;which might bring Vera to his
  release.</p>

  <p>Day after day, he waited for a letter or message, only to meet with fresh
  disappointment. As the third month began to slip away, his anxiety grew
  acute. The days lengthened, and all the gardens up Brixton Hill had
  green-tipped bushes and sprouting trees, while he grew perilously near the
  end of his money. Soon he was driven to wash his socks and handkerchiefs,
  secretly, in the bathroom, and to brush his teeth&mdash;of which he was
  proud&mdash;with salt, stolen from the sideboard, instead of toothpaste.</p>

  <p>The urgent need to make a little money turned his thoughts again to
  Children's Competitions. Little Chester Beaverbrook&mdash;aged
  ten&mdash;began to try his skill at crosswords and hidden names.</p>

  <p>Unluckily, now that the necessity was vital, he proved inferior to little
  Charles Baxter, who was a mere luxury-hound. Not a single postal-order was
  sent to the Brixton boarding-house. It was true that Auntie Flossie printed
  on her Page: "Your handwriting is charming, dear," but she awarded the prize
  to some one else.</p>

  <p>What enraged him most was the unsporting way in which editors relied on
  alternative words. The little brutes of capitalists who could afford to buy
  an extra copy of the paper had an unfair advantage over a worthy young
  competitor who had begun to count his pence and wring out his socks. Furious
  at the indirect injustice to himself, Charlie appealed for sympathy to his
  favourite widow.</p>

  <p>"Look at this." He pointed to the Children's Page of a daily paper. "This
  is a really stiff Competition, yet they only offer a prize of two-and-six.
  It's contemptible to economise at the expense of children."</p>

  <p>Another lady who played bridge&mdash;as Sarah Battle played
  whist&mdash;"for the rigour of the game," snorted.</p>

  <p>"They should offer nothing. Any child with the right spirit should compete
  for the sport of the effort."</p>

  <p>She was sorry when Charlie slunk out of the room as though he had actually
  been reproved in public, in proof of his ultra-sensitive disposition.</p>

  <p>He went upstairs to re-count his money, although he knew his financial
  position to the last penny. With stringent economy, he could stay only one
  week longer at the boarding-house. He knew exactly how the good-natured
  proprietress tackled the problem of a non-paying guest.</p>

  <p>There was a certain old and valued patron for whom a room had to be found,
  regardless of the resident boarder. Now that he was threatened with "Mr.
  Jenkins," who would certainly exact preferential treatment in the matter of
  his own attic, Charlie realised that the boarding-house was the most
  desirable spot on earth.</p>

  <p>He compared it no longer with the splendours of an hotel. His sentimental
  brown eyes filled with tears as he told himself that he was happy here. The
  beds were clean, the food well-cooked. He loved the charming elderly ladies
  who were so cruelly christened "The Tabbies" by the young City workers.</p>

  <p>At this crisis, his reaction was characteristic. Vera would have argued
  that there was a hitch in the Insurance proceedings, but, since they were so
  near success, they must tread, as though on eggs. It was only a matter of
  tightening the belt and raising the wind.</p>

  <p>But Charlie went to bits, just as if he had coughed his identity to the
  wide, after having duped the undertaker to regard him as a corpse. Although
  he was forbidden to write to Vera, he decided to give her a hint that he was
  in need of immediate help.</p>

  <p>"She'd twenty quid," he thought. "She's not had my expenses, having to put
  up at hotels. She's all right. She can get things on tick, or borrow off old
  Wright."</p>

  <p>Otherwise, of course, he would not dream of adding to her worries. He
  assured himself of this fact as he composed a diplomatic note.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">A man, Charles, who has been in your employ as
  jobbing-gardener, has applied to me for financial help. He seems a superior
  type and is almost destitute. Will you let me know by return if this is a
  deserving case. I do not wish to be imposed on, yet I dare not risk letting
  this poor fellow starve.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours faithfully,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Chester Beaverbrook</span>.</p><br>

  <p>After he had posted the letter his hopes soared. He went to the cinema
  that afternoon with his favourite widow. The picture was "Nell Gwynne," which
  seemed a good omen, for he was sure that Vera would "let not poor Charles
  starve."</p>

  <p>But, although he met the postman daily, no reply came from Vera. At the
  end of his last week of grace, he paid his bill with his usual smile&mdash;as
  though it were his privilege&mdash;and went upstairs, to think.</p>

  <p>On Monday morning, he spent almost his last coppers in tram-fare to a
  suburban <i>Palais de Danse</i>, at a safe distance from Brixton. After
  passing a test successfully, he was allowed to enter the pen and wait to be
  chosen as a dancing partner. The payment was sixpence, out of which a
  percentage had to be paid back to the management.</p>

  <p>But he was assured by a fellow-gigolo that it was a lucrative job.</p>

  <p>"The dances are cut very short," he said, "so, when a special client
  wishes to retain you, by the hour, it works out quite an expensive
  entertainment, for the lady."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Charlie got none of the jam, but only the scrapings from
  the pot. He felt down on his luck, so he looked it, and was generally passed
  over. The knowledge that he was a failure was fertiliser to his
  inferiority-complex.</p>

  <p>He moped in his pen in exactly the psychological mood to invite
  humiliations. Fragile ladies&mdash;heavy as lead&mdash;trod on his toes, and
  fat ladies&mdash;light as bubbles&mdash;criticised his step, although he knew
  he could dance any one off the floor.</p>

  <p>At the end of a week of mental torture, he was still without enough money
  to pay his bill.</p>

  <p>As he was wondering how he could meet the deficit, he had a stroke of
  luck. His favourite widow, who vaguely reminded him of a white Persian cat,
  asked him to play <i>Bézique</i>.</p>

  <p>After a rapid mental calculation, he gallantly consented. Daylight Saving
  had come, together with warm April weather, which made the Afternoon Session
  at the <i>Palais de Danse</i> unprofitable for the pen.</p>

  <p>"I warn you I shall cheat," he said with a smile.</p>

  <p>After having eased his conscience by confession, and put the lady on her
  guard, he proceeded to fleece her. She was very short-sighted, and as she was
  too vain to wear her glasses, she proved an easy victim.</p>

  <p>When he went from the room with sufficient cash to pay his bill in full,
  like an honest man, a very old lady&mdash;who dozed all day in her special
  chair, like a tortoise, opened one horny lid.</p>

  <p>"That young man cheated," she declared in a deep bass voice.</p>

  <p>The brainless widow smiled, for she was not at all simple. But she had
  seen a pair of Charlie's socks which he had forgotten to remove from the
  bathroom, and she wished to make a small contribution to his laundry
  bill.</p>

  <p>"So did I," she said. "It was all fun. He's exactly like my own son who
  was lost at sea."</p>

  <p>"So was my husband lost at sea," grunted the old woman. "And when he was
  half-seas over. The way that young man resembles every one's relatives would
  mean scandalous inter-marriage, if it were true."</p>

  <p>While the ladies discussed him Charlie heard the postman's knock and ran
  downstairs to the hall. An official letter awaited him on the slab. It was
  from the Dead Letter Department, and when he opened it, it contained his own
  letter to Vera.</p>

  <p>On the envelope was scrawled, <i>"Gone away from this address."</i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-23"
     id="ch-23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; UNDER THE CLOCK</h2>

  <p class="first">CHARLIE felt the furnace-fumes of passion rising to his head
  as he stared at the few words which held the history of the case. They told
  him that there had been no delay over the Insurance. Vera had received the
  cheque and had gone away from Starminster, leaving no address behind.</p>

  <p>It was deliberate treachery. She had double-crossed him, for she did not
  mean to be traced. At this moment she was probably on the Continent, or on
  her way to the States. She knew his address, yet had not written. Had the
  letter been sent&mdash;and gone astray, in that case she would have come
  herself to the boarding-house.</p>

  <p>He laughed hollowly as he asked a question of his white-lipped reflection
  in the mirror.</p>

  <p>"Why should she come? I'm only her husband."</p>

  <p>He reminded himself that he was the perfect dupe. He had fulfilled his
  share of the bargain faithfully. He had financed the scheme. Even if he felt
  uneasy sometimes, when Vera and Puggie whispered together in corners, he had
  trusted them too implicitly to expect anything but reciprocal treatment.</p>

  <p>And here he was, without funds, stranded in London.</p>

  <p>That evening, he had a most disastrous Session at the <i>Palais de
  Danse</i>. On his way to the bus, the most popular dancing-partner&mdash;who
  was always engaged by the hour&mdash;condescended, from the peak of his
  popularity, to patronise the failure.</p>

  <p>"D'you mind a hint, old man? You dance quite well, but&mdash;could you
  leave off those glasses? All right, you know, for Henry Hall or Harold Lloyd,
  but they're no good without pep and personality. Make you look like a
  schoolmaster, you know. You don't mind, old man?"</p>

  <p>"I'm only too glad to take a tip from an expert," Charlie assured him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, just luck, old man. <i>You'll</i> come to it."</p>

  <p>Although Charlie was raging inwardly, he turned on the winning smile,
  which was the secret of his popularity. But he got even later with the
  star-partner, for he lay awake on purpose to insult him.</p>

  <p>"One last word of advice, my good fellow," he sneered into his pillow.
  "Stick to your fourth-rate suburb. Never venture to the West End. <i>We</i>
  dance with our brains&mdash;not our toes."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he remembered the Tango dancer, whose complexion&mdash;according
  to the girl, Peggy&mdash;had come out of a bottle.</p>

  <p>"That's it," he cried excitedly. "That's my solution."</p>

  <p>When he awoke, some hours later, his exhilaration had died down, and he
  felt depressed at the thought of the ordeal ahead of him. However, he was
  driven by necessity to carry his resolution into practice. He paid,
  therefore, two visits: the first, to a pawnbroker, where he pledged his
  watch&mdash;and the second, to a toilet saloon.</p>

  <p>He felt acutely humiliated during the lengthy operation of having his hair
  dyed, for he had leisure to reflect on his future. Weeks, months, even years
  of sitting in a pen, waiting to be chosen by fat women who wore elastic
  girdles instead of restraining boned corsets.</p>

  <p>The little underground room was close and steamy, and smelt of hot hair.
  It nauseated him, while he suspected the hairdresser&mdash;who had a shock of
  beautiful silver curls, of veiling contempt under professional flattery.</p>

  <p>When at last he got out of the chair, he shrank from his unfamiliar
  reflection in the glass. Glancing at it out of the corner of his eyes, he
  paid his bill and slunk out of the shop.</p>

  <p>It was not until he was outside in the street that he realised the future
  complications. He would have to explain the transformation when he returned
  to the boarding-house. Feeling miserably self-conscious, and shrinking from
  the spring sunshine, he lunched at an A.B.C. in order to postpone the
  ordeal.</p>

  <p>After he had spun out the eating of a poached egg, he took a cheap seat at
  the cinema, seeking, not entertainment, but a refuge. As he stared
  indifferently at the pictures, he repented bitterly his visit to the toilet
  saloon. He had only forfeited his Starminster title of "a gentleman," and
  turned himself into a painted mountebank.</p>

  <p>He stayed inside the cinema until he was forced to go, by the pangs of
  hunger. When he reached the boarding-house, the first gong was being banged.
  Putting on his glasses again and pulling his hat low over his eyes, he
  ventured into the hall.</p>

  <p>Miss Evans stopped&mdash;gong-stick suspended&mdash;to stare at him. To
  his surprise, she recognised him, for she laughed.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you at first," she told him. "Going to a Fancy Dress as a
  Sheik?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he lied weakly, postponing the inevitable confession.</p>

  <p>"I hope she's worth it. Good hunting. Oh, here's a wire for you."</p>

  <p>As Charlie ripped open the envelope, he could scarcely credit the good
  news which flashed before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Meet me seven under clock Victoria&mdash;Vera."</p>

  <p>After the first shock of relief, he was smitten by a familiar sensation of
  guilt. He could imagine Vera's biting sarcasm when they met. Fortunately,
  Miss Evans had recognised him, or she might have rejected him as an
  impostor.</p>

  <p>"When did this come?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Soon after you went out this morning," replied Miss Evans. "Why? Is it
  important?"</p>

  <p>"I might have saved myself a lot of trouble and expense."</p>

  <p>"Oh, can't she come? Is the Fancy Dress off?"</p>

  <p>"Definitely off. Miss Evans, do I look a fearful bounder?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not too bad. Besides, they say love is blind."</p>

  <p>"Let's hope so. I shan't be back to-night. Don't be shocked. It's my
  wife."</p>

  <p>Miss Evans gave a flat little laugh.</p>

  <p>"Married? What will your ladies say?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, they won't miss me. But I shall miss them. I'd like to wish them all
  'Good-bye,' only&mdash;" He touched his brown face and added, "I want them to
  remember <i>me.</i>"</p>

  <p>"We shall miss you," said Miss Evans gruffly.</p>

  <p>He smiled at her as he held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I've been so happy here. Thank you so much&mdash;for everything. I
  wonder...May I kiss you?"</p>

  <p>His manner was as simple as a boy's when he returns thanks for a party,
  and Miss Evans could appreciate the quality of his kiss, for&mdash;like every
  good woman of over thirty&mdash;she had received the Quota.</p>

  <p>Meals were early at the boarding-house, so the Stockwell tram took Charlie
  to Victoria, in good time for his appointment. He was first to take up his
  station under the clock, and as the minutes crept on, he experienced the
  familiar qualms and doubts.</p>

  <p>It was five past seven when Vera came, while Charlie was scanning the
  shifting crowd, in vain, for the jaunty little figure. He stared at her, in
  surprise, before he spoke. It was not only her new and expensive outfit which
  made him pause, for she walked with a limp and her head was bandaged.</p>

  <p>"Vera," he cried, his voice choked with emotion. "I can't believe it's
  really you."</p>

  <p>She turned round sharply at the familiar voice, stared at him with
  incredulous eyes, and then threw her arms around his neck.</p>

  <p>"Why, sweetheart," she said, "what <i>have</i> you done to yourself? You
  look marvellous. I never thought my own husband could give me a thrill."</p>

  <p>She did not know that she made history in that sentence, when she slew
  Charlie's inferiority-complex, and&mdash;at the same time&mdash;sealed her
  doom.</p>

  <p>Charlie's thoughts rushed instantly to the girl in the train.</p>

  <p>"I thrill you, do I?" he asked. "But what's the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you when we're eating. I've got a suite at the Grosvenor. Just
  to celebrate."</p>

  <p>Charles entered the hotel as our First Parent might have re-entered
  Paradise, had the Edict been withdrawn. Now that it was over, he could
  appreciate the boarding-house era, because of the joy of contrast. As they
  sat in the restaurant, he noticed that more than one smart woman looked at
  him with interest, while Vera was frank in her admiration.</p>

  <p>"I can't take my eyes off you," she declared.</p>

  <p>He could understand that, for he had the same difficulty with his
  reflection in the mirror. He realised now that he was just as striking as the
  tango-dancer, but infinitely better-looking. The bottled sunburn threw up the
  polish of his black hair and the whiteness of his teeth. It also revealed a
  touch of the Orient in his thick well-cut lips. His large dark eyes no longer
  suggested a sentimental dog of affectionate nature, but hinted at leashed
  amours.</p>

  <p>"Why have you kept me waiting so long?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't help it. You see, the Insurance people came across all right, so
  I tidied up at Starminster and went on to Scarborough, as I dared not hare
  straight to you. And then I <i>would</i> get mixed up in a car smash."</p>

  <p>Charlie gave a cry of genuine concern. He was fond of Vera, while he
  realised that&mdash;had she been killed&mdash;his fortunes would have been
  wrecked.</p>

  <p>"Were you badly hurt?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Concussion. I was knocked out for days and knew nothing. That's why I
  recovered so soon. I rested my brain&mdash;and it needed it after the last
  bit of Starminster."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you let me know?"</p>

  <p>"I was afraid to let the nurse write, for fear the insurance was keeping a
  tab on my letters. I was horribly worried about you, but I had to wait."</p>

  <p>"So had I. It was hell."</p>

  <p>She smiled at the passion in his voice.</p>

  <p>"What shall we do now," she asked. "A show, or get tight for once in my
  life? I'm a lame duck. Can't dance."</p>

  <p>Charlie chose a straight play, which bored Vera, but which might appeal to
  the taste of a nice girl. Feeling secure from recognition, he searched for
  her amid the audience in vain.</p>

  <p>He was compensated for his disappointment on his return to the luxury of
  their suite.</p>

  <p>"I shan't go back to Brixton," he confided as he came out of the bathroom,
  after a long scented soak. "That place got right under my skin. Only one
  bathroom, and all the enamel worn off the bottom of the bath. Revolting. I'll
  send them a cheque, to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"No, I'll go and settle up," said Vera. "I've got to pack up your things
  and take them away with me."</p>

  <p>"Can't we buy new ones?"</p>

  <p>"We can. But the police like their fun. Unless we cover up the traces, we
  make it too easy for them."</p>

  <p>Charlie frowned at the reminder, before he drew Vera on his knee and
  stopped her mouth with a kiss.</p>

  <p>But in the middle of the night, Vera remembered something else. It was
  such a disquieting memory that she awoke her husband.</p>

  <p>"Charlie," she asked, "who locked Miss Belson in your wardrobe?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Belson? I don't know her. I don't know what you're talking
  about."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you do."</p>

  <p>Now that he was hidden from her by the darkness, the spell of Charlie's
  new personality was broken. The face might be that of a handsome stranger,
  but the voice was the familiar quaver of Charlie Baxter, when he had been
  convicted of a lie.</p>

  <p>"I found her there, myself, not long after you had gone," she told
  him.</p>

  <p>"Alive?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"She'd about half a puff left. But the doctor brought her round."</p>

  <p>"Well?" She heard the hiss of his drawn-in breath. "What did she say?"</p>

  <p>"Some fairy-tale about being frightened and locking herself in."</p>

  <p>"Well, what's wrong with that?" asked Charlie in a jaunty voice.
  "Good-night, darling. I want to go to sleep."</p>

  <p>"Not until you've told me the truth. I <i>know</i> you found her snooping
  around and locked her in. The key was turned. But&mdash;do you realise that
  you went away <i>without telling any one where she was</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I did. I left a note."</p>

  <p>"About the damn birds."</p>

  <p>"I had to be careful. But I trusted <i>you</i> to read between the
  lines."</p>

  <p>"But how did you know I was coming back to the cottage that night?"</p>

  <p>"I banked on it. I knew you wouldn't trust me to turn off the gas."</p>

  <p>"So you took the risk?"</p>

  <p>"It was her or us. I had to risk <i>something</i>...Besides, she wasn't
  hurt. I was most gentle with her."</p>

  <p>His voice was too glib to satisfy Vera. Although her instinct warned her
  not to shirk a thorough explanation of her husband's motives, she shrank from
  asking any more questions. Pressing her face into the pillow, and drawing the
  clothes over her head to deaden the sound of regular breathing from the other
  bed, she realised something of the appalling agony of suffocation.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she grew afraid of the stranger who was Chester Beaverbrook.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-24"
     id="ch-24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; IN SEARCH OF REALISM</h2>

  <p class="first">VERA lost vital ground on that first night, when she shrank
  from forcing her husband out into the open. He was then still under the
  domination of her stronger nature, and could have been bullied into his
  former submission. As it was, he made the fatal discovery that he could slip
  from under her thumb, by evasive tactics.</p>

  <p>Like the frog that tried to jump out of the well, she advanced, but made
  no actual progress. When she awoke the next morning, she was her usual sane
  and cheery self, ready for enjoyment. She was ready, therefore, to fall in
  with the suggestion of a holiday.</p>

  <p>They took a small furnished flat in Shaftesbury Avenue and spent all their
  time in amusement. Charlie was clever enough not to alarm Vera by extravagant
  expenditure. They engaged a daily woman to do the work, took their meals at
  popular restaurants, and patronised cinemas instead of theatres.</p>

  <p>Neither was bored by the exclusive company of the other. Vera could spend
  a whole day in one of the big shops, pricing goods, having refreshment, and
  watching mannequin parades, while she was too good a sport to prevent Charlie
  from going to dance halls, because she was still lame.</p>

  <p>Some time had slipped away before she realised that they had not tackled
  the problem of the conservation of their capital. The country cottage was
  still her goal, but it remained as far away as ever. Whenever she mentioned
  the future to Charlie, he always sidetracked her.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, no argument or pressure could make him leave London,
  which sheltered the girl in the train. The resolution to meet her again had
  become a fixation.</p>

  <p>He plucked up courage to ring up the Ladies Club, which she had given as
  her address, but learned that she had only stayed there for a few nights, and
  the secretary knew nothing of her movements. Then he remembered that she had
  told the writer that she was devoted to dancing. So, every night, he went to
  a different night club or dance hall, in the hope of meeting her.</p>

  <p>Vera did not know that she had grown lonely, until she realised that she
  was always thinking of Puggie Williams. Like the chiffon veil which protects
  a fading film star from the camera's cruelty, so Time had blurred the memory
  of his red-veined face. She only remembered his distinction and his cheery
  companionship.</p>

  <p>One evening, as she was skimming the paper, she mentioned him to
  Charlie.</p>

  <p>"It says here, some earl's youngest son has just returned home, after a
  long absence abroad. Wonder if it's Puggie. I wish he'd show up here, when
  he's bored with his grand friends."</p>

  <p>"If he does, I'll throw him out," declared Charlie.</p>

  <p>"That's the spirit, sweetheart. A little newspaper publicity is all we
  need to prevent that sinking feeling...Are you jealous?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Vera was thrilled by the inscrutable smile which accompanied his
  admission.</p>

  <p>"The poor mug," he thought.</p>

  <p>It amused him to refer to the smoking hell in which he writhed, whenever
  he thought of other men in Jennifer's life. Whenever she danced, alien arms
  would hold her. At the worst, she might even be engaged to be married.</p>

  <p>At the thought of that non-existent stranger, Charlie felt unable to
  endure the flat any longer. With his customary kiss to Vera, he drifted out
  into the night. After an hour of aimless wandering, he remembered a vague
  invitation, over a bar, to a certain dance club.</p>

  <p>It was one of those snowball parties, where a friend brings another friend
  and the links get entangled, so that Charlie's original host&mdash;a
  respectable Scot, and a Writer to the Signet&mdash;had no knowledge of some
  of his uninvited guests.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, it is certain that he would never have introduced Chester
  Beaverbrook to Miss Jennifer Burns, whom he had known since she was a
  child.</p>

  <p>Chester could hardly credit his luck when he recognised the girl in the
  train. Every night, he had searched for her in vain; yet, directly he acted
  on the spur of the moment, he found her waiting for him.</p>

  <p>He noticed that she was subtly changed. She had been adorable in tweeds,
  but in black velvet and silver lamé, she was magnificent as a young goddess.
  She looked taller than ever, but although London had done much for her
  appearance, the credit for that belonged to high-heeled sandals and a long
  slit skirt.</p>

  <p>But in spite of her new poise and distinction, she remained, at heart, a
  raw country girl, who could still thrill to the Lights of London. The night
  club was a new experience, for her first months in a city had been quiet. She
  had met very few men, with the exception of an Alan Pole, who had rooms in
  the same house as herself.</p>

  <p>It was not surprising, therefore, that she was excited by Charlie's
  spectacular good looks and his perfect dancing.</p>

  <p>"I thought I could dance," she confessed frankly. "But I'm not in your
  class. I feel I want to go home and practise walking on stilts. It's all I'm
  fit for."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> make me dance like this," Charlie told her.</p>

  <p>She enchanted him with her ringing laughter.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she said, quoting from her notebook, "I'm not one of those
  passionate women, whose name begins with 'Z'. I'm not the type that
  inspires...Talking of names, I didn't catch yours."</p>

  <p>"Chester Beaverbrook."</p>

  <p>"What a beautiful name. It sounds exactly as though you'd invented
  it."</p>

  <p>"I did." Charlie smiled inscrutably. "I thought it might please
  <i>you.</i>"</p>

  <p>"I'm thrilled by it. My name is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jennifer Burns."</p>

  <p>She crinkled up her eyes in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"How did you know that? Mr. Burns always introduces me as 'Jane'"</p>

  <p>Another egg-shell in his path; but he was walking on air, so could not
  crash.</p>

  <p>"Instinct," he explained. "I knew you could not be a Plain Jane."</p>

  <p>Jennifer laughed again and changed the subject. In spite of her youth and
  inexperience, she was beginning to find his compliments too stressed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're a lawyer?" she asked. "Mr. Andrews told me I was going
  to meet his legal friends."</p>

  <p>"Count me out. I've merely been roped-in.'</p>

  <p>"I see. One of the many interesting people who 'are in Town to-night.'
  But&mdash;what is your work?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You've heard of a gentleman at large. I can't call myself a gentleman,
  because gentlemen don't call themselves names&mdash;but I'm at large."</p>

  <p>He had expected Jennifer to be impressed, so was disappointed when she
  wrinkled her short nose.</p>

  <p>"How dull. I adore work. I think shop is the most interesting subject of
  any."</p>

  <p>In spite of his statement, she tried to sum him up for her notebook of
  "types." His slim graceful figure, varnished black hair, and romantic
  clean-shaven profile combined to suggest a model for a gigolo. She knew she
  could look expensive on a small expenditure, owing to her impressive build,
  so she wondered if she were marked down as a future patroness.</p>

  <p>At the thought, she became too conscious of the pressure of his arm.</p>

  <p>"Let's sit somewhere," she said. "I want to watch. I've never been to a
  night club before."</p>

  <p>The remark raised her on a pedestal.</p>

  <p>"Like it?" he ventured.</p>

  <p>"No, I loathe it."</p>

  <p>She gazed with repulsion at the small room, with its gaudy futuristic
  decorations. The atmosphere was torrid as a jungle. Cracked faces swam past
  her; old people like rouged vultures, clasping devitalised partners like
  plucked chickens. To her Celtic imagination, she could see Youth actually
  drowning in the tired eyes of girls.</p>

  <p>"I came here to collect material for a book," she told Charlie. "You know,
  atmosphere and types. I must get <i>realism.</i>"</p>

  <p>"What sort of a book?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Crime. Of course, I shall concentrate on the psychological
  aspect&mdash;the <i>mind</i> of the criminal. But I've got to muck up
  poisons, and drugs, and criminal law."</p>

  <p>"Why law?"</p>

  <p>"For the trial, of course."</p>

  <p>Charlie began to smile between half-closed lids.</p>

  <p>"There's no 'of course'," he told her. "If he's clever, he will not be
  caught."</p>

  <p>"But he's bound to be, eventually," declared Jennifer. "All criminals are
  terribly vain, and under-rate other people's intelligence. Besides that, they
  have single-track minds. They find a thing works the first time, so they're
  led on to try to repeat a success. It stands to reason the police know
  exactly what to look for."</p>

  <p>Charlie gazed with admiration at this clear-eyed clever girl. With typical
  vanity, he wanted to boast to her about his own successful fraud. There were
  no repellent details, no blood or cruelty. Fortunately, however, prudence
  reminded him of a safer road to her attention.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you all about drugs and poisons," he told her. "I've walked a
  hospital."</p>

  <p>"Thanks."</p>

  <p>"And I can put you wise to any legal snag. I've read law, too. The fact
  is, I think no one should confine his time to a single profession. Otherwise,
  you acquire a single-track mind."</p>

  <p>As he was speaking the truth, it was rather hard on him when Jennifer
  began to regard him as an accomplished liar. To his dismay, she treated his
  confidence as a joke.</p>

  <p>"What else have you done? I'm sure you sang in the choir, and your voice
  always soared above the rest."</p>

  <p>"I did. And it did. Always."</p>

  <p>"You'd find community singing a bit of a strain. Were you the vicar's
  pet?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he said some very nice things about me&mdash;when he buried
  me."</p>

  <p>As he expected, Jennifer laughed. But she also suspected a certain type of
  humour.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;when he married you?"</p>

  <p>"No." His voice throbbed with conviction. "I'm still waiting for
  <i>the</i> girl."</p>

  <p>"And my party's waiting for <i>me.</i> Good-night."</p>

  <p>The blow fell so unexpectedly that Charles was stunned by shock. He had
  not realised that this re-union was not eternal. His ideal was going
  completely out of his life again; and she informed him of the fact casually,
  unconscious that she was dooming him to a separation worse than death.</p>

  <p>"Shall we meet again?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. This year, next year&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, seriously. Don't you want your medical and legal data?"</p>

  <p>He used the right term to arrest her attention; and while she hesitated,
  he pressed home his advantage.</p>

  <p>"What about a cocktail at the Ritz? I'll come prepared to answer all your
  questions."</p>

  <p>To his surprise, she smiled eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I'd love to. But I'm not in society, you know. I work in an office. A
  literary agent. But they don't encourage private calls, so I'll give you the
  number of my boarding-house."</p>

  <p>Jennifer drove home in a triumphant mood. She had never been to the Ritz,
  and it promised more copy. The evening had been successful, and as regarded
  her work, was rich with future possibilities.</p>

  <p>In her blindness&mdash;she actually blessed her luck.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-25"
     id="ch-25"></a>XXV. &mdash; THE SECOND WIFE</h2>

  <p class="first">CHARLIE BAXTER was a gentleman, and Chester Beaverbrook
  carried on the tradition. His intentions towards Jennifer were strictly
  honourable. He told himself that she possessed the qualities he admired
  most&mdash;breeding, brains, education, health, style, charm, class. So he
  decided to marry her.</p>

  <p>The little fact that he had one wife already presented no obstacle. All he
  needed was sufficient money for two separate establishments. He returned to
  the flat with his head so full of his second wife, that he had to wake up his
  first wife, to tell her the news.</p>

  <p>"Vera," he called. "Wake up. I want to talk to you. Have you realised our
  money won't last for ever."</p>

  <p>Vera shot up in bed&mdash;a grotesque little figure in vivid violet
  pyjamas, to match the purple bedroom. She had been too slack to remove her
  make-up properly, and she stared up at her husband through spiked black
  lashes.</p>

  <p>"So it's dawned on you at last?" she said. "But what made you wake up and
  dream?"</p>

  <p>He began to undress, pitching his clothes about the room in his
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"We've got to get more money," he said.</p>

  <p>"Where from?" yawned Vera.</p>

  <p>"The insurance, of course."</p>

  <p>"How? Are you going to die again?"</p>

  <p>"No. It's a sign of a single-track mind to repeat a success."</p>

  <p>Vera stared at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A college girl."</p>

  <p>Charlie could not resist the temptation of boasting, even to his wife. As
  he studied his profile in the mirror, he did not notice that she was watching
  him closely.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they don't teach insurance in college," she said. "Did your
  girl-friend suggest anything else?"</p>

  <p>"No. This time, I'm going to buy a slop-shop in the East End and have a
  fire."</p>

  <p>Vera gave a sharp cry of protest.</p>

  <p>"<i>No.</i> Charlie, don't you ever <i>think</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Think? I like that. When I've just handed you a first-class idea."</p>

  <p>"But, sweetheart." Vera looked at him with repulsion, while she spoke
  slowly and patiently, as though to an idiot child. "Don't you realise that,
  down in the slums, they pack them in with a shoehorn? There'll be families
  overhead, with lots of children. If you start a fire, they'll be trapped. How
  can you be so cruel?"</p>

  <p>"Cruel? I?" Charlie was genuinely hurt. "I don't want to burn babies. The
  idea. I only want to burn down my own shop."</p>

  <p>"I see. Another of your little risks. Well, you listen to me. If you start
  anything, I'll go straight to the insurance and warn them you're a
  firebug."</p>

  <p>He could tell that she was in earnest, so he went sullenly to bed.
  Presently he made another proposition.</p>

  <p>"Let's ask old Puggie Williams to stay with us."</p>

  <p>Vera, who was on the point of dozing, was jolted awake.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were jealous of him," she said.</p>

  <p>"I am. But I can use him."</p>

  <p>"Then ask him to come."</p>

  <p>"He won't for me. We had a difference. But he'll come for you."</p>

  <p>"Yet you're jealous...All right, honey, that's one more little score
  against you. Only one. But you've no idea how the ones are mounting up."</p>

  <p>From that night, Vera noticed the change in her husband. Now that he had
  found Jennifer he went out no more at night. But in spite of this apparent
  wish for her company, she wondered if he were conscious of her presence, as
  he lay on the divan, smiling at his own thoughts. Sometimes his lips moved,
  as though he were talking to some one.</p>

  <p>Baffled and perplexed, she wrote to Puggie Williams. A few days later, he
  arrived at the flat. His face was more inflamed than ever, but his appearance
  suggested the Royal Enclosure at Ascot. There was no doubt that he knew how
  to choose his tailor and how to wear his clothes.</p>

  <p>Vera gave him an off-hand greeting, although she wanted to hug him, while
  he was frankly moved.</p>

  <p>"Like old times," he said, looking around with watery eyes. "Here we are,
  three little pigs, and we're not afraid of the Bad Big Wolf any more. Bless
  you, Vera, old child. And so <i>this</i> is Chester Beaverbrook? Well, upon
  my Sam."</p>

  <p>Pleased by his admiration, Charlie produced the whisky.</p>

  <p>"Say when," he remarked affably.</p>

  <p>As Vera had expected, it was not long before Charlie introduced the
  subject of the new insurance fraud. To her disappointment, Puggie pricked up
  his ears and looked intelligent.</p>

  <p>"My palm itches," he said. "I can always do with chink. That thousand of
  mine doesn't look healthy. Too pecked about."</p>

  <p>"The risk," Vera reminded him.</p>

  <p>"It's the risk that appeals, my child. Can't stick tigers any longer. I
  haven't got the eyesight or the cash. But a second shot at the insurance
  would be the hell of a risk."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're mad&mdash;both of you," wailed Vera.</p>

  <p>"Not me. Of course, it would kill a sensitive chap like Charlie, but not
  me. I've been in quod. It's not too bad. Good company, you know. It's healthy
  for a soak like me. I come out, all made-over...Besides, it's good for my
  self-respect. Outside, I'm a blackguard. Inside, I'm top boy of my class. I
  always do what I'm told and hit it off with the warders...What do you
  suggest, Charlie?"</p>

  <p>"I thought of a fire," explained Charlie eagerly.</p>

  <p>To his disgust, Puggie shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Too late. It's been overdone."</p>

  <p>"Then, I suppose I shall have to die again."</p>

  <p>"You can't, old son. We've buried Charlie Baxter, and Chester Beaverbrook
  hasn't been born. We <i>must</i> produce a birth certificate."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;couldn't you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forge one?" asked Puggie. "Sorry, not in my line. Vera will have to be
  the corpse."</p>

  <p>"Die? Me? Now you listen to me, both of you."</p>

  <p>Vera began to talk, or rather, to rave. She clenched her fists and shook
  her hair in various vehement variations on her original theme. When at last
  she stopped through sheer exhaustion, Puggie winked at Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Lady says 'No'. Pity. I know a peach of a chap for the job. Dr. Ruddy.
  It's a crime not to use him while he's still on the register."</p>

  <p>"Could you depend on him?" asked Charlie.</p>

  <p>"You could depend on him <i>not</i> to come when you sent for him, or if
  he did come, you could depend on him to be plastered. Only say the word and
  I'll bring him round for a drink."</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>," declared Vera.</p>

  <p>She still retained her authority, so the matter was shelved. Puggie
  slipped easily into his old niche in the household. Apparently there was no
  change in the relationship of the three. Charlie was his usual pliant,
  pleasant self&mdash;alternately petted and bullied by Vera&mdash;while Puggie
  maintained the advantage of his neutral standing.</p>

  <p>All the same, he detected a difference, which led him to keep unobtrusive
  watch on his host's movements. For some, time he drew blank, until one
  evening he saw Charlie in the Ritz with a girl. He was swift to sum up types,
  although he saw only Jennifer's back, and he was assured that this was not
  the usual affair.</p>

  <p>Vera's day was over.</p>

  <p>His weak dissipated face was stiff with concern when he got back to the
  flat.</p>

  <p>"Vera, old child," he said, "I'm all steamed-up about you and
  Charlie."</p>

  <p>"I know," she said instantly. "He's got another girl."</p>

  <p>"Not 'another,' Vera."</p>

  <p>She coiled round on the black-and-gold divan and began to smoke fiercely.
  Suddenly he realised that she had become smaller, as though she were being
  shrivelled by some secret fear.</p>

  <p>"I'm sick of this racket," she said. "I want to get out. But Charlie won't
  come. He pulls me with him. Spending. Spending. What's the end of it?"</p>

  <p>Puggie realised that she was in the right mood to listen.</p>

  <p>"If you could clear out this minute, would you go?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Without Charlie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's come to that."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, with <i>me</i>?"</p>

  <p>"No. Sorry, Puggie, but I'm through with men. You can't depend on them.
  They called me the Merry Widow in Starminster. A fat lot they knew me."</p>

  <p>Puggie gulped manfully at the rebuff.</p>

  <p>"Then, listen to me, kid," he said. "Hang on to the insurance. It's in
  your name and it's yours. Clear out with it."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not a rat."</p>

  <p>"Then start the new deal and let Charlie cash in for the blooming lot.
  That'll square him. He only wants money. I'll bring Dr. Ruddy round
  to-morrow. You kick the bucket, like a good kid, and then cut...Honestly,
  you're not sitting pretty."</p>

  <p>As she bit her lip and hesitated, he urged her further.</p>

  <p>"I want to fix it that, whatever happens, you won't get the rap for the
  other business. They'll be kept separate, in watertight compartments. No
  connection between Mrs. Charles Baxter, Widow, and the late Mrs. Chester
  Beaverbrook...That's why I want you to make a clean getaway. You're too good
  for this muck."</p>

  <p>Vera's eyes grew wistful. The flat held the stale heat of summer. It smelt
  of dust and petrol from the street. Suddenly she saw a cottage garden,
  stewing in clean sunshine, and complete with apple-trees and bee-hives. She
  wore a lilac sun-bonnet and pumped water from a well.</p>

  <p>"It's Charlie," whispered Puggie. "I don't trust him."</p>

  <p>"Why not? He'd never hurt me. He's too tender about suffering. He'd squirm
  at blood or bruises."</p>

  <p>"True, oh Queen. But he can't imagine what he doesn't see."</p>

  <p>Vera remembered Miss Belson. Charlie had assured her that he anticipated
  her release. But he had cut it suspiciously fine.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she shuddered.</p>

  <p>"All right," she said. "I'll die."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-26"
     id="ch-26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; DARK STRANDS</h2>

  <p class="first">ALTHOUGH Charlie was excited by her surrender, Vera refused
  to discuss the new fraud.</p>

  <p>"I'll come across with my stuff when it's wanted," she promised.</p>

  <p>"That's now. Pronto," said Puggie. "I'll have to get you insured at once.
  Charlie must keep out of this. In the ordinary way, of course, he'd inherit
  as your husband; but he's not exactly married to you, is he?"</p>

  <p>"We can get re-married," suggested Charlie.</p>

  <p>"We can't risk complications," decided Puggie. "Remember this, Chester.
  Vera is your wife, or your lady-friend, according to the standard of the
  neighbours. But you've no connection with Charlie Baxter's widow."</p>

  <p>"But can't she make a will leaving it to me?"</p>

  <p>"No, you mug. Mrs. Charles Baxter prefers to stay alive and enjoy her
  insurance money. Besides, what's the idea of letting lawyers in on this? The
  fact is, you two had better give each other the air. I don't mind playing
  ball with Vera, while Charlie prowls round on his lonesome."</p>

  <p>As Vera was swift to notice, her husband raised no objection. She was so
  concerned by his lack of jealousy, that she did not remark that Puggie
  displayed none of his former caution. There was an ironic glint in his watery
  eyes, as though he proposed to play a lone game which amused him.</p>

  <p>"Now we're old hands at the game," said Charlie in a lordly tone, "I'm out
  for ten thousand this time."</p>

  <p>The figure caught Vera's wandering attention.</p>

  <p>"That means a bigger premium," she objected.</p>

  <p>Although Puggie knew that she wanted to conserve her capital, he did not
  support her.</p>

  <p>"You're younger than Charlie, so the premiums will be lower," he said.
  "And you'll probably pay one only...The real question is, will this little
  shrimp pass the insurance doctor?"</p>

  <p>He lost no time in bringing Dr. Ruddy round to the flat. He proved to be a
  good-natured shambling giant, with shaggy grey hair and moustache, and
  clouded blue eyes. In his youth, when he had shown brilliant promise, he
  wrote the following impromptu rhyme in a lady's album:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"The narrow paths that lead to fame,<br>
  Are difficult and risky,<br>
  While thirst for it is often quenched<br>
  By Scotch or Irish whisky."</p><br>

  <p>It proved to be his own epitaph. Yet, if he liked work too little, and
  whisky too well, he managed to retain a large practice, in a poorish
  neighbourhood, by charm of personality and definite skill at a pinch.</p>

  <p>His arrival on the scene was the signal for Fate&mdash;spinning
  overhead&mdash;to introduce the first dark threads into her loom.</p>

  <p>The following night Vera caught her finger in the mincing-machine, and Dr.
  Ruddy was sent for. Although he was not sober, he actually came, chiefly
  because he had a pleasant recollection of the whisky.</p>

  <p>He had been charmed by Vera in her capacity of hostess, for he was used to
  the brand of matron who hid the decanter; and he liked her still more as a
  patient, because of her pluck.</p>

  <p>It was Charlie who insisted on the use of chloroform when the hand was
  dressed. Dr. Ruddy, who was in a very mellow sentimental mood, was touched by
  the husband's sensibility, while even Puggie was impressed by it.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that Charlie suffered Vera's pain by proxy. The pallor
  of his lips proved that his compassion was genuine, and he winced every time
  Vera grimaced.</p>

  <p>"All the nerves are at the finger-tips," he told Dr. Ruddy.</p>

  <p>"I'm qualified," growled the doctor. "Are you?"</p>

  <p>Charlie helped with the bandages when Ruddy's fingers proved too unsteady,
  and was complimented on his deftness. Afterwards, Dr. Ruddy stayed on at the
  flat into the small hours, drinking and yarning.</p>

  <p>He went away in such a confused state that he never noticed that he had
  left his chloroform-bottle behind him. When he discovered its loss several
  days later, he was unable to trace it through a fog of houses.</p>

  <p>Charlie found it the next morning, and went to Vera for orders.</p>

  <p>"Shall I take it round to his surgery?"</p>

  <p>"Why should you?" she snapped. "You're not his errand-boy. If he wants it
  he can send for it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, poor chap. Shall I ring him up and tell him where it is?"</p>

  <p>"No. I don't want that old whisky-hound here again."</p>

  <p>"Not until you stage your big dying-scene," Puggie reminded her.</p>

  <p>He had noticed that Charlie was in excellent spirits, after moods of
  depression, and he guessed the cause. At last, he was going to meet Jennifer
  at the Ritz. Whenever he had rung up previously, she always pleaded a
  previous engagement.</p>

  <p>As he suspected, another man was responsible for her reluctance. Alan
  Pole, who boarded at the same house, was neither rich nor handsome, while
  apparently he possessed a double-track mind. That is to say, like many
  Englishmen, he was well-informed on most subjects, but could only talk of
  two, Rugby football and insurance.</p>

  <p>He took Jennifer to Wembley, to see a cup-final, and he never noticed that
  she got drenched in the rain and missed her tea, in the glory of the contest.
  As for the insurance part, he occupied a position, which was not impressive,
  in the office of a big company.</p>

  <p>Although he was so ordinary, he and Jennifer were drawn together. They had
  much in common, for, apart from her sophisticated style, the girl was a
  simple homely soul. In spite of her opposition, she was influenced by Alan's
  arguments when he tried to dissuade her from meeting Charlie.</p>

  <p>"It's positively dangerous," he said. "You admit now that your friend,
  Andrews, didn't know the chap from Adam. He's only a pick-up, and he'll
  probably pick your pocket, if nothing worse. What do you know about him?"</p>

  <p>"I know he's very handsome and dances like a dream," replied Jennifer.</p>

  <p>"That's one for me. But I didn't pick my face. I don't like it any more
  than you do...Fallen for him?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. Besides, I'm only meeting him for half an hour at the
  Ritz. I'm not bringing him back to my bedroom."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you must go, do be careful. Don't tell him anything about
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Because she saw that he was really worried, Jennifer promised to exercise
  extreme discretion. And neither of them knew that Alan had given her some
  fatal advice.</p>

  <p>Probably because she was on guard, Jennifer was not so impressed by
  Charlie at their second meeting. The daylight revealed a meretricious quality
  about his good looks. She was reminded vaguely of an actor who had not
  removed his make-up. Although still strikingly handsome, he looked the type
  of man whom London mothers warn their children to avoid, when they want to
  know the time.</p>

  <p>But he stared at her so long and thirstily that she grew uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Do I look so awful?" she asked. "I had to come straight from the
  office."</p>

  <p>"What office?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A literary agent."</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>She was about to tell him, when she remembered Alan's warning. So,
  although subterfuge was foreign to her, she substituted another well-known
  name.</p>

  <p>And Fate wove a second dark strand into her fabric.</p>

  <p>The cocktail re-union was not a success, for Jennifer was disillusioned,
  while Charlie was nervous. His vanity told him that he was not impressing her
  as a cultured man-of-the-world, while she constantly baffled him with her
  specialised questions.</p>

  <p>So he began to boast. Although she drew him on with all the correct
  comments, he had the uneasy impression that, in reality, she considered him a
  wholesale liar. Whenever this suspicion flashed across his mind, he
  floundered so badly that Jennifer had to come to his rescue, and haul him out
  of the conversational morass.</p>

  <p>On one occasion, she was teased by a vague memory, like the whir of a
  mosquito's wing.</p>

  <p>"I wonder&mdash;" She broke off to frown. "Have I met you before?"</p>

  <p>"I've never met <i>you.</i>"</p>

  <p>Although she could not understand why he seemed so alarmed, she was
  interested to observe that his eyes had altered. Instead of being soft and
  swimmy, they suddenly hardened to the startled glare of a cornered beast of
  prey.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you've seen some one like me on the screen," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Lots," she assured him, speaking rather too quickly.</p>

  <p>Luckily, he was flattered by her reply.</p>

  <p>"When will you meet me again?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I'm so busy," she told him.</p>

  <p>"But you must. You make me feel I've failed you. It's so long since I was
  in collar, but I'll brush up by next time. Won't you give me a second chance?
  I don't want to boast, but I've probably forgotten more than the men you know
  have ever learned."</p>

  <p>"You've been most helpful," Jennifer assured him. "If I've seemed dull,
  it's because I've been taking mental notes. The Ritz will be in my
  novel."</p>

  <p>"Will I?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You'll be the prisoner in the dock."</p>

  <p>Jennifer allowed him to take her home, as a compensation for his
  disappointment when she refused to make a definite engagement. She insisted
  on travelling by tube, since she distrusted the opportunities of a taxi. It
  was Charlie's chance to reverse her opinion of him, when he alone, of all the
  seated males, offered his place to an elderly woman. She could see that his
  action was spontaneous, so to reward him further for his kindness she invited
  him inside, when they reached the boarding-house.</p>

  <p>The ladies in the lounge were impressed by her handsome escort, but Alan
  Pole glowered at him and then pointedly turned his back, to avoid an
  introduction.</p>

  <p>When Charlie had gone, he lost no time in tackling Jennifer.</p>

  <p>"Not my affair, of course, but I wish you wouldn't go about with that
  wop."</p>

  <p>"I knew you'd say that," crowed Jennifer. "You've got the correct
  masculine complex. A man can't be handsome and moral all at once."</p>

  <p>"All the same, I know that chap's not on the level. You can't fool men
  about men."</p>

  <p>Jennifer gave her rich chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I tell you all about him," she said. "To begin with, I need not
  be frightened of him, for he's far more afraid of me. He's a terrible coward.
  If ever he got into a jam, he'd collapse like puff-pastry when you jab your
  thumb into it."</p>

  <p>"Go on," encouraged Alan.</p>

  <p>"He's the sort that shoots to kill, if he's surprised robbing a kid's
  money-box."</p>

  <p>"Good. Now, since you've got him all taped, why don't you break with
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;it seems awfully cold-blooded&mdash;I'm studying him as a
  type for my crime-novel. I want <i>realism.</i> He interests me. He's such a
  wholesale liar. He's so quiet and inoffensive, but he's got no brains or
  imagination where other people are concerned. If he found himself in a tight
  corner, I believe he could commit the most appalling cruelty."</p>

  <p>Alan continued to grumble, for although his jealousy was appeased, he was
  conscious of the birth-pangs of ambition. His contentment with his safe and
  easy job died, when he realised that Jennifer was pursued by a man who could
  entertain her in conventional expensive manner. A second venture might prove
  luckier for the man.</p>

  <p>A few days later, however, he was promoted to having his own private
  secretary, although it was only for a few minutes. This honour was the result
  of Jennifer's freak, conceived in the lightness of her heart, but destined to
  bear bitter fruit.</p>

  <p>Her services were not yet specially useful to the literary agency where
  she worked. Consequently, as she liked exercise, and considered no trifling
  job a loss of dignity, she occasionally got the job of delivering an urgent
  manuscript. On such an occasion, she found herself in the same street where
  Alan's offices were situated.</p>

  <p>Acting on the spur of the moment, she paid him a surprise visit. He was
  delighted to see her, although he had to break the news that she had chosen
  an inopportune time.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;you want me to fade out again?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Definitely not. But we small-fry are not encouraged to entertain ladies.
  You see, it might look slack. I'm expecting a client any minute."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, they heard the tramp of heavy footsteps down the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>Jennifer's eyes sparkled as she realised the possibilities of the
  situation. Whipping off her hat, she seated herself at the typewriter and
  inserted a sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>"We'll impress him," she said, as she began to type rapidly. "He'll think
  you're a big noise with your own secretary."</p>

  <p>He could only grin, as the door opened to admit an important looking
  client. Instantly Jennifer stopped rattling her machine, and rose.</p>

  <p>"Shall I finish it later, sir?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Please, Miss Burns."</p>

  <p>Alan winked at Jennifer as she went from the room, but her expression was
  grave, because the client was looking at her approvingly, with an experienced
  eye.</p>

  <p>Several times during the afternoon, Alan stopped in his work to chuckle
  over the incident, while Jennifer also smiled, unaware that she had supplied
  Fate with another strand for her dark design.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-27"
     id="ch-27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; THE LADY IN THE CASE</h2>

  <p class="first">DURING the summer, Charlie made little progress with his
  courtship of his second wife. She remained an elusive person, with a passion
  for a previous engagement. Any one less persistent than Charles would have
  been discouraged, especially as he received a definite check when he rang up
  the literary agent who employed her.</p>

  <p>When he asked to speak to Miss Burns he was told that she was not a member
  of their staff.</p>

  <p>"Does that mean she is engaged?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"It means what I say," replied a crisp feminine voice. "I'm sorry, but
  you've been misinformed."</p>

  <p>Charlie rang off in a sceptical mood. The next day he made another attempt
  to get in touch with Jennifer, in the hope that a more truthful person would
  answer the telephone.</p>

  <p>Unluckily, he recognised the same voice, only this time, the lady was in
  an acid mood.</p>

  <p>"There's still no Miss Burns here," she told him. "And there'll be no Miss
  Burns to-morrow, or at any future date. Will you please accept that as
  final?"</p>

  <p>Charlie complained to Jennifer of his experience a few days later, when he
  called at her boarding-house and surprised her in a mood for dancing.</p>

  <p>"Some jealous girl, I suppose," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Jennifer looked confused as she shook her head. "Of course not. But the
  girl at the switch-board has instructions not to put through any private
  calls. It's not business-like. <i>Never</i> ring me up again or I'll be
  furious."</p>

  <p>In reality, she was furious with Alan for having landed her into the
  deception, for she was transparently truthful by nature. At that time, she
  had plenty of opportunities for abusing him, as she was meeting him nearly
  every evening, to swim or play tennis.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Charlie got very little of her company. Although she
  loved dancing, the weather was too tropical for crowded dance halls. But the
  infrequency of their meetings only fed his infatuation. He was enchanted by
  her interest in his character and experiences, although he was sometimes
  drawn on beyond the limit of prudence.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for his self-conceit, he did not know that he was providing
  Jennifer with literary copy. In spite of the heat, she had begun her first
  novel, and was taking it very seriously. When Alan continued to growl about
  their friendship she only laughed.</p>

  <p>"A dance with him is as good as a lesson from a 'pro,'" she declared. "I'd
  better have them while the going's good. I'm not his sort, and he'll soon be
  tired of me."</p>

  <p>She was misled by her modesty, for she had got into his blood, so that he
  concentrated conclusively on his second marriage. Vera used to watch him as
  he sat silent and moody, biting his varnished nails.</p>

  <p>She reminded herself that she had always played the game by him. Had she
  chosen, she could have skipped off with the insurance money, leaving him
  stranded and penniless in London.</p>

  <p>"Will he treat me on the level, too?" she wondered. "Or will he fade away
  with the college girl?"</p>

  <p>But she held a trump card, since the insurance had been paid to Mrs.
  Charles Baxter. Her account at the bank was in this name, so that, even if
  her husband cheated her over the new fraud, she would still be
  independent.</p>

  <p>Although, as a respectable widow, she need have no connection with a
  dubious dead and buried Mrs. Chester Beaverbrook, she shrank from the
  prospect of another round with the insurance. As the drought persisted
  through a hot autumn, she began to lose her appetite and her sleep through
  worry.</p>

  <p>She had no interest in life, for she was temporarily out of the caste in
  the great drama. She told herself bitterly that she was just one of the
  crowd, as she mingled with hundreds of other women, in Oxford Street and
  Kensington High Street. She hadn't even one line, as she did the shop-crawl,
  or went to the pictures.</p>

  <p>Presently the fears of the medical authorities were realised in an
  epidemic of bad throats, due to the dust of the drought. It heralded a wave
  of sickness&mdash;diphtheria, and a form of enteric influenza, which was a
  mild form of plague, and proved fatal in many cases.</p>

  <p>Every hospital and nursing home was filled, while the supply of doctors
  and nurses was insufficient to cope with the demand. The obituary columns
  made Puggie Williams' small eyes glitter.</p>

  <p>"It's the chance of a life-time," he declared at breakfast, one steamy
  morning. "Even a chap so behind the times as old Shakespeare knew all about
  the flood that leads to fortune. Vera, my infant, you'll have to be the next
  victim."</p>

  <p>"Go away," said Vera. "Come back in two years' time. Then, perhaps, I'll
  discuss it."</p>

  <p>"You won't have much chink left by then."</p>

  <p>Vera did not like the reminder, but she continued to argue.</p>

  <p>"You must be delirious to suggest it. Old Acorn gave me an elementary
  lesson on a suspicious case, and this fills the bill. I won't risk it."</p>

  <p>Puggie nodded towards Charlie, who was lying on the divan, smoking with
  his usual apathy.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you taking a bigger risk with <i>him</i>?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Charlie? D'you imagine you can tell a woman anything about her own
  husband?"</p>

  <p>"My poor sap. I thought you were too clever to pull that old one, just
  because you know which side of the bed he lies on. It takes a man to tot up a
  man. Now, I'm an elementary type. You can spell me in three letters&mdash;s o
  t. But you don't know the first thing about me. You don't even know my
  name."</p>

  <p>"What are you buzzing about?" asked Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Just saying you're growing piebald about the hair," Puggie told him.
  "You're due for another visit to the beauty parlour."</p>

  <p>That remark brought home to Vera the complete change in the situation.
  Puggie was jealous of Charlie, while he, now, was indifferent to their
  friendship. They had travelled a long way from Starminster. With a pang of
  regret, she thought of the old Charlie Baxter&mdash;that nice cheerful little
  man, whose bearded dignity won the hearts of women.</p>

  <p>As though he guessed her thoughts, Puggie heaved a sigh.</p>

  <p>"Remember the rag we had over last time? Them were the days. You'll have
  to knock up another dummy, Vera."</p>

  <p>"I <i>won't</i>," she declared. "Count me out definitely."</p>

  <p>There followed a period of deadlock, when Vera refused to discuss the
  fraud, and Puggie went on the prowl. One morning, he showed her a railway
  cloak-room ticket, which had come by post.</p>

  <p>"There's a suspicious packing-case waiting for me there," he told her.
  "It's at Charing Cross. Hope they won't pinch me when I go to collect."</p>

  <p>"What's in it?" asked Vera.</p>

  <p>"A body. It's your fault. You've driven me to crime. Well, I must go and
  arrange for delivery of the poor girl."</p>

  <p>Vera thought he was trying to be funny at her expense and ignored him. She
  was out when Carter Paterson's van arrived, so missed the removal of a heavy
  package into the luggage lift.</p>

  <p>When she got home, Puggie met her on the landing.</p>

  <p>"She's in there," he whispered, pointing to his bedroom.</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked Vera.</p>

  <p>"The lady in the case."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you fool, you make me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Vera broke off and clutched his arm. Lying on the spare bed was the still
  figure of a woman, with fair hair and a pallid face.</p>

  <p>"Is she dead?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>Puggie burst into a shout of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Pulled your leg that time," he gloated. "It's Evangeline. I bought her
  from a draper at Peckham. I saw her in his window and noticed she looked
  about due for the melting-pot. I told the chap my wife was going abroad, and
  wanted to leave a model behind, to have her clothes fitted on. He swallowed
  the yarn. All the same, I didn't risk having her sent here direct."</p>

  <p>"You idiot," stormed Vera. "You're just wasting your money."</p>

  <p>"Not me. Charlie paid for her. Haven't you tumbled to it? She's an
  investment. Allow me to introduce her. Our Dummy."</p>

  <p>Vera got little sleep that night. She had not only received a shock, but
  she was worried by the persistence of the men.</p>

  <p>In spite of her common sense, the thing in the spare bed got gradually
  upon her nerves. It was so suggestive of a corpse, that she could not bear to
  go into the room. Presently she decided that she had better run down to the
  coast for a week-end.</p>

  <p>Wearing a sporting new camel-hair coat, she arrived in Brighton on Friday
  night, and engaged a room at a big hotel on the front. The visit, however,
  was not a success. She looked the type that expected company, and thoughtful
  gentlemen were eager to supply it. But she was not in a mood to encourage
  strangers and not in a state to be alone.</p>

  <p>After killing the time in solitary mooning she was glad when Sunday night
  came. To celebrate the end of her holiday, she took a late supper of lobster
  and champagne.</p>

  <p>That meal was fraught with supreme importance to her rival, Jennifer
  Burns. But it did its very worst to her, for it gave her a terrible
  dream.</p>

  <p>She lay on the borderline between sleep and waking, groaning and sweating
  with horror. Deep down. Darkness that weighed upon her. She tossed and kicked
  and fought with the bedclothes, trying to rend the sheet with her nails. Yet,
  even while she suffered an agony of suffocation and an appalling anguish of
  mind, she could hear the window rattling in the wind and the drag of the
  receding tide.</p>

  <p>At last, with a great effort, she struggled out of the nightmare and sat
  up in bed. Her face was streaming and her heart was thumping like a drum.</p>

  <p>"It's an omen," she whimpered. "It'll happen to me. I must warn Charlie.
  <i>Now.</i> There's no time to lose."</p>

  <p>Still in a dazed condition, she dragged on a wrapper, and seated herself
  before the table, which was furnished with hotel stationery. But as she
  stared at the paper, trying to collect her thoughts, she shuddered and shook
  her head.</p>

  <p>"Not <i>him.</i>"</p>

  <p>She steadied her hand to scrawl a note to another person. After she had
  addressed the envelope and sealed it, she felt considerably relieved. As she
  was still shaky, however, she unpacked the brandy, without which she never
  travelled, and drank the whole of it.</p>

  <p>She was unused to stimulant, so it sent her to sleep almost immediately.
  She awoke late on Monday morning with a splitting headache and no
  recollection of the letter episode.</p>

  <p>But the memory of an evil dream seemed to infect the room still, and made
  her feel anxious to leave it without delay. She pulled faces at the
  chambermaid who called for breakfast-orders, and packed hurriedly, while she
  gulped down a cup of tea. Not long afterwards she caught the fast train up to
  London.</p>

  <p>After she had gone, the floor-housekeeper made her round of inspection.
  Vera's room had been cleaned and prepared for the next visitor, but she
  noticed a letter on the mantelpiece. As the maid told her that she had found
  it stuck in a drawer of the writing-table, she took it down to the bureau to
  be stamped and posted.</p>

  <p>In due time it was received by the person to whom it was addressed, but it
  arrived at a time when he was occupied by a matter of more importance. So,
  when he skimmed it, it only made a slight impression. He murmured, "Poor
  soul," stuck it away in a drawer, and forgot it.</p>

  <p>Vera arrived in London before her letter. She found the flat in a state of
  disorder, but the men were too jubilant to be aware of discomfort.</p>

  <p>"Darling, you're the one woman in the world for us," declared Charlie, as
  he kissed her affectionately.</p>

  <p>"You look fine," said Puggie, whose exhilaration had no connection with
  spirits.</p>

  <p>"Clever of me," snapped Vera. "I'm feeling like a cheap remnant. I have
  had a horrible dream&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, East is East and West is West," broke in Puggie, "but they meet in
  the bargain basement. I've been shopping in these low-down places while
  you've been enjoying yourself...Everything's fixed."</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"For you to croak. Charlie's going to ring up Bloody, to-night, and tell
  him you're ill. He's run off his pins, so he'll be probably blind when he
  comes."</p>

  <p>"No," protested Vera. "I've already told you I won't be rushed. I've not
  made up my mind."</p>

  <p>"But you <i>will</i>, darling," he said, kissing her neck, "when you see
  what's waiting for you."</p>

  <p>Taking her arm, he walked with her to the spare room, and pointed to an
  object which lay on the floor.</p>

  <p>As Vera stared at it, the horror of her dream flooded her mind, so that
  she screamed.</p>

  <p>It was a coffin.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-28"
     id="ch-28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; INTO THE BLUE</h2>

  <p class="first">IT took some time to weaken Vera's opposition, but at last
  she gave in. Dr. Ruddy was going to bed when the telephone-bell rang. After
  he had rung off, he cursed heartily, for he was both nervy and
  overworked.</p>

  <p>"Why do people always get worse at night?" complained his wife.</p>

  <p>"They don't," he growled. "They only think they do."</p>

  <p>"Then let them get some one else. You're no good to your other patients,
  if you crack."</p>

  <p>The doctor, however, began to pull on his trousers.</p>

  <p>"It's Mrs. Beaverbrook," he explained.</p>

  <p>His wife, who kept his erratic books, understood the attraction. Her
  husband had not finished his round until after closing time, while she made
  it her life-job to see that there was never any whisky in the decanter.</p>

  <p>"Are they married?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Doubt it. But it doesn't concern me."</p>

  <p>When Dr. Ruddy reached the flat, Puggie was waiting for him in the
  sitting-room with the tantalus. He related Vera's symptoms, and paid tribute
  to Charlie's devotion, while the doctor was being refreshed.</p>

  <p>"It's flu, right enough," murmured Dr. Ruddy, as he listened with half an
  ear only to the too familiar story. "I'll see the little lady now."</p>

  <p>When he entered the sick-room, Vera looked a pitiful little object. She
  sat propped up in bed by two enormous violet satin cushions, dark from
  face-cream, and was covered with a purple silk eiderdown. In contrast with
  the crude colour, her skin had assumed a greenish tinge, while her pointed
  face seemed sharp as a fish-bone.</p>

  <p>"Is it you, doctor?" she cried. "I can't see you. I've got such frantic
  shooting pains behind my eyes."</p>

  <p>The perfunctory examination passed according to schedule. Dr. Ruddy was a
  very tired man, and not a sober one; he was in no shape, therefore, to detect
  trickery. Vera's temperature proved as high as the steaming
  potato&mdash;cached under her pillow&mdash;could send it soaring. She
  complained of all the regulation pains and aches, and her skin was dry from
  applications of spirit of alcohol.</p>

  <p>"Flu," said Dr. Ruddy.</p>

  <p>Just as he was going from the room, an unexpected element was introduced.
  Suddenly he turned and walked unsteadily across to the bed.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't there&mdash;something&mdash;you wanted me to do, my dear?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Vera stared in surprise.</p>

  <p>"What?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Slipped my memory." He looked vague. "But I'll remember. Don't worry,
  lil' woman. 'S all right."</p>

  <p>When he was outside the room, he pulled himself together to speak to
  Charlie.</p>

  <p>"She's got a very sharp attack, Beaverbrook. Get the best nurse you can
  find."</p>

  <p>"She won't let any one touch her but me," explained Charlie. "She only
  gets excited and then she's exhausted."</p>

  <p>"That's no good. Carry on, then. Only&mdash;I warn you, Beaverbrook, she's
  got no stamina."</p>

  <p>While they whispered outside the door, Puggie was leaning over the bed to
  murmur to Vera.</p>

  <p>"We've played him for a sucker all right," she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded Puggie. "But what are you going to do afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"Same as Charlie. Hide somewhere until he's collected and it's safe for
  him to join me."</p>

  <p>"If you're wise, you'll vanish altogether. Never come back or let him know
  where you are. Don't even let me know. I might babble when I'm tight."</p>

  <p>To Vera's surprise, Puggie's blurred face had grown sharp from strain.</p>

  <p>"Honestly, Vera," he whispered, "I don't trust Charlie. He wants
  money&mdash;and you've got it."</p>

  <p>His appeal was wasted on Vera.</p>

  <p>"He's my man, and I'm not going to give him up to any college girl," she
  said stubbornly.</p>

  <p>The course of her simulated illness, however, gradually wore down her
  resistance. She stood savage treatment, like a stoic, whenever it was
  necessary to fake a symptom; but she could not endure the hours of lying
  still&mdash;thinking&mdash;waiting.</p>

  <p>She had to stay in bed, because Dr. Ruddy was no more to be depended on to
  come, than a watch with a broken main-spring, to go. Whenever he promised to
  call, he failed to put in an appearance, and then turned up when he was least
  expected.</p>

  <p>Every device known to malingerers was used to confound him. But he was not
  suspicious, because only too many of his patients were running exactly the
  same symptoms. People were dying like flies, and the death duties reaping a
  rich harvest.</p>

  <p>Presently, Charlie judged the time was ripe to stage the inevitable
  collapse.</p>

  <p>For a wonder, Dr. Ruddy was sober when he obeyed the telephone summons. He
  found Vera in a state of genuine prostration, with a sub-normal temperature
  and a weak fluttering pulse, after a stiff dose of tobacco-ash mixed with
  tea.</p>

  <p>As he looked down on the shrunken figure, a memory stirred in his brain.
  At last, he knew why he had tried to reassure Vera. He could not refer to it,
  however, at this juncture, lest it should arouse her fears. So he patted her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," he said. "I'm going to look after&mdash;<i>everything.</i>
  And I'm going to pull you round."</p>

  <p>His kindly inflamed face was grave when he spoke to Charlie on the
  landing.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I'm not satisfied, Beaverbrook."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dr. Ruddy patted Charlie on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It all hangs on the next few hours. You know what to do, if she fails
  suddenly. If you sent for me, I'm afraid I should not be in time."</p>

  <p>Charlie was smiling when he returned to the bedroom.</p>

  <p>"What did the old whisky-hound say?" asked Vera.</p>

  <p>"Fine news. He says the angels are calling you." Charlie turned to Puggie.
  "Push on the arrangements for the funeral. The sooner we plant the corpse the
  safer we shall be."</p>

  <p>"I'll sing on the dotted line to that," remarked Vera bitterly. "I feel
  like a wet week-end after drinking that filthy dose."</p>

  <p>"You needn't take any more, darling," said her husband kindly. "I'm making
  an artistic job of this. To-morrow, you're going to have a wee dose of
  quadronex."</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"A drug. Quite harmless in small quantities. I'm only going to give you
  enough to produce slight coma."</p>

  <p>"<i>Coma?</i> I'll be unconscious?"</p>

  <p>"That's the idea. I'll call in Ruddy to see you. Then I'll be able to ring
  him up and tell him my poor wife passed away in her sleep, like a little
  child."</p>

  <p>Vera mimicked his laughter in an unnatural key.</p>

  <p>"Very funny, sweetheart," she said. "But I'm not so struck with this idea
  of white violets for one. I'm superstitious. When I was at Brighton I had a
  filthy dream&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Another time, darling. I've got to go out now."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" asked Vera, with sudden suspicion, as Charlie
  leaned over her to kiss her.</p>

  <p>"To the Charing Cross Road, to buy a secondhand book."</p>

  <p>She did not believe him, although he had told her the truth. When the men
  had left her, she lay staring around the room which she had grown to loathe.
  It reminded her of hours of heat, boredom, and nausea. Its atmosphere seemed
  clogged with stale drugs.</p>

  <p>Now a new element had crept in. She was afraid of a blindness and a
  darkness. It was useless to deceive herself any longer. Charlie had taken his
  new fancy seriously and there was no place in his life for her. At the best
  he might leave her&mdash;an unburied corpse in the wilds of Birmingham or
  Manchester, or whatever place was arranged. At the worst&mdash;</p>

  <p>She broke off to shudder. Although she could resist drinking the
  quadronex, Charlie might trick her into taking it. He might mix it with some
  disguising liquid, or inject it while she slept. Her very ignorance of the
  drug robbed it of all limit to its possibilities.</p>

  <p>She could not be eternally on guard against every mouthful she swallowed.
  And it was impossible to depend on a sot like Puggie. At the critical moment,
  his devotion might be wrecked by the glass of whisky too many. At present,
  she had her wits to defend her against her husband. Drugged&mdash;she would
  be completely in his power.</p>

  <p>She could not trust him. She remembered the peculiar twisted quality of
  his mind, when he proposed to light a bonfire under tenement dwellings.</p>

  <p>As she lay rigid in the purple bed, she saw the cottage in the country.
  The whole of England was waiting to swallow her up and hide her away from a
  blackmailing husband. Besides, the late lamented Charles Baxter had made her
  his widow, with a nice lump of Insurance, to console her for his loss.</p>

  <p>The best return she could make him was to respect his memory, and to
  remain his faithful widow.</p>

  <p>Her mind made up, she planned for a quick departure and a complete break.
  Then she slipped from bed and went to the door.</p>

  <p>"Puggie," she called.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-29"
     id="ch-29"></a>XXIX. &mdash; A BACHELOR FLAT</h2>

  <p class="first">CHARLIE came back to the flat only a few minutes after
  Vera's taxi had disappeared down Shaftesbury Avenue. He was in high spirits
  for he had bought an elementary book on Toxins, as a present for
  Jennifer.</p>

  <p>After a torturing period of coolness, when she had refused all his
  invitations and made excuses to avoid him, she had rung up, inviting him to
  call at the boarding-house, in two nights' time.</p>

  <p>"No," she said in answer to his suggestions, "we won't go anywhere. Bring
  the book, and we'll sit in the lounge and talk."</p>

  <p>Charlie believed he recognised her motives.</p>

  <p>"She's finished stalling and she's coming on," he predicted.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for his peace of mind, he was unaware of the reason for her
  friendship. While he had been clearing the ground for a speedy wedding with
  Jennifer, she had just entered into what threatened to be a long engagement
  with Alan Pole.</p>

  <p>After Jennifer had given him a strong preliminary hint, the young man had
  proposed and been accepted. Since then the lovers had lived in their special
  heaven. The only cloud to their happiness was the economic position.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could see a chance of promotion," said Alan. "But it won't walk
  to me. I'll have to go after it."</p>

  <p>"I'd love to help you," cried Jennifer, who wanted to share the picture.
  "Wouldn't it be marvellous if I could get on the track of a big fraud on the
  Insurance?"</p>

  <p>"It would be miraculous, my beloved sap."</p>

  <p>"But stranger things are happening all the time. I'll ask Chester
  Beaverbrook to take me to some low night club, and then I'll keep my eyes
  open and listen-in."</p>

  <p>"Glad you mentioned Beaverbrook. That reminds me of something. You've got
  to break with that wop."</p>

  <p>Alan spoke with grim determination, but Jennifer argued the point on a
  sentimental basis.</p>

  <p>"I'm so <i>sorry</i> for him. He's desperately pathetic, really. He
  doesn't know any other decent girl, so he over-values our friendship."</p>

  <p>"Well, you can be sorry for me for a change. I get blood-pressure every
  time you meet that chap."</p>

  <p>"All right, cry-baby, I'll break with him."</p>

  <p>"Good. Ring him up now and tell him you're engaged to me."</p>

  <p>In the pause that followed, Fate must have waited, her fingers
  flexed&mdash;ready to pull out the dark strands in her work. But once more
  Jennifer was betrayed by her fatal kindliness.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can't drop him flat like that. It's like chucking a bus ticket on
  the floor. Besides, he's promised to bring me a book I specially want for my
  novel. I'll ask him to bring it round the night after to-morrow. And then
  I'll introduce him to my future husband."</p>

  <p>Alan could see no objection to the plan, although he made Jennifer promise
  to pay for the book.</p>

  <p>"All right, laddie," she said, "I'll collect off you. I'm a Scot."</p>

  <p>Considering that her friendship with Beaverbrook was to help her in her
  study of human nature, it was extraordinary how little she had profited by
  it. Vera, who had the intimate knowledge of a wife, feared to trust him; yet
  Jennifer, who was a stranger, persisted in stroking the head of a
  rattlesnake.</p>

  <p>When Charlie arrived at the flat, the book under his arm, Puggie greeted
  him with a broad smile on his red-moon face.</p>

  <p>"Funeral's off. The corpse has hooked it."</p>

  <p>"W&mdash;what?" stammered Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Vera's gone&mdash;and good luck to her."</p>

  <p>At first, Charlie was too overwhelmed by Vera's treachery to credit
  it.</p>

  <p>"And that's <i>my wife</i>," he said bitterly. "Couldn't you stop
  her?"</p>

  <p>"I helped her, you mug. She took all her luggage."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"An hour ago," lied Puggie.</p>

  <p>It was obvious, from Charlie's relieved expression, that he was beginning
  to force his indignation. As a matter of fact, he was conscious of a new
  freedom. Vera was not only a complication, but a problem which&mdash;sooner
  or later&mdash;he had to solve.</p>

  <p>But with her voluntary departure, the last obstacle to his marriage was
  removed.</p>

  <p>"We must get the Certificate from Ruddy at once," he said.</p>

  <p>Puggie broke into loud hoots of laughter.</p>

  <p>"You fool," he panted, "the funeral's off. The Insurance's off.
  Everything's off...D'you think a big insurance company is the prey of every
  cheap piker? You haven't an earthly to collect off them."</p>

  <p>"But we did last time," said Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Last time, fathead, we played the good old confidence trick. We had
  beginner's luck, but we did it very nicely. We took two years to prepare the
  ground. And you were our best asset then. But now&mdash;you look as if you'd
  just pinched the fowl...Of course, you can have your little funeral, if it
  makes you happy&mdash;and you can plaster the office with certificates; but
  before the company coughs up ten thousand, they'll want to know a few things
  about you and me, and our financial standing."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;why did <i>you</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was just stringing Vera along. I knew she'd never rat, unless she knew
  you were provided for...I owed it to her because I forced her into the other
  affair, dead against the grain. She's honest&mdash;Vera is."</p>

  <p>Charlie licked his dry lips desperately.</p>

  <p>"The deal's <i>got</i> to go through," he said. "I want the money. I'm
  going to get married."</p>

  <p>"All right." Puggie laughed again. "Once in a lifetime, a big chance comes
  off. It will be amusing. But I warn you, you will probably find yourself in
  quod."</p>

  <p>"I'll risk it."</p>

  <p>Puggie filled his glass again.</p>

  <p>"Here's health," he said, raising it. "D'you remember what you said to me
  once? 'I don't like you, Williams.' Well, <i>I'm</i> saying it now. I liked
  Charlie Baxter, but I don't like Chester Beaverbrook. I hope you get
  pinched."</p>

  <p>"You're drunk."</p>

  <p>"Sober enough to warn you. Remember, <i>Charlie Baxter is dead.</i> You've
  never heard of him. If the prosecution got wind of another fraud, you'd get
  your sentence doubled."</p>

  <p>Charlie made no comment, but Puggie knew from his expression that his
  advice was not wasted. He could trust Chester Beaverbrook to look after his
  interests.</p>

  <p>"I'll do more for you than that," he said. "I'll help you to bury poor
  Evangeline and ring up Bloody about the death...But I'm not going to take a
  chance on collecting. I'll be generous and sell you the policy. No money need
  pass. I'm definitely out of this. But you've only to prove title, and there's
  ten thousand just waiting for you to pick up. Silly, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Puggie kept his word. He chose the psychological moment to tell Dr. Ruddy
  of Vera's collapse, for he put the call through to a public-house, when he
  knew the doctor was snatching a few minutes of relaxation.</p>

  <p>As he expected, Dr. Ruddy huskily assured him of his sympathy and told him
  he had expected the news. When he asked to speak to Charlie, he grew
  maudlin.</p>

  <p>"It's only a long sleep, my boy. We all of us have to come to it. I wish
  it was me. I'm all in. Just a long sleep."</p>

  <p>He added that, as he could do nothing, he would post the death certificate
  immediately. But Puggie, who knew his man, thoughtfully saved him the pains
  of procrastination by calling at the surgery the next morning.</p>

  <p>With the important document in their possession, the two conspirators
  pushed on the arrangements for the funeral. Puggie cracked macabre jokes as
  he arranged the dummy in the cheap coffin and covered the faded wax face with
  white satin. He kept inventing touching tributes, for Charlie to write on the
  card attached to his wreath.</p>

  <p>"Put 'We'll meet again.' You know, Charlie, she may be put in as
  evidence."</p>

  <p>Alan Pole was also a happy man that morning. When he arrived at the
  office, he was told that he had been selected to transact rather a
  complicated little bit of business with a small country branch of the
  company.</p>

  <p>Coming on top of his engagement, he looked upon the mission as a good
  omen. He was so elated that before catching his train he dashed off a note to
  Jennifer, telling her his news.</p>

  <p>The letter was sent by express messenger, since Jennifer had forbidden him
  to ring her up at the office. She received it just as she was going out to an
  early lunch. Slipping it into her bag, she read it over her salad and coffee,
  at the Leicester Square Corner House.</p>

  <p>As she did so, she smiled, while her eyes grew soft.</p>

  <p>"He's sweet," she thought. "It's a shame to worry him over that wretched
  Beaverbrook. I'll ring up C.B. now and tell him not to come to-night. Alan
  will be thrilled when he hears it's all off."</p>

  <p>She was on the point of entering a telephone box, when she remembered the
  book.</p>

  <p>"I can't leave it on his hands when he's got it especially for me," she
  reflected. She was honest enough to add, "Besides, I want it. I'll go over to
  his flat and collect it now. It'll only take five minutes, And then I'll slip
  in about my engagement. If I know the gentleman, he'll cool off on the
  spot."</p>

  <p>Although Jennifer had not visited Charlie's flat, she was free from all
  Victorian prejudices. Chester always treated her with such stressed deference
  that she had no fear that her motive would be misunderstood.</p>

  <p>As the small lift was in use, she ran up the three flights of dirty stone
  stairs and reached the door, flushed and panting.</p>

  <p>When Charlie answered her ring, he stared at her, as though he could not
  believe his eyes. She laughed at his astonished face, before she noticed his
  black frock-coat.</p>

  <p>"All dressed up for a wedding?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No. A funeral. My wife's. Isn't it a joke?"</p>

  <p>"Just too jolly."</p>

  <p>She broke off in the middle of her laughter.</p>

  <p>"I've come to collect that book you got for me. Tell me what I owe you and
  I'll settle up now."</p>

  <p>There was a new freedom in her manner&mdash;a radiance in her
  smile&mdash;which swept away Charlie's caution. He reminded himself that he
  could enjoy five precious minutes of Jennifer's company before the
  motor-hearse was due to arrive.</p>

  <p>"You shall have it," he promised. "Come into the lounge."</p>

  <p>When they entered the stuffy ornate room, a big man got up from the divan.
  He was also wearing a black frock-coat.</p>

  <p>Charlie introduced him as a friend&mdash;Mr. Williams.</p>

  <p>Jennifer could not understand his glance of intent interest as he bowed in
  a formal manner. She had forgotten that she had seen him before, for she was
  unlike Puggie, who always memorised faces.</p>

  <p>"I want to speak to you, Beaverbrook," he said. Then he turned to
  Jennifer. "Will you excuse us for two minutes?"</p>

  <p>Although Charlie tried to resist him, he practically pulled him from the
  lounge. When they were on the landing, he led the way into the big bedroom
  where the coffin rested upon the bed.</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"My girl," replied Charlie proudly.</p>

  <p>"The hell she is. She's from the Insurance. They smell a rat."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-30"
     id="ch-30"></a>XXX. &mdash; THE HIDING-PLACE</h2>

  <p class="first">CHARLIE'S jaw dropped as he stared blankly at Puggie.</p>

  <p>"It's a lie," he declared.</p>

  <p>"All right, it's a lie," agreed Puggie. "I only know I saw that girl in
  some chap's office, when I called to arrange about Vera's policy. She was
  pounding away at a typewriter. You know I'm never mistaken about faces."</p>

  <p>"But she works at a literary agent's."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i> literary agent?"</p>

  <p>Puggie was startled by the change in Charlie's face as he remembered how
  the office had denied all knowledge of Jennifer, when he had tried to ring
  her up. At the time, he thought it was an excuse not to meet him; but now he
  realised that she had deceived him deliberately.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he stammered. "She told me so, and I believed her."</p>

  <p>"You bet you did," sneered Puggie. "She's a College girl, isn't she? Has
  she asked you any questions about yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you stall?"</p>

  <p>"No, I told her the truth."</p>

  <p>"You everlasting mug, why did you do that?"</p>

  <p>"It&mdash;it seemed funny. And I knew she wouldn't believe me."</p>

  <p>Puggie gave a disgusted snort.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "it doesn't look too good to me. Of course, the Company
  has nothing against us, until we claim. But I'm clearing out at once."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"We can't stop the hearse now," he said, "but we must send the men away
  directly they come. Explain it's a hoax. And then we'd better clear out."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Because of that girl. She's never been here before. So why should she
  come <i>to-day</i>? Looks to me as if she's been sent here to snoop round. If
  we'd gone into my room instead of this, I bet she'd have nipped in here, to
  peek at our corpse."</p>

  <p>Although Puggie had infected Charlie with some of his own suspicion, he
  could not convince him entirely.</p>

  <p>"She can't do anything," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Can't she? How do you know she's not waiting for the undertaker to show
  up, when she'll produce an Authority from the Company, to view the body?"</p>

  <p>Puggie spoke wildly in his wish to disillusion Charlie, but he succeeded
  in his purpose. Charlie began to breathe heavily as he realised his position.
  He was caught in a cleft stick. He had lost Vera&mdash;the best wife in the
  world&mdash;and he had lost Vera's money.</p>

  <p>Before him was a double menace. If he persisted in the Insurance fraud, it
  might lead to prison. But that was a shadowy threat&mdash;still a long way
  off&mdash;while, almost under his nose, was the pen.</p>

  <p>Hours of sitting still, to be passed over until he was chosen by some
  gross fleshy partner. As he thought of it, a thin line of foam began to
  bubble up between his lips.</p>

  <p>"I won't work," he decided.</p>

  <p>"Don't stand sweating like a stuck pig," said Puggie brutally. "Get a move
  on."</p>

  <p>He hurried out to the landing, but Charlie returned to the sitting-room.
  The ferment in his brain had died suddenly as the scum rose to the top. Now
  he felt master of the situation. The rat, Puggie Williams, might scuttle, but
  he intended to sit firm and collect his ten thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>Jennifer was glad when he entered, for she wanted to get back to the
  office. There was something, too, about the room which vaguely repelled her.
  It was hot and airless, for the windows were closed to keep out the noise of
  the street. There was deep luxurious divans, and chairs piled with cushions,
  which smelt of cigarette-ash and dust. When she sat down, she seemed to sink
  into layers of suffocating softness.</p>

  <p>"Have you got my book?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll get it," replied Charlie.</p>

  <p>He crossed over to the cupboard bookcase and then turned round
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"Is it true," he asked softly, "that there's a connection between you and
  an Insurance Company?"</p>

  <p>Guilt made Jennifer blush hotly at the unexpected question. She jumped to
  the natural conclusion that Charlie had heard of her engagement. She had an
  excellent natural complexion, and as Charlie stared at her, she grew red to
  the roots of her hair.</p>

  <p>"Who told you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Little bird."</p>

  <p>"But <i>who</i> could have told you about me and Alan Pole?"</p>

  <p>As she mentioned the name of the other man, Charlie felt the familiar boil
  in his brain. He stretched out his hand to reach the top shelf of the
  cupboard. In one corner was the bottle of chloroform, which had been
  forgotten by Dr. Ruddy. Although there was no clear purpose in his mind, his
  fingers closed around it.</p>

  <p>"Is it true?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"Yes. We are engaged."</p>

  <p>"Congratulations."</p>

  <p>Charlie returned to the divan and leaned over the back. The light was
  behind him, so that Jennifer could only see his eyes and teeth, glimmering
  whitely in the dark oval of his face.</p>

  <p>"This book will tell you all about poisons and drugs," he said. "Talking
  of drugs, I've some chloroform here. Relic of my medical student days. Would
  you like half a whiff?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Jennifer bluntly, pushing aside the bottle.</p>

  <p>"Yes, do. It's a marvellous sensation."</p>

  <p>"But I don't want&mdash;<i>Stop.</i> What are you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At first, Jennifer could not credit that anything was wrong. She heard
  Charlie's heavy breathing as he leant over her, and she tried to rise from
  her divan. But he pushed her back, while he attempted to press a handkerchief
  over her face.</p>

  <p>She was a strong girl and put up a good fight, but fear had lent him the
  strength of a tiger. True to type, however, it was a tiger that had sheathed
  its claws. Throughout the struggle, Charlie instinctively shrank from direct
  brutality of attack. Although he knelt upon her, the piled-up cushions were a
  protective barrier between her and the pressure of his elbows and knees.</p>

  <p>The sickly smell of the drug hung heavy in the air. Its fumes mounted to
  Charlie, so that he was afraid that he, too, might be overcome. But even as
  the possibility flashed across his mind, he realised that Jennifer's
  resistance was becoming feebler. The body below his grew gradually limp, and
  one hand dropped over the edge of the divan.</p>

  <p>Jennifer felt the sudden rush of unconsciousness overpowering her, like
  dark water breaking through a dam. Just before the final black-out, she had
  an upside-down vision of a window veiled with majenta net, and a vase of
  three enormous purple-pink chrysanthemums with drooping petals.</p>

  <p>"Mops," she thought, with no last memory of Alan.</p>

  <p>When Charlie was satisfied that she was no longer stirring, he staggered
  across the room, threw up a window, and spat into the flower-box. After this
  precaution, he returned to the divan.</p>

  <p>His brain was still too curdled to think clearly, but he realised that he
  must keep her unconscious until the coffin had been safely taken away.</p>

  <p>If the men were punctual it would only be a matter of minutes. Afterwards,
  he must try to bluff her into believing that she had fainted. He must also
  reassure her, and laugh away any suggestion that there had been a funeral
  from the flat.</p>

  <p>First of all, he had to tidy the room and remove all traces of a struggle.
  Picking up her bag from the floor, he noticed an envelope protruding from its
  flap. On the back was stamped the name of the Insurance Company, which had
  issued Vera's policy.</p>

  <p>Panic quivered into his eyes, like sheet-lightning, shaking his brain as
  he took out Alan's note, which was written on the incriminating evidence of
  official paper. The first sentence seared itself into his consciousness.</p>

  <p>"Darling, it was sweet of you to want to help me with that big
  fraud&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charlie read no further. Like the throbbing of twin dynamos, his whole
  frame vibrated with rage and fear. This college girl was a contemptible spy
  who had planned his defeat, to help some miserable office youth. He had
  sacrificed everything for her, while she had come to the flat on purpose to
  betray him.</p>

  <p>Prison was no longer a faraway misty prospect. Its walls and bars were
  flush with this room. Black Maria waited at the door. This was the end of
  all. No more silk skirts or cocktails or bath-salts. No more pleasure. No
  more freedom.</p>

  <p>For the moment he had a respite. But how could he hold Jennifer? How could
  he silence her indefinitely? He stooped over her and then staggered back,
  aghast by the change in her.</p>

  <p>This boneless bundle was not the radiant college girl who had charged
  triumphantly into his life, with colours flying. Her unfamiliar face was
  pallid, with horrible white slits, instead of eyes. She slumped grotesquely,
  with sprawling limbs.</p>

  <p>He shrank from her, yet he had to bind and gag her, lest she should regain
  consciousness when the funeral party arrived. Still goaded by fear, he tied
  her legs together with silk scarves, and then bound her arms tightly to her
  body with the cord of his dressing-gown. One large handkerchief was wedged
  down her throat and another covered her mouth.</p>

  <p>He did everything deftly and gently, as though she could feel. Whatever
  the measure of her treachery he knew he could not hurt her. But she lay
  horribly still, lifeless as the dummy in the other room. When he had finished
  his task he glanced down at her, and then staggered back in sudden
  terror.</p>

  <p>This was a <i>thing</i>...She was dead. He had given her too much
  chloroform...The sweat broke out on his forehead like raindrops. It was not
  his fault. She had struggled too fiercely&mdash;prolonged her opposition
  beyond the limit of safety.</p>

  <p>Besides, she had not suffered. It was just a long sleep. Dr. Ruddy had
  assured him of that. But he had to hide her.</p>

  <p>A red light gleamed in his eyes as a hideous idea sprang to birth. He knew
  of a safe place of concealment for her body.</p>

  <p>Dashing into his bedroom, he dragged the dummy from its coffin and kicked
  it under the bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-31"
     id="ch-31"></a>XXXI. &mdash; NAILS</h2>

  <p class="first">JENNIFER lay in her coffin.</p>

  <p>When she struggled gradually out of her stupor, she became conscious of
  darkness and a sense of terrible constriction. She could neither move or
  utter a sound. Something was filling her mouth, so that she could scarcely
  breathe. Her face, too, was muffled by some soft material.</p>

  <p>For one ghastly moment, she thought she was buried alive.</p>

  <p>The horror crashed down on her, nearly driving her mad; but even as her
  reason trembled on the lip of insanity, her ear distinguished faint sounds of
  traffic. The back-firing of a car engine in Shaftesbury Avenue proved her
  salvation.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" she questioned in an agony. "What's happened to me?"</p>

  <p>The answer filtered slowly through the clouded layers of her mind. She
  realised first that she was gagged and bound, although she could flex her
  fingers and turn her head slightly. Then, by degrees, she remembered that she
  was in Beaverbrook's flat, and that&mdash;for no reason at all&mdash;he had
  turned suddenly upon her.</p>

  <p>"I was a fool to trust him," she realised bitterly. "Alan was right."</p>

  <p>The thought of Alan was a sheet-anchor&mdash;something to grip in the
  midst of the nightmare phantasy. It was all so blurred and inexplicable that
  she began to wonder whether she were really conscious. She retained some
  vague recollection of Beaverbrook asking her to sample a drug.</p>

  <p>"I'm dreaming all this," she told herself. "In another minute, I shall
  really wake up and find myself on the divan. I expect C.B. is only waiting to
  have the laugh of me."</p>

  <p>As she struggled to break through to the daylight and reality, she
  realised that there was a confused suggestion of voices&mdash;somewhere in
  the air&mdash;which was always on the point of sharpening into actual words.
  Suddenly, like the roar of a train rushing through a tunnel, something burst
  in her ear-drums, so that she heard a man speaking.</p>

  <p>"Is she <i>dead</i>?"</p>

  <p>It was Puggie Williams who spoke, as he stared stupidly at the coffin with
  bloodshot eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Charlie was shaking all over. He could hardly frame his words with
  his trembling lips. "It was a&mdash;an accident. It wasn't my fault. I swear
  it wasn't."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Chloroform. I&mdash;I didn't hurt her. I only wanted to keep her quiet
  for a bit. But she fought like a wild-cat. It was her own fault that she got
  too much."</p>

  <p>"You blasted fool? This will be manslaughter at the least. I'm clearing
  out&mdash;pronto."</p>

  <p>"No, Puggie, see me through. Honestly, it's <i>all right.</i> No one will
  ever know."</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe it. You'll be on the front page to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;can't you see? The men are here. They're just outside, in the
  hall...I had a terrible rush to&mdash;to finish before you sent them
  away."</p>

  <p>Although its tone was high and reedy, some of the confidence had returned
  to Charlie's voice.</p>

  <p>But Puggie's whisper was thick with horror.</p>

  <p>"So <i>that's</i> the big idea of putting her there? What a man! He had to
  have his corpse...Well, you can tell the jury all about it."</p>

  <p>He shook off Charlie's grasp and hurried towards the door. Before he
  reached it, however, he stopped, struck by a new idea.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure she's dead?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Positive."</p>

  <p>"Well, you ought to know. You've been a doctor, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>As Vera had foreseen, Puggie could not be depended on in a crisis. He had
  been drinking too heavily to realise the importance of his question. Although
  he had only to raise the lid of the coffin, he went no further in the
  matter.</p>

  <p>According to his reasoning, the main point was to get away from the flat
  as quickly as possible, since Charlie had tried to put a fast one over
  him.</p>

  <p>Inside the coffin, Jennifer heard every word. As she listened, the acid of
  terror ate away the film which clouded her brain. At last she understood the
  whole ghastly business.</p>

  <p>She was scheduled for burial&mdash;gagged, bound, and
  confined&mdash;unable to move or call out. Soon she would be borne away to
  some place where she would be buried in the ground.</p>

  <p>She had invited experience, to meet with realism of the most appalling
  kind. If she saw this situation in a picture, she knew that a rescue would be
  inevitable. She would be missed at the office and traced by some trifling
  clue&mdash;something she had said, or done, during the morning, to this
  flat.</p>

  <p>Besides Alan must know of her peril. At the critical moment, he would dash
  through the door and wrench away the coffin lid. He would hold her in his
  arras again.</p>

  <p>She felt the tears rolling down her cheeks at the very thought of him. He
  had never seemed so dear.</p>

  <p>And at that moment, as though to furnish one more proof of telepathy, Alan
  was thinking of her. He had finished his business and was having a lunch of
  bread and cheese and beer in a small country inn. Outside the window, the sun
  had just burst through the clouds and a bird began to sing on the bare bough
  of a chestnut tree.</p>

  <p>"Wonder if she's got my letter," he thought.</p>

  <p>Even then Jennifer gave up hope.</p>

  <p>"He can't know," she told herself. "He's miles away. No one knows where I
  am."</p>

  <p>Her mind was now hideously clear as she forecast the immediate
  future&mdash;only to realise that there would be very little of it.</p>

  <p>"Unless I'm rescued soon, I shall suffocate. It can't be long.
  Only&mdash;every minute will seem years."</p>

  <p>Already her physical suffering was mounting to the peak of her endurance.
  Every breath she drew became an agony. Her heart seemed to stumble to a stop,
  and then to limp on again in feeble beats. A sea began to roar in her
  ears.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she realised that there were others in the room besides Chester
  Beaverbrook. There were movements and footsteps, muffled by the carpet. Then
  Charlie's voice rang out in a sharp command.</p>

  <p>"Be as quick as you can. We're behind time as it is."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," replied one of the men.</p>

  <p>A ring at the front door deadened the sound of a horrible little grating
  noise. At first Jennifer did not know what was happening, until a repetition
  of the scraping made her realise the ghastly truth.</p>

  <p>The coffin lid was being screwed down.</p>

  <p>Every living fibre in her body seemed to protest against the outrage.
  Curiously enough, it was her sense of justice&mdash;so strong a trait in the
  English character&mdash;which was outraged by those terrible sounds.</p>

  <p>"I've done nothing to deserve this," she agonised. "It cannot happen to
  me. It won't be allowed."</p>

  <p>All the same it was happening. She endured through seconds which dragged
  out into an eternity of duration...</p>

  <p>Just as she fainted, one of the men spoke to Charlie:</p>

  <p>"That's my mate ringing, sir. Shall I let him in?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'll go."</p>

  <p>Charlie felt a rising flood of elation as he opened the front door. He had
  planned a master-stroke of strategy, which every minute was bringing nearer
  to a successful finish.</p>

  <p>His shock, therefore, was the greater when he saw before him Dr. Ruddy. As
  he stared at him the doctor spoke awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to intrude at such a time, Beaverbrook. I'm afraid I'm going to
  upset you&mdash;but this is my authority."</p>

  <p>He produced a letter, but Charlie did not take it.</p>

  <p>"<i>Authority?</i>" he repeated.</p>

  <p>Dr. Ruddy thought the widower was dazed by his bereavement so he took
  command. Without further explanations he walked into the bedroom and spoke to
  the men.</p>

  <p>"Unscrew that lid."</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>," protested Charlie, in a high voice which was nearly a scream.
  "It's an outrage."</p>

  <p>"It's your wife's wish," explained Dr. Ruddy. "I couldn't sleep to-night
  if I failed her. Neither could you. Now, suppose you wait in the lounge and
  then you won't see what I'm going to do. It will be over in a minute."</p>

  <p>"No. You're drunk."</p>

  <p>Dr. Ruddy chanced to be cold sober, so he resented the charge. It made him
  the more determined to impose his will.</p>

  <p>"I wrote a certificate without inspecting the body," he explained. "That's
  not in order. For my own satisfaction, I must insist on the coffin being
  opened...Take out these screws."</p>

  <p>He spoke with the ring of authority. The men glanced sheepishly at
  Charlie&mdash;who offered no more opposition&mdash;and then hastened to
  obey.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to see her face," said Charlie.</p>

  <p>He went in to the lounge and shut the door behind him. Yet he heard the
  doctor's shout as he wrenched off the lid.</p>

  <p>"It's another woman...And...Man, she's <i>alive.</i>"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-32"
     id="ch-32"></a>XXXII. &mdash; THE SECOND TIME</h2>

  <p class="first">DR. RUDDY told his wife afterwards that Jennifer was the
  finest and jolliest girl he had ever met.</p>

  <p>She became conscious, to find herself lying on the purple
  bed&mdash;ungagged and unbound&mdash;with the doctor bending over her.
  Instead of breaking down, as he expected, she lost no time in getting the
  chloroform out of her system.</p>

  <p>While she was being violently sick in the bathroom, she actually laughed
  between her spasms.</p>

  <p>"I'm <i>alive</i>," she kept saying. "Oh, thank God. I never thought I
  could <i>enjoy</i> being sick. Oh, isn't it <i>wonderful</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but you've done quite enough in that line for the present," said Dr.
  Ruddy firmly. "This isn't a Channel crossing. You're feeling pretty groggy.
  Come and lie down again."</p>

  <p>She was prostrate with exhaustion when she was settled under the purple
  eiderdown, but she persisted in asking questions.</p>

  <p>"How did you know I was there?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;why did you come?"</p>

  <p>"Because I got rather an odd letter a little time ago, from Mrs.
  Beaverbrook. Like to see it?"</p>

  <p>He fished from his pocket a creased sheet of paper, which was stamped with
  the address of a well-known Brighton hotel.</p>

  <p>It was Vera's letter, written in collaboration with a bad dream and half a
  bottle of brandy. Although the words jigged before her eyes, Jennifer managed
  to decipher the scrawl.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Dr. Ruddy</span>&mdash;I've had a
  terrible dream. I dreamed that I was buried alive. I'm so frightened. It may
  be sent to warn me. <i>Promise</i> to run a knife into my heart when I am
  dead. Charlie will give you ten pounds. Don't fail me.
  Yours&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vera B.</span>"</p><br>

  <p>"Oh," gasped Jennifer. "Was he married?"</p>

  <p>"They always are, my dear."</p>

  <p>"So you know, too. I'm the only sap...But why did you cut it so fine?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Ruddy looked abashed before her accusing eye.</p>

  <p>"I'm ashamed to say it slipped my memory," he confessed. "But my wife
  remarked that Chester Beaverbrook was in a big hurry to bury his wife. So I
  made a rush for it and managed to be on time, for about the first time in my
  life."</p>

  <p>Jennifer looked gratefully up at the weak, sagging face. Dr. Ruddy might
  not come when sent for, and if he came he might not give the right treatment.
  But she realised that he could be depended upon to do the decent thing.</p>

  <p>"Who's 'Charlie'?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Blest if I know. Probably it was a slip...Now, lie still and try to get
  some sleep...I want to have a little chat with Beaverbrook."</p>

  <p>He pulled down the corners of his mouth, for he did not relish the
  interview. Directly he had realised that something was wrong, he had ordered
  one of the undertaker's men to guard the front door, so that no one could
  leave the flat, pending the arrival of the police.</p>

  <p>He hoped, however, that Beaverbrook would give him a satisfactory
  explanation, so that it would not be necessary for him to ring up the
  station.</p>

  <p>Directly he entered the lounge, he guessed that Chester Beaverbrook would
  issue no statement to the Press.</p>

  <p>Charlie Baxter had made himself very comfortable, for he had collected
  every cushion in the room and piled them on the divan where he lay. His face
  was covered with a handkerchief and the air reeked with chloroform.</p>

  <p>It was the second time he died.</p>
