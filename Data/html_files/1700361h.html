  <h2 align="center"><b>I</b></h2>
  <p>A  tragedy of no little interest occurred in one of the residences of the  Colonnade in Lafayette Place.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Hasbrouck, a well-known and highly respected citizen, was attacked in his room  by an unknown assailant, and shot dead before assistance could reach him. His  murderer escaped, and the problem offered to the police was, how to identify  this person who, by some happy chance or by the exercise of the most  remarkable forethought, had left no traces behind him, or any clue by which he  could be followed.</p>
  <p>The  affair was given to a young man, named Ebenezer Gryce, to investigate, and the  story, as he tells it, is this:</p>
  <p>When,  some time after midnight, I reached Lafayette Place, I found the block lighted  from end to end. Groups of excited men and women peered from the open doorways,  and mingled their shadows with those of the huge pillars which adorn the front  of this picturesque block of dwellings.</p>
  <p>The  house in which the crime had been committed was near the centre of the row,  and, long before I reached it, I had learned from more than one source that the  alarm was first given to the street by a woman&rsquo;s shriek, and secondly by the  shouts of an old man-servant who had appeared, in a half-dressed condition, at  the window of Mr. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s room, crying &ldquo;Murder! murder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  when I had crossed the threshold, I was astonished at the paucity of the facts  to be gleaned from the inmates themselves. The old servitor, who was the first  to talk, had only this account of the crime to give.</p>
  <p>The  family, which consisted of Mr. Hasbrouck, his wife, and three servants, had  retired for the night at the usual hour and under the usual auspices. At eleven  o&rsquo;clock the lights were all extinguished, and the whole household asleep, with  the possible exception of Mr. Hasbrouck himself, who, being a man of large  business responsibilities, was frequently troubled with insomnia.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  Mrs. Hasbrouck woke with a start. Had she dreamed the words that were ringing  in her ears, or had they been actually uttered in her hearing? They were short,  sharp words, full of terror and menace, and she had nearly satisfied herself  that she had imagined them, when there came, from somewhere near the door, a  sound she neither understood nor could interpret, but which filled her with  inexplicable terror, and made her afraid to breathe, or even to stretch forth  her hand towards her husband, whom she supposed to be sleeping at her side. At  length another strange sound, which she was sure was not due to her  imagination, drove her to make an attempt to rouse him, when she was horrified  to find that she was alone in the bed, and her husband nowhere within reach.</p>
  <p>Filled  now with something more than nervous apprehension, she flung herself to the  floor, and tried to penetrate, with frenzied glances, the surrounding darkness.  But the blinds and shutters both having been carefully closed by Mr. Hasbrouck  before retiring, she found this impossible, and she was about to sink in terror  to the floor, when she heard a low gasp on the other side of the room, followed  by the suppressed cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God!  what have I done!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  voice was a strange one, but before the fear aroused by this fact could  culminate in a shriek of dismay, she caught the sound of retreating footsteps,  and, eagerly listening, she heard them descend the stairs and depart by the  front door.</p>
  <p>Had  she known what had occurred&mdash;had there been no doubt in her mind as to what lay  in the darkness on the other side of the room&mdash;it is likely that, at the noise  caused by the closing front door, she would have made at once for the balcony  that opened out from the window before which she was standing, and taken one  look at the flying figure below. But her uncertainty as to what lay hidden from  her by the darkness chained her feet to the floor, and there is no knowing when  she would have moved, if a carriage had not at that moment passed down Astor  Place, bringing with it a sense of companionship which broke the spell that  held her, and gave her strength to light the gas, which was in ready reach of  her hand.</p>
  <p>As  the sudden blaze illuminated the room, revealing in a burst the old familiar  walls and well-known pieces of furniture, she felt for a moment as if released  from some heavy nightmare and restored to the common experiences of life. But  in another instant her former dread returned, and she found herself quaking at  the prospect of passing around the foot of the bed into that part of the room  which was as yet hidden from her eyes.</p>
  <p>But  the desperation which comes with great crises finally drove her from her  retreat; and, creeping slowly forward, she cast one glance at the floor before  her, when she found her worst fears realized by the sight of the dead body of  her husband lying prone before the open doorway, with a bullet-hole in his  forehead.</p>
  <p>Her  first impulse was to shriek, but, by a powerful exercise of will, she checked  herself, and, ringing frantically for the servants who slept on the top-floor  of the house, flew to the nearest window and endeavored to open it. But the  shutters had been bolted so securely by Mr. Hasbrouck, in his endeavor to shut  out light and sound, that by the time she had succeeded in unfastening them,  all trace of the flying murderer had vanished from the street.</p>
  <p>Sick  with grief and terror, she stepped back into the room just as the three  frightened servants descended the stairs. As they appeared in the open doorway,  she pointed at her husband&rsquo;s inanimate form, and then, as if suddenly realizing  in its full force the calamity which had befallen her, she threw up her arms,  and sank forward to the floor in a dead faint.</p>
  <p>The  two women rushed to her assistance, but the old butler, bounding over the bed,  sprang to the window, and shrieked his alarm to the street.</p>
  <p>In  the interim that followed, Mrs. Hasbrouck was revived, and the master&rsquo;s body  laid decently on the bed; but no pursuit was made, nor any inquiries started  likely to assist me in establishing the identity of the assailant.</p>
  <p>Indeed,  every one, both in the house and out, seemed dazed by the unexpected  catastrophe, and as no one had any suspicions to offer as to the probable  murderer, I had a difficult task before me.</p>
  <p>I  began, in the usual way, by inspecting the scene of the murder. I found nothing  in the room, or in the condition of the body itself, which added an iota to the  knowledge already obtained. That Mr. Hasbrouck had been in bed; that he had  risen upon hearing a noise; and that he had been shot before reaching the door,  were self-evident facts. But there was nothing to guide me further. The very  simplicity of the circumstances caused a dearth of clues, which made the  difficulty of procedure as great as any I ever encountered.</p>
  <p>My  search through the hall and down the stairs elicited nothing; and an  investigation of the bolts and bars by which the house was secured, assured me  that the assassin had either entered by the front door, or had already been  secreted in the house when it was locked up for the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall have to trouble Mrs. Hasbrouck for a short interview,&rdquo; I hereupon  announced to the trembling old servitor, who had followed me like a dog about  the house.</p>
  <p>He  made no demur, and in a few minutes I was ushered into the presence of the  newly made widow, who sat quite alone, in a large chamber in the rear. As I  crossed the threshold she looked up, and I encountered a good plain face,  without the shadow of guile in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;I have not come to disturb you. I will ask two or three questions  only, and then leave you to your grief. I am told that some words came from the  assassin before he delivered his fatal shot. Did you hear these distinctly  enough to tell me what they were?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was sound asleep,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and dreamt, as I thought, that a fierce, strange  voice cried somewhere to some one: &lsquo;Ah! you did not expect <i>me!&rsquo;</i> But I dare not say that these words were really uttered to my  husband, for he was not the man to call forth hate, and only a man in the  extremity of passion could address such an exclamation in such a tone as rings  in my memory in connection with the fatal shot which woke me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that shot was not the work of a friend,&rdquo; I argued. &ldquo;If, as these words seem to  prove, the assassin had some other motive than gain in his assault, then your  husband had an enemy, though you never suspected it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;  was her steady reply, uttered in the most convincing tone. &ldquo;The man who shot  him was a common burglar, and, frightened at having been betrayed into murder,  fled without looking for booty. I am sure I heard him cry out in terror and  remorse: &lsquo;God! what have I done!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  that before you left the side of the bed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I did not move from my place till I heard the front door close. I was paralyzed  by my fear and dread.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you in the habit of trusting to the security of a latch-lock only in the  fastening of your front door at night? I am told that the big key was not in  the lock, and that the bolt at the bottom of the door was not drawn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  bolt at the bottom of the door is never drawn. Mr. Hasbrouck was so good a man  he never mistrusted any one. That is why the big lock was not fastened. The  key, not working well, he took it some days ago to the locksmith, and when the  latter failed to return it, he laughed, and said he thought no one would ever  think of meddling with his front door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there more than one night-key to your house?&rdquo; I now asked.</p>
  <p>She  shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when did Mr. Hasbrouck last use his?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night,  when he came home from prayer-meeting,&rdquo; she answered, and burst into tears.</p>
  <p>Her  grief was so real and her loss so recent that I hesitated to afflict her by  further questions. So returning to the scene of the tragedy, I stepped out upon  the balcony which ran in front. Soft voices instantly struck my ears. The  neighbors on either side were grouped in front of their own windows, and were  exchanging the remarks natural under the circumstances. I paused, as in duty  bound, and listened. But I heard nothing worth recording, and would have  instantly re-entered the house, if I had not been impressed by the appearance  of a very graceful woman who stood at my right. She was clinging to her  husband, who was gazing at one of the pillars before him in a strange, fixed  way which astonished me till he attempted to move, and then I saw that he was  blind. Instantly I remembered that there lived in this row a blind doctor,  equally celebrated for his skill and for his uncommon personal attractions,  and, greatly interested not only in his affliction, but in the sympathy evinced  for him by his young and affectionate wife, I stood still till I heard her say  in the soft and appealing tones of love:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in, Constant; you have heavy duties for to-morrow, and you should get a few  hours&rsquo; rest, if possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  came from the shadow of the pillar, and for one minute I saw his face with the  lamplight shining full upon it. It was as regular of feature as a sculptured  Adonis, and it was as white.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sleep!&rdquo;  he repeated, in the measured tones of deep but suppressed feeling. &ldquo;Sleep! with  murder on the other side of the wall!&rdquo; And he stretched out his arms in a dazed  way that insensibly accentuated the horror I myself felt of the crime which had  so lately taken place in the room behind me.</p>
  <p>She,  noting the movement, took one of the groping hands in her own and drew him  gently towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  way,&rdquo; she urged; and, guiding him into the house, she closed the window and  drew down the shades, making the street seem darker by the loss of her  exquisite presence.</p>
  <p>This  may seem a digression, but I was at the time a young man of thirty, and much  under the dominion of woman&rsquo;s beauty. I was therefore slow in leaving the  balcony, and persistent in my wish to learn something of this remarkable couple  before leaving Mr. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s house.</p>
  <p>The  story told me was very simple. Dr. Zabriskie had not been born blind, but had  become so after a grievous illness which had stricken him down soon after he  received his diploma. Instead of succumbing to an affliction which would have  daunted most men, he expressed his intention of practising his profession, and  soon became so successful in it that he found no difficulty in establishing  himself in one of the best-paying quarters of the city. Indeed, his intuition  seemed to have developed in a remarkable degree after his loss of sight, and he  seldom, if ever, made a mistake in diagnosis. Considering this fact, and the  personal attractions which gave him distinction, it was no wonder that he soon  became a popular physician whose presence was a benefaction and whose word a  law.</p>
  <p>He  had been engaged to be married at the time of his illness, and, when he learned  what was likely to be its results, had offered to release the young lady from  all obligation to him. But she would not be released, and they were married.  This had taken place some five years previous to Mr. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s death, three  of which had been spent by them in Lafayette Place.</p>
  <p>So  much for the beautiful woman next door.</p>
  <p>There  being absolutely no clue to the assailant of Mr. Hasbrouck, I naturally looked  forward to the inquest for some evidence upon which to work. But there seemed  to be no underlying facts to this tragedy. The most careful study into the  habits and conduct of the deceased brought nothing to light save his general  beneficence and rectitude, nor was there in his history or in that of his wife  any secret or hidden obligation calculated to provoke any such act of revenge  as murder. Mrs. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s surmise that the intruder was simply a burglar, and  that she had rather imagined than heard the words that pointed to the shooting  as a deed of vengeance, soon gained general credence. But, though the police  worked long and arduously in this new direction, their efforts were without  fruit, and the case bade fair to remain an unsolvable mystery.</p>
  <p>But  the deeper the mystery the more persistently does my mind cling to it, and some  five months after the matter had been delegated to oblivion, I found myself  starting suddenly from sleep, with these words ringing in my ears:</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;Who uttered the scream that gave the  first alarm of Mr. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s violent death?&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>I  was in such a state of excitement that the perspiration stood out on my  forehead. Mrs. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s story of the occurrence returned to me, and I  remembered as distinctly as if she were then speaking, that she had expressly  stated that she did not scream when confronted by the sight of her husband&rsquo;s  dead body. But some one had screamed, and that very loudly. Who was it, then?  One of the maids, startled by the sudden summons from below, or some one  else&mdash;some involuntary witness of the crime, whose testimony had been suppressed  at the inquest, by fear or influence?</p>
  <p>The  possibility of having come upon a clue even at this late day, so fired my  ambition, that I took the first opportunity of revisiting Lafayette Place.  Choosing such persons as I thought most open to my questions, I learned that  there were many who could testify to having heard a woman&rsquo;s shrill scream on  that memorable night just prior to the alarm given by old Cyrus, but no one who  could tell from whose lips it had come. One fact, however, was immediately  settled. It had not been the result of the servant-women&rsquo;s fears. Both of the  girls were positive that they had uttered no sound, nor had they themselves  heard any, till Cyrus rushed to the window with his wild cries. As the scream,  by whomever given, was uttered before they descended the stairs, I was  convinced by these assurances that it had issued from one of the front windows,  and not from the rear of the house, where their own rooms lay. Could it be that  it had sprung from the adjoining dwelling, and that&mdash; My thoughts went no  further, but I made up my mind to visit the Doctor&rsquo;s house at once.</p>
  <p>It  took some courage to do this, for the Doctor&rsquo;s wife had attended the inquest,  and her beauty, seen in broad daylight, had worn such an aspect of mingled  sweetness and dignity, that I hesitated to encounter it under any circumstances  likely to disturb its pure serenity. But a clue, once grasped, cannot be  lightly set aside by a true detective, and it would have taken more than a  woman&rsquo;s frown to stop me at this point. So I rang Dr. Zabriskie&rsquo;s bell.</p>
  <p>I  am seventy years old now and am no longer daunted by the charms of a beautiful  woman, but I confess that when I found myself in the fine reception parlor on  the first-floor, I experienced no little trepidation at the prospect of the  interview which awaited me.</p>
  <p>But  as soon as the fine commanding form of the Doctor&rsquo;s wife crossed the threshold,  I recovered my senses and surveyed her with as direct a gaze as my position  allowed. For her aspect bespoke a degree of emotion that astonished me; and  even before I spoke I perceived her to be trembling, though she was a woman of  no little natural dignity and self-possession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  seem to know your face,&rdquo; she said, advancing courteously towards me, &ldquo;but your  name&rdquo;&mdash; and here she glanced at the card she held in her hand&mdash;&ldquo;is totally  unfamiliar to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you saw me some eighteen months ago,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am the detective who  gave testimony at the inquest which was held over the remains of Mr.  Hasbrouck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had not meant to startle her, but at this introduction of myself I saw her  naturally pale cheek turn paler, and her fine eyes, which had been fixed  curiously upon me, gradually sink to the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  heaven!&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;what is this I have stumbled upon!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand what business you can have with me,&rdquo; she presently remarked,  with a show of gentle indifference that did not in the least deceive me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not wonder,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;The crime which took place next door is almost  forgotten by the community, and even if it were not, I am sure you would find  it difficult to conjecture the nature of the question I have to put to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am surprised,&rdquo; she began, rising in her involuntary emotion and thereby  compelling me to rise also. &ldquo;How can you have any question to ask me on this subject?  Yet if you have,&rdquo; she continued, with a rapid change of manner that touched my  heart in spite of myself, &ldquo;I shall, of course, do my best to answer you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  are women whose sweetest tones and most charming smiles only serve to awaken  distrust in men of my calling; but Mrs. Zabriskie was not of this number. Her  face was beautiful, but it was also candid in its expression, and beneath the  agitation which palpably disturbed her, I was sure there lurked nothing either  wicked or false. Yet I held fast by the clue which I had grasped, as it were,  in the dark, and without knowing whither I was tending, much less whither I was  leading her, I proceeded to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  question which I presume to put to you as the next-door neighbor of Mr.  Hasbrouck, is this: Who was the woman who screamed out so loudly that the whole  neighborhood heard her on the night of that gentleman&rsquo;s assassination?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  gasp she gave answered my question in a way she little realized, and, struck as  I was by the impalpable links that had led me to the threshold of this hitherto  unsolvable mystery, I was about to press my advantage and ask another question,  when she quickly started forward and laid her hand on my lips.</p>
  <p>Astonished,  I looked at her inquiringly, but her head was turned aside, and her eyes, fixed  upon the door, showed the greatest anxiety. Instantly I realized what she  feared. Her husband was entering the house, and she dreaded lest his ears  should catch a word of our conversation.</p>
  <p>Not  knowing what was in her mind, and unable to realize the importance of the  moment to her, I yet listened to the advance of her blind husband with an  almost painful interest. Would he enter the room where we were, or would he  pass immediately to his office in the rear? She seemed to wonder too, and almost  held her breath as he neared the door, paused, and stood in the open doorway,  with his ear turned towards us.</p>
  <p>As  for myself, I remained perfectly still, gazing at his face in mingled surprise  and apprehension. For besides its beauty, which was of a marked order, as I  have already observed, it had a touching expression which irresistibly aroused  both pity and interest in the spectator. This may have been the result of his  affliction, or it may have sprung from some deeper cause; but, whatever its  source, this look in his face produced a strong impression upon me and  interested me at once in his personality. Would he enter? Or would he pass on?  Her look of silent appeal showed me in which direction her wishes lay, but  while I answered her glance by complete silence, I was conscious in some  indistinct way that the business I had undertaken would be better furthered by  his entrance.</p>
  <p>The  blind have been often said to possess a sixth sense in place of the one they  have lost. Though I am sure we made no noise, I soon perceived that he was  aware of our presence. Stepping hastily forward he said, in the high and  vibrating tone of restrained passion:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen,  are you here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  a moment I thought she did not mean to answer, but knowing doubtless from  experience the impossibility of deceiving him, she answered with a cheerful  assent, dropping her hand as she did so from before my lips.</p>
  <p>He  heard the slight rustle which accompanied the movement, and a look I found it  hard to comprehend flashed over his features, altering his expression so  completely that he seemed another man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have some one with you,&rdquo; he declared, advancing another step but with none of  the uncertainty which usually accompanies the movements of the blind. &ldquo;Some  dear friend,&rdquo; he went on, with an almost sarcastic emphasis and a forced smile  that had little of gaiety in it.</p>
  <p>The  agitated and distressed blush which answered him could have but one  interpretation. He suspected that her hand had been clasped in mine, and she  perceived his thought and knew that I perceived it also.</p>
  <p>Drawing  herself up, she moved towards him, saying in a sweet womanly tone that to me  spoke volumes:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is no friend, Constant, not even an acquaintance. The person whom I now present  to you is an agent from the police. He is here upon a trivial errand which will  be soon finished, when I will join you in your office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  knew she was but taking a choice between two evils. That she would have saved  her husband the knowledge of a detective&rsquo;s presence in the house, if her self respect  would have allowed it, but neither she nor I anticipated the effect which this  presentation produced upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  police officer,&rdquo; he repeated, staring with his sightless eyes, as if, in his  eagerness to see, he half hoped his lost sense would return. &ldquo;He can have no  trivial errand here; he has been sent by God Himself to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me speak for you,&rdquo; hastily interposed his wife, springing to his side and  clasping his arm with a fervor that was equally expressive of appeal and  command. Then turning to me, she explained: &ldquo;Since Mr. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s  unaccountable death, my husband has been laboring under an hallucination which  I have only to mention for you to recognize its perfect absurdity. He thinks&mdash;oh!  do not look like that, Constant; you know it is an hallucination which must  vanish the moment we drag it into broad daylight&mdash;that he&mdash;<i>he</i>, the best man in all the world, was himself the assailant of Mr.  Hasbrouck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Good  God!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say nothing of the impossibility of this being so,&rdquo; she went on in a fever of  expostulation. &ldquo;He is blind, and could not have delivered such a shot even if  he had desired to; besides, he had no weapon. But the inconsistency of the  thing speaks for itself, and should assure him that his mind is unbalanced and  that he is merely suffering from a shock that was greater than we realized. He  is a physician and has had many such instances in his own practice. Why, he was  very much attached to Mr. Hasbrouck! They were the best of friends, and though  he insists that he killed him, he cannot give any reason for the deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  these words the Doctor&rsquo;s face grew stern, and he spoke like an automaton  repeating some fearful lesson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  killed him. I went to his room and deliberately shot him. I had nothing against  him, and my remorse is extreme. Arrest me, and let me pay the penalty of my  crime. It is the only way in which I can obtain peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shocked  beyond all power of self-control by this repetition of what she evidently  considered the unhappy ravings of a madman, she let go his arm and turned upon  me in frenzy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Convince  him!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Convince him by your questions that he never could have done  this fearful thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was laboring under great excitement myself, for I felt my youth against me in a  matter of such tragic consequence. Besides, I agreed with her that he was in a  distempered state of mind, and I hardly knew how to deal with one so fixed in  his hallucination and with so much intelligence to support it. But the  emergency was great, for he was holding out his wrists in the evident  expectation of my taking him into instant custody; and the sight was killing  his wife, who had sunk on the floor between us, in terror and anguish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say you killed Mr. Hasbrouck,&rdquo; I began. &ldquo;Where did you get your pistol, and  what did you do with it after you left his house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  husband had no pistol; never had any pistol,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Zabriskie, with  vehement assertion. &ldquo;If I had seen him with such a weapon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  threw it away. When I left the house, I cast it as far from me as possible, for  I was frightened at what I had done, horribly frightened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  pistol was ever found,&rdquo; I answered, with a smile, forgetting for the moment  that he could not see. &ldquo;If such an instrument had been found in the street  after a murder of such consequence it certainly would have been brought to the  police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget that a good pistol is valuable property,&rdquo; he went on stolidly. &ldquo;Some one  came along before the general alarm was given; and seeing such a treasure lying  on the sidewalk, picked it up and carried it off. Not being an honest man, he  preferred to keep it to drawing the attention of the police upon himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum,  perhaps,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but where did <i>you</i> get it. Surely you can tell where you procured such a weapon, if, as your wife  intimates, you did not own one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  bought it that self-same night of a friend; a friend whom I will not name,  since he resides no longer in this country. I&mdash;&rdquo; He paused; intense passion was  in his face; he turned towards his wife, and a low cry escaped him, which made  her look up in fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not wish to go into any particulars,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;God forsook me and I  committed a horrible crime. When I am punished, perhaps peace will return to me  and happiness to her. I would not wish her to suffer too long or too bitterly  for my sin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Constant!&rdquo;  What love was in the cry! and what despair! It seemed to move him and turn his  thoughts for a moment into a different channel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  child!&rdquo; he murmured, stretching out his hands by an irresistible impulse  towards her. But the change was but momentary, and he was soon again the stern  and determined self-accuser. &ldquo;Are you going to take me before a magistrate?&rdquo; he  asked. &ldquo;If so, I have a few duties to perform which you are welcome to  witness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no warrant,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;besides, I am scarcely the one to take such a  responsibility upon myself. If, however, you persist in your declaration, I  will communicate with my superiors, who will take such action as they think  best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will be still more satisfactory to me,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for though I have many times  contemplated giving myself up to the authorities, I have still much to do  before I can leave my home and practice without injury to others. Good-day;  when you want me, you will find me here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was gone, and the poor young wife was left crouching on the floor alone.  Pitying her shame and terror, I ventured to remark that it was not an uncommon  thing for a man to confess to a crime he had never committed, and assured her  that the matter would be inquired into very carefully before any attempt was  made upon his liberty.</p>
  <p>She  thanked me, and, slowly rising, tried to regain her equanimity; but the manner  as well as the matter of her husband&rsquo;s self-condemnation was too overwhelming  in its nature for her to recover readily from her emotions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have long dreaded this,&rdquo; she acknowledged. &ldquo;For months I have foreseen that he  would make some rash communication or insane avowal. If I had dared, I would  have consulted some physician about this hallucination of his; but he was so  sane on other points that I hesitated to give my dreadful secret to the world.  I kept hoping that time and his daily pursuits would have their effect and  restore him to himself. But his illusion grows, and now I fear that nothing  will ever convince him that he did not commit the deed of which he accuses  himself. If he were not blind I would have more hope, but the blind have so  much time for brooding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think he had better be indulged in his fancies for the present,&rdquo; I ventured. &ldquo;If  he is laboring under an illusion it might be dangerous to cross him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>If?</i>&rdquo; she echoed in an indescribable tone  of amazement and dread. &ldquo;Can you for a moment harbor the idea that he has  spoken the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo;  I returned, with something of the cynicism of my later years, &ldquo;what caused you  to give such an unearthly scream just before this murder was made known to the  neighborhood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  stared, paled, and finally began to tremble, not, as I now believe, at the  insinuation latent in my words, but at the doubts which my question aroused in  her own breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I?&rdquo; she asked; then with a great burst of candor, which seemed inseparable from  her nature, she continued: &ldquo;Why do I try to mislead you or deceive myself? I  did give a shriek just before the alarm was raised next door; but it was not  from any knowledge I had of a crime having been committed, but because I  unexpectedly saw before me my husband whom I supposed to be on his way to  Poughkeepsie. He was looking very pale and strange, and for a moment I thought  I was beholding his ghost. But he soon explained his appearance by saying that  he had fallen from the train and had been only saved by a miracle from being  dismembered; and I was just bemoaning his mishap and trying to calm him and  myself, when that terrible shout was heard next door of &lsquo;Murder! murder!&rsquo;  Coming so soon after the shock he had himself experienced, it quite unnerved  him, and I think we can date his mental disturbance from that moment. For he  began almost immediately to take a morbid interest in the affair next door,  though it was weeks, if not months, before he let a word fall of the nature of  those you have just heard. Indeed it was not till I repeated to him some of the  expressions he was continually letting fall in his sleep, that he commenced to  accuse himself of crime and talk of retribution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say that your husband frightened you on that night by appearing suddenly at the  door when you thought him on his way to Poughkeepsie. Is Dr. Zabriskie in the  habit of thus going and coming alone at an hour so late as this must have  been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget that to the blind, night is less full of perils than the day. Often and  often has my husband found his way to his patients&rsquo; houses alone after  midnight; but on this especial evening he had Harry with him. Harry was his  driver, and always accompanied him when he went any distance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;all we have to do is to summon Harry and hear what he has to  say concerning this affair. He surely will know whether or not his master went  into the house next door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry  has left us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Dr. Zabriskie has another driver now. Besides&mdash;(I have  nothing to conceal from you)&mdash;Harry was not with him when he returned to the  house that evening, or the Doctor would not have been without his portmanteau  till the next day. Something&mdash;I have never known what&mdash;caused them to separate,  and that is why I have no answer to give the Doctor when he accuses himself of  committing a deed on that night which is wholly out of keeping with every other  act of his life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  have you never questioned Harry why they separated and why he allowed his  master to come home alone after the shock he had received at the station?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know there was any reason for doing so till long after he left us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when did he leave?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I do not remember. A few weeks or possibly a few days after that dreadful  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that I have not the least means of knowing. But,&rdquo; she suddenly cried, &ldquo;what do  you want of Harry? If he did not follow Dr. Zabriskie to his own door, he could  tell us nothing that would convince my husband that he is laboring under an  illusion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he might tell us something which would convince us that Dr. Zabriskie was not  himself after the accident, that he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  came from her lips in imperious tones. &ldquo;I will not believe that he shot Mr.  Hasbrouck even if you prove him to have been insane at the time. How could he?  My husband is blind. It would take a man of very keen sight to force himself  into a house that was closed for the night, and kill a man in the dark at one  shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo;  cried a voice from the doorway, &ldquo;it is only a blind man who could do this.  Those who trust to eyesight must be able to catch some glimpse of the mark they  aim at, and this room, as I have been told, was without a glimmer of light. But  the blind trust to sound, and as Mr. Hasbrouck spoke&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  burst from the horrified wife, &ldquo;is there no one to stop him when he speaks like  that?&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>II</b></h2>
  <p>WHEN  I related to my superiors the details of the foregoing interview, two of them  coincided with the wife in thinking that Dr. Zabriskie was in an irresponsible condition  of mind which made any statement of his questionable. But the third seemed  disposed to argue the matter, and, casting me an inquiring look, seemed to ask  what my opinion was on the subject. Answering him as if he had spoken, I gave  my conclusion as follows: That whether insane or not, Dr. Zabriskie had fired  the shot which terminated Mr. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s life.</p>
  <p>It  was the Inspector&rsquo;s own idea, but it was not shared in by the others, one of  whom had known the Doctor for years. Accordingly they compromised by postponing  all opinion till they had themselves interrogated the Doctor, and I was  detailed to bring him before them the next afternoon.</p>
  <p>He  came without reluctance, his wife accompanying him. In the short time which  elapsed between their leaving Lafayette Place and entering Headquarters, I  embraced the opportunity of observing them, and I found the study equally  exciting and interesting. His face was calm but hopeless, and his eye, which  should have shown a wild glimmer if there was truth in his wife&rsquo;s hypothesis,  was dark and unfathomable, but neither frenzied nor uncertain. He spake but  once and listened to nothing, though now and then his wife moved as if to  attract his attention, and once even stole her hand toward his, in the tender  hope that he would feel its approach and accept her sympathy. But he was deaf  as well as blind; and sat wrapped up in thoughts which she, I know, would have  given worlds to penetrate.</p>
  <p>Her  countenance was not without its mystery also. She showed in every lineament  passionate concern and misery, and a deep tenderness from which the element of  fear was not absent. But she, as well as he, betrayed that some  misunderstanding, deeper than any I had previously suspected, drew its  intangible veil between them and made the near proximity in which they sat, at  once a heart-piercing delight and an unspeakable pain. What was this  misunderstanding? and what was the character of the fear that modified her  every look of love in his direction? Her perfect indifference to my presence  proved that it was not connected with the position in which he had put himself  towards the police by his voluntary confession of crime, nor could I thus  interpret the expression of frantic question which now and then contracted her  features, as she raised her eyes towards his sightless orbs, and strove to  read, in his firm-set lips, the meaning of those assertions she could only  ascribe to a loss of reason.</p>
  <p>The  stopping of the carriage seemed to awaken both from thoughts that separated  rather than united them. He turned his face in her direction, and she,  stretching forth her hand, prepared to lead him from the carriage, without any  of that display of timidity which had been previously evident in her manner.</p>
  <p>As  his guide she seemed to fear nothing; as his lover, everything.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is another and a deeper tragedy underlying the outward and obvious one,&rdquo; was my  inward conclusion, as I followed them into the presence of the gentlemen  awaiting them.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Dr.  Zabriskie&rsquo;s appearance was a shock to those who knew him; so was his manner,  which was calm, straightforward, and quietly determined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shot Mr. Hasbrouck,&rdquo; was his steady affirmation, given without any show of  frenzy or desperation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you ask me why I did it, I cannot answer; if you ask me how, I am ready to  state all that I know concerning the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Dr. Zabriskie,&rdquo; interposed his friend, &ldquo;the why is the most important thing for  us to consider just now. If you really desire to convince us that you committed  the dreadful crime of killing a totally inoffensive man, you should give us  some reason for an act so opposed to all your instincts and general conduct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the Doctor continued unmoved:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had no reason for murdering Mr. Hasbrouck. A hundred questions can elicit no  other reply; you had better keep to the how.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  deep-drawn breath from the wife answered the looks of the three gentlemen to  whom this suggestion was offered. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; that breath seemed to protest,  &ldquo;that he is not in his right mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  began to waver in my own opinion, and yet the intuition which has served me in  cases as seemingly impenetrable as this, bade me beware of following the  general judgment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  him to inform you how he got into the house,&rdquo; I whispered to Inspector D&mdash;, who  sat nearest me.</p>
  <p>Immediately  the Inspector put the question I had suggested:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  what means did you enter Mr. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s house at so late an hour as this  murder occurred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  blind doctor&rsquo;s head fell forward on his breast, and he hesitated for the first  and only time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will not believe me,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but the door was ajar when I came to it. Such  things make crime easy; it is the only excuse I have to offer for this dreadful  deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  front door of a respectable citizen&rsquo;s house ajar at half-past eleven at night.  It was a statement that fixed in all minds the conviction of the speaker&rsquo;s  irresponsibility. Mrs. Zabriskie&rsquo;s brow cleared, and her beauty became for a  moment dazzling as she held out her hands in irrepressible relief towards those  who were interrogating her husband. I alone kept my impassibility. A possible  explanation of this crime had flashed like lightning across my mind; an  explanation from which I inwardly recoiled, even while I was forced to consider  it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Zabriskie,&rdquo; remarked the Inspector who was most friendly to him, &ldquo;such old servants  as those kept by Mr. Hasbrouck do not leave the front door ajar at twelve o&rsquo;clock  at night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  ajar it was,&rdquo; repeated the blind doctor, with quiet emphasis; &ldquo;and finding it  so, I went in. When I came out again, I closed it. Do you wish me to swear to  what I say? If so, I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  could we reply? To see this splendid-looking man, hallowed by an affliction so  great that in itself it called forth the compassion of the most indifferent,  accusing himself of a cold-blooded crime, in tones that sounded dispassionate  because of the will that forced their utterance, was too painful in itself for  us to indulge in any unnecessary words. Compassion took the place of curiosity,  and each and all of us turned involuntary looks of pity upon the young wife  pressing so eagerly to his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  a blind man,&rdquo; ventured one, &ldquo;the assault was both deft and certain. Are you  accustomed to Mr. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s house, that you found your way with so little  difficulty to his bedroom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am accustomed&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>But  here his wife broke in with irrepressible passion:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not accustomed to that house. He has never been beyond the first-floor. Why,  why do you question him? Do you not see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  hand was on her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  he commanded. &ldquo;You know my skill in moving about a house; how I sometimes  deceive those who do not know me into believing that I can see, by the readiness  with which I avoid obstacles and find my way even in strange and untried  scenes. Do not try to make them think I am not in my right mind, or you will  drive me into the very condition you deprecate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  face, rigid, cold, and set, looked like that of a mask. Hers, drawn with horror  and filled with question that was fast taking the form of doubt, bespoke an  awful tragedy from which more that one of us recoiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you shoot a man dead without seeing him?&rdquo; asked the Superintendent, with  painful effort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me a pistol and I will show you,&rdquo; was the quick reply,</p>
  <p>A  low cry came from the wife. In a drawer near to every one of us there lay a  pistol, but no one moved to take it out. There was a look in the Doctor&rsquo;s eye  which made us fear to trust him with a pistol just then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will accept your assurance that you possess a skill beyond that of most men,&rdquo;  returned the Superintendent. And beckoning me forward, he whispered: &ldquo;This is a  case for the doctors and not for the police. Remove him quietly, and notify Dr.  Southyard of what I say.</p>
  <p>But  Dr. Zabriskie, who seemed to have an almost supernatural acuteness of hearing,  gave a violent start at this and spoke up for the first time with real passion  in his voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, I pray you. I can bear anything but that. Remember, gentlemen, that I am  blind; that I cannot see who is about me; that  my life would be a torture if I felt myself surrounded by spies watching to  catch some evidence of madness in me. Rather conviction at once, death,  dishonor, and obloquy. These I have incurred. These I have brought upon myself  by crime, but not this worse fate &mdash;oh! not this worse fate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  passion was so intense and yet so confined within the bounds of decorum, that  we felt strangely impressed by it. Only the wife stood transfixed, with the  dread growing in her heart, till her white, waxen visage seemed even more  terrible to contemplate than his passion-distorted one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not strange that my wife thinks me demented,&rdquo; the Doctor continued, as if  afraid of the silence that answered him. &ldquo;But it is your business to  discriminate, and you should know a sane man when you see him.&quot;</p>
  <p>Inspector  D&mdash; no longer hesitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;give us the least proof that your assertions are true, and we  will lay your case before the prosecuting attorney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proof?  Is not a man&rsquo;s word&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  man&rsquo;s confession is worth much without some evidence to support it. In your  case there is none. You cannot even produce the pistol with which you assert  yourself to have committed the deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  true. I was frightened by what I had done, and the instinct of  self-preservation led me to rid myself of the weapon in any way I could. But  some one found this pistol; some one picked it up from the sidewalk of  Lafayette Place on that fatal night. Advertise for it. Offer a reward. I will  give you the money.&rdquo; Suddenly he appeared to realize how all this sounded. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;  cried he, &ldquo;I know the story seems improbable; all I say seems improbable; but  it is not the probable things that happen in this life, but the improbable, as  you should know, who every day dig deep into the heart of human affairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Were  these the ravings of insanity? I began to understand the wife&rsquo;s terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  bought the pistol,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;of&mdash;alas! I cannot tell you his name.  Everything is against me. I cannot adduce one proof; yet she, even she, is  beginning to fear that my story is true. I know it by her silence, a silence  that yawns between us like a deep and unfathomable gulf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  at these words her voice rang out with passionate vehemence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, it is false! I will never believe that your hands have been plunged in  blood. You are my own pure-hearted Constant, cold, perhaps, and stern, but with  no guilt upon your conscience, save in your own wild imagination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen,  you are no friend to me,&rdquo; he declared, pushing her gently aside. &ldquo;Believe me  innocent, but say nothing to lead these others to doubt my word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  she said no more, but her looks spoke volumes.</p>
  <p>The  result was that he was not detained, though he prayed for instant commitment.  He seemed to dread his own home, and the surveillance to which he instinctively  knew he would henceforth be subjected. To see him shrink from his wife&rsquo;s hand  as she strove to lead him from the room was sufficiently painful; but the  feeling thus aroused was nothing to that with which we observed the keen and  agonized expectancy of his look as he turned and listened for the steps of the  officer who followed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall never again know whether or not I am alone,&rdquo; was his final observation as  he left our presence.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>I  said nothing to my superiors of the thoughts I had had while listening to the  above interrogatories. A theory had presented itself to my mind which explained  in some measure the mysteries of the Doctor&rsquo;s conduct, but I wished for time  and opportunity to test its reasonableness before submitting it to their higher  judgment. And these seemed likely to be given me, for the Inspectors continued  divided in their opinion of the blind physician&rsquo;s guilt, and the  District-Attorney, when told of the affair, pooh-poohed it without mercy, and  declined to stir in the matter unless some tangible evidence were forthcoming  to substantiate the poor Doctor&rsquo;s self-accusations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  guilty, why does he shrink from giving his motives,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and if so  anxious to go to the gallows, why does he suppress the very facts calculated to  send him there? He is as mad as a March hare, and it is to an asylum he should  go and not to a jail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  this conclusion I failed to agree with him, and as time wore on my suspicions  took shape and finally ended in a fixed conviction. Dr. Zabriskie had committed  the crime he avowed, but &mdash; let me proceed a little further with my story before  I reveal what lies beyond that &ldquo;but.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding  Dr. Zabriskie&rsquo;s almost frenzied appeal for solitude, a man had been placed in  surveillance over him in the shape of a young doctor skilled in diseases of the  brain. This man communicated more or less with the police, and one morning I  received from him the following extracts from the diary he had been ordered to  keep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Doctor is settling into a deep melancholy from which he tries to rise at times,  but with only indifferent success. Yesterday he rode around to all his patients  for the purpose of withdrawing his services on the plea of illness. But he  still keeps his office open, and to-day I had the opportunity of witnessing his  reception and treatment of the many sufferers who came to him for aid. I think  he was conscious of my presence, though an attempt had been made to conceal it.  For the listening look never left his face from the moment he entered the room,  and once he rose and passed quickly from wall to wall, groping with  outstretched hands into every nook and corner, and barely escaping contact with  the curtain behind which I was hidden. But if he suspected my presence, he showed  no displeasure at it, wishing perhaps for a witness to his skill in the  treatment of disease.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  truly I never beheld a finer manifestation of practical insight in cases of a  more or less baffling nature than I beheld in him to-day. He is certainly a  most wonderful physician, and I feel bound to record that his mind is as clear  for business as if no shadow had fallen upon it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Zabriskie loves his wife, but in a way that tortures both himself and her. If  she is gone from the house he is wretched, and yet when she returns he often  forbears to speak to her, or if he does speak, it is with a constraint that  hurts her more than his silence. I was present when she came in to-day. Her  step, which had been eager on the stairway, flagged as she approached the room,  and he naturally noted the change and gave his own interpretation to it. His  face, which had been very pale, flushed suddenly, and a nervous trembling  seized him which he sought in vain to hide. But by the time her tall and  beautiful figure stood in the doorway he was his usual self again in all but  the expression of his eyes, which stared straight before him in an agony of  longing only to be observed in those who have once seen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Where  have you been, Helen?&rsquo; he asked, as, contrary to his wont, he moved to meet  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;To  my mother&rsquo;s, to Arnold &amp; Constable&rsquo;s, and to the hospital, as you  requested,&rsquo; was her quick answer, made without faltering or embarrassment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  stepped still nearer and took her hand, and as he did so my physician&rsquo;s eye  noted how his finger lay over her pulse in seeming unconsciousness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Nowhere  else?&rsquo; he queried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  smiled the saddest kind of smile and shook her head; then, remembering that he  could not see this movement, she cried in a wistful tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Nowhere  else, Constant; I was too anxious to get back.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  expected him to drop her hand at this, but he did not; and his finger still rested  on her pulse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;And  whom did you see while you were gone?&rsquo; he continued.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  told him, naming over several names.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;You  must have enjoyed yourself,&rsquo; was his cold comment, as he let go her hand and  turned away. </p>
  <p>But  his manner showed relief, and I could not but sympathize with the pitiable  situation of a man who found himself forced to means like these for probing the  heart of his young wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  when I turned towards her I realized that her position was but little happier  than his. Tears are no strangers to her eyes, but those that welled up at this  moment seemed to possess a bitterness that promised but little peace for her  future. Yet she quickly dried them and busied herself with ministrations for  his comfort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I am any judge of woman, Helen Zabriskie is superior to most of her sex. That  her husband mistrusts her is evident, but whether this is the result of the  stand she has taken in his regard, or only a manifestation of dementia, I have  as yet been unable to determine. I dread to leave them alone together, and yet  when I presume to suggest that she should be on her guard in her interviews  with him, she smiles very placidly and tells me that nothing would give her  greater joy than to see him lift his hand against her, for that would argue that  he is not accountable for his deeds or for his assertions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  it would be a grief to see her injured by this passionate and unhappy man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have said that you wanted all details I could give; so I feel bound to say,  that Dr. Zabriskie tries to be considerate of his wife, though he often fails  in the attempt. When she offers herself as his guide, or assists him with his  mail, or performs any of the many acts of kindness by which she continually  manifests her sense of his affliction, he thanks her with courtesy and often  with kindness, yet I know she would willingly exchange all his set phrases for  one fond embrace or impulsive smile of affection. That he is not in the full  possession of his faculties would be too much to say, and yet upon what other hypothesis  can we account for the inconsistencies of his conduct.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have before me two visions of mental suffering. At noon I passed the office  door, and looking within, saw the figure of Dr. Zabriskie seated in his great  chair, lost in thought or deep in those memories which make an abyss in one&rsquo;s  consciousness. His hands, which were clenched, rested upon the arms of his  chair, and in one of them I detected a woman&rsquo;s glove, which I had no difficulty  in recognizing as one of the pair worn by his wife this morning. He held it as  a tiger might hold his prey or a miser his gold, but his set features and  sightless eyes betrayed that a conflict of emotions was waging within him,  among which tenderness had but little share.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Though  alive, as he usually is, to every sound, he was too absorbed at this moment to  notice my presence though I had taken no pains to approach quietly. I therefore  stood for a full minute watching him, till an irresistible sense of the shame  of thus spying upon a blind man in his moments of secret anguish seized upon me  and I turned away. But not before I saw his features relax in a storm of  passionate feeling, as he rained kisses after kisses on the senseless kid he  had so long held in his motionless grasp. Yet when an hour later he entered the  dining-room on his wife&rsquo;s arm, there was nothing in his manner to show that he  had in any way changed in his attitude towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  other picture was more tragic still. I have no business with Mrs. Zabriskie&rsquo;s  affairs; but as I passed upstairs to my room an hour ago, I caught a fleeting  vision of her tall form, with the arms thrown up over her head in a paroxysm of  feeling which made her as oblivious to my presence as her husband had been  several hours before. Were the words that escaped her lips &lsquo;Thank God we have  no children!&rsquo; or was this exclamation suggested to me by the passion and  unrestrained impulse of her action?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Side  by side with these lines, I, Ebenezer Gryce, placed the following extracts from  my own diary:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Watched  the Zabriskie mansion for five hours this morning, from the second story window  of an adjoining hotel. Saw the Doctor when he drove away on his round of  visits, and saw him when he returned. A colored man accompanied him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-day  I followed Mrs. Zabriskie. I had a motive for this, the nature of which I think  it wisest not to divulge. She went first to a house in Washington Place where I  am told her mother lives. Here she stayed some time, after which she drove down  to Canal Street, where she did some shopping, and later stopped at the  hospital, into which I took the liberty of following her. She seemed to know  many there, and passed from cot to cot with a smile in which I alone discerned  the sadness of a broken heart. When she left, I left also, without having learned  anything beyond the fact that Mrs. Zabriskie is one who does her duty in sorrow  as in happiness. A rare and trustworthy woman I should say, and yet her husband  does not trust her. Why?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have spent this day in accumulating details in regard to Dr. and Mrs. Zabriskie&rsquo;s  life previous to the death of Mr. Hasbrouck. I learned from sources it would be  unwise to quote just here, that Mrs. Zabriskie had not lacked enemies ready to  charge her with coquetry; that while she had never sacrificed her dignity in  public, more than one person had been heard to declare, that Dr. Zabriskie was  fortunate in being blind, since the sight of his wife&rsquo;s beauty would have but  poorly compensated him for the pain he would have suffered in seeing how that  beauty was admired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  all gossip is more or less tinged with exaggeration I have no doubt, yet when a  name is mentioned in connection with such stories, there is usually some truth  at the bottom of them.</p>
  <p>And  a name is mentioned in this case, though I do not think it worth my while to  repeat it here; and loth as I am to recognize the fact, it is a name that  carries with it doubts that might easily account for the husband&rsquo;s jealousy.  True, I have found no one who dares to hint that she still continues to attract  attention or to bestow smiles in any direction save where they legally belong.  For since a certain memorable night which we all know, neither Dr. Zabriskie  nor his wife have been seen save in their own domestic circle, and it is not  into such scenes that this serpent, of which I have spoken, ever intrudes, nor  is it in places of sorrow or suffering that his smile shines, or his  fascinations flourish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so one portion of my theory is proved to be sound. Dr. Zabriskie is jealous of  his wife: whether with good cause or bad I am not prepared to decide; for her  present attitude, clouded as it is by the tragedy in which she and her husband  are both involved, must differ very much from that which she held when her life  was unshadowed by doubt, and her admirers could be counted by the score.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have just found out where Harry is. As he is in service some miles up the  river, I shall have to be absent from my post for several hours, but I consider  the game well worth the candle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Light  at last. I have seen Harry, and, by means known only to the police, have  succeeded in making him talk. His story is substantially this: That on the  night so often mentioned, he packed his master&rsquo;s portmanteau at eight o&rsquo;clock  and at ten called a carriage and rode with the Doctor to the Twenty-ninth Street  station. He was told to buy tickets for Poughkeepsie where his master had been  called in consultation, and having done this, hurried back to join his master  on the platform. They had walked together as far as the cars, and Dr. Zabriskie  was just stepping on to the train when a man pushed himself hurriedly between  them and whispered something into his master&rsquo;s ear, which caused him to fall  back and lose his footing. Dr. Zabriskie&rsquo;s body slid half under the car, but he  was withdrawn before any harm was done, though the cars gave a lurch at that  moment which must have frightened him exceedingly, for his face was white when  he rose to his feet, and when Harry offered to assist him again on to the  train, he refused to go and said he would return home and not attempt to ride  to Poughkeepsie that night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  gentleman, whom Harry now saw to be Mr. Stanton, an intimate friend of Dr.  Zabriskie, smiled very queerly at this, and taking the Doctor&rsquo;s arm led him  away to a carriage. Harry naturally followed them, but the Doctor hearing his  steps, turned and bade him, in a very peremptory tone, to take the omnibus  home, and then, as if on second thought, told him to go to Poughkeepsie in his  stead and explain to the people there that he was too shaken up by his misstep  to do his duty, and that he would be with them next morning. This seemed  strange to Harry, but he had no reasons for disobeying his master&rsquo;s orders, and  so rode to Poughkeepsie. But the Doctor did not follow him the next day; on the  contrary he telegraphed for him to return, and when he got back dismissed him  with a month&rsquo;s wages. This ended Harry&rsquo;s connection with the Zabriskie family.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  simple story bearing out what the wife has already told us; but it furnishes a  link which may prove invaluable. Mr. Stanton, whose first name is Theodore,  knows the real reason why Dr. Zabriskie returned home on the night of the  seventeenth of July, 1851. Mr. Stanton, consequently, I must see, and this  shall be my business to-morrow. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Checkmate!  Theodore Stanton is not in this country. Though this points him out as the man  from whom Dr. Zabriskie bought the pistol, it does not facilitate my work,  which is becoming more and more difficult.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Stanton&rsquo;s whereabouts are not even known to his most intimate friends. He  sailed from this country most unexpectedly on the eighteenth of July a year  ago, which was <i>the day after the murder  of Mr. Hasbrouck</i>. It looks like a flight, especially as he has failed to  maintain open communication even with his relatives. Was he the man who shot  Mr. Hasbrouck? No; but he was the man who put the pistol in Dr. Zabriskie&rsquo;s  hand that night, and, whether he did this with purpose or not, was evidently so  alarmed at the catastrophe which followed that he took the first outgoing  steamer to Europe. So far, all is clear, but there are mysteries yet to be  solved, which will require my utmost tact. What if I should seek out the  gentleman with whose name that of Mrs. Zabriskie has been linked, and see if I  can in any way connect him with Mr. Stanton or the events of that night?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eureka!  I have discovered that Mr. Stanton cherished a mortal hatred for the gentleman  above mentioned. It was a covert feeling, but no less deadly on that account;  and while it never led him into any extravagances, it was of force sufficient  to account for many a secret misfortune which happened to that gentleman. Now,  if I can prove he was the Mephistopheles who whispered insinuations into the  ear of our blind Faust, I may strike a fact that will lead me out of this maze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how can I approach secrets so delicate without compromising the woman I feel  bound to respect, if only for the devoted love she manifests for her unhappy  husband!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall have to appeal to Joe Smithers. This is something which I always hate to  do, but as long as he will take money, and as long as he is fertile in  resources for obtaining the truth from people I am myself unable to reach, so  long must I make use of his cupidity and his genius. He is an honorable fellow  in one way, and never retails as gossip what he acquires for our use. How will  he proceed in this case, and by what tactics will he gain the very delicate  information which we need? I own that I am curious to see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall really have to put down at length the incidents of this night. I always  knew that Joe Smithers was invaluable to the police, but I really did not know  he possessed talents of so high an order. He wrote me this morning that he had  succeeded in getting Mr. T&mdash;&rsquo;s promise to spend the evening with him, and  advised me that if I desired to be present also, his own servant would not be  at home, and that an opener of bottles would be required.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I was very anxious to see Mr. T&mdash; with my own eyes, I accepted the invitation to  play the spy upon a spy, and went at the proper hour to Mr. Smithers&rsquo;s rooms,  which are in the University Building. I found them picturesque in the extreme.  Piles of books stacked here and there to the ceiling made nooks and corners  which could be quite shut off by a couple of old pictures that were set into  movable frames that swung out or in at the whim or convenience of the owner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I liked the dark shadows cast by these pictures, I pulled them both out, and  made such other arrangements as appeared likely to facilitate the purpose I had  in view, then I sat down and waited for the two gentlemen who were expected to  come in together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  arrived almost immediately, whereupon I rose and played my part with all  necessary discretion. While ridding Mr. T&mdash; of his overcoat, I stole a look at  his face. It is not a handsome one, but it boasts of a gay, devil-may-care  expression which doubtless makes it dangerous to many women, while his manners  are especially attractive, and his voice the richest and most persuasive that I  ever heard. I contrasted him, almost against my will, with Dr. Zabriskie, and  decided that with most women the former&rsquo;s undoubted fascinations of speech and  bearing would outweigh the latter&rsquo;s great beauty and mental endowments; but I  doubted if they would with her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  conversation which immediately began was brilliant but desultory, for Mr.  Smithers, with an airy lightness for which he is remarkable, introduced topic  after topic, perhaps for the purpose of showing off Mr. T&mdash;&rsquo;s versatility, and  perhaps for the deeper and more sinister purpose of shaking the kaleidoscope of  talk so thoroughly, that the real topic which we were met to discuss should not  make an undue impression on the mind of his guest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile  one, two, three bottles passed, and I saw Joe Smithers&rsquo;s eye grow calmer and  that of Mr. T&mdash; more brilliant and more uncertain. As the last bottle showed  signs of failing, Joe cast me a meaning glance, and the real business of the  evening began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not attempt to relate the half-dozen failures which Joe made in  endeavoring to elicit the facts we were in search of, without arousing the  suspicion of his visitor. I am only going to relate the successful attempt.  They had been talking now for some hours, and I, who had long before been waved  from their immediate presence, was hiding my curiosity and growing excitement  behind one of the pictures, when suddenly I heard Joe say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;He  has the most remarkable memory I ever met. He can tell to a day when any  notable event occurred.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Pshaw!&rsquo;  answered his companion, who, by the by, was known to pride himself upon his own  memory for dates, &lsquo;I can state where I went and what I did on every day in the  year. That may not embrace what you call &lsquo;notable events,&rsquo; but the memory  required is all the more remarkable, is it not?&rsquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo;  was his friend&rsquo;s provoking reply, &lsquo;you are bluffing, Ben; I will never believe  that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  T&mdash;, who had passed by this time into that state of intoxication which makes  persistence in an assertion a duty as well as a pleasure, threw back his head,  and as the wreaths of smoke rose in airy spirals from his lips, reiterated his  statement, and offered to submit to any test of his vaunted powers which the  other might dictate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;You  have a diary&mdash;&rsquo; began Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Which  is at home,&rsquo; completed the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Will  you allow me to refer to it to-morrow, if I am suspicious of the accuracy of  your recollections?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Undoubtedly,&rsquo;  returned the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Very  well, then, I will wager you a cool fifty, that you cannot tell where you were  between the hours of ten and eleven on a certain night which I will name.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Done!&rsquo;  cried the other, bringing out his pocket-book and laying it on the table before  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joe  followed his example and then summoned me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Write  a date down here,&rsquo; he commanded, pushing a piece of paper towards me, with a  look keen as the flash of a blade. &lsquo;Any date, man,&rsquo; he added, as I appeared to  hesitate in the embarrassment I thought natural under the circumstances. &lsquo;Put  down day, month, and year, only don&rsquo;t go too far back; not farther than two  years.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smiling  with the air of a flunkey admitted to the sports of his superiors, I wrote a  line and laid it before Mr. Smithers, who at once pushed it with a careless  gesture towards his companion. You can of course guess the date I made use of:  July 17, 1851. Mr. T&mdash;, who had evidently looked upon this matter as mere play,  flushed scarlet as he read these words, and for one instant looked as if he had  rather flee our presence than answer Joe Smithers&rsquo;s nonchalant glance of  inquiry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  have given my word and will keep it,&rsquo; he said at last, but with a look in my  direction that sent me reluctantly back to my retreat. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you  want names,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;that is, if anything I have to tell is of a delicate  nature? &lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;O  no,&rsquo; answered the other, &lsquo;only facts and places.&rsquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  don&rsquo;t think places are necessary either,&rsquo; he returned. &lsquo;I will tell you what I  did and that must serve you. I did not promise to give number and street.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Well,  well,&rsquo; Joe exclaimed; &lsquo;earn your fifty, that is all. Show that you remember  where you were on the night of&rsquo;&mdash;and with an admirable show of indifference he  pretended to consult the paper between them&mdash;&lsquo;the seventeenth of July, 1851, and  I shall be satisfied.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  was at the club for one thing,&rsquo; said Mr. T&mdash;; &lsquo;then I went to see a lady  friend, where I stayed till eleven. She wore a blue muslin&mdash;What is that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had betrayed myself by a quick movement which sent a glass tumbler crashing to  the floor. Helen Zabriskie had worn a blue muslin  on that same night. I had noted it when I stood on the balcony watching her and  her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;That  noise?&rsquo; It was Joe who was speaking. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know Reuben as well as I do or  you wouldn&rsquo;t ask. It is his practice, I am sorry to say, to accentuate his  pleasure in draining my bottles, by dropping a glass at every third one.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  T&mdash; went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;She  was a married woman and I thought she loved me; but&mdash; and this is the greatest  proof I can offer you that I am giving you a true account of that night &mdash;she  had not had the slightest idea of the extent of my passion, and only consented to  see me at all because she thought, poor thing, that a word from her would set me  straight, and rid her of attentions that were fast becoming obnoxious. A sorry  figure for a fellow to cut who has not been without his triumphs; but you  caught me on the most detestable date in my calendar, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is where he stopped being interesting, so I will not waste time by quoting  further. And now what reply shall I make when Joe Smithers asks me double his  usual price, as he will be sure to do, next time? Has he not earned an advance?  I really think so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have spent the whole day in weaving together the facts I have gleaned, and the  suspicions I have formed, into a consecutive whole likely to present my theory  in a favorable light to my superiors. But just as I thought myself in shape to  meet their inquiries, I received an immediate summons into their presence,  where I was given a duty to perform of so extraordinary and unexpected a  nature, that it effectually drove from my mind all my own plans for the  elucidation of the Zabriskie mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  was nothing more nor less than to take charge of a party of people who were  going to the Jersey heights for the purpose of testing Dr. Zabriskie&rsquo;s skill  with a pistol.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>III</b></h2>
  <p>The  cause of this sudden move was soon explained to me. Mrs. Zabriskie, anxious to  have an end put to the present condition of affairs, had begged for a more  rigid examination into her husband&rsquo;s state. This being accorded, a strict and  impartial inquiry had taken place, with a result not unlike that which followed  the first one. Three out of his four interrogators judged him insane, and could  not be moved from their opinion though opposed by the verdict of the young  expert who had been living in the house with him. Dr. Zabriskie seemed to read  their thoughts, and, showing extreme agitation, begged as before for an  opportunity to prove his sanity by showing his skill in shooting. This time a  disposition was evinced to grant his request, which Mrs. Zabriskie no sooner  perceived, than she added her supplications to his that the question might be  thus settled.</p>
  <p>A  pistol was accordingly brought; but at sight of it her courage failed, and she  changed her prayer to an entreaty that the experiment should be postponed till  the next day, and should then take place in the woods away from the sight and  hearing of needless spectators.</p>
  <p>Though  it would have been much wiser to have ended the matter there and then, the  Superintendent was prevailed upon to listen to her entreaties, and thus it was  that I came to be a spectator, if not a participator, in the final scene of  this most sombre drama.</p>
  <p>There  are some events which impress the human mind so deeply that their memory  mingles with all after-experiences. Though I have made it a rule to forget as  soon as possible the tragic episodes into which I am constantly plunged, there  is one scene in my life which will not depart at my will; and that is the sight  which met my eyes from the bow of the small boat in which Dr. Zabriskie and his  wife were rowed over to Jersey on that memorable afternoon.</p>
  <p>Though  it was by no means late in the day, the sun was already sinking, and the bright  red glare which filled the heavens and shone full upon the faces of the half-dozen  persons before me added much to the tragic nature of the scene, though we were  far from comprehending its full significance.</p>
  <p>The  Doctor sat with his wife in the stern, and it was upon their faces my glance  was fixed. The glare shone luridly on his sightless eyeballs, and as I noticed  his un-winking lids I realized as never before what it was to be blind in the  midst of sunshine. Her eyes, on the contrary, were lowered, but there was a  look of hopeless misery in her colorless face which made her appearance  infinitely pathetic, and I felt confident that if he could only have seen her,  he would not have maintained the cold and unresponsive manner which chilled the  words on her lips and made all advance on her part impossible.</p>
  <p>On  the seat in front of them sat the Inspector and a doctor, and from some  quarter, possibly from under the Inspector&rsquo;s coat, there came the monotonous  ticking of a small clock, which, I had been told, was to serve as a target for  the blind man&rsquo;s aim.</p>
  <p>This  ticking was all I heard, though the noise and bustle of a great traffic was  pressing upon us on every side. And I am sure it was all that she heard, as,  with hand pressed to her heart and eyes fixed on the opposite shore, she waited  for the event which was to determine whether the man she loved was a criminal  or only a being afflicted of God, and worthy of her unceasing care and  devotion.</p>
  <p>As  the sun cast its last scarlet gleam over the water, the boat grounded, and it  fell to my lot to assist Mrs. Zabriskie up the bank. As I did so, I allowed  myself to say: &ldquo;I am your friend, Mrs. Zabriskie,&rdquo; and was astonished to see  her tremble, and turn toward me with a look like that of a frightened child.</p>
  <p>But  there was always this characteristic blending in her countenance of the  childlike and the severe, such as may so often be seen in the faces of nuns,  and beyond an added pang of pity for this beautiful but afflicted woman, I let  the moment pass without giving it the weight it perhaps demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Doctor and his wife had a long talk last night,&rdquo; was whispered in my ear as we  wound our way along into the woods. I turned and perceived at my side the  expert physician, portions of whose diary I have already quoted. He had come by  another boat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it did not seem to heal whatever breach lies between them,&rdquo; he proceeded. Then  in a quick, curious tone, he asked: &ldquo;Do you believe this attempt on his part is  likely to prove anything but a farce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe he will shatter the clock to pieces with his first shot,&rdquo; I answered,  and could say no more, for we had already reached the ground which had been  selected for this trial at arms, and the various members of the party were  being placed in their several positions.</p>
  <p>The  Doctor, to whom light and darkness were alike, stood with his face towards the  western glow, and at his side were grouped the Inspector and the two  physicians. </p>
  <p>On  the arm of one of the latter hung Dr. Zabriskie&rsquo;s overcoat, which he had taken  off as soon as he reached the field.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Zabriskie stood at the other end of the opening, near a tall stump, upon which  it had been decided that the clock should be placed when the moment came for  the Doctor to show his skill. She had been accorded the privilege of setting  the clock on this stump, and I saw it shining in her hand as she paused for a  moment to glance back at the circle of gentlemen who were awaiting her movements.  The hands of the clock stood at five minutes to five, though I scarcely noted  the fact at the time, for her eyes were on mine, and as she passed me she spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he is not himself, he cannot be trusted. Watch him carefully, and see that he  does no mischief to himself or others. Be at his right hand, and stop him if he  does not handle his pistol properly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  promised, and she passed on, setting the clock upon the stump and immediately  drawing back to a suitable distance at the right, where she stood, wrapped in  her long dark cloak, quite alone. Her face shone ghastly white, even in its  environment of snow-covered boughs which surrounded her, and, noting this, I  wished the minutes fewer between the present moment and the hour of five, at  which he was to draw the trigger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Zabriskie,&rdquo; quoth the Inspector, &ldquo;we have endeavored to make this trial a  perfectly fair one. You are to have one shot at a small clock which has been  placed within a suitable distance, and which you are expected to hit, guided  only by the sound which it will make in striking the hour of five. Are you  satisfied with the arrangement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly.  Where is my wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the other side of the field, some ten paces from the stump upon which the  clock is fixed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  bowed, and his face showed satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I expect the clock to strike soon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  less than five minutes,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let me have the pistol; I wish to become acquainted with its size and weight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  glanced at each other, then across at her.</p>
  <p>She  made a gesture; it was one of acquiescence,</p>
  <p>Immediately  the Inspector placed the weapon in the blind man&rsquo;s hand. It was at once  apparent that the Doctor understood the instrument, and my last doubt vanished  as to the truth of all he had told us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  God I am blind this hour and cannot see <i>her,</i>&rdquo;  fell unconsciously from his lips; then, before the echo of these words had left  my ears, he raised his voice and observed calmly enough, considering that he  was about to prove himself a criminal in order to save himself from being  thought a madman,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  no one move. I must have my ears free for catching the first stroke of the  clock.&rdquo; And he raised the pistol before him.</p>
  <p>There  was a moment of torturing suspense and deep, unbroken silence. My eyes were on  him, and so I did not watch the clock, but suddenly I was moved by some  irresistible impulse to note how Mrs. Zabriskie was bearing herself at this  critical moment, and, casting a hurried glance in her direction, I perceived  her tall figure swaying from side to side, as if under an intolerable strain of  feeling. Her eyes were on the clock, the hands of which seemed to creep with  snail-like pace along the dial, when unexpectedly, and a full minute before the  minute hand had reached the stroke of five, I caught a movement on her part, saw  the flash of something round and white show for an instant against the darkness  of her cloak, and was about to shriek warning to the Doctor, when the shrill,  quick stroke of a clock rung out on the frosty air, followed by the ping and  flash of a pistol.</p>
  <p>A  sound of shattered glass, followed by a suppressed cry, told us that the bullet  had struck the mark, but before we could move, or rid our eyes of the smoke  which the wind had blown into our faces, there came another sound which made  our hair stand on end and sent the blood back in terror to our hearts. Another  clock was striking, the clock which we now perceived was still standing upright  on the stump where Mrs. Zabriskie had placed it.</p>
  <p>Whence  came the clock, then, which had struck before the time and been shattered for  its pains? One quick look told us. On the ground, ten paces at the right, lay  Helen Zabriskie, a broken clock at her side, and in her breast a bullet which  was fast sapping the life from her sweet eyes.</p>
  <p>We  had to tell him, there was such pleading in her looks; and never shall I forget  the scream that rang from his lips as he realized the truth. Breaking from our  midst, he rushed forward, and fell at her feet as if guided by some  supernatural instinct.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo;  he shrieked, &ldquo;what is this? Were not my hands dyed deep enough in blood that  you should make me answerable for your life also?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  eyes were closed, but she opened them. Looking long and steadily at his  agonized face, she faltered forth:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not you who have killed me; it is your crime. Had you been innocent of Mr.  Hasbrouck&rsquo;s death, your bullet would never have found my heart. Did you think I  could survive the proof that you had killed that good man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  did it unwittingly. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  she commanded, with an awful look, which, happily, he could not see. &ldquo;I had  another motive. I wished to prove to you, even at the cost of my life, that I  loved you, had always loved you, and not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was now his turn to silence her. His hand crept over her lips, and his  despairing face turned itself blindly towards us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo;  he cried; &ldquo;leave us! Let me take a last farewell of my dying wife, without  listeners or spectators.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Consulting  the eye of the physician who stood beside me, and seeing no hope in it, I fell  slowly back. The others followed, and the Doctor was left alone with his wife.  From the distant position we took, we saw her arms creep round his neck, saw  her head fall confidingly on his breast, then silence settled upon them and  upon all nature, the gathering twilight deepening, till the last glow  disappeared from the heavens above and from the circle of leafless trees which  enclosed this tragedy from the outside world.</p>
  <p>But  at last there came a stir, and Dr. Zabriskie, rising up before us, with the  dead body of his wife held closely to his breast, confronted us with a  countenance so rapturous that he looked like a man transfigured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will carry her to the boat,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Not another hand shall touch her. She  was my true wife, my true wife!&rdquo; And he towered into an attitude of such  dignity and passion, that for a moment he took on heroic proportions and we  forgot that he had just proved himself to have committed a coldblooded and  ghastly crime.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>The  stars were shining when we again took our seats in the boat; and if the scene  of our crossing to Jersey was impressive, what shall be said of that of our  return.</p>
  <p>The  Doctor, as before, sat in the stern, an awesome figure, upon which the moon  shone with a white radiance that seemed to lift his face out of the surrounding  darkness and set it, like an image of frozen horror, before our eyes. Against  his breast he held the form of his dead wife, and now and then I saw him stoop  as if he were listening for some tokens of life at her set lips. Then he would  lift himself again, with hopelessness stamped upon his features, only to lean  forward in renewed hope that was again destined to disappointment.</p>
  <p>The  Inspector and the accompanying physician had taken seats in the bow, and unto  me had been assigned the special duty of watching over the Doctor. This I did  from a low seat in front of him. I was therefore so close that I heard his  laboring breath, and though my heart was full of awe and compassion, I could  not prevent myself from bending towards him and saying these words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Zabriskie, the mystery of your crime is no longer a mystery to me. Listen and  see if I do not understand your temptation, and how you, a conscientious and  God-fearing man, came to slay your innocent neighbor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  friend of yours, or so he called himself, had for a long time filled your ears  with tales tending to make you suspicious of your wife and jealous of a certain  man whom I will not name. You knew that your friend had a grudge against this  man, and so for many months turned a deaf ear to his insinuations. But finally some  change which you detected in your wife&rsquo;s bearing or conversation roused your  own suspicions, and you began to doubt if all was false that came to your ears,  and to curse your blindness, which in a measure rendered you helpless. The  jealous fever grew and had risen to a high point, when one night&mdash;a memorable  night&mdash;this friend met you just as you were leaving town, and with cruel craft  whispered in your ear that the man you hated was even then with your wife, and  that if you would return at once to your home you would find him in her  company.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  demon that lurks at the heart of all men, good or bad, thereupon took complete  possession of you, and you answered this false friend by saying that you would  not return without a pistol. Whereupon he offered to take you to his house and  give you his. You consented, and getting rid of your servant by sending him to  Poughkeepsie with your excuses, you entered a coach with your friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say you bought the pistol, and perhaps you did, but, however that may be, you left  his house with it in your pocket and, declining companionship, walked home,  arriving at the Colonnade a little before midnight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ordinarily  you have no difficulty in recognizing your own doorstep. But, being in a heated  frame of mind, you walked faster than usual and so passed your own house and  stopped at that of Mr. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s, one door beyond. As the entrances of these  houses are all alike, there was but one way by which you could have made  yourself sure that you had reached your own dwelling, and that was by feeling  for the doctor&rsquo;s sign at the side of the door. But you never thought of that.  Absorbed in dreams of vengeance, your sole impulse was to enter by the quickest  means possible. Taking out your night-key, you thrust it into the lock. It fitted,  but it took strength to turn it, so much strength that the key was twisted and  bent by the effort. But this incident, which would have attracted your  attention at another time, was lost upon you at this moment. An entrance had  been effected, and you were in too excited a frame of mind to notice at what  cost, or to detect the small differences apparent in the atmosphere and  furnishings of the two houses&mdash;trifles which would have arrested your attention  under other circumstances, and made you pause before the upper floor had been  reached.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was while going up the stairs that you took out your pistol, so that by the  time you arrived at the front-room door you held it ready cocked and drawn in  your hand. For, being blind, you feared escape on the part of your victim, and  so waited for nothing but the sound of a man&rsquo;s voice before firing. When,  therefore, the unfortunate Mr. Hasbrouck, roused by this sudden intrusion,  advanced with an exclamation of astonishment, you pulled the trigger, killing  him on the spot. It must have been immediately upon his fall that you  recognized from some word he uttered, or from some contact you may have had  with your surroundings, that you were in the wrong house and had killed the  wrong man; for you cried out, in evident remorse, &lsquo;God! what have I done!&rsquo; and  fled without approaching your victim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Descending  the stairs, you rushed from the house, closing the front door behind you and  regaining your own without being seen. But here you found yourself baffled in  your attempted escape, by two things. First, by the pistol you still held in  your hand, and secondly, by the fact that the key upon which you depended for  entering your own door was so twisted out of shape that you knew it would be  useless for you to attempt to use it. What did you do in this emergency? You  have already told us, though the story seemed so improbable at the time, you  found nobody to believe it but myself. The pistol you flung far away from you  down the pavement, from which, by one of those rare chances which sometimes  happen in this world, it was presently picked up by some late passer-by of more  or less doubtful character. The door offered less of an obstacle than you  anticipated; for when you turned to it again you found it, if I am not greatly  mistaken, ajar, left so, as we have reason to believe, by one who had gone out  of it but a few minutes before in a state which left him but little master of  his actions. It was this fact which provided you with an answer when you were  asked how you succeeded in getting into Mr. Hasbrouck&rsquo;s house after the family  had retired for the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Astonished  at the coincidence, but hailing with gladness the deliverance which it offered,  you went in and ascended at once into your wife&rsquo;s presence; and it was from her  lips, and not from those of Mrs. Hasbrouck, that the cry arose which startled  the neighborhood and prepared men&rsquo;s minds for the tragic words which were  shouted a moment later from the next house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she who uttered the scream knew of no tragedy save that which was taking place  in her own breast. She had just repulsed a dastardly suitor, and, seeing you  enter so unexpectedly in a state of unaccountable horror and agitation, was  naturally stricken with dismay, and thought she saw your ghost, or, what was  worse, a possible avenger; while you, having failed to kill the man you sought,  and having killed a man you esteemed, let no surprise on her part lure you into  any dangerous self-betrayal. You strove instead to soothe her, and even  attempted to explain the excitement under which you labored, by an account of  your narrow escape at the station, till the sudden alarm from next door  distracted her attention, and sent both your thoughts and hers in a different  direction. Not till conscience had fully awakened and the horror of your act  had had time to tell upon your sensitive nature, did you breathe forth those  vague confessions, which, not being supported by the only explanations which  would have made them credible, led her, as well as the police, to consider you  affected in your mind. Your pride as a man, and your consideration for her as a  woman, kept you silent, but did not keep the worm from preying upon your heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I not correct in my surmises, Dr. Zabriskie, and is not this the true  explanation of your crime? </p>
  <p>With  a strange look, he lifted up his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  said he; &ldquo;you will awaken her. See how peacefully she sleeps! I should not like  to have her awakened now, she is so tired, and I&mdash;I have not watched over her as  I should.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Appalled  at his gesture, his look, his tone, I drew back, and for a few minutes no sound  was to be heard but the steady dip-dip of the oars and the lap-lap of the  waters against the boat. Then there came a quick uprising, the swaying before  me of something dark and tall and threatening, and before I could speak or  move, or even stretch forth my hands to stay him, the seat before me was empty  and darkness had filled the place where but an instant previous he had sat, a  fearsome figure, erect and rigid as a sphinx.</p>
  <p>What  little moonlight there was only served to show us a few rising bubbles, marking  the spot where the unfortunate man had sunk with his much-loved burden. We  could not save him. As the widening circles fled farther and farther out, the  tide drifted us away, and we lost the spot which had seen the termination of  one of earth&rsquo;s saddest tragedies.</p>
  <p>The  bodies were never recovered. The police reserved to themselves the right of  withholding from the public the real facts which made this catastrophe an awful  remembrance to those who witnessed it. A verdict of accidental death by  drowning answered all purposes, and saved the memory of the unfortunate pair  from such calumny as might have otherwise assailed it. It was the least we  could do for two beings whom circumstances had so greatly afflicted.</p>
